147,8951,Sigmund,3.95,"12 fl. oz. bottle, thanks to my son Steinar. ABV is 7.2%. Cloudy dark brown colour, big and creamy tan head. Very nice aroma of fruity American hops and oak, blackcurrants, marmelade, some vinous notes too. The mouthfeel is first soft and creamy and the flavour is first fruity smooth and alluring, then a treacherous and distinct hoppy bitterness sets in, accompanied by oaky and smoky notes. Very bitter aftertaste. An ""arrogant"" beer, perhaps - but not quite as arrogant as I feared. I am worthy!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,LeRose,4.18,"Reviewed from notes.  Pours a reddish brown from the 22 ounce bottle, excellent clarity. Off white, foamy head that was generous and lasted for a time before reducing to a nice, foamy cap.  The smell is not as aggressive as anticipated. I get a sweet impression - caramel/toffee and sweet dark fruits - raisin/fig maybe date. There's enough resinous pine to give a promise of a hefty bitterness, but there are also softer floral notes, an earthiness, a very slight citrus zest. The malts weigh in with biscuits and toast. Spicy like cloves.  The taste delivers on what's promised by the smell. Caramel and toffee lead followed by sweet dark fruit. This rides on the back of the toast and biscuit flavors. Then other flavors come along - a woodiness from the oak, floral, earthy, definite citrus zest resembling orange, and big but not unpleasant sharp bitterness. No sign of the ABV whatsoever. While it could be jagged, everything comes together for a smooth experience.  Everything lingers into the aftertaste. It's got a nice, sticky feel without being overly cloying. Carbonation seems medium and appropriate for this beer. Smooth and creamy. Oddly the beer ""feels good"".  Overall, this was a smooth-drinking flavor bomb. Layered and integrated very nicely even with the substantial kick of bitterness. Well done.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,mothmanscott,4.34,"From notes 1/25/12: Pours a rich but murky brown with a reddish tint. Develops a 1.5 inch, frothy, tan, moderately lasting head that leaves nice clumpy lacing. Aroma is resinous pine hops, oaky vanilla, dark malt roast and a hint of toffee. Taste is piney hops up front and woody vanilla with hints of toffee and caramel. The ""oaking"" process does something that greatly subdues the fig, prune, molasses bread and fruitcake flavors found in Arrogant Bastard original. Starts hoppy and bittersweet but immediately increases in bitterness to finish dry and quite bitter. The bitterness lingers long in the aftertaste.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,q33jeff,2.86,"** 06/01/2013  Aroma is pure hops and barley. Dark copper color, but translucent. Small white head. Thin feel. Low carbonation. A bit too strong and bitter, though I think the oaked version of this beer us a touch smoother than the original. Some good flavors, but all over the place. The pieces don’t come together here.  **",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,ChrisCage,4.6,"A- Probably the best write up anyone will come across on a beer bottle haha!! This pours with a great caramel colored head that is dense, starts off about a finger thick and has awesome retention. The beverage itself is muddied, brown and with plenty of visible suspended yeast particulate. The carbonation seems to be plentiful and smooth. As for lacing, it is really nice, with lots of small circular clumps of foam stickily hanging on to the side of the glass.  S- First impression.....wood chips, and of campfire! Beyond this there is vanilla, slight coffee and chocolate notes, some dense dried apple, caramel and toffee sweet malts and the finish is rummy sweet yet bitter from the hops....a very nice balancing act between rich & malty, oak, and bitter.  T- The flavors follow suit to the aromas, with the richness of the rum coming through very well....almost liqueur like. I am getting beautiful caramel/toffee sweetness, vanilla, oak cask, some campfire smoke. The bulk of the beer is yeasty, bread like, of cream, nuttiness.....just a full spectrum of balanced goodness!  M/O- Mouthfeel is creamy medium/full bodied, and the carbonation is about as smooth as one can get! I give this full marks for drinkability and I'd love nothing more than to enjoy more than one of these delectable Ales.....the alcohol is so well hidden you don't even know there is any.....what a delight to drink! Simply awesome and worthy of being one of my favorite beers!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Stooven,3.3,"Poiyrs an interesting red hue. Oak is very slight. Unexpectedly, the hops are much more biting and bitter than standard ABA, which is one of my faves. So this is a lket down, and confoundingly less flavorful.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,stevoj,4.01,"Bitterness and smokiness, nice and easy to drink. Dark amber/ brown, aroma of wood chips, peat, Taste is mildly sweet up front, with bitterness on the backside.. High ABV masked by the smoky bitterness.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,davidperez,4.19,"Served in a snifter, it pours a clear copper with ruby glare, no head formed in this one.  The bouquet is of caramel, vanilla, butterscotch, a hint of cherry and raisin, spicy hoppiness, and a very slight presence of oak. Of the Arrogant Bastard family this is the one with the most shy bouquet, though it is still assertive.  This is by far the most subtle of the Bastards. That aggressiveness in the flavors is not present here, and the sweet and bitter spikes also lack. That is not say that this beer is flavorless or dull, at all. Upfront you get humble sweet notes of caramel, malts and booze. Almost at the same time, a subdued bitter note enters, and it quickly gains prominence until it overcomes completely that initial sweetness and it becomes clear that it is oak what we are talking about. A raw wood flavor. The aftertaste is mostly bitter with that same oak note. A subdued vanilla note is present all throughout. This Bastard leaves your palate coated in a pleasant bitterness and a subdued sweetness. Medium body, slightly silky and smooth.  Excellent beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,blackcompg,3.91,"Appearance - pours quick 2 fingers of creamy khaki head, body is a slightly hazed deep amber color, constant particulates and carb rise within the body, prominent webbed lacing coats the glass after quaffing.  Smell - starts with rich dark toffee, dark ripe fruit of mostly plum and fig, hint of sweet citrus, and whiff of vanilla and carmel.  Taste - not what I expected! Starts with strong herbal hops and strong oak, hops are nearly astringent, flavors of basil and even a hint of dried mint leaf, oak is very woody and wet, there are just hints of the sweet plum and dark toffee struggling in the background, but darkened toffee quickly comes forward with a light roastiness that joins the herbal hops and oak. Finish is strong oak and herbal hops that nearly pucker.  Mouthfeel - nearly medium, as carb is definitely on the lower side allowing the oak and herbs to dominate the palate. Very smooth and almost creamy, but the hop and oak assault make you think otherwise. Astringent finish.  Overall - i love arrogant bastard and double bastard - and this one is good too, but I want to try another bottle to make sure. I do enjoy this beer, quite a bit, but the bastard caught me off guard with the intensity of hops and barrel - not a bad thing, I'm enjoying it for sure, but want one more just for comparison. Buy it if you can, make sure it is fresh, mine was at 4 months, and will try again fresh.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,Pegasus,4.5,"Appearance: Deep clear dark amber with a moderate, slightly coarse off-white head, withthin lacing, which leaves irregular tidemarks.  Aroma: Prominent notes of sweet malt, somewhat earthy and herbal hops and prominent oak notes. There is a prominent undercurrent of sweet and spicy alcohol.  Taste: Opens with strong toasted and caramel malts, soon followed by strong herbal hops and sweet alcohol. The oak barrels contribute prominent and strong earthy, wood-infused flavors. The sweet alcohol lingers throughout, and along with the oak, forms the backbone of the taste. Finishes with a persistent, lingering earthy hop note.  Mouth feel: Smooth and full, very soft, with faint carbonation.  Drinkability/notes: A rich and elegant beer, to be consumed with reverence.  Presentation: Packaged in a twenty-two ounce brown glass bomber with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,kalosjakar,3.93,"Sampling one day before fresh by 1/7/16  I would call it burgundy with a red shine when putting the glass up to the light.  The smell does remind me of the original but the oak completes it.  On the taste, in my opinion the oak does more harm than good for some reason. There is an off flavor I didn't experience with the original, so I can only assume its the oak.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,thehyperduck,4.27,"650 mL bottle included in the Bastard Box that hit LCBOs last month. Bottled Oct 8 2015 and best enjoyed by Jan 7 2016. Served slightly chilled.  Looks a lot like standard Bastard - foggy copper-amber hue with brick red highlights, and equipped with a nearly one-inch crown of creamy, buff-coloured head. Great retention; it lasts the better part of ten minutes before receding completely, coating the glass with a messy layer of lacing as it steadily creeps ever downward. A lumpy cap and generous collar survive afterwards. Looks perfect to me, but the aroma is comparatively humble - light notes of buttery oak and vanilla come through, with the remainder being a toned-down derivative of the base beer. Bready, toasty malt and toffee/caramel sweetness, with additional notes of pine resin, citrus and dried orchard fruit.  This strong ale has a familiar backbone consisting of lightly toasted bready malts and toffee sweetness, combining with a hint of prune fruitiness. The hops rush in on the back end, providing that intense bitterness you've come to expect from this brand: oily pine resin and pithy grapefruit citrus. Finishes with floral notes, ethanol and woody oak chip flavours that dry the palate out almost completely, leaving an astringent feeling on the tongue. Medium-bodied, with middling carbonation levels that gently prickle the palate, resulting in a relatively soft, creamy mouthfeel.  Final Grade: 4.27, a high A-. Oaked Arrogant Bastard is more of a sideways step than a forward one - it's a very nice beer, but IMO I'm not sure if the oak chips really improved it much. The relentless resiny bitterness and bold grapefruit citrus flavours are still there, as is the equally-sturdy malt backbone. The oak chips serve mostly to dry the finish out considerably, playing mostly a supporting role in the flavour profile itself. I encourage everyone who enjoyed the standard Bastard to give this one a shot, as it's certainly a good variant on a rock-solid theme.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,StoutElk_92,4.42,"Pours mahogany red-brown, with a thick creamy khaki colored head. Smells like dark caramel, oak, vanilla, pineapple, coconut, fruity light citrus, and grassy hops. Tastes like bitter grapefruit, tangy orange citrus, burnt oak, caramelized brown sugar, with light grassy herbal hops. Feels light bodied with a creamy mouthfeel, mild carbonation. Overall a really good strong ale with oak.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,TriggerFingers,4.75,"If you have seen my review for AB...well here you go for the Oaked version (from the Bastard Box).  This is identical to AB in a lot of ways except for flavor. Seriously,a seasoned palate is best to break this one down. It is AB, but the tannins from the oak amplify the bitterness. But, wait! There is more! The char and oak contribute a level of smokiness and booziness (perhaps bourbon?) that meet the base recipe of AB that I am having trouble putting into words--at the very least, it is incredibly enjoyable. Any person who has cut their teeth on Bourbon or IPA's will appreciate the subtle complexities here.  Last Words: This is downright delicious! I still think AB is a better QPR, but the oak treatment here makes this a better beer. So smooth, so complex, and downright Arrogant.

Warm, veering towards a cloying richness but just not powerful enough to get there. Rich mouthfeel, muted carbonation, full body. Quite different from the rest of the AB family. This was... calm. Tasty, but not big, aggressive, intense, or anything else along those lines. The wood masked a lot of the hop presence and even some of the malt, without adding much itself.

But the Burton is 10% ABV and boozier. Both are great, and both are currently in my fridge. I've taken a few aside and aged them both. The Burton definitely ages better, in fact, I would say the Arrogant Bastard did not age well. Get it fresh and enjoy it for what it is, a no apology Oaked hop bomb.

147,8951,BillCheck,5,"This is the only beer I've given straight 5's for every category so I want to back it up with a review. The first time I had tried this I was completely blown away. The appearance is a great dark amber with about an inch of tan foamy head. Very inviting to say the least. This beer has the aroma of caramel/vanilla, malt, some citrus overtones and a hint of oak. At the first sip, the taste starts with a nice balance of sweet caramel malt with piney bitterness with a big oak finish that adds a certain sweetness. The oak taste is the best part in my opinion. The feel is smooth and not aggressive for the ABV with lower to moderate carbonation making this an easy drinker. Overall, probably my favorite beer out there.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,dcmchew,4.5,"Cloudy dark amber pour, two finger light beige head that recedes to a nice sticky lace and a bubbly cap floating on top. Boozy raisin, fig, date, faint black cherry, rich caramel and toffee, faint wood and vanilla, subtle citrus and pine. Smells nice. Taste surprises in the start with very bitter citrus (lots of grapefruit and unripe orange peel), throwing the hops straight to you face, but things turn around in a few seconds. Fruitiness develops for a bit, sweet with faint peach, tangerine, subtle dark grape, even some tropical notes (mango mostly), but is quickly cut short by caramel and burnt toffee (light maltiness tho), leading to a mostly bitter finish. Huge grassy hops, dried flower petals (perfumey and bitter), pine resin, with those oak chips bringing a dusty earthiness, a tree-bark kinda feel, quite rough and bitter also. Warm bitter finish doesn't leave much else to the aftertaste except a big concentrated leafy hoppiness. Medium body and carbonation, kinda chewy. It's nice that the oak chips enhance the hops, ergo the bitterness. A very rough beer that many people are probably not ready for, before being worthy. Aggressive, but rewarding.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

I have had the original ""Arrogant Bastard"" several times and I thought often that I much preferred the original to the ""oaked.""

Feel: Medium-light body, active, almost harsh carbonation.   Overall: I hate to say this but this ale is aggressive. This is not for everyone like the brewer said. Both hops and malts come full force and with the aggressive bitterness and also detectable alcohol bite. This beer will take your palate to a bar so it can purposely beat it with a stool.

Aroma: Sweet hops. Really great whiff of sugary malts… burnt caramel.  Taste: Hops: Started off pretty mild but finished with a kick. Herbal and floral… almost sour. Malts: Subtle sweet notes of caramel and molasses. Good notes up front but the hops take over in the finish. Notes: The oak is subtle but it really brought the hops and malts together. The malts are nearly absent in the standard version of this brew but it is smoother and more balanced in this version. The oak also hides the alcohol very well. Moderate-low carbonation. Dry finish.  Overall: The oak barrels did wonders for this brew. I would definitely reach for this version over the standard version.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Head decapitates slowly then stick with a slight foam above the beer.  S: Amazing hoppy smell with a backbone of oak with hints of vanilla, from the american oak wood chips. Definitely getting lots of hops in the forefront of the nose, followed by that backbone of vanilla, oak, slight bourbon characteristic, amazing smelling stuff.  T: Wow this is where the beer shines for me. It's no where near as bitter as Arrogant Bastard, probably because the beer has had time to mellow-out a little bit. The amber malts are not as present as they are in the original Arrogant Bastard but still there. Very nice hoppyness similar to a very well crafted IPA with a strong malt backbone. The oak chips impart a bourbon-like flavor adding bits of sweet with lots of vanilla.  M: Medium to full mouth-feel , unlike the base beer. Aging the beer in oak chips really did help to bring these amazing flavors out.  O: Highly recommended.

147,8951,leantom,4.2,"I've had this beer once before, but it's been a long time. Therefore, I decided to go to the store and pick it up in order to review it more accurately. Here goes:  A: Nice. Pours a dark amber; little light penetrates. If you pour it properly, you should get a nice head with good retention time.  S: Very nice. Has an oaky smell with lots of vanilla, probably from being aged in bourbon barrels. The base beer for this oaked-barrel-aged creation - Arrogant Bastard - has none of these smells. I really cannot detect the hop presence very well like for the regular Arrogant Bastard (you can smell the piney, resiny odor from the Cascade hops in the base beer).  T: Again, very nice. It's no where near as bitter as Arrogant Bastard, probably because the beer has had time to mellow-out in oak barrels. You really cannot taste the amber and darkened malts in this beer as well as you can taste them in Arrogant Bastard, but they're still apparent, especially on the back of the tongue as the beer goes down. Mild hope presence, but nothing heavy. The oak barrels impart a bourbony flavor, i.e., very sweet with lots of vanilla.  M: Very full-bodied and creamy, unlike the base beer. Aging the beer in oak barrels really did wonders on its flavor.  O: Highly recommended.

A thin layer rests on top with some sporadic lacing. This is a beautiful looking beer  The initial smell is oak and vanilla with the delicious scent of the bastard filling it out.  The idea to oak the arrogant was a fantastic idea. The taste follows the pattern of the smell with the oak taking center stage followed by the arrogant bastard. The finish is that Stone hoppy bitterness. My only...bone to pick...would be that hoppy bitterness at the end. I know hops are Stone's bread and butter and it's not the worst finish but I'm used to more of a smooth malty character with oak aged brews. That said it's not a bad finish. The aftertaste actually brings the two flavors together really well.  The mouthfeel was least favorite aspect as I felt it was quite on the thin side. Had it been just a bit on the thick side I'd be giving this a perfect score.  That said I didn't want to give my first rating here a perfect score out of principle.

The oak comes through with vanilla, citrus, grapefruit, orange peel and a herbal hoppiness all combining to make something truly spectacular.  T: Vanilla comes through strongly now with sharp piney hops and citrus breaking up the sweetness of both the vanilla and this insanely tasty caramel maltiness (really want to know the malt bill for this bad boy).  M: Probably the best thing about this beer. Don't know what it's like out of the bottle, but on tap, I have never experienced a hoppy beer like this to be so rich and full in it's mouthfeel.

147,8951,LambicPentameter,4.29,"Enjoyed out of a 12 oz brown bottle with Stone's classic silkscreen printing. Reviewing from notes after drinking on 3/5/14. And while I wasn't smart enough to write down the enjoy by date, I do remember that I was a good couple months ahead of it. Poured into a large 20 oz snifter glass.  Appearance - Pours a beautiful hue of burnt umber with some hints of maroon where the backlit sun pours through the glass. Atop the body sits a half-finger head of pillowy foam the color of toasted white bread. Retention is short-lived, settling to a mottling of film of inconsistent thickness, with some buildup against the side of the glass. Lacing is sparse, but definitely present.  Smell - A wonderful bouquet of hops--both earthy and rich as well as bright and citrusy--alongside pronounced notes of caramel, vanilla and toasted wood. The wood is reminiscent of some of the notes you get from bourbon or even chardonnay, but without the phenols that you get from used oak barrels. It's definitely pure aromatic timber that provides an added depth to regular Arrogant Bastard.  Taste - Certainly delivers on the promise of the nose. Sweet malt and caramel along with vanilla and some light tannin, but not to be outdone is the complementary lupulin presence. Again, pungent citrus and now some herbal freshness to compliment the sweeter profiles. Again, the oak provides a pleasant background characteristic that compliments the hops and malt. After each drink there is a semisweet bitterness, but faint.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Slightly bittersweet finish.  Overall, I think I prefer this one to the original AB. The oak adds a depth that makes it a really unique tasting beer, and the fact that it's unused wood instead of something like bourbon barrels makes it cleaner and less hot. Will definitely have to get some more of this excellent brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,lochef81,4.18,"As a fan of Arrogant Bastard I couldn't wait to try its oak aged uncle. It definitely did not dissappoint. This ale pours one of the sexiest deep rich mahogany colors that I have ever seen in a beer. There is a very slight off white head that gives way to a substantial film and a lot of thick Cream lacing. The aroma is rich and buttery with lots of malty sweet notes reminiscent of caramel, toffee, and vanilla. In addition there is the wonderful aroma of smoky oak and a little piney hops. This ale sips quite thick and syrupy, definitely on the high end of the medium bodied beers. It is not an ale meant to just slug back. For only a 7.2 abver it seems quite thick and full bodied. The flavor surpasses the nose in its rich deliciousness. It is sweet and malty and smoky and at the same time slightly bitter and surprisingly fresh tasting(at least for an aged ale. There are plenty of caramel and vanilla notes, highlighted by the deep richness of the oak and the slighly bitter notes of piney hops. It is sweet but not cloying and simultaneously bitter but not tongue numbing like many Stone offerings. This is truly a great beer. I don't know how Stone does it but they continue to impress me time and time again.

They certainly age this in oak for long enough, because the oak flavor is pretty strong, and quite excellent.

It looks pretty good, nice amber color and abundant bubbles make it look appealing and the foamy nature of the thin head is nice. Scents of brown sugar, molasses and maple up front, this mingles later with vanilla, oak and spicy, piney and cedar-like hop aromas. In the background is some faint citrus and overripe fruit. A nice, complex aroma, highlighting the malt, hops and oak quite nicely. Taste begins with a big hit of bitter hops, simply bitter without much flavor. This moves into more bitterness, backed by hints of caramel sweetness, a bit of oak in the background and bitter citrus pith and pine hop flavors. A bit of fruit in the background. The finish is dry, with bitter hop, mostly pine, but with some citrus pith and a bit of toasted malt. The aftertaste is bitter hops and toasted malt. A big, bold flavor, not as well balanced as the aroma, quite bitter, but not bad. The slight sweetness works with the bitter hops to make it quite drinkable, and the oak gives it some nice woodiness. Very good. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with low carbonation and a resinous feel. This makes it quite easy to drink, as it goes down smooth. Overall this is a good strong ale.

Smell: It's definitely fallen off, I feel. There's a caramel sweetness that, with oak, gives a maple syrup feel, I suppose. Spicy with a fair amount of hops, but the aroma's certainly not as impressive as it would be fresh.  Taste/feel: Solid sweetness at first, but then an equally solid and drying bitterness at the end. A nice caramel malt flavor on the front, a resinous bitter pine sort of finish with a bit of that oak -- just enough to add a bit of character. The mouthfeel is medium all-around and it makes the bitterness on the finish a bit harsh, so come prepared! It's not overbearing, but the bitterness seems a bit high for the amount of hops I'm tasting here, but again, it's past its prime.

The aroma has lots of caramel malt along with juicy sweet orange and grapefruit. Then the hops shine through of pine, resin, and some oak.  On the flavor, it starts off with a bitter blood orange, red grapefruit, and peel. It then hits with a round vanilla flavor. The oak adds a dimension throughout.  The caramel sweetness then hits and balances the beer. There is a big lasting bitterness in the end. It's almost peppery, but lots of resin, pine, earth, tea, earthiness, and wood chips.

Beer is a dark brown, translucent, and shot through with purple or red.  Vanilla notes immediately hit, with a massive dose of caramel malts and molasses, and finally some spicy dry hops.  Dry, earthy, spicy hops hit first, imparting bitterness but little flavor. This is followed by some flat caramel malts, with vanilla, oak, and brown sugar rounding out the back-end. Fairly complex profile; each sip is a little different.  Lively sting and bite give this an excellent balance to what is otherwise a relatively thin mouthfeel. Slight foaming.  This is a tasty beer, reminding me of a drier, spicier version of Brown Shugga or Burton Baton. Those beers are very hoppy, but with more hop flavor, whereas the hops here seem to be mostly about the bitterness. The flavor is a bit of a letdown after a really intriguing aroma. Letting it warm helps bring out the molasses and vanilla better.  Has an ""Enjoy By"" date a week from now. I would think an oaked strong ale would hold up to age well, other than the hops, so I find that curious.  Update: had it on tap, and it was even better. Very smooth, with nice vanilla and oak notes to complement the earthy hops. Malt profile was far less dominant.

I love this beer and the variations of it. The only one I don't seem to like is the pepper variations. But stone is spot on with this brew.

After pouring there was a large, fluffy, 3 finger head of creamy white. After settling a good head still remained with a constant carbonation that kept it bubbling. An impressive, thick lacing was left on the glass as it was emptied  S: Somewhat underwhelming smell, not overpowering and hard for me to pick up. I sensed a piney and citrusy aroma from the hops and a caramel malt note. The oak from the aging process was noticeable in the nose.  T: Wonderful citrus and sharp hop flavor is very up front. Some malt kicks in the back end. Hint of oak and bitterness. The malt and hop tend to balance out as you let it sit in your mouth. Great flavors, with a sneaky sweetness that lingers after you swallow.  M: Stays with you. A good aftertaste and hop resin. Very thick but smooth.  O: Very good beer.

The taste is a lot different from the Bastard taste that I am used to. I usually find them to be in your face (not in a bad way) but it looks like the oak and aging has really chilled this beast out. I still get the same ideas that I get from the regular Arrogant Bastard, but the oak aging has really changed it for the better in my opinion.  Instead of being an Arrogant Bastard with oak added, this guy really transformed into a mellow, but still very strong beer. Will be buying again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,MHJeff06,2.5,"This beer has a good reputation on here, but I have to disagree. I bought a 4-pack of this, and perhaps it was a bad batch, I'm not sure. This beer was the definition of unbalanced. If you like to be hop bombed, then you'll l probably like this. The beer then finishes with an unpleasant oaky finish, unlike the other oak aged beers I've tried.

Solid head retention as well.  Smell: Bold citrus notes with some sweetness and hints of vanilla and cinnamon.  Taste: The citrusy hops are up front, as with regular Bastard, but this is noticeably mellowed by the oak which imparts a nice note of vanilla, cinnamon and very subtle oakiness. I only wish those notes were slightly more pronounced. The signature bitter Bastard finish is still there and in force.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly crisp, but it doesn't sacrifice the body. Well carbonated and the carbonation lasts.  Overall: An absolutely excellent tweak to an already excellent beer. When I'm in the mood for Arrogant Bastard I'll definitely be going oaked from now on.

The sweetness is from the rich malts, brown sugar, dark honey, clover, and caramel. Hops come in with bitter pine and some citrus.  T - Phenomenal taste of sweet caramel, brown sugar, honey and clover. A nice hop bite helps to balance it out. Bitter pine and bright citrus notes of grapefruit.

It sure looks good in the glass though. The smell is all hops and oak. Piney with some citrus undertones, the oak is there stronger than most other oaked beers that I've had. Tastes like an Imperial IPA, strong upfront hops that resound with resiny pines and sour citrus, not unlike most other Stone products that I've tried. The oak is very pronounced, almost fighting with the hops for dominance. The first couple sips are almost unsettling and I'm not really sold on this one. As I finish, I have grown more acclimated to the flavors, but a little underwhelmed. Carbonation is light and the finish seems pretty dry.

Slightly muddled clarity and some micro bubbles nucleating at the bottom of the glass. Just a thin layer of rapidly dissolving khaki trim across the top. Little to no cling or stick left behind.  S: Smells of toasted breads with some spicy hops and a bit of earthy oak wood character. There is a light malt sweetness coming through in the aroma and a touch of alcohol noted.  T: Tastes bready as well with lots of toasted grain notes and a dried fruit blend of fig and raisin. I get some mild citrus peel and spices with some noticeable woodsy elements. There is a high hop bitterness met with some oaky tannins that really dries out the palate. Not a negative for me. The finish is a touch dank and herbal with a light alcohol kick. Really nice and restrained wood character from the oak chips. Seems to play well with the base beer.  M: Moderate weight with a fairly smooth texture overall. Big dry puckering bitterness and slightly tannic. Clean on the finish with some light warming alcohol.  D: This is a very nice complement to the base beer.

Two fingers of creamy, root beer-looking head. Great retention. A full, beautiful lace.  The scents aren't overwhelming, more lagerish than ale-like. What you get is caramel malts and roasty grains and smoke.  The charred oak and hops dominate. There's little resembling American hops, mostly it's similar to savory Noble hops. Caramel is present early on, but is quickly overtaken by the hops and char. Only as the beer warms do you notice a pinch of citrus.  Tastes more like a strong pale ale or even an IPA. The bitterness is high in this bastard. Early on you get caramel sweetness. However, bitter quickly settles in and lasts well into the swallow and just lingers. It's a dry, acidic finish, yet it leaves your mouth watering, waiting for the next sip.  Overall, it's a beer that could be enjoyed by guys who like lagers and even hopheads. The beer is superior as it warms compared to right after you pop the top. It goes down like an IPA, you get used to it after the first couple sips, then it's really smooth.

I was already amazed just by the description on the bottle, which has to be one of the most eloquent, poignant, and meaningful things I've ever read, and a very true summary of what this beer ia all about. And it also left me feeling like a beer bottle just basically summed up the core of my ideal life philosophy. Haha, leave it to Stone. After reading the bottle's miniature essay, I poured it, at cellar temperature, into my snifter.  It's got a DENSE, billowy, light tan two-finger head that's quite slow to subside. And it has the same deep dark red hue as the standard Bastard, but cloudier.  The smell is just like the original, but with an additional vanilla aroma that blends in ridiculously pleasantly with everything else. Some obscure, cryptic dark fruit scent is also standing out more. VERY nice.  Now to detail the marvelous journey that a single sip takes me on. At first there is a tart vanilla sweetness, but then it turns a smoky, leathery taste which I assume comes from those oak chips. Then THAT turns to a resiny bitterness that makes me feel like I've been chewing on a mouthful of leaves and spruce needles. This is where the hop flavor comes out. As if all this wasn't enough, long into the finish, a little caramel makes a surprising cameo. These are the flavors I initially picked up on, but once I got close to finishing the bottle, I could swear there was a taste of prunes somewhere in the middle of the experience too. Astounding complexity!  The viscosity and carbonation are pretty much the same as the original's, and the original's were excellent.  It's almost like a toned-down barley wine in some ways. It kind of makes me think of Arctic Devil, but with hoppy bitterness epmphasized more than sweetness. However, the truth is that this oaked version of Arrogant Bastard is unlike anything else I've ever tasted, and the standard cersion was ALREADY incredibly unique and awesome. A terrific twist which has created a beer that bends the dimensions to its will with its unreal complexities.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,jazzyjeff13,4.19,"A 12oz bottle with a BB of July 2013. Acquired recently from Trembling Madness in York. If the cap is to be believed then this ale is 'Hated by many, loved by few'. Sounds awesome!  Poured into a Duvel tulip. A rich ruby-red hue with good clarity and satisfying carbonation. Produces a large head of creamy off-white foam that lasts for a while before subsiding to a thick surface layer. Some lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt and intense hop notes. Hints of biscuits, grain, caramel/toffee, brown sugar, pine resin, subtle oak, mild vanilla, earthy yeast and stewed hops. Complex and overwhelming.  Tastes of powerful aromatic hops underpinned by a rich, malty backbone and finishing with a will-sapping bitterness. Notes of extreme pine resin, caramel, roasted malt, grain, brown sugar, oak/wood, earthy yeast and stewed hops. Highly astringent, with a fervent bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and spicy, with pleasant carbonation and a thick, velvety body. The hop oils stimulate the palate and lend it a mouth-puckering dryness. Aftertaste of pungent aromatic pine, bitterness and caramel malt.  Wow - a tsunami of flavour washes over your tastebuds. Worthy of it's name! It looks good, while the aroma and flavour are stunning. Tons of pine-laden hops and sweet malt, with the booze very well hidden. The hop character lacks depth, but who cares when it's this good? The oak chips are quite subtle but lend a woody dimension with a whiff of vanilla. Body is silky smooth. A top-notch effort; once again Stone school other brewers in how to go nuts with hops. Well worth sampling if you have the chance to try it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Smurf2055,3.66,"Pours dark copper with minimal head.  Smell is mild citrus and maybe a bit of cinnamon.  Taste is hoppy, bitter, and some really good woody citrus going on.

147,8951,Act25,4.6,"12 oz poured into a Spaten .5l cylinder.  This Strong Ale has more than it's fair share of flavor. A must try.  A - Beautiful mahogany, ruby, red-brown. Much darker than amber. Tan, deep, dense finger of head, which lasts and laces in a picture perfect arc around the glass. Near perfect look. Devilish color, dark but clear. Well carbonated. A looker.  S - Like the un-oaked version... A stunner! Completely superior to every other strong ale I have tried. First, it's hoppier than malty, followed by biscuit, fruit, raisin, earth, dirt . THE OAKED has a bit more barnyard, forest, spring earth. Hints of citrus peel. Esters and alcohol as expected in 7.2% ABV. Complex meditation beer, without being strange or wobbly.  T- Unlike Scottish or strong ales, there's more of a double IPA feel. Roasty maltiness first, followed by a wash of bitter hops to complete the arc. More of a strong, deep, sweet DOUBLE IPA. IPA drinkers will like this, the hop finish lingers and is powerful and leaves your mouth content. Leaves you in a great, warm, contented place. A little more salty sea, moist, and even chewy, woody flavors than the un-oaked. No Kidding. A little more strangeness but in a good way.  It finishes sweet, with caramel, coffee, chocolate, and toffee, and sweet grass... Which plays balance with the hop bitterness. Without any cloying or over done sweetness, tho, it's woody and nutty all the way. This is my 2nd taste of a perfectly balanced Strong Ale. (the first being Stone's unoaked version). This is a favorite.  M - Full bodied, well carbonated. Nicely balanced, great finish. Leaves your mouth in a great place, great finish to the evening. Wet & oily from hops. This is a kissing beer, wakes your mouth up, makes you want to make out.  O - STONE is a peak beer experience, Arrogant Bastard is the one to take if you get banished to the moon.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,superspak,4.1,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 8/12/2013. Pours crystal clear ruby red color with a nice 2 finger dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, nuttiness, raisin, oak, floral, light pine, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and oak notes with moderate hop presence. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, pine resin, orange zest, floral, oak, clove, and floral earthiness. Large resinous pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, pine, oak, clove, nuttiness, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of malt flavors; with the big pine and oak bitterness overshadowing the malts; and a fair amount of cloying bitterness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and very sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent strong ale. Very nice balance and complexity of flavors; and quite smooth to sip on, even with the huge bitterness. A very enjoyable offering.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,BradtheGreat7,4.34,"Review taken from notes May 2013 though I've had this many times before.  12 oz brown bottle with the usual Arrogant bastard artwork that is uber BA if you ask me. This bottle like all stone bottlings screams quality. Poured 2 of these into a nonic pint glass.  A - dark amberish color with hints of burnt orange highlights when held to the light. Some real haze going on. Head was a bit smaller than its brother Arrogant Bastard but still held a pretty good ring of creamy lace with some stick.  S - not as hop forward as the standard bottling of ABA but still a fine aroma. Some pine resin and a good bit of spice from the hops. The faintest of citrus and I mean its faint. Big waft of caramel malt and a slight vanilla from the oakiness. A good fresh cut wood character to the aroma.  T - well done. It has its portion of hops getting their point across but the malt does its part as well. The original ABA is a beer that displays both worlds in a balanced act of class and this is no different. All the same flavors I love plus the additional benefit of being Oaked. Hops are big and resinous with pine and soft citrus while the malt plays an equal part with somewhat sweet caramel malt that's only amplified by the oakiness. An awesome vanilla note that hits and then hits again with a wood character all over. Spicy, earthy finish. This is one great tasting brew.  M - thick mouthfeel with a good solid coating of texture. Really flavorful throughout and a real beer drinkers kind of ale. Thick and almost creamy smooth going down. One of the most enjoyable that'll ever grace your taste buds.  O - ABA is a work of art and this is just another piece in that gallery of fine Bastard ales. My wife says I'm an arrogant bastard and maybe that's why I like these so much though I think it's more to its in your face flavor that does that. One things for sure I can't get enough Liquid arrogance and Oaked Bastard instantly became an all time favorite for me. Whether its beside the camp fire in mid summer or the fire place on a cold winter night Oaked Bastard seems to find my glass at some point. If you like AB then this is a no brainer. If you don't, well like the bottle says: It's probably not for you anyway.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,karengarys,3.88,"This pours crystal clear mahogany leaving a nice medium-coarse beige head that, over time, turns to a creamy puff.  For this review I am making notes after it has warmed a bit. When it was refrigerator cold, to me it was average-ish. good. but beer. As it has warmed, some really neat stuff is happening, and making it much more interesting.  Smell is a nice balance of hoppy and malty. It seems to be somewhat floral like,  Taste is all out beer, but the hilights are smooth pine, maybe cinnamon and an undertone of citrus, maybe grapefruit peel. There is a bitter aspirin snap that comes along, I don't care for that, but it is not forward. Maybe a hint cinnamon or licorice?  Mouthfeel is super creamy.  Finish has a bitter but not ugly bitter good-bye. It does linger with bitter for a bit.  Well, this is very good. I recommend giving this a try. It didn't, to me, stand out as something I'd go very far out of my way to seek out. It is good, though, and if it is looking at you, and there are no other good choices at the time, this will definitely come through as a worthwhile drink.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,GorillaMedic,3.94,"I really liked the Arrogant Bastard Ale, so I was intrigued by the ""oaked"" variation here. In my opinion, overall, its not as good. A - Pleasing dark amber colour. Almost red, like a wine. I was surprised at how dark it is. Moderate head. S - Like other reviewers, I think the smell is pretty good. Distinct pine needle aroma of the hops but not overwhelming; a slightly nutty flavor with a sweet fruity aroma wafting through. T - Starts with a bit of a subdued bitterness (not in your face hoppiness like some of their other beers) that is quickly passed by an intriguing sweet fruit flavor. Finishes with a nice astringent bitterness. Good but not amazing and for some reason doesn't taste as balanced to me. M - Smooth, moderate carbonation, pretty good. O - Not an ""amazing"" beer but not horrible. If you don't like Arrogant Bastard Ale or Stone Brewing's overall style, you won't like this. If you do, its worth a try—I think it is pretty good.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,zeledonia,2.79,"I'll preface this by saying that I don't really like the Arrogant Bastard variations that I've had (regular and double). But I'm giving oak a try anyway. Tasted 19 June 2013, reviewed from notes.  Pours a pleasing mostly clear deep slightly reddish amber. Half-finger of orange-tan head, decent retention, okay lacing. Fine.  Smell is the best part of this beer, for sure. Comes through oaky, musty sweet, and deep. Like sniffing fruit (peaches, apricots) in a moist earthen wine cellar. Vanilla oak, stone fruit, and maybe a little mold. Quite nice, actually.  Taste has, unfortunately, most of what makes me dislike regular and double bastard. It's powerfully bitter in an acrid, unenjoyable way. Like aspirin crossed with onions. The first third is okay, deeply malty and semi-sweet, like a low-level doppelbock or something. But then the bitter kicks in, and the only thing that saves this from being a drainpour is the faintest hint of balance provided by the sweetness and fruit (which struggles to break through the surface).  Feel is fine. Medium-bodied, carbonation right where it should be. Lasting, which could be good, but in this case I want it to fade out more quickly.  I might finish this bottle. I might not. But I will definitely not be drinking another one. Whatever hops they put in this beer, however they add them, it doesn't agree with me. Turns out an oaky version of a beer I don't like is still a beer I don't like.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Resin, pine, and grapefruit open the aroma, with fresh cut grass and slightly dank cannabis rounding out the hop profile. There's some caramel malt sweetness buried in there somewhere, along with toasty oak. Notes of dark fruits...raisins, prunes, and figs, emerge.  Flavor is a juxtaposition of sweet and bitter. There's an initial promise of bitterness, which the malt overcomes mid palate, but resiny, herbal hops take back the profile in the finish. Grapefruit, tea, fresh cut grass, resin, burnt caramel, and oak are on the laundry list of flavor notes. Lightly burnt toast flavors emerge as it warms.  Body is fairly full, with moderate carbonation and light alcohol warmth. They'd a bit of hop astringency present.  Great, complex beer.

Dark cherry, blackberry, raspberry. Abrasive hop bitterness and citrus rounds things out. A little astringent.  Mouthfeel is mostly dry. Medium body. Slightly creamy. Low-medium carbonation.

147,8951,BeerDocT,4.22,"Been wanting to try this one for ages. Spotted a four pack at my local Total Wine and could not pass it up.  Appearance 4.0: Pours out a deep, dark amber color. Very little head, but after the pour, unusual spotty foam started popping up. Very attractive.  Smell 3.75: Nice bouquet. Lots of barley malt biscuit malt and a distinctive, pleasant and subdued pine aroma. All up-front and a very nice accompaniment to each and every sip. I do not, however, detect any wood notes.  Taste 4.50: Front is somewhat dry, but the alkaline taste of the hops is very noticeable. Middle is somewhat sweet and malty with more hops detectable. Finish is wonderful with heavy malt and hops intermingling once again with an emphasis on hop flavors. Chinook hops. Unmistakable. Also, this is where I first noticed a resiny, oak taste. Finish is of medium length with more of the hops and a very slight vanilla taste, probably the result of the oak.  Mouthfeel: 3.75: CO2 carbonation was good, but there is a noticeable burning in the mouth while drinking this beer which may turn off some tasters (not me!).  Overall 4.50: Excellent brew. The addition of the oak has transformed an already wonderful brew into something on another level. I know my score does not reflect a true average of the different component scores, but the taste of this beer has to be experienced in order to be fully appreciated. Recommended.

After a while in the glass the chill haze subsides and the beer clears up. The aroma is pretty muted, the hops may have faded at this point. Its malty with notes of caramel and some woody-vanilla hints. The taste is not as assertive as regular AB. I'm wondering if the oaking mellowed it out a little bit, or if it was the age of the beer. Its a relatively chewy malt bomb. Toffee, bready, caramel and oak are the predominate flavor profiles. The body is medium-thick but not syrupy. There is a slight tannin finish to the beer, presumably from the oaking. I like this beer but I'm not a fan of the tannins.

147,8951,TheCondor,4.25,"After having had Arrogant Bastard (and loving it), I was excited about trying the Oaked version of this fantastic brew. Side poured with standard vigor from the 12oz bottle into my Boulevard glass, co-sponsored by the KC Royals. 1st Place in the AL Central, in case you didn't know. While I write, its' snowing in KC, making me want to go to Stone Brewery and relax in 75 degree weather.  Appearance - Pours a beautiful deep ruby red color with a nice one finger that dissipates slowly and leaves excellent lacing. Very impressive presentation on this brew, and of course Stone kills it on the packaging. Always a pleasure.  Smell - Malty sweetness is certainly strong, with a bit of hop character. A hint of the oak can be detected, as well as some spiciness and booze. A fairly complex nose, albeit not very strong.  Taste - What the nose lacks, the taste makes up for. The oak is certainly prevalent, with a nice malty spicy sweetness making up the majority of the drink. There is a little hop character in there as well.  Mouthfeel - This is one of my favorite parts of this brew, in that it is so smooth and you get a touch of the alcohol at the end. Nothing overwhelming, but it is there, and I like that. It doesn't let you forget you are drinking alcohol. Leaves a nice, smooth, sweet taste on the palate. I would say it is a medium-heavy beer.  Overall - While I did not like this beer to the extent I like the standard Arrogant Bastard, it is still an excellent beer no doubt. I would highly recommend it, although I would also recommend you drink the original first for a control group (comparison purposes).

I get a touch of caramel, leather, and tobacco in this beer as well.  T: It starts out sweet with malt and caramel. As it moves to the middle I get vanilla, spice, caramel, and leather in there. It's also a touch earth (dirt and leaves). That may not seem appealing, but it is nice. The back end brings on the booze along with more caramel and vanilla.  M: Full bodied beer. Sweet and spice envelop the palate right away. It's hefty but it's overly sticky or chewy. Nothing too lingering after the beer is gone.  O: Very good beer.

A solid maltiness with a touch of sweetness as it finishes. The strong 7.2 ABV is hidden very well.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is solid with the taste going all over the mouth. This beer has a slick sort of feel. The carbonation is good and the body is sizable for the style.  Overall: I do like the oak treatment the they added to Arrogant Bastard.

Bought a 4-pack and got it for my friends b-day. I thought it would be cool for us to share a beer together. This is my first review, here we go!  A-The beer looks flawless and the bottle is incredibly cool and funny. Has a pretty large, tan colored head and it seems like it stays forever. The beer is a deep copper color, almost amber. looks great.  S- Smells different. You can really smell the oaked and wood flavoring and it is for sure the strongest and primary smell. There might be some sort of citrus thing going on too from what I remember as well as the hops. Might be some sort of bready sent going on. Not to bad, but once again, mainly oak and wood.  T- Wow! The taste is pretty much like as my friend put it, ""Like drinking a liquefied tree!"" There is a heavy wood presence here. Not a lot of booze taste here, which is good. Hops are noticed here, but not overly powerful. The taste finishes dry, but not too dry. The taste lingers for a very long time afterwards. Even after chewing a stick of gum, I was still able to feel it on my mouth. Overall, a very aggressive and strong taste, but I don't mind.  M- Not a whole lot of carbonation, which is a good thing. Most beers are too carbonated and it takes away from the other qualities of the beer. The mouthfeel is heavy without a doubt. Like I said before, the taste stays with you for a very long time.  O- A very big and bold beer. Tastes very different and unique in a good way. I have never had anything like that before. My friend couldn't stand it because he said it was like drinking a tree. While he was right, it's not necessarily a bad thing.

147,8951,thecheapies,4.19,"Gorgeous-looking beer. Dark red-mahogany color with a fluffy bone head of dense sticky foam. Lacing is amazing and thick. Retention is ridiculous.  Toffee malts, American oak, some booze, grapefruit and sappy hops, mild raisin. Nice.  The oak is huge. Super woody and dry and piney, which develops the hop profile even more. The flavors are just... massive. A step-up from regular Arrogant Bastard. Elements of the floral and the citrus compete with the big oak and toffee breadiness. Very enjoyable.  Dextrinous and chewy. Medium-big in body. Lots of trapped bubbles exploding upon drinking. Busy.  Very good strong ale. Better than Double Bastard, in my opinion.

Smells like strong woody oak, searing piney hops, and lots of sweet malt.  The taste is similar. They really capture the earthy smoky oak flavor in this one very nicely, it's like sucking on an oak tree covered in lupulin. It's quite hoppy, as imagined, with lots of grapefruit and pine, but the oak aging smooths the flavors out considerably and makes them more palatable. There's some sweet malt and vanilla flavors in the background.  Medium bodied, crisp, dry mouthfeel, a slow sipper.

T - Starts fresh and malty with loads of herbal notes, slightly floral. Then a citrusy bitterness kicks your tongue, blending nicely with some wooden character and phenolic spiciness to linger forever. M - Very smooth. Carbonation is spot on.

S: Strong smell of hops, but also some sweetness and a bit of a caramel aroma. The hops are the strongest smell, but some complexity in the aroma.  T: Very strong hops and bitterness powers this one from start to finish. Tastes a lot like an IPA. The oak really only comes in at the end, but is a nice touch. The bitterness is really what lingers here, though.  M: Good mouthfeel. Smooth, with some tingle from the carbonation.  O: This is a nice beer, though one has to really enjoy IPA-type hoppiness and bitterness to like it. The oak adds some complexity to the taste.

The taste is actually quite different from the standard ABA. This time, sweetness, biterness, and oakiness dominate, with just a bit of pine at the end. The mouth is also quite similar to the original Bastard. Smooth, yet leaves the biterness lingering. Overall, I'm won over.

The taste is sort of flat and undefined upfront but this gives way to a strongly overpowering bitter oak profile. This isn't all that different from chewing on tree bark. Even has that sort of medicinal bitter pine flavor on the tongue minutes after the sip. Almost feels like whatever little balance was present in the original has now been sapped out.  Well, I don't care for the taste but it has some things going for it - the appearance and mouthfeel do win it some points. Unfortunately these pale in comparison to the taste for me.

Did a side-by-side comparison with this oak aged version and the regular Arrogant Bastard, so this will be a review and comparative analysis.  A- Pours a hazy ruby with a thick, cream color head. Absolutely beautiful beer. Fantastic lacing. Color seems to be slightly lighter than the AB, but tough to see a difference there. Slightly less pronounced head as well, but to be expected after being put through the aging process. Just about a finger.  S- Wow. Here is where we start to see the separation from the regular AB. Aroma has some similarities to the reg AB with some floral hop and pine notes, but the oak aged version takes it to another level with the oak presence. Sweeter, maltier smell with earthy hints of wood and vanilla. More pungent that reg AB. Absolutely delicious smelling!  T- Glorious. Citrus hops up front, but less pronounced than reg AB. Biscuit flavors. Sweet malty base. Swirl of flavors taking place. Takes you on an extra twist from reg AB as the oak backbone of this beer takes over. Notes of brown sugar, molasses, vanilla. Did Stone actually find a way to make this beer smoother? I think so. Oak creates a smooth finish of a terrific scotch. Very little bitterness. Touch of alcohol, but well hidden. Not overpowering.  M- mid body. Velvety smooth as it coats your mouth. Good carbonation remains. Very similar to reg AB  O- to my delight, it actually found a way to top the regular bastard. The oak backbone really takes over and takes this beer on a nice ride to another level. Hops are less of a highlight with this one, but the balance is just amazing.

Maroon or chestnut color would be a better description. About one finger thick light tan colored head that stays for only some time. Decent lacing on the sides. Some minor bubbles.  Aroma is a mix of toasty malts, resinous hops and very very slight wood. Some very vague vanilla comes through in the nose as well. Overall strength is mild. Oak aging via chips has resulted in a subdued aroma as far as oak, wooden and vanilla fragrances are concerned. Hop aroma is not strong either. Drinks like an old ale. Alcohol does not come through.  Flavor is again very subdued. Very malt forward and strictly less hops than in its non-oaked counterpart. Slight bitterness in the finish. Caramel and toasted malts along with resinous and piney hops.  Mouth feel is medium bodied. Moderate to low carbonation. Drinks very easy and smooth.

On the back label it gives the definition of arrogance, a small but arrogant description of the beer, a small but arrogant back story on beer, web info, and states “The Arrogant Bastard Wood. Would You?”! Cap states “Arrogant Bastard Ale”.  Appearance: After allowing this to warm for 10min I poured AB out of its 12oz bottle into a 16oz snifter. Pours out a deep brownish red that is very cloudy and has a 1 ½ finger cream colored head of a medium to thick density. Lacing is phenomenal! Heading retention is excellent lasting 7min 30sec before fading to a thick coating a ring.  Smell/Aroma: Aroma is amazing. A floral herbal scent hits the nose right off start with a strong citrus hop scent rising through next. A nice oak backbone is detectable the entire time. Phenomenal!!!  Flavor/Taste: A strong pine hop bitterness is tasted first followed directly by a sweet but bitter grapefruit taste. A roasted malt backbone comes through on the finish. Really great!!! All this rest atop an oak backbone.  MouthFeel/Drinkability: On the thicker side of medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and average carbonation. Extremely drinkable!!!!  Overall/Comments: Wow!!!

Has a little bit of that extra translucence that comes with macro-production, but the deep amber coloring is gorgeous and the head and retention is perfect.

A wonderful amount of wood (though I'd take a touch more), and very well balanced to boot. An improvement of the Arrogant Bastard.  Could go for a bit more hoppy crispness in the mouthfeel, but it's damn solid none the less. Just a touch more mellow than desired, particularly for a 'wood-chipped' beer. This is, in my opinion, the only quality of the beer that is inferior to the original AB.  Overall, a wonderfully accessible, albeit entry-level wood-affected beer.

147,8951,portia99,4.35,"12oz bottle from the first bottling of this (at least that made it to Massachusetts...by my rough calculations, this has been in the cellar from 2004) poured into an Old Guardian glass. Lets see how this has held up.  A - Bottle opens with a nice firm crack of carbonation. Pours a bit muddy and dirty and with a bit of a darker brown color. A finger cap of a tan foam lingers for a minute or so and leaves behind a thick and foamy collar around the edge of the glass.  S - Rich caramel up front, a touch of oak, molasses, hint of burnt sugar and faint vanilla. Not much left for any hops...after 8 years - not surprised. This give the impression of being a nice barleywine.  T - Somewhat mellow..and perhaps not quite as arrogant. This is very smooth. Woody oak is prominant on the first sip and lingers from start to finish. Layered heavily with various sweet and malty flavors - caramel, toffee, brown sugar. Surprisingly crisp hop bitterness as well. Vanilla and burnt sugar slightly reminiscient of creme brulee. Everything works very well together...there are no hard edges here...goes down super easy.  M - Very smooth, velvety, creamy. Body is medium. Carbonation is medium/low with a foaminess and creaminess about it. Gives a sweeter impression, but overall balance is excellent. Woody aspects and clean hop bitterness play off the sugary flavors quite well. Alcohol is not at all evident.  O - Having been an Arrogant Bastard fan from day 1, I recall being very excited when this oaked version hit store shelves. I also remember being shocked by the $18/6pk price but buying it anyway. Sadly, I recall not being at all impressed by this beer fresh, finding it quite harsh and not very enjoyable...hence a primary reason this has been sitting quietly in my cellar for 8 years. So, when I stumbled upon this bottle I figured it was as good a time as any to give it another try. What I find now is a truly excellent beer that has held up very well and improved greatly with age. The balance here is just about perfect and the flavors have mellowed a bit and blended together to create a beer that truly surprised me.

With superb lacing, Probably even nicer than Duvel.  S: Didn't really examine the smell. But I could get a nice clean hop note.  T: Nice bitter, not too overpowering. Bitterness just about right. Nice hops note. Smooth on the palate.  M: Clean, no carbonation, smooth as a whistle. Very drinkable.  O: Fantastic go to beer for a night out.

147,8951,nUgZ,4.5,"12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter.  A: Poured a dark brown color with a 1 finger head. Nice lacing.  S: This beer smells amazing! It's a very complex mix of smells...just what I expect from a Bastard Ale. Sweet, but smokey. There are hops and malt along with the smell of the oak. Very inviting.  T: Just like the smell, the taste is very complex. Almost every sip reveals something new. Sweet, malty, and nutty. You can taste the hops as well as a mixture of fruity flavors and oak. At times I get the hint of coffee.  M: Medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Well done.  O: This is one hell of a beer. It just keeps opening up more and more. The longer you drink it, the more you discover. It's extremely complex and I would recommend it to any true beer lover.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Retention is average, with some noticeable lacing after the reduction.  S: Smokey, malts, oak, and a sweetness I can't quite pinpoint. A pretty excellent aroma overall.  T: Delicious. Starts out sweet and tangy, with malts and hops dominating. It finishes on the smokey, bitter side of things. A very complex taste. You can't just sip on this and ignore the flavor--it demands your attention.  M: A little rough on my palate. Not particularly thick, but the carbonation is a little too high.  O: This was a memorable beer. Though the mouthfeel wasn't quite where I wanted it to be, the smell and taste were outstanding and I'm sure I'll visit this one again in the future.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

S: Malts balanced between bready and sweet caramel are the most dominate flavors. Close behind this I get significant citrus and pine hop aroma. Spicy and vanilla oak round out the aromas.  T: Interesting, lots of flavor packed in this for the ABV. The beer starts of with lots of bready malts with a bit of toffee sweetness. On the dry side for the style, but what characterizes this style anyways? I get lots of hop bitterness and piney hop flavor. Spicy wood flavor is there, but not overbearing. It mixes well with the bready malts and piney hops.  M: Medium to low thickness with average carbonation. This is an easy drinking beer and the mouthfeel works well for it, but it's not in your face like a lot of American Strong Ale mouthfeels.  O: This has the hops of an IPA and and a great malt profile with a strong bready and toffee flavor. Very strong flavors without intense bitterness, sweetness, or ABV. The sum of the parts is what creates the intensity. Oakiness adds an additional complexity. I really enjoyed this.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,KKB,4.55,"A – A brilliant orange/brown in direct light with hints of red as well. The head climbed up about two fingers high and is a sort of golden beige. This beer just looks lovely.  S – The nose is phenomenal. There is no two ways about that. Hops and malt, with the hops being pungent and fruity and cirtrusy and so nice. I actually can get the oakiness in the nose but it is very faint, definitely there though.  T – There you are, I was looking for ya. The flavor is just robust, savory, intoxicating, so many hops, but they feel a little mellowed out in this compared to the AB. This has a lot of sweetness that is somewhat caramel-esque, it has grapefruit in there for sure, and then after you swallow the caramelized sugar comes into play with the oakiness coming in big on the finish.  M – The mouthfeel may even be the cherry atop this magnum opus of beers. The mouthfeel is so smooth and yet it comes at you with a firm conviction, and still there is an element of creaminess that makes you just want to chug this bad boy down. So good.  O – Compared to AB? I have no idea. I don’t know which one is better than the other and I would be getting ahead of myself if I said that I did. This is truly something else though, and I could see how someone could say it is better than AB. I love this beer, it is one of my all-time favorites and I look so forward to picking this up again and again and again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,GMB,4.92,"Stone's Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale fills the room with aromas of pine, citrus, and flowers as it pours forth a deep reddish brown body. The head is thin and disappears quickly. The small, delicate bubbles slowly moving towards the top tell me that this beer is going to be gentle on the tongue.  The nose is unlike any I have experienced. The kind of bright and bold floral and citral aromas that we expect from Stone mingle the earthy richness of warm, dry oakwood. Notes of dried fruits and toasted grains linger in the background, but that is not to say that they do not contribute. Indeed, the aroma is rounded out by the malt, which adduces aromas of browned (not burnt) butter. The interplay of oakwood and rich browned butter is new to me, and I am having trouble coming up with analogies. Perhaps one can liken it to roasting whole spices, such as cinnamon, in browned butter as the base for aromatic dishes.  The taste is even more complex and intriguing than the nose. The bittering hops play with Stone's bold citral hops to create the illusion of grapefruit. Sweet browned butterscotch, an undertone of bitterness, spicy and citral aroma hops, and woody oak call to mind flavors of meats slow-roasted in savory barbecue sauce. So do the beer's rich sweetness and soft feel on the palate.  Stone's Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale is similar to Double-IPAs. Its flavors are intense, complex and demanding. Its flavors continue to develop for what seems like an eternity on the palate. I took my last sip ten minutes ago, but I am still picking up new flavors as I breathe and move my tongue about my mouth. Outstanding.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

A- Pours a dark brown with a huge dark tan head, about 3 inches of foamy head sticking to the sides of my glass for dear life  S- Intense battle of malts vs hops. Lots of smooth malts in the nose but the piney hops dont let them take over. Not much going on in terms of oak here but it smells amazing regardless  T- Move hops vs malts. The hops take their turn going first and the malts do what they can to keep everything in check but the hops are definitely winning this battle in the taste  M- Very smooth, this is the part of the beer where the oak aging becomes evident  O- Taste is good but a bit of a letdown after how good it smells.

147,8951,WastingFreetime,4.12,"AGED REVIEW  16 month old 12oz bottle aged at basement temperature. (BTW the brewery recommends consumption within 3 months. I beg to differ and present opposing evidence.)  I've got a palate that's arguably over-sensitive to oak wood chips. After the fresh tasting was too 'lumber-iffic"" for me I took the rest of the bottles to the basement cellar and forgot about them for over a year. And now, I'm really glad I did. It smells more like a barleywine now than a strong ale. I can smell caramel / toffee, citrus peel, vanilla (from oak wood) and a medium-strength leathery-tannic roasted malt / woody blast that is tempered by a gentle sherry aroma that wasn't there when the bottle was fresh. All of these factors are also present in the flavor along with a strong surge of grapefruit-pine resin bittering in the finish of each sip that satisfies my hop addiction quite thoroughly. It's even still got medium levels of soft bubbly carbonation!  However, it has lost a fair portion of the herbal and all of the minty hopping aspects it had fresh... I'd consider that a fair price to pay for the gain of these medium leather and light sherry qualities, especially considering it also reduced the oak wood tannic levels down into the range of my personal palate preferences. Aging this one worked out well for me because of my low tolerance for oak chips, all the extras that happened to come along with it were just extra icing on the cake for me.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Goblinmunkey7,3.96,"Thanks to angrybabboon for procuring a bottle of this after is disappeared locally.  Appearance: Very slight chill haze on a deep copper/amber. Rich brown and red hues. Head is off-white, creamy, and drops to a tiny, thin, wispy cap with sheets of lacing. Clumps of head stick around, but that's about it. Heavyish pour.  Smell: Mild touches of oak play with some sweet caramel malts. Roasted, deeply sweet, with some nice balancing citrus from the hops. Mild toasted notes. Cooked malts, mildly bready. Nice blend of floral, herbal, and citrus notes. Malt structure balances sweet and doughy. Oak adds a nice mellowing influence, pulling out some light vanilla and wood. Less aggressive than its non-oaked counterpart.  Taste: Herbal, sweet, and mellow. I didn't think it was possible with a Stone beer, but the oak really helped push down and blend the flavors. Big bready sweetness on the back coupled with a light toasted malt. Some big roasted malts follow and work well with the light floral touches and minor oak notes that float through the back. Some grapefruit and pine, but the hops are relatively clean. Loaded with caramel malts. Associated sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Nicely full without being heavy or syrupy. Carbonation is moderate and works well to spread out the flavor. Lingering bitterness.  Overall: Better than its parts would imply.  Arrogant Bastard is decent. It's a benchmark. Oak is good, but it's often used incorrectly. Stone makes a decent beer better by using oak properly.

147,8951,Converge,4.38,"355ml bottle poured into a 16oz tulip. I've never had standard Arrogant Bastard before, or any Stone beer for that matter, so I have little context to go by here.  A - Pours out of the bottle thick and creamy, with a deep burgundy hue and moderate haze. Big frothy head of light tan foam sits on top. Nice retention and awesome lacing.  S - Not quite as intense as anticipated, but still very good. Earthy aromas of oak, hops, hazelnut and a touch of maple fill the nostrils. Earthy hop presence is assertive but balanced by the rich caramel malt, toffee, and a hint of vanilla. An inviting blend of woody, resinous earth and pungent hop bite; very inviting.  T - Opens up malty, earthy, and a little sweet at the front. Oak is prevalent, but not dominant. Rich caramel malt is strong, with toffee, vanilla and maple notes coming through. The finish lends an assertive punch of earthy, slightly floral hops, fading into a lasting bitterness with a touch of coffee as well. Big bodied, but not abrasive. Definitely a malty profile, but not without complexity and balance as well. Good stuff.  M - Creamy and smooth, and surprisingly big. Low carbonation that prickles lightly. Finish is slightly astringent, with a lasting hop bitterness. Excellent mouthfeel.  D - Certainly not an everyday brew, but as an occasional treat, this is really something. The earthy profile, hoppy bite, and creamy body all come together to make a remarkable beer for the true beer drinker. Can't wait to try more Stone brews after this one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,StonedTrippin,4.13,"finally ive obtained this. it pours a rich redwood color, clear and amber like tree sap. theres a head an inch or so tall just off white, but it relaxes to just patchy foam after a minute. the nose is less in my face than i thought itd be. its just mellow notes of mature oak, tart dried fruits, and aggressive west coast hops. theres more balance from some nice english caramel or red malts. its also calmed from its original version to an arguably less arrogant and more refined and sophisticated status, which i certainly appreciate. the hops are much more laid back, contributing more than just bitterness. the oak does wonders for this beer, and its definitely my favorite of the bastards. it has a great feel, full bodied but the carbonation is tame from the oak chips, and the finish is complex and refreshing at the same time. the alcohol is also not as evident, which i think is also a positive this time around. i really enjoyed this one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,tectactoe,4.12,"Pours a dense and deep amber color, almost enough so to be called brown. A thick, foamy, beige head forms atop the beer, outlasts half of the bottle, and leaves some excellent lacing behind. I've come to realize that most Stone brews leave tremendous lacing - this one is no exception.  One whiff of this one and you can immediately tell it's a Stone brew - it has that tell-tale hop character; dense pine, pungent oils and resins, and bittersweet citrus rinds and orange peels. OAAB also contains a fat, meaty, malt aroma backbone, one that's almost too big to call it just a ""backbone"". Toasted, steely caramels, sweet malt and barley, a dense woodiness, something I'm guessing is characteristic of the oak-aging.  Surprisingly enough, the hops are a bit more mellowed out than the nose would have you believe, and I'd go so far as to say the hops (the bitterness, at least) is a little toned down from the original Arrogant Bastard. Don't get me wrong, it definitely stings the palate, but in a pleasingly moderate kind of way. Flavors are still there, albeit also a bit more subtle; leafy, herbal, ashy, piney, with large amounts of oil.  The malt character in this brew is nearly 50/50, however, with lots of toasted caramel malt, burnt, sweet, sugary toffee, and toasted bread. The oak is even more relevant on the palate than in the aroma - a dense, woody character overshadows everything, slightly dry and rustic. The oak element really adds quite a lot to the integrity of this beer. The alcohol beefs things, making for a thicker and more robust taste without impeding or being too harsh. Slick mouth feel, with a body on the thick side, but not quite syrupy or sticky. Relatively low amount of carbonation.  Very impressed with this one. Compared to regular Arrogant Bastard, the hops are a bit more aromatic yet toned down on the palate. The malt bill is more prominent and the oak aging certain brings a whole new and tasty element into the mix. If you're a fan of the Bastard series or Stone brews in general, get your hands on some of this.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Flavor: Big burnt caramel/treacle flavors up front. Alcohol strong but not overpowering, or as assertive as a barleywine. No hops flavor; some maltiness and a woody flavor.  Mouthfeel: Warm feel with esters present. Very creamy, almost velvety, but hops bitterness lingers in the cheeks and the side of the tongue. Carbonation very low.  Overall: The oak chips added to the beer, but the star was the caramel/treacle flavor.. Lots of other flavors made this a very complex beer.

This is a lot like the base Arrogant Bastard, with intense malty and roasted fronts with a subtle dried fruit flavor followed by a kick in the pants floral hop and bitter finish, but with a nice sweetness and rounded edge to it made obvious by the oak aging. You can definitely tell the difference between this and the regular Arrogant Bastard - if you liked the Bastard in its glory but want something a bit more drinkable yet with the same complexity, go for this. It's the same but with the edge off, and an added woody sweetness to make it more like Bastard Oaked Beer Candy.  As I reviewed the Bastard, I would say Intense, or Aggressive, but I'm also adding another couple of words: Drinkable. Approachable. Same dog, with less bite.

Smell: its got a nice oak note to it that is easily picked out of the nose. dark fruits mostly prunes and plums. Touch of caramel from the malts. Little bit grassy and earthy with slightly herbal spiciness noted from the hops. Smells like it has a fairly nice balance to it.  Taste: starts out with mildly sweet being malt forward transitioning into a moderately bitter finish from the hops. Prodominently getting caramel and brown sugar from the malts with a decent dose of oak. Malts fade away to moderately bitter pine notes which tend to linger for a considerable time frame.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. This one really drinks lighter that the ABV suggests that it should. Alcohol is well hidden in this brew.  Overall: This is a solid beer for the style. Not quite as big as most beers from this beer style, but its got a big enough flavor profile to be a legit American Strong Ale. I have drank Arrogant Bastard Ale a few times before and there is no question that the Oak version is a huge improvement over the base beer. Its just much more balanced and alot easier to enjoy.

147,8951,ThisWangsChung,3.53,"Welp, I'm not sure how 'special' this is for review #200, but seeing as Arrogant Bastard was one of the first beers I REALLY liked, why not review the oaked version right now; not only to compare it to regular AB, but to see how far my tastes have changed since then? 12 oz bottle poured into a tumbler pint glass.  A: Pours a reddish chestnut brown color with low translucence and extreme arrogance (at least it's supposed to be arrogant!) The head is a one finger light cream color with a fantastic texture that settles down into a thin, creamy looking film.  S: Light baker's chocolate, oak, vanilla, toffee, hazelnut, herbal hops, and caramel malt. Pleasantly aromatic, but a little weak.  T: I expected this to taste like Arrogant Bastard with slight oakiness...and indeed it does. Initial flavors are very nutty and caramel-y, before giving way to loads of oily pine resin. The oak profile only seems to plane away some of the harshness from the piny hops and help accentuate the nut flavors. Actually, this is kind of subdued in general flavor wise, even pleasant once you're accustomed to the bitterness.  M: Just like regular AB, it's medium bodied, with an oily, resinous aftertaste loaded with big hoppiness. Like I said before, its slightly tannic nature softens up the harshness slightly but gives a cleaner, drier finish...which is saying something considering how dry regular AB is. Adequate, pleasantly controlled carbonation round out the texture.  O: Arrogant Bastard is no longer one my favorite beers now, but after two misfires from Stone (Smoked Porter w/ Vanilla Bean and Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale), it's good to have them get back into my good graces again with this solid - if not amazing - drink.

The bitter hops are the main attraction here. The bitter hops after taste lasts a long time. With just a little sweetness. There is a little oak in there but it's not too strong.

147,8951,kdb150,3.52,"Poured from a bottle into my Brooklyn Brewery tulip.  A - Deep reddish brown, about a finger of head. Recedes quickly, but lots of lacing. Looks pretty good.  S - Smells very strongly of caramel malts and hops, with a decent dose of vanilla and a hint of wood. Very, very nice aroma. Rich and complex, worth smelling over and over again.  T - Doesn't live up to the nose. The hops do not meld very well with the woodiness, and there is an odd bitterness that lingers and also overpowers the maltiness. Rather one-dimensional and lacking in flavor for a strong ale, even one with relatively low ABV. Smells MUCH better than it tastes. Very disappointing  M - Right on for the style. Light in ABV for a strong ale, and the mouthfeel matches. No syrupy or sweet aftertaste. Carbonation feels right.  O - I'm honestly not sure what this beer is trying to be. The color and dark caramel character never melded very well with the strong hoppiness of the normal Bastard, and the oaky vanilla character doesn't either. It's not bad, but it's also not very good.

It has a nice, thick head at first - about an inch - but it quickly dissipates and leaves very little lacing.  SMELL: Surprisingly it is a little weak on aroma. A little oak and some light hoppy aromas come through. It smells good, just very toned down.  TASTE: A strong dose of caramel greets the tongue up front. It isn't too sweet, by any means though. The wood quickly takes over though and dominates the majority of the sip. Oddly, the wood seems to supply a little more sweetness than the caramel flavors. The finish kicks with a decent dry citrus and mild pine flavor.  MOUTHFEEL: Rich and full-bodied with a very dry and palate cleansing finish.  OVERALL: This is a big beer. It is also a unique beer. I've had plenty of beers that have seen some oak, but this one has such an intense oak flavor that when I first tasted it I was unsure whether or not I really liked it.

147,8951,charlzm,3.86,"Consumed July 14th, 2012 at The Daily Pint, Santa Monica, CA.  Beer comes out of the hand pump a deep reddish-brown with a fine, two-finger yellow/tan head.  Oak is strong in the aroma. In fact, that's all I'm getting. Cask ales are not noted for their strong aromatics, though, so this shouldn't count against it.  Strong toffee flavor up front with significant oak. Vanilla and chocolate also present. Alcohol note in background as well.  Slightly thicker than average mouthfeel. Prickly on tongue despite being a cask beer.  This beer is a whole different animal with oak age and tamed hops. I'll drink this on cask any time I see it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,57md,4.42,"Pours a dark brown copper color with a finger of beige head that retained for a nice long time and left intricate lacing when it finally dissipated. The nose has mild woody notes. The wood also comes through in the flavor profile and nicely accentuates the fine balance of malt and hops. The finish is dry and bitter. As this beer warms, the sweetness from the malt becomes more pronounced yet still blends well with the oak.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,threeviews,4.7,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (Best By Date: 8.20.12) into a Corsendonk branded (and block-stemmed) tulip glass  A- A fairly pedestrian pour yields an absolutely beautiful beer that is (crystal clear) ruby red in color with a titanic, 3-finger, kahki head.  S- Although less aggressive than the standard AB, that familiar pugent spicy/resiny aroma is smoothed out by the oak-chip dry hopping, giving off notes wood and a hint of vanilla. You wouldn't think so, but the oak melds amazingly well with AB hop variatal. Once the brew warms (and the head has subsided), a bit of caramel malt peeks through.  T- A short dose of sweet malt up at the front of the palate is quickly mellowed by a mild oakiness and vanilla twinge. The brew then wallops your palate with that classic Bastard resinous/citrus rind hop bitterness to remind you this is no ""fizzy yellow beer.""  M- Medium bodied, creamy and flavor aplenty, this beer absolutely lives up to its name...  O- Although the standard AB is hard to beat, I just might give the Oaked version preference because of a better balance of aroma and flavor. Fans of AB should absolutely try this incarnation of an already world-class beer, as you might just find yourself reaching for Oaked AB more often...and be sure to get it fresh!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,JamesMN,3.63,"Got a 12oz bottle for $4 at a local liquor store. Let's see if it's worth the cash. Poured vigorously into a tulip glass, producing a small one finger head that has shrunk a little but seems to be sticking around.  Appearance: Light brown/nutty color. Cloudy, can see some sediment in it when held up to the light. Looks nice. (Left amazing lacing on the glass).  Aroma: Earthy. Can smell some almost candy sweetness, probably the hops. Very slight hint of the oak aging.  Taste: Maltier than the regular Bastard. The hops are also not as present. Some caramel and dried fruit notes. A little reminiscent of an imperial brown ale.  Mouthfeel: Creamy. Almost something you'd want to slowly sip over an hour or so, but the drinkability is high enough that bigger gulps are rewarded with a smooth mouthfeel.  Final Thoughts: In the future, I'll probably opt for the regular Arrogant Bastard over this more mature version. However, it is a very nice and complex beer with a flavor that stays with you even minutes after you've swallowed.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,312HopBomb,4.2,"My brother provided this treat. Thank you Paul.  Hardly any head forms but it was not a vigorous pour. This one has a deep, dark mahogony hue that has a faint haze.  Nose has a rich caramel malt note followed by piney hop.  Taste is comprised of the same. Rich malt backing and then the onslaught of dank pine hop bolts. Some woody oak and a mellow tone, and I pickup some alcohol. Long bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is medium to full with low carbonation that lasts to the finish.

S: wonderful amounts of oak but not overbearing and has some hops appear.  T: well balanced between the oak and the hops and malts done extremely well.  M: light to medium, no carbonation was felt, sessionable  O: ok, well, I thought the ""arrogant bastard"" was just an ok beer, but this is way better. Everything is perfectly balanced.

I can't help but want more however.  M - light surprisingly. Moderate carbonation.  O - this was a mild strong ale. I remember liking it, but wish I liked it more.

The head on this pour was a little small, still with lots of carbonation rushing from the bottom, leaves excellent lacing throughout the glass. The nose is a little mellowed in this one compared to the original brew. There is still lots of citrus and piney resin hops, and the caramel sweet malt is there, but it's been smoothed out with a roasty, oaky aroma. The taste is very hop forward, lots of citrus flavor. The oak is there, but not overpowering like you're drinking a beer with whiskey in it. The malts have a more dark fruits, roasty taste to them. Mouthfeel is very full, mildly carbonated, slightly oily with a long bitter finish. Very excellent beer. It is an Arrogant Bastard slightly mellowed by the oak.

Strong roasted malt aroma covers the hops that you know are plentiful. Sweet smell with just a little hint of oak. Carmel and toffee become more dominant as it warms up.  T: Fairly complex beer with an abundance of flavors, of which hops dominate. Fruity citrus hops with an earthy tone. Don't get me wrong there is a lot of malt in this beer too. Carmel, toffee and dark fruit roastiness. Oak and alcohol pop in to say hello at the end. Lingering hop aftertaste.  M: Medium to full bodied with mild carbonation. A little sticky on the tongue. Warming from the booze but still very drinkable.  Overall this certainly lives up to what one would expect from stone. The addition of oak aging was a perfect accompaniment to an already tasty beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,mschind,4.83,"Poured in to a chalice from a 12 oz bottle. No date.  A- Great looking brew, nice two finger head, off white with a meringue consistency. Excellent retention.  S- This runs the gamut from caramel to biscuit to licorice with just a hint of the oak wood.  T- Fantastic flavor which is much drier than the aroma would lead you to believe. There is a nice malt sweetness that is instantly replaced by some bitterness that hits at the back of the palate. Hop bitterness as well as some oak tannins that create an astringent finish that lingers. The oak really comes through in the after taste. Oh, yeah, some alcohol too...  M- Full bodied, almost chewable. Pleasant carbonation adds to the smoothness.  O- If you are growing weary of the over exhuberant hoppiness of IPA's and DIPA's but still like something with a bitter kick, this does it. Wish I had bought a six pack.

The smell is intense, if only a little more subdued than the non-oaked version. Thick with hop scents...spicy, woody, rich...toasted malt...bread crust...some dark fruit. The taste is equally intense, full and sense-provoking. Bitter, sweet (not bittersweet), and malty. Loads of hop flavor...herbal and spicy. Long finish with continuous hop qualities.

147,8951,flayedandskinned,4.17,"Best by 9/04/13 Poured into a standard tulip glass  Appearance: (4.5) Looks just like the original; absolutely beautiful, clear dark amber body with blood red overtones. Quickly sprouts a tight bubbled, light beige, 3 fingers tall head that has great retention. The head leaves a sticky coating of lacing on the glass as it recedes.  Aroma: (4.25) Just like the original Arrogant Bastard, spicy, resinous Chinook hops shoot out of the glass towards your nose, this time slightly mellowed by big woodsy vanilla overtones from the oak chips. Thats not to say that brighter, grapefruit and lemon zest aspects of the hops don't still cut through the oakiness. As the beer warms, there is a slightly roasty, chocolate malt backbone that balances out the spicy nose with it's breadiness.  Taste: (4) Very similar to the nose, with the spicy, herbal chinook hops being the star of the show. The grapefruit heavy hops slap your palate immediately with their notes of oily pine resin and grapefruit pulp. Before the assertively bitter, dry finish, the hops are smoothed out by slightly chewy malt backbone; notes of bitter sweet chocolate and lightly roasted nuttiness. The oak embellishes of the malts with notes of vanilla and light almonds. Lingering notes of bitter grapefruit, pine resin, chocolate and woodsy vanilla. Moderate tannin presence, finishes a tad drier than the original due to it.  Mouthfeel: (4.25) Robust, full bodied with some moderate carbonation to help lift the heavy crystal malts off of your tongue. I feel like the introduction of oak malts the mouthfeel a tad creamier.  Overall: (4.25) In a nutshell; Yup, you guessed it, this is Arrogant Bastard aged on American Oak chips. The oak chips, with their creamy, overt flavors of vanilla and almonds definitely round out the very punchy flavor profile of the original, making it both drier, and more complex. The chips definitely sap a little bit of the fight out of the Chinook hops, letting the malts peep through a tad more. Overall, It'd really depend on my mood which of the two year round produced Arrogant Bastard variants I'd choose. I definitely can't recommend one over the other. My best suggestion is by them both and try them side by side.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,hollyisaway,3.61,"A NOTE: Price is factored in here. $20 before tax on a six pack, $60 on a case. I am trying to judge by style standards, but you should be aware of what this costs.  Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Corsedonk Christmas Chalice.  Appearance: A very solid ruby, lightening toward the edges in the light. Head is noticeable, but not overall important to the final appearance. The lacing really defines appearance here, and there is a beautiful lace down the side of the glass.  Smell: It's a strong ale, aged in oak. I don't know what to say. The scent is there, it isn't mindblowing and it isn't terrible. It's average.  Taste: To me, this is why you buy this (expensive) level of beer. And it totally fulfills. I had a bottle 2 years ago and thought it was the best beer I ever had or ever would. Now, it is still very good, very strong and assertive, but the ""arrogance"" has certainly been toned down when expectations are adjusted to a wider scope of available beer. Still delicious, and still worth the money for the taste.  Mouthfeel: Nice, lingering oak. Otherwise pretty standard, for better or for worse, strong ale feel. Honestly, I have some trouble separating this from ""dark"" strong ales and the original Belgian-styles, so I cannot say it has something great going. The above average is for the nice oak presence.  Overall: A solid beer that costs too much. If you can buy it, buy it. If you could get another strong ale, or even a nice barley or aged DIPA, for a lesser price, try that instead.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,Kegatron,4,"12 oz bottle into a mug.  Pours a clear dark copper with a couple fingers of rich light mocha colored head. This retains with a sturdy ½ finger of rich froth that coats the sides of the glass with thick sticky lacing. The wood pops a bit in the nose, quickly followed by faded notes of herbal, citric, and piney hops. Roast and sweet toffee flavors have some strength here as well and are being helped brought out by a bit of alcohol warmth.  The taste is similar, with moderate notes of herbal and bitter citric hops being surrounded by the woody and earthy accents of the oak. There is maybe a touch of sweet vanilla present here as well, which adheres to the stickiness of those caramel malts. The roast is very strong in this, leaving behind a roasty and burnt presence in the backend of the profile that trails some lingering char which mingles with a dry and tannic feeling finish. The mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied with some crispness on the tongue and then more of a firm prickly creaminess that fills out the rest of the mouth. There is a little warmth here from the ABV, which mostly serves to draw out a lot of the roast and bitterness in this.  It’s been a while since I’ve had this one and it was still pretty darn good. It’s interesting how the aging not only adds the oak flavor to this but also diminishes the assertiveness of the hop profile a bit, really allowing the aggressive of the roast to come out. The oak aging smoothes this out some; but not nearly as much as you would think.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

M - Not enough carbonation for my tastes. More like the amount in a cask. A little too thin, but stays in the mouth, which is redeeming.  I don't know if I'd have it again.

T- Big bitterness followed by a nice chunk of caramel flavors. Some darker notes as well. A tiny hop flavor of grapefruit. The oakiness adds a woody earthy flavor and gives this beer a dry finish.  M- This is a pretty big beer, not as big as its elder but quite chewy. A strong and lingering bitterness. A heavy but smooth feel. Dry oaky finish.  O- This beer is the business.

Smells of juicy hops up front, with grapefruit, citrus hops, orange peel, piney hops/pine cone, herbs, floral hops, toffee, sweet malt, wet bread, wine or oak barrels, faint charcoal, spices like pepper and mild cinnamon; the citrus is dominant, but the oak notes calm the nose and add a nice malty balance.  Taste follows the nose with grapefruit, citrus hops, orange peel, piney hops/pine cone, herbs, floral hops, toffee, sweet malt, lightly roasted grains, earthy notes like peat moss or charcoal, biscuit, wheat bread, rum and the woody taste from the oak aging; the aging mellowed the hops and made it very smooth and well balanced. It was complex, full of flavor and hid the alcohol extremely well. Basically a smoother and better Arrogant Bastard.  Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with medium carbonation and a smooth feel on the tongue, and only slightly bitter finish that trails off sweet and woody.  I think that I like this better than the original Arrogant Bastard, as it was just much smoother and got more flavorful as it warmed.

Taste - Tastes like how one would expect - Arrogant Bastard with a hint of oak. Coffee, caramel and grapefruit bitterness. The oak has actually mellowed the typically aggressive Bastard flavors a bit, allowing for individual flavors to shine through a bit more cleanly.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and creamy. A tad easier to get down than it's original counterpart.  Overall - I usually don't allow price to interfere with a beer rating, but this beer is so close to the original, while nearly double the price, that it's hard not to ding it a little here.

147,8951,rawfish,3.49,"Pours a ruddy brown color with a dirty sheet colored, finger high head. Tight froth with both great retention and lacing.  Caramel malt with some light chocolate aroma an even mix of vinous dark fruit, medicinal hops, alcohol and oak chips. Steady and heavy aroma that highlights more alcohol and medicinal hops and grape than the chocolate and oak.  Molasses, toffee, simple syrup malt profile. Very sweet in the forefront before medicinal and pine hops smash down the sweetness with a bitter kick that never really gets to it's potential as the oak smooths out this beer. The oak really aids in keeping this going as the sweetness and the bitterness don't get to follow through in the after taste.  Syrupy, viscous but less heavy than it feels on the tongue. Carbonation is average and the oak attempts to create a drying feel. Alcohol is evident despite the strong malt profile.  Higher marks overall because I know in my head that this beer is well built with full flavor and is balanced. The combination of grapey fruit, syrupy malt and medicinal/pine hops is not my favorite. The oak brings out an interesting dimension but only serves to increase the booze and palate bashing flavors.

147,8951,StoutHunter,3.53,"I got a bottle of Stone's Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale that my brother brought back for his trip down south. I have never had Arrogant Bastard before but I have had Double Bastard, which I liked, so I am continuing to try these Bastard beers backwards, so lets see how it goes. No visible bottling date. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a snifter.  A- The label looks good and it has the signature Stone look to it, looks good to me. It poured a nice muddy brown color that took on a hazy and dark caramel like color. It had two and half fingers worth of bubbly light tan head that died down to to a thin ring that stayed till the end and left some nice lacing. This a proper looking American Strong Ale, I like it.  S- The aroma starts off with loads of sweet malts that have a high amount of sweetness to them and impart some light toasted, caramel, slight toffee, brown sugar, brown bread and some grainy aromas. After that I get a pretty noticeable amount of dark fruits with the raisins and plums sticking out the most, there is also some citrus and earthy hops. Towards the end is where I pick up the barrel which imparts some oak and vanilla that is little lighter then I expected and it has a boozy aroma towards the end. The aroma is OK, but I wish it wasn't so sweet and that the barrel stuck out a little more.  T- The taste seems to be similar to the aroma. It starts off with loads of malts that still have a higher amount of sweetness but they aren't as sweet as the aroma, they impart some caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and brown bread flavors along with all the dark fruits that I picked up in the aroma. Next I pick up some light barrel flavors with a little vanilla and oak coming through along with a pretty noticeable amount of hops that imparted a slight citrus and earthy flavor. Towards the end there was some warming alcohol that was slightly harsh and it had a high amount of medium bitterness with a sweet caramel and malty aftertaste. This beer tasted OK, but I would have like to have tasted more of the barrel and I thought the alcohol could have been hidden much better, it was a little harsh for only being 7.20%.  M- Slightly smooth, a little creamy, and slightly sticky, medium bodied, with a lighter amount of medium carbonation. The mouthfeel was OK, but it felt a little watery and the booze hurt the smoothness of this beer.  Overall I thought that this was an OK beer and a slightly above average example of an American Strong Ale, it had some nice complexity, but some of the things that should have been highlighted ended up being overshadowed by all the sweet malts. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't that smooth and it was a little boozy, one is enough for me, I wouldn't want a second. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, it looked pretty good in my snifter and it had a nice caramel color along with good head retention. What I liked least about this beer was the lack of balance and the fact that the barrel treatment really didn't stick out that much. I don't think I would buy this beer again, I am glad I tried it, but when I want something barrel aged, I think I will look elsewhere. I recommend giving this beer a try, but it for sure isn't for everyone. Stone is a pretty good brewery, most of the beers I have had from them have been pretty intense, that's why I was let down with how light the barrel flavors in this beer where, I always expect big, bold and in your face beers from Stone, and this one didn't quite live up to my expectations, it's a decent beer, but nothing worth tracking down, Double Bastard is still my favorite of Stone's Bastard series.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Hops are present as unpleasant bitterness on the end/aftertaste. The rest is aggressively alcoholic (bourbon-y?) malty-vanilla sweetness that is oppressive, but not unpleasant.  M: Carbonation would be a welcome relief from the the vanilla-sweetness of the maintaste. A bit thick/sticky.  O: The beer grows on me, but I am still dubious as to the overall worth.

Woody (oak) and slightly earthy (tobacco) tones. Maybe a mint or menthol type sweetness. Some vanilla.  T: This is just fantastic and the depth is unreal. Oily hops, oak, caramelized sugar, and nice pine bite at the finish. This beer rivals a lot of heavy hitters in the ""lingering"" category.  M: A heavy beer that leaves a dry finish. I'm okay with the carbonation. I think any more would take away from this beer.  O: A fantastic looking beer with an awesome head that reminds of a hefeweizen.

T - The flavors begin with strong pine and floral hops and a noticeable amount of oak. Burnt sugar malts are there to balance in the middle. Surprisingly strong pine hops linger on the palate along with some cinnamon-like spice flavors.  M - Medium feel and light carbonation give it a slightly creamy feel.

On the nose there is the underlying Arrogant Bastard combination of deep piney hops and deep caramel with little evidence of the wood. In the mouth those flavors come out again, the earthy hops providing a long finish while the caramel sweetness dies away more quickly than the base beer, with oak taking its place. The oak and hops play well together in a long finish after the caramel disappears.  Overall, this is a nice variation on a decent beer.

S: Big and smooth at the same time on the nose, with heavy hints of vanilla, booze, raisins, some nutmeg, and a hint of burnt wood.  T: Lots to grasp here. Malty and smooth up-front with a chewy smoked back-end. Flavors of vanilla extract, malted barley, pine hops, earth, moss, leather, and smoked meat are all in there. There is a slightly hot, boozey flavor, but it is less pronounced than one would typically experience given the abv and style. Delicious and drinkable, with enough going on to keep you interested for the duration.  M: For a beer this complex in flavor, it's mouthfeel is fairly understated. Not syrupy (like other oak aged beers I've had) and not crunchy, this strikes a muted chord of smooth balance. It's robust without crowding your mouth, and smooth enough to drink pretty fast.

That is accompanied by spices, nutmeg in particular, which I did not expect. A musty tree scent, presumably from the oak chips but the scent is different from other oaked beers I am familiar with. Hops are present as well, giving a bit of a pine scent, but not as strong as the other elements.  Taste is hoppier than the smell, but there is still a fair bit of caramel malt in the mix. Hops are earthy and floral, as well as a bit of pine, and seem English to me, quite unlike Stone's IPA or Ruination. The effect of the oak chips is strong but surprisingly restrained- it does not overtake the rest of the beer. Aside from the oak flavour, it imparts some vanilla to the mix. Nice.  Moderate carbonation, on the higher end. Full bodied, a bit chewy.  Overall, quite good. 4.5 overall reflects that I was somewhere between 4 and 4.5 for taste.

147,8951,DM1293,4.65,"Let me preface this review by saying the following:  I don't like the regular Arrogant Bastard Ale.  Yes, I DO like Ruination, but Arrogant Bastard just didn't appeal to me the same way. But seeing how The Bros said that this is superior to Arrogant Bastard (a perfect 100 to AB's 98), I figured that maybe the oaked nature of this beer would have a better taste.  I was not wrong to think that. Everything about this tastes like Arrogant Bastard; hops and malt hit the palate and ride hard...there's a lot more flavor in the middle, I can't really describe it, but it slowly turns into a bitterness. Might be the smoky oaked aspect. And the bitterness is much more agreeable in this one. I think the malt flavor is a little more sweeter, more caramel-like, reminding me of a red ale. It even looks a little like a red, a deep red-copperish color, thats slightly lighter than regular AB in my opinion.  I don't know what really makes this so much better than the original. Maybe its because the bitterness is a little more subdued, making this easier to drink. Maybe its that extra taste of oak that gives my palate something else to focus on. But whatever it is, I can say that while I don't like Arrogant Bastard, I LOVE Oaked Arrogant Bastard. Highly Recommended.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Other bottles on the shelf were marked 4-10-12, so I know that this is a relatively fresh bottle.  Pours reddish-brown in color with a tan colored head that stood about one finger tall after the pour. Nice ruby red hues when you hold it up to the light. The head has settled a thin layer, but there is plenty of lacing on the sides of the glass.  The aroma is more malt-heavy than I anticipated. I'm also getting juicy hops and just a bit of wood.  Taste: Malt greets the palate first, but is quickly followed up by some moderate hop bitterness. The oak flavor is very subtle and comes out about midway. There's a bit of sweetness that helps balance of the other flavors. I'm getting mostly malt in the finish although the hops linger a bit too.  Medium-full bodied, and the juicy hop character adds an almost syrupy texture. Moderate to low carbonation.  A nice strong ale overall.  Morey's Bottom Line: This is honestly a bit tamer than I was expecting. It's still a very tasty and somewhat unique beer.

Little but of breadyness. Dark ruby colored beer (you can tell its clear when you hold it up to the light but its so dark its almost opaque). About three fingers of off-white fluffy head that retains at about a half a finger. lots of clumpy spots of lacing.  Not as powerful as I'm used to for Strong Ales. The citrus goes away in the taste and its primary piney for the hop taste. Its pretty earthy only more so then in the smell. Supremely smokey in the finish, its bitter but not very dry. Pretty coarse, but oddly super drinkable.  Great looking beer, above average tasting beer, not worth 3.5$ but not bad.

Smells of fresh bread, medium roasted malt and herbs. A very pleasant, complex, assertive odor.  Tastes medium sweet from malt and a small amount of vanillin, then a bit of alcoholic bite, and a savory herbal taste.  The mouthfeel really elevates this beer. It's a full, rather heavy mouthful with adequate carbonation, and a fine, drying finish from the tannins in the oak chips that meshes perfectly with the hops.  Overall, a very pleasant, elegant strong ale. When one considers where they could have easily gone wrong (too much vanillin, citrusy hops), it's even more impressive.

147,8951,TempeBeerMan,3.75,"Poured from a bottle into a nonic pint.  A – A crystal clear reddish-brown with a one-finger off white head with the consistency of sea foam. Lacing clumpy and patchy.  S – Oily hops dominate, but the oak is definitely there lurking underneath.  T – Big west coast hop presence manifesting itself as bitter grapefruit and grass. Oak/woodiness promised on the bottle is delivered in spades. I imagine this is what drinking a tree would be like. Held up by a malt base, but the woodiness completely overpowers the malt flavor. Bitter is the word of the day for this beer. (Not a bad thing, mind you…but man!) Becomes a little sweeter as it warms, but not much.  M – Medium-bodied with prickly carbonation. Finishes dry.  O – Many beers offer “oaked” or “barrel aged” varieties that are only slightly different than the normal versions. This is NOT one of those. When it says “oaked”, it means “OAKED”. While an excellent brew on its own, you can’t help but compare it with the regular version. Which raises the question….is it better than normal Arrogant Bastard? In my opinion, no. The extreme bitterness of the grapefruit-like hop character AND the extra bitter oak together just equaled kind of an overkill for me, and I find the original to be much smoother and better balanced.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,NuclearDolphin,4.25,"Poured into a tulip glass. I've tried Arrogant Bastard before and loved it so I figured I would pick this one up and see how it measures up.  Appearance - Dark Amber with a pretty cloudy look to it. Head is slightly brown and fairly foamy. Lacing is excellent and sticky. Pretty similar to the orignal.  Smell - Toffee and some surprisingly strong floral hops, where the original had piney hops. I can also smell the oak in here as well, which I think changes the nose. Overall, it smells alot more fruitier than the original, but still smells great!  Taste - Floral & Piney Hops and Oak, or slightly burnt oak to be more specific, all of which are pretty intense. The oak is what really makes this beer different compared to the original. While the nose was more fruity in smell, the actual taste is more centered on the Oak and Hops aspect of the ale.  Mouthfeel - Pretty heavy in body but the carbonation is more subdued than the original. And also like the original, this is a session beer, one that you need to sit down and appriciate.  Overall - While it looks like regular Arrogant Bastard, the differences in taste and smell are almost like night and day.

Everything is there but it’s all very distinct. Nothing overwhelms the mix. Flavors definitely intensify as it sits and opens up, becoming more vivid and rich.  Mf: Very nice, on the full side with medium carbonation and a distinct creaminess.  Overall: Not sure why exactly but I just don’t enjoy the Arrogant Bastards, oaked or not, all that much. Maybe it’s the assertive hoppiness that detracts from the old/strong ale kind of flavor, with its creamy fruity booziness; it’s a little jarring. Just not that appealing or drinkable to me personally; a bit too hot and boozy. Clearly well executed but not a personal favorite.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,sevenarts,4.88,"A: Dark red, light-colored fluffy head that leaves lots of lacing behind. Gorgeous, just like the regular version.  S: The piney, citrusy hops dominate, with hints of fruity sweetness and maybe just a touch of the wood. Compared to the regular AB, this leans maybe a little more to citrus/fruits than the pine bomb of the parent beer.  T/M: Again, very similar to the ""normal"" Arrogant Bastard, with lots of strong hop bitterness, pine, citrus, slightly softened by the sweet malt and just a hint of woodsy flavors.  O: The oak aging doesn't come through very strongly on this, though it does change the beer subtly but noticeably, altering the balance a bit and imparting a little extra layering. It's a tough call between the two versions, this one is just a little softer, less intense and maybe a touch less bitter; both are great.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,deadonhisfeet,4.16,"Poured from my growler into a Duvel tulip. Big, frothy off-white head sits atop a clear, dark coppery bulb. The head breaks down very slowly and leaves huge lacings on the glass. From the nose I'm getting a nice citrusy hoppy aroma of orangepeel and pine as well has slight hints of cherries.  I'm getting toast and marmalade flavors in the front of my mouth, then big piney, citrusy grapefruit flavors take over at mid-palate and dry out your mouth as you swallow, leaving a tangy, apricot-like flavor. I'm still tasting those hops several moments later. The mouthfeel is firm (not creamy) and satisfying. I'm not getting anything that reminds me that this beer is oak-aged though (I'd have never guessed it). No matter, the taste is really superb and this baby drinks like a top shelf IIPA.  I enjoyed every sip of this beer and one glass lasted me quite a while. While this isn't exactly a ``light beer'' at 7.2% abv, it's still surprising how slowly this beer insists on being sipped. Much of this is due to the hops, which take this beer to another level. Speaking of which; man, those west coast brewers certainly do love the hop. I'll bet Stone CEO Greg Koch sprinkles whole hops over his morning cereal instead of fresh fruit.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

S - Straight hops, a bit of wood (maybe the oak), and the slightest nuance of citrus.  T - Bitter upfront then as it slides across the palate a short lived break, that's when the malts pull through, citrus accompanies the hops when present. Dry finish with a little kick to it.

Best by 13th Feb 2012, which puts this at just shy of 3 months old (or is it 6?)  Pouring a clear, dark cherry wood with a dense, light brown head with excellent retention and lacing, this looks great. The nose has plenty of pine hops, along with a noticeable oaky vanilla. In addition, there's some fruity hop character as well,with mango, oranges and a little papaya. Some dark caramel is also noticeable.  The palate opens with a blend of juicy pine bitterness, citrus fruit, and an immediate oak tickling. There's vanilla, some raw oak character that makes the hops a little cheesey. The mid palate allows the malt character to shine, complex but still light, with caramel, candied fruits, a little bit of burnt sugar, even a little bit of bread. Drying on the finish with some oak, a nice piney bitterness and a little bit of burnt sugar, this beer is medium-light in body and moderately carbonated. The mouthfeel is quite nice here.

With swirling there was some very nice lacing on the sides of the glass.  Smell – The aroma is lighter than expected. Mostly hoppy in nature; pine with a bit of citrus mixed in. The oak is detected at the end, but is relatively mild in nature.  Taste – A bit of bitter hoppiness is the first to met the tongue. It is mainly piney in flavor. A sweeter malt flavor then comes into play. While the backbone of the sweeter flavor is caramel, there are subtle bits of oak and vanilla in there as well. Finally, some more bitter citrus hops come toward the end, rounding out the taste and balancing out quite nicely w the sweeter maltier flavors.  Mouthfeel – With a creamy body and a moderate to average carbonation it makes it easy to drink.  Overall – A tasty brew with a very nice and complex flavor profile.

T- Butter rum, toasted vanilla, caramel, licorice and sweet and pungent hops. Bursts of mango, tangerine, and pineapple  M- Nice and creamy mouthfeel.

Taste- The bitterness is readily apparent at the front of the drink. It is also prominently sweet with tangerines and a hint of oakiness and vanilla. That bitterness really sticks to the cheeks! There is more of the vanilla and oak in the finish.  Mouth feel- The body is very creamy and the carbonation is well done. This is a very easy drink considering how bitter it is.

Tastes great, suprisingly smooth with a nice hoppy finish. Sweeter than I anticipated. Not sure I detect the oak chips as much as I thought I would. Overall pretty tasty - I found myself taking another sip right after putting it down.  Medium mouthfeel - carbonation seems spot on. Left a nice burning hop sensation.  Overall this is a tasty brew.

147,8951,olfolxholme,3.57,"28  12 oz bottle into Duvel tulip (like a beer microscope)  A - A beautiful deep dark brown. Poured aggressively and achieved a nice two finger light tan head - looks healthy. Head eventually settles to a nice little layer with decent retention and re-formation, good lacing. Bottle artwork is pretty typical Stone machismo and tiny text. It's cool but I'm a little over it.  S - Not as strong as I'd expect - a pleasant but faint hop aroma. Some malt appeared as it warmed up.  T - Took a few sips while this was maybe a little too cold - I'll let it warm up a little. Even when cold, though, the flavor is complex and changes as it lingers. Pretty cool. Mostly hop flavor, for me. It's been too long since I've had the regular version, so it's hard for me to pinpoint the differences of this oak version. The oak isn't really pronounced. I honestly am not sure I'd even pick up on it without being told it's supposed to be there.  M - Smooth going down, surprisingly thin. A bitter aftertaste leaves a dry heat all over your mouth. This is where some of the flavor complexity reveals itself, though.  O - It's good, but I'm not going gaga over this beer. I actually wonder if it has to do with the glass. I'd like to try it again out of something closer to a pint glass. I have very fond memories of this from about a year ago, but this didn't live up. Maybe that's the problem? I don't know.

Nice lacing that clings to the glass the entire time drinking.  S- Sweet hops smell. Smells great. Hops are the most prevalent, with a sweet vanilla smell (not the syrupy vanilla smell type). A bit of an oak smell as well.  T- A very sweet hoppy taste, but not overly sweet. The classic sweet hoppy grapefruit taste comes out. Light sweet/piney oak finish.  M- Very smooth and drinkable. Medium bodied. Very well balanced throughout. Leaves a great aftertaste that lingers in your mouth for awhile after drinking.  O- This was a great beer. I enjoyed this beer more and more with every sip. Perfect balance between hops and sweetness (reminded me a little bit of the 90 minute) and the oak definitely added a little bit of character to it.

A - The beer pours a clear brown red color with a smaller 1/4 finger white head with little retention and lacing.  S - Suprisingly similar to Arrogant Bastard with a good blend of aggressive hops and malt character. A vanilla character blends nicely with a oak nose. The oak isn't nearly as powerful as I'd expect.  T - Fairly balanced, moreso than Arrogant Bastard, though I am not sure that's a great thing. Doesn't come accross as bitter or aggressive. The vanilla and oak found in the nose is present and good but not overpowering. Not as complex as I would have anticipated. However, the blend is nice. It's a good beer.  M - Medium carbonation to medium/full bodied.  O - I'd have to say I am somewhat disappointed in this beer. Taken what I love about Arrogant Bastard I am surprised, but am comfortable with that.

This gives way to the roasty malts and resiny pine which in turn finishes light caramel and toffee finish.  Smell: The hop aroma is more subtle to darker malt notes, however there is no missing the oak. Not to strong on the vanilla, it smells fantastic! You almost get the warmth of a whisky.

S: A slight alcohol comes through. The head that is present almost gives this a soapy smell. I really can't smell oak coming off of this, but instead its more pine. A tree is a tree though.  T: This is presented similar to a traditional Arrogant Bastard with a malty sweetness with a bitterness (citrus) coming throughout. The oaken taste comes right before the pine hits, but then the pine flavor takes over. Instead of pine coming though more as this warms up instead the citrus is sadly more present.  M: Because of its head a creaminess comes though. Feels full body and the carbonation is decently there.  O: Sadly the taste of this drink doesn't stay the same throughout. It starts off tasting similar to a barleywine, but then it changes to a DIPA back and forth.

Some subdued hop notes in the periphery. Taste has more oak and vanilla qualities, and takes on a feel that comes across like a thinner and lighter AB Some brown sugar, substantial malt notes and hopping that again, vaguely reminds me of the regular AB. A bit of alcohol at the finish as well. Body is a bit disappointing, would've appreciated it to be as big as the standard AB is. Carbonation is a light medium.

147,8951,TheBrewo,4.17,"We pour a mahogany brew, with ruby inclusions. It holds a one finger tall caramel head, showing medium retention and spotty lacing. The carbonation is lower and there is a mild haze, decreasing transparency. The nose unfolds with lemon, honey, and buttery diacetyls. There is rich caramel to the malts, with molasses sweetness and bitterness. Fruit is also present, in the form of dark cherries and plum. There is also fusel booze, and faint oak action. Hops are surprisingly light, and take up the back with earth and musk. As we sip, the taste begins bitterly with grassy hops and old, bitter wood. Malts and clean, robust, and salty. Moving to the middle gives the first hint of alcohol, with bittering of lemon rind. The flavors here are well blended, with woodiness throughout, pale and darker malts, and light hop character. We end with more bitter woodiness, peppery booze, and a crisp herbal quality. There is a final dash of spice, chalk, mustard seed, and leafiness with the last drops. The aftertastes breathes very bitterly, with medicinal phenols, grass, overripe bananas, and lightly of mild esters. On the far back of the breath rumbles a mild fruity sweetness. The body is medium and the carbonation is lower. There is nice froth and smack to each sip, but little cream. The oak gives a bone-dry astringency. The beer is quite warming, with a solid abv. These last qualities, along with the bitterness, make this more of a sipper.  Overall, the best thing about this brew was the cleanliness. The flavors blended together beautifully, with no flavor taking center stage over the other.

147,8951,Vylo,2.52,"Pours a deep amber color, enticing.  Smells like wood, not surprising given the name, but a bit overbearing.  Taste was... disappointing to say the least, reminded me more of double bastard then arrogant bastard. Too strong, tasted like a piece of driftwood dunked a cheap whiskey. Alcohol was not covered at all, and greatly interfered with enjoyment.  Mouthfeel was a bit bland too, could have used more carbonation. Flat taste.  Overall, a huge let down. I hope I had an off bottle, because I really like arrogant bastard (though I hated double bastard). It just tasted wrong to me.  If you like oak aged, give it a try, otherwise, your money would be spent better elsewhere.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,jegross2,3.91,"Reviewing the Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale from Stone Brewing Company. A hearty thank you to BeerAdvocate user funhog for hooking me up with this one. Score: 89  Appearance: Pours a dark red-brown color with plenty of opaque-ish ruby highlights with three fingers of cream-colored head. Excellent lacing, and the head really stick around -- if not apparent by the photo (proprietary). 5/5  Smell: Piney, citrusy hops and oak/wood up front. Creamy chocolate. A little caramel and figs. Oranges/tangerines and malts. 4/5  Taste: Very sweet caramel and citrus. Hoppy with toasted maltiness. Slightly bitter finish. 3.5/5  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, oily and cream. Low carbonation complements the viscosity well. Dry, bitter finish. 4/5  Overall: A very solid brew, but the original version (Arrogant Bastard Ale) is better in my opinion. Double Bastard is even better. This beer is absolutely worth trying, but a six pack seems a bit much on quantity for me. I guess I have some ""extras"" for future BA trades.  Recommendation: I can certainly recommend this one to both beer geeks and casual beer drinkers, as the flavors are pretty solid and not overwhelming, but the ""oaking"" does not seem to add enough additional character/flavor to justify the (steep) price jump. I would most recommend this beer as one to add to a mix-a-six.  Pairings: Hamburger.  Cost: $19.99 for a six pack.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

The oak is the first thing that hits my nose, woody with hints of vanilla followed by some sweeter malts and both floral and fruity hops. The smell isn't overpowering, but somewhat complex. The taste falls right in line, although a bit drier than I expected. The hops are there, with a bit of bitterness...and the oak is upfront as well. Id say the malt profile doesn't come thru quite as much on the tongue as the nose, but still alot going on. Slightly above average carbonation, and as I said before, a bit drier than expected.  Another nice offering from Stone, I prefer this to the regular AB. Im not usually a fan of anything hoppy on oak (or in a barrel) but this is actually quite tasty. All the components work really well together.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Taste: Comes off bitter and piney. Kinda like a piney and flowery ale like I said above but in all honesty looks and smells like your normal IPA but serves much much more smoother than that, Almost too smooth with a hint of wood.  Mouth: Medium/heavy carbonation, but compliments the sour taste bitter taste.  Overall: Pretty good beer comes off like a watered down IPA.

I have NO idea how anyone could think this has taste or is a great beer. I have a very good grasp on what good beer is and can even appreciate great beer styles I don't prefer, but this is just a horrible beer. I was recommended this beer by a beer steward and told that it is a very good beer, very much worth the $18/6. It is in fact one of the worst tasting beers I've ever had including Bud light!!! It is bitter, tastes like burnt wood or charcoal, is thin, no complexities to speak of, just an overall horrible beer IMHO. This is the LAST time a try a Stone beer. I have had 4 Stone beers and ALL of them have either been a huge let down or out right horrible beers. I can't believe how bad this beer tasted.

Very little hop presence in the nose compared to the regular arrogant bastard, but the oak is noticeable.  T- Malt and hops work together with the oak to mellow it out. Very good and balanced flavor.  M- The oak smooths the body out and the slight carbonation makes it very drinkable. Light stickiness in the body.  O- Drank side by side with the regular arrogant bastard and it is remarkable how the nuances of the oak change the beer.

Beautiful. 1 finger white head dissipates quickly. Nice lacing.  S- Really woody. Smells like the barrel room of a winery. Smells damn good, obviously.  T- I want to say it smells like a brandy cherry with no brandy. Then oak sawdust. Super robust flavor but not overwhelming. It's not a chugger, but not a sipper, I like when a beer has that drinkable but you are forced to savor it drinkability.  M- This thing isn't crisp, it isn't syrupy. I like the balance of mouthfeel and drinkability. Stays on the tongue but dry enough to keep you going and not staring at it.

T: I was immediately struck with the maltiness of the beer. It seemed as if the hops hit me much later to round out the beer. Alcohol sat on the tongue a little longer than expected but I would still say the beer had a refreshing kick of citrus.  M: This beer is smooth and fresh.  O: A great and bold beer.

A billowy two finger head is slow to dissipate and leaves a good deal of intertwined lacing behind.  Nice malt depth in terms of aroma - raisins, caramel, hints of brown sugar, juicy dark fruits and some toasted bready overtones. Hops seems tame, if not minimal. The oak addition seems pretty subtle, too. The fruit notes come across as tangy as the beer warms. Hints of oxidation.  Juicy dark fruit flavors (raisin, plum) wash over toasted sugar notes (caramel, brown sugar). There is some earthy hop grit lingering about. The oak makes for a dry, vapid wood latter half. The hops kick around more as warmth sets in.  The feel clocks in right around the mid-point of full and medium. The beginnings of slickness it calmed by a comfortable abv and rolling, granular underpinnings. Carbonation is moderate; doesn't interfere with the beer at all. Finishes dry with some residual hop decay.  This is a decent sort of beer, though the ""aged on oak chips"" thing rings of novelty to me (especially if you factor in price). This is enjoyable, but there are plenty other things I enjoy more.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Smells of oak along with caramel malt and maybe a slight hint of hops. Really nothing too spectacular but it's pleasing.  The oak hits you first on the taste followed by caramel and a sharp bitterness that is long lasting. It is a nice drying bitterness that really makes you want another sip. I feel the oak could be a little more prominent though.  Overall this is a really good beer but not out of this world good. I had to dock a few points because of the price.

147,8951,Jugs_McGhee,3.35,"12 fl oz brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into a N'Ice Chouffe stemgoblet in low altitude Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Expectations are moderately high, but Stone has disappointed me a bit in the past.  A: Pours a three finger head of decent cream, fair thickness, and pretty good retention for the above-average ABV. Colour is a nontransparent dark copper. It leaves a bit to be desired.  Sm: A musty mixture of hops, oak, and yeast. A moderate strength aroma.  T: Pleasant hops balance with the surprisingly restrained oak tone and the welcome yeasty notes for a pretty good balance of flavour. No alcohol is detectable. That said, it's pretty simple - an unexpected characteristic considering Stone's preoccupation with appearing to be the big bad bastards in the room. It's good but boring, and the oak aging doesn't seem to significantly alter the beer in comparison to the regular version.  Mf: Smooth and wet, capitulating to consumer interest yet suiting the flavours. All in all, it's well made.  Dr: While it won't satisfy fans of complex, intense beers (contrary to Stone's marketing), it remains a good beer I'd have again on draught. Don't expect anything incredible; you won't find it here.

Sweet caramel and earth flow towards resinous hops with a minty/herbal and grapefruity character. A distinct woody note is there after a while.  M - Nice and bitter with gentle carbonation and a medium body.  O/D - Pretty solid, yet I can't see the oak imparting too much character on this to make a significant difference.

Since then, my beer likes have turned to the more hoppier IPAs and dry hopped brews and oaked brews because of my burnt taste buds. And now, my thoughts about this beer:  The color is a hazy orange ambery in normal light. The smell was a little skunky and oaky at first (may have been and older bottle or not temperatured correctly). By the name ""Oaked"" Arrogant Bastard, I was expecting oak. Might just be me, but could not taste any oak; perhaps the hops used covered up the oak??? At 7.2% ABV, it drinks more like a 5.5 or 6 ABV.  Bottom line, I would buy it again when in the mood for this style.

BTW, anyone still bother reading the drivel on the back label? ;-)  Started with 1 bottle into an imperial nonic glass. This version of AB is a slightly hazy chestnut color. The head is a thin, fine layer of miniscule beige bubbles. Carbo is scattered and hard to find. Lacing is at a minimum, too. The feel is quite smooth and silky, and the body is a solid medium. The aroma is caramel and toffee malts co-mingling with some woody notes.  Like the aroma, the flavor has a healthy dose of caramel and toffee. There's lots of earthiness here, along with some rindy hop bitterness. To me the oak is very subtle, detectable but subtle. Makes me think the price-hike on this vis-a-vis regular Bastard is really playing on the gimic aspect as opposed to something actually benefitting the flavor profile.

This beer leaves creamy sheets of lace all down the sides.  Smell (4.0): Typical dank / cat pee notes of Simcoe, plus some pineapple action—Amarillo? Pine on the other half of the hop equation—Chinook? Pretty typical West Coast-style hop profile, backed by some simple sweetness in the malt base.  Taste (3.5): Strong vanilla oakiness, with a creamy-sweet malt body chased by grass-pine-grapefruit bitterness (in that order). Strong oak, really. The malt body is moderately sweet, but ultimately passive. Grass-pine finish. This is decent, and I know what they’re going for here, but the original Arrogant Bastard is far better—just too much oak in one sitting for me.  Mouthfeel (4.0): CREAMY. Medium-full, with velvety carbonation. Almost no prickliness. Slightly syrupy, but overall VERY creamy. Wish it was a bit drier honestly, but the creaminess is an interesting experience and not bad, for sure.  Overall (4.0): Pretty good. They really oaked the shit out of this.

It is dark and mostly opaque, allowing just enough light through to let deep amber hues bounce off the glass. A rocky tan cap is evidence of the cask pour.  Smell: A complex aroma for sure. Sweet caramel malt also has some toasted bread, with grapefruit and pine hops shining through from the base beer. A bit of spice and vanilla compliment the woody oak nicely.  Taste: Yet another beer where I enjoy the cask version a bit better. The toasted bread and caramel malt sweetness combines with the vanilla, spice, and oak to add a great depth. The oak and spice flow into the grapefruit and spicy pine hops effortless, all while allowing for a lightly bitter, somewhat oak, and fairly clean finish.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation is very much on the light side, with just a few soft bubbles to stimulate my tongue. The body drinks a little bit lighter than I remember from the tap version, which is to say medium/full, with a little bit less emphasis on the dry oak flavor. Very smooth.

Aggressive and sweet malt with some bittering hops, but the malt seems to dominate the taste. Has a slight fruitiness to it (still can't tell, maybe cherries). Then the oak character comes in and seems to dry it out a little bit on the finish. Slight roastiness as well.  Nice body, a little heavier than medium body. Light to moderate carbonation.

Bitterness is again a wonderfully balanced, an art that Stone has mastered. Similar flavors flavors to Ab; tart cherries, candy apple coating, classy hopping, malty bites . . . but the oaked has a mild toasty edge, soft but present, and a lingering sweet bitterness.

147,8951,hosehead83,3.95,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a wine goblet. No apparent freshness date on bottle. Dark copper/deep mahogony in color, with a rather short head of light tan foam. Aroma-Sweet toasted malt, citrus hops Taste-Some up-front oak wood dull spiciness, followed by citrus hops and toasted malt. My first impression is that this brew is not as tasty or as well-balanced as the regular Arrogant Bastard. To my palate the oak just gets in the way of an already beautifully balanced and tremendously flavorfull brew that is Arrogant Bastard. To me it's like adding cola to a twelve year old scotch. Not bad, of course, but it's changing the flavor of something that should be tried on its own. Just my opinion. The oaked version is no slouch by any means, and certainly worth a try, but for my money the regular 'Bastard is by far the best!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

T- Heavy roasted malts balanced nicely by spicy hops with an assertive bitterness. Full of flavor and very well balanced, maybe a little more mellow than the original. Slightly dry lingering bitter finis. Very nice, but again I fail to pick up on any wood.  M- Full bodied and coats the mouth well. The carbonation is just right.  O- A delicious brew.

It's a good beer where I found that the oak flavors were very prevelant from the first smell and first 4-5 tastes, after that it melded into the ""regular"" Arrogant Bastard taste for me.

Charred notes finish the beer harsh and the beautiful dance of sweet and bitter that I expect from classic AB is lost in sweaty wood notes.  D: Despite disliking this more than regular AB, this isn't a pain to finish at all. I even begin to enjoy it a bit towards the end.  Overall: This one didn't really do it for me. I mean, its base beer is basically too good to screw up, but the oak seems to detract from the base instead of add. I always avoided this one because the sixers are so damned expensive.

Very complex yet balanced and easy to drink.  O - A beer that should be talked about more.

Sweet flavor fades kind of quickly but the hops stay on the tongue for a while. Perfect hoppiness in many ways as it is not overbearing, but still VERY present. Does get a bit more bitter as the drink gets closer to finish.  Mouthfeel: Very dry with a nice slightly more than medium body. Pretty chewy as well.

Smells like Arrogant but a bit woody. While not as woody as I expected (indicated by my 3.5 rating) it still has that nice deep hoppy/malty nose.  Again, not enough ""oaked"" taste for me. I can't say I like a super woody beer, but this doesn't taste much different than regular Bastard. That's why it still gets a 4. There is a noticeable woody taste in the front. It doesn't last long and is not a major part of the flavor profile, but it does add a new element to a familiar and always solid brew.  Oaked is very drinkable; perhaps because it doesn't have as much punch as I thought. I was expecting the oak aging to add a certain thickness to the feel of the beer.  Overall this is a GOOD beer that, in my opinion, could have been a GREAT beer had it possessed a more prominent woody taste. This is still a very quality, drinkable, deep brew, but Stone could have been more aggressive with the oak. Cheers!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Rush of bitter hops in the attack that dry down into vanilla, molasses and cola. Very dry on the finish. Long, rich dark hops throughout, no saliva on the finish. It's difficult to describe, but the quality of the effervescence just seems higher, like if you compared a fine champagne to a cheap soda.  Overall, something very well crafted and really pretty unique. This is Stone maybe at their finest. The presence of the oak is absolutely there, its just difficult to describe. I think I absolutely prefer this one over the regular Arrogant Bastard.

T - Taste is great, rich chinook bitter hops, mixed with a kinda wood/oak backing. Hops first, oak second, and big aftertaste of bitterness mainly wood/oak/hop bitterness. Some caramel.. and big toasty malty thing going on.  M - Starts smooth but quickly worked into a smaller bubble fizzy thing. Goes down cool/not hot/alcoholish, but a big afterthought of bitterness that hangs around.  O - Overall, this is another great ABA style, I think the smell could be stronger on the oak side, but that might be overwhelming and unbalance the taste side. Definitely a little more on the wood/oak side of things with the normal aba styling, another winner from Stone. This is better then og ABA, screaming bitterness and must have a higher IBU rating.

Nose expresses caramel malt, molasses, a suggestion of earthiness and perhaps a trace of coffee. Taste follows nose - not really getting any oak in here but there's a slight citrus character. A light hops bitterness comes out towards the back, but this is definitely a malt-centric brew with enough complexity to keep it from being one-sided or overly sweet.

Very slow rate of head reduction, intricate soapy and sticky lacing. Awesome looking beer.  Just like regular AB, a ton of caramel and brown sugar greet the nose, accompanied by a blast of pine and citrus hops that are at least a strong as the hops. The oak presence isn't at all unpleasant, but I'm not sure it improves things necesarily. In fact, it seems to somewhat blunt the raw power of the hops, particulary in the bitterness error. Not to say the big bad Bastard is tamed; indeed, it's still a force to be reckoned with. The oak simply seems to provide a certain smoothness while coaxing out lots of sweet and buttery subtleties from the malt profile. I prefer regular AB, but the oaked version is very nice as well.

T - The caramel is a huge taste right as it hits your tongue, but the hoppiness is also apparent as it develops. The oak isn't as pronounced as one might expect. The sweetness definitely comes in, and reminds me of peaches.  M - The carbonation doesn't overpower the flavor, and it goes down smooth.

Otherwise the nose is dominated by hops, as with its unoaked little brother. Candied citrus and resiny pine notes lead the way, imparting a sense of 'green.' As I search I find the richness of the oak, but it's quite subtle, lacking the caramel/vanilla I was expecting.  Malt-forward on the palate, earthy and smooth. Oak is more apparent than on the nose, though it comes across as more of a rustic general woodiness. The hops add a big and bruising bitterness, but with little noticeable hop flavor, so taht the bitterness seems to come from the wood. As I drink, a bit of the expected oak character starts to come through, but ever so faintly. Finish is long and bitter.  Full bodied and mostly firm, with a fair edge to it.

I think there are some sweetening malts in this one and they balance things out. It's on the sweet side but again, like the hoppiness, it is less sweet than the Arrogant Bastard.

The oak is slightly noticeable in the nose, but takes a backseat. I really thought I'd be picking up alot more on the oak in the flavors. Now don't get me wrong, I can taste the woodsiness, which is pretty enjoyable. Wood chips really do give stong ales a different dimension without completely ruining the beer. Lots of malt as well. Mouthfeel is very nice, rich, smooth, creamy.. very easy to drink. I'm always down for one of these. It's alot more balanced than one might think. It's not quite as hoppy as the original.

I went through many style of drinking glasses for this one, but this Corsendunk glass is really it, started with a British Imp Nonic then on to a Dogfish Head Snifter and finally the glass mentioned above. The Corsendonk Tulip is the one really showed this ale at it’s finest.  Pours a huge three finger head when first poured, (but this is a narrow glass), settles down into a nice ¼” cap, attractive, sticky “lace” which lasts throughout the pour. Cloudy, yeast infused, dark amber color, beautiful Ale! The cap is easily revived with a swirl, very lively ale!  Yes the wood is the first thing to hit you in the smell, It’s not overpowering but does lend a definite Oak/Vanilla aroma first, followed by a very enjoyable yeast, some roasted malt in the back, with a faint hint of hops, then more yeast and wood, you just want to smell again and again. Extremely enjoyable!  The flavor is one of unbelievably delicious, rich, wood infused malt, distinct dark bread, yeast, rich malt, hops are here but in the background, crisp, medium sweet, superbly balanced, great carbonation, everything is in balance here, hard to find any fault. Did I mention that this ale is flat out delicious!  Very, very long finish of rich malt and distinct wood. Wow! I really like this. Makes you want to drink another and another until……..  Took a little time for me to find the right glass for this ale (don’t ever underestimate the importance of this), but after that Magic! And in picking the glass that worked, it brought out all the best qualities of this ale. I have had the unoaked versions of this ale in bottle and draft. That being said I have read more than a few comments on liking the unoaked version over the oaked, I cannot agree on this one, this stuff is excellent!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

First sip leaves behind mountainous amount of lace. Smells of mellow malt and a rich woody punch that mingles with a bitter hop aroma and another bit that I can't quite pin down. This beer is delicious, it has a nice spice on the finish the original arrogant bastard was lacking (almost minty at the back of my palate) - bitter hops sweet oak bring it all together. The mouthfeel is borderline creamy - sipping this is very enjoyable as the complexity surrounds my tongue. Let me note the wall of lace that has unmistakably posted itself up around every bit of the glass with the exception of the ""funnel"" I've been drinking from. This is a good beer, a really good beer, the only disappointment for me here is that I don't have a non-oaked bastard to compare beside this. Oh well.

147,8951,Digimaika2,4.35,"Purchased in Vermont from a very pleasant moustached woman. 12 Oz. bottle poured into a Bobcat Cafe pint glass.  A: Beautiful red/brown/amber (ripe nectarine) colour with a two-finger creamy beige foam head. Good retention and OK lacing.  S: Pine hops, molasses, caramel, cinnamon, and faint dark fruits. Detecting that earthy, musky, oak aroma. Sounds weird but can detect a bit of paprika spice. Very different and pleasing aromas.  T: Very smooth. Pine taste balanced nicely with a slightly buttered bread-like malt backbone. Finishes with a little alcohol bite and a lingering musky/woody taste that makes this a little funky (and good!).  M: Slightly oily with an appropriate viscosity level. About right amount of carbonation.  D: Should've bought the whole 6-pack! The oak chips really add a different dimension to this.

S: The smell is very malty and bready but with a decent hop aroma noticeable as well.  T: Wonderful. The initial taste is a slight bitterness followed by the malty backbone and then the bitterness comes back full force. The lingering flavor is that of toffee, espresso, and vanilla like flavors with the hop bitterness remaining noticeable too.  M: The mouthfeel is very creamy and has a nice texture. It is not thick or thin, it is just nicely seated to accompany the flavor and appearance. Very nice.  O: This is a very good beer.

Would account for the darkness of the beer. Thick lacing  First sip different from the second sip. Bitter hops dominated at first, more palatable the second time around, partnering with the flavors of oak and malt.  Once I could look past the bitterness, there was a creamy mouthfeel that was pleasant.

It's true, read the label: ""You won't like this beer because you're a pussy."" The arrogant part is really the writing on the wall. The beer itself, while a bit hard to take in, is actually very smooth and easily drinkable and quite enjoyable. Maybe they could have called this beer ""Loved Bastard"" if they really wanted to rock people's world and better describe this beer, because, while it isn't the most arrogant beer I've ever had, it's still pretty damn good.  It has a cloudy brownish amber body that is pretty carbonated and a finger of off-white head that leaves a little lacing. It smells delicious: some oak, but a lot of hops along with some roasted malts and caramel. The taste follows the nose pretty closely. Actually, very well. The hops dominate at first, but a spectacular aftertaste that accentuates the oak and caramel make this truly special. The feel is fine. It's well carbonated and a bit heavier, but I could've done for something a bit creamier or thicker.  The name is a misnomer to me. Maybe it's a sign my taste buds are going down the tubes, but I just like this beer too much to feel that I'm arrogant.  P.S. I had someone else try this beer and they hated it. It was way to strong for him and he'll stick with whatever is on special at the bar that night. Guess I can be arrogant.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Oak, but not a ton of it. Some caramel malts. A bit of sweetness, reminiscent of brown sugar. A clear, but background, hop presence. I was going to give this a 4, but as the beer opens up, the smell really begins to shine.  T- Caramel malts up front. Hop bitterness is much more pronounced in the taste v. smell. Oak on the finish, but again, not a ton of it. Hop bitterness is lingering.  M- Nicely carbonated. Heavy of medium. Coats the mouth nicely with a mix of sweet malts and bitter hops.  O- Very good.

147,8951,samwello,5,"This ale is in a category by itself. The brewers choice of hops, nutty flavored barley malt, makes for a very robust, complicated, tongue teasing, ""ale"".

Taste is a huge slap on the tongue. A ""strong"" ale to be sure. The oakey finish is cool, but overall it feels very dry and bitter. It was hard to finish my 13 oz. glass because it's such a bastard! The flavor is complex and commendable, but it's just not easy to enjoy.  It's been a while since I had a regular Bastard, but if my memory serves me right, I prefer that one to this. The OAKED is a cool beer to try because it is unique and complex, but at the end of the day, the regular one is less expensive and still quite tasty. I'll be trying the Double Bastard this week and I'm excited to see how that compares.  I'm also wondering if the batch the Bros. had from 2003 is substantially different from the one I tried.

Then when it warms up some you get more of the earthy malts. Also get that oak smell back there.  Taste: It's a perfect mixture of bitter and sweetness. Good balance of the hop bite and sweet caramel malt notes. It's bitter enough and smooth enough to make you want another.  Mouth: Medium body brew. It coats your mouth with flavor but it's not syrupy.  Overall: This is a very nice brew. Good for anytime of the year.

Now I have had the regular Bastard before but it has been so long that I don't remember much about it all outside of the fact that I liked it. I have been wanting to try this one for a while now and glad that I finally got the chance to.  I poured the 12oz bottle into my DFH snifter glass to find a dark, hazy amber body with a two inch cream colored head that left a nice sticky lacing around the glass.  In the aroma I get a bit of hops, caramel malt and of course some hints of wood.  The taste was great, the caramel malts hit you first with a heavy dose of hops in the middle with a nice amount of bitterness to end on. The oak is done just right, on the mellow side and as dominate as you might expect.  This is a very smooth, easy beer to drink and I could easily put a few down in one sitting.

You get tons of hops from the top and there is a lot of oakiness. The coloring is a deep brown.  The flavors are strong and complex. You get the ale, the hoppiness, and the oak. All mesh really well.

When I stick my head in it I smell hops and thick malts. No oak smell.  The taste is where this beer is at. Oddly enough one of the primary things i taste is a vegetable stew. It sounds crazy, but here me out. You get a bit of stewed carrots and bellpepper flavor out of it. Looking past that flavor there is a definite hop taste with a finish that is quite a bit different than that of regular Bastard. After 30 seconds or so I start to get an oaky aftertaste that the oak chips provide to the already excellent Bastard ale.  Heavily carbonated as a lot of the Stone beers are. Don't chug this one.  I like this beer quite a bit, but I think I prefer normal Bastard. The decision to only put this in 6 packs has always been a little strange to me, but at the same time it kind of makes sense?

147,8951,jondeelee,4.7,"Oaked Arrogant Bastard is the even louder and more ostentatious big brother to the regular Arrogant Bastard, and announces itself to the nose with a dual kick of massive malts and hops. Big caramelized brown sugars, wheat and sourdough breads, and toasted grains are accompanied by grapefruit and citrus hop aromas.  On the tongue, the brew is immediately malty, with vanillas, brown sugars, chocolate malts, pecans, and fruit esters (both dark, like figs, and light, like apricots and oranges). A strong hop backing brings in a tremendous grapefruit kick, which helps to hide the medium-strong alcohol bite lurking around the edges. The addition of oak aging does bring wood-like undertones, but also serves to slightly temper the bitter hops, and make the brew more nuanced. The aftertaste is largely hops, although strong sugars still linger. Mouthfeel is medium, and carbonation is medium to medium-high.  Overall, this is excellent fare, and worth the price over the regular six-pack of Arrogant Bastard. Fans of the brand will find even more of the flavors they loved in the original, but in a nicely elite form.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Spicy and floral hops notes meet earthy malt with a woodiness apparent in the background.  Spicy and earthy, like regular Arrogant Bastard, but a little toned down. The hops are not quite as present which allows the sweet, caramelized malts to come through a little more. The sweetness is perfectly complimented by a dry woodiness.  Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer, like regular Arrogant Bastard, coats your mouth decently without become very sticky. It is very drinkable as well as easily sippable.  The oak definitely adds a new dimension to this beer. However, I don't really like it quite as much as the original Arrogant Bastard as the lack of hops hurts the balance found in the original.

They better walk the talk.  Candidly, this was drunk from a bottle at a drive-in movie, so I have no idea what it looks like. I'll assume it looks like a beer, and give it a free pass.  A highly spiced and earthy aroma, somewhat wooden. Pretty good, the hops are definitely in there! Similar notes show up in terms of test. Definitely an agressive hops profile, with malt, citrus, pine(?!, yeah, I suck at this). I do find it takes me a while to down the whole bottle, despite the middling ABV.  Good beer. Very good beer.

M: The beer has a medium to heavy mouth feel and finishes medium long. The carbonation is medium.  O: I really, really enjoy this beer. I have had a ton of arrogant bastard over the years. In comparison, I find this version to have more of a biscuit like flavor and a subtle oak flavor. All around I think the flavors are fuller in the oaked arrogant bastard but still balanced well. I suppose the oak aging, or whatever they have done, has made the flavors more pronounced. One thing that surprised me was the obvious biscuit flavor.

Looks just like the regular, pretty dark amber with a thick sticky head and great lace. Smell is sweeter, with a hint of dank, grape and yeast. Doesn't smell as hoppy as ABA. Round yeastiness with a little sweetness, less hop character and more aspirin bitterness. The oak comes across as cloying, burnt toast bitterness on the back of the tongue.

Spicy hops and oakiness reward the sniffer. I get a little bit of caramelly malt scent as well.  Bitter, grapefruity hop flavor for a very brief moment, then joined by a smoky, almost vanillaish oaky notes. Then at the fadeout are more hops and some caramely malt flavors.  Thick mouthfeel, but not syrupy. Carbonation seems a tad bit low. If this were up in the barleywine range it would be expected to be that way, but at 7.2% it seems like the carbonation should be a tad bit more.

147,8951,zoso493,4.5,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a DFH signature glass.  Appearance: Like Arrogant Bastard, the oaked version pours a glorious, deep copper-amber. Immediately, an immense three-finger head appears and slowly recedes to a wafer-thin coating atop the beer. Big strands of lacing show up on the glass as this brew diminishes in my glass.  Smell: This really smells good. The malts smell thick, viscous and syrupy and are complemented nicely by a noticeable yet subtle backdrop of piny hops. The oak adds a very tangible but subdued vanilla scent to the nose.  Taste: The taste largely follows the nose in that the malts are the first thing to hit you. The malt profile seems very skin to something that you would find in a good barleywine, which is probably why the two styles are often confused. The hops, while subtle, counter the malts beautifully and give a sharp, resinous bittering towards the end of each sip. I like that Stone decided to tone down the oak's influence in this beer, as sometimes brewers go overboard with the oakiness of their brews.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is superb in this beer. It's thick, though not too thick, and has a very appropriate body for the style. The only thing keeping this beer from getting the perfect score in this category is a slight lack of carbonation.  Drinkability: This beer goes down very smoothly. There is a slight estery taste that gives away the fact that this beer is 7.2% ABV, but this really doesn't interfere with the drinkability.  Overall, Oaked Arrogant Bastard is a damn good brew, which of course is to be expected of any variant of the Arrogant Bastard franchise.

A very dry finish, the kind that leaves you thirsty for more.  M: Thick, well carbonated, sticky.  O: This is a fantastic brew.

So tasty, so many woody and oak flavors which balanced a great bit of hops and malts alike.

Was poured very aggressively and still only showed less than half a finger widths head, which dissipated almost immediately, and left practically no lacing.  S: Aromas of sweet caramel malts, citrus and piney hop, and mild hints of alcohol.  T: Complex, balanced, and delicious. The initial sip is full of nice roasted and caramel malts. The hops are very much present and are delicious. The oak wood flavors are certainly appreciated. There are hints of a grapefruit like citrus, as well as an alcohol character that comes and goes but certainly doesn’t dominate. Sweet roasted malt up front, which is so well balanced with heavy hop bitterness on the back end. This beer is much more flavorful and complex than its original Arrogant little brother. Towards the end of the drink the piney hops become more prevalent, which is certainly ok with me as I like hop heavy beers. The alcohol also tends to show itself more towards the end of the drink, but never to a distracting fault.  M/D: Smooth and well carbonated. Leaves the mouth feeling moist, awaiting the next sip. It is very easy to drink considering the heavy hop characters.  O: Overall a very good beer. Far more complex and superior to the original Arrogant Bastard. However, it is not quite at the level of the Double Bastard, or my personal favorite Stone offering, the Sublimely Self Righteous Ale. Still though, a very good brew in its own right. I would recommend this beer and plan on enjoying it again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,TheBeerAlmanac,3.88,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip  A: Pours a dark caramel color with a beautiful, evenly displaced creme colored head.  S: Smells of sweet caramel and light hops, vanilla as well as some chocolate. It’s very inviting and kind of heavy.  T/M: Tastes lightly hoppy, not nearly as potent as the other Bastards (beers, not fatherless children), and has a low to medium amount of carbonation. It’s quite bitter, definitely woody, and borderline earthy.  OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale is unique and delicious in a dark way.

147,8951,azdback,4.38,"Poured into my Stone Imperial glass. Beautiful pour. Dark caramel brown. Lots of carbonation bubbles that lead to a tightly packed three finger head. The head is off white or tan in color and very frothy in appearance, in fact it is sticking out of the glass a good finger. Lace is not real sticky but does a fair job of showing off some web designs.  Smell is sweet malt flavors and maybe caramel. There is just a bit of alcohol and some wood and maybe even some yeast or bread smells. This kind of smells like Double Simcoe.  Taste is so complex. This is why I have yet to review regular Arrogant. At first there is some pallet wrecking bitterness. I guess I would describe it as the sweetness of a tangerine but the bitterness of a yellow grapefruit. Followed quickly by the sweet sticky malts that I would describe as burnt caramel, and then the wood flavors from the oak chips followed by some alcohol warmness. This is so enjoyable.  Mouth is just wonderful. Full body, carbonated just right. Sticky and rich all the way to the end. With just a hint of alcohol burn late that goes very well with the sweet stickiness and wood.  Overall I have enjoyed this for many years but am just getting to reviewing it. I know now why I have yet to sit down and try to describe what goes on in my mouth when I drink this or it's unoaked brother. Very complex and almost un-describable, but that's most definitely not a bad thing.

Tapped into a 20oz Pint Glass from the Wooden Oaked Arrogant Bastard tap handle and enjoyed only one.  Aroma- The malt is the most dominant smell as the oak is present as well. A woody aroma is combined with a fruit by the foot smell that is of course sweet.  Appearance- Received with a 2 finger of off white head that has great retention! A dark copper but clear body is present with nice, thick lacing down the glass.  Flavor- An intense malt taste from the start and then the woody taste comes around to get your attention. Tons of hop are present and they make the bitterness everlasting.  Mouthfeel- Medium-Full bodied, Medium Good carbonation, and Chewy attributes. There is a warming alcohol mouthfeel that seems appropriate and makes this oaked arrogant a top beer!  Overall Impression- Fantastic! Much better than the original Arrogant Bastard with the woody/oaked character throughout. Nice warming and would be a perfect beer for the winter. I won't be going to this much during the summer but awesome Strong Ale!

Wonderful smells of brown sugar, molasses, and caramel.  I'm only picking up a little of the oak.  Right up front is a LOT of oak, way more than I suspected based off the nose.  The oak stays till the end.  Solid bitterness from piney hops.  You can still taste the malty backbone in between the aggressive flavors.  Bitter grapefruit aftertaste.  The oak and hops fight to be in front, which is the only thing that hurts this.  Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied.  Carbonation is just right.    Pretty good overall, but my least favorite of the bastard series.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

A: There’s about a 1/4″ head that sticks around for while and doesn’t fully dissipate. Nice, pretty lacing happening around the edges of my glass. Deep dark reddish orange. Seriously good looking glass of beer.  T: Yum, hoppy, citrusy, malt sweetness-ow we’ve got some malty sweetness followed by a wham/bam of citrus-infused hop bitterness. Great balance, I love how the oak adds sweetness to complement the bitterness of the hops (in a way that is kind of similar to Hopslam).  My taste buds perk up and tingle when this hits them and then there is this perfectly booze lingering film on my tongue with sour hops and a caramel sweetness.  Overall: Love it.

A slight burn with a nice smooth oak taste. Much less of a hop bite than regular Arrogant Bastard. Malt sticks on the roof of your mouth a bit.  A nice balance, not too chewy, not to thin.

Little bit of light got through.  S--Smells malty (like all of the Arrogant line), hints of caramel, vanilla, and hops. The oak is present, but well hidden.  T--This starts out tasting like a malt bomb, but then the sweetness of the caramel and vanilla came through. The hoppiness/bitterness was there first, but the oak finished and left the beer smooth.  M--Medium-bodied. Very little carbonation. The bitterness lingers, and is replaced by the smoothness and sweetness of the finish.  O--I love Oaked Arrogant.

The aroma was very pronounced with a tawny wine alcohol scent that gets you right away and also had dark bread malts, a nice resin hop and a sweet doughy yeast with hints of citrus (grapefruit), pineapple, caramel and a nice smoky oak.  It tasted sweetly acidic and very malty with a note of caramel from the onset then progressed into a bitter hoppy woody flavor with a strong grapefruit presence and had a mild alcohol warming finish.  Mouthfeel was just a few shades above medium in body with the texture being nice and dry yet creamy and having a mild carbonation.

147,8951,orangesol,4.07,"2009 bottle poured into a few taster glasses.  A - Pours murky brown with a small half finger tall off-white head leaving very little lacing down the glass.  S - Smells of rich caramel malt, toffee, citric hops, and some earthy wood tannins from the wood chips. This has a lot going on but they all complement each other leaving a complex yet enjoyable nose.  T - Starts off with a big hit of sweet caramel and toffee from all that malt slowly giving way to a mix of dulled citric hops, vanilla, and pallet drying wood tannins. The dryness carries over to the finish, mixing with a bit of the sweetness from the malt, and lingers for some time. Overall I enjoyed this one, it was complex yet enjoyable. I am not sure I could have more than one at a time but once in a while is fine by me.  M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. It has an overall slick feel with a mix of malted sweetness and tannin dryness in the finish, lingering for some time.  O - I think I enjoy oaked bastard more than the regular version.

147,8951,RodneyX,4,Dark brownish black beer with brown on the edges and an off-white head. It smells of hard malts and some bitter wood and hops. This must be dryhopped or something on the end because it has a really hoppy finish on top of all the other roasted malts and dark fruits. It's actually quite nice but a load to drink. Bought myself a six pack after trying it on tap.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Rschis16,4.38,"Looks great of course with its big 3-finger baige head that laces all the way down. Dark reddish-brown with hues of cherry. Big barley smell, and mostly malt on the nose with a slight hop end.  Oh malty goodness. With some very nice hop flavors to accentuate the barley malt. The hops, in fact are perfectly bitter and lingering, but you don't leave the first taste thinking of the hops. You think of the bread-like taste first, then the hops actually take over in the finish. Alcohol taste is definitely present, but in no way does it take away from the beer. It finishes dryly, but not exactly crisply, and almost refreshing but definitely not the best beer for a hot day. This is full-bodied without being overbearingly thick in the mouth. I honestly expected this to be more like regular Arrogant Bastard, but with the oaked variety it seems like the oak chips took an edge of that maltiness and a spiciness to it that was either lost in the muddled feel of the non-oaked variety or simply wasn't there. Either way, I prefer this one and the fact that it's way more drinkable than its brother. The mouthfeel was not as thick and hard to drink. The oak chips make all the difference in the world to the overall drinkability of this one, and for that this beer is fantastic.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

The barrel aging is immediately obvious with oak and woodiness slowly giving way to bitter hoppiness.

As is swirl and stick my nose in the glass, I am bombarded by wonderful, heavy, sort of syrupy fragrance of sweet and sour. Lots of grapefruit, spices, and pine, but then on the other end of the scale there is vanilla, cherries, figs, caramel, toffee, and sweet malt. Taste is better than the smell, smooth rush of tartness from the hops in the guise of grapefruit, lime, and pine. Then there is the sweetness of toffee, vanilla, caramel, wild cherry, and sweet malt.

On opening the first bottle, I was greeted with that syrupy, mnalty aroma that always brings the word ""cloying"" to mind. Thankfully, my fears were unfounded as the hops soon arrived in all their herbal, piney, ripe citrus glory, backed by a bit of subdued woodiness.  Early on, the flavor initiates with a lightly sweet maltiness that soon is nearly annihilated by the bitter hops that follow. By the third brew, the hops have nearly destroyed my taste buds, and the sweet malts become more assertive. I get a little oak in the aftertaste.  Medium bodied with decent carbonation. Nice and silky.  Much better as it warms. The bitterness tones down a bit, and the sweet malt becomes more competitive.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Taste: A complex mix of caramel malts, toffee, vanilla, cherries, citrus, and earthy hop bitterness with some hints of dark fruits and coffee. A lot going on here. Oak is fairly subdued.

A: Mahogany, deep reddish brown with a thin, creamy head of off white foam which persists nicely and leaves a nice amount of sticky lace.  S: Complex fruity and caramel malt nose with hints of dried cherries, vanilla, oak, whiskey barrels and spent rum casks. A musty, pine needle hop aroma imparts and earthy musk.  T: Smooth, rich, fruity malt profile with hints of berry, plum, raisin and bitter, flavored tea. Citrusy, herbal and earthy hops make their way across the palate with notes of pine and a refined, mineral-filtered bourbon essence. The finish lingers with bittersweet, sticky malts and hop resins with a hint of smoked wood.  M: Rich, full-bodied, but so very smooth and fulfilling. The oak keeps the hops from becoming to sticky and malts from cloying sweetness. Just right and very satisfying.  O: Oak Aged AB takes a bit of the hop wallop out of the sails, but the essence of these West-Coast varietals are still very much at play. On the plus side, the 7.2% ABV and hop chaos is smoothed out so nicely and malts are really brought forward by the calming, refining qualities of wood-aging the beer.

Retention is superb as well as the lacing.  S: This is most definitely IPA territory when it comes to hops content. Definitive west coast style of hoping with the perfect blend of pine resin, grapefruit juice, lime zest and mint. But, there is also a good level of caramel malts in this (not as much as a barleywine though) and light vanilla. Light notes of oak in the background.  T: Follows the smell pretty well. Very good amount of maltiness in the taste with caramel, fruit bread, vanilla and brown sugar. The west coast hops are still there and strong: pine resin, grapefruit juice, lime zest and mint. The oak treatment also comes out much stronger than in the smell. Some pepper. There is a light chalk taste that I usually despise in this beer. But, the chalk blends perfectly with the oak and pine without ever being a ""bad"" thing. Definitively not an IPA or a Barleywine.  M: Heavy body with medium carbonation. Although it is heavy and sticky, it also is very creamy and smooth. Exceptional.  O: This is a really really good beer. I don't have other ways to put it out.

Tons of lacing.  S: Floral and citrus hops, pine, caramel malt, slightly dark fruits: peach to plum, alcohol, charred oak. Caramel candied apples.  T: A lot of caramel sweetness up front with floral hops (slight citrus) and pine, but not that bitter. The middle creates a fruit flavors ranging from peach to dark plums and raisins with the mingling of caramel and hops. Wood comes through perfectly in the middle and finish: lightly charred oak integrated with the malt adding a very nice flavor and smoothness. With the oak comes just a hint of vanilla, mostly in the finish as the hops ease up. Finish is oaky, bitter, and grainy with a little alcohol coming through. Definite floral hop bite on the finish.  M: Medium body and carbonation that seems to have a bit of viscosity. A very smooth, almost velvety mouthfeel thanks to the oak aging. Just a touch of alcohol on the finish.

There are notes of vanilla, and piney hops. There are fruity notes, with plum and citrus both being discernable.  T: The taste starts out maltier than I would have expected, but this quickly gives way to a dry hop flavor. There is a little bit of grapefruit flavor. The oak flavor is not too pronounced, but it adds a spiciness to the beer and a subtle earth tone. Finish is long and dry but not terribly bitter.  M: Fairly light with moderate carbonation.

The label reads ""Ale Aged With American Oak Wood Chips"" and proudly displays the Stone gargoyle that I'm sure we've all been accustomed to by now.  Smell: smells of tight fruit and alcohol.  Taste: the flavors from the oak chips permeate this beer in a magnificent way. The oak evens out this beer perfectly while adding a new, complex dimension to the taste. Like the other incarnations of the Arrogant Bastard, the strong grapefruit presence is maintained. Flavors of alcohol are certainly detectable, but kept nicely in check by the oak chips.  Mouthfeel: mild ""bite"" with reasonable carbonation.  Overall: in my opinion, the Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale is definitely superior to the ""standard"" Arrogant Bastard.

Lovely.  Aroma-Ass-kicking-not necessarily an a good or bad way, just I can already tell from the aroma that this is going to kick my ass. Pungent, minty, grapefruity hops and fresh oak wood with notes of sweet vanilla. Definite whiff of heady alcohol. Something sweet-coconut? bubblegum? Slight caramel malt is present as well. The aroma is evocative and intense, and the more I smell it, the more I like it.  Flavor-Wicked. Same smooth minty grapefruit hop flavor as the aroma. Sweet up front before moderately high hop bitterness kicks in. Flavors of toasted oak blend with the huge bitterness which grows to a crescendo in the finish. As the aftertaste carries on a slight caramel flavor grows alongside grapefruit flavors and a lingering, sticky bitterness.  Mouthfeel-Medium body with moderate carbonation and puckering bitterness. Still is pretty smooth with low alcohol warmth.  This beer is absurd in its complexity. Delicious, powerful, and downright intriguing.

Aroma is nice grapefruit with wood and a tinge of vanilla.  Taste is worth the extra few bucks. Very up front with the initial sip. Lots of hop bitterness. Not quite grapefruit but really citrus rind inclinations. Great malt balance and not overly sweet, but just enough. This is one powerfully flavored beer, but enjoyable.  Mouth feel is quite creamy with good carbonation. Finish has yet another dose of bitterness.  Hopheads should delight in this one. Yeah, I know it has malt, but boy does it have hops too.

I’m definitely anticipating a much bigger taste than these aromas are leading me to believe.  T: Much bigger, indeed. To be honest, I didn’t really expect a whole lot of difference between this and Stone’s original ale. This, though, is definitely a more grown-up Bastard. A mellow sweetness comes across the entire palate, from first sip to last. A big Stone flash of hops comes first, heightened by floral notes and citrus. There’s a syrupy, almost candy-like bit of something in there as well (licorice/plum?). And it’s all rounded off with a dark, smoky booziness. Overall, a big, oaky body that is dry in the best way possible. Excellent.  M: A very smooth drink. Subtle carbonation gives more drinkability to this relatively heavy beer.  O: A damn good brew. I’m definitely a lot more eager to try the “Oaked” counterparts of my other favorites now that I’ve seen what a difference oak-aging can do.

Taste at first sip seems a little salty, but a richness and hoppiness still comes through. Honestly I think the oaking cut the power of the hops down from the unoaked version. And why chips vs oak barrels? Chips are what less reputable vintners use in wine (cheaper, and although I think it's a similar effect I swear I can taste the difference in wines too).

147,8951,HattedClassic,4.5,"Appearance: A beautiful orangish and slightly brown amber. I poured a one finger tan head that is still there after 30 minutes.  Smell: A complex mix of hops and sweet caramel malts. The hops appear to be more earthly. Surprisingly, I get none of the oak and a small hint of vanilla that usually accompanies oak aged beers and I think the beer is the better for it.  Taste: Same as the smell but the malts are more pronounced and complement the hops. I can detect a little bit of the oak towards the end and bitter aftertaste that seems to linger for quite a while.  Mouthfeel: Light carbonation with a smooth body and slightly creamy finish.  Overall: The Oaked Arrogant Bastard is the first real microbrew that I've had after discovering craft beers.

147,8951,ludachris,4.12,"The body is a deep, burnt murky amber hue that gives off honey amber highlights when held up to the light. A finger and a half of frothy and thick egg shell white head makes this beer look great in my tulip glass.  A rich, almost onion-like hoppiness is the first thing that jumps out at me. I also get musty pine notes that lie on top of grapefruit and lemon peel. A sweet and toasy malt character takes some digging to find but provides a welcomed sweetness. I have yet to have the original Arrogant Bastard so I can't pick out the differences, but I can say that, besides a slight woody note, I get next to no oak or vanilla.  The hop character that hits the palate first is hard to describe. It's something like an earthy herbal bitterness that leans towards being astringent. As it goes on, the bitterness becomes more pine-like with the addition of grapefruit rhine. A delicate sweet toasty malt character hangs out in the back as the hops do their thing. The oak aging is much more apparent in the taste, giving off notes of smokey wood and charcoal.  Medium bodied and smooth in the mouth. The level of carbonation helps to accentuate the hop bitterness which seems to largely be what this beer is centered on. The oak aging is apparent in the feel as well, giving the beer a delicate and creamy texture.  All in all, this is a solid, interesting and complex ASA. I'm happy to say that I've never really had a beer like this before and I enjoyed the experience. One day in the future I'll have this with the regular version to help me appreciate what the oak aging has done for this beer.

The hazy, sediment filled dark ruby tobacco burst strong ale gives off unidentified fruit and sweetness in the nose. I was beginning to have my doubts about this bastard of a beer until I tasted it. Wow! Rich and complex. Bitterness up front and all around, evens out with a caramel malt finish. The bitterness lingers, without any leafy hop presence. Smoky, roasty, oak notes with hints of vanilla. Alcohol and fruity esters start to appear as you work your way through the pint. The imparted oak characteristics coat your mouth, and become present in great depth. It's starting to taste like a campfire. As it warms, bitterness increases up front with currant, tobacco and chocolate. I can't get over how much is coming out of this beer. Roasted malts start to dominate at the end. The flavor of this beer is it's strong point, but the mouthfeel is a close second. Crisp carbonation pairs well with a medium-thick body.

The pour on this brew was very nice. As you look at the colors, it is a dark brown, a bit of reddish streaks throughout. It had a great, light tan head that had a little bit of retention that last just a few minutes. This brew left a great lacing as it slide down the sides of snifter that I had poured it into.  The aroma on this brew is also very nice. It has a great smokey, wood aroma that comes out in the front of this brew. It quickly feeds into a great aroma of floral hops, which comes with some sugars and just a touch of alcohol bourbon. As the brew sits and warms, the Oak is present more then ever, and is a great addition to the already good Arrogant Bastard. It finishes with some more of the nice bourbon notes and the hops, that comes off nice and citrussy.  This is a great tasting brew. Its super complex and gets better as the brew warms in the glass. The flavors follow the aromas pretty well. There are some great notes of chocolate, toffee/coffee, bourbon, and a great smokey, oak flavor. It has a great hop bitterness as well. They aren't overkill though, because the oaked process mellowed them out and gives this brew an almost stout likeness. The warming of the brew gives life to the name sake of the it, but putting forward, the bourbon, oak, and smokey flavors. Its a great brew.  The mouthful on this brew is very good. It has that alcohol tingle, the hoppy bitterness. This is a great medium bodied brew that gives you everything you look for in the style. Its smooth and packs a punch that gives you a run for the money, but leaves you wanting more.  Its kind of funny, you look at the bottle on this brew, and the label says ""Your Not Worthy."" Its very true. This brew is a great representation of the style. I have had the original Arrogant Bastard, which is also an amazing brew. This brew steps it down, but not in a bad way. It gives it a more reserved, almost elegant version of teh brew. It still hop strong and a great brew. I can't wait to get my hands on another bottle of this brew.

My wife thinks it smells like an asian sauce of some sort and, after the suggestion, I didn't disagree. The flavor is big hops atop that light caramel flavor with the faintest hint of oak. You could slip this past someone as Arrogant Bastard in my opinion without them knowing. That said, this is a very solid beer anyway. Big carb and a bit of lingering sweetness accompany the hoppy finish. Overall, a darn good beer, oak or little to no oak.

Well better do this and re-review it, lets see if this makes a difference, instead of drink one that was 2 months past. Poured both into a nonic and a snifter.  This head is much bigger and darker than I remember and has more retention on the nonic, lots of cap action. Great looking beer even in a nonic or snifter  Smell is grapefruity and less malty than before, a little hint of wood, and slightly less brown sugar. Where did that grapefruit go last time?  Taste is super chocolaty, with hints of tannic wood and super big hop presence on the finish! Wow this is a HUGE difference it's like a chocolate hop slight tannic wood blast!  Overall much improved! Hops do make a difference and must have mellowed the hops out sitting around a bit last time. This is much better and very different when fresh.  ---  old review Feb 20-2011  Poured from the bottle into a large snifter. Thanks to TKEAnmial for the bottle. It is a little old at enjoy by Dec 2nd 2010... hmmm... it is a strong ale so this should be okay, but we are a little late to the party. At least the late Nosferatu I had was flat out fantastic so let's see how this compares.  Pours an amber color out of the bottle and a nice light tan head. Sits on a dark red body with some nice hues against the light. Head has lots of staying power and some big boozy thick legs with spotty lacing.  Smell is kind of buttery diacetyl, with faint sweet caramel and dark brown sugars in the back. Very much into movie theatre popcorn territory. Not a very distinct or varied nose on this.  Faint tannin like in mid palate, a fairly good wood ""like"" character surprisingly in the swallow but with some hop bitter sharpness. Missing a bit of pronounced flavor and starting to mellow but still a bit sharp in alcohol.

147,8951,SkeeterHawk,4.39,"I have had this beer a number of times at beer meetings and such and remember thinking that it was pretty good, but never went back to it. I recently noticed that this is one of the available Stone products in my area that I haven't reviewed, so I sucked it up and shelled out the nearly $14 a six-pack to review it properly. Well, I really enjoyed that six-pack and ended up drinking them all and didn't post a review. This is the third bottle from my second six-pack, which I should review now before I am in the same boat again. Here we go:  Appearance: Pours a pretty clear reddish brown color with a small head of tan bubbles after a pretty fast pour. The head was back into the beer within about 20 seconds to end up as a small ring where the beer meets the glass.  Aroma: The initial aroma is a nice blend of American hops, assertive malts, and very noticeable dry wood and the assiciated subtle vanilla notes that you would expect. As the beer sits for a bit, the vanilla is getting more noticeable and the hops are also coming out more, so the volume is essentially just getting turned up.  Taste: The flavor seems to come across much more balanced than the original bastard. I don't know if the recipe got tweaked for this batch or if the wood aging softened up the bittering as normally the bittering hops are quite aggressive and linger for some time, but the woody flavors and vanilla add significant complexity to the finish so that it dries out the palate some, and is still balanced toward the hops, but it is much easier on the palate than its brother, the original Bastard.  Opinion: As I prefaced in my review, I really enjoy this version of the Bastard. It is definitely one of the better hop-balanced beer out there, IMO. There is so much going on here that it is a little surprising that it is only 7.2% ABV. At the price I won't be drinking this too regularly, but I must say that if you like the original Bastard, you have to give this version a try as it takes an already good beer up a notch.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Oaked Arrogant looks much the same as regular Arrogant. Dark golden coloring with a nice one-and-a-half finger, eggshell white head. Nice lacing on the sides with a ring of alc. feet as well. Looks like a good brew.  Aroma is likewise similar but the outrageous hop profile in the regular offering is a bit muted in this one. Still sending the grapefruit and other citrus flavors. Maybe slight malts and a little oak? It's very subtle if it's really there.  Oak is more apparent in the drink. Lots of hops come through the back of the drink but the fronted is pretty nice. Some roasted and caramel malt notes. Less citrus character and hop bite. It's a more accessible version, for sure. Finish is a bit dry but not too long. A little heat presence.  Mouthfeel is status-quo. Thin-medium body with appropriate carbonation. Not particularly smooth.  Again, this is more accessible and easier-drinking than standard Arrogant.

A lot of the sweet malts emanate as well  Taste:  Good amount of bitterness is the dominance. A mix of citrus and spice hits the roof of the mouth, tongue, and finally the throat. A well balanced bitter aftertaste sticks around for a bit  Mouthfeel:  Coats the mouth in a thick, almost chewy, fashion. Hits with authority upon each sip until the very end.  Overall:  A brilliant ale, in my opinion. Full bodied and full flavored. It has a spicy hop kick that is unmatched... at least in the ale's that ive tasted",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,thebrood1987,4.88,I'm a big fan of their original Arrogant Bastard so I had to try this one. On the first smell I get a smoked sweet oak scent with some pine and citrus from the hops. It starts off with the smokey oak sweetness mixing in with the regular roasted thick almost caramel like malts they normally use in the original version. The oak is pretty strong in the middle of the taste which sticks around on the middle of the tongue just as long as the bitterness from the hops stick around on the back of the tongue. It's pretty rich and has a thick mouthfeel and could pass for an Imperial beer easily with the richness and body that it has. I love how Stone hops their beers they never fail me when I'm looking for that hop punch. They aren't a one trick pony though and this beer proves it. They incorporated the oak flavor so well in this that it makes an already amazing beer even better and more complex. You won't be disappointed if you are a fan of their beers... this might even turn out be your favorite from them.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Faint scents of hop flowers mixed with slightly woody aromas hint at the Oaked flavor promised on the label.  The head very slowly recedes, leaving large, sticky trails of foam along the sides of the glass. An intense reddish brown color with just a light haziness, the brew is well carbonated and presents a thick layer of foam until the last sip.  A mouthful reveals the smoky oak flavor as advertised, with a soft citrus edge bolstered by a generous grain bill with a hint of toffee sweetness and bitter hazelnut notes. Strong hop presence with lingering bitterness leaves you feeling worthy. Robust and intimidating, it delivers the wallop of a big beer with some style.

147,8951,ehammond1,4.38,"Bottle (2011)  Holiday Wine Cellar Escondido, CA  A very dark ruby and near brown, dark orange edges, with a large light brown head that stays and stays. Sheets and rings of lacing line the glass. A gorgeous beer. I expected this pour to be exactly similar to the Arrogant Bastard I had last night. The bottles were only a few weeks apart in bottling, poured the same way, in to the same clean glass. This one though has a monstrous and persistent head when the traditional AB hardly had one at all. Interesting.  The first thing I notice in the nose is the sweet caramel malt amidst an enveloping aroma of citrus hops. The sweetness is the star of the show and the caramel really comes through predominantly. The alcohol is a bit more present here than in the traditional AB.  Very similar to the original Bastard, and by that I mean: ""Plenty of citrus hops, loads of bitterness, sweet caramel and bready malts, the faintest hint of alcohol."" What I do find here that I don't in the original is a hint of vanilla that complements this strong ale very nicely.  Moderate to heavy in the mouth. Plenty of carbonation.

Dark coloring with a light head give this beer the attitude that lives up to its name. The great hoppiness that comes from the hopheads at Stone give this a flavor you want to come back to.

Taste is similar to the nose. Malt backbone comes on strong with plenty of bready malt, brown sugar, and toffee. Mild citrus fruit sweetness.

Nose is very fresh wood, like standing next to an oak tree and scratching it. Arrogant Bastard base is almost second fiddle to that woody aroma, but the citrus hops and caramel malts are still there though somewhat feint.  Taking a sip, still very oak dominated. I believe this is aged a bit on oak chips, which provides a very dominant and fresh woody flavor that doesn't quite suit my tastes. Still a nice grapefruit pith hop bitterness under all that wood, with some dark caramel malts coming through near the finish. However, the wood is the main flavor.  Medium bodied, slick and oily mouthfeel, with just enough light carbonation to keep your tongue from being tarred with wood juice. Finish is a long and lingering fresh oak with light grapefruit peel bitterness. Fairly easy to drink, if you can get past how wooden this version of the Bastard is.

I definitely get some hops as well, but those are really smoothed out by the oak character. I can definitely tell this beer has been mellowed a bit by the oaking.  Taste: Toasted malts and caramel, as well as some cherry-like fruits. A good amount of hops on the back end, as well as a pleasant amount of oakiness. Like I said before, the oak really smooths this beer out a lot, especially compared to its bretheren.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is slightly under medium bodied with nice fine carbonation.

147,8951,Scotchboy,3.65,"Stone Oaked Arrogant Bastard  I'm sure this isn't the freshest bottle. 120z poured into a NB globe.  Pours a murky hazy brown with an off-white or light khaki head. Sediment was visible on the pour. Head retention wasn't great but a quick swirl always revived it, and lacing was superb.  I'm surprised by how well the hops are shining thru still. On the nose it's pungent and astringent, very aromatic in an earthy way. There is definitely some sweetness in the middle too, not sure if I would classify it as 'woody' or 'oaky' but it's definitely a touch sweet, with a hint of brown sugar or molasses, with a little raisin and date character as well. The caramel malts are there too.  My first impression when I taste it, is this thing has a good mouthfeel. The crisp carbonation hits the front of your tongue, moves it's way back through your mouth and preps your palette for the hop bitterness, which arrives promptly thereafter. Not a ton of bite, just enough to let you know it's there. It's a bit oily and coats your mouth in a nice way. There is a touch of dark fruit and nuttiness, that reminds me of something between a quad and a brown ale. I think the oak is there, the dryness on the tip of my tongue tastes wood-like. Spicy and earthy.  It would say overall it definitely has some woody flavors. The more I sipped, the more those 'earthy' qualities seemed like they could easily by oak and oak chip characteristics.  Somewhere on the medium side of drinkability. The slight bitterness does linger, and while not bad it isn't my favorite aftertaste.  Overall I wouldn't look for this beer again, but the fact that most reviewers said thatthis beer had massive hop presence, and the fact that my bottle is both older and hasn't been refrigerated, leads me to think I'll be buying a fresh bottle someday to re-review.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

There is also a underlying woody taste from the oak aging. It finished with a malty hop aftertaste.. the hop bitterness lingered in my mouth for a short while after the beer was swallowed.

First sip hints at boldness, but oak aging smooths it out nicely, all components of scent are there aggressively, but aging has allowed them to smooth out and increase drinkability. Soft on the palate, medium bodied, slightly dry. A very nice beer which showcases what oak aging can do to a beer as big as the Bastard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,HarrisonDean,4,"Reviewed on 10/20/2009  While Arrogant Bastard Ale is becoming fairly common, one of its siblings, the oaked version, is still beneath the radar. This is essentially the same beer, but it is aged in oak casks, a process which imparts wonderful flavors and mellows the body. Oaked Arrogant Bastard pours beer-bottle brown in color with red highlights, letting little light through. The head is very frothy, vanilla in color, and leaves sheets of lacing on the glass. The aroma is subdued, with citrusy hops and sweet, spicy vanilla all amidst a mellow aged oak base.  This beer is very well balanced, appeasing an aggressive hopping with sweet malts and sour fruit esters. The woody oak flavor serves to relax the tension between the mighty flavors at odds. Each sip leaves a dry, bitter hop flavor on the tongue with the more cautious oak surrounding. The back of your throat reminds you of the past sweet vanilla malts and invites another sip. I would recommend checking out the Oaked version of the Bastard, but definitely check out Arrogant Bastard first.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,jayhawk73,4.47,"First time trying this beer.. Pours a medium dark brown w/ a thin off white head that quickly disappears. The smell is fantastic- Caramel, Hops, malt. It smells like a Stone beer. Wow, I'm looking forward to trying this. OK- The taste is even better! The Oak makes itself known here, along w/ malt, and a big hop presence. Maybe a little grapefruit in there too. Amazing how balanced this beer is, how everything works together for an amazing result. Mouthfeel is smooth, yet the hops give a bite to the feel. Balanced in perfect harmony. This is super easy to drink as well. I could down several of these before the 7.2% ABV kicked in. Just like everything else I've had from Stone, this beer doesn't disappoint. In fact, I would have to put this in the World Class category. Fantastic Beer. Will definitely pick this one up again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Head was kind of meh at first but after it warmed and I aggitated it poofed up good and the lacing was nice. Smelled good, but not quite as fragrant as the non oaked AB. Tasted incredible.. I LOVE arrogant bastard but with the oak it feels so interesting on the tongue.. It feels as though I was placing chips of wood on either side of the back of my tongue. Thats a good thing! Very interestingly dry on the finish. I love a dry finish on an IPA but this was a different thing altogether. Don't ask me why but at 7.2 abv this beer (just like the original AB) are REALLY easy to drink for me, I just want it in my belly NOW.  Try them both - the Arrogant Bastard and the Oaked.

Appearance: The body has a reddish or garnet color with a haze. Its head is off white, about an inch tall and long lasting. A thin cap is maintained to the last sip and lacing is very good.  Smell: In the nose I get a big hit of citrus and piney hops with a bready malty base backed by an earthy woody note.  Taste/Palate: On the tongue there are loads of grapefruit and lemony citrus with some piney notes near the finish. This sits on top of a solid malty bready base with some caramel sweetness seeking in as well as a touch of dry oak. The finish is long and filled with hop bitterness and dry oak.

S- Cherry aroma is first, followed by earthy and oaky notes.  T- Tastes somewhat like cherry pitts, nice and sweet. Oak flavors and flower petals add a nice herbal flavor. Some hoppiness detected in the background.  M- Very smooth, slightly astringent. Medium bodied brew. Almost no carbonation.  D- Easily drinkable, goes down easy.

I bought the beer and many others to ship home but I couldn't help trying this one the night I purchased it. Used the water glass in the hotel room.  Poored a nice clear amber/brown color similar to root beer with light tan head that dissipated early. Nice lacing on the glass.  Smell is sweet caramel malts, floral hops, and oak. Very well balanced smell.  Taste has a nice hop bitterness that balances the sweetness very well. I also pick up the oak and carmel in the middle before the citrus and piney hops comes back at the end.  Great carbonation level and mouthfeel makes this very drinkable but not really a session beer.

Maybe a hint of vanilla?  T - powerful! Subtle grassy hops is dominated by a combined powerful bready/caramel malt and something else, it'd be too easy to say woody, but it is hard to place. Enduring bitterness (hops popping back out the other side?)  M - moderately heavy but not cloying or coating the mouth. Mild carbonation. The bitter character really sticks in the back of the throat and keeps going. Mildly warming alcohol.

T- Nice malt flavor at the start with a bitter woodiness in the middle and to the finish. Not much hop flavor but there is some floral hop flavor involved as well. Maybe a touch of vanilla from the woodiness but not a whole lot. There is a nice smokey oak finish at the end though that has a little of the hop bitterness lingering along with it.

T: citrusy, grapefruit hops are perfectly balanced by solid but not overly sweet malt. The alcohol in the smell is almost nonexistent in the flavor. Once the hops dissipate, the smoky wood covers the palate and sticks around.

It smells of bitter citrus hops and has a light sweet maltiness to it. There is also a good and strong presence of oak, earthiness, and light smoke. It's definitely a slight upgrade to the AB. The flavors consist of mild hop bitterness to pair with a whole ton of earthiness followed by a nice and subtly sweet malt backbone. There's a lot of wood, dirt, tree bark going on yet in a pleasant manner. There are also light vanilla accents. It drinks exceptionally smooth and medium bodied. It leaves behind an appealing oaky/vanilla bitter hop flavor in the after taste. I find this to be much more appealing than the original AB. It has a lot more character.

Not really carbonated except for a stream of bubbles coming straight up from the bottom center of the glass.  S: Not sure if I'm smelling this right after looking at other reviews, but kind of fruity, maybe currants. Not really any hop aroma for me. A sniff halfway through the glass reveals some wood scent.  T: Great blend of hop bitterness and malts up front. The hop bitternes lingers on the edges of the tongue. A definite woodiness and vanilla comes through as well, which greatly smooths it out, especially compared to the un-oaked version.  F: Great mouthfeel. Exactly what I love to drink. Not syrupy, but it deifnitely has some weight on the tongue. Almost not carbonation tingliness.

I really believe that all the different beers that incorporate Oak, Rum or other type of wooden barrels make a distinct point.

The bitterness lingers and grows.  Well carbonated, rich full body, medium viscosity, bitter finish that lingers.  I'm sure I've had this before, but it's been a while, I think. I've never been all that impressed by any of the Bastards. But I used to drink my beers too cold, and maybe they were old or something? Whatever, I'm impressed now.

Oak isn't very prevalent, but is slightly noticeable in the finish/aftertaste with light notes of vanilla and butter.  M: Medium body, alcohol well hidden.

Very herbal and slightly astringent. I had one from the pack fresh, so I know they were fine when I got them. I think this might be a little early for this one. Slightly sweet and reminiscent of some fruit I can't put my finger one, its hard to get past the crushed aspirin bitterness.  M: Highly carbonated with a medium body.

Some brown sugar as well. Maybe touches of vanilla and even more faint oaky woodiness, but nothing really would make me think this was an oaky beer. Good mix of malt and hops.  T - Like the nose suggested, there is a big caramel malt and brown sugar backbone. Has some citrus, particularly grapefruit, hoppy flavors, but it is more bitter/astringent grapefruit rather than a slightly sweet juicy flavor. Has some of the piny flavors toward the finish. Again a faint vanilla and oaky flavor but nothing overly strong. A bit of a minty/herbal finish.  M - Medium body with average carbonation. Very smooth almost slick feel.

The oaked ale has a weaker smell, I guess I lot of the hoppiness faded during the aging. That doesn't really leave that much smell, just some slightly spicy breadiness. The taste is pretty similar to the regular ale: a lovely bready hop flavour. The oaked version is a little drier with some extra woodiness.

Taste: It opens with a prodigious and delicious malt base, but quickly segues into oily hops, bread crust, and the faintest touch of brandy.

M- a bit above medium in body and a bit less in carb. Semi dry tannic finish.  D- the first time I had this beer it was so woody I was barely able to drink it now after many years and many oak aged beers I can deal with this level of wood.

The dissipating head also left lacy patterns running along the edges of the glass. A light amount of carbonation is visible. S: There are moderate aromas of pine resin hops in the nose along with some hints of oak. T: Flavors of roasted malts and accompanied by a moderate amount of bitterness; there are notes of oak in the finish. M: It feels medium-bodied and crisp on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.

Notes of oak and vanilla are present as well. Very bourbon-like. Full bodied with little carbonation but not so syrupy as to detract much from the drinkability. Not much different from the original bastard until you describe the palate. The oak hits you up front and almost drowns out the nice malt that, in my opinion, makes the unoaked version so great. Not bad though. Just a different character. The hops still come through strong on the finish but not as quickly or aggressively as the original. The oak lingers with the hops through the finish so you are left with a honey sweetness with a touch of bitterness instead of a wave of palate searing hoppy resin. This gives it a cleaner feel, making it easier to drink. I like this more than I remember. Maybe as much as the original.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Very imposing. Good couple finger creamy froth head. The refined hoppy bitterness tastes like the traditional Arrogant Bastard Ale sans the Oak, but after some more tinkering to iron out the kinks. Thins out a bit after aspiration and hoppiness-to-mellow sweetness balance starts to shift towards sweetness. Citrusy notes of grapefruit rind are apparent, as is a mild caramely sweetness. Mid-range carbonation. Complex but patient and not overpowering mouthfeel, a little on the heavy side. No unduly lingering bitterness.

I like the regular Arrogant and the Double was way too yeasty so I can't wait to taste this brew  A - Pours a semi dark hazy amber with a nice half inch of head. Caked sediment in the bottom of my bottle may suggest a old bottle. Lacing looks awesome.  S - Really funky the oak and hops smell pretty strong almost woodsy. Slight caramel sweetness on the nose.  T - Wow that's pretty balanced. Starts off hoppy and bitter then the oak kicks in almost faintly kicks the bitterness down a notch and oaky wood flavors pretty strong yet smooth. Finishes sweet but not too sweet making me take another sip to re-evaluate. Impressive!  M - Medium bodied. Kind of dry but smooth.  D - Well I can see what the base was in lucky bastard! The oaking of this beer really takes it to the next level and makes me want to mix it with the regular Bastard. A very good bastard of a beer! BTW single was 3.75 but if I was able to get a sixer for under 15 bucks I would pick it up.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

T - The taste is balanced, somewhat mellow but nice. Not really a strong presence of oak, but the time in the barrel seems to have taken off some of the rough edges. The hops are apparent, but not overpowering, little bit a sweetness on the tip of your tongue. M - Mouthfeel is slightly heavy, but not syrupy. D - All around very drinkable beer.

S: Really nice smell. I wasn't expecting to smell the woodiness of it, but you can. Also can pick up the alcohol smell with hints of caramel and a bit of vanilla.  T: Very good. It does taste like standard Arrogant Bastard, with a lot more complexity. You can taste the oak. High hop flavor with a bit a lot of bitterness. Good malt flavor, but it plays second fiddle to the other flavors. Aftertaste will stick with you! The bottle says that they used American oak. I wonder what it would be like with French oak?  D: I wouldn't drink this with any lightly favored meal, or switch to another beer, but on it's own it is very drinkable!

S: Oak and hops up front for sure. There's the faintest whiff of alcohol, and perhaps a small amount of caramel malt.  T: Wow. Intensely bitter with hops abound. A fresher bottle may have yielded more grapefruit as some reviews say. Oak plays a part and dances well with the malt profile. Definitely Stone's take on this style. (both regular and Oaked)  F: My favorite part of this beer. Silky creamy as it gives a nice full mouthfeel. Even large sips go down easily. I prefer this to the regular.

A very dry taste, and not a lot of oak flavor. This finishes with full hop bitterness, but without a spice, or floral, or fruit taste that makes other hoppy ales so appealing. Nothing memorableon the tongue, and this has a very low drinkability for me due to the dry and mustyness of the beer. This has a good look and feel, but does not otherwise impress me.

The color is a reddish mahogany with about 3/4 inch of medium tan head that had decent retention and lacing. The harsh aromas and flavors of standard AB are soften with the time on the oak.  The woody scent masks some of the hop sharpness, but those hops still show through on the tongue. The body is much smoother and thus more enjoyable.

T- Its just hop domination start to finish, the well aged cheddar note comes through for me in the beginning but the sharpness of the grapefruit like hops overpower and dominate into the lingering dry finish. Malt hasnt a hope.  M- Medium body and high carbonation.  D- Its just not enjoyable for me. I understand this style is very hop focussed but this is just flat out hop domination.

Tastes sweet from abundant malts with strong bitterness, particularly on the finish. A little booze. I didn't pick up on any wood whatsoever.  The mouth feel was sharp and not at all smooth like I would expect from a barrel-aged beer.  I did not want another when I was done. I switched to something else.  What a huge disappointment.

Mounds of tan and rocky cranium, along with a copper colored body that has a mild haze to it.  The aroma is spruce, toffee, and a hint of that woody oak.  Taste wise it has a strong backbone of caramel and toffee qualities, and has a great clean blast of piny hops.

This beer leaves great lacing as well. Looks exceptional.  S-Great hoppiness erupts from the beer. I am actually finding this version to be a bit hoppier in the nose. The deep malty undertones mix great with the sneaky oak notes.  T-I find that the oak completely adds a new dimension to such a great beer. I do indeed enjoy the oaked version of Arrogant Bastard more. The hops are mixed with some luscious caramel maltiness. I get some slick vanilla flavor. The woodiness really enhances the flavor in my opinion. A hint of candied cherry is there too, which I find in all Arrogant Bastard versions. Quite complex and delicious.  M-Great slickness. Does the oakiness enhance the mouthfeel? I find it does. Smooth and creamy.  D-I am gulping this single 12 oz. far too fast. Alcohol is masked well. Great drinker.  Of the normal Arrogant Bastard, Oaked Arrogant Bastard, and Double Bastard (I have not tried Lukcy Basartd) I love the Oaked the best. I find it to add some great complexinty.

Very genuine, and although the the cleanest, most perfect beer, it has imperfections which make it perfect.  S- Very malty, smooth, almost with great cologne-like qualities. I could probably get away with wearing this stuff as cologne!  T- Very nice smooth caramel malts. Strong hop backbone and leveraged hop aroma. The oak chips add a considerable luxury class to an already excellent beer.  M- Good carbonation and a very nice bite from the hops. This beer does not feel thin or underwhelming one bit. The hop resins leave a nice feeling and the alcohol is warming.  D- This is too damn good and I could drink this a long time and be a happy man.

Taste- Deep, rich caramelized malt backed with a strong hop bitterness. The oaky sweetness really comes through as you work your way through the glass, vanilla notes.

I honestly cant give this beer enough praise in this category. This beer smells great.  T - The first thing i get is some serious piney hop bitterness that lasts the entire time.

I didn't really expect this to be that different that AB, but the oak really changes this beer more than I expected it would. There's a real lasting quality to the wood on the palate -- this changes the hop character especially because the oak overlays a lot of when the hop bitterness would traditionally come in. A lot of vanilla in the oak finish, too. This is still an aggressive, assertive beer, but it is more balanced and, dare I say, refined than AB.

Yeah, this is a definite beer.  Melony character on the assault, just the front. Gets very rich and malty and surprisingly dark on the mid-palate with barley sugar, burnt toast and a rich chocolatey flavour. Yeah, really oddly dark and bitter even on the mid. Slight freshness comes through though on the back, slight fruitiness from some heavy hopping. Underlying it all is a nice woodiness that goes equally well with that odd dark richness and the fresh flavour hopping. Not heavy-handed, just nice and complementary. A really quite intriguing palate, good beer.  Not bad texture, feels oddly thin at times but has a noticeable body on the mid. Thinness comes largely at the back but it just allows it to go down very easily.  Very tasty beer; slightly odd and slightly rich at times.

147,8951,alkemy,4.38,"Poured a hazy, deep mahogany with a finger of thick cream colored head. It looks the part of a pretty substantial beer. The hops come across in a fragrant, floral manner. There's also a hint of grapefruit along with a biscuity malt with a hint of spiciness. This spiciness (kind of a nutmeg/pumpkin combo) shows itself more in the taste. In the taste, the citrus is more of an orange intermingling with pine. You also get a woody, earthy twang on the back end. Maybe just a hint of vanilla as well. Pretty rich and creamy feel. The alcohol really doesn't show itself. I'm thoroughly impressed by this one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Mosstrooper,4.72,"Poured from 12oz bottle into 330mL St. Bernardus chalice.  Appearance: Pours a dark mahogany color with a medium tanned head that dissipates slowly and leaves behind a thick ring of lace.  Smell: A load of citric hops, along with the usual Arrogant Bastard tea-like and toasty aromas, but has a bit of a mustier note all-round.  Taste: Begins well-rounded: the usual AB flavors of citrus, tea-sweetness, and citrus are there. The finish is similarly flowery yet sweet compared to regular old Arrogant Bastard. However, this brew seams a bit mustier, with more subdued hops and with a woody taste replacing the lost hop flavor.  Mouthfeel: Heavier in body with balanced carbonation and a dry finish.  Drinkability: This is basically the same as Arrogant Bastard, however, the taste of the beer yields more of a balanced flavor profile than it's inspiration. Just as drinkable as AB, but a bit more savory.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,treyrab,4.18,"I have had this multiple times. Very close to its non oak aged brother.  Pours a clear New Orleans Saints gold with a solid white head. Smell is definitely much drier than the non oak aged version. Tons of pine hops, grass, and hints of fresh medium-toast oak. Taste is nice bitter pine hops as well as the dry medium-toast oak. Not much caramel or underlying malt qualities. I prefer this to the non oak version A) because I really like how much drier this is due to the oak and B) this is a little more hop-forward than the other version.  Overall, a great beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Estocker,4.13,"Pours a nice dark cherry mahogany color. Beautiful glass, nice head and lacing.  Smells great, a nice bouquet of citrusy hops with a ton of caramely malt to back it up.  Taste is similar to the nose, but the wood chips come into play. It seems to be a lot smoother than the regular AB. Im not sure if it's because it's been aged slightly or because of the wood in it but it drinks a lot easier, not as harsh.  Drinkability is good up until I finish the glass, at that point I feel very content but can no longer continue.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

S - Woody and fruity. I smell passion fruit or grapefruit, along with some pine maybe? The aroma is intense, and one of the best parts of this brew.  T - Awesome. A hint of booze makes its way through, which adds to the beer significantly. I taste fruit and wood mostly. Strong malts for that bread aftertaste, and super strong hops. This baby is BITTER, which is just the way I like it!  M - Silky smooth. Perfect amount of carbonation. Dry finish. Like I said, this brew is bitter, and it sticks around. Have you ever eaten 80% cocoa dark chocolate? Think about how that made your mouth feel, and apply it to this beer.  D - Pretty easy to drink, but I wouldn't want more than one over the course of a night. Did I mention it tastes delicious?  This is one of my favorite beers ever. It is fantastic. The non-oaked version is also fantastic. DEFINITELY recommended, but you have to like a strong beer which is damn bitter.

A perfect example of a great looking beer.  S- a nice sweet bourbon roasted malt scent with some sweet brown sugar undertones. A nice piney hop bitterness lingers in the background.  T- hard to describe perfection. A big robust hoppy awesomeness with a strong dry malt back end. Great earthy pine hop bitterness just makes you want to keep gulping this bad boy down.  M- very crisp and menacing. So bitter, but yet so smooth. Has a slight linger on the tip of your tongue, but not anything unpleasant  D- for those ""worthy"", this is a very drinkable beer. So smooth, yet big and bold.  This beer is not for everyone. If you want a friendly amber or smooth golden ale, do not try it.

A little bit of pepper and maybe burnt cinnamon.  Tastes a full flavored bitterness with dark fruit and a peppery connotation. A slight licorice buzz to it. It's got a lot of flavor and it changes as it warms in the glass. The oak helps smooth it out a little from the original AB or the DB.  The bitterness kind of jumps out at you when paired with the carbonation. The first sip is definitely a wake up.  This is a delicious beer, and drinkability is not a problem as long as you stick to one or a couple.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

There is a dense tan foam with thick walls of lacing. Very nice looking beer.  Smell: Mango, mild pine & grapefruit, and a hint of malt sweetness. As the beer warms up you can start to smell some oak wood, but the hops still dominate.  Taste: Mango, pine, and grapefruit hoppiness is strong up front, followed by a quick malt sweetness and then a sharp and lingering bitter finish. Quite nice.  Mouthfeel: Despite lots of bubbles coming up through the beer, there is very little carbonation on the tongue. The beer is smooth and thick otherwise.  Drinkability: This is a potent brew - very strong in flavor but enjoyable. Went well with Chili and cornbread, and I could see myself having this alone. The higher alcohol is well hidden making this beer a bit dangerous, but with such strong flavors, I'm enjoying it, but my tastebuds need a rest after one.

This beer really lives up to the name... it's so complex and delightful that it's hard to describe with anything other than a well-done kitchen sink of dark ale... smells of alcohol/chocolate/fig/cinnamon... and bites so chewy that I have lock-jaw.. the hops are booming in their presence here and this beer is big, bold, and beee-u-ti-ful!

Right off the bat this pours like heavens nectar. Absolutely gorgeous ruby red with head like some cosmic cappuccino. Smell is so mellow and inviting I can't wait to dive in to the oak and tempered hops within.  One of the most noteworthy aspects of this beer is how easy it would have been to screw it up. ""Oaking"" itself has been a very hit-or-miss fad recently, but Stone has pulled it off here so successfully I can't help but tip my hat to Russian River - perhaps the only American brewer to consistently give this often finicky flavor its due.

S-Reminds me of the Burton Baton from DFH. Piney, orangey hops, deep sweet malts, brown sugar and caramel.  T/M-This beer seems to be in transition. It's not fresh, so the hops, while still providing some bitterness and structure, are dropping out in terms of complexity of flavor. However, it's not quite old enough to be ready. There is a promising candied fruit flavor coming through the malts, but it's nowhere near its potential.  D-I have to qualify this. I think it's a fantastic beer fresh.

Beneath, the beer is hazy and medium brown in colour.  Smell - 4.5 A sweet and pleasant aroma of burnt sugar, ripe orange and orange peel, pine needles, vanilla oak and peppery alcohol.  Taste - 4.0 Malty in a way that reminds of fudge and brown sugar with a pleasant back-note of vanilla from the oak. Intensely hoppy, bursting with flavours of grapefruit, citrus peel, spice and mint. Aggressive bitterness lingers in the bone dry finish. A fair whack of peppery, alcoholic heat somewhat detracts from the experience.  Mouthfeel - 4.0 Medium to full-bodied with lively, fine carbonation.  Drinkability - 4.0 I wouldn't want more than one of these at a time, but it is quite easy to drink.  OVERALL - 4.2 A very big, tasty ale. In a way I think it is a little too big, with the flavours clashing and overwhelming rather than complementing each other.

Taste - Much like regular bastard, rye, hoppy kick with alcohol backbone. With this beer though, has a musky oak flavor to it, kinda smokey flavor. Actually makes the beer more solid and drinkable. The oat aged mellowed out the hops and malts, making it easier to taste the spices and yeast.  Mouthfeel - Its thin in mouth, and strong enough to warm it up. Has some bitterness to it that works out the palette. Bitter aftertaste last long on tounge  Drinkabilty - This is very nice. Enjoyed the oaked flavor. Its strong enough that 2-3 is enough.

The bit of age mellows the hoppiness I'm used to and replaces it with some interesting and complex aromas of fruit, caramel malt, toffee, and brandy. hints of sherry and a surprisingly present hop.  Taste is rich and decadent. full of complex flavors. While I love the hop-heavy punch this one packs fresh, the complexities that come through with a bit of age makes me truly appreciate it. Raisins, caramel malt, molasses, toffee. figs and port. A touch of oak, more than I can pull out fresh. Time does this one good.  Mouth suffers a bit, I'm assuming from its age. A touch thin and watery, but ample carbonation carries well. It's not tepid by any means... still full and vivacious. Thick and almost syrupy were it not for the carbonation.

147,8951,EwaldEichstaett,4.43,"got a 6er of this a while back in Chicago.  Dark brown with some ruby highlights. The head is decent size and the lacing is great throughout.  Smells like thick malts, there are roasted and sweet notes. I pick up a bit of honey. There are also some spicy hops present.  The taste is great! Oaked it is. The woody flavour melds well with the extra thick malty body. The hops exist as well, but they serve to bring a nice balance to the beer. The malts are where it is at.  Mostly smooth and a bit creamy feel to the beer. The carbonation is quite delicate but very pleasant. The beer is drinkable for the style. You might tip over after a few though. This is probably my favourite American Strong Ale to date.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Oak and fruity hop tones to the nose, honey and sugar. Complex, confident and complete.  A very nice, infinitely pleasant oaken beer. Not at all over the top.

The color is a glorious clear brown-red with a touch of orange when held up to the light, much like a red ale, but way more legendary. The aroma is light in hops, light in oak, but the headturner here was the tropical fruits I smelled: guava and starfruit. They were surprising to me, and took me about 3 straight minutes of smelling to narrow down specific fruit smells. I'm not experienced enough to know if this tropical smell comes from fruits or hops, but it is definitely what I'm smelling. I don't taste the fruits, but I taste bitter hops with a little oak, and a small sting on the tongue from the carbonation. This beer sticks slightly on the mouth. This does not taste like a 7.2% beer, and I would definitely consider this a session beer for myself, so excuse me while I crack open bottle #2.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Pours a near black color with an inch thick head that lasts quite a long time with really nice lacing.  Taste is pretty similar to regular AB as well, although I do notice a couple of things that are different. First, the sweet, caramel malt is a little smoother and seems to have a small vanilla component to it. Secondly, the pine hops are certainly there from the get-go and throughout the beer, but they definitely last into the aftertaste with a potent aspirin bitterness. However, smooth sweetness remains in the mouth as well.  Either way, it's as good as the regular version. A little bit different, but not that much.

Nose is a heavenly mix of bourbon like oak, vanilla, tannins, and the hops that make the regular AB what it is. I like the mix, it worked well.  Unfortunately, the oak really does not come out in the taste. All I really get is your typical Arrogant Bastard taste, the harsh bitterness from their hops, and some malt. I am a bit disappointed in the taste.  Mouthfeel is light on the tongue, but has a decent amount of body attached. Pretty good mouthfeel.

The malt really takes a back seat, as does the oak. There is a bit of sweetness in the finish but it is definitely shadowed by the hops. This is good, but not outstanding.  M: Medium thick on body, carbonation seems fine for the brew. Fairly oily as it leaves your mouth.  D: Good but I was hoping for a bit more balance.

Basically, I feel that the Bastard is already a full-throttle beer and the oak-aging is wasted on it. Sure, the oak is present (and it's drying, woody character does help to tone down and smooth the beast a bit), but does it really help to improve the character of the beer? I'd say not. It's different, but it's not better. And there's just too much going on to really enjoy the character of the wood (although it is oak-chips, right?). Good, but not great.

A - Almost crystal clear, a very light haze forms over the crimson-amber-colored brew. A brilliant tan head rose quickly to three-fingers and lowered very slowly leaving brilliantly thick patchy lace on the glass.  S - Strong roasted malts with a healthy draping of caramel and a beefy addition of hops as well; floral notes predominantly. The oak chips appear nicely although a bit subdued at this point. The balance is nice for the age (which, for a strong ale, I believe to be fine - especially when refrigeration kept as it was).  T - Very solid balance across the board, it's got a nice backing of malty, caramel, and toasted notes backing up a hoppy profile mixed with resin and pine needle. The oak is lost a little, but still adds a subtle complexity that's not all forgotten.  M - Malty and hoppy, Oaked AB is medium-full bodied, smooth starting, and bitter finishing. A nice resin flavor carries through with a hint of wood.  D - This can age well. Still doing good 'past it's prime', it's a fantastic beer with great balance and a nice finish.

Herbal/pine hop flavors begin to appear in the middle with toasted oak and some spicy rye and mustard flavors from the interaction of the hops and dark malt. Finishes with dark caramel malt flavors as well as molasses and some cola notes. Strong bitterness balances out the significant malt and there is a hint of smoky, roasted grain that lingers with some cigar tobacco flavor and a slight hint of vanilla.  M - Medium-thick body, moderate carbonation, and a slightly sweet finish.  D - This beer has an interesting character that becomes quite complex in the finish and aftertaste. There are some nice, barleywine like notes from the interaction of the significant hop character with the dark malts and the lingering tobacco/smoke flavors are quite nice. My only complaint is that the oak character is quite subtle, when it seems like the beer would have held up to a much more intense oak character. I get a some oak in the aroma as the beer warms, but there is little woody taste.

This is a very good example of how oak should smell in a beer. T/M: With the full body, this beer shows a complexity of flavors. At first the presences of a honey sweetness, then turns to a both and rich mouthfeel of chewy oak. The brew then leaves a bold lingering taste of malts and the dryness of hops. While the hops add a dry sensation, there is also the wood that brings it upon the palate as well. The lingering finish shows the heat of the wood, with a warm whiskey feeling.

Very pretty to look at.  Smell: As a lover of Arrogant Bastard, I immediately upon smelling this knew it was something significantly different. The pineyness from the hops is still there, but it isn't in your face like the regular Bastard. The oak chips change it significantly, and I noticed hints of toffee, caramel, and almost a ripened fruit quality to the nose. It's quite pleasant.  Taste: This is what sets it apart from the regular Arrogant Bastard. The hops are still there, and the rush up to the palate, but they aren't harsh, nor biting. They come at you very smoothly, and stay with you on the palate. Other flavors that may be lost in the un-oaked come through, with hints of vanilla, caramel, toffee, raisins, and fruits. The malts come in slightly to take away the bitterness, but only slightly, and then the hops come back again, for a wonderful dry hoppy finish.  Mouthfeel: Very pleasant, thick but not too thick, just a perfect balance and not too watery. Carbonation is just spot on, and gives a nice prickliness to the beer, as it dances across the palate.  Drinkability: I find this to be quite drinkable, and would certainly be a pleasant beer to have on hand to enjoy with a dinner.

The head is like the crema on a well made Americano.  Unsurprisingly, due to the age, the aroma does not showcase aggressive hops any longer; floral, faint pineapple and pine, yes. Also vanilla, brown sugar, diacetyl, orange oil, alcohol.  Characteristic Arrogant Bastard brown sugar, diacetyl (English yeast), and bitter alcohol. The finish is heavy lingering bitterness with hints of pine and grapefruit pith. What the oak (and age) seem to have done is smooth and integrate, add a tinge of oak and vanilla. This does score a solid 4 for taste, but extra fuss, money, etc do not seem justified for this beer over the classic Bastard.  Smooth, heavy mouthfeel with a glorious carbonation level.

A vigorous pour yields a fat inch and a half thick head that's super fluffy and dissipates slowly, leaving a ton of sticky lacing. The brew itself is a translucent dark reddish amber hue. Smell is a bit different from the regular Bastard. There are piney notes, but they are subdued and not quite as prevalent. Caramel malts are still there along with a unique earthy undertone that I can only assume are the oak chips. Still a very nice thing to sniff.  The piney bite is still there in the initial sip and it still yields into a hoppy bitterness that prevails everywhere. However, the oak chips temper the pines and the bitterness, mellowing the flavor and making the entire tasting experience decidedly more pleasant than the regular Bastard. It's still plenty bitter and the hops ride with you into the aftertaste, but I can actually pick out the very subtle caramel malts and fruit nuances. Mouthfeel is still solid, with a good amount of carbonation and heft.  For me, this is far, far more drinkable than the regular Bastard. The oak chips have mellowed the bitterness to a point where it's actually tolerable and I can fully enjoy the complexity of the beer without being overwhelmed.

147,8951,allforbetterbeer,4,"Poured into a crystal goblet, freshness date marked (though not clearly) on bottle. Cap tells me that I am not worthy.  Pours with minimal head but leaves a bit of lace behind. Body is charred brown when viewed in low light, and transforms into a amber-garnet gem when held up to light. Crystal clear.  Nose is melted toffee swimming with raisins, currents, and brown sugar lumps. Very sugary and sweet, past the point of ripe fruit. Wow. This bottle is older, perhaps almost a year since it was bottled, but it has been in a cooler in the store since then. I expect that the hops will have faded some and produced more fruitiness and sugar-sweet flavors.  The hops are still present, but they are dripping with melted brown sugar. This sweetness is somewhat balanced by the leftover hop bitterness. Other flavors present are toffee, plum, blood orange slices, and possibly a faint hint of cherries.  Mouthfeel is medium and slick from the higher ABV. Goes down with a bit of protest to be leaving the mouth so soon. Overall the drinkability is very good. I keep thinking this is a higher ABV brew because of its complexity, so I have this mental warning about drinking it fast. At 7.2 it isn't a baby, but then isn't going to bury me either.  Conclusion: I have never had original AB, and have never had Oaked AB fresh. This bottle is very good as it is, and I imagine that it would be very good fresh as well. I have never liked Stone brewery, but can't help liking their beers as every one I try is well crafted and tasty.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,gopens44,4.53,"A - Nice color. Deer red, ruby red in fact, with an exciting foamy head that lasts almost as long as the drink when poured into a pint glass. Gentle lacing.  S - I couldn't find much here other than the strong aroma of earthy, piny hops. After the ale had lost about half of it's volume, some more citrus like hints started to show up (or smell up, however it is you say it). I had expected some type of scotch or bourbon type oak hints in the smell, maybe even what you'd observe in a Cabernet, but not so much. Not a problem for me, but figured that the name implied more presence of oak than what was really taking place  T - This is why I love ales. Bitter as an old man scorned by life and women ten times over. The immense level of hops were smoothed over by the oak hints that finally made an appearance. In addition to the oak, the impressive balancing of this brew was made so by a grapefruit presence as well.  M - A touch dry yet very silky and smooth. Very nice  D - Absolutely a delight to drink. Thank you Stone Brewing for this homage to ales!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

The head was about 2 fingers in height and had moderate lacing and retention.  S: A very interesting and complex smelling beer. Some caramel apple, and a little bit of acidity up front, a nice amount of oak in the middle, and then some alcohol heat at the finish.  T: This is pretty much what I expected from having the regular version so many times. The oak aging mellows it out and adds some complexity. The hops are somewhat lost, but still come through a little bit at the finish. I really enjoy the taste of this beer, the layers are wonderful.  M: Nothing stands out to me hear, either negatively or positively. The beer as an appropriate level of carbonation and viscosity.  D: I started drinking this beer with mediocre expectations, but it ended up being pretty good. I wouldn't want to drink several of these in a night, but would be happy to have it again sometime.

S - Citrus hops seem to be the main aroma. There is also a decent amount of malt with some sweetness.  T - Sweet malt is the first thing that comes through and has a candy like taste. This fades quickly and a strong rush of citrus and pine hops flow through.  M - Carbonation is medium and this is a little lighter than most american strong ales I have had.

Smells of hops as well as subtle aromas of alcohol, malts, and wood. Tastes of hops and sweet malt come through strongly with a finish focused on the woody notes. Dry after the finish, but not as much as expected which is nice. Goes down easily.  A very good brew I would have in the middle of a tasting group. It's strong enough to burn out the pallet for white ales, but won't do any damage on the way to an IPA or very malty Stout as a nightcap. Perfect middle of the progression beer.

I think it's time I changed my mind because they brew some amazing things, including the Oaked AB (I think AB should no longer be Anheuser-Busch).  Poured from a bottle two months past its best by date into a pilsner glass. I loved the way this beer looked. Rich reds at the bottom of the glass, and deep brown where you look through more liquid. High clarity. Frothy 3 inch tan head that left great lacing and eventually settled to a half-finger.  Rich malty aroma with raisins and dates occasionally blossoming forth.  Excellent flavor, bit malt backbone with piney bitterness smoothing it out. This reminds me of a strong dark tripel blended with an IPA. The raisin and dates stand out here, just like the nose.  A little undercarbonated for my taste, but the medium body of this beer is spot on for the style.

Slightly sweet malts that suggest a full-bodied experience to me.  The taste is very hoppy, but at the same time not. It's starts out extreme hoppy and then really really quickly switches to maltiness; nearly on the level of a double IPA. I usually hate beers this hoppy but the oak aging mellows the hops enough that I really enjoy this beer. I have to commend Stone for creating a beer that is this hoppy yet has been aged in oak. What a treat indeed.  For some this may be a hard chore to finish, but I pounded mine, almost accidentally. It was about 6 mo old so the hops and alcohol may have been muted compared to fresh off the press examples.

The aroma is a very balanced blend of oak and pine hops and slightly burned caramel.  The flavor is much of the same except of coarse the hefty hefty bitterness that comes like a train. Some sweet bicuit dough as well comes into play. But the pine-y hops I think shine through it all. Along with a woody oak finish to top if off for good measure.  The mouthfeel could not be any creamier, HUGE, yet has a refreshing hoppy bitter finish that lingers forever.  Because of the amount of bitterness in this beer, it is very drinkable.

S: Bouquet of flowers, however, there is a bit of earthiness to it also. On second thought, is that earthiness or staleness?  T: Not the most refreshing thing I've tasted. There is a kind of unsettling, sour taste to this brew. I notice the same thing in the Sublimely Self-Righteous. The finish is nice and smooth though and this, in my opinion, is where the Oaked AB differs from the regular flagship version.

The oak came thru more but the vanilla was gone. Just didn't do much for me and I love the regular version.

Hops are a bit milder than on the regular AB, but there are still some piney and citric notes in there.  Oooh, vanilla and oak flavors really smooth this bastard out. Nice. Plenty of both malt and hops, the former being a bit sweet and very much burnt caramel. Hops are subdued pine resin flavors and a healthy dose of pithy bitterness. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy and coats the mouth easily with oaky goodness.

The flavors seem to come together much better and does not show the same roughness as the unoaked version. This one is pretty smooth and tasty.

Very attractive beer with a rather dense head capping an amber liquid that pushes brown those reds. the etching on the bottom of the SN glass makes a swirl of activity there and full array of bubbles rising. Some heavy lacing and marking of the drink (I'm always a sucker for that). Toasty and sweet malt with a burst of hops blending in nicely. Not as full of an aroma as I anticipated - actually quite subdued, really. A full rich drink - ahh, that's what I was looking for. Small drinks to enjoy this sucker. A variety of flavors start this off (more later), but is finishes big and extended with the bitterness - that pushes biting without ever quite getting there. The oak is so subtle and it blends in so nicely, yet it's not that hard to find if looking for it. The malting is complex, or maybe that's just the whole beer as it all mixes together. For that sake the hopping is complex too. A tasty sweetness up front that is closer to darker fruits - are there moderate fruits...this would fit that bill. The hops hold an initial citrus, then to grassiness before the bitterness becomes prominent. Moderately heavy liquid works with the ample (but not excessice carbonation) to fill the mouth in a lovely manner. Moderate sips are adequate. Drinks big, but more than one could be done in a session. Bitterness subsides some and malt character is enhanced as warms.

The taste if basing from the smell is a smack in the lips. The smell is so smooth and subtle and the flavor is full charge.  Sweet malts, caramel, up front.

147,8951,mfunk9786,4.33,"Reviewing a very tasty beer from Stone. Wegmans' amazing $10.99 make your own six pack offer is opening my eyes to beers that I'd otherwise be reluctant to pay a pretty penny for, this being one of them. Never seen it for less than $16 for a six-pack, and now I know why. This is one hell of a beer, certainly on the level of Ruination IPA and Sublimely Self-Righteous for me, an instant favorite of the Stone lineup.  A: In the words of Ron Burgundy, this beer is a 'rich mahogany' in the glass. Every time you think you can see through it, it seems to aggressively swirl 'round and darken, it's like looking into an optical trap. Pours with a beautiful dark beige head that went right to the tippy top of my Unibroue tulip. Gorgeous beer.  S: A bit threatening. Hop aroma is very pleasant, as well as slightly sweet malts that suggest a full-bodied experience to me. A slight woodsiness is detectable on the nose but not overwhelming the other aromas like a lot of oak aged beers. A very nice aroma, something that I'd like condensed down onto a cardboard tree so I can hang it over my rear view mirror. Pure wonderful beer aroma.  T: The taste is... wow. VERY hoppy, nearly on the level of a double or triple IPA (how an oak aged beer has managed to stay this aggressively hoppy and bitter is beyond me, but I have never experienced an oak aged IPA that has such a fresh hop taste). I guess sweet burnt caramel-y malt and splintery oak flavors are there, but this one's a hop bomb through and through. Yowza.  M: Tingles on the tongue, and totally numbs it up. Dentists should use this one before going in with that huge shot of Novocaine, my mouth is now slack and barely has any feeling left. I'm practically drooling. It's a good thing.  D: It's going to be a bit of a chore to get through more than one bottle, it's certainly not a session beer, but that's not to the detriment of the entire experience, it's just a fact of the matter. It's a very full-bodied beer, especially at 7% ABV, and it should be respected and perhaps even feared. This one has more flavor, body, and character than even Double Bastard. It's excellent.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,cbutova,4.4,"First bottle I have found before the freshness date at five liquor stores, good one MA...  A- Very dark red, some can be seen around the edges, up to the light it is very clear and perfectly red. A foamy light tan cap builds nicely and retains fairly well. Lace covers a majority of the glass and a nice cloud and ring stick behind.  S- Heavy on oak, caramel. Some dark fruit and general hop notes. Much like a Barleywine but older and woodier. Nice and strong.  T- Great stuff. The oak makes this one what it is, it lends great wood notes and vanilla, which ends up tasting sort of like maple. The old caramel malt and dark fruit combine with the hops for a splendid overall flavor. Some alcohol comes into play with warmth.  MF- A bit light/watery. Somewhat creamy though with smooth moderate carbonation and a slight bitter pinch.  DB- The dreaded $17 six-pack, or at least thats what I thought a year ago. That price seems perfectly reasonable now, a well rounded, fulfilling flavor. The hops are the only flaw to me here, but a very small one. The wood and malt are so nice. After some thought, great Strong Ale/Old/Barleywine flavors captured in smooth, drinkable beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Aroma is malty and has lots of sweetness. Brown sugar and caramel dominates. Hops take the backseat but are there. Not sure if I smell any oak.  Taste is super rich. Flavors in the vein of molasses, maple syrup, and caramel dominate. There is definitely some oak in there. Hop bitterness comes in way too late though. This is kinda one dimensional.

Light pine. Anise undertones. All beautifully mixed in with alcohol. I'm also surprised to find a bit of banana in here. Strong butterscotch malt manages to fight all the tropical hoppiness and reveals itself to your nose, incredibly appetizing. Can't wait to taste.  T- Very different from the smell. Fruit changed to honeydew melon and white grapefruit. Lots of grapefruit rind taste and bitterness with a pine and Popsicle stick after-taste.  M- Medium to full mouthfeel. Not dry. Medium and very pleasant in mouth carbonation.  D- Très good. Rough bitterness might get a bit annoying but this is a quality beer. Quite refreshing.  Very good but don't really see what the oak brings other than a tongue depressor finish. I'm not even sure I'd know this was oaked if it wasn't stamped on the bottle.

Body is very slightly cloudy, more cloudy than I remember the normal Arrogant Bastard being.  Its all hops upfront in the aromas. Pine and grapefruit. Maybe some lemon, but an astringent lemon -- like pine-sol. Don;t be fooled - there is a considerable deal of sugary sweet malts, too. Some limited alcohol fusels come and go. A strong ale indeed. You know what? The oak isn't close to dominant here. You can smell the tannic wood but it isn't hitting you over the face with it. Restraint? From Stone? That's true arrogance.  Like its non-oaked brother, this beer exists in the strange borderland where it doesn't taste like an aged double IPA and it doesn't taste like a barleywine. Its malty as heck, sweet and rich, but it doesn't skimp on the floral, flavorful hops. There is sort of a key lime element on the back of my palate that sits on top of the grapefruit flavors. The oak lends a familiar green wood & vanilla flavor but, again, is only a contributing partner to the beer's flavor as opposed to the whole show. Impressive complexity and balance.  My typical preference for hoppy beers is to be light in mouthfeel, and Arrogant Bastard fits that bill. It has moderate-to-high carbonation and is light enough to not punish my tastebuds under all of that malt. Drinkability? Absolutely! This is a damn solid, hoppy beer that I would get down with anytime. I would probably buy this with some regularity if I could.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,Shaon94,4.5,"There are a ton of reviews on how it looks and tastes so here are some other things to keep in mind.  Don't look at the beer as you drink it. It is going to throttle your taste buds and throat as it is, no need to provoke it by trying to stare it down. Remember your not worthy and give the beer the respect it deserves and you will not have any problems. I know some of you laugh, but seriously I think this beer goes down so much better when you are not ""thinking"" about it and just savoring it.  This is not a beer you break out every day. I save it for a particularly hard week. On Friday I will take a bottle pour it and savor it while relaxing. This is not a work week kind of beer IMO.  This is also not a chugging beer, savor every moment (and at almost 3 bucks a bottle you better savor it)  Overall this is one of my all time favorite beers, though for the money, drinking it ALL the time will get expensive.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

This beer is in fine condition, but I don't think aging did it any favors. The smell is definitely melanoidin dominated with woody, earthy contribution from oak. The taste was pronounced caramel and toasted grain with a bracing bitter finish complementing the sweetness. The oak comes through in the aftertaste providing some tannins and herbal bite. I need to try this beer fresh, to better sample the hop quality.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Pretty light bodied, bitter with sweet nut and citruis. Clean finish with only a light bitterness.

Tastes potently hoppy, so much so that everything else is at first masked. What comes through later is a little bit of smokey oak and maple syrup sweetness.  Feels moderate with mild coarse carbonation throughout, good tingle on the tongue.  Incredibly hoppy but if you're into that, you'd be able to do a couple of these. A bit on the strong side, but not too strong. A must-try for hopheads, and probably worth a try for others too.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

T- Wow again almost the same as the regular Arrogant Bastard but nice dry oaky finish makes this much nicer.  M- Medium body however the oak makes this a much drier finish.

Aroma-Sweet oak and caramel malts. Some hops on the nose but they're on the back end as far as I can tell, this one is all about that oak character.  Taste-Practically identical to the nose with the malt-soaked oak coming first and foremost in the taste department followed by a slight bittering hop profile rounding things out in the middle and ending with that same oaken flavor on the aftertaste. Nicely layered.  Mouthfeel-Big, thick and rich without being syrupy like an RIS and with just enough carbonation to give it a crisp sting.

147,8951,Baraka,4.95,"Pours a deep dark brown with a solid head. Solid lacing. Smell consists of both citrus hops and sweet caramel malts, suggesting a complex balance of flavors. The taste does not disappoint: we have a very complex melding of hop bitterness, pine and citrus flavors, and a transcendent malt sweetness backed by a smokey and woody flavor. The amazing thing about this beer is that instead of all the disparate flavors fighting for dominance and overwhelming each other, they allow each other to shine brighter, bringing all the complexity together in a deliciously awesome, powerful beer.  As a big fan of regular Arrogant Bastard, I looked forward to trying this iteration and it did not disappoint. It has all the elements that i loved in AB but manages to add additional complexity. I could drink this stuff all night without getting sick of it; the flavors are that good (plus it hides its alcohol really well under all of the complexities).",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,clarkm04,4.42,"Appearance- A real deep reddish/copper color. A slight head retention.  Smell- Aggressive. What would you expect? You can smell the malts and hops coming through in the smell.  Taste- You are immediately hit with the hops. Very upfront and bitter. Next the beer turns malty with an added oak note from the oaked process. Finishes a little dry with some leftover hop/malt residue in your mouth.  Mouthfeel- Definitely a unique mouthfeel. At times it feels lighter than the smell or taste while other times it feels heavier and more chewy. The only consistent item for me is the hops that hits me in the back of my mouth.  Drinkability- For a beer with this much hops, malts and relative ABV it's highly drinkable.  Overall- This is a unique beer and I always enjoy drinking it despite not being worthy. I love how aggressive yet drinkable it is. It's such a great beer and deserves to be Stone's flagship beer. I know they are different beers but I have the same feelings about this beer as I do about DFH 60 Minute. 60 minute is more malty and roasty while AB has a hoppier taste they both are unique beers loaded with malts and hops and highly drinkable.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

The oak starts to really come out as it warms up but it's usually not overwhelming. A very good combination mouthfeel of a little fuzzy mouthcoating and slightly sticky with a moderate high carbonation.  Hmmm, I really can't decide if I like this better than a regular AB. The oak certainly adds a new dimension to the taste but at times comes up a little too much. It definitely dries out the finish a bit more and it's nice to get the wood flavor subtly throughout rather than just in the aftertaste.

T: Rich coffee malt flavor turns to a bitterness (the grapefruit comment is pretty spot-on). Finish is long and toasted malt, but also tastes like a bourbon finish (would assume this is the oak and grains reacting with each other). As I keep drinking this I find it's been WAAY too heavily hopped. After every sip, that lingering bitterness just stays. It's becoming a cumulative bittering. Which is turning unpleasant.  MF: Surprisingly liquidy, was expecting a thicker, more viscous beverage.  D: It's becoming a labor to finish this; every sip ensures more of this unpleasant bitterness that isn't going away. Too much roasted malt, too much hopping. I would like to try this again if they oaked it for several months or years longer. Needs to really mellow out for such treatment; with more aging the hop bitterness would subside. Then I'd have a beverage I would be in love with.  I decided to post up a review of this because I'm getting a bit tired of seeing the only bier getting play on Beer Advocate being ones that are over the top. While I'm sure many appreciate taking roasted malt, hop bitterness, and oak all to the Nth degree in the same bier, I do not.  I am most saddened by this because it started off so well. But, 15 minutes later, I am struggling to finish this. Balance, balance, balance. Too much going on at once. I'm sure the back of the bottle will insist I don't have a ""good enough"" palate for this or some silliness, but maybe 1/2 the folks on Beer Advocate are smokers and have a numbed palate that NEEDS a blitzkrieg of flavor to get through.

147,8951,dogfishandi,4.52,"reviewed on 2-19-2009(fresh bottle)  i bought this for $19.00 a six pack. extremely expensive, but now that i tasted it, im begining to think it was worth it. poured from a 12 oz. bottle at about cellar temperature into a pint glass. it pours a dark orangeish amber color, almost brown with a nice off white to tan head. when held up to the light there was lots of floaters and such, im assuming it was bottle conditioned. very good head retention and some pretty decent lacing as well. the aroma is very strong and fragrant. there is some flowers, a lot of wood, almost like a whiskey wood flavor, some vanilla notes, oak notes, with some citrus hops as well. this is a hugely complex beer both in the aroma and taste. the taste is very woody with a nice hoppy bite in the finish. a little vanilla, some oak flavors, some nice malts, very smooth. minimal carbonation. this has a great half life that lingers on and on, gives you some nice warm woody flavors. ive heard that this is not really aged in oak barrels or even aged on wood chips. they make like a wood chip tea with water, then strain out the wood chips and infuse only the water into the fermentation. i would definately suggest drinking this at about room temperature so you can taste all the complex unique flavors it has to offer. this one is very drinkable as it masks the alcohol pretty well. however, it creeps up on you and can get you in trouble after too many. i definately reccomend this beer, stone has a lot to offer, and this is one of the best. also i think this is just a little better than the regular bastard as well as the double bastard. get it, no matter what you have to pay even though its way overpriced. the most ive ever payed for a six pack.  reviewed on 7-9-2010(bottle aged 1 year 5 months)  i can barely make out the enjoy by date to be 11-24-08(could be 09), but this is from the same 6 pack as the above review. pours much darker than i remember, a really dark red brown in the middle. a nice 2 finger slightly tan colored head, good retention, good lacing.  in the aroma, sweet, woody like malts, piney citrus hops. not a whole lot of change, maybe seems more malty than hoppy with the age.  yes yes...the malts have definatly come out a lot more with age, its very nice. woody, sweet malts, hard to describe, but a very good malt profile. blanaced very nicely by piney citrus, almost floral hops. quite a perfumey fragrant tasting beer, perhaps a hint of smoke. complex.  such a smooth mouthfeel, just perfect feeling carbonation.  great drinkability, but i only got this one bottle.  great beer fresh, even better with age.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,squaremile,4.02,"Year old 12oz bottle. Pours an amber/brown with a small head. I don't care much for the look. Nose is fresh flowers, oak, brown sugar, and alcohol.

147,8951,BlackHaddock,3.9,"Brown 12 Oz bottle, poured into a Westmalle chalice. Reviewed on 4th July!  Looked good, a rich creamy tanned head sat on top of a clear body, the body being a redwood browny red colour.  I liked this a lot more than the normal Arrogant Bastard, seemed have more of everything.  The aroma reminded me of Belgian beers, maybe the yeast esters, or the heady mix of hop and malts that produced the smells that excite me.  The taste was heavy and rich, no hints of the oak wood chips though in the flavour or smell.  The hops gave a true bitterness, while the malt content tried to balance the brew somewhat.  Enjoyable, but not a beer I could drink all night, or on a regular basis, just a little to 'in your face' for me.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,cosmicevan,3.8,"Poured from a 12oz bottle.  A - Pours a ruby brown with frothy off-white head and nice sticky lacing.  S - Hops dominate the smell. Touch of sweetness and a touch of a wood like smell...perhaps that's the sweetness? As it warmed, the wood chip smell became much more distinct and upfront. Kind of like a burnt wood smell.  T - Still pretty hoppy in flavor, but a bit tamed down from non oaked arrogant bastard. The wood came out as it warmed.  M - Pretty bitter and dry. I'm not a huge fan of these hop head beers. When I have a hoppy beer, I'm not too into the over the top hops. I find them too bitter and dry and this beer certainly fits that bill.  D - Very drinkable for a hoppy beer.

Toasted malt, some vanilla and caramel, some piney scents and some herbal notes.  Big sweet and toasted malt, followed by big bitter hops, some vanilla, woody elements and a nice slow long burnt sugar bitter finish. Complex and robust, with plenty of alcohol, but not a punch in the face either. Very balanced.  Medium-full body -- just right.  A pretty easy drinking beer for something of this style.

147,8951,MbpBugeye,3.88,"Ive had this a few times before. Arrogant Bastard is never hard to find. The oaked version is slightly more scarce but not by much. I remember preferring this over the regular one. Im pretty sure I still do. After I got it home I noticed that its a couple months past its enjoy by date. Im hoping thats not too much of an issue.  A- Crazy toasted marshmallow colored head. It sticks around for a good long time and leaves insane lacing. The beer is a rich rusty brown with bright burnt orange highlights. Its pretty clear with minimal haze.  S- Sweet, candy like malts with subtle oak. Notes of caramel, toffee, vanilla, cashews and saltwater taffy. The hops are bright and grapefruity. They might have been weakened in the nose by the little bit of excessive age this bottle has.  T- Lots of oak right up front. Its got lots more toffee, caramel, some vanilla and a little bit of cocoa powder. Very bittering hops. This one is meant to kick you in the teeth. Arrogant Bastard is a fitting name. Lots and lots of pine over top light grapefruit. The finish is bitter and has a medicinal, resinous stickiness that lingers.  M- Semi dry feeling then it gets much more dry on the finish. Slightly powdery and woody.  D- A strong ale with an intense bitterness. One and done for me but I like it very much.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,JMad,4.35,"This is an awesome brew.  I poured a 12oz bottle into a chilled pint glass. It was murky reddish-brown with an off white head that was pretty thin. It smells of bourbon, caramel, and floral hops. The first thing you taste is piney bitterness then sweet malt, a hint of wood, and more bitterness hits the back of the tongue.

147,8951,mulder1010,3.96,"12 oz bottle poured into a Great Divide Globe Glass Best Before 6/17/10  A-- Poured an opaque reddish brown. No carbonation on the sides of the glass. Light brown head that started at 2 fingers and quickly settled down to under a finger. Lots of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. Good head retention.  S-- Soft floral and citrus notes with touches of carmel. With the age the hops have dropped some and get a little bit of biscuit smell to this.  T-- Oak has a big effect on this as it is quite peaty. Hops are there but not as powerful as regular bastard is usually. A little bit of warmth from the oaking as well.  M-- As said the hops have softened a lot but the flavor is still there. Still get some grapefruit, lemon and some pine but what is more obvious is the wood. Very chewy and peaty. Lots of Oak tannins in this and a warming sensation more like scotch. Much more hearty a beer now. A good sized oak burn in the finish along with the ABV%. Medium to lower end of the carbonation side.  D-- Excellent beer for colder nights. Have had fresh Arrogant Bastard before and it is exceptional. Oak Aged is excellent. Fresher would only enhance the other flavors and possibly bring out more but this at a year old is very good. The Oak taste and feel makes this exceptional. The ABV is a bit more obvious in this but that might be more the age and Oak. Still could drink 2 before feeling the bite of this.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Tan, creamy head that leaves nice lacing on the chalice. Higher alcohol content is evident as I swirl the glass and the ale clings to the glass.  S: Complex aroma of ripe bananas and floral notes as well.  T: Hop bitterness tempered somewhat by the oak aging.  M: Medium bodied with little carbonation.  D: Easy to drink, smooth ale. The 7% ABV would not deter me from drinking a couple more.  Summary: Really excellent ale from Stone.

147,8951,HeckYeah,4.35,"A: Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The head was minimal and quickly disappeared into nothing but a thin foam ring with some bubbly continents in the middle. A murky red-copper color, kind of like Dr. Pepper, but with lots of fine sediment flecks throughout. at the end there was a small pile of dark brown sediment on the bottom of my glass.  S: A spicy hoppy smell up front with a hint of coriander and it leaves a slight tingle in the nostrils. The smell is great and strong, but lacks endurance.  T: There is a lot going on here. Starts out with a subtle, slightly sweet orange zest flavor that transitions into a spicy, tongue tingling, cock-punching, hoppyness. After the swallow you get a lingering bitterness.  M: smooth at first, then it seams to foam up your mouth even though the carbonation is mild. It gives your tongue a good tingle, then leaves you with dry bitterness like an ex girlfriend.  D: I could easily drink a bomber of this, but after that i would probably prefer to mix it up with something else. The hops are intense and delicious, but the bitterness yearns for something more soothing afterward. like a cuddle.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

I could smell them as soon as I cracked this one open. The wood is subdued but is definitely present.  T- Well like I was guessing from the aroma, the hops pack a punch. They lead the way here. They are followed by a spice that I can't quite finger. There is a caramel malt profile lingering in the back row. The wood comes out as the beer warms.  M- Medium in body with a nice crisp finish.

Smell is hoppy, floral and spicy. A second smell reveals a malt sweetness.  Taste is on the bitter side, but with a nice malt backbone to hold it up. Has a slight oak flavor that plays well into the taste. Its not an IPA, but is more bitter than some I've had.  Mouthfeel is remarkable. Very full bodied, just the right amount of carbonation.

S - The hops are there to shake your hand along with plenty of citrus notes.  T - Well-balanced really is not the right word here, but there is plenty of malt for sweetness and plenty of hops for bitterness. The oak really brings out the sweetness of the malt that brings a great contrast. I know sounds odd but the hops win out in this brew which is a fantastic mouthful.

Smell was good, but I was expecting a bit more of a wood-aged note. Not quite as pronounced as I was hoping for. Taste was pretty stellar though. A nice hit of malt up front, then you can taste some of that oak on your palate, and it leaves you with a bite of hops at the end. I tasted just a bit of cinnamon with this beer, and also some peat smoke. Very flavorful. Mouthfeel was on the dry side, but smooth. Would have guessed the abv to be somewhat higher. This is a unique beer with just as a unique flavor, so a single bottle was a nice introduction.

147,8951,OttoBomb,4.18,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass (June 2, 2010). ""Enjoy by 06/02/2010"" is printed on the front of the very cool looking bottle.  Stone Brerewey is new to the Chicago market, and I'm happy to partake in another offering from them. I'm drinking this on the last day as indicated by the bottle, so that might not be optimal, but I'm reviewing anyways. In time I'll try a fresher one when I can and I'll re-review if my impressions of the fresher version vary drastically from this tasting.  Eyes: Pours a darkish red syrupy color. A full one finger head rises with a slightly off-white cream color.  Nose: I'm glad to say it's very hoppy. Some good pine hop aroma and even some dry fruit which is surprisingly well balanced. I can barely identify the oak, if at all.  Tongue: Caramel, dry fruit, pine hops, and oak takes it's place on the tail. Very potent flavors each, but each one is extremely well and skillfully balanced.  Mouth: Rich and thick without coating the palate too much.  Libation: For such a hop/flavor forward beer, this is very well balanced and goes down extremely easy. Given the ease of drinkability and the undetectable 7.2% ABV Oaked AB can be dangerous if you've picked up a sixer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,GeezLynn,4.08,"A: Deep shade of red/amber with a thin white head  S: Caramel malt, butter, burnt brown sugar, and a little oak. While not a primary feature, the hops are also easily discerned.  T: Initial flavor is sweet caramel and vanilla, followed by a very herbal hop flavor. Finish is long with a healthy amount of hop bitterness and burnt toffee.  M: Medium-bodied, slightly syrupy with medium carbonation that is well-contained. Pretty close to how I would draw it up.  Oaked Bastard is my favorite of the three. It has a little more complexity than the regular AB, but is not quite as rough around the edges as the Double Bastard.

147,8951,jmerloni,4.03,"A - Pours a tawny copper brown color with flashes of bright amber in the middle. Pretty interesting. Head is gigantic and laces fairly absurdly. One of the most formidable heads I've seen.  S - The oakiness is definitely there! I love it. Besides that, some citrusy hops. Maltiness is there too.  T - The flavor is more piney than I expected given the nose. A little mellowed and not as bold as expected. Hop and malt in a respectably well-crafted balance. Tastes very fresh.  M - On the lighter side of medium-bodied. A bit too much carbonation perhaps. It leaves a nice dry finish.  D - Fairly drinkable.

Grapefruit and floral hops are present in the aroma, but the initial taste is dominated by a woody smokiness and hints of creamy malt and sweet vanilla. Citrusy hops then burst down the door and lead to a lingering finish.  Slightly dry mouthfeel with ample carbonation. Easy to sip, but the tartness of the finish helps to slow you down.

147,8951,Pittsburgh,3.9,"I was really anticipating trying this beer, I am a big AB fan. I must say, I think the twist on it didn't really improve it. Not that it necessarily needs to be better, just different, but I think they should have left AB as it was. I am not feeling the oak flavor, it gives it a flavor of more of a red ale....but I don't like the way it finishes. Obviously I am comparing this to the original, so next to a normal beer it still stands tall. This comes off a little more sharp and bitter than regular AB to me, and you catch the smokey oak flavor in it as well, especially on the finish. Still has a good malt presence and a nice balance of flavors in the beer.  All in all still solid, I just prefer the regular AB or double Bastard to this, but an interesting twist none the less. I think adding the oak compromises too much of the other taste.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,Pahn,4.26,"12oz bottle into Duvel tulip. Best by 7/7/10 printed on the bottle.  Appearance: Slow pour down the side and middle of the glass yields a two inch, silky offwhite head that dissipates slowly, leaving walls of lacing. Pours a deep, semi-opaque reddish amber. Leaves a solid wall of lacing on one side of the glass, and huge streaks and latticework elsewhere. Lacing sticks around indefinitely. Great.  Smell: From the bottle: hops and caramel. In the glass: the first thing that jumps out at me is a distinct but not overpowering note of black licorice. Along with that, there's some piny and tropical fruit hops, and a faint malt aroma. The smell gets a little spicier as the beer warms.  Taste: First sip: more mild black licorice, a prickly, lasting hop bite, transitioning to a smoothed out version of Arrogant Bastard's distinctive and complex malt profile. Finishes clean with a bit of alcohol warmth.  At first, it seems like the oak aging contributes little overt flavor, but rather smooths out the brash (but good) Arrogant Bastard flavors. As the beer warms and I get deeper into the bottle, a vanilla note does emerge from the oak, and I'm guessing that black licorice taste must have something to do with the oak aging because I never get it from the normal AB. There's a consistent spiciness and tropical fruit hops flavor present in the background, with a decent amount of hop bitterness. At the forefront of the taste are the different malt flavors; toffee, gingerbread, sugar cookie, caramel, but none of it particularly sweet. Superbly balanced flavor.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, alternately creamy and sticky. Usually creamy, hence the 4.0.  Drinkability: Good. Very high quality beer, though the alcohol can creep up on you. The spicy, licorice notes are a bit of a turn off for me, so I don't find myself craving Oaked AB very often, but I would never turn one down when offered.  Oaked Arrogant Bastard actually used to be my favorite beer. I still love it, but various things about the flavor don't always mesh with me. That said, I love the balance of flavors, and there's an amazing amount going on. Also, like its non-oak-aged older brother, it's one of those few beers that I've literally never tasted anything like.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

A: Pours a dirty woody brownish-ruby with a very thin fizzy dark brown head that quickly reduced down into an oily film that left sheets of sticky lacing. S: Sweet caramel malt, light grassy hops, and an overall smokey bbq scent similar to woodchips. T: Very rich and bold flavors assault the palate. Starts off with a bitter grapefruit hop punch that is quickly overpowered by caramely sweet malt. Then the hops comeback in the finish with bitter grassy notes. There is a touch of smokey woody flavor left in the aftertaste, and an overall ambiguous fruit flavor (pineapple?) to the beer. Aftertaste has notes of cumin seed as well. M: Medium-heavy oily body with an oily slick mouthfeel and medium smooth carbonation. Aftertaste is dry, bitter, and smokey. D: Stronger than AB with a heavier body. The oaked flavors add a nice touch to the flavor but I could take it or leave it. I wouldn't say better than AB, just a bit different.

A: Pours an almost opaque bronze; hazy brown at the core with nice bright reds hinting at the sides of the glass. A nice cream-colored head sticks around for a few minutes.  S: What a smell. You definitely get that woody, almost smokey smell from the wood chips (it's actually much more prevalent in the smell than the taste), along with this sour hoppy kick.  T: This beer is all over the palate. I immediately taste bitter fruit, like maybe grapefruit, with a minimal sweetness. This gives way to the smokey, barbeque-charred taste that I assume come from these oak chips. I think this is a really nice addition that helps to balance out what comes next- the hops. I get this bittersweet kick at the end that sticks around for a while, but not in a bad way. This is an intense flavor.  M: Even at 7.2% ABV, this beer is incredibly smooth. It has a light to medium body that flows easily over the tongue, with enjoyable prickles from the carbonation.  D: I've never had a normal Arrogant Bastard Ale, although after this I definitely need to try the two side by side. The smokey flavor from the oak chips really helps to segue between the mild fruitiness at the front and the intense hop bitterness at the end.

147,8951,lacqueredmouse,4.3,"Pours a deep and delicious red-brown colour, with a massive head of yellow-beige foaming bubbles that leave extraordinary lacing. Extremely thick and viscous coming out of the bottle, and it even looks heavy and languid sitting in the glass. A really, really good looking beer.  Big hop fragrance on the nose, which mingles charismatically with the even bigger oak character to give a freshly pungent melange which is not unlike woodsmoke and gunpowder. Oak is huge on this thing, giving wood and resin characters, and depth like crazy. Yeah, when Stone do something, they do it to the logical extreme.  Taste has robust depth - lots of hop bitterness and a dark, almost roasty character come through, with a woody oak hint floating around the corners. The oak is certainly more prominent on the nose, but it's here as well, just mingled with, and subdued by, the other, stronger and more dominant characteristics, leaving a slight woody sweetness that reminds me of pecan pie. Mouthfeel is initially smooth, but tingled with carbonation through the back.  An excellent beer, and one which is surprisingly drinkable for its strength, depth and aggression. It has actually been some time since I sampled the plain Arrogant Bastard (if you can ever really use that description of it), so it's hard to compare it to the original, but this has such depth, such fullness of character, and such robust arrogance, that it stands by itself as a stellar and wonderful example of the American brewer's craft.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

T - Way too woody in the taste, making this overly bitter and astringent, way off from the normal AB. Pineapple and pine hops are there, as is a surprising fusel alcohol presence. There is nice caramel malt presence that saves the whole thing from being turpentine.  M - Astringent and very dry, with plenty of alcohol burn.  D - I'll get through this one 12, but only because it ain't cheap.  Man, what a letdown. I am a big fan of Arrogant Bastard, but this doesn't do it justice. It tastes over-oaked, almost fake.

A good dose of pine resin hops in the finish, then the residual wood flavoring dominates the lingering aftertaste.  M - Medium to full body, perfect carbonation, clean finish.  D - The big malts, pine hops and oak aging make this one robust, earthy brew.

147,8951,stakem,4.2,"Review from notes taken on 4/9/10 during the Stone takes over the Warwick event.  Served in a Stone pint glass, it appears a ruby red amber color, very clear with a finger of yellowish foam for a head. Very good retension and a solid amount of lace all around the glassware. Aroma is bright citrus hops with a backing of wood/oak earthiness. Taste is inline with what the aroma led on. When compared to the bottled version this on tap almost seemingly is an exaggerated oak flavor that boarders being unnatural. Bitter oily hops upfront with alcohol warmth gives way to malt and oakiness flavors through the medium body to again oily bitter hop finish. Moderately carbonated with hops and oak left lingering in the mouth.

Smell: grapefruity hops and wood. Taste: hops is the most prominent taste but as it goes down, there's some dark fruit maybe and yes, a hint of mint. I let this one warm up a little. So glad I did; it grows with complexity as you continue to sample it and drink it at room temperature.

Pours syruply into a 16 oz pint glass and is an opaque amber-brown w/ chill and barely transparent when warmer. The head is tan with dense, tightly-packed bubbles.  Tart earthy smell of with some vanilla and some raisin. Also a barleywine malt aroma smell like a high-alcohol beer, though is neither fusel nor astringent. Dark berries or prune and some oakiness is evident and subtle.  Not as thick as I would have thought, but fills the mouth fully.  Oak is mostly in the nose though some vanillin is preent in the flavor.

Lovely smell, won't bore you with what I think I smell. I don't think that ""smell"" should even be a category, [typical example of over analyizing]. ""smell"" is a sub category of ""taste"" and it is ultimately the taste that counts.  OK, here we are at the only category that matters to me. I love it. There is a sweetness that rescues my tongue from the hoppy assault. The rich maltyness is what I love about it though. I'm not aware of any ""oaky stuff"" going on, if it had not have been mentioned on the label I would not have been ""looking"" for it. Overall, this is very good...but not enough to make me want to throw down a prayer rug in the direction of San Diego County.

147,8951,kmdawber,4.23,"Was super excited to try this beer after what I'd heard about it. Poured a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Beer pours a smooth brown/copper, almost deep red hue. Creamy head with not a ton of retention. Lacing was pretty sticky but not overwhelmingly so.  Smell is awesome. Floral is definitely present, as is the ""oaked"" smell, as marked on the bottle. Smells a little woody. Also has some fruity undertones, maybe a little citrus. The easiest to notice is the floral vs malt battle. Both smells are in your face and balance well together.  The taste surprisingly different than the smell. You can taste the oak much more than you can smell it. Not a bad thing, but its much more there in the taste. The same is true of the citrus smell. Not as present in the taste. Overall the taste is a little dry, more hoppy than malty, though a balance is there. And you can tell they fight in the taste as much as they do in the smell. I agree with another review that said this left him wanting a little more of the fruit taste that was in the smell. At the same time, it's still an enjoyable flavor for sure.  The mouthfeel is a little dry like I said before. Good carbonation though and it's not too heavy at all.  Last but not least, the drinkability is quite good. The abv is up over 7% but you wouldn't know. The other flavors eat up the alcohol. I probably couldn't drink more than 3 in a session without getting sick of it, but I'd enjoy the hell out of those three.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Great lacing, leaves evidence of every sip.  S - Strong malt smell. Slight roast character. Overall, not a very distinguishable smell. Would have liked more hops or specialty grains in this smell.  T - Spicy taste to this. Doesn't have a huge bite, but has a lingering hop taste. No alcohol taste. Slight malt sweetness near the end; good backbone. Almost a coffee taste upon retro olfaction. I think I'm tasting something hickory or smokey, but that might just be my imagination. There's definitely something complex behind the initial flavor that makes you want more.  MF - Smooth body. Very comforting to drink. Large beer, but won't fill you up.  D - Good drinkability, but I can't see myself having more than 2 or 3 in a night. Too strong to enjoy past one or two. Complex enough to get time after time though.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,BuckyFresh,4,"Appearance: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a large wine glass. Nice golden/ruby color on this one, with a large, tan two-finger head. Little to no haze present, decent retention, and some pretty sticky lacing.  Smell: Pretty intriguing aroma here, with floral, wood, and citrus notes vying for their share of my attention. I'm also picking up some yeasty influence and a touch of dark fruits reminiscent of a Trappist ale. Good malt presence also, with hardly any alcohol discernible in the nose.  Taste: Surprisingly dry given the smell of this beer. I can taste the oak influence, and the hops definitely have their place as well. It seems to me that there could be a little more malt punch though; I found myself wanting more of the dark fruit flavor that the smell suggested. I only bought one of these, but I would be interested to try an aged bottle. Perhaps a little time would smooth things out a bit.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with adequate carbonation. Again, a little dryness and astringency prevented all the flavors from coming to the party.  Drinkability: I liked the beer, but I don't think I could have too many of these.

I can smell the ""oak"" effect, but the Arrogant Bastard is still here with a malty, hoppy nose. Quantity is a bit lacking but this isn't an especially strong brew so I'll give it a pass.  T: The taste is great. You have to try the Arrogant Bastard first, but the low-down is in-your-face medium to dark malts with pungent hops and a woody aftertaste from the oaking. The oaking has the effect of smoothing things out significantly (the Arrogant Bastard is really in-your-face) but at the same time, in my opinion, subdues some of the ""arrogance"" of the brew and detracts from what the beer originally was. I would say most normal people would prefer this over the regular Arrogant Bastard because it's clearly more refined and homogeneous...in fact, in most ways, this is a ""better"" beer, however, it's my review, and I'm saying I like the regular better.  M: Perfect carbonation but the oaking makes the mouthfeel a little awkward.  D: This stuff is extremely strong.

I don't get a lot of the oak/vanilla that I expected, but there is a subtle oak taste in the background. Definitely some alcohol present in this one as well. The hops are very predominant as I continue to drink this and they dominate the oak palate that I was looking forward to tasting.  M - Medium body, light carbonation.

There is a slightly sweet background.  The taste is very nice: The hop bitterness beautifully complements a spicy and slightly peppery old oak taste.

Smells of a bit of vanilla up front, followed by a nice hit of grapefruit and pine, with a touch of citrus. Little bit of a floral aroma.  Taste is very very good. Grapefruit, pine, and citrus hop flavors are balanced by some vanilla and caramel. Just a great flavor for a strong ale. Not too overpowering, so it's also very drinkable.

T- Really smooth, even more than a Stroh's Light, if you can believe that. Very dry from the oak aging, but what it loses in malt sweetness, it gains in oaky vanilla and smoke. After taste is a little pilsy. Nice, but doesn't punch you right in the tongue the way I expected.  M- Thick as they come, coats like crazy, this is serious stuff.

I would kill to get this color with my homebrew. Crystal clear too.  Beautiful light colored head.  The nose is nice floral hops and a great malt edge. The taste is much more mellow and not even close to the intense hop left hook of the standard AB. Its oak character has mellowed this quite nicely. I get grapefruit and malt up front. Nice clean finish. There is a great citrus tart flavor to this beer. I personally feel it blows the regular version of Arrogant Bastard out of the water.  I would happily drink this all the time. I guess my only criticism is that this thing is $3.75 for a 12oz.

The smell is surprisingly mellow for a stone offering but it's not lacking in goodness, a bit of wood and alcohol esters are there but they definitely threw some extra finishing aromatic hops in there too because I get a little floral balance to the woody alcohol.  The taste is great, definitely more flavor here than the regular arrogant bastard. There is a prominent citrus flavor that is quite spiced up, followed by the bitter hopping coupled with the wood from the oak chips which give it an almost sour bite. Finishes pretty smooth, spicey and herbal in the end which is a great ending to an awesome beer, it seriously leaves my mouth with the feeling I get after having a mint!  Mouthfeel is great, not amazingly exceptional or anything but it makes its presence known. The spiciness and citrus with that minty finish make the feel for sure.  Very drinkable, it's a sipper for sure and puts a smile on my face ever time I take a drink.

Light cloud to the redwood colored liquid, near to opaque, more of a zinc orange further out. There's a flatness to the nose, not necessarily a lack of scents per se, just a certain lack of vigor in the vanilla, chocolate base as well as the creamy whiskey notes and golden raisin, red cherry, apricot scents, this leaves extra room for the hops, grains and grasses to assert themselves whereas otherwise they would come off as more contained. Medium-bodied, whipped up and foamy in the mouth to no obvious specific end, More oomph in the caramel, vanilla fudge, mocha flavors, some sweet cedar as well. Same goes for a mild elevation in the nectarine, apricot, pineapple, peach fruit but, truly, not much. Some orange to lemon citrus yet surprisingly light.

Fruit aromas that I can single out include black cherry and raspberry.  T: The oak certainly plays a leading role, jumping on my side taste buds and remaining present throughout the duration of the sip. Cherry, plum, and a little bit of dry grapefruit also show themselves to my mouth. As the beer warms, the aforementioned fruitiness overcomes the oaky flavor as the dominant taste.  M: Pretty dry and tannin-y from the oak chipping process. Medium-bodied, but that dryness prevents a truly full feel from cascading over my palate.  D: I'm not sure that I would want to have more than one of these in a single sitting because the oak tannins really hit my palate hard.

The feel in the mouth is silky and smooth which leaves it very drinkable - not too thin, but not too full.  I found this beer tastes the best after it's had a few minutes to sit and warm up.

Great retention and visually appealing.  Definite oak in the nose, fruity and woody a trace of brown sugar. Flavor is also oak-forward with moderate hop presence, not as bitter as Arrogant Bastard, toned down from the oak aging. Resiny pine hop bitterness resonates in the aftertaste, with drying oak notes. The wood has a fruity note too, hard to describe, but it reminds me of cantaloupe. A trace touch of the abv, but not distracting. Easy enough to have one or two, but not one to have more of.

Pours a nice reddish brown with good clarity. Sheets of lace coat the sides of the goblet. Skim of foam remains for the duration, and foam has a rich, dense quality.  Smells lightly of grassy hops, slight bubblegum.  Taste leads off with a strange artificial rubber/plastic taste, before moving into hoppy territory. Doesn't have a signature oak-aged character, just seems a bit off. Mouthfeel is big like an IIPA, rich and full.

The smell is sweet and spicy malts with a hop palate that's modest but confident and a much lighter sweeter smell which may come from the oaking.  Glug glug glug  This is tasty...big caramel and molasses flavors in the malt with the oaky wood flavor and the mellow sweetness coming at the end. The last part of the aftertaste to me is really like the smell of fresh lumber in a way. Perhaps a bit of orange and herbal hop flavor too. The mouth feel is thick and creamy.

Aroma is pineapple chunks, grapefruit, sherry, a loft caramel malt sweetness. a soft vanilla touch.  The taste is much more gentle than I anticipated, given that the regular Bastard is quite the beast. This sample is actually aged a bit, and the bottle I got is just over the expiration, so it's intense hop character is subdued a bit. A salty and grapefruit hop bitterness, pineapple chunks, soft malty sweetness holding it all together without throwing off the balance. A touch of dry oak on the finish.  The mouthfeel starts moderate and gets a bit watery toward the center. The carbonation is quite low, made up of a few tiny bubbles. There is a lingering hop oily feeling which creates a long finish.  Drinkability is good, but I was expecting more from this Bastard.

The head is a very light tan, rising about four fingers and has great retention and lacing.  The aroma is medium in strength with lots of oak to start and a strong alcohol finish, not very appealing or balanced.  The taste sadly loses all the oak that was in the nose. It is replaced by the harsh bitter alcohol that is straight from the regular arrogant bastard. Its just boring here.  The feel is heavy, but a lasting alcohol bitter finish.

The aroma was obviously oaky. Strong hop bill of pine, grass, and some soapiness was ever changing. Mint, ripe cherries, brown sugar, and even some banana in there, the nose was very complex. The alcohol was hidden very well.  The flavor was an excellent balance of two hardy profiles. The hops were evident at first and picked up steam towards the end, especially in the resiny and grapefruit finish. The malt shared spotlight with sweeter caramel tones and a toasty finish.  The feel was smooth and coating, the carbonation had a fair bit of spike. The finish was dryish and had a nice pinching feeling that lingered.

The head is really nice and thick with great retention and lacing.  S= Pungent for sure. As the cap hissed when I cracked the beer I could almost immediatly smell the hoppy deliciousness. Nice piney hops to it like the regular AB bu this one is just a little different. A nice malty character to it just like the AB as well. Great caramel malts and sweetness to it. The oak is more subdued and you have to search for it but it is there. What is more noticable is a certain cinnimon smell that I would suspect is just a combination of sweet malts and oaky vanilla.  T= The hops hit you up front on the tip of your tongue. They flow over your tongue and give way to a nice sweet malty mid section. The great caramel and toffee flavors come through as well as some oakiness but again the oak has to be searched for a little more. The cinnimon that I smelled isn't around instead the finish leads to a slight vanilla from the oak and some woodyness. Just when you think the finish was the smoothest thing ever the hops come and bite the back of your tongue leaving a lasting finish.  M= Smooth and coating. Not too light or to heavy.

Deep mahogany body, not clear, one finger light tan body, medium dissipation with a thin layer of head covering the top of the brew. The nose is malt dominated, caramel, with vanilla notes present, little hop odor. Taste is pretty sweet up front, with some fruity esters (cherries, raisins), not very bitter, this beer really mellowed out from barrel aging. The hops start to shine in the finish, but do not overwhelm the complex malt bill. The mouthfeel is fairly effervescent and not too sticky for the sweetness. A bit boozy tasting to be real drinkable, not sure I'd try to do multiple bottles in one sitting, and the taste re hops certainly benefit from warming up a bit. I certainly prefer this to regular Bastard, very smooth and quite tasty.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Similar to the smell, this hits heavy on the malt. A bit of vanilla seeps through with some piney hops rounding out the taste. There is a bit of oak substance throughout the hit.  Very creamy upfront, my mouth is liking the pull. It finishes with some carbonation bite which is very clean.  Easy to drink I think. But I've had a 10%, 11%, and then this drink.

A good amount of thickness, and little carbonation, which I like in a thick beer. for 7.2% ABV, not too strong on the alcohol taste which makes it very drinkable.

A full maltiness bring carmelized flavors to the fore which are met by a leafy, herbal bitterness and nicely subdued by a dark vanilla. Dry and almost whisky like, with a nice warming burnt wood in the finish. The hops and malt intermingle wonderfully with the oak.

Leaves substantial lacing.  Big combination of woody resin & citric hops (orange & grapefruit). Slightly musty or sweaty. Some pepper & mineral notes hanging around.  Whoa! Does that taste hit a lot of points! Starts off with a combination of roasty caramel & a bitterness like orange zest. Aggressive without being sharp or off-putting, not just a bitter-bomb. Moves into some ""dark candy"" territory, like black licorice & root beer barrels. Turns bitter in the finish but with a clinging sugary sweetness around the ring of the mouth (just not the tongue). Aftertaste gets real oaky & imparts vanilla, then ends pretty dry. Complex, has a lot of movements.  Full, creamy mouthfeel that's also sharp without being too prickly. Maybe slightly tannic even (?).  Not what I was expecting: not usually a fan of Stone's big-malt-bigger-hop beers, but this one was balanced, yet complicated enough to string me along, & the oak was an awesome binder. Good combination of challenge & reward, & nothing if not interesting. Great beer, but one is satisfying, thank you.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

S - I smell wood. This definitely delivers on the oak name. It has that classic ale smell with a bit of a hop bite to it.  T - This has a pretty good flavor. You can really taste the wood aged flavors, as well as some nuttiness. There is some bitter hops, as well as some spices and malt.  M/D - The carbonation is just right on this one. The strong wood flavor and hops makes this slightly harder to drink, but it is good. It has a heavy viscous feel to it.  Bottom Line: This is a high quality ale, you can tell it has been well crafted. The appearance and smell make it pretty top notch, and it delivers on the oak.

The flavor is good, has quite a sweet flavor that comes across quickly, seems like brown sugar and caramel. Also there seems to be a nice amount of wood aged flavor, which adds to the complexity as a nutty and fruit flavor profile come through. There is a hop presence there as well but again it was not overpowering so I do wonder if I got a aged bottle of this one, regardless the flavors where nice.

I picked up a single 12oz bottle for a tasting, expecting the same expierence as before... I was wrong. This awesome new opinion and perception of barrel aging is why I drink craft beer.Nothing beats such a unexpected and pleasent surprise.  A- similar to its woodles brother. Deep red brown color, with a one finger light reddish white head (a bit less agressive pour than usual).  S- the barrel deffinatly mellowed this brew out across the board. Sweet malty smells dominate withe a bit of oak and hops somewhere in there.  T- Taste is this beer's strong point for me. Absolutely different from un oaked arrogant bastard. Malt profile is much more upfront, with a much sweeter taste. The taste of oak is present, but mild. Hops has definatly toned down and become more of a aftertaste than anything else. Also a little bit of alchohol present in the aftertaste. Age and oak has brought this beer complexities to flavor profile and smell. I feel like this bastard is a bit less arrogant and pleasent to be around.  M- Mouthfeel is not bad with a decent amount of carbonation and smoothness.  D- I wouldn't hesitate to have more than one of these 12oz bottles. I have a feeling drinkability would fade with quantity.

As the last dregs of their beer drain down our parching Canadian throats, apparently not to be replenished in the foreseeable future, I'm left to ruefully sip my last OAB and type this ode to its brilliance.  It's a clear brew, the colour of a fresh conker-shell. It smells a bit weird: some molasses, greenery, a herbal tang that is in no way reflected in the flavour, but oh well.  The strength of this beer is the way it grows in your mouth and slugs you with three waves of flavour: a sweet acidity, followed by a resoundingly warm malt explosion that takes over your whole mouth, then as it subsides, a fine bitterness lurking at the back of your tongue. The whole effect is tied together with smoke.

Just enough carbonation to give it the body it needs; but none of that throat burn that an overly carbonated beer can give.  D-this beer is easy drinking.

M-(see above) upfront easy to drink; however, the finish cranks ups the taste buds and lingers (hops, sweetness, carmelly flavors). Not to thick but still a tad sweet for me.  D-Even though the finishing gravity is likely relatively low (1.014-1.017), as Stone tends to mash on the low end, the sweet finish limits its drinkability.

It poured deep muddy copper, with a thick creamy tan head, and it left rings of sticky lace on the glass. The smell and taste were earthy and filled with musty cellar and wood, followed by sweet boozy whisky. The feel was thick and heavy but remarkably smooth.

S - Caramel, dark malts, sugar and spice and everything nice. Can almost smell the hoppy alcohol here. My vocab is not up to snuff obvs.  T/M - Honestly...I am out of practice. Where I live we do not have beers of this caliber and I'm just blown away. So utterly complex. Sweet biscuity up front. Hint of chocolate? Angry hop in the back. Oak floats front to back. Just nuts.

147,8951,eat,3.95,"Shared a bottle with a friend at Volo's Stone release party.  Transparent and dark-copper in colour, this brew has a thin covering of cream-white head and a little lacing. Really nice colour.  Not as powerful a smell as I was expecting. What I can pick out is pineapple, grapefruit and candy. Good smell but there's not enough of it.  This is a really intense and bitter beer. Really earthy hops, unripe grapefruit, dark malt, a little bit woody (though not what you would expect seeing Oaked in the name). The ABV is quite present and only adds to the arrogance of this beer. The finish is one of the driest I've ever experienced. It leaves a feeling in your mouth like you just bit into a whole grapefruit, skin and all. I like it but wouldn't call it well-balanced. The slight touch of sweetness comes nowhere near matching the huge, bitter hops here.  Slightly syrupy feel. Creamy full body and light carbonation. Very nice.  This is too bitter to drink much of. I don't think I would ever want to drink more than one bottle of this in a sitting. I like it but it's too intense and dry.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,ocmpoma,4.25,"A- brown, of course, with nice amber highlights -- almost the same color as the bottle. Possessed a thin, tan head that reduced to film; not much lacing.  S- a layered aroma of hops, malt, and an almost IPA-like citrus background. I don't detect any oak on the nose.  T- compared to 'regular' Arrogant Bastard, this beer is more mellow. Still plenty of up-front hops, but the subtle oak flavoring in the background counterweights and provides a wonderful balancing effect. The IPA effect I got on the nose isn't evident on the palate. But the flavour is robust and also has a wonderful aftertaste.  M- very light. The bitterness hangs around afterwards, but as the ale is on the tongue, it is quite lively and light, not in the least bit heavy.  D- No noticeable alcohol; well-balanced carbonation. Mellow with a nice pucker in the aftertaste. This beer is exceptionally drinkable.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,icetraxx,4.11,"A: An amberish ruby red that is fairly translucent. Pours a very creamy four-finger head into my Schneider Weisse glass. The head sticks around and laces the glass nicely. Beautiful looking beer overall. A perfect 5.  S: Malt, a hint of hops, a little hint of spice, vanilla, ginger, molasses, and a nice dose of oak. Not as aromatic as I would like, but smells damn good to me.  T: Hops dominate with in-your-face oak not far behind. There is a surprising amount of malt in the flavor. The finish is clean with a lingering bitterness. Any alcohol is well hidden. I feel that the oak and age do distract from the fruity hoppiness of regular AB, and that the oak isn't strong enough to add a ton of complexity on its own, it is almost fighting with the other elements in this beer. The slightest warming suggestion from spice, or is that alcohol? A hint of cherry on the finish. Pretty good, but the flavor isn't very powerful overall.  M: Pretty thick and creamy for the style.  D: I could put this one away and possibly have another, but I might get a little bored of it after awhile.  O: This one is a little more boring than I thought it would be, the age has muted the hops a little too much while the oak chips don't impart the refined oak flavor that I look for in a good oak-aged beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

D: Very drinkable, the alcohol is well hidden and the beer has many complex tastes which make it very enjoyable.

It's ok, but not too much going on for a barrel aged brew. Other contenders in the same style are much better,  M: Very good amount of carbonation  D: This brew goes down perfectly easy. No complaints here at all.  All in all, this is a decent brew to try at least once. If you like a decent amount of hops, you might enjoy this a little more.

S: Wow! You get some fantastic floral/fruity hops right up front with a hint of grapefruit. A bit of banana seems to show up as the beer warms. Perhaps one of the best smelling beers I've had in a while.  T: This beer has a great malty sweetness on the tongue and is quite complex. There are some flavors here that might take me another bottle or two to figure out. It finishes with that grapefruit flavor from the hops. I've had other brews that have over done the grapefruit flavor but this beer seems to have the perfect balance. I nice bitter finish to balance that sweetness.  M: Medium body, nice and smooth. Carbonation is perfect, probably on the average to low side.  D: I picked this one up on the recommendation of a friend and I can see why it's one of his favorites. Stone Brewing Company has managed to create a nice drinkable full flavored ale with a fairly high ABV but I don't think you'd know unless someone told you. It wouldn't be a beer I'd drink all night but rather one that I'd enjoy from time to time.

147,8951,MrDanno96,4.17,"12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams perfect pint glass. This was an extra I got from a recent trade with BA Doodler. Thank you sir!  A: Pours a hazy deep amber color. A little less than a finger of fluffy off-white head sits atop this oaked beast. Lots of sticky lacing.  S: Amazingly sweet hops meet the nose. Lots of citrus aromas, especially grapefruit are dominant. I detect another Stone hop bomb here.  T/M: As was to be expected there was an explosion of sweet and bitter hops right on the first sip. Initial hints of pine and biscuity malts give way to some citric sweetness in the mid palate before the hops turn brutally bitter on the finish and tear at your tongue. Some wood (oak) and smokiness are also pretty apparent in the aftermath of this hop attack. I think the oak has both enhanced the power of the hops in this brew and dried out the finish a bit. The quaff has a nice medium body with a good bite provided by the carbonation that complements the bitter hops nicely. This brew is just as, if not more, arrogant than its little brother. My palate is left with a distinct feeling of unworthiness after each sip.  D: Another solid offering from Stone. The 7.2 abv leaves this one somewhere between the realm of session brew and sipper. I enjoyed all the complexities presented by this beer, but the bitterness of the hops and dryness of the oak became just a bit overwhelming by the end of the bottle. My palate was all but destroyed by the end of the 12 oz (Like the bottle says, I'm not worthy!). That being said, I definitely enjoyed my single 12 oz bottle and will almost surely drink this one again, albeit in small quantities.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Trizzle,4.53,"Tried this one a few weeks ago but had had too many beers at the time to be trusted to write a sensible review. Loved it then and love it now.  A thick dense head sits a-top a gorgeous clear autumnal red body. Amazing lace. 100%.  Huge dried pineapple and grapefruit aromas, some caramel malt, hop oil and a very mild and exciting hint of yeast funk: think fruity esters rather than sour lambic.  Floral hops to begin, a mild honeyed malt through the middle, more pineapple, some dry hop notes, and lingering a floral citrus and dry grapefruit. The 7.2% only helps to carry the flavour and adds a slight warmth. Delicious.  Feels smooth and buttery with ideal mid-high (for the style) level of carbonation.  Unfortunately, even at &gt; 7%, I think I could drink quite a few of these..  I grabbed the last 3 of these at Utobeer at Borough market London.

One of the strongest smelling brews I've come into contact with.  T: Pine and citrus with an oak finish. Hops are subdued in comparison to it's brother brew. This isn't as brutal on the palate as original A.B., but definitely a very good, unique brew.  M: Oily and moderately thick, presumably due to the hops. Solid feel to this one.  D: I hadn't been a fan of brews with excessive hops until I had A.B. The oaked version is slightly different, but also a bit mellow in comparison to A.B. Either way, one can't go wrong with either version of A.B. A good, hearty brew that is worthy of a session.

Smells like hops, pine,caramel malts, and a hint of bourbon at the end.  Tastes a lot like the original at first. The hops right up front then a caramel flavor followed by the piney taste. It finishes however with a weird bourbon flavor. Somehow it just doesn't taste right to me. Like they used pressboard bourbon barrels or something.  Medium bodied decent carbonation to it. Nice and smooth right up til the end when the wood chip flavor kicks in.  I truthfully wouldn't ever get this on my own. I just don't like the flavor that the ""oaked"" adds to it.

This bottle is the freshed I've encountered so far.  This beer looks like the regular AB ... mahogany, scarlet color, fluffy head with some nice lacing. Looks inviting.  The smell that immediately comes to mind is the pit inside a nectarine. I'm impressed. Aroma is a tropical fruit tour de force. The oak so far is subtle, but lurking.  The oak is right there on the roof of my mouth after the few initial gulps. Pineapple & mango battle with the grapefruit. The malts almost get lost, but they are there with a caramel/toast/charcoal aftertaste.  Surprisingly, the alcohol never shows up and the complexity of flavors invites more sips.

Great lacing that does not seem to move whatsoever. The scent smacks you in the nose with a bouquet of citrus and pine notes. Also great aromas of roasted malt and grapefruit abound. Taste seems to be dominated by a hop bitterness, finishes with a dry, more pronounced grapefruit flavor at the end. The oak aging seems to mellow this bastard out a bit, especially compared to the original bastard. The feel is somewhat thick and creamy, a very substantial brew in my book.

M: Medium bodied beer with good carbonation and although bitter, it's quite smooth. No alcohol burn is noticable.  D: It definetly doesn't hide the hops which might make it a little less drinkable to some.  Overall, I'm a fan of this beer.

147,8951,Lldeegan,4.28,"Pours a dark copper, deep rust color with an off-white head that recedes and leaves some minimal lacing. Its deep colors and healthy head of foam lend to a very appealing visual. The nose is sweet malt, nuttiness, some vinous notes, which I believe are a result of the oak aging. The smell is lacking the floral hop smells of pine and grapefruit that I expected as the aging has definitely subdued the bold hops in this version of the Bastard. The taste, like the smell is sweet malt up front which is more forward than the original Arrogant Bastard, then floral hops become apparent and create a complex flavor with grapefruit then a hint of smoke and an earthy finish. It's a pretty full-bodied beer, good carbonation and minor residual stickiness.  This beer does not have the undeniable palate presence of the original Arrogant Bastard, not that it's a bad thing. It is much more mellow, refined and the bitterness is definitely diminished. The oak has created a whole different beer, with subdued hops and sweet, nutty malt. It is different but still has a robust flavor, don't make a mistake, it will conquer any palate or food pairing that is unworthy.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Taste: This beer hits you with sweet malt flavors right off the bat. The oak aged factor is definitely noticeable, and I think I really like it. Later on the hops bitterness really comes through. I feel like I'm tasting some alcohol, but it really doesn't have that high of a ABV rating.  Mouthfeel: Very thick and sticky. Nothing wrong with that but it does affect the drinkability.

A: Clear ruby-brown body glitters underneath a 3/8"" head of creamy tan foam that slowly settles into a solid cap that leaves abundant, ultra-fine lacing. Great looking pour.  S: Hard to discern much at all; this might be because I'm getting over a cold (although I could smell plenty in my prior beer, a Weyerbacher Double Simcoe on cask), or because of the straight-sided glass (although the DIPA was served in the same vessel), but either way I can't smell much beyond a vague oaky sweetness.  T: Certainly doesn't suffer from a lack of flavor - huge vinous oak at first, followed by some fruity/caramel malt and a nicely bitter hop finish (more pine than anything else, with maybe some grapefruit). Very dry aftertaste. Not nearly as overtly hoppy as regular AB, but the oak certainly makes up for it. I love this beer.  M: Smooth, slightly sticky medium body with loads and loads of roiling, velvety, foamy carbonation. Probably a touch overcarbonated, but I love the explosion of bubbles.  D: The dryness of the oak and hops can get a bit oppressive, even though the alcohol is almost completely hidden.

Well, the first aromas to hit my nose are familiar. A closer inspection reveals some earthier notes a woody potting soil? I can detect booze and funky hop aromas. Minty, citric, floral, dry and woody. The oak still cant tame the Bastard but I do think its the culprit for the dryer taste. I am gonna have to go against the grain here and say I would rather have the original over the oaked... Im not worthy.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Beerandraiderfan,4.04,"A bastardization of what you get when you mix some orange, amber, brown and red color ale. Looks impressive. Smell is even more impressive, not as viscious as the non oaked version.  In fact, the oak seems to mellow out the whole ale, as opposed to offering a more complex beer necessarily. The usual chinook and cascade hop dominance with a very strong malt backbone, but the oak seems almost like they dry hopped it with oak chips as well. Mouthfeel thins through the bottle, but this remains a surprisingly drinkable beer, not nearly as demanding of a drink as the other versions of bastard ale.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Some hidden chocolate malts at the finish, although very subtle  M- Heavy, bold, and creamy. Goes down smooth, with a beautifully sophisticated creaminess  D- For such a complex beer, its not a tough job to hammer this one down. The carbonation is perfect, the smoothness is to die for, and the overall alcohol burn with lingering effects is wonderful....This beer is outstanding",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,DrDoitchbig,4.65,"Appearance: Poured a fairly opaque rusty color somewhere in limbo between a mahogany brown and orange. When held to the light there is an apparent haziness and the color changes to burgundy. The tan tinged head scurries away rather quickly and leaves some dimples of lacing.  Smell: Can't say I'm surprised here. I'm picking up mostly on the oak. There's a sweet alcohol smell wafting around. Perhaps a whisper of hops, but it's held at bay by the oak.  Taste: I'm a bit surprised at how laid back and smooth this is, not that that's a bad thing. Very earthen oak tones from the smell, followed with a vanilla like sweetness. Picking up a lot of caramel in the middle and finally a floral hop bite shines through on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Very complex. Medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. I don't quite know how they've pulled this off but it has an exceptional creaminess to it, which flips into a resiny coating bitterness at the end of each sip.  Drinkability: Ridiculously easy drinking for something over 7%. The only area where the alcohol reared it's head was the aroma. The only thing that would keep me from having quite a few is the price-tag, but I can't really knock it here for that.  I'm definitely a fan of the original Arrogant Bastard, but I feel confident in saying this trumps it in my mind. The oak adds some great depth to an already tasty beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Lacing is great to, looks to be a little delicious.  S- Hints of a dark fruity sweetness that is soon rushed away by a hop aroma with the faintest hint of alcohol.  T- Was a little intimidated to taste this beer while I built my palate, but it was certainly worth the wait! The same dark fruit sweetness enters your mouth for a moment before a hop oil taste dominates the palate. Although only 7.2%, the alcohol is mildly present in this beer, but it seems to go along with the rest of the bold taste nicely.  M- Nice crisp medium to full body that helps make this a great beer for any time of year.

Aroma is pretty strong, fruits, for some reason...belgian yeast is coming to mind. Sweet smell. Taste is close to an DIPA, which didn't quite match the aroma.

The aroma includes a healthy dose of caramel malty sweetness and some earthy pine notes. The oak is a bit hidden to me.  The taste is another nice combination of caramel malt sweetness and a heavier bitterness that follows, including pine and citrus. A nutty/earthy finish.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied. It seems like there could be a bit more carbonation. It is quite smooth despite this and leaves a nice bitterness on the palate at the finish.  This is interesting, cause this is a good beer that seems to present all of the requirements to a high level, but does not seem to exceed them.

The oak is noticeable but not particularly prominent. Overall a nice complex flavor!  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth. There is a mild amount of carbonation.  Drinkability is pretty nice.

Initial aroma is quite floral as the hops make their presence known. A hint of caramel shows up in the back along with the oak addition. Very fresh and inviting.  Taste gives a great mix of hoppy and malty flavors. Starts out with some caramel and vanilla upfront and is soon followed by a mildly hoppy presence in the middle. The finish is still lightly hoppy with a little pepper but at this point, the wood tones are cleanly evident.  Medium body and medium carbonation with a slightly dry finish. Not sure if this is better or worse than the regular AB, all I know is both are great and quite tasty.

147,8951,sweemzander,4,"12oz. bottle poured into an imperial pint. Best by 12-08-2009.  (A)- Pours a hazy mahogany amber color that produced a solid tan to orange colored head that dissipated after a minute or two.  (S)- A big piney yet malty sweetness. Very dry with lemon & lime citrus. Bits of butterscotch.  (T)- Again, very very dry with very piney citrus. Some light maltiness of roasted butterscotch. Finishes dry & woody.  (M)- Good carbonation level with good balance too. Very dry with light malts. Almost chewy in how dense it feels but not overly so like a stout would be.  (D)- A good beer with an extremely dry feel that is made even drier with the oak barrel. Definitely a winner, but I think I would rather just reach for the regular Arrogant Bastard; its less expensive and easier to find, and perhaps just as good.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Thick off tan head, loads of retention  Smell, akin to the standard Arrogant Bastard but with a touch of oak in the background. The nose is full of fresh American hops (notably Amarillo)  Taste, rich thick malt encased hops. Ballsy profile. Heaps of Amarillo hops punctuated by robust malt, little touch of caramel sweetness on the finish and a nice lingering bitterness.  Not quite as great as on tap, in New York but still a superbly tasty strong ale. The original I still think remains king, the oak seems to cut the hops back a little and mutes the balance of flavour",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,DawnL,3.75,"I was actually rather dissapointed by the taste. Everything else was fine - but the oak came through a bit too strong. It masked some of the great hops in the original Arrogant Bastard. It also added too much vanilla undertone to it. This beer reminded me of a well-made chardonnay that got pummeled by oak. It's a great beer, but it could have been more nuanced. From my understanding, there is quite a bit of bottle variation in this particular beer.

There's a nice spiciness to it as well that I would classify as lemon zest (resulting from the hops) and cloves. In the finish, the big oaky flavors and the spice sort of tapers off into a smooth, clean finish leaving a lingering woodiness that is not vanilla-y like the oak flavors I mentioned above  M- So creamy and nice.

Not the hoppiest aroma I have had, but an inviting one nonetheless.  Malt sweetness comes into play first but is quickly replaced by a lemony citrus, which gives way to a smooth oak bitterness. The oak really helps in smoothing out the harsh, palate scraping quality of the original Arrogant Bastard.  The beer feels light and oily but they are by no means negative characteristics.

Appearance: Crystal clear orange-brown body with randomly-placed shades of red. Head is initially foamy and khaki-colored, but eventually settles as a creamy, sticky cap. Very nice head retention on the whole and lots of web-like lacing.  Smell: Big, buttery oak dominates the nose. A better description might be buttered popcorn with some sweet oak and hints of vanilla. Sweet and pleasant. Hardly comparable to regular Arrogant Bastard.  Taste: Buttery oak, caramel, and resinous piney hops. Not much bitterness unfortunately. Similar to regular Arrogant Bastard, but oakier/butterier and all around dulled.  Mouthfeel: This felt surprisingly watery. Carbonation was very low (borderline flat) and body was definitely thin. On top of that, bitterness and alcoholic kick were both weak.  Drinkability: While this was certainly smoother and easier than regular AB, I really missed that extra arrogance. Oaked Arrogant Bastard on-tap was just too flat and dull.

Apart from that, very nice pungent hoppiness, some pronounced maltiness and some pepper and fruit notes (grapefruit, cherry, maybe raisins). As intriguing as it may get.  T - Some vanilla and caramel, immediately followed by a strong hop bite (very citrus-like, mostly grapefruit notes, reminiscent of many good American IPA's) and hints of dark fruit. Also some peppercorn-like spiciness. The finish is dry; it has got some bitterness, a bit of breadiness, and plenty of oak. Delicious!  M - Medium-bodied, with very moderate carbonation.

The head stayed firm the entire ride through, and retention was excellent.  Smell: I get alot of sweet malts up front, more so then regular Arrogant Bastard. Very subtle hop aromas are prevalent as well. Lots of darker fruit popping out here, a touch of alcohol, and some wood like aromas. Very aromatic.  Taste: Caramel malts really show up big time, compared to Arrogant Bastard, the maltiness really stands out, although a deep citrus flavor starts to show up when this warms up a bit. I also get bits of oak, dried fruit, and a really subtle candy like sweetness that overtakes the palate. Very bold and flavorful.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, the malt makes this bastard extra smooth on the tongue. Decent carbonation, a small bitterness from the hops is present but not as much as the regular AB.  Drinkability: I love how smooth this beer is, the malts really make this thing a treat to sip and savor. Letting it warm up shows the good hop aromas are still around. Coming in at 7.2% ABV, this bastard is dangerously drinkable, and very easy to session with.

Soon after, some piney, sappy hops make their way into the aroma, with some dark fruitiness following. Not too much in the way of oakiness in the nose, but it smells awesome.  When the beer first hits my tongue, I immediately notice the maltiness that was presented in the nose. The bready and caramel malt tones wash over the palate, then are chased away by some evergreen and citrus hop flavor. Just as I was about to ask, ""What makes this oaked?"", the oakiness shows up at the end of the sip and smooths everything out. A very complex yet delicious flavor. Easily a 5.0.  Awesome mouthfeel as well. Medium bodied with a simple amount of carbonation and an alcohol presence that isn't brutal, it warms my tongue a bit just to let me know it's there. A lot smoother than the original Arrogant Bastard, as I remember.  Mmmm... for a beer that's marketed as being aggressive, this is a lot smoother than it's non-treed brother. I really liked the original AB, this one is exceptional. The drinkability on this is insane, I could drink several in one sitting. An aggressive beer that is complex and absolutely delicious.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Duhast500,3.85,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a point glass.  The color is a dark orange-amber with three finger of brownish foamy head and some think lacing that takes some time to dissipate.  The smell is an oatmeal flavor mixed with a wet hoppy, funk flavor that is strong to the nose. Gives off a bit of a bready almost yeasty flavor as well.  The taste is a spicy oat flavor with some strong hop character. Some nice wet hop flavor at first with some aggressive toasty flavor in the background with some more of that funkiness..  The feel of this beer is a bit light with low carbonation and a good drinkability.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,JerzDevl2000,4.18,"Picked this up a few weeks back in Totowa because it's Stone and dammit, I was able to get this in a single bottle! I""ve never had this and I've hard lots of good things about this beer. Sure enough, they're alll true...this is certainly the real deal and one of the smoothest brews that I've had in a long time.  This beer had one of the most gorgeous hues I've seen in a long time - a radiant reddish-brown with a nice head to go along with it. The lacing wasn't anywhere to be seen but that was about the only thing wrong with this. As I said before, this is very smooth and had a very woody and nutty taste to this. The hops are there - succinct and almost dry, but never overwhelming. I can't really taste the citrus or lemon flavors that a lot of reviewers have commented on but I could sense the pine and metallic notes just a bit. The aftertaste has the hop presence lingering with just a bit of lemon zest but overall, this goes down very easy for an American Strong Ale.  Part of that is because the alcohol is seemingly only the number on the bottle. It doesn't feel anywhere close to 7.20% and I would almost qualify this as a session beer, regardless of how high that % is. This is an absolute winner and worthy of the accolades that everyone has given it on here. This is a beer that's strong in craft and taste but not in it's punch. A worthy achievement indeed!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,EgadBananas,4.17,"Very much like the normal arrogant. I find this to be a tad smoother. Theres still a lot of crisp, hoppy bitterness to the smell and taste. Theres also a hint of something citrus in there as well. The alcohol taps you on the shoulder just to let you know its there.  This is great, and I would probably take this over the normal Bastard due to it's inhanced comlexity and hightened drinkability.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,Intimidtor,2.75,I have enjotyed most American Strong Ales that I've had. This one is not for me. I think I would love this beer without the oak after taste. Poured from bottle into clean glass. About 1/4 inch of head. Smelled inviting and first taste had me questioning what it was I just tasted. Continued on and it never got better. I'm not saying this is a bad beer becase many like it. Just not for me. Ill stick with Great Lakes Nosferatu for an American Strong Ale.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,boogyman,4.55,"Love the regular ABA, am looking forward to the oaked version.  A- Pours a dark amber to a brownish color. Looks very clear with some bubbles comes up from the bottom. The thick 2 finger head has good retention and doesn't fully go away during the drink. Suds hang around the sides of the glass as I drink. Lacing is pretty sticky hanging around a while.  S- First thing I smell is the citrus hoppyness of the beer. At the same time though, I also get some ever so slight burnt woody smell. The fruityness does dominate the nose, however.  T- Wow, pretty crazy on the flavors. It starts off with some citrus grapefruit lemony flavors then morphs into some woody burnt oakyness then back to the hops then a nice tingle of the boozyness. It is like my palate can't decide what it wants to do. I am loving the taste of this brew.  M- Carbonation is perfect. I can feel the carbonation but it does not bite too hard and at the same time it is smooth going down. Boozyness is perfect, hoppy bitter alcohol taste lingers in the mouth begging for the next sip to wash it down and replace it for more.  D- I most definitely could have myself many of these in one session. I think I may like this more then the original. I am gonna be going back to buy some more of this.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Taste caramell and honey with some earthy under tones and some boozeyness. Nice hoppy bitterness.... Beer still has a nice head on it bout half way done with it.  Big mouthfeel medium heavy body almost porterish.  Really great in taste but packs a punch.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

T - Wow...some incredibly complex flavors going on here. A strong taste of hops with strong malty flavors of roasted coffee and hints of chocolate rounding out the flavor. Incredibly balanced.  M - Medium body with just enough carbonation, but not enough to take away from the incredible creamy smoothness present here.  D - Despite the relatively high alcohol content and very strong flavors, I can safely say that I could easily put away at least several of these at a time if I were so inclined.  What a wonderfully complex but balanced beer; I can't say I've ever had anything like it.

As it warms, however, scents of fruit and alcohol come out. In contrast to the mild aroma, there is nothing non-distinct about the flavor. Every sip is jam-packed with flavor, with a rich, dry fruitiness and notes of caramel contrasting with a potent, woodsy hop bitterness. The heat of the alcohol is apparent, but it is not overwhelming, and the rich smoothness of the beer helps to tame the booziness. Despite the many-faceted boldness in the flavor, it is quite drinkable. Two thumbs up... enjoyed every sip.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,CHILLINDYLAN,4.37,"Dark semi-opaque browned amber with red highlights. Good chunk of creamy tanned head. With sticky lacing.  Sweet toasty caramel with an earthy oak and woody aroma. The hops are earthy pine, herbal, and a touch of grapefruit. The alcohol is also apparent.  Roasty earthy woody oaky. Toasty toffee. Pine, spicy resins, hint of grapefruit. Bitterness is smooth and mellow with earthy pine and oak. Warming alcohol bite that goes so well with this oaky brew.  Smooth, mellowed beast, dry, nice full body.  Great character in this beer.

147,8951,SkunkWorks,4.45,"I saw this in my local beer store after not seeing it anywhere for the longest time so I decided to pick it up and I am glad I did. It pours a dark orange, almost brown, with a solid head formation (better than Arrogant Bastard if I recall correctly). The lacing it leaves lingers for a few minutes before dissipating.  As for the taste, imagine a more mild, drinkable Arrogant Bastard. The oak definitely takes away a lot of Arrogant Bastard's harshness and makes it a less challenging beer. It retains the bitterness but adds a bit of complexity.  Overall, I love this beer! Another hit by Stone. I'm glad I have five more sitting in my beer fridge. Definitely pick this one up!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,mynie,4.53,"Really? I've never had this before? Hmm...  The bottle says it expires today.  Aside from that, pours absolutely wonderful considering its ABV. Deep, dark translucent orange red with a thick, tight, and retentive head that like the layer of suds above a mopbucket.  Smells like caramel, hops, and smoothness. Were I not accustomed to wonderfully oak aged beers, I wouldn't pick it up. It's not a bourbon aging, remember. It's just deep, soft woodiness that comes across like vanilla and fragrant cigar tobacco.  Tastes like it smells only somehow smoother. Big, thick toffee malts without any icky syrupiness or other painfully intense nodes. Soft vanilla wood in the middle, finishing on thick, bitter sour American hops.  Super intense yet also super smooth and drinkable. World class.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Aroma is powerfully delicious, caramelized apricot, grapefruit, pine. I don't detect oak. The hoppiness of this string beer hits hard up front, with full-on grapefruity bitterness, balnced breifly by a rich mouthfeel then a lingering very bitter finish. Very delicious, but a bit exhausting and bit unbalanced. I would believe this to be a DIPA.

Languishing above is a beautiful two finger head, which diminishes slowly to a persistent ring and bubbly cap. A gentle swirl produces lush mountain ranges of lace cling. Mmm.  The smell seems not as strong as regular AB. but it's been a while since my last AB. It brings back memories though, as sweet citus, mild spicy notes, even milder yeast and floral hints effervesce gently into my nasal pleasure centers.  The flavor seems gentler as well, perhaps not in amplitude, but in a way of mixing the flavors that makes it less abrupt. Delicious. Gentle malt notes of bread and light caramel mingle with sweet citrus (mmm,orange rind, grapefruit, tangerine), very mild oak notes, and crest into an herbal/floral/bitter finish that is clean and juicy side of dry. The beer has warmed now, and the oak is starting to shine, nice, it really mixes in well, also some light vanilla sneaking in, the finish is drier and longer. Wow.  Like its oakless brother, OAB has perfect mouthfeel for a strong ale. It promotes a finish of astounding clarity, cleanliness, and flavor.  Drinkability? Off the charts.

Low aroma of floral and citrus hops, faint maltiness.  Flavor of muted malt upfront, citrus hops, and strong woody, earthy flavors. Hints of vanilla poke through, but it's mostly woody. Not so much oaky, just woody and becoming more one-dimensional as I sip.  Moderate carbonation, full mouthfeel, but very tannic and puckery.

Sweet malts and alcohol round out the aroma.  Taste is a pleasant balance of grainy malt and loud hop bitterness. Oak pleasantly lingers in the aftertaste.  Mouth feel is fairly viscous (solid medium to medium-full). The carbonation is just right for the amount of bitterness present in this brew.  Overall, a deep and complex offering.

When you smell this beer, you think you know what to expect in the taste....the woody oak, bitter hops and fantastic sweetness are all well accounted for by the nose...but when the taste buds indulge themselves, the mouth could easily brag to the nose about what it's missing!  The taste? hops hops hops! and the oak aging has seeped its way into this beer for sure. This, along with certain fruits make the immediate taste a very bitter one... a bitterness that lingers pleasantly for a long, long time. Beyond the bitterness, it's pure complexity and balance that give this such a world class taste. Almost like a fine wine, grapes and grapefruit are apparent, and the alcohol is well hidden. If you don't like a bitter beer, you might want to pass this one up...but you'll be missing out on a fantastic brew. Easily one of my favorite beers I've ever tasted.

147,8951,sisuspeed,4.83,"Poured this one into a pint glass. The beer has a reddish-brown amber color to it, with a nice off-white (slightly yellowish) head. The head is nice and sudsy and leaves lacing down the sides of the glass.  The aroma is, like most Stone beers, hoppy. Lots of hop aroma for a beer that is technically not an IPA. Underneath the earthy hop aroma is a strong, sweet malt smell that lets you know there is substance to this beer. There is also a slightly woody/piney aroma mixed with vanilla that mingles with the two dominant characters.  The flavor is like heaven on earth. Or hell, if you're more into that. Wow, this stuff tastes amazing. Somewhat syrupy sweet malts mix with a strong dose of citrus-laden, bitter hops. Delicious and well balanced. Vanilla notes are there as well and help smooth things out. The most hidden flavor is the oak, but the wood taste is still there and well done. Enough oak to give this beer a more refined flavor, but not enough to turn it into a woody mess.  The mouthfeel is rich and creamy. The head sustains very well throughout the drinking of beer and aids in trapping many of the aromatics from escaping.  The drinkability is superb and somewhat scary. The 7.2% ABV is virtually unnoticeable and could easily creep up on you. I could drink this nectar of the gods all night. Excellent job Stone!

I get silky-sweet floral notes of hop and a solid malt presence before Stone's signature kick in the nads bitter finish. Carbonation give some citrus character and adds bite to an expanding body that would otherwise feel medium in weight. Quite smooth. Lingering aftertaste of pear. Beautiful lacing. There's a nice rounded wood chip flavor folded in, but it doesn't taste like I'm drinking wood so kudos there.  The bitterness knocks my tongue out after awhile and makes my mouth dry quickly.

The oak notes are the first thing I notice in the taste, followed by a robust hop presence that is accompanied by a nice malt backbone. A bit of a smoky flavor comes through on the finish, as well.  Mouthfeel is rich and full without being overbearing, carbonation is somewhat subtle but undoubtedly sufficient.

Nice balance with quite a bit going on. Pretty straight forward flavor, but lacks in complexity.  Creamy smooth feel. Nice amount of bubbling to keep the flavor coming.  Good drinkability.

147,8951,eallured,4.48,"Pours red-brown with thick, long lasting tan head, large bubbles rising through the viscous liquid. Some lacing left as it slowly recedes and as of now there is still a quarter inch of foam on the sides and only one bare spot in the middle. Aroma is rich with dried fruits and aromatic wood character, freshly milled, not as much like toasted oak. Hops add a juicyness and a bit of pine. First taste sensation is sweet, but not overly so, with that dried fruit, white raisins maybe, quickly establishing a presence and the soft depth of oak creeping in from the sides and smoothing out the swallow. There is little alcohol burn for the abv. To my tastes, the smooth, clean and not dominant but not subtle hop bitterness adds needed balance to this sweet, complex brew. Carbonation is moderate to light for an American ale. Medium-thick, definitely a tongue coater, but it doesn't finish with to much stickyness thanks to the hops. Overall this is a full mouth experience with many differnt flavors adding to the overall experience.

The head doesn't have much lacing onto the glass, as it only grips the glass for around a second or two before falling back into place. The smell is a step higher than its appearance. Multiple whiffs dictate the aromas, which are full of hop characteristics, oak chips and caramel malt. Definitely reminiscent of the regular Bastard.  The flavor profile is really full of hops upfront with the oak wood chips and roasted malt following through. For an aged beer, the hops are still pretty prevalent throughout the brew. There isn't as much bitterness as the original Bastard and at 7.2% ABV, I really couldn't detect any alcohol palpable on the tongue, which really increases drinkability. I was really impressed. The Oaked AB has a medium-bodied and creamy mouthfeel with bold flavors. Drinkability is pretty decent - definitely needs its time for you to finish it.

I like the oak flavor, but the alcohol that it brings with it is too much. I should be able to finish this fine, however.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Sweet caramel malts, some absolutely wonderful dark fruit, with a wonderfully pungent floral hop presence. I pay a lot of attention to the oak, which actually manages to overshadow the hops to a certain extent on the taste with a nice vanilla goodness, which complements the dark fruit very well.  M: Great, fully body with a nice, extended finish.  D: Who can ever complain about anything with the words ""Arrogant Bastard"" in its title? It's complex, yet smooth, yet full and robust.

147,8951,morimech,3.73,"Review #600. I hope this arrogant beer can live up to this milestone. Pours a magahony color with two fingers of off-white head that had excellant retention. The head slowly settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is not what I expected. I expected some of the oak to come through but all I smell is pungent hops. The hops give off pine resin and some light citrus aromas. It has been awhile since I have tasted regular Arrogant Bastard so I do not know how different the oaked version compares. Again any oaked elements are very subtle. Overall very hoppy and resiny flavor and no balance. Bitterness is high. Decent mouthfeel and carbonation. The bitterness hurts the mouthfeel because of the lingering bitter aftertaste. Another unbalanced, highly hopped and bitter beer. Enjoyable if that is your thing.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,sjccmd,4.23,"Enjoy by date of July 09...I decided I'd go for it anyway since I figured age wouldn't be too detrimental  Pours ruby red/brown with a hint of murkiness. Nice fluffy light tan head which fades relatively quickly but seems to suddenly stop with a decent lacing  Pine and citrus hops up front, bright fruity character, followed by a nice smokiness with toasted malts and oak.  The first sip is (like the regular bastard) a surprising punch of bitterness. Subsequent sips reveal more of the oak character. I'm pretty surprised hops are still as present as they are. Especially considering it's already been aged.  The mouthfeel is nice and slick. It's thick enough to avoid being watery and there's a nice tinge of carbonation.  The amount of bitterness keeps me from guzzling it and it does seem to drink like it has more alcohol, but it's a beer that's hard to put down.  Overall there's very little bad to say about it. However, it doesn't really differentiate itself from the regular bastard (still waiting to get a hold of the double bastard). And, even though a 6-pack contains six of these, I'd usually prefer to buy a single bomber. Even though it's not that far out of date, it seems to handle age just fine.  Edit: I don't know if I just missed it with the first bottle, but this next bottle revealed a lot more oak and vanilla",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Gosox8787,4.52,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a glass. Color was light brown to dark auburn and slighty cloudy. The one finger, light tan head shows good retention throughout. The aroma hits first with a strong malt presencein caramel and toffee notes. This is balanced with a strong, pine hop aroma. The flavor hits first with a strong hop kick, in the form of pine notes, which is tempered with slight oak and mint notes from the oak aging. There is a nice malt backboneto offer some good balance. Mouthfeel is full bodied, slighty chewy and a little carbonation is present. Drinkablility is good, the moderate booze is well hidden and the flavor is drinkable, but also strong.  Overall, a great beer with great, potent flavors. One of Stone's best offering and a must try.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Surprisingly the oak seems to be knocked to the background in flavor where the hops come to the foreground  Mouthfeel: light on the tongue with a bit of a bitter bite to it  Drinkability: it's a pretty heavy beer with 7% abv, slightly bitter but smooth, not really an everyday beer but like a good cigar this beer nicely compliments a good occasion",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,steelerguy,4.13,"A - This is one attractive beer! Can something be bright but dark...yes! This beer is so nice and clear, but a dark brown with hints of ruby. Nice head that fades to a full but thin cover and stays like that.  S - Big bold aroma of the Bastard, but the oak aroma is hard and heavy. They were not joking around with the oak chips and you can definitely smell them. Does take something away from the hops and malt which is what is so great about Arrogant Bastard Ale. Not sure how many don't detect oak, to me the oak stands out and tackles the toffee malt and hop aromas in the standard.  T - Those hops hit hard, followed by a mountain of malt. The oak is more balanced here than in the aroma. The malt really stands out here and you can get taste the roasted and kilned malts, toffee and chocolate are pronounced. Unfortunately, some of the bold character is removed and smoothed out by the oak. Lots of people I know like the smoother more rounded flavors resented by the oaked version, but I like to have my ass handed to me by the gargoyle.  M - Perfect? Not sure...but damn close! Just feels so smooth, not a lot of carbonation to get in the way of the bold flavors, but enough to keep the finish crisp. They didn't attenuate the hell out of this and left some residual sugars around to balance it out. The oak probably helps in this regard too, just wish it was not at the expense of the flavor (to me).  D - You can sit down and enjoy a few of these as long as you are sipping. This is not a quaffing beer, but on a nice evening or with food, the smoothness of greatly appreciated.  Overall, I like this beer...but I must admit, I prefer to leave the oak out...just like in my white wines.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,RomaniIteDomum,4.35,"Poured form bottle into pint glass. Great dark amber color with a toasted cream head. Large head goes down to a nice, well-maintained head with great lacing.  Smell is great, lots of bright hops and a little hint of malt. No oak, which was a little disappointing, but the smell is wonderful regardless.  There is a good amount of hop up front and a nice sweet malty finish. There is a little oak in the finish, but not as much as I would have hoped.  The carbonation is lively and the beer has a enough body to stay interesting. The dryness of the hops and the lingering sweetness of the malt make you anticipate the next sip. Great feeling.  This is a very drinkable beer. I could see myself ordering a few at the bar and following them with a nice sweet stout. Cost is a little prohibitive, but it is a wonderful treat.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,mdale13,4.4,"A- Dark brown/red with bright highlights. Thin white head. Poured from a bottle into a snifter.  S- Hops, grass, some carmels, slight hint of oak.  T- Hops up front. Taste leads to some faint citrus, fruity notes, carmels, a little grass, and the perfect taste of oak. The oak flavor really enhances as the beer warms.  M- Oily in the mouth. Give my tongue a nice, sharp bitter feel.  D- Very drinkable. Id have no problem putting a few of these down.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,craftaholic,4.33,"Appearance: Extremely carbonated, with a decent soapy foam that leaves behind a nice lacing. Has a beautiful deep amber/ruby appearance which is a little browner than the original AB.  Smell: Has a strong earthy hop and caramelized toffee scent that combines nice with the oak.  Taste: A well rounded malt which tastes much like the original but goes down so much smoother. The oak subdues the hop that's present in the original and allows more of a malty chocolate taste to come through.  Mouthfeel: Has a creamy fizzy quality but also leaves behind a citrus zest almost acidic aftertaste.  Drinkability: Definitely falls in line with the rest of the stone line and this one aims to please for those looking for a smoother brew with the same flavor.  Overall: I appreciate what they did here with the added oak character, although I almost feel like the marketing mock is humorous considering they dare you to drink it and then you are rewarded with a smooth ale even if it is still a strong one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Smells excellent, nice earthy, woody and hoppy notes to it. Just a bit of sweetness on the nose as compared to the regular version.  Very tasty, better than the regular. Much smoother, you can taste a bit of oak on it, and it leaves a good flavor in your mouth. Still a bit sticky like the regular one. Overall an awesome beer!

Head is a little bit thin but sticks to the glass like crazy. The aroma is mainly malts with a touch of caramel. To me it is similar to the original version. My nose is not getting anything more. The taste is a bit different. The awesome bitterness is still here with a touch of woods behind. Slightly maple. The drinkability is good but I think the original has more. The beer is medium body. What still amaze me of this beer, Oaked or Un-Oaked Arrogant Bastard I mean, is the feeling in the mouth... very good.  A very good beer in my opinion. However, if I had to pick one of the two, I would pick the original... just my two cents.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,MaxBrews,4.6,"12 oz bottle poured into duvel cos its my favorite glass. Tasted after the original arrogant bastard.  Appearance: Pours with a one finger head that quickly dissipates into a creamy lacing. Head retenion and size are a bit less then the non oaked version but lacing is creamier. A dark brownish red that you can only see through when held up to light. Appears more brown then ruby colored when compared to the non-oaked version.  Smell: You get a rustic oak smell up front. The wood brings put smells reminiscent of bourbon while bring out notes of vanilla, caramel, chocolate, cherries and dark fruit. This is a well hopped beer so you get herbal, fruity and floral notes of hops.  Taste: You get a rustic oak taste in the fore and after taste. It really brings this beer together releasing notes similar to the smell. You get, chocolate notes, roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, dark fruit and floral esters. The coarse hops almost seem more evident in this beer after being put against the oak. It seems like such a simple thing to do but oaking this beer really makes it much more complex.  Mouthfeel: This actually has some alcoholic warmth even though the ABV isnt that high. Maybe the oak? Has a slightly heavier body then the non-oaked version. But still a rather light body, with sweetness that is cut by hoppy bitterness. A fantastically complex mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Both the oak and non-oaked versions are fantastic. However the addition of oak seems to bring this beer together releasing more flavors and making this beer more complexed. They are two beers to be respected but respect the original more and dabble in the oak from time to time. I'm afraid to say I enjoy the oaked more. I'm scared of the arrogant bastard beating me up now.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,AndyAvalanche,4.2,"Had this one on tap at the Sunset Grill in Allston MA. I tried it in the bottle about a year or so agoa and really liked it, but decided to review it this time. Quite a nice looking beer. When it was brought to me I almost thought it was a porter with how dark it looked. I had to hold it up to the light and I could see that it was a very very deep red/brown color on the edges with a slight haze to it, the middle was still very dark. It had a off white colored head to it, almost a caramel or butterscotch color that goes away and lingers for about half way through. Slight lacing on the glass. The smell is good citrus and pine hops, not quite as strong as I remember it in the past. Taste was good too. Similar to to the taste, same hops, followed by a slight smokey taste to it. Again, not as strong as I remember it. Mouthfeel was good, surprisingly smooth for an American Strong Ale. Also it was pretty drinkable. A pretty universal beer, could drink it year round, could be nice in warm or cold weather.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,pavandal,4.37,"This brew poured a nice deep iced tea color. The head was very creamy and thick, with a wonderful cream color.  The smell... oh my. This fella was simply awesome. It smelled a lot sweeter than the normal AB, with the oak scent peaking through at the tail end of the nose.  The taste was reminiscent of normal AB, but a heck of a lot smoother. The oaking of this brew really makes the hops take a back seat, and it brings the malt more to the front. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just makes it an interesting take on a classic!  All in all, this is a super smooth sipper that goes great after a long day of work (at least that's how I enjoyed it)!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,PerroGrande,4.03,"I couldn't resist picking this up and giving it a try.  Appearance is a gorgeous deep red/amber/brown with a rich, creamy looking head. The foam fades fairly quickly to a collar - maybe 1/4 to 1/2 inch in thickness. The head hangs around on your glass for a while, too.  Smell: I noticed oak in the aroma of the beer immediately. This, for me, is a bit unusual as I consider my sense of smell somewhat lacking. I picked up some caramel hints along with a traditional ale aroma. The aroma from this beer is quite unique, and is especially noticeable after the beer has breathed for a bit.  Taste: This is a very interesting and complex beer. It benefits well from an opportunity to breath, in my opinion. The effect of the oak process is certainly reflected in the taste -- for me, as the beer hits the back of my throat. The open is a nicely bittered ale, decently rich in hops with a hint of bitter citrus. The initial bitterness fades a bit, replace with some oak hints combined with malt, caramel, and a grapefruit sensation. There is a lingering hops taste, but some sips produced a long caramel/malt finish as well -- very interesting.  Mouthfeel: This beer has a bit of a ""bite"" to it, but as a strong ale, I would expect that. This bite isn't from aggressive carbonation (which I don't care for), but is from the power and complexity of this beer. Some people may not like the acidic feeling on the back of the throat (if they even experience it), but to me, it added to the overall experience.  Drinkability: I prefer to drink this beer slowly, allowing it to warm up a bit and to breathe. At 7.2% ABV, it might be a bit high for a session beer -- and some might find the powerful, complex character of this beer too much for a session. Nevertheless, it is an enjoyable drinking experience, and I rated it as such.  I would not recommend this as a first step for one moving away from BMCs, and perhaps not even as a second step. Just like DIPAs, it isn't going to be a beer that ushers in a gentle transition! Other selections might be recommended for that purpose. It is, however, clearly a world-class American Strong Ale, and excellently represents this style. For the experienced drinker of specialty/craft beers, this is a must-try.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Head lasts forever leaving a nice sticky lace on the glass. Poor clarity is the only negative here.  Aroma is sweet and somewhat bready with subtle but distinct oak character. Hops are minimal as more malty smells come forward with the oak.  Flavor is intense and immediately lets you know it's from the bastard family. It's the strength of flavors both from the large grain bill and multiple hop additions that make it known this is a big Stone beer. Then the complexity of vanilla and smoke from the oak chips comes through. It's a miracle that wood isn't lost in the other dominant flavors. A nice carmel sweetness up front gives way to big earthy hop flavor towards the middle. It finishes with a sticky dryness, some tannins, and residual oak flavors.  Mouthfeel is full of body, lowish carbonation, and sticky hop resin.  Double Bastard is one of my favorite Stone beers and this one is certainly up there too. There is a lot to appreciate in this wood aged beer. It definately makes me want to try more of the oaked varieties.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

A- Pours a copper color with reddish tints and a faint redness accompanies the impressive off-white three finger head. As the head dissipates, albeit nice and slowly, there is a quality lacing sticking to the sides of the glass.  S- This offers a similar balance of the bouquet of piney hops and roasty, toasty malt backbone as the original with a very faint hint of smoked wood. I like the unique twist to this one.  T- Hops up front, with a timely counter attack of malt to round it out. The oak/wood presence is definitely more prevalent in the flavor than it was in the nose. This one has more of a smoky finish than the original, and honestly, it's hard to say if that is better or worse. I guess it's just different. They are both pretty stinking tasty.  M- Medium bodied, slightly astringent with a puckering in the back. Not off-putting, just attention-getting.  D- Like the original AB, this is a very assertive beer with a ""Thank you sir, can I please have another?"" conundrum of palette punishment being overcome by the primal urge for another. Great beer, but the one area I found it to be inferior to the original is with it's drinkability.

Hops more subdued when compared to unoaked version. Nice caramel malt aroma.  Hop flavors come through while bitterness is subdued. Fantastic oak flavor adds complexity to an already great beer.  Smooth and creamy mouth feel. Carbonation is light bit adequate for this brew.  Wonderfully drinkable and very enjoyable.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,wl0307,4.47,"Purchased through online order from the Beers of Europe, a Britain-based beer shop; coming in a 12Fl. Oz. slim, brown bottle, served cool in Hapkin's tulip-shaped bowl sniffer.  A: pours an ultra-elegant dark ruby hue with fairly good clarity and restrained, fine carbonation, while the dark beige frothy head retains the body well and lasts throughout the drink. S: richly aromatic as the Arrogant Bastard (AB) Ale that I tried four days ago, bursting with perfumy, caramely, longan-fruity, ripe raisiny and creamy malts as well as juicy American hops, quite like a well-hopped barley wine, this. Oakiness... is mild, but a swirl seems to wake up a mildly sweet edge of sweet woodiness as of coconut-ish and vanilla scent of new American white oak barrels, but not assertive. The theme is still dominated by the complex AB beer base, and pleasantly so. T: the flavour is bitter-sweet from the beginning, with lots of tea-ish tannins, grapefruity flavour, toasted apples, and longan-fruits, along with a deep-running hop bitterness lingering in the aftertaste and causing a little bit of chewy palate. The oak influence, again, is in its most subtle in addition to the main AB theme, giving a lovely vanilla-ish edge properly expressed at the back of the palate. Interestingly, the overall performance is not as lively as AB, but still highly enjoyable and complex. M&D: very smooth on the carbonation, the body is full but not OTT, the flavour is complex and not overly oaked, and the alc., just like AB, is very well hidden. A balanced act overall, as complex as it is highly quaffable. Highly recommended!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,tyanow,4.37,"This is mostly cut and pasted from my review of the non oaked variety. Some additions have been made.  A - Dark amber with small tan head.  S - sweet alcohol, a little earthy.  T - very malty, some hop bitterness, a touch of burnt caramel, and a very slight hint of fruitiness. Seems earthier than the non-oaked but not woodier - if that makes sense.  M - fills the palate and stimulates all parts of the mouth. Goes down smooth and warm (7.2%)  D - For a 7+% beer this is about as drinkable as it gets. This beer, despite its name, is quite approachable.  I give this a slight nod over its garden variety brother, but you can't miss with either one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

A- A nice dark amber color with little foam head and minimal lacing... might be old. Small foam rim around the neck. (Note: Warmer temperature improves charactor of beer, alittle.)  S- Strong smell of malts and piney hops. Mild and faint scent of oak follows.  T-M- Nice hop bite with medium malts and oak finish makes this one a tad different than the regular Arrogant Bastard.

147,8951,DeathbySexyBT,4.7,"Stone managed to improve upon an already amazing beer in Arrogant Bastard by aging it in oak barrels. This gave the beer yet another level of complexity. The earthy tones in the aging complement the existing brilliance in Arrogant Bastard Ale without overriding any of the flavor in the non-oaked version.

147,8951,sensorglitch,3.68,"I had this poured from a bottle. The color was nice, had a good odor to it, it didn't have the same smell as the arrogant bastard regular, iI could detect a difference in the two beers for sure. The taste had a little bit more of a depth, and a bite to it than the non oaked arrogant bastard and you could taste the wood working with the beer to change the flavor and depth. However, the flavour difference wasn't really enough to justify the price difference in my opinion. I personally prefer to regular arrogant bastard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

The flavor is a bit hot when fresh but nothing like a straight up bastard.

Oh boy, this is one aromatic brew. Malty caramel sweetness, vanilla, slight oak undertones. Smells a bit like prunes or another dark ripe fruit. All with a little hop kick.  T. More fruitiness, some ripe fruit along with some citrus from the hops. Nice balance of the Ok flavor - very mild, but definately there. Not as sweet as I was expecting from the smell. A bit of spicyness. Really good Ale  M. Thick creamy mouthfeel -leaves a resiny coating in the mouth after each sip from the major doses of hops.  D.

Smell - The first smell that hits my nose is that of sweet oak. There is also a chocolate and toffee smell interlaced but not overpowering.  Taste - You can definitely taste the hops (grassy/pine) and the oak. I really enjoy the taste of this Stone product. I feel the hop and oak offset each other nicely and neither overpowers the other.  Mouthfeel - Not as thick as I would have thought, though it does have a nice feel.  Drinkability - Surprisingly smooth and drinkable for it being a higher abv than normal beers. As stated, this is quickly becoming my favorite Stone that I have tried (though I am yet to try double bastard ale...).

There is also some grassiness/floral flavors, but that could just be an aspect of the oakiness. There is a hint of caramel sweetness in the finish.

The mouthfeel, my favorite part, makes this beer truly extraordinary: thick, almost creamy.

The smell is toffee, chocolate and sweet oaky characteristics first, but there's an earthy hop in there as well.  The taste is the complete opposite of the smell. The grassy, piney hops come to the front of the taste and the chocolate and toffee tones move to the back of the line. Both flavors are present and incredibly well balanced. I don't taste much oak though.  The beer is pretty heavy and thick, and I do feel the booze in the stomach as I drink, but not as much as I would expect.

A hint of oak, but nothing too strong--gets stronger as it warms.  T- A little oak, but mostly the familiar hoppy, molasses-y taste of Arrogant Bastard. I guess that's appropriate, since this is AB, just oak aged. Tasty, a subtle variation on an already very good beer.

Review #2 - scores based of this review - first 06/08/09 this 03/21/11 - I know round 2 the sample is very fresh.  Poured a slightly dirty brown with a light yet lingering off white head.

The flavor is very hop dominated with big resiny orange peel coating your tongue with a long lasting bitterness, slowly the malt makes its way to the forefront with a very subtle hint of oak.

How on earth do they think that they are going to improve on something that is as good as the original Arrogant Bastard?  No freshness date on this 12 oz. bottle...poured into my SN pint glass.  A towering massive four to five finger head of off-white foam foam and cream, sticky as can be, with gorgeous lacing.

You can taste the oak in here, as it's the dominant flavor. There is some grapefruit in the foreground with a noticeable hop bitterness in the finish. No pine, but that could mean it's fresh.  Ultra creamy and smooth mouthfeel with only the slightest bit of an alcohol bit near the end.  The alcohol seems to hide a lot better here than the regular AB. But it's still the Arrogant Bastard...and it's still going to kick your ass!  Other than the noticeable oak flavor, can you really tell the difference?

147,8951,drums4matt,4.17,"Picked up a six-pack from Peace Street - those dudes always come through on the good stuff! I poured this one into a little de 'Proef tulip. I'm really beginning to appreciate this glass for the way it handles complex volatile aromas like those present in Oaked Arrogant Bastard.  This is really nice looking brew. It's dirty garnet colored with some ruby highlights to it. Not as actively carbonated as other Stone offerings I've experienced but this guy does hold a nice looking, dense and creamy two-finger head that's somewhere between those off-white hues and a more creamy/cappuccino color. Head holds nice and tight but dissipates after a sip or two leaving significant layers of lacing.  Interesting aroma - that much is for certain. Smells...oddly sweet. Sweet and boozy right off the bat. There are some other factors at work here lending much complexity: The malt biscuityness and a touch of sweet vanilla blend alongside the spicy hop quality and similarly-spicy-yet-fruity alcohol notes. Further agitation stirs up the grassy quality from the hops but not a crazy hop bomb, in fact, to my surprise.  Yes, this is an entirely different beer than its un-oaked counterpart. The hop quality is still immediately present but just not knock-down drag-out hops-in-your-face hoppy. There is certainly an amount of tempering of the overall flavor by oak addition. The detectable sweetness in aroma carries over to the flavor as well - I guess I'd expect a little sweetness from a beer of this weight called a ""Strong Ale"" and it is certainly not deleterious. The sweet is balanced by the spice notes coming from any number of sources here. I suppose I'm inclined to believe there is oak at work as I've tasted this beer un-oaked and it doesn't carry the tempered spicyness but rather allows the hop presence through with great fortitude. Some balance from muted malt flavors comes into play as the beer warms a bit; all gives way to a palate-coatingly sweet, grassy-hop flavor.  Mouthfeel is a little undercarbonated for such a full-bodied beer. There is a definite sensation of dryness and palpable alcohol on the palate. Overall drinkability is somewhat affected by the warming of this beer as the dryness can REALLY take hold at higher-than-fridge temperatures.  Overall, a good offering - no doubt about it. This is a beer created to be savored by and entice the palates of beer advocates and at $16.99 (!!!) a sixer only real beer nerds will go for it, anyway. Outside of such a context this beer almost doesn't make sense.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Smell hints that there is a lot going on: but where it delivers is in the tasting. Very clean malt, very sharp and spicy hop (but not overdone), and a hint of woody oak. Finishes with a final kick of hoppy bite.  Is there too much going on with this beer? Seriously, there might just be.

Get some nice chewy fruit smells in there too - like cherry. Taste: Wow that's hoppy. Very good bitterness. Kind of smoky, too; probably from the oak chips. The bitterness really sticks around after I'm done. However there's a scunge of sweetness partnered with the bitterness that makes for a really good flavor. Mouthfeel: It feels pretty light; not too thick. Big carbonation that I would expect with this ale. Drinkability: Pretty good; not great. It tastes great throughout - it doesn't get flat or swilly at the end. It tastes like the 7.2% it is and the strong hop bite makes me inclined to enjoy one - okay two - before moving onto another. Overall: Powerful IPA that slaps you in the face. I love the flavor and smokiness of this one. It's major drawback: the price. I paid over $16 for a six-pack.

147,8951,jdklks,4.3,"A- Dark amber/brown with a small, bubbly tan-yellow head that dissipates rather quickly, leaving minimal lacing.  S- An oak roastiness surrounded by hops and mixed fruit sweetness.  T- Surprise! it tastes like an oaked version of arrogan bastard. it is overly hopped and overly malted, yet somehow the doubled intensity leads to a smoothness that is hard to describe because it is at the same time almost shocking. This beer can blow you away. The after taste comes on with a subtle fruitiness that is characteristic of arrogant bastard (almost an apricot flavor).  M- Good. smooth. slightly over-carbonated. Thick and rich.  D- Despite the ABV I could drink it or either of its brothers all night.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,PatrickJR,3.65,"Re-review. Original posted below.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into nonic pint glass.  A - Clear garnet red with a touch of cherry wood. 2-3 fingers of off white head; great retention with a persistent cap. Mild to moderate lacing.  S - Some pineapple in the nose with big aromas of apples and apricots. Piney/fruit hops with a slight citric edge. Sweet malt in the background heavy on the vanilla with subtle notes of brown sugar. Just a hair of wood on the back end.  T - Mild fruity flavors leaning towards apricot with vague suggestions of pineapple, pine, and citrus from the nose. Piney flavor grows and prevails into mid palate. Fleeting semi-sweet malt kicks in before diving into a pith-like bitterness and notes of salted grapefruit juice. Moderate to high bitterness. Though I'm looking for the oak, I can't seem to find it.  M - Medium body leaning towards full with a moderate to low carbonation. What once seemed smooth comes of as slightly unsubstantial.  D - All in all Oaked AB is a pretty good beer. However, I really can't find any oak and in a lot of ways it feels like a less carbonated Arrogant Bastard with a very diminished hop presence. Stone tried to make a great beer better, but in this case something from the original is lost, and nothing amazing is added for the new.  ---  Review from 09.26.08  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into nonic pint glass.  A - 4.0 - Beautiful clear reddish brown. Two fingers of light brown head form with moderate retention. Nice, thin lacing.  S - 4.0 - Extremely fruity. Pineapple comes to mind immediately, with piney/herbal notes. The malt is somewhere in there but the huge pineapple aroma dominates.  T - 4.0 - More pineapple. Huge pineapple taste, which I think is coming from some hop combination. Mild citrus notes mingle along with some vague floral/herbal tastes. A little grassy. The brew dries out a little bit leading into some roasted malt. The wood is slight but noticable before a moderately bitter finish.  M - 4.5 - Moderate carbonation with a nice medium body. Smooth stuff.  D - 3.5 - I've knocked this down half a point since I started, because that fruity pineapple taste is becoming a bit much for me. A great beer, but I think one is enough. Quite different than anything I've tasted.  Overall: B+, 4",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,blackearth,4.12,"Purchased from Rays Liquors in Wauwatosa, WI. Pours a dark amber color with a thin off-white head. Aroma balanced between hops and malt, and oak is detectable.

Lacing from start to finish.... Beautiful thing !!  S: Lots of hops, with a woody smokey smell mixed in some sweet caramel notes... and some toffee.  T: First thing to hit me is the hops.... with a little bitterness, then the Oaked flavor really comes on.. even has a little smokey flavor mixed into that. But the big thing is the hops they are very strong, and just as bitter as Arrogant Bastard. The bitter hops is balanced with a hint of sweet caramel... very light... Aftertaste is on the bitter side... I'll have to try another Arrogant Bastard and see if it is this bitter..  M: Feels pretty med body.... not to carbonated. Very smooth. It left my mouth a little on the dry side.  D: Very drinkable if you love some hops... Not a session beer, the ABV is up there and the overall feel is very filling.

Flavors are pleasant-full rich malt with nice balance of bitter hops. Flavors finish hop heavy and then is long lasting. Not a lot of oak in the mouth, if any, a bit of a disappointment that.

Finishes slightly bitter, woody, and with a residual malty roundness.  M: Full bodied, but not heavy. Medium carbonation. Slight astringency/dryness on the end.  D: A great, complex beer. I'm trying to recall this beer against the non-oaked version and I don't think either one is better than the other - just different. This one has more earthy flavors, but a deeper complexity. A mighty impressive beer and one which showcases the potential benefits of oak aging. Not all beers are capable of handling the oak and not all beers that are oaked are oaked properly, but this is certainly not one of those beers.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,sgoodship,4.37,"Poured from a 12oz bottle. This brew comes to me thanks to the amazing kindness of Hophead101. Many thanks Greg!  A: Delivered a lovely creamy yellowy cream finger and a half head. Color is a hazy mysterious dark copper color with lighter golden color showing through towards the edges. Good head retention and nice fine lacing.  S: Great malty smell with a slight whiff of booze. Upon further investigation, the caramel is a sweeter than usual almost butter-scotch smell.  T: Man! Quite a surprise. It's a lovely malty butter scotch with a hint of booze. It really didn't seem like the taste could match the smell but it does. Grassy and fruity hop bitterness at the end to finish it in a nice dryness. Malt is definitely the winner in this battle. The further the drink progressed, the more I tasted the burned, oaky type barrel flavors. Feels much bigger than 7.2 ABV. Really bold and complex.  M: Smooth and creamy. On the full side of medium body. Low carbonation that is gentle on the palate but just enough to liven it up.  D: I loved this beer.

Has a limpid off-white head that quickly recedes to a light film and the collar of death around the drink. A few drabs of lacing but nothing spectacular.  S: Piney, resiny hops, toasted malt, caramel, and toffee, with oak and some vanilla overtones.  T: Toasted and caramel malt, with a lesser pine hop character on the initial taste. It becomes bitter very quickly as the hops take over, and the oak contributes an additional bittering character that I'm not too fond of. By the finish it lessens slightly due to a combination of vanilla and toffee, but the aftertaste is again very dry and bitter. Just not my bag.  M: Medium bodied. Carbonation is slightly high and pricks the tongue a bit.  D: Not a huge fan of this one (and, to be honest, the original form).

147,8951,DannyS,3.83,"Served in a tulip glass, poured from a 12 oz. bottle. The Arrogant Bastard's got wood, which is both intriguing and highly inappropriate.  A - Very dark ruby red amber with a medium sized thick head that dissipates fairly quickly. Leaves decent lacing.  S - A lot of the characteristics I noticed in the regular bastard, just with oak notes piled on top. Candied sweet malt and floral hops abound.  T - The oak seems to add a bit of extra bitterness, which I did not enjoy. The flavors also taste a bit more subdued this time around. Tastes hoppier than it's non-oaked counterpart. Bitter aftertaste lingers forever and refuses to back down. Gives off an almost tart oak flavor as it warms up, which makes it more bearable.  M - Velvety smooth with decent carbonation.  D - The ABV is hidden very well but hits quick. That and the offensively tenacious aftertaste bring it down a peg.  Overall - I definitely prefer the original over this weird wooden brew. Arrogant Bastard is just fine without oak chips, and I'm not totally enjoying the addition.

The hops consist of pine needles, grapefruit peels, grassy herbal notes, and a pop of spices with mint. Otherwise, the other dominant flavors are the sugary caramel crusted malts that provide ample backbone, more than enough I might add. Then, this amalgamation of flavors is infused with that drifting smoked oak character. The smokiness is kept in balance and some what subtle making a nice compliment overall (reminiscent of oaked bourbon flavors). Tasty!  M: creamy and turns into a dream as it warms.

147,8951,JonMich13,4.5,"A = Dark brown/amber with a 1"" head. Decent lacing throughout.  S = Wonderful complexity of smells. Something with this much going on is hard to pick out specifics. Maybe vanilla, dark fruits, citrus hops, brown sugar, caramel. Translation = a nasal assault.  T = I agree with an recent review in that not much separates the original from this. And this is a good thing. I think maybe the oak aging has melded the flavors together a little more smoothly than the original. Maybe it's a little less arrogant and more possesses more of a quiet confidence, knowing that it is great but not needing to be arrogant about it. Delicious malty caramel and vanilla, smoothly transitioning into a citrusy hop bite, but the dark sugary and syrupy sweetness never recedes despite the hops. Complex is an understatement.  M = Full bodied but not overly so. Carbonation is there but only to enhance the flavors. Just right. Finishes a hint dry.  D = Again, if drinkability means you crave another sip or another bottle, well then it's ultimately drinkable. If it means making a session of 4 or 5, this isn't your beer. I prefer the former.

The caramel and vanilla dominate the flavor and there's a nice spicey hop balance to go along with it. The berry that I picked up in the smell is present, but only slightly.  The mouthfeel is full bodied with a slightly bitter finish. The alcohol is slightly detectable.  This is one of those beers that I had a hard time putting down because of all the interesting tastes.

This looks rich and foamy, arrogance possibly? The head holds fast for a while, and as it disappears, it leaves a ton of lacing. ""Don't forget me."" The beer pours a dark red that's almost opaque, but it lets light through in all the right places as if screaming, ""Look at me. I'm a beer to behold. Drink and be merry!""  Smell: Berry and citrus flavors hit the nose on the first whiff. I wasn't expecting the fruitiness. Definitely some hops on the front end. God I can't wait to sample this beer.  Taste: Wow. Heaven, perhaps? It doesn't taste like arrogance to me. In fact, I'm not sure what the taste is exactly. The aftertaste yields a mountain of oaken and wooden flavors. There are definitely some hints of coffee, caramel, toffee, vanilla, and, dare I say, hops. The maltiness and the hops push me back and forth. Giminee, what a beer!  Mouthfeel: This might be the one part of this beer that doesn't thrill me. It's an American Strong Ale, but the mouthfeel is almost too heavy. The deepness of the malts and the stinging-ness of the hops create a surreal effect in my mouth that I'm not sure I'm crazy about.  Drinkability: This is a yummy, delicious beer; complex, yet unbearably simple. The oaken flavors are there, but they're not overwhelming. However, nothing about this beer is underwhelming. The heavy mouthfeel goes along with the arrogance of this beer. Stone warns you that ""you probably won't like it."" I believe I do like it.

Finish is bitter, but not overwhelmingly so.  M: Full-bodied with carbonation that explodes in the mouth.  D: I remember this being a lot better when I had it in the past. Before, I would have said that this is definitely better than regular AB. Now, I'm not so sure. Maybe I got an old bottle. Regardless, this is quite outstanding. If it were a bit bigger, it would be an ideal digestif.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,benclimbs,4.42,"Pours a dark red amber with a prominent head.  Smell is beautiful bourbon like vanilla notes with a little malt and spice.  Taste is initially the oak, then malts and finishing off with just enough dry hop kick. The aftertaste stays around for a while too.  Hands down,this beer kicks ass! this is perhaps stones best beer. This is the third time I've had it and still blown away...why this only has an A- is strange, trust the bros review!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,BeerManDan,3.88,"When poured, the color was a medium dark amber brown with a tan head and a mild amount of lace on the side of the glass. The smell was of soft sweet mild hops and a hint of spice in the aroma. The flavor had a mildly bitter hoppy fell, with a hint of spice and a touch of oak! The bitter finish was not over powering. Nicely balanced ale.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,bluetravlr,4.12,"A: Dark brown with an orange/red hue. One finger of head that dissipates in a few minutes. Still, after 15 minutes a slight head remains. In fact, this head remains through the very last sip. Impressive! Sufficient streaking down the glass.  S: Not much in the way of smell. A hint of oak and maybe maple?  T: When it first hits the tongue the taste is slightly sweet, hinting of citrus, but is quickly taken over by the bitterness of the hops. There is a hint of caramel and malt that goes along with this initial bitterness and this then gives way to a more intense bitterness with a long lingering taste of oak. Hop heads will enjoy the complexity of this succession of bitterness. However, as this beer warms and your palate becomes used to the lingering oak bitterness the sweetness of the caramel notes becomes more distinct and even begins to override the initial bitterness.  M: Surprisingly full bodied for an ale, but slightly over carbonated for the complexity of flavor.  D: As long as you keep sipping that bitterness is held slightly at bay due to the initial sweetness. That being said the IBUs must be off the charts. This beer is also 7.2%ABV and fairly full bodied. Definitely a sipping beer. Yet, as stated above the palate becomes adjusted to the bitterness, and a second beer may go down faster.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,LauraAlberts,4.6,"I had this at a Stone beer dinner tonight at the Old Village Post House in Mt. Pleasant, SC. The Southeast Stone brewery Rep, Scott Sheridan attended and added a truly charismatic humor and laid back familiarity to the experience. Stories/facts and knowledge poured throughout the evening making it an amazing craft beer experience. The chef paired this beer with Mepkin Abbey Mushroom Bread Stuffing, Garlic-Dill Fingerling Potatoes, Roasted Spring Onions, Raspberry Gastrique. Needless to say, the food was over the top and the meal was shared in good company. I highly recommend attending any kind of Stone event.  Appearance: Cloudy/Dark Amber/ruby  Smell: Cold wheat/fruit Vanilla  Taste: Creaminess that cuts through the hoppy character of the beer - the oak aging adds this aspect. Vanilla.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied - amazing American Strong Ale.  Drinkability: Session if you can - but a sipper for me. Sip & Savor on the beach after a hot day in the sun. A beer to look forward to drinking.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,youngblood,4.79,"Poured a slightly dirty amber. Off white head fights stay around before finally resigning itself to a half finger layer. As the beer gets sloshed around, the head leaves suds rather than lace. Smells very complex. Getting bits of nut, caramel, toffee, citrus, pine, biscuit. Really the scents just go on and on. Rather incredible. The first flavors that I got were some grapefruit mixed with honey, evolves into malty sweetness and finishes dry and nutty. The oak just adds this amazing wood-chip flavor on the way out. The flavor matches the scent quite nicely. This feels very creamy on the tongue, very nice. The balanced ABV makes this easy to put down, but still so full of complexity.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,AtlasBrew,4.66,"Served from a 12 oz. brown bottle into an Arrogant Bastard pint glass I got for Christmas. 7.2% alcohol.  Color: Red, i've never seen color like this before. It's amazing. Cream colored pillowy lacy head, with good retention.  Aroma: mild hop aroma, mild malt aroma, perfectly balanced all at once, but on top of those mild aromas, there's definitely an oak quality and a touch of smokiness, almost like burnt wood.  Flavor: Sweet caramelly malt, burnt sugars with a heavy mouth feel followed by a complex string of hop flavors which is spicy but not floral nor fruity. Bitterness meets you halfway in the middle, and sort of stays with you at one strong level until it finally fades into a dry finish.  Overall: Wow. This is incredibly complex and quite aggressively hopped. The bottle says I'm not worthy, and it may be right. I'm very surprised that when i poured this beer and smelled it for the first time that I wasn't knocked off my chair onto my own bastard ass with the smell of hops and malt. What I expected was an over-the-top ale that was going to blow my mind with intense maltiness and off-the-chart hops flavor, and I also expected it to be almost chewy like oatmeal. What I got was an incredible surprise because it is a very aggressive beer, but it is so well balanced that you hardly notice the aggressiveness. The balance between the hops and the bitterness is incredible with the added burnt oak flavor. The hop bitterness and flavor does a great job at hiding the high alcohol content. So in the end, it won't be the flavor or aroma that knock my own arrogant ass off the chair, but the sneaky 7.2% alcohol instead.  Rating: I'm giving this one five out of five coals, BUT...it's not because i think it's the best tasting beer i've ever had, but because it's so well crafted. I almost expect a gargoyle to fly out of the bottle and punch me in the face. It's almost a magical beer with it's incredible balance. The bastard who came up with this brew deserves to be arrogant.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Andreji,4.03,"Whoa. oaked indeed.  i was thrilled to finally get to this beer, something i've only heard of distantly through this website. pouring it with a bit of strength certainly pulled a decent beer with a deep brown tone only slightly translucid, but not fully opaque either. it's interesting, maybe even mystical somehow. definetly a aspect, with a thick head that resolved fairly quickly but kept a marked lacing all over the place.  smell is roastey, but very subtle and dominated by the hops for the most part.  taste and mouthfeel are quite nice. what is these, buttery? cheesey somehow, it is very marked as a mouthfeel and has a woody (oakey of course) bitter feel to it throughout, because it is not very sweet anyway.  this is a very nice beer, not usually my style but just adds much to this discovery of so many new flavours from america. i'll tick off the OAB, but if i come across it again i will buy it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Patrick999,4.11,"A - Great looking beer in my Stone imperial pint. Orange-red body, big persistent crown, impressive lacing.  S - Plenty of citric hop aroma, but softened somewhat by a tapioca-pudding sweetness that has to be the oak chips.  T - This is the same massively-hopped Arrogant Bastard. Edging into DIPA territory, your palate will be assaulted by huge citric/piney bitterness that lingers. The only difference I can determine is that there seems to be a little more perceived sweetness backing up the hops, along with a pleasant dry cedar character. Not an oak-chip bomb, I think this one does not go overboard with the wood. A little alcohol steps up and makes itself known from time to time.  F - Very smooth, almost what I would consider to be creamy.  Verdict - it is an ebullient American-hop bomb, though a little more smooth and refined than its original namesake. Like several Stone beers, it will be a palate-wrecker...not one to start up with. I like it better than regular Arrogant Bastard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,nicholasdes,3.85,"The beer pours a dark copper color with a light cream 1 finger head, a little lacing. The first thing that hits you is the sweet caramelized sugar smell with earthy hints of the oak. The beer tastes almost exactly as it smells, caramel and oak with the addition of some bitterness. Even though it is bitter there is not a lot of hop flavor. The sweet alcohol flavor is strong, something I really never love in a beer. It goes down smooth and seems to be only lightly carbonated. The oak flavor is great and will keep me coming back but the strong alcohol flavor will keep me from having a session with this beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Martin2D,4.23,"A - Dark amber with a large off white hea d that faded away with lacing  S - Smokey oak  T - There's a definite oaky flavor to this, almost like a minimally smoked beer. The hops have faded as this bottle is quite aged, like a nice aged barleywine. Not as malty as one though.  M - Medium-high in carbonation with a medium mouthfeel.  D - Pretty drinkable for the style, a sipper, but still delicious and drinkworthy.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,hophead247,4.32,"Poured from a 12ounce bottle into a pint glass..Pours dark amber with smallish off white head. Aroma comes in a little woody (go figure) but with other earthiness as well due to the hop profile... something that is large in regular bastard as well. I'm not breaking it down any further than that, this beer smells awesome. Like an old baseball glove. Body is light to medium. Flavor is fairly bitter with that sprucy resinous biterness tempered by a heavy maltiness. Ever lingering within the normal hoppiness rides the flavor of the oak, which changes this beer considerably. A must try for all the oak lovers out there",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,joshuadlight,4.3,"This beer certainly has its strong suits, but overall is a very, very solid brew. Poured into a pint glass, the beer is murky dark red with only a quickly fleeting head. The lack of head adds to the lack of power in the nose. Only with deep strong sniffs can you pick up the nice aromas available. The oak is stronger in the nose then in the taste. There is plenty of wood, along with hints of alcohol and the primary warnings of the coming bitterness. The taste is outstanding in the fact that you can really pick out many different flavors. Sweet malts only last a second but they're there. Then alcoholic piney hops upon hops bombard your throat after you swallow. Get ready for some dryness. Big oak backs all the flavors but never takes over. It really compliments it all the way around. Smooth smooth smooth in moutfeel department. Too much dryness for it to be super drinkable, but you could have a couple.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,BigMike,4.63,Poured from a 12oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. A pretty deep ruby red color with 2 fingers of creamy head.  The nose is malty and caramel with a little hint of vanilla.  WOW! This is an awesome change of pace from the regular Bastard. The oak is definitely present. I'm getting an almost butterscotch flavor with a touch of vanilla extracts. Nice caramel undertones with a slightly bitter smooth finish.  This is a perfectly balanced beer in my opinion. And nice colaberation of flavors. The slightly sweet butterscotch and the slight hop bitterness make this one super drinkable.  Definitely smoother then the regular but still a beast in it's own right.  Two thumbs up from me!!,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,bonkers,4,"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a deep orange with a moderate head. This bastard has an oaky aroma with faint wiffs of alcohol.

IMO I prefer reguall arrogant bastard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

A nice backing of caramel malt. Pretty alcoholic.  T: Oaked flavor really comes through, even tastes a little smokey. Hops are very strong, and just as bitter as in original Arrogant Bastard. Fruit flavors come through in the secondary taste. Very well-balanced, and tastes great.  M: Very carbonated, but not over-carbonated. Pretty non-astringent. Medium-bodied, very smooth.

147,8951,Offa,3.08,"I love regular Arrogant Bastard so had high hopes but was disappointed. After tasting this, I compared the two closely.  Compared to the regular, this looks similar with about the same colour it's more murky & less bubbly. The head is the same but bigger and lasts much longer.  The aroma is similar, but with dusty-woody element.  It has a fuller body and richer more oily mouthfeel, with more caramel and body in the aroma and flavour. However, the malt is more subdued and the hops become less flowery and flavourful but significantly more bitter and astringent. it actually has less overall flavour but more bitterness and more prominent alcohol.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Some delicious sweetness, and a nice bitter citrus at the end. Extremely smooth. Tastes like nothing I've had before.  MF: Rather silky, and more viscous than I expected.  Drinkability: I really really like this. Unfortunatley I can't comment on the difference between the Oaked AB vs. regular AB, because I've only had the oaked.

147,8951,marvin213,3.31,"It's really brown. Browner, certainly, than your regular ale, but far from the reddish tone I might expect from an oaky beer. The head swelled nicely as I poured this into my Flying Dog pint glass, and a full layering remained as the beverage sat, waiting on my approach. All in all, it's a darker brown (not bronze) than I expected, and that disappoints me slightly. +0.5, however, for the Stone gargoyle.  I definitely smell the oak, but not as much as I had hoped. I don't know why, but this beer I have here is not very aromatic. The taste, I'm sorry to report, is also lacking. I taste an okay ale with a little oak chip flavor. It's okay, but it's not worth the hype and $17 price tag (sixer) it fetches around these parts. With no way to avoid seeing the high ""A"" rating this beer has before I produce my own review, I'm particularly disappointed that I don't regard this beverage more highly. With Greensboro's own Red Oak as my standard for a good oak beer, I must report that this beer is inferior to that and MAYBE slightly better than average. The gargoyle, however, won't save the rating this time.  The mouthfeel is purty good. Like I've communicated this far, I don't think this beer has a lot of character. Though I yearn for more flavor as I feel the beer, I can say that I enjoy the feel. Still, I'm determined to write an independent review. Mouthfeel is just better than average. The beer's okay, but I won't follow the first with a consecutive second. Stone is good and oak is good, but this beer is average.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,alovesupreme,3.9,"Poured into a Maudite Snifter this beer yielded an off white head over a semi clear dark ruby body. The lazing is great, it is obviously a hoppy beer. Lots of esters coming through with this beer. Cherry is the most obvious of the fruit aromas. Wood and alcohol are also prominent. A bubbly mouthfeel with a hoppy syrupy body that make up the mouthfeel. A slightly bitting hop presence is felt but balanced slightly by the oak. Alcohol has a presence as well with a dominating cherry character.

Caramel, malt (tons of it). The hops is not standing out, still citrussy though.  Mouthfeel is great, I'd say even better then the original ricipe. Still an ""aggressive"" beer, but the oak tends to melloew the rough edges of the original arrogant bastard ale. It is surprisingly ""smooth"" even a bit creamy to me, and definetly feels more balanced then her sister.

It's light tan, super thick and ultra creamy with excellent retention. Super sticky foam finally sinks to a chunky halo and leaves huge webs of lace in doing so.  A: Surprisingly, it's still pretty hoppy. Citrusy, piney, and an almost herbal-like scent to them. Also, I get a toasted bread-like malt, a nice oaky/woody aroma, and a little alcohol.  T: Malty sweet for the first split-second, then the bitterness hijacks the controls. Big, oily, resinous hops are quite citrusy like brown sugar-crusted grapefruit rinds, oranges, and lemons with some pine sap drizzled over the top. Bready malt forms a very sturdy base underneath, while the caramel and oak notes add some nice depth and complexity. Nice hop bite that brings some spice to the dry finish. Outstanding!  M & D: Full-bodied, thick & chewy, and incredibly smooth. Drinkability is fantastic, I just can't get enough!  Notes: Oak-aged AB is even better than the original!

Grapefruit and lemon aromas carry through to the flavor. Malt comes on with a thick layer of molasses and burnt oak. Sweet/bitter balance seems better than in the non-oaked version. Finishes tart and dry.  M: The silky smooth medium body feels great in the mouth.  D: I really liked this. It grew on me as I drank it. Not a beer to hurry through. Doing that would cut short the complexities that emerge over the whole experience. The oak adds an extra complexity and smoothness to the mix that I really liked.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

I was a little shy but this encouraged me to get to it, I wanted to show I am ""worthy""  It pours a great off white head that goes above the glass and reduces to an attractive cover. The color is dark red with a nice ruby on the sides.  I cant find much in the smell but a hint of woodiness.  The taste is great with hints citrousy hops and a cleaner finish through the oak.  Mouthfeel is full and heavy and leaves me curious on every sip to find every bit.

147,8951,biboergosum,4.35,"I grabbed a 12oz bottle of this for my ""let's see if this is the time my suitcase gives up the ghost because of beer"" return from Austin, Texas a few months ago. As I'm attending a whisky appreciation event this evening, what better way (with beer, anyway) to start things off, eh?  This beer pours a clear, dark red-brick copper hue, with a few fingers of thick, puffy off-white head, which settles into a stubborn cap for a while, before lazily receding, and leaving a few remnants of webbed lacing around the glass.  The aroma - man, I can smell it sitting on the table across from me - is dark roasted caramel malt, black orchard fruit, all underlain by an acrid oaken woodiness. The taste is big 'n brash caramel malt, wrapped in the flavours of slightly charred oak - vanilla, caramelized sugars, and edgy rye booze - with an herbal earthiness, and some citrus grapefruit and pine hops coming crashing down over all of this joint, yet not quite balancing things, but at least making certain that all promised participants are present and accounted for.  The body is nice and heavy, sumptuous, with a mildly prickly and frothy carbonation trickling throughout the morass that is the smoothness quotient here. It finishes relatively light, only a slight malt stickiness and lovely mild citrus hoppiness lingering.  From what I can remember, I like the extra complexity of this beer versus the 'regular' (heh) offering, especially the additional (perceived) hoppy components. The oak doesn't change the nature of the base beer, as other products of its ilk seem to show - well, this is Arrogant Bastard we're talking about here, after all. In summary, this is a pretty decent example of said beer trend of late - would that I could have more than the one of this, just to make sure, right?",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Oak gives it a buttery, woody flavor, and slightly more complex and drying than the regular Bastard. Medium full body. Very tasty, nice and bitter, big beer without the overly high ABV.

T - initial taste is of hops, spicy and floral aspects hitting the tounge. there is a far 'deeper' aspect than the regular bastard that can be attributed to the oak chips. the finish has the hop burst that the regular bastard does and not much else beside some presence of sweet malts and dry alcohol. the aftertaste has a bit of vanilla and continues the alcohol presence.

Taste is a hop bitterness attack up front folowed by an oaky finish, with a slightly sweet maybe molasses like finish. Very dry finish.

The hops, mingled with an alcohol tinge, come through strong in the finish and complement the fruity characteristics very well. Tasty stuff. The mouthfeel of this bastard makes the beer for me--incredibly soft and smooth for strong ale, probably the result of the oaking.

147,8951,HoustonTX,4.57,"Oak Aged Arrogant Bastard pours out beautifully, dark amber body with stunning ruby highlights. Thick frothy head, with lots of sticky glass coating lacing. Looks great.  Aroma is definitely a lot more woody than it's regular form. Lots of oak, pine, maple, and cherry wood. Huge hop oil notes, herbaceous, resinous, and sweet florals. Along with a hefty backing of dark sticky malts. Very delicious smell overall, highly appealing and definitely gets the mouth watering.  Taste on this one is astounding. Much more complex then regular Bastard. The hops really stand out here. Loads of sappy pine bitterness, sweet tantalizing florals, and immense amounts of citrus. The oak does a wonderful job of integrating with all of the flavor notes, especially the rich malty notes. The balance is phenomenal. Finishes dry, with lingering wood notes.

Five minutes later, I've yet to take a sip but the head remains -- great retention.  Smell gives a hop spiciness, with a strong malty base behind it. Hints of alcohol in the scent almost stings the nose. Am I worthy? The bottle suggests I am not.  First sip hits hard initially... hard to tell if its the malt, hops, or alcohol. It all kinds of comes at once. It finishes surprisingly clean. Second sip, I realized how balanced the flavor is. Hard to isolate the parts I thought I identified in the smell, but I'm sure its all there. The maltiness really comes through on the back of the tongue, and I think the hops come through a spicy bitterness (not ""hot"" spicy, but they seem to be something other than just bitter -- for some reason, spicy is the only word I can come up with).  Nice full mouthfeel. Certainly nothing watery or light about it. Surprisingly drinkable given how intense the smell is, but don't know if I'd be having more than one or two in a night.  I don't have the regular Arrogant Bastard handy for comparison, but I believe if I had a choice between the two, I would choose the oaked version. Something about the finish seems more mellow.

147,8951,jimj21,4.55,"On the Night of the Barrels, I thought it appropriate to have something aged with wood. 12 ounce bottle poured into a Portsmouth Brewery tulip. Stone has great bottle art, and this is no exception. Pour leaves two fingers of light tan head, which fades to a small cap. There is a small amount of lacing. This beer is a dark amber color. Holding it to the light creates orange highlights around the edges. The smell is hops, sweet malt, and a bit of oak. Taste starts out very hoppy, followed by sweet caramel and some citrus. The finish is both hops and oak. A bit of wood and vanilla can be tasted throughout each sip. The oak character really helps to balance this beer, but there is still a lot of delicious, hoppy, bitterness. Mouthfeel is very creamy. Carbonation is perfect. The alcohol warms the throat a little as it goes down. Drinkability is pretty high. Nothing is too overpowering, as all ingredients work to balance the others.

I really can't even describe this in any other form than exceptional.  M - Could be a little fuller, but still very good.  D - This stuff is great, but I couldn't really see myself drinking more than one of these.  Wow, this an amazing beer. I'm really glad I picked this one up, and will be getting this one again.

147,8951,HalfFull,4.12,"Pours a clear reddish amber into a pint glass. Topped with a medium rich inch of tan head initially, shrinking by mid pint to a thin surface film and throwing off a fair amount of lacing all along.  Oak jumps out as I pour the glass. A fair amount of woody hops lie beneath the oak and mix well with a moderate malt structure, a bit of caramel. I would say that the oak enhances the smell of this brew vs. its standard version.  Taste and feel are a bit diminished on the other hand though still very nice. Pick up some moderate caramel malts initially with more earthy hops later on. Occasional blasts of oak. Finishes with a touch of bitterness then a lasting confluence of oak and hops and spice. Feel is a touch thinner than the standard version, or perhaps just different from a bottle, and it does firm up a bit with some warming. Good marks for drinkability, not too sweet or dry, well balanced given the flavors and ABV.

147,8951,PerzentRizen,3.79,"Stone always puts out some great brews and this one is no exception. I loved their regular Arrogant Bastard and the Double Bastard is a beast. I decided I had to try the Oaked Arrogant Bastard. At nearly sixteen bucks a sixer this stuff is damn expensive. Oh well it's only money right?  This one was poured into a Duvel glass. The color (dark woodsy brown), head (off white beautiful lacing), and clarity (or rather lack there of) are identical to the Arrogant Bastard.  The Aroma is extremely oaky but this is not found in the taste - as much. The oak lends a barrier to the hop smells and brings out the sacchrin sweet malt aromas that were previously muted.  The taste is playful and almost belgian-like sweetness is cut short by a massive hop and oak attack that finishes with a harsh but tasty hop bite.  Mouthfeel is a bit light for my taste of an American Strong Ale - which I would not classify this...really more of a double bock but nevertheless a great brew.  I think this is a very drinkable brew but at 7.2% I would not be looking for much more than two of these.

From the beautiful brown that bounces all around the glass to the mouth feel which is heavy enough to know you have something in there but not enough to suggest that you're having a meal. The ABV is in perfect balance with the brew's more earthy flavors. From the first sip to the last there is no wandering of flavor. This beer is in your mouth, to the point, and gone until the next sip. The after taste is pleasant and not a loiterer. You can smell this brew from a foot away though its ABV doesn't suggest how strong it actually was. All in all, I recommend this beer to anyone, and as a guy who cooks everything with beer; I must say that using this to cook would be insulting to its true purpose.

It's fairly dry with a nice, green aftertaste.  M - Full and substantial, but still goes down smooth.  D - This is an easy drinking beer with good balance.

(Or am I sick?) Taste is interesting. Quite the bitter hop kick. Not much in the way of anything else. Tinges of smokey flavors and sweet malts, but that underlying Arrogant Bastard is quite prevalent. I thought for such a high rating, there would be more complexity in its flavors, but not really the case.  I mean it's a Stone beer; you can't really go wrong.

Hated the taste. Way too much Pine/Oak  Mouthfeel wasn't bad at all, but after the first few sips, I just gulped it down.  Not drinkable at all in my opinion.

Taste: Despite the lack of hops in the smell, the first thing I got was a hoppy-bite, backed by alcohol, and supported by the oak. Faded to a honey-raisin sweetness, with a bitter finish. It's a sweet beer, but not cloyingly so.  Mouthfeel: Thin, but highly carbonated, which leads to a fairly crisp finish.  Drinkability: Solid beer. Tastes like there's more alcohol than the 7.2 ABV, which makes this a sipper. It's too sweet to have more than one. Not bad, but not a beer I'd have too often.

The appearance is scary. You have a really cloudy brown brew here pouring a furious three finger head. The sediment in my glass collected at the bottom, really nuts considering the Arrogant Bastard is transparent.  Really great smell. I let it warm just a bit to get full effect. The smell is sweet. Something fruity, I am leaning towards apricots. You can also smell a the hops, but it smells like the hops were dipped in caramel before they brewed this fine gem.  The taste is outstanding. Really something. You get the dry hop bitterness that Arrogant Bastard has, but an incredibly subtle dryness that comes toward the end. The brew really hops all of your palate, but I will say that it is almost smoother that its un-oaked brethren. I have to say also that Arrogant Bastard is by far my favorite year-around brew of all time, so the expectations were fairly high. This brew met my expectations.

After taking a sip I get that oak and hoppy taste I had smelt before followed by a fruity kick, maybe grapes or something sour. Also the oak wood chips help to leave a pretty good after taste.

147,8951,jbphoto88,4.4,What a great experience this beer was. Rich deep ruby in color with a nice tan head that pours rich and creamy. Clear and beautiful this beer is a visual joy.  Smell is caramel and malty mixed with a musky oak scent. Kind of like the smell of old weathered wood you might find in an old west mining town. Mix that rustic nose with some IPA-ish hops and grains and you have a superb scent.  Taste is just as much of an enjoyment. The malts are complimented by the woody oak flavor yielding a mild smooth flavor. Sweet vanilla bean is present throughout and is not the dominate flavor but a strong player. Not a big citrus hop flavor but a muted floral taste. They apologize with great bitterness though.  Smooth and creamy mouthfeel but the oak flavors is also the thing that disappoints. The finish is kind of dry and chalky leaving that woody flavor all over the palate. Not one of my favorite aftertastes but the rest of this beer makes up for that.

Deep and earthy, Organic- for lack of a better word. Sublime.  T - Dear Lord. This is easily one of the best tasting beers I've ever had. I love hops, and there are certainly plenty of them in this brew. Unbelievably complex, but not in the least bit overwhelming. Perfectly balanced for my palate. A malt foundation serves as a platform upon which a hoppy tower of unbelievable majesty is constructed. There's oak characters- vanilla, spices, loam. There's hop structures- bitterness, tang, grapefruit. Just plain great.  M - Medium to thick in body, and prefect carbonation.

This pours a very nice dark reddish-brown color, with a quickly disappearing cream-colored head and minimal lacing. The smell is very strongly wooden and oaky, with a hint of floral bitterness that I can't quite place. The brew is very bitter, with an extremely wooden taste. I can taste very little in the form of hops, and a very small amount of relatively subdued malt near the end. There is a very dry finish that is preceded by a very light and active carbonation. This is very heavily flavored by the oak, and makes it nearly impossible to drink multiple bottles in a single sitting.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,MCDuhamel,4.85,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip glass at fridge temperature; allowed to warm over 45 minutes or so.  A: Pours a dark brown which shows ruby against the light. A rather off-white head forms and quickly settles to a tight cap. Some lacing down the glass. The beer is completely clear and shows lively carbonation.  S: As it warms, the beer releases hop aromatics and apple skin notes. The oak is very subtle, contributing a mild vanilla note.  T: Green apple and pear predominate at first, yielding to some American hops. The oak contributes some tannic spiciness and very subtle vanilla that is really present only in the finish and more so as the beer warms. The beer ends dry and bitter, but without any astringency or harshness.  M: Light to medium-bodied, the beer dances on my tongue.  D: At over 7% abv, this fairly strong ale should be harder to drink. Unlike most oaked ales I have had, this one is actually refreshing and welcoming. I wish I had bought a 6 pack instead of the lone bottle.  Overall: Most oaked beers, whether stouts or otherwise, show a lot of oak. Not so this one. The use of oak is masterful, allowing the oak to support the rest of the beer without in any way dominating it. This is an outstanding beer, worthy of seeking out and worth every penny of its not insubstantial price. It is an elite American ale.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

S- Hops, citrus, vanilla, and a little hint of oak.  T- An immediate punch of hops, quickly followed by bitterness held in check by the oak flavor. An interesting balance. Very complex as the hops, oak, and malt fight for control of the palate. The oak flavor holds through to the finish which is dry and left me a little thirsty. A touch of the alcohol comes out a the end.  M- Smooth and creamy, well carbonated. Nice to sip slow and let the flavors play out their struggle for control. Hides the 7.2% ABV well until the finish.  D- Well balance and drinkable not a session beer but goes down easy.  Not a beer for everyone, you will either love it or hate it.

Nice hint of sweet caramel malts.  Smoother and easier to drink than their standard Arrogant Bastard. There is at least an attempt at balance here. Sweet caramel malts and pine and citrus hops battle for your attention. The hops win out, in the end. Rests on the tongue as a nicely balanced brew but finishes with a big hops bite. The whole thing has an overtone of a nice oaky smoothness and flavor.  Good full bodied brew. Nice and creamy. Almost perfect carbonation level. Yum.  Very good drinkability.

Head retention was just like the regular ABA, phenomenal and good lacing.  Notes of citrus hops, not over the top, with some caramel malt character.  I think this is how Arrogant Bastard should have been. The complexity is quite remarkable with a solid dose of hops and malts forming the backbone, and a nice earthy flavor that sends this thing home. Loved the oak flavor alot, really brings a whole other dimension to this beer.  Wonderful mouthfeel. Smooth and delicious.  Highly drinkable.

147,8951,dancinwillie,3.5,"Pours big and bold. It didn't seem like I was going to get a head on it, so halfway through, more aggressive I became. Head was there, and it was one of those cascading beauties that you usually see with Imperial Stouts. Brownish when I look at it on the table, orange hued when held up to the light. Topped by the aforementioned head, thick and creamy, the color off-white, with bright orange highlights. Some nice lacing as the head retreats.  Aroma is strong in this one, citrus and caramel mainly.  Caramel is my first impression, followed quickly by red grapefruit. As far as the ""oaking"" of this beer, I have to say that it's on the low spectrum. Some general woodiness, a bit of vanilla, I'm not quite sure how to interpret, but it's pretty good. I'd like to do a side by side with the original, as well as the double. For some reason, I was under the impression that this was barrel aged, and that this would have more of a bourbon flavor. I'm happy to say it's not. I'm not a fan generally of those flavors, therefore, I'm happier with this than I anticipated. Digressions aside, this is a very tasty beer. A bit of alcohol warmth as the temperature of the beer drops, but not anywhere near a ""bite."" The downside here, is the hops seem quite a bit less assertive. I wish they were more up front.  Mouthfeel is good, very full bodied and surprisingly, quite refreshing.  Overall, I could drink a few, but definitely not what I'd call a session beer. More like a special occasion beer.

The remnants cling to the side of the glass in a beautiful fashion. Carbonation looks straight out of a macro commercial. No doubt this is a good looking drink.  The oak jumps out of the glass in the smell, it is the first and strongest thing to hit you. Further inspection reveals a citrusy hop scent, maybe rasins as well. Not very complex, but strong as hell.  Taste was actually pretty pleasant, hitting in this order: wood; malt; hops. The oak is a positive component here, I don't feel that it overrides the other flavors so much as compliments them. This is very interesting in that it sets off many tastes that on paper I would find to be in harsh conflict and puts them together in a drinkable and even tasty presentation. Very good.

Plenty of herbal, floral, fruity, and spicy hops aromas to enjoy.  T: Not a ton of difference in my eyes compared to the original AB in flavor. A mildly accentuated malt profile, but the hops still dominate with exceptional complexity with multiple hops notes including spicy, floral, herbal, and fruity flavors with presence in that order from most to least.  M: Easy to drink because the carbonation is so low and leaves the flavor to dominate and feel natural.  D: The oak chip treatment smooths out the hops flavors, but overall, the differences are small and I'll be sticking with the original article.

S-Very much like AB, meaning citrus and pine highlights, with a maltier profile.  T-Sweet malts, citrus and pine continue, and are balanced by a lingering hop finish.

This is a more balanced and less aggressive version of it, but it is a winner in its own right. It is beautiful and it is tasty...I'm not sure what else you could ask for in a beer. Regular AB certainly still has a place on my shelf, but this is a great offshoot. Now I want to do a back to back and really sort out the nuances.  I was looking forward to trying this for a long time, and it does not let me down. Would LOVE to see what this tastes like on tap.

I won't go into great depth about this brew other than to say that from the moment i cracked my first to the moment i stumbled to bed, it was a glorious experience. This is a truly beautiful beer to look at. The transparent, red brick color and the fluffy white head made me salivate like a bell at dinnertime and the hoppy, woody smell completely lives up to the bravado on the back of the bottle. If anything, the taste only takes the appearance and smell to another level. I can't say enough good things about this beer. Everytime i drink it, I find something else to love about it.

Nice sticky lacing and swirls on the top though. The aroma is more malt and earthy wood to me than it is hoppy. The flavor is hoppy, but that just seems like part of it. Arrogant bastard is very hoppy, and it makes no excuses that it is designed to be hoppy, the oaked version just seems to have hops as part of the mix. The malt stands out a bit more, probably because the hops mellow with the addition of the oak aging time.

A translucent body emits ruby red highlights when held up to light.  When held under the nose, the beer emits aroma of charred wood and hops. Red hops. It just smells red.  As I sip, I first notice a sweet taste, immediately followed by big, yet mellow, hops. There are layers upon layers of taste involved here, and they all blend well. The three dominant tastes are sweet maltiness, hops, and wood.  This beer has a medium-thin body that carries the tastes so well. Crisp carbonation leaves a refreshing feel in the mouth.

Head similar to a porter. No hazing of note.  S - An unusual head. Most a phenolic flavors, with some kind of edgy background that I assume comes from the oak aging. Some fruitiness that at times as been associated with oxidation.  T - Starts off with a light smoky flavor that moves into a very potent phenolic flavor. Finishes with that rough edginess of the wood. The particular wood would be hard to discern, but it is certainly there. Continues big time in the aftertaste.  M - Oily and edgy. Biting and acidic. Alcohol is very warming. Carbonation is noticeable.  D - More of a one off beer. The notes from the wood aging begin to dominate the taste buds.

Grapefruity aroma portends strong presence of hops to come. Taste is big bitter hops. Magnificent complexity of flavors! Blindfolded, one could easily mistake this brew for an IPA due to the immense hit of sour hops. Then the sweet vanilla oakiness presents itself with carmel maltiness and a good dollop of yeasty sweetness to balance the sour hops. Some smokiness lingers in the finish, explaining the dark roasted appearance in the glass. The sour hops flavor lasts longest of all. Mouthfeel is a crisp alcohol bite followed by a slightly oily coating on the tongue.  This is a big, in-your-face ale that is not for the squeamish.

147,8951,magictrokini,4.67,"Magnum. Finally broke down and bought one, and it was worth it. Pours light mahongany with a ring of foam as the head. The aroma is full of caramel, malt and oak. The taste is phenomenal. The oak tamed the previous Arrogant Bastard, making it seem deeper and mellowed in taste. The malt is sweeter and the hops are more flavorful, but without the bite. Its almost like a scotch finished in a sherry cask. I really hope this one finds a permanent place place in Stone's lineup.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,avalon07,4.53,"A: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had an amber color and a cloudy texture. There was an inch of foamy, long-lasting head and excellent lacing. Basically how an American strong ale should look.  S: Had a very hoppy nose, along with some malt and pine.  T: A surprisingly subtle flavor. Lots of hops, malt, pine and even hints of citrus. Underplayed, especially when compared to the regular Arrogant Bastard, which has a huge flavor.  M: A highly carbonated beer with a smooth finish. Medium-bodied.  D: On the whole an excellent, drinkable beer with lots of character. The oak adds a interesting dimension. Very mellow.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,cleeze,4.4,"Maybe my new favorite beer right now. Hopefully I'm ""worthy"" enough. Yellow fizzy beer is for wussies.  With that said I was quite pleased to try the oaked bastard. I'm a huge fan of the regular but the oaked flavor blows the original out of the water.  Started with the appearance, it pours a beautiful dark reddish, amber color. The appearance is maybe one of my favorite aspects of the beer. It had a nice creamy and frothy head on it with some bad ass lacing kicking around for a quick minute.  It smells very hoppy, almost like they're gonna jump right outta the glass and bitch smack you. Deffinaly can detect the oakiness on this bastard.  Taste started off sweet... Nice and malty with a great bitter hopp finish. I can't stress enough what the oak adds to this beer. Simply amazing. It had a pleasant mouthfeel as well. I can drink it all night long. Thanks for another kick ass brew, STONE!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Bung,4.1,"Rusty red/brown pour, cream like colored head. Smells a little bit like a sweet fruitcake. Taste mixes sweet malty biscuit with some citrus and pine.

This beer looks impressive. smell is really citric hoppyness with some major sweet pungent malt. It smells intense. ok the first sip I was like ""whoa this is weird"" second sip ""whoa this is good"" third sip "" this is frickin awesome"" it reminds me of a more on the malty side IPA. It's very complex. there's alot going on in this beer. It's not for the weak of heart. I was wondering if it would be as good as they hype it up to be in their little rant on the back of the bottle (hilarious) Mouthfeel is nice small bubbled carbonation, strangely east to knock back. drinkability is not soo good though because it's 7.2% I could only drink like two of these. It's really good.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

The appearance is of a caramal amber color with a quickly dissolving head. A small head of white clings to the sides throughout the session. Lacing is nice.  Oak smelling with a complex structure of different scents.  I like this much better than the original Arrogrant Bastard though that is a high class brew.  Highly recommended and very drinkable.

S: Piney earthy hops up front with a nice smooth sweetness. Very nice.  T: The piney earthy hops jump out at you from the onset. Medium body is hoppy but malty sweet, the finish is where you can really pick up the oak and vanilla flavors. Finish is bitterness. Wow, this is a great beer on tap.  M: Medium to full, it really coats the mouth. No real alcohol taste and the bitterness lingers.  D: Medium to high. These slide right down.  Overall a great, great beer that is significantly better on draft. Amazing what they can do with an oak barrel.

147,8951,popery,4.2,"Well, it is what it says on the label, an oaked Arrogant Bastard. It is probably unfortunate that I'm reviewing this beer during Double Bastard season. I love the amplified flavors of the stronger version. On the other hand, this beer tones down those flavors with a very refined but strong oak taste. A part of me misses the full bore of the pure stuff. This is a beer to pair against AB and thus appreciate its additions. Paired with Double Bastard (I'm not doing so directly but I've just had a lot recently), the oaked version is just a touch lacking. Then again, this seems to follow the Arrogant Bastard hierarchy. Double Bastard is the best drink to hold while you look down your nose at other beers, but the oaked has a more refined arrogance. It tastes like oak, probably the most arrogant of wood flavors. It's bitter and almost chalky and just dares you not to like it. It's the kind of taste that people tell you that you have to learn to like and, damn it, they're right. The appearance is the cherry on top with the color of an oak-aged brandy and a soapy head with plenty of lacing. It's just a difficult beer to describe without referencing Arrogant Bastard and firmly establishes itself as an even more snobbish version of AB. I mean I love it, but a duck's a duck. My only real thought while I drink it is how the oak really came through. You won't confuse this beer with the normal version. It's the kind of beer to get drunk to while you quietly judge a crowd of people and they come up decidedly lacking.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,patobandito,4.51,"This beer practically taunted me into drinking it. Reading the label made me feel unworthy of such a fine brew, and after tasting it, I have to agree. I have no where near the amount of beer tasting experience needed to adequately describe this brew. But I will give it my best shot.  It pours a dark reddish brown color, looks amazing in a glass. Leaves a thin head with a fairly good retention and good lacing. Smells of hops with a slight hint of malt. Taste is indescribable. At first it is hoppy, but then a fine malt taste overwhelms on the finish. Exceptionally drinkable. One of the best beers I have had in some time. I will definitely be trying more beers from Stone in the future.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,MrHurmateeowish,3.61,"12oz bottle from Whole Foods in Portland. Pours a hazy copper body with a half inch of light tan head. Lemon, grapefruit, pith, pine, with some woodiness. Tastes citrussy, with pine, pith, lemon, grapefruit, wood, vanilla... Um, cat pee notes? Hints of caramel and toffee in the aftertaste. A little aqueous in the mouthfeel with light carbonation. This beer grew on me, but I must say I was much more impressed with regular Arrogant Bastard and Double Bastard.

147,8951,bamadog,4.47,"I love just about anything from Stone. The attitude alone makes me feel like they're challenging me to drink whatever they make, so hey, I'm a sucker for their advertising if nothing else. Despite what they tell me though, I feel I'm worthy :)  Appearance: Poured a nice deep reddish/copper color - a little cloudy and hardly any head at all despite a fairly hefty pour to try to bring it out. What did form disappeared quite quickly.  Smell: Bitter. The hops are very apparent and the alcohol is definitely apparant as well in the back -- really came out as I worked my way through the glass and it warmed just a little bit.  Taste: Extra bitter -- hoppy and just a slight (very slight) taste of something sweet at the end. I can't quite put my finger on what it is though, not really fruity, but not really sugary like a caramel either, so I can't say for sure what it was -- very interesting.  Mouthfeel: Awesome -- made me salivate a ton and quickly dries. I'd say a touch a sticky oilyness to it as well and it was very pleasurable. Not a strong carbonation, so it was the hops doing the work in terms of what it did to my mouth.  Drinkability: For lack of a better term, this beer was f-u-n fun to drink. It was extra bitter and that made it worthwhile alone; but yes, this beer has a high drinkability. The ABV is a little high, so I'd likely take it easy and not drink a ton of it, but it was so much fun and such a great taste that it's worth it...

Pours a deep brown red with a thin white head, huge streamers of carbonation, and amazing lacing. The smell is surprisingly slight but malty and sweet. The Flavor is vast, reddish, sweet, with cherry, wood, and smoke, like tobacco. The mouthfeel is large and round, viscous and carbonated.

The oak comes through much more in the flavor. There is a slight vanilla taste and a bit of tannic action. The hops balance the oak and leave a nice bitterness at the end.  Mouthfeel is very full, slightly drying, very very nice.  My only qualm is that the oak could be a little less to let the base flavors shine through, but other than that, a near perfect oaked beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,bluemoonswoon,3.92,"Big thanks to ThirstyHopHead for including this as an extra.  Bit of a chill hazed dark rum colored amber and is topped with a quickly forming toasted marshmallow head that fades into a thickish ring, while leaving behind some lattice-work lacing that could stand to stick around longer.  Smells like red gummi worms, I'll let this warm up a bit...really like no beer I've ever smelled, gummi worm is still there but blended with a thick, resiny pine aroma. Not really picking up oak notes, but again it could just be too cold right now...little bit more warmth yields a slightly sweet vanilla aroma but again, not very much oakiness.  Sugary fruitiness to open opens up to a slightly creamy, slightly grainy maltiness. Oak tannins are finally apparent and mix well with the notes of vanilla I am picking up here. All of this mixes together as the fruitiness reasserts itself into a wonderfully complex flavor profile. The fruitiness here is not grapefruit or orange or mango, it's not any of these things. The flavor is a bit difficult to describe. The fruitiness is one the sweeter side, vanilla and honey, but nothing overpowering and all blends well with a sweet, underlying oakiness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and leaves a long and lasting bitterness down the center of the tongue long after the last drop empties from the glass. Carbonation does not do much for be and could stand to be just the sligthest bit snappier, felt a bit uneven in places, that is to say, I thought the consistency of the beer could stand to be just a bit thicker, more substantive. Other than that I could not put this beer down, it has a beguiling flavor that you can't really put your finger on. The most import thing, however, is that this beer tastes good and that I would be more than happy to try another if I could get my hands on one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Woody roasted malts of front, big citrus kick in the middle, and the oak really shows up on the finish. Great flavors and excellent balance.

S- Not as strong as I expected, kind of mellow actually. I smell lots of sweet malts, less citrusy hops than expected, some vanilla and oak. T- Also mellower than I expected. The hops take a back seat in the flavor to the sweet caramel malts, but are definitely present. Some woody (I wouldn't necessarily say oak if it wasn't on the label) flavors and vanilla as well, M- Thick, creamy, wonderful. D- Lot's of flavor here and the abv isn't high enough to stop you from coming back for more.  This is really a tasty beer.

Head reduces to a thin film with a little more head at the rim. Good amount of lacing.  S: Picked up some earthiness, hops, and a slight woodsy smell, but I had to search for the scents. It was hard to pick up much aroma.  T: Some hoppy bitterness and bite that is really smoothed out by a slight woodsy flavor. Not sure if this is a psychological thing because of the ""Oaked"" naming.  M: Very creamy for an amber brew. I felt it had lots of carbonation, but in a smooth sense; like a lot of tiny bubbles.  D: I could drink a good amount of these, with the slight bitterness being the only thing that would possibly hold me back from drinking more.

There is an abundance of alcohol esters and yeasty malts. Not sure if it was intended, but I get a slight bit of vanilla.  Taste: A hint of a metallic taste with a woody bitterness on the end. There is an initial sweetness that mellows into a nice caramel flavor. I did catch a little bit of a yeasty aftertaste over the oak.  Mouthfeel: An ale with less carbonation than I had expected, which actually benefits this beer. A rich and creamy beer that definitely lives up to its price tag.

The hops, though slightly dissipating from the start, tend to return and take over the finish. Rather interesting, but at times distracting from the sweetness tasted earlier.

147,8951,MasterSki,4.45,"20th review - woohoo! Now I can post new brews on this site. Picked up a sixer in Madison on the way back from Darkness Day.  A - Attractive mahogany color with one fingers of tan foam that dissipates slowly into an attractive big-bubbled lace. A small amount of carbonation is visible.  S - Toffee and malt, oak, hops and citrus. I wish more ales were this rich in the olfactory arena. Unsurprisingly it smells like Arrogant Bastard but with a bit of oak...  T - Starts sweet, ends bitter. The oak is pretty understated - likely because it's just oak chips and not barrel-aging. Keeps all the positive elements of AB - malty caramel front palette morphing into a hoppy bitter IPA at the end. The wood really comes out at the beginning but is quickly overwhelmed by hops.  M - Resinous - smooth, but a little more watery than I like. The carbonation is pretty unobtrusive. Nothing too special here.  D - I can see why they come in sixers. The 7.2% doesn't really make an appearance, although I can't drank too many woody beers in an evening (as the recent FOBAB proved).

The carbonation is light and pleasant.  Taste: It's big and malty and the oak is heavily present as is the alcohol. But it is nicely balanced with hops. There is definitely some complex flavors at work and I'm not sure I can identify them beyond the oak. It has an almost bourbon-like finish.  Overall impression: This is a great beer! I like it more than the regular Arrogant Bastard, which has been a favorite since I discovered it at the Telluride Blues and Brews Festival five years ago.

147,8951,ncbeermonger,4.97,"mmm that's good beer!  pours very well into my trusty sam adams beer glass. The smell is outstanding! Buttery, smooth smell, hints of citrus, and floral hops. Head is almost a non entity.  The taste is outstanding, why can't all beer taste like this? Tastes smooth, hops are there, and the oak comes through like a champ! I prefer this one over the non oaked.  The mouthfeel is amazing, much lighter than the beer looks, super smooth.  This beer is one of the most drinkable beers ever brewed ANYWHERE.

147,8951,Douglas14,4.53,"Night and day difference on tap than from the bottle...more so than possibly any other beer I have had the opportunity to try both ways.  It pours a deep mahogany-ruby color with an exceptional head that continues to rise after you are finished pouring. The head is tan and thick and leaves some of the thickest, stickiest lacing I've ever seen. After the head resides, and layer stays above the beer throughout the drink. The aroma is of dark fruit, hops, alcohol, and of course oak...a lot of it too! The taste is more focused on hops with a background character that is still very noticeable of oak and wood. The hop profile is very much of resin and pine...almost sticky in your mouth...it goes great with the smoothness that the oak lends to the brew. Outstanding on tap.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

T: I made the mistake of keeping this beer in the refrigerator instead of my wine cooler. When drunk cold, the complex character of this brew is masked.. Upon warming, the benefits of the oak aging come through. Initial hoppiness is followed by smoky burnt sugar and oak.  M: Medium-heavy.

There is also vanilla and a good hop smell. Some maltiness too.  Taste: Malts, and then the oak/wood which seems to really make this interesting. Hops do a good job in this one, every flavor blends in extremely well.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, and goes down VERY smoothly. Medium bodied  Drinkability: Regardless of the relatively high ABV, this is easy to drink. Tastes good, nice body, and creaminess.

Smell: A joining of sweet-smelling maltiness, primarily caramel with a smattering of dark brown sugar and rich hoppiness coming across as notes of plump grapefruits, perfume, and wood. Oh, and don't forget about the vanilla.  Taste: Toasty malts with a dark caramel sweetness and taste of brown sugar. Slight cherry fruitiness in the distant background. A drop or two of vanilla extract. Hoppy citrus and wood flavor, and that very same bit of fresh, hand-picked mint I get from the original. Moderate hop bitterness combines with a lightly astringent oaken component and both last through and beyond the dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation.

A half finger, lightly yellow tinted head that lasts the entire way through..  S: Very nice fruity, woody smell. The oak really comes through here in a nice way, complimented by a very nice and elegant nectar.  T: The Oak hits subtly at onset, and carries through to a series of nectar other light fruits and really strong but well balanced hops. Strong oak taste to finish.  Overall, very enjoyable for anytime of the year, and a little drier then I had expected.

Creamy off-white head. Almost identical to regular AB.  S: Smells of spicy/citrusy hops, with a definite sense of the malt. Less pronounced hops than regular AB.  T: Amazing. The oaking has definitely smoothed out many of the rougher edges of the beer. Smoothly transitions from malt sweetness to spicy and citrusy hops in each sip.  M: Exceptionally smooth in the mouth. Feels less agressive than regular AB towards the end of each sip, possibly from a lower carbonation, or mellowing of the hops? There's also an almost creamy-smooth dimension to this beer.  D: Amazingly drinkable.  Overall, a more complex and smoother version of Arrogant Bastard Ale (which was amazing in its own right).

This beer pours dark cherry amber with a creamy cappuchino colored head that leaves a nice film over the beer and leaves a bit of lace. The aroma smells of caramel, toasted and honey malts along with musty woodiness and faint floral hops. The taste is up front with the malt characteristics of caramel, toast, and honey but the beer then gives way to the oak characteristics before finally finishing with a piney hop characteristic. The beer also displays a medium-full mouthfeel with a subtle carbonation. Overall, a very enjoyable beer. I would like to see a more potent hop characteristic like the regular Arrogant Bastard, but the oaked version pleases nonetheless.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

The smell is very nice, with lots of sweet, candied hops. Citrus, apricot, and a hint of caramel are there. I might get a bit of oak in there, but it's hard to detect.  As with the nose, there are a lot of hops on the flavor, giving the beer a lot of spice followed by a ton of bittneress that sticks around forever. The mouthfeel is nice and full with mid/low carbonation.  This is a really good beer. It is a bit different from the original, but if I wasn't told it was oak aged I don't know if I would be able to tell that that is what was different.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

The first sip is oak and Hops fighting for control at the same time, it's so nicely balanced it's a tie, and the hop finish is complete. A very heavy Ale and I would guess it would be easy to bugger this combination up, but Stone has out done themselves. A truly fantastic ale, in a league of it's own. The only negative is this is a one bottle at a time kinda ale, I can't see sitting around and draining 5-6 of these.

The smell is biscuity malty with unidentified fruits, with toasty caramel and a fine woodiness at the extreme periphery of the profile.  The taste is very mellow and sweetly malty with layers of toasty grain and fruity caramel. A bitter zing of citrusy hops and a drying woody blast of fine, sweet oak linger in the aftertaste. A bit of alcohol warming serves notice that this seemingly-innocuous Bastard is packing heat!

Nose is certainly oaky, with a big upfront kick of a sour mash. Also have hints of cherry and plum, with a nice floral hop finish.  Taste overall is just excellent from start to finish. It begins with some nice bready malts and finishes with a mild floral hop. However, your left with an unexpected, yet satisfying bitter hop after taste. My one critique is that I would've liked to pick up the oaky/fruit aroma in the taste. May attempt to drink out of a snifter next time.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy - a great consistency. Slight carbonation. I truly enjoy this - but probably after a few may be overwhelmed by the hop after taste.

I wasn't even able to try the Oaked Bastard when I visited the brewery in Escondido last year so this is a long awaited treat. Pours a transparent reddish dark brown with a solid tan head that leaves plenty of lace in its wake. The nose has plenty of hops matched nicely with and earthy, woody, smokiness that really adds an extra layer of complexity to the common Bastard.  Grapefruit is the major player up front as the oak and smoke covers the back end fully and tastefully. Mouthfeel is smooth and carries the heavy flavors matchlessly. Some sweet, whisky like wisps is the back end of the taste. This is exquisite stuff, not for amateurs. Absolutely first class.

S - Lots of pine and other woody aromas. Some vanilla and a trace of dark fruit are in there as well.  T - Piney hops dominate, with the oak adding a good deal of spiciness to the brew. Malts are well-hidden, but just assertive enough to balance this enormous beer.  M - Full-bodied, wet finish. The spicy wood notes linger on the palate for a while. The carbonation makes itself known without being overpowering.  D - To be honest, I can't see myself drinking more than one of these in a single sitting. It's a damn good beer, but the spiciness of it is a bit much for me. I definately prefer the non-oaked Bastard over this one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Poured a wonderfully beautiful, transparent, deep ruby hue, raising a full, rich tan-colored head with good retention and thick lacing.  Aroma was sweet, with a full bouquet of fruity hop notes filling the nose.  Medium-bodied with a perfectly subdued effervescence. Tasty, fruity sweet flavors developed toward the front of the palate; balanced, none-overwhelming hop flavors played across the rest of the flavor spectrum, with pronounced grapefruit notes. Finished with a slightly lingering bitterness.  Highly quaffable, and decidedly delicious. I expected more of a woody, oakiness to be present, but sadly (or perhaps not so sadly, I don't really know for sure) the oak didn't show itself overtly.

Rich and complex but subtle and exceedingly well balanced. Somehow soft and enveloping and at the same time biting and bitter. The oak barrell aging does wonders for this beer.  Mouth is a weighty and viscous medium.  Drinkability is excellent.

Rich malty aroma, sweet/thick caramel smell, and just a hint of smokiness. Some sweet citrus flavors, slight grapefruit bitterness, but definitely a malt-heavy brew, robust and rich, and again, just faint hints of smoke/wood.

Not quite as strong and intense as I would expect, but still good.  T&M: Initially fairly bitter with some herbal/spruce-like and citrus hop flavors. Caramel malt makes its entrance midway through, before giving way to a finish that is lightly hoppy with some smooth vanilla notes from the oak. With warming, a fruit-like flavor becomes more apparent on the tail end. It's big, yet balanced. The body is definitely more full with a perfect carbonation level.

It has a rich, opaque, dark amber tone with a creamy, off white head, which didn't stick around for long.  The nose was kind of surprising. I was expecting the wood to come through stronger than it did. As it was, it was hardly noticeable in this instance. It hints citrus, brown sugar, and a touch of oak to accompany the hops. I gathered all the above in the taste with more of the oak coming through. Not as boozy a flavor as many strong ales; this being more akin to an IPA.  The mouthfeel was lighter than the appearance advertised, initially. With each drink the texture increased. By the fifth drink or so it was more robust, but still lighter than I would have thought prior.  All in all this was a solid beer.

I had no idea I was such an unworthy piece of crap!  This pours a dark, hazy brown. 1/4"" of head that stuck around for a while.  Smell is mostly of hops.  The taste is, well, like the bottle said, I'm not worthy. There's a lot going on, and I probably can't really decipher it all. It's hoppy, mostly citrusy. There's also some smooth caramel malts. SO confusing. It almost seems like a contradiction to say, but it's quite hoppy and quite smooth at the same time. It's got a medium body. Not too heavy. Alcohol is there, but it's not overpowering.  Drinkability is excellent. For a while, I was on a hoppy beer kick, but I've gotten away from the hoppy beers now. But even if you're not a fan of really hoppy beers, this is a must try.

Lots of sweet malt and piney hops that accompany an earthy/woody aroma. There's also a very nice floral hop aroma that decreases as the beer warms.  Tastes great. It's very sweet up front, followed shortly by a wallop of piney hops before evolving into a woody flavor and finally ending with a flavor that's somehow bitter and sweet at the same time. Every now and then I'll get a slight hint of citrus hops.  Mouthfeel is great. The beer does a good job of coating my mouth, and it's got a great thickness to it. The carbonation is a bit more subdued than the original AB and this works well with the mild oak flavor.  Drinkability is very good.

147,8951,ATLbeerDog,4.48,"Bottle - Pours a cloudy reddish/brown - unappealing, not pretty to look at. Ok, I'll say it, It is ugly. Smells of deep fruits and lots of alcohol. The aroma is complex with honey and pear battling a ton of other notes all screaming to be heard. First sip is tangy/bitter - also complex. There is a whole lot going on here. The oak really makes this 7.2% ABV beer seem a ton stronger. An intriguing complex ale that is spicy, bitter, and tangy.

147,8951,hellomcfly,4.28,"I got this beer in a trade from traquairlover as an extra but I had tried it before I decided to hang onto it for a while. I've only been holding onto it for 5 months or so but I really think it tastes better than fresher oaked AB i've had in the past. I don't know how long traquairlover himself had this beer.  Poured from bottle into tulip glass  Pours a pretty dark ruby-brown. A large, frothy tan head on top. Head holds up for a good while.  Smells of caramel malt and citrusy hops.  Wonderful hop flavor. A bit of a grassy and grapefruit vibe. Caramel malt is more pronounced than I remember fresher bottles being. I think the hop flavor is still here but the hop bite has been subdued. The head is very creamy. I think the little bit of aging has brought out the delicious malts and oak.  Great mouthfeel. Creamy and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation.  Drinkability is high. It's a tasty beer and at 7.20 abv I could drink a few.  Every time I have had this beer it's been good but this particular bottle however old it is, is a bit more interesting to me since the hops don't quite knock me over the head as is the case with most hoppy beers these days.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Smell: The hop gang's all here - grassy, floral, and citric, with especially nice notes of rose and lavender. Malts are mostly caramelly with some peach notes and just a hint of woody spice from the oak.  Taste: Mmm... very nice, sweet, and toasty with a mildly bitter but robustly flavorful hop profile and an earthy, resinous, vaguely smoky edge of oak. More fruity and vinous than the original, and seemingly less dry - but it may only appear that way due to the subdued hops.  Mouthfeel: Dry, medium bodied, and perfectly carbonated; not too sprizy but just lively enough to carry the flavor.

What a wonderful look.  Smells are oak chips, caramel malt that is tinged by a fruitiness of hop character.  The taste of this beer begins fruity and sweeet and then has a hop kick near the end that rides out with plenty of spice and grapefruit flavor that isn't overly bitter. The mouthfeel is medium with steady carbonation that doesn't fizzle out too quickly.  I would rank this high on drinkability for the style considering it is 7% and really packs alot into that abv. Rank among the highest in the extreme category, but still keeps a reasonable abv.

Tart fruit and rich malt greet the palate. Dry suggestions of oak, or at least woody vanilla. A good stiff hop bitterness resides in the finish and grows and spreads seemingly without bounds to the point that it is the primary flavor. Medium-thick-to-thick body, polite yet pushy carbonation.  Sampled from a 12oz bottle. I'd like to experience it in a bigger bottle; it grew on me right up to the last sip and I want more.

A: Beautiful rich deep amber coloring, finger of head and heavy lacing. Great looking brew.  S: The oak is the predominant scent which is wonderful. The nose also picks up some of the hops as well. Rich smelling brew, gotta give it a 5. Can't imagine any better.  T & M: The standard Arrogant Bastard is one of my favorites and I enjoyed this beer as I expected. The oak definitely adds some additional complexity, especially in the finish. Perfectly balanced brew.

147,8951,DavoleBomb,4.35,"Poured into a pint glass. This is the last of the six-pack I bought for my birthday last year (October 1st). I've read on forums that this beer is better fresh. Now I get to see for myself.  4.5 A: Dark copper, medium brown color. Thick, creamy as hell head that leaves every spot of glass lace ridden. Head retains exceptionally well.  4.5 S: Oak wood (obviously) is the strongest aroma. Earthy, floral and herbal hops. Sweet caramel and toffee on the malt end.  4.5 T: This truly is one hell of a beer. Woody foremost, followed by mint and some citrus. The woodiness places you in a saw mill or something like that, just inhaling wood essence. Finishes with a sour/bitter combination as well as with a wood aftertaste.  4.0 M: Medium body that would be perfect with both a little more creaminess and a little more biting carbonation. Warming at the end with the alcohol content.  4.0 D: Excellent beer. I would argue that aging it does make it better for most people. The biggest difference between a fresh one and an almost year old one is the aftertaste. In the fresh OAB, the woody aftertaste is even stronger than the beer taste. I personally like that about the beer, but it decreses its drinkability. The aged one has a more subdued aftertaste which is more palatable for most people.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Winter,4.45,"12 oz. bottle pours a dark ruby brown with creamy khaki colored head. Nice malty aroma consisting of oak, vanilla, brown sugar and chocolate malt. The mouthfeel is medium to full with decent carbonation. Malt dominates the flavor. Oak, raisin and vanilla all come to the forefront. Piney, bitter hoppiness midway. Oak resumes along with some alcohol and lingering hop bitterness.  Arrogant Bastard itself is a great beer. Oaked Arrogant Bastard is that much better.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,allengarvin,4.42,"Poured into a NB Chalice, this beer is a nice reddish-tinted brown color. It doesn't seem to have quite the same head retention as the normal bastard, but it does leave good lacing. Lots of sensuous hops in the nose, a good underlying malt, and maybe a faint oakiness... it's hard to detect over the other quite strong scents. Oakiness comes through more in the flavor, but it's not a large flavor component. It's easily as good as the ordinary version, but it doesn't seem to add much complexity or interest, to me. It does seem a tad smoother, though.  Top-notch, just like the ordinary AB, but probably not worth the 50% premium price they put on top.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Lots of lacing down the glass.  S= I found aromas of soft oak, brown sugar, pie crust, and some herbal notes.  T= I tasted soft woody oak up front blended with a mild sweetness and hints of vanilla. As each sip progressed, I also detected some hop bitterness. Finish was long and dry.  MF= Medium bodied and a little creamy on the tongue. The dryness/astringency was a bit bracing at times, but still pleasant.  D= This was a very interesting beer. I apprciated the oak flavors playing against the malt sweetness and the big hop biterness.

In the 1960s Bernard Miles used to advertise Mackeson Stout on TV with the tagline ""It looks good, it tastes good, and by golly it does you good"". Of course, they wouldn't be able to use the third one of those descriptors these days but I reckon a glass of Oaked AB would be fine by me on the basis of 'A little of what you fancy does you good'. Not a beer I could drink all night but certainly something I'd like to have on hand in my fridge at all times.

M - Creamy, medium-heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation is spot on.  D - While I really REALLY love this beer. I can't drink too many of these. I think it's best savored slowly and one at a time.

I was floored when I saw it lurking in the back of the cooler and was even more excited when he decided to hand it over at no cost.  The beer poured a gorgeous ruby with a tan head. The lacing was prevalent throughout. As for the flavor, just imagine the regular Arrogant Bastard, but with a heaping helping of oak. This stuff is phenomenal. The balance struck between big citrusy hops and rich malt is complimented greatly by the addition of oak. I wasn't expecting any alcohol flavor, and in fact I found none. This isn't much of a surprise at 7.2%, but the folks at Stone do a great job masking the alcohol in their higher abv beers nonetheless.  The smell is once again dominated by the oak with no hint of alcohol to be found by my estimation, though the citrus notes of the hops poke their way through.  By my count, there should still be four more of these suckers at the store, and if I have it my way, at least one more will be mine. I can't wait to have it again.

It is a nice red color with a puffy white head that laces all the way down the glass. It smells great, the oak really comes through but it also smells very sweet.  The taste in one word.... boozy. This beer tastes more like 9.5% than 7.2%. Don't get me wrong I like strong beers with an alcohol kick occasionally but this is not boozy in a good way. Strong alcohol bite, very subtle smokiness, strong, sweet malts, not too hoppy. Not very smooth.  It is very oily and thick beer and stays with you. Strong aftertaste that isn't great.  All in all I may drink this again, but I won't pay for it. I hear it is much better on tap and I may be persuaded to try it on draft but the bottle was just mediocre.

Smell, to be expected, there was some Oak character in there, not as much as I would have expected, I had to search for it. Has a very sweet smell, almost like candy. Had some real bourbon/cognac quality to it. Very complex nose.  Taste was very good. Malty, with some hops to come in after.

A- Deep, dark brown with mahogony and almond colors thrown in as highlights. No head to speak of; very oily looking, not much carbonation or 'sparkle' to this one yet.  S- Sweet from the malt to the tune of molasses and brown sugar but also hoppy and fruity. The alcohol warms you in the chest and the vanilla and oak round out the nose. Very complex and not overpowering; balanced but deep.  T- Wow, sweet up front but instantly after that, the hops hit you with a earthy and rich taste. The oak is thrown in mostly 3/4 of the way through and enhances the bitterness a little more and also adds a vanilla-like presence. It definitely puts a spin on things. The alcohol is subtle, but detectable in the final taste. Again, very complex but nothing over the top. All flavors meld together nice and evenly.  M- Oily and medium. Medium carbonation.  D- For the drink and the experience, it is very nice. A session beer it is not.

Aroma is VERY nice: toasty caramel, very sweet, slightly nutty. First sip is very strong. Alcohol. Blunt and bitter. Carbonation is up front but as the taste lingers it becomes a little bit more complex, earthy. The aftertaste is, as expected, the added oak for this variety.  It's got a not-quite-IPA bitterness, along with a huge malt profile. I'm not sure they're really going for balance here, but they're not too far off. But it's not a great beer, it's just strong.

The taste is hoppy to the extent of being a little too bitter for my liking. The aftertaste is also too acidic and is actually giving me some wicked acid reflux. Oak and vanilla can also be found in the flavor, but are almost silenced by the bitterness. The mouthfeel is the best part of this entirely cocky beer.

I get the wood chips right away in the flavor with some smoky malts, a little sweet and tart with a dry hop finish. Seems perhaps a bit more mellow than the original AB which is probably the aging.

The nose is fairly complex and attractive, consisting of some nice citrus from hops, intermingled with vanilla, honey and butter from the oak aging. The oak aging really seems to tame some of the hoppiness I normally get from regular arrogant bastard. The flavors on the palate replicate the nose, and the oak aging gives this beer a very long, smooth mouthfeel. The beer finishes well, with the Oak cutting down on the bitterness a bit.

It HAS been sitting in the back of my fridge for at least a few months. I bought a six pack a while back and kept one to review, but only got around to it now. Carbonation is a lot less than I remember, but that may be due to poor memory. I don't taste the oak at all. Alcohol warmth and a good bit of bitterness. I taste slight caramel, but I have to really concentrate to find it. Cloves come through as well.  On second thought, I don't think it has gone bad, I just think it has been a long time since I've had it or regular Bastard. Moderate thickness. Carbonation doesn't come through well unless I hold it in my mouth. I could have a couple, but it's not what I would choose to drink often. I'm a little disappointed. It's not as good as I remember, and for the price, I would buy this very sparingly.  I feel bad not giving this beer a higher rating.

Check plus awarded for originality, check minus for not having brew-specific caps.  Appearance is a rich brown, with a thin, sandy-colored head. Vanishes quickly leaving a cap that stays throughout the duration, but leaves little lacing.  Aroma reminds me of camping with pine scent especially strong, fruitiness (berries specifically), and some spiciness.  Mouthfeel is thick, with good carbonation. A little slick and oily which brings the hop character to mind. Great mouthfeel on this one.  Taste is hoppy with a hint of citrus, specifically orange. Spices, some nuttiness. The oak is barely discernable to my untrained palate. Finishes with some good hop flavor. I don't know much about hops but I know that this beer uses them very well, balancing the hop bitterness with sweetness.  Overall this is a good beer.

147,8951,Hornet2003,4.4,"The oaked version of Arrogant Bastard seems quite similar to the original version. All the same elements that made the original a classic are well entrenched in this beer. The difference comes in the addition and not subtraction/supplementation of ingredients. The bitterness is still definitely there along with the strong caramel malty presence. The oak chips seem to add a bit of vanilla and a bit more sharpness to the taste. In my mind, this is perfect since this is Arrogant bastard, an in-your-face beer by all rights. There is also a creaminess in the mouthfeel that makes it easy enough to drink despite its aggressive nature. The head leaves a creamy lace as you drink.  Overall, pricey yet well-executed idea by Stone. Not a daily drinker, but a nice treat.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,opwog,3.42,"This was cask conditioned ""American Oak."" I have to say that I was not a big fan of the Oaked Bastard when I had it in the bottle, but I thought that I should still give this one a shot.  Alas, I am still not a fan of the Oaked Bastard on cask either, but for completely different reasons. Where I found the bottled version to be too tight and overly strong with the wood taste and feel, I found the cask to actually be a nicer balance of wood to hops and malts. The head was better and lasted quite a while for a cask. But the biggest problem here is that I think that Bastard is a a beer in any form that has to be served cold. Many beers are fine (or even better) at room temperature, but Bastard is not one of them (IMHO). Overall, as I said before, the balance of elements was better on this one than other Bastards, but that still doesn't mean that it is well balanced across the horizon of all ales.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,kosmoraios,4.23,"Pours a deep mahogany color with some ruby tints in it. 1-finger off-white head that lingers.  Aroma is of citrussy hops and caramel with a hint of the promised oak.  Taste is dominated by the hops, piney and floral with some grapefruit citrus. Deep caramel malt is evident. The woody flavor of the oak is there, but it's subtle, not overpowering.  Mouthfeel is peppery and full with an oily finish and pleasant aftertaste.  Pretty drinkable for the ABV.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Revvy,4.92,"Notes- Poured into a Belgian Goblet for tasting purposes.  Appearance - Poured a deep/dark reddish brown, with a beautiful 1/4"" creamy head which dissapated within a few minutes, leaving a nice lacing on the curve of the goblet and a surface layer of both large and small bubbles that remained on the surface of the beer throughout the drinking session.  Aroma - Cold, the ale has an almost smoky/woody aroma mixed with both resinous and floral hops, along with hints of brown sugar and bourbon. The wood nose that comes through is definitely oak, and it predominates the aromas. There is also a hint of coffee.  As the ale warms, the coffee, oak, bourbon comes richly to the surface, yet the hops still clearly comes through the center of the aroma...very citrussy.  At the warmest there is even a surprising hint of roasted coconut coming through.  Overall, the aroma is very porter-like...  Mouthfeel - The best word to describe the mouthfeel is ""tangy,"" there is definitely a hop ""bite"" to it that touches the tip of the tongue, roof of the mouth and the back of the throat upon swallowing. My favorite salty snack is wasabi coated peas, and the bite is very similar, though not as hot.The bite dissipates quickly and the ale coats the mouth smoothly, like a Belgian strong ale...or a chcolate milkshake, but with a bit more carbonation.  This definitely warms as it goes down..at about the half way mark in the glass one feels a warming of the belly.  Taste - There is a lot going on here...The flavors are nearly identical to the aromas...chocolate, toffee, coffee, oak, bourbon, smoke, and a definite hop bitterness...but the hops are mellowed, or smoothed over by the oak aging, which drops it out of the level of ""hop bomb"" like it's un-aged brother...It moves it into the realm of chocolate/coffee stout.  The flavors are there from cold to room temp, but grow more pronounced as it warms. A noticeable smokiness comes through as it warms, either from smoked grain or because of a toasting of the oak...it is not overpowering, like in a Rauchbier, it reminds me of a porter I once tried that had peat smoked malt as 1/32 of the grainbill...just a hint in aroma and flavor.  Overall - This is an amazing ale...at 7.2% ABV it is not a Barleywine, but in terms of drinking pleasure...taste, aroma, mouthfeel, it could very well be. Maybe drinking it in a different glass would have changed this impression, but in my Belgian maudite goblet it brings the barleywine tendencies out...  I found regular Arrogant Bastard to be very much a hop bomb (which I can only take in small doses) but this version is mellowed quite a lot. It is mellow, but it is not ""sissified,"" this is still a very aggressive ale. Think Arnold Swarzenagger in a tuxedo in ""True Lies"" as opposed to Arnold Swarzenagger as Conan the Barbarian.  The hoppiness still is reminiscent of bashing your head against the wall, but this wall is padded, like in a mental ward...The complexity of the aromas and flavors, especially the smokey/oakiness, makes this very drinkable...  Despite the Arnold comment, this is a very sexy beer...It's a hot blonde in a velvet dress, with a stiletto in her garter belt. The kind of woman, where after a night of unforgettable passion, you wake up in an ice filled bathtub missing a kidney...and spend the rest of your life wanting another night with her.

Behind that is some citrusy hops, caramel malt, and a bit of alcohol.  Taste has the same characteristics. Grapefruity hops up front, followed by a short burst of sweet caramel malt that gets taken over by the hops and oak. A touch of alcohol on the finish.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, nice soft carbonation.  It has been some time since I tried the regular Arrogant Bastard but I remember it being much different. The oak really adds a lot of complexity, but at the same time takes away from the spotlight a lot of the character that I liked about the regular.

A medium to full bodied American Strong Ale. The malts are caramel and fruity. The hops are grapefruity and floral. The oak flavors are mostly in the back end and the finish. Yeah it's double bastard and all that implies, but the oak aging has mellowed the beer a little, the oak and malts go well together here. Another beer that does very well as a live firkin ale.

Pours a deep mahogany hue, pretty clear, with a pretty smooth and foamy two inch head, leaving lacing on the glass in long streaks and blobs. Much hop is immediately present in the nose, the oak lending its influence, a hefty dosing of malt very much active.  Taste, mmmm... Its definitely of AB pedigree, but the oak aging settles it down a bit, providing some tannins and vanilla, the slightest hint of wood. I'm not going to say it has refined AB, but it seems a bit more complex, shady, more an enigma, if possible. The hops are hefty and well oiled, the mouth is hefty and lively, and the joy, its a great drinkin beer. Everything is quite excellent, perhaps just not exquisite.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,SilentSabre,4.15,"This was everything I thought it would be and more. The pour was a semi-cloudy dark red colour with a thick, tightly knit sand coloured head. Head was easily a finger and a half, perhaps two fingers thick and stayed in place for some time. It looked like something out of an ad, really. Smell was dominated by hops. Period. However, it was a sweet smell, and not sweet malt, though malt was present. The only other beer I can think of right off that had this powerful sweet hops smell is 3F's Dreadnaught. I have had several brews that had that, but only those two so assertively. Taste, too, is commanded by hops, with little noticeable malt (to me, I know it's there, though). This is certainly a brew for the hop lover. I'm not a huge American hops fan, but I still appreciate and enjoy this immensely. Mouthfeel is fairl heavy, but right where it needs to be IMO.

147,8951,Reagan1984,4.63,"After recently trying Arrogant Bastard for the first time I was excited to try this Oak Aged version. I was not disappointed.  Beautiful looking beer! Deep Red/Amber in color and extremely clear. No visible carbonation. A one finger head formed and then retreated to begin it's work at leaving lacing on the inside of my glass. It did a fine job and left plenty.  Aroma has a hop punch and some floral notes, but I really detect black cherry or some other fruit. I didn't look back but I think that I mentioned a tropical fruit note in the regular Arrogant Bastard. There seems to be more depth to this aroma and it may be the Oak aging.  Taste is just wonderful. Well balanced, a touch of vanilla but again I get the slightest cherry taste in the background. The nice hop flavor and bite remains but there is a new depth that I assume is added by the oak. In the finish you can sense more than just the hops. I'm not sure I would have pegged it as oak if I didn't know.  The beer is so smooth it's amazing. This, of course, leads to a supreme mouth feel and drinkability.  I have a new friend.

Taste: This is some delicious stuff, I don't pretend to taste all the singular notes that make up this brew, but the hops are there, right on point, there's definitely some chocolate, some dubbel like sweetness. Shit....IS GOOD...IS VERY GOOD!!  Mouthfeel: Rich and chewy, there's got to be a assload of malt in this one.

Head gre to three fingers thick and was light tan with good retention.  Smell: Unmistakeably hoppy, with more hop character shining through than the regular Bastard. Pine and somewhat citric notes come through at first, balanced by a semisweet and caramel malt smell.  Taste: Sweet at first, showing some bready and caramelly notes. After that the hops take over. Piney hops dominate here, and the finish is equally tree-like with evident woody oak flavors.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with low to moderate amounts of carbonation, but enough to show it's there. Smooth going down. Very nice.  Drinkability: Deceptively drinkable if you're a fan of hoppier beers. No cloying aspects to this brew.

My experience of OAKED Arrogant Bastard was pleasantly and surprisingly different.  The ale poured a deep amber red into my English Pint Pub glass, forming a good sized, rocky head that quickly dissipated. What little aroma there was brought to mind warm caramel, very malty. Taste is where this brew surprised me. In contrast to its sibling's smack you in the head assertiveness, OAKED Arrogant Bastard presents a well-blended sum of its substantial parts. A strong, caramel, malty backbone blends subtly with the hops. There is a faint undertone of oak that ties together the disparate parts in a chewy, dare I say smokey, harmony. For as strong an ale as this is, you certainly don't feel it. It might be better to call this a sneaky bastard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Also some caramel maltiness and a very subtle hint of vanilla. The taste is characterized by some sweetness up front, good hop bitterness, and then a super dry finish that leaves a bitterness in the back of my mouth for quite a while after I'm done. I haven't had the Arrogant Bastard, but I'm guessing the oak has something to do with the dryness.  The mouthfeel is very slick.

Sweet and somewhat smoky malts blend with hints of alcohol for a rather pleasant aroma. Reminds me a bit of a weaker smelling stout, but unlike most stouts, this one has some spiced resinous hops that come come through to the nose.  The oak flavor added to this one really comes through in the flavor and remains into the aftertaste. Not a huge fan of that flavor after a little while. Other that that, there is a pleasant balance between the sweet, smoky malts and the hops; the latter of which rides with the oak into the aftertaste.

D: This is a very good beer and I get the subtle differences between the original, but it's not my favorite representation of the style.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,BMoney575,4.3,"Sampled on 5-24-08  Pours a super cloudy orange/red color, with a filmy head and thin lacing.  Smell is very AB, with maybe a hint of oaky earthiness.  Taste is the standard combination of super malty and super hoppy, with a woody kick to mix it all up. The oak, vanilla, and wood-chip flavors are almost overwhelming, in a good way.  Mouthfeel is spot-on, thick and creamy.  Drinkability is good, but the oak flavor gets a little old after awhile.  Overall, a very, very good brew. The oak brings the AB craziness down a notch, and makes one of the most well-balanced extreme beers I've ever had.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,ASymon13,3.9,"This beer pours a very dark amber with a solid off-white head that leaves some nice lacing as it recedes. The oak on the nose is very nice. It isn't overpowering, as the sweet, bready malts come through nicely, as do some spicy hops.The oak almost seems to add hints of vanilla as well.  The oak does not come through immediately in the taste. It starts out similar to normal arrogant bastard, with the malts hitting you upfront and the bittering hops coming through strong. The finish though is what really distinguishes it. The oak really comes through on the finish and lingers nicely along with the alcohol. It has a nice medium mouthfeel, which fits nicely with the style, and the carbonation is appropriate, giving it a nice mouthfeel. It is definitely an enjoyable beer, but I'm not completely sure if it is worth the extra cost over the standard AB.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Deep leather brown sporting a creamy dollop of a tan head; translucent and can't see the level of carbonation  Smell Everything is blending nicely here, but not coming off in a big way (age?); there's some nice tart fruit--maybe even strawberries, which would be a first for me; I'd like a little more oak in the nose  Taste & Mouthfeel Immediately striking as a unique and tasty beer; it's full of hops and malts, with each balancing each other nicely; the oaking really pops at the end as vanilla suddenly appears after each sip--a nice touch; A.B. boasts a medium-to-thick body that feels smooth and creamy, with just enough carbonation and leaves a slight oily residue; a tad bit of alcohol heat in the finish, but it's not bad  Overall I was very impressed with my first Oaked Arrogant Bastard. It's strong in all areas, and I especially appreciate its color. Now I'm really eager to try regular A.B. It was a great break from all the uber-hopped beers of late as the malt and oak aging characteristics really shined on this one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

A nice hoppiness with citrus notes accompanied by some vanilla and a subtle maltiness.  Taste is nice. A strong maltiness and good hop profile. A bitter citrus quality is also present.  Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a perfect carbonation.  Drinkability is moderate. Alcohol is moderate, but flavor is fairly strong.

147,8951,cokes,4.23,"A shimmering deep-brown ruby liquid sits below a cathedral of buttercreme foam. This is absolutely gorgeous. Fragrances of orange rinds, lime, caramels, toffees, French perfume, pine cones, and pine sap. Oak adds a certain gusto to the tart lime characteristics, but it otherwise muted. Hops ruled the nose, but malt is not dispensed so easily in the mouth. Blanketing caramel, toffee, dough, and toast. It ventures towards walnuts, black cherry, and chocolate, but then the hops catch up. There's a flash in the transition that shows a buttery, soured vanilla oakiness, but it is again largely shut out. Hops bellow out full oranges, pine resin, lime leaves, and rose petals. The body is a rotund medium with a stunted but steady CO2 for lift. AB is the watermark for hop-focused (but balanced) strong ales. I don't really see the oak doing a lot here, but there are some nuances where it comes through. Regardless, it is delicious.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

The hoppy finish is floral with a limey citrus.  mouthfeel: medium carbonation and body, slightly oily and astringent on the finish  drinkablity: very nice flavor combined with a medium body tastes. very good drinkability  notes: I love this beer, the malt in this beer is so round and the hops clean up so nicely, it sits so nicely on the pallet at the end and the aftertaste is very enjoyable as well.

On the palate the malt & hops are surprisingly tamed by the oak influence. It's not regular bastard + oak here, it's more like oaky flavors with some suggestion of bastard, but otherwise you wouldn't necessarily know this is an AB.  Very drinkable due to the oak - rounds it out, some soft sweetness, chalk & vanilla come through (in a good way), and finish is balanced as well.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Modest, frothy caramel head, and Stone's trademark foamy layer on top.  S - Hoppy aroma, faint faint faint cherry, bourbon and oak.  T - There was a thread at BA today about ""gateway"" beers. I think a beer like this is more of a ""transcendent"" beer, where beer drinkers who enjoy the gateway stuff finally realize what a great beer tastes like. It gets a little sweet as it warms up.  M/D - Fabulous, bitter aftertaste. Smooth going in, neither syrupy or watery. Plenty of flavor in each sip.

Full rings of lace are left all along the sides of the glass. Such a visually appealing beer.  Aroma is a blend of floral, herbal, and citrus hops, some caramelized malts, and mild woodiness.  Well balanced and complex flavors. A quick dash of wood leads the way with caramel & citrus coming next. Strong hops step in and run the gamut of flavor - citrus, floral, herbal, mint, and pine. Not as strong of a bite as the original but more complex and developed. Juicy citrus shines with loads of grapefruit and orange. Malt sweetness comes in before a mild oaky finish.  Medium bodied, smooth and creamy. Just enough crispness and a perfect amount of carbonation for this beer. Just a delicious beer that goes down quite easily. My palate may get exhausted, but I could throw a few of these back. Much smoother than the original.  I really like this beer. Nice to have a wood aged beer that is not a stout or aged in a liquor barrel. The oak is perfect with this beer, does not overpower and adds some mellowness and complexity. Great beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

A: The beer is a deep reddish brown color, with a short off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is a nice mix of floral hops, caramelized malts and some citrus.  T: The taste is very well-balanced with flavors of caramel & citrus sweetness and a strong hops presence, which seems slightly toned down compared to the regular Arrogant Bastard. There's a nice hearty malt backbone. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.  M: Crisp and a little smoother than the original Arrogant Bastard, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean.  D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, nice kick, I always have high expectations for Stone beers and they have yet to disappoint me, with this beer I was very interested to see what difference the oak aging would make on an already great beer.

Hazy brown with a relentless beige head that hangs in for a while before receding into a sticky lacing that fuses to the sides of my glass.  Strong aroma of malty caramel and bitter herbal grassy hops. Can't get any wood/oak aromas, even when i'm looking for it, or when it warmed up.  Taste is complex, moreso than the regular AB. Huge mound of strong hops stacked in a pile up against aw all of malt. Fruity esthers and an alcohol presence that hides among. I'm tasting a woody sap and tree bark that must be coming from the oak aging.  Oily hop resin and a bit of a cloying mouthfeel.I like big IPA's, but this is not as drinkable as I would like.

S- Sweet malt, grapefruit, oak, some pine. Mostly I get some candied citrus, caramel, and oak. Not too shabby... actually, quite a quaffer.  T- Hmm... the first thing to hit me is a strong wood chip taste, then the sweet malt and hoppy fruitiness kick in. Not really the kind of oak aging that I appreciate I guess.  M- Definitely smoother than the regular Arrogant Bastard. Very dry aftertaste, but pretty nice and creamy in the mouth.

Smell is subtle but inviting.  Very, very good beer. The aftertaste of oak is strong on the back of the throat & reminds me strongly of oak-aged wine we tried out in Sonoma Valley last spring. Everything is nicely balanced. The only operative word here is smoooth. Stone should sue Bud the next time they use the word.  Feels nice in the nasal passages & goes down easily. Yum!

147,8951,Big78CJ,4.45,"This is a fine looking beer with a dark reddish brown body and orangey-auburn highlights around the edge of the glass. Thick, pillowy, off-white form sits on top of the beer, lingering briefly with minimal lacing. Smell is of ruby red grapefruits and oranges, with just enough sweetness to cut the edge of the citrusy hop. Malt presence is also noted in the smell as it blends with a touch of vanilla from the oak aging.  The flavor is a complex array of citrusy fruits like red grapefruit and oranges. There also appears to be a lighter watermelon or grape taste as well. As the fresh fruit flavor subsides, more intense hop bite takes over. Slightly metallic alcoholic notes start to warm the chest after several sips. The malt backbone and lingering hop presence lend significant texture to the beer.  I am very glad I picked up another sixer in Colorado as this is a damn tasty beer. I intend to age some of the other bottles and see how they turn out as well.

It poured a dark ruby/brown color with a slightly off white small head. The head dropped off to a thin film which stayed throughout and left an average amount of lacing.  Smelled of malts and hops, with some pine and a small alcohol presence.  Tasted of hops, with nary a sign of the pine that I detected in the scent. I was a bit surprised how one dimensional this beer tasted. No complexity at all, at least to my taste buds.  Mouthfeel was slightly thick and flat. Really was quite disappointed in this department.  Overall this was to me, an average beer at best. My review for the Double Bastard was well below the ""average"", and I'm sure this one will be as well. I just didn't get much enjoyment out of this beer. Adding to that, it's about twice as expensive as their ""regular"" Bastard, so I'd have to say I found it to be one of the worst ""bang for the buck' beers I've had in a long time.

However the hop smell is not as intense and is accompanied by a subtle malt sweetness that wasn't quite as apparent before. I also get some caramel and definitely some baking vanilla from the wood.  Tastes smoooth. Definitely smoother and silkier than the non-oaked version. The fresh, astringent hoppiness is replaced by a slightly bourbon-esque bitterness mixed with vanilla notes and alcohol dryness.  Its full of unique flavors and is a drinking experience unlike most others.

Malts do swing toward the sweet side with the oak properties pulling through mostly towards the end of the tasting (and as the beer warms). Alcohol presence hidden initially, but tends to present long after the taste.  Mouthfeel: Ultra-smooth with an above average body.

Appearance: Deep, dark red, opaque, almost stout-like in its quality, but tinged a deep crimson. Thick off-white head that leaves significant lacing. Highly enticing.  Smell: Sweet, hints of cherries, but with a strong hoppiness. The oak is very present here, overpowering the more subtle aromas. Still, it helps the sweetness of the overall scent and makes this a different experience from the original.  Taste: It's like drinking an apple tree. No, seriously. Strong fruit overtones, mostly apples but with a touch of citrus, following closely by the oaky undertones (hence the branches) and finishing with that hop bite (the leaves). It has the kind of woodsy flavor that I associate with cider, but this tastes like no cider you can imagine. It's a big off-putting at first, but... what the hell? It's fucking Stone, right? It grows on my palate quickly, just like all the other Stone beers.  Mouthfeel: Magnificent, as always with Stone. Thick, amazingly so. Like liquid bread. The hops are more subdued than in the normal Bastard, making this go down clean and easy.  Drinkability: It takes a minute to get used to, but this might go down even more easily than Arrogant Bastard. The oak helps to balance the other flavors, and while I don't think this is quite as good as the original beer, I'd definitely like to keep a few of these on-hand for the occasional taste.

Smell is nice, though not very strong. Cracker malt, pine hops, floral hops, a bit of hay and grass. The oak is definitely there.  Taste is like the smell, although in reverse order. The hops hit first, then the malt, and then the oak vanillins come on good and strong. The oak is what saves this from being an altogether mediocre tasting beer.  Mouthfeel is enriched by the oak-chip smoothness. Nice and round. Good soft carbonation.  Drinkability -- what can I say? It's west coast beer, which means the hop-load is way out of line with the style. I couldn't have more than one of these, because the complexity of the malt and oak-chip flavors are simply smashed by the over hopping. Stone has done it again: taken what might have been a really good beer and made it average by overhopping it. Somebody tell me why Stone's beers all taste like a variation on an IPA! Somebody else tell me what the attraction to Stone beers might be.  Better than the regular Arrogant Bastard, which is just one dimensionally hop-dominated. At least this has the vanilla flavors of the oak to save it from totally mediocrity.

It smelled very similar too, with lots of warm citrus hops mixed with caramel malt. It tasted the same at first, with the strong orange and pine hops blended with caramel malt, but it also had a noticeable oak flavor blended in. It felt about the same as the original, watery with slight carbonation, and a smooth clean aftertaste with strong bitterness (and oak).

Some raisins, roasted malt sweetness, followed by the familiar Bastard Ale bitterness and the oak character coming through. I really like the regular Bastard Ale, but I think this is even better.

Mouthfeel: Full bodied but very smooth, the alcohol was hidden quite well but I felt the effects the further along I got. The carbonation was light, and with all the flavors that fit nicely.  Overall: I didn't realize until after I poured that it was past the best before date, and if it had came out badly I wasn't going to review it. But even with the date it was still quite tasty.

The hops are tempered while the wood sugars provide added depth of flavor and balance the lingering dry, bitter finish. A lot of American Strong's have a kitchen sink feel and come off a bit amateurish, but this is clearly a finely crafted beer.  Mouthfeel is smooth and oily, soft and lighter bodied, very nice.  Drinkability is rather high, although the complexity begs savoring, not slamming. Definitely better then original Arrogant Bastard IMHO, I'm not sure why I let this sit in the back of my cellar for so long before busting it out tonight, a few months old served at cellar temp.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,n1ckels,3.12,"First impression: Is this Kool-Aid? Damn, this beer looks red and clear, you'd almost think it was a wine cooler.  Smell: Ok, I think I've nailed it: fresh cut lumber. Yes, this beer smells like sawdust, Home Depot, and all the good memories you have from your days with a circular saw.  Taste: I almost grimaced at first, because it was so oaky and bitter, it really cuts your tongue. You wonder for a second if you just put varnish or turpentine in your mouth. The more you drink it, the more pronounced the oakiness becomes, and the beer cuts less.  This beer is one of the most unique I've ever come across. It is so oily, it really looks like a wine or some sort of wood stain. If you've ever wondered what wine afficionados mean when they note a wine as being ""oaky"", look no further. This beer is like the crazy uncle of the tamer wood product- maple syrup.  I paid $15.99 for a six pack. Yes, cheaper than a bar, but still a costly endeavor.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,enfield249,3.41,"A - Pours a clear deep reddish brown with 1 fingers worth of light tan head.  S - Not getting much off this. Slight malt maybe.  T - First I get a nice clean flavor, hard to believe. Then some good roast and malt followed up by hoppy finish. I don't get any alcohol from this, which is surprising.  M - Full and slightly astringent.  D - A bit much for daily drinking, and I don't really taste much if any oak. Worth a try, but not anything supper special.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,CrellMoset,4.13,"UPDATE: 01/08/08, bottle courtesy of a friend, poured into a cervoise.  It's been a year or so of reviews later, so I thought I'd revisit an old favorite. It's still a great looking beer, nicely colored, with a gorgeous, fluffy, creamy head with great retention and lacing. I'm gonna knock both the aroma and the taste down half a point - they're still both pleasantly complex and well-balanced, with notes of plums, cherries, spice, vanilla, and wood in addition to the regular array of Arrogant Bastard notes, but I'm just slightly less impressed with them at this point. The mouthfeel is still exceptional - silky and velvety, creamy and smooth. All in all, still a great beer, though just not QUITE as great as I remember it.  *** Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance: Similar to the regular ABA, perhaps slightly darker. It's a deep mahogany with a rip-roarin', gorgeous head with great retention, sticky lacing, and slow, lazy carbonation. It's picturesque, but since I know what's coming, I can't stare at it for too long.  Smell: Alcohol, oily, bitter hops - pretty much every hop note in the book, too, with pleasant herbal/earthy notes mingling with tart citrus, fruity notes intertwined with woody/piney notes and spices, cinnamon, vanilla - and a nice, sweet, fruity presence play over a grainy, earthy background. Incredibly strong smelling.  Taste: Cinnamon, vanilla, plums and other sweet fruits, minty, juniper-berry wood notes, piney hop bitterness, citric explosions of orange and grapefruit, a sweet, toasty, caramel and toffee backbone - I counted no less than 10 distinct tasting notes in this beer. I'm really dazzled by it. My friend pointed out that in most of the cases, these tasting notes are more than artificial - you're not getting just the cinnamaldehyde, or the vanillin, but the entire flavor experience. It's not artificial tasting at all. It's just plain fantastic.  Mouthfeel: As creamy and luscious as I remember it being, a sheer delight on the tongue.  Drinkability: High alcohol content, and it's a ridiculously sweet and complex beer, so I don't feel safe giving it higher than a 4.0. The addition of the oak does cut down on some of the astringent qualities present in the original ABA, but honestly, I'm afraid too much of this beer might give me a sensory overload.  An improvement over the regular ABA, if I could have imagined such a thing being possible. A true ""beer experience,"" but again, not for the faint of heart. This is a very complex sipping beer, to be savored and enjoyed in a relaxed environment. So grab your favorite snifter, that velvet smoking jacket you've been looking for an excuse to wear, and take a load off - this beer's that good.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,tmitch75,4.5,"This came in an awesome 12 oz silkscreened bottle. I don't know what it costs to silkscreen instead of use a typical label, but it sure looks cool. Especially with Stone's whole gargoyle thing.  Pours a beautiful mahogany color with a reddish tint and a slight head.  Has a sweet smell with floral hops which are strong but not too strong, with a little oaky smell and a hint of vanilla.  Tastes resinous with an oily citrus hop flavor. There is also a toffee/caramel sweetness, and a woody finish that adds vanilla and a light smoke flavor. Very complex and tasty.  The body is full and oily with a dry finish.  This is an awesome and complex beer. I wasn't sure about the concept of messing with Arrogant Bastard (I've only tried a couple of times and loved it), but the oaky flavor is a positive addition. Very smooth. I agree with the bottle... I'm not worthy.  Tasted on 3/8/08.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Tdizzle,4.4,"A- Poured into an imperial pint glass, this beer pours a clear deep amber color with a thick tan head that settles to a thin layer, leaving minimal spotty lacing on the glass.  S- Sweet malts, oak, and dark fruits with some hops in the background. Carmel and toffee come out as the beer warms.  T- Big malty sweetness at first with a nice woody flavor from the oak chips. The pronounced bitterness kicks in shortly after.  M- Thick and slightly coating with little carbonation.  D- The oak flavor actually makes this more drinkable than the regular Arrogant Bastard Ale. It sort of cuts that brash quality that the original Bastard posseses. Both beers are great, but I prefer this one over the other. At 7.2%, this isn't really sessionable and the rich flavor profile makes this a beer that I would only want a couple of in a night. The oak flavor never gets boring though.  One of my favorite beers.

Threw it in at the end instead of a Philly Pale and very glad I did. Amber color, not a lot of head, but a big hoppy/oaky nose and a full mouth. This is a big beer with mucho character. A touch dry, but this did not take away from its delivery. Because of its bigness and its 7.2%, not an ideal session beer. Definitely a new regular though.

Fairly strong alcohol taste, but I always enjoy a little of that. The hops are good, floral and pleasant. I can taste the presence of the oak aging. I would like to a side-by-side with this and the regular ABA.  I've always thought that aging was nice but not really worth the price. This one might be an exception. It's quite nice.

Can't quite pick anything out of the nose or from the taste. Taste is relatively complex. Very well balanced between the malts and the hops. It's definitely not as hoppy as I though it would be.

A bit fruity in the nose, with some sweeter overtones. Not as much hoppiness as I was expecting, but it wasn't overbearing, which is a plus. Had some overtones that reminded me of baker's chocolate, as well as some smokiness. The body was a bit more on the heavy side, and there was a bit too much carbonation.

147,8951,blakesell,3.75,"Beer is from the first time Oaked Bastard was made into 6 packs. Severely limited at the time and bottle is probably about 2 years old. Poured from 120z bottle into a Belgian Tulip.  Appearance- Pours an amber brown with a 1.5 finger head of splotchy foam. Red hues shine through the light. Lacing is virtually not there.  Smell- Cascade and Centennial hops. Big oak and thick 60 lovibond toasted malts coming to a toffee-like center with more over the top hoppiness in the finish.  Taste- Malt and oak sweetness with a big hoppy smash coming in later as if hit with a rubber mallet. Oak lingers giving vanilla and cashew tones with more lingering walnuts and bitterness.  Mouthfeel- Big carbonation and thick mouthfeel. Overly cloying with hops. Somewhat warming and sticky.  Drinkability- Not greatly drinkable. There was once a time when I could go to a bar and drink nothing but the bastard, but I think time has run it's course on me and no longer will the bastard set me free.

147,8951,toolbrew,4.2,"It poured a nice foamy light-brown head. The color is a brown/deep-red cloudy beer. Not necessarily inviting, but also not for the light-hearted.  Malty scent but I can't quite place it between smoky/woodsy. The hops are aromatic and fruity/citrusy.  Definately that fruity taste turning into a hoppy/bitter finish.  Heavy taste but overall good mouthfeel. You can feel the higher ABV.  Not difficult to drink a few of these. I remember when I worked at a restaurant that had this on tap (briefly). People who didn't like the regular ABA loved the Oaked ABA. It took some of that initial harshness out of the beer. Both beers are great though.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

There was a good bit of lacing on the inside of the glass. The aroma was nice and woody along with a fresh pinch of hops. The oak chips do a wonderful job of drying out the initial A.B.

A: An aggressive pour resulted in a body that was somewhere between a bright rich copper and brick orange and a massive white head. The head was dense and sticky and receded slowly to a even cover over the liquid and fed a layered even curtain of lace.  S: The aroma was rich with the smell of sweet toasted malts, vanilla, and woody smoked earthy oak.  T: It tasted of sweet toasted malts, spices,t caramel, complex citrus and bitter profiles and smoky and woody flavors. The brew benefited from a rest before consuming allowing some of the sharpness of the hops to smooth out and blend in with the malts and oak flavors.  M: It was medium bodied with a nice sweet malt base complemented by bitter and floral hops and a very clean finish that resulted in a nearly dry and clean aftertaste.  D: Very pleasant brew with a complex and varied taste, outstanding appearance, and excellent mouth feel.

Medium carbonation. The color is very rich and enticing.  The smell is one of a kind. A Smokey Coffee scent. More like a porter. Earthy, like one would expect from a single malt scotch. Nothing else like it in the beer world.  Taste is also very unique. Similar to Arrogant Bastard (unoaked). Except a bit more balanced due to the woody/oak flavor. I'm not sure the taste is better than AB, just different. You can taste the alcohol and a bit of extra bitterness in the finish.  This feels thick and has a very dry finish.

Smells very strongly of hops, some orange/grapefruit notes and, yes, wood. Flavors of citric grapefruit, pine-nut, and a dry oak. The yeast makes itself known, as does a distinctive hop bite. The malts kick in by the end as to not allow the hops to steal the show. There is alot going on in this brew. It stays very lively in the mouth, allowing the distinctive flavors to power themselves around. Leaves a puckering tangyness which throbs the lower mouth & gums after swallowing. Drinkability, as with the traditional ABA, depends on one's tolerance for hops malt & yeast which knock you over the head with their presence.

S - Bitter citrus notes w/ a light vanilla, woody aroma that has subtle smoke and plenty of oak odors. Slight candied malt scents are subdued beneath the big woody nose.  M - Big malty smoothness w/ dry oaky nuttiness and big NW hops adding piney sharpness.  T - Huge woody flavor w/ smoky toast notes and subtle fruity sweetness w/ caramel malt and a pine bite w/ citrus flavored hops. Fruit is cherry and fig-like w/ spicy nutmeg and clove notes. There are gentle hints of caramelized brown sugar and toffee rounding out the vast complexities in this extreme ale.  D - A boozy and intensely oak flavored ale, bery tasty w/ plenty of hops and flavor, yet not the most drinkable beer for my taste. This was paired w/ a salad my brother made w/ tons of ginger and lime w/ cilantro and scotch bonnets. There was also a garlic aioli w/ raw egg dijon mustard and chives with redskin roasted potatos- which was even more intense when paired w/ this ale.

Its not too thick or think, the carbonation is nice (a bit mild which works well). Drinkability is hard for me to judge because its such an unusual beer style. I could go for a few of these, but I really like strong flavors. Its not too alcoholic, in fact its quite drinkable for the ABV.  Again, I really like this beer.

147,8951,jmalex,3.61,"It's been a while since I've had this so today's review will be just like I'm having it for the first time.  APPEARANCE: Pours into a Sam Adams glass a brownish amber with some orange hues to it. The head starts at 1-2 fingers and drops eventually to a massive collar and a hazy and full surface of foam. Rings of lacing mark the sizes of my swallows all the way down the glass.  SMELL: The nose is strong on the familiar piny, herbal, and slightly citrusy and resinous Arrogant Bastard hop profile. Some oak and vanilla do make it through, though in lighter amounts. A bready malt base backs everything up and balances the beer out.  TASTE: The taste is surprisingly mild on the flavor of the hops and sweetness of malt, but it's made up for in the strength of the oak flavors. It lasts from nearly the start through the entire finish. The hops outshine the malt by a pretty decent margin, though I wish both were amped up a bit more as the emptiness that they give the beer makes me want more. As it is with the piny hops and the woody oak flavors, it's a Christmas tree in a glass.  MOUTHFEEL: Could this possibly be too thin? I don't know if I've grown accustomed to bigger beers so much that this seems like it could be beefed up considerably. The lightness is a little refreshing though even if the beer is slightly syrupy. Carbonation is only slightly higher than average and is where it should be.  DRINKABILITY: It certainly does well here. As far as wood-aged beers go, this is one of the more easy drinkers that I've had. I have always wondered why this doesn't come in bombers. There are many of Stone's beers that are harder to get through than this one.  Okay, it's a nice beer and fun to compare to the original. Definitely recommended to try, but for me it probably won't repeat in my fridge too often - especially for the price.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Light head that leaves lacing in small bunches.  Smell: Smells like a fresh batch of hops that were ground onto a piece of newly cut oak. The smell is very exciting.  Taste: Very interesting. You get the taste of the original Arrogant Bastard with it's pungent and excessive (in a good way) hops and malt notes, but the oak adds a new depth to it with it's obvious woody taste. It makes it harsher and milder at the same time. Unfortunately, I did not get the taste of any of the sweeter intricacies, even as it warmed.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is on the low/medium which makes it very easy to both drink and appreciate the quality of the beer.  Drinkablility: I managed to handle only a few of these before it was just too much (which was probably for the best).

Minus the hops, and it reminds me of a scotch I once had, whose name escapes me right now.  Taste is more sweet caramel and wood. Hints of pine and honey round out the backside of the swirl in my mouth.  This really reminds me of a scotch, very tame and mellow mouthfeel. Creamy and medium bodied.

147,8951,pwoods,4.62,"12oz. brown bottle, purchased at Dilly Deli, poured into a pint.  A: Pours a deep rusty orangish brown that's completely murky. 1 finger of light caramel head forms and holds on. Some Patchy lacing.  S: Great juicy hops with a piny resin. Sweet caramel malts with a delicious smelling oak/vanilla combo. They're not joking when they say Oaked.  T/M: Hop bitterness is there but held in check by the strong, sweet malts. More citrus and hoppy resin but with an added pepper spice. The oakiness is probably the best I've tasted and the vanilla side adds a natural sweetness. Body is a bit above medium with controlled carbonation. Finish is a little long with only a bit of drying.  D: I could probably drink this until I couldn't stand.

Pours a murky amber color with a small off-color head, for the amount of head there, it sure left enough lacing.  Strong piney hop aroma, slight citrus edge, caramel malt present but hidden way in the back.

Oak aging hasn't drastically altered the taste, but it does add even more depth of flavor and makes it much smoother, less raw.  m: Appropriate carbonation, medium body, not at sticky or chewy as the regular version, but creamier and smoother.  d: More drinkable than its oak-free counterpart.

Crisp mouthfeel, clean finish.  I am not a huge fan of oak in my beer unless it is a bourbon barrel so this one was a tad hard for me to drink as i tasted no bourbon at all, just wood and hops, but for what it is, it is okay. i wouldnt choose to drink it again over all the other choices though.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

I fear that the oak flavoring has changed this to some strange hop-flavored bourbon stuff. All I could taste was bourbon. I don't like bourbon at all, so maybe that's why I was disappointed.

I really tasted the oak and maltiness which was really powerful... It hits the back of my throat and was slightly carbonated. Enjoyable beer but I was questioning how tough I was and if I could handle their offering. To me it was similar to sipping a nice tumbler of Kentucky whiskey.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

S: Oaky scene come through... a nice addition to the full hoppy aromas. A little bit of an earthy, somewhat musky smell in there. Some slightly sweet notes follow through at the very end.  T: Rich, bitter hops. The oak aging has done its part to add flavour and intensifies the flavour, and an incredibly full flavour it is. A bit of a kick in the ass, and not for the faint hearted.  M & D: Weighty, yet still wet... a combination few get right. The bitter body makes for a bit of a slow drink, but the have done well balancing something so intense. Not for any sort of crazy consumption, but that kinda seems to be intentional. This isn't to be treated like a bad macro on a summer day.

A: Thick tan head on top of a cloudy dull brown body, very interesting looking, it quickly mellowed to a thin film.  S: I can smell a lot of hops, very citrusy, a little pine.  T: The hops are really about all I can taste in this, with a hint of the oak aging, pretty unbalanced, but I do like the bitterness at the end. Pretty strong alcohol taste throughout. A little dissapointing in general though.  M: Was pretty thin and crisp in the mouth, with a good bite and a relatively dry finish, definitely interesting.  D: I had one, and it was enough, I enjoyed it, but not nearly as much as I thought I would.

This should be interesting. At first the flavour isn't as bitter as I expected, and I can taste tobacco leaves amongst a smooth vanilla-caramel sweetness. Then the pine and citrus flavours kick in, bringing a good deal of oak along for the ride, before tailing off into a pleasing bitterness. The body is medium, extremely smooth, and delicious.

Head stuck around quite a while and a beautiful web of lace lined the glass.  Smell: Very complex. Citrus scents (grapefruit, orange, mango, and maybe some pineapple) blend with rich caramel malts and give it a very sweet aroma. Hops are big and piney. To my surprise it does have a bit of a wood chip smell in there.  Taste: Very malty and sweet up front. Citrus flavors add to the mix, but aren't quite as pronounced in taste. Hops are piney and bitter. It actually balances pretty well. The wood chip or oak is noticeable, but it only adds to its distinctive character.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied. Carbonation level is excellent. At 7.2%, it's a little on the heavier side, but extremely smooth and drinkable.

Full and thick head on the pour, but it falls down to a half-inch-thick layer that sticks. The head is off-white to tan in color, kinda frothy. S: Full of hearty malt scents and an underlying hop smell as well. The first whiff was almost overwhelming. Takes me a few whiffs to figure out whats there. Theres definitely some chocolate, caramel, citrus hops, berries. If I try to ignore the heavy malts, I get a nose-filling and airy but pungent bourbon smell. Maybe some sweet scents too, like honey? T: Smooth and sweet malts, caramels and fruit lead the way. Gives way to a soft malty taste that is backed by a little hop taste, something floral and almost citrusy. Finish is creamy and smooth almost sweet, but then the lingering taste is a bit of alcohol. Overall, it is indeed complex and powerful, very flavorful, but not overwhelmingly so, and it does leave me wanting another mouthful to taste and explore. M: Full bodied and mouth-filling, definitely. Sweet, bitter, and malty all at once. Noticeable alcohol presence, especially in the finish. D: Kinda tough, to be sure, but the taste does leave me wanting more, and that counts for something.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,deapokid,4.61,"Distinct and totally original, this Oaked Arrogant Bastard takes the balls out flavor of the traditional model and ups the ante ten fold.  Taking on a hoppy aroma and amber color, this tough guy has a soft white head with uber-thick lace and a big bubbly flavor.  Even with woody undercurrents, this ale was surprisingly smooth and tasty - even a bit fruity.  With all this flavor and distinction, it's no surprise that Stone decided to make this a wide release and not leave it sequestered to West Coast pubs and eateries.  *Update from 2/21/2010:  I wish I had elaborated on this one a bit more the first time around. On the umpteenth try, this beer's smoky and deep woody finish is so smooth and subtle that the sweet amber notes are often easy to overlook.  This is an ale of such magnitude that it's nearly impossible to comprehend all of the complex flavors at once.

Great aroma with sweet, spicy, citrus hops blending marvelously with vanilla and oak. Overall a smooth aroma, if one can describe smells such.  I wasn't sure going in how aggressive, bitter hoppiness would mix with oak, but it is genius. The flavor is once again quite smooth with sweetness, oak and then hop flavors. This finishes with a building, still aggressive hop bitterness. Taste is rich and complex, somewhat like a hopped up scotch.

Aroma of caramel, brown sugar, citrusy hops, sweet malts, and a light oakiness.  The taste is lightly sweet a perfect balance of sharp hops and malts with plenty of caramel and citrus notes. The alcohol is present but well-hidden.  Medium mouthfeel, smooth and lightly carbonated.  What a terrific beer!

147,8951,Traquairlover,4.67,"12-oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  A = Reddish brown with good clarity, formed a small light tan head of small and medium bubbles which dissipated leaving good lacing, light but steady carbonation with small bubbles.  S = Very complex nose. I get floral, piney hops scents, together with an almost honey sweetness, and slight smokey odors which are probably coming from the oak chips. This is an exceptional nose, it smells like an IPA to which much more has been added.  T = Very satisfying taste which doesn't quite keep up with the smell, but comes close. There is a very sweet smokey malted flavor, but the bitterness of the hops is there the whole time cutting through it and carrying with it some citrusy lemon flavors through mid-palate and into the finish which is long and slightly, but not overpoweringly, bitter. I like this better than the unoaked Arrogant Bastard which is a very good beer. The complexities are great and well balanced.  M = Medium body, with light, almost foamy carbonation, leaves a good mouth coating that really aids the entire taste experience but especially the finish.  D = This is very drinkable. The only problem may be stopping yourself before having too much given the ABV.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Tilley4,4.57,Loved this baby. Quite a bit more than the regular AB.  Nice reddish brown murky pour with a decent head and lacing and awesome aroma of hops and earth. I think the oak adds what I thought was missing in the original. Some smokiness.  This tastes awesome. Hoppy as hell with a wonderful earthiness and maltiness lingering around in the background. I wish I could get this around my area.  All that is left is the Double Bastard and I just received a bottle in a trade yesterday so I'm trying it next.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,lightindarkness,4.26,"12 oz of goodness  A terrific looking pour - 2 inches of frothy head stick atop a hazed reddish brown with good copper color coming through in the light. Also in the light, some larger carbonation bubbles rise slowly but consistently from around the glass.  Smells of malt, bright and clean. Hits with rich roasted grains and light caramel, along with some smooth coconut milk and very faint zestiness of lemongrass.  Taste is very satisfying and unique, with a dominant flat middle tone of grain and lighter malts that spreads to a balance of richness and brighter bitter flavors throughout the sip. Rich woody tannins play on the tongue adding to the hop bitterness but with a much more raw grab on the palate. Supported by a wash of light caramel it finishes with some wood, earthy root, strong roasted grains, and herb. Not notably sweet, but just enough so to hold the balance.  Lingers in the mouth with a slight oily feel and some mild astringency. Leaves a lightly sticky hold. Overall very nicely balanced between bitter and full in a well bodied, full flavored brew. Carbonation is good for taste and body. A pleasing beer with good drinkability.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,wagenvolks,3.67,"As an aside, the first time I reviewed Oaked ABA, 12/1/2006, I was a both inebriated and inexperienced with the review process  Overall: B 3.65; A-4.5 S-4.0 T-3.5 M-2.5 D-3.0  Hopefully, it will impress me a bit more this time around.  12 oz. bottle pours a hazy, brownish amber body with a khaki head that retreats to a large patch of bubbles and a foam ring. Good retention & lacing. The aroma is very good: a blend of a wildflowers, orange zest, cedar resin, and gobs of caramel malt.  Now, I immensely enjoy the taste of both Arrogant and Double Bastard Ale (I also enjoy alot of oak-aged beers). But the oaken notes in this brew just don't do that much for me. Sure, it's big and bold and complex as hell, but it doesn't hold a flame to the enjoyable Double/ArrogantB Ales. Nevertheless, the oak does add some bitter, vanilla, palate-busting enjoyment to the usual malty, caramel, hop-rich taste of the Arrogant family. However, the blend is just too disparate for my liking. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than ABA, but the hops and oak seem to compete to ""out-bitter"" each other on the finish.  So where does that leave me? About the same as my original assessment, surprisingly. Complexity and flavor-changes? You betcha. Drinkable brew?

Initial taste is pungent raisins and prunes, and an earthy, woody flavour. Initial mouthfeel is medium bodied with an astringent edge, and a soft carbonation. Bitterness is very strongly balanced initially, and explodes in the finish with a long, drying aftertaste. Take 2 brings out some coffee-like aromas and a graininess. Still very astringent in the mouth but from floral hoppiness comes through with a grapefruitiness. No question, this is a big flavourful beer, and challenging to say the least.

Dark brown with multiple reddish highlights, it is capped by a nice, creamy and thick light tan head that unfortunately goes down quite fast, leaving only a thin collar but some lacing. Aroma is pleasant, hoppy as expected, mostly pines, but it also has a caramel, malty aroma that if it does not come all the way to forefront, it stays in the back all the time providing a nice balance. There might also be some woodiness and vanilla in the background, although that is minimal. Full bodied, it is hoppy and bitter as expected, piney again, with the same caramelized malty notes, along with some definite woodiness. Well balanced, it is a very good brew, but not fantastic.

While it is an excellent beer its not quite as exciting as I had hoped for....but my expectations for a stronger taste of the wood aging may have been misplaced.  I havent tried Arrogant Bastard so I cant differentiate the oak from what it was otherwise. Not too much head from the beer, but a healthy dose of hops (while strong, hops are far toned down from Stone IPA....which is a great beer...with the less hops it is quite a lot more drinkable, which while making for pleasant drinking, quite painful at $16/six-pack where i saw it.  Overall, an excellent beer but i dont think that i would pony up the additional $10/sixpack if it was sitting next to Stone IPA on the shelf.  Beer is deceptively smooth (I'm really not noticing that its 7.2% abv, which while I am used to that, it seems to be disappearing quite quickly (so yes, i like it!....just not quite what i expected, which was a heck of a lot).

Nice lacing as I drank it. Looks good.  At first I could smell the woody, barrel aromas. Some whiffs of alcohol. Mostly very sweet.  The taste disappointed me some. It was quite oakish and woody, which was stronger than I expected, and this really accentuated the bitterness at the end. It was complemented by a black licorice flavor that was OK.

Appearance was exceptional ruby-red to light brown with a frothy head smell was somewhat bland  more so than I had expected for a beer of this quality and reputation, and the drinkability was limited by its hefty alcohol percentage otherwise, an all-around outstanding brew that certainly warrants recognition enjoyed this one Recommended",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Flavor: Carmel and citrus peel. Slightly metallic but blends well with the hop and malt profile. A pleasant background earthiness that I assume is from the oak. Very subtle and understated. Pleasant bready and grainy notes emerge as the beer warms. Finish is bitter, crisp, and dry.  Mouthfeel: Medium-full bodied, slightly oily, and medium carbonation.  Overall impression: A lightly oaked, highly hopped, American strong ale (I say barleywine but I defer to the brewer). One of the better oaked beers as it adds character and does not overpower the beer. Worth a shot once but for the price, it probably won't be in my regular rotation.

Can still smell that classic arrogant hop smell, but also a thin creamy smell and just a hint of the oak. The taste follows the nose. Good hop flavors through the first taste. Then a creamy oaky, with slight vanilla taste in the middle. Then hop layers abound and the finish has some hop bitterness, but nothing like arrogant bastard. I the oak hit this bastard over the head. Nowhere near as savage as the original, but in my opinion better. The abv is very well hidden, and the oak adds a nice new layer of flavor.

147,8951,seaoflament,4.37,"Pours a muddy brown color with very little head, probably still too cold.  Aromas of caramel, citrus, ripe orange, toasted bread, hints of wood and sweet fruits. I also pick up some earthy notes and flower petals.  Taste of wood and vanilla upfront with a great combination of caramel and bread. A bit of citrus hops and some more earthy flavors. Dates, figs, prunes and a bit of smoke as well.  Well carbonated and pretty easy to drink but it's not a type of beer I would drink all night, but great on a cold day/night.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Nose was a complex mix of malty sweet oak and some citrus hops, with a hint of alcohol sneaking in late in the glass. Mouthfeel was tingly and the taste leaned more to the malt side than the hops. Finish was long and pleasant, but while this was a good beer, Im much more a fan of the non-oaked, hop dominant version of this beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Taste: A little bit of smokiness, pine, coconut, malty sweetness, citrus. Alcohol is tasted and felt (hot). It has a long bitter finish. Layers of flavours. It is complex & I am having a bit of trouble accurately describing it in further detail.  Mouthfeel: Fine carbonation, in lower than average volumes. Medium bodied.  Overall, it's a great Beer, but I have my suspicions that this is not just the regular Arrogant Bastard Ale that has been aged with oak chips, but that they tweaked the recipe a smidge first.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,HotterThanHell,4.55,"This has to be one of the great american beers. Not the ones with the commercials showing their medals for best american pale yellow light with no head pilsner, but real beers.  Color is a beautiful red/brown haze with a wonderful tan head that didn't fade and laced as I drank it down.  The aroma is probably the most earthly I can remember, with some piny hops, and a hint spicy citrus. It really reminded me of walking with the woods.  The taste is a wonderfully balanced molasses burning on a camp fire, sprinkled with hops and finishing with just the slightest hint of alchohol.  High alchohol, so be careful, but 3 or 4 shouldn't be too much trouble.  Overall, an excellent/superior beer that I highly recommend.

147,8951,letsgopens,4.26,"This oaked ASA pours a really atractive woody, ruby cedar with a tight kakai head. The foam holds well and leaves some good sagging lace. A really impressive looking beer. The appearance might even create the illusion of, or cause me to perceive more of that oak character. Beats me, but I did seem pick up a lot more of it than than others I sampled it with. Mainly I think, because many people are searching for that sometimes harsher bourbon barrel aged flavor. But that is nowhere to be found in this brew (and that is certainly not a bad thing).  The aroma is largely of caramel malt and some very nice spicy hops. There is a bit of an oak related vanilla note as well. Burnt sugar and molasses provide a great deal of sweetness. The oak character is more earthy and rustic than bourbon barrel. Attractive and pungent nonetheless.  Initially there is earthy burnt caramel malt and lots of those deep, piny, hops. Some citrus is detectable too. Boisterous but not harsh. A hint of faint smoke that could probably be mistaken for some really heavily caramelized/burnt sugar. Piny with a raw sweetness. Very complex and not at all harsh. The flavors blend seamlessly.  Medium bodied with a semi-dry finish. The carbonation is middle-of-the-road as well and brightens the whole deal up a bit. The flavor and texture really seem to linger on the tongue. Really well crafted and a very interesting adaptation of the style.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,mithrascruor,4.28,"12 oz. bottle poured into a mug.  Appearance: Pours a rather dark, slightly hazy, amber-copper color. Nice dense head, amber-white colored, leaves a good amount of lacing.  Smell: Has a somewhat complex aroma ranging from florals to strong hops.  Taste: Lots of hoppy citrus and pine, but balanced with an earthy flavor that I presume comes with the oak. Aftertaste is light grapefruit and more of the earthy flavor.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth mouthfeel. Carbonation is quite light, but still provides an enjoyable subdued tingly feel.  Drinkability: Not a good session beer due to the strength of flavor and alcohol, but nevertheless quite drinkable. Take it slow...  Though I honestly can't taste the oak in here, I can definitely tell that this is a variation of the regular Arrogant Bastard ale. Though I've grown to enjoy the AB in the past couple years (from initially disliking it), I think that this is superior due to the balancing out of strong flavors with others in order to create a complex (but not overly so) beer. Highly recommended.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,zdk9,4.12,"A- Pours a deep reddish mahogany, with a finger of fluffy white head that leaves decent spidery lacing on the glass.  S- Strong smells of pine, carmel, pineapple. There's also a taste in this beer I can't identify. Maybe it's something to do with the oak, but I think I would recognize that. Hmm...  T- I'm not detecting a lot of oakiness in this beer. It is however, a very intense flavor. There's a piney syrupy hop flavor throughout, accompanied heartily by a sweet carmel malt flavor. Some slight alcohol in the aftertaste, but nothing too overpowering.  M- Syrupy, as expected, but what isn't expected is the good level of carbonation. Nice.  D- A delicious beer, but not worth the incredible build up that I gave it.

Very attractive burnt orange hues. I expected oak in the nose but didn't really find any. The blast of white grapefruit pith is ever present from start to long after finish.

Everything the aroma promises and then some. Woody notes and hints of pine in addition to the citrus and hops. I think I discover something new about it every time I have this. Obviously this is a lot like Arrogant Bastard, but still wholly unique. It seems a little more confident, while Arrogant Bastard acts like it's got something to prove (though it proves itself with flying colors, to be sure).

This beer smells like Pepto Bismol. I suspect this is a phenomenon of some kind of interference pattern with the last beer I drank (the perfect Hook Norton Twelve Days.) Because within a few minutes it begins to smell more like candycane. Of course, it also smells like brown bread and whisky and caramel.  Nice glossy sweet attack of caramel and butter gives way evenly to fairly intense resiny bitterness. Hard cinnamon candy flavored hops, with lemon and pepper. Pasteurized apple juice sweetner with dried marshmallow. Wood flavors are subdued but serve to structure the large volume of texture and sweetness.

Aroma-boozy, not a pure oak aroma but a barrell or bourbon aroma is there. As it warms, that insane Stone hop aroma comes through and ther is an essence of pine rosin. Mouthfeel-immediate hop bitterness, very astringent and medicinal. I have not had many oaked beers but this carries one hell of an edgy taste. Something not quite hoppy is in there competing for supreme bitterness on the palate. A froth releases a very minute malty sweetness. Finishes with a medicinal bitterness that lingers. I love AB and this has another aggressive bitter edge that just exudes all that is Stone. This brew backs up every word that is printed on the AB bottles- YES! I am worthy.

147,8951,MiguelMandingo,4.3,"Got this as part of a shipment from South Bay Drugs. Thanks Joey.  Poured a 12oz. bottle into an AB glass.  Appearance - Murky translucent honey brown/mahogany. It produced a 1 1/2 finger head that slowly dissipated to a thin crown. Left behind a little bit of lacing.  Smell - It smells more subdued than the normal AB. The vanilla and oak notes compete with the piney hop scents for dominance. There is a slight sweetness to the scent that is reminiscent of burnt caramel or toffee.  Taste - It tastes very similar to the normal AB, just with oaky vanilla and woody tones. The deep, almost roasty, caramel-like malts intermingle very well with the vanilla tones from the oak at the beginning of the flavor, and the piney hops round out the flavor with a bitter oaky finish. Very tasty.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied. The carbonation level is a little low for my tastes. The prickly sensations on the tongue start strong as it touches the tip of the tongue and then die off completely by the time it reaches the throat. It has a good mouthfeel, just not enough carbonation IMO.  Drinkability - This is amazingly easy to drink. It isn't quite as harsh as the normal AB - the oak flavors smooth off the harsh edges. I love the original AB, but if Stone sold this stuff in Texas, I could easily see myself reaching for this one over the original AB the majority of the time. Very tasty stuff.

Not a whole lot to it. Strong hops flavor that dominates all others.  T- Good taste, rich, with some complex hops taste. A light flavor of oak adds very well to the taste.  M- Good mouthfeel, thick for an ale, but enjoyable. Starts off with a heavy feel, smooth on the tongue and finishes leaving a slight bite at the end.  D- Good drinkablitiy.

Well balanced taste of pronounced solventy and fruity esters; sweet dark malts; savory dry wood, leather, rye whiskey, nuts; earthy, vegetal hop bitterness like grilled radicchio.

Since it's loaded with hops and alcohol, which are essentially preservatives, I'm not worried. I shall decant to a Brandy glass.  Pours cloudy brown with ruby highlights. Adorned with a tightly beaded creamy head that laces well. A soft aroma of American hops and, of course, oak. It's not as in-your-face as it is with the unoaked Bastard.  Alike on the tongue, we have a smoother, more mature Bastard. Yes, there's a big hoppy bite but it's deeply ingrained into the matrix of an oak barrel. The hops don't linger as long either.

Citrus hops and some sweet malt are evident. Taste is much bigger than the smell was. Nice citrus hops and caramel malt backbone. The oak is apparent in the finish and does a great job of rounding this brew off. I've had the regular and this does seem more balanced with the oak taking away some of the bitterness.

Also present are some piney citrusy hops, but that sweet malt dominates. A definite oaky scent here.  T - When that oaky scent turns into a flavor it makes a beautifully round beer. The malts still dominate this flavor early with a definite vanilla flavor. To round out the beer, the bittering hops are piney and citrusy, but not over the top. Very well balanced beer.

First smell give me great hops with a background of the rough woodsy oak that this has been aged in. A lot more to this, some of the fruity esters from the yeast coming through.  Taste is much more mellow than the original AB, smoothed out with a lot less bitter and more warmth. The bitter is still very apparent but without the resiny quality - more of a citrus bitter.

147,8951,SloMoSlovak,4,"I've never really cared that much for the original Arrogant Bastard. It's okay, and in a style that seems to be up my alley (I love hops, bitterness, etc.), but I always thought the brewers lived up to their hype and the beer was a dare to try something just overdone.  I got this six-pack (and another) from a friend of my wife for ""fixing"" her computer. A good deal for 20 minutes of work in my book, and despite some ambivalence regarding the original AB, I was intrigued by the oaking.  On occasion, I do drink wine, and I normally steer clear of Chardonnay, as I'm not crazy about drinking something that tastes like wood. Oaked AB demonstrates, though, that oaking may go better with beer than wine.  Poured into a nonic, the beer was very clear, and a flat medium-dark brown. Very little head (maybe due to the new glass, just washed) but what little there was lingered almost to the end.  Nose, just hops and maybe a light toasty malt aroma...I think I detected it only because I was looking for it. No evidence of oak in the scent.  The taste was where my appreciation for this beer took off. It seems like the oaking (assuming the formula is more or less the same as the original AB) mellows out a bit of the overly-assertive bitterness. It's still there, but, I guess I'd call it ""flatter"" than the normal AB. Hops are on the piney side, which I think matches well with the oak, which doesn't really stand out, but rather matches harmoniously with the other elements. Malt presence is subdued, as in the aroma. It's there, but you gotta look for it.  Mouthfeel, a bit thinner than I anticipated, but I think this supported the drinkability overall. More refreshing than I thought it would be.  I'm not sure I'd search this one out, given all the other great beers out there that I already love or have yet to try, but I wouldn't hesitate to drink it again.  Update, 11/21/07  I've since finished the remaining 5 beers in the six pack. I don't need to change the scoring overall, but I wanted to note that I think my description was off a bit. I don't know what I was smoking, but I missed out on the malt flavor in this beer. It's not nearly as subdued as I originally wrote. I think the beer is still in balance, due to the Stone proclivity for hops/bitterness, but the balance definitely tips more to the malt side than I'd originally indicated.  Although I wouldn't change my score, my respect for this beer actually grew as I finished the six-pack off. I think I'd be more likely to pick this one up, too.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Definite notes of piny hops, a thick malty center, and the oak. However, along with the oak comes a slightly rubbery smell. Not strong, but it's still there. Taste is much better. Big taste of the hops... very citrusy and piny. Great bitterness on the center of the tongue, finishing clean with a strong, grainy touch. Some vanilla in the aftertaste.

147,8951,IronDjinn,4.15,"Big thanks to Viggo for including this in my CanBIF #3 package, I love Arrogant Bastard, and have not been able to sample to oak aged stuff yet.  Pours out a deep transluscent red oak, hazed and almost nearing opaque. Tall sand-coloured creamy head that eventually drops down to a quarter inch sized cap, lots of sticky lacing in its wake.  The aroma is a big hit of malt with a lot of fig and date in the profile, faint cherry, almost vinuous, like Turkish delight. Caramel, vanilla and papaya. Citrus from the hops, although the malt is most certainly in control here on the nose.  Vanilla and caramel are thrust up front on the flavour, while an intense herbal hop jumps in as well throughout. After a few sips the hops abstain from appearing until the middle, but it's a force to reckon with and soon takes control. As it warms everything seems to balance out nicely until the finish, where it is a leafy, tongue-raking hop paradise, that is the gateway to a very astringent aftertaste, the memory of all that great malt goodness just a fading shadow.  Mouthfeel is smooth and on the light side, sticky on the finish.  This stuff is pretty intense, and will follow you around for the rest of they day. Hell, it might just sleep overnight on your doorstep as well if you don't watch out. Big on the malt and on the hops, although the hops do win out in the end on that tug of war.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Color is a deep amber brown. Oak flavors are there but don't take over the hops and sweet alcohol taste. Which is surprising But still -- an excellent Bastard!

147,8951,malty,4.97,"Poured from a fresh 12 oz. long neck into the new Sam Adams curvy scientifically thoughtful glass.  The color is a ruddy glowing amber-rosewood with a fine 1/2"" head. Sheets on almost undisturbed lace all the way down the glass.  Smells just like a freshly bit into caramel apple; Vanilla dominates while the hops bring to the rear a somewhat spicy tropical fruit element. A few brisk swirls of my fancy glass evokes concord grape jelly scents smattered with brown sugar & molasses.  Wow, all the deeply sweet & malty scents took a shotgun seat position as the dry & rindy hops grabbed the wheel as soon as this glorious liquid hit my tongue. The oak chip maturation really shines on the standard Arrogant Bastard I've grown so fond of. The hops and the oak chips create a perfect dryness & bitterness for the sweet (and slightly toasty) malts to rest upon. All of the scents I described translate perfectly into the flavors, all with a bombastic bitter hop attack straight out of the gate. There's even a tiny hint of sourness at the finish, (although it could just be the unique bitter/dryness from the oak chips) which I'm really digging.  Mouthfeel is medium-to-full bodied with a perfect amount of ultra fine carbonation to keep all the flavors frolicking. A deeply flavorful and dry finish.  Drinkability is through the roof. This really works well for me. The sweet & thick malts linger underneath the potent hop ensemble all entwined with the vanilla dry oakey spotlight - blows my socks off. I'd skip dinner and just drink a few more of these!  Overall a stunningly bold and perfectly balanced ale. It's like The Avengers, The Invaders, The Fantastic Four and the Super Friends all got together and created this beer. If I were to compare this beer to a band, it'd definitely be Led Zeppelin. Full force, multi-dimensional, grimy and graceful! A perfect beer for me!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,kmpitz2,4.35,"12 oz bottle. Its been a while since I had this one. It pours a deep amber color with a light coat of head over top. The clarity is moderate and there are a few stray bubbles, but no real carbonation present. The aroma is deep caramel with an underlying pine hop and a mellow tannin and light vanilla. It has a nice balance between the aromas. The first sip brings a very solid vanilla and tannin that moves to a full pine hop with a sweet caramel and almost sugary sweetness that fades into a solid but pleasing bitterness. I really think the vanilla on this one blends really well with the caramel and hop of the brew. I don't remember their being a a vanilla note in this one. Mouthfeel is thick, with a light carbonation. Drinkability on this one is really good. There are some big flavors but they blend well and don't make it overpowering. This one still impresses me.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Some smoke and sweet alcohol also noted.  t: Up front the oaked version is similar to Arrogant Bastard (ab). A huge dry malt profile unique to the bastards hits first. The hop bite that follows is blunted somewhat by the oak. Blunted and replaced by... what? Well, that's the problem. The oak flavor is too faint to justify its taming of the hops. Still, this is a more blanced beer than ab and damn tasty.  m: Carbonation is long lasting, a good thing as this is certainly a sipper. Flavors linger nicely at the back of the throat.  d: Tough to score fairly. Comparing this to ab lowers the score quite a bit. Scored on its own merit,however, this is a beer I'd revisit.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Incredible complexity and equal balance on this aroma.  T: Sweet up front, slight medicinal quality and apparent wood, vanilla and anise, and some smoke in the finish along with some very tame hop bitterness. No hint of alcohol. Again, very complex and very balanced.  M/D: Mouthfeel is very nice. Medium to full bodied, creamy on the palate with no prickly carbonation. Incredible well done. Nice drinkablity as well.

147,8951,kelticblood,3.57,"Strong hoppy aroma when first opened. First sips reveal a strong bitterness along with an earthy tone. The appearance has almost the same color as the bottle it came in, a dark brown. Has moderate thin lacing and a head that reduced real quick to almost nothing. Would of liked to see a bigger head for such a hyped beer. Nicely carbonated with a full body. Leaves a very dry bitter finish. The hop flavor and bitterness hides any other tastes that might be present. Alcohol is well hidden making it easy to drink. I'm not really getting an aged ale with oak chip tastes.Maybe the earthy tone I tasted was the oak chips. It does taste different than regular Arrogant bastard which I prefer. It does have a slight sweet finish. I'm not really impressed with this. The price they were charging was outrageous at like $16.99 a six-pack. I only bought a single.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,FightingEntropy,3.95,"Presentation: bottle from Village Bottle Shoppe in W. Lafayette, IN poured into a pint glass.  A: dark brown ale wiht some ruby highlights, murky, not as shimmering as regular Bastard. A off white head builds quickly, and falls away. A bit of lace but not much.  S: Strong oak nose dominates over the malty spine of the beer. The malty sweetness is pushed to the side for the oak. Hops present, strong and aggressive, but still mellow compared to the straight Bastard I had last night. Still a fruity hop bite in nose, but not as much.  T: More oak. Good beer to learn what oak tastes like. Big malt, big hop, but neither lingers not the mouth like the regular, again overridden by the oak. Not a great, but a good blend.  M: here's the thing that's weird, is the mouthfeel is a bit thin, definately lighter than the regular. Missing the chewiness for some reason. Still good, but some interaction I don't seem to get has changed the feel of this beer.  Overall: In spite of the notes above, this is still a pretty good beer. I'd prefer to have the regular Arrogant Bastard over this, which shows I suppose that throwing something in a barrel isn't always going to improve the beer, regardless of being more extreme (and more work). Not upset that I got the six pack, but wish I had more of the regular or gotten more Ruination.  Peer comparison: I'm off in another direction on this one, but I think I'm ok with that. Evidently the lighter mouthfeel is seen as smoothness but others, but I don't have any problem with the smoothness of the regular. Sounds like the tap version may have some subtleness not mentioned in the bottled beer, but I haven't had a chance to confirm that--sadly I live in a non-Stone state and grab it when I'm elsewhere. No one pointed to the oak as dominating as I did, which seems to be the point of reduction for me.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

A - In a pint glass it showed up with a nice fingertip's worth of head that stuck around for a bit. Excellent lacing was shown as this swirling chestnut mixture went down. Fades to a darker brown.  S - Toasted malts and woodchips. Not an overpowering smell as I was expecting, but not unpleasant.  T - Incredible complexity, big roasty profile with spices and malt-like tastes. What amazed me about this brew was that unlike it's standard counterpart, it was nearly impossible to taste the alcohol! Of course due to it's warming effects you could still detect it. As it warmed, it became a bit sweeter and the hop bite was more apparent.  M - Naturally full bodied, perfect carbonation levels, and a nice clean finish. No residue or other nonsense.  D - Excellent, I had a few, and am looking forward to having a few more. This is probably my favorite offering from Stone.

The smell was understated. I picked up a piney/citrusy hops in the nose.  Taste: YUM! I like this stuff!... the oak aging has mellowed the strong bite of the un-oaked... Oh yes there is still a pronounced hop flavor.... a good combination of pine and grapefruit rind. The malt is there in the background to help balance things out. Plus there is a solid ""woodsy"" taste... kind of like getting lost in a pine forest.  Mouthfeel: I can't imagine anything better.... this is the thickest, most robust ale I've ever had.... and the creamy mouth coating lingers on and on. The carbonation level is on the low side... which, I feel, only adds to the overall creamyness of this wonderful beer!  Drinkability: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED... good stuff.

Maybe it's the oak aging or that it was served on tap, but the hop bitterness was toned down.  Appearance was blase due to the fact that there was no head or any lacing. My first sip I was hit by a whallop of fruitiness, and after that I got the hops. Only after slurping it a bit could I taste the oak. I guess this is the first Stone that I liked(I haven't had their stouts yet), so maybe I'll sample a few more.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

T: As the smell, the taste is less hoppy & less powerful than regular AB. Plus the odd woody quality from the smell was there too - overall taste wasn't bad, but the oak certainly didn't add anything I liked & interfered with what I liked so much in the normal AB.  M: Medium body, lightly carbonated. Very smooth. Typical Stone excellent mouthfeel.  D: Very drinkable with the alcohol well hidden.

The head was of the off white two finger variety which lasted quite awhile and then laced very nicely. Nice balance of hops and malt in the aroma. Decent mouthfeel...a little thin but not bad by any means. Strong malt flavor with a nice balance of bitterness. Not a stong hop flavor or aroma but a nice finish. Everything an ale should be.

Some light tartness is accompanied by a sweet compilation of oaked hops and barley. The body is light and almost refreshing. I am not usually a fan of oaking high IBU beers, but this is yet another perfectly balanced beverage from Stone.  -Overall I found this more mature than Arrogant Bastard, but lacking some of the complexity found in Double Bastard.

Smells slightly sour and woody- not acetic, but some wood sourness. There are also earthy/spicy hops and some rough tannins. The taste is somewhat similar, the somewhat harsh and spicy taste of the regular arrogant bastard has been smoothed out by the oak, but the oak introduces its own version of roughness. Nevertheless, its still fairly tasty as it is a fairly harmonious union between oak and hops and malt. Mouthfeel is a little tannic and rough- could be smoother.

147,8951,williamherbert,3.98,"The look is clearer than expected, although there is some haze. Deep mahogany brownish red, with a large rocky head.  The oak is present in the smell but doesn't hijack the rest of the aroma. Heavy alcohol of the srong ale is there too. The oak worries me a bit, for I fear that it's going to dominate the rest of the beer's properties. Hops are bitter grapefruit.  The smoky oak flavor allays my fears as it is a compliment to the strong alcohol of the rest of the ale. The oak is the hook, the accent; it's not the end-all, be-all. The dark alcohol/strong flavor remains. Spicy when it warms up.  Feels smooth but with a little gritty chunkiness. Not too thick but not watery either. A tad prickly. This is actuall a very pleasant, strong drink. Not one you can guzzle all night long but a formidable strong oaked ale.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Plenty of lacing is left behind in the glass. Dark red can be seen without light-but when held up to the light the red is much more noticeable.  S- Nice complex nose. A bouquet of different hop aromas hit the nose first followed by chocolate malt, caramel malt, and vanilla oak.  T- Some hop flavors along with a big oak flavor upfront. Caramel malt is subtle in the background-but still provides plenty of balance. Hop bitterness really comes out for the finish along with a big piny hop flavor. Left to linger is an abundance of oak and chocolate malt with hints of hop bitterness. Taste is bigger and more complex-but much milder than regular AB.  M- Low to medium carbonation and fairly thick body. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy.  D- I like this on much better than regular AB. The flavor is much more complex yet not as aggressive which makes for a nice strong ale. I will certainly have this one again.

There's a big, sweet and very herbal hop scent rolling out of the glass including some classic cascade scent's, like pineapple, and assorted acidic fruits, then becoming very green and herbal but certainly floral. Underneath the hops you have a sugar-house like smokiness and a smooth buttery malt.  ""Agressive hops"" is what stands out most, very complex with a very acidic fruit edge with pineapple standing out most and quickly becoming very herbal, not spicey but earthy. The malt balance is subtle and smooth that includes a semi-bitter oak smokiness and toffee-like sweetness, the malt never really becomes bold and them balance is dominated by hops. The alcohol heat adds further balance and is not too high or in-your-face. Very delightful.  This one feels full, slick and smooth but with a nice lively carbonated bite.

The beer pours a deep reddish-brown color. A rather substantial head diminishes to a remaining delicately thin white layer of bubbles. Smells similar to the original AB, with less of the hoppy notes associated with the original. I was pleasantly surprised upon tasting it. This beer is delicious! The oak takes out much of the overpowering strong ale flavor, and leaves a delicious smoky background. The beer is very smooth and drinkable, and the mouthfeel is just right for the style.

The finish is slightly bitter, slightly malty, and mostly woody and it's delicious. The mouthfeel is medium full, the carbonation is light. Great taster. The alcohol is only noticeable some time after the swallow. Very drinkable.  Bottom line: This is a very good oaked brew that I'd certainly buy again. The flavours all work together in almost flawless harmony and I can only recommend it highly!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,MrThursday,4.26,"This score might be a bit lower than appropriate, as I drank the beer in an opaque vessel, and in a dark room--didn't get much of a look, so I just gave it a middle of the road score on appearance.  Oaked AB smells terrific--vaguely sweet, with floral hops, and a bit of oak. There's hardly any woody taste however--in the mouth, Oaked AB is basically a smoother version of the standard Arrogant Bastard. While I like the original, I prefer to avoid the punch to the mouth hops/malt, and the alcohol is better hidden here. A really good beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,srandycarter,4.4,"Poured from bottle into Stone tulip.  A - Small, nice head. Some lacing. Body red tinged murky brown.  S - Whole lot of stuff in there. AB plus wood, all evident in the nose.  T - Yum. First time I tried this, I have to admit I wasn't sure I cared for it. Second attempt yielded better results. Terrific BA flavor - deep aggressive malt with some hops to finish. New to the mix with the oaked is, of course, the wood, the vanilla and some cooked fruit, maybe cherry?  M - Good solid prescense, carbonation perfect, viscosity good, bitter end.  D - I love this stuff. I could get a few in before things deteriorated due to the ABV.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Brad007,4.82,"Darkish-amber color witha thin, brown head and some lacing. Aroma is nice and oak-ish, slightly fruity/malty as well. Taste is really strong with hops/malt upfront and a nice oak aftertaste that is somewhat dry towards the back of the throat. Second sip confirms a floral/grapefruit taste in the middle before hitting the back of the tongue. Very smooth and complex. Basically Arrogant Bastard with a nice oak feel to it. Lots of lacing left behind as well.  Definitely worth the $2.50/12oz bottle. Would buy this beer again for sure.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,cooncat,4.38,"Serving from a 12 oz. bottle, decanted into a standard pint glass.  A vigorous pour produces a deep, dark copper (garnet) colored brew, with 2 fingers of tan head. This head, while not particularly long lasting, keeps a thin lid on the beer and splashes the side of the glass with nice lacing. The nose is huge with both a sweet malt backbone, and a pungent floral hop presence. No oak noticed in the nose. The taste is a very complex combination of huge piney/resiny hops, and a sweet caramel malt flavor that loses out against the hop onslaught on every sip. As the beer warms, a faint oak presence is noted on the back of the palate, where the malt is doing it's thing. Mouthfeel is full and firm and wonderful, but not to the extent of being 'chewy'. The 7.2% ABV isn't really noticeable, except for, perhaps, a bit of a warming effect at the end. Amazing drinkability for a huge complex beer. You'll be wanting to quaff more than one, but be responsible!  Yet another highly recommended brew from the great folks at Stone.

Most people shy away from arrogant bastard because of the strong flavor (and name) but the oaked arrogant bastard ends up being a lot smoother and easier to drink than it's counter part.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,CharlieMopps,4.32,"Enjoyed in 12 oz. bottle form.  A: The word ""volatile"" comes to mind as I poured this into a standard size pint glass. Three fingers of head surge forth, slowly settling but retaining great density and leaving much lacing behind. The beer itself is somewhere between auburn and garnet, displaying highlights of both yet still being rather dark.  S: Notes of grapefruit, oak, and a foreboding musty funk dominate the nose. Definitely a spicy and hoppy backbone, with a malt character lurking underneath.  T: A heavier malt introduction (moreso than expected) provides a great base for a hoppy side that is quite citrusy and lingers for a good while on the palate in the finish and aftertaste. Composition is quite unique, yet balance still remains a large part of the charm this beer has.  M: Slick and oily hop feel, and a bit of creaminess with the carbonation at an optimal level.  D: Off the wall as merely Arrogant Bastard, the oaked version takes on a different character. Drinkability is solid, as Stone likes to play mind games with their labels. Sure, they'd like you to buy into the ""intimidation factor,"" but it's really just a bold beer that oozes complexity, yet keeps balance somewhat in mind.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Overlord,4.3,"Delicious, had this in the new six pack style.  Big ruby red color, large white-ish/creamish head. Smell is woodsy and grapefruity.  Big, big taste. Lots of wood in there, almost as much pine as oak. Grapefruit, some malt to balance it, and other citrus flavors. Can't think of a better beer to get a sixpack of. I found the flavor far less overwhelming than the normal A. Bastard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Taste- this beer is so complex there's too much for me to comprehend.  mouthfeel- most Stone brews have that same healthy mouthfeel, not too thin and not thick to where it makes you gag like some beers can do.  drinkability- This is a 1 or 2 beers and im done. The oak bastard ale is a lot sweeter then the regular bastard ale so the sweetness get to you after the second beer. This is an ale I would save for a victory beverage when the redskins win!!!!

It has a smooth and mellowing scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts along with a generous amount of hops and a mild oak aroma. The taste is good. It has an aggressive wood flavor up front as well as in the finish. It blends well with the bold malt and hop profile. The hop bitterness lends itself well to the oak flavor. The mouthfeel is good also. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a wonderful version of an already great beer.

I spent half my time smelling this beer, it's simply too much  Taste- I tried so hard to pick this beer apart, but it simply overwhelmed my taste buds, this beer is so complex there's too much for me to comprehend.  mouthfeel- most Stone brews have that same healthy mouthfeel, not too thin and not thick to where it makes you gag like some beers can do.  drinkability- as much as i really enjoyed this beer, I think it would be impossible for me to have more than one a night or even a week perhaps.

Head dissipates quickly leaving a thin cream colored ring around the glass.  S=Speaking of apples.... I'm smelling wood, apples, carmel and piney-citrusy hops with a trace of booziness. Yum.  T= Similar to the aroma.... wood, apples, carmel, both floral and citrus hops, sweet malt and bitter citrus rind finish.  M=Near perfect thickness, coats the tongue and mouth with sweet then bitter, maybe just a hair too much carbonation.  D=Highly drinkable until the abv decides you've had enough.

147,8951,Mindsquall,4.35,"This poured very nicely, a very dark amber with a nice tan head. Smell is extremely hoppy, with a slight aroma of something different (I'm thinking it's the oak). The flavor is almost pure hops, but the finish contains this almost smoky aroma, definitely unique. It's aggressively bitter which isn't totally a bad thing but can be a bit much, put simply you have to be in the mood for something like this.

Taste is bitter up front, slightly grapefuit but most noticable is the pine. This is followed by the oak that serves to smooth things out. Lots to chew on in this one. The first one I had I didn't really think the oak was doing much but smooting things out. Now on the second one a few weeks later I'm really getting a full oaky wood taste. What can you say, another excellent beer from Stone. I haven't had the original AB in a long time so I can't really compare this to that one.

147,8951,BeerSox,4.2,"12oz bottle into snifter.  Dark ruby red hue with a slim tan head that lasts for a decent bit of time.  Very rich fruit aroma, like grape with a bit of sharp spices. Like grapefruit, but a little sweeter. A little bit of piney hop aroma is there, but it's blended in well with the sweeter fruit.  Smooth surgary fruit leads its way up to an almost puckering bitterness from the hops. A little bit of spice makes its way in as well. For an oaked beer, the vanilla seems to be pretty low. The alcohol is well hidden. Full bodied, with a good amount of carbonation to keep the beer lively. Toward the end the hops tend to make their presence known, giving a tart and bitter piney residue that sticks to your tongue. As the beer warms an almost smokey characteristic starts to emerge.  A very very complex beer, giving sweet highs, bitter lows, and everything inbetween. I didn't find much difference between the oaked and the original, although it has been a while since I have tried the latter. Regardless, it's a beer that's worth your while.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

I forget what the original tasted like it's been years since i've had it. But this one is big, tasty, and oakey (if that's a word) It has a sweet carmalized fruity taste to it, almost out of this beer world. It should be a barleywine, but it's not, man it's tasty.

On to the beer:  Wow, what a beauty this is. Perfect size creamy head, dark red in color. The nose brings tropical piney fruits and charred wood. You can definitely find the oak chips in the taste. It carries out a flame-smoked flavor as it is balanced by the sweetness of the beer, which by the way isn't so dominate in this offering. Woody in the aftertaste.

147,8951,MaltyGoodness,4,"12oz. bottle  Pours a clear hickory brown with a ruby tint and a creamy tan head that fades. Nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma is largely citrusy hops on a nice caramel malt background. Very nice hint of oak in the smell.  A nice blend of citrusy hops and a slightly sweet caramel malt taste upfront that gets leveled by an aggressive bitter bite. A mild oakiness appears and maintains as it hits the finish with a bitter and citrusy taste. Bitterness lingers.  Full body, medium carbonation.  Well, I very much enjoy the original, and I must say that the oak is a nice compliment. It's nicely drinkable, and is no problem to enjoy more than one in a sitting. It's certainly a nice variation of the original, although I don't think it is superior (nor inferior). It is certainly more expensive...",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Aroma of vanilla, damp malt, and a hint of bourbon notes. Flavor is dominated by the oak notes. Dry smoky flavor has very little malt sweetness to counteract it. Hop bitterness comes in eventually, but still plays second fiddle to the wood. For this size of a beer, the mouthfeel is a bit thin. Drinakbility is OK, but I'd take regular AB, DB, or really ANYTHING else stone has to offer over this.

Lots of pine hop aroma, with a some caramel malt and a touch of oaky alcohol. The taste is thick with malt, big citrusy hops, and a little alcohol. I must say the oak aging really does it's part in mellowing the alcohol and hop bite of the traditional AB. there is a complexity to this beer that is definitely not evident in the original.

Oak and vinuous notes, with some acidity, dominate the long, very dry, finish.  Full-bodied and rich in texture.  I like this one...but, personally I would probably choose the non-oaked Arrogant Bastard over it. I had this at a tasting awhile back and wanted to have it on a fresh palate - I still feel that while the oak is interesting (and I've had barrel-conditioned brews that really enhanced the flavors) it almost interferes with its great natural taste (call me a ""party-pooper"" I suppose).

A touch of fruity hops are detectable. Not incredibly pungent.  T - Starts with an earthy sweetness (oaked to be exact) and touch of alcoholic bite. Nutty flavors accompany the sweetness, and a bit of citrus flavor is hidden in there. Finish is bitter hops with some residual sugars coating your mouth. Complex, but not astonishing.  M - Moderate carbonation and slight alcoholic bite. Drying finish and some mouth coating affect.  D - I'm not blown away by this beer, but I still always look forward to sampling any Stone product.

Honey, vanilla, oak and brown sugar were what came out most in the nose, although if I had a more sensitive palate I might be able to pinpoint some more, because there were certainly tons of things going on. Honey, sweet and sour fruits, mild smoke, brown sugar and roasted caramel malts are all balanced with the oakiness, which really pop on the palate and make for a wonderful tasting experience. The mouthfeel was as complex as the taste, with the sweetness of honey and caramel malts fading into an almost bittersweet or even dry-ish finish which lingers for a very long time on the tongue. Overall, this is an excellent beer and another great example of Stone taking a style to the next level with an invested interest in balance and complexity.

The aging process really melds the piney hops the aromatic wood together, like drinking the liquid flavors of an IPA combined with the almost cedar-like properties of the oak.

A beautiful looking beer and I'd have to say, behind Nosferatu, the best American Strong I've ever had.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,westweasel,4.2,"Thanks to BeerBeing for a chance at this arrogant brew!  Poured into a Sam Adams tasting glass. The first thing I noticed as I poured the beer was the smell of cherries. After it settled in the glass, the cherry faded some, and I was smelling caramel, cherry, oak, and a bit of citrus.  The beer poured out a very hazy amber/milk chocolate color with a small but long-lasting beige head. Belgian lace was left all along the glass as the beer went down.  The taste was easy to recognize that this was a smoother version of arrogant bastard. There was some wood flavor and also the familiar mix of biscuits and a strong citrus hop bitterness.  The mouthfeel was medium to full. The drinkability was very good. The bitterness is somewhat tempered and a it is a little more interesting than the regular arrogant bastard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Budlum,4.25,"Pouring this beer produces a tall, tan head or large bubbles with a creamy texture. The body is a rich garnet and amber color with a mild haziness. Head retention is excellent with light lacing on the glass.  The nose presents strong hops carrying a strong pine aroma. Sweet sugars mix with vanilla and the hops for a very balanced smell. Lingering mint and black licorice add layered complexity to a strongly-hopped beer.  Strong hops start the flavors of this beer with authority. The hops flavors are held as a warm sweetness hits the palate. Mild fruits blend with a stout-like barley quality that really adds depth to this beer. The hop flavors grow stronger in the finish as a smoky character increases the strength of the flavors. Alcohol is detectable but it is not overpowering. Oak-aging has served this beer well.  The mouthfeel is smooth, relatively light and almost creamy. The body is on for what can be expected of an aged ale.  Drinkability is good. I would prefer a regular Arrogant Bastard for a session but this is a very enjoyable offering with great flavor depth.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,tavernjef,4,"Hmmm...the color/appearance seems to be all over the place when passing through various reviews. This bottle poured out a strong caramel brown and pretty much stayed that way. Sitting with a murky tone of dark peachy brown mud. Very slender capping of softly lit brown foam. Carries with it lots of broken sheeting lace as its consumed.  Aroma is evidenlty warmed with a slight oak tinge over lots of caramel malt, piney, orange citrus hops, and some floral dryness.  Taste is about the same really. Malty large with lots of caramel, some toasty factions reside in the edgings as it finishes. Has lots of balanced but broading hops that are feverishly orangeified and piney. Slightly lemony and tainted tangerine burntness. Its a mouth full of stuff and has just an inkling of oakyness hinted in the heat within. Not bad, but somehow different from what I remember when experiencing it at tap a few summers ago while in San Diego.  Body is about medium to closing in on full, has a bit of break to it near the middle and really has an ever changing presence to it. This was a wild ride to say the least. Perhaps this was bottled from the bottom of the batch? This seemed somehow out of place. I remember this beer kicking my ass with much more depth, malt, and stickyness when having it tap.  Anyways, I have another bottle that I will try later on and see if there is a difference. But as this bottle went, it was a solid representation of a Stone brew, yet didn't happen to get anymore wowness then expected out of it from my first on-tap experience.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,flexabull,4.47,"Found a six pack of nicely aged Oaked AB at a local store. So I grabbed it.  Let's see what 7+ months has done to this one.  Pours a slightly cloudy deep dark amber / brown color. has a nice small head, that leaves a lot of lacing around the glass.  Aromas are of stewed fruits, some green apple hints, oak, and a touch of booze.  First sip... whoa! The hops have held up much better than I thought they would have. There is an underlying sweet and dark fruit maltiness, some dry oak like flavors, and a very bitter and biting hop finish. Still a pretty potent beer, even with quite a few months under it's belt.  Mouthfeel is nice. Very full, thick, and well balanced.  Drinkability is very good. I am pleasantly surprised with how well this has held up. I'll probably set a couple of these aside for a few more months to see how much more this changes. Very interesting, and enjoyable.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,BretSikkink,4.03,"Dark brown ale with an expanding fizz of off white head, goes from about one finger at the end of the pour to two+ fingers that stay for several minutes. Spotty lacing.  Aromas are strong and woody, with an herbal backing. Lesser notes of florals and citrics from the hopping, while there is also some sweetness of thick, alcoholic malt.  Dark pine oil hopping anchors the flavor, herbals follow, featuring a bit of mint. The malt is thick and sweet, also noticeably oaky. Creamy and thick, a large beer, somewhat challenging. Dry finish with big wood notes.  Interesting twist on their Strong Ale, this is a very decent oaked brew, and a must for fans of the Bastard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Flavor: Slightly sweet up front, hints of cherries, potpourri. Huge floral hop flavor. Huge alcohol and oaky wood but the sharp hop bitterness quickly over powers, then plants itself on the back of the tongue and throughout the mouth. The bitterness doesn't stop until you take another sip and the description above starts over again.  Mouthfeel: Medium-full bodied - Silky on the tongue and perfect carbonation.  Overall Impression: Talk about flavor, complexity in this one! I have never had an Arrogant Bastard Ale and wasn't expecting a huge lingering hop bitterness. Great beer and oaky!

147,8951,tpd975,4.6,"Got this one as part of a wonderful trade from Sudsdog, my BA bro.  A: Pours a nice hazel brown color with a 2 finger head that hangs around for a bit before fading to a perfect ring with a nice island in the middle.  S: Very malty, woody, earthy with subtle hints of citrus hops and sweet brown sugar.  T: I like this one a lot, and it tastes a great deal different than original AB. The oaking hides some of the hops upfront. There is a wonderful smokiness about it as it first crosses the tongue then the citrus of the hops come thru perfectly in the finish along with a hint of booze.  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. It's creamy with a smooth mouthfeel and perfect zestyness as you swallow.  D: I got two of the 12 ouncers but could put down a bomber easily. It's a really nice brew. I will save my second bottle for a later date, dont want to drink up all of this one at once.  Overall: This beer is Fantastic with a capital F. It has a nice balance of hops, malt, and woodiness from the oaking. It is an easy drinking beer for a hot Sunday afternoon, or a cool one for that matter. Stone makes some very aggressive beers but this is not one of them. This beer is very middle of the road. It's perfectly prepared and not over the top in any aspect whatsoever. They did a great job with this one, Cheers to the brewers at Stone; this one is different than your normal offering but just as Great!  It's a perfect beer for an Arrogant Bastard like myself!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,CarolinaCardinals,4.2,"Picked up a couple of bottles at Sportsman's back in early January for 2.49 each.  Beer poured a reddish brown color with a nice sturdy off white head that is sustaining well. Nose is somewhat fruity, malty, with a hint of citrus. The boquet gets better as it warms. Taste is interesting, the palate is greeted by heavy oak with the malts and slides into the AB's familiar hop slam finish with hints of citrus. Mouthfeel is a bit smoother than the original AB. Overall drinkability is good. This was definitely fun to try, and a very good beer, but the oak is a tad bit too much for me personally compared to AB.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Looks great, with a perfect creamy off-white head. Smell is malty with a nice woodiness/earthiness.  Taste is great. Everything here comes together - I think moreso than the bottle - the mellow pine hops, the earthy oakiness, the slightly sweet malts - very nice. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy too. And drinkability is exceptional.  I like this even better from the tap than the bottle. A very well composed beer, and an example of good oak aging. Highly recommended.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,NatureSon,4.67,"I have had this beer twice in my life, however, I wanted to relate an incident about this beer. A friend of mine was recently given a bottle of 1997 oaked arrogant bastard. This friend of mine is no where near being a purveyor of fine beers, as his favorite beer is Coors Light. Sadly to say, after drinking one drink of this magnificent ale, he was disgusted by its flavor and then he proceeded to pour it all down the drain. In reality, he should have poured himself down the drain instead. Obviously, when he told me this, I nearly flipped out and then I chastised him for his recklessness. His response; ""Dude, it's only beer."" What an ignoramous.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,mnwags,4.42,"A: A deep red hue comes glowing out of the glass as if it is a beer from on tap right at the gates of hell. Not much of head to build from on this particular bottle.  S: The smell is amazing and the oak chips are not the first thing noticed but a malty smell and then Bam..for some reason I am seeing a warm spiced pear dessert..weird. Anyway, a full whiff brings in the oak chips and burnt/toasty nut smell.  T: The taste is awesome!! So much going on it is hard to explain and the aftertaste last for a very long time. The bitterness is just right and the alcohol feels so good when it touches your lips. Mmmm.  M: The brew traveled fine and the mouthfeel is good enough for me.

147,8951,bobhits,4.05,"I assume this is from the 06 release, but I can't find a date for the life of me.  I'm not really sure how to review this beer. I can't taste any real oak/vanilla flavor in it. At first there wasn't even any arrogant bastard here. As it's warmed (I served it fairly warm to start with) I picked up on the bitter after taste of the normal bastard.  What you do get here is a much better balanced beer than the normal bastard. You get a nice cherry flavor to start and a strong hoppy bitterness at the end. A very smooth beer and you could chug if you wanted to (not at these prices though!) or really enjoy sipping on.  It has a great head, the color looks great. It's got a very nice complex smell.  Maybe I went into this beer expecting too much as I love oaked beers and I really enjoyed the standard AB (though imo it's slightly overrated). This beer is well worth trying even at the high prices but I'm not sure if I'd buy it again.  I expected a lot more flavor and a bit more complexity. My score is high enough to tsay this is a really good beer but I expected more, especially when this costs nearly 3 dollar per 12 oz bottle.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Pooba001,4.18,"The Oaked Bastard pours a deep hazy reddish amber with almost an inch of head, which dissipates at a moderate pace. Good looking beer. Smell is more balanced than a regular Bastard, citrus and piney hops are most prominent, but malt, grain, and yeast aromas are here too. Hints of cherry and caramel.  Does seem fruitier and more juicy than the standard Arrogant offering. The astringent, hoppy Chinook kick in the mouth is still here though, which is supported by the malty leather, oak/vanilla flavors. With the in-your-faceness of the Bastard somewhat muted, the subtleties that are revealed prove this to really be a superbly crafted world class ale.  Mouthfeel is decent, I like the juiciness, but have to take some off because of the high perceived astringency. Drinkability is good, better than the normal Bastard. I have a 3L bottle of 2005 Oaked AB waiting for me, so I hope the drinkability is damn good!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,rattech,3.85,"Appearance: A luscious slightly cloudy brown beer with a two inch light tan foamy head. This is a damned attractive looking beer.  Smell: Sweet malt, an almost raisney smell. I can detect a bit of oak in the nose, but it isn't overpowering.  Taste: A slight bitterness with a strong sweet note is detected on the first sip. As I drink the beer, the bitterness becomes more prominent. I think the oak flavor is related to the strengthening of the bitterness as I drink the beer. The initial flavor is good, but the oak is really overwhelming my palette. The flavor is good, but I would like a little more sweetness to compliment the oak, or less oak flavor.  Mouthfeel: Good, but it doesn't stand out as anything amazing. There is a good light carbonation and a nice rich thickness.  Drinkability: With the alcohol percentage coupled with the palette crushing oak drinking more then one 12 ounce bottle in a sitting won't happen.

Like everything else about this beer, it makes a statement with its appearance.  S: Smells more like the best DIPAs on the planet, loads of fresh-baked cookie goodness, and a gorgeous roasted nutty quality makes this aroma a serious winner.  T/M: Again, bold is the word here. A blast of massively bitter grapefruit splashes your taste buds before giving way to the dark, roasted malt center. The grapefruit bitterness is joined by a long, aggressive piney finish. This beer doesn't so much get drank as it does ASSAULT your taste buds. Perfectly balanced carbonation makes it easy to wrestle with large gulps of this monster at a time.  D: If this beer wasn't so dang expensive, I'd buy it more often. It's ridiculously fun to drink, if not outright drinkable.

147,8951,Raymond69,4.42,"This has been in the cellar for about a year, and I figured something this low in ABV should be rotated out.  Poured into pint glass. Red, clear. Decent head. Not bottle conditioned.  Smell is is a nice mixture of of citrusy hops and sweet malt.  This beer has a malty rich, molasses flavor upfront. A drying hop aftertaste that seems to go along with the oaked chip infusion.  Mouthfeel is medium. I'd expect a younger version would feel thinner with a larger hop profile.  Overall drinkability of this beer is great. Almost a session beer. The 7.2% is almost unbelievable for a beer with this much flavor.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,bditty187,4.62,"Hazy, russet-brown with tawny influences; I like the color. Perfectly compacted and yet frothy beige head. At the apex the foam was slightly more than one finger tall. Head retention was excellent; the bubbles were slow to fade to a thick, soapy cap. However, the subsequent lacing was spotty and not all that noteworthy. Overall, the appearance is respectable but there was nothing memorable about it.  The nose is lovely. It was been a long while since I have had Arrogant Bastard and in my mind it has lost some of its luster for some reason. I began to think it was overrated (and it is to some degree). Well, after smelling this I have been reminded. I was wrong. Deep, romantic caramel, toffee and sweet maltiness; hints of dark fruits soaked in rum. Raisins, chocolate cake a terrific boozy oak barrel quality arrives at the end. Hops are not as robust as I would have though. Sure, I can detect their bright zippy citrus and spruce notes, which I like. IMO, the nose seems more barleywine-like than DIPA. Moderate-high potency; very chatty and articulate I love the nose! I cant wait to take a sip.  In a word (or two): Damn tasty! I cant believe this beer is only 7.2% ABV! It drinks much bigger (read: 12% ABV)! Big, boozy heat and lots of rum/vodka/bourbon flavors (but not overwhelming); big, prickly/bitter hops (lots of citrus and spruce flavors) with a finish of caramel malt. Suggestions of dark fruits are found from start to finish. The hops are very pronounced. Otherwise I dont find much more beyond taste-bud slapping alcohol, hops, and malt. Maybe I am being too simplistic. Maybe Id like more malt complexities. I love the hop profile, it is fairly complex. Unlike the nose, the palate is more DIPA-like then barleywine Im okay with that. Hell, I really like the flavor profile.  Slightly bigger than medium-full; low but natural carbonation. I like the mouthfeel; it is somewhat lazy but not sluggish. The carbonation does a great job allowing the flavors to slide over the tongue and then linger. Big aftertaste, sweet/malty with plenty of hops and oak; the combination is awesome.  I want a plate of cheese and fresh fruit. I want another bottle (or three). There is a certain malty vibe in Oaked AB that reminds me of Free States Old Backus Barleywine. Clearly though, Oaked AB is a big-ass malty DIPA. I am not down with the American Strong Ale term. WTF is it? Either it is a Barelywine or a DIPA. Simple as that. Screw labels. Is it tasty? Hell yeah. Is it drinkable? Oh, hell yes. I havent sat down and reviewed a beer this good in a long time. I needed this. Thank you, BuckeyeNation! This beer was great.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,arguemaniac,4.2,"Pours an hazy orangish copper with a fairly well-retained light tan head that eventually leaves behind a generous lace. Fruity malt sweetness with a firm orangey hop character in the aroma. In the palate a somewhat astringent citrus hop spice overshadows the otherwise firm, slightly fruity malt backbone (with a definite honey character). The distinct oaky character contributes to the complexity.  Did a side-by-side comparison of this one with the regular AB: Arrogant Bastard is slightly richer, with a better balance, while the Oaked AB is a bit smoother, more refined and slightly more complex. Both were equally enjoyable and very drinkable, especially considering how rich they are.  Anyway, recommended",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Initially a solid three fingers of dense khaki that reduced to a thin creamy foam layer. Beautiful lace grips the glass all over.  Aroma is lighter than I remember with the original. Some caramel sweetness. A little floral, citrus and a touch of pine hops. Seems similar to the original.  Taste comes through with a lot more of the oak, it has a more robust wood flavor than some of the other oak beers I've had. Lacks that harsh woodiness, which is a good thing. Caramel body again with some dinner roll malt flavors. Pine resin and light citrus hops round it out. Good stuff once again.  Nice full mouthfeel. Low carbonation doesn't overrun the flavors.

Sticky, drippy, spiderweb lacing. Aroma is fantastic right out of the bottle. Smells like the oakless Arrogant. I don't smell the oak chips but I do smell the vanilla that previous reviewers have mentioned. The Vanilla is a nice touch. Flavorwise: this isn't nearly as hoppy or brash as the Oakless Arrogant, but it is every bit as good. This is more mellowed out and balanced. There are still loads of citrus hops but the oak chips adds a perfect balance. Smooth mouthfeel but lacks the Arrogance of the origional. This is one easily quaffable beer.

Sweet floral notes with resiny pine and light citrus. Lots of woody notes, a bit of raisin and vanilla.  Taste is exceptional and complex. The woody oak really comes through nicely. Flavours reminiscent of port and some raisin. Piney and herbal hops that go into a lovely caramel malt with a bit of vanilla and biscuit in the back. Cookie-like in the finish and perhaps a bit grainy. Balance is near perfect. Mouthfeel is less dry than I thought it would be, and the carbonation is about right, medium to mild.

The beer poured the same deep amber almost brown as it's more common older brother with a similar head that left a little less lacing. The aroma was almost identical to it's brother, caramel malts and pine hops with just a hint of oak. The oak in the taste adds a truly unique quality to an already complex beer. My only problem is it adds just a slight astringency to the mouthfeel, nothing much, but enough to keep it from the 5 I gave it's brother.

A range of fruits and a sort of subtle complexity.  m: Low-medium, smooth carbonation and a medium-full body.  t: A good taste but it doesn't wow me as much as expected.

I'm not sure of the differences between the oaked and non-oaked, I would need to drink them side by side, though I do know the difference from the double. It's hard to forget the double.

Good malt, definitely subdued hop presence, but the alphas are all there. Not much aroma hops. Toasted, burnt, biscuity malts falling all over the place. There is an astrigent/medicinal effect also that I find a lot in oak-aged beers.  Mouthfeel is nice. Good carbonation, not too fizzy. Easier to drink probably than it's brother.

Nice big lasting head that covers the whole beer the entire session. Nice sticky, fluffy lacing spirals down the glass. Smell- Has a subtly sweet toffee like malt smell with gentle whiffs of vanilla. Has that familiar AB citrusy hop aroma that weve all come to know and love. Seems more subtle than the original and double. Taste- Starts with a very nice sweet caramely bite that is o so yummy. Nice grapefruity bitterness that really comes out in the aftertaste along with a very subtle vanilla/oakyness. The flavor really intensifies when it warms.

Big malty taste with a pleasant tongue stripping level of hops and astringency. Some definate oak flavors. though I think I was looking for more. Good body. Very drinkable though I find the oakiness detracts from being the ""regular"" bastard. Too little oak and too many expectations maybe. Bring on the oaked Double Bastard that has been laid down a year or two.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,JayQue,4.16,"A really fine beer. Reminded me of a barleywine...specifically a mixture of Brooklyn Monster Ale and Bigfoot qualities. Pours a very cloudy brown color with a good size tan head. Left good lacing on the glass. I was expecting a Bigfoot / Celebration Ale style smell, but the aroma was fairly mild. Taste was very good..a little maltiness up front, then a good long hops blast with grapefruit and piney flavors (very much like Bigfoot). The follow through is very smooth and malty (like Monster Ale). My first sip felt thin and watery. All cured by the second taste. Smooth, rich mouthfeel and great tasting throughout. Have to rate drinkability good. Has all the flavor of Monster Ale and Bigfoot with a much lower ABV. I wouldn't say no to a second one!!!!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,drumrboy22,3.97,"Poured from 12oz. bottle into a belgian tulip glass.  Has a brown/red color and is moderately cloudy. Nice off-white head that left lacing around the glass.  Aroma is of heavy citrus, specifically grapefruit. The aroma is fantastic.  The citrus aspect is present in the taste as well. I know this is classified as a strong ale, but it tastes borderline barleywine or DIPA. Heavy hops with moderate malt to balance. Subtle vanilla flavors present. Not as chewy as other oaked beers, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Finish is very long and quite bitter.  Highly enjoyable beer from Stone. I'm glad they decided to release this in 12oz. bottles last time around.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Boppar,3.28,"Substantially better than Arrogant Bastard.  Pours from a bottle into a snifter a nice brown color, with some red in there, too.  Smells mostly like beer. Also some non-descript fruity sweetness. Orange rind. Maybe maple syrup? Who knows.  The taste is not as complex as I had hoped. I enjoyed the woody dry finish and to a lesser extent, the nuttiness.  The mouthfeel tended to be thin and overly-carbonated, but thankfully the latter subsided over the course of the beer.  Sessionable? Absolutely not.  Interesting concept, decent flavor. Good, but I had higher hopes.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,kajerm,3.83,"11.2 fluid ounces of bastardly beer, which informs me of the usual arrogant nonsense and also that the label contains cadmium and may cause birth defects. Way to go, Stone!  Pours medium-brown and hazy with a slight reddish cast. Mostly fine lacing carbonation with some aesthetically-pleasing patches of big bubble bath CO2.  The smell is fairly simple, a bit of vanilla, maple syrup, medium-roasted malts, dark fruit, and some esters. Nice smell, didn't blow my doors off.  Taste is initially malty, with some mid-palate nuttiness (or at least I think it was nuttiness), oak grows stronger until it dominates. Finishes with a bit of amarillo hops, surprisingly dry.  The mouthfeel is light but a bit creamy; unusual but kind of nice.  I wouldn't be able to put away a sixer of these while watching the game, though.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Tyrawlings,4.1,12 oz. Bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: Dark brown in color with deep ruby red hues. Dense off white head pours two fingers thick with good retention. Excellent spider web like lacing that creeps all over the glass.  S: Floral. Sweet malts. Citrus. Asprin. Bread. Soft wet earth.  T: Slightly sweet malts are immediately taken over by an herbal and pine hop bitterness that tickles the tongue. A citrus juice presence is followed by slightly roasted sweet caramel malts and the taste of earth. Tea like taste is overlapped by a soft oak finish.  M: Creamy and smooth. Moderate carbonation. Slightly warming and dry.  D: Truely an enjoyable brew. Perfectly balanced and comlex. The subtle oak finish was the winning point for this beer. Insanely drinkable and dangerous. Highly recommend.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,SPLITGRIN,4.01,"I have been waiting a long time for this one to come to Indiana and I finally got ahold of a six-pack of 12oz. bottles.  A vigorous pour shows amazing carbonation for an oak aged beer. The result is a huge three finger rich tan head with big fat bubbles. It sits atop a warm dark brown body. Leaves lots of lace.  Nose is sweetly hoppy but a bit mor subdued from the oak agging. Woodsy oak notes are very fresh.  As it hits your mouth this is definitly different, Bitter isnt as floral, but sharp. Leads to a very raw wood meets shoe polish kind of mouth feel. It is odd how the oak brought out the oil in the hops. Very elementaly woodsy overall. I think this one drinks better on the colder side. I'll stick with the original.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,BuckeyeNation,4.8,"Oaked Arrogant Bastard is a stupendous shade of sunset coral when viewed with bright sunshine behind the glass. Fat slices of tangerine orange can be seen at the edges and are a perfect color complement to the rest of the beer. The thickly creamy head (that is somewhere between pale caramel, pastel orange and golden beige) manages to slather the glass with butter-like streamers of lace. This is a gorgeous ale.  The nose is equally as good and reminds me of a caramel malty IPA, or even a DIPA, that contains boatloads of pungent, citric zesty, spruce-like hops... which is pretty much what Arrogant Bastard is. I don't remember this much fruitiness in the standard AB, but it has been a while since I treated myself to a bomber. Strangely enough, I can't really appreciate the oakiness in the nose.  My palate must have undergone a few changes (development, I hope) since my last Stone AB because the beer isn't the crazed bitter bomb that my memory tells me it was. Actually, it's more delicous than I remember. Whether that has anything to do with the oak chips is hard to say. I was almost ready to say that I can't appreciate oak on the palate either when... hot damn... there is it, making a big splash on the finish.  The beginning and middle portions of each mouthful are dominated by huge flavors of caramel, white grapefruit pith, bitter orange and pine sap. There's nothing better than Chinook unleashed. Rarely have I tasted a more aggressive ale that is so well-behaved in the mouth. Immediately after the swallow is where the caramelized sugar and oak make their move and turn a great beer into a phenomenal one.  I didn't think it was possible, but warming brings about an even greater intensity. Anyone who thinks this beer or its un-oaked brother is overrated is completely off his or her rocker. This is big beer that was brewed with bourbon-loving hopheads in mind. Since that describes me perfectly, it's no surprise that I'm in awe of what Stone has done.  How could the body/mouthfeel be anything less than fantastic? It's as firm as polished granite and is equally as smooth. It also possesses a luscious creaminess that promotes gulping rather than sipping. I find that I'm drinking waaay too fast, as much for how the beer feels as for how it tastes. Well, maybe not.  I'd have to drink Arrogant Bastard Ale and Oaked AB side by side to determine how much they actually differ. My guess is that the oak chips definitely add something of value. I did a little jig when I found out that Stone decided to release this beer in user-friendly 12 oz. bottles. I'm doing an even more enthusiastic jig now that I've had it. Smashing stuff.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,kpantz,3.78,"Executive Summary: So this one is typically love it or hate it. Well, I'm in the middle. It's good, but it's not a favorite. Interesting flavor profile and very nice structure to it. I definitely recommend folks give this a try.  Appearance: Pours a deep, murky molasses color, with ruby highlights, into my snifter with a moderate khaki head. Nice lacing.  Smell: Malt presence, but very unsweet with a noticeable hop aroma and perhaps a hint of woodiness in the nose. Almost has a character of a long-aged barleywine.  Taste: In a word, the flavor is sharp. The oak is quite obvious, laying itself across everything else that may have otherwise played a more significant role. Underneath that, you're treated to an initial sweetness, however short-lived, that transitions to bitterness and dances there at several levels. A fruity character also hangs around throughout the sip.  Mouthfeel: Very clean feeling - little in the way of carbonation and just chewy enough to make you slice your way through the different flavors. I feel like I'm unfolding different flavors as I work it around.  Drinkability: Given the sharp nature of this one, I don't think I'd have more than one in a sitting. That said, it's an enjoyable ale and one that will get you talking.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,nlmartin,4.15,Since the release of Oaked Bastard in the 12 ounce bottle I have drank alot of Bastard. The beer was served in a Imperial Nonic.  Appearance: The beer has a dark coppery amber coloration. The head is a creamy biege coloration. The head was two fingers high and resolved to a thin creamy foam. The beer left thick lacing behind on my glass.  Smell: The beer has very pleasing pine and earthy hops. These combine well with toasted caramel and vanilla oak. This is a much more restrained Bastard than I remember.  Taste: The beer has pine resin hops cutting across the flavor. The ber also has a load of caramel and vanilla maltyness. The finish is slightly earthy and bitter. This is dam good stuff!  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is slightly bigger than medium bodied. The beer has a very creamy finish. This is a very drinkable and tasty beer. This is one Bastard who is always welcome in my house!,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,macster,3.81,"Pours a slightly hazy deep mahogany-red color. Creates a tight, pillowy 1/2"" beige head with strong retention. Patterns of thick lacing adhere to the sides of the snifter.  Aromas in general were surprisingly restrained for such a complex beer. However, pleasant notes of pine and hops resin, oak, earth, toffee and some faint vanilla waft gently up from the glass.  Mouthfeel starts very smooth and creamy with a soft carbonation level. Goes down with a slight oily texture.  Flavor much bolder than the aroma. Very complex and nuanced. Initally notes of sweet caramel malts, brown sugar, vanilla bean and buckwheat honey greet the tongue. This is very quickly replaced with a very agressive grapefruit rind and wood tannin-like bitterness which immediately deletes any sense of lingering sweetness. I like hops but felt more of a sugary malt contribution would have balanced the flavors out better.  Finishes dry and crisp with a long, lingering bitterness. For only 7.2% this beer is a mouthfull.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,BeerTruth,4.38,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  The Arrogant Bastard that happened to be Oaked poured a beautiful dark copper/amber hue with a think khaki colored head. Lace stuck to the glass throughout the entire tasting. I really thought this would have a powerful overwhelming smell, but to me, this was quite subtle. The smell is much more malty/oaky than the normal Bastard. Maybe because it's because I'm a hophead that the odor doesn't stand out to me. Taste is absolutely amazing, mild bitter hops bite the tongue but is quickly diminished by the wonderful malty/vanilla oak flavors. The feel is quite smooth with a much more carbonated feel to it than I had anticipated. Very drinkable brew, I was quite pleased with not nearly as much bite as Arrogant Bastard. I have always been a big fan of the original Bastard and have never had much experience in oaked brews, but I actually prefer this over the original because of its drinkability. I plan on experiencing more oaked brews thanks to Stone. Definitely give this one a try if you have the chance.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,WanderingFool,3.63,"Oaked Arrogant Bastard pours a hazy mahogany color with a two fingered size creamy light tan head on top. The foam dissolves slowly down to a thin sheet on the beer leaving behind thick clumps of netted lace on the glass. An mild aroma of oak, with hoppy notes of apricot and orange citrus hovers over the beer.  This medium to full bodied beer is soft on the palate and slightly chewy with a light fizz on the tip of the tongue. The flavor begins a bit fruity with some apricot notes. Hoppy flavors of orange citrus quickly take over and there's a presence of caramel malt balancing out the hops. Throughout each sip is a presence of oak that helps soften all the hops. The beer finishes dry leaving behind some citrus hop flavors.  I thought this beer was well balanced and not nearly has hoppy as the regular arrogant bastard.

Pours out a pretty bland, murky, muddy tawny color, but with good lacing and a nicely layered dirty head.  Thoughout, there is a balance of sweet layered malts, highlighted at this point by a nice chewy choco-caramel, replacing the apricots of a few months ago. Good bitterness, never abrasive or even up-front. Just a perfect balance and compliment to the malt.  I have no idea how someone could say that this is ""no different"" than the regular AB, especially when this beer bears only a superficial reseblance to its own incarnation of a few months ago.

A much darker smell than non-oaked Bastard - still strong but not a sweet.  T - Now this is a bitter beer. Man. This is difficult to express. Tastes just wonderful, but it's hard to drink. Oak is most prominent at the end, leaving a wonderful smoky aftertaste. I wonder if it isn't my ignorance toward this style of beers that is making this difficult - I believe this is my first oaked beer. Lots of hops up front but that oak is already doing it's work - it's like a heavy, muffled taste. This beer is making me think and now 2/3 of the way through I'm still finding new things. Incredible  M - Very heavy and chewy mouthfeel. This beer fights back.  D - Now I don't know how to review this. You want to drink this beer - it is delicious.

So, a year later, when I saw the Oaked AB, I thought I'd give it another shot, to see if my tastes had changed.  Well, they may have changed but I still don't care for the beer that much. Aside from a very, very slight hint of vanilla in the nose, I didn't find much oakiness in this beer.  Looked good, aromas were definite hop bomb, flavor was very bitter but not much else.

147,8951,Domingo,4.07,"This is my last bottle of some I bought in November. I've had 5 over the course of a few months and I haven't noticed a change. You know, after all of the talk of this beer, I didn't really think it was much different or better than the normal Arrogant Bastard. With that said, it's still a really good beer. I guess the issue is that it's about twice the price and is (or was) somewhat rare. The oak aging gives it a cloudy look and it feels like a thicker texture, but compared to oak aged stouts and porters, I didn't really pick up a lot of new flavor nuances. There might be some vanilla in there, but the hops don't seem to blend with it, but more cover it up. I think some of the hops and alcohol have mellowed out a little bit to make it more drinkable, but beyond that it's not that different. The hops are still the star of the show. I think I might pick up some different flavors in the taste, but they're subtle to the point that I can't identify them. Maybe a taste test between this and normal AB would serve me well, but right now it's just a mellowed out version of a beer I already like. If you can't find this beer, I'd suggest going after the normal Arrogant Bastard. It's a little more harsh, but the color's nicer.  (EDIT) After trying this on tap, I have to say that it's WORLDS better. A nearly masterpiece actually.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Nice, but not big.  Juicy semi-sweet malt spills across the tongue. Surprisingly quick hop bite before the oak rises to the top and rides the beer into the swallow and on to the aftertaste.  Good solid medium-plus mouthfeel. Good drinkability, particularly if you like ""oak"".  The impression I get is that the oak wood chips nullified the hops, removing the wonderous abrasiveness of ""plain ol' Arrogant Bastard"".

Ample lace.  S: Grapefruit, wood, and cork aromas. Nice interplay between the citrusy hops and the oak.  T: Bitter citrus hops that are countered by a lightly sweet maltiness. The malt also takes a turn from sweet to toasted and leads straight into the flavors of oak. The oak is a compelling addition to this beer. It takes off some of the ""rawness"" that is very prevalent in the standard Arrogant Bastard.  M: Much smoother than standard AB. Spicy on the tongue and the hops have a pleasant resinous quality.  D: I found this to be a more enjoyable version of AB. The addition of oak chips sands off a lot of the raggedness of AB making it even more drinkable.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Very nice, rich brown with ruby highlights and a half-inch eggshell head. Fascinating aroma; starts with a heavy hit of spicy, piney hops, which is immediately followed by a good whiff of vanilla, damp wood, and earth.  Taste is very well balanced, with more of the previously mentioned flavours plus a little more citrus hops. Surprisingly sweet aftertaste, probably from the ""oak-ing"". Solid mouthfeel, and very drinkable at this ABV.  I liked this a lot -- similar to the original AB, but different enough to make it worth seeking out on it's own.

147,8951,RedHaze,4,"Thanks to jhammerly for this 12oz bottle.  Pours a dark opaque brown with a frothy two finger head that fades slowly to a soapy cap and ring. The lacing is thick, and very sticky.  Smell; citric hops are present just as they are in the regular Bastard, and the oaky vanillin aromas come out nicely. There's also a nice caramel malt backround in there as well.  Taste; citric hops and caramel malts almost compete a bit for dominance in there, with the hops coming out slightly ahead. The oak and vanilla flavors are definitely present, and really tone down the ""Arrogance"" of the regular beer. While this is a really good beer, personnally I prefer the regular Arrogant Bastard to this version.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability; the mouthfeel on this one is medium to full bodied with a bit of a drying effect that I assume is from the oak.

Good amount of carbonation. Truly a beautiful color.  S - Much different than I anticipated. Caramelized malt with a strong hop presence backed up by orange and piney notes. Hmm...  T - Definitely a noticable difference from the regular AB. Not as hoppy as the aroma hinted, but a slight bitterness was still present. Oaked flavors come out, met by vanilla, raisins, & plums...caramel malt still a strong flavor. Very nice, but I was expecting more wood flavors.  M - Very strong finish...body is a little thinner than I would have liked, but still a strong aftertaste.

I find oaked aged beers to have a watery, or thin appearance, this one was no exception. Not quite the beast in appearance as it's descendent, but a hell of a lot more complex. Crazy notes of Riesling, and sherry rich mellowness on the tongue. Warming on through the nose, with a cracking scotch-like inhalation.  As time as gone on Stone beers have leveled a bit for me. The BA hype, the reality that it's a nationwide ""micro"", and a ridiculous fanatic fan base, have all been factors.

The smell is hoppy and very nice. I think I smell caramel also. The taste is also slightly similar to regular bastard but smoother. I am not sure if I can taste the oak but this definitely tastes awesome. The mouthfeel might be the best part; very creamy.

147,8951,InsolublePancake,4.23,"A- Very similar to regular Arrogant Bastard with its garnet hue, big off-white head and nice sticky lacing. There is, perhaps, more of a touch of brown around the edges of the glass.  S- Sweet hoppy goodness! Hops hit you first with citrus and pine notes. The malt is also very present as caramel aromas abound. The malt and hops combine with fruity esters and perhaps a touch of vanilla to form a very nice aroma.  T- Mmm, definitely a bit different than regular Bastard. Big malt and hop flavors are there, but their intensity is somewhat muted. The bitterness, likewise, is not as strong, although not weak by any means. Definite oaky, vanilla tones on the finish, which are quite pleasant.  M- Great mouthfeel. I think this is the area that was improved the most by the oak aging. Incredibly smooth, even a bit creamy. Exceptional.  D- Pretty high due to its smoothness. Alcohol is a bit high and it's certainly not a session beer. Other than that, it's great. I'd have a couple.  There aren't really any striking differences between this and regular Arrogant Bastard. What differences exist are pretty subtle. I can't really say it's an improvement, but it's certainly very good in its own right.

It smells of pineapple, sweet mango, grapefruit, guava, caramel?, and some toasted malts. It has a medium to high bitterness with lots of tropical hops on the palate, contributing mango, guava, papaya, pineapple, and white grapefruit, with piney/green notes appearing later. In addition there are toasted/caramel malts and oak that is more of a presence than an actual flavor, along with perhaps some vanilla. The body is medium to thick with medium carbonation and a tannic dryness that begins light but becomes stronger, and it leaves a long finish. It is pretty drinkable, but perhaps I was expecting more. It is still a good beer, and one that utilizes hops nicely.

147,8951,asabreed,4.42,"12 oz. bottle into a snifter.  Appearance: Looks like the bastard I think I know, with a ruddy body and some nice spidery lacing pushing itself around the glass. A lot of nice thin and spread out spots begin to form with some sips, which makes it better.  Smell: Apricot and fruity sweetness dominate, I think, from the oak chips. The aroma, however, is completely floral, vanilla, citrus hops, cream, strawberry, woodiness, smoke, and the end aroma of slightly toasted malt.  Taste: I love what the oak does to this as far as balance: apricot dominates, with some strawberry, vanilla, cream, woodiness, slight smoke, slight roasted chocolate, a bit of citrus and lemongrass, and the finish initially dominated by hops into a long finish where the creaminess lingers with the fruit slowly behind, lingering on the tongue with a tinge of bitter hops before the apricot dominates at the finish, along with some oakiness, breadiness, slight chocolate, and cream making it an ultimately, and surprisingly unsuspecting, dessert beer. For real? That's what I'm getting.  Mouthfeel: Maybe it's the complexity of the brew, but I feel like there's too much carbonation right now, albeit just a bit. It's not bad with everything else that's going on, and it doesn't take away from it that much, but who knows, maybe some years could do great things.  Drinkability: Even though this is chips instead of barrel, they're certainly doing a lot for the beer, and improving upon a beer that's already pretty fantastic. Don't let anyone tell you that it's the barrel way or the highway. Sorry, silly joke. At any rate, this is a fantastic beer that, even in its greenness, has improved a great deal, or has even discovered some unforseen beautiful things along the way. In my opinion, worth the high price tag, even if it is around $15 for a six pack. I was a skeptic, but right now I'm a believer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,oakbluff,4.55,"Bottle courtesy of HogTown Harry via trade- much thanks Harry! I poured the twelve ounce bottle into a tumber- looks similar to normal AB- a little cloudy, deep caramel with an off white. Also smells typical AB, sweet, but the wood is noticable. Taste is just fantastic- in your face hoppy, but with a great malt backbone and the oakey flavour. The oak is defintely there- but not overpowering. It reminded me of the oak in Old Yeti. I think it really matches well with the style of AB. Mouthfeel is of a great body, medium carbonation and bitter/woody finish. I could drink many of these- but alas this is my only bottle.

147,8951,BassAssassin,4.17,"--2006 Vintage--  A: Pours a hazy, reddish brown. Thick, off white head that lasts until mid glass.  S: Sweet and fruity with subtle hints of vanilla. Malt aroma dominates. However, a citrusy hop smell balances nicely.  T: Complex, caramel malt flavors with slight hints of fruit, vanilla, and oak. Citrusy and spicy hop flavors round everything out. Finishes dry, almost astringent. A little too dry in my opinion, though still excellent. Aging this might mellow it out perfectly.  M: Medium bodied with perfect level of carbonation. Very smooth and balanced. Excellent mouthfeel.  D: Higher ABV prevents this from being a session beer, but it's very drinkable nonetheless. Great balance definitely helps. I'd love to see what a year in the cellar does to this brew. A side by side comparison with the standard Arrogant Bastard is a must, also.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,biegaman,4.35,"Barley isn't really all that interesting to look at. I've never caught myself gazing at a pile of grain, lost in thought while staring at little granules of cereal. But heat 'em up enough and there's serious beauty contained in those kernels - Oaked Arrogant Bastard, like the standard, has clear, attention-grabbing garnet highlights and a deep, muscovado sugar brown body worthy of gawking at.  Same goes for the aroma! I'm fixated. Grasping all these different flavours at once is as hard as catching a greased watermelon. The bouquet is so intricate that distinguishing individual components isn't difficult but also altogether unnecessary; figgy, caramelly, toasted malt blends with bright, ripe citrus fruits while dank forest herbals combine with oak and vanilla. There's also a distinct 'umami' dimension.  Not only was Arrogant Bastard the first of its kind - an originator among bold, brazen, distinctively American strong ales - the Oaked version, introduced in 2004, was at the forefront of what became a massive industry trend of barrel-aging. Mind you, this one never sees the inside of an actual barrel - it's aged on wood chips. Neither method is superior to the other; each yields subtle differences...  The use of oak chips definitely rounds out some of Arrogant Bastard's notoriously herbal, hoppy edges, placating the resinous pine-like bitterness with subtle vanilla notes as well as clear flavours of the wood itself. These elements bring out more of the malt, which smacks of toffee and treacle. A physical barrel might have done the same but likely taken us down a rougher, more distorted path.  So how does the Oaked version compare to the original? Not easy to say. The caramelly sweetness of the malt definitely has more room to stretch out, though the characteristic spruce and pine notes of the hops are omnipresent as ever, their woodsy, forest-y qualities are actually accentuated by the oak chips. Also, big fat grapefruit wedges appear in the finish like juicy, pulpy figures from the shadows.  Both original Arrogant Bastard and its Oaked variation blew my mind when first trying them - for a conventional beer drinker there's really no point of comparison and even in the craft realm few examples spring to mind (certainly of this quality). While nothing ever compares to a memory - this isn't as good as I remember it - more than a decade later, cracking open a bottle still feels like a special treat.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Phyl21ca,3.83,Bottle courtesy of Beerandblues2: Poured a dark brown color ale with a nice medium brown foamy head with good retention. Aroma of citrus hops with some nice caramel malt. Taste is sweeter then expected with lots of caramel malt and a medium bitter finish with some citrusy hops. Body is definitely above average with some medium carbonation. I thought the oak presence was quite subtle and overall this is more reminiscent to a barleywine then an American Strong Ale but enjoyable nonetheless.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,monkeynaut,4.42,"A: Pours nice, a good orange-gold sort of look about it. A dark-cream head is a bit thin, likely due to my bad pour into a pint glass.  S: Has a unique, almost-apple scent about it, certainly not an off-putting aroma. A good deal more enticing than many similar beers I've tried.  T: Hot Dog, we have a wiener. A brisk beer with enough complexity to lend an interesting taste without being overly hoppy (I'm not a huge hop head, for point of disclosure). Some slight vanilla aftertaste, possibly from the oak.  M: Feels great, not too harsh but it's got enough bite to remind your that you're drinking a real beer with a slightly elevated ABV. Will not overwhelm you, even after a couple of pints.  D: You can drink this all day long, period. A solid, balanced beer that will appeal to both beer enthusiasts and casual drinkers alike.

Smelt of strong fresh pineapple, mango, and other tropical fruit, some light oak and caramel.  Taste was upfront strong bittersweet grapefruit and light fruit punch sweetness followed by a strong roasted grain and oak bitter taste with some light fruity sweetness on a long bitter hops finish. Palate was medium bodied, watery yet a bit oily, softly carbonated and moderately astringent.  Overall, the aroma is divine. The flavor delivers, and, although surprisingly light on the palate, it balances out the strong flavors.

147,8951,neonbrown82,4.2,"I'm quite surprised by how different the oak chips have made my beloved bastard. Thanks to Zorro for the bottles.  The beer pours to a very dark nutty brownish ruby color. Plenty of creamy off-white head, and excellent retention. Lacing sticks to the glass quite well. Very little apparent carbonation.  The smell is great. Huge berry and vanilla oakiness. It damn near dulls the perception of any other aromas. Only a feint hint of the intense chinook hoppiness of the the regular bastard. Has a creamy, malty aroma hidden beneath the oak chips as well. Quite a different beast (or bastard), indeed.  The taste is great. Not quite as much of the rough cohumulone chinnook bitterness of the original bastard, but in exchange it has extract a rough tannic astringency from the oak chips. I like it, however. The oak also imparts a more of a berry-like fruitiness not present in the regular. Smooth and creamy malt flavors up front followed by a strong vanilla bean character and a well rounded lingering hops flavor. Lots of tannins in the finish, as well as a bit of a piny bitterness and chocolate. A hint of smoke as well. Perhaps they charred the oak chips?  The body is fairly full and creamy. The carbonation has been smoothed out a bit. The tannins from the oak are a bit harsh, however. Drinkability suffers as a result. It would be a real treat to drink it every once in a while, and it is easily more complex and interesting than the regular bastard, but four out of five times, I would probably opt to drink the regular. That being said, I am very stoked by this beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Leaves nice lacing rings.  S - Smell does have some vanilla character, obviously imparted from the wood over that harsh AB smell. Smells nice, giving it a fruitier aroma than the original AB. The smell overall is more subdued. is that a plus or minus? Neither, but a different, aofter smell.  T - The oak has imparted a woody, roasted flavor to the brew. In addition, the flavor has mellowed somewhat, making the AB a little less aggressive. Definitely a pleasant/different experience.  M - Nice full, creamy body.  D - Interesting to say the least. A nice sipper to relax with.  Notes: Pretty damn good. Not better than AB, not worse than AB, simply a brew with some subtle changes.

147,8951,Atlas1,4,"Hello, Oak. Nice to meet ya'.  Poured from the bottle into a belgian snifter. This beer has an alluring appearance. Sort of an opaque, brown-apricot color, with a creamy one-finger head that dissipates a bit too soon. Leaves traces of lace along the side of the glass, but nothing terribly intricate. The aroma is pleasant. Oaky, for sure, but with some subtle hints of undetectable fruit. Maybe some vanilla, maybe some molasses? The taste is where the OAB shines, though. Malty and sweet up front, with definite oak notes. But the hops strike hard and fast, cutting through just about everything else and leaving a trail of grapefruit and pine down the back of the throat. Wow. What a lip-smacker this is. I really, really like the way this beer tastes. Sturdy, if not overwhelming mouthfeel. It's been a while since my last Arrogant Bastard, but I can't imagine why after having this one. This just made my top-20 list of American craft brews. I'm definitely not worthy....",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,scruffwhor,3.51,"Bought at Parti-Pak Liqours in Indy. I got there last three 12oz bottles. The next Time I went in there, they had a big ass magnum of the stuff on sale for about $60.  My first Oaked Arrogant Bastard.... Ohhh joyous day.  Appearance- Reminds me of a Peruvian Walnut I saw at the local exotic wood store some 2 months back. Light tan head that hngs around for awhile, but digresses to a thick foam. Very light bubbling, but some sporadic lacing sticks fast to my pint glass.  Smell- For a second or two, it smelled like BO and bananas. The Bo subsides greatly after a few more sniffs. The hops mixes a bit oddly with the oak in this offereing. Give the beer an aroma tha isn't as flattering as expected. The bananas was really of putting but unique though.  Taste- Hops and oak come together in an odd marriage. Not as pleasing as I expected. The first flavor is that of stinky, Pacific hops the lend an almost musty bitterness. The oak kicks in a little later in the middle of the palate. The some bitter bisciut hit you right after the oak and its light vanilla nuance towards the end.  Very unique, ans still worth the tiume and effort to come by it. But it definetly wasn't the orgasmic brew I had expected. I'll save one bottle for aging, with no time limit set at the moment. I will get back to you on how that turns out.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Damian,4.2,"Drank from a 12 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Mall Discount Liquors, Cambridge, MA  Poured a hazy, crimson-mahogany with a one-finger, light tan, sea foam head. The head slowly faded to a thin film with a thick ring of lace. Tons of lacing cascaded down the sides of the glass.  Aroma was quite sweet, fruity and well balanced. A nice mix of caramel malts and ripe fruits along with fragrant, floral hops and citrusy, cascade hops.  The taste was interesting and complex and changed drastically as it moved along the palate. Sweet, rich, caramel malts up front before the sharp alcohol bite kicked in. As the beer warmed, the alcohol seemed to subside considerably. Intense cascade hops contributed to the juicy, grapefruit-like flavor on the back end. The finish was super hoppy, puckering and bitter (but not overly so).  The mouthfeel was beautiful. Lush, creamy and pillowy with enough body to keep the beer settled on my palate.  The drinkability of this beer was quite good. After sitting, the 7.2% ABV was only moderately detectable. Furthermore, this is a very versatile beer and could pair well with nutty chesses, grilled foods, or simply stand on its own.  As for a comparison with the non-oaked version, this beer seemed to possess aromas and flavors that were smoother, softer and, overall, more enjoyable.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Maybe even a little numbness in the mouth. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is very easy.

147,8951,barleywinebrewer,3.23,Kudos to Stone for joining the raging oak trend. I love what oak can do for a beer. I had a hard time with this one though. There was too much going on. The hops dominated my brew and really didn't seem to let much of the oak or malt body come through. Maybe aging will help but to me that seems a cop out and my score is reflective of my tasting. I preferred the regular AB to this one. Apparently I am not worthy per the bottle:-),Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Perfect balance between hops and malt with a bit of vanilla.  Hops hit good and hard with carmal and pine following. The vanilla comes through, guess thats what I'm associating the oak with.  Feels like this should be around all year. But if that was the case how often would I have an AB and would I really appreciate the oak?

147,8951,GimmeAles,4.55,"Pours the color of a tarnished copper still and develops a creamy, 3-finger head in the tulip glass. Recedes to a tenacious ring that leaves moderate lacing.  Smells familiarly Bastardly - wonderfully piney, and grapefruit-like with a minty-herbal edge. Smooth and seductive vanilla-bean shows through, and then a faint caramely character appears.  Taste is a wave of citrusy, piney hops at first  a wonderful, herbal bouquet of grapefruit and the floor of an evergreen forest. Herbal character is strong (mint and maybe lavender again are suggested) and give a perfume-like effervescence. Burnt toffee and caramel give a sturdy, slightly smoky malt-backbone that is huge considering how it balances the hops. The finish comes back to a crisp hoppiness. Ohhh, and dry oak was in the finish.  Full and luxurious in the mouth and a very pleasant sipper. Fine, active conditioning gives the hop bitterness a nudge, but nothing distracting (its an Arrogant Bastard, after all!). Its a pleasure to see the Oak-character develop as it warms and the oak is done is a noticeable but not overpowering way, giving a refined edge to the Bastard.

147,8951,GolgiIPAratus,3.48,"Sampled: 1.5.07  Appearance of this brew is of reddish liquefied light caramel underneath a thick head. Head is dense and colored of a darker shade of eggnog. Some lacing clings.  The aroma is quite hoppy, full of juicy citrus notes. A quite peculiar and unique quality comes through on deeper inhalations, that seems to be a rich earthy honey like smell. And I mean, like, real honey; as in straight from the hive. I can only assume this comes from the wood aging, as it does not smell of what I remember from regular AB.  The flavor is immediately bitter, the particular style of hops jumping up, no doubt. The earthy honey sweetness comes though, and balances with the hop fruitiness. Its carbonation is in the mid range and coats the mouth with hop oiliness.  The beer is quite rich and a slow drinker, one 12 ouncer was more than enough. I liked it, but I didnt think it really improved upon Arrogant Bastard, so I most likely wont get it again. With a tag of oak aging, I was hoping for more complexity. The unique aroma & flavor described, really wasnt that appealing to me, so I was let down somewhat in that respect.

Creamy, light brown head that lingers as a thick sheet and cakes the wine glass' sides. Very durable, ringed and spotted lacing around the entire glass.  Semi-sweet light cream, honey, and vanilla. Mild toffee and a generous whaff of brown sugar. Rounded, vinous fruity esters: apple, grape; even tones of honeydew. Dry hints of oak and just a touch of sharp alcohol.  Light hints of tartness provided by some fruity esters: orange, apple, and melon. The malt character soon overtakes what is left of the citric flavors, and gives a creamy milk chocolate and light caramel flavor profile. An assertive hop bite with dry tones from the oak leave a surprisingly creamy, yet earthen aftertaste.  Full in body; creamy, earthen, and smooth. Even though there's a lot going on in this Strong Ale, it's very well rounded and proportioned.  Although I really enjoy the regular bastard, the wood chips adds some complexity in flavor and masks the alcohol even more.

147,8951,Kendo,4.17,"A: Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an oversized wine glass, it yields a slightly hazy brownish-amber body with mahogany highlights and a 1/2-finger tan head that quickly recedes to a thin sheet. Some clumps of lacing stick to the side of the glass with each sip and slowly crawl down the side of the glass back to the beer.  S: Malty scents up front -- grainy, toasted cereal and caramel -- and then wet oak. Some hints of vanilla as it warms, as well as pine. A real nice nose to it.  T: Dominated at first by oak -- young oak, it seems. Hops make themselves known in a metallic, minerally tang at the end of each sip, but the lingering taste is still oak. As it warms (and your palate gets a tad bit adjusted to that oak taste), it becomes fruitier and sweeter, with caramel and a hint of vanilla peaking through at the start of each sip. Alcohol spice also becomes evident as it warms, and I can begin to feel the alcohol warmth on the way down. Even as it warms, however, it's still real oaky at the finish, leaving a lingering taste of wood -- at times I felt it was pine, perhaps from the hops? -- but mainly just plain oak.  M: Medium-bodied and fairly low in carbonation. Pretty smooth all around in feel despite the dominant oaky flavors that really assault the mouth. Feels even smoother as it warms.  D: Good. Not ""very good"" (a 4.5 in my books) or ""excellent"" (a 5), but good. The oak feels young and is just too dominant, methinks, to make this an easy-drinking quaffing ale. In many ways it mellowed as it warmed and became easier to drink towards the bottom of the glass. I'll keep that in mind and let the bottle warm up a bit next time. . . .  Notes: I was mildly disappointed with this beer -- my 100th review on BA -- as it tastes right now. I paid $15.99 for a 6-pack, have enjoyed the regular AB in the past, love pretty much all the Stone offerings and have heard some pretty nice reviews (here and from friends); so maybe my expectations were a tad bit too high. I thought the oak imparted just too much of an astringent woodsy flavor -- I definitely get the sense that this somewhat harsh, acidic flavor came from oak chips rather than the more mellow experience that would come from barrels. Perhaps some aging will allow that caramel and vanilla flavor to come out more, and like I said, next time I'll try it a little bit warmer. Still a very good beer with the oak being an interesting addition, it's just not another awe-inspiring concoction from Stone.

Nose is of sharp pine, contrasted with sweet malt that reminds me of sugary cherries that have no trace of tartness whatsoever.

Develops some biscuity character and more easily detected oak as it sets up.  Taste - the bastard is as good as ever. Solid, heavy malt flavor in front, quickly layered with piny, resinous hops. The oak provides a soft edge more than an in your face oak or whiskey effect. It's great.The swallow gives rise to the full hop profile, going bitter with grapefruit rind and drying the palate considerably. The finish is just vaguely warm of alcohol, but mostly just a subdued hop burn.  Mouthfeel - smooth as can be, the carbonation is ramped up to match the intensity of flavors here - good idea.  Drinkability - a fun six pack to enjoy and share. Don't know if I'd buy it again, but it's one well put together brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,bluejacket74,4.17,"Served in a snifter, the beer pours a reddish/brown, with a small tan head. It smells like citrusy and piney hops, some wood (oak), and caramel. It tastes like bitter hops, wood/oak, and a bit of sweet malt. Not too bad. It starts bitter, then is sweet, then has a bitter lingering hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy, and also a bit oily. The drinkability is good, but not great. It's still a good beer, but I like the regular Arrogant Bastard Ale better.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,CH3CH2OH,4.35,"Thanks Akorsak for the trade.  Pours a deep, rich reddish gold with a tan, long lasting head. Aroma wasn't impressive by itself, but has a subtle depth that works well with the taste. Citrus and faint wood. Hops upfront with a strong malt backbone, a dry finish, then the wood comes out at the very end. Long lasting aftertaste, as if dry hopping is going on in my mouth. Very round and satisfying mouthfeel, more substantial than most IPAs, medium carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, even with the strong palate of flavors.  Very reminiscent of European beers. Strong but balanced with layers of depth.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,ElGordo,4.47,"Poured from the 12oz bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Body is a pretty color somewhere between orange and brown, with bright orange highlights. Head is rich and creamy, tan in color, and subsides to a fairly thin ring within oments of pouring. Nose is full of rich, roasted malt, more than a little oak, and faint notes of dark fruit. Palate is very nice - sweet caramel and dark malts up front, with notes of brown sugar, plum, and raisin. A hint of light, grassy hops peeks through for just a moment, before yielding again to the superb maltiness. Finish is again sweet and malty, showcasing the oak quite nicely. Mouthfeel is superb - rich and creamy, like velvet. A slow-sipping treasure, much better from the bottle than on draft.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,ChillMike,4.11,"A: Pours a dark ruby red with a nice frothy light tan head that sticks around and leaves plenty of nice lacing all around the glass.  S: A sweet smell of malts, chocolate, and just enough citrusy hop to round out.  T: Definite taste of wood, lots of very bitter hops, dark chocolate flavors float around in the mouth almost dancing with the hops. A good beer with a nice twist.  M: A little thicker than I expected but compliments the taste and carbonation is spot on. Not much to complain about here.  D: A little strong on the flavor to drink too many of these, but I don't think that's the point. It's perfect for what it is, a ""novelty"" (and I use that term very loosely) beer that's released only once a year.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,jeffjfindley,4.5,"The gargoyle comes through yet again...  The appearance is the same deep cherry mahogany we've come to adore from big brother, but has a more substantial head, and crazy sticky lacing. The difference on the nose and tongue is subtle, but definitely noticeable. The taste and smell are slightly smoky, in addition to the profound hop conviction it posesses. The malt flavor is of caramel and dark fruits, and the finish slightly nutty.  My palate is very well soothed by this gem of a brew. I think that it is well served by the oak aging, as it seems to smooth the flavor profile out a bit. As much as I like the original, I feel that the malt and hop textures are better reconciled with the oak.

147,8951,Wildman,4.23,"This beer poured a very dark red amber color and formed a huge off white foamy head that subsided slowly leaving latticed lace. Very little carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, caramel, vanilla and a hit of the wood chips. Overall, aroma is much more subdued than the regular and doesn't smack you in the face like it does. Don't know if that is the aging, wood chips or something else. The flavor was of malt, hops and burnt coffee. It has a medium body and and a slightly burnt quality to the finish. A good beer, but I guess I expected more from the supposedly oak aging.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Higravity,3.23,"Yawn. What oh right. This beer is pretty much like the regular bastard which is ok in its own right. Nice amber hue small weak head, low carbonation. The smell is strong alcohol mixed with some malty profile that could be anything, there is a nutty woody presence with of course plenty of hops in case. The hops seem more toned down but the oak flavor is a little to bite-y with the alcohol. It is a decent blend but I think it might need more time to mellow. I could drink a 6 pack in a week, but not something I would get regularly.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

The aroma is of grapefruit, grapes, and oak. The taste is of brash hops, and abrasive oak. It is like drinking a board. Nothing is in harmony. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer. I guess it could be considered a good beer, if you are looking for something with a lot of flavor, but don't care whether or not those flavors work well together.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,mikesgroove,4.38,"Poured a rich brown amber color with a huge cream colored head that stayed for a while. Smell was very sweet of caramel with an almost a bourbon or whiskey smell to it. The taste was very intresting. Very crisp with a slight touch of alcohol. Sweet caramel malts and a bit of a wooden hop back. This is a very complex beer, I don't think I could begin to explain the taste and do it justice.

147,8951,Metalmonk,4.4,"Looked frickin' amazing pouring out of the bottle, somewhere between motor oil and liquid velvet. A huge dirty-white head sits on top of a cloudy, rusty, burnt-orange. Catacombs of lace web the glass.  HUGE aroma! Candy sugar sweetness meets juicy hops madness meets monster malts, with a woodiness far back in the deeps.  Flavor is as expected, a woodier, earthier version of Arrogant Bastard. Juicy caramel maltiness, grapefruit-rind hops in abundance, a sweet edge not unlike a barleywine, and a toasty, warming woodiness thanks to those oak chips. Luckily the oak chips don't dominate the flavor, but bring a new spin to an old(ish) favorite.  Feels awesome in the mouth, as most Stone beers do. Hangs in there with a creamy, kind of chewy, never too-thick presence. Finishes especially woody.  I don't think this is better than the regular Arrogant Bastard, but it's close. I like the wild, untamed, exciting feel of the AB. The Oaked AB seems a mellower, more polite take on it. Would be fun to drink side by side to compare/contrast.

Scent is spiced hoppy caramel malty goodness with a hint of wooden vanilla. Excellent taste of caramel, hops, spice and a little bit of molasses. Oaked flavors come through faintly but certainly there in bittering somewhat sweet notes. Aftertaste is lingering nicely and is mouth wateringly hoppy with a pine kick. Moderate body and slightly dry with little coating. Highly drinkable and a brew I wish I could find here.

Just looky at that pour, a hazy dark amber oak, topped by a tan pillow that just laces the entire glass.  Woody, spicey and dry in the quaff. Only 7.2%, but it actually has the body of a heavy hitter. The oak really dries out and puts a bite into the finish.  Solid brew  the regular is just as good and preferable, and the double is better than the oaked (IMO).",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Zorro,4.03,"This is a mildly hazed reddish brown colored beer with a good tan head that is bordering on light brown.  Smell is very herbal and hoppy to the nose. The malt here comes through as mostly caramel and biscuit. I can smell a bit of oak here but this is still very much a highly hopped ale.  Taste begins neural and a bit bitter but it is toned down a bit from the regular arrogant bastard. I can easily taste the oak influence here and it does seem to have added some toffee, vanilla and dryness to the beer. Strangely the oak seems to have added or make detectable a slight metallic taste in this beer.  Mouthfeel is good.  Drinkability is fine but I really think I prefer the regular version better.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Abita45,4.05,"Poured into a pint glass, this beer had a better than average foamy tan head for a bottled beer, and it maintained it very well. Once it subsided, there was very good lacing throughout the beer. Not much of an aroma at all, which was disappointing. I had anticipated some oak tones based on the style, but all I really picked up was a musty hop smell.  A very interesting taste, and difficult to define. The presence of oak and wood notes is present along with a sharp, bitter hop flavor. There's also a smokey sweetness to it, not unlike a subtle chocolate or roasted citric flavor, but this is short lived as the beer finishes dry and astringent.  I am very impressed with this beer. It is strong and complex; definitely worth another sample. Next time, I'll have to get a traditional Arrogant Bastard and compare the two.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,auntfloyd,4.38,"Served from a 12 oz bottle into an Arrogant Bastard pint glass. 12 oz bottle? For a Stone beer? Insanity.  Pours an opaque dark mahogany with a slight amount of tan head.  The nose is fairly sweet, with notes of caramel, vanilla, and malt.  The first thing you notice in the taste is the slightly sweet caramel flavor... all malt to begin with, with a nice oaky undertone, followed by a full on vanilla rush, then a hoppy bitter ending, with a sweetish aftertaste. The taste is extremely smooth, and it seems like the extremely bitter aspect of regular AB has been toned down by the oak without losing its extremely complex character; in fact it has definitely been added to.  The mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is high -- higher than the typically over-the-top-bitter Stone brew, and higher than the abv. might suggest. It is also a plus that this, unlike regular AB, comes in 12 oz bottles.  I am going to go ahead and make a controversial statement: that Oaked Arrogant Bastard is the Arrogant Bastard to try. Oaked smooths out much of the bitterness of AB while adding greatly to the flavor, and not diminishing the character, but rather augmenting it. Basically, this is the finest Stone ale there is, and OAB is probably the finest strong ale period. Highly recommended.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Smell: Hoppy and very earthy. The oak is more subtle than I would've expected, but is still evident.  Taste: Much more mellow than I was expecting. It seems that the oak aging took the edge off the hops more than anything, making a much smoother offering than the original AB. The woodiness does add character, and it is still very flavorful, but not over the top. Also has a tart flavor on the backside that I am not a big fan of.

There is a pretty strong malt foreground that mostly comes through as roasted caramel and a little vanilla. The hop finish is strong with notes of pine and a faint woodsy taste. Aftertaste is pleasant and bitter inviting you to have more. Alcohol is present and very warming. Yummy.  Mouthfeel is pretty heavy and creamy, letting you enjoy the flavors to the fullest.  Man I wish I had some more of these. A little tamer a smoother than its non-oaked brother which is quite nice.

No vanilla note or sweetness as hinted at in the aroma. Not my bag.  M: Light. Slightly sour and a lower level of carbonation. Dry finish reminds me of a red wine.  D: Not for me.

The aroma was oak, pine malts and and citric hop.  The taste; though abit more tame, was complex at that. Citric hop coated with a wood-like smoke flavor. Hints of vanilla and sweetened grapefruit.

Taste starts off with sweet malts/ grapefruity and grassy hops, wood notes round off with the slight alcohol and dark fruitiness. Leaves a slightly bitter and drying aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick, almost a chewy beer, slick and viscous on the tongue that has a moderate level of carbonation which adds a lighter touch to the mouthfeel. Drinkability is excellent, taste is great and has been executed wonderfully by the good folks at Stone.

I cannot say anything bad about this beer. I like the Arrogant Bastard, but the oaked version is just as flavorful, but smoother, and the flavors are more rounded out.

Could be a bit stronger in smell though.  Taste: There is a very strong complex taste to this beer that only gets better as you drink it. Besides the obvious strong malts and hops, the oak taste is present but not overwhelming. Overall, great but powerful taste.  Mouthfeel: This is hands down the best mouthfeel I'd gotten from a beer so far. It's got great carbonation and just a silky smooth finish that makes you want to drink more.  Drinkability: When I first started drinking this, I didn't think I would be able to drink more then one but the more I drink of this, the more I think I could drink a couple.

The hops and bitterness are pretty big, there must be some malt pulling it all back, but I don't really get it above all the citrus pith and the oak that hovers over the palate. There's even a flutter of strawberry bubble gum for a second. The finish is long, fruity, and bitter. The mouthfeel is dead on, good carbonation and smooth, slightly slick and oily on the finish.

The taste is very bold and assertive malt with I would guess a decent amount of hops as it does taste fairly balanced. I couldnt guess what kind of hops are used here as the oak is also quite apparent and kind of takes over after initially tasting.  Mouthfeel is a pleasant coating feel with some nice quenching aspects to it. Very drinkable especially considering the abv of 7.2%. A very nice beer.

So whether I should thank you or curse you is undecided friend.;-) You did only give me what I asked for so the burden of consequence lies on me and the gratitude owed is all yours Adam. =)  Appearance: Pours a deep copper ruby brown color with a thick just off-white head and lots of lacing.  Smell: Rich dark aroma of wood, sap, caramel or maple, raisins, papaya, vanilla, gentle fruity but assertive hops and hints of alcohol.  Taste: In a beer already as fantastic as Arrogant bastard it comes to question why oak age? I think the flavor is not drastically altered but the rough edges are smooth and one dimension to an already complex beer is added. Wood. And it is delicious and now even more drinkable. Along with the citrus grapefruit pine hop character and the malty caramel and dark fruit attribute, is a delightful vanilla bourbon flavor that finishes of with a hint of wood and sublime dryness that is amazing.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is what stood out to me the most in this version of Arrogant Bastard. The beer seems perfectly condition with extremely fine carbonation and then the hops give a velvety soft texture that is impeccable and sensuous.  Drinkability: After each sip my entire range of sense begin to call for more. It is so do drinkable that the dryness left on my plate beckons for more. Then as the sweet caramel malt and dry wood tones seep back out on to my cheeks, my palate begs for more. And by the time my taste buds taste the full effect of the long lingering aftertaste, my taste buds are *demanding* more of this beer NOW!

147,8951,AltBock,4.1,"My Oaked Bastard was in one of those little 12 oz. bottles and not the cool 3 Liter bottle. The bottle artwork was like all of Stone's labels, silk-screened on the bottle. The front artwork is almost exactly as the regular Arrogant Bastard bottle. The differences are that to the left of the Grinning Stone Gargoyle in big red letters is the word ""Oaked"" and below the name of the beer in small letters is ""Made with American Oak Wood Chips."" On that back is the usual Stone ""I can describe this beer in 2,000 words"" novel. If you got the free time I suggest you read it. Basically you take the regular Arrogant Bastard label and toss in the word Oaked here and there and you got this label's artwork. There is an Enjoy By date stamped onto the front of the bottle, but you really need to look for it. You can miss it very easily. The date on this bottle wasn't stamped very hard, but I somehow managed to read it. Mine was to be Enjoyed by January 18, 2007.  Appearance: When poured into a simple Snifter, the beer was a burgundy/oak brown color with just the slightest head of white almost tan colored foam on it. It looked like the beer couldn't decide on what the head of foam's color was going to be. As soon as the head of foam appeared, it dissipated away just as fast. It did however leave some white/tan rings and a trace amount of lace around the glass.  Smell: It wasn't as aromatic as I thought it would be. I thought this beer was going to burst with powerful citrus hops and with oak chips behind it. Instead I thought the aroma was quite mild. The dominate aroma of bitter citrus hops intensity was subdued by oak chips, toasted malts, caramel, a touch of vanilla, and a few pine needles at the end. Swirling it around the glass only helps a little bit to bring a little more of the aroma out. There was plenty of stuff in the aroma, but like I said before, it just lacks the intensity to bring all of these aromas out.  Taste: This is more like it! The intensity that was lacking in the aroma can be found in the Taste. That is where it was hiding all this time. The bitter citrus hops gives way to the vanilla, oak chips, grapefruit, toasted malts, caramel, alcohol, and a few pine needles. It wouldn't be the Christmas season without some pine needles in there somewhere. After all of that, the citrus hops decide that they want to come back because they felt they were being left out. If there is one flavor that was an Arrogant Bastard, it would definitely have to be the citrus hops. They can't get enough of themselves.  Mouthfeel: I would have to say that even at a 7.2% ABV, it was full-bodied with little carbonation. There was no shortage of flavor in the aftertaste. Those Arrogant citrus hops don't want to stop beating the hell out of your tastebuds. It will take a lot of water or food to get that flavor out of your mouth.  Drinkablity: Like all of the other Stone Brewing beers I've had, this one didn't really disappoint, except for the appearance and smell. You really need to taste this beer to truly appreciate it. If you like the regular Arrogant Bastard and biting in big oak trees at the same time (I don't know how or want to know how), then you absolutely adore this beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,RidiculedDisplay,4.57,"Finally managed to track down a six-pack of this, and boy was it worth it.  Appearance: Pours a beautiful burgundy with amber and red notes. Head pours fairly thick at first, about 3 finger, settling to a very pleasing tan half-finger head. Lacing is beautiful and cascades evenly down the sides of the glass.  Smell: Amazing. A buttery cream aroma seems the most initially prevalent, revealing notes of caramel, a slight oak, candied sugar, molasses, nutmeg, vanilla, banana, a little alcohol on the back end, pine and grapefruit. Simply fantastic, and truly exceptional. Like an original Arrogant that has been smoothed over with sheets of velvet.  Taste: Piney up front from the hops, a definite alcohol presence, vanilla, oak, some caramel. Wonderful, but a little less complex than the nose. The alcohol sort of cuts through many of the flavors.  Mouthfeel: Mmmm. Velvety smooth, creamy, wonderful. A truly fantastic feeling on the tongue.  Drinkability: An amazing drinking experience, and a wonderful brew. Amazing what just a litte oak can do to a beer like this.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,SteveO1231,4.27,"12 oz. brown bottle with the usual screened image of the arrogant gargoyle and an indication of OAKED in the title. Into an imperial pint glass, pours a clear, dark, reddish-copper with an excellent foamy, beige head and leaves some excellent lacing. Aromas of caramel malts and an citrus/earthy notes from the chinooks. I can sense some light hints of oak when I swirl the glass smells a bit like spruce to me. Tiny hint of ginger bread. Full bodied, with a slick mouth feel. Alcohol has a numbing effect on the palate. Plenty of caramel sweetness throughout this beer. Mid-to-finish is more complex. Earthy flavors, and that spruce/oak flavor mingles with a pine dry bitterness. The Alcohol is very warm. I think the oak really magnifies the bitterness. Very good beer but a sipper. Enjoyed at room temp.  Cheers!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Rudgers73,4.7,"Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. Nice 3+ finger head. Fluffy and tan. The beer is a deep reddish brown (more red than brown) with not much visible carbonation. As it settles the aroma fills the air. Sweet citrus, very mellow, round, and smooth. Buttery hops. and now a taste... Wow. I've had arrogant bastard before but the oaked is SO much better. It's silky smooth and flavorful without having that abrasive tang that regular AB has. It has a thick and smooth mouthfeel that warms your tongue. Better than I expected, I was thinking it was one of those overrated beers that people only thought they liked because it was expensive. Not the case at all. This beer kicks some serious ass.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,joe1510,3.75,"12oz. Bottle $15.99 6-Pack Big Red Bloomington  Oaked Bastard poured dark amber into my snifter. When held to the light I can see the clarity of this beer along with the glowing hot ruby highlights. There was a 2 finger antique white creamy head that dropped slowly to a sparse coating, thicker around the edges. Leaves moderate sticky lacing.  The smell is very unique. The first thing that comes through is the oak. It shows itself with a soft creaminess. It almost reminds me of melted vanilla ice cream. This mixes somewhat strangely with the citrus hops. Smells like a creamsicle. After some deeper smells I pull out some caramel maltiness deep inside. The oak and hops take the cake though. Sometimes I really enjoy this smell and sometimes it turns me off. Tonight I enjoy it.  The taste gets better with warmth. The oak makes things very smooth and creamy tasting. The hops have a citrus bitterness that comes through mid-palate and stays bitter after the swallow. There is a mild raw alcohol note on the swallow as well. Again, very unique.  Mouthfeel is the best part of this beer. It's medium bodied and very creamy. The mouthfeel really compliments the flavors. If it wasn't for the mouthfeel having a hand in things the flavor would have gotten a lower rating.  I can only drink one of these at a time and slowly. Too many big flavors to drink more than one.  This is a strange and interesting beer. When I first tried a bottle I didn't like it at all. I drank it too cold as well. Making my way through more bottles it gets more and more enjoyable. The flavors are hard to take in at first. They werent really expected. Definately worth a try if you see it.  Slainte!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,bjohnson,4.55,"A: Pours a dark amber/dirty copper color with a frothy one finger white head. Slightly hazy. Nice and fluffy head retention that leaves pretty nice lacing. S: Surprisingly fruity hop presence in the nose--fruity, floral, and piney. Slight woody malt background. T/M: Nice big hop notes--grapefruity with a bit of pine tar and sap. Stunningly dry on the tongue with a hefty level of bitterness. Oakey notes are present in the finish, but don't overtake the hop notes. Malt is present also, but not dominant. Very well balanced brew considering the oakeyness. The thought of a hop bomb crosses the mind, then the malt shoots in. It's almost like your licking a oak branch that was just used to split open a grapefruit. Pretty bold body and quite complex. D: Are you worthy? Definitely a great tasting brew. Smooth and well balanced with a good body. They sure like their hops at Stone. Drinkable everyday...",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,CortexBomb,4.54,"The final major variation of Arrogant Bastard for me to try here...I have been quite impressed by Arrogant and Double Bastard, so I'm really looking forward to this one.  The pour is textbook for this beer, beautiful burnt orange colour with a 1 cm white head on top. The smell is huge, even for Bastard, and heavy on the hops...particularly grapefruit, very sweet, malty grapefruit, truly exceptional both in strength and depth.  Taste starts out with an abrasive hops kick which then segues into a very heavy, citrusy bitter, which grows as it sits on my tongue. A distinct, oak imbued background is present throughout, and it seems to accentuate the malt base without dominating it. The finish on this is all sweet, gentle actually. The final swallow warms nicely and gives a kick on the way down. I really like this stuff. The flavour is not quite as aggressive as Double Bastard, but the oak in the middle and the sweet finish seemed to lend it even more character, great beer!  The mouth on this is thick, extremely viscuous, like silt from the bottom of a barrel. The drinkability, moderate: not something you're going to down quickly, but you wouldn't want to anyway.  The bottom line: My favourite of the impressive Bastard lineup, not quite as abrasive as Double, but the additional oak aspect, and sweeter finale in this one make it my pick of the lot, spectacular stuff.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,GregBrewski,4.19,"Pours a dark amber color with a mediocre tan head. A lovely assault of hops in the nose, mostly citrus. The aroma of hops is complemented by hints of sweet malts and alcohol. The front is smooth and mellow, very sweet with little carbonation. It finishes spicy and bitter from the hops. A nice balance this brew is. A very good ale.

Massive resiny hop smell that I can pick up 3 feet away from my face. Grapefruity hops as well. Tastes much mellower than original AB with an almost sweeter upfront taste. Slams you with a bitter, sticky and resiny aftertaste. Medium bodied with a peppery and prickly carbonation. Extremely drinkable even at 7+%. My only regret is that I didn't pick up more of these.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Imstillthegman,4.35,"Finally got my hands on one of these bad boys at Firewaters in A.C.  Poured a dark amber with even darker ruby highlights. Tan head faded fairly fast and left only light lacing behind.  Nice blend of scents in the aroma. Citrusy and lighter pine hops, caramel and biscuity malts, vanilla and last, but not least...oak. I thought the oak would have been right up front in my face but it wasn't and I liked that.  Wow...the taste is just...wow. A nice blend of all the different scents in liquid form. The oak is there from beginning to end, but isn't overbearing at all. You still get all of that Arrogant Bastard goodness.  Medium bodied with a crisp, dry bitterness. Very drinkable...I would love to find some more of this somewhere. Another excellent Stone product.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,DouggiePhresh,4.31,"Pours into a pint with a 1- finger head that is slowly dissipating with each sip, while leaving a nice lacing. The color is very dark ruby/copper.  Ive never smelled a beer like this; strong, but mellow. I can almost smell how it tastes;  smoky, chewy, not as viscous as I expected (not a bad thing), nor as alcoholic. Heavy malts, hops. Might be a little biased based on the Sierra Nevada Celebration I just finished.  Very foamy mouthfeel, so foamy it almost turns into a cream as I ""swish"" it around my mouth. Very drinkable and I would have to recommend it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Lesser smells include vanilla and oak. The taste is a bitter blast of citrus hops followed by a creamy mixture of smoked wood,sweet malt and carmel, vanilla, and alcohol. An excellant tasting beer. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing perfectly making this a classic beer. A truely great beer making me feel not worthy.

Smell is toffee, vanilla, piney resin, oak, toffee, big malts, big hops, big oak, spectacular. Taste is more of the same, toffee rich maltiness, vanilla and citrus, amazing play between the oak and the piney hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with medium carbonation, thought the carbonation was a touch too aggressive, nice clean bitterness. Fantastic, this deserves its high rating.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,JMH_,4.32,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this one. I'm generally not an oaked/""aged in"" fan but wanted to give this one a try as I dig the original Bastard and dig Stone brews in general.  It pours a very nice ruby/copper mix in terms of colour with a decent sized head that leaves a moderate amount of residue on the glass.  The aroma was spicy and woody. General malt notes hit from all fronts along with a bit of citrus fruit from the hops. A bit of alcohol is present but not overpowering.  The flavour hits on all of the aromas quite nicely and in a well-balanced way. The oak flavour is present throughout and makes for a nice compliment to the rest of the flavours in the beer: citrus hops, earthy malt and spicy notes all blend for a great flavour experience. There is some general sweetness from vanilla and caramel that comes though here and there that was not so noticeable in the aroma. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, a bit oily, and sort of sharp in the mouth, if that makes any sense.  I really dug this one. It had some bite and different flavour but was balanced enough that no one flavour or aroma overpowers you. It's one of my favourites within the oaked phenomenon, if not my favourite. I still am not a huge fan of the beer oaking process overall, but I'd be more than happy to drink this one again and if you are into oaked beers, you're bound to love this one...",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,smcolw,4.11,"Quite cloudy, dark, nearly mocha brown. Tight headed head dies quickly. Small amount of lace.  A blend of smells with each whiff, the first one was earthy, like decaying leaves. The second smell was a stong fresh hop with light dry malt. One of the most interesting aromas I've experienced.  Strong bitter hop up front. Although its aged on oak, I cannot taste it. This is a smooth beer with full body which provides good counterpoint to the powerful hop. This bitterness lasts from sip to swallow to aftertaste, which lasts a very long time.  This is not a balanced beer, but it is a rich, full beer with wonderful bitterness.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,scooter231,4.5,"Very pretty beer- quite dark, with deep ruby and garnet colors when held to the light. It has a tan foamy head that stays for a few minutes, then retreats to a thin layer of foamy film that leaves lacing around the rim. Smells... green. Green and woodsy. Piney. Definitely green, foresty things, backed up with a booze punch and a little bit of sweetness.  Taste is also green, with more alcohol coming through. The sweetness makes itself better known, with vanilla and malty flavors, though it still keeps a backseat to the woodsyness, and hop bitterness. The hops have an earthy feel to them, melding well with the oaked woodsyness. There's a nice finishing biscuityness towards the end of the sip that finishes very nicely.  Mouthfeel is slick and smooth, full. This is a very very tasty brew, alcohol is deceivingly tasty and/or sneaky. This is definitely less harsh than the regular Bastard, which I also enjoy. I'm not sure whether or not I prefer one to the other... have to have a side by side comparison. However, this one really is more well-rounded and easier to drink. Less sweet than I recall, but then it has been a while. An excellent brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,BattleRoadBrewer,4.12,"Served at about 38F into a Dead Guy Ale pint (stirring up West Coast rivalry) from 12 oz silkscreened bottle. Aroma at the bottleneck was malty, a hint of hops. Pour was peculiar, very hazy, looked like silty fluid. Excellent head developed, 1""+ tan and foamy, left a great lace. Looks in the glass very hazy, silty, nearly opaque brown. Aroma good, malty and rich. Taste is full of caramel, lots of malt and pungent hops, very enjoyable. Finishes with a very delectable lingering smoky aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, with a subtle siltyness in the background. What is that stuff? Starch? Residue from the oak chips? Drinkability is awesome. Complexity and carmel match the 7.2% alcohol well, making this a very balanced beer.

147,8951,ommegangpbr,4.48,"Oaked Arrogant Bastard in a 12 ounce bottle. Lovely indeed. It's really hard for a beer to look more appealing than this one; a deep, dark chestnut color and a radiant almost ruby color when held to the light. A generous tan head that settles to a consistent foam and lacing that writes a story on the glass. Smells... deep. This is not fizzy yellow fare in the least. Rich malt scents; smells quite a bit like a bourbon soaked fruit laden cake. Enticing and appealing. The inital taste hits like the original Arrogant Bastard but quickly smoothes out to what I can only describe as maple syrup. This makes for a silky texture in the finish, along with persistent hop resins to let you know that this is still a Stone brewery brew. As dense as this is I couldn't see drinking more than a 12 ounce serving or two at a time but I would definately break this out to warm up a cold night. Where most wood aged beers tend to come off as way too woody to the point where they lose their identities, the oak in this has to wrassle with the deep malts and pungent hops making for a terrific balance of strength, depth and rich texture. Even those that don't like Arrogant Bastard should give this a try. Noteworthy at the very very least.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,BusyNinja,4.3,"Keep in mind that I drank this beer with a medium head cold running its course. I was hoping to taste this beer, and I sure did, but it was not over powering. A delightful mix of hops and malt, with a strong, hop presence. A dark brown, almost ruby color. Not much head, but that might be deceiving, as it took the server a while to bring my brew. Not much evidence of lace in the beginning, but nice pattern as I enjoyed my pint. As far as aroma, I smelled hops, and again, not overpowering, but I can't penalize this brew because of my head cold. I hope this beer is still around when my head cold is gone.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,sloejams,3.88,"I procrastinate every year when the 3L bottles of Oaked Arrogant Bastard are released and eventually never get it. Since it was only available in this large bottle (or if very lucky, on-tap) I never got a chance to try it. So this year when I found out it was going to be available in 6 packs, I had no excuses. Maybe one excuse  the 6 packs are generally in the $13 range  kind of a lot to pay for 6 beers. I had to try it so I didnt think twice about it.  The color is a deep amber with a hearty head lacing all over the glass. The aroma put me off at first. It has an almost helium birthday balloon smell. That mostly dissipates and becomes an oaky, caramel. The taste is the same but a heavy malt presence. Hops break through once in awhile. The texture is thick and chewy.  Admittedly, Im not the hugest Arrogant Bastard fan in the world. I think its a fine beer, but certainly its not near the top or my favorites as it seems to be with others. The oak aging improves it, rounding out the flavors. Definitely glad I picked it up.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Bitterness comes through and seems much stronger than AB. Sweetness is more evident in small sips. Alcohol shows through as the beer warms. Lighter side of full bodied. Well carbonated. Flavor sticks to the palate. The bittering oaky finish is almost cloying. Nice to finaly try this one. I have a few that I'm gonna lay down for a while.

Vanilla oak flavors meld with a fruit maltiness up front. Kind of like vanilla and peaches. This quickly turns into the intense citrus and lingering bitterness that I expect from regular Bastard.

Two finger tan head is very creamy, displaying good retention and ample small-bubbled lacing.  The aroma consists of woody, toasty, hops and malt, along with pine, some faint citrus rind, and herb. The flavor offers all that, plus a nutty smokiness and just a spike of phenols.  The mouth is complex as hell, packed with myriad sensations and taste characteristics, yet good carbonation and a creamy notes just prior to the bitter finsh, balances out the hop onslaught.  I think it offers more complexity, and a kinder gentler overall palate than the un-oaked Bastard, making for a more drinkable cousin to the original.

I've had some awesome Stone brews before (Arrogant Bastard wasn't one of them), but I've always felt that they had a following that was a bit too....loyal? You just have to try a beer you hear that much about!  First impression: 5-star head, stained brownish-white and clinging all over the glass. The nose is very subtle, and hints of dust.  This is the most gentle Arrogant Bastard I've ever had. The flavors all melt together in perfect harmony, something I've always thought the regular A.B. lacked.  This one's got a ""brown bitterness"" all over the palate. Dry bitter finish accompanied by some tannins. The fallout lasts a long time, and is exponentially bitter as time goes by.  The mouthfeel is soft, like many finely aged beers I've had. The body has the feel of hard water, with a slightly chalky aftertaste. The malts coat your tongue all the way down. Very subtle alcohol heat plays nice with the malts. Almost no percieved sweetness.  Cheers, Stone, this beer is great. It's almost everything I was looking to improve in the A.B. and more.

147,8951,waughbrew,3.26,"[3.75 for a 12oz picked out of a sixer at Downtown Wine and Spirits, Somerville a couple of days ago]  Ruby beer with a killer head - not overly huge, but very pretty and long-lasting and massive lacing. Aroma is very light, actually. Pleasant, perfumy lavender and pink grapefruit. A bit of a zingy chemicalness all the way through. At first the nice caramel malts (and a little roast too) help to cover it up, but it continues past when the malt is gone. Also leaves tobacco leaves on the tongue. Medium-thick body is kind of creamy, but also becomes a bit thin and sketchy towards the end.  Eh, one is enough. This is too mellow and the finish tastes a bit like household cleanser. Overall it is a real disappointment, considering how much I like the regular bastard and most of Stone's other beers. To be honest, I would not have guessed that this was a Stone beer if I did not pour it myself, since it is not up to Stone's standard of excellence.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Huge grapefruit and sweet citrus rind aroma with some hints of pineapple, pine needle and malt.  The flavor is smoother and a bit more balanced than the regular AB. Sadly, this does equate to a lesser hop bite but the flavor is also a bit more complex. The flavor is red grapefruit, orange rind and pineapple up front. This is balanced by a nice bouquet of piney hops. There are some roasted wood flavors mid sip that give this beer a distinct taste compared to the the regular AB.  The palate is medium bodied with a nice amount of carbonation.  I'm not sure that this brew could replace my love for draft AB.

Very bitter up front and also quite piney/sprucey (funny, i don't get any oak in the flavor). Lots of nasty (good-nasty) hops and the alcohol is obvious and somewhat welcome. Some small amount of vanilla on the finish and the bitterness hangs on throughout. Tastes like A-B with a lot more alcohol and less refined.  M: Full mouthfeel, not as syrupy as I expected.  D: I don't know how i feel about his overall. Yeah, its an interesting thing to do with an already interesting beer, but it kind of just funks it up and makes it harder to drink and, well, less fun to drink.

Nice hop smell, but also contains some nice malt, a touch of vanilla and oak. Overall very inviting.  T: Interesting. The initial taste is similar to AB, huge blast of hop bitterness. This is cut by the smoothness created by the oak. Finishes with oak, a touch of smokey bourbon, and leaves a charcoal bitterness.  M: Full bodied with just a touch of stickyness  D: The oak smoothes it out a little, which makes it more sippable than AB, in my opinion. I feel the drinkiability for the two are similar, just in different ways.  Glad I got to try this. As stated above, I find this is just as good as AB. Both hoppy bitter beers, but whereas AB is pure hop bitterness, I find the oak finishes with kind of a 'charred' bitterness.

Pours a very deep brown with a small white head that fades quickly. Haven't had it side by side with regular AB, but I'm sure they are about right on in color.  Smell is actually hop first. Was expecting the oak and alcohol, but Stone's lust for hops comes first I guess. A little roastiness comes through with the oak.  Taste is also hop forward (not a bad thing). The oak is very subdued compared to some of my recent offerings of oak aged beers. I'm a big fan of such, and was hoping for more in this. The normal arrogant bastard alcohol kick is also there  I was a fan of this beer the first time I had it. It was a while ago but I swear I remember there being more oak to it. Maybe a year of aging might take the hoppiness away and leave more of the oak. Wasn't sure how old that 3L I had was. I always though that oak is exactly what AB was missing (which is bold to say it's missing anything though). I guess I though it would compliment it very well.

147,8951,shirfan,4.33,"A thick, sticky pillow of foam sits atop a dark copper brew, absolutely refusing to disperse.  Malty aroma, whole-grain toastbread, hints of orange and tangerine.  Taste is excellent. A strong, juicy citric hops presense is perfectly tempered by moderately sweet malt. Fresh-baked bread notes give way to some bittering, leaves just enough pucker without being excessive. Oak is present in the background, as is a slightly mineral flavor, imparting further character into an already excellent brew.  As good as this is, I'm glad I opted for a single 12 oz bottle rather than an $18 sixer. The oak is interesting, but it doesn't make an already awesome brew that much more exceptional.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,weeare138,3.46,"Appears a near transparent auburn toned amber with a fluffy, ivory head that slowly fades into a dense, soapy cap. Tons of hearty, scattered lace sticks around the glass. Smell is of caramel, flowers, mild grapefruit, pineapple, light vanilla, earthy spiciness, and gentle oak tannins that may have been missed had I not known oak chips were added to the mix. Aromas were lighter than anticipated. Taste is spicy, sweet caramel, overly bitter of grapefruit along with gentle woody tannin flavor. Mouthfeel is astringent, bitter, medium bodied, sweet, with the balance being out of wack and very little evidence of the American Oak. Drinkability...I'm not believing the hype with this one. This may be one of the most over-rated beers I've seen on this site IMHO. I'm just not feeling it...""I'm not worthy.""",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,merlin48,3.7,"Much anticipated bottle here, $17.00 a sixpack at the Liquor Barn stores in Louisville. I've passed up the 3 liter magnum bottle(with lock and key) several times the past three years because of price. So, the 12 oz bottle pours a hazed chestnut body with a small light beige head that quickly falls into a film. Some spiderweb lace dresses the snifter.  Aroma opens with citrusy grapefruit and pine cone notes, not unlike the unoaked version. Caramel malt whiffs are noted before the woody oak essence takes charge.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. The oak imparts some sawdust chalkiness.  Taste largely mirrors the aromas. Bitter citrus rind and spruce pine hops, a hint of caramel, and a touch of vanilla. The oak chips lend more of an astringent feel of sawdust than vanilla and soft wood, however. Even at room temperature, this finishes somewhat abrasive and overly woody.  I would rate the original Bastard higher than this. Stone has some attractive pricing on many of their excellent offerings, but I'll pass on this one next time.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,cbl2,3.7,"12/1/2006 $8.99 6 pack 7.20% No best by date, though this is 2006 release.  Appearance:  Pours a slightly hazy medium brown, speckled with plenty of orange. Topped by a ridiculous 3 inches of creamy tan foam that is very slow to settle. Looks like I'm going to have to wait to enjoy this.  Aroma:  Sweet muscat grape aroma coupled with a hint of oaked chardonnay. This was made with American oak wood chips, and it definitely imparts a wine-like nature to the nose.  Taste/Mouthfeel:  Smooth syrupy viscous mouthfeel is accompanied by a touch of hot alcohol and some blisteringly bitter hop oils, with pine-like resin flavor characteristics. I've never loved Arrogant Bastard, but was hoping the oak imparted some quality that would raise this up, much like whatever Stone did to Double Bastard, that makes that such an exceptional beer. That quality is lacking in the Oaked, and though it is better than straight up Arrogant Bastard, it still isn't good enough for me to recommend.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Bighuge,3.05,Hazed dark mahogany/ruby red appearance. Thin and bubbly dirty white head. Lacing is minimal. Aroma is all that goodness I remember from AB with just a hint of woodiness in the aroma. That pineapple tropical fruit melange brings back memories. I also get a little caramel/nougat thing going on. Taste is fairly bitter and actually a little harsh and abrasive. I'm not sure I like the effect of the oak chips here. Cuz I remember loving the hell out of the real thing. I think the chips bring a little astringency to the mix. I don't dig the aftertaste at all. All that tropical fruit goodness that I remember takes a backseat now unfortunately. To the over-riding oak chip quality. Too much for my liking.  I guess they're right about this one. I'm NOT worthy.  Thanks for the brew Darren.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,delicious,4.23,"A clear dark ruby body beneath a frothy beige head is poured from a 12fl.oz. bottle. It has a citrus, ruby-red grapefruit and concord grape nose. It tastes juicy and bitter, like overestimating a bite out of a grapefruit and grabbing an immoderate amount of rind. There's an initial malt sensation, but it quickly subsides as the hop flavor grows and finishes bitter and dry at the end. I don't want to call it subtle or mellow because there isn't anything delicate about it, but the flavor progresses slowly enough that the drinker is not overwhelmed by the striking level of hops; it's like an Arrogant Bastard in slow motion.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Taste is very bitter with a caramely sweetness that lingers for a while ending in just the bitterness of the dark bitter hop. Almost like an apple drink with a bitter aftertaste. Really nice. Mouthfeel is very clean and the hops/oak seem to make the tounge .go through all kinds of changes during the sip. Drinkability is high here if you like the hop/oak. It is really nice.

Pours a lovely ruby red coloration, with a nice sticky white lacing that holds well through the course of the glass. At first musky grain was the only smell I was getting, but after letting it warm up a bit, I picked up on some nice peach and nectarine smells. Taste was big on hops up front, followed by the fruit characters in the background. There was also a certain bitter rye taste after swallowing, mixed with lingering warm alcohol. This is a pretty big beer to be honest, at least on the palate. I was a bit surprised that the alcohol content wasn't a bit higher. I could sit down with a six pack of these and probably finish them off in a night. Having said that, it was much mroe ejoyable sipping this one, and letting it warm a bit to get the full range of flavors and aromas. I must admit that I've never really liked the unoaked Arrogant Bastard, but this one hit the spot with me. I didn't really pick up on the oak addition, but none the less, I liked it alot.

No alcohol to speak of like with regular AB.  This is a nice smooth beer that coats the mouth well. Good even carbonation. However, it's super bitter(in a good way) and one at a time is probably enough.  I'm not a big fan of regular AB, but this is one tasty beer. The oak aging advertisement is misleading. I was expecting the typical flavors from oaking, but this one is much more bitter than regular AB. So much so that it overwhelms much of the other flavors.

Dark fruits, big hops, and oak scent, all blend together for a wonderful nose.  The taste is just as goodas the smell. Complex hops hit the palate first; certainly dark fruits, pine, and floral. Then the malt backbone comes through to balance out the flavor, followed by a slightly bitter finish. Thoughout the beer there is an oak/woody taste that just compliments it perfectly. What a wonderfully complex and interesting beer.  Mouthfeel is full, but the finish is a little dry. Highly drinkable. Highly reccomended.

Huge notes of oakiness in the finish and some vanilla up front. Like the original Bastard, it isn't very smooth of a beer, which does negatively affect it.

The aroma was citrusy with a strong presence of grapefruits, oranges and also a grassy and resinous hop character. Malt was secondary to the hop aromatics and contained a sizable caramel presence.  The flavor was mellow and smooth by comparison to the aroma. With a tannin character imparted from the oak and a vanilla presence the hops became smooth as silk with a citrusy and still grassy presence, but smooth instead of aggressive and rough. The malt flavor of caramel was well done and kept the overwhelming flavor and bittering of the hops in check. The oak was well done as well and never overpowering.  The finish was dry with long lasting citrusy and grassy bittering into the aftertaste and beyond. The body was medium full and had a creamy character from the moderate level of carbonation.

147,8951,akorsak,3.82,"Received in a trade with Boolshot. I am drinking this from a Stone 10 glass also received from Boolshot.  A: The ale is a deep copper red-brown color. The beer poured a thick two finger head that has laced nicely throughout the glass.  S: The ale has three discernible aromas: alcohol, oak and hops. The oak is present from the get-go, giving the ale a buttery aroma. The hops have a bit of a grapefruit bite and the alcohol, while warming, is big.  T: The flavors that appear here are clearly influenced by the oak chips. The tastes are buttery and almost chardonnay-like. I say almost because the intense hop character still emerges through oak. The hops are bitter, concentrated grapefruit and citrus flavors.  M: The mouthfeel is a delicious combination of hoppy bitterness and smooth oak butter flavors.  D: The beer has a moderate abv, but the hop and oak characters are so intense that you may not make it beyond a bottle or two. The beer is a treasure.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Westsidethreat,3.5,"2006  A: Color of a ten year tawney. Cloudy and murky, loads of toffee highlights. Head has a medium creaminess, khaki colored.  S: Clay, band aid, caramel, bit of vanilla and over ripe peach.  T: Begins very oakey, extremely oakey actually. Actually oak is all I can taste and not necessarily in a positive way. Its not subtle, there aren't wisps of vanilla, its just oak. That's where the band aid smell came from because its coming thru in the beer too. Finishes lightly fruity and very bitter with more oak. As it warms, some depth does break thru but too little too late.  The thing about the oak is, this beer isn't aged in barrels. Oak chips are added and you can tell. The oak completely dominates the Arrogant Bastard. A good oaking should highlight the flavors, not dominate.  M: Medium body, full mouthfeel. Good carbonation.  D: Don't get me wrong, I still finished every sip of this beer. Perhaps I got a bad bottle but I doubt it. I've got the rest of the six pack to update my reviews if I feel its necessary.

147,8951,BEERchitect,4.5,"Never thought I would see this one in 12oz. bottles. Has the same Arogant Bastard characteristics that makes me so glad that I got into craft beers. As expected, the oak barrels impart a complex woody, nutty, musty, and raw character. It also rounds out the harsh hop and fusal characters of 'regular' Arogant Bastard. The beer comes across much smoother, more delicate, and more compex. Almost a creamy flavor and texture (cotton candy). From the bottle, it seems that the oak flavors, aromas, and nuances are more previlant than the times having it from the growler.

147,8951,dblinkhorn,4.72,"I finally got my hands on this stuff. I ordered the last 5 12oz bottles from liquidsolutions.biz. Anyway...  Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter glass (the best glass for any style [except wheat beers] for precise reviewing, in my opinion).  Appearance - Pours with a three finger eggshell-colored and creamy head. It settles at a thin layer of patchy/creamy head that leaves excellent, full lacing as you drink it. The color of the beer is a deep ruby/amber and it is slightly hazy.  Smell - Slightly sweet up front, with the expected hop arrogance similar to what you'd find in the original: fresh, bittering, and slightly herbal. There are also aromas of tropical fruits, such as sweet plum, apricot, peach, and mango. A moderate vanilla scent in the middle, and just behind this is a wonderfully rich malt presence. Moderate alcohol burn all around the nose.  Taste - Sweet tropical fruits and crisp bittering hops right away. The vanilla really comes out after this with hints of the oak wood chips that the beer was brewed with. The middle is sweeter/more floral and generally more mellow (except for the nice hop character) than in the original Bastard. The finish brings out the buscuity, rich malt character nicely, with some hot alcohol showing itself. The aftertaste has lots of wood flavor and just as much of the original hop bitterness. Mild earthiness also accompanies the aftertaste. Moderate alcohol throughout but focused toward the finish, right before you swallow.  Mouthfeel - Fantastic carbonation for this beer. Very mellow with a very slight bitiness to it, which is not at all unpleasant. The holds until the swallow. The beer is also very smooth, which I did not expect. Very slick and wet throughout, but dries up a bit about halfway through the aftertaste.  Drinkability - I'd say this is overall more mellow on ""attack"" than the original Bastard, but it definitely has some nicer and finer nuances in the flavor and aroma. The flavors, however, are still strong generally.  A wonderful version of the Bastard here. The oak wood chips added a lot of complexity and nuances to the beer's flavor. Also, this beer seems much smoother and softer in body and mouthfeel than its predecessor. A must have brew!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

The taste was upfront sweet orange with a stellar peppery, grapefruit hop finish. An excellent toasted doughiness throughout.  The mouthfeel was full and mildly chewy.  Overall an EXCELLENT ale. Solid ABV with an excellent drinkability. Head and shoulders above the regular version. Really, just a superior beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,becktone,4.78,"Oaked Bastard is beautiful once it can be seen and is decanted into a glass. The color is a deep orange/copper color. The head pours at about two fingers width, and as it receedes to a stable one finger height. As it receedes it leaves a solid wall of lacing around the sides of the glass. Head retention is stable at one finger.  To the nose this beer is just as good as it looks. Like Arrogant Bastard, and many other Stone products, it has a strong hop aroma. Floral characters make up the hop profile. The hop aroma is nicely complimented by a strong malt backbone (aromatic malt in there perhaps?). This beer has an overall earthy aroma ot it. I can't really see how this smells much different than non oaked but it still smells great. Perhaps its just me, I've not had AB in such a long time it is somewhat difficult to tell the differences. Still it smells great.  Oh, the joys of having a tongue. This beer is bliss. Strong hop presence in Oaked Bastard. Floral, grass-like/earthy hops give this beer quite a punch. A hop-head's paradise. The beer's malt profile is subdued when placed next to the hop flavor. It is tough to describe the malt flavor, yet it is there. The oak character is right at the end of the malt flavor profile. It is just right there at the end. The oak flavor combines nicely with the dry finish of this brew.  A very full body on this beer, great on the palate. It is very satisfying that even though this beer has a high abv it still has a big body as well, especially for being a beer that is not a ""dark beer""-porter or stout etc. As mentioned before the beer finishes dry which compliments the oak character very nicely. Carbonation is not overpowering. As to the drinkability I'll almost definitely buy this again, maybe not this season though. At $18 for a sixer the price hits the pocket book hard. Overall a great brew, which I enjoy perhaps more than the Original AB.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Foxman,4.33,"It pours a clear and carbonated deep amber around a central column of ruby. Two fingers of sculpted light tan head de-meringue casually. Tapestries of lacing carpet the inside of the glass.  The aroma has a backbone of toasted malt, with caramel and baked bread, padded by a dinstinctly pine aura. A very reedy earthen oak note is matched with an equally airy vapor of alcohol.  Upon tasting, there arrives a crusty caramel malt presence with a considerably damped sweetness. Pine and grapefruit hops also seem slightly subdued and rounded, though they do remain quite poignant. And it's the oak that mitigates both, leaving a very mildly woody remembrance. There's a glimpse of alcohol just before the malt turns biscuity and the hops lay a blast of nuclear bitterness, leading to a crisp, dry, long finish. The oak softens the profile, and it's differently excellent because of it.  Medium bodied, it's clingy, chewy, flowing, and glowing.  It's the great taste of Arrogant Bastard feathered by a well-integrated earthy oak addition. It's still extreme, but in a less extreme way. The solid ABV is warming, and in no way an obstacle. The original is edgy and a breeze to drink. This one is every so slightly softer, and maybe even a bit breezier.

Hint of oak in it also. T- Big bitterness from the citrus hops that break through the big malt base. Oak comes through in between it all.

T: Initially, this taste very similar to the unoaked AB, bitter and intense. The flavor starts to change after a few seconds, and a gritty vanilla flavor begins to peek its head out.  M: Full-bodied with smooth carbonation. The bitterness makes this one feel quite dry.  D: Quite good, however I was hoping that this would be a bit more different than its unoaked counterpart. To me, the differences are so subtle, that it probably isn't worth the premium to get the oaked version. However, the 12-oz serving size is a plus.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,bennetj17,4.3,"Pours without much head, just a thin tan foam that leaves a ring and some spotty lace. Color is brownish/amber, decent clarity. Strong aroma of grassy, resiny hops, paired with robust caramel malt and a hint of vanilla. Tangy sweet.  The taste opens up with a rush of tangy hops. Malt flavors are fruity and caramelly with a sweet vanilla finish that's lightly dry. Light alcohol presence, bitterness lingers nicely. The mouthfeel is somewhat light, with a nice smoothness and middle of the road carbonation.  I like to enjoy this beer with small sips, not because it's strong, but to really soak up the vanilla oakiness in the finish. These flavors are a bit subtle, so definitely let the beer warm some to bring them out. This, paired with the solid hop bitterness provide a good balance and really make this beer worth drinking.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,largadeer,4.25,"2006 release.  Poured into a Stone IPA glass, Oaked Arrogant Bastard has a dark mahogany hue, rich head and moderate carbonation. The nose is all oak and hops.  The flavor is rich and complex - the malt comes out first, followed by vanilla, oak, and citrus hops. Smooth on the palate, full-bodied, creamy, and extremely drinkable for such a potent beer.  Highly recommended for fans of extremely flavorful, rich, full-bodied beers. I prefer this slightly over this year's Double Bastard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Cresant,5,"Poured this 12 oz. undated brown bottle into a Samuel Smith tulip glass. Three fingers of khaki colored head capped the dark cola/reddish brown body. The head did dwindle to a thin creamy cap which hung over the rich clear body. Thick lacing hung on the sides of the glass. Beautiful.  Smell was fabulous. Resinous, bitting floral and citrus hops. A faint brown sugar smell appeared. Later a woody aroma and hints of alcohol appeared. It was a challenge to let it warm further due to the extreme drinkability.  Taste was of resinous, bitter hop oils. Clean and refreshing. A malty undercarriage mixed well with the robust hoppiness. Taste reflected the aromas well. Complex woodiness. This one finished with a long citrus linger. This one exceeded my expectations.  Mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. Smooth mouth and a zesty swallow. Fine.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Appearance: A dark, reddish brown with an off white, frothy head with good retention and left nice lacing all the way down.  Aroma: A citrusy, oily hop aroma hits first, followed by a malty sweetness and faint alcohol. Very pleasant, indeed.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Oh so smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The very citrusy flavor of hops is assertive at first, then the big, caramel malty sweetness blends with the oak that lasts through the finish.  Notes: Wow, what a great beer. Hard to believe they could top the original Arrogant Bastard, but here we are. I love the oaky, woody flavors and thats smooth, creamy mouthfeel.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Nose is rich caramel rolls and fruit punctuated by vanilla, oak, and resinous hops. Taste is [not surprisingly] much like ""regular"" AB. However, there is a definite added complexity/dimension with the oaky, madeira, vanilla flavors. The hops are still aggressive, but the added malt complexity balances them much better. What am I trying to say here? This is damn good beer! Finish is slightly warming and redolent of a fine Scotch. Here's hoping this is released in 6 packs every year.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,goschool,4.5,"On-tap at Lucky Devil's in Hollywood.  Appearance: The pour is dark brown with fiery orange highlights and a small layer of tan head that lasts for quite a while.  Smell: Grapefruity and floral hops battle for supreme control of the aroma with dark malts and soft woody aroma.  Taste: The oaky flavor wussifies the arrogance in the flavor profile. Its brother's sticky dark malts and citrusy hop bitterness are still in here, but everything is so smooth. Very different from the original.  Mouthfeel: It's medium-bodied and the texture is luxuriously smooth, but still dry like the standard issue AB.  Drinkability: I was in one of the most uncomfortable parts of LA, the service was awkward, and my meal was overpriced, but I forgot all about that when I was drinking this beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,TheLongBeachBum,4.6,"Presentation: 12 ounce bottle, from a freshly purchased Six-Pack of the recently released monster. Standard looking Arrogant Bastard Ale text and Gargoyle is screen printed in white but overlaid with the words OAKED in a Red colored semi-broken Arial text, enforcing an over-stamped look. Sealed with a simple brass cap which has the words Hated by Many Love By Few.  Appearance: Dark ruby body has some rich purples, polished mahogany, Conker fresh horse chestnuts and a range of deep browns to entice the visual inspector. Held high to the light it glows, it has a soul that projects danger, yet an inviting sense of adventure. The deep tanned head is darker at the meniscus and perfectly formed, rich in its fine formed texture with a smooth top it deposits some nice lacing as I work down the Old Guardian glass.wonder if theyll release an Oaked AB Glass for this? Superfine dissolved carbonation adds an intense conditioning to this brew but it is all kept under control.  Nose: Ripe barley malts are filled with thick fruity hop oils and a biting citrus tingle in the finish. Alcohols are here, prevalent but not invasive whilst the merest hint of wood can be detected, but it hides when chilled; only revealing itself after the brew warms to room temperature.  Taste: A gorgeously sinful mix of high alcohol, hop oils and raw English barley wine styled malts. Deliciously fruity, soft biscuit, tanned leather and a growing tendency to leave hop trails on the tongue are thoroughly lovable. It does tend to exhibit a rather dry woody finish in the long run though. The regular (sic) Arrogant Bastard is a big brew which doesnt need any Oaked characteristics to improve its demeanor. Moreover the American Oak Chips seem to tame the beast a little and add some quality and education to a brash cocky youngster which I like. Refined to an extent, it looses some of its Bastard charm in the process but the Drinkability shoots off the charts though - so it's a balance of sorts.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, the ultra fine conditioning and woolly thick head help to impart a regal nature to the texture, and I really enjoyed licking my freshly formed Oaked Arrogant Bastard moustache after the first mouthful. Sophisticated and free of sharp edges, the feel is of high quality coachwork throughout.  Drinkability: Good job these come is Six-Packs! But Id still love to see it in Bombers too. Maybe Ill have just one more 12 ounce bottle.yeah its only 9:30pm..you know this stuff is dangerously quaffable, I could easily manage the whole Six-Pack, even knowing that I have a 6am flight tomorrow.Watch Out.  Overall: Unusual to see this in Six-Packs given Stones preference for Bombers and the previous 3L outings for Oaked AB. It works well whatever you want to put this in and I for one have enjoyed revisiting this brew. The only drawback is the price; I quickly realized that the 10% Double Bastard Bomber sat next to the Six-Pack that I picked up represented better value for money per ounce. Oh well. Ill certainly stock up on this one when I win the Lottery for sure. Hope you get to try some.

Bought 6 six packs of this brew and i'm loving it. For the record, Arrogant Bastard is one of my favorites and is always in my refrig.  Pours a beautiful beef jerky brown and mohogany with an oatmeal hued tenacious head that leaves a sweet victory secrets lacing around my pint glass... yes i have wood, take that any way you want. The aromas are a symphony of sweet fresh kilned malt with blossoms of citrus laying on a plank of fresh cut wood which leads right into the taste of the same.  The flavors are an explosion of defined grapefruit BBQ'd over oak chips and malt kernals then all reduced to an elixer of all said flavors dancing in harmony with hints of sweet caramel.  Scrubbing carbonation teases my palate and a medium yet somewhat crisp mouthfeel leave yearning for more. Get this brew, it's golden!!!

Pours a beautiful deep ruby red color with some amber highlights. A huge fluffy cream colored, almost yellow head forms. Tons of delicate, sticky lacing is left behind as the head fades. Good head retention. Excellent smelling brew! Big malts and hops, candy, kinda boozy, with a nice oaky aroma in the background. Some citrusy smells with hints of vanilla. Quite bitter on the tongue, duhh!! Tastes like Arrogant Bastard with wood! Lots of hops upfront with the malts taking a backseat. Creamy smooth mouthfeel, but leaves a nice crisp feeling on the tongue, kinda dry. A pleasure too drink, I like this a little better than the original.

Taste: I had a leviation before this to at least have some warm up. Arrogant bastard is usually very harsh and I'm only able to sip it. This beer is nicely balanced, with some nice woodyness. Aging has done wonders. More bitterness than levitation (watered down arrogant bastard), but it's a more pleasant bitterness. YUMMY! PERFECTION. Better than the original. I reviewed arrogant bastard early on and it has a higher rating I think, but this one is better and has a nicer taste. PICK THIS UP!

147,8951,SacoDeToro,3.85,"Purchased at Hi-Times in Costa Mesa.  The beer poured a deep garnet with a small off-white head that quickly disappeared.  The aroma of the beer was rich dark malt, chocolate, and some vanilla.  The flavor of the beer was full of rich maltiness with a decent citrusy hop bite. The hops are very subdued compared to regular AB, which in my opinion, makes the beer much better and more balanced. The bittering of regular AB is just too coarse for it to be drinkable and appreciate the rich maltiness that's there. This version avoids that problem entirely and is a far superior beer.  The mouthfeel was medium and creamy. The carbonation was just right.  The 12oz. bottles are a welcome addition. Stone and other breweries should do this more often for their big beers. I realize the costs are higher, but it's much easier for me to take my time when I don't feel pressure to push through a 22oz bomber.  I got a six pack from the last case at Hi-Times. This stuff is going fast. So if you see it, grab it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,instrumentality,4.03,"Let me start off by admitting that I am not a big fan of Arrogant Bastard. It was actually the beer that got me into Stone, but in retrospect, it's probably one of my least favorites of their offerings. I appreciate the whole ""You're Not Worthy"" bitterness concept, but I'll go ahead and compromise my own masculinity by saying that I guess I'm not worthy because it's just a bit too bitter for me to really enjoy it...at least until I'm about halftway through the bottle and the alcohol starts to cushion the blow.  Nonetheless, as soon as I heard that the Oaked Bastard was available in bottles (which occurred less than a week ago in my neighborhood), I had to have some. I now have two six-packs of the stuff, and I'm hoping I made a wise investment.  I poured the contents of my first bottle into my trusty Stone Imperial Russian Stout tulip glass. The liquid was a deep, rich mahogany, too dark to be transparent yet perfectly clear, with a substantially tall and dense tan head that settled to about a finger's width. I swirled the glass a couple of times and the head retention was perfect.  This being the second oaked beer I've reviewed (the first being Old Yeti Oaked Imperial Stout), I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, but sure enough, the odor was very similar. The smell conjured the image of being in a field of oak trees after a heavy rainstorm. More simply: wet wood. A hint of malt and even a glimpse of sweetness was also present. The overall experience was fairly appealing, but I wasn't sure how well it would translate to my taste buds.  After my first sip, I was not disappointed. Where the effects of alcohol were once required to ""cushion the blow"" of the bitterness of this brew, the oak aging and flavor now did the job. I could taste the gentle oak flavor up front. This was quickly chased by the trademark bitterness of the Bastard. However, whereas the normal Bastard has a tendency to burrow its way into my tongue and make me feel like someone just jammed a handful of pine needles into my tongue and then poured grapefruit juice into the wound, the oakiness seemed to leave a protective coating that provided enough of a blockade to stave off the hoppy attack while being subtle enough for my taste buds to enjoy the flavor. It's not the bitterness of the Bastard that puts me off, it's the fact that it won't go away. I could take three sips of Arrogant Bastard and the taste would linger for ten minutes. I'd rather have a chance to recover and then pummel my taste buds again at my own pace, and this Oaked variety enables me to do that.  I still can't say this is one of my favorite Stone beers: I prefer the refreshing quality of their IPA or the complexity of their Old Guardian, Ruination, or Imperial Russian Stout. I will qualify this by saying that I don't really have a basis of comparison as far as what an American Strong Ale should taste like, so I can't judge to style. I can appreciate it for what it is, though, and I will have an easy time spreading out my consumption of these over the next several months or even years and seeing how the experience evolves.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Still a great looking ruby red w/ a 2 inch creamy amber head and left an excellent amount of lacing. The taste and aroma was similiar to AB. Malty caramel, toffee, citrus hoppy w/ a well balanced sweet-bitter ending. I failed to smell and taste any oak barrel, even after drinking 4/12 oz bottles.

A different flavor, somewhat like the different of regular AB but also the Oak perhaps?  Rich, complex deep flavors.  I got a bit of sticker shock, never paid that much for a six pack before, [12.46] but after reading the forums [and doing the math] It's really not such a bad deal after all, and maybe it would be nice to have this and other richer stone offerings in 12 oz bottles.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

147,8951,Ieatlambfries,4.2,"Served in a large snifter.  Appearance was dark cider reddish brown. Half inch thick tan head of dense foam. This pulled back quickly, but left nice remnants of lace on the sides and a very small layer of bubbles on top of the beer.  The smell hit me at first with canned pineapple sweetness. Piney Hop resins and the slightest hint of oak.  The taste was heavily influenced by the oak. It actually seems to have toned down some of the more unbalanced flavors AB usually has. Now, I'm not saying it's well balanced, but a lot of the malt sweetness has been smoothed over by smokey oak notes. Piney, perhaps Cascade hops, are heavy in the flavor as well. Fruity malts are present but a bit muted.  The mouthfeel is thick, yet smooth. This could be a product of the oak or perhaps the aging.  Very drinkable. In my honest opinion more so than regular Arrogant bastard. I think the oak does wonders for this beer. It really smooths the flavors out.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Slight oakey aroma and a hint of vanilla. I wasn't overwhelmed with the oakiness. Maybe because this is such a hoppy beer. I still think the hop is the strongest character.  Tastes of Strong, grassy, piney hops. Hints of vanilla, dark fruit, tree bark. Oak.  Very bitter full bodied mouthfeel. Like I'm chewing on a handful of hop flowers.

Pours from 12 oz. bottle a dark mahogany with a finger and a half of a thick foamy beige head with excellent retention, leaving a nice thick lacing around the glass as it slowly falls.  Aroma is mostly of oak, as would be expected. But behind it there are plenty of hints of the original Bastard; grapefruit citrus hops and sweet roasted malts.  I wasn't sure what to expect on this one, and though I was surprised, I am definitely not disappointed. Compared to the original, this is very mellow, though still definitely full-flavored. The first taste is the citric grapefruit hops, but then the oak chips creep up. They sneak in with the light roasted/toffee malts in the background and go straight for the throat of the hops, creating one helluva balance. Lingering bitter aftertaste, but it is very mild.  Somewhat syrupy and oily mouthfeel, full-bodied with ample carbonation. A lot lighter bitterness than the AB, so it's definitely a step above as far as drinkability.

Very nice oatmeal colored head that has a much staying power as any I have seen.  S - Mocha, burnt wood and a clean vanilla waft. Also present are the dark fruits that are present in the standard version of the Bastard.  T - OK, this is the best way I can describe this. Imagine Mr. Arrogant Bastard chilled for a few hours, listening to Barry White ... believing Barry White, and learning a thing or two. He is still arrogant and still a bastard. But this time he is smoooth.  Woody tones are very apparent and serve to mellow out the various battling flavors in the original version.

Tastewise it is hoppy yet sweet along with some spice and malt going on as well. You can taste the oak, which gives this beer a bit more of a bite then regular Arrogant bastard.

Pours beautifully in the glass...a little less head than on regular AB, but still sticky and lasting the entire drink of dark golden amber. Aromas are all about the grapefruit peel hops. Taste...wow...I can immediately taste the oak...it seems to actually mellow out the effects of the extreme hops and creates a marriage or blending between sweet amber malts and the hops. This really balances out AB much more than the 'in your face' of fresh standard AB. This one is really much more sessionable.

Smells of grapefruit, lemon, flowers and pine (or is it oak?) I thought it was more pine, but maybe that's from the hops. Tastes very nice. Good citrus/grapfruit taste. Blends nice with the malt. There's the oak. A bit more of a 'tinge' of oak. Nice rich flavor. Combines well with more of the fruity flavors A good feel. Light syrup. a bit thicker than AB.

Tastes like Arrogant Bastard (imagine that) with the exception that the woodyness lends, taking some of the edge off of the normally large hop profile.

147,8951,dbalsock,3.98,"Appearance: Pours a dark brown with little head, but maybe the bartender's fault. The lacing was quite pretty and oddly symmetrical.  Smell: Grapefruity hops are the major smells I get from this brew. There's a light malty back bone and a sweet fruitiness. Somewhere between plum, melon and molasses, but with none of the particular smells of the three.  Taste: Again, grapefruit as if it's a heavily hopped red ale. The alcohol is an immediate presence on the palate, but goes nicely with the rich sweet syruppy taste. There's a verry hoppy background, like most of stone's brews, but balances out with the malty foreground.  Mouthfeel: Medium to bodied with an air of hops, alcohol and what I can only assume is the effect of the oak cask all mix with the hoppy bitterness to create an amazing mouthfeel. This is a smokey, thick, bitter brew. Amazing.  Drinkability: All of the flavors, smells and alcohol are quite intense, but also constructive.

It has a very subtle oak aroma to it. The alcohol content is notable in the aroma.  This beer tastes exactly like it smells. Floral hop flavor is dominate. Behind that, I get some oak flavor. Alcohool content is there also. It has a very sweet taste. It is not quite as hoppy as Arrogant Bastard. The hops have just died down a little.  This beer is very full bodied. It leaves a sweet floral hop aftertaste. It is carbonated well.  This beer would probably not make a great session beer. The flavor is very aggressive, and therefore, after a few, it might get old.

Maybe its just me but the Oaked seems to have better head retention.  Smell - All the great aroma of Arrogant Bastard, especially the hops but with a sweeter, maltier aroma. I would say thats some of the oak coming through?  Taste - Again still very close to the regular Arrogant Bastard, this one is sweeter and the woodiness of the oak comes through as it warms. Also a great caramel taste comes through as well, this to me is the sweeter aspect of it. When I say its taste is close to regular Arrogant, I don't want to mislead, this is still a very different beer and to me is much more suited for other occasions, this one is much nicer after a meal.  Mouthfeel - Smooth with a larger medium body than the orginal.  Drinkability - While a very drinkable beer, I was careful and could have gone the distance with my dad who went in on this bottle with me but he gave up early, guess he had homebrewed himself out earlier.  Overall this has been my favorite new beer experience in a long, long time. While it is a bit pricey, in my mind it was well worth it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,mentor,3.67,"Cask pull at the Falling Rock Taphouse (Denver). Presented a half-finger light-brown head that clings and keeps hanging around. Super cloudy brown (reddish) liquid. Smells caramel with light bourbony oak. Dark oak, american. Touch of alcohol sting in my nostrils. After sitting a while, the piney hops became much more apparent.  Tastes super-creamy mouthfeel, but light body. Delicious oak character. Vanilla and a touch toasty. AB hop umph is absent or covered. Dry woody finish. Touch of bitter and grassy, perhaps that's the hops beginning to show themselves. After sitting a while, I get a hint of hazelnut and chocolate. A settled piney hop flavor, like this beer has been aged. Nearly absent carbonation.  Okay, this last 1/3 of the beer has sat at least a half hour. Oranges early in the taste. Esters are low, which was deceiving, as the mouthfeel sets up an expectation. Just a little bit of alcohol heat. Touch of cherry sour. Cascade hop smell and flavor. IMO, this beer was fairly disappointing. Needs more sweet and some esters to accompany the mouthfeel and fill out the beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

Poured carefully from the huge 3L bottle into my New Glarus glass a deep brilliant amber red color with a healthy white head on top of the brew. As I put my nose to the glass I got some nice rich caramel maltiness along with big piney and citric hop resins. A touch of frutiness with a wonderful oaky, woody aroma. Hints of vanilla and toffee. Really enjoyable and a step up for me from regular AB.  First sip brings a ruch of caramelized fruity malts along with a smooth oak flavor that really adds a nice element to the brew. Resinous, piney bitter hops roll in as the beer goes down with a solid bitterness. Finishes a bit dry with a lovely lingering woodiness coupled with a touch of vanilla. An awesome amalgamation of flavors that I personally really enjoyed.  Mouthfeel is smooth and a bit creamy with laid back carbonation, making this really easy to drink. A tasty oak aged brew that still on the lower end of the abv spectrum for these kinda beers. I'd happily drink much more of this if given the chance. Maybe I'll have to plunk down the change for a bottle of my own someday, but for now I'll just have to be thankful for whoever the kind soul was that brought this and allowed me the opportunity to sample it!

The pour comes up with about half liquid, half light-brown-colored head that's foamy and long lasting. Leaves excellent lacings along glass and surface of beer when given the time to extinguish itself. The beer is the color of cherry wood stain.  Nose: Incredibly aromatic and complex. This beer could be used as an example of the potential in the depth of beer scents. The smell of black cherries jumped at me right out of the bottle, before I'd even had the chance to pour the glass. Smells sweet, of soda or candy, cherries, plums and vanilla.  Mouth: Most prominently smoky and bitter, the fruity entrance of this beer does not meet the expectations set by the complex aroma. Also, I would prefer that the beer maintained a more strongly carbonated mouth-feel, but I think that the size of the head (which remained consistent to the very last glass of the bottle) uses up a fair amount of the bubbles. The oakiness, while very interesting and enjoyable, seems to be so bitter as to cover up the much needed malty sweetness.

Let's see if this one lives up to the hype...  Served at cellar temperature in a pint glass. Several times.  A - Pours a light, completely clear chestnut color with rusty highlights; looks a bit like a dark cognac. Very fluffy off-white head.  S - Toasted caramel maltiness with well rounded maple and vanillin notes. Some raisins. Some wet cardboard. Really the only place the oak shines through.  T - Maltiness takes on a dry, chocolate cake character. Aftertaste is green and hoppy - quite bitter, and just as it begins to fade, it repeats again to remind you it's there. Nice, but lacking any real bravado or standout traits.  M - Watery coming into the mouth, with a bit of fizz to fill the mouth. Turns smoother as it approaches room temperature.  D - Overall, this beer is slightly underwhelming given the hype and rarity. And the math doesn't work out in favor of the consumer. The bottle is 101.4 oz., which equals 6.33 pints... maybe 8 pints if you leave room for head. At $70 a bottle, you're talking $8.75 a glass.

I was SO tempted to have this with one of the donuts...  Nice dark copperish colour with a loose, uneven tan head. (The head reaaly was kind of unattractive...maybe just my pour...also seemed to have a greenish hue- but that could have been due to the translucent plastic Solo cup. Next year, I bring my own real glass.)  The smell was all abut fruity amltiness and floral hops. Very nice.  Flavour was, as you might expect, a bit woody, with a nice velvety sweet maltiness and a nice licorice hint. Very nice, but I really expected a tad moore oomph.  Thick and even on the tonuge, the carbonation seemed not very present- but that could have been due tot he bottle being turned up so many times by the time I go to it.  Drinkable?

Love the woody oak character. Huge toasted malts and resinous hops make up the majority of flavor, with some subtle vanilla tagged on. Remains very smooth down to the last drop. I truly prefer the oaked version over the regular Arrogant Bastard. The oak really adds another dimension of flavor and complexity to the already great brew.

Basically fairly similar to the regular AB, except much more mellowed. I don't think this is solely a product of the aging, the oak really helps out (I've had a bottle of AB that had been aged for a while). I think a lot of the strong hop presence has been taken over by some wood flavors.  Still a helluva powerful brew, but powerful in a more palatable way.

I could gloat about it's gorgeous deep brown color and frothy, billous head. It's alluring, and startlingly complex scent.  I could complain about the difficulty in pouring the first glass from this 3L monstrosity and about the disappointing lack of availability in bombers so that I could imbibe this bitch more frequently (although I hear it's on tap at the Publick House...)  But I'd rather wallow in the wonderful depth of character and flavor. I love big, bold, hoppy beers. And that's here... but it's not predominant. There's an alcoholic sweetness that stands out, the oak is mellow and distant. The distinct AB hops are right in the middle, not attacking up front or lingering behind. Superb balance... but it's not quite as astonishing as I was hoping for. Great, great beer, but between the anticipation and the pour and how it sat in the glass I expected this to be something I would be traveling back to San Diego this week for. It was worth it, but just shy of perfection.  That's faint criticism at best, and I can't wait to compare the on-tap variety.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

It is very attractive in the glass, with a supple head. The mouthfeel is very full and creamy, which I appreciate. Many beers sacrifice a full-body for the sake of drinkablility, but this is not one. The taste is a wonderfully complex mess. The bourbony oak flavor is pretty distinct, but far from overwhelming. The hops are very mellow, and I keep having to pinch myself to remind myself that I'm drinking Arrogant Bastard. The kick just isn't there; rather, there is a wonderfully complex taste that is nutty, fruity, and just overall delicious. While I'm not sure I could drink it all night, I consider this beer a treat.

Malt up front, with hint of vanilla and oak, finishing solidly bitter from the hops. Oddly, I find this to be more bitter than the regular bastard, yet not have the same hop flavor or amora. Mouthfeel is rather thin, but still substantial. Drinkability is moderate.  Oddly, I prefer the standard Arrogant Bastard over the oaked version.

I met Marty there, and savored this beer (which no one would consider a session beer all day long. OMG.)  Appearance is a red-brown with ivory foam and lace that sticks around. Aroma contained a matrix of flowers, oak, grapefruit hops and spices. Initial taste possessed an awesome blend of massive hops, sweet malt, citrus, mint, mouthfeel is milkshake-creamy, perfect carbonation, balsam and is followed by a ingeniously crafted smoooth middle in which the oaking is present, and the finish is a crescendo that screams: MORE MORE MORE!  p.s.

Really want to taste this beer on-tap.  Poured a deep =, burnt red in color that was leaning just a bit toward brown. The head with every pour was huge. I was afraid it was going to be flat even though it had one of those rubber swing-top stoppers. Sheet-like lacing all over the interior of the glass. Nose had hints of dark fruit (figs mostly) with molasses and just a slight tang of hops.  flavor is a very melllow complex. There is a whole lot going on but not too much of any one thing. The oak adds a dimension that really brings the flavor home and keeps everything subdued and enjoyable. More strong molasses andsome deep-woods piney hops give a nice sweet base with a just slightly bitter bite to it all. Got some black cherry, fig and raisin flavors out of it also.

This is much more smooth than the original. The body seemed a bit lighter to me. Still very good, but lost some of the in your face hoppy character that I enjoy from the original.

I order it, and the server comes back and says, ""All we have is the Oak Aged Arrogant Bastard -- is that okay?"" Is that okay? Hell, yes, lady! Served up as a full pint, Oaked Bastard is a cloudier version of the garnet-brown hued ""regular"" stuff. 1/2"" of thick beige froth. The nose, unfortunately, was a bit more subdued than I expected -- perhaps from being served a little on the cold side? Anyway, Chinook vapors and roasted caramel malts wafted up, just not as strong as the non-oaked AB I've sampled. The taste is certainly that of the Bastard I know and love, yet different: softer, rounder, fruitier, more vanilla hints (the oak probably?) -- yet the brutal hops and malts abide. The mouthfeel on OAB is creamier and smoother. Medium bodied and chewy.

It was quite an educational experience, as far as what using oak can do to a beer. You could pick out all the character of the Arrogant Bastard, but with a little something extra. Our bottle poured with just a bit of haze and the lacing was thick and clumpy throughout. There was an earthy woodiness that melded nicely into the aroma and flavour, kind of filling in the gaps between the other characters. There was also a light vanilla flavour that was quite nice. The texture was creamy and smooth as silk.

147,8951,mitchfor3,4.87,"Appearance: Poured from growler into a tulip glass which showed off this beer's beautiful garnet, deep dark cranberry color - it's redder than I expected. The head maintained itself well, a very light cream colored delight that left tenacious lacing and ultimately subsided into a sticky collar.  Smell: The aroma of this beer is simply stunning. HUGELY fruity, but in a good way! Almost no alcohol present in the nose, impressive for upwards of 7%, leaving a delicious hop bouquet undisturbed for my nose's pleasure.  Taste: Wow. Wow wow wow - stuningly smooth considering what this beer came from - the original Arrogant Bastard. The oak aging has worked wonders here smoothing out the harsher, more savage elements of the original into a truly refined delight for the senses.  There's no doubt about who's boss - it's the hops! Still, in a strange way this beer achieves balance. As the brew warms up, the alcohol becomes slightly more present, but it's never overpowering owing to the fact that it could never outshine the delicious hops in this brew. Alcohol is most noticable in the aftertaste, which by the way is delicious - appropriately bitter and woody - and lasts for about 10 minutes if you let it.  Overall: This was without a doubt one of the best beers I have ever tasted. Everyone and their mother is ""wood aging"" everying these days, but the tecnique was put to perfect use in this brew. I'm really not a fan of the original Arrogant Bastard, but the Oaked version seemed to take out all the flaws and accentuate all the positive attributes.

The oaky flavor is subtile, but definitely noticeable. Vanilla and a sweet malty character blend together into a strong but balanced feel.  M- fairly thick and silky smooth body. Carbonation was almost non existent.  D- Three of us polished off one of the huge 3L bottles with no problem.

147,8951,Gueuzedude,4.22,"Pours with a frothy, amber-tan colored head that is a bit on the thin side. The beer is a hazy orange-amber color when held up to the light, otherwise it is a straight up amber color. The aroma is herbal and citrusy with notes of tangerine, orange, perhaps a bit of mint, lemon basil. The oak is really not all that noticeable in the nose at this point. There is some woodiness up front and it seems to be interacting in interesting ways with the hops, creating aromatics that I can't quite put my finger on, but they are definitely not in the regular Arrogant Bastard.  The taste has a nice full mouth-feel to it an the hops are still quite raw and aggressive. Underneath this though is the oak; most notable as a tannic and astringent note in the finish. The beer is perhaps a bit too cold right now, but the flavors I can taste are orange, grapefruit, a sort of raw grassy herbal note, sweet caramel malt (which accentuates the citrus notes), menthol in the finish, and even a bit of tobacco.  The beer is quite tasty, but the oak is fairly subtle at this point. In the end this is a good thing, because if the oak was heavy handed it would really clash with the fresh, vibrant hoppiness that is characteristic of this beer. When paired with some Mexican food the Oak character really starts to become noticeable; it becomes much more woody with a pronounced buttery-oak type note in both the aroma and taste. But it still does not dominate the overall hoppy quality of this beer.

Sweet caramel and fruits with that arrogant bastard hoppiness backing it up. Very light woody notes as it warmed but they were minimal. Sweet caramel covered dark fruits over some bitter citric hops. Nice balance overall. Some woody notes were more apparent here than in the nose and seemed like it came out more than when I tried it fresh. Dry citric bitter fruity finish that sticks with you for awhile. It seemed a bit to mellowed at this point though. Pretty solid mouthfeel with good thickness and creaminess.

Just when you think AB coudn't get any better and then comes the oak flavor...subtlely added, but complements this brew so perfectly. I believe it adds to the lingering bitterness, as the hops are dominantly featured, but the oak carries all the way through the finish and quenches so nicely.

I have been thinking for weeks which beer to review, and the opportunity to sample this came up, so it seems appropriate to let this stunning beer be my ""Beer Benjamin"", so to speak.  First, any beer in a bottle that big that even comes with a lock...whoa. Like most Stone offerings, this is a beauty to see. A striking ruddy-orange with an amazing clarity in its crystal ability to refract light. A 1/2"" head of mixed cream colored foam never quite disappered - nice.  Oh, the nose. One word - OAK. Un (expletive) believable! Just outrageous. Its like a freshly split section of seasoned oak is under my nose. There are some malt and fruit qualities but who are we kiding? Amazing.  Taste? One word - OAK. Again, amazing. The barrel and Arrogant Bastard have played well together. The usuallt strong hops have been tamed to a pleasing bitterness that dance atop the usually fruited but now more wine-like tones. Malts and oak play like old friends - this is a fantastic experience that taste like no beer I have ever tried. Ironically it finishes very light, some bitterness, and some vanilla like sweet tones.  This was simply one of the best and most unique beers I have ever tried. If you have the opportunity, do your tongue a favor and try this.

Appearance: Clear cherry red topped by a tannish frothy head. A thick blanket of foam was retained for quite some time and left strong lacing and massive blobs on the glass.  Smell: Restrained AB hoppiness with a strong caramel malt backbone. Whiffs of oaky vanilla and smoke. A brooding, dark smell, perhaps like damnation?  Taste: Odd cedar/woodchip flavor on the outset. Bittersweet malty caramel kicks in accompanied by vanilla sweetness. Bitter hoppines pervades the entire experience. Woody flavor well integrated, though it takes the hoppiness down a notch or two.

147,8951,donnebaby,4.65,"Dark ruby color is covered up quickly by a dense foam that dies to a filthy haze.  Nose is full of fresh hops and sweetness, and orange spice. Where is the oak?  Taste evolves as the brew warms, into a sweet orange, spiced with cloves. Very sweet, strawberries and cherry. A heavy sweet layer of vanilla adds to the already smooth mouthfeel, that is only interrupted by a spicy grating of hops and booze. Something grahamy and toasted develops. Overall, a little on the sweet side.  Excellent drinkability. Alot more force and stuff going on in this beer than the -- dare methinks -- ""low"" ABV.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,tjd25,4.42,"As I poured the first glass, I had the impression that there would be no head, but it ended up forming a nice light and velevty head on an intense opaque amber brown color body. The smell is extraordinarily fresh and shows a great bouquet of red fruits with a very enjoyable sweetness. Also lighter hints of citrus, with a grapefruit character appearing slowly and getting deeper in the taste. Yeasty notes of vanilla appear after a while. The taste is way more aggressive than the smell. The very dry hoppiness invades and conquers the mouth with together with some oily notes. As for red fruits and citrus, their influence switched from the one they had in the smell: the once dominant red fruits notes are more subtles in the taste, as the grapefruity character took over. The aftertaste gets quite dry and grassy. The oaked aspect appears together with notes of cherry that create a slightly floury feeling on the tongue. Mouthfeel is enjoyably lighter than expected. Its complexity stimulates all the parts of the mouth and of the tongue. This surprizingly soft mouthfeel contributes to the great drinkability of theis character brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,NeroFiddled,4.5,"This will be a fairly straightforward and simple, hedonistic review as I've already reviewed the straight Arrogant Bastard and so much has already been said about this beer.  Basically, I feel that the Bastard is already a full-throttle beer and the oak-aging is wasted on it. Sure, the oak is present (and it's drying, woody character does help to tone down and smooth the beast a bit), but does it really help to improve the character of the beer? I'd say not. It's different, but it's not better. And there's just too much going on to really enjoy the character of the wood (although it is oak-chips, right?). Good, but not great.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,francisweizen,4.75,"I had the last glass of this at Eulogy in Philadelphia after the Yards open house on 12/4/2004. Since I got the *very last* pint of this brew the bartender gave it to me for free. Thanks! And another big thanks to Tracy;-)  Dark reddish copper with a lovely, thick cap of white foam that lasts, lasts, and lasts. Leaving excellent lacing on my tulip glass. The aromas are excellent and although similar to those of the regular arrogant bastard they also exhibit hints of vanilla, oak and caramel. Yum. The taste is hoppy and malty up front with some lovely oak notes and vanilla hints in the middle. The finish is slightly boozy, malty, hoppy, and oaky all at the same time. This is a lovely blend of flavors here. The mouthfeel is silky smooth, thick, bw, and cask-like and the drinkability is only hindered by the fact that this stuff will get you drunk all-too-fast. It is still too bad that this stuff is all gone from Philadelphia. Does anyone want to send me a growler, or split a chained 3L bottle?

147,8951,GClarkage,4.92,"01/07/05- On tap at the Toronado in San Francisco, CA  Presentation- Served in a tulip glass (damn! was hoping for a pint)  Appearance- Great orange-brown color with a nice big creamy head and nice lacing.  Smell- Possibly the best smelling beer I have ever put my nose to. So much malt, hops, fruity, flowers and oak put together.  Taste- The first thing that I noticed were the hops. Not to bitter, but just enough to entice me to drink more. Then the malt hit me. Rather dark and caramel flavored malt which mixed in perfect with the hops. To top it all off, it had an extra oak flavor that put it over the edge.  Mouthfeel- Medium to highly carbonated, but still goes down ultra easy.  Drinkability- One of the best beers I have ever had. Everything comes together so well in this beer. How I wish they had this beer in the bomber size bottles.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,shapudding,4.48,"Growlered this after drinking a ton of it at the Exton Drafting Room. This has always been a favorite session for as long as I can remember, and now to have it oaked.... damn! Poured deep and woodsy amber/ruby brown and clear with a think khaki ring and slight cloudy dusting in the center. Lovely. Perfect amount of carbination, not too much, just enough to let you know it is there, but not fizzy or ""fluffy"" feeling. The mouthfeel is very good. Bit under medium bodied. Scents of piney loveliness and vanilla. Nice and dry with dark, hoppy bites. Tastes of grapefruit rinds and gin, whiskey woodsiness. Touch of vanilla hits you at the end. AB is always such a drinkable one for me, and man, add some wood to it, and now it is even more so. Yum. Sad to see this one end!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,IceAce,3.65,"Served on-tap as a guest beer at BJ's Brewhouse in Brea, CA.  Arrived in a beer-clean footed pilsner sporting a dark copper body and a full finger of creamy tan foam. The nose is sweet with malt with strong backup from the smoky oak. To say that the nose is complex would be akin to telling somebody in the path of a hurricane that they may soon experience moisture.  First impressions mean a lot, and the first taste of this this brew is dry. Really dry. The open is laced with cheek numbing alcohol and grain. Midtaste is virtually absent, a pause which sets the stage for the scene-stealing oak finish.  Mouthfeel is good with a nice supporting level of CO². This is a funky beer in that where I expected smoothness, I received harshness. While I am certain that much time and expense went into the oak aging, the effect is lost when it becomes overbearing.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,watermelonman,4.7,"This poured to a great dark ruby color with a medium head that lasted well. It's leaving a hefty dose of lace behind as well.  The flavors coming out of this thing are very strong yet wonderfully balanced. Malts start the party, layers of fruit come through next, and hops finish it off just right. Oak comes through somewhat in the middle of the taste and really makes itself known in the finish. The oak aging seems to have made this much smoother in the taste and mouthfeel. Anything negative I could have possibly said about the regular Arrogant Bastard, no matter how minor, has been reduced or eliminated in this version.  In short, this is an amazing beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

First swigs: Granulated sugar and vanilla sherry overtones. Oak woody and maple syrup bubble gum and juicy almonds. Dry slightly lingering aftertaste.  Lighter carbination & tacky foam hops.  Last swigs: Vanilla porter with hops. Vanilla bubblegum from a growler. Thanks to fellow BA Shapudding for the sneak growler. Fairly enjoyable via growler. Wow!  Beer is good.

147,8951,oracle,4.13,"10 oz draft  OK, maybe I shouldn't be writing reviews after all (although I'm probably not going to stop), but after many folks telling me how wonderful the Oaked Bastard was and how different it was from the regular Arrogant Bastard. Sorry, but quite honestly, I could not tell a difference between this and Arrogant Bastard.  Don't get me wrong. I love the bastard. I buy growlers of it quite regularly. It's a wonderful beer. I just couldn't taste a difference between that and this.  Beer arrived deep amber color with minimal head (probably due to a good job of pouring). Medium lacing left on the glass.  Smell was strong, with heavy hops and a strong alochol presence.  This is one strong beer. Very strong hop presense right from the beginning. Other flavors come in the middle, fruit (mostly plum) and floral. Strong alcohol flavor in the middle as well.  Finish is very strongly bitter, but not unpleasant.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

I enjoyed this more mellow version of AB.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Sammy,4.13,"A great experience, a 3 litre bottle shared with many fans. Beautiful dark colour, pour. Excellently hopped,moderated by choice malts, oak bits give flavour. Bitter and wine-like finish and aftertaste. Pine and some grapefruit in nose. Carmel and grapefruit in mid-sip. Medium-full mouthfeel. A bit too oaky from the oak chips, that was less so on-tap two years later when tried at Solena Beach Pizza Port.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,BrewMaster,4.83,"Served from the always attractive 3L bottle. Luckily we had a new garbage can anda bunch of ice around to chill this bad boy. I have to give the apperance/presentation a 5 because this bottle is so damn cool with the lock and all. The beer itself poured beautifully and looked exacctly like the ""un-Oaked"" Arrogant Bastard we poured side-by-side. A creamy, frothy head that cascades down the sides of the Arrogant Bastard flute-like glass. The head on the oaked AB lasted the entire glass and then some. Fluffy, soft bubbles formed a nice stiff heaed atop this beer. The aroma is hoppy and sweet but not nearly as stong with the hops as the regular AB. A bit of citrus in the nose as well. The flavor is smoky sweet with a burnt wood flavor. This beer is very very smooth. A lot of the hoppiness has mellowed out to make this a more malty tasting brew. Notes of currant, caramel, and mango fill in the flavor well. It is a slight bit thinner in the mouth but is still very velvety and smooth on the palate. Aging with oak is a definate improvement upon an already exceptional beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,FormatKid,4.78,"I finally got a night set aside to drink this 3L, just me and a friend taking on this monster. Once I fumbled the lock off and popped the flip top I stuck my nose right in the bottle and took a big whiff...oh yeah, that's oak...sniffing from the bottle musty oak aromas were what I detected most of all. Once poured into a glass the body of the beer is a deep ruby brown, somewhat hazy, yet slightly translucent. The head is off-white with a yellow oiliness to it. This head is a champ when it comes to retention and lace and lasts through-out practically each entire glass adding to the overall experience. The aroma in the glass is lovely, hops are a bit downplayed when compared to the bastard in his original state, husky oak undertones and of course the dense caramelly goodness of the malt. The flavor totally corresponds, dense velvetty malts, subtle hints of husky oak, tiny pokes of vanilla flavor and dense piney hops. The oak aging process does wonderful things to the bastard...if only it weren't so damned expensive in this particular packaging, I'd still recommend getting one for the experience though.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,RoyalT,4.83,"Appearance  This one came out a pristine orange-brown in color and was brilliant. It brought up a huge, stubborn, monstrous head in every pour from the 3L bottle. The head clung to the inside of the glass leaving gorgeous lacing and went down in clumps of shaving cream-like foam.  Smell  The classic AB nose is here for sure. The malts are dark and come out a bit better though since the giant hop aroma is somewhat muted. Along with this is the oak. Its typical American-style oak meaning no big vanilla notes. These wonderful smells fade into a nice, deep, malty caramel at the end. It gives the impression of light whisky.  Taste  The Stone hop combination comes out much more at the taste. Even with the huge, dark, roasty malts coming at you full force they are still an even match. The malts darken up more on the tongue. Finally, the roasty malts and resiny pine give way to a light caramel and toffee finish.  Mouthfeel  This seems a little lighter in the mouth than the regular AB, although Id still consider it between medium and full-bodied. The sharp bitterness and sticky sweetness are softened by the oak flavors to give this one an incredibly smooth mouthfeel.  Drinkability  I hate to use the phrase, smooth as silk, but man oh man was this ever so. This was one of the true pleasures in life. What a treat.  Comments  This is probably the biggest session beer that Ive had to date. Skyhand and I had no trouble killing off this 3L bottle. Well worth the $60 that Stone is charging.  Update  Popped the 06 right after it came out. This is edgy right off the shelf. The oak is raw. I keep checking my cheeks for splinters. This has a lot of spank that needs to be cellared out unless of course you like a little smack to go along with your bastard, which of course we all do. I suggest drinking fresh and aging as well.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,beergeek279,4.68,"Served from a D's growler into a dimple mug. The color is a dark tawny brown with a nice beige foggy head. The smell has a lot of the oak in it with just a touch of the hops. The taste starts with a nice mellowed but very assertive hop bite (piney) with the oakiness strong in the flavor, with a surprising touch of malt sweetness...more subdued but definitely more complex than ordinary Bastard. Mouthfeel is very oily yet otherwise smooth. As for drinkability, this is one I'd definitely enjoy several more of.  Thanks to Greg Koch for sending Oak Aged Arrogance out this way. I debated whether I preferred this to the standard Bastard, and I admit they both have their own unique characteristics; the everyday Bastard slaps you in the face with flavor, while this is more nuanced and subtle (words I never thought I'd use to describe Stone!!!) and equally enjoyable in its own way.

It pours a deep brownish ruby red color with three towering fingers of head. Bigass chunks of lacing all down the sides of the glass. The smell is a little less hoppy than regular Arrogant Bastard. It still has some citrusy aromas, and some dark fruit aromas as well, such as cherry. The taste is rich and malty at first. Lots of cherry, wood, and earthy flavors. The finish is a great balance of hops with a hint of oak. The flavors just all come together in perfect harmony. The mouthfeel is extraordinary, so thick and so smooth. The drinkability is fantastic for a 7.2% brew. A damn near perfect beer. I wanted to give it a perfect 5, but I'm gonna hafta agree with Kevin here. For as strong as the flavor is, there could be just a little bit more in the nose.

The hoppy aroma seems subdued in this version, but still very much present ... just more balanced. The flavor is great. Caramel malts with a lot of American hops - citrus, earthy.

147,8951,OldFrothingSlosh,3.7,"On-tap at Anam Cara.  I was extremely/very/muchly excited to see this on the list of beers available at the lovely Anam Cara.  Hazy reddish-brown in color, with a long-lasting tan head that makes a tolerable effort to lace the glass. Aromas are certainly nice, but not what I'd expected. There's a pervasive oak character here but not the hop bitch-slap I'd expected from the Arrogant One. Flavor really threw me. I've had The Bastard before and this is nothing like it. Not nearly as boisterous in the hops and alcohol department. Lots of oaky character, with some residual sweetness on the palate. There's hops in here, but not nearly in the quantity I'd hoped. Finish is on the dry side. Mouthfeel is good but I wasn't blown away like I've been with other Stone beers.

A lovely goblet arrived filled with a color that, now that I've heard it referred to enough, can be safely described as garnet. The deep ruby glow was capped by an simple foam swirl.  The aroma was slightly spicy and malty with the same aggressive hop nose you'd expect from Stone. Very nice.  The taste was a very slow, rich complex malt present. The oak seems to have smoothed out many of the flavors, possibly even concentrating them. The hop bitterness is great, and doesn't detract from the mingling of flavors.  As nice as it was, a glass was appropriate, and I feel the number of days that I'd prefer this beer are quite few.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93

The nose was a beautiful mix of oak, big malt and some soft citrus piney hops.  Taste was along the same lines. Very rich, medium to full bodied, and extremely smooth from start to finish. A surprisingly big but mellowed caramel malt and citrus/piney hop bitterness and taste are actually very well balanced with an extremely noticeably woody oak touch in every sip. It ends with a lingering bitterness.  Ive never been crazy about Arrogant bastard (always felt the double bastard and imperial stout from stone blew it away), but OMFG, this is one killer beer. The aging mellows it a lot and really brings out the malt notes and softens the bitterness. At the same time the woody/oak quality add a whole new dimension to the beer. Very nice.

The aroma was a decent blend of malt and hops. The flavor had malt with a hint of Christmas candy and some brown sugar, with a touch of hop flowers. A mild alcohol finish.

The was a very mellow flavor to the brew. A very vanilla like flavor was there. It was really good after it warmed up.  Mouthfeel was creamy and it was very drinkable. Not harsh at all. Very good.

Mouthfeel: Not that thick, but thicker than most ales.  Drinkability: Well, I'm working on a 3L bottle as we speak. Because once it warms its flavor significantly betters, I would rate this brew as quite drinkable; however, in order to savor as much of the beer's flavor as possible, I would suggest getting some friends to help you out when dealing with a large quanitity of this ale, such as the 3L bottle.

On tasting, I got a restrained bitterness coupled with sweet malt and a mild roastiness. It seem to change on me and was sometimes sweet, sometimes dry. I'm not good at picking out vanilla.

It leaves a very thick lace down the glass as it is consumed. One of the most impressive looking beers I have ever had.  Smell is different than the ever so hoppy bastard that I am used to. I get some rich, roasted malty character in the nose. A certain sweet quality is there as well. The oak adds an earthy, woody element that is rather nice.  Taste is really complex. Has some grapefruit, currant and woodsy elements. Its sweet and malty and really balanced.  Mouthfeel is very nice, medium to full. Creamy as it goes down and a slightly warm finish.  Drinkable? You bet it is, I managed to put down 3 pints in a couple hours and had my party not been heading out I would surely have had another. Even my girlfriend drank a couple of these and she is typically a hop hater.  If you have the option, try this one, it is great!

147,8951,Boilermaker88,4.79,"Having heard that this fabled brew was being offered on-tap in Riverside, I knew I had to try it. So I met up with fellow BA Hopjack13 at Jag's New American Grille for a pint of what turned out to be a great beer. Served in an Arrogant Bastard pint glass (along with a t-shirt, the total cost of beer, glass and shirt was $15), this Stone brew had a burnished copper sheen, clear to the eye, and a compact vanilla colored head that slowly shrank and left some modest lace behind. The smell of Oak Aged Arrogant Bastard was phenomenal; the rampant hoppiness of regular AB is refined and mellowed, the sweet malty aroma is more pronounced, and there's a hint of vanilla or some fruit I couldn't quite place that added an extra, wonderful dimension to the nose. Tasting this beer had my taste buds happy from the get-go. A sweet, almost fruity, malt flavor permeated the front and the oak aging is truly notable in how it has calmed and allowed the somewhat clashing tastes of Arrogant Bastard to blend and meld together more harmoniously. The hops aren't subservient, far from it, but the bittering in the finish is smoother and more enjoyable with the aging. The feel was luscious; medium- to full-bodied, smooth, and creamy, thanks to the abundant carbonation. Oak Aged Arrogant Bastard Ale is a wondrous brew that I could have been happy drinking all night. Alas, this was not to be but I hope to once more indulge in this great offering from Stone again soon. This is liquid gold worth going great lengths to try if given the opportunity.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Dukeofearl,4.27,"Tasted at JAG's restaurant in Riverside California at a brewery special night. Overall, this is one beauty of a beer that will kick you when you aren't looking.  It was served up in an Arrogant Bastard pint glass (they made us buy a pint glass and an oversized shirt just for the right to buy the beer- this marketing ploy pissed me off because when we got there 20 minutes after they started, they were on their last XL shirt and only had XXL and XXXL left. The place was not busy! This is no way to run a railroad, and I lost some respect for Stone because of it). Sorry for the rant but I needed to get that off my chest. Back to the beer at hand. EDIT: After some reflection and some comments by other BAs, I realize that this may have been a ploy of the restaurant and not Stone. I do not know which, but I have since met Greg Koch and he doesn't seem the type to have done this.  The beer is a gorgeous copper-brown color that you can see through (at least before you start drinking it), and the first pint had a very nice off-white creamy head aboout 1 finger high. The second pint came with no head at all. The aroma is full of lush hops and smooth malt- very nice. The flavor is very full, with a lot of hops that are obviously mellowed out by the aging. I didn't have a regular Arrogant Bastard next to it to compare, but (from memory) I really did think there was a difference.  There was a great mouthfeel- there was a lot of carbonation hidden that would come up when swirled in the mouth that made for a pleasing creaminess against the sharp hops.  Drinkability- this beer goes down very well, but the alcohol kick was quite strong. A couple of these and I was done. Overall, this was an excellent beer, and I am pleased to have had the chance to try it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,nomad,4.79,"Had this at the 12, 12, @ 12 Stone event at the Blind Tiger (even remembered to take notes yay for me)  Poured a strange brown, black, red color, a different color from the bottle/draught version. Had a steady carbonation to it so the head, a slight creamy color, held tight. The lace dissipated pretty quick, though.  Nose smelled of grapes, currant, oak, barley, and was rounded out by a vinuous quality. It tasted of oak, hops, cedar, and very ripe wild grapes. All the flavors rounded out as the beer opened, when the malt and oak began to come over the hops. Take everything big and snapping about AB, calm it down and make it deeper and more complex - wow.  Mouthfeel was still sharp on the tongue despite the oak-aging but still thin and pretty easy to drink. The finish was biting (at first), mostly feeling salty, winey, but altogether smooth.  In sum, very drinkable, as the oak-aging softened, rounded, and deepened this beers character. The oak-aging really helped this beer alot, more than it might help other ones, I feel.

It had the same intense blend and balance between the sweet, slightly roasted malt, explosive citrus and firey hop flavor and bittering, but an added deep, smokey roundness that mellowed and softened it into someting incredible.

Citrus and coniferous hops are the first taste, but very smooth. There is a nice roasted maltiness too. I have not had this in the bottle yet, so I am not sure how much I can attribute to the oak aging. A very nice balanced beer. It was one of the first beers they ran out of at the fest and rightly so.

147,8951,Dantes,4.5,"Presentation: ~10oz. from draught in a tulip glass at the Stone 12 event. Served a bit cold. Cost: $5.  Appearance: Very nice pour, French butter-colored head with a dense, moussey consistency. Reduced to a thin, but lasting, opaque film. The body was a mahogany-reddish color and appropriately cloudy (surprisingly, the Double Bastard, Arrogant Bastard, and Old Guardian were very similar in color, varying by a shade or two). I was able to hold this to the daylight through the window.  Smell: The first notes are a prelude of hops, pine-tar, and some citrus fruit notes; quickly moderated by some sweetness and woody notes.  Taste: Surprisingly, this doesn&#8217;t assault the palate as expected. Rather, the junipery-pine notes are well-balanced by the malty sweetness, the deep, woody flavors, and some complex fruits. Tasted next to the &#8220;regular&#8221; Arrogant Bastard, one can tell that the flavor profile is smoothed by the wood, which adds vanilla notes and tames the hops to a certain degree. Flavors linger languorously, finishing well, with all of its elements standing until the end.  Mouthfeel: Full, silky, and luxurious. The carbonation is perfect; distributing the flavors but remaining unobtrusive.  Drinkability: Obviously very drinkable, but truly a complex beer worth savoring. I wish that this were something that was periodically available (limited enough to remain special) so that I could enjoy it in a quieter environment, on a quiet rainy weekend, along with a cigar and the Sunday paper.  This beer only got better as it warmed in my hand. Of the list of 12 beers available at this event, this ranked behind only the cask IPA in piquing my interest and desire to try; and it certainly didn&#8217;t disappoint. I mail-ordered a few bottles of Arrogant Bastard, but decided not to try them until after this event, so I had no preconceptions. Side-by-side with the &#8220;regular&#8221; AB on tap, this won hands down: smoother, more complex, better balanced. It had it all.  Bottom Line: A truly special experience for which I&#8217;m glad I was present. Thanks Greg!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Jason,4.6,On tap at the Blind Tiger. Deep hazed brick red brown colour with a special looking lace &#8230; one bad ass looking beer. A mad but &#8220;oh so confident&#8221; oily hop aroma with a one-two slap of faint alcohol and sweetness says &#8220;who&#8217;s your daddy&#8221;. The minty hop flavour puts the tongue in a headlock and the it drops a pungent grapefruit dropkick to the palate. Malt is there for the three count and vague hints of wood leaves a puckering dizzy feeling. This beer was like a suplex off of the top rope for me.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
147,8951,Todd,4.62,"Had on-tap at the Blind Tiger on 03/12/03. From the Stone website ""Special batch. Extremely rare. Only previously available at one location in Southern CA and one location in Arizona.""  A dark brown beer with a creamy off-white head; good retention. Aroma was incredible with a complex floral, herbal, citrus and woody nose. At first taste: creamy and smooth in the mouthfeel. Then strong mint, followed by strong hoppy/pine-y herbal flavour and juicy citrus (grapefruit!!); big hop bite. Oak anchors the big malty sweet flavours and carries thru to the dry finish with strong notes of wood.  Loved it; one of the highlights and I definitely prefer this over the non-oak version. The aging added a whole other depth of complexity and smoothness to the beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,93
