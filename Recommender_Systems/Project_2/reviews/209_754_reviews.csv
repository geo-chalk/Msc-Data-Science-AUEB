209,754,DMFF,3.6,"Just picked this up today for obvious reasons, but also to make Half & Halfs with (gotta show respect to my Irish Brothers out there). Decided to pour one out to try on its own since I haven't had one in about 5 years. This was the experience.  L: Deep, dark brown with uncut garnet highlights when held up to the light. A khaki head of 2 fingers forms. Leave extremely fine lacing on the glass.  S: Subtle smells of roasted malt, caramel, chocolate and coffee. Very slight on the nose.  T: Taste follows the nose with the addition of extremely subtle earthy hops. There's also the faintest flavor of lactose that plays well with the sweet flavors.  F: Light-bodied, yet extremely creamy and smooth.  O: Not bad, but definitely more mellow than I remember. Will definitely work for my Half & Halfs though!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,augustgarage,3.5,"Packaged 10/13/22 - enjoyed on 3/17/23. Poured from a pint can into a Duralex tumbler. Served at 60F.  Clear sienna body with half a finger of beige stiff peaks. Extremely fine, creamy lacing; superlative retention.  Subtle but persistent roast barley, caramel, faint coffee and chocolate in the nose. Low vaguely fruity esters.  Sharp yet flaccid palate entry with low but lasting bitterness balanced between roast barley and earthy/thyme-kissed hops. Creamy dry finish. Hints of stale herbs, cheap tobacco, instant coffee, and Lipton tea in the aftertaste.  Brisk, slightly astringent, and light-bodied - but simultaneously creamy, smooth, and luxurious thanks to the nitro.  While nearly style-defining, this flattens out what little character ""Extra"" still had.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,JE_SB,2.76,"14.9 ounce chilled can poured into a 20 oz pint glass. Try as I might I still can't read the freshness dates. Now the review: L: Dark brown/black with ruby highlights when held up to the light, bone white head of foam, good lacing on the glass S:Not much aroma then again I was never really able to pick up on the this T:A little sweeter than I remember and absolutely no bitterness. Just a hint of what might have been lactose powder F:Creamy smooth O:Not bad for what it is. My chief complaint is the can size. Either make it 12 ounces or a standard pint # 16 ounces and make it available in sixers or 12 instead of four and eight packs only. The absolutely hands down best pint of Guinness I had was in Dublin years ago. But since I can't afford to travel to Ireland these days I will just have to drink what I can get at my local package store instead. Tbh I was never a Guinness fan. There are other Irish dry stouts I prefer but those are very difficult to get in my neck of the woods.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

L: Clear dark brown which looks black in the glass, same stormy action you get on draft at a bar, one finger of tight creamy foam with good retention. S: Subdued nose , roasted malt, hints of sour dark fruit. T: Malty, roasty, woody hops on the back, a little watery from the nitrogen. F: Super silky smooth, medium body, thinner feel from nitrogen.

209,754,EagleDescent,5,"This is my favorite beer and go to! I'm under 25 years old, but have had nothing but stouts, porters, and ales. Not a fan of seltzers and the like.  I always have this beer in a bottle. Doing this review from memory as I'm trying Founders Breakfast stout and their porter.  L: Can't say much about this  Smell: Lots of coffee and chocolate, but with slight earthy notes.  Taste: Follows the nose, but the nitrogen adds a wonderful creaminess and body that's missing in the stuff from Founders. Not too bitter dark chocolate and coffee at the front and finishes nice and clean at the back with little to no hop bitterness.  M: As mentioned, wonderful creaminess and body. If you like La Colombe cold brew coffee, then you will love the feel of this stuff. Very low carbonation so it feels smooth when swallowing.  Overall: Prefer this over the stuff from Founders. If you are a beginner looking for a darker drink, then this should be your go to!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Whyteboar,4.02,"Poured stout black with dark brown highlights when held to the light. Nice tan head that left copious lacing. The taste is amazing for the ABV, dark fruit and coffee bitterness and cocoa all play nicely together in each sip. The feel is thinner than most, but then this is a sessionable stout so not expecting much in the way of body. Rather surprised I haven’t rated this yet, it’s a nice throwback for the stout world and one that I have to revisit every now and again.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,EmptyGlass420,4.56,"The legendary Guinness Draught; What a fantastic debut beer review.  Third beer of the day; one Belgian white and a Guinness. I will never review a beer if it's the first of the day.  Cool 16oz glass. I cracked the burnished gold tab and let the nitrogen/co2 slowly hiss out.  After pouring, there's a bit of fireworks in the glass, let them play it up. 100% fantastic head, moist as the freshest bread. Surface tension keeps it from bubbling over the glass edge, even as it rises above. The perfect pour every time.  Time for the first sip; Not my first rodeo with Guinness, I dive right in. Caramelly toast waft as this signature black beer cuts through the soft foamy head. Great mouthfeel as the cold rush of stout emulsifies with the head. Sweet chocolate and bitter malt on the tongue. As smooth as nice whisky. The first sip of Guinness is one of the best, 5/5.  Midway there's a bit of Irish bog to traverse, as while this isn't the thickest stout it's vast and muddy nonetheless. But the nice chocolaty bread really shines through even as it warms.  The last few sips are a bitter-tooth brew eater's paradise. As I finish the beer, residual head and newly sloshed foam splatter the glass artfully. The taste of malt on the last sip radiates out to fill your nose up playfully. Even with its mild 4.2% ABV, the bitterness gives me a bit of a woozy headspace.  As I grab another Guinness to fill my empty glass, I note the almost cakelike foam at the bottom. Scrumptiously bitter, yet may negate that aforementioned surface tension. Gotta get a fresh glass!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,dcat151,3.73,A classic. Beautifully poured with a dark black color and moderate tan head. Classic stout smell with hints of coffee and chocolate.

209,754,DrStevePhD,2.62,"Good milky texture, nice color, but the taste is rather muted. You get the typical coffee & chocolate notes you'd expect out of a stout but it almost tastes watered down while retaining a thicker texture.

Preconceived notions of too heavy happily did not come happen. This is good on a hot day. Pair with meat pies, pork, stews and chocolate.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Wattie83,3.98,"Poured from 14.9 oz can to stout glass. After watching it settle which is always an experience, you get a perfect black body with that nice ivory cap that sticks around and leaves a good deal of thick lacing on the glass. Smell is coffee, chocolate, and roasted barley. Taste is roasted grain, a bit of coffee and cream, Bitter up front and doesn't really sweeten up at all, it just kind of rounds off. Taste is muted some by the nitrogen induced by that widget. Feel is soft carbonation, creamy, yet light in mouthfeel. Just so easy to drink. Overall, just an excellent beer. Not overly complex, not the highest octane, but comfortable and traditional. I let it warm up quite a bit before drinking which helps bring out more flavor.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,GABronco,4.73,"Look - Iconic. If you're at a bar you can look around and pretty much tell who's drinking a Guinness. The dark color and perfect head are noticeable from across the room.  Smell - hints of coffee and chocolate mixed with a yeasty, bready goodness  Taste - Creamy, hints of coffee and chocolate flavors. The bitter notes hit me first, but they tone down quickly leaving a nice hint of aftertaste.  Feel - First time I had a Guinness I expected a ""meal in a glass"" but after drinking it, I have no idea where that comes from. Very light carbonation, so it's smooth going down and actually pretty light.  Overall - Yummy, creamy goodness. Maybe not the best stout out there, but certainly the most famous and one everyone should try.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,wadamslll,3.71,"I like both Guinness stout and their extra special stout. Probably prefer the latter.  That being said, it’s a solid good dark beer. In the bottle, it’s more a porter than a stout. It’s easy drinking and straight from bottle is fine for tonight. Smooth, hint of bitter and malt, Guinness never sucks. Even their infrequent bad batches are good.  Just wish it had a higher alcohol content.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,tekstr1der,3.91,"Still drink these on the regular, but prefer the carbonated ""extra"" version. Over the years I've grown a disdain for anything nitro, lending more a flat than smooth mouthfeel for me. Flavor is still great here, and the look of the pour is iconic.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,MikeWard,3.67,"14.9oz nitro can into a pint glass. Coding no help in determining age.  There are few beers that can match the look of a properly poured pint of Guinness. It gets a 5 every time.  Not much on the nose, a very faint coffee note.  On tasting, smooth, creamy, but with a significant bitter dry roast that is a bit jarring.  Mouth medium, finish that dry bitter roast. This is a lasting finish, one that I could do without.  Overall, haven't had this out of a can before, on draught i dont remember the strong finish. Certainly not the same beer i enjoyed in the 70's back in England.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,PapaGoom,4.03,"In my honest opinion, a traditionally poured guiness is one of the most underrated beers anywhere outside of Ireland itself. It competes with beers that sit at a significantly higher price point, and it is overall a remarkable beer for its respective price. I will admit; I am I little bit biased as stouts are my absolute favorite style of beer. However, it is a phenomenal go-to beer nonetheless.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,DaBeerNerd,4.89,"Poured from tap at a local bar. You can always tell if the pour is right because of the cascading head effect that goes on, very beautiful. Mouth feel is perfect. Head was long lasting and always there, as you would expect. Very dark in colour, as you would expect from a Guinness. Tastes of roasted barley, with a hint of chocolate and coffee. Again, it's a Guinness, you should expect a good beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,TheMatts,4.7,Amazing beer. It is finicky though. If it’s just right it’s a 5/5. If there is bad head and it’s overall watery it’s probably closer to a 3/5. Black appearance with a creamy head without a single air bubble. Smooth creamy taste that is so refreshing. A bit bitter in the back. Easy to put a couple of these down so be careful.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,JZH1000,3.62,"Poured from the nitro tall can The look is absolutely beautiful with the nitro cascade and the pitch black liquid then the nice guinness head that sticks around forever no complaints here.  Smell is quite light but creamy and dark with hints of chocolate. Quite a bit of fermentation character, and there isnt a whole lot more other than the malts. Quite light despite the color.  Taste follows the smell but with a definitive note of dark chocolate but muted with creamy notes. Very drinkable almost a light stout. Has all the dark flavor but with less complexity and bitterness than other stouts.  Feel is interesting because of the nitro. Very very creamy, and smooth going down. None of the bite from traditional carbonation though. I almost prefer that bite but that is up to personal preference. In my opinion it feels a little flat, but it's not the bubbles are just so tiny it makes a creamy texture.  Overall a good beer, but the extra stout is better In my opinion. This one just feels a bit weak in flavor, and mouthfeel, but the mouthfeel is mostly just me.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,2market,3.61,"I’ve had many a Guiness Stout over the years; both here in the USA and Ireland. Some say there is a difference, but both taste the same to me. Guiness is a solid staple.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,TheOccasionalBeer,2.67,"After the fffft from popping the top, a faint scent of hoppy molasses arose from the bottle. I was a little disappointed with the latte-foam head from the pour... no more than a finger and it thinned over the course of a minute or two to just a thin bubbly cap. In the glass it smelled sweeter, a blood-orange dark chocolate frosting with a hint of vanilla. When pouring, the color seemed a little pale but it did settle into a translucent cola color. I'm not getting that nice mouth feel that others have mentioned. It did start out creamy, but that quickly gave way to prickly carbonation and some bitter astringency when I swallowed. The taste was by far skewed toward hops. I saw someone describe this as a watered-down porter, and I won't disagree. This really is not the stout I was looking for.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Smell: Slight roasted coffee with a hint of chocolate  Taste: Slight dark coffee and chocolate taste, roasted malt is the most prevalent with a slight bitter finish.  Feel: Smooth and creamy due to the nitrogen.  Overall: This is the beer that got me into stouts and porters. A sessionable, light stout that's smooth on the way in, presents a roasted malt taste, and leaves with a slight bitter finish. A go-to for me.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

They heated the malt to the point of 500L and 300L malts and blended them together to get this carbon charcoal red color and fermented it anyway and well... people liked it! I am not one of those people, but I only have a pint of Guinness with my dad for St Patrick's day. On that day I will have 4 pints of Harp, 4 Pints of Smithwick's and then move to Guinness. This is not a starter beer. This is a low calorie low alcohol beer that is good with perpetual stew, bread, and also bangers and mash for Irish Breakfast the day of marching in a parade to ""piss on the queen"".",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,hankp59,2.35,It looks like Guinness stout and that’s about it. This has little smell and tastes more like a watery porter than a stout. It’s like drinking a stout light because everything is muted. Pass on this one.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,boblimbo13,3.08,"Drank this beer all summer, having done so I'm not sure if I'll drink Guinness anytime soon. It's very 'Guinessy'. It's what you expect when looking at it: thick, creamy, coffee tasting, smooth. If beer had a desert, this would be it. But because it's so distinctive and after you have become accustomed with the taste, it's hard to envision you drinking the beer in any common setting you would normally drink beer. The plastic ball in the can is also not very flattering.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,IanRT1,3.53,"L- It is a very dark brown almost black stout that slowly forms a really nice looking light brown almost latte-like head made up of really small bubbles that gives the beer a creamy texture. Probably my favorite looking commercial beer.  S- Really faint toasted malt aromas, I expected it to be a bit more aromatic but it is very insipid in this aspect.  T- The smell of toasted malts are more present when you taste it but not as much as I would like, I also detect some notes of nuts such as almonds or cashews and with a hint of yeasts from the brewing process. There are not much hops present in the taste but I detect a very faint hoppy bitter aftertaste.  F- The beer itself is a bit watery but the head gives the beer a really nice creamy texture that I really enjoy so make sure you put a really nice thick head.  O- Really good beer for being a commercial one. I would prefer the taste to be a little stronger, more malty like the bottled one but I really enjoy the texture and the casual taste it gives. I could drink 2 of these or more no problem by itself or with some food. I will definitely try this again when I can.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,MartinWachsmann,3.78,"Kind of overrated beer for me. Was really looking forward for a pint of this legendary beer in Ireland. Turns out it tastes a bit weaker than I would expect. Not great not terrible. I personally don’t like dark beers that much but i gave this a chance. I wasn’t surprised, nor disappointed. Would say 3,6 - not great, not terrible.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,RadMan18,3.88,"Ah, Guinness. The go-to Irish Dry that can be found anywhere, and luckily its a pretty good stout!  This stout was from a 4 pack of nitro cans. Pours deep black into my traditional pint glass. At first pour, the beer is full of foams that coalesces upward into a 3/4in creamy head with bubbles so fine they are impossible to make out with the naked eye. The tan cream head floating on top of a black liquid can only be found elsewhere in a root beer float. As with a root beer float, this is certainly a treat.  While having an impactful look, the smell is more subtle of malt, roasted grain, and a slight bitterness. I really don’t pick up the coffee or more nuanced smells that other reviewers get.  The taste of Guinness isn’t something novel or noteworthy. It has a simple palate of malt, roast, earthy minerals and maybe if you really look for it the bite of coffee without the traditional flavor of coffee. It is balanced, smooth and nonoffensive.  The feel is where the Irish Dry Stouts are absolutely loved by beer drinkers like me. To be such a dark color with a creamy head you’d think it would be thick and strong. However, an Irish Dry is remarkably cool, refreshing and disappears before going down making it a light feeling beer. Guinness has perfected this feeling with its heavy entry and light exit as if half the beer transported away somewhere between the tip of my tongue and the back of my mouth. It is a unique and refreshing feeling.  Overall, a Guinness stout is the staple example of an Irish Dry Stout and is remarkable in its consistency, world-wide delivery quality, and provenance. While the flavors aren’t something to write home about, the holistic experience of the feel, look, smell, and taste make it a national treasure to Ireland and I can definitely see why. Guinness is my go-to Irish Dry. Although in Ireland, I did enjoy Beamish slightly more from the tap. However, here in the states, long live Guinness!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Barnettaidan81,3.47,"Actually, my first Guinness ever. I’ve used it for cooking brats before (doing that now), but I’ve actually never tried one until now. I knew I liked it for cooking but have always heard very mixed reviews on it, so I’ve just stuck with styles and beers I know I like. Overall, I really dont see what all the fuss is about, positive or negative. It’s just not anything very special. It pours smooth, the color of cola, but a bit clearer. Not so clear you can see through the glass, but you can definitely tell it’s truly a dark brown, with a bit of a burgundy hue, not a black like I expected from it. Head is pretty small, only about one finger, if that, with a few rocky bubbles but mostly fine bubbles nestled in compactly with each other. Also not entirely what I’d expected. The smell is a bit faint. I can certainly smell some dark chocolate notes, and heavy malt, but nothing that really punches you in the face. I expected a smell that would immediately say “I’m a f***in Guinness!”. Just wasn’t there. Feels smooth going down, a little more roughly carbonated than I like in a stout, but still quite smooth. It tastes a bit earthy, with lots of coffee notes, and certainly a bit of chocolate on the finish, but overall, just not really “wowed” by it. It’s alright. I finish the extra one I bought and probably not have another one unless someone has it on hand at a dinner or bbq. It’s not a bad beer, but it’s not awesome either. Just somewhere in the middle. I’d say it’s mostly on point for a stout as far as texture and WHAT flavors you get off of it, but I vastly prefer a very strong stout to this. Again, really not sure why this beer seems to be so polarizing. Some LOVE it. Some HATE it. Not really seeing where either of those fit in.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Tony787,4.02,i bought a can at the lcbo in ontario . i know they put a ball widget into the can with beer because of the nitrogen anyways there is a special way to pour this beer into your glass and i made sure i did this correctly . the pour was hard and 2 mins later it settled into my glass with a 2finger head. rich and tasty malts with a hint of coffee . almost like a milkshake cold coffee the beer left a 1finger head all the way to the end. i enjoyed this stout beer at 4.2% but it feels like 5% . never drink this beer out of the can always pour in glass hard . Overall this beer is classic i love the way it's poured and then watch it closely then get ready to drink it Cheers,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,GrandpaMiltysMalts,3.29,"Was really looking forward to this, and have to say I was a bit disappointed. Clearly the initial look was fabulous given the nitro widget. Thick, creamy tan head and the first couple sips were silky smooth given the nitro. And the dark malt bitters (not really hops) were a nice complement to the initial creamy feel. Unfortunately it falls apart after a good opening. There was little lacing and the head collapses to a thin white veneer. While there was no tinny aftertaste (I'm pointing at you Boddingtons), the flavor profile descended to something like slightly bitter dark water ... not unpleasant but not a lot there. Maybe the solution is to knock one back in 5 mins and move on to the next beer?",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BPVandenbroek,3.8,"Guinness Draught pours into my glass deep, sullen, ruby red in color, just verging on pitch black. The head is dense, mousse like, and coffee cream in color. The head is lasting.  Up front aromas give me something minerally in nature. It's somewhere in between naturally occurring chalk formations and smelling the ocean itself. Hints of roasted coffee lend immediate support before moving into what smells like a combination of caramel and nuttiness. Everything combines to give Guinness' nose a slightly leathered quality before moving on to a short, cropped finish.  On the tongue, Guinness is full, smooth, and luscious. Mineral flavors up front remind me somehow of the sea before moving into very subtle hints of roasted dark grain. Hints of caramel provide a pleasant, but not overpowering sweetness. There's also that little bit of nuttiness helping Guinness keep its overall structure. Flavors finish off with a nice little hit of roasted coffee before fading into the night.  Guinness is full, rich, and smooth. It's pleasant and balanced in its own right. For such a dark, full bodied beer however, it lacks a certain level of assertiveness or robustness in its flavor and aroma. Which is all the more disappointing when you consider that Guinness is THE original Irish stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The nose is straightforward roasted malt and with hint of coffee. Not much hops. On the palate there is more roasted malt with a bit if chocolate sweetness. It is thick and heavy feeling, but not heavy drinking. The low ABV keeps it drinkable while being chewy, a huge plus. It is not sweet and sticky, but rich and smooth.

That said, it's still pleasant. On tap this tastes pretty good. Pretty much just roasted malt and maybe faint coffee notes coming off it. Something's weird with the acidity it doesn't really blend well with the roasted malt for me. Super simple taste. The mouthfeel is quite full on this beer which I think is a big part of the beer's identity. Mouthfeel is pleasant.

If L corresponds to the month, then this was canned in December 2020? If so, this is around 2 months old.  Look: Pours the classic nitro cascade with a very dark almost black with brown highlights and a super fluffy tan head. Nice lacing. Can't deny that it looks awesome.  Smell: The nose is somewhat closed here, but some of the notes that I am getting are surprising - red wine / red grape must. Roasted malt / weak coffee aroma, hazelnuts. Smells mildly bitter.  Taste: Up front - bitter roasted malt notes, weak coffee, and hazelnuttiness. Unsweetened chocolate with fruity notes. Acidity is higher than expected. The finish is creamy, super dry, bitter, and long-lasting.  Feel: I was expecting a bit more from the mouthfeel. It looks super creamy, but it is a very thin beer. The body is very light and it's quite a contrast from the creamy head. Not so surprising because I know that this is essentially a light beer at 4.2% ABV. But it is a sheep in wolf's clothing.  Overall: It's been years since I drank a Guinness. It's certainly not bad, but it's not special either. For what it is, it's a decent pub beer that is widely consumed and it is a very approachable stout.

Left off with little bitterness, and a nutty aftertaste. Extremely faint herbal notes. F - Nice and creamy. Different type of carbonation (nitrogen) than other beers, so it doesn't ""feel"" carbonated. Refreshing is an understatement. O - Written with a little bias - this is my go-to bar beer. Goes great with nearly every kind of food, almost always on sale, and always tastes like good memories. My personal bias aside, it's a great ""cheap"" beer. Can't go wrong with it.

The aroma is sweet cocoa flavored malts. Instantly this was very noticeable since popping the cap off the bottle. The taste is slightly dry, but sweet roasted coffee with the cocoa nibs at the end of the sip. There is nothing bitter here at all. The feel is medium, not creamy, but not thin either.

I did expect a very more foamy pour, given the addition of nitrogen.  Aromas of faint licorice, coffee roast, and berries.  Well, perhaps this does not register as my favorite stout or even in the top ten, but it does manage to impart some decent flavors of roasted malt, mild chocolate, and a faint sourness (in a good way).

209,754,Garethcullenuk,4.83,"My favourite pub drink by far, just so smooth and easy to drink. Very little gas once settled and must be left to settle properly before drinking. To many places employ bar staff who rush the pour and get it wrong, other places get the gas wrong and it spoils the taste. In a bad pub this will taste watery and lifeless. In a good bar this will taste like you’ve won the lottery. Anywhere in Ireland is the best place to drink it. Certain places everywhere else will serve a good pint of Guinness. Not worth drinking it canned, it doesn’t do it justice. Always reminds me of coffee for some reason when I drink it, will fill you up quickly so best not drunk after a full meal, and it won’t get you drunk in a hurry, best drunk indoors as the cold version doesn’t have the same flavours in my opinion.

There's a ""brightness"" to it, the sensation of a crisp sweet apple. Finish lingers pleasantly with bitter roast malt. Very light effervescence owing to the nitro, without feeling flat.  Looks don't get any better, will give it that. The taste is simple but delicious for any occasion.

A thick off white head that pours 2 fingers tall from a hard pour. That nice light roasty note that is trade mark to Guinness. Light roast and light sweetness that tastes fairly close to what I remember draft Guinness to be (its been over 10 years since I have drank a draft pint of Guiness). Not as creamy as draft pour, but that is to be expected...it came from a bottle. This was way better than I expected out of the bottle. Just doesn't have the magic in the appearance and mouthfeel of a nitrogenated draft pour of Guinness. Still not sure why they want you to drink it out of the bottle...",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Your first McNugget, your first tongue twister from what’s her face... And Guinness is kind of that, but I’m not going to do it dirty like that. It’s fine for what is it - no doubt. A bit light, but creamy and smooth (hey, that kind of reminds me of Raul).

I might as well point out the elephant in the room, this beer is no better than any american domestic, it anything, it is worse. As a sub 21 adult, i had been pressed to try “craft beer” (which i now love). I was told by guiness fans, this this was “way better than my watery piss beer” (pabts). Having tried this beer on 3 separate occasions, I can say it went into the sink 2/3 times. If you speak to my friends, you would know this is a big deal. I assumed that craft beer was for chumps, and stuck to my pabst. Later, being introduced to Vt craft beer; i learned it was dope, and assumed I just didnt like dark beer? Also wrong, after having not shitty dark beer. Moral of the story? Like guiness? Like pabst? Good for you. But dont talk trash on other peoples favorites, because someone hates your beer.

Impossible not to love the way this beer looks.  Smell: Very subtle roasted malt.  Taste: Light wood,, hint of roast beef, watery. Subtle springs to mind as a descriptor.  Feel: Creamy and soft, fills your mouth like smoke. Flat, no active carbonation. Super dry finish.  This beer is the perfect example of the parts being greater than the sum. The look and feel are world class. The smell and taste pedestrian and underwhelming. Best served on tap, but I don't dislike the trademarked can. Overall a B.

Off-white creamy two-finger head that recedes to half a finger and keeps form. So persistent in fact, my last sip was the head. Lacing is healthy leaving creamy residue. Notice the operative word is creamy. As for aromas and flavours, mostly malt and coffee. No carbonation to speak of and very low, if any, bitterness. I guess the taste is a bit on the safe side but it's light and very smooth. A light stout that goes down like a Pilsner. Great to just chill and watch a pandemic go by.

Nice, dark ruby brown with the unmistakable head that is soft and follows the ale all the way down the glass. Slight roast flavor up front followed by a gentle bittersweet chocolate flavor. Smooth and silky. Light-bodied with a signature dry finish. The original session beer for me.  It's a classic for a reason. My understanding is it has been brewed this way since 1959 (per Guinness tout) to commemorate the 200 year anniversary. It's been a staple ever since, for good reason.

The body of the beer is black and it has a slightly off-white cap that looks laser-cut. The head is short and has very good retention and lacing. It is a very classic appearance.  Aroma: There is very little aroma. There is a light hint of roasted grains with just a bit of carbon.  Taste: There is a light carbon note to the beer and a very light woody character. Very mild roasted grain flavor.  Mouthfeel: It is very smooth and it coats the palate very well. It feels dry and clean with a nice full body that isn't heavy. Very good bitterness.  Overall: It is a easy to drink Irish Dry Stout with a pleasant body and just enough aroma and flavor to keep things interesting. It isn't the most aromatic or flavorful beer but it is enjoyable to drink because as a whole the beer elements all complement each other, with the bitterness adding some quality to the roasted grain flavor and the roasted grain flavor accenting the light carbon aroma.

Zero bite from carbonation.  Overall: This was definitely not what I expected. It was a decent sip and drinks a lot like a very thin porter. It was too cold when served, which hid the bitterness at first. It has a very mild chalky bitterness that shows up at the end as the beer warms. Makes a great head when poured.

Guinness stout, the real thing, consumed on tap in pubs with friends. Among the slogans then, ""Guinness is good for you,"" and we believed it. I still do. They say the real thing can't be successfully exported, even to England. It gets seasick they say.

Coloration is dark brown to black with no opacity. Smell is a bit sweet (some chocolate, some coffee) with a nice but of maltiness. Taste matches the scent well, with just a touch of bitterness entering in. The feel of Guinness has always fascinated me: on the lighter, wetter side with a slightly bitter aftertaste.

This is very similar to Guinness Extra Stout in my opinion, but in its own right, different and more mysterious. With the same full body look/ flavor and coffee black color: this particular Irish Dry Stout has subtle notes of bread, roasted malt/hops, and chocolate. For how dark it is, you'd expect it to be more aggressive, but this brew is easily drinkable at 4.2% ABV, and has a smooth creamy finish. Will drink again.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,graysonslamsbrews,3.12,"Poured from a 14.9 oz (440ml) can into a pint glass, refilling after a couple sips.  Look: Dark brown haze fades into black with depth. Thick, creamy tinted head looks like a pillow that sits on top of the beer. Like other stouts, the bubbles to sink instead of rise, giving a curdling effect. Not violent, but slow and soft. Smell: Dark roasted hops like mocha and brown sugar. Taste: Not as sweet as one would expect and with a not unpleasant result. Rather, it's pretty dry. Has a malty sort of mild bitter dark chocolate aftertaste on the back of the tongue but isn't heavy and syrupy like a sweet chocolate or PB stout. Feel: Creamy beer accompanied by frothy head, but not really with any carbonation at all. Kinda like those super soft faux-fur blankets in beer form, especially when just poured. Not so heavy. It's an okay beer. Not super refreshing nor deep in character, but a good social beer and pretty light too at 125 cal/12oz.

209,754,kemoarps,3.71,"From the special edition release can. Say what you will about the gimmicky nature of it, there is no denying that the 'widget' makes for an absolutely gorgeous glass of beer. A good finger and a half or so of ashy grey head sits atop a cascade effect of nitrogen bubbles racing through the almost-black liquid. Once the cascade is done, you could be forgiven for mistaking the liquid for black. It's not. This is highlighted when held up to the light and you can see a ruby/garnet clear colour, and not just at the edges. That head laaasts too...  Nose is faint, but roasty dry. Some ashy malt and loose grain. Maybe a touch of dull noble-esque hops.  Flavour is dry overall, but with a small glimmer of sweet undercurrent. Thin front half that sells out for the silky mouthfeel, but catches up as it works across the palate, offering roast and ash and a pleasant bitter coffee finish.  Smoothe and silky, though fairly thin (I realize this is partly just a hallmark of the style, but I do prefer a little more chew to my dark beers).  I honestly think that if this beer were produced by more of a craft darling brewery it would get pretty high marks. It's pretty quintessentially the style, and is drinkable and enjoyable. I think working against it are that it's such a mass produced product so it doesn't have the 'intangibles' that might elevate the perception of a smaller breweries offering as well as just kind of the dilemma of dry irish stouts everywhere: they are labelled as a stout, so people (or at least I) instinctively want something big rich deep heavy etc. That's not what this style is. That's not what it's supposed to be. It almost seems to have more in common with like a dark mild than for example a russian imperial. So perception again skews against it. I dunno. Maybe I'm way off base and just taken in by a neat marketing trick and feeling generous. But I do think that it's essentially the beer that created the style and is an enjoyable enough brew, even if I'm likely to reach for other options over it most of the time.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,Thisdrinkinglife,4.16,"Review: 75cl can of Guinness Draught: 4.2% vol.  Established way back in 1759, Guinness with its iconic Classic harp logo and black coloured can, complete with Arthur Guinness’ scribble. Has the widget inside it too, a small plastic ball containing the nitrogen, needed for the rise of the bubbles to form that fine creamy head we all know and love so well.  One of those beers that is on the 1001 beers to try before you die list. Well I have drank so many pints of Guinness over the years I must be reincarnated to level of Buddhist master super level of awesomeness.  As expected the appearance is spot on and what one would expect from Guinness, a massive frothy and creamy white head that is alive and takes a while to settle, all with a pitch black colour. Once the dust has settled, we have a very decent looking stout, the iconic Guinness look just right in front of me waiting to be drank. Looks great, the widget did the business!  Soft carbonation and a good bit of lacing. Head sticks around throughout.  An aroma of roasted malts with coffee and chocolate smells, nice and inviting on the nose, pleasant aromas.  For the taste I got lovely creamy mouthfuls at the start, nice and soft going down smoothly at the back of my throat.  Not a bad taste overall, very smooth and softer than what you would get in the pub from the tap. That is the difference really, the cans lack that bite that you’d have in the pint at the bar.  A slow burner, light sweet tastes, nice chocolate flavours, and a thin body, it is ok. Lovely creamy texture throughout. Nice roasted malts and barley, bitterness is not as pronounced as you’d expect, very manageable.  An enjoyable drink but comparing it to what you get in the pub is not really comparing like with like. But still it is smooth, tasty, satisfying and very easy to drink, soft and velvety on the tongue, so still a very enjoyable drink from the can.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,DrBeergood,5,"From the start, admittedly, I'm biased towards the Guinness. I love the Guinness. From the bottle, unfortunately, isn't as creamy as from the can, or from the tap.

I drink these quite often and usually on tap, but for the review I used a special edition 14.9 ounce can with the nitro widget. My first impression about a Guinness: As a coffee drinker, I drink coffee to start my day with a very nice roasted blend, enjoy the feeling, smell and well-being. Guinness is exactly that, except it is an end of the work day relaxing beer, best served cold and either in a bar or at home but with friends or good company of course. It is more of an acquired taste, but you can definitely sense the craftiness and attention put into this beer upon its creation to give it that roasted, grainy smooth and earthly feel.  Look: Dark almost black, large white/yellow foamy head Smell: Earthy, fresh grass and morning mist ( like an Irish hillside) Taste: Exactly how it smells Feel: Very smooth, not very carbonated, but leaves the palate asking for more every time  Would I recommend?

Appearance: Pours out like a coke, then puts on a beautiful cascading act in the glass. Once this is finished, it takes on the traditional stout look with ruby color around the bottom. Guinness produces over two fingers of what has to be the most creamy sand colored head that a beer ever produced.  Aroma: Roasted malts, light coffee, and chocolate are all on the nose with the malts actually seeming to have so depth to them. No one aspect is very pronounced, but it smell nice.  Taste: Here is where we have some issues. First, Guinness is terribly thin, not a whole lot more substantial than water. The taste, while presenting a pleasant dry roasted bitter malt profile, never really amounts to much else. Yes, there is some chocolate and a mild coffee flavors, but this is a beer seems fearful of being what it should be. The widget in the can does give it a ridiculously creamy texture though. To sum Guinness up, it has been nice to revisit and old staple, but it simply cannot stand up to its craft brethren such as Deschutes Black Butte Porter.

Beautifully rich and creamy with an absolutely perfect, creamy, white-tan head. As you drink it the head sticks up to the top of the glass. You cannot beat this appearance. SRM of 23 (4.25  Aroma: Mild aroma of bittersweet cocoa, dry roasted grains, lactose, and cream. Some roasted grain malt in the background underneath. Some bitterness. (3.75)  Flavor: Flavor of milk chocolate, roasted grain malt and even some dark coffee in the background. Encompasses the full flavor profile of a stout. Little to no hops or bitterness. Flavor is sort of watery. (3.50)  Feel: Sooo smooth. So Milky & Creamy. Goes down smoother than chocolate milk. It is no wonder the Irish picked this as their staple beer. (4.00)  Compared to Left Hand Brewing's Nitro Milk Stout 3/16/21: Pours a similar color with a stronger, whiter head. Dryer and roastier aromas of dry cocoa and black malt. A lighter body, and cleaner.  Compared to Surly's Razor Gang 4/27/21: Pours a similar color, lighter head. More bittersweet chocolate and roast. Less milk chocolate and sweet cream.  to Breckenridge Nitro Stout: Pours a similar color, slightly darker head. Milder aromas. More roasted black malt and bittersweet cocoa. Less milk chocolate and slightly lighter.  Compared to Murphys Stout 3/2023: Pours similar, milder head. Milder aromas. More dark grains, roast, bitterness. Less smooth creamy body and chocolate flavor. Lighter overall. Winner: Murphy's  Overall: When you want a beer and are considering any of American macrolagers, stop yourself and ask yourself rather whether you rather want a Guinness. This beer incorporates flavors of chocolate, roasted grain malts, and even coffee into a drinkable Irish stout that is so smooth, you'll ask yourself why you don't live in Ireland. It defines the light beer version of a stout. So well done and a tradition, you can't go wrong with a Guinness.

209,754,Larryfunnell,4.18,"I started drinking Guinness in an Irish bed and breakfast, served to me by a lovely Irish lass just after St. Patrick's Day in 1998. Since then I have had a few every March in celebration. It used to be my gold standard for a stout, and is still good, but lacks some of the character of others with coffee and/or chocolate notes. The beer pours a wonderful dark black and I love watching the bubbles go down the side of the glass. It is not as bitter as I remember, probably due to changing tastes on my part, and has a smooth creamy taste that lingers on the tongue. Overall I quite like it, but not near enough to have an exclusive relationship with it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,IronLover,3.66,"From a nitro can. Black in color. Poured with a moderate, creamy, almond white foam with excellent retention. Dark malt and light roasted malt aromas. Medium light bodied with a light creamy feel. Dark malt flavors up front that slowly turn roasty. Roasted flavor expands through the middle introducing bitter roasted flavors and charred malt near the end. Finished dryly with lingering bitter, charred malt flavors that slowly fade. Great look and pleasant aromas. Feel is generally thin and the charred malt flavors hurt the drinkability. Their foreign export stout is far better.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Long, dry aftertaste. F: Ever so smooth but also a tad thin. O: This is nowhere near as good as the velvety pints of Guinness I enjoyed every Sunday evening at the Prince Christian pub in Windsor (long since gone).

209,754,pattpass,4.56,"Guinness is my most controversial recommendation. It is a beer that is supposed to be drank from a can instead of a bottle, and is supposed to be poured into a can to let the drink ""breath."" If you are at a bar, your bartender should know how to pour Guinness from the tap. They will make you wait a few seconds, and it's to pour the glass in the proper way.  Never drink Guinness out of a bottle, only out of a can. The can contains a ping pong ball called a ""widget."" You literally have to watch a 2 minute youtube video that describes the pour technique. It's a bit pompous, but it's worth the watch to fully enjoy the drink the way it was meant to be drank.  It's rare, but Guinness actually has bad batches. It's the reason why I'm dinging a few points off of my rating in taste.  However when Guinness is poured it is a sight to be seen. It's brown color turns into a dark black with a contrasting white foam. It's taste is slightly bitter, but with a rich creamy taste. It is a drink I absolutely adore Guinness. It's always in my fridge, waiting for me after a long day at work. Stouts are a controversial drink and it's because the style is so varied with dry stouts with subtly bitter yet creamy taste all the way to other beers with really high alcohol content with a nauseatingly sweet taste that is off putting. I believe their is a stout style for everyone, you just have to find it.  Guinness is not for everyone, and I acknowledge that beer reviewing is a subjective topic, but if you enjoy Guinness feel free to follow the other stout reviews I'll write for more information on similarly tasting stouts.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,DarthStoutDrinker,5,"The stout by which all others are rightfully judged and ultimately come up short. If you don't like Guinness you are wrong.  Guinness is my favorite beer of all time. Back when your only options for beer in the US were Bud, Bud Lite, and Coors, this beer was my savior. I will never forget that and am eternally grateful to it.  Guinness is my go to beer when I've had a few too many and I feel like shit. It soothes me and comforts me in the way that only that girl that got away can.  Best enjoyed fresh in a Dublin bar; good from a tap and good from a can marked DRAUGHT. Don't pronounce it ""drot"". It's the cool way to spell ""draft"". The cans are nice because they release some magical combination of nitrogen and carbon dioxide that give the beer it's smooth and creamy head.  Hey waiters at shitty restaurants. Yeah, I'm talking to you. Don't pop the top and just dump the can in a glass if your shitty restaurant doesn't have Guinness on tap. That is wrong-headed. Poor it along the side of a pint glass for God's sake.  This truly is one of the best beers you can commonly find.

209,754,osheamatth,4.26,On draft many places. Prior to 1990 Guinness draft in the US was not handled properly. Stored too cold. Not pushed up with the right nitrogen. Overall a pale comparison to a pint in Ireland. After 1990 the brewery began to send stout gurus across the Us in and effort to improve and standardize what a proper pint of the black should be. By and large they succeed as long as the bar maintains the standard and the beer is turned around. Perfect black the. Burgundy when backlit.

The cascading head settling into a 1/2 inch off-white foam on top of a very dark brown almost black beer, and the head has a bit of lacing as the beer goes. Scent is a faint roasted barley, and not much else. Taste is surprisingly very mellow, more roasted malty flavor that is very even thru the mouthful. Feel is interesting-- surprisingly light, evenly carbonated, with a creamy finish. Finish is not as dry as the name 'draught' implies, and is pretty clean overall with a very slight roasted taste that remains.  This beer surprised me. It is not heavy at all, nor is it as dry or bitter as I originally thought. A very sessionable stout beer overall, I can even see this beer being refreshing in the summer if it is very cold.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,Bsimpson91,4.94,"Lighter stout with good flavor. Drank from the limited edition bottle so i can't comment on the pour or the beautiful surge. The presentation is very cool as far as the label is concerned. Beginning with smell. The aroma I get from this guiness is somewhat like olives. Also seemingly reminds me of barbecue sauce. Aroma is a tad muted. Now for taste, the flavor is lighter than the extra stout. The top end is very dull. As you sip, the flvor builds up into a nice dark malt character with some fairly good hop bitterness. The end is dry. So far, the flavor is not intense as I imagine stout to be. There is no top end sweetness or depth. Im not completely satisfied with it and was expecting a little more. The feel is simular to milk or cream. Sort of ompsous with very little carbonation. The beer is extremely smooth and very easy to drink. Overall, this is a good well made ale but could use some depth like its extra stout counterpart.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

You can disagree, but then you’d be wrong.  There is little to smell, and the taste is simple. I’ll suggest, however, a beer doesn’t need an initial 32 flavor notes and a slowly evolving flavor profile to qualify as incredible. When simple is nearly perfect, it is. That’s a Guinness.  Mouth feel is incredible, like nearly any nitro would be.  Overall, this is your go to sessionable stout, available in every grocery store and most gas stations.

The cascade is the best part of pouring a Guinness. As someone who lives in Canada, this is a great winter beer to be kept by a window near or your back door or basement concrete floor and enjoyed after a hard day of work.

The bitterness from the roast is there but i wouldn't call it bold. Easy to drink, low-medium carbonation.  It's not bad i was just expecting a more fulfilling robust beer.

The taste is similarly light; there are certainly stouts that pack more of a punch, but there’s not a fault to be found in the lightly bittered blend of toasty flavors.

209,754,kboe1313,3.6,"My favorite part of the beer was the head, it was surprisingly creamy! The body was light, for being so dark there was little flavor, somewhat watery, though I picked up roasted notes, coffee like. A bitter hops flavor was noticable at the end. Not a bad session beer, a step up from the American Macro lagers",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,MNAle,3.55,"Poured from the nitro widget can into a Guinness glass. The 14.9 fl oz can doesn't do the Guinness glass justice... doesn't even reach the mid-point of the harp, with the head just barely topping the harp. Mild aroma. Surprising. I expected more from the roasted malt. It's there, along with hints of coffee, but very subdued. Deep dark black color, with tinges of brown around the edges. 1/2 inch very thick creamy slightly off-white head that hangs around for a long time. Thick, creamy lacing when you tip the glass to take a drink. Gorgeous appearance overall. This beer looks the part, better than just about any other stout. The mouth feel is thin but creamy, if that makes any sense at all. The smooth feel likely comes from the nitro widget. Toasty malt taste, coffee, but still quite mild. Just a hint of fruit in there somewhere. Surprisingly simple flavor. Little bittering until the finish and aftertaste, then it hits pretty strongly. This is the iconic Irish dry stout, and is very drinkable and reasonably flavorful considering its ABV.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,FBarber,3.92,"Pours a dark brown, ruby around the edges and almost completely ruby colored when held to the light. One-inch head dissipates somewhat, but keeps a thick full residual velvet head. Velvet lacing coats the glass as the beer is consumed.  Aroma has notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, condensed milk, roasted malts, and a touch of sweetness on the nose.  Taste has notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malts, and bitter earthy hops come through and linger on the palate. On the sweeter side than some of the other examples I’ve had given the more prominent milk chocolate notes. A touch of tobacco like notes come through as the beer warms.  Feel is very light and smooth, medium bodied. Light to mild carbonation.  Overall a well-done example of the style. The nitro does the flavor no favors, but it’s well crafted.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,NotAlcoholicJustAHobby,3.73,Nitro can  L- The beer pours a dark brown to black with the nitro cascade give it the appearance of cream poured into coffee. The head is typical of a nitro beer with tan dense head made up of tiny bubbles. The head has stuck around and not receded as I type this review up. S- The nose gives off a toasty quality. There are hints of chocolate and coffee but are rather faint behind the toast. T- The palate is almost the opposite of the nose. Up front there is a light roasty coffee aspect. That is quickly overridden by a slightly sweet creamy aspect. F- The nitro actually does it's job here. The beer while still being slightly thin has a nice creaminess that adds to the enjoyment. Overall I'd give the mouthfeel a medium grade. O- I find that I enjoyed this one more than the Murphy's. This guinness can is not quite as bitter or dry as the Murphy's and that's the way I prefer it. I'll have no problem finishing the other 3 cans.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

I preferred the Brawler, which had a richer flavor; like a light Vienna Lager. The Guinness had a great looking, creamy head but was more watery in feel and had a less pronounced flavor. It was fine though with some nuttiness, roasted grain and light chocolate. I did enjoy it for St. Patrick's Day.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Darcola,3.84,"Guinness draft is a simple go to beer if you want something drinkable, easy, and relatively cheap. It's got a great taste, great mouthfeel, and is an all around classic stout.  Look: dark brown, almost black, with a surge of nitro at the pour, culminating in a thick creamy head.  Smell: toasty malts, some coffee, and dark chocolate.  Taste: malts, light coffee taste, hints of dark chocolate, similar to the nose. Rather light compared to others but very drinkable. Not too filling.  Mouthfeel: Guinness shines here. The nitro makes the beer soft and bubbly, almost like drinking black silk. Lingering head really bolsters this.  Overall: a classic, drinkable beer. Especially good if you don't care for Budweiser, Miller, or other more watery beers, and want flavor without the price. It may be a lighter tasting stout but it's overall pretty damn good.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,Piwo,3.75,"Look: Amazing dark color, and lots of carbonation making for a large, frothy head that dissipates rather quickly. Smell: Mostly of malt and a slight hint of coffee, as is expected of a stout. Taste: Compared to other stouts, kind of watery, but still has the characteristic roasted flavor. The coffee taste comes out as it warms. A bit more refreshing than other stouts at the price of some flavor. Not too bad. Feel: Noticeably thinner than most other stouts, as I expect of a lower ABV. Not much body but still a crisp finish. Overall a good stout for those first trying one. It was my first stout, and still my go-to when I'm looking to drink stout but not wanting anything too heavy.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,JeffH_SC,3.05,"Looks great as it’s being poured. Always lots of carbonation. Nice dark color. Light malty fragrance. Feels very thin for a stout. If you’re palate is accustomed to a light American Adjunct Beer, the flavor may seem strong and heavy. However, if your palate has been used to good stouts and porters then this may seem like a light beer. This is the beer that moved me from drinking AABs to more flavorful beers...a crossover beer for me. And lots of restaurants carry this beer when there are no other real beers available and it is my choice when all else is light beers or AAB or lagers (beers for mass production, not taste). Not a bad alternative.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Azmarul,3.55,"I think that Guinness looks awesome in a nice thick glass. The head looks like creamy perfection and the deep color is almost completely black. I also enjoy watching the nitrogenated carbonation descend after pouring. As far as taste, it is a highly drinkable beer, but lacks the subtlety and complexity of many other stouts. The best things it has going for it are appearance and mouth feel, which is enjoyable creamy.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It pours a beautiful cascade waterfall of frothy and creamy bubbles with a great head. The aroma is dark coffee with a sweet medley of burnt wheat and malt.

Most dont realize how light a beer the draught is, 4.2% ABV, less calories than Amstel, floats on your IPAs (and sweetens/ tempers them in Black and Tans) and pleases the ladies. I often order a black and tan /ipa when out to keep things lighter. To me Guinness or coffee are about the only additives to beer that work.  a) Black body with a roiling head from a 14.9 oz nitro can, creamy light tan head remains dense, lasts, laces. s) While the aroma begins light, by the half way mark on the glass, it's coffee, charcoal, and dark roasted malts. t) Flavor is more ample especially at cask temp - extremely smooth, coffee, roast malt, a bit of faint hop, creamy. f) While creamy, it's also light, thin, and refreshing.

The smell is that of the standard chocolate and earth that any stout has, with a metalic scent from the can however not in a bad way by any means.  Taste is my least favorite of the Guinness experience. It's very bland with a huge disappointing lack of flavor. The smell is where most of the taste comes from. It has its own unique, one of a kind taste that can be enjoyed but the extra dry stout is slightly bland overall.  Feel is second to none. The nitrogen carbination is a special feel that is very different from your typical CO2 carbonation. You hardly notice the carbonation not giving it the overcabination (like Budweiser and Blue Moon have) even thought it was carbonated the second you opened the can.  Overall its very unique only lacking in flavor of all things. Look And Feel take the cake on this one. Excellent as a dessert or with a dessert.  Worth a try by all means.

209,754,Reiddrinksbeer,4.39,In my opinion Guinness draft is one of the best beers ever. The look of the beer is unmatched when poured into a pint glass. The smooth creamy but yet ever so delicate and light mouthfeel is a thing of beauty. The taste is of coffee and dark roasted malt at just the right strength. If this beer lacks in anything its the smell. Not that it smells bad it just doesn't have a whole lot of smell. I would literally drink Guinness all day everyday if my wallet and liver could handle it.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Stockatron,3.31,"It just depends so much on where you get this and if it is can versus tap, and if the irish water is in it or not. This rating is the best I ever had it, on tap in Sydney. I'd say it gets a bit better in Ireland, but not a lot. Probably more to do with the craic.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Red5StandingBy,3.05,"Poured from 16oz can with widget into Spiegelau Stout glass. No Date.  L: Nearly black with ruby edges, one finger of tight bubbled light khaki head (nitro) with excellent retention.  S: Some grain with a lactose like scent.  T: Lightly roasted grains.  F: Thin and watery, light body, nitro, clean finish.  O: Really expect more from the best selling Guinness brew. Their Extra Stout is far better than this.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,SpongeHop,3.13,"L - dark brown, black coffee; off-white head S & T - watery, slightly roasted barley, toasted breadiness, slightly bitter chocolate-y, but all so very slightly F - light, sessionable, good carbonation  O - I tasted other Guinness products before, such as the Special Export Stout and the West-Indies Porter, and those were vastly, vastly superior to this one. This one was just so... 'slightly' flavored. More watery than anything else. Bit of a shame, as I know that they can make mighty fine beers. A porter in the style of a macro-lager. But it's easily sessionable, I guess.  I don't recommend this one.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Lone_Freighter,3.75,"The appearance is a jet black body with a two finger off white foamy head with some speckled spider web lacing. The smell has some coffee, tobacco, and slight malts in the background. The taste is basically the same. On the palate, she sits about a medium, comes across fairly sessionable, and has a dry bitter aftertaste and finish. Overall, this isn’t a bad beer and this is the American made one. I could only wish to get back to Ireland to have the real stuff as this runs in my blood. Its so hard to knock this one, yes I would have this again.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Amateurbrewmaster,3.83,"I enjoy this beer on tap wherever I can. Despite being a craft beer nerd, this beer hits the spot sometimes. Look: from the tap, it pours a black color with ruby red tinges. The head looks like a dollop of Cool Whip and does not go anywhere. It laces the glass all the way down and does not go anywhere. Smell: Thin. Light roasted note. Bits of coffee. A touch of sweetness on the nose. Taste: Roasted barley, coffee, sweet, and minerals in the water. Feel: Creamy but also kind of thin. Overall: The thin and watery quality of this beer is probably why others rate it so low. But I don't see this as a negative. It's creamy with the roasted malts without being thick and heavy. It's very refreshing. Getting a coffee and roasty notes without being weighed down. Again, beer nerd, but I absolutely love this beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,EmeraldMist,2.05,"Look - Cola black in color with ruby highlights, two fingers of dense off white foam, good retention, minimal lacing. Aroma - Iron, grains, ashy. Taste - Like the aroma.

Overall - Garbage.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,kagramoll,5,"While not a craft beer or unique taste as many other beers, it should be the favorite for all beer drinkers. If I was stuck on an island and could only drink one beer for the rest of my life (not that I want this to happen), it would be Guinness. I would of course want it served on tap. And with a pour done as well as at the Gravity Bar at Dublin's Gate.  This is a great beer to introduce to your friends who are not diverse in their styles of beer. Most of them would be scared of the color and think it would be too heavy, not taste good, etc. If Guinness is served at the right temperature with a good poor,they may find themselves pleasantly surprised and be willing to try others!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,BlunderfulGuy,3.55,"Very dark brown body with a fair tan head and mediocre lacing. It smells a lot like, well, not much, actually. Faint roasted malts, nearly burnt wheat bread, and even fainter fruit and yeast. Tastes the same as I expected with some typical, standard, light roasted malts, toast, watered down cold-brewed coffee, a wee bit of caramel and dare I say taffy in there somewhere, and a dry, slightly bitter malty finish without much from hops. The mouthfeel is very average, if you're gonna have it you should try to get one that's on nitrogen.  I've had one Guinness at a pub off nitro, didn't think it very special and didn't expect to want it again, but I decided to toss in a bottle of Guinness Draught into a ""mix your own six pack"" and had it with breakfast this morning. It's a great breakfast beer, I must say, though for any other time it's just mediocre for me.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,ShoeIn-BrewWin,4.21,"If you give Guinness on draught anything less than an 85 then you haven't had it in Ireland.  The key to a good Guinness is a perfect pour. Nothing can beat the look of a jet-black Guinness with cream bubbles creeping up the side of the glass for a perfect, iconic head. The creaminess is accentuated in the smell and taste. The feel is silky smooth.  Go have a Guinness poured in a 12th century pub and see how it treats you.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BeerSexLove,2.87,"I revisited Guinness because I felt like I unfairly judged it for years, for it is the reason I thought I didn't like stouts, but I have learned I just don't like this stout. There wasn't a deep aroma, the flavor was bland, and the feel was average. I feel free of any lingering guilt for not loving Guinness and can say with confidence that I now trust my pallet and I really do like stouts, good ones.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,cjgiant,3.58,"Nitro draft at Irish pub: Pours cloudy as the nitrogen settles, increasing the creamy tan head. Looks like a perfect cappuccino. Body is dark but obviously lets some light through, with a slightly reddish glow where it does.  Nose is pretty much missing initially, on a cold beer. Later in the pour there's a lightly bitter roast note - but it's still very weak.  The taste is a distinct mix of unsweetened chocolate malt roast, a little bitterness that doesn't seem from any char, and a lightly smoky roasted back end. Feel is rather light, even a tad watery on a warmer beer. The restrained boldness (yes, somewhat oxymoronic) of this beer I think is what makes it fairly universally enjoyed. There's roast - but it's not acrid or charred; there's bitterness - but it doesn't consume your palate; there's chocolate - but it is not at all seeet.  Of course, I've had this numerous times. In some cases I've found it watery. In others, bland. Today I might have lucked into one of the better tastings I've had.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Delekhan,3.82,"The first beer I ever had where beer finally clicked for me. I had it on tap in a pint glass at Nana's Irish Pub in Newport, Oregon. L: A very dark brown with a nice light brown head that slowly settles. S:Roasted Malt and Chocolate T:Pretty much the same as the smell with a hint of coffee. F: It was very smooth and everything about it was just fine. O: A solid experience especially while eating shepherd's pie at a nice little Irish Pub. The flavor profile didn't blow my mind but it was a subtleness that changed my mind that beer could actually be good and shifted me away from the liquors that I had held dear. Would absolutely have it again but it was definitely a one pint and I am done especially with a hardy meal.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Thewill450,3.83,"Pours with a deep, rich color with a slight brown head that holds. Smell is a slight nuttiness with a hint of coffee and some chocolate.

209,754,NorthernLightsMN,3.98,"This is my go-to beer. To me, it's as close to a damn good craft stout as you can get. ALWAYS pour it - never drink it straight from the bottle. It pours a nice thick head with very good retention. The aroma is bittersweet chocolate and coffee, and the taste is similar with a little molasses. It goes down very easy and isn't too carbonated.

209,754,Dr_Gonzo,3.82,"Can't say this is the best beer I've had.  It looks really nice and dark, but I can't help but notice it's a very ""flat"" tasting beverage and lacks many flavors in quality. In a way, it's like tasting a sort of a weak ""tea-bagged"" kind of water that takes multiple sips to really get its experience and there isn't much else beyond that. Overall, it's all right to have as a substitute if you don't have an availability of greater beers in the fridge but it's not something I'd have everyday.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Bangalter,4.41,"Starting with the black look, pouring it is orgasmic and watching it settle is just great. With its light ABV of 4.2 the beer has a great feel and not so alcoholic taste. It is very creamy so it slides down through your throat with a woody, nutty and coffee-ish after taste. You can feel different tastes in every different sip. Definitely one of my favorites. Cheers already!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,robinnorway,4.83,"It's funny, being a guy grown up on pale lager all his life, tasting Guinness for the first time, and absolutly loving it.

The stout settles perfectly, and you get a perfect creamy tan head that lasts. S - Roasted malts and chocolates. T - Incredibly smooth, but but a little lacking in flavor (a bit watery). The roasted malts still come through though, making the beer feel nice and hearty. F - simple mouth feel but a very easy drinker. Does taste like a draught beer even though it came from a can. O - this is always a nice go-to stout, and Guinness will always be distinctive and unique.

No denying that it's beautiful; a cascading waterfall of dark brown turning into a smooth and complete black abyss with the tightest bubbled khaki foam of a head. Smell is a bit roasty, perhaps earthy, but not much going on. Flavor is the same. Bitter chocolate, roasted malt, earthy hops, and some blood like metallic flavor. Mouth feel, creamy and smooth. Could easily drink in a low lit bat all night long without thinking twice about it. Overall, it's Guinness!!! But there are others out there that I find a tad more delicious.

A: Pours with typical effervescent activity from bottom to top, clearing to black, with a persistent 1/2 inch, light khaki head, impressive retention, and rings of lacing down the side of the glass. S: Aromas light; blend into something like a black coffee/toast/almond milk/nouget note. T: Subtle and smooth blending of roasted malt flavors, akin to the nose, with bitterness excellently balanced and gently making itself tasted late. M: Full, creamy mouthfeel despite relatively low alcohol content. O: A classic. Guinness is good for you.  The draught nitro can replicates a fresh, recently tapped draught barrel (the gold standard of taste) remarkably well and as closely as technological possible and thus always appreciated for the great drinking experience that it is.

Black. Held to lamp light, brown-black. Thin head, tiny bubbles, moderate lacing.  Subtle. Malty chocolate and quite creamy-smooth. Too watery.  My first Guinness can was in the suburbs of Dublin, Ireland, in the summer on ninety one. I was totally shocked to see it outside a bottle or bar ...

Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, and toasted dark bread; with light nuttiness, smoke, dark fruit, herbal, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of roast/bready malt and light earthy hop/fruity yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, and toasted dark bread; with light nuttiness, smoke, dark fruit, herbal, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Light herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toasted dark bread, light nuttiness/smoke/herbal, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good robustness and balance of roast/bready malt and light earthy hop/fruity yeast flavors; with a nice roasted bitter/sweet balance, and zero astringent flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness from roast/bitterness, increasing through the glass. Light carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly grainy/chalky, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is okay. Very thin with no creaminess at all. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.2%. Overall this was a decent Irish dry stout. All around good robustness and balance roast/bready malt and light earthy hop/fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and easy to drink.

There is really nothing to this beer.  Feel is thin and watery with very little carbonation.  Overall this is not good.

First things first - this is a great looking beer, the famous dark ruby red undertones balancing the initial deep black/brown. Mouthfeel is creamy yet light - more watery than you'd expect?

209,754,Pantalones,3.52,"My last can from the 8-pack I picked up a while back. Canning date is a mysterious code on the bottom, including the number 188, which I can only assume means that this can is around 6 months old. Not too worried about age being an issue, though.  It looks like... well, Guinness. Take a look at the picture on the beer's profile page, it's like that except the head of foam on top may be just a tad darker tan. At a glance seems to be almost pitch-black, but a closer look shows some dark red-brown around the edges and my LED flashlight can penetrate a bit in the thinner parts of the glass (in the thicker ones I just get a circle of red dots barely visible on the other side.) The only downside of the appearance is that some big weird bubbles tend to form in the foam during the pouring, but that's probably down to me pouring from that big ol' can rather than any fault of the beer itself.  Smell is pretty faint, but what's there is pleasant -- definitely dark, roasty malt. I noticed it more while pouring, but it's very faint now that it's settled into the glass.  Taste is also mild, but not nearly as much as the smell. There's slightly-sweet roastiness that sort of gives a very faint almost-chocolate impression at times, but there's a bit more going on too, maybe an ashy/char sort of thing and something with a slightly sourish taste -- seems like a similar blend of flavors to what you get from this beer's ""big brother"" Guinness Extra Stout, but all-around milder and harder to distinguish. Considering the ABV and calorie count in this stuff though, this is essentially a ""light"" beer, and when compared to other light beers it's great stuff... even if it may fall short of a lot of the other stouts and porters out there.  I'm torn on the mouthfeel here. It seems like nitro is a weird thing in that area, especially with beers that are a lot lighter to begin with (and again, at 4.2% ABV and something like 110 calories this is very light!) It looks amazing, and the first couple of sips when the foam on top is still really thick (it never really goes away, but some of it does end up getting drank along with the liquid portion of the beer as time passes) are really nice. After that, though, things go in a direction that's a little more... watery. It never gets to a point when the mouthfeel is so thin as to be unpleasant, though, and the flavor and mouthfeel compliment each other (bigger gulps = more flavor, and it's so light that you end up taking big gulps very easily), so I kinda have to lean toward the mouthfeel being more of a positive overall.  Overall, a great-looking beer that's also decent-tasting and always reliable and easy to find just about anywhere. It's essentially a light beer for people who like dark beer, and certainly a much better choice than anything actually marketed as ""light!""",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Such an awesome flavor for a massively brewed stout. Loads of smokey charred coffee with hints of bitter chocolate. Such an initial taste. Once it settles there definitely a strong hoppy bitterness, but in a good way. I'm so blown away by how good this is. Mouthfeel is a hair thin, but very smooth and light velvety.

209,754,Libeertarian,3.59,"From notes taken 08/17/16:  On pour, what is normally opaque and nearly black appears a cola brown due to activity of fine nitrous bubbles. Soon settles to a darker brown, light seen through only near the edges. Less aggressive and smaller head when served chilled it seems. This was a 14.9 ounce can, but I couldn’t make it to the top of the 16 ounce glass, something I can usually even do with a 12 ounce bottle. One finger, thick filmy foam, biscuity brown, excellent retention. Smells like black olives, but could pass for sweet roastiness, toastiness, and even breadiness. Flavor is also less distinct when chilled, so I will let it warm a bit before continuing review. For now, suffice it to say, I detect smoky tart and almost metallic notes throughout, strongest up front, with faintest toffee and then burnt toast as it finishes. Mouthfeel comes as no surprise. Full and soupy but not quite syrupy thanks to nitro, smooth and barely tingly with extra fine carbonation. Mild astringency, was expecting more.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

My opinion is this: This is a ridiculously over-rated beer. It looks absolutely incredible, but the old saying ""don't judge a book by its cover"" could not be more true here, just in the reverse manner that is usually used. After the initial appearance, only disappointment follows with this beer. The ABV makes it a good session beer, but if I'm looking for a lower ABV sessioner, I would take most gose, a low ABV saison, or a dunkelweizen over this sorry excuse of a stout any day. Hell, I may even take a pilsner over this stuff. That being said, I'm more of an IPA guy, so that could be why I find this beer to be so dull and flavourless.

There is a one inch head with lots of lacing left in the glass. Smell: bready, malts, earth, roasty, ash. I can't say that the smell of Guinness is that appealing, but everything else outweighs the need for a fresh scent. Taste: The widget in the can gives the beer such a milky, silky texture that it is velvety smooth. Coffee, chocolate, bitter roasty middle and finish. The bitter aftertaste is there if you keep having more guinness. Feel: very light considering that most regular beer drinkers think of it as the oatbran of beers. It has the silky, milky texture because of the nitro widget. Overall: I have had this beer more than any other beer in my life. It has always been a favorite of mine and will continue to be the best of the best. You just can't go wrong with a guinness. It's the beer that you order if you don't know anything else at the bar. You can count on it unless the bar does not clean out there taps, or does not throw out extremely old beer. I love that on the can it has a list of the carbs, protein, calories and fat in the beer. I had to re-visit it and it has been a long time. Don't get it from the bottle. It is really best on a nitro tap, but the cans really are almost as good. It still has that milkyness to it.

On the other hand, Guinness puts ""serve extra cold"" on the stupid tap, so I guess you have to blame them as well. Anyway, very light coffee and roasted black malts, but not much. Flavor is similar.

Prior to Guinness, like many people, I mostly drank american Pilsner (Hey... we were all early 20 somethings at one time, LOL!!! I've since changed, gotten into crafts, and won't touch light Pilsner anymore). I didn't understand why it tasted like flat coffee until I read about how it was made and why. My next try at it and I was hooked. I grew to love this beer!!! It has one of the prettiest pours there is, in my opinion. Best off a nitro tap or from a can with the widget. It does create a creaminess. It is a dry stout, with virtually no fizz, and lots of coffee, along with chocolate and roasted malt. At least that is what I taste anyway. It is light compared to a number of the Stouts I've gotten into since acquiring my Stout love. Many call it legendary. Some say it stinks.

209,754,hoptheology,4.03,"Being the inventor and pioneer of the oxygenated ""Widget"" that creates creamy, distinct, signature pours with towering heads that linger forever, I have no choice but to give Guinness Draught's appearance a solid 5.

A deep, dark chocolate mocha colored body with 100% opacity. 5 all the way to the bank.  Dark, roast malts, deep fresh handfulls of coffee beans, freshly unwrapped dark chocolate. Slight herbal as well. There is nothing wrong with this aroma....at all.  Flavor is liberally roasted malts with dark chocolate drizzles, with a roasty coffee dryness. The coffee lingers to the finish. The flavor profile is mild, lightly bitter, exceptionally sessionable, and easy to drink. Both a sipper and a swigger, a rarity among stouts.  Because of the afformentioned sipper/swigger remarks, this one DOES get docked in the mouthfeel category, as it is insanely thin for being a ""stout"". It's not chewy, it's not thick, it is like skim milk in consistency and flows down about the same. Easily the weakest category here, but still not down for the count.  Guinness Draught does not get the ratings it deserves. It's a mass-produced beer, but it's a damn good one.

Watching the tiny bubbles rise in waves to form a luxurious white/tan head to top an opaque body is something to admire. It says ""Drink me."" And this has been a big part of Guinness' success. Smells and Tastes are those of a classic dry Irish: well-roasted malts and good dosage of hops to keep the dry dry. We can argue about Feel and the critics of this stout's thin-ness is a point well-taken. But, this is an extremely smooth beer designed for a long session in a pub.  Guinness' reasonably successful effort to put its draught in a can is an effort to bring this product to home-bodies like me. It is just another example of their marketing genius. Nitrogen may not be cool, but it is effective.  Personal note: On the way to study Ireland's largest inter-city train station in Dublin, I walked by Guinness' main facility. Never will I forget that extraordinary, intense smell. I'm just glad that did not come out of this can.  3/17/21 Had again to celebrate St. Paddy's Day. Suitable.

Unfortunately, I had changed my mind a few sips later.  Sure, the roastiness is superb. Yes, the coffee notes are delicious. And it is also the best looking beer that I have ever laid my eyes on. BUT...... Eventually, I noticed that there is a metallic wing to it at the finish. Not pleasant at all. Secondly, the beer is far too watery.

I have never been to Dublin though actually for me Australian and Nigerian Guinness are the best. Nigerian is extra strong :) They sell it in some places in London.  Taste is creamy, with coffee.

209,754,BrokenEdge,2.29,"What a disappointment this was. Guinness has a great reputation and this beer looks nice, but it totally falls apart in every other area. This came in a bottle that had written all over it ""enjoy by the bottle"" as though they don't want you to pour it in a glass, which I thought was strange. I did it anyway and it was a good looking stout, nearly pitch black with a thinner than expected white head. Smell is very faint, just a hint of dark chocolate and burnt toast. Taste is strange...starts out very sweet, and after you swallow, there's just this avalanche of burnt bacon, burnt toast, and dark coffee that hits you all at once. No subtle developing flavors here. Despite ALL the flavors at once, it somehow still comes out tasting weak though. Feel is awful, one of the worst I've had. VERY thin, watery, and strangely oily (a friend described Guinness as being like sausage grease). Almost completely lacking in carbonation. Between the initial sweet taste, the thin body, and the lack of carbonation, this is like a flat Coke that has had something go very awry in the bottling process. I may someday try it out of the bottle but I doubt it will fix all the issues I had with this beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

This stout is a very very dark cola-brown, and pours with a lovely nitro-cascade effect, leaving a dense, creamy 1-finger tan head that seems to linger for an eternity. Lacing is filmy and follows the head all the way down. This is still one of the prettiest beers in a glass out there.  Aromas are sweet malts, caramel, toast, and some faintly smoky notes.  The flavors start with a bit of sweet malts, followed by coffee and a bit of bitter chocolate. The finish is somewhat tart and dry, with just a faint trace of hops.  Body is thin and light, as per the style, though the nitro adds a touch of creaminess on the palate. Little carbonation. A very easy-drinking beer, especially with the fairly mild ABV.  Well it's definitely a classic, particularly to those of us who are just old enough to remember to just before the craft-brew explosion, back when imports ruled the world of the would-be beer connoisseur... It's not in exactly an amazing beer (its flavors aren't terribly deep or complex) but it's certainly not bad at all. The iconic Irish Dry Stout is still decent, if not spectacular.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,stlfatguy,3.98,"I'm torn, and tempted to move my ratings up based on nostalgia alone. This was my first non AB/Miller brew. It's still a great bar option when they don't have anything new to try, and I pick up a case of nitro cans every year. It fails in taste and feel compared to the "" Extra Stout"" version, but it's still Guinness through and through, and I'll take it.  Never given a 5 before, but the look is perfect. Every time I rate a stout, this is what I compare against. Jet black body with no light getting through. Light tan head that creates a great contrast. Amazing pillow of fluff and foam that sits thick from the initial pour until the last drink. This one was from a Nitro can, but it may as well have been from the tap. The widgets contained inside these cans are a true marvel of modern science. I would have thought there was a tiny, aquatic leprechaun living inside and pumping out the frothy brew... if I hadn't cut one open to check myself.  I can remember a time when I found the smell to be almost overpowering coffee, burnt malt, and chocolate. Stout virgins I share with, still have similar descriptions. Today, I have to admit I find it a little weak. Regrettably, the same exact description could be said of the taste. It never disappointed, and always gives me what I expect, but there are more flavorful and complex stouts out there. The feel is a paradox. You'll never find a more thick, creamy, lasting head. Unfortunately, the body is slightly, dare I say, watery. Newbies tell me it feels so thick they're chewing the drink...I Wish I could agree.  In the end, this is THE classic stout. It's one that can be used to measure others against. The look is unmatched. The experience is consistent and familiar. It's a great intro into the world of stouts, and a good bridge to keep on hand for poor, lost souls needing an introduction to anything beyond American macros. One more thing... despite its low ABV, this one always hits me a little more than it should. Perhaps the flood of so many memories takes an undue amount of blood flow in my brain, and creates the false buzz. Wish there was a category for intangibles... It would rate even higher.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,fscottkey,2.61,"A: [5.00] Guinness is kind of the gold standard visually. The beer forms a distinct off white head with impossibly dense bubbles.

Because it's not brewed by a couple hipsters in a trendy neighborhood? Because it is mass produced? It's delicious. It's beautiful. It's meant to taste unique. I've had better beers, but it is completely worthy of a 5/5 rating. It's a DRY Stout, emphasis on the dry. It makes you yearn for that next sip, just like a good cocktail. It is smooth and has a burnt toffee aftertaste, pours a deep black with a rich, thick, creamy head that laces the glass perfectly. It's incredibly made and gets better with more pours, A TRUE SESSION BREW before it had a name. It offers a very slight body with a sharply toasted malt smell, that of day old bread that does not overwhelm but rather compliments the taste. Very well made, it's clear why brewers and beer drinkers alike have enjoyed and respected this beer for decades. This should not be kept out of your rotation just because your grandparents have drank it, in fact, that's partially why you should drink it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,dcotom,4.04,"Revisited on 3/16/2023.  Poured from 11.2-ounce bottle into a Guinness logo tasting glass. Deep blackish-brown in color, with deep reddish-orange highlights and a dense long-lasting light tan head. Aromas and flavors of roasty malt front and center, with hints of molasses, licorice, tart apple, and oaky sourness, with lots of bitterness and a little astringency on the finish. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side, with good carbonation throughout. The roastiness lingers on the palate long after the beer is gone, which is quite pleasant to experience. Overall, excellent beer and one of the classics.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Troy-Hawaii,3.4,"Dark brown almost black color, toasty malt flavor, creamy texture, uniquely Guinness. There may be other stouts that are better, but Guinness defined the market.

209,754,PhillyRiver,1.51,"My husband thinks I should use the word ""abomination"" in my review. Poured from can into clean tulip glass. Why do people like this beer? This is the fourth time I've tried to drink it, three times from cans, once on tap in a New England bar. Every time, I experienced it as a thin flat swill with a cardboard foretaste, nothing like the rich coffee-chocolate porters I prefer (Fuller's, Young's, Yuengling, Breckinridge, Anchor, etc.). The first can of Guinness Draught I got from the Foodery in Philly, I took it back and told them it was flat, that the fizzer must be malfunctioning. She kindly gave me a new one. Got home, it was exactly the same, I couldn't finish it and poured it down the drain. Tried a can from another store in case it was their shipment; nope, same result. It has a creamy two-tone parfait head that sticks to the glass forever, so I gave it a 3 for Look. After that, there's no pleasure, a waste of calories. OK, now I'm dumping the rest and opening a Yuengling Porter.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,mynamewastakendamnit,2.9,"From the can:  L: Beautiful. The cascade from the nitro is a wonderful thing to watch, and seeing it turn from brown to nearly pitch black is pretty damn exciting. A really nice tan head with great retention/lacing.  S: Not a lot of smell. What's there is chocolately, roasted barely. Maybe a small bit of toffee but there's not much to smell here. I've had way too many off cans that smell like copper as well though.  T: Okay. Definitely drinkable. A very dark chocolate toffee like taste, some coffee, maybe a little too burnt tasting though. Not too bad but burnt =/= dark and complex. Also, again, I've had way too many cans that taste like pennies towards the end. I'd call it inconsistent but it's consistently off about half the time.  F: Light but the nitro makes it kind of creamy. Some carbonation, but thankfully not as much as the bottled version, which basically tastes like burnt seltzer.  O: Not bad when you get a good can but the fact that it's really metallic half the time for me makes it something I'm not gonna go out and buy any time soon.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,angrybabboon,3.81,"Review based on notes taken 9/19/15 Note 1: This is my 1000th full beer review. I saved Guinness Draught for #1000 because it has a strong significance in my personal beer history. It was one of the first beers I ever tried, and it was the first beer I had on my 21st birthday. This beer has popped up at various points in my life, and I will mention those in the course of this review, prefaced with asterisks***. Note 2: On-tap, nitro (of course)  A: Seemingly jet black from a distance, but it is really more of a dark, deep brown upon inspection - comes off the nitro with a medium-large, dense, solid, light tan head, with the characteristic cascade - small bubbles occasionally break the soft surface of the head that can only really exist thanks to nitrogen - the head does slowly fade to a small, but solid cap, but that does stick around indefinitely - leaves a wall of lacing - if nothing else, Guinness Draught on nitro is pretty to look at ***In middle school, I heard from a friend that bubbles in Guinness sink to the bottom of the glass instead of float to the top, and that this phenomenon could not be explained by science. I never bothered to look this up, as dial-up internet was too slow for anything.  S: Markedly unexciting, but charming for what it is - a straight-up whiff of nitro carbonation, which should not actually be an aroma, but I smell it every time I have anything on nitro - more stout-like aromas underneath the haze of gas, but it is very mild - dry, roasty malts - chocolate malts and roasted grains - a general graininess - dark chocolate and some hints of Tootsie rolls - lightly burnt, perhaps a touch smoky - light sweetness, with some light caramel ***In high school, I heard from a friend about how brewers at Guinness, many years ago, were cleaning out the tanks and found a dead rat. They cleaned the tank thoroughly, but then they could not get the next few batches to taste right. So since then, a rat is included in each batch for a consistent flavor. I never believed this one... I also have never detected rodent in Guinness Draught.  T: A decade ago, I thought this was rather complex, but now I realize that it is a rather simple brew - mild chocolate malts and roasted malts - lightly roasted grains, hint of medium to dark roast coffee - dark chocolate, baker's chocolate, semisweet chocolate, hints of Tootsie rolls - light touches of caramel - lightly grainy, with some straight-up un-malted barley - light astringency and touch of acidity - some minerality - very light hint of English hops with a touch of grass - low to medium bitterness - clean finish, extremely dry as the style should be ***In college, I learned in a class (a food science course about beer) that Guinness Draught should be slightly sour. A lot of homebrew clone recipes include some souring technique or acidulated malt. Personally, I have never really noticed it other than a light acidity.  M: Light but very creamy - the bizarre result of nitro, which leads many novice drinkers to describe this as anything heavier than ""light"" - high carbonation, finishes clean ***In grad school, I drank a lot of beer. (I don't have a Guinness-related anecdote.)  O: Always a lovely day for a Guinness  Guinness Draught is the quinntessential example of an Irish Dry Stout. It's not exciting, but it really isn't supposed to be. I have definitely had more complex and objectively superior examples of the style, but this is really the template. Definitely mild, but classic nonetheless.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,markjanderson86,2.64,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass in spite of the bottle's directive to drink ""straight from the bottle"".  Appearance - Almost black with thick tan foam. Very iconic look.  Aroma - Barely anything at all.  Taste - Light coffee and malt. Some chocolate in there too. It is pleasant. A little taste of aluminum for some reason. Not a bad taste, but nothing crazy strong in here.  Mouthfeel - Very light and creamy.  Overall - I could drink a few of them in a session.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,VABA,4.5,I had a pint at a bar in Ireland. This is an exceptional beer for any occasion. I love it especially when it is extra cold. It is very tasty and very smooth. Excellent! Highly recommended! A good beer from a brewery that consistently produces a great stout.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,squirrelmaster77,4.04,"First review here, I figured I would review my current favorite.  I purchased a 4 pack of tall cans at a local grocery store. To my dismay, they were located inside of the cooler. I brought the cans home and left them sitting out on the counter to get them to room temp.  On first inspection, the cans love to shoot foam all over the place so I recommend opening over the sink. I poured into a standard 16 oz. pint glass using a pouring method made specifically for Guinness cans with the nitrogen widget. Essentially you flip the can upside down and set it in the glass until the liquid reaches the can and you can finishing pouring from there.  A-The creamy almost coffee colored head and dark chocolatey body are perfect. It is my ideal picture for the perfect beer. 5  A-Fairly neutral. The smell of alcohol is present, unlike in the taste. There is a roasted, smokey note there as well. 3.5  T- Everything I am looking for in a stout. The hints of chocolate and coffee followed with a charred finish. Since the head is present throughout the whole drink, it's creaminess really sets up the bold flavor of this beer. 4.25  F- Very smooth. I can see no problem drinking 6, 7, or 20 of these! I prefer light carbonation in my beers due to stomach issues but it also brings out flavors that may be hidden from it. 3.5  O-I had a bad first impression of Guinness Draught by having the bottled version. Now that I have had it out of the can, I'm ready for Ireland so I can have the real thing. 4.25",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,GeorgiaFunkadelic,2.91,"Was given 3 11.2oz glasses. Thankful because it had been a while since I took the opportunity to enjoy. This is not a bad beer.

209,754,Tom_Banjo,2.9,"Fun to watch being poured and has a nice, creamy head. Not much positive to it beyond that, in my opinion. Thin and bland.

Sure, it's popular, but ""popular"" isn't the same as ""good"". Would look elsewhere in the Irish Dry Stout category.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,hopphead31415,3.95,"This is such a common beer that I have tried many times at the local Irish Pub and you really can’t go wrong with this one. It has so much to offer that I’ll describe below, but you should know that it has a rather low alcohol content (as it should for this style) at 4.2% ABV.  Look-Pours a jet black and rather iconic look in its characteristic pub glass. There are dim glimmers of reddish copper in the right back light. The head blossoms from the infused Nitrogen that is sustained for a long time. The head has the most silky smooth texture and appearance that reminds me of the upper inner thigh of a lovely babe.  Smell-It has a weak smell that is very pleasant, but not multifaceted. I get sweet oak, and smoky caramel.  Taste-The taste is great, but starts off loose with a delayed release of the flavors. I get a bitter coffee flavor that comes in most noticeable on the middle palate and as the flavors slowly emerge, I get toasty and smoky oak flavors that are rounded off by hints of coffee, caramel, toffee and then a mild spiciness to it.  Mouthfeel-It starts watery and moist with the most silky smooth texture (remember that upper thigh), and has the perfect amount of fizz from the carbonation. The bubbles are so tiny that it is more of an ambient and intrinsic carbonation instead of an apparent cola fizz. It finishes slightly dry and with a mild sweet smoky coating on the tongue.  Overall-This is such a refreshing beer and I can easily drink several of them without getting very drunk, because they are so drinkable and with such a low alcohol content. Cheers!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,CurtisGarrett,3.32,"440ml Poured into a pint glass.  Look) Guinness has an Iconic appearance and it's clear to see why, the pint is a glorious black drink with hints of ruby when the light hits the bottom of the glass. This is all topped with a cream coloured head, which thanks to the nitrogen sustains throughout your experience.  Smell) This is where I feel the drink is lacking, there is definitely a subtle dark malt aroma, but you will have to agitate it to pick up on this, however with that being said, there is nothing unpleasant about the aroma, just a lack of it.  Taste) When the beer is cold, the flavour again is very sutble at first, but the bitterness sits nicely at the back of the mouth, However as the beer warms slightly, the flavours seep begin to grow ever so slightly, the sweetness in the foretaste is very apparent and then the coffee notes set in and balance brilliantly.  Feel) This is the strongest aspect I feel. The beer is velvety (some may say watery but I feel otherwise) and sits nicely in your mouth with very little carbonation to deter you from admiring the flavour.  Overall) I do enjoy a guiness as a whole, would I pick it over some of the locals like ""Bad King John"" most likely not. I would recommend this to anybody who is just trying stout and doesn't want to jump into the deep end of complex flavoured stouts. Enjoy",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,Fair_Winds,4.71,"It is easy to be biased when reviewing a beer like Guinness. Particularly for me being Irish-American. But one thing about this beer is certain. It lives up to all expectations. It is a mass produced beer that is a new and exciting adventure every time I drink it. It's color although many think is pitch black is actually a deep deep red. However this color and it's contrast to its trademark creamy white head, poured into an imperial tulip is a symbol known the world over. Perhaps the only beer in the world that can be identified simply by color and glassware. It uses its own signature gas mixture when poured from the tap to keep its light and distinct carbonation level. It's aroma breathes of the dark malts used in making irish stouts. And lastly it's taste. No matter where you go your Guinness may be slightly different depending on temperature, age, which brewery it's from but it always has a dark coffee flavor to it. Few beers have such a beautiful presentation (when done correctly) and even fewer have such a long distinguished history.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The reason I give it a 4 is because of the slight woody barley aroma. Many beer don't any good smell but alcohol. Taste) It hit your tongue with the shock that all sparkling alcoholic beverage has but soon turn into a sort of sweetness, and then bitterness. Again you have to respect this drink in order to enjoy the ""respect"" in this drink. Feel: a very drinkable beer, goes well with a nice meal. It NOT a party drink.

209,754,K1ngdomCome,4.28,"Great tasting dark beer. Excellent when poured correctly. Beautiful swirl as it settles in the glass. Rich velvet bittersweet taste throughout.

A refreshingly smooth and creamy taste with strong coffee notes that finishes dry and metallic as one might expect with many stouts, though maybe a little too metallic for some. It's my go to beer in most cases and works great in an Irish Car Bomb (cocktail).",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,PhantomsSpa,3.35,I'm fairly early on in my beer drinking career so this is the first stout I've ever had. I've gotta say it really impressed me and found it to be a great beer but I feel like I'm missing something. The almighty Guinness is supposed to be a Titan of beer and I mostly thought It was middle of the road. I liked it a lot but I don't see what all the hype is about.

This is the first Guinness I've had in at least 5 years (the last time I tried it to see if I liked beer any better at the time and no I didn't) and I remember it being a lot more bitter. Instead it's extremely easy to drink and the bitterness barely shows up as a faint aftertaste. Granted this was from a bottle poured into a glass (but so was the last time I tried it) and I am currently drinking it right after I just finished a Köstritzer Schwarzbier, but I still expect more from a beer known as an Irish Dry Stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The aroma of sweet malt, roasted coffee and lastly the bitterness is perfect. The taste is a blend of tart and bitter with a smokey flavor (I like burnt-smokey alcoholic drinks).

It looked fabulous as always. The billowy silky smooth dark tan foam retained all the way down to the bottom of the glass. The beer is black and refuses any light to pass through. It smells carbonic and minerally, which sadly covered up any beer aroma for me. Nitro beers... It tasted better than I remember. The silky creaminess balanced nicely with the slightly bitter charred wood of the brew with espresso undertones. The deep burnt roast lingers long and very mildly sweet. I liked the rich creaminess. The lively epravescance keeps the creaminess at bay and keeps it from feeling like a milkshake. This beer was far better than I remember; I've sampled hundreds of other beers since the last. It's a good solid beer maybe 60-75 percentile. It's a good option at those crummy 5 beer restaurants that only serve this, a macro beer, macro beer light, a heffe, and a bad pale.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,JohnnyI,3.59,"Well it's St Patrick's Day, and I would have preferred an Extra Stout, or Foreign Extra, but a can of Guinness Draught will do. It opens with a pop and a strange squeal from the hidden nitro widget. It resembles coffee with cream as it pours in to the trademark Guinness Perfect Pint glass. There's a beautiful cascade effect as the darker suds fight their way to the bottom. What's left when it's all said and done is a picture perfect pint. Deep, dark brown, nearly black, with ruby highlights where the light hits the base of the glass just right. The head is a solid inch of custard like foam, so densely packed that only a close examination reveals the miniscule bubbles. Dip your finger in to it and the impression remains, like icing on a cake. Guinness draught definitely has the look down. Perhaps one of the most appealing appearances of any beer out there. The aroma brings faint chocolate malts, black coffee and a little sourness on the nose. A hint of the roasted bitterness that is sure to come out in the flavor. Mild, yet characteristic of a dry Irish stout. The taste brings a bit of tartness, married with a nice bittering ash that creates a smoky, mild flavor. Lingering roast dominates the finish. Fairly simple, yet nuanced. Certainly on the thin, easy side of the spectrum. The mouthfeel is creamy and rich in the beginning, and then thin and watery as the nitro loses steam. Personally, I think it loses something in the draught flow cans. It's a novel concept that brings it to your fridge, but no substitute for the real draught Guinness on tap. That said, it's still a great example of the style. Simple, uncomplicated, accessible. A great beer to broaden your horizons with.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Nothing to write home about... but nothing to really complain about either.  But I think that is admirable as it makes it a ""go to"" when there is nothing else to choose from besides a Light beer or something.

209,754,mwilton,4.19,Guinness is the beer that breaks you in to a stout. It's also the go to beer when the bar has not much to offer. My only complaint is that it's on the weak side @ 4.2% but it remains a classic.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The retention is pretty good and the head is creamy and dense. The beer is mostly black and opaque. No carbonation visible.  S-The aroma has a distinctive, almost lactic sugar note. There is a bit of dark fruit sweetness, some light roast flavor, but it is mostly watery and slightly astringent. Wet cardboard comes to mind.  T-The taste tracks the smell closely. I get a slightly metallic flavor, some vague watery bitterness, a bit of metallic malted grain, and a drying finish.  M-The carbonation is ultra creamy but the beer is lighter in heft with a watery aspect to it.  O-I am not one to rag on the other Guinness varieties, e.g., the Extra is pretty decent, but this version is a letdown.

209,754,yonker,3.58,"Smell: Definitely agreed with previous comments on a slightly ""milky smell."" Heavy, earthy grains with faint, dark notes of chocolate and caramel and coffee. I would describe it as slightly musky. I had to hold it to my nose a few times to pick up everything in my nasal passages--I would describe the smell, in a nutshell, as ""heavy, but muted.:  Look: Please pour this beer correctly; this is clearly a beer meant for you to ""drink with your eyes"": Hold at a 45 degree angle, pour along the backside of the glass to about 3/4 full. Let stand for a moment, then pour gently until you have a dome of foam, shone in the picture, at the top of your glass. The presentation is absolutely gorgeous. I say, one more time, the presentation is absolutely gorgeous: drink this beer with your eyes! The cascading foam is an incredible sight to behold.  Taste: Sweet, on the tip of the tongue. Initial notes of chocolate, and a very very slight note of caramel. As the beer passes a little further, to the middle of your mouth, the coffee bitterness hits the sides of your tongue. I would argue that a light coffee bitterness follows this beer all the way down into your gullet. At the back of the tongue, there is a slight, heavy grain taste that washes it the rest of the way down. I love the way the initial sweetness of this beer gets chased down with the bitters. I have definitely had better dark beers than this, but it is a Guiness, which may as well be a proprietary eponym for ""CLASSIC BEER.""  Mouthfeel: Very little carbonation. Thick and heavy. On one hand, I find myself wishing it had a little more carbonation, but on the other, it's something different, and I get it. The mouthfeel pairs well with the taste of this beer. Anything different would be weird...it wouldn't be a Guinness!  Overall: It's a classic. If i'm not drinking some new, crazy, hoppy craft beer, I kind of enjoy having the Guinness to fall back on! It's one of the few mass-produced beers that I feel no guilt in drinking. Great beer!! 3.75 overall",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,SmashPants,3.48,"Format: enjoying a pint of Guinness at the club, and realised that I haven't yet done a review of it. Gasp!  Appearance: poured out jet black with a rising cream of tan head that sits around a finger and lasts for the entire session.  Aroma: not really much on the nose - just a touch of roast coffee and some malts.  Taste: definite roast coffee and chocolate again here - fairly one-dimensional, but when it sits this well it doesn't really matter. One of the best traditional macro dry stouts.  Aftertaste: a lingering bitterness from the malts, with a touch of that coffee. Perhaps a bit too coffee for me (not a fan) but that doesn't mean it isn't well made.  Mouth feel: medium in body with lower to moderate carbonation. Very creamy and smooth.  Overall: I do like Guinness, but it is a little too coffee for my taste.

209,754,mfnmbvp,2.86,"11.2 fl oz. bottle, with no apparent bottled on date present. My second encounter with a variant of Guinness. ""Pasteurized stout"", ""Brewed in Dublin"". The bottle makes it a point that I am supposed to drink this ""straight from the bottle"" but I think I'll pass on that.  Poured into a Guinness St. James's Gate Dublin mug.  A - It pours a dark chocolatey brown body with some hues of ruby red showing through when held to the light. A semi-aggressive pour conjures around two to three fingers of thick frothy khaki head that stays for a while. Fat fluffy lacing. Appears a bit on the thin side, but it looks nice for what it is.  S - The aroma is boring and muted by comparison to the greater stouts I've had. Some musty malt, dusty chocolate, indistinct dark fruits, and a mineral water type smell. Perhaps a slight hint of yeast in there?  T - Taste is a step up from the nose, but still boring and tame by comparison to the greater stouts of the world. Watery dark malt, and faint notes of chocolate & roast. A sort of dry cardboard texture on the end also; not what I consider to be an enjoyable stout at all.  M - The feel is thin and watery with a very light bittering dryness on the finish. Very easy-drinking, given the style, but it's definitely not something I would want a lot of.  Overall, I can appreciate it's place in beer history, but it just doesn't do the style justice for me after being spoiled by countless other stouts with more complexity and flavor than this. Recommended for beginners, and for those looking to get away from cheap macro lager swill. I won't be having this again.  Guinness Draught -----3/5.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Generally sweet, but still balanced.  Feel: Somewhere between creamy and watery, but almost seems too watery.  Overall: Guiness is of course a classic, and was my first non BMC beer, like it is for many Americans.

For symmetry more than anything else. You know the beer. For God Sake its Guinness! Also this is apparently international stout day and this is the stout that began it all for me.  Appearance: Beautiful creamy black, not total darkness, but close. Nice frothy head, like a beer milkshake.  Aroma: Not much, its sweet roast and malts.  Taste: Creamy roasted malts, it really tastes like a lot out there and honestly more watery than some other craft breweries are doing with the style, especially nitro beers. But this truly is a classic. It gets points for that and was the best beer I had ever drank the first time I had tried it after years of drinking macro lager swill.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,GeneralCuster,5,"Absolutely delicious. I thoroughly enjoy the creamy head, and the general smoothness of the beer. Tastes as good out of a widget can as it does off of draught.

209,754,cuy50,2.15,"No aroma, no flavor, no structure or body. Quite literally tastes and feels like beer that has had water added to it. The nitro carbonation is so awful it may as well be a flat beer. I guess it's good for pounding them back easily? I dunno, don't see the appeal of this product.

Taste/Body: The nitro causes the foam to coat your mouth, but it is more watery than most stouts. Light chocolate and roastiness are most prominent. Coffee and caramel are there, but very mild. A very drinkable beer. Overall: It is a good beer if you like stout, but want something that is not too heavy (AKA you want to drink multiple). It is also good because it is the only stout that normally remains on tap, at least in Canada.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,soneill065,3.75,"A great tasting stout, but saying that there are plenty of other stouts that can surpass it in both flavour and texture.

209,754,BeerDrinkersWorldTour,3.25,"Appearance – Rich dark colour with nitrogenated head normally about 1 finger (when it is well poured) The settling process is like watching a storm in a glass which is one of this beers main selling points in the UK and Ireland. Head retention is second to none as there always seems to be almost the same head in the bottom of the glass as at the start.  Smell – Essentially little to no hop aroma at all but there is the faintest hint of hawthorn wood and macchiato.  Taste – It is rather mild with little alcohol to note making it a good intro to the Stout world but if you want deeper flavours then try something else. It has a very pleasant bitterness to it, which some may not like. Oddly enough this beer is made for gulping not sipping and the flavour is best if you follow this advice. The taste matches the smell almost to a Tee.  Mouthfeel – Full in the mouth owing to its excellent head but with a very dry finish.  Overall - Not mush to compare it to this beer has a taste all of its own. That does not make it the king of Stouts that its branding would have you believe it is but for what it is meant to be this is a decent enough brew. This beer is more than drinkable and is a longstanding favourite here in Ireland its relatively low alcohol content makes it a very sociable drink and not too heavy on the gut like some.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,CenturyKD,3.75,"While there are ""guidelines"" on how to pour the perfect Guinness, it's hard to find an air-tight consensus amongst friends and pubs alike, making every glass a somewhat unique experience. If you've never tried it before, ask for a pint of Guinness next time you're at the local. The ritual of pouring the perfect pint will either frustrate or fascinate you, and if you make it through those grueling couple of minutes, you're in for a good ride. If all goes to plan, you'll have a little more than 2 centimeters of head to break through before the (VERY dark) ruby liquid reaches your lips, and when it does, don't hesitate to take a big mouthful. That first gulp can be overwhelming at first, but the journey gets smoother as it goes. You'll notice the burning sensation in your nostrils first, followed by the lingering taste of roasted malt on the tongue for the next couple of minutes. Carbonation tapers off greatly as you drink leaving the last couple of mouthfuls tasting quite flat, though as tasty as the first. In conclusion, this is a beer that you will either love or hate, but I recommend you finish the entire glass before you jump to any sudden conclusions. It works hard for your approval, so it's only fair that you take the time to listen.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,Olek4374,3.55,"Surprisingly, I've been of legal drinking age for about 4 years now, and this Saturday was the first time I've ever had Guinness draught. I did it right though, and had it on tap from a nearby British themed pub (no good Irish ones in my part of the city).  What is there to say that hasn't been said already? It's a clean drinking beer, with a bit of a modest taste for a stout, but is a pleasant drink nonetheless. The first sip was nice and creamy, and it got a bit more ""liquid"" as I progressed through the pint. Liquid is certainly not synonymous with ""watery"", as the beer was nice and tasty throughout, even as it got a bit warmer. Unfortunately, one of my friends spilled his pint of beer due to his drunken stupor, and a lot of my friends ran out because we didn't want to face the wrath of the angry bar manager. I had to quickly chug about half of my pint before I too made my escape (it's okay, we all paid out bills).  Pretty good stuff. Nothing spectacular, but it's a fine beverage to be sure.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,Borbly,4.12,"Poured from 440mL nitro can into pint glass. Using the brewery's own method for pouring (via YouTube) the beer quickly formed an off-white head, similar to that of frothed milk on a café au lait. Body appeared dark brown/black with ruby colouring when brought up to a light source. The head then remained very sturdy throughout drinking.  Scent was delightful, with a strong presence of roasted barley creating tones reminiscent of coffee or dark chocolate. Taste proceed with a slightly sweet note on the front of the palate, smokiness at the sides, and that same coffee-like bitterness at the back. The beer then left a fresh, light aftertaste. The mouthfeel was very smooth and soft, with delicate notes of nitrogenation throughout.  Overall a great standard stout.

209,754,anthony23cippy,3.4,"While not the best stout, and certainly not the worst stout, one can't go wrong with a Guinness. You know what you are paying for and you know despite it's mediocrity compared to other more complex stouts, it is after all a Guinness and a classic. More of a starter stout for newbies opening up to the world of stouts, it pours a opaque dark brown almost black color, has an impressive 1.5 inch foamy creamy khaki head that dissipates very slowly (thanks to the nitro tap), most places put the clover in the head as well. Once dissipated it leaves minor lacing on the glass. The aroma is of roast, subtle coffee overtones, and a slightly acidic zing to the nostrils. It tastes rather dull, mostly the same as the aromas previously mentioned. The mouthfeel is thin and watery though balanced with the thick head, a lot lighter body than what you would suspect after first looking at a Guinness.

A pint of Guinness looks great, smells uninteresting,, has a one dimensional burnt flavour devoid of hops and an overdeveloped nitro-head that doesn't seem to do anything other than maintain the good appearance until the point is finished.

I think it's a gorgeous beer when it is first served, and the smell and taste is just superb in my opinion.

Weak flavors thin body. Watery and thin although soft and creamy. Weak coffee, roast that had potential but fizzled in it's lackluster approach to the palate. There's not really much alcohol in this one so it' wasn't planning on being strong. And it's not. Earthy, hints of char light smooth and finishes slightly with a faint bitterness from roast .

It's very low in alcohol compared to most of the American ABV bombs out there. It is very smooth. Not tons of flavor. Creamy.

209,754,albertv1955,4.35,"I drank Guinness Draught primarily as an exchange student in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The Irish told me to remember, it was stout, not beer. Though I get the nitro-cans throughout the year, I am one who really thinks it tastes better in Ireland.  The Blonde in the Black Skirt: That deep ruby-black body and cream/buff head is a beautiful sight, especially with nitrous bubbles cascading on the sides the glass.  Aromas include that heavy, roasted barley they use. It's such a signature smell.  Guinness is its own flavor, seriously barley and seriously malt. The bitter flavor is sweeter, I feel, on the Emerald Isle.  Guinness goes down super-smooth to me. Another thing the Irish said was not to sip it, but to let it flow. One Guinness always tastes like I need another.  I use the newer, stream-lined, Guinness pint glass - an imperial pint, closer to 20 oz.. The nitro-cans are 14.9 oz or so, so the glass looks half-full compared to what they pour in a pub or bar! I don't know how they make those glasses, as in laser etching or what-not, but along with the classic pint glass, it's the perfect vessel.  I highly recommend the Guinness Brewery tour in Dublin.  It's true what they say, Guinness is a reflection of Ireland and vice versa.

209,754,Cheer4Beer,3.86,"Served on draft at 43 degrees F (6 degrees C), using 35PSI of beer gas mix (75% nitrogen, 25% CO2), through stout faucet with restrictor plate.  Appearance (4.5/5): Initial pour generates a very active cascade of bubbles which fall downward along perimeter of the glass. As the cascade of bubbles completes, a very dense head of small nitro bubbles form a long lasting cream colored head. Body extremely dark, with no light transmittance through the glass.  Smell (3.5/5): Sweet malt and roasted aromas dominate. Pleasant, but not overwhelming.  Taste (4/5): Initial taste is bitterness on tip of tongue. Bitterness subsides as beer moves to back of mouth, where a strong but balanced roasted flavor prevails. Earthy aftertaste yields to delicate bitter flavor.  Mouthfeel (3.5/5): Guiness’ use of beergas makes for a unique experience for both head and mouthfeel. On first sip, the upper lip pushes through the dense cream head to discover a velvety mouthfeel. Carbonation levels are low, making this a very session able brew.  Overall (3.9/5): Captivating cascade of bubbles, delicious flavor, luscious mouthfeel.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,leantom,2.59,"Had it on-tap at the local biker bar (not kidding). Used to like it as a kid, now let's see how I feel about it. Here goes:  A: Best thing about the beer. If poured properly, it produces a creamy, three-layered head that lingers LONG after the server has poured it. In fact, the top-most layer of head lingers throughout the beer's consumption. The beer is opaque-black in color; no light gets through this beer.  S: No hops. Momentary, faint hint of chocolate and toffee. Overall, I really couldn't smell much of anything in the beer. No complexity, some darkly-kilned malt - otherwise nada.  T: Bad. Despite the creamy head, there's no lactose flavor in the beer itself. Can taste some dark sugars from the heavily-kilned malt backbone. Otherwise, this beer doesn't have much going for it. Definitely not worth multiple drinkings.  M: OK. Creamy head that lingers through the beer's consumption gives the beer a somewhat thick mouthfeel. However, the beer itself is rather light and unremarkable.  O: Not very good. I suppose if you're at an out-of-town bar and there's nothing better to drink, drink this. If there's Yuengling, however, I strongly urge you to go for the Yuengling.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,tarik-the-magnificent,2.65,"I came into this beer with relatively high hopes. Being a stout fan at a beach in summer, the Guinness was the closest thing I could get to what I'd prefer. My last and only previous experience with Guinness was with the foreign extra, which I found rather impressive. I knew that the conventional draught would be a noticeable step down from the depth and character of the foreign extra, but the difference is nothing short of dramatic.  Put simply, I have no idea how they manage to make such a dark and opaque beer that is so light in character. It has the slightest hints of what a stout might taste like, but quickly re-assumes its character as dark and mildly carbonated water. I had a few other homebrewers with me, and we had to go to some lengths of imagination to come up with a way to do it.  The one thing that I will say about it, is that the beer does look pretty. But I've always thought of appearance as a slightly silly basis for review. The hints of coffee and chocolate, the hints of hints of maltiness that emerge at first are welcome and promising. But the body of the beer fails to bring any of these characteristics through. The creamy mouthfeel is but a small consolation as I wonder where the 'stoutiness' went. Sad to say, if Guinness is a stout, its one with training wheels.  Additionally, can and packaging came without ABV numbers or freshness dates, which is rather inexcusable in my eyes.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,DirtyMikeandTheBoys,4.29,"First off, I'm used To drinking cheap, tasteless light beer like bud light, miller, and coors. I'd been told that I need to try a real beer so one day on the way to my local fishing spot I got a 4 pack of 15oz cans.  A- Very dark and a nice white head. Don't last long but the beer appeared to be ok. I was impressed  S- Now I'm used to nasty tasteless beers with the aroma of metal. This stuff smells good. Very malty.  T- I liked it so much I quit drinking that tasteless junk. Goes down smooth with a slight malty taste, small bitterness at the end but not bad at all. Was good on the lake but only when it was ice cold. Don't drink it hot.  Mouthfeel was good. Def one of my favorites now, it's a bit pricey and not for everyone",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Freeker,1.87,"This beer looks good until you taste it. The darkness leads to disappointment when you realize your drinking black water. If i could class guinness id say it rates flavorwise with a cheap light beer. Guiness is disappointing on all levels. I have a hard time with all the peeps who swear by it. This is the beer for people who want to look bad ass, but still drink a pussy beer. :)",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,clemsonalum13,3.39,"Poured an almost non-existent head. Beer is a dark, seemingly opaque brown. Has a malty smell. Slightly watered down malty, chocolate taste. Some lacing occurs. Has a slightly bitter aftertaste. Ultimately, this was a good beer. Didn't like it in college but it has grown on me through time. This will definitely not be the last time I buy Guinness. Almost makes me want shepherd's pie.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Casey_Butt,1.74,"Other than Murphy's, this is probably the worst stout on Earth. Thin, watery, bitter, flat and slightly 'off' tasting. Looks okay, doesn't smell too bad or have a terrible mouth feel (like water), but it's so thin and dry there's no desire to finish the bottle. Won't poison you, but I'd need to be awfully thirsty before I'd bother drinking it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Batsu,2.93,"From a ""wuss beer drinker"" perspective  First of all, let me qualify by saying that I generally do not like stout beers. I am usually a pale ale and liquor drinker. However, when you traditionally think of a beer, you think of what you come to expect from a Guinness, a deep color and a huge head. So, of course I had to try it.  First off, the beer just looks damn impressive. It's like the visual superhero of beers. It just looks bigger, tougher and stronger than the other beers around it.  As soon as I picked up the glass, I could smell the hops almost punching me in the nose. For me, that is not a good sign, as I am not a big hops person.  The taste was ok for a stout, buy was very strong on hops, and was almost bitter. I want to enjoy my drink, not suffer through it. By the end of the 20 oz I could mostly just taste bitterness and earth.  And holy crap, this beer is filling. This was the first beer that it felt like I could almost chew it. It was like drinking liquid bread. I was full after the 20 oz glass.  It must be a really good beer if I thought it was okay, because this type of beer in general is not in my wheelhouse. I would not recommend this as something to sip on during a hot summer afternoon, as you would quickly feel full and bloated.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BeersIsTheName,3.63,"Poured from a nitro can into a pint glass  A- Dark with an ultra creamy head approximately 2 fingers in height.  S- Chocolate and malty. Crisp and pleasant.  T- I am unimpressed. The taste does not reflect the smell. Soft and watered down is the only way that I can explain. Definitely a leap from the extra stout that I am used to. A leap from almost every stout for that matter.  M- Lack of carbonation is evident. Very watered down.  O- I would be lying if I said that I was not disappointed. Guinness carries the reputation of being a beer that you drink with a spoon, however, this was far from that. Maybe the Guinness of the past, but not now. Stick to the extra stout for a real beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Svyturys30,2.05,"I have had Guinness several times from different places to try and give it a fair shot. This is a beer that I wouldn't drink if I had other options. I'm not a fan, but again, it just me.  A- The beer is a dark brownish-black when its poured. Has a frothy head to it and the head lingers for quite a while. Looks very attractive.  S- It smells of caramel and coffee. This smell is very misleading. When I first smelled it, I thought that I was going to love this beer.  T- I can only compare this beer to one other thing that I have tasted- Low Sodium Soy Sauce.  M- The feeling it leaves on your palate is thick. I would describe this as a ""crunchy"" beer. Its so thick, you almost have to chew it (but not literally).

Bottle chilled down to 36 degrees F in my beer cooler and poured into a classic Guiness pint glass.  Pours a very dark brown, almost bitch black in color with ruby high lights with about a 1-finger beige creamy head. Lots of sticky lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of roasted malts/barley with a hint of coffee. The taste is about the same and is smooth and creamy. Perfect carbonation and goes down easy. No bitter or harsh aftertaste. Much better than the regular Guiness in my opinion.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Dajaydee,5,"In my opinion Guinness Draught is the most perfect beer out there. The hints of caramel and smooth taste and finish make this one of my all-time favorites. The fact that the nitro can Guinness tastes exactly the same as the Guinness you can get on tap, is a huge plus. There are not too many beers in which you can say that about. I am partial in rating this as Guinness is my favorite. I'm sure there are other beers out there, but Guinness is easy to find and always found in my fridge!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,lochef81,3.44,"Many years ago this was my first experience with dark beer. I believed it to be then...not so much now. This stout pours a deep mahogany color with a thick off white head and lacing. The nose is an unnecessarily sweet blend of coffee and; unfortunately, adjunct malts. The mouth is very smooth and very creamy. We all know the guinness mouthfeel and wish so many other beers could achieve it. The flavor is overly sweet and seems like mass produced beer. Yet it still has all the rich flavors of roasted coffee, vanilla, and dark chocolate. For a mass produced stout it is well crafted but lacks the finesse and refinement of other craft stouts.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,57md,3.61,"So, I am sitting at a bar drinking what must be close to my 1,000th Guinness and decided that this would be the day I finally write down some tasting notes.  The Guinness nitro pour is infamous – my bartender did not put the fancy shamrock into the foam, but he managed a basic pour quite dexterously.  Dark brown in color with well over a finger of head once it finally settled. The head lingered for some time and left thick creamy rings of lace behind on the glass. The nose and flavor are both lightly roasty. The body is smooth and creamy.  This is a good light beer.

209,754,archyquaffer,3.59,"Poured from a 14.9 ounce nitro-can into a shaker pint. The label assures me that this is brewed in Dublin, Ireland. Of course, you get this pssst and some foam overflowing the can as you crack it. A gentle pour produces wildly cascading, settling froth. I can just barely get the beer into the glass with a slight dome of a head over the top. The head stays creamy throughout, leaving lacing along the sides of the glass. I really enjoy the effect of these nitro balls.  I get that typical mineral smell and flavor that I've noticed in many another old world brew. The nitro really brings this flavor out, and contributes to a very creamy mouth feel that would seem more watery without it. Even so, the thinness of the malt is very apparent. Definite tones of coffee and maybe slight unsweetened chocolate. Mild bitterness and metal in the aftertaste. (I actually don't mind metallic flavors within reason). Underlying everything is a light roasted malt sweetness.  I really can't rip on this beer- though that seems popular in these web pages. People in my town seem to really like it (Butte, Montana, home of a large Irish-American population). I've not actually drank much Guinness, it wasn't very available during my younger years, and so I can't compare it to the Guinness of yore or of Ireland that many people equate with the beverage of the gods. I've had it on draft locally and thought it was perfectly fine, though nothing to rave over- it also makes a good black and tan. It makes a pretty good session beer since it is rather light in carbs, calories and alcohol.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Blackness is perfect, the persistent and creamy/dense foam is incredible. Unfortunately, smell is almost null. The foam is there to be seen, not be smelled or tasted. In the taste you can feel nice chocolate and coffe tones, really enjoyable.. but there's almost no malts or hops in it the taste. Body is really light and delightful, all the carbon goes to the foam and the carbonation goes to zero.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Seanem44,4.57,"I'm a little shocked by the poor reviews here, but in retrospect I am not surprised given how poorly it tastes over here. I was fortunate enough to have Guinness Draught at the source in Dublin, Ireland. In fact, that is where I am standing in my Avatar.  So this review is for the true version, the one you can only get in the Motherland. For the American store bought can and draft version, I give it a 3.25/5.  Actually, all the Guinness I had in Ireland was spectacular. My wife will tell you, I could not get enough of it. It tasted heavenly. Classic. The epitome of how a stout should taste.  When I left Ireland, I did a test. I had a Guinness on tap at a bar at the Newark, NJ airport we had a layover at. They did not pour it the way they said it should be done, as per the demonstration at the factory in Dublin. They did not let it sit for 90 seconds before topping off. It had a bitter taste of metal.  If these reviews are for what we have here in the States, then yes, I would agree. But for true Guinness Draught, in Ireland proper, I feel my review is more fitting.

209,754,troobie,2.27,"There seems to be some confusion due to the many varieties and strengths of Guinness available, so I'll describe my bottle and packaging: - 6 pack of Guinness Draught (does NOT say Extra Cold anywhere on the bottle or packaging) purchased on 03-18-14 at BevMo! - 11.2 fl. oz. bottles that are wrapped in plastic from the neck down to the base - Bottle cap states ""ENJOY STRAIGHT FROM THE BOTTLE"" - Packaging states ""NOW EVEN BETTER"" - No widget - From the website: ""The signature Guinness Draught experience is activated every time you tilt the bottle to drink; the nitrogen contained in the new gas mix is released by the tilting action – that’s why it’s best consumed straight from the bottle."" - Brewed in Dublin, Imported by Diageo - Guinness USA  I'm certain this is the U.S.'s current version of Guinness Draught in bottled form.  A: Just under two fingers of head from a slightly aggressive pour. Head has some white patches but is mostly root beer colored. Settles to about a half finger of foam that holds a solid cap and leaves patchy lacing. Light will show through if held to a bright enough source. Beer is an extremely dark brown/red.  S: Chocolate milk, malted milk, and vanilla. A strong metallic bitterness. Burnt toast is just barely there.  T: The promises of this beer's smell are not fulfilled in the taste. Metallic bitterness, concentrated tea, and wood. Almost no sweetness. At the very end, after swallowing, I get a faint hint of extremely watered-down stout.  M: Low carbonation, but enough to just sting my tongue. Surprisingly creamy, but the creaminess has nothing substantial to back it up. Strong drying in the middle. Finishes like water. Mouthfeel leaves me no reason to take another drink.  O: I'm not familiar with the dry Irish stout style. I've had Guinness Extra Stout and Guinness Black Lager, both of which I find much more enjoyable. I can't see buying Guinness Draught over Guinness Extra Stout for any reason.

I guess it's intended for the St. Patrick's day swill gang in this format.  Reviewed the same day as extra stout, and liked this one better, for what it's worth.  Looks black, (dark dark red in the light) not much of a head. Again I blame the bottle and lack of widget. (Then why did you buy it, review the beer you douche.) Smells malty and chocolatey and a little smokey. Tastes like it smells, but with a speck of stale cereal. It's more watery than expected too, especially considering the creamy mouthfeel.

While familiar with this beer as it is often the best option on tap when out at chain restaurants, finally sat down to review this one in detail.  Appearance - Midnight black, with just over a finger of off-white foam that is in no hurry to go anywhere. Other than that the beer is dark enough that you can't see through it and as you drink the beer, some nice foamy rings of lacing are left around the glass.  Smell - Coffee aroma, with some roasty malts. Not a lot else in there but it is well executed.  Taste - Thick dense, coffee flavor, with some caramel sweetness particularly in the foam. Although as I've experienced the craft beer culture in a little more depth, the taste and mass of Guinness no longer seems what it once was, if anything the beer is a touch on the watery side.  Mouthfeel - While a ""heavier"" beer, the composition is rather watery once you've experienced Imperial Stouts and American Double Stouts. Nonetheless the feel is dense and the texture is very smooth.  Overall - While not quite as good as I had remembered it, Guinness remains a go to option on establishments with limited tap selection and a fine beer to consume in a pinch.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Mouthfeel: How can a beer that looks so good in the glass be so watery? Thin and boring.  Overall: I'll get this once and a while if there's no other options on tap, because this is still better than the BMC's of the world. Not by much though.

209,754,Sleepy_Conscience,3.11,"When I was in high school, I had a friend whose dad thought Guinness was the Eighth Wonder of the World. He traveled to foreign countries on business a lot and knew a good bar to get himself a Guinness in every one of them, be it China, Germany, South Korea, Japan...you name it. He always said that to really get turned on to Guinness you need to have it at a bar in Ireland. According to him, it tastes significantly better there because it's closer to the source and the bartenders there know the proper way to pour it. Maybe that's true, although I suspect it might just be the placebo effect and the ambiance of being in a real Irish bar.  Whatever it is, American bottled Guinness is really nothing special. My girlfriend adores stouts, so I've tried a fair amount of them. My favorite is Founder's Breakfast Stout. I can honestly say that if it weren't for the fact that I use them for cooking, I would probably never buy another Guinness. It's not terrible by any means, but compared to some of the amazing stouts being put out today by America's craft brewing juggernaut, it is absolutely nothing special. I can see why, back in the day before craft brewing, people would think this is a great beer. Compared to the insipid pilsners produced by Bud, Miller and Coors, it's pretty damn good. But by today's standards it's bland and a little too bitter.  I also think it's funny how people think of this as a filling beer, too. I remember when I was a freshman in college I met a guy who drank an entire six pack of Guinness in one sitting and it blew my mind that someone could handle so much of a brutal beer like Guinness. That just seems silly now that I actually have a fair amount of beer drinking experience. Today Guinness seems like an easy session beer. I could put down six of these things like they were Keystone Light.  BOTTOM LINE: Meh. I would only recommend this beer if you've never tried it, just to add it to your repertoire. Manage your expectations though. The only good thing I can really say about it is that it looks pretty when you pour it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

One finger, foamy, good retention and nice lacing.  Smell is thin and lightly sweet. Not much stout character that I can pick up.  Taste is kinda like the smell. Just not much to it. A touch of char, a hint of sweetness. Mostly bland.  Feel is okay. A little thin, a little flat. The nitro doesn't really stick in the feel, leaving it kinda dull. It is light and refreshing, which is odd for a stout.  A very light stout without much flavor. Always gives me a chuckle when people refer to beers as ""as thick as Guinness"".

The head quickly recedes to about a half inch of tan foam. Leaves a decent amount of lacing on the way down.  Aroma: Smells like black coffee. Alcohol is very faint; almost nonexistent to the nose. Overall the aroma is pretty weak, but not uninviting.  Taste: I know the canned draught Guinness takes a beating from critics, but I think it's perfect for what it is. It has a creamy, coffee-like flavor with some roasty dark chocolate notes, and the alcohol is almost unnoticeable (like in the nose). It's not super thick, but it's thick enough. Guinness Draught is full of the qualities that make people love porters and stouts - is it best in class? No. But it's never a letdown, either.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and inviting. Very easy to drink. If a ""session dry stout"" is a thing, it's probably this.  Overall: Guinness Draught is much-maligned, but it gets the job done. I feel this beer's rating suffers because so many people think of it as the apex of beer and it's clearly not. But at the end of the day, it's a fine substitute for a chocolatey dessert. You know what you're getting into here; just enjoy it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,A-Ham,3.99,"Not sure if one can make a sound argument against Guinness Draught. You don't even need to taste it to know that it has full flavor, you can clearly see it.

209,754,NiceTaps,3.42,"14.9 oz nitro can in a Guinness glass.  A- Very dark brown color with more than a touch of ruby red at the bottom of the glass due to refraction. It has the nitro cascade look, very cool, that produces a dense creamy mocha-colored head, about a half-inch worth. The head clings heavy to the inside of the glass leaving some lacing.  S-Sweet creamy alcohol, roasted malts, and just a hint of mineral-like smokiness.  T-Dry roasted malts. I pick up some sweets, too, from the hint of chocolate. Slightly smoked.  M- Thin and watery despite the fact that the dense creamy head never waivers. The malt flavor is short lived and the smokiness is unpleasant. There's no body.  O- Guinness Draught always looks great. It's too bad that the rest it does not measure up. Not all bad of a light beer, however.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Few beers are as beautiful as this one. Yes, it is completely overrated. It tastes like a water of sorts, has a very faint smell, has a low ABV, and costs too much. However, it's still enjoyable in the total sum of all its parts (and has a great story and history). It's amazingly drinkable and smooth. I will, of course and with little shame, get this again.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,AaronTheBearded,3.66,"Ahhh Guinness. A classic in sport pubs across the world. I've had this beauty a number of times, sometimes on tap, and other times from the nitro-can. Never from the bottle, though. I'll try to give my take on it...  A - The absolute BEST part about this beer is the appearance. You can't not love to just sit and look at a pint of Guinness - the way the nitrogen cascades through the body, only to settle gently into a lovely off-white head, crisply contrasted with the beautiful, almost-black body. Anyway, enough romanticizing. Let's get practical. You can't see much through the body, unless you hold it to a bright light, where you can only see a very faint red silhouette. On the edge of the glass, you can see plenty of carbonation streaming to the top. As you drink, an incredible lacing occurs all the way down the glass, and lingers until you wash it out after you're done.  S - Once you get past the fact that you just plunged your nose into a heap of nitrogen foam and looked like an idiot in front of your mates, you wipe it clean and try again, only to pick up subtle hints of wonderful malts, coffee, chocolate, and that quintessential barley that goes back generations. Nothing big here, just light hints  T - It tastes like... well... not much. You do get very subtle hints following the nose, but the rest just kind of tastes like cream or milk or something. I understand this is what you might call a ""light"" version of actual Guinness stout, but there really isn't that much here. Doesn't stop me from enjoying it, though.  M - Very nice, light, creamy feeling on the tongue. Goes in smooth, goes down smooth. Like drinking a milkshake - nice and creamy, but not too thick. Wonderful.  O - I understand that most Irishmen say you haven't had a real Guinness unless it's straight from the horse's mouth. I can definitely see where they're coming from. I hope to visit Ireland soon (not just for the beer of course (although that is one reason)), and I will definitely have to try it out. However, I've never had a pint of this beer that I didn't like. Great drinking experience that is widely available. Looking forward to my next one.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,captaincorey,3.65,"A: Dark, onyx with a creamy white head. Great looking beer.  S: Not strongly aromatic like some stouts/porters, but faint hints of chocolate and toffee  T: Rich with notes of chocolate, coffee and toast  M: This really elevates Guinness for me - excellent, smooth mouthfeel, not too thick or thin, just right  O: This is my go - to at bars when they have limited selection of drafts or craft brews - especially when you know they will give you the proper 2 part draught pour to ensure an extra creamy head.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Taste: A big mouthful of molasses. Dull coffee notes and bitter cocoa.  Mouthfeel: Light body borders watery, however, it's a bit chewy but incredibly smooth. Carbonation is light. Crisp, semi-dry finish.  Overall: I'm appreciate this beer... It doesn't excel in any one area but it's easy to drink, it's light, and it has character.

209,754,MichaelProcton,3.6,"Upgraded to a full review 1/13/17; poured from a nitro pint can into a shaker pint glass. I don't mind admitting that nitro is pretty to me, and the beer leaves a steady thick, creamy cappuccino head atop an opaque chestnut brown. The smell is weak in strength, but roasty malt is there, along with the creamy carbonation power of the nitro. The bones of the flavor are solid enough, with more malt and a touch of roasty bitterness, particularly on the back end. However, in both flavor and mouthfeel, there's something that's a little muted, even watery. A beer I still enjoy, but a lot less now that there are so many widely available superior options.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

For the price of $26 for 24 pints, it's the cheapest stout I've seen thus far.  Appearance is ""black"" though in the right lighting you can see the ruby red tinge within your glass. Great heading thanks to the nitro bubble in the can. That ""TSST"" sound when you pop it open is a beautiful sound indeed. Mouthfeel is watery, but not in an unpleasant way. Very drinkable stout with little carbonation. You may end up drinking more than you expected to drink. Taste is light with malty notes and very slight coffee and chocolate on the finish.

209,754,kylelenk,3.64,"Nitro-can, nitro-bottle, nitro-draft, etc.  Appearance - Quite possibly the most beautiful pour of any beverage. The cascading affect, while familiar, never gets old. Leaves a wonderfully thick, creamy head on top with peaks reminiscent of fresh whipped cream.  Smell - Subtle smell for the relatively low ABV count. Very muted hints of chocolate and porridge.  Taste - Although slightly bitter, the nitro body yields a very underwhelming but enjoyable profile. Very easy to drink much like a session beer. Very delicate hints of roasted coffee and bitter dark chocolate.  Mouthfeel - The most enjoyable part of a Guinness. Although sometimes hated, the nitrogen adds a complexity that allows this beer to be enjoyed in mass quantities without getting the gut-rot familiar with other common adjunct lagers.  Overall - For someone looking to get into stouts, Guinness is a great place to start.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,Roguer,3.42,"Fantastic, classic look to this beer: full finger white, thick, strong head, with crazy good retention but little lacing. Solid black brew with tons of tan mixing.  Light aroma, reminiscent of sweet red grapes with just a hint of coffee. Not unpleasant, but not much going on.  Flavor follows the nose: dry coffee, slightly sweet, a tiny bit tart. Black malt makes for an overall rounded flavor, but it's not all that prevalent or roasted. An honest taste shows that this isn't a bad-tasting stout.  Mouthfeel is where I really feel let down. This is an unbelievably thin beer, not just for a stout, but overall. No sting or bite, which isn't bad, but the beer is just way too light; it seems like it's been watered down. Draught temperature (too cold) may be a factor, but I'm not waiting all afternoon for it to warm up.  Guinness gets too much hate simply for being a macro. It doesn't compare to the better, thicker, more creative stouts, but it's not bad, and it's just a tiny step behind some of the lesser craft stouts. It's a very low ABV beer; a better, bigger, chewier mouthfeel would have made this beer significantly more enjoyable.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Thick and consistent head that lingers forever. Mild aroma of cream, vanilla, chocolate and toasted malts. Similarly, creamy, sweet roasted malts and a touch of dark chocolate flavor. Hints of earthy and herbal hops. Mildly bitter, though it gives some random spikes and with a dry and toasted like aftertaste. Light to medium body, but still a bit watery, which is unexpected. Carbonation quite low, tiny bubbles. Classic, used to love it 15 years ago, but general benchmark moved up. Now there are lots of better choices.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,TheChrisK,3.37,"A: This was presented in a cigar bar where the bartenders know how to pour a nitro-tap beer. It was its usual black color with a tan creamy head about two-fingers tall. The typical cascading effect of the nitrogen bubbles was present.  S: You get a bit of a roasted malt nose with a hint of watered down coffee.  T: Very smooth and very creamy feel. The notes you get from the nose do not necessarily translate to the palate as the flavors are slightly bland. It is not bitter and does not leave a bad after taste. The smooth creamy feel makes up for this.  M: The first mouthful is always the best with the foam of the head making the following the most smooth. Every drink from the glass afterwards is not as pleasant, but still smooth. The carbonation becomes undetectable towards the end. It is a thicker beer, no doubt.  Overall: Guinness Draught is a great beer for those who want to try a Dry Stout but are afraid of dark beers. This used to be my favorite stout before I began exploring the beer culture. I have tried numerous other Irish Dry Stouts that have surpassed Guinness. Since I have opened my eyes to new beers, Guinness has fallen as a ""run-of-the-mill"" stout. As many people have said on here, it is a typical go-to stout when nothing else is available, like at a typical restaurant.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,StoutHunter,3.32,"I picked up a bottle of Guinness Draught about a week ago for 1.22 at Glenn's Market. I haven't had a Guinness Draught in a while and I thought I would pick up a bottle and revisit it, so lets see how it goes. No visible bottling date. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a imperial pint glass.  A- The Bottle looks nice it's got a clean and traditional Guinness look to it. It poured a very dark brown color that was bordering on being black and it had some brown highlights to it when held to the light with three fingers worth of creamy tan head that died down to a thick ring that thin ring that left some nice rings of lacing behind. This is a pretty good looking beer, but it looks even better on tap.  S- The aroma starts off with a medium amount of sweetness followed by lots of malts that impart some medium roasted malt aromas with some light chocolate and coffee coming through. Up next comes a real light smokey aroma. The aroma is decent, it's pretty simple and straight forward.  T- The taste seems to be pretty similar to the aroma and it starts off with a lighter amount of medium sweetness followed by a good amount of dark medium roasted malt flavors with some light coffee and chocolate and flavors coming through. On the finish there's a medium amount of lighter bitterness with a roasted malt aftertaste. The taste is decent, it's a little one dimensional but it works.  M- Smooth, pretty creamy, medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel was nice and it works well with this beer.  Overall I thought this was a decent beer and a solid example of the style, it's got just enough roasted flavors to fit in to the style while not being too filling and staying sessionable like it should. This beer had good drinkability, it's smooth, creamy, not too filling, and it's got just enough flavor to hold my attention till i get drunk and not care about taste anymore. I like the appearance and mouthfeel the most, to me that's one thing that sets this beer apart from other beers in the style. What I liked the least amount this beer is the taste and aroma, I think it could handle a little more roast, but I can see how people like it just how it is. I only really buy this beer for St. Patrick's day, but I will order it at a bar if there isn't anything better available. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to get into the world of dark beers, it may not be like a lot of dark beers, but it gives you a slight idea of what they are like. All in all I don't mind this beer, it's nothing that I will go out of my way to get, but when the options are low this makes for a good alternative.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

There really isn't anything to taste until you swallow, and then you get a roasted coffee flavor on the back of your tongue.  Mouthfeel: Treads a fine line between thick and watery. Kind of interesting, but not necessarily in a good way.  Overall: After a lifetime of hearing great things about Guinness, I was very disappointed with my experience.

O: The highlight is the creamy mouthfeel, but aroma and taste are only slightly above average.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,The_Doubtful_Guest,3.42,"Appearance - One of the coolest looking beers of all time: The nitro surge after the pour, the perfect creamy, tan head, nice dark color. Perfection.  Smell - Odd, slightly off-putting sweetness, and faint coffee. Like if you finished a cup of coffee, let the cup sit for an hour, then sniffed your cup.  Taste - Watery weak coffee, slight roasted malt taste. Quick acidic bitter bite that hits the back of your mouth every other sip or so.  Mouthfeel - Surprisingly light and watery unless you get some of the creamy head in your gulp, in which case you get this satisfying creamy medium bodied feel. Low carbonation.  Overall - Looks awesome in a glass, but when it comes to taste and mouthfeel I am disappointed. An OK stout, nothing offensive but nothing amazing either. Even with the light body and low abv, I wouldn't want to have two in a row.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Hesperus,3.36,"Appearance: Black bodied fading to ruby in the thinner parts of the glass. Immense, white, cloudy head with great retention and lacing.  Smell: Roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate.  Taste: Roasted malts with burnt notes along with hints of dark chocolate and coffee.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and thick with low carbonation.  Overall: An amazing session beer, inoffensive taste attached to a highly drinkable body. Far from the best stout, but it's far from being offensive.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,ryan1788a5,3.14,"11.2oz nitro bottle poured into a Guinness pint glass.  A: Pours black with ruby hues. Clarity looks to be very good. Three fingers of creamy beige head retain very well, as it should from the nitro bottle. Thick, clumpy rings of lacing form with every sip.  S: Milk chocolate, burnt malts, steely, slight acidity. a rather drab, muted nose.  T: Bittersweet chocolate, burnt coffee. Burnt malts lend an acidic kick; that token steely, sour-ish twang. Vague sense of fruit, but really it's very clean as a whole. Not much yeast character. The finish is clean and very abrupt, leaving only a faint sense of chocolate and roasted barley.  M: Light in body and watery. It relies heavily on the nitro to prop it up with a creamy, smooth texture. Mild astringency from the burnt malt.  O: As with many beer aficionados, this was my gateway beer. This and a handful of Irish stouts were, for the longest time, the only conception of beer that I had other than macro light lagers like Bud and Coors. Back then I thought this was head and shoulders above those light lagers. Now that I've come this far, I can see that it's really the same concept: brew a bland, uniform, inoffensive beer and rely heavily on deep pockets and marketing to spread it around the globe and make maximum profit, sacrificing quality along the way if necessary. I will go on the record as saying that I still enjoy a Guinness from time to time, and that my own personal preference would still lead me to drink a Guinness over a macro light lager. But when I look at Guinness Draught in terms of what's available and stack it up against some of the other Irish stouts on the market, craft brewed and otherwise, it falls well short of the mark.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Brew_42,3.98,Pours jet black with a tan head that hangs around. Really pretty beer  Smells like roasted malts  Tastes- Big flavor of roasted malts with a little bit of coffee.  Mouthfeel-Big fan of the mouthfeel of this beer. Creamy and heavy. A liquid meal. Might actually be the best texture out there.  OVerall- I liked a guinness here and there. I haven't had it since I went vegan but it's definitely a decent beer that you can get almost anywhere. Everyone should try it at least once.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,fallenshadow,3.85,"A - Looks great if poured properly into a Guinness pint glass. Can't fault how it looks.  S - Roasted barley, possibly dark chocolate and hops.  T - To taste properly take a slug of it rather than a sip. You need to get some dark with the bitter cream on top. Roasted barley comes through and you get bitter hop flavour from the top creamy part. Almost tastes like a coffee mixed with ale.  M - Wonderful creamy texture, the best if directly from the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin.  O - Not really a stout drinker but I quite like Guinness, if only it was not so bitter. I prefer Murphy's stout as its a bit sweeter and easier to drink. On occasion I enjoy a pint of Guinness but one pint is enough for me in a sitting.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

S- Roasted malts, dark chocolate, a touch of hops. Smells like dark chocolate and coffee mixed together. Yum.  T- I pick up the dark roasted malts in the front and bitterness rolls in afterward along with a black coffee taste. It tastes very watered down for some reason.  M- Very watery, thin. Some carbonation.  O- I had high hopes for this beer to be more robust, but the watery taste and mouthfeel makes it a good lawnmower beer. Don't get me wrong, it does taste good.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,freneticamnesic,3.71,"Years after my first Guinness experience: finally a review! Poured from from a nitro-can into a chalice.  A - Poured dark brown, formed a layer of black, brown, and light tan head; settled to ink black body with a thin tan head that lingered the entire duration of my drinking it (around an hour)  S - Roast grains  T - Cream, light roast malts, nuts, and finishes a slightly sour hoppy note  M -Thick and creamy, like a just slightly fizzy glass of buttermilk  O - A lot of people complain that this is just a plain beer, and really light, and it's all just marketing. In a way, that's true. Guinness draught isn't a heavy, complex porter that will change your perspective of beer. But it's a good simple alternative to the other basic lagers or porters you might order with dinner, or at a cafe. It's light enough to not dominate a meal or fill you up, but it's creamy and tasty enough to be an enjoyable alternative when you want something a bit different. Either way, I'm still quite fond of this beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Hulk_Beer,3.4,"I'm a big fan of the Guinness masterpiece, the Foreign Extra Stout. That being said, this is not that. Let's begin:  App- Black in the glass. Against light, its a dark but clear brown. Head was beige and creamy with slight rocks in there. Lacing slides sexily down the glass.  Sm- Typical Guinness roasty notes. I got burnt toast, coffee and dark caramel. Not so much chocolate but it's there. Light for a stout.  Ta- Burnt coffee and chocolate. Not much complexity there. I almost got a dairy flavor but I could be confusing it with my mouthfeel, I still kinda suck at this. There's something missing here, though...  Mf- As stated, milky, dairy-like quality as it washes down. I guess it's the nitro, although the bottle is much more subdued than the can version, which I've had. So there must be something there. I'd call it a medium body.  I said there's something missing in the flavor, and I know what it is. The alcohol is so subdued it couldn't be said to exist at all. It has less ABV than a Budweiser! What are they doing here? The strong notes in the flavor are the reason stouts are usually so high in alcohol, it's balance. Either way, they're not going to see this review, you are and I'm saying it's good, but lessens the Guinness reputation significantly.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,KYGunner,3.24,"The nitro can was created, I would guess, for looks and feel. It certainly succeeds in look as the transformation of this beer, as it enters the glass is both beautiful and entertaining. The head it builds is thick and creamy and congeals into a solid unit. The color is black, plain and simple.  The scent is lacking as some charred malt is present but lost for the most part.  The taste is toasty, charred malt with a back end of sweet creaminess. Problem is as good as it tastes, it's simply not tasty enough. The whole taste gets lost in a wash of watery finish and feel. The nitro seems to take away the very essence of the beer and depletes, what I always felt, was a very good stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Aroma is not very strong. Slightly roasted, malty aroma. Hints of coffee.

209,754,Beric,3.58,"Serving: Nitro-tap into 20oz imperial pint Served: 28 September 2013  Appearance: This is a beautiful beer on nitro-tap. Pitch black with a one-finger foamy, dirty white, creamy head that just sits there forever, floating on top of the beer. One of the best looking beers one can ask for.  Smell: This is where Guinness begins to disappoint the craft beer drinker- the smell is practically non-existent. Unfortunately, there are very few dark-roasty malt notes to pick out in the nose. The beer, at this point, seems rather uninspiring because it practically smells like nothing.  Taste: Okay, so on nitro-tap this one definitely tastes different than other formats. I would not drink Guinness on anything but nitro. You can taste some roastiness, but not much. The beer is rather flavorless until you swallow, when just a kiss the the dark roasted coffee and dark chocolate notes common to stouts come out.  Mouthfeel: Great mouthfeel due to the nitro line. Very silky. After the beer was about 3/4 gone though, it started to feel a bit watery.  Overall: If every beer could look like Guinness (masterful head that just sits there), no beer drinker would ever go unhappy. However, character goes deeper than appearance and, unfortunately, Guinness isn't all that it's cracked up to be underneath the incredible looks. A watered-down, diminished taste for a beer that looks absolutely incredible. I would get this on tap if better options weren't available and may purchase in nitro-cans if hosting parties or making Poor Man's Velvets, but would not purchase in a non-nitro format. I fear that the wateriness would be all too evident in other formats.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,jjamadorphd,3.83,"I very well enjoyed this offering from Guinness - from the packaging to the actual brew itself.  The beer pours a very, very dark brown out of the bottle, then sits in its confines blacker than black. Even in the light the beer looked black, just plain black - it was a sight to behold. The head was thick, frothy, and a beautiful shade of tan; it had staying power and the lacing was thick all around the glass - truly impressive. The smell hinted of citrus with a strong but appealing malty scent. It's mouthfeel was good as well - no stickiness, bold flavor, and little carbonation to get in the way of enjoying the beer - just the way I like it. It's taste was very similar to other Guinness' I have had - strong, hoppy, malty, and just plain good. Overall, I was very pleased with this offering from one of my favorite brewers.  If you drink, don't drive, but if you drive, do us all a favor and don't drink...stay safe...",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,PaulBenjamin,3,"I have always enjoyed Guinness, but over the years I've come to taste so many stouts that there are, simply put, too many out there that are just better.

209,754,ACinSC,3.49,"Fortunately or unfortunately, this was my introduction to the wonderful world of beer. Guinness is all appearance and that's where it gets its fame. Nothing looks better than a pint freshly poured with a four leaf clover artfully designed on the top by a skilled barkeep.  At first sniff, it seems bitter and slightly wort-y and taste quickly confirms this suspicion. The hops stand out and there are few other distinct flavors except a slight tinge of roasted malt. On mouthfeel, it strikes a careful balance between watery and creamy. At the end it leaves a welcome, ticklingly bitter sensation on the back of the tongue.  It's something to come back to, but not for any special occasion. It goes well with hamburgers and fattening foods. In my opinion, Guinness Draught could probably be better marketed in the US as a better light beer alternative to the more cardboard-like taste of American light adjunct lagers (Natty, Bud, Miller).  For what it is meant to be, it does the job exceptionally well. If you expect this beer to make your day or give you a psycho-spiritual experience, get real. It's Guinness. It's a pint of plain. You order it with your burger because you want to enjoy your burger.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

And let's be honest, guinness draught helped you become the beer connoisseur that you are today. Good stout, but not complex, it know its creamy malts with solid roast, dark chocolate and a hint of earth is enough to get you to have one once in a while, and if you say you don't you are a bad liar. Because there really isn't anything to not like about guinness draught, simpler and from another time yes, but still a classic in my book that I keep coming back to. I am already looking forward to my annual guinness this St. Patrick's day.  Had a four pack and on tap recently for St. patricks, and I am just reminded how much I love this stout.

The classic tan head lingers forever. The aroma is light, and smells faintly of chocolate. Maybe a hint of coffee, maybe. The flavor is equally lacking, and again you can pick up a slight bit of chocolate in the background. If you look really hard you can find something resembling roasted barley. The flavors are really nice and pleasant, but they're unfortunately quite muted. Very creamy, very nice mouthfeel, and for a moment makes you think that this beer isn't as light as it is.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,LXIXME,3.62,"A rich cream light tan head falls through itself above a super dark brown to black head.  A rich well roasted grain malts aroma that seem to border on slightly burnt.  Creamy well roasted malts taste, you can almost taste the roasted barley itself, with just the slightest hint of hops or something else similar.  A dryish aftertaste with the roasted malts taste lingering on with this full bodied beer.  A have a fond stop for this beer, it was one of the only beers I could find as a young one that wasn't in the mold of Grain Belt, Pabst, Bud, Miller, Coors and the endless list of crap like those. So in a sense this is the beer that enlightened me to the fact that American light lagers were not the only option and I've been on a quest to try as many different kinds of beers as I can since then.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

A: Pours a deep dark brown, almost black color with a 1/4 inch tan head with medium amounts of lacing.  S: Smells water like watered down coffee, hints of oats, barley, grains, cream  T: Well this is disappointing, lacking the robustness that I expect from a stout, to me it's like water downed cheap coffee, limited flavors no complexity, it's not horrible but its not good either.  M: Carbonation is lower, so is the flavor, medium bodied, it's kind of thick, just has no flavor  O: Well this might be one of the worst stouts I've ever had.

Attenuated flavor of light toasted malt, milk chocolate, nuts. Finishes very mild hops and residual malt. Light body without any creaminess I'd expect from the nice head. I enjoy an occasional actual draught Guinness, although it is mild by comparison to the stouts I usually drink, but this tastes like that Guinness slightly watered down. A pleasant Irish dry stout, but very attenuated in flavor. It was a reasonable accompaniment to dinner.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,TheBrewo,3.48,"This beer was served from a bottle at the Sundeck on Aspen Mountain in Aspen, CO. It arrived in a pint glass, showing a solid cola coloring. It held a creamy, two finger tan head, showing nice retention, and leaving spotty lacing around the glass. Carbonation appeared moderate, and no haze or sediment was noted. The aroma gave sweet, freshly baked raisin bread, char roasted malts, dark cherry sweetness, adjuncty grain, metallic tin, and rich toffees. Our first impression was that the flavoring was lighter than you might expect, but decent once you get past the metallics. As we sipped, deeply roasted brown and chocolate malts, warm wheat bread, and metallic yeast started things off. The middle came to a peak with sweeter milkiness, booze, soured brown malts, mild roast, and soured coffee acidity to pull us to the finish. Here medicinal phenols, more alcohol, plastics, warmed lactics, light smokiness, metallics, and bitter, bready yeastiness dominated the last flavors of the sip. The aftertaste breathed of tinny metallics, roast and char, bittered coffee, medicinals, and plum pudding sweetness. The body was medium, and the carbonation was medium. Each sip gave excellent slurp, with good smack, pop, and glug. There was definite drying following the initial creamy coating. The abv was fine, and the beer drank easily.  Overall, the best thing about this beer was the mouthfeel. This was helped by the surprisingly well-retained head, giving big cream and slurp throughout the entire tasting. Otherwise the nose and flavoring, while showing some positive and robust fruitiness, phenols, and char, gave too much on the metallics and the dry, chalky yeastiness. That being said, the nose was better than the flavoring, and everything else just screams “standard”.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Volcanic type reaction till the carbonation all reaches the top of the glass. Anyways, Ruby like color, dark but still see through. Nice 2 fingers of extremely creamy head. Excellent lacing on the glass.  S - Mild toasty malts, slight coffee hints. Very mild hint of bittersweet chocolate.  T - Toasty malts hit you up front with some bitter coffee notes and a tad bit of the bittersweet chocolate in the back end. Not to intense on the flavors.  M - Extremely creamy, smooth, fairly light with decent carbonation. Extremely nice feel to this. Almost a velvety feel.  O - I like this but I would usually take something else if it were available. However, is very smooth and easy drinking. Good session beer given the ABV and drink-ability. For the price there are some far better stouts out there.

209,754,Mojave_Ted,4.46,"This beer is best from a keg. However, the cans are nearly as good. The bottles are no longer good because they do not have the ~*widget*~, which means the nitrogen infusion process is different.  The nitrogen is really what makes this beer unique. I believe the 'ratio' is 30% nitrogen, 70% carbon dioxide. The nitrogen is why the bubbles are tiny and the beer is so smooth.  The smoothness means the beer can be easily pounded. Compared to ""light"" beers, such as Miller Light or Coors Light, it has ~10 more calories per 12 oz serving. And 5 more carbohydrates (carbs). It actually has less alcohol (4.0% vs 4.2% in Coors Light). In other words, this is pretty near a 'light beer'.  The flavor is mild as well. This is not a heavy, rich or thick beer.  As far as beers go, this is a good beer to have with a meal as it settles well in the stomach. It does not bloat (think Stone IPA).  I absolutely love this beer. I bought the book on Guinness beer. They've been doing this for something like 250 years (can't find my book!). And they got this draught model stout down. There is no other stout like this, even within Guinness' portfolio. And it is very unique overall in the beer world.  One thing I always tell people who ask about Guinness is that when I am in the mood for 'beer', I don't drink Guinness. It has none of the flavors of what I think of in beer, whether that be wheat, hops, bitter, etc. It's something smooth and wonderful to drink.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Shade1951,1.35,"It's hard for me to believe that I once actually liked this stout. I don't know whether their formula changed, my tastes changed, or some combination.  Pouring from bottle into a standard glass, there seems to be carbonation, and there is even a nice head that lasts a little while. The color is suitably black.  Smell is of black coffee and roasted ""stuff,"" but fairly mild.  Taste - to me, just terrible. Like weak black coffee with other burnt flavors that I can't quite identify. Despite the head, there is almost no carbonation whatsoever. Almost totally flat. This was not an isolated incident. The previous couple of times I've had this over the past 2 or 3 years - same thing. I hadn't tried it again in quite a while, and forgot just how bad it tasted.  There is some creaminess in the mouth - and yet, somehow, it feels watery.  I had this at a restaurant, and I honestly was able to down only about the first 4 ounces before I gave up. My wife sipped it, and wouldn't have any more. My son drank maybe an ounce, made a face, and gave up. We left the restaurant with still at least 6 ounces left in the glass.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,machalel,2.83,"Appearance: Pours very dark reddish-brown, almost black, but has a creamy pale tan head. The head is thick and lasts a long time due to the nitrogen bubbles. Reasonably good lacing down the glass, but not as much as I was expecting.  Aroma: Faint 'stout' smell of dark malts with a little roast. Also a hint of apricots.  Taste: Roast barley (although it doesn't stand out), malt (although it doesn't stand out), a slight mineral taste (although it doesn't stand out), and a touch of sourness (although it doesn't stand out).  Mouthfeel: A much lighter body than to be expected, but thickened slightly due to the soft nitrogen carbonation.  Overall: I can't shake the feeling that this world-famous beer (probably the most famous of the stouts?) relies on a combination of marketing and its nitrogen widget for its success. Attempting to disregard the aspects that the nitrogen lends to the beer, it is actually very simple and unimpressive. It's not bad, but it just isn't good.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

This is of course one of the more common introduction beers for most people to something other than a macro-lager. It looks wonderfully deep dark with reddish highlights and a very nice white frothy head developing from the creamy pour. The smell just isn't there though. After years of drinking other stouts, this beer just lacks the good nose of a stout. There's some light bread crust smell and maybe some dried grass, but it's not much. The taste, while better than a regular can or regular tap line, is still just average. It's creamy and dry finishing, but very watery overall. The body of the beer is just so wimpy after you drink other stouts. Tastes mostly of brown bread and a little of bitter, dry hops. Not a terrible beer, but not great.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Slight sweetness and a hint of molasses.  Taste: Despite the black appearance, Guinness is very light on taste. Hints of roasted chocolate and some dark coffee bitterness on the finish. A bit of a 'soy sauce' flavor. Not much to the palate, just a nice light stout.  Mouthfeel: Between thin and medium in body. Ever so smooth and creamy. High drinkability.  Final Thoughts: Guinness Draught is basically the classic session ale. However, without the nitrogen widget it would probably not be as popular. Would I drink it again? Yes, it's a classic that almost every non craft beer bar has on hand.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Smells like...nothing really. Some light, weak roasted malt, maybe. A bit of a stretch even there.  One of the most watery stouts you'll ever drink. Stale, bitter coffee, ash, a small amount of roasted malt. Just not a whole lot there, and what is there isn't good.  Light to medium bodied, creamy (due to the nitro delivery), drinkable simply because it's basically black water.  Not impressed. This is the prototypical Irish beer, and I'm sad for Ireland because of it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,MikeAAL,3.45,"A lot of people love this beer, but I can't just hop on the Guinness bandwagon.  It's a beautiful beer. It pours a dark, black color. The carbonation takes about 5 seconds to come to the top to form a beautiful creamy tan head.  It doesn't have much of a smell. Like alcohol.  It's doesn't have much flavor to speak of. Maybe a little bit of malts and a bit of bready flavor.  It's very watery and carbonated. Despite the high carbonation, it's still very creamy.  Pretty average. Not a lot of flavor. I prefer Murphy's to Guinness.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,PaterMorse,3.62,"Today was a quick stout taste test of macro-brews: Guinness Draught, Guinness Extra Stout, and Murphy's Stout.  A: Similar to Murphy's (poured black, etc.), but head a little creamier in color (trending more tan than white, like Murphy's) and less persistent -- lasting longer than most stouts but not as long as Murphy's. Good side stick..  S: Note quite as pleasing as Murphy's -- perhaps a little gutsier, but alos less complex (and Murphy's not complex in the first place). Beer/stout smell, and that's about it. Aroma not as potent/sharp as Extra Stout. A little skunky -- frankly evoking the cross between a urinal and a fraternity basement...  T: Very used to this beer, so hard to describe it -- but that candidly may be because it's relatively non-descript. Not as watery as Murphy's, but still an easy drinker. ""Flavors"" just not all that prevelant. Roasted barley, and that's about it.  M: Fine. Lite to medium body. Balance if fine, if not a little soft.  O: An easy, if unremarkable, staple.  Repeat? Sure. It's easy, it's known, it's imminently drinkable. In other words, I'd buy for a party and would grab one occasionally for myself when I want an easy-drinker or something simple that doesn't make me think... It's just not that much fun -- more an accompaniment to a good time than an experience itself (like so many other stouts).  Where Ideal? Football game. Fraternity reunon.

Deep, deep brown (not quite black) with a thick cappuccino-colored head that last throughout and leaves big lacing on the glass. Aroma has hints of roasted malt (some coffee, but not much) and a little nondescript sweetness. Taste is about the same and the nitro can provides a velvety-smooth mouthfeel.

Appearance: Say what you will about Guinness, but it looks pretty damn awesome with the cascading nitro bubbles and the exceptionally creamy off-white head that lasts...forever? Color is a very dark ruby brown. Not quite black.  Smell: Aaaand, it's downhill from there. Not much going on. Bready. Some slight hints of roast and caramel, but mostly just bready. Really not a bad smell by any means, there just isn't much of it.  Taste: The sour mash is apparent, and the only thing about the flavor of this beer that attempts to stand out. A lot of bready malt again, with a slight sour twang. What isn't apparent is roasted malt, or chocolate, or coffee, or any of the flavors that I've grown to expect in a stout. Okay, okay, there's SOME roasted malt. But it's remarkably mild. At the end of the day though, this is not a bad tasting beer at all. And unlike other macro beers, it doesn't taste like water. It's flavor won't impress you by any means, but it isn't water.  Mouthfeel: Thin and slippery. The nitro makes it extremely smooth. But it's quite thin. Far too thin.  Overall: This is essentially the only macro beer I ever consider buying. Unfortunately that's about the biggest compliment I can give it....In all fairness though, it's not a bad beer when all's said and done, and on certain occasions I just can't help drinking a few (cough, St. Patrick's Day).",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

With that off my chest, here goes a classic for me (I named my dog Guinness).  Pours a foamy but thin head, which lingers. Black as the night.

It was a good choice as I had forgotten how good their products are. This one is perhaps the weakest, but it is still good and appropriate for the style.

Hang in there, though, because for some people this is THE beer to have. On the tongue, a bittersweet cream start, followed by what I can only describe as a charcoal middle, and a VERY dry chocolate finish. It all sounds awful, I know, but it works in it's own unique way, including having the shortest lasting mouth feel I've had in a beer so far.  This is not a session beer by any means, but every once in awhile I'll get a craving for the unique experience Guinness provides, much preferring their Extra Stout, and the Draught is a perfect companion for a thick burger or heavy chili.

209,754,bogggyboys,2.65,"Ahh…a “Pint of Plain,” the Workman’s Friend, a Guinness Draught, a living piece of history directly from dear old Ireland, supposedly anyway. I like Guinness for what is, not for what I want it to be, and that’s enough for me. Guinness is now a mass produced mega-brew, and the reality is that it’s not much better than any other brew produced on that scale. Initially, it pours dark with a nice creamy head that disappears soon enough. The first sip tastes of roasted malted barley, but as your taste buds adapt to the smoky, dark flavor it has a refreshing but watery taste. It is a porter in name only, and much closer in taste to a dark lager such as “Michelob Dark” (although smoother than more drinkable). I’m not necessarily a beer snob, but a modern Guinness Draught is no match for a quality micro-brewed porter. You won’t have to twist my arm too hard to get me to drink one, but this beer is nothing special.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Just a deep bready musk, nothing too strong or weak, just a presence.  T - Smooth and flavorful, good ol' Guinness never disappoints. Dark chocolate, some pumpernickel, milk chocolate, a little bit of roasted marshmallow, some fudge maybe, lots of dark hops, and the spirit of the Irish of course.  M - Smooth yet slippery. It's very easy to drink because it's smooth, but I would like a little more character there.  O - For as long as I could remember, Guinness Draught has been one of my favorite beers, and finally getting to have it on tap poured in the CORRECT manner is just incredible, it just tastes so much different than the canned Guinness or the bottled Guinness or Guinness just sloshed into a glass by an inexperienced beer pourer.

This pours a nice black color with a large foamy mocha colored head (far larger than I'm used to on nitro bottles, perhaps this is due to removing the nitro widget).

209,754,bsmith1029,3.59,"Sooo I hated Guinness when I first started drinking. This has changed over time. I would not consider it an Imperial Stout like many do. The new recipe they made for it (I think in the 80s) has changed the consistency of the beer. It was designed to be the thick low ABV meal like beverage for english monks and Irish farmers who didn't need to be drunk allot nevertheless I digress. I do love this beer and I really wish it wasn't owned by ""the big man"" like sooo many beers that are over-popularized and overrated. I do consider this beer to be overrated, then again, it's sooo good! This beer would pair well with (in my opinion) nothing. Needs to be drank after dessert or meal. Can stand alone (IMO any beer can stand alone without a cheese or a meal unless itsa AAB). Should be consumed after the AABs (bud, miller, coors, PBR), after the medium and/or amber beers. I'd consume the real hoppy and bitter type beers after my Guinness (if I was lining up my palate). Get it on tap, so much better then bottle or can? (wtf Guinness cans?). L: Dark brown almost black, cannot see through it, creamy, dreamy, head retention is perfect. At least an inch that stays and dissolves to about 1/2 to 1/4 inch by the time you finish. Everyone has seen the shamrock that they put on the beer on St. Patty's (it pretty much stays on top and in tact if you drink cautious). S: Not a strong smell, burnt wheat, smoky maybe. T (and mouthfeel): Very creamy, milky, smooth, buttery, surprisingly light, almost malty (certainly not hoppy), slightly sweet maybe like a vanilla or carmel sweetness idk. On second thought it does have a carmel like flavor. The after taste is really my only complaint with Guinness. Its not a crisp after taste but a sticky milky after taste (pretty typical of stouts and porters). The ""burnt taste"" lingers in the palate on the back of the tongue or in the back of the mouth too long.

Smell: Smells of roasted malts with strong notes of bitter chocolate.  Taste: Moderately hoppy up front, with a bitter, roasted malt finish. Rounds off with some hints of dark chocolate and coffee. The flavor is a good bit lighter than the appearance and smell would lead you to believe. I've heard this blamed on the nitro that Guinness adds to get that perfect head and it wouldn't surprise me to be true.  Mouthfeel: A bit lacking in body and weakly carbonated.

209,754,deleted_user_704966,3.88,"The most famous and widely available, it seems that the bottled variety has been significantly smoothed out over the last few years. What was once a very heavy, moderately bitter stout is now a light, neutral snack redesigned for warm summer days instead of dark winter rains. The nitro cans have a bit more body, but still don't approach what I once craved nightly.  In color it's nearly as dark as ever, almost pitch black with hints of red around the edges, and the head is certainly as robust, still taking a minute to settle down and never quite disappearing.  Tastewise there's not a lot of flavor. It's more creamy than stout, with faint hints of malts and coffee, but nothing strong. I like a smooth beer, but in this case it feels too smooth, like a completely flat beer, with no bite from hops or alcohol to add any zing to it.  Overall, a light, easy-drinking beer that bears little in common with most other stouts. Even the black lager might be closer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,NilocRellim,5,"I spent quite a bit of time in Ireland and have since became a Guinness-snob.... I will say this: The Guinness that you get in (most of) the rest of the world is not anywhere as good as it is in Ireland. Even in Ireland you can get a bad Guinness... I found that this was caused by a few things, but more often than not it was because of a bad/dirty tap or line from the keg to the tap; I have even sent a few back when I was in Ireland because of the taste.  My rating/review is for the Guinness that you get on-tap (nitro) in Ireland.:  The bartender holds the Guinness tulip glass at a 45 degree angle until the Guinness reaches 3/4 full. The Guinness then has to settle or ""cook"" until the nitrogen bubbles stop flowing down the glass. Once settled the bartender holds the glass under the tap at no angle and tips the tap back, allowing the Guinness to flow more slowly, creating a nice domed head. The Guinness then settles (cooks) a second time before it should be consumed. The whole process should take 119 seconds.  The proper Guinness should be incredible black, hardly letting any light through it at all. The head should be off-white, thick (as if able to hold a coin), creamy, with no large bubbles (called frog eyes). It should not have that strong of a smell to it, but the smell should be something creamy (yes, creamy), slightly spicy, and slightly roasted barley. The taste should be very smooth... VERY smooth. It should NOT be overly bitter, but there is some there. A lot of people just say that it taste like coffee and chocolate. While a Guinness should taste of these things, none should be dominant over the rest.  Guinness from the bottle or from the can are not nearly as good because they tend not to drink as smooth. Maybe it's the aging that is done or the characteristics of the can or bottle that it picks up, but you CANNOT get anything better than Guinness on tap in Ireland.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

O: this makes me remember why Forign Extra and plain old Extra Stout have made me jaded and won't get Guinness on tap unless I am in a crappy bar where my options are Budweiser or Guinness. all in all I am left wanting but you know, one of the best macros I know of.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,spdyfire83,4.8,"291st Review On draft at Against the Grain Served in a Guinness pint glass  I can thank this beer for kicking off my enjoyment of craft beer as our paths first crossed at a small bar in Rome, Italy, during July 2005. Cheers to bspringer for wetting my whistle! It's been a fun ride since.  This review of a “Pint of Plain” comes from notes.  A: Very deep brown; I’ll call it black. Single (creamy khaki) fingernail head.  S: Roasty. Deep. Rich. Complex. Roasted malt, chocolate, molasses, and hint of coffee. Exceptional.  T: Follows smell. Classic. Heavenly. And oh so tasty! For a Dry Irish Stout it does not get any better than this.  M: Full bodied with appropriate (creamy and smooth) carbonation.  O: I don’t mean to be cliché here, but Guinness in Ireland tastes way better than Guinness elsewhere around the world. I’ve enjoyed a pint on four continents and it doesn’t get any better than within a 2 mile radius of St. James’ Gate. The mirco market in Dublin is okay at best, but having this gem on-tap nearly everywhere you turn in Dublin is wonderful. Some might judge and compare this beer to likes of Corona, Miller, Coors, etc. due to the mass production and wide-spread reach, but this beer is truly world class.  Reviewing beers on this site is surely subjective, but when it comes to rating a beer, it should be based on its merits compared to other beers of the same style. Hands down, this is the BEST Irish Dry Stout from draft on the planet! This is the benchmark. No questions asked. I’d highly encourage people to remember that when they are reviewing this beer. I understand the bottle and canned version of this can vary greatly while a non-Irish tap will not taste as good; however, if you ever have the chance to enjoy a pint of this from a pub in Dublin, rest assured, you will not be disappointed. If you find another Irish Dry Stout that is more enjoyable, please send me a bottle or message with the name and I’d love to try it. Until I find one that is better, I’ll keep going back to this beautiful creation every time I need a quick reminder of what started my love and enjoyment for craft beer. Cheers Arthur and here’s to another 253 years of the beautiful black stuff!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Hoppsbabo,2.94,"Guinness is often the only beer worth drinking in English working men's pubs. Haven't had one for well over a year.  A: I think everyone knows what Guinness looks like.  S: A bit of smokey malt. Not strong.  T: Metallic, watery, slightly smokey and sour. No coffee at all. Some citrus in the aftertaste.  M: It's got a widget so it kind of feels like it's been pulled from the pump. Otherwise, there's not much interaction with the tongue at all. Pretty poor.  O: I've been serious about beer for a year and my palate has evolved somewhat. It's a heck of a lot more insipid than I remember but for the casual beer drinker it's still a great alternative to lager.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,StJamesGate,4.01,"On draught at Grogan's (The Castle Lounge) - Dublin, Ireland.  Creamy nitro parchment collar proud of the rim that rings over ruby-tinged black - the classic nitro look. Roast, molasses and burnt sugar on the nose. Dark toast, smoke, a bit of Band-Aid, dark acid malt, with hints of oily coffee and baker's chocolate, then dried orange peel and branch hops to end. Roasty finish and light but long bitter drying linger. Smooth, creamy but a bit thin, and some chew.  With my login name, it seemed natural to write up this beer for my 1000th review.  I'll say a couple of things to start: It's true that Irish stout is not at its best on nitro, that Guinness is now served too cold, and that the pint has been dumbed down in the 15 years since the merger that created Diageo. Even the average Irishman would agree with the latter two points.  But it's also true the Guinness is better in Ireland. This is down to freshness due to fast turnover, line cleanliness, and it not being pasteurized (supposedly). The best pint I've had in London or New York is no better than a mediocre pint in Dublin, that's just the way it is.  And this entry in BA covers no less than 3 products: the tap in your average pub, Draught cans, and the drink-from-the-neck Draught bottles. The cans are sometimes better than a bad draught pint but the bottles are dire, almost a different product, and their inclusion here drags down the overall rating for this beer.  I'd also say to all the haters (and there are plenty) that for 50 years or so there wasn't another Irish stout. That makes this the standard; hopped-up 6% ABV craft-brewed Irish stouts are often historical recreations that are almost a different style, in much the same way that Brooklyn is a ""pre-Prohibition"" lager which can't be judged against MGD. I'm not saying that makes Guinness a good beer, but it should be taken on its own merits - laying it next to Cadillac Mountain is comparing apples and oranges.  With all that in mind, this is an understated light dry stout, nuanced but sessionable. It does differ from pub to pub - this pint was particularly sour, others are more chocolaty, creamy, or even meaty - and rewards repeated visits. Not the best stout, perhaps, but a good gateway to stout and craft beer both and very often the best option in many pubs.  Is there a better mass-distributed macro beer?",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,jimilayne,5,"The reason people knock Guinness is the same reason they dye their hair green, the need to be different and stick out. You want to sit here and rate it a 1 or a 2? Fine, go ahead and make yourself feel better. Easy 5 in my book.  7:45AM footie match at my local pub, you know what pint is getting the call.  Delicious in it's comforting flavor, warming in it's beautiful ascending volcano appearance and always dependable for it's drinkability. It's the old girlfriend you just keep going back to because you can't say no to her and you just don't quite feel right with anyone else.

209,754,javatime,3.38,"I just returned from spending 10 days in Ireland and have to say the imported Guinness I just picked up tonight in bottles is way different from what I had on tap while in Ireland. I've had a few Guinness' over the years, but had to pick up a 12 pack after returning home to judge the difference. Overall, the appearance, smell, and taste is no comparison to the outstanding Guiness on tap so I am slightly biased. It's pretty much a staple in every pub, but for the imported bottles used for this review make it just an OK beer. The head is much smaller and the smell and taste is just average.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,irishgoat,1.65,"Bought in a Dublin pub.  Appearance: This beer does look great. Presentation wise it is fantastic although having to wait 2 mins for the bartender to do the pointless ""2 part pour"" is annoying. I realise that getting the head to sit perfectly above the rim needs you to stop and wait a few seconds but it doesn't require anywhere near as much theatre as it's given. The taste of course, like any other beverage in the world, isn't affected by the number of times you pour it.  Smell: Not much going on other than a little cocoa.  Taste: Blandness. There's a little bitterness, a little maltiness and some more cocoa flavour but that's about. Aftertaste is a nice bitterness that fades far too quickly.  Mouthfeel: The creamyness of the head is nice but after that it's watery and slightly oily for some reason.  Overall: Meh, I've had plenty of nitro stouts and Guinness is by far the most watered down, mass appealing of the lot.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Analog_kid,2.74,"Over the years, I've tried Guinness Draught many times. And every single time I've tried it, my toes curl and my tongue hates me. My wife, however, who is of Irish descent, loves it. But, being the objective person I am, I have read the reviews among my peers at BA and I thought I'd give this beloved draught an honest try.  The first thing you notice is the bottle it comes in. Just put it on the table, and look at it. LOOK AT IT. It's just beautiful. The gold logo on that black bottle is the envy of every bottle designer on the planet. But I have to open it up sooner or later, so I'd better get to it.  I poured the draught into a regular pint glass (sorry, it's the best glass I currently have) and watched that classic head appear. A dark brown, almost black body appears with a creamy, tan head. The beauty continues!  The smell. As others have noted, the smell is malty, though faint. Even detecting some of the hints of dark chocolate that others have mentioned.  However, this is where things go horribly wrong between me and Guinness Draught. The taste. Wish me luck...  ---  First sip:  Yep, burnt coffee. That's pretty much what the first sip of Guinness always tastes like to me. Burnt coffee with hops in it. That said, it is creamy as others have noted. Nice lacing, too!  Second sip:  Burnt coffee flavor is starting to fade after a few minutes. Still bitter. But the lacing is still there!  Let me finish this. Be back in a few...  ---  Okay, I'm back. So, I've finished my first ever Guinness Draft. It did finish out smoothly, but I still have this bitter aftertaste even after 5 minutes. After all the hype, I just don't get it. To be fair, I'm a wheat and lager guy. I could drink a good wheat beer like it's water. This stuff, though? Meh.  Maybe stouts, like oysters (which I love), are an acquired taste. But I'm beginning to think that the appeal of this beer has more to do with its aura than its actual content. Either that, or I'm going to have to fly all the way to Dublin to try one right out of a tap. Till then, I'm sticking to my wheats.  Pros: Beautifully bottled, beautiful appearance. Creamy mouthfeel. Cons: Bitter aftertaste.  Hey, at least the lacing is still there after 20 minutes!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,ErikSkidmore,3.91,"This beer seems to be slammed by craft drinkers way too much. I think it is a pretty solid stout.  A - The beer pours a dark brown color, but because of the nitro widget the brown rises and turns into a very creamy nice 1 1/2 finger of head and the beer turns black with tinges of dark red on the edges. Great looking stout.  S - A lot of people say it is hard to get a nose on this but right away I get hints of chocolate and roasty coffee in the first smell.  T - Roasted malts, once again chocolate, and robust coffee. Good taste.  M - I have had a few stouts and this one is quite light-bodied, but smooth.  O - Very solid stout, not my favorite but an easy drinking decent beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Thepumpkinpiper,4.12,"This used to be my top beer choice for roughly a decade, and still hangs by a thread as my number 1, with Murphy's Irish Stout encroaching rapidly on the spot. I swear that Guinness has changed over the last while - it seems a bit watered-down. That, and the ad-campaigns are seemingly more and more geared towards a club crowd; something, needless to say, seems off at the old Guinness brewery lately.  That said, it remains a perennial favourite of mine.  Look - Beautiful-looking beer. Classic ruby-black colour with an unforgettable appearance right after the initial pour as the beer settles.  Smell - Faint hint of roasted barley, but not much going on here.  Taste - Slightly bitter, roasted barley flavour. No trace of hops that I can detect. Lingering bit of bitterness. Bit of coffee.  Feel - Milky, goes down as smooth as satin. Lately, has felt a bit watery though compared to what I remember. Little carbonation, which is a good thing.

The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but is sooo smooth and creamy. Easily my fav part of this beer.  Overall: Well, it's Guinness.

209,754,Beer_HOPper,3.91,"I was fortunate to have a few pints at the St. James Gate Brewery and Storehouse in Dublin that I will never forget. I must say the pints in Ireland are much better than any where else.  I learned how to pour a Guinness from tap while at the brewery. You have to let Guinness settle for at least a few minutes before drinking. Otherwise, the nitrogen is going to affect your enjoyment. There are a few other tricks that most bartenders are unaware of that will affect your pour. Authentic Irish bars should know how to pour a Guinness correctly, beware of others.  Myth has it, if you tap the side of your pint of Guinness with a coin and hear a metallic sound, then, this pint is NOT ready. If you hear a thud, like tapping on wood, then, this pint IS ready to enjoy.  Appearance: 2 fingers of creamy head and very dark brown to black body. IMHO, Guinness set the standard of what a beer should look like right after a pour. 4.6  Smell: Oats, biscuit cookie, with some milk chocolate, 3.7  Taste: creamy coffee, chocolate, butter biscuit cookie and oats, 4.2 Yum!  Feel: much thinner than it looks. A little sticky like milk chocolate, 3.8  Overall: this is my go to (can) beer and standard dry stout, 4.07.

Best enjoyed a bit warmer than most Americans prefer their beer, but this allows you to really experience the full flavor and aroma of this exceptional beverage!  Not really a beer you will want to drink all night or after a heavy meal, since it will seem too rich and robust at that point, but best enjoyed early in your drinking session.

Look: Poured a deep mahogany color, boarding on black but did let some light through along the edges. Head was a thick 1-finger of lighter tan foam, your typical Guinness head. There were some carbonation bubbles floating around.  Smell: Roasted coffee and some dark winter fruits. Some spicy biscuit.  Taste: First was a bitter coffee note followed by a light plum or raison. Then a roasted malt set in and carried into the finish. Overall a very light palate with high drinkability.  I can’t quite see how this beer falls within the Stout classification. It seemed more like a Schwarzbier to me. It’s a nice beer for the summer when you’re tired of lighter styles like Pilsners or Pale Ales.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Roast malt, mocha, and floral hops surface initially in the aroma, accompanied by a hint of nuttiness. Toffee and a bit of cola add complexity. There's a touch of diacetyl present.  Flavor is slightly smoky, rich roasted malt, with an underlying nutty tone. There's a touch of caramel in the background, and the finish is a touch bitter and dry.

The finish is a mix of roasted barley and chocolate with a hint of sweetness.  M - Medium bodied with mild carbonation. Smooth and very creamy with dry and roasted finish.  D - Very drinkable.

I can't believe I used to think of this as a ""heavy"" beer back in my college days. This is light as can be with an almost watery mouthfeel. Extremely easy to drink a few in one sitting. Has a decent mild coffee flavor with a roasty finish. Not a profound taste, but pleasant nontheless.  This is a great session beer. Also good as a ""nightcap"" after an evening of heavy craft beer drinking due to it's smooth feel and low ABV.

Pours near black but with ample carbonation mixed in leaving most of the pour an airy tan until the bubbles rise to form a fine creamy tan head. The dark liquid can then be seen to be clear and a deep mahogany.  The aroma is excellent except for being quite faint, even given the relatively weak flavor one finds upon tasting.  Mouthfeel: smooth, but surprisingly thin. The thin body is initially hidden, in part, by the amp;le soft carbonation.

First of all, it looks spectacular ... it has to be the best beer visually. For that reason, you really have to have this on a pint glass to really appreciate it. Also, it's great with burgers, but it can also double as an after dinner beer.  Although Guinness has a creamy, thick mouth feel, it really doesn't have many calories, or a high ABV.

Despite having had the unequivocal joy of tasting some of the best stouts in the world, I think it's important to put both feet firmly on the ground and have a few pints of the grandmother of all stouts: Guinness.  A: Black on first sight, but quite obviously a dark ruby red when held against a light source. Gorgeous creamy off-white head, meringue-like texture when tapped properly. Put fingers in it to make little Bart Simpson spikes, shouldn't play with food though, naughty boy.  S: Nothing to write home about. Few aromas making its way through the head: watery and metallic notes, slight hints of coffee and dark chocolate.  T: Again, not great. Primary notes are water and iron, with slight hints of roasted malt bitterness. Aftertaste is a pleasant bitterness, yet also accompanied by those omnipresent metallic notes.  M: This is where this beer shines. Gorgeous mouthfeel because of the nitrogen, slides down the throat with buttery smoothness. Sits in the stomach surprisingly light, you can easily down a few pints of this even if you're not a big drinker.

There just isn't anything like a Guinness.  Throw it on on a nitro, pour it right, and if the bartender signs it with TLC, you know you have made it to the gates of Dublin. The head is a modern marvel (circa 1800) and rarely will you drink a tar black beer that doesn't knock you down.  If you have no affection of history or Irish pubs you will likely find this beer totally unfulfilling.

That's not a bad thing necessarily but it really has the aroma and character of a very mild coffee without anything more complex than that to enhance the profile.  It is well crafted however but as much as Guiness seemed to be the pinaccle of beers while I was still drinking starter brews like michelob, it now seems like more of an appetizer for more complex selections like Dark Depths or Art of Darkness.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Why this pub draught stuff has surpassed the regular extra stout in popularity is beyond me, because there's no comparison in my view. Even on nitro, it was equally unimpressive, other than the look and the lasting, creamy head. But the body was still watery and the finish disappointing. Taste hadn't changed, the usual suspects for a dry stout, coffee, roasty, a bit nutty perhaps.

Light roasted malts with minimal bitterness in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Light bodied with low carbonation.  Overall - Well.. I hate coffee but I'm not gonna penalize the beer because of that.

209,754,thecheapies,3.29,"Time to review Guinness Draught. Cracked open a nitro-bottle and now pouring it into a pint glass.  Cascading 'head effect' on the pour. That's what I wanted. Extremely dark brown to black. Looked dark brown out of the bottleneck. Bone-colored head stays for good. Excellent retention. A mark of rich proteins in this beer. 4.5  Dark roasted malts with higher bitterness levels. Not a whole lot else. Thought I might have smelled hops, but I could definitely be wrong. There is a minute fruit character, but it gets lost in the mix. Might be because the bottle is not entirely fresh. 3.0  Watery flavors of roasted grains, sod, wet log, and dried clay. Like sucking on a stone. Offers some minerally/metallic elements with moments of sharp, astringent bitterness and an effect of acidity without the flavor. Far-off voice in the distance whispers black coffee, but to tiny reception. But, hey, those roasted grains are the talk of the town, right? 3.0  Creamy as hell, despite a thin body. Light carbonation with the bottle widget in full-effect makes the rabbit come out of the hat, so to speak. Let's face it, Guinness Draught is all about the mouthfeel. 4.0  A simple, Humpty-Dumpty Irish Dry Stout with loads of character, but not many can explain why. A beer to drink and enjoy drinking for those who don't give two hoots about the style or the historical butchering of the recipe over the years. A beer to scoff at for those who have had better dry stouts. Tough to love for those who have had North Coast Old #38, Victory Donnybrook, Beamish, or Murphy's. Tough love is God's love, I suppose. And, for a man who has had all of the aforementioned brews, I can only exclaim ""My Goodness, My Guinness!"". C'mon, if you don't know what this is, you've got no business venturing off into the better options out there. Guinness IS Irish Dry Stout. Guinness IS the import on nitro. Guinness IS a classic. But, the truth is, Guinness is nothing special, and certainly not worth the $5 a pint some bars charge. It's a one-and-done-and-thank-you with a smile, or a fall-back and nothing else. When in doubt, have a Guinness. 3.5",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Honestly, though, I was a little disappointed that the body itself wasn't pitch black, but it's a Guinness, so it's still beautiful looking nonetheless.  S: There are small hints of roast, chocolate, and coffee, but this is really muted.  T: Minor amounts of roastiness with little else. The only thing it has going for it is ease of drinkability.  M: Creamy texture, but thin and watery. Minor dryness on the back end and average carbonation helps it go down easy, at least.  O: Despite being very lacking in all aspects other than its looks, this is at least quite drinkable in the right setting. Even still, I'd have to be in the proper mood for another, if at all.

Mouthfeel - Light bodied with minimal to no carbonation. Creamy, but also has a thin, watery feel.  Overall - A decent, classic Irish stout by Guinness. I like to pick up one of these once in a while, but not my first pick. Incredibly beautiful appearance as it pours.

Mouthfeel was the closest beer there is compared to water. Its very smooth and easy to drink. This beer. Oily mouthfeel afterwards. For some reason I believe this beer is definately made more for the average drinker so in that perspective it is not a bad beer. I am not a fan, but I was not let down.

Overall a terrible brew. I had a debate with my friends if MGD was better which is sad. I don't see what Guinness is getting at here. I was thinking beer for the masses but this was just like a soda water. I wish I had ordered a San Pelligrino instead.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,tobelerone,3.56,"The appearance is probably the most appealing aspect of the nitro-can version of this beer. The color is flat black, the head is big and tan and hangs around forever, and there's the cascading waves of bubbles that move about hypnotically underneath. The lacing is also above average.  The aroma is pretty mild and balances lightly roasted notes with chocolate malt. The taste follows suit; it isn't non-existent, but it is somewhat bland and has obviously bored many of the more adventurous drinkers of craft and bigger beers such as those that populate this site. The nitro obviously doesn't help the overall muted character of the flavor and aroma.  The mouthfeel is decent enough from the can and simulates the tap version well. Its very smooth; the body is thin and a bit watery, while the carbonation is very soft and restrained. Very easy to drink.  Guinness is the benchmark for the Irish dry stout style and shouldn't be compared to a Russian imperial...that should be obvious enough but some of the reviews here give me pause. I don't love this beer but it is what it is and the style as a whole isn't particularly full-flavored or exciting.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Anyways:  Appearance- Poured on tap into a guinness glass it presents a dark coffee like color, accompanied with a thick foamy head.  Smell- Subtle tones of roasted malt.  Taste- Divine. Notes of dark chocolate and malt, with faint hints of sweet cream.  Mouthfeel- Lightly carbonated and creamy. The head of a guinness on tap in unparalleled by any beer.

The beer is an opaque extremely dark brown to black in color. The beer has a finger tall creamy light beige head that has some great retention qualities as it barely reduced at all over the entire life of the beer. Significant lacing is observed.  S: This beer has a very faint aroma of dark roasted malts.  T: THe flavor, like the smell, is also fairly faint with the dark roasted malts being the only distinct flavor that comes through. Very smooth flavor though.  M: On the lighter side of medium bodied with light to moderate amounts of carbonation. Extremely creamy.  O: A classic and a beer I have been enjoying for 20 years...

T: Root beer and very subtle raisin upfront followed by rusty metal and watery caramel mid-palate. Finishes nutty along with some brown sugar.  M: Light-medium bodied, watery and clean.  O: THE session stout that everyone claims is so thick and a ""meal in itself."" Well, good people, these are all just myths. There's a reason why Irish people drink these all day...because they can.

209,754,Immortale25,3.75,"Poured into a Shiner Bock pint glass. No freshness date.  A- As the can is popped, the widget bursts and lets out a little squeal. Once the beer is poured, the white head, that has a yellow shade when inside the body, cascades from the bottom to the top in a great way that I never get bored of watching. Once settled, there's a 1/2 inch head that's primary job is to retain and retain and retain. Without a doubt, the best part of the beer.  S- Light, sugary and creamy mocha smell.  T- Heavy roast that's complimented by the soft mouthfeel. Some smoke, dark chocolate and even a bit of faint oak flavor. Slight bitterness but mainly subtle and restrained overall.  M- As said before, soft and actually quite a thin-ish body for a stout. Billowy creaminess and medium carbonation.  O- I tried to review this like it was my first time having it although I've had many before. I actually used to hate this beer in my younger age but, now that I respect all styles, I enjoy it whenever it's the only good thing on tap at whatever bar with lame selection I happen to patron. That said, my only qualm with it is that it's a bit low of an ABV for a beer with so much flavor.

Texture was very thin and smooth, and taste was of country white bread, pasteurized milk and a side of chocolate. Not a very bitter brew, at all. The most complex flavor came in a licorice form.  Overall, not sure if I poured it correctly, but I was expecting a little more head, and aroma from a world-class brand.

My goal, however is to not let nostalgia get in the way of an honest semi-objective analysis (this was my very first beer).  A - Body is dark dark brown-to-black. Completely opaque. Yields a finger of super fine khaki-colored head that lasts forever (thank you, nitro can). Good lacing. Love the way this beer pours and looks.  S - Some cocoa with milder notes of burnt toast, coffee beans and berry-like fruitiness. Not incredibly aromatic.  T - Mild fruity esters and weak roasted barley flavor up front. A twinge of lactic sourness comes in toward the middle with a stronger slightly acidic milk chocolate flavor. Finish is relatively flat with only a bit of hop bitterness and some malty sweetness.  M - If not for anything else, I love this beer because of the incredibly smoothness and drinkability (especially with the nitro cans/bottles). A little thin for my taste, but again, any thicker and it just wouldn't be Guinness. Ultra fine bubbles of carbonation dance off the tongue, but it doesn't get in the way of the already delicate flavor (I say ""delicate"" in reference to most American craft breweries' stouts).

I've had other stouts much more watery. This one is better.  Overall - A nice flavorful Stout that is much more palletable for beginner stout drinkers than the ""Extra"" which is more bitter and hoppy.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,killianf,2.76,"500ml can with nitro widget, poured into Guinness Toucan pint glass.  Appearance: This is the beer's high point for me, wonderful cascading effect that turns the beer from a murky brown to a pith black. Thick creamy 1.5 finger head forms on top, and is off white in colour.  Aroma: Not bad, but nothing to set it apart from other beers in the style. Coffee is there, as is the hint of fruit that puts me in mind of raisins or sultanas.  Taste: Coffee is present, and there's certainly a sweet note in the finish, but it's muted. I found myself waiting for a kick of flavours or a complexity that in the end just wasn't there.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and easy to drink in one way - you could down a few of these in a night quite easily - but in another way, quite watery. This itself may have taken form the taste of the beer.  Overall: Guinness brew fantastic stout in Guinness Extra Stout and Guinness Foreign Extra Stout, yet this particular brew was unstimulating and not at all exciting for me. Its presentation and drinkability are probably what keeps this stuff flowing in the bars, but for a great tasting Irish Stout I would certainly recommend trying one of their other brews above.

The smell is metallic, but also milky and of semi-sweet chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is smooth and that of bitter chocolate and roasted malts. But again, has a slightly metallic taste, perhaps because of the nitro can. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and very, very smooth.

209,754,Jugs_McGhee,2.97,"11.2 oz bottle (as in the new bottle without the nitrogen widget) of brown glass and with a standard pressure cap served into a conical Guinness pint glass in me gaff in low altitude Los Angeles, California. Acquired at a local Ralph's market. Reviewed live. I expect this to be worse than the nitro-bottle and nowhere near the level of Guinness nitro-draught.  Served slightly warmer than refrigerator cold. Side-poured at a proper 45 degree angle.  A: Pours a half finger head of white colour, decent thickness, and nowhere near the cream of the nitro-bottle. Very disappointing. Colour is the standard extreme dark ruby (but apparent black). Pales in comparison to the other variants of Guinness Draught.  Sm: Roasted barley (but light and weak compared to nitro-variants), light smoke suggesting rauchbier qualities, and hints of chocolate and coffee. A mild strength aroma.  T: A bit creamy, hardly any roast, some coffee, and vague hints of chocolate. A weak-ass version of proper Guinness Draught. A damned disgrace. Where's my beloved cream? Imbalanced and merely decently built. Bland, boring, and dull compared to proper Guinness. Infuriatingly poor in comparison to proper Guinness.  Mf: Smooth, wet, a bit thin, and a bit watery. Not at all creamy compared to the luxurious cream of the proper Guinness variants. Incredibly disappointing.  Dr: Drinkable but an obnoxiously poor decision. The nitro-bottle was far better. As a periodic Irish resident and a huge fan of Guinness, I'm offended at this awful decision. This variant ruins the best macro-brewed beer in the world, and I won't stand for it. Feels like a poorly executed porter in this bottled form. Please don't judge the beer based on this bottled variant; it's a poor representation of the beer.  No doubt this was an upper level directive from those bastards over at Diageo. I don't blame the brewery.  I emailed Diageo customer service about this beer and the removal of the nitro widget - which I think is a disgraceful ploy to reduce manufacturing costs. I received the following response:  ---We are sorry that you were disappointed by your recent Guinness experience. While we have removed the widget from the Guinness Draught In A Bottle, the liquid has remained exactly the same and continues to come from St. James’s Gate Brewery in Dublin. Guinness Draught In A Bottle has always been meant to be enjoyed directly from the bottle. We’ve adjusted the gas mixture so that the nitrogen gas is activated every time you tilt the bottle to drink, providing the signature creamy head each time you take a sip. Guinness Draught In A Bottle is still nitrogenated.  If you prefer to pour a Guinness into a glass, we recommend Guinness Draught in a Can, which still has a widget since Guinness Draught in a Can is meant to be poured from the can and enjoyed from a glass. It is our recommendation for consumers who enjoy drinking from the glass at home, as it delivers an outstanding “from the glass” experience.  If you prefer to continue to pour from the bottles, pouring faster and from a vertical angle will give you a much better head than pouring slowly.  We’re very passionate about our beer and do everything we can to deliver a Great Guinness Experience whether it’s straight from the bottle or poured into a glass. We hope this information answers your question and ensures your next experience with Guinness will meet your – and our – high standards.  Please do not hesitate to reach out with any further questions. We would be happy to offer a refund for this purchase and look forward to speaking with you directly if you would provide us with your phone number. Thank you very much. ---  ^You can draw your own conclusions, but the whole ""nitrogenating according to the tipping of the bottle"" bit seems like a load of steaming bollocks. As a longtime Guinness drinker in mother Ireland and abroad, I'm disappointed in this decision. We want our nitro-induced creamy mouthfeel, ye Diageo bastards!  C  ** 05/27/19 nitro-can courtesy of Zed:  Has probably the most iconic appearance of any beer ever served. Those cascading dark brown waves feeding into the black body - what a gorgeous beer.  Aroma: Brewers' chocolate, creamy aromatics, lovely roasted barley, scintillae of chicory and coffee grounds.  T & Mf: Creamy and soft, with hints of semisweet chocolate and dark malt bitterness feeding into the roasted barley-driven primary taste. Oddly refreshing for a stout if only due to its silky soft mouthfeel. On the light side of medium-bodied.  O: A classic Irish Stout, no doubt about it, but I'm more keen on the Extra Stout and Foreign Extra variants, which bring much more roast to the fore as well as much more boldness and complexity. Rather well balanced, in any case.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,DocJitsu,2.59,"Very dark brown with glints of red. Very creamy foam head that causes this beer to be picture perfect. However, this beer is so thin, flat, and burnt that I've wondered for years what people are possessed by when they choose to spend their money on this poor excuse for a stout. One advantage is it's drinkability. I've often likened it to water into which someone spilled their ashtray, but, water nonetheless. Hence, easy-drinking. I'd like to think that any self-respecting beer enthusiast wouldn't be caught in the darkest corner of the most obscure bar drinking this swill. I'm quite disappointed in my Irish half. Having been to the Guiness brewery and virtually every pub, large and small, around the coastal areas of Ireland, I know that Guiness isn't just some garbage made popular by American advertising like Samuel Adams was--the Irish really have a lot of pride in this so called stout. But, just to put things into context, Miller Genuine Draft and Budweisier was one Euro more per pint than Guiness at every pub in which I had the honor to visit. That speaks to me.

209,754,RoamingGnome,3.47,"Enjoyed on tap out for Irish breakfast. Arrived at my table in an imperial pint glass. Served pretty well chilled.  A) I have a soft spot for this beer. This is the first beer that I ever even took the time to appreciate appearance. I still love the looks of a pint today. It's black in color, with a nice creamy full finger of head. Excellent retention and ample lacing.  S) There is not much to the aroma, and certainly nothing offensive. This is mostly a deep roast with a little hop bitterness.  T) Pretty close to the nose, malt, pleasing roast, very light coffee, hop bitterness. The finish is a little dry, pleasing aftertaste.  M) This is fairly light, not thin though. I've always found this rather creamy, kind of soft, right amount of carbonation. Easy to drink.  O) I still enjoy a properly poured pint of the black stuff. You can find other stouts with quite a bit more aroma, flavor and body, but this is still a classic.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,CMUbrew,3.04,"Reviewed from notes  Served in a Guinness pint glass  A: Appears black, but shows a deep ruby color on the edges when held up to any light. About a finger and a half of ultra creamy white head that slowly fades to one or two centimeters and stays forever. Nice stickage to the glass as well.  S: Faint roasted malt smell. The nitro really masks the nose.  T: Just a roasted malt taste. Pretty plain and disappointing. The nitro strikes again, probably holding back the flavor a bit.  M: The common belief that you need a spoon to make your way through a pint of Guinness is way off base at best. It is actually quite light and fairly watery, and feels even more watery as it warms up. Finish is a tiny bit dry.  O: Guinness kills you with looks and with the price you pay for it on tap. Doesn't live up to the hype generated by the die hard Guinness fans and average beer drinkers.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Almost black body with white head. Damn this thing looks good in a Guiness glass.  Roasted malt. No coffee, no dark chocolate. All malt here. But its not overwhelming. Balanced and drinkable.  I know its watery, but its still good. Very roasted malt is the first thing that comes to mind. Very light body. If this were brewed in the US, it would be an American Black Ale/Schwarzbier. Clean finish that leads to a slightly chewy malt. Those roasted malts are the facade that fades into a soapy feeling.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,EricL,3.19,"Enjoyed on tap.  Appearance: I absolutely LOVE the look of this beer. The wonderful darkness and the creamy white head can make even someone who hates beer want to have a taste. Appears almost black, but when in good enough light, you can see it is actually a very dark amber.  Smell: Nothing special here. Smells like a stout, but not very strong. You can sense a little bit of coffee, but nothing jumps out at you with this one.  Taste: Again, nothing special, but it definitely has a pleasant taste to it. The first sip was surprisingly bitter, with an aftertaste that leaves you wanting more. Definitely hints of coffee that you get at the tail end of a sip.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, an definitely dry. This one's not going to coat your mouth (even though it looks like it might!). Nothing is wrong with the mouthfeel, but like the rest of this beer, nothing is too special about it.  Overall: It's a commonly available stout that's not ridiculously priced. Very average, but it's a beer that I would love to enjoy every once in a while.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,jcomp21,2.87,This beer is average. It tastes a little skunky and watery for a stout.  Has a great mouth feel. Very smooth.  Appearance was dark brown and deep with a light ultra creamy head.

209,754,Darkmagus82,4.13,"Served in a pint glass  Appearance – A nice deep dark color; nearly black, with cascades of nitrogen billowing up from the bottom of the glass as the beer settled a bit. Once settled, a very nice off white head was present. This faded slowly over time giving a moderate level of lacing.  Smell – Roasted barely mixed with a bit of coffee and an ever so slight bit of chocolate. A bit dry and not very potent, but very appropriate for the dry irsih style.  Taste – A nice, very lightly sweetened oat backbone meets the tongue. This is mixed with a nice roasted coffee and the slightest bit of bitter cocoa flavor, just as is detected in the aroma. Toward the end of the taste any little bit of sweetness that was initially present (which is quite little) is lost to more bitter flavors that intensify and leave a rather dry-bitter oat flavor in the mouth.  Mouthfeel – Ah …you have to love a nice nitrogen driven dry stout. The creaminess from the carbonation coats the mouth with a wonderful feel of smoothness. This coupled with the light abv. makes a beer that is very easy to drink. It’s quite enjoyable.  Overall – This is a very nice light Irish dry stout. I think it is classic for a reason – They make a great brew at a reasonable price. Well done Guiness.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Acho,3.45,"A black opaque liquid topped by a small beige head that leaves some specks of lacing. A quite good roasted smell that has some coffee to it.

209,754,WastingFreetime,3.42,"Reviewed from notes taken during a side-by-side Murphy's and Guinness on nitro-tap session.  Has exactly the same nitro-boosted textbook jet-black and tan whipped froth visual presentation as any Irish Stout would when on nitro-tap. Nose presents faint amounts of roasted malt, somewhat hidden (as always) by the layer of foam on top. As it warms, (and the foam lid gets removed) it develops a slightly fruity ""generic esters on burnt toast"" aroma. When compared to a Murphy's side-by-side (also on nitro-tap), the flavor has a slightly heavier emphasis on gentle roasted malt and the body seems slightly thicker. In fact, I would dare say that it seems like the Murphy's starts out quite dry and finishes semi-sweet, while the Guinness starts out semi-sweet and turns dry in the finish. Texturally, both are just about as creamy and smooth as can be given the nitro-tap treatment.  Sometimes I feel like having slightly more coffee grounds bitterness in my stout, and that is when I have a Murphy's. When I want more emphasis on the sweetness of a roasted malt, I drink a Guinness. Admittedly, it seems as though Guinness has been nerfed as of lately in the US, it doesn't have quite as bold an aroma or flavor as I remember it having in my college days. Well, either that or nostalgia is playing tricks with my memories, I'm not really sure.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Had a nice thick creamy head that cascaded to the top of the glass slowly.  Smell: I rich dry coffee aroma from the roasted malt. slight hint of hop bitterness, but nothing that overpowers that coffee aroma.  Taste: Rich and creamy coffee flavor, along with a light fruity hop in the aftertaste, ending dry.  Mouth: Thick mouth, with a creamy carbonation from the nitro-tap.  Overall: Biggest Irish dry stout out there. Just wish it was a little less costly. Draught is what turned me onto Beer, not knowing anything of the craft brewing culture. One of Guinness' lower rated stouts but overall a great memory.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Still a good black and tan when put with Bass Pale Ale. In fact I find it fun just trying to get them to not mix.  Its black, and very frothy. A more subtle malt flavor then it used to be it seems.

Aftertaste is malty and just a touch of sour.  M: Medium body. Rounded maltiness gives a bit of thickness to this ale. I read in an official book about the history of Guinness that a portion of each batch contains a scant percent of the previous batch that has been set out a room temp and allowed to go ""bad"", thus emparting the signature ""bite"" to Guiness.  O: A standard, a classic. I can't say anything bad about this beer. It is one of the first ""craft"" beers that I started with.

Slight sourness.  Roasty malts up from with a touch of dark chocolate. Subtle charcoal. A medium/medium-high bitterness creeps in at the finish and lingers on into the finish.

Their is some metallic twang and an overall taste very similar to an American adjunct lager. The mouthfeel is watery and very smooth. Overall this beer is pretty much average. It is easily quaffable and very thin on taste. I think its so popular because:  1) It has a lot of marketing and a very long and old tradition.  2) It is so light on the palate than an everyday macro drinker can enjoy it and feel and look cool (or at least that's what I feel about it, people love appearance you know.)

Overall a simple, nice beer",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,eye2,3.44,Probably the current favorite due to availability and price. Goes down smooth with a great (although a little watery) taste.  A: Very nice. Great color. Great effects. Impressive when poured into a Guinness glass.  S: It has a little bit of an ocean or just after the rain smell. Not real good. But not unpleasant.  T: Tastes a little like the old fashion baker's German chocolate that was flaked onto roll cakes. Sweet!  M: It doesn't feel like what it looks like. It's more watery and smooth. Not much substance.  Overall: Good-to-Great. It'll remain a favorite for the foreseeable future.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,JizackFH,2.23,"Found this beer review in some of my old beer notes.  This beer pours a dark brown color with some ruby hues. There is a big creamy 2-finger off-white head resting on top. The head has incredible retention, and it leaves behind a big coating of lace on the glass. The nose is pretty light. There are some weak notes of chocolate and coffee, as well as some nuttiness. There really isn't much going on here. The taste starts off with some light roasted malts, and some faint notes of black coffee and a touch of chocolate. There is some burnt bitterness and a bit of a metallic taste. This is just a pretty weak flavor overall. This has a pretty light body, especially for a stout, and creamy carbonation. There is some bitterness and some sweetness as well. I think the creamy layer of foam on top is the only thing that saved the mouthfeel. The drinkability here isn't so good. It goes down really easy, but it is definitely lacking in the taste and smell. There just isn't much going on, and the flavors and aromas seem quite muted. I really just expect a whole lot more in a stout. This beer just really isn't worth the money. You can get a much better 6-pack of a nice craft stout for the same amount of money. I recommend going the second route.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,grapetonix,3.01,"A: Very dark, but light goes through (ultra dark ruby). Medium carbonation. Good.  S: Hot dogs, peanut, tobacco. Slight unpleasant malt style skunkiness makes it pretty average.  T: A mixture of different types of wood, malt, and smoked sausage. Good, but slightly too weak for my tastes.  MF: Semi-rough and slightly metallic/oxide style but still easy to drink.  O: One of the most commonly seen beers in existence. Often the best you can get on a less well-assorted pub given you like stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Adamostella,5,"It is, what it is.  Pours a medium black and when poured correctly using the nitro it is still a thing of beauty even if it's the nitrogen doing most of the heavy lifting.  Taste is clean, dry stout roasted with a bit of bitterness/astringency and is actually quite refreshing. This beer is never going to blow you away but is a classic I go back to when in more of a session mood out for the evening.  Nobody is ever going to confuse this one with Darkness or Dark Lord, but at the end of the day, I wager many of those same fans of the big boys of stouts started their love affair with this one. I for one can say I was one of those people.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,demuzik,4.54,"Tasting based on a Pint served from a Nitro-Tap in the Guinness Skylounge/Brewery in Dublin, Ireland... its a whole 'nother story this way:  The beer presents itself dramatically with the famous cascading brown-to-black effect. Lots of hype and marketing around this, but hey, its still cool and starts things off really well.  The smell is not as strong as most micro-brewed stouts these days, but there are definitely hints of roasted barley, a bit of coffee aroma, and ever so faint hop pizazz.  The taste is quite impressive - it will never taste this good being shipped over the pond - according the the Guinness brewers here, the Guinness draught recipe for domestic distribution is different to that of US/world export, so in some ways we're not really comparing apples to apples on this review...  The mouthfeel is what it should be; creamy, immense, full of darkness, yet light in weight - not syrupy or heavy on the tongue.  Overall, the king of the dry stout in my opinion... but only when served here in it's homeland. The nitro-can-crap they serve in the US? Forget it... for example, should Sierra Nevada ever start exporting to Europe, you can bet I'd pass it by every time - the pasteurization really kills the beer. If you're fortunate enough to try one here... its really another beer, entirely, and quite a good one.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,phenomenologian,2.84,"I am at Old Chicago and just got my Guinness Draught on tap that I ordered. Seeing it now, it has a mere one finger head but I have had this before and when I opened a bottle it had more like a larger two finger head so I think the head was bigger being given out of tap. the head is a creamy brown-ish off white. it kind of is dissipating as I write; I may be over analyzing. The body is jet black cannot really see through it at all but thats to be expected for a stout. holding it up directly to the light I can kind of see some bubbles rising but cannot see much through the blackness of the body.  The smell is not prominent. Its kind of faint and you have to cover the glass with your hand ans whiff it. I pick up the smell of coffee thats for sure. Water smell even? hard to explain the water smell but it makes me think of Keystone light which tastes like water.  The taste is of a few different things: Coffee, malts, and water. It reminds me of a super diluted lager except its a super diluted stout. I can taste water a lot because it has the flavors of the Guinness Extra Stout just really watered down. Other than water I taste malt and coffee. I really like the coffee taste here. The mouthfeel is nice. its not carbonated a whole lot and not harsh so it goes down really smooth. I am finishing it rather quickly because it does have a nice taste I like to go back to and rethink my thoughts about it. The aftertaste is of coffee. The most prominent yet not really prominent taste in this beer is coffee.  Overall, this is an okay beer. I say that because the Guinness Extra Stout is one of my favorite beers of all time and I love that one so much that I cannot give the draught the best review because it seems like a beer with half the character of the imported extra stout. It is nice though. If you are one who is not into stouts or coffee/chocolate beers like the extra stout, this is definitely for you. If you are getting into the stouts, TRY THIS FIRST. if you like this, then get into the darker stronger more coffee-ish and chocolaty beers. I probably will not drink this again when I can drink the amazing Guinness Imported Extra Stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,rangerred,3.39,Served from nitro tap.  Arrived with a nice creamy 2 finger head. Appearance was pitch black.  The smell was not too apparent but there are hints of roasted malt and some coffee.  Taste had the typical sourness expected from guinness along with roasted malt. Some coffee notes sneaking in there as well along with a slight smokiness.  Mouthfeel was typical of nitro beers; creamy with very little carbonation.  I have always liked this beer and still think it is pretty decent. There are better Irish stouts out there but I will always come back to this one.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,CoolBlueDude,5,"I rate this beer to be top among all other beers I have reviewed on my youtube channel. I LOVE this beer. This was the first time I have had it. I recommend this beer to any style or type of beer drinker. If you are a connoisseur who likes nothing but hoppy beers like I do, you can find yourself easily falling in love with a beer of this nature. If you are a regular everyday beer drinker who likes light beers, pilsners, or even lager beer you too will find it a wonderful surprise.  This beer is so silky smooth that you hardly know you are drinking a stout, or even a beer for that matter. It is a real pleasure to drink this beer!  It has a mild aroma to it with a hint of hops and coffee.  First taste is smooth and watery that simply slides over your tongue and down your throat with such ease. Everything is so well balanced with this beer, I can’t believe anyone would rate this just an average beer? You immediately want another mouthful of this amazing beer.  The look is beautiful and the head forms from the bottom, truly something to behold.  It was crisp, clear and refreshing and when I was finished with it, I wanted to go out to buy more.  This beer has earned top shelf in my fridge and has become my ""go-to"" beer. I am certain you will like it. I am just a guy who likes good beer like most of you. I think we all can and should agree with me on this one. It deserves an A+",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,mdaschaf,2.99,"Had at a party at a friends house.  A: Poured black with an impressive head formation, typical of Guinness. Really nice head retention and lacing down the sides.  S: A little bit of roasted malt, but really not a whole lot going on. Slight hint of cream.  T: Similarly unremarkable. A little bit of chocolate and cream, but not much in terms of depth.  M: Medium bodied and creamy, the nitro is doing something I suppose.  O: It was the best choice where I was, but that doesn't make it great. Might drink it again if it was the best choice, but then again, I might just go water.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,JohnnyChicago,2.62,"As an Irish traditional musician, I don't think I have to say that I have had this beer many, MANY times. This particular review is from nitro-tap.  A: Here's that 'perfect pour'. Say what you will about Guinness; it's a damn sexy looking stout. However, bartenders, don't fuck it up with that shamrock crap. That plastic paddy shit is annoying as hell.  S: Looks are where Guinness shines and everything after that is weak. Almost no smell: weak roast and even weaker hop bitterness.  T: Again...weak. The dark chocolate flavour of a stout is there, but it is so subtle that you actually have to look for it when you drink.  D: Mouthfeel is perhaps my least favorite part about Guinness. The nitro initially feels good and then goes flat in your mouth. Drinkability is good in a 'no flavour-easy drinking' sense.  Overall: You've got to respect it for being better than the garbage that is usually available, but Guinness is no great stout. Its just weak and lazy. I did an experiment with Guinness a while ago and that can be seen here: http://beeradvocate.com/forum/read/3601215. Otherwise, Guinness is, for now, most of our 'only other option beer'.

Looks near black, very dark brown, initially there was a thick cap but it subsided and left no lacing. The aroma is light and of watery roasted malts. The flavors are also light watery roasted malts primarily, the body of this beer is disappointing compared to the nitro version, which adds some creaminess and body to help it out. there really is no favorable characteristics to this version, only drink the nitro version.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,DrunkPagan,2.97,"We know it won't be crowned king of stouts, but to be honest, I kind of like Guinness.  If I'm looking for a nice, low-calorie beer, Guinness is what I turn to.  It's dark, but if you hold it up to the light, it's slightly translucent. The smell gets me nothing but a hint of malt, and the taste is a simple, very slightly creamy, little beer. The mouthfeel gets interesting with the nitro carbonation, but otherwise, you pretty much know what to expect.  Though it's always fun to show off to your 'liteweight' friends when you can slam two Guinness and still have room to drink more. I bet they've never even heard of Russian Imperial Stouts.

The body falls into the light to medium range but it stays together while swirling. The taste is sweetly malted and dryly hopped. I have had this in the nitro can and the bottle and I think I prefer it from the nitro can.

S - Light roasted malts mixed with some very subdued aromas of coffee and chocolate. Not much else to remark on.  T - Bready, chocolatem and some coffe stand out the most. Slightly dry and rosty midway through. No flavor overpowers any others and they all are kind of mixing around quietly in the background.  M - Creamy and smooth. Lighter bodied beer with just a bit of gurth. Light carbonation makes for a smooth, velvet like feeling.  O - Everyone says it's like drinking a loaf of bread, and I used to be one of them.

It might be good old fashioned conditioning, but just smelling it makes my mouth water.  T: Dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malts. Subtle and smooth, unlike a lot of really dark stouts I've had. I think that's what makes Guinness so appealing... it is dark yet so easy and straight forward. There's just nothing not to like about it. Even if you don't prefer the darker stronger tastes of stout, Guinness is mild and smooth enough for even the amateur to fully enjoy. It's a wonderful ""gateway drug"" into the farther reaches of the stout universe. And it remains a comforting home to which one might return, from time to time.  M: Creamy, thick, but smooth. I'd call it the Bailey's Irish Cream of beers. It's just TOO good to possibly be healthy.  O: What can I say, I love a good Guinness. As much as I enjoy the bottled variety, I've had enough of this on tap to know it's even better live.

Haven't had a Guinness in a long time so I decided that it was time for a sampling and review.  Probably one of the best pours out there. Pours a beautiful dark tan, thick like chocolate milk. Settles into a deep (almost) black with a thick, two finger, creamy tan head. Almost completely opaque... held it up to the light and couldn't see anything through it.  A dark chocolately/caramel malt scent with light smokey undertones.  Not as bitter as I like them, but tastes good. Not an overwhelming amount of malt and not too smokey, although the scent definitely carries through to the flavor. Honestly, not really bitter at all... but not bad.  Quite a bit more watery than I expected. Still quite a bit thicker than most beers, but doesn't feel as thick as it looks. Refreshing and smooth finish.  Very good actually.

The head decreases quickly, but a small part of it remained through the entire sampling. It has nice lacing. Overall it has an inviting appearance.  S: It has a malty aroma, which is pleasant. The roasted influence is also there, but not a strong as I would like. There is also a slightly sweet scent, like some sort of bread, which I like. Overall, it has a nice aroma to it, but could be stronger.  T: The roasted flavors come out more in the taste. There is also a good malty character to it. The slightly sweet bread aroma translates to the taste also. It is pleasantly astringent on the finish, with a bit of the roasted flavor lingering for a minute or so. Overall, taste mirrors the scent pretty closely, and is well balanced.  Mf: The body is light for the style, and I think it does detract from the beer. The carbonation is moderate and proper for this beer.  Overall: This was a pretty good beer. The taste was my favorite part. The scent was pretty good, but needs to be a bit stronger. A heavier mouthfeel would make this beer seem bolder and more substantial. Overall though I'm happy I tried it. I'll probably buy it again.

The proper Guinness pour is the stuff of legend. That deep ruby hue and frothy head is the beer equivalent to that famous Farrah Fawcett poster. Every boy's dream.  S: The smell is also extremely satisfying. You get a sense of all the coffee and chocolate notes and its the ultimate preparation for what you're about to dive into.  T: Guinness tastes great. I find it to be an overwhelming barrage of flavors such as the aforementioned coffee and chocolate. Some people like a less dominant flavor in their beers and thus don't care for Guinness. There's nothing wrong with that but for those who like some kick Guinness is simply top notch.  M: The mouthfeel is something I find to be completely unique to Guinness. For a flavor with such tang, the beer is surprisingly smooth and full.  Overalll: Guinness is simply a 5-Star brew that I'll likely never say no to. I order one at least one any night I go out drinking. I've heard the North American Guinness is inferior to the genuine Irish product, and that what we get is actually Guinness ""Essence"" that is mixed somehow with inferior base ingredients. Even assuming this is true, we have not gotten the shaft. Guinness on draft is still the beer to beat.

A: Tan, creamy head of 2 fingers sits on a black beer. There's a little bit of clarity revealing brown-red highlight on the edges of the glass. The head has good retention and lacing.  S: Clean aromas feature toasted malts, dark bread and chocolate.  T: Taste is pretty much all of roasted barley, that has a kind of burnt character which is a bit harsh, as in the bitterness of coffee.  M: Body is light-to-medium and carbonation seems low, possibly due to the nitrogen content. Finish is dry, with the roasted coffee flavors lingering.  O: Overall an OK beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,cmq103,3.16,"Poured from a Pub Draught can into a Duvel Belgian Tulip glass.  Appearance: Nice dark black pour with a healthy 3/4"" foamy beige head. Excellent lacing as the glass emptied. I really do love the way the beer cascades after the pour. Not quite the same as a nitro-tap, but not bad coming from a can. After having the draft, can and bottle version, the draft is by far the superior of the three, followed by the nitro can, then the bottle. This beer must be poured into a glass to enjoy.  Smell: Light chocolate, caramel, malty aroma with a hint of vanilla.  Taste: A watered down mild, moderately sweet chocolate, caramel beverage. Lacks the taste and finesse of a true stout. Very mild flavor. Once would think that this beer would be heavy by the dark appearance, but oh contraire...  Mouthfeel: Thin and watery, yet still able to grasp a mild creamy texture. Very light, if not almost non-existent, carbonation. Light body for sure. There is no denying this is a 4.2% ABV dry Irish Stout.  Overall: A decent session beer for the mild stout lovers. I could easily have a half a dozen of these in a sitting without worrying about the ABV since it is so low. I would much rather have a Guinness before any of the other mass-marketed light beers out there.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,FUNKPhD,3.48,"Guinness is a staple, its been around for hundreds of years, everyone needs to try it.  The proper dispensing of Guinness is a rather lengthy process compared to most other beers you get from a tap. Once you get it and have it in front of you, you have a good looking beer, and it seems evident why its been brewed for so long. Nice creamy head goes well with the dark body. That said, the smell and taste are about the same creamy, malty coffee taste. Unfortunately, something seems to be missing with Guinness, body. As dark as this beer is, its like water in my mouth. I would have appreciated more of a presence.  All in all, if you don't want Budweiser, or Coors Light, or Miller Lite, this is definitely a welcome beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,theRooster90,3.56,"Guinness was the first beer I had outside of the norm or Bud light etc.  A: Dark with a very thick caramel creamy looking head.  S: Malt, molasses, coffee  T: Not as much carb as I had hoped but not horrible. Not a whole lot of flavor going on here but hints of chocolate, malt, and coffee.  M: Again, little carb, creamy yet light.  O: Sessionable to an extent. A good choice at a bar that doesn't have anything other than B/C/AB",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,mocktm,3.41,"Guinness is without a doubt one of the beers that really got me into beer. I started drinking it in high school, sipping it down while most of my buddies were gulping Millers and PBR. While I don't really ever buy it now, having discovered much heartier and tastier stouts, I'll pretty much always still be a fan. Review based on a nitro-pour from Buckley's lat night.  Pour is black, but if you look really closely, you can pick out some red highlights around the edges, meaning this black is really a deep dark brown. Beige colored and incredibly creamy head as always.  The smell is really not impressive, excessively subtle malt presence, giving off the slightest hints of chocolate. Almost smells like chalk.  Taste is just as bland, watered down malt chocolate with hints of bitter coffee. Flavors are barely detectable, especially at the temperatures that this usually gets served.  Creamy in consistency and slightly chewy, but for a stout, this is pretty light. My friends who know nothing about beer seem amazed that I can drink four of these ""thick and heavy beers.""  I'm not sure which has changed, me or this beer, but its probably both. My fond memories of this brew don't draw it in such a bland and watery light. I'm really disappointed this took such a nose dive in the quality department, but I suppose its good to have at bars that have no better options.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

I like the color, since it remind me of red wines.  S: It smells like carbonated-chocolate, not good smell.  T: It tastes bitter and watery. It is horrible. I rather drink water than it.  M: I really don't know how to say it, but it tastes like bitter medicine which my mom used to force me to drink when I was a kid. It is horrible.  O: The worst beer I have ever encountered. I have signed up here because I want to write a review of this horrible beer.  There is only little tiny beer taste to this stout. It doesn't taste something more than bitter, and is similar to Chinese medicine with straight ingredients. I tried to like it, but since I have already tried 4 cans and I can't even finish 25% of them. I have no choice but to hate it.  The last bad beer I tried is Budweiser, King of Beer; although bad, I can still manage to finish the whole can.

MF: smooth, light body, and a bit dry on the end.

Not much for the head, but I would fault the pour for that. Fantastic lacing.  S - Mainly roasted malt, with a touch of cream and milk to it. Almost nothing at first due to it being served too cold. As it warms I can detect espresso, slight milk-chocolate sweetness and a lot of black licorice.  T - Again, mostly roasted malt with a strong cappuccino flavor as well. Milk chocolate is also detectable, and it finishes with a light bitterness from the roasted malt.  M - Little carbonation, with a creamy, yet thin body.  D - A classic. Always good, but probably could have been served a bit better tonight. When everything else on tap is fizzy and yellow, I know what I'm getting.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Guinness Draught smells fairly thin, w/ roasted malt, a hint of chocolate and bitter coffee. Taste is even thinner, w/ the same flavor as the nose profile.

Cheers.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

S: There is some mild chocolate and earthy hops. Not much else going on here. Rather unimpressive.  T: Starts and ends the same way from beginning to end. Some chocolate, burnt coffee, vanilla and roasted barley. Not overly complex but with a decent amount of flavors.  M: Slightly slick and creamy. Not as dry on the palate as expected.  O: This is a decent representation of the style. It is better on tap then from the can. Not my first choice of brew for this style, but it is somewhat enjoyable in a pinch.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Pintofbrown,3.26,"Via a cursory glance of the Guinness website one thing becomes clear: they are the totalitarian beer of the stout world. Without batting an eye, the people of Guinness will tell you exactly how to pour, fawn over, and drink their product.  Although a fledgling beer geek with little in the way of experience with breweries or beer in general, this sailed right past reverence of one’s own product and dry docked at cultish following. Which I suppose is justifiable since Guinness was once supposed to be established as a “cult” brand to increase sales.  Well Guinness, I am going to play the V to your totalitarian regime and give your product the 5th of November in June it rightly deserves.  Appearance: Okay Guinness…So far, I’m buying into your propaganda. The effect of the nitrous pour is pretty fantastic. Watching the bubbles froth and tumble under the swelling head is reminiscent of a rolling thunder head. Definitely makes me want to drink this dark, ruby beauty.  Although, those ruby highlights peeking through the edges of the glass quickly disappear behind the dominating black coffee body. After the fifteen second thunder storm, the head has sustained a thick, two – finger, ashy, off white head. I could cut this thing with a knife. Nice!  Smell: Not much here, it seems the truth is starting to outshine the initial flashiness. Even after getting down to almost nose - in - foam level, there is just the slightest hint of toasted malt. Maybe, MAYBE a hint of dark coffee in there, this is weak. Such an intimidating look needs a stronger nose.  Taste: It’s a rather underwhelming experience on the palate. For those who are only used to standard 4 tap, macro brew fare, it will definitely be a change of pace, but outside of that, there is very little to get excited about. A few quick sips give a stronger impression of the toasted malt. The swallow brought the bitterness of the beer to the forefront and also presented coffee and vanilla notes.  There’s also a musty note to the flavor as I sip, that earthy ground coffee flavor. Overall though, it’s a quick trip from burnt malt to a bitter lingering. The bitterness isn’t overpowering, but it sits on the tongue for awhile after the drink. Not necessarily a bad thing, but doesn’t add to the experience either.  Mouthfeel: It is certainly not as, well, stout, as it should be. You expect a full, chewy mouth to finish on a beer like this, but it’s a medium to thin finish. Not very dry either.  Overall: Guinness is by no means a bad beer, but it definitely doesn’t deserve the cult status and reverence that Guinness would make you believe it does. Everything about this beer is on the weak side. It’s like the brewery had an okay to solid stout recipe and decided to water it down, a heinous crime to say the least.  This baby just begs for a nose and flavor that matches the imposing and impressive look of the beer. Without any back bone, at best, it’s a beer you could turn to after you’ve had some of the stouts that are worthy of the reverence that Guiness wishes it deserved.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Has an aroma of camp fire and evaporated milk.  T A rush of burnt malts hits my palate, more burnt then roasted, but not in a bad way. The second notes are a smooth but sour dextrose, like heavy cream, but lighter. The finish is an after taste of chestnut and pecan.  M very smooth and silky, very dextrose feeling. Goes down like a great stout should. Head stays around the duration of the drink, so you get a nice smooth caress on your upper lip.  O: The quiticential stout.

Pours black as night with one finger of head that gradually grows to two as bubbles settle out of the liquid. This puffy tan head lasts for most of the drink. Love the way this stuff looks but the smell has always seemed boring to me; roasted malts with a bit of chocolate.  Taste is of bready, burnt roasted malts without much to support it. Starts off a bit sweet but finishes dry; I've always appreciated this balance. Slightly bitter aftertaste. Ridiculously smooth mouthfeel, like silk. Light-medium bodied with very little carbonation.  I used to think this was one of the finest beers ever but I think my tastes have shifted slightly. I'd certainly never turn one down, but it just seems a little...flat. One note flavour, but if roasted malts and nitro smoothness are your thing, this delivers.  [Updated Dec. 13 2013]  From notes; on-tap at Paddy Flaherty's on Dec. 7th - I hadn't had it in a few years so why not? Guinness seems to be the sort of beer that people either really love or vehemently hate, but I fall somewhere between the extremes. It's not a masterpiece, but it goes down smoothly and quickly.

Truly a dishwater flavor with a little more salt than I like in my dishwater. Watery is the word. Faint medicinal smell. Sloshy froth of nitro does nothing for it. Pours in three parts-- brownish beer topped by a gray layer, and then a beige head.  What is going on with this? Maybe I got the product from Guinness Somalia instead. Barely drinkable. Air has more flavor. Water tastes better. At least water doesn't have this terrible metallic aftertaste. Probably what a dung beetle would use to wash the dust down his little throat.

Slight taste of coffee and roasted grains with citrus having a clear presence.  Not a lot going on in the nose or taste. But hey after all it is a session beer & a dry stout.

Thick and creamy head that settles to a 1/2 inch thick foam that does not go away. Completely blankets the glass in foam.  The main thing you can smell here is the roasted character, namely coffee. Very mild herbal hop.  Flavor is generally roasted, coffee, charcoal and roasted nut flavors come to mind. Herbal hop flavors tickle the tongue with a teasing level of bitterness. Creamy finish.  Light-bodied almost to the point of being watery. It's amazing though how many people think this is a thick beer simply because it is dark and has more flavor than light beer. I know for a fact it's lighter than most lagers because it sits on top in any black-and-tan. Just about zero carbonation. Nothing interesting here.  As far as Irish dry's go, this stuff is just ok. It does not even come close to something with flavor and texture like Guinness Extra Stout. Probably still the best draught style Irish dry out there.

The smell is light and malty. There is a slight smokiness to it that is quite appealing and also a hint of chocolate syrup, but overall the aroma is faint.  The taste is very mild compared to what i remember. It has some faint toasted maltiness along with some faint smoky coffee. The aftertaste is slightly bitter and burnt.

Slightly toasty but this beer really smells like sweet water until it warms up quite a bit and the malt notes emerge.  Medium bodied with a creamy texture from the nitro. I'm usually not a fan of this characteristic because it's really artificial but it somehow works with Guinness. Again, as in the aroma, the beer is really boring and watery until it warms a bit. Too often this beer is served at 35 degrees and loses all of it's flavor. When it warms it's pretty nice with a decent amour of dry, roasted malt. Hints of chocolate, toffee, nut and caramel complimented by the creamy lactic feel/flavor. Dry finish.

After drinking many other stouts out there, I can see why people consider this stout-lite, and perhaps deservedly so. Well, whatever, I still love this drink and it's available mostly everywhere.

My review is not based on this particular tasting however it is one of the first beers I tried and the one that got me turned on to beer as prior to, the beers of the college ranks had turned me off to them.  The beer is black but some light still gets through. The milky, brownish head leaves a lacing and remains for much of the experience. The aroma is of roasted malt which certainly becomes much more apparent with the tasting. Caramel malts as well as a chocolate taste is appreciated as well. The mouth feel is smooth with medium body.  Overall this is a very good beer. I think it is best tasting on tap. I will often order this beer when out as it is one of the few regulars at multiple places I frequent on the weekends.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,FosterJM,3.06,"588th Review on BA Draft to pint @Hennessys SD (Gas lamp)  This was poured by an Irish exchange student in an Irish Pub in SD.  App- One of the original cascading stouts out there. Layers upon layers of bubbles slide down the glass until a nice one and half finger head was formed. Sticky lace all the way down the glass.  Smell- Very grainy with very little else behind it. Maybe some chocolate? It was a bit one dimensional. Still smelled good just not large or filling on the nose.  Taste- Its a dry irish stout. Like the nose, a little one dimensional with a bit of creaminess behind it and some grain.  Mouth- Not at all what I remembered with it being like a meal. Its was modestly medium and medium carbonated.  Drink- When you first get into craft you have a Guinness. Its a better than average beer but one dimensional and a little bitter. Ill probably have it again. Who can say no to an irish car bomb?",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,tjkinate,2.93,"Hadn't had a Guinness in a while and decided to give it another whirl at the bar last night. What can I say, it just seems average to me. I didn't get that rush of flavors you find with so many of the other stout offerings. I can’t believe I used to think of this beer as heavy! Well, for me I guess this beer will just stay the requirement for an Irish car bomb and not for regular consumption.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,DoubleSimcoe,2.66,"My first nitro-bottle! Curious about the serving type... have had a nitro-can before (Young's Double Chocolate Stout) and enjoyed it very much.  This Guinness is -unlike most of the Guinness products you'll find in the US- brewed in St James's Gate and not in Canada.  Appearance: Classic nitro pour, but not as impressive as on draft or as the Young's can I had, with the super creamy head and exuberant foam. This is much more mellow, with only one finger of head and not a lot of lacing. Head does remain throughout, though, as expected. Color is black and then some, coal mine in Wales.  Smell: Underwhelming. Powdered milk, some mildly bitter coffee and vague roastiness, plus a nice sugar touch.  Taste: Mostly water, with a much-appreciated soft bitterness all around the mouth and... that's about it. Some molasses/simple syrup. Oddly enough, a tad of honey and burning paper at the very end, which adds about the only real point of excitement here.  Mouthfeel: Blah.Easily the saddest Guinness I've ever had. It's got none of the great creamy-smoothness you expect. Watery, thin, doesn't feel nitro.  Overall: Of course, it drinks great. But it is way too boring. Also, I do not understand why the brewery says to ""serve extra cold""? This beer tastes better when it warms up!  A good choice if you're at a bar that has nothing else of note. Of all the Guinness versions I have tried, though, this is probably the less appealing. I would skip the nitro-bottle and go for a glass bottle, can or -best of all- draft.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

S: Smells like malty chocolate. A pleasant but simple smell with no depth.  T: Simple chocolate with a hint of fruit and no malt.  M: Watery feel, finely carbonated. The carbonation comes across as perfect but it's definitely a tad weak.  O: Very smooth. It goes down quite well and the relatively low ABV makes it easy to drink.

Appearance: That famous look -- dark brown to black, with ruby red notes at the bottom. The head is no more than a finger wide and is light tan and creamy-looking. It doesn't just leave lacing, it leaves curtains!  Smell: Not very aromatic. Dry maltiness, some coffee.  Taste: That is some dry malt! Little bit of coffee and dark chocolate, but the flavors aren't overpowering. Basically no hop bitterness. On-tap, I've tended to get more flavor than from the can here.  Mouthfeel: This is the best part of a Guinness -- and why the nitrogen is so important. It's very, very smooth and heavy. The nitrogen also keeps the carbonation down.  Overall: Not a special beer in terms of unusual flavors, aromas, or appearance, but it's the standard stout for a reason. A solid beer and a safe choice.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Getting some light coffee and bitter-sweet dark chocolate notes as the aroma suggested. Not getting any hops.  M: Althoug heavy and creamy on the palate, this has a light body and carbonation.  O: The first time I had a Guinness I wasn't impress, but I wasn't a beer drinker. Now, a few years and a lot of beers later, I've really come to enjoy this brew.

209,754,woosterbill,3.3,"Half-pint at the pub across the street from the Kernel brewery - the Marquis of something or other.  A: Classic Guinness: black body with ruby highlights and a waterfall of roiling nitrogenation. The creamy finger of foam stays around forever, creating an almost artificial-looking image of beauty. There's just no use denying it: Guinness is gorgeous.  S: What smell? SOme faint hints of roast do show up, but overall it's pretty darn watery, and almost medicinal. Not that appealing.  T: Smooth, inoffensive, and less than memorable. Light coffee, char, and dry roast. Somewhat bitter, astringent finish. Not great, but about what I expect.  M: Thin and yet full of creaminess.  O: I was obsessed with Guinness up until about the age of 19, and it'll always have a bit of nostalgic power over me - there's just something about the feeling of the first sip, when the rich foam sticks to your upper lip, that's is truly moving. I certainly recognize, now, that it's not a great beer by any means (and it didn't seem any better to me in the UK than in the US), but I'll always have a soft spot it - no matter how thin, astringent, and boring it actually may be.

Smell is primarily roasted malt, no hop balance at all, no off aromas but nothing particularly interesting either.  The same can be said about the taste, all roasted malt with no hop presence, it does have a slight coffee like bitterness in the aftertaste but it isn't very good, it does have a very creamy mouthfeel which is the saving grace of this beer, but even that fades fast and soon feels thin once the creaminess effect wears off, does finish somewhat dry so that's right.

S - Didn't really get too much from it if i'm being honest, i got a coffee smell most over any other.  T - A burst of flaver as soon as it's drank, as with the smell a hint of coffee follows from the smell and can be tasted when drinking, Guinness can not be a session drink in all honesty as it lies very heavy on your stomach and can bloat you up very easly, Guinness is to be enjoyed, not to be drunk like most other types of beer.

Maybe some dark-roasted malts. This isn't a beer for the nose.  T. I have to give Guinness credit for still souring some of their stout and blending it (after pasteurisation) with the fresh. I like a stout with a good sour twang to it, but there better ones for sure.  M. Nitrogen. Love it or hate it, it gives beer a super creamy mouthfeel, but only a stout can take what it does to the flavour.  O. There are times, usually on a hot day after eight hours of hard graft, when a pint of Guinness is just what's needed to hit the spot, and it is quite easy to toss one back in short order but I wouldn't want to stay on it all night. Years ago when there weren't so many other good beers around I'd stick to Guinness for the whole session but that's not necessary any more.

I do love the thick head the nitro can pours though  Some people complain about this beer, but it is a great go to beer. I wouldn't expect it to have the same taste as in Ireland or of other craft beers. I rate this beer high because I like to always have some around and never don't want to have one. I do like Murphy's slightly better though, sometimes.  As many others have said, Foreign Extra is a lot better but also a lot more expensive. Thats like reviewing a Ford Escort and saying a Mustang is better though....duh.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,binkman,3.62,"Appearance: Nice and dark like it should be, with a thin but fluffy brown-tinged head.  Smell: Toasted malt smell, faintly chocolately and coffe-like.  Taste: Tastes like real draught Guinness, roast and chocolatey with a coffee-like bitterness. Very yummy.  Drinkability: Very drinkable, even if it isn't as creamy as actualy nitro-tap guinness.  Overall, the draught-can isn't bad, but it isnt quite as creamy as the tap-version and can't quite hold up to it. That being said, I feel like Guinness pretty much defines the stout style, all other beers having to distinguish themselves in some way. It's a classic. I just prefer it from the tap.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,always4beer,4.3,"A: Had a particularly nice deep amber, almost coffee color. Had about a 1 finger or more head with a nice tan color and beautiful lace.  S: Not a very strong aroma but could detect some malt hints with a little bit of nuttiness.  T: Had a very full taste. Could taste the roasted aspect and definitely detect the malt flavor. possibly a hint of vanilla.  M: Has a very nice mouthfeel. Has almost a perfect amount of carbonation and goes down smooth. Leaves a distinct aftertaste.  Overall: This was my first experience actually thoroughly tasting this beer and really enjoyed it. it has a good aroma and excellent visual appeal because the head is so lacey and holds so long. The taste didn't disappoint and actually had more flavors than i thought. it went down smooth and finished strong. a very enjoyable beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,IIKaRuII,2.85,"A- C'mon... its a guinness... and i think this is one of the prettiest pouring beers out there. pours a dark coffee color, the head resembles whipped cream and is a khaki half a finger head. great traces of lacing all the way thru to the end.  S- Is faint. very faint. light coffee and dark chocolate. Vanilla slightly. So okay the longer it sits the more the smell comes out in this one. Slight roasted tones in there aswell.  T- Cream. a roasted coffee, with slight chocolate. almost a white chocolate taste at that.  M- Oily at the end which i believe is from the cream. hardly no carbonation, so there is no bite to this one at all.  DO- I'm just not overly impressed with this. I know a true contender for its style. However I think the other stuff guinness has to offer ( foreign extra stout, extra stout, etc... ) has a lot more going for it then this. I have had this on tap and i will say that it makes it much better. But out of a nitro can i think this is much lacking. Now i wont say i didn't enjoy it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Fenris244,3.43,"Had this when I went out to the little river drag strip.  The can looks nice, had the nitro widget in there so I assumed it was made for consumtion straight out of the can, poured a little into my stone RIS glass just to see it. Black with a thick airy looking head, good retention.  Pretty light in aroma, weak coffee and chocolate aromas but really nothing else notable.  Light in flavor as well, light chocolate flavors up front, coffee and a metallic note following the coffee, everything works pretty well but it's not a deep beer or anything.  Light in body, pretty heavy carbonation, slightly creamy.  Over all taste is not this beer strong point but the crazy drinkablility is, it has just enough flavor to be satisfying and the slight creaminess works well, all in all not a bad hot weather day beer",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

S: A faint combination of roasted malts, coffee, and slight nuttiness.  T: Roasted malts up front with undertones of nuts and black coffee in the finish.  M: Very light-bodied, almost a bit watery but the smooth carbonation helps it. The long, bitter finish is as simple and subdued as the initial taste.

Ive had good pints, ok pints, and great pints. this review is for the pint of guinness i got at the 9lb hammer in georgetown seattle. first off the pour was done right, i had to wait a minute half way through for it to settle. this pint is deep black(red hue in the light), with a cream white head two fingers thick. beautiful! 9lb pours the coldest guinness ive had, which i think makes the beers taste fresh and clean. it's creamy, smooth, smoky and balanced. sometimes there's nothing like a guinness... i will say this, i try to stay away from the cans and bottles, on tap is the only way to have to have guinness.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

S: A little bit nutty, a little bit malty, other than that, it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot going on. Maybe a very slight bit of chocolate, but very little, if any.  T: Pretty mild flavors here, a lot of roasted malts and not much else.  M: Never thought I'd say it, but when you let it sit on your tongue for a while, it almost feels a bit watery. Pretty high in the carbonation, but with the rest of the flavor, it works.  O: Overall, it's not a bad beer. Decent for sure, quite drinkable, and not a bad taste, just not particularly memorable.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,MaltsOfGlory,3.66,"Pours a beautiful, creamy, one finger head. I know this is just the work of the nitrogen, but it still looks amazing. The head is the closest to white that I have seen in a long time. And the body is pitch black, nice contrast. The head hangs in there forever as well. As for smell, I mean it smells like a Guinness, it's hard to describe because it's a one of a kind smell and flavor, I'll do my best though. The first smell you get is a sour smell, but it's not nearly as sour as the Guinness extra stout, it's very subtle and by no way off putting. The sour smell is mixed in with a sweet malty smell, maybe a tiny tiny bit of hops in there somewhere, but not much. Like I said, it's a one of a kind taste and smell, you have to have one to know what I'm talking about really, my description really doesn't describe it very well. The smell isn't amazing, because Guinness is not the most amazing beer, but it does smell good, and very smooth. The first thing I notice on the flavor is just a robust feel to the beer, that comes in before an flavor really. I know robust is a term to relate to flavor, but I'm using it with mouthfeel because I can't think of anything else to use. I can't say it's a thick mouthfeel, because it is a very thin beer on the mouth. And I also can't say that it has a robust flavor, because the flavor is very simple. But the beer does have robust characteristics, it's hard to explain, but it just fills you up with flavor and mouthfeel, even though it doesn't have much of either. :P confusing I know. The next thing I notice is just how it glides across the mouth, I mean this thing is so freaking smooth, wow. Yes, it is a little watery, and thin on the mouth, but it is so smooth. On the actual taste: yes you do get that sour flavor, but it is so small, it's hardly noticeable, and you do get a sweetness, and a malt flavor, but they are all mixed together nicely. No flavor is dominant, and no flavor is too present, which is a little disappointing that the flavors aren't more powerful, but I knew they wouldn't be coming into this. I don't really get any hops in this beer, if there are any IBU's to this beer, it's a 2 or 3. Overall, the flavor is very good, it's not impressive, but it's good, smooth, and drinkable. To come back to mouthfeel and drinkability: mouthfeel is good, but thin. Drinkability is very very very good! Overall, it's a Guinness, what else can I say, good beer, not outstanding, but good!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,steveh,4.16,"After all the St. Pat's din has settled, and seeing that I've never reviewed what used to be my beer for every week, I thought I'd take a fresh look at this classic (no matter what the modern beer geek may misinterpret) -- following the Irish Dry Stout style.  Poured from the nitro can into my Guinness imperial pint.  A -- Deep black color in the wide diameter of the glass, ruby-garnet highlights in the narrow base. Thick, creamy, tan head.  S -- Mildly bitter, roasted character up front. Vague coffee and chocolate back. Overall, maybe a bit light in the aroma profile.  T -- Mellow bitter, roasted malt character throughout the front, middle, and end of the flavor profile of this beer. Some vaguely tart or sour characters in the middle, but balanced nicely by the roasted barley.  M -- Soft, smooth, creamy mouthfeel, very nice. Medium bodied.  O -- Overall impressions of this beer are terrific. I'd forgotten just why this was the continuous go-to beer for me back in the mid 90s, but the rich flavor and easy drinking characters of the Draught Stout are terrific.  Make no mistake, as so many do, this is not a Stout to be compared with a Foreign or Extra Stout (let alone an Imperial), this is a style of beer all its own, and well worth consideration.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

S- Pretty weak, but hints of roastiness and bitter chocolate  T-Roasted malt, chocolate, toffee, and vinegar  M- Creamy and smooth, but a little watery  O- A solid beer when I am somewhere with an almost all BMC selection. Enjoyable, but not something I will get if there is anything interesting on tap. I will usually have one on St.Patrick's Day unless Foreign Extra Stout or GL Conway's Irish Ale are available. There are a lot of things I like about this beer especially the appearance and the creaminess of the beer, but overall this beer just does not have enough depth.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

I love the surge the beer has, I love how it looks like chocolate milk while pouring and fades into a very dark brownish black color. It's the smoothest texture with a very nice roasted flavor.

Lacing was spectacular also. Smell was like burnt candy with some coffee notes. Taste and mouthfeel were watery and lacking in anything worthy of note. Overall, thiis is not a drinkable brew. Previously, I had this from a nitro tap and felt the same way.

I did drink one on its own and I've never been a huge fan. Guinness Draught always has a blank taste to me, if that makes any sense. It just tastes like there's something missing, something that didn't make it into the recipe for some reason.  This review is probably not helpful at all but that's the only way I can think of putting it. Also, if you're looking at Beer Advocate there is a very strong possibility you don't need another review of this hugely famous and popular beer.

Dark black color with garnet highlights. Huge creamy white head. Surging carbonation. It's a good looking beer, no doubt. Smell was very mild, mostly cocoa. Taste was fairly bland. Some roasted malt, coffee notes and a hint of chocolate. But just very watered down tasting. Also, the body was very thin for a stout. An easy beer to drink due to it's mildness and low abv, but kind of boring. I would much rather prefer to have this on tap somewhere than out of a bottle again. Flavor and body seems to be better on tap.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Smell - burnt toast, some roasted malts.  Taste - not a whole lot going on. Very light and lacking flavor till the finish, where the faint flavors of guinness come out.  Mouthfeel - medium, hardly any carbonation, kinda chewy. I enjoyed the mouthfeel on this one.  Overall - i wasn't Impressed. I was hoping that it could have competed with the likes of brooklyne BCS, Yeti, etc...but this one let me down. The rocket widget idea is pretty nifty at best.

The head lasted for 5 minutes before it began to dissipate.  Smell - chocolate, malts, coffee, metallic, smoky/roasted notes  Taste & Mouth - The beer has a very low amount of carbonation and most of the taste consists of chocolate, coffee and malts. There are also smoky/burnt notes mixed with a slight metallic flavour. It finishes with malty slightly smoky aftertaste.  Overall - Although not my favourite beer, it definitely is a great beer for the style. I feel like I could drink a whole bunch of these throughout the course of an evening.

209,754,SkunkWorks,2.64,"12 oz bottle poured into a Guinness glass. Its Saint Patrick's Day and this is the obligatory Guinness.  Look: actually, a decent looking beer. The nitro bottle effect is a fairly nice one. Black body with a thin, creamy layer of foam that looks gray with some brown. It retains well but doesn't leave any lacing.  Smell: hmm, nothing here really. A little bit of roastiness but not a whole lot else.  Taste: tastes like watered down Guinness Extra Stout, which some might say is a bad thing but I think it is an improvement, since Guinness Extra Stout is one of my most despised brews. Light roasted malt flavors but none of the potent chocolate or coffee flavors you would expect from a stout. Very light on flavor.  Feel: surprisingly thin, moderately carbonated, and (thankfully) no taste lingers after drinking.  Drink: even though it doesn't impress in any way, it is still a drinkable brew. I even had a second pint. Sorry, fellow beer geeks. I've let you down. Since drinkability is no longer a score, I am bumping the mouthfeel score up from 2.5 to 3.0 to reflect the ease of drinking.  Overall: I really don't like Guinness. Extra Stout is one of my most despised beers. Budweiser may suck but at least it is neutral. Aside from the dirty feeling you get from supporting such an unethical company, it doesn't offend your palate quite so much since its pretty much water. Not so with the macro-ale that is Guinness, which is foul. However, at least they watered it down for me a little bit with Guinness Draught. Cheers!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,doktorhops,3.64,"My goodness my Guinness! It's the beer that started it all for me back when I was 18. Before then beer was Toohey's or Victoria Bitter and tasted like regurgitated vomit (still does for me in regards to VB). I've been holding back on reviewing this since my ancestors are Irish and a piece of me never left Dublin back in 2001 but I feel it's time to be objective and rate this as it should like every other beer.  Poured from a 440ml nitro can into a 568ml Guinness pint glass. Now I want to make one thing clear: Guinness is at it's best when served from a tap, very slightly chilled, in a local pub in Dublin - outside of this, as is the case here, you end up with a shadow of the glory that is Guinness.  A: Deep ruby red body that appears jet black for all intents and purposes. With a 1.5cm white head that leaves rings as it goes down, Guinness has the appearance of a quintessential Irish Stout.  S: It's a very faint smell of roasted chicory, grain and just a hint of caramel.  T: Very much in line with the aroma we have a front note of roasted chicory, the barley comes through mid-palate, and finally some bitter coffee back notes. It's not a big stout for body or flavour though as I've always found it easy to put away a pint in two big gulps.  M: Watery, much more than I remember it to be from years back... I think somewhere along the line in the last 10-12 years the recipe has changed and as a result the mouthfeel has suffered. Very low on the carbonation scale.  D: Still quite easily one of the most drinkable beers on earth. I've had many a nights misspent in Irish pubs during my formative years taking down pint after pint till my wallet was sore and I do not regret a single bit of it. Yes it has changed somehow over the years and isn't as good as it used to be but I still love the ""black stuff"".

Smell is not impressive with watery dark malt and stale coffee. Tastes of roasted malt and watery coffee. Very thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, I wouldn't drink this very often.

Served in a shaker pint glass, the beer arrived near black with an appropriately dense cream head. The head sticks around all the way down the glass and leaves good lace. Coffee and Espresso notes fill the nose, plus a little bit of grass/moss. Lots of roasted malt and coffee flavors make up the flavor. A hint of charcoal is there too. Dry finish. The body is quite light with just the right amount of carbonation. This is the perfect social stout.

The beer has a subtle dark malt sweetness to it, with flavors of dark molasses and caramel, with hints of chocolate. This is quickly followed by bitterness from coffee flavors as well as a slight hop influence. Creamy in mouth, with a smooth body.

T: Like the smell, the taste isn't very strong but has flavors of roasted malts along with some hints of chocolate and coffee. Hints of bitterness are present in the finish. M: It feels light-bodied, creamy and smooth on the palate. There is some dryness in the finish. D: This beer goes down very easily and is very sessionable, especially considering its low alcohol content.

209,754,KYBrewgrass,3.64,"A- 5 This poured a pitch-black color. It has a thick, ultra-smooth foamy off-white one-finger head. It looks very inviting, like dessert. The head remains throughout the drink and laces the edges of the glass with each sip. Active, tiny brown bubbles race upward toward the foam with the slightest movement. Great-looking stout.  S- 3.5 Smells like dark malt and faint chocolate. It has a creaminess to it as well, almost like milk. The scents come together but it isn't as inviting as its appearance.  T- 3.5 Guinness' smell is indicative of its taste. It has a very mild cocoa sweetness that turns to a dry, creamy-taste. There is a metallic aspect in its finish that is not appealing. Maybe this is the can? I've had Guinness on tap plenty, and don't remember this issue, but it's been awhile... I will look for this next time I get the chance.  M- 3 Much the opposite of its appearance, Guinness is actually quite light in body for a stout (medium-light overall), and borderline watery. Granted, it goes down easily, but it doesn't have the creamy or carbonated mouth feel that I wanted and anticipated going in.  D- 4 Despite its shortcomings, Guinness is a faithful choice at many an otherwise limited selection bar and retailer. It is a very drinkable stout and there is a reason it has been around as long as it has. It is a must-try for all beer drinkers young and old.

Taste is smokey, mildly bitter tobacco leaf, some very faint flat beer flavors likely from pasteurization. Jeez, why pasteurize? Anyway, that in fact is probably what kills this beer in the flavor department, but I admit it is still quite smooooth and creamy.

Drinking one now from nitro draft poured into an imperial Guinness pint glass.  A- What I would expect from an Irish Stout. Almost black but when held up to light it reveals a ruby red. Nice head that looks like heavy whipped cream. Great cascade that undulated through the glass as it settled.  S- Lightly roasty with faint bitter chocolate.  T- Watered down lightly roasted coffee, similar to reusing coffee grinds to make a second or third pot, with a touch of creamy caramel.  M- Smooth and light in body. Not what I would expect from a stout but it is an Irish stout and nothing like an American or Scandinavian. Not too sticky on the palate and leaves hints of roasted caramel and chocolate.  D- Very drinkable. With a 4.2abv and light texture it confuses me when people say they don't like dark beer but they start everday with coffee.

When held to the light it is a dark ruby in color, not even close to the black that it appears in a dimly lit bar. One finger meringue like head after the cascade settles.  Smell Very weak nose of roast and malt. Really not much else there.  Taste Nowhere near the full flavor and body you would expect from a dark stout. A bit disappointing in terms of the strength of the flavors. The subdued flavors of coffee, roast and chocolate are barely detectable. Almost like a watered down Foreign Extra. Great flavors just nowhere close to the intensity I would want.  Mouthfeel Thanks to the nitro can there is an amazingly smooth feel with no carbonation bite. However the body is very thin and weak.

209,754,brewballer,3.17,"Guinness is a beer that I can definitely drink a ton of in a sitting, but the nitro-can is probably the worst way of serving it.

It still has nice lace on the side of my glass, but I have yet to pour a Guinness that doesn't Over all this is an average beer in a sup bar container.

Resembles Guinness Extra Stout much more than Daught: Appearance: looks identical to Guinness Extra Stout when poured into a Sam Adams glass. Head is brown with large standard beer CO2 bubbles, nothing like nitrogen draught white frothy head Smell: Subtle Taste: Smooth... but watery and unpronounced compared to bar version Mouthfeel: Worst part of experience. The nitrogen feel of the guinness draught (creaminess) is absent. Resembles a flat ""light beer"" stout feel.  Again, I am a fan of Guinness Draught but the nitro-bottle does not work. Gimick.

Even though this is the stout everyone thinks of when they think of a stout, I would like it to be a little thicker.  Drinkability- Very easy to drink.

We had a lot of fun in college and in the years since. Remember that time I got a free pint glass for every round at that sports bar in Ann Arbor? I still have that collection on my shelf. Good times... And hey, credit where credit is due, you were one of the first to teach me that beer doesn't have to be yellow, fizzy and taste like corn. I'll never forget you for that. But I'm older now, and it's time to move on...  All right...I can see what you're going to say, but before you accuse me of being shallow, you need to know that this has nothing to do with looks. In fact, you're drop-dead gorgeous with your nitro-fueled mocha foam.  It's just... I just...expect more substance from my relationship with a beer now. Man, this is hard... Look, your flavors just aren't as bold as I expect even in the relatively light Dry Irish Stout category. I need more than light chocolate and biscuity malt that quickly fades on the palate. It's as simple as that.  Hey...don't be sad...it's not like we'll never see each other again. We'll hang out at Cubs games or the occasional chain restaurant.

Taste: Nearly flavorless, and I have to concentrate to pull out the same aspects that come in the nose -- slight ground coffee (but not good coffee) and a just a bit of bittersweet chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Blech. Like water. Man, I remember when I was in college thinking that this beer was like bread in a can... Oh how tastes and times have changed.

Slowly cascading coffee tawny head lingers with about 3/4"" foam on top.  Aroma is pretty nonexistent - just a bit of charcoal and sour twang in the background. No hops, maybe a little caramel malt.  Taste is one-dimensionally solid, if that makes sense. What I'm going for is although it is not a layered complexity like Beethoven's 9th symphony, its like a good old standby pop chart classic.

209,754,greenmonstah,3.05,"A - Pouring a Guinness is a real treat. Pouring it into the pint glass, you first see it as a light brown or tan color, then you start to see a dark brown layer start to form at the bottom. The nitro-head starts to build up into an inch of creamy tan, microscopic bubbles as the waves of brown cascade down the sides. It's gorgeous, and the poster child for nitro-can dry stouts (in appearance, that is)  S - That slight roast and odd Guinness sourness is about all you can pick up. It's a very weak nose. A bit of smoke.  T - Only hints of roast, the palate is just so muted as to be barely present. Finish is a slightly dry and soured.  M - Very light in body, making this beer a great session drink. Goes down easier than any other beer I can think of.  D - Goes down oh so easy. One of the most drinkable beers I can think of. If I go to the pub with friends who aren't into big beers, and get one, I'm done with my Guinness before they're halfway into theirs.

209,754,Groomsy,3.17,"*This is a re-review.*  First time I had this was the nitro-tap at a local Buffalo Wild Wings; I didn't really enjoy it, but decided to give it another whirl tonight when I saw the nitro-can pack in my local beer store. 14.9 oz nitro-can poured into a mug in one smooth action, no ""glugging"" here.  Appearance: The cascading action is a beauty to watch. When all is said and done, the beer has a jet black body with hints of red barely penetrating through the body. Thick, creamy two-finger vanilla colored head that sticks around the entire time and leave massive walls of lacing all the way down the glass. Guinness is, in my opinion, the best-looking beer out there.  Smell: Much better than I remember compared to the nitro-tap. This may be due to the fact that the beer was fresh from the can and was at a more proper serving temperature. The nose consists of roasted malt, dark chocolate, and strong hints of burnt coffee along with a very faint backbone of floral hops. The only thing that detracts here are the hints of alcohol and a little bit of sourness. Pretty good overall (except for the sourness), but a little one-dimensional. Typical of a stout, and that's a good thing considering that Guinness is sort of the prototype of stouts.  Taste: Although not worlds better than what I had from the nitro-tap, this is still a pretty good beer. The roasted malt is more apparent on the front of the palate, giving off a very charred and toasted flavor. There are sweeps of black coffee and dark chocolate on the tongue as well, although they're sort of an afterthought and are somewhat watered down and artificial. There's a slight bite of hops and alcohol in the finish which turns into a steely industrial bitterness in the finish. Not bad, but like I said, this is sort of like the foundation of the stout style, not the best of. The Budweiser of stouts. Not terrible but not fantastic; still mostly down my alley for what it is, though.  Mouthfeel: Not as nearly as watery as what I experienced from the nitro-tap. A lot of people call this watery, which certainly rings true to a point, but it still has a little bit of thickness to it. The worst thing about it, however, is the lack of carbonation and ""flatness."" This sort of makes the bitterness from the finish linger that much more on the tongue, and the lasting bitterness in the finish is the worst part of the taste, which carries over into the mouthfeel. Sure, it's quaffable, but not really what I enjoy.  Drinkability: I had a much better experience with this from the can than the nitro-tap, as opposed to most others here. Although it's not mindblowing, it's a pretty solid European macro-brew and has a good reputation for its consistency. Decent flavor and light body makes it pretty drinkable.  Much better than I was expecting, but this isn't definitely isn't something I would consistently go after when there are much better options for cheaper. $9.62 for a 4-pack of cans was almost overkill for me.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Gigan988,3.25,"Guinness used to be one of my favorite beers. I've since moved away from stouts and porters in favor of malty beers with less of a ""burnt"" character. I still enjoy Guinness however, and, although many may disagree, think their recent change to remove the widget from their bottles in favor of adding a more ""standard"" carbonation was an improvement.  A: nothing can top the beauty of Guinness on tap. While my review is for the bottle, the jet black color with beautiful white creamy head is very eye catching.  S: Guinness presents a fairly one dimensional chocolate, burnt aroma which is characteristic of Irish style stouts.  T: Guinness is not bad for a macrobrew. All macrobrews have, in my opinion, the same forefront taste, a sort of cheap metally aspect which can be appreciated if one accepts that for a genuine flavor and for what it is. However, I must split my review in two here, for the ""old"" Guinness with the widget had a darker, more burnt flavor. The newer one is more mild and somewhat easier to drink larger gulps at a time (perhaps this was on purpose by the company to sell more). I think it is pleasant in flavor.  M: The ""old"" Guinness bottles were very smooth and thick in mouthfeel because nitrogen was infused when pressure was relieved and the bottle was opened. The ""new"" Guinness bottles have factory-infused carbonation that feels more like carbon dioxide, and I personally like the change, but I see how others wouldn't  drinkability: good. Not very good but good. When on sale for $10 a 12 pack, it's a good bet to buy. But there are other stouts out there that are better. Some include Sam Adams Cream stout, Murphy's Irish Stout, and O'hara's Irish stout. But Guinness is cheaper so I keep drinking it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It certainly looks impressive.  S: Surprisingly neutral. The strongest smell is roasted grain. Some sweetness, perhaps from the creamy head. I would like more from the smell.  T: Call me crazy, but I just don't think Guinness (Draught) is very good. The creamy head is nice, initially, and there is some yummy chocolate malt, but all this quickly fades in the maintaste, which is thin, weak and weakly bitter. The aftertaste is sour and unpleasant. This beer tastes sort of like carbonated spoilt milk with hops. Not good.  M: The creaminess is nice, the flat, tepid, and dull maintaste is not.  D: I will never understand Guinness's popularity. The draught version is just bad. Way better stouts are all over the place; try one. Easy drinking, perhaps, but it's a chore to finish the pint. Not recommended.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,damndirtyape,3.73,"Served in a shaker pint glass at Kennedy's pub in San Fran.  Appearance: Everything you would expect in a Guinness on tap. Wonderfully dark beer with a dense light tan thick head on tap - moved around to form a tiny shamrock on top. The only drawback was that there was some bubbles stuck on the side of the glass which ruined the nice black color.  Smell: Very faint coffee and chocolate hints along with some toasted/roasted malts. Not much smell at all really.  Taste: Some coffee/chocolate blended flavors ending nicely with a clean bitter and toasted malt finish. Nothing very heavy in flavor, but just right as well. I've been spoiled by stronger tasting stouts which is why I can't rate this one too highly, but really, the taste balances out with everything else this beer has to offer.  Mouthfeel: Light and creamy that goes down very smooth.  Drinkability: Very drinkable - was gone very quickly, but, while I could easily have another, I think this beer would be better with a meal for me anyway, and then I could have another and another.

Thin creamy head (sometimes decorated with cloverleaf if your bartender is gifted).  Slight bitterness on the finish. Creamy mouthfeel. Lots of malt taste.

The smell, nice fresh smell. Call me a girl, but kind of flowery. But a rich kind of roasted smell. Chocolate, coffee bean kind of thing goin' on. Very smooth, creamy, chocolaty taste. A nice bitter roasted after bite. I also think I'm tastin' a lot of hops. Not really sure. But there's something there. Overall great drink while you're sipping and very nice finish. If you like the bitter thing. The feel and drink ability, the head is very nice but overall it feels a little too heavy. But this is my favorite beer. Great with salt and vinegar chips and steak.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Poured a most beautiful cascading tan head until it was dark brown with a solid tan head that stays around for the long-haul. Smell is chocolatety with perhaps a hint of coffee. The mouthfeel is heavy with a strong coffee, light bitterness, and chocolate aroma even before swallowing. It finishes with a solid aftertaste of the same and is very drinkable. Wonderful carbonation and body throughout. Can't go wrong with a Guinness ever!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,KickInTheChalice,2.44,"Poured from a 16 oz. nitro can into a pint glass. Part of a side by side with Extra Stout and Foreign Extra Stout.  Appearance: I am a sucker for the nitro pour - the cascading reminds me of those Guinness commercials from ten years ago that convinced me that drinking Guinness would make me mysterious. After the cascading stops, the beer itself maintains a dark brown color with clear ruby parts with thick, creamy, nitro-induced beige foam on top.  Smell: Such a light aroma, there is just not much here. Charred, roasted malt, and not much else.  Taste: There is a light sweetness that might carry a bit of chocolate or molasses with it, then soft roasted malt and an industrial bitterness as the sip finishes. The finish allows this bitterness to linger.  Mouthfeel: The feel is pretty bad overall. It is creamy, but just incredibly light, and the aqueousness really gets to me. Slightly astringent as the glass wears on as well. Too light to be seriously considered a stout.  Drinkability: No thanks, this is just Guinness + water + the nitro gimmick. Enhances the look and draws from the flavor, not for me.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,patriot76,3.89,"On tap a few hundred times at many bars  A- A beer couldn't possibly look more appetizing than this. A beautiful thick creamy head that retains throughout with lacing that is as good as it gets.  S- Roasted hops and malt are ever present in the nose. Together with the appearance it is one appealing brew.  T- The creamy head is a nice way to start off the taste, then you get the very nice roasted hop flavor that was ever present in the smell. The bitterness that comes in about half way subtley lingers after your sip is done leaving you wanting more.  M- The creamyness of the brew is exceptional. That together with the low carbonation make for a very smooth and drinkable beer.  D- This is a very pleasureable and drinkable beer.

The beer is very dark almost black looking but small bits of light do manage to penetrate.  S: Very malty and creamy. Seems to be very balanced and very powerful. Chocolates and coffees are very present as well.  T: OK this is where Guinness lost me as a fan. It is completely flat. F on the taste.  Overall this is a never again beer for me. I bought a 4-pack of cans and luckily my girlfriend enjoys them. I've only had Guinness twice. Once it was on tap and out of this can and it was flat both times. I'm sure that that's the way it's supposed to be and I'm not a fan. I would like to try out of the bottle but am very skeptical.

209,754,DJED69,3.69,"Guinness is good for you---or so they say. An old time favorite of mine. The nitro cans are great. They are typically very fresh tasting and create that killer Guinness cascade upon pour. Creamy head lasts through the pint (14.9 oz actually). Taste is roasted malt, grain with some dark chocolate and cream notes. It's a delicate beer, not a bruiser as the apperance my suggest. Low alcohol makes them VERY drinkable and super enjoyable. They go down fast. If you have had good Guinness on draft, this is kinda close---seems to be lacking a touch of body, though. A classic. I always welcome a pint of the 'black gold'.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Smells of dark chocolate, coffee (from the dark-roasted barley) and a slight hint of metallic. The feel of this beer is delightful! Very smooth and creamy even though the beer was served pretty cold. Tastes of dark chocolate with a nice bittersweet finish leaving a wet feel on the tongue. I really do enjoy everything about this beer from the appearance to the feel in the mouth. Really quite enjoyable!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,SnowGoon99,3.32,"Serving type: nitro-can into a Stella Artois glass  First of all anyone who doesn't give Guinness Draught a 5 for appearance doesn't know what they're talking about. Probably one of, if not the most, beautiful looking beers in the world. It's jet black with a cascading head from the nitro that is worth buying it right there. Head stays firm the whole way down; there's just no way of getting rid of it. Aromas include some roastiness with hints of toast and chocolate.  Flavors are a little lacking. Roastiness is there but very subdued. There's certainly a creaminess from the nitro but that contributes more to the mouthfeel than the flavor. Just really lacking in complexity and flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty good. Nitro definitely helps and it finishes dry as a dry stout should. Very drinkable though. It goes down smooth and could definitely have a few of these without breaking a sweat.  Overall a roller-coaster of a beer. It looks great and is drinkable but the things you look at in exceptional beers, flavor and aroma, are definitely lacking. I can definitely understand they're trying to reach a broad audience and i think they do so with the Draught.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,PhageLab,3.84,"Served in a standard pint glass.  A - When poured properly, Guinness Draught is stunningly beautiful. Cascading flows ride through the dark brown brew rising up the the thick, creamy head.  S - Roasted barley hits the nose. The aroma is faint and doesn't linger long after the pour. Halfway down you can't really smell anything. It is fairly pleasant while it lasts though.  T - Most people complain that Guinness doesn't really have a flavor. This is partially true. It doesn't have much complexity, or any real defining attribute to the taste, but what is there simply is good. Slightly bitter and creamy, with a hint of dark chocolate.  M - Full bodied, with a dry finish.  D - Highly drinkable I'd say. Not offensive to the palate, this is a great session beer that goes great with dinner, after dinner, or, well, anytime really.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,shand,2.8,"Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a mug.  This beer borders on absolutely black, with a cappuccino coloured head. The head is about one fingers worth, but it retains extremely well. It's a pretty good smelling beer. That is, if you can smell it! There's mostly roasted coffee malts, but also a bit of creaminess, and a bit of chocolate. The problem is, the smell is so faint, I had to struggle to smell it.  The taste, unfortunately, is where Guinness faulters more. The way it looks, you'd expect it to have nice, strong, rich malty flavors. And, it really doesn't. It hits the mouth more like a lager. Water is the predominant flavor. If I focus, I can find some roasted malts in here, but there's really nothing else going on. At least it's nothing offensive. I'd drink this in the dead of summer, it's super refreshing and nothing close to the traditional views of a ""dark"" beer.  However, the mouthfeel and drinkability do a bit to make up for the (lack of) taste. The mouthfeel is super creamy, and goes down the throat very nicely. It honestly could stand to be a bit thicker. It's also very drinkable, I could chug this as fast as I can chug water. This is my first Guinness I've ever had, and it's kind of confusing. All my time drinking almost exclusively dark beer have me equating DARK with LOTS OF FLAVOR. This isn't the case, even the lightest of craft beers have more flavor than this. However, the excellent mouthfeel and drinkability do quite a bit to make up for this. An interesting beer, for sure. I'm very interested in trying this from the nitro-can to see if my experience is different, because this is possibly the only beer I've seen that encourages me to drink it straight from the bottle.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Jadjunk,2.88,"#35. A popular brand amongst one of my friends who considers it amongst one of the greatest things he has ever consumed. I'm gonna see where his opinion comes from in this review. Nitro bottle, I suppose it to be consumed from the bottle, which means I'm breaking a few rules with this review. Whatever.  Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle to a pint glass at room temp.  (Appearance) Pours a 2 1/2 finger depth foamy tan head. Retention is pretty average. Lacing is nice, clings and drags down the glass as I drink the beer. The surface never cleared, leaving a thick sheet of thin foam. Color is very close to black, but some mahogany tones can be seen at the edges. Not any visible carbonation from what I can tell. Not a bad looking beer. 4  (Smell) Smells of creamy cocoa, caramel and nut tones build up the foundation with the malts here. Some very faint floral hops are underneath it all. Aroma is mildly pungent but pleasing. Smells like a friendly but shallow stout. 3.5  (Taste) First up come some mild nutty cocoa tastes. Surprisingly, they're mild and not as sweet as I expected. The beer smells to have a toasted, almost burnt taste which is simply curious. Taste isn't that great, The flavor could be more concentrated in areas and some things can even be reduced. Besides a largely thin taste (watery tasting is a big issue), this beer tastes very smokey and not much else. A very smoky finish drags on for some time after I finish my sip. The finish is also missing something. This beer is far blander than it should be. 2.5  (Mouthfeel) Medium body. Almost no carbonation from what I can tell. The beer is somewhat flat and results in being super smooth and slightly creamy (assisted by the chocolate tones). Again, an issue with the thinness of the taste carries over to the mouthfeel. Watery, thin, weak, flat. Doesn't feel good. 2  (Drinkability) Drinkability is quite average. I don't find myself drinking this very quickly because I'm not really getting into the drink sensation that others may enjoy. The beer is filling for the most part, but the taste and mouthfeel aren't impressive enough to hold my interest and are deterring at times. If one can look past this, a six pack could be easily consumed after relatively little time, but you shouldn't expect to enjoy it much. 3  Verdict: A promising beginning, this beer looks and smells like a winner but takes a sour turn from thereon to create a pretty bland and confusing beer. To those who are into mass produced overpriced dark beers, this may be worth a try. However, beyond the smoky flavor, there was little here to hold my interest. Get in singles or on draft.

It is smooth, but it goes down so quick and easy I don't get to savor it. Nothing left on the palate. Watery finish. I was expecting this to be dry. It really didn't feel like beer.  Drinkability - I can see why a lot of people really like this beer. It's very easy drinking. It was almost gone before I even knew what was going on. The look of this beer was outstanding, but that was the best aspect. I bet one could pound several of these no problem. For me however, the taste and mouthfeel do not make this real drinkable.

209,754,yeahnatenelson,2.1,"Appearance -- Pours a dark chestnut brown hue through which light can easily pass. The nitro widget allows for one finger of the creamiest beige head. Visually, it's hard to gripe.  Smell -- Not a whole lot going on: mineral water, mild roast malt, and some hint of dark fruit and chocolate. It doesn't smell bad as much as it smells like nothing. To close one's eyes and breathe in the aroma of a full Guinness is much like breathing in the aroma of an empty glass.  Taste -- The tastes leaves much to the imagination. Quite watery with minimal flavor. Mineral water, char, faint notes of dark chocolate and prune. Meh.  Mouthfeel -- Thin and watery with, with the gentlest of bubbles. This is the only saving grace of this beer and it's completely due to its container.  Drinkability -- I'd like to think better of Guinness, but it's truly the official BMC stout: watery with minimal flavor or aroma. You can tell something good is trying to eek it's way out of this beer, but to no avail. It's only saving grace - and, truly, the only reason I purchased this - is it's container: the nitro-widget.

It's tame on the palate too, but you've got to love the creaminess of that mouthfeel, although personally there are other nitrogen canned brews that are better, in the style of stouts and other ales.  Guiness Draught is probably lauded more by non-beer heads than it should be and is also probably criticized more by beer heads than it should be. No, compared to a great RIS this doesn't even seem like a stout, but it has some enjoyable attributes: that big creamy head, easy drinker.

209,754,weizenbob,4.01,"14.9 ounce nitro can poured into a perfect pint. Brewed in Dublin. Interestingly, the can gives some basic nutritional information and says that it contains 125 calories per 12 ounces. If I remember correctly, that is the same number of calories in a Sam Adams Light. Hmmmm.  The beer pours tan as that famous Guinness head slowly rises to the top. About a finger-high head crowns this beer and does not go away. I've always loved the visual aesthetic of this beer with its dark hue cleanly divided from its mocha-tinted head. The beer itself is quite dark, though not entirely black. Some light can be seen through the narrow end of the glass displaying a dark-walnut brown. This is one of the coolest looking beers on the planet.  When checked for aroma, the initial impact is a faint creamy, almost marshmallowy scent. From there, roasted malts emerge smelling not unlike black coffee. That's about where it starts and finishes. It's not terribly complex to the nose and it's not overpowering. It's just pleasantly subtle.  As the beer slides under that ever-present head for the first sip, the tongue is greeted by a light malty creaminess with a slight sweetness. I'm picking up a slight fruitiness on the back of my tongue. It finishes with that lovely roasted malt bitterness and just a touch of hops as well. The finish is the dominant flavor and is the taste that Guinness Draught is most noted for. It's kind of a one-trick pony and it's not the most amazing stout on the market but it is somewhat unique. Sometimes less can be more.  The mouthfeel is totally inoffensive if not pleasurable. All of the nitro becomes expended in the creation of that signature head leaving behind a brew that is virtually free of carbonation. The lightness of the brew ensures that it goes down like water. It doesn't wow your mouth or really leave an impression at all. It's particularly good for non-beer drinkers but aficionados will find it to be thin.  There really aren't many beers on the planet that are more drinkable than Guinness Draught. The taste and mouthfeel aren't outstanding, but they aren't offensive either. The brew is light but flavorful for its lightness. And at 4.2% ABV you could drink these all night if you so desired. Many craft drinkers loathe it, but Guinness Draught is a fantastic gateway beer. Call it stout 101.  ---  The Two-Schlitz Scale (see my profile for an explanation) I definitely give two Schlitz about this beer.

Guinness Draught just tastes like brown water when it warms and loses its nitro charge. There's some slight graininess but it really hardly tastes like beer at all. I was very disappointed.  M: Full and creamy when nitrogenated, but soon totally flat and watery.  D: I could drink a lot of these, I suppose, but only because they're watery and unsatisfying and low in alcohol.

I started my pour down the side of the glass and as usual, poured in the middle about halfway through and my oh my. This beer certainly does show up for a party. Brilliantly cascading, the beer slowly but surely builds the head as the tan foam falls into a black abyss, then slowly rises back up to build an incredibly creamy head that lasts the entirety of the beer. As such, the beer also has amazing lacing. A visually impressive performance.  S - Unfortunately, the appearance is pretty much the best characteristic of this beer. The beer smells relatively lifeless. The most profound feature in the nose is simply some roasted barley, some malts, and a faint trace of coffee. Not much else going on in the nose.  T - Similarly, the taste falls off when compared to both the nose and the appearance. Some coffee, some chocolate, hops are pretty much nonexistent. As a consequence of the visually appealing head, the taste suffers as half of the sip of a beer is just creamy foam that adds an unpleasant watery and bland characteristic to the beer.  M - Mouthfeel is surprisingly and not beneficially light and watery. Almost zero carbonation, invisible alcohol, and watery flavor makes the beer feel dull and lifeless on the palate and has almost no aftertaste.  D - Drinkability is moderate. While it's possible to quaff this beer without thinking due to the insanely light body and no alcohol presence, the lack of flavor and awkward mouthfeel doesn't make me want to try.

There's an odd metallic taste I seem to always get on the finish with this one...and there's also a mild but certainly perceptible hop bitterness that finishes the beer out.

This was my first stout and I made the unorthodox (for this site) move of drinking it straight from the nitro-widget equipped 14.9 oz can.  Crack it open and immediately the can foams over in my hand. I'm thinking a glass would have been a good idea afterall... I can't say much for the appearance other than it obviously was super dark in the can peering into it, and the foam that came up looked fantastic. Airy and creamy looking, it is most definitely best admired from a glass. Also noteworthy, the can design itself looks sleek and appealing too.  Putting my nose down to the can I very faintly smell caramel and other sweet top notes, but it's barely there.  The taste is creamy and I was hit with a wave of slightly bitter, black coffee. It seems like some people don't really get the coffee taste as much as chocolate and malts but as a fan of dark roast coffees, that's all I could taste. At a couple points, I kid you not, I forgot I was even drinking beer when I got the rush of the espresso-like aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is, as I see everyone agrees on, thin and watery. More than you would assume it would be if you didn't know. I really wish it was a hardier texture as I feel that it would better match the flavor.  Drinkability is fantastic.

209,754,Bouleboubier,3.22,"The look of an Irish Dry Stout when served via nitro (assuming the system or widget is working properly) cannot be improved upon. The color is nearly invariably uniformly black, with maybe some ruby trimmings. Guinness Draught nails that, naturally. The cascading effect is fully operational here, tan coffee hued head is thick, creamy, and generously high, and the lacing is top notch - in sheeting the glass and with gorgeous, meringue-like consistency. This is as good as it gets. The rest? Well...  Difficult to give this high marks on smell even though, by style and especially if served nitro, dry stouts lack much aromatic punch. As the darn thing warmed up though, not only do we begin to detect some light roasted notes and perhaps a little hop bitterness - which, by comparison to other beers with roasty, bitter aromas, is greatly attenuated - but some actual flavor becomes apparent as well. NOTE: I'd add that the aroma also has some ""watery"" notes. This IS possible. Guinness done did it.  The taste, much like the aroma, is, okay, SEVERELY attenuated - in other words, weak. This plays well into Guinness' hands because they have here a very universally palatable drink, meaning, it fits perfectly into the realm of the thin, watery, nearly tasteless beers adored by millions. I found some roasted bitterness, not so much if any hop presence (again, likely due to the nitro), but that's about it. Goes down quick and dead and sucks what little flavor it has with it. Old black water.  In the grand scheme of great beer, this beer is a joke. For what it is, style-wise or what have you, it's okay, but there are better - Murphy's, for one. If I'm simply trying to deliver alcohol to the system, I'd be bonkers to start pounding this.

Smell: Guinness has a definite malty scent, with hints of coffee, and caramel gently wafting to the nose. The scent is very faint, but if you look for it, its there.  Taste: Coffee, roasted malts, and the taste of hops comes through also at the end. There is also a bit of smokiness to the beer which gives it a very nice edge.

Sadly, what you get there is not what's in the nitro-can.  Appearance- This is the best part about this beer. The appearance is absolutely beautiful. Pouring into a glass, it is nothing but tan bubbles. After a minute or so the black body becomes apparent as the head surfaces. At one and a half minutes the beer is dark black and the head is perfectly creamy and tan. The staple appearance of a good stout.  Smell- Musty with a bit of sour yeasty smell. Not the most pleasant.  Taste- Mainly very malty with a hint of roasted nuts and hops at the end. Not much taste, very basic.  Mouthfeel- Medium body, not too thick but lets you know it is a stout. Must drink very cold.  Drinkability- Guinness is very easy to drink. In Ireland they call it ""magic water"" for a reason. It goes down like water but hits like a stout. After the creamy head touches the upper lip and the tongue meets the beer, it flows. My first Guinness is usually half gone in the first drink.  Conclusion- Nitro-can is much better than most commercial beers. However, it does not hold a candle to the Guinness I had in Ireland. It is more bitter without the taste and smell of the original. Still a good mainstream stout though.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Vdubb86,3.37,"Served in a pint glass  It has a beautiful blackness with the cascading creamy foam and looks absolutely fantastic. However, I've never dissected it before so that's the first problem. I literally smell nothing, I keep trying, but honestly, I can't smell anything. It smells like water. The tastes there is slight, and I can't emphasize the slight enough, burnt malt taste with a cream kicker and the legendary sour that's the only thing separating it from just being a thick tasteless liquid to me. It's nice and creamy, but there is a watered down feel even to that. I could pound these all day, and they aren't too high of an ABV so that's something to go off of. It's not like I'll never have it again, but it's never my first choice anymore. If you've never had Guinness you need to have it at least once in your life, maybe around St. Patrick's day or something. Sláinte!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It's a watered down beer, with some burt malt and coffee/chocolate flavors that are so subtle I may have just imagined them. The mouth feel is far thicker than the beer is, and I'm not sure what the point of this is. You can drink a LOT of this in a night but why on earth would you? It is hard to drink because it doesn't taste good.  This is a light stout and I'm frankly not sure why it's so popular. Sadly beer drinkers think it's a thick heavy dinner beer.  I keep drying this when I'm out expect to discover there's a magical tap that fixes all this beers problems but at the end of the day a beer needs flavor to be good and this beer simply doesn't have any.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It's inoffensive with roasted grains and faint bitterness, but it is just so lacking in intensity. M- Thin, to be sure, with a creamy carbonation level. Just too thin though. D- This is an easy to drink beer. Not as challenging as Extra Stout or similar. Smooth and sessionable, but just lacking the intesnity of flavor.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

There's far better beers out there to drink out of a bottle, can or other container. So, this is a review about the best way to drink Guinness, and that's on tap.  Guinness is and will always be my go-to beer whenever I'm out. Most restaurants will have it on tap, and most of them have bartenders who know how to pour a perfect pint. I love how it transitions from a churning mass of dark brown bubbles into a solid black mass with a good, hearty head.  Smell wise... eh. Nothing to write home about. Or write on BA about.  Guinness tastes perfectly benign, with nothing standing out or exceptionally prominent. There's a slight tinge of bitterness to it, but this is a mass-produced beer for wide consumption-- so there's not going to be anything too dramatic about it.  Mouthfeel is thick and rich. Almost like a beer milkshake.  I judge all other stouts by Guinness-- which sets the bar rather low, I suppose-- but at least this way, it truly distinguishes what's a good stout and what isn't. You've got to try really hard to make a stout *worse* than Guinness.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

One of the first dark beers I ever had, so it holds a special place in my heart for that reason. Since those days, I have found several hundred beers I would pick before this one, but occasionally it's the only thing dark and all flavory on tap at some bars, so that's why I still drink it whilst out and about.  A - Nice and dark, gi-nourmous creamy head that relaxes to a thin layer.  S - Usually not anything more than a simple light coffee smell.  T -Ditto here. Hints of coffee, soft barley taste, pleasantly bitter in a real light way  M - Nothing special. A little dry perhaps, not overly carbonated in feel but it's there.  D - Like I mentioned, it has it's time and place, even though those times and places are fleeting at best.

209,754,Soonami,3.27,"Guinness Draught is the classic dry Irish stout and it used to be a favorite of mine for years, but now that I've been drinking craft beer for a few years, it's obvious to me now that this beer is barely drinkable. I had this again this weekend in New York at the bar at the Hotel Fitzpatrick, an Irish hotel.  The beer was beautiful, jet black with an ample eggshell that softly cascades down the glass. I can never get over how cool this looks. The beer is soft and creamy but without much aroma or taste. It is a little bitter and roasty, but doesn't have the complexity of other dry stouts.

Light brown color with an ocean-wave effect that fades into black and forms two fingers of thick, creamy head that laces the glass like crazy.  Smell: Interestingly, this beer has a rather tart fruity smell - rather out of place for this style. A little bit of malt and hops but these are rather weak.  Taste: Very bland. Some notes of roasted malt and a faint bit of hop bitterness and coffee. Finishes dry as the style would suggest.  Mouthfeel: Completely flat and watery. At least it's smooth I suppose.  Drinkability: It was hard to finish off this entire can. Just not very good at all.  Final Notes: I think Arthur Guinness would be rolling around in his grave to think how modern Guinness has been bastardized like it has.

It may be a bit of a gimmick, but it is a fun show. Once settled, the beer appears almost black, with a bit of reddish-brown glowing around the edges, and a creamiest off-white head layered on top.  The aroma is a let-down compared to the spectacle of the pour, with only a faint aroma of toasted malts and maybe a bit of weak coffee with milk. The flavors are likewise muted but still pleasant, with characteristics of nutty coffee and milk chocolate. The flavor is a mere side-show, however, to the texture that is a big reason this beer is so intriguing. The mouthfeel is like a Brooklyn egg cream in a way, with a light creaminess that is like a watered-down glass of milk and a bit of selzer-like tingle.

Or I am one of the lucky winners of the Guinness CAN that rattles when gently inverted, letting me know that there is a rocket-propelled iron mace inside that will shoot out as soon as the CAN is cracked open. Oh, I do so hope that the latter is true! It's been so boring this summer and I could use a life-threatening injury to spice things up. Let's have a go, shall we?  Oooh, f**ksake, it's taken the top of me head off and I just bought that beanie this afternoon! I want me money reimbursed as I'll have to buy another beanie. Naw, just kiddin'! You lot ...  This looked like the Gulf of Mexico, courtesy of BP, in a glass. It had a finger's worth thick, rich cap of medium-tan head with great retention, capable of hanging around well into the fall. Color was a solid tar-black with zero light-penetration. Thank goodness I don't need to re-cap it because I wouldn't know where to start. Nose had a light milk chocolate sweetness underlain by a mild roastiness, kind of smoky, kind of charcoal. Mouthfeel was silky, creamy, like a dollop of something you might add to your coffee. Speaking of coffee, that was its initial flavour on the tongue. It was then followed by a chocolaty sweetness and then a charcoal bitterness. Finish was dry, more toward the charcoal/smoke taste than the sweetness noted earlier. Great lacing throughout. Hopefully, no peliCANs are nearby ...

The smell is nothing to write home about. It's got a stale, yeasty scent to it. Basically, it smells like a cave. As it warms, there is some chocolate and coffee notes that try to come through, but I might be making up things.  I've always thought Guinness was a highly-overrated beer, and my most recent mug did nothing to dispel that thought. It simply doesn't have much taste. It doesn't taste ""bad,"" but it's really not good either. The only thing that comes to mind is extremely watered down coffee.  It's ok in the mouth, however, because it's a very smooth, creamy beer. There's little bitter and while it's not refreshing, it's just a creamy liquid sloshing around in your mouth.  Due to its creamy mouthfeel and relatively lowish alcohol, you can drink these all night long. Despite the limited taste, it does go down easy.

There were some coffee flavors lingering about and a few hints of chocolate, but for me it was approaching bland. It was on the dry chalky side of pale, but still too watery. From what I was told at the bar, it can make some good Guinness ice cream floats. All in all, it's acceptable.  I only drink this on-tap at bars if it is on special or as an alternative to the BMC products - as Guinness will usually be the only import on-tap at the lower-end of average bars.

209,754,eclaycamp,3.96,"Ah Guinness. Gotta be honest - I've got a soft spot for Guinness. Once upon a time I used to drink nothing but the typical macro swill that was available - Bud, Bud Light, Coors Light, etc. In college I graduated to ""exotic"" beer like Heineken, Fosters, and Grolsch. Then a friend of mine introduced me to Guinness. I had no idea that beer could tasty - my first drink was almost like drinking chocolate milk. From there I graduated to Samuel Smiths, especially their Taddy Porter, and I've branched out quite a bit since then. I've had countless craft beers, but you always remember your first.  Stouts for summer. Why not? While lots of folks are reaching for a pilsner or pale ale, I figured I'd go the opposite direction, drinking some stouts, which I usually prefer to have in the dead of winter.  12 ounce nitro widget bottle. Pours a dark charcoal black with a ful 1/2 head with incredible retention due to the injection of nitrogen. The head just will not go down, and cascades down the side of the glass as you go on. Smells of roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate with that unique Guinness smell that I assume is a byproduct of the nitrogen. One thing that has always amazed me with Guinness is just how quaffable it is - everyone assumes that dark beers are challenging to finish. That's not the case with this beer. It's easy to drink which is probably why I got into it in the first place. The taste gives you lots of roasted and chocolate malt in the background, and the nitrogen lends the beer a nice creaminess. Chocolate milk isn't necessarily the best description - Guinness isn't a milk stout - but perhaps something like Yoo-Hoo is more appropriate. There are some hops there, though they are quite earthy and muted. Fuggles perhaps? The hops lend a nice and lightly bitter finish to the entire affair.

T - Chocolate malts are the strongest flavour, with a little bit of a bitter finish. A metallic flavour lingers, with a strong toffee and irish cream flavour which hang around.  M - I've always found Guinness to have extremely low levels of carbonation compared to other stouts I've had the pleasure of trying. That being said, it's not necessarily a turn-off, and rather, is quite delicious depending on the feel you're in the mood for. It's a unqiue, flat, feel that goes down incredibly smooth.

209,754,jushoppy2beer,2.75,"Well, I should start by admitting that it's not really fair to the Guinness folks to do a review on their bottled product. My very first Guinness was straight out of the tap at a small pub just off Grafton Street, near Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. I thought I had died and gone to heaven, and have had a lot of Guinness since, in a lot of places, a lot of styles. This nitro bottle is actually not bad for a bottled beer, but it's not the same as a real nitro-tapped Guinness fresh from a hopping pub. This beer pours more dark brown than the classic Guinness black. The head is okay, but has a lot of larger bubbles. It does cling well to the glass as you drink it, and the head does carry a lot of the good bitter hops onto your tongue. Otherwise, the beer is just not so great. It has a coffee flavor that is too mellow, and a texture that is a bit too watery -- nothing near as thick and creamy as a ""real"" Guinness. Overall, I think I'll save my Guinness moments for those good pubs that know how to keep it fresh and pour it correctly into a proper imperial pint glass.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Would be OK as an alternative to a cheap lager or other macrobrew, but I think it's a lower-end porter.

209,754,gracebeliever,4.05,"Review from notes. Time elapse from finishing about 15-20 minutes. This beer looks like a good black coffee.. a good thing. Initial head was quite large but diminished to a consistent 1/4inch thickness for the duration. It's color was light tan or off-white. I chunked a bottle in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes to chill it a bit and this might have been a scootch too long. I am therefore forced to try another one tomorrow. Gee Darn!  There was a mild smell of coffee to go with the coffee appearance. Still not a bad thing.  In my pie-hole it was like a ""cold coffee"" feel. A little watered-downish perhaps. I didn't find this disagreeable however. There was a hint of chocolate in the mix as well.  The lacing was minimal on this round. We'll see what transpireth on the morrow.  Overall I find this a very drinkable beer and am pleased with it.  OK this is my addendum..  All of the visual qualities were unchanged on the 2nd beer. With the exception being the head. This time without the beginning of ice crystals the head, though even across the board in terms of thickness, had what I will describe as an iceberg effect: There was more head below the fluid line than above. This eventually disappeared.  I don't know if a food pairng is appropriate here but humor me this once and if incorrect beermail me to let me know.  I had this beer w/ dinner. I certainly gave it a solo tasting prior to eating and all points seemed relatively the same. The good part happened upon eating.  Dark meat chicken cooked in crockpot later pulled from the bone and served mixed with Rice a Roni Broccoli au Gratin rice mix. The chicken cooked down with a dose of poultry seasoning, salt, pepper and garlic salt.  When I finished a bite or two and sent it down the hatch I took a respectable sip of the brew. Ohhhh my God! The flavors which last night I hadn't detected now jumped around and made me very happy. This, to me, seemed an excellent pairng of food with drink.  No lite beer here....

209,754,sluggermatt15,3.38,"I bought a six pack of this wanting to give it a try.  A- Pours a dark brown, almost black, with a small one to two finger head that settles relatively fast. When held up to the light, I could see not much light passed through it; rather opaque. Nice look.  S- Some malts, coffee, dark chocolate.  T- Malty at first, some wateriness, but a little dryness at the end. I can understand it being dry because of its type. If there was more alcohol present and less watery taste, this would score in the 4 range.  M- Not a lot of carbonation; nearly full bodied, but not quite. About average.  D- I wouldn't recommend drinking a lot of these at one sitting. This beer is too dark and dry, in my opinion. Maybe one or two would suffice, so I'll give it average drinkability.  Overall, not bad, I was hoping for better with all the advertising and such Guinness does. This is somewhat comparable to Saranac's Irish Stout, but I liked this one better.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

I used to think that this beer had body before I was able to compare it to some of the great stout beers out there. Now, I consider it to be somewhat on the thin side. Still, this is the kind of beer to enjoy with a meal and not concern yourself too much with the details. Nicely drinkable but it has become a little pedestrian for my taste.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BogeyBob,3.03,"I have been a fan of Guinness on tap for many years, but never could bring myself to try it in the ""nitro- can"". I did try it in a bottle a few years back and found it not worth the trouble. It was lifeless as far as appearance, almost tasting flat. I was recently over a friends house for a party, and one of the guests brought 8 ""nitro cans"" of Guinness over. I have know him for a number of years as a big Guinness fan. I expressed my skepticism, and he encouraged me to try one. I must say, it was much better than the bottle, and better than I expected. There is still no comparison between the rich creaminess of Guinness on tap and any other form, but if you wanted to enjoy a Guinness away from the pub, this is the next best thing.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,elgiacomo,4.51,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2010 Doing a 3-way shootout with Guinness, Murphy's, & Beamish tonight. Let's see who comes out on top.  11.2oz bottle, rocket nitro widget, no freshness date.  Pours black with a one finger+ off-white dense foamy nitro head. Leaves lots and lots of lace and retains well alll the way down the glass. Instead of looking for spots of lacing, one must look for spots of glass through the thick wall of foam. Guinness is lighter in color in both head and body than the other two, but laces better and holds a better looking head.  Aroma is relatively quiet, perhaps due to the thick nitro head. However, Guinness is the strongest and best smelling of the group. Features good roasted malt, coffee and chocolate. That nitro ""smell"" is there too. Aroma is the weakest aspect of these beers.  Guinness also wins the flavor shootout with nice roasted malt, coffee and chocolate. Lightly bitter, lightly sweet, a little milky. Tasty. A lot of folks think this has no flavor, but that is BS. Best tasting 4% ABV beer I've had.  Mouthfeel is wonderful for me as I have a tough time with carbonation...even sodas, etc. The nitrogen is perfect for my palate, ridiculously smooth, creamy, and quaffable. These are the only beers on planet Earth that I could chug. The body on Guinness is lighter than Murphy's & Beamish and is the only real area where the classic lags behind.  Overall this is a great session beer, beautiful appearance, nice flavor, and wonderful mouthfeel. Guinness takes the crown in this little shootout with the best overall apperance, aroma, and flavor.  Original Review April 10, 2007: My favorite simple, sessionable beer. I could drink this every day....very nearly do. Beautiful to look at poured into a glass. A thinner beer than you would think due to how dark it is. Taste is mild and refreshing. Excellent head. A classic and deservedly so. The real key to Guinness for me is the low carbonation. I'm not big on carbonated drinks, rarely drink any soda, and while I'll drink carbonated beer, I greatly prefer Guinness as it is soooo smooth and drinkable. Relatively low alcohol content, but I drink it faster than most beers so its still quite effective. :) Also able to get 12-packs of the bottles for $13.49 nearby (north Georgia). Best price I've seen in my area! The Food Lion next door charges $8.49 for the 6-packs. Ar 7/10, Ap 5/5, T 7/10, P 5/5, O 16/20: 4.0 Score",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,DioS,3.86,"Guinness Draught is the creamy dry stout that I most commonly encounter, and is usually one of the better if not the best beer on tap at pubs with a limited selection of mostly American macro lagers/pils. For this reason I give it special credit--like a trusty friend at low places.  Head is smooth and white while the body very dark though not pitch black. The creaminess from nitro takes a while to settle but ultimately produces a fairly stable foam and fine mouthfeel. There's hardly any smell, maybe a faint smokiness. Clean taste, very light, with only a trace of sweetness. Light coffee and toast throughout. The virtue of this beer lies in the lack of offensive qualities rather than any outstanding taste. The smoothness and lightness make it quaffable.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,vette2006c5r,4.06,"Geinness Draught poured black with a good size head. It has a coffee like smell, but its very weak.

209,754,brewerburgundy,3.04,"14.9oz nitro-can, Sam Adams glass, coding but no decipherable freshness dating. What a rip, I thought I was buying 16oz cans. Buyer beware.  Of course, a lovely cascading latte foam transformed into a see-through ruby brown body covered in super fine fluff. It's hard to tell if there are even individual bubbles, there is just a layer of tan stuck to the glass.  The smells are faint and few; metal and roast are just about it. If I'm generous, there is a little bit of dark fruit or berry.  The nitro mutes what is likely an already muted flavor. A little bit of sweeter malt is flattened by the metallic roasted malt. Moderate bitterness seems to come from the roast and I find some toffee.  How do you think the texture of a nitro stout is? Pretty much as smooth as it gets, that how. Texture is nice, but in my opinion the sacrifice of flavor is not.  This is much like drinking second or third runnings off of the mash of a brew; bitter, almost atringent, and very thin. If I'm going to session, I would prefer a pale ale because this embarrasses stouts with flavor.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Roasted malts dominates its taste, but also reminds me some black chocolate and coffee. Also some fresh grassy hops in the end  M: Light but creamy body, very low carbonation and ABV  D: High.

I love that waterfall effect! Leaves fantastic lacing, everything true to the style here.  Nose is very muted, I pick up some malts and a slight roastiness, but very muted  Taste is lacking, slight roasted flavor, maybe a hint of chocolate, but very bland.  Mouthfeel is velvety, like a stout, no biting carbonation. Way too watery for my liking.  Drinkability is great, though. Low ABV and light flavor makes it easy to pound, not worth the cost, though. IMO, guinness is the most overpriced beer on the market. Should be $6-7 for a sixer, not $9-10!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,maximum12,3,"Once again, what to say about a beer that's been a staple for introducing folks to good beer for a generation or more?  Sampled on tap at a pub just across the street from our hotel on London's Hyde Park (Whiskies?). And I hate to say, that this beer isn't any better close to the source of creation than it is in the states. It's a rather thin, slightly bitter, mediocre stout of a beer. If I may offer a humble suggestion, look to Schell's Irish Stout for one that packs taste into the style.  Decent enough beer, but nothing like I recall it from 20 years ago as a pup in the beer world.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Tastes like it's been intentionally watered down to make a MGD 64 drinker feel like they are branching out.  It literally feels like a glass of water.  This is a truly disappointing stout.

It's a pretty cool concept, and executed well, but with its inability to be poured into a glass, it's pretty bad.

Once it settles the body is a translucent reddish black. Head lasts and laces.  S: For all of that head, the scent is kind of weak. What is there is pleasant enough, malty.  T: Malts are upfront. Hops are there but not real strong. Would like a little more flavor but this is good.  M: Here is where this beer suffers. Thin and watery, which I don't mind in other styles but this is supposed to be a stout. Carbonation is almost nonexistent, guess is all went out with that head (and I've noticed the same thing whether it's been nitro or not).  D: Goes down smooth, you can't deny that. If I'm looking for a session beer, this will more than suffice.  I see a lot of mixed reviews for this beer. Not among the greatest, but I enjoy it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Sweetmambyjamby,3.23,"A- This is one of the coolest looking beers to have on tap. The mocha colored finger head at the top of the glass is beautiful. The lacing left all the way down makes this appear to be a big heavy beer. A very dark brown color.  S- It smells like chocolate malts and is accented by a smokey scent. It smells like it is going to be a very dry beer.  T- Throws me off my chair. This is not what I expected guinness to be. It is light, watery, and unimpressive. The malts are good, and I like the chocolate taste, but the smokiness is lacking and this is too thinned out by water to have anything taste great.  M- Like I said it's very thin. The head is the only creaminess that you're going to get from this. The texture is also chalky and I don't like a chalky watery beer.  D- The low abv is nice, but that is the redeeming factor for drinkability.

209,754,BucBasil,2.91,"Poured from the nitro-can into a pint glass.  A: Appearance is classic Guinness. After pouring, the cascade effect mesmerizes the drinker and eventually creates a beautiful finger thick light tan head that lasts for what seems like forever. The beer is a dark brown with light coming through at the bottom.  S: Smell seems like Guinness, with chocolaty and roasted notes coming through. It's a bit lighter than if it came in a different form, but it's all still there. Creamy, milky cocoa aroma. Classic.  T: Watery at first glance, with little hints of of malt coming though. Finishing with a nice roasted character that doesn't quite compensate for the watery character in the rest of the palate. So water with a roasted bit at the end. Very unlike other forms of Guinness, but still palatable.  F: Very creamy, velvety feeling on the tongue. This is what the nitro can seeks to produce and it hits right on. the body itself however is a bit thin.  D: This was probably altered a bit to get to can form, and although it's drinkable, the lack of flavor just makes me crave a Guinness from the tap. So maybe it did its job in making me want to drink more Guinness, but it fails in that the Guinness I want to drink is not this form of it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

I still do drink Guinness products (see my review of Guinness Extra Stout) but this swill represents everything wrong with mass produced corporatism in beer brewing. Thats my socio-political rant, now on to the review...  Poured into an american pint glass despite the suggestion on the container to drink directly from the bottle. Funk dat!  Pour - beautiful pitch black and thick like strong coffee. Cascading bubbles and a milky grey-white head that takes years to set and years to reduce.  Smell - fantastic coffee combine with a trademark guinness malt.  Taste - %^&!@!@# - what the hell is this crap? no flavor whatsoever. If I was blind and this beer was flat I would think this was some sort of unsweetened chocolate drink thats been sitting open in the fridge. ""Guinness Essence""?!?!?!? Are you freaking kidding me! Bland, unappealing adjuncts, little or no roasted malts, a hint of barley (probably psychosomatic because I want so bad to like this right now). Did they even USE hops? I want my money back...  Mouthfeel - its smooth, its calm, its very safe and it pisses me off. Someone spent alot of time thinking about how to make this appealing to the budweiser and coors lite soaked american palate. The smell is beautiful and classic, the appearance is the same but the taste and body of this thing is a complete farce! Its not bitter - Im the one thats bitter.  Drinkability - its great if you can get passed the populism of it all. Guinness is supposed to be a meal. Its supposed to be an oppurtunity to enjoy a masterful blend of something totally and 100% completely Irish.

D - No reason I'd have another. This was more of an endurance test.  I've come to realize (and this excludes Samuel Adams and the Boston Beer Company) that if a brewery has commercials on cable television - then it's probably a crap brew. Any brewery that markets to it's consumers to drink straight from the bottle - especially a friggen STOUT has a lot of thinking to do.  Put more time into your brew and less time into your marketing.

No. I think it has a great roasty flavor, a little chocolate, with good minerality. Dry as it should be with good flavor.  Mouthfeel: thin, the feel of a Guinness draft, is hard to replicate, head lends some creaminess.  Drinkability: good because it is portable Guinness, I will always prefer the pint at the pub.

209,754,skylab,2.91,Overall this was a good beer but I thought the whole nitro-can thing was a little unnecessary. I found it made the beer flat feeling and a little watery tasting. I know it is supposed to mimic the whole tap experience thing but I find the experience lacking. I much prefer the bottled version if drinking it at home.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Reaper16,2.53,"12oz. nitro-can served into a pint glass  Pours a solid brown, though it is lighter when held to direct light. The can does an admirably job of approximating the cascading effect that you get to see when drinking a Guinness on nitro-tap. Some bubbles do move upwards and downwards and the head looks great for half of a minute before it settles on a tiny, thin cap that sticks around for the whole drink.  Some roasted barley aroma slowly works its way out of the pint glass and up into my nose. Light flourishes of coffee and Hershey's milk chocolate and an off-putting twang of something metallic. Pretty average stout aroma.  This can, too is very watery tasting. That is the dominant perception of Guinness for me -- watery. The chocolate malt flavors are so sapped of their intensity that they are rendered a weakened mess. This is like drinking an old, poorly-made cup of coffee.  The mouthfeel is not sufficient. The nitro in this can only provides a glimmer of the creamy qualities that a nitro-tap pint of Guinness has. So you get no carbonation but almost none of the benefits of nitro to make up for it. That means that the beer is watery and unsatisfying. Below-average. As far as drinkability goes, I'd rate it to be average given that the flavors here are nothing to write home about. This beer's best use may be as a compliment to vanilla ice cream (but even then there are beers, like Young's Double Chocolate Stout, that are better suited for that task).  I tried two types of Guinness on the night that I took the notes that would become the review that you are reading now: nitro-bottle and nitro-can. Both are below-average beers at best. The nitro-bottle version is flat-out awful. Avoid it at all costs. I found the nitro-can version to be an upgrade, but still the beer is below par. There are much better examples of the Irish Dry Stout style; there is probably a delicious version made right in your neck of the woods, dear reader.

209,754,NA1NSXR,3.49,"Appearance - This beer is certainly a looker. Poured in the the glass there was a cascading flow of sinking nitro which rises again to form a nice creamy tan head. You can get a strong light through its dark appearance and its lacing its picturesque.  Smell - Smells sweet and slightly roasted, with floral/perfume like aroma as well.  Taste - Lightly flavored of roasted malts. Its quite alright but light for the style. Not really any bitterness. I wish there was more taste though.  Mouthfeel - The silkiness of the nitro carbonation is great, but its not backed up by the beer, which is thin and watery. The combined effect is that it drinks as if it was flat. The beer itself needs to be thicker to complement the nitro and its smoothening effect. The way it stands now there is no need for this beer to be any smoother as it is already watery.  Drinkability - For all its faults this is still a very drinkable beer. I think overall it works better in a complementary role with a meal or something better than it stands on its own.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,NefariousR,3.42,"Poured from a 14.9oz. nitro-can into a tulip pint glass.  A - No matter what your opinion on Guinness, there's no denying that it puts on quite a show. The effect of CO2 cascading down the sides of the glass as a wonderfully creamy, off-white head forms on top of the brew is mesmerizing every time. The beer itself is an incredibly dark ruby, nearly black.  S - Malty sweetness, and not much else. I can't help but think that the thick, nitrogenated head prevents all the aromas of the beer from coming forth.  T - Malt, with just a hint of roast bite and a slight breadiness. There's a slightly bitter aftertaste.  M - Thin, yet creamy. Barely any carbonation is noticeable, partly due to the masking effect of the nitrogen. A bit on the watery side.  D - This was my first beer, and while I have since moved onto greener pastures, this still holds a special place. No, it's not the best beer in the word -- not even the best in its category (try O'Hara's or Murphy's), but the fact that it's so widely available and ubiquitous insures that it remains a staple of mine.

209,754,Spiekerbox,2.59,"A- Dark-brown, black color with small frothy head that lingers for a while.  S- Not very strong, typical coffee/chocolate/roasted dark malt smell but does not make itself stand out from other stouts.  T- What taste? Flavor reminds me most of water then of the stout that I wish was all there. I am a fan of big dark stouts, but this unfortunately does not qualify for me.  M- This is what I would expect of a beer of this type. Thick and full bodied beer with a smooth drinking experience.  D- Possibly a good session beer but I would personally not prefer it, nevertheless is a beer that can be drank all night",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

I've always loved how this beer looks after the pour, when it has finished cascading. Superb on appearance. Smell is slightly smokey malts. Some cream and winter spices as well. Taste is again slightly smokey malts up front, becoming a bit watery as it progresses. Finish is fairly lackluster, with little to note save some faint malts. Mouthfeel is smooth, with a medium-light body. Low carbonaton. Easy enough to drink, but I'd put a two can limit on this one.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

When I want a very interesting and complex beer, I'll go for a microbrew craft. But Guinness satiates my (daily) craving for stout amply.  LOOKS: Great lacing, nitro can has nice cascade in glass  SMELL: Nothing special about the smell, but also nothing bad  TASTE: Hey, quit saying this stuff doesn't taste good. It does! One of the smoother beers out there, goes right down the throat with its bready coca-cola goodness.  FEEL: Thick and pleasant texture.

Stouts can't look any better.  Smells like...nothing. Maybe a lil' lactic sour, a lil' bit roasty but I think I'm just projecting the way I remember Guinness rather than what I really smell. Tastes like a watered down Irish stout. To me Guinness has always been more about mouthfeel than actual flavor and this just proves my point.  My least favorite of the big 3 Irish stouts.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

That nitro really adds to the appearance. Hopefully, the taste isn't affected too much.  Smell: Chocolaty and coffee-ish. Pretty typical stout territory here.  Taste: The flavor is honestly a little light here. I'm worried that the nitro might be adversely affecting the flavor here. I've encountered this before with other beers from nitro-cans, so it wasn't completely unexpected. What flavor is here is pretty much typical stout territory. Roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee flavors pretty much dominate this beer.  Mouthfeel: This beer is pretty smooth and reasonably full-bodied.  Drinkability: This beer is pretty drinkable and I'd certainly have it again. I am worried about the effects of the nitro but it doesn't really take away from the drinkability.

S - Subtle aromas of roasted barley and coffee, nothing too strong.  T - Follows the nose with the roasted notes of barley and coffee.  M - Medium to light body, low carbonation, smooth mouthfeel going down, perhaps a bit watery. Nice clean, dry finish.  D - Spot on for style.

M: Water-like liquid mixes with the airy head to coat one's mouth like none other beer  D: For me near perfection...I perfect everyday beer...I love my ipa's and lagers but I will always have a special place in my heart for Guinness,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,PDXHops,2.32,"14.9 oz can, poured into a Guinness pint glass.  How odd that Guinness chooses not to produce an actual pint-sized can (like Murphy's)- it's weird pouring the beer into its branded glassware and not filling it all the way to the top. Anyway, the can does a pretty fair job at replicating the classic tap pour. The cascading's not as pretty, the head isn't dense and incredibly creamy, the lacing's not as impressive. Having said all that, it's still a fine-looking brew.  Smells and tastes like what started as a very good stout, but has been diluted. The aromas are pretty weak, nothing but a bit of burnt malt and a hint of sourness. What little roasted malt character exists to be savored is drowned out by an almost comically watery mouthfeel.  Is this seriously the same beverage that was my gateway into good beer drinking back in 1995? A poor example of the style, although I've been known to tip back a few for old times' sake now and then.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It was served to me already settled with no cascading effect. Maybe the nitrogen is turned down. Not exactly sure how that works. Still had a big creamy head that sticks to the sides like crazy. Smell? Not much to report. A little bit of roasted grain, maybe. Taste? Much of the same. What happened? Did they water this down? I can't believe that my palate evolved that much in only a year or two that a beer that I once loved now tastes so bland. Either way, I'm less than impressed.

Guinness is always impressive to look at when it poured properly from a tap.  Smells of roasted malt, toast, coffee and faint yeast. Basically it's an all malt aroma.  Tastes of roasted malt, light hops, caramel, some burnt wood, coffee, grains and it has hint of hop bitterness. Taste is dominated by the malts, which is very nice with a fine combo of roasted and chocolate malts.  Mouthfeel is extremely creamy, with very, very light carbonation; this beer goes down like a milkshake with a dry bitter finish.  A tasty classic that is best on tap, but good from the can and bottle. Guinness is always known as the standard for stouts, and while I find this beer extremely drinkable and always enjoyable, the reality is that the taste is only average.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The smell is nothing remarkable, a bit toasty/roasted, but no strong aromas.  The taste is roasted, with bitter cocoa, and coffee. A slight acidic bite on the finish. The feel is a bit thin, it is a drinkable beer.  Overall, as much as I want to like this beer as much as I did when I first had it, it just does not seem the same as I remember. It's like a bland, dull version of what I knew.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The typical ultra smooth, creamy head erupts and remains at least a half-finger high until finished. Pasteurized and filtered, the liquid emerging after the foaming subsides is quite clean with a very dark ruby-red color.  Flavor is somewhat thin and watery in the mouth with just a hint of malt and hops, especially compared to the Guinness Extra Stout poured next to it, as an experiment in Irish imbibing on this St. Patrick's day. The bottle text urging ""serve extra cold"" and ""drink straight from the bottle"", is a tip off that this brew is aimed at the mass market, not true beer hounds.  Yes, it's drinkable, but not nearly as much so as the Extra Stout, which, even though this one was brewed in Canada, is at least a head above the Irish-brewed Draught.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The taste is delicate as well with just a little bit of roast and weak coffee. Slight mineral, rust like flavor. Bitterness is solid for such a thin beer. All the flavors taste a bit thin, even for a dry stout.  The mouthfeel is slightly watery and thin with a very dry finish. The nitro head creates a creamy sensation with each sip. The carbonation is very low. Overall, it's a bit lifeless, but I'm usually not a fan of nitro pours. Drinkability is the main feature of this beer.

The head is compact and about an inch high just before the dissipation starts, wait a minute - what dissipation? The head stays as long as there is beer left in the glass.  S: Roasted malt, almost a bit burnt. Strong dark coffee together with dark dried fruits.  T: Sweet roasted malt together with a dry bitter taste like from strong coffee.

The cans are somehow 14.9 ounces, but priced more expensive than other pints. I'm just not sure the ""nitro can"" idea really works. The thin, flat character of this brew is pretty unacceptable.

T: Bittersweet roasted malt with some burnt and acrid flavors. Some ashy flavors and a touch of sour milk. Hops may add to the bitterness too as this finishes bitter.  M: Creamy, smooth mediuml body with it's signature widget to provide a nitro carbonation.  D: This is an old classic. It may be overrated and or over worshipped by some but it does have its place as an easy drinking full bodied beer.

Translucent brown/black with ruby hues. Sticky and creamy light tan head. Aroma is of acidic, burnt malts and the faintest earthy hops.  Flavor is pretty tangy and and somewhat bitter-- more so from the roasted character than any true hoppiness. Lingering flavor is charred chocolately malt. Somewhat harsh. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, thanks to the nitro widget. Drinkability is good. It's so light, yet flavorful.  People say that Guinness is the standard for the Irish Stout style. And in this case, the standard is utterly average, when had from the can. Cano-a-cano, Murphy's blows this stuff out of the water. Much smoother, less harsh, but with all the flavor.

The taste hints at some roastiness with a slightly bitter finish. The taste is on the lighter side but still pretty good.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very creamy.

I'll always have a place in my heart for a well-poured Guinness on draught, but today I'll give the can a whirl.  The widget system works alright, but I feel that a lot of carbonation is lost in the panicked first moment once the beer and gas starts rushing out. I attempted the standard three pour system, and I got something resembling a Guinness, but looks a little flat. Still, a good creamy head, lots of sheeted lacing, that standard dark black-ruby colour.  The nose is pretty close: dark coffee, espresso, dark malts, etc. Bitter finish. Pretty close to the on tap stuff. A slight fishy or mercury taste to it that I'm not terribly fond of, however.  The taste is that of on-draught, albeit with a strong chalky flavour that I can't seem to shake. It's close, but it isn't quite there.  The mouthfeel is velvety and creamy, a bit watery, but slightly chalky, sticking to the tongue.  Stick with it on draught - the can is certainly drinkable, but you're drinking a shadow of the original form.

209,754,dacrza1,3.04,"Situation: unwinding for a long-overdue Guinness review... Glassware: Guinness tulip... Appearance: A show--an instant 5. the off-white layer of milky, creamy head leveling over cascading brown, mixing with a blackened base presents like few other beers I know... Aroma: lactic, milky tones that hint at chocolate, and dough; for an ale, incredibly light scents... tough to discern... Palate: light-bodied, soft and smooth to the point of mellow gold--impossible NOT to quaff at a rapid pace, and that is no punishment... dry at the finish, with only minimal aftertaste... Taste: although not as complex as some other Irish stouts I have had, the sweet lactic flavor is clean and lip-smacking--in addition, consistent too... a bit of brine and toasted oats gives a bit of dimension... Overall: having had the draught poured ""correctly"" in England and Scotland, I can honestly the difference in the widgeted bottle isn’t palpable to me--the reliability and drinkability make this a great partner to any number of activities. Recognizable branding and availability make this also a winner for convenience’s sake...unfortunately, comparable to a number of other dry stouts (ahem, Murphy's?) and thus, not as memorable as originally thought...",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,beer2day,3.51,"Dark, dark, dark brown with the accustomed 2-finger light cream head dense enough to float a quarter. Excellent retention and lacing. My Irish relatives tell me that the goal in drinking a pint is to leave only three rings on the glass, taking just four ""sips"" to down the beer. I'll drink this one just a little slower.  Nose seems weaker than the true draft version. Weak, sweet malt and heavy cream come through but that is about it. No roast or chocolate to speak of.  Very smooth and creamy up front. Slightly tinny bite in the finish, but not much more going on. Starting to discern a faint roast toffee/coffe flavor in the finish mid glass, but not much there at all. Again, true draft version is far better.  Nice creamy feel.  Very easy to drink. Not much taste here, so I'm not sure I'd want more than one, but nothing offensive in the drinkability either.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Smells of thick roasted grains, and malty sweet smoothness.  The taste is a delicious roasty flavor. Not terribly complex, and a bit watery for a stout in my opinion, but not a bad beer. The nitrogen gives it the creamy impression of body, but this beer is very light tasting. Slight bitterness from the roasted qualities. Easy-drinking.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Sheets of lacing coat the glass as a nice skim settles in.  S: Unfortunately, the aroma and taste of Guinness don't hold up compared to the better stouts. The nose is composed of a light creamy milk chocolate, and soft roasted malts. Everything is relatively muted and muddled though.  T: More of the same in the flavor profile. Milk chocolate, roasted malts and a slightly sour-milk component in the back end.  M: Medium bodied with a velvety smooth and creamy feel.  D: The nostalgia of Guinness being the first beer I ever had is tough to beat, but I've had way too many beers since then to really rate Guinness high.

T- What ever flavor this has is watered down. Some hints of coffee, and something sour.  M- Thin, watery, with a chalky milk of magnesia finish.

Thick, marshmallow head that looks like it could be placed on top of any dessert. This is what I'm talking about.  S: Yikes, the only positive is the burnt bread, but the rest is metallic and bland.  T: Looks can be deceiving I guess. Flavor exhibited the burnt/toasted flavor, with an overtone of bitterness. Looks so silky smooth, but just doesnt taste it. I waited for a hint of sweetness, but it never arrived. Quite disappointing.  M/D: So thin, so dry, just disappointing.

There isn't much to the smell, only small bits of oats, malts, coffee, and sugar, all very faint. The taste delivers a solid amount of dark grains, with phases of milkiness and that trademark Guinness half-sour at the back.

Nothing bad in the flavor, but nothing to commend it either.  Mouthfeel is OK, thicker than it tastes & certainly it has that creamy character that comes from the nitro-tap.

Its a very bland beer with flavors so subtle that it makes it hard to appreciate the craft that most likely went into originally making this beer.  Theres a slight hint of oak and maybe something that resembles coffee with a head so thick and messy its almost impossible to pour let alone drink but once you manage to pour the beer the head fades away to practically nothing.

Roasty, with some chocolate and espresso notes, followed by a dry, bitter finish. I just cannot get into this beer, no matter how many times I try it, and how many different formats of it I try.  M: Light. Almost too light for the style. Flavor is there, then gone.  D: Nitrogen does work wonders for beer at times, but not here.

Smell: Smell of roasted malts, chocolate, hops and coffee not quite as pungent as an extra stout but still very pleasant.  Taste: Not a whole lot really. It is almost bland but it it not offensive. You can pick up the slight coffee notes and chocalate notes in the after taste.  Mouthfeel: VELVETY smooth! It goes down like honey and it feels very clean and refreshing on the pallete. medium light body with almost no carbonation to speak of also sort of watery  Drinkability: I can put down an 8 pack over a night and still want more.

Poured into a pint glass the actual pour is a thing of beauty, the carbonation is mesmerizing. It settles into such a contrast between the black liquid and the creamy top.

A beautiful shade of black with that iconic creamy head. Beers don't look better than this.  A nice smell of dark roasted malt contains some nuances of coffee and cream. Great smell.

209,754,crnipeter,1.06,"During my college years beer drinkers that could be seen in bars locally could be classified into several types: consumers of crappy domestic beers, flocks of corona drinking females , imported lager consuming douchebags full of themselves and themselves full of shit and atop of all were fake beer-aristocrats, the Guinness devotees claiming »I drink only good beer« (Common myth was that Guinness has such a dense head that a coin put on wouldn't sink). Guinness is my favorite brewery too, in a negative way. It seems to be suffering from reversed Midas syndrome as everything they touch turns into crap instead of gold as I haven't came accross with decent product of theirs yet. Now I'm tasting their Draught from some morbid curiosity and I'm not disappointed - Guinness never fails to justify my low expectations. Guinness Draught is an excellent example of what happens when Marketing Department gets more founds than Research & Quality Control. To the beer: Can with best before date 13.08.2010. The pouring into tulip reveals rather opaque dark muddy brown fluid topped with ¼ of inch thin firm beige head that lasts. Apart from light acidic sourness and quite imperceptible alcohol nothing else is detected, maybe just a hint of bitter chocolate. Where is the coffee like aroma of burnt barley /barley malt so typical of a stout? Dominant flavor of this slush is acidic sourness derived from cereal roasting accompanied by unpleasant bitterness of charred organic matter. Now, I'd expect at least a decent coffee finish but that's probably to much to ask of a Guinness. All in all the flavor profile is of bone-charcoal decomposing in water. The body is watery - probably a desperate attempt to enhance the drinkability - with zero carbonation. The above written refers to sampling from a tulip, directly from the can everything was even worse. »Serve extra cold« - of course I will, cuz anesthetizing the tastebuds by freeze is the only way to at least to some degree hide the crappish character of this beer. Ironically, there is even a quality warrant signature of Arth Guinness on the can, the same way as there is a central-bank governor 's name printed on banknotes assuring their authenticity and stability of the monetary system. Finaly: What is this - a sort of bizarre experiment how much crappishness can be bottled/canned and people will still be drinking it? This brew hits the absolute zero on quality scale. He (Guinness) has gone where no one else has gone before.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The head laces very well.  S: Sweet light grains, a bit of dark roasted malt, and something like the slightest essence of fruit.  T: Fairly singular taste, mostly darkly roasted (sometimes nearly burnt) barley and something a bit sweet. Maybe like over-roasted coffee. Almost no hop presence and little maltyness.  M: Velvety smooth from the nitrogen adjunct, and overall very thin.  D: Extremely drinkable because of light body, however it does not fill you up as a stout should.  Overall: If this beer is being rated as a traditional stout it falls far short, but I believe that Guinness Draught from a can is not meant at all to taste like a normal stout, but instead like a can of nitro Guinness. This makes rating difficult because I am not sure what to compare it to. I think people either love Guinness for what it is, or disdain it because it is not a typical stout. Take your pick. Personally, I love this beer because of its interesting and rich history, and because of the marketing involved. It is packaged beautifully and looks simply wonderful in a glass. So it is watery?

My tastes have changed since then, but I still like it. Poured it into a Tulip style pint glass it has a nice looking nitro effect to it while being poured. The bubbles slowly work their way to the top. Whether or not you're a fan of Guinness I feel everyone should agree atleast that it's a good looking beer. A few years ago I would have rated the taste and smell so much higher, but pretty average now. It's generously malted, very sweet with hints of chocolate and coffee. When let back down to room temperature you can slightly smell the hop but you really have to look for it. In the taste it's also difficult to pick up on the hop, it does have a slight bitterness to it. It's nothing too high in quality but well blended. The mouthfeel is pretty good, for a stout it does feel a bit watered down for a stout. It's very drinkable, no matter what the occasion.

T: Not too much better than the nose. A bit of roasted malt flavor and maybe a touch of chocolate and coffee, but overall it's very bland.  M: I do enjoy the creamy feel the nitro gives. Unfortunately, it seems to (have helped to) kill the rest of the beer.  D: This is really disappointing.

You can watch as everything gradually settles with a perfect looking head on top--white and about 2-finger width. The head is resiliant. Not much lacing going on as the stout is consumed. The nearly black color of the beer contrasts nicely with the head.  S: Pleasent toasted malt smell, slight hints of chocolate and perhaps milk? Smell is generally somewhat muted.  T: This presents an overall solid taste. Nothing jumps out at me, but it is an overall respectible stout. Toasted malt, slight taste of vanilla? Hard to really peg it as I mentioned--nothing really stands out. A small amount of milk chocolate/coffee action there as well.  M: Not quite as thick as I look for in a stout. Very smooth otherwise. Nothing out of the ordinary going on here.  D: Definitely the easiest drinking stout I have ever come across.

Smell is very weak. Taste is not terrible, with hints of chocolate and coffee. Light bitterness predominiates. The mouthfeel has always been a little thin for my liking, as I prefer my stouts a little more creamy/chewy. Even low ABV stout as the one could benefit from a rich mouthfeel. Drinkability is decent, but in my experience you'll feel 'full' long before you feel a buzz.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

S- not much here,and it is weak. Coffee malts and thats about it. On draft the smell can be more robust and in your face.  T- more like a coffee drink with some whipped cream on top. I like coffee and i like beer so when you put them together i am happy.Not as flavorful as some of the other micros though.  M- creamy and smooth. No hard times in getting it down as i remember in college.  D- nice heavy stout. It goes down smoother than most and easy to throw it down.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,DrDoitchbig,3.35,"I haven't had Guinness in over a year and it's been quite the year of craft exploration. I was really curious as to how my palate has changed.  Appearance: Just as I remember, Guinness is one of the best looking beers I've ever seen. The upward cascade of nitrogen bubbles is a sight to behold. Once the process is complete you're left looking at a beer that looks like it's straight out of promotional material. It's picture perfect, the edge between the head and the beer itself looks like it was drawn on with a ruler. Speaking of the head there was about two fingers worth and it stuck around for the duration leaving some quality lacing. The beer itself is black at first glace, but mahogany tones come through when any light hits.  Smell: Disappointment here, I remember this being more robust. I guess my nose has sniffed the likes of one too many Russian Imperials. Faint smells of coffee and roasted malt along with an overall impression of sweetness.  Taste: Following the smell, much sweeter than I remember. It almost reminds me of a latte. Sweetened coffee and roasted malts. There's a little bit of chocolate in there as well. To think I used to find Guinness quite bitter.  Mouthfeel: Thanks to the nitro this it's just as smooth and creamy as I remember. Probably another reason it reminds me of a latte. If the body was a bit more full this would have been perfect.  Drinkability: Despite my changed palate I still enjoy Guinness. It certainly goes down easy. It's rather pedestrian, but I won't be neglecting it for a year again. Once in awhile I'll put a few back for old time's sake.  Overall Guinness isn't the Grade A beer I remember it being. But I still think it's worthy. I love the whole event of pouring a pint of it. If it wasn't for the appearance and mouthfeel I think this would be the same as any other middle of the road stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,kidhatesyou,4.41,"Poured into an official Guinness pint glass  Appearance - Pouring one of these is just lovely. Way better than the Guinness Extra Stout (which I still like) Pitch black, thick, frothy lacing which lasted through the whole tasting, those beautiful bubbles while pouring... GENIUS!  Smell - Roasted. That's all I can say, really. Malty, coffee-like, with a hint of nutty sweetness at the end.  Taste - Wow! The head really becomes important here. You taste it with your first and last sip. Coffee is definitely prevalent. Then you get some sweetness in the back of the tongue. There is so much head though, which I love.  Mouth-feel - For all the flavor there, I'm surprised how thin this beer is. It is very enjoyable though. I got a little bit of the head on my whiskers and could smell it for a while, which I rather enjoyed.  Drinkability - I would say ""Go for it!"" If you like the taste and aroma. If you are Irish, nothing beats a nice Guinness. If they had it on tap here, I would probably drink it all day. In fact, I had it on tap not too far from here before, and it was delicious.  Overall, I say give it a try. It is one of the most famous beers, and that's for a reason.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

M: Medium body with a thicker mouthfeel from the lack of any appreciable carbonation.  D: On its own, I wouldn't say this beer is overly drinkable, but, as a mixer I'm a huge fan, which is the main reason I keep them around the house. When mixed with other beers or cider, Guinness can't be beat.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

D: It is drinkable, but I would probably go to the corner store and pick up another brew.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

S: Smell is average at best. Some burnt coffee bean is all I'm getting.  T: A little bitter and watery. Taste certainly doesn't match the appearance.  M: Solid. A bit thinner than I would have liked, though.  D: Very drinkable, as far as stouts go, owing to it's slightly watered-down profile. Guinness gets a bad rap from all the beer snobs on here, but for a macro, it's decent.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,robobor,2.98,"The first time I tried Guinness I was 14 (it was just a sip) and I was surprised at how unlike any of the other beers I had ever ""just sipped"" it was. It seemed so strong in taste that I was amazed he could drink the whole pint. I only mention that because whenever I drink Guinness now, I am surprised at how mild it tastes and easy it is to drink.  Another point I think is worth mentioning is that the packaging recommends serving extra cold. I'm reviewing it now straight out of the fridge and there is very little aroma of any kind coming out of the glass. The body is dark, but clear and watery. The head is foamy and sits about a centimeter thick, leaving a foamy lace as the level recedes. There are very weak dark malt flavors and a bitter end at the back of the tongue. At the very bottom of the glass there's a nice coffee aroma that I expect from a stout. Just a hint, unfortunately.  Mentioning Guinness seems to elicit a response from most people, but canned Guinness Draught leaves something to be desired. I would much rather take the Extra Stout, especially the lovely Foreign Extra I enjoyed so in Jamaica.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It is very minimal overall though.  taste-is not what i expected from the smell. Watery and sewage tasting, with the slightest hint of coffee that i smelled initially. Expecting a rich creamy taste, it was thoroughly disappointing.  mouthfeel-watery, not very carbonated for a beer.  drinkability-If I downed one of these it'll be an accomplishment. Someone will be getting an early christmas gift (ie, the other 5 in the pack)",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,heissebier,2.74,"Poured into a sidel from the nitro can. Makes an interesting poping sound when you open the lid.  Appearance- Pours incredibly creamy, almost chocolate milk like in appearance. Creamy tan head the persists and coats the side of the glass with creamy foam. Pours unlike any beer I have ever seen.  Smell- Roasty stout smells including chocolate and coffee but not very much aroma overall.  Taste- After the wonderful appearance, the taste was throughly disappointing. It is semi-sweet and watery. There are some stout like flavors lurking in there, especially in the aftertaste but the taste just feels muted in general.  Mouthfeel- Watery and with almost no carbonation remaining, I guess it all went to preserving the beautiful head. Probably the weakest aspect of this beer.  Drinkability- I wish I could pour these all day. After that, its all downhill. I appreciate the effort that went into developing the nitro-can but the beer itself is lackluster. I don't mind drinking these at all, but for $6 for a four pack, a total dud.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Whiteweasel,2.44,"Poured from a nitro-can in to a seidel.  Appearance: Wow. Gahhh. What a beautiful beer. The widget gives it an incredible head right out of the can. When i popped the can open the carbonation shot out. Pouring it was like pouring rich, creamy chocolate milk. It settles in the glass with a creamy brownish white head that persists for ages and carbonation swirling around in the most beautiful pattern, as if this beer was alive. Once that settles, a deep, dark brown colour takes over that is almost opaque, save for around the sides. Head is small but very creamy and stays around forever.  Smell: Has the distinctive Guinness scent to it. Bitter with coffee notes. Pleasing to the nose, but still a very weak scent; thats the tradeoff with the nitro-can  Taste: Sadly tastes a little like stout flavoured water...Coffee taste is there, but no real taste of chocolate or anything else. Almost a superficial taste. Has the Guinness taste down, but otherwise is pretty hollow.  Mouthfeel: Kinda bad...this beer puts so much effort into looking beautiful that it loses all of its carbonation. So literally its like stout flavoured water...Not a nice mouthfeel. The creaminess of the head could potentially save it if there was more head to speak of  Drinkability: Probably wouldnt have more than one or two since the carbonation thing is killing me. Otherwise its not horrible  Overall I could sum it up best by saying: All bark, no bite",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

There's nothing like a nice cold Guinness in a large pint glass in the early afternoon. Dark, and coffee like, but smooth at the same time. The froth holds a lot of flavor, creamy color (looks nice with the dark beer), and thick. Let's just say this was my beer of choice that whole week. I enjoy this in a glass anytime. Dry stout, annd refreshing. Nice buzz, nice taste, nice smell, nice look, real enjoyability for a darker popular beer. It's my new go-to!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,drabmuh,4.02,"""My goodness, my Guinness!""  Beer served on nitro-tap at some sports bar. I've had this beer so many times, reviewing it seems odd, but here I go. It is also one of the most popular beers and recognizable, what could I possibly say about that hasn't already been said.  Beer is dark black / brown. Nitrogenation cascades inside of the beer, forming these iterative and repetitive waves of tiny brown bubbles that are pushed down on the edge of the glass to be pushed back up in the center of the beer, forming a tight, creamy head of tiny tiny bubbles. Lacing is about as high as it can be. The glass is completely coated in bubbles as I drink the beer down.  Beer has a subtle aroma of roast and sweetness. The head almost protects the aroma from detection, but as you drink it you can definitely smell a lot of sweetness and some malt.  Beer is smooth, one of the smoothest creamiest beers I've ever drank. Drinkability is high. This is a really sessionable beer. I could drink this all night long. There is mild bitterness and some nice subtle roast character. Some chocolate like flavors and a great medium body. Drinkability is high and mouthfeel is good.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

What gives it the the nice tang is the soured beer that is added to it. I recently am on a hiatus from drinking stouts but this was my staple for a cheap good tasting stout when I started leaving the coors and the other light beers.

It's almost pitch black, but not quite. I really love how Guinness has brought draft beer to a can!  N: Dark malts, a little chocolate malt, some creamy aromas, dark spices, nitrous aromas, a little roasted malt aroma as well.  T: Very creamy, nitrous up the wazoo. Some light chocolate and roasted malts. A slight sweet malt. Mostly creamy bitter charred malt flavors. Slight fruity flavors as well.  M: Very creamy, semi thick, lots of nitrous carbonation.

209,754,advill88,3.21,"Appearance is black with a creamy tan head, the texture and appearance of which always reminds me of meringue of some sort.  Smell is fairly faint with hints of roasted malt...hard to distinguish the individual characteristics.  Taste is a lot more watery than I feel a stout should be, with the same faint hints of maltiness, a bit of sourness, and a vague sweetness lingering in the background.  Mouthfeel is, again, much lighter than a stout should be, but it's somewhat redeemed by a wonderful creamy smoothness that helps give the beer a good drinkability.  This really isn't quite the Guinness that I remember loving so much from tastes when I was younger...maybe its because I've had better stouts since then. It's not a horrible beer by any means, but it's just not something to get particularly excited over, and it's on the bland side.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Nearly pitch black body with creamy khaki colored head. As always, good retention, minimal lacing however. Smell is of burnt grains, dark coffee beans, sliglty nutty and hints of brown sugar. Taste is of faint dark, slightly burnt grains and coffee. Hints of chocolate, nuts, molasses and some funky sour-like thing going on (note: was amazed to come on and read so many reviews describing this quality, i did not remeber this at all last time i had a pint). Nitro gives it a creamy (once percieved as thick) light/medium body which works well with this beer.

S: Roasted Coffee with hint of chocolate and maltiness on the back end.  T: creamy smooth coffee up front with a hit of chocolate.  M: light-creamy, slightly sweet with carbonation...too light if you are used to the extra stout. But still quite pleasant.  I still think this is a great session beer.

Some maybe chocolate light undertones here and there. Nothing else really going on. Just alot of roasted malts coming through and nothing else. Very one sided.  T- Very watery taste right off the bat. Light chocolate upfront with taste but that is stopped with a roasted flavor that sticks through the whole rest of the beer. The flavor like the aroma is just one sided. A watery one sided taste at that!  M- This has a heavy mouthfeel to it. Carbonation is there but not really doing anything for the stout itself. Creamy and watery feeling at the same time....it's weird to explain. Just sits there on the palate and needs a push to help it down. Leaves a roasted taste in the mouth. Mostly clean aftertaste of burnt malts. Nothing more nothing less.  D- This has some drinkability to it. I would be more than happy to kill a couple of pints of this if it is the only thing around to drink. Not my favorite stout by any means but is something I could enjoy with my non-craft friends.  -On a side note I remember the first time I had Guinness I just turned 21 and caught the Cramps play in Chicago at the Vic. I had like 5 of them because that's all I saw people drinking. Then I found out they also served Old Style. I switched to Old Style....bad idea. It was 85 degrees in there and I was wearing a leather jacket. Upon going outside I went on the Red Line and on the Chicago Street exit I blew Old Stlye and Guinness over the cement and bench in front of me. People just stepped over it like it wasn't a big deal.

Initially a pleasant, weak, yeasty smell of sour-dough bread. Smells like clean air after a strong rain.  Taste - Begins with a sweet feeling like licking the spoon after frosting a cake. Strong stout bitterness of maybe clove and balsamic vinegar. Similar bitter aftertaste that lingers for 2 min.  Mouthfeel - Somewhat watery, with a foam coating around the inside of the mouth.

A: Pours a dark, nearly impenetrable black body with a perfect finger's worth of light tan head. It's exquisite, in the way that all nitro-tap dark beers are: watching the suds coalesce into a dark body as they cascade up the beer is nothing short of eye-pleasing. Tons of thick lacing down the glass as I drink. It's beautiful, and I can't fault anything here.  S: Weak on the nose. It has the roasted barley smell so proudly boasted about on Floor 1 of the tour, with coffee and, lastly, a mild dark chocolate nose. Slightly sour aroma.  T: I expect an Irish Dry Stout to be... well... dry. This features -- weakly -- all the flavors found in the nose, with a watery finish and a lingering coffee bitterness. For a stout, this is barely even acceptable.  M: Super-creamy, owing to the wonders of the nitro-tap. Light-bodied and low in ABV. Pretty inoffensive, although it really should be thicker for a stout. Very strange.  D: I have literally never enjoyed Guinness, and now I think I never will. No point in wasting time and money on it in the future.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Smell is basically a slight roasted coffee.  Taste is much of the same, roasted bitter coffee and malts with a slight hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is creamy yet watery at the same time.

209,754,AmberMan22,3.47,"I've had this just about every way it comes. On Tap, bottle canned... Right now I have it in a nitro can, bought in Paris. Poured into a tulip glass.  I don't care what the overall sentiment for Guinness is, the appearance is perfectly brilliant. The cascading effect lasts for well over a minute, with a perfectly pitch black color.  The smell is fairly nondescript. A bitter sensation is the immediate reaction, followed by a weak chocolate presence, and then the roasted malt.  Taste is okay. As far as a stout goes, I expect a lot more in terms of anything -- roasted malt, chocolate, smokiness, coffee flavor. Certainly all of these are present, but not in any exceptional way.  The mouthfeel is definitely enjoyable, more so on-tap. A syrupy medium+ body shows itself. Sadly not full bodied, but I'll give it credit for originality.  In terms of drinkability, Guinness is a fairly easy drinking stout. The low ABV lends itself to a sessionable beer, and it doesn't seem too imposing. I certainly enjoy Guinness, and while the review may not do it justice, I'll take it over most beers.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

You can smell the roasted malts and a bit of earthy/leafiness, but it's really faint.  Taste.... it's still Guinness, but it's watered down. Something is not right. It's still creamy and stoutlike, but something seems to be missing. Roasted malts and earthyness. slight bitter after taste.  Drinkability is good. Could use a bit more carbonation.

Solid rentention but not a whole lot of lacing to speak of.A: After the nitro bubbles settle, there's a black body and mahogany edges.

Head is thick, rich, and has a high mininiscus over the top of the glass. Nose is very toasted with coffee notes.

Nothing really off putting, nothing enticing either. I guess there is something there you could possibly describe as dark roasted malts with an espresso overture but thats being insanely euphemistic.  There is a bitterness and maltiness and roasty flavour there you wouldn't find in many other beers as common and as easy to find as this one. But that's not saying much. It's not bad tasting, it doesn't leave me gagging like an adjunct lager but theres just no richness in flavour nor any complexity.  Its smooth, its creamy.

209,754,biegaman,2.82,"The cascading visual effect of a Guinness Draught can be considered quite the sight. The seemingly downward path of the bubbles can be attributed to drag; some bubbles stick to the walls of the glass while others in the center quickly rise to the surface. The faster moving bubbles push the surrounding fluid that is near the glass towards the bottom.  And its pouring can be quite the event. Guinness has long advocated that ""good things come to those who wait"" and strictly enforce a lengthy two-step procedure that according to the brewery should take no less than 119.53 seconds.  But the modern dispensing method is relatively simple compared to the original system. In olden days, the glass was first filled with recently brewed stout that was still undergoing secondary fermentation (this would generate a deep foaming head). Once this had settled, the glass was topped up with the beer from an older, longer matured cask.  Today it is pressurized kegs (or cans or bottles) injected with nitrogen that gives this stout its famously thick and creamy head. If you're one who values consistency you'll appreciate that this ensures the exact same head every time regardless of the serving vessel.  Beyond the infamous head, however, Guinness doesn't offer much to look at. Its body is lifelessly opaque, or so it seems away from the light. Closer inspection will reveal the beer to be not entirely black - the brewery considers it a dark shade of ruby. Meh. Maybe.  That I've spent so much time talking about its appearance is surely a testament that it must be the most worthwhile element of the beer (and the main aspect which the brewery has attempted to promote and distinguish the beer). Really, there isn't much else to the it...  Stouts can offer fantastic aromas: roasty, smokey, fruity, chocolaty, wine-like, coffee-like; they can be rich and bittersweet, they can be ambrosial and enticing. This is none of those things. It smells nothing like any of the aforementioned.  The same can be said for the taste which is also void of nearly any character. The widespread perception that Guinness is filling baffles me for two reasons: one, at 4% alcohol with less than 10 grams of carbohydrates and less than 200 calories, a pint of Guinness is in fact one of the lightest (in the literal sense) beers on the market.  Secondly, with almost zero taste of chocolate, coffee, caramel or roasted malts it is (in the figurative sense) one of the lightest stouts again.  Guinness is thought to be creamy - it isn't. Its head is, but little of that makes it into the mouth (as the leftover mounds lining the bottom of the glass will confirm). The beer itself is watery with little bitterness, sweetness or roastiness. It is almost entirely void of texture.  Contrary to their popular and long-standing slogan, Guinness is not ""good for you"". It certainly isn't good for me, anyhow. The world of stout offers far more excitement and experience than this. (That includes the variety of stronger Guinness Foreign Export beers brewed for overseas markets.) Guinness may have set the benchmark for stouts - but they set it really, really low.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Brenden,3.28,"This one's pretty much the same as I've had any other way except that the nitro can really adds some body and smoothness to what, without the nitro effect, is a disappointingly thin and lackluster stout in terms especially of mouthfeel.

209,754,r0nyn,3.91,"On-tap from the Blue Bar in The Algonquin Hotel in New York City.  Poured into the traditional curvy Guinness pint glass. The head is thick and foamy, as is typical of the beer. I love staring into the inky darkness filling the glass; its one of my favorite parts of the entire Guinness experience. The aroma is definitively bitter, with hints of chocolate and coffee.  The taste follows through on the smell, with the chocolate and coffee nuances blending with the natural bitterness of the beer, creating a pleasant flavoring that is easy to roll around and savor. The liquid is thick and creamy, and each sip I took was full-bodied enough to feel like I was drinking a smooth milkshake. The minimal carbonation only serves to accentuate the beer's tastiness.  Guinness has been a staple of my bar-going experiences ever since I've started going to bars. My very first Guinness was from a proper pub in Dublin, Ireland and it was delicious and filling. The pints I've had since here in the United States have not matched my first Guinness adventure, but I suspect that has quite a lot to do with the overall experience I had in Ireland.

Smell is faint of chocolate.  Taste is a very weak watery coffee with some faint burnt? note coming through. Extremely weak bodied beer.  After I tried guinness extra stout and thought it was decent I figured I'd give the draught a try and what a let down it was.

209,754,BeanBone,3.45,"Appearance: Guinness Draught is truly a beautiful thing. Perhaps the prettiest glass of beer I have ever seen, a tulip-shaped pint glass filled with a properly pulled Guinness Draught is as iconic as it gets. It's dark reddish-brown (not quite black), pierced by laser beams of red light, and capped by a creamy tan head. And my god, the bubbles-I could get lost watching the head settle on a pint, it's simply hypnotic.  Aroma: Chocolaty, roasty, and slightly sour malt with a little dark fruit thrown in. It's lacking a bit in intensity, but some of that's probably due to the dense nature of the nitro-head.  Taste: Quite similar to what the nose promised: mild milk chocolate, weak coffee, dark fruit, and sour roasted malt predominate, with a little light bitterness thrown in to help balance everything. There's some metallic iron-like flavors from time to time, but they don't ruin everything. It's not a particularly intense as far as flavor goes, but it gets the job done as a session brew. The aftertaste is roasted malt with mild bitterness.  Mouthfeel: A creamy as hell and amazingly silky medium-light body with smooth carbonation to match. Dries out in the finish.  Drinkability: While it's not exactly my first choice for a hot Summer's day, Guinness is still an amazingly drinkable beer.  Verdict: Chances are, if you're reading this you know exactly what it's like to have a pint of Guinness Draught. Inoffensive and generally uninteresting, yet highly recognizable and iconic, it's quite the paradox.

It has a very faint, simple, roasted malt aroma of coffee. It also tastes of roasted coffee. Acidity in the finish, the roasted flavour lasts into the aftertaste. The roasted character sticks around in the aftertaste. Lace is left sticking to the side of my glass as I drink it. It's a little bit on the thin side, but the dense head and low carbonation in the body still allow it to feel smooth and creamy. It's ok, but I wish it had more body to it.  In some ways, this beer seems both over and under rated at the same time. It's not the meal in a can the average bud light drinker hypes it up to be (which marketers are all to happy to go along with). It also isn't terrible either.

My most recent pour of this was bland and unpleasant. The creaminess was there, along with some of the typical bitterness of a dry stout. However, there was a strange watery feel to the whole experience of this pint. It wasn't extremely cold, but I had a hard time picking up the flavors I used to enjoy.  Once one of my favorite beers, this one has fallen out of favor for me. Perhaps I have been spoiled by some of the fantastic beers I have been drinking lately.

209,754,greengorilla,3.14,"I had this beer from a nitro tap in a pint glass.  The appearance is good, a dark brown to black color with a thick tan head.  There really isn't too much smell to it.  The taste is pretty bland also. I can convince myself that there is a little bit of roasted malt flavor, but not much.  The mouthfeel is a plus, if it weren't for that it would be a pretty bad beer.  Overall, it is drinkable, but only as a last resort if there are no other good options.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Graham5161986,3.67,"Well, first off, the appearance of this beer is likely its best feature. Beautifully black with an oh-so-creamy looking tan head. Retention is legendary and some very nice, thick lacing clings to the glass. The smell emanating from this beer is, unfortunately, somewhat muted. What I am able to discern are subtle notes of bready, buttery malts, chocolate and some coffee. Taste is more pronounced with lots of bread and butter up front with the dark roasted chocolate notes picking up mid-sip resulting in a finish that is roasty with a nice amount of bitterness from the hops. Mouthfeel is thick and very creamy with not a whole lot in terms of noticeable carbonation. This stout goes down smooth. Drinkability is another excellent quality of this beer - I feel like I could drink this stuff till the cows come home. Overall, sometimes nothing goes down like it. It could be more pronounced flavour wise. However, when you're in the mood for a silky-smooth, easy drinking stout, it's hard to beat. Truly a classic - I'd love to try it closer to the source!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,cudmud,3.58,"After pouring into an ale glass, the brew produced a rich, vibrant head that is tan in color. The body of the beer is rich and dark. After the beer settled, about one-half inch of head remained. In addition, a nice layer of lace is clinging to the glass. The aroma is both malty and hoppy. The flavor is both sweet and salty with a nice essence of hops. The beer is creamy and feels very delightful in the mouth. Overall, a wonderful beer and a classic that should be used as benchmark for measuring other stouts.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It's way too watery, no carbonation and no body at all.  D: This beer is just way too watery, it ruins it for me. Flavor and aroma are very subtle, almost bland. This is basically a marco-stout.

I'm hot, tired, ready for a cold pint, something light, and Guinness would supposedly fit the bill. Overall I was disappointed. Appearance is perfect and aroma is very good, but somehow its more watery than I remember. Reading other reviews its obvious I'm not alone in my opinion. Of course considering my last review was of FBS I'm probably expecting too much. Taste is good (pleasant roasted malt bitterness), mouthfeel is silky, but there's a wateriness that dulls both and leads to point deductions. Drinkability is okay but I only had one and switched to SABL.

209,754,SLeffler27,2.81,"Guinness Draught has that familiar and expected dark brown color with a mesmerizing cascading head development to a dense, creamy beige which lingers throughout the session. Lacing is the wrong terminology for the patches of head retained on the walls of this Guinness pint glass.  Roasted malt and molasses with bitter chocolate and some latte aromas are all pleasant although lacking much complexity.  There is significantly less bitterness than I had anticipated and the flavors are extremely light. This is nothing even remotely like what I remember being served on draft years ago. About the only flavor I can detect is some sweet, roasted malt.  A thin body and watery texture combined with soft, almost flat carbonation holds little interest. I had this at a dive bar and thought, ""surely this is is the result of the quality of the bar,"" but alas, the beer maligned the bar. Sad to say, but either my memory failed me here, or I've developed a far more discriminating palate over the years.  Sure, one can idle away the hours while sipping or swigging, but I have no such desire.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,taez555,3.76,"This is specifically a review of the Guinness Draught bottles, since I've already reviewed normal guinness draught numerous times before.  After the cascade, it pours a pitch black body with a thick foamy bright white head.  Nose was very subtle with only touches of dark malt and grain.  Taste is classic Guinness. Dark roasted malts, very light bodied yet big thick and chewy at the same time. A strong dark roasted coffee like bitterness and touches of milk chocolate. Very bready, with a strong brown bread sort of taste.  Gotta say, compared to the Pub Cans with the little widget, or on draft, this bottle version is spot on with the rest. I know it's actually meant to be drunk out of the bottle, and I did take a few swigs and well... it's not as good, but... it works. Really the only thing negative about this is the 11.2oz bottle.

Its VERY watery. I know its supposed to be drunk from the bottle but from a glass it is virtually flavorless. Even from the bottle the widget makes the water cold but does not enhance flavor. There are some hints of oatmeal and roast but they somehow manage to play backup to nothing.  Mouthfeel: Light carbonation, smooth but disappointingly uncreamy. Feels like it missed the mark.

Taste: malty, dry, somewhat astringent. Not a whole lot of complexity, but it is well-balanced and otherwise tasty.  Mouthfeel: pretty full-bodied and creamy. I think we can thank the nitro again.

S= Aromas of sweet malt, dark roasted grains, coffee, and some very light chocolate. Everything was pretty muted though.  T= Decent balance of malt sweetness and roasted grain bitterness, with the roasted grains winning in the end. The chocolate and coffee flavors that I hoped would develop never really did. A slight earthiness in the middle. Finished very dry and roasty.  MF= Thin bodied with a crisp carbonation feel. Crisp enough to not be creamy at all, making this one too thin in my opinion.

S: Roasted notes - coffee, a wood-like charcoal; really not a whole lot going on in the nose.  T: Upfront there is some bitterness followed by a mellowed, roasted flavor with a tinge of sweetness - mild coffee, charcoal, lightly smoky, maybe the faintest note of chocolate. Easy on the palate, even if not overly complex.  M: Super smooth - easily the best aspect of this stout; the head is ultra creamy and somewhat thick, but the body itself is not overly thick/chewy.  D: Easy to quaff, not boozy in the least bit. Sessionable, for sure, but there are many other great sessionable stouts that are more complex and flavorful.

There is a bit of creamy mocha initially, with layers of roasted malt, followed by a rather clean, semi-dry finish. Not a sweet beer, but the malt gives it extra character, hinting at unsalted caramel. Definitely better, and more pronounced as the beer warms (I personally can't stand Guinness ice-cold).  A good beer. It is the standard of Ireland after all, but I'd pay $6 for a draft pint any day of the week.

I remember drinking a fair amount of it right as I started drinking beer because I thought it was the more manly, real beer beer.  Great looks from this beer. It even pours from a 14.9 oz can. I like canned beer, too bad so few good beers come in cans. Great head buildup from a very gentle pour into a pint glass... swirling bubbles form a thick, extremely long lasting head. Such a good head it seems artificial, actually. Nice dark color, just a little bit of light gets through on the edges with a yellow tint.  Very little smell, even after letting it warm a bit. Almost completely devoid of aroma when cold, it gradually emits some faint dark roasted malts and instant coffee. Nothing offensive but not inviting, either.  Surprising lack of flavor, which only grows just a bit with a lot of warmth. For a beer that looks like this and has a great semi-full mouthfeel, it's quite disappointing. Just a hint of roasted malts, but also a slightly unpleasant sour taste... not like pleasing citric hops, but more like milk one day past its best by date. Weird. How did they manage to make this beer with so little flavor? I'm guessing the color doesn't fully come from roasted malts, but has some adjunct coloring.  Feel is the other bright point, I like the full, creamy body to it. Too bad it's so low on aroma and flavor--for any style of beer. Not a beer I'll choose to come back to often.

Mouthfeel is light, gross tasting nitro finish. Drinkability is pretty good, the low alcohol and decent flavor make this a good beer when there are no other choices. I would not seek this out specifically, but its ok every once in awhile.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,TeeCee,3.56,"Black as the night in the light of the bar after the show watching the head build. The head appears as thick as a marshmallow, leaving strong evidence on the way down.  Hard to place the smell, almost sweet with a flowery hop scent.  The taste is not what you expect. It's very thick in the mouth, but thin tasting. Slightly chocolatey with a bitter end. None of the sweetness in the nose.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,glid02,3.69,"On-tap at a random bar on Edgewood in Atlanta.  I don't know how anyone could give the appearance anything less than a 5 - it never gets old watching the head cascade from the depths of the clear dark ruby beer up into a foamy cream-colored head. Then the lace sticks around for the life of the beer - very nice.  Smell of creamy roasted malts with very light hints of milk chocolate. I've had this many a time and the smell ranges from what I just described to a nondescript fruitiness. Never bad, but never far above average.  Tastes similar to how it smells. Faint roasted malt flavors find their way through a watery but not obtrusive flavor before slight milk chocolate flavors and a light bitterness round things out.  Mouthfeel is good. It's a bit thin but soft carbonation is nice.  Drinkability is good. I don't necessarily want another glass all that badly, but I know I could drink this all night. Quite the conundrum.  Overall this beer is a middle of the road irish dry stout, nothing to write home about, but always a good standby when other options are lacking.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Solid black with a thick, creamy, half inch tan head that stays the whole time leaving massive amounts of lacing. Amber bubbles that go backwards due to the whole nitro tap thing... How could this score under 4.5? Smells great at first, roasted malt, a bit of chocolate. Very inviting. Tastes very dry ( as is appropirate) with a bit of roasted malt flavor and a clean finish. The mouthfeel is nothing but creamy. As it warms the smell proves to be less complex as you might hope for in this style, but it's still pleasant.

209,754,ChrisCage,4.61,"OK I have reviewed this once from the can that I bought here at home but I was in Dublin where there isn't a pub that doesn't serve this.  All I have to say is that if anybody has the opportunity to visit Dublin, you will most definitely find the ""Black"" much much better than in the can. It is so fresh...there is a constant stream of trucks leaving the brewery to replace the 1-2 dozen kegs that are left outside of every pub each night....that's how fast it is ordered over there.  There is no need to do a review....I don't drink Guinness that much over here, even though I think it's a great beer out of the can and from the odd pub that has it on tap here, but in Dublin, I had it just about with every meal and it's amazing.

Appearance - Poured in all of the finest (and not so fine) Irish pubs, this beer has a deep dark ruby, almost black, color with a thick tan, almost white, creamy nitrous head. A true thing of beauty to behold when poured correctly from a nitro-tap.  Smell - Nothing much going on with the nose of Guinness Stout. Hints of coffee and roasted barley, but overall a somewhat weak nose.  Taste - Smokey chocolates and coffee tones with no bitter aftertaste. Love the creamy head of a nitro-tap poured Guinness. Not strong or overpowering at all, with no bitter aftertatse. It truly is delicious when poured correctly from a good and clean nitro-tap. Puts the taste of the canned Guinness to shame.  Mouthfeel - The creamy head adds a very smooth creamy mouthfeel to what would otherwise be a pretty thin and undercarbonated beer.  Drinkability - The smoothness and relatively low ABV of Guinness makes this a beer I could drink all day long....and I did!  Serving suggestion: Nitro-tap pour (by a bartender that knows how to pour Guinness correctly) into an authentic Guinness pint glass. A thing of beauty.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,fullsweep,3.78,"On tap at the local social club.  The bartender poured it slowly--filled the glass halfway, then poured someone's lager, then came back and finished mine off. Lots of creamy, thick, beige/light brown head. Pure black beer underneath.  Tastes and smells good--not outstanding, but good. Sweet and creamy upfront, but not an articial or sugary-sweetness, just the roasted barley coming through.  Drinkability's always good on a Guinness.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,ruckus232,3.01,14.9 ounce black nitro-can  Appearance: The pour always impresses me with the way the carbonation and head appears.

Thinner then the appearance may give away but to has a good mouthfeel.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,RuudJH,3.6,"Guinness taste has become a real favourite of mine, a recent developement, due to the special 8% export stout I've found. I have to say, my first encounter with this beer (draught, not the specialty) was many years ago, and I didn't like it all that much. I'm very curious what impression i get of it now.  A: very dark brown, with a ridiculously creamy thin head (I've never seen such a sharp line between beer and head). Rather low carbonation. S: roasted grains and coffee T: again slightly bitter, with coffee, roasted grain. M: Watery. I guess I've become used to the specialty so much, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed. D: You can easily drink several pints of this beer, good on thirsty days.  Overall, Guinness will stay within my recommendations. I really started liking the roasted grains and coffee in it. The draught however can't compare to the specialty.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Large cream colored head that stays around to you hit the bottom of the glass. Pretty heavy lacing as well. Outstanding overall.  Smell - To me, the weakest link in this beer. Has an overall funky kind of aroma; it's hard to pinpoint what the smell is exactly, but it's malty and maybe a hint of cocoa.  Taste - First thing that hits me is chocolate, and black coffee. Nothing too complex but has a very smooth texture. An aftertaste that can be best described as ""smokey"". Despite being very dark, not a very heavy beer.  Mouthfeel - As stated, very smooth and goes down easy. Very minimal carbonation.  Drinkability - due to the smooth nature and relatively low ABV, a great session beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,laituegonflable,2.35,"Pours a dark brown colour, with enormous creamy carbonation surge up and down the glass, and two fingers of thick, impenetrable beige head. It's iconic. It's magnificent.  Smells a little weak, with a vanilla cream aroma and a slight cherry hint of tartness. No real roasty notes, sad for a stout. It smells ""lighter"" than it should, too buoyant.  Taste is similarly weak, and seems watered down. It sort of has the outline of a deep toasty stout, but without the filling. Has a similar cream kind of flavour with a gritty finish, like an overcooked steak but not very potent or rich. Almost feels like roasted malt was added as an afterthought. Mouthfeel is creamy, buttery, but not quite full enough to excite.  This is the stout for the masses, really. But its appeal as thick, solid lord of dark matter is hype, not reality. In actuality it makes me want to retch the more I drink. It's bitter and unpleasant without being complex. Not all that.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The experience of ordering a Guinness with the head and watching it change colors, is better than actually drinking it unfortunately. The coffee type flavor is nice, but the beer could really use more alcohol. It can hardly be called a stout at 4.2% abv.

209,754,HalfFull,3.49,"Poured from a nitro-can into a matching Guinness glass. By matching I say smaller than most and sized for the can itself vs. an Imperial Pint Glass. Pours a rich black with red highlights with almost an inch of creamy tan head. The main detriment to the appearance was the inability of the 'nitro thingy' to put a four leaf clover atop the pour. Sometimes you need a skilled bartender, and a cascading nitrogen pour, which this did have to a degree. Great head retention but not quite the sip by sip lacing I've experienced in Ireland and elsewhere on tap.  Smells like Guinness, whatever that implies. Lightly roasted malts, bit of hops, touch of chocolate and a cleanliness reminiscent of a lager. More of the roasted malts with some warming.  Nice flavor of slightly burnt malts. A bit thin perhaps but not nearly as watery as I've seen on tap at times which helps the feel and drink. Nice medium body and smooth flavor without the bitterness I've experienced at times on tap as well. The can I assume is universal. Alas, the can is a good vehicle to enjoy a Guinness without the expense of travel, though at a slight cost in flavor to a good pour near the source.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,nighthawk,3.09,"Brought a notepad for the first time while drinking this beer, so decided to chronicle.  Arrived as beautiful as Guinness ever does - dark brown body nearing black, with a thick creamy tan head that lasted until the end of the beer, and even left a bit of lacing.  Not much to the aroma. Mild roasted grains, with a hint of caramel-like sweetness.  Roasted grain taste, mildly and generically sweet. Maybe hints of coffee and chocolate.  Mouthfeel is thin, very light, with little carbonation. It's too thin to feel creamy or smooth. Nice crispness to it though, and clean finish.  This beer goes down very smoothly, but there's not enough to it that I'm really enjoying drinking it: I would probably have another in a sitting, if it's the best thing on tap. Overall this beer is nice, but everything about it is too mild. Plenty of other stouts (irish dry or otherwise) that are every bit as easy drinking but pack a better flavour punch.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Taste is very underwhelming, if I had my eyes closed I'd think I were drinking bud light. Tastes like a watered down version of a roasted malt tea. Body is lighter than I thought it would be. Drinkability is average, I can see it being easy to throw a few of these back without being bogged down.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,deapokid,3.3,"Broke ""the rules"" and poured this out of its nitro-bottle into a pint glass.  Medium sized white head. Brown bubbles cascade over black liquid. It has a classic look that is one of the most memorable of all the beers I've had in my life.  Aroma is really light and almost unnoticeable. I guess I smell a slight nutiness, maybe coffee, it's pretty light.  Taste is clean and watery, not as profound as most American stouts and not as distinctive as its Irish brothers (i.e. O'Hara's and Beamish). A mild smokey-ness with coffee grounds permeates after a few sips. Big gulps give off a bit of a shoe rubber taste that isn't really too desirable.  Even though its taste is lacking, it is quite drinkable and it's a brew that I've grown used to over the past 7 or 8 years.  I've always enjoyed this brew, but it just doesn't stand up against most of the craft stouts I've tried.  I guess this is what we have to put up with in the states. Apparently, mass production outside of Ireland has harmed the recipe of this classic. I hope to one day try the real thing.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,ArrogantDeadGuy,2.7,"What happened! Over the past ten years (my drinking career) it seems as though this beer has been getting worse and worse. Guinness' were my first beers and they were fantastic. Now the inconsistent, anything but black color, and weak head are breaking my heart. The smell is gone and the smooth creamy taste is more of a metallic sip of tap water!? I loved this beer and feel personally wronged by those who have watered down this liquid tradition. The only remenant of the old Guinness is the way the nitro makes it feel when you drink it, but the mouthfeel simply can't stand alone.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Extra Stout is a better representation of what I was expecting.  D: It's drinkable. It could probably be a session beer for most BA members.  Overall: It's OK. They've built an empire on reputation.

209,754,TheycallmeTim,2.53,"Had on-tap at Ceol in Brooklyn, poured into a Guinness nonic pint.  A--Guinness pretty much looks like its own advertisement. Perfectly still, black all the way to the taper of the glass, where barely a glint of ruby peeks through. Cap is two fingers of beige cream that dwindles to a finger but remains for the duration and lays soapsuddy drapes down the glass.  S--Uh? No. Almost nothing--barely a glint of roasted chocolate malt back there, followed by some rusty or coppery notes. A little bit of earth mixing with the minerals. Smells like skim milk diluted by hard water, mostly.  T--Same deal as the nose, which is a shame. Maybe a little more bitterness from the malt which comes in as a phantom of coffee, but pretty much it's all rusty and coppery metals followed by a trace of fresh damp soil. Tastes like skim milk diluted by hard water, mostly.  M--Did I mention the watery skim milk aspects of this beer? The foam helps the mouthfeel get out of the cellar, but mostly it's yucky thin.  D--I drank three pints pretty fast, but I think that's because I kept searching for flavor. Nowhere near the Extra Stout in the bottle, and can't hold a shaky whimpering candle to O'Hara's on-tap. If you want real IDS from the country of origin and it's available, grab that one. Still, if I had a bucket of oysters on a nice Spring day...I'd probably still look for O'Hara's, or pick up a sixer of Smutty's Robust Porter (which is really a stout, I think).",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Ragingbull,3.92,"This is a tough beer to review in the sense that I think its so familiar to most of us that you don't want to give it its due. I did my best.  It pours a deep brown to light black in color. The classic cascading action of Guiness followed when it was poured into the glass. There is a white tone to the beer as it churns and then it culminates in a thick frothy head. Very smooth flavor, even if its unremarkable to some. It has just a slight hint of roasted malts and grains, but you almost have to be searching for it. As I mentioned it is very tough to grade an old standard that is so familiar. You could certainly find a lot of beers that don't stack up to guiness. You could also find many that are superior.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Fluffy, cloud like white head about a 1/2 inch thick that took about 1 miniute to form properly.  S- Very mild malt aromas with a slight touch of coffee and mossy earthyness.  T- Weak stout flavor almost bland. Not a very mature stout. Offers a malty convection of lightly toasted grains and cocoa, maybe some others but too weak to make out.  M/D- Silky finish with light carbonation almost flat mouth feel. Overall not worth the hype or cost for me.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Offa,1.98,"I have had this in the nitro-widget bottle as well as on tap and my review for the bottle is about the same as on tap: this beer is a pale, thin, weak excuse for a dry stout and far inferior to the Guinness Extra Stout. Just as on nitro tap, out of the bottle it is thin and bland, embodying pretty much all the bad qualities of Irish dry stouts with little of the good.  It looks good, always being (in my experience) in a nitro can or bottle or tap. It has an almost black body with an even, medium, creamy light tan head that lasts a long time.  The aroma is exceedingly weak, being mostly light burnt toast and dirty water with a hint of coffee.  The taste is similar, being mostly water with light burnt toast and very faint hints of soil & coffee. It's watery, thin, and bland, so boring it's barely even one dimensional. However, it is not actually unpleasant and it's easy to drink. Even when not too chilled (and many seem to want it cold, confusingly), it still lacks any character whatsoever.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Patrick999,3.25,"So, this was more or less my best option at the bar I was at. OK, I'm cool with that, I'm not so much of a snob that I can't drink a Guinness. Now a Bud Light, that's another story....but Guinness? Guinness Draught and I are on speaking terms, even though it's not the Extra Stout.  A - This was not a beer bar by any stretch of the imagination, but I'll be damned if they didn't get the pour absolutely perfect. It was poured into a kind of curved pint glass....I think it was a Bass glass. The bubbles cascaded around and around, up and down, for over a minute. Maybe even over 2 minutes. Dark body, red highlights. Creamy head, good lacing. In short, it looked exactly how a Guinness should look. I don't dole out 5s for appearance easily, but this particular pour really nailed it.  S - Great pour, blah aroma. It smelled like Guinness, which is to say, not much. Maybe a little cream, maybe a little hazelnut. Not too much more.  T - Eh....what do you know....a little roasty, little nip of wet-earth hop to finish. Not bad. I can remember many a night feeling very glad to have this.  F - I think the feel is best described as cream diluted with water. It is what it is. It does make it very easy to drink, though.  D - It's always easy to put a few back. Going down, you barely feel it. Most experienced BAs could probably down a couple pints of this and go for a 5K run a half-hour later with little to no discomfort. Drinkability is high. What? Hey, shut up. You know you'll drink the hell out of this in certain situations. Don't even fight it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Small dark malt notes  T-Rich and roasted describe it best the malt comes out good in the front but not so well in the finish.  M&D-Kind of thin for a stout and very straightforward. Smooth and easy to drink tho.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,dbmcrorie,3.51,"Visual: Very similar to when poured on tap. I poured it into a tulip glass and did a two-step pour. It poured out thick and creamy yet settled out much faster (than on tap) and ended up with a tan yet frothy head (two fingers) rather than being creamy and smooth. Fortunately, the head stayed thick and present until the end and left a nice lacing around the edge after each sip. The body is dark-chocolate black.  Aroma: There are subtle notes of roasted barley as well as hints of caramel, but it is predominately chocolate. It reminds me greatly of a Young's Double Chocolate Stout. There are strong notes of coffee/espresso at the end.  Taste: The thick head is the first thing to hit the mouth which introduces light notes of vanilla and mocha. The body finds most of its flavor in the roasted barley and soft bitterness in the back of the tongue that is reminiscent of fresh coffee. Unfortunately the chocolate and caramel malts are not as rich as Guinness on tap. The mouthfeel is also a bit watered down and doesn't last long on the tongue.  Overall: I have had quite a few pints of canned Guinness and must say that I am usually let down. I feel that the main reason I have bought it in the can is due to convenience and loyalty to Guinness. I can't say it is ""bad"" as I still enjoy drinking it, but I would probably choose something else over Guinness in the can. Yet I will always choose Guinness on tap over anything else. :)  Cheers!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

S - Aroma is kind of muted overall with some roasted malt notes and faint coffee and chocolate. Not much going on, unfortunately.  T - Flavor is a bit more roasted than the aroma with some dry, earthy hop bitterness and a tinge of coffee and chocolate. Finishes with a fair amount of earthy hop bitterness.

So in a way, I am thankful for Guinness, I think a lot of people started out on Guinness and continued their way up to the glorious craft beer food chain. I still f--king love Guinness, stout and draught. Where I live, people think Guinness is some odd beer since everyone drinks BMC or some sh-tty malt liquor like King Cobra or Wildcat (full of wiggers and hillbillies in Youngstown). Anyways, still an old favorite of mine, reminds me of my freshman year of college. I've drank it from the nitro-can, nitro-bottle, and nitro-tap. This review is on the nitro-tap.  A- I love watching the foam in the glass roll around and cascade through the class. There is no beer with a better head than Guinness. Dark, Dark Brown, almost black like Coca-Cola. Mocha foam rolls through out this beer until it settles at the top, looking like some hulked up milkshake.  S- The smell, well, it smells sort of sour and skunky, but I don't mind. Nodes of chocolate, coffee, and rye  T- I'm biased, lol, so it tastes awesome. Taste very sour at first, but leaves multiple aftertastes of dark rye bread, burnt coffee/chocolate and roasted grains  M- mmm....almost chewy, like liquid pork chops :) Feels so good to roll this around in my mouth, very thick and dry  D- 2-4 of these babies and I'm done. If you like to get hammered, Guinness is not the beer for you, so alkys steer clear, unless you want a hangover and black vomit. But I'd say its super drinkable only if you cut yourself off after 2. Guinness is a very acquired taste.  Overall, this is one of my all time favorites. It's just a great beer that is widely available. Great starter beer for some.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,katan,3.21,"12 oz bottle into a pint  A - The obvious contraption fake nitrogen pour is the most obvious attribute. The cascading waves of foam as it falls down the inside of the glass. Head formation is very strong and mocha in color. Body of the beer itself is quite opaque.  S - Sour yeasty notes lead the way. The foam CO2/N smell flows through as well.  T - Starts off with a bit of roasted malts and sour funkiness. Finishes with a bittersweet chocolate flavor. Bitter aftertaste sits on the tongue.  M - Thin and flat texture. A hair of oily substances clinging to the tongue.  D - Moderate drinkability. Low ABV is a charm to manage, but the carbonation is more filling than most. Palette fatigue is starting to set in - the sour tones get a bit old after a while.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,coalcracker,2.58,"Appearance: Pours (cascades) near-opaque with head that sticks around for a millenia.  Smell: Malty sweetness with a tiny bit of floral hoppiness. Very light chocolate/roasted malt aroma predominant.  Taste: A touch of roasted malt up-front with a drying bitterness towards the back end of the tasting. Malt presence is too light- as if not enough malt was included in this beer's recipe.  Mouthfeel: Extra-smooth but not very crisp, almost flat. Too thin in body for my liking. Semi-dry finish.  Drinkability: Drinkable in terms of being a session beer, but the texture and overall quality of this beer turns me off a bit.  -Haven't had any other true Irish dry stouts, so this beer will be my benchmark for future reviews of the style. Hopefully, these future tastings will be better experiences.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BARFLYB,2.87,"On tap in a Guinness glas  A- This has a dark black look to it but is actually a very dark dirty brown with a very pretty white foamy cap of condensed bubbles. Good lace on the way down.  S- Nothing to write home about but slight roasted malt and some chocolate backing although it's not to strong.  T- Like flavored chocolate water with roasted malts thrown into the mix. It is on the dry side though with warming.  M- One of the most watered down feeling brews that i've ever had, make that the most. With all that said it does display some creamy appeal. Thin bodied with low carb.  D- Gets better as it warms while the chocolate comes out more. Next time I order this I'll just wait till it gets to that point.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Near black opaque body with a thick creamy tan head. S: Nitrogen, raisiny chocolate, some sweet coffee. T: I dunno--tastes a lot different from the stuff I'd get over in the UK; a lot more watery. Still, not to bad, though it wouldn't be my favorite dry stout. Bitter coffee throughout most of it, shifts toward the end into some dark malts. Short pine aftertaste. M: Again, a bit thin but still creamy. D: Probably one of the easier to drink dry stouts.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Nitro poured beers are a sight to look at, the bubble dance is the trademark of this beer.  Smell: Smells like an old wet feed sack.  Taste: Ok there is a bit of roasted grain, with a slight bitterness. Is that a very faint chocolate sweetness in the finish?  Mouthfeel: Nitro cream meets a watery grave.  Drinkability: This beer has been turned into a real session beer, kind of like a macro with some flavor.  After Thoughts: Seems Guinness has fallen victim to the corporate juggernaut.

A finger's head goes nowhere quickly, and lacing is on the good side of decent.  The nose, from what I can tell, is a mixture of coffee and chocolate. The taste is more of the same with a bitterness throughout.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin but smooth with mild carbonation. Drinkability is okay, but I don't think I would want more than two in a row.  The cascading effect is cool, but it doesn't last very long. I'll gladly take Extra Stout over this any day.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,JEdmund,3.22,"Appearance Nothing like that beautiful, signature cascade effect! Fun to watch and once settled, looks full and rich, with dense pillow of foam atop a black, ruby-edged body.  Smell Mild, but like malted milk chocolate  Taste & Mouthfeel Soft and rounded flavors of sweet, chocolatey malts; little fruitiness and just a dash of bitterness in the finish; very light and easy to drink; thin body and hardly any perceptible carbonation  Overall It's one of the first dark beers I got into, and it's funny I used to think it was a big beer. I'm actually impressed now by how light and easy it is to drink. Fun to drink for the novelty or on St. Patrick's Day, but there are numerous other stouts I'd take over this one.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,FallinDeck,3.12,"I love the look of this pour. The black body and the brown castcading head is a sight. Aroma has a light molasses/coffee. Somewhat of a salty acidic flavor with a watery texture and a dry finish.

Taste is ok. Not as good as it was when I first drank this, but still pretty tasty. Lightly roasted coffee flavor.  Mouthfeel is disappointing. Not nearly as thick as I remember. Somewhat watery and thin.  Drinkability is tremendous, now that it doesn't feel as thick. I could drink these forever.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,alkemy,2.95,"I'll preface this by saying that Guinness on tap is among my favorite beers. However, this review is of the nitro-bottle draught and it is sorely lacking. The look is very close as well as the smell. The taste is almost a flat, watered down version of the original. After drinking Guinness extensively on tap, I'm very comfortable saying that from the tap is the only way to fly.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,KTCamm,3.86,"Lets all agree on a few things - Guinness is better on draft than in a nitro can - Guinness is better closer to the source (Ireland) than exported.  Ok, maybe the second one is just an old legend, or maybe its the ambience of Ireland, but I found it to be true on my ttrip there a few years back.  As far as the nitro can goes - its a toned down version of the classic. Still the same jet back color with high cascading foam. Still the smooth creamy roasted dry stout taste you are used to. Still easy to finish the four pack in one setting without knowing how that happened.  Just not as good as the original original.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,ToddT,3.27,"A- One of the most unique and beautiful beers, the cascading is a site to behold. Starts off creamy white and then cascades from the bottom of the glass to the top changing to black as it goes. There is a thick off white head that lasts forever and covers the sides of the glass in foam and thick rings that mark each swallow.  S- Roasted malt, earth tones, a couple of whiffs of metal or the nitrogen widget not sure which. Not much of an aroma though.  T- Roasted malt, faint hint of chocolate and coffee, slightly bitter hit of hops for the aftertaste.  M- Creamy and smooth but thin in the mouth. Finish is a slightly dry.  D- At 4.2% ABV there is no danger of it being a one and done beer. Goes down easy and smooth and pairs well with almost any food.  A classic beer and the one that ushered me into the world of beers outside of marco-lagers. While this one no longer compares to what I would call a world class beer, it will always be a special one for me.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,mjw06,3.72,"so i went to dublin with a mission in mind. find out if the guinness is really better in ireland. now granted ive never had guinness on-tap in the states, so that might be the problem there. but i have to say that i was impressed with draught in the pubs of dublin. so ive posted my previous review of draught out of a can in the states and critiqued it with parenthesis of the tap in dublin.  ----  not much outside of your normal ""roast and toast"" smells you find in most porters and stouts. but thats it just ""roast and toast"", not adjectives for describing the smell of something else. (this holds true still just a little bit. this beer is defineatly not one for a lot of smell.)  taste like water, no really, it almost does. leaves a hint of bitterness, but quite frankly i like bitterness in my beer, not my water. (no tasting like water here, well maybe after your second or third one, but the taste is much richer. roasted barley. i actually got to taste the barley they use at the brewery, gave me a much better idea of the character of the beer. however i would still appreciate a stronger taste, even some more hops. people seem not to like guinness because they say its too strong, but for a so-called ""stout"". guinness is kind of weak. not very complex either)  an extremely watery mouthfeel. highly disappointing, by far the worst element of this beer. the frothy head on your lips might save it a little. but its a mouthfeel, not a lip feel. (this was the biggest difference in the beer. contrary to its reputation, guinness is a considerably lighter bodied brew, however, its just extremely creamy. though id appreciate a heavier body, the feel is still great, and brings out the taste wonderfully. very light carbonation as well.)  its drinkable, complimented my ice cream well. with they could some how merge the beauty of draught, with the taste of extra stout. i hope it is true that they keep the good stuff in dublin so i can experience real guinness when i go over there. as of now though, i promise its just living of the nitro effect. (its true, the best stuff is in dublin and it makes sense. i found this beer to be very drinkable while i was over there, maybe because its everywhere. but i can go for another, and another, another one of these, and it sits in the stomach great. great with a wide variety of foods as well.)",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,br3wmeister,4.11,"A- Waves of tan bubbles jet through this jet black beer as the thick silky head forms. The head takes some time to fully form and when it does there is a distinct line where they head meets the beer. The retention is great and there is nice thick lacing.  S- Sweet and malty aromas come from this beer, lots of dark chocolate and a hint of peat smoke. No detectable hops in the nose.  T- Dry chocolaty flavors come through as I drink this beer. The flavors are pretty subtle but pleasant. Some good roasted flavors and again a hint of peat smoke. This is a good beer to start with but after anything with a high hop profile and you will not taste this beer at all.  M- This is a medium to light bodied beer that is super smooth. It feels very milky as you drink it. Very nice mouth feel.  Overall I would say that this is a beer that I really enjoy. It is not the best of style and I do not go seeking this beer out but it taste great and is very easy to drink.

S: Metallic and toasted dark malt aromas  T: Light caramel flavors with roasted dark and black malt. Pretty weak all the way around. Even the dryness is pretty minimal.  M: Thin, thin, thin. Metallic, mineral aftertaste is signature.  D: Drinkable because of its lack of heft, This beer is much lighter in body and flavor than even 5 years ago.

Light tan / off-white thick, creamy head.  S: Not much here. Nitrogen. A bit of burned malt. Hints of sulfur or peat?  T: Very subtle flavor for a stout (even for an Irish Dry Stout). Mild bitterness, even more subdued malts. A taste that I had grown to love over the years, so it's hard to not enjoy, though.  M: Thick, creamy, wonderful.  D: Mild flavor and relatively low alcohol make this one of the more easily drinkable stouts.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

A very fine carbonation with a very creamy mouthfeel. The feel can definitely throw people off if they have never had a beer of this nature before (i.e. mass produced crap). The palate follows the nose, with notes of roasted barley, a little coffee, and surprisingly light. Gentle bitterness and a definite dry quality. This one is famous and rightly so.

The famous fat, super-creamy head of light tan foam rests atop the equally famous dark brown, nearly opaque black, liquid. The head stays true to the end, holding on like a champ to the walls of the vessel in thick curtains.  A mild roasted aroma presents itself to the nose, without much else.  A medium body possesses the characteristic smooth, ""flat"" mouthfeel, with an overall mild flavor -- roasted malts dominate, but in no way overpower, and a hint of herbaceous hops make themselves known but are not forward, leading into a dry, lightly roasted espresso-like finish.  Low in alcohol, smooth on the tongue, and inoffensive on the palate, Guinness makes one of the greater quaffs available virtually worldwide, making it a perfect fallback and one of the pinnacles of session beer-dom.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,TheQuietMan22,2.84,"Appearance: Poured like a chocolate milkshake from the nitro can. As the famous cascade of bubbles rose the beer settled to deep black that was not completely opaque. A thick, creamy head sat on top throughout the pint.  Smell: The smell is not very strong, but it had a light, chocolate milk scent with just a hint of coffee.  Taste: Similar to the smell, but the flavor is subdued. It's watery, but smooth. It has a slight bitter tail to it, mostly from the coffee malts.  Drinkability: It's Saint Paddy's Day, so what can I say? The drinkability is high, and it has that distinctness to make it appealing, but to me it's the ""lite"" version of stout. Maybe it's because I've only had it from nitro bottles and cans. Directly from the keg, as a ""draught,"" is the ideal way to drink it. Directly from the keg in Ireland would be perfect.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Smell - chocolate, liquorice and good coffee supported by malt aromas.  Taste - a little subdued, but unsweetened chocolate and black coffee with a bit of a tinny hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel - a little undercarbonated for my taste although just enough action.  Drinkability - this is a one-glass deal for me.

I am going to try one from the bottle and one from a pint glass. While the bottle looks nice, it doesn't show me anything about the beer. Pouring releals a dark brown beverage that is topped by about one finger of mocha head. Great retention. Head remains the whole way down with good lacing.  Aroma is lacking both in the bottle and the glass. There's some stale roasted malt as well as a metallic smell and maybe some chocolate.  Taste is very watery. Main flavors are roasted malt and coffee. Stale bitterness and a little smoky. Some sweetness in the middle. Floral hops on the finished are there briefly and then gone. A little dry. Aftertaste is a a bit roasty.  Mouthfeel is very thin. Drinks just like water. Not anywhere near what a stout should be. Drinking from the bottle adds a little creaminess but not much.

Taste: Roasted malt and dry dark chocolate. Maybe a bit of dairy jumps in. Mostly smoky and roasted flavors though.  Mouthfeel: Stout eh? Thinnest stout I've ever felt. Maybe the thinnest beer I've ever felt! Watery with mild nitrous carbonation. Almost no mouth-coating or even aftertaste. Veery, very, weak.  Drinkability: Probably the lightest Irish dry stout on the market, as well as the most marketable.

209,754,Naugled,4.01,"A: this is one of the rare fun beers to watch. Obviously from the nitro. Color is very dark brown with creamy brown head that does last to the bottom. Which is when you get that treat of a dollop of foam to finish. Head seems to be a little more full on tap than bottle or can.  S: not much smell to me. It's fresh, slightly tangy but not a lot going on in this department.  T: nice weak roast flavor with just enough sour to make it distinct. This is not a bold stout but a session stout so the flavors tend to be minimized. but they are good. The nitro tap seems to be the most flavorful to me. However I do taste variations from bar to bar. but the tap is the way to drink this.  M: good flat smooth feel.

Retention is great and thick, foamy lacing trails down the top of the glass.  S: Some faint roasted malt. Watered down coffee and subdued chocolate are also detectable. Perhaps a slight earthy note.  T: Mild roasted malt flavors, along with some lactic sweetness. The dark chocolaty notes acquit themselves well, although they're still somewhat subdued. Hints of charcoal and coffee are also present. Some faint earthy and leafy hop flavors add a light bitterness into the finish.  M: Light bodied, almost watery - but quite creamy thanks to the nitrogen. Finishes a bit dry.  D: Very easy to drink, with an appealingly soft mouthfeel. It's certainly not robust or full-bodied, and I can't really say this is a great beer, but once in awhile I just have a craving for something like this, and it gets the job done.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The nitrogen widget inside the bottle lets out a small amount of nitrogen each time it is tipped to try to replicate a mini draft each time so by pouring the entire bottle out at once, you kinda lose the point of having this bottle. However, the can is intended to be poured and will not be correct out of the can. So with that said, I think this is better than most reviews.

It can not be improved unless there is a nice lass behind the bar.  S - Nothing special. The nitro scent covered a lot of the roasted malt flavor.  T - There is roasted malt a wee bit of hops and a full body nitro creaminess. However it consistently seems watery no matter where I have it. Its similar to a liquid immisciblity- the water and the creamy stout.  M - Once you get past the consistently thick head, the roasted malt flavors rest on your tongue  D - For a stout, its very drinkable and at least for me its not to filling.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Dense and smooth mocha colored head well into the two-finger rule. Good head retention and laced followed only from where I drank at first and then dispersed to coat the walls of the glass  S: thin watery grains and whiff of stale coffee  T: timid flavor profile of roasted notes of grains and barley. It is hard to say coffee flavors in the mix, more or less they are weak and offer up a slight nutty character  M: this is what makes this beer possible! The timid flavors allow for the creamy, slick and smooth body, close to black gold in some regards, for very easy drinkability. Top notch points for this  D: always mixed feelings about this brew. I respect, and yet, loathe this beer in some ways. Last I was in Ireland I put on my ""Guinness Drinking Shoes"" and they were soaked by the end of the trip. I grew tired in some ways of this staple and yet if I get the chance to have it, I never pass on it",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,JJBlanche,3.57,"The bros really hammered this one. I'll agree that it's certainly no world class brew, but often times I'll find myself in a bar, and the choice will be Guinness or piss -- guess which one I choose? The fact that it's so widely distributed is nice.  A - As far as stouts go, you're not going to find one looking much nicer than a nitroed Guinness. Maybe a nitroed Dub Chocho, but I digress.  S - Nothing exceptional. A neutered roasted character, as the bros have suggested. Some of the sourness that Guinness is known for. Not bad though, especially when compared to BMC piss.  T - Again, not mind-blowing, but at least it has some semblance of complexity. Definitely not bad. Not great, but not bad.  M - It'd be really excellent if that nitro creaminess was backed up by a bit more body, but you can't win 'em all, I suppose.  D - Very drinkable. Indeed, a benchmark of drinkability.  At the end of the day, this is a very sessionable stout, and sometimes I'm frankly in the mood for one, if for no other reason than a hearkening back to the good ol' days. That said, if there was a ""value"" rating here on beer advocate, I'd give it a one. For the same price, I'm sure you can get much better stuff. Granted, I haven't priced out a case of Guinness in a long time, but I'm sure it's up in the 40-50 dollar range.  In that sense not worth it, but by the same token Guinness is a Godsend in those situations where you get dragged to some dive bar, and all they have is BMC or Guinness.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,mikeal1917,3.48,"This ""classic"" is a better than average beer, but it seems has been hyped up and overrated by many. Tonight I tried my first legal Guinness, and figured I'd share my thoughts.  Appearance- The famous head is still a trademark of the Guinness name, and after the beer settles, the black and white mix is a marvel to look at.  Smell- As I stuck my nose in it, a nutty, mild smell came to mind. I've always loved that Guinness smell after you empty that can  Taste- The bitterness reminds me of Boddington's Pub Ale, which I had a few days ago. A smooth, easy aftertaste compliments the beer, but after a few swallows, it started to get to me, and I found myself taking longer and longer periods between sips.  Mouthfeel- This creamy, frothy brew is refreshing and smooth  Drinkability- This beer is quite thick and filling, so depending on your tolerance is might fill you up pretty quick.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

I have since expanded my horizons and until i decided to revisit an old friend for the sake of this review. It has been a year or two since i have even had a Guinness.  Lets start with the obvious. There is no prettier beer in my opinion then a properly poured Guinness. The black color with the thick creamy head cascading still gets my mouth watering just by looking at it.  Unfortunately the smell and taste are not as extraordinary. Smells of burnt malts and very slightly of coffee.  Taste from the nitro can is defintely watered down. Mostly bitter with burnt wood flavor. Mouth feel is really good and this is very drinkable. Not at all ""the meal in a glass"" many folks proclaim it to be.  All that said.

S - Roasted smells of malts, chocolate.  T - Deeelicious!!!  M - Medium, rich, a nice full mouthfeel. Even though it is thick, it is not overwhelming, almost a silky thickness and it goes down so easy  D - I can always drink a Guinness, any time of year, it goes well with so many things.

Guinness is always called that ""hearty"" beer but it's really lacking out of the can. Very subtle coffee/chocolate and no semblance of anything complex.  M: Carbonation is a tad bit much and the brew is generally too watery for me. On the plus side, it's smooth.  D: Incredibly drinkable.

Dismal aromatics, some robust malt, a hint of coffee and chocolate can be detected as well. Gulp. Thick as brick, smooth on the intake. Taste of some roast coffee and the dark bitter chocolate come into play. The thickness of the beer make the gulp factor nonexistent. This is the goto beer if its twelve noon on st. patty's day, you're Irish, are you're in one of their establishments. The choice is yours, recommended on those factors alone.

Nose is malty and rich, but only slight roasty and altogether mild for a stout. Flavor is good, but not great, the dark roasted malts come through a bit earthy. The body is lighter than I was expecting and the nitro show is over leaving it a bit, well, flat. Overall is not to bad and the drinkability is fair. The best part was the initial show however.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The stiff head sits on a clear yet dark brown body. The head remains throughout. The appearance of this one is the highlight.  Smell was nice but one-dimensional. Over-roasted coffee beans.  Taste was roasted malts with a mild sweetness. Weak coffee. Very light nuttiness. Kind of bland really.  Mouthfeel was thin but silky. All of the carbonation was in the head, not the body.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,CaptYellow,3.26,"Not black. Indeed, I've had darker porters. And those with more taste too. It has a bitterness that puts some people off, but without it I fear there would be not much to taste. However, this is a drinkable stout, and, in my area (New York) affordable. On sale, in glass, it's about $1.10 for the 11.2 oz (9.8 cents per oz). In the cans, I just got it for about $1.12 for 14.9 oz (7.5 cent per oz). So, it's about 90 cents per 3/4 pint while cheap beer is 66 cents- not much more. Even though it's watered down, it's cheap for stout and the only one in my area. It's an affordable beer, widely available, with great branding. My favorite part though is the pouring of the glass ""draught"" Guinness into a glass and watching the bubbles- it is the most beautiful of beers.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The head is there until the end.  Had this on tap in London before - it can take over a minute to pour to let the head settle. Enjoyed it much more on tap, especially in the U.K. than in the U.S. Nitro can is preferred over the bottle though.  It's easy to drink as nothing is overpowering, but perhaps that's also its downside - I think it lacks a bit of character. But it tastes earthy, it's very creamy, has slight coffee and chocolate notes and has very little carbonation. Slightly bitter finish.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

None of which were easily recognizable but if you hunt a little, its there.  Taste of roasted malt and not much else. Hints of coffee every now and then but still seems watered down.  A dry, medium bodied beer with light carbonation. Has its moments but nothing exciting. I probably wouldn't want another, in fact I'm reminded why I haven't tried this in so long. Seems completely overpriced to me and just not worth it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Bitterbill,3.31,"Poured from the can and there's that cascading head, a treat to watch. There's a one finger head of foam after things settle down. It looks black but I can see some red shing through.  The smell has some roasted malt and a touch of chocolate but they are both very light on my nose.  The taste has light notes of roasted malt and coffee with an even lighter note of chocolate. There's some bitterness here with a touch of a slight sourness but the latter is in no way offensive to me. Like I said, the flavours are there but are a tad too weak to make it an interesting brew to drink.  The mouthfeel is typical for a brew packaged this way..it feels thicker than it actually is.  Drinkability? It's very easy drinking (so that's certainly not a problem) with the caveat that I wouldn't go out of my way to buy more but if it's on tap with the usual macro suspects, I'd go for it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Very very dark red to brown that lets very little light through. Has the classic tan thick creamy foamy head. Lacing continues down the glass.  S - Smells like one of those irish cream flavored creamers you put in your coffee. Slight maltiness as well, but very subdued.  T/M - About all there is to say is that its creamy creamy and more creamy. You'd expect there to be other flavors there, but there isn't really. There's a malt flavor that sticks in your mouth as you finish. It's rather unique in it's lack of complexity. That isn't to say it tastes bad, it just doesn't taste like much. Feels rather thick in your mouth though, like... well... heavy cream or half and half.

A - black, like a stout should be, there are some hints of ruby at the edges, but it's pretty dark, but not as dark as it's much better tasting cousin Extra Stout. It had a small 1.5cm head.  S - roasted barley, coffee, smoke, tobacco.  T - basically: coffee and cigarettes. roasted barley, coffee, smoke, tobacco, and throw together with a very, very dry finish.  M - incredible. the creamiest beer I have ever had.  D - I despise this beer. Once, I did manage to stomach it by taking a drink and chasing it with Jager, but since Jager tastes like an asshole, I had to chase it with some Guinness.

S- Very pleasant aroma of sweet and roasted malts. Slight caramel notes with a bit of smokiness.  T- Malt is nicely roasted with little astringency.

209,754,biboergosum,3.61,"I used to have one or two of these only on St. Patrick's day, like the rest of the beer-drinking world, until I went to Ireland a few years ago. There, it seems to often be the only non-lager available at pubs throughout the countryside, and I got my fill of it, and then some. Haven't had it in a while, but there's something about a dark pub and those ubiquitous black Guinness skirts that the waitresses wear.  A full UK pint arrives at the table in my local Irish, and looks to be an opaque black, with reddish cola highlights, barely perceptible in the low backlighting of the pub, and one finger of a perfectly solid, foamy, caked tan head, which leaves a patchwork of mesa profile lace around the glass as it very slowly abates.  It smells of nutty, lightly roasted grainy malt, with subtle ministrations of bittersweet chocolate and cold coffee grounds. The taste is dry toasty caramel malt, a mild floral hoppiness, some ethereal pithy drupe fruitiness, and a swirling cafe au lait character. Nothing particularly hoppy manifests.  There is indeed very little carbonation, the body surprisingly medium-light, a tad creamy, and definitely smooth, though it somehow feels like it's sticking to the roof of my mouth. It finishes dry, with a redux of that aromatic toasted nuttiness.  Overall, hey, it's Guinness - mild stout flavours and an easy quaffing quotient make it a reliable option for a session of whiskey and ale interlacing. Add in the decidedly un-American ABV levels, and you're good to go, once you convince your eyes that this is not actually heavy in the slightest.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Pours a dark black with a creamy white head and the standard brownish alive cool looking action in the beer before it settles to black with the cream head that lasts. This is not lacing, as the beer moves from the glass the creamy composition of the head literally stays on the glass. Smells of coffee and faint chocolate. Tastes primarily of watered down coffee, a faint chocolate and a little nutty. The beer feels both creamy and watery, no carbonation.

Taste is of caramel, roasted coffee, hints of chocolate. On paper, it doesn't sound too bad, but all of these flavors are just completely, totally watered down. It's actually almost like coffee/caramel/chocolate flavored water.  The mouthfeel suffers as well due to the watering down. It's creamy, yes, but definitely not what it can and should be.

This review is solely based on my experience with Guinness, straight from the tap in a classic Irish pub in Dublin, which I assure you is quite different than cracking open a can and pouring it into an Irish Car Bomb. Now,Guinness on tap in CA is crap, in New York it's pretty good, in western Ireland is pretty damn good, and in Dublin is fucking amazing. The appearance is thick, like motor oil, with a beautifully dense creamy head. The smell is a bit hard for me to detect, but it's the classic ""stout"" smell, if you catch my drift. The taste was absolutely wonderful, thick, creamy, chocolatey. The drinkability can be judged by the general happiness and hospitality of the Irish people, who rightfully use this as their lifeblood to write poems, carry on amazing traditional music sessions, and appreciate nature. Ok ok, am I rambling here? To conclude, drink this in Dublin from a pint poured by an expert barman, rather than out of a can or in a car bomb.

My friend, having just come home from Ireland, thought it would make him feel better if he purchased some Guinness. So naturally, he offered me one. I figured since I had just recently reviewed the nitro-can version I would give this one a shot. It can't be much different, can it?  Boy was I wrong. It was the same roiling brew I was accustomed to. For whatever reason, the head appeared to be much whiter this time. The brew looked the same, heck it even smelled the same. What struck me as odd was the taste. Or better yet, what taste?!?! This beer had literally no taste! I could barely pick out any flavor as this was incredibly watered down. I was utterly shocked to be honest. It was still very creamy and had a good mouthfeel, and the little-to-no taste made it very drinkable, but man, was this a different experience than the can.  Someone once told me if you buy Guinness, make sure it's in the can. +1 to that. Don't bother with the bottles.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,DmanGTR,2.62,"The Nitro bottle version:  A - poured from the bottle into a pint glass, yielding a dark brown/black body with a very scant off white creamy head that receded into a cap. wtf?  S - faint roasted malts, cocoa, cream, and a very light waft of hops.  T - the taste followed the smell and was also very dumbed-down.  M - medium bodied and lightly carbonated with the ""widget"", a tad watery  D - eh, go with the can or on tap  Overall - this isn't Guinness. If you want a good version of the Draught style, get it on tap. If you want good Guinness, get the Extra Stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Unfortunately, other than the appearance, there's not much exceptional about this brew. Nose and flavor are very mild, smooth dry roasted flavor. Not a lot going on.

I still enjoy the beer on the rare occasion that I order it now, but there are much better beers out there. The appearance was a nearly opaque black color. The head was medium sized and stayed around for a while--minimal lacing. It smelled of malts and cardboard. The taste was slightly bland. It tasted of chocolate and coffee. The carbonation was perfect, but it was slightly watery. Its also a decently drinkable beer, but I crave a better beer while I drink Guinness Draught.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The smell is milder than would be expected. Not much too it. That dry stout smell taste is... mild and too watery for a stout. It tastes pretty good but it really has no depth/substance. It's a one trick pony with no aftertaste or any flavor layers to speak of. What flavor this is can be quite enjoyable though. Mouthfeel is not good. VERY watery feeling. No body at all. The carbonation is very low. Feels like bleech. I could still see myself drinking quite a bit of this though, while it isn't deep or in any way exceptional, it can be enjoyable for what its worth. Low alcohol content also helps.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,sgoodship,3.61,"Picked this up at the JewelOsco grocery store on Des Plaines & Fulton in Chicago. Was using it to make a beef stew in the slow cooker.  A: Those widgets are so annoying. You hardly get the top popped and it shoots it's load. Typical jet black guinness look with big white fine creamy head. Not much in the lacing department but I do like that a small head stays throughout and gives you a creamy milk mustache. I love that classic settling that Guinness does. You have to admit that it is a good looking drink.  S: Typical dry, sour Guinness smell. A little sweeter than the Extra Stout. It always reminds me of that stale brewery smell. It's almost got a hint of vinegar to it.  T: It is dry as a cork which is what the style is all about. The dryness is almost like a red wine level of dry. It may not be the best stout in the world but I think it is often reviewed as if it is an English or American Stout and not it's unique style. It's all malt and a little smokey when it warms up. Generally, it's pretty subtle.  M: Nice and smooth. Not as full a beer as you would imagine. Can feel quite thin at times. Carbonation and bitterness adds a little interest.  D: Guinness is a very nostalgic brew for me. I fondly remember having it in Ireland and I don't care what anyone says, it does taste better there. It is a gateway beer and for that reason alone, I think it deserves more respect than it gets. It's a pretty subtle drink that can be pounded. I know that from experience as a kid.

209,754,LilBeerDoctor,2.34,"Reviewed on 8/15/08. Time to finally rate this beer. Pours black with the classic light tan head. Aroma of stale wheat (oddly enough).

Appearance: Bartender poured it perfectly, letting it sit for a while after 3/4 was poured. yielded a thick rich creamy head that widdeled down to a small foam topping for the duration of the drinking. Very dark color, but somewhat translucent.  Smell: very tight on the nose, not a whole lot more than roasted malty and nutty, coffee and dark chocolate aromas.  Taste: Not too bad. Moderately full beer with more expressive tastes than aromas but much less diverse. Only molasses and dark malty flavors came through.  Mouthfeel: For a stout, its pretty thin. Until I got into beers the premonition about this beer was that it was a meal in a can when in actuality its thinner than some IPAs.. a little dissapointing when taking such note of its texture.  Drinkability: I'll continue to drink this beer. Its amazing with desserts and even by itself. Moderately priced and available almost everywhere.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Bubbles from the carbonation stick to the insides of the glass and linger. Foam paints the sides of the glass as the creamy head hangs on, and beer ring lacing remains as well.  S: Yeast and malt.  T: Bitter hops and creamy malt.  M: Real hoppiness hits the tastebuds and hangs around for the aftertaste. Leaves a kind of creamy coating in the mouth. Feels light.  D: Good taste, drinks light.

A- The classic cascading bubbles of carbonation leave a 1 finger tan head that never really falls and leaves all sorts of sticky spots on the glass. The body was a very dark brown, nearing black.  S- Light tones of milk chocolate and waeak coffee are mixed with a slight citrus hop aroma. Roasted malts come out with a little warmth.  T- It had some pretty good roasty flavor that became a little aggressive the further into the glass that I went. There were some sweet chocolate tones and a lighter hop profile.  M- It seemed really watery. The light carbonation was good, but the body seemed to be lacking.  D- I could easily drink a bunch in a single sitting.

S: Almost couldn't smell nything from this beer. The only thing I think I've smell was some weird metallic odor, odd.  T: Totally a disgrace to the stout genre. The roasted malts do not taste here, completely tamed (aka dead). Nothing interesting here really, except the fact it doesn't have a shitty aftertaste. Metallic taste again.  M: More watery that you could imagine a stout be. Really the most watered down stout I have ever drank. Giving it a 2 because it has some nice creamy characteristics.

The flavor is slight and unoffensive. It's mostly the flavor of roast. When there are only macros on tap, this is the one I go for. Certainly nothing stellar here, but this beer will save your life if you find yourself at a dive bar. If you find that not even this is available at a bar, order whiskey.

209,754,WalrusJockey,2.01,"Nitro-can into a pint glass. Sound when I cracked open the can completely freaked me out, sounded like the damned thing might explode.  Appearance- I think the whole world knows what Guinness looks like: ""black"" (though I've seen much blacker beers) with a creamy, off-white head. The head fades unforgivably fast for a beer that is so invested in having one, and leaves precious little lacing to show it was ever there.  Smell- malty smell, but no depth; nothing beyond a very generic malted smell. The can advises ""drink ice cold,"" and the colder it got, the less smell it had at all.  Taste- I think when I first had Guinness I was around 14, I found it rich and flavorful and interesting; a complete departure from other beers. Now I find it to taste like tap water, with a malt presence on the swallow, and an unpleasant malty-tapwater aftertaste. I was drinking this outside, in the bellow-freezing weather, and as the Guinness got colder, it did become more enjoyable, but that was because the taste faded away almost completely.  Mouthfeel- thin. Very thin. Very similar to water in the mouth. As it got colder, the texture became more creamy, but nothing approaching the weight and silkiness of cream. More like skim milk that was watered down. Very bad.  Drinkability- quaffable, but not especially enjoyable. I remember enjoying Guinness, and knew it was average but tonight it seemed far, far below average. To be honest, I didn't completely finish the can, and I think I might give away the other two cans from the 4-pack. It was that bland.  Summary- They aren't kidding about ""ice cold,"" the only way this beer is reasonable is almost frozen. That said, I was pretty disappointed at the change from how I remembered it in my youth. I guess I'll have to pick up some Extra Stout and see if that is at least Ok.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,LunaChick,2.53,I'm not one for giving bad reviews. Tough reviews sure. This is horrible. And not at all what I remember. I remember a lush black beer full of roasted malts and clean bitterness that drank like a meal and made me happy. This beer pours sable. When held to light I can see from one side of the glass to the other. There is the typical 2.5 finger head that retains well and laces the glass. Ok that's about it. The smell is metalic. Coppery. Followed by artificial sweetness. The flavor begins follows and ends a watery mess of diacatyl and burnt sugar. No body. Even with the rich head there is no more to this beer than the glass of water I have next to it. Drinkability? The metalic taste in the smell becomes overpowering. It drinks like medecine. What a shame.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,GordonQuid,3.12,"Poured a jet black with cascading turbidity producing a firm one inch tan head. Poured from a nitro ""widget"" can to a freshly washed Guiness pint glass.  Aroma is that of fresh biscuit, very slight roasted barley present as well.  The taste is full bodied, creamy and smooth. Bitterness comes from the roasty malts then finishes mild with some slight lingering hop aftertaste. Pleasant and appetizing.  Full bodied but very drinkable. Guiness Draught is my home session beer. Always good on tap, easy going down and low in alcohol.  I would pair a Guiness with a hot ruben sandwich on rye bread, a deli pickle and home style chips.

Both looked about the same in the glass (once settled) with a massive rich foamy head on top (the Beamish a bit more tan and the Guinness more gray) and a deep brown to black (with ruby highlights) below. Little carbonation visible. Smell was similar, just a touch of smoky malts. Initial tastes were quite different. Beamish was smooth in the mouth, with a well balanced, drinkable mix of malt flavors and a hint of sweetness that made it very easy to drink--top to bottom. The Guinness was similar, but with a bit more hops bitterness that soon turned to a metallic hint of alcohol as it warmed.

M - Creamy head, but the beer itself is much thinner than you would expect by looking at it.  D - The smooth taste and low ABV means you can easily down several pints.

Overall not a strong flavor in this beer, but not offensive in any way. Would be a good starting point for those unfamiliar with dark, more strongly flavored beers.  M - The head feels incredibly creamy as though it was whipped. The beer itself has a decent feel to it, though lacking a little bit. Low carbonation, almost thin, not substantial. Really smooth, however, and could drink a fair amount of it. Very nice in that fashion, and would call it a plus.  D - Very high drinkability with this one.

It was a fairly inoffensive and thin brew and there are much better examples of the style out there.

Eventually the suddy head comes to a standstill, with about a finger and a half of retention. The brew really soaps the sides of this glass. Though it excels in its classic appearance, it really fails when it comes to aromatics. I'm really not picking up any prominent notes, just some faint ale yeast.  This meal in a can is more fast food drive through than first class. Not very prominent in flavor, the palete is primarily burnt coffee. Brew is smooth throughout, with some gentle viscosity and a nice feeling body.  Guinness is generally my go to at macro bars, when it's winter, and there are no other options. I wouldn't say I dislike the beer, though I don't love it, as you always know what you're getting.

Taste is deep dark malty and sweet with a nice touch of bitter hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is silky smooth with a slight drying effect on the palate.

209,754,ljbrisson,3.77,"Pours black into a pint glass out of a nitro can, with a beautiful, pillowy, off-white head, with great retention and leaving prodigious lacing. For me, the strongest point of a Guinness is the way that it looks. Aroma seems as if it is trapped underneath the fluffy head, is of roasted grain and a bit of coffee. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth but very light, with almost no carbonation, goes down very easily. Taste is of wood, coffee notes, and a roasted grain flavor toward the finish.  This is a difficult beer for me to rate as it was my gateway beer and I will always have a special place for it. Despite my introduction to craft beer, a cold Guinness straight from the tap is still one of the most satisfying beer-drinking experiences I can think of. However, I will try, as always, to rate the beer based on how the beer represents the style, and what the brewer intended the beer to taste like, and, to a weighted degree, my personal preference - not just any one of the aforementioned aspects.

209,754,Seanv,3.5,"Can. Pours a dark body with about a one inch thick head. Not a lot of aroma, some sweet malts and that's about it. Not a whole lot of flavor either. Some malts and a tad bit of caramel if you really dig. Medium body. Light but full mouth feel. The most refreshing beer out there.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BigBen61,3.26,"One of the first beers that I wanted to try. I am actually a bit dissapointed.  Appearance was good. Everyone who has seen a Guinness knows that part of the attractiveness is the contrast of the dark (nearly black) beer coupled with the creamy white head. The pour may have been the problem at the bar where I had this because the head was relatively short. This is the only reason it didn't score higher.  The smell was a bit weak for my tastes. I felt like the roasted malt should jump out at me. I could detect a faint smoky sweetness and almost no hops whatsoever.  The taste was good, not great. I had expected a smoother creamier beer. What I got was something that seemed to be a bit bland with notes of charcoal and roasted grain.  The mouthfeel was my favorite part of this beer aside from appearance. It reminded me of a good rootbeer pulled from tap. Very little carbonation, very smooth and soft.  Althought I didn't like it enough to order another I can definately see how you could drink a ton of this stuff. Its smoothness coupled with its easy taste could make for a looong night (or morning depending on your tastes).",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,mugglesandhops,2.92,"I have drank this many many times. the bottle is not the way to go. they tell you to drink straight from the bottle, which is stupid. off tap or from can to glass is one thing but this is a flat, lack-luster guinness at it's best. I do not recomend this from the bottle",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,cnally,3.51,"the beer that casuals think is really good beer. and while it is not terrible, it merely passes as ok.  the look is deep and black, and of course the cascading head is beautiful.  a nutty, smoky smell eminates from the beer, oaky amd woodsy.  the taste is burnt caramel and very nondescript. balanced but unassuming, unimpressive but inoffensive.  the feel is milky and heavy.  well, i'll drink it. but I may not be totally excited about it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,harley101,4.75,"I cant get enough of this beer, its delightful in every way. I loved everything from its almost black color to the way it smells of chocolate and coffee.

I would fly to ireland just to taste it freshly poured from a local pub ;)",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Goliath,2.71,"Pours a very dark brown, black through the center, with amber edges. Huge cascading effect on the pour producing a half inch creamy light tan head. Looks marshmallows in cocoa on top. Good retention.  The aroma is alright. Slightly roasty with a bit of chocolate and coffee.  The taste is ok. Fairly weak, but a bit of old coffee comes through with a touch of bitterness and not a whole lot more.  The mouthfeel kind of sucks. It's medium bodied, but feels watery. I'm usually a fan of more of a still mouthfeel, but this feels flat basically, probably because the body is so thin. But it's slightly creamy which is nice.  Drinkability is moderate. It's easy to consume, but it's really not that great. It lacks depth of flavor and important aspects of body. It's certainly sessionable, but I'd be too bored to drink more than one. I always remembered liking Guinness and wondered why everyone slammed the Nitro Bottle so much, and now I think I've figured out why.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It had the waterfall effect in the beer which is totally impressive with the little bubbles that trickle down from the top. Some are drawn back by the dark black motor oil look with the thick creamy head but not me. I love Irish Dry Stouts - they're my favorite. Smells of heavy roast and that is exactly what you first taste as it hits your tongue. However, you do get a slight tin flavor which is slightly odd. Full thick head stays with the glass all the way down. Mmmm, ""barkeep - pour me another"".",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Klunco,4.14,"Served on tap in an imperial Guinness tulip glass. Guinness holds a special place in my heart as it was the first beer I genuinely liked. It's a great standby when only BMC taps are at a bar, and is easy to drink and sessionable.  A note about Guinness, it is my opinion that this beer gets fouled up by more bars than any other beer out there and this is the reason for most peoples disappointment with it. It's not the greatest stout out there, but is a lot better than some of these ratings particularly if you get it at a reputable place. When people talk about how great it is in Ireland, freshness is a factor, but also the fact that it is so prominent there, most pubs know how to keep the nitrous level correct, the kegs are emptied often, and the two part pour is done almost everywhere. All three of these things make a difference and I've been to way too many bars in America where, often, the Guinness is stale, not served in the right glass, and poured straight down in one single opening of the tap.  I'll be reviewing this from a bar that does it right: turns over enough Guinness that it is fresh, serves in the tulip glass, does the two part pour, and keeps the lines clean.  A - A classic. Looks like a supersized shot of espresso. Black with a beautifully creamy tan head that lasts forever. Served in a clean glass beautiful foam rings form as the beer goes down.  S - This is where Guinness lacks the most IMO. A bit of roasted malt comes through along with dark chocolate and coffee notes. No presence of hops.  T - Creamy, balanced, and easy to drink. A roasted malty flavor comes through along with hints of vanilla extract and coffee notes. Finishes with a short lived bitter roasted flavor.  M - Another area where Guinness excels. Perfectly creamy mouthfeel that isn't abrasive like CO2. Very easy to drink because of the mouthfeel.  D - A great session beer. Sure there are stouts with more flavors, but Guinness is widely available and it's mild mannered flavor makes it easy to drink as many as you'd like (One night I had 8 imperial pints in a row) without getting as full as I would have with other beers. Alcohol level is low so it keeps you standing and Guinness is calorically low which never hurts and makes it a good option instead of a typical light beer. I could drink this from 10 am on and all day on a rainy day and often have. The only killer is how many bars screw this beer up.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,TMinton22,4.5,"Love this beer, had my first one with my dad who was turned on by it after a trip to Ireland. Although told no where near the quality as having one over there.

209,754,coldmeat23,3.21,"GLASS: Boddingtons Imperial Pint Glass TEMP: Cellared @ approx 45 degrees  Guinness is one of the world's most beautiful beers. The so dark that it's almost black liquid, with it's dark ruby highlights. The reverse cascade of the bubbles. The three finger creamy tan head. All of those features are reproduced in this nitro can, thanks to the widget, I suppose. Looks like it's just drawn, off of a tap.  Smells dark and malty. Slight coffee notes mix with chocolate, to a lesser extent. Not alot going on in the nose, actually.  Can you say disappointment? Wow! This tastes just like Guinness, only weaker! This tastes like a mix of 2 parts Guinness and 1 part water. you can tell that beer elements are in there, but they are so watered down that it's hard to find them.  Guinness is supposed to be a big, thick, creamy brew. This (can) is a pale imitation of those qualities.  This might have use as a stepping stone for getting someone to come over from BMC products into craft beers. Other than that, I think it's a waste, personally.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It's a decent beer though, I'll prolly have a a craving later for another",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Its color was black, with red around the sides of the glass. The head stayed for the entire drink, with great lacing. You could taste a hint of coffee and strong dark chocolate (very toasty, I could feel my stomach warm!), and a very nice woody flavour left on the palate. A classic pub favourite, and for good reason. cheers!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,CampusCrew,3.5,"I love Guinness but there are better options. Very Dark and chocolatley stout and goes great with hearty stews and works well for cooking. Guinness in America is good, but try it in the UK. It's a dream. I'm going to rate it as I normally drink here in the US. The only thing I don't like about Guinness is the slight negative aftertaste which I didn't taste when I was traveling overseas.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Aroma of burnt coffee grinds and hints of chocolate. Taste is on par with the nose. Roasted coffee, dry baker's chocolate, slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is what gets to me on this one. It's thin and watery, not much in the way of flavor. I prefer the Extra Stout to the Draught, personally, but I could drink several of these in one sitting on nitro-tap. Maybe I should have drank this from the bottle as it insisted. After a few minutes, the beer became flat and watery which took away from the overall taste. Not very pleasing.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

However, there's just something about a Guinness that makes my heart warm.  The overwhelming advertising campaign that Guinness has launched over the years has been effective in getting many lousy, cheap beer drinkers to get out of their comfort zones. So, I applaud Guinness for making the world a better place.  To me, the only thing more satisfying than watching a Guinness settle is consuming it. The smooth taste is comforting. While I would say there are other beers out there that are more worthy of the ""brilliant"" accolade, Guinness will always have a special place in my heart.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Jeffo,3.42,"Got this on tap at Mick's, a great Irish pub in the center of Utrecht.  Pulled from a nitro into a pint glass.  APPEARANCE: Wonderful cascading effect after the pour. Settles pitch black with a thick, dense, creamy one finger white head. Zero carbonation evident. Laces beautifully down the sides, leaving rings, and head is very persistent until the end. Lovely and unique looking.  SMELL: Hard to get anything through the thick armored head. Roasted barley malt of course. Slight tinge of coffee with a smoky component. Cream too. Nice, but tough to get.  TASTE: The taste is way more evident than the smell. Same components in the taste, roasted malt, smoke and coffee, but the coffee is stronger and it's more pronounced. A bit of tobaco there as well. Minimal aftertaste.  PALATE: Medium body and creamy as well. Head adds a great feel on the lips when drinking. Minimal carbonation gives it a thick water feel. Perhaps a slight bit more carbonation would give it more of a thick beer feel. Goes down smooth and finishes super dry.  OVERALL: This beer is definately drinkable. Its low ABV means you can drink it all night, and that nothing is overpowering means you'll never get sick of it. Definatley sessionable, and I've sessioned it many times. Tastes and feels nice, is a pleasure to look at, and goes down very nicely. On the other hand, I could see how some might find it too dull and weak after a few pints, and want to move on to something else. In the end though, I find it to be a great session brew off the tap.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Actually seems a bit thin in the flavor department, but certainly not offensive.  Mouthfeel - Creamy start, but finishes oddly watery. Carbonation not noticeable.  Drinkability - It's Guinness, how could you hate it. I certainly don't, but I can't say it's as good as I once believed. It is better than a macrolager and since it's ubiquitous even a bad beer bar will have this and probably give you a glass if you order one.

D: I could drink one easily, but probably not a second.  Definitely get Guinness if it's between Guinness and a watery American macrobrew. If it's between Guinness and another stout, go for the other stout. Unfortunately, the former choice is the one you will have at many US bars.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,Rennpferd,4.21,"Poured ice cold from a nitro can into an Imperial Pint.  It poured super creamy and full of layering activity. A nice dark body formed under the nitro creamed layer and a nice two finger velvet cream head formed after everything simmered down.  It smelled of rich roasted malt and had a nice coffee undertone that seemed to have an undertone of toffee all of it's own.  A pronounced taste of roasted malt, a hint of coffee. The coffee tones were very subdued and enhanced the roasted malt instead of overpowering it. It was smooth and creamy. Very nice.  This is a great beer to sit back with on a hot evening and enjoy. I like to milk these in order to enjoy the changing characteristics as it warms.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,Bobo77,3.38,"From a nitro can with the widget inside. Contains 125 calories, that's only 30 more than Michelob Ultra so I wonder if it has more flavor.  The can makes an almost explosive cracking when opened. As an aside, make sure you have your glass ready and right next the can because the nitro cans will really blast beer everywhere; I always open mine over the sink. Poured down the center of my glass making an almost picture perfect triple layer of color ranging from coffee color at the bottom with medium brown bubbles rushing up to a gorgeous thick grey head. The head is staying for over a minute solid.  The nose reveals a pleasant aroma of biter cocoa and almost, I want to say, Bailey's Irish Cream in there or even Kahlua (which in my book is not a bad a scent to have.)  Now the mouthfeel, if I were to judge this on the basis of the head I would have to rate it easily a 4. The head is almost like whipped cream. However, the body of the beer leaves something to be desired. There is almost zero carbonation. I don't think that it's supposed to be this way or if it is just the nitro can, but I think I remember Boddington's nitro cans being this way too. The body definately drags the rating of the mouthfeel down.  The taste is of bitter chocolate, cream, and buttery notes. I would even say butterscotch would be a better description. I poured the rest of the can into my mug and sip a little more. The head is now lumpy and their appears to be a good amount of sticky lacing down the inside of the mug. More taste, this is beer is made with hops but only enough to balance and they are obviously difficult to notice due to the bitter cocoa and coffee flavors that the beer presents. There is so much bitter, roasted malt flavor going on here that one hardly notices the alcohol, not surprising I suppose since Stouts are typically lower in alcohol. There is unfortunately a metallic taste, I am not sure again if it is due to the can or the widget, but it is there and it does detract slightly from the beer.  Everything considered, while this is far from perfect it is a good solid beer when in the mood for something dark and bitter.

Pours out jet black. Off the tap, it needs to be poured, then left alone for a little, then topped off, because the head is massive out of the tap. Creamy colored head retains for nearly the entire duration of one drinking it.  Terrific roasted smells and a hint of chocolate. Taste is wonderful. Very creamy, and with the roasted flavors, it has a very thick taste. The malts and hops are very well balanced, but interestingly enough, not very present in this beer, as the roasted flavors and textures will be the more noticeable characteristics.  Often joked about, but very true, Guinness is a very thick and heavy beer. There are considerably heavier stouts from other microbreweries, but Guinness is up there.

I don't want to say Guinness is bland, but in a sense it really is.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,danny013,3.24,"Havn't had this one in a while. I wasn't too impressed the last few times I had this brew but someone brought me some so what the hey.  11.2 oz. nitro bottle poured into a English style pint glass. 'Serve Extra Cold.' OK...Nice hard pour gives an always exciting nitro cascade that develops into a thick, dense khaki-colored head that sticks to the sides of the glass and stays for the whole brew. Color is a nice dark black with hints of amber/mahogany around the edges. Overall, a very nice looking beer, perhaps even the 'classic' looking stout; I can't gig it on the appearance.  Smell is of roasted barley, some dark chocolate and coffee hints with a bit of standard 'tang'. Some hop presence holds everything together.  Taste...light and not too complex. Some malty chocolate and coffee flavors up front with some sourness as that fades a bit. Following that the grainy roasted flavors come in to round out the brew. Roasted grains linger on the palate, hops gently roll in to blend nicely with the roasted bitterness. Seems to get a bit more 'watery' as it warms up.  Mouthfeel is somewhat dissapointing. While it is deliciously creamy, the body feels way too light, almost watery.  Drinkability is decent. Very smooth and goes back well. At 4.2% ABV you can enjoy a few and not be out of it.  Overall, it is a decent stout. Certainly, it has been marketed and changed to appeal to the more 'common' beer drinker, but at it's core it is still a stout. There are many better examples out there but I suppose it still has a place in my and my other peoples hearts as the 'classic' stout. It is the beer that got me into good ales, so I have to thank it for that. I'll probably end up keeping a few around the house just to have for an easy drinker.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,diabecktic,3.15,"Appearance: The head formation, retention, and lacing are all excellent. The color is also jet black. I suppose it looks like your standard stout should look like. There's not too much carbonation in the form of bubbles, but you can see the head kind of rise upwards as if it were evaporating (or something like that).  Smell: Roasted barley seems to be the predominant aroma, though there is a very, very slight hint of toffee. Overall, it's quite bitter. There really isn't a defining smell to this beer, but what's present isn't necessarily ""bad.""  Taste: Again, the main flavor seems to be roasted barley. It's pretty bitter, though the aftertaste somewhat resembles (burnt?) coffee. For the most part it seems kind of ""bready"" and not really unique.  Mouthfeel: Due to the head retention, it's quite creamy and relatively thick. It's not as ""chunky"" as other stouts may be, but it's nice to swallow.  Drinkability: You must sip on this; I know many people might say it's watery, but the one that I had at the time of reviewing wasn't really that watery. It wasn't incredibly thick either, but it was definately not watery. Regardless, it's pretty good but not excellent.  Summary: This is what most people think of when they think ""stout."" It's not the greatest one I've ever had - especially from within Guinness itself. There are much better varieties of just this type, and stouts in general. However, it's not that bad either. I guess I would just consider this one to be ""average."" The ""draught"" that's actually on (nitro?) tap is better than the ""draught"" that's sold in the bottle. Neither of them are nearly as good as the Guinness Extra Stout, and even that's not the absolute best that I've ever had (though it's considerably better than this one).",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,barleywinefiend,3,"Poured a deep, deep brown that was somewhat sluggish and slow to pour. Small tannish head. Nose was burnt barley and coffee. Taste was roasty, espresso and smooth but thin. The carbonation is ok, but the body is far too watery for a stout. Not nearly as good as tap.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,TheViceBlog,3.45,"I used to drink Guinness a lot when I was a younger lad but now not so much. Maybe it's cause I don't have as many Irish friends as I used to. Thick and milky but not as potent and heavy as I recall. I used to think myself a badass for polishing off five of these during a happy hour. Now I realize at 4.2% that wasn't much of a feat. Quite frankly, I don't find the beer that tasty or flavorable any more. No hops, no bite, and thus very drinkable. Probably why it was so beloved during my salad drinking days. Nowadays, I think I might enjoy drinking this more for the memories, the aesthetic, and the process than for anything else. I enjoy watching the bartender use the slow two-step process to pull it. I'm tickled when a cloverleaf is swirled into the top of the head to finish the pour off. But I don't really love this beer any more. And, I'm certainly not one of those American douchebags who visited Dublin once during their junior year of college and now will spend the next 70 years of their drinking lives telling any one that will listen how much better Guinness is in Dublin. How us dumb Americans get a poorer quality product than they do across the pond. How we drink it too cold here. Or too hot. Or in the wrong, wrong, very wrong glass! How our stupid bartenders don't even pour it correctly! DAMN, that one week in Dublin was awesome! You Yanks just don't get it!!!  Aaron www.theviceblog.com",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Coffee, slight hop bitterness and a touch of cream.  M- This is my favorite part of the beer. Mildly carbonated and very creamy.

209,754,schanker21,2.17,"Guinness Draught is the joke of all stouts. Its appearance is its only saving grace as it is quite dark and leaves a good-sized, long-lasting head, which also leaves some good lacing. Once you get past that, there's not much good to be said. Smells like a watered-down stout and it tastes like one too. Honestly, where is the taste in this? Especially when compared with its Extra Stout brother, this one is just weak. For me, it's even hard to finish one just because it's so watered-down. Dear Guinness, please make Extra Stout your standard style.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,MayorAdamWest,3.41,"Appearance - Slight ruby hew when held to the light. Thick head that dissipates slowly. Lacing remains throughout the pint.  Smell - Slightly watered down. Hints of coffee and chocolate malts. Little to no hops notes.  Taste - Bitter coffee and dark chocolate notes...not as heavy as most stouts. Flavor quickly evaporates from your palette, leaving behind that watered down feeling from the smell.  Mouthfeel - Silky smooth. Can't say much more than that really. So smooth that it glides down almost.  Drinkability - This is an entry level stout. Not bad, but certainly not as full-bodied as one would hope from the most famous of all stouts. At 4.1% ABV it makes a great session beer...and at 125 calories per 12oz it isn't filling. Personally, I'll stay with Imperial Stouts if I have a choice...if not Guinness is a good standby. Even if I do have problems with their unethical business practices and treatment of the Irish people.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,OtherShoe2,2.58,"Proper pour from nitro can into a pint glass. Nice, dense creamy head and bubbly cascading brown-turning-black body of the drink.  Smell is not a factor here, as there isn't much to work with.  You actually have 2 parts of the beverage to taste here. First, the head -- creamy, mild roasted grain that coats your tongue and lips, and dominates the flavors of the rest of the brew. The rest is a carbonized grain flavor, nothing else really.  A stout for non-stout drinkers. Sad -- as it is not like the stuff you get in Dublin. These are very easy drinking, as they lack much character at all. And, if you are unfortunate to have one poured where the head is non-existent, you miss the most pleasing, dominant flavors. Wow, am i giving a thumbs down to a legend? Not really -- I'd still drink this over Bud any day, but this represents a sad example of the true nature of the original.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Smell was not really there light coffee roast and sweet malt, but very faint.  I am not impressed with the taste at all, it is not a strong flavored beer, it seems a little too weak on flavor. I tasted a lot of malt and it ended with a slight roast.  The feel is alright needs a bit more carbonation or less malt, too watery for me.  Could put back a few but really wouldn't want to. Could get something much better.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Appearance: Very very dark brown with a thick tan head that stays present the entire time with lacing all the way through.  Smell: Very vague smell of coffee and chocolate but what threw me off was that there was also a slightly present metallic smell. I attribute this to the can it was poured from.  Taste: Coffee and chocolate with some mild bitterness and the same slight metallic character from the smell.  Mouthfeel: Not what I expected. I expected a much thicker mouthfeel however I was not unhappy with what I got. It was slightly watery but what made up for it was the mild carbonation.  Drinkability: I don't know if I'd come running back to this, especially if there are other Irish Stouts available but given the selection at the place that I got this, it was probably the best I was going to do anyway. All In all I'd say it was a decent beer but nothing remarkable.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Finishes bitter as well, something similar to burnt toast.  M - Extremely smooth and low carbonation.  D - Easy to get down due to mouthfeel, but the flavor isn't something I want to experience for hours on end.

Definitely give Guinness a try on-tap before making judgment.  This Guinness was great. The brew was completely black with a finger-length white head. The composition between the two was perfect -- it was so even and exact that it looked fake. I couldn't stop staring. The beer had a roasted, dry taste, just what you would expect from a Guinness. The head lasted all the way to the last sip, and provided the perfect creaminess to balance the dryness.

Not robust or anything, but still decent. Feel is creamy with a light body and very smooth. Still, the feel is a bit watery, which really detracts from the flavor.

Then I heard that the closer one gets to where Guinness is brewed, the better it tastes, like melted butter.

Tastes, watery...compared with other, bigger craft stouts, this is almost like water. I can taste the roast flavors but just barely. It is very smooth and very drinkable.

If you have not had a Guinness Draught then get out of that cave you are living in and go get one. You may or may not care for it, but I feel the majority of people that try one, would have it again.

T - The overall bitterness dominates the flavor. Roasted flavors are strong and bitter. A light coffee flavor starts to come in about midway. Then the flavor just kind of stops.

Hops are there as a balance, not too pronounced, but enough there as to clean up the palate.  Thick, soft mouthfeel with a very slight ""fizz"" character that pairs very well with the flavor and character of the beer.

Head stays the whole beer and lacing all the way down.  smell was not special, dark malts and alcohol.  if you just hold the beer in your mouth it tastes just like water - all flavor comes from the back of the tongue - nothing but dark bitter malts, but a well balanced bitterness.  mouth feel honestly reminds me of water.  drinkability is average - relatively low abv and water mouth feel means it can keep flowing for quite some time.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Moxley,3.91,"Poured from a 12 oz. nitro-bottle into a small pilsner glass - thanks once again to my good friend hyland24. You're the best Hy!  A - This is a good lookin' beer. I love the way it looks like a creamy coffee dessert drink swirling around as the thick creamy head settles to a solid 1 inch. The head sticks around till the end with good lacing throughout.  S - Lots of caramel and coffee with a faint malty aroma.  T - I got a sweet caramel flavor at first with coffee and malt coming through on the finish.  M&D - Despite the thick creamy head and opaque black body, this beer goes down smooth and not too heavy. The low ABV content makes this a good session beer and a perfect choice for those who like a full bodied, full flavored stout that's not too bitter or strong.  I liked this a lot. I look forward to having the real thing in Ireland some day.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

S: Roasted malts, slight coffee.  T: Just like the smell, the roasted malts come through with a hint of nuttiness, with a somewhat bitter aftertaste.  MF/D: As an Irishman, I feel I'm obliged to include Guinness in my reviews, generally because whenever I'm in a bar and someone meets me, they automatically assume it's my beer of choice. It's a decent beer, one I've enjoyed many times, but not my favourite stout by a long shot. As most on here probably know, the notion that Guinness is ""a meal in a glass"" is ridiculous, and most stouts are lighter than a lot of beers, so you don't expect a lot of volume, but it's a little watery for me, and I personally am not a fan of the slightly bitter flavour. For a more enjoyable example of Irish stout, I'd go with Murphys.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

T: Like the smell, malts, coffee, with some chocolate. Finish is a nice semisweet  M&D: While the pour suggests otherwise, quite thin, but still nice and smooth. Light carbonation doesn't upset the smoothness. Light enough to enjoy a few of these.

Taste is of light, roasted malts, a little lingering flavor of roastedness but not much going on here. I still enjoy but not as good as from draft.

Smell is weak all around, but there's a bit of roasted maltyness to pick up.  There's some roasted malt flavors going on in the taste, maybe a slight tough of caramel. All-in-all the taste isn't incredibly exciting or complex, but is reliable.  Very smooth, though somewhat thin, feeling in the mouth, and very easily drinkable.  Though some people seem to think Guinness isn't what it used to be, it's still a staple and certainly my mainstream beer of choice (that is, of the beers you can get a place like Chili's or Applebee's, Guinness seems to be the best offer).

Picture perfect. When the dust settles it leaves behind a swirled maze of fine carbonation that clings to the glass. Wears a creamy inch tall hat of light-tan foam that refuses to disapate. Lacing is mild, it's more clingy on the edges of the head. When you lift the glass to your lips there will be a foil of bubbles clinging to the glass.  The glass emits a roastytoasty malt characteristic which fuses with dark and unground coffee beans. It's surprisingly light in my opinion, considering the prominent and confident appearance.  I consider this booze mildly bitter and semi-complex. Nothing offensive here in the taste besides the before-mentioned watery characteristic. The roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, burnt bread, and somewhat dry taste make it hard for you to seperate eachother as they gently float over the tongue. Aftertaste does linger, a heavy bitter flavor sits on the back of the tongue.  Drinkability although is high since the surprisingly light nature here. Still don't know the rules on it but i'd consider this a session beer personally.  Irish Car Bombs, anyone?",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

S- Hints of roasted malt, hints of coffee with a slight bitter smell.  T- Very nice roasted malt/barley taste, with hints of coffee and chocolate.

209,754,GreenCard,4.09,"Myth: Guinness in Ireland tastes better than anywhere else.  Confirmed! After extensive research over a three-day weekend in 2007 in which I tasted it at the Guinness Brewery Museum as well as several pubs across town, I can confirm that Guinness does, in fact, taste better IN Ireland. It's a bit more complex and there's a background sweetness that really rounds it out. So silky smooth and absolutely scrumptious!  Appearance: ruby-mahogany-black, good clarity (around the edges of the otherwise opaque brew), thick creamy layer of fine-beaded tan head, great head retention, lots of lace  Aroma: brown sugar, coffee, burnt grain, baker's chocolate, Lyle's Golden syrup  Flavor: gentle malt sweetness with hints of burnt caramel, chocolate, dark molasses sugar, and weak coffee; unripe pear hop flavor; finishes semisweet with a smoothly bitter aftertaste  Mouthfeel: medium-full body, silky-smooth soft texture, moreish as hell",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,burnstar,3.01,Pours black with a nice dense persistant head. Pretty typical for a nitro- but good. Aroma is sweet with a roasted note. Taste is very mild roasted malt. Not a lot going on but not bad. Lightly carbonated with surprisingly light mouthfeel. Fairly drinkable but not something I like to drink a lot of. I've had plenty of Guiness in my life- I used to really like it but I haven't had it for a while. Overall it's pretty average stuff and a decent commonly available beer.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,akorsak,3.69,"A 500 mL nitro can that my sister brought back from the St. James Gate brewery in Dublin.  A: The can opens with a fizz as the nitro widget releases its gas. The agitation almost caused white head to peter out over the mouth of the can. A three step pour into a Guinness glass resulted in the magnificent visual bubbling effect. The stout's body was a dark red-black color, more reddish at the narrower points of the glass. Atop the black body was a white, slightly tan, head that stayed in place throughout the pint. Visually stunning, regardless of how it may taste.  S: The nose has creaminess from the nitrogen introduction along with a burnt toast aroma. The swirling mixture takes on a pleasant but thin sweetness.  T: The stout has a full taste but does come up short at times. As dark and heavy as it looks, it is quite light. Burnt bread and chocolate flavors upfront mix with the creamy nitro foam. The thinness becomes apparent mid-sip as the burnt grains fade away and are not replaced by anything. A dry mouthfeel sees the beer away.  M: The mouthfeel is thin at times but the upfront mix of stout and nitro is pleasing sweet, in spite of its dryness. The lack of alcohol and overpowering malts also preserves the taste buds.  D: The ale is quite drinkable, with a sessionably low abv. It's not as robust as some stouts but it holds its own reasonably well.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

M/D: Medium to full bodied, I wouldn't call it thick at all. Drinkability is good, low ABV and not very filling.  I've had a lot of the 3 major dry stouts while I've been here in Ireland, and I would probably rank Guinness and Murphy's about neck and neck. Neither are as good as Beamish, but overall, all 3 are very similar, almost the same.

Unlike other stouts, this one is miserable once it warms up.  I am happy that this one uses nitrogen. There's certainly a market there that needs to expand.  Super fine head, dark tan. DecentRoasted malt in the nose, along with a bitter rice and funky hops.  Watery body, despite the dark color. Not what I was looking for. Bitter and coats my tounge with tobacco flavoring.

T = Matches the smell, distinct bitterness throughout with sweet doughy flavors at the front of the tongue but then followed with a bitter, coffee flavor.

209,754,drinksandeats,2.74,"Seeing as it is St. Patrick's Day, I figured I'd pop open a few cans of Guinness Draught to celebrate.  The pint can opened with a hiss, spilling some contents down its side. I poured to fill a pint glass to the three-quarter mark, and the tan foam appeared to flow downward into the jet black beer below. After a few minutes the thick head subsided, and I filled the glass to the top.  I stuck my nose a little too close to the glass, and came up with a touch of foam on my nose and a faint scent of roasted malt and, more faint, coffee. The beer felt like water in my mouth, with not much body to it. I tasted the roasted barley, again ever so faint, and not much else. As I downed the pint some moments were distinctly bitter, but most of the time flavor felt like it was being diluted with water and washed away.  The lack of body makes Guinness a great session beer. I know I had two more pints after the first. However, I'm of the school of thought that a good stout shouldn't be a candidate to be shotgunned or funneled, and I'd be perfectly happy doing either with Guinness Draught.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Taste - This tastes like Guinness Extra Stout with all the good flavours removed, leaving only bitterness, a bit of sweetness, and a crap aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Quite watery, pretty much no carbonation.  Drinkability - A weaker version of Guinness Extra Stout should be quite drinkable, but I wouldn't want a second.  Overall - 4 years ago, before I really liked beer, I thought Guinness Draught was overpoweringly bitter. Now I don't find anything about it overpowering, but it still tastes like crap. My can was imported from Ireland (some Australian Guinness is brewed under license), but it probably deteriorates signifcantly in transit.

Unmatched retention, the definition of lacing.  s: Light aroma of roasted malt. Maybe a touch of chocolate and coffee, but overall, the nose is pretty weak.  t: Well, there just isn't much taste, pretty watered down. Light roasted malt, kind of like a really weak iced coffee after all the ice has melted. Bitterness grows with warmth and time. Tastes like a watered down version of the extra stout version.  m: Thin, watery, but thanks to the nitro, it still remains creamy and velvety. Flows past your tongue.  d: Like most people, Guinness was my first ""dark"" beer. It is a great introduction beer for people scared of beer they can't see through. That's because while it may be dark, it is devoid of flavor and drinks like a light lager. Guinness is low in calories, low in alcohol, and is the wimpiest stout I have had. That being said, I can't help but love Guinness. It is still a remarkable beer. That pour, that cascade, that feeling when it hits you tongue, the ease with which it goes down, this is Guinness and nothing else is quite like it.

The aromas are very sharp and roasty of coffee, wheat, yeast, chocolate, and caramel. The colder it is, the more you can smell its chilled flavors. The taste is uniquely thin, especially for those flavors, with an overall dimension of bitter, coffee like sweetness. The mouthfeel helps perfect it, allowing the flavors to remain dry, thin and light. Overall, the draught of Guinness is very well known for a good reason. Very excellent.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Aromas are pretty subdued from the low abv.  Palate is on the sweetish side, got some sourish grain, little bit of roasted malt and some old coffee notes. Not exactly light on flavour but not heavy. Ends quick though. Super light body with low carbonation, goes down super easy, I find this very refreshing. Out of macro stuff this is the best choice by far.

S= nice but not startling; something reminding me of a laundry-starch in the scent (probably something in the hops variety), mild hops-bitter hints, a predominant scent of burnt malty nutty-ness.  T= a bit watery compared to the Extra Stout Original, of course-- this beer is designed to be more appealing to the general light-beer drinking US populace. On the other hand, it has much less belching-carbonation than the Original. Nice burnt nutty taste with mild hops bitters.  M= residual mild hops bitters, a slight creamy feel on the tongue, clean finish.  D= I could probably drink a lot more of these than the Extra Stout Original's, for various reasons listed above.

209,754,xare,2.18,"I remember drinking Guinness before they began bottling and canning it. It seems like it's gone downhill since then. This review is based on my latest pint from the pub from a nitro-tap.  Appearance is outstanding - there's really quite nothing like this - a dark black (really very dark ruby red) stout with a 2-3 finger creamy stout head that has nitro bubbles cascading throughout the glass. A perfectly poured Guinness has no comparison so far as appearance goes.  Smell - really hard to discern a smell but when I take a few deep inhales, I'm able to discern some malt and stout aromas but overall, quite hard for me to smell anything.  Taste - A bit tangy but not smooth. Doesn't have the same flavor it used to have. Disappointing. Wish it'd have the oatmeal flavor it used to have with a hint of creamy stoutiness in there.  Mouthfeel - Despite the appearance and despite the huge head, this pint did NOT have the creaminess that one expects from Guinness. For the older version of Guinness with the thick creaminess and bubbliness of nitro-bubbles, I'd have rated it a 5.  Drinkability - The current Guinness can be thrown back but not savored quite as well. Overall, I'd have to say it's a bit below average - I'd still drink it but I don't have the urge to savor it nor do I have the urge to keep pounding them back.

S: The smell is smoky, a little acidic, a little hoppy, a pretty bland smell in all reality though.  T: Smoky roasted malts, acidic bite at the end, slightly metallic taste, not as good out of the bottle as it is the pub can.  M: Smooth and creamy, not much carbonation at all, not as thick as it should be.  D: This is a pretty drinkable beer, all things considered, but there are better stouts, and better Irish stouts out there.

A bit of sweet, watery fruit juice. Then we have some cooked veggie flavor and some bitterness. Finishes dry and, thankfully, mostly clean.  If this guy tasted as good as it looked, it could rival the best of the best. Sadly it tastes next to nothing; it sits just south of neutral. Guinness is a tragedy in the world of beer.

The body itself is a deep brown, nearly black with some clingy, fine bubbles left on the glass.  Faint, creamy, roastiness and a hint of coffee. A somewhat nutty, dark malt aroma is present as well. Creamy and mild throughout. Just a hint of charged chocolate. Nothing special in the nose, decent but average at best.  Very creamy with a vanilla, and light mocha character. A slight char and mild roastiness. Lots of creamy, dairy flavor but somewhat watery. Not a lot of substance at all. Really rather weak on all accounts as far as flavor is concerned.  Creamy but not really very full in texture. Actually rather light with the illusion of a satisfying body produced by very fine carbonation and an off-putting overall texture. Really lacking. And it doesn't get any better as the beer warms.  I suppose the ABV is very low so one could potentially drink several easily, I just don't know who would want to. I'll be honest I'm having trouble finding the redeemable qualities in this one. I guess I'll just say that it leaves a lot to be desired and I can't help but feel like this selection somewhat tarnishes the illustrious Guinness name.

209,754,Hoagie1973,3.86,"Say what you will about Guinness; yes, I know they're a bunch of gimmick happy corporate whores, but one thing is undeniable... There is no other beer on the planet, that looks, smells, or tastes, like a Guinness on tap.  Properly poured, it sports a thick, creamy white head that doesn't have a single bubble in it. It's like Cool Whip. The cascading effect is awesome. Retention is like no other. In fact the last thing left in the glass after all the beer is gone is a thick glob of creamy foam. Lacing...? Holy crap! For the first third of the glass it leaves a solid wall of lace all the way around without a break in it. Held to the light it's surprisingly clear and reveals a fiery red hue.  Smell and taste are an inseparable amalgam of malt, hops, and a twangy sour-dough like flavor that is completely unique.  The only downfall is the thin, flat, watery mouthfeel. Creamy yet insubstantial. Still, I enjoy this beer every time I order it, But I only drink one in a night, and it has to be from the tap. That's the only way to truly experience a Guinness.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Black as night in the pint glass  S: Light malts and coffee. Barely accessible through the copious and solid head.  T: The taste is great. Not the best stout in the world, but its Guinness, and it tastes like Guinness. That is to say, some nice malts and a bitter finish that aren't the best balanced or most complex, but still manage to be thin.  M: As intriguing as the appearance. Creamy and medium-bodied, but easy to drink. The head coats your mouth and throat like having a huge marshmallow floating on top of your hot chocolate. Amazing.  D: Amazingly drinkable beer. 4 pints in a night goes down easy and doesn't leave you queasy.  My all-time favorite! As long as it is on-tap.

Sometimes can look almost like it is painted on the glass.  The smell is fairly weak, of roasted malts. Not a strong point.  Taste is mild, roasted malts, a little bit of coffee, a somewhat bitter, burnt malt finish.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but the body does not seem to be as heavy as I remember from my younger days.  Overall, a pretty drinkable beer. Not the most flavorful, especially after having tasted a good variety of stouts, but still a good beer to hit up when out on the town and in the mood for a stout, as it seems to be the only stout carried by most bars.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

When my pint arrived it was still settling, most of the glass showed a light foaming brown, with just black showing. I watched as the pour settled, but did end up with close to a full serving. The beige head held on through the drink, with lots of lacing left n the sides. Dark black in color. The aroma is sweet and roasted malt, not heavy though.

The smell is alright, with some malt and hops coming through more than anything else.  The smell carries over to the taste. This is a malty brew. It has a decent flavor, but it's not very complex.  It has a good amount of carbonation, so the mouthfeel is very vibrant.  This is a drinkable beer, that is, for a mainstream brew. It is, more or less, satisfactory. One drawback is that it sits in your stomach like a petrified loaf of bread. It's not a beer you can drink a lot of.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,cbleary,3.42,"I tried this at a local bar that had one of those ""surger"" devices, so basically, a glorified nitro-can pour.  The look is legendary, black topped by white, sitting perfectly in the glass. Like it or not, Guinness is brewed for mass appeal, so that leaves it being fairly middle of the road in the taste department. There are no off flavors, but really nothing too special either. The mouthfeel is creamy and its high drinkability can make it quite addictive!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Beautiful beer - black with 1 finger cream head that does not diminish one iota and how can you not like the reverse cascading effect. Decent lacing all the way down. Has a kind of a vanilla smell to me but my nose is terrible. With the way the beer looks you just want to be floored by the taste but it just doesn't quite work out...hint of coffee, smoke and slightly metallic, ok but doesn't fit the appearance. Mouthfeel - I love the shake like feel of Guinness. If Sam Adam's Cream Stout had a mouthfeel like this I'd drink nothing else. Takes me a while to drink Guinness because I like to swirl every swig around for a while. Drinkability is solid for me due to mouthfeel and low alcohol content.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The smell is, well mostly average, but there is a nice light coffee aroma present. The taste is good. It's, well, Guinness. Dark and chewy, with a drier coffee overtone and a bit of a dry finish. It's sort of the generic standard for me - the baseline to compare other stouts and porters against.  Mouthfeel is good, fairly chewy, and smooth to drink. It's the standard I defer to when there isn't much of a selection available. There are certainly other favorite dark beers out there but Guinness is always a 'safe' choice.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Really enjoyed visiting the factory, but the ones at the American supermarkets are different. Not a big fan of the aroma, heavyToasted/roasted smell with light yeasty undertones. Appearence is beautiful and well planned. Intial head is smaller than the final head which is nearly milkey. The head is off white and ALWAYS have a fingerwidth tall. Dark dark color, beautiful. Flabor is of roasted coffee with hardly any initial flavor. Finish is average with salty/sour taste. Texture was extremely extremely watery with nearly flat carbonation. Non descript finish-feel. Good, but better closer to the source.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It's also super smooth on the palate and goes down effortlessly. But a tad thin.  But, the odor has more sourness than desired and the roast character is a little lacking. It's there but not up front. These qualities follow through into the flavor too. It's a classic beer but I prefer Beamish or Murphy's for a more pleasing dry stout experience.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

S - The taste makes me think of lighter chocolate and mid level coffee.  T - The taste of creamy almonds first come to mind. Next the taste of chocolate came to my mind.  M- The thing about the mouth feel is the fact that it is so thick at times that it feels like i am drinking a milkshake. I love my stouts but at times this one was quite thicker then average.  D - This is one of those beer that is cool to sit at a bar, catch up with an old friend or new friend and just hang out and drink.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

May not be long-lasting but presents a fair amount of lacing. Aroma: weak in general. Roasted coffee and toasted malts. Taste: confirms the aroma plus some herbal hops. Mouthfeel: dry, low carbonation and average alcohol strength. Watery, thin and diluted. Finish: long bitter-burnt aftertaste.  Overall: extremely watery. Very different from the tap Guinness I know (I specially missed the creamy character of the tap version). Poor substitute to the original stuff. If you are looking for a Guinness in a bottle try the ""Guinness Special Export Stout"". Now that is a beer!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,MrIncognito,3.28,I like this much better out of the nitro can or the nitro bottle lately. It's tasted very watery on tap lately.  Watching the bubbles rise from the bottom turing the beer from tan to black is beautiful. It definitely is an experience drinking this beer.  I think Guinness is better than it has been rated by some lately. I'm sure there are better stouts out there but this is such a classic.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,SaintNathaniel,3.69,"There are definitely two types of Guinness I've experienced. The creamy/smooth/rich one that I can and have drank for years, or the rusty/copper/lead tasting one which is a result of a bad pour/tap and/or being served in a dirty or improper glass. This review is solely based on the former, b/c to get the true Guinness taste, you need to get it on tap, at a bar that cares about their Guinness, and knows how to pour it properly...  A - bold dark color and once the cascade settles from the nitrogen tap, it forms a near perfect creamy head, just a shade off-white. i've yet to see a beer that is as visually pleasing as a properly poured Guinness.  S - very roasty malts with hints of caramel and can be a bit nutty at times.  T - the first taste are the hints of caramel, mainly from the creamy head, and it finishes with the roasty malts. near perfect balance of flavors. the more you drink in a sitting the more your palate adjusts to the flavors, as my last Guinness of the night always seems to be the best.  M - the beer definitely has a heavy feel, as some jokingly refer to it as ""drinking a loaf of bread"", it's not heavy to the point of being chewy like other stouts can be, but compared to lagers and most other styles it has a lot of texture and weight to it's feel. it's very smooth and creamy, reminiscent of a rich latte, pending that latte was chilled, of course.  D - overall it's a great beer and used to be my favorite, but as I've broadened my consumption to Belgian styles and domestic crafts, Guinness is starting to move down my list as a favorite. Regardless, it's an exceptional beer and usually a mainstay at many watering holes, which is a nice alternative to the American lagers that I need not mention. Though, I would avoid ""chancing"" this beer and order it only when you know the bar and bartenders care about the way they serve it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Iheartstouts,3,"Guinness Draught is the most average stout that I've ever tasted. There simply isn't a lot to tell about it. To be perfectly honest, the only reason I drank it was due to a friend of mine making an error at the liquor store.  1. Serving Type- I'm not a big fan of the plastic coating on the bottle. It makes the bottle itself feel strange. 2. Appearance- Ever so slightly lighter than it's Extra Stout counterpart, Guinness Draught's appearance is similar to any stout. Nothing too special, but nothing to complain about. 3. Smell- A less pungent roasted malt aroma than most stouts, but still has a way of lingering in your nasal cavity. Again, nothing special, but nothing problematic. 4. Mouthfeel- Not nearly as full as I would prefer, but has the essential ""motor oil"" feel to it. Still not worth any note. 5. Drinkability- Honestly, I wouldn't care to drink more than a few of these. It simply isn't pleasing enough to warrant the full stomach.  This beer is solidly average. I'm sure one could find much worse examples, but finding a better one doesn't take much thought. I'd have to imagine that Guinness Draught would be much better in a pub atmosphere out of a tap.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,DaveUK,2.91,"Appearance - Black with hints of brown at the edges if held to the light. A dense white head of small white bubbles from the nitrogen pump.  Aroma - Weak, roasted malt and an odd metallic tinge that is only noticeable in the first pint (and disappears along with your taste perception after a session).  Taste - Mild burnt and roasted malts, bitter coffee and a finish with more burnt malt and bitterness.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and ""milky"" in its texture, a dryness present in the aftertaste, reminiscent of the aftertaste from a strong cup of black tea.  Overall - Despite having this beer more times than I can remember (my unenlightened days at uni were spent solely on this), I choose to review this pint because it tasted particularly good. Guinness doesnt have much taste and certainly not aroma but something can be said about the importance of mouthfeel because thats the reason I used to drink it. And Im sure the reason why so many people still drink it. I think that mouthfeel is the most important attribute to the sense of ""moreishness,"" and thats where guinness' strength is. Despite my dislike of beers which represent all thats bad about big business breweries, if Im confronted by a row of commercial lagers with this one exception, I would have to say that I would always go for a guinness.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Pauly2X,3.44,"A- Creamy head that refuses to fade, perched atop cascading darkness.  S- Heavily roasted malts reminiscent of burnt toast. There is a hint of diary like aroma that makes for an overall plesant smell.  T- Extremely well balanced and tasty. This is achived by ""playing it safe"". Altough good theres nothing special here.  M- A little thin on the take, gets better as it warms up though.  D- St. Patty's Day... C'mon  True there are better stouts out there but its a freakin classic. Best of all it has an availability rivaled only by BMC.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,jaz58,4.65,By far my favorite beer. I truly enjoy the rich coffee flavor from the roasted barley. A wonderful carmel flavour from the creamy head. The great bitters finish. On occasion I have had it poured in the wrong glass (I found out that there are two styles of Guinness glasses available) and it does ruin the beer.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BeerImmediately,3.52,"I was all over the board in scoring this classic, which explains why I wouldn't turn one down, but wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to order one either.  Starts w/the unmistaken sound of the nitro-can opening, which still to this day, scares me into thinking that it's about to overflow out of the can. And of course the very cool cascading bubbles which build the creamy tan head, which dutifully hangs out for the duration of the beer.  Has a slightly nutty and sweet smell, but is hampered by a metallic twang as well.  Taste is of a light chocolate coffee, with a shot of caramel sweetness as well.  Mouthfeel starts somewhat creamy, but finishes thin, with some watery aluminum aftertaste. This is probably my least favorite part of Guinness. I should try the bottles to see if this is different.  Virtually no aftertaste, and with the low alcohol content, combines to make a pretty darn good session beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Jameson480,3.81,"Appearence - Almost black, more of a dark dark red/brown, reddish tints around the edge, very fine thick head. I wish it was a little blacker and had more head, but that's the can's fault.  Smell - Very slight metallic/burn cigarette undertones  Taste - It's arguably the standard modern day stout (although the Extra Stout may be better, but I haven't had that in a while so I can't really compare). Very smooth, straight black coffee taste, although it does taste kinda thin/runny/watery. I wish it were a little bit more robust like Sam Adams Cream Stout or Sierra Nevada Stout.  Mouthfeel - Little carbonation so it's easy to drink. I wish it has more alcohol.  Drinkability - I love stouts. People think I'm crazy when I tell them that I think it's somewhat thin tasting because lots of people think it's like a ""meal in a bottle"" but I don't buy that. I need to do a side by side comparison of this and Guinness Extra Stout, but I think that the Extra Stout is more up my alley. Also, I really wish Guinness used true 16 ounce cans and 12 ounce bottles. This 14.9 ounce/11.2 ounce business is just lame.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Smells of sweet chocolate and roasted malts.  Rather watery for a stout. Dry. Not a big palate here.  Creamy.  Low in alcohol + creamy= good drinkability  Come on, we all know Guinness. It's the other gateway beer next to Sierra. It's good for what it is trying to do. Not a special stout by any means, but come on, it's Guinness.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,malcontent,2.84,"""Twok! Hisss!"" and we're off to the nitro can races. Dead-sexy reverse-cascading, cream colored head sits one finger high atop a black body. At least it looks good.  Past criticism that the nitro can product carries with it a metallic odor seems well founded. It's not awful and doesn't completely blot out a fair degree of caramel sweetness. Still, it ends up smelling a bit like drain water after a while.  A moderate degree of roasty bitterness kicks off a decent into complete wateriness. A lingering hop/metal bitterness finishes. I'm at a loss; there's almost nothing else to describe about this beer.  Mouthfeel misses creaminess and heads straight toward water. Smooth, but so is what comes out of my Britta. I could drink a bunch of this but why would I?  OK, I was a little annoyed after reading the Bros.'s reviews of this brew as they seemed harsh just for the sake of ""oh, if you had it in Dublin"" or ""it used to be better"" and the like. However, it's true, this has been dumbed down a good deal from what I remember cutting my beer teeth on from the tap. Not worth a purchase, especially with so many more American craft breweries attempting the dry Irish style (3F's Black Sun, anyone?).",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,HardcoreKeith,3.84,"The version of Guinness we get here is definitely light on the smell and taste. Only a hint of roasted barley flavor is apparent. However, the appearance, with jet black body and thick head, and the creamy milkshake taste are what makes this beer so enjoyable for me. Combined with the relatively low alcohol content, this is a very chuggable session beer that I can always depend on when I'm somewhere that doesn't serve craft beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,foles,3.84,"Decided it was time to review this classic following recent encounters with perfectly kept kegs in Ireland and a good irish social club in South Harrow, North-west London.  Firstly, I dont know if the nitro can should be listed alongside the on-tap version, because they are completely different, as the on tap version is far superior than the widget-can.  Anyway, if kept well, the pour is the classic we have all come to know and love. The smell is limited to a mild roasted flavour. All I can say about the taste is that it is distinctively that of Guinness, except when the quality of serving/keeping is lower and bitterness starts to overwhelm. A good draught Guinness should be smooth, nicely flavoured and not bitter - and dead easy to drink.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,DrainBamage,4.21,"There's nothing better the watching the creamy head foam on a Guinness. Smell has roasted malty aromas. Could be a little stronger though.

This is one great beer and shouldn't be put down just because it's one the big boys.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,drseamus,3.25,"The bottle says this is supposed to be consumed directly from the bottle, so I did that. I only poured a bit into a glass to evaluate the appearance. It is nice and dark, but not black. Light does penetrate and it is more of a dark brown body. The aroma isn't strong at all. A touch of roasted malt is pretty much it. The taste is decent, but could use a bit more punch to it. There is a touch of roasted malt again and maybe a hint of coffee, but it is pretty thin. The body is as thin as the taste. I can't believe I used to think of this as heavy bodied. This is however, one of the most quaffable darker beers out there. There is something to be said for that.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,atrus138,2.88,"Haven't had one of these in a good while. Ordered this from a nitro-tap. Very interesting show before all was said and done with foam rising to the top from the bottom. Eventually, it became a dark black with a finger thick head that was the color of the inside of a Whopper (the candy, not the burger). Decent lacing. However, the line where the drink itself and the head meet looked synthetically straight. Kind of took a lot of the soul out for me. Smell is kind of weak, but rather sweet-smelling. Taste is rather weak, especially for something labeled as a stout. Mildly sweet malts. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy, but closer to the consistency of water. Easily sessionable, but I would rather move on to bigger and better things. Sadly, this is often the best thing available at many locations.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Sampled it on draft at Legal Sea Foods in Short Hills, and to be honest, I can't understand what all the hype is behind this one... Although I was pretty impressed with the dual-color, dark, tan appearance, it basically went down-hill from there... a basically average, dry stout smell that wasn't too appealing led to a bitter and uninviting taste that had an even more astringent after-taste... Oily, slick mouthfeel and too bitter to be a drinkable brew in my opinion... Glad I tried it, but won't ever again...",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Just this: I've had a fair number of well-reviewed stouts. Yes, Old Rasputin, Mikkeller Black Hole, Stone Imperial, and Big Bear are all more impressive stouts, pushing the envelope in terms of taste and ABV.  But sometimes you want something that is more quaffable, that can be enjoyed without concentration, that doesn't have so much character that it demands your attention. And for that, good ole Guinness in a widget can serves just fine.  It can compare to the real draught version, but what beer does?

It looks great, keeps a nice foam head, smooth texture and taste, and goes down easy. My only complaint would be what I describe as an overly fluffy feeling in it. Sometimes, if it's too cold, I feel like I'm drinking heavy water.  Solid beer. Not exceptional, but worth buying every now and then.

Guinness is a classic, I like the beers that are not in any nitro cans better. These all seem to ruin the wonderful mouthfeel of this beer.  I had a perfectly poured Guinness on tap last week, complete with shamrock. They haven't been able to can that yet.

Nice 2 finger off white head sticks for the entire beer thanks to the nitro widget.  S- is fairly bland with some roasted malt and hints of leather.  T- mostly roasted malts with some sourish vegetable taste mid way followed up with some hops in the finish but not much. This brewery is cutting so many corners nowadays.  M- fairly light bodied and somewhat watery mouthfeel. Carbonation is ok. somewhat metallic as well.  D- this saying that Guinness is like"" drinking mud "" isnt true anymore. This was drinkable and sessionable.  Overall this just seems watered down for some reason. Decent enough with food or in a pub with some friends but theres not much going here except for a nostalgia thing.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,ajmoody76,3.68,given to me by my bro-in-law. nitro can to tulip glass. dark brown but not black. very clear. few finger head that thins down to one finger. looks like a stout on nitro.  toasty aroma. not much more. no off odors.  get the bitterness from the roasted grain. malt is out front but get some hoppy bitterness on the aftertaste. well balanced. fits style of course. this beer defined the style.  i love the widget. medium bodied. may have been a little thin. nice lace.  i like this beer. better on tap in my opinion. still one of my favorites to drink though.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,assmasterson,2.11,"I truly, truly hope that all Guinness does NOT taste like this.  It looks fantastic with it's frothy head and mesmerizing swirl when poured, and the smell isn't too bad with some floral here and there.  The taste...what in the HELL? No sense of hops, no bite, no tartness, nothing. The taste to me comes across as muddy water. Surprisingly, I did not spit it out after my first drink. It could be because of the nitro-can, but this is absolutely gross.  Don't try to be trendy and get this just on sheer principle, not just because of the name but also because of the widget. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID.  If the Extra Stout I bought is anything like this, I will be severely disappointed.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,FenwaySquid,3.01,"Presentation: 11.2 oz. bottle covered in dark gray labeling (completely opaque), no dating of any kind, with the widget inside, poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: Poured a completely opaque flat black color, bubbles cascading. Once the beer settles you've got one finger head, cream colored and lingering nicely.  Aroma: Roasted malts, some coffee as well.  Taste: Roasted malts from beginning to end.  Mouthfeel: Watery, no real carbonation of which to speak.  Overall: It's pretty much the same as guinness draught in the can, only it's in a bottle and you don't get as much. If you're just breaking into the craft brew scene it's a good beer to use to get your feet wet. Once you do, though, keep in mind there are other stouts out there that are much better.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,KiltedCulinarian,3.39,"The place advertised a ""Perfect Pour,"" and I have to agree with them. A finger and a half of pearly head that left tight knit lacing all the way to the end. Pitch black colour. Lots of malts present, and a distinct roasted flavour. Just enough weight to the body; it wasn't watery, but neither was it like drinking oatmeal. The interplay between the creamy head and the robust beer worked well.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Plenty of lacing sticks around as well, and the foamy head is present at every sip. Smell is very faint of roasted malt, a little faint espresso aroma. Taste is even more faint with every sip creamy yet distant with only the roasted taste coming through. My first time drinking straight Guiness. Nice change of pace.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,GbVDave,2.86,"Poured from an 11.2oz nitro-bottle into a 20oz imperial pint.  A: Pours a dark, ruby-tinted, black color that lets a small amount of light through. Smallish 1/2 finger head, light tan in color, that sticks around to the very end and leaves some nice lace sheeting in its' wake.  S: Mild aromas of roasted malt, coffee, and a tiny pinch of hops. Everything smells watered down.  T: See above. Also noticed a fleeting tart fruitiness and a flavor like wet notebook paper. Flavors seem watered down and messy.  M: Thin and watery. That's it.  D: It's easy to drink but why bother? It's not challenging to the senses whatsoever.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

T: Very tame stout flavors; some light roasted malt, thin and slightly bitter hops. It's all very light and thin, even watery. A very weak stout.  M: Light and a tad bit watery.  D: Very drinkable, I'll give it that. A decent session beer due to the low alcohol but there are many better stouts out there.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,mbenthall,3,I have to admit I'm a fan of this Irish Stout although over the years it has weakened in taste. I know you've all heard it before Guinness has definitely gotten lighter and so when held up to be inspected you can see light through the glass. I'm not sure of the reason this beer has become weaker although I have heard that this is common in the US but not every where else you may find this. So hopefully this will come back to the beer we all knew and liked.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,Aleforge,2.8,"Ah Guinness, the horrid evil doer of the BMC crowd. They are scared to death of this brew. Most of my friends refer to it simply as ""tar"". I really wish it could hold up to that standard. As older variations of Guinness seemed much thicker, much more stout and delicious. I couldn't believe how weak on flavor and mouth feel this stuff is anymore. Maybe I changed? I don't know but I really didn't enjoy it, it was like drinking a yahoo over real chocolate milk. fake, watery and boring.  It doesn't look near as awesome either, light comes through the glass, which is just a crime in itself!  I give up on Guinness.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,sbe1,4.07,"It's not the best Irish Dry Stout but it's the oldest and my personal favorite, however, the beer has degraded in quality over the years so that it's more palatable to the unwashed masses. This review is of a perfectly poured pint at Dublin House on 79th St. in NYC.  Appearance: Deep blackish brown--medium roast coffee ground sludge color (I mean that in a good way), but not dark enough to prevent some light getting through the glass. Properly poored, Guinness has a nice caramel colored half-inch thick foamy head that lasts nearly to the end (but then I drink my Guinness fast). [Old Guinness: pretty much black, no light could get through the glass.]  Smell: Malt, coffee, very faint hop notes. Pleasant but not complex. [Old Guinness: had about the same smell but fuller and richer.]  Taste: Smooth malt creaminess with a little coffee bitterness, a smooth finish. Very good, but not complex. [Old Guinness: again about the same taste but more so, more complex and richer.]  Mouthfeel: Full bodied but just barely, smooth, creamy. [Old Guinness: It was a meal in a glass, thick, rich creamy, like a beer milkshake. Such a shame it's gone!]  Drinkability: Excellent. This is one of my staple beers, one of the all time great session beers. [Old Guinness: ditto.]",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,TheTrevor,3.49,"This beer poured a dark brown with a three-finger tan head. The smell is fairly faint, and with some effort you can pick up roasted malts. The in the taste there is a definite presence of hops along with roasted malts that gives makes for a slightly sweet and slightly bitter brew that's rather pleasant. The mouthfeel a little watery, which helps with the beers excellent drinkability.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,illidurit,2.41,"Considering the nitro-bottle idea here, there's no appearance to speak of. I poured a bit out into a glass to get a whiff of the aroma since the small opening of a bottle doesn't let any smell out. What I got was hardly any aroma anyway! Burnt barley and a smidgeon of coffee. Tasted like water run through a loaf of charred bread, with the added bonus of a understated sourness in the finish. Yuck. The carbonation is nice, but the body is far too watery for a stout. I couldn't fathom drinking another of these unless it was part of a car bomb.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

T- Very good taste, strong hints of licorice.  M- Very smooth, with the head, it is unbelievablely smooth, only slightly less so once the head is gone lending a slight bitterness to the aftertaste.  D- I could drink these all night. Tastes like I'm drinking a stick of licorice or chocolate bar.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Take the brewery tour and get a free sample of the best Guinness you will ever have. Okay. Now that is over, the nitro can was poured into a pint glass. great creamy head make you think this is the real deal but the color is very transparent and thin looking.  The smell is very faint. little toffee smell.  Tastes very thin. Almost a watered down coffee taste. Slightly peat aftertaste.  Really bad. Not worth it. Like I said before.

This happened to me in Boston and I was absolutely pissed. The pour of a Guinness is an absolute art. You will notice the color changing as its poured from the tap and how it forms a perfect layer of creamy foam at the top of the glass. It is not very bitter and its not too sweet. Hardly any carbonation, but its a great beer for sipping and sessions. If you are in Boston, you should try Mr. Dooley's.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

I know of nothing more beautiful than a Guinness in a tulip pint glass. There is not much smell, but that adds a surprise when the delicious taste hits your tongue. The mouth feel is great, assuming it has been poured properly.

209,754,ChainGangGuy,2.06,"Appearance: Dark brown body with a dense cream-colored head.  Smell: Exceedingly mild, plain aroma of creamy roasted barley.  Taste: Very vague overall taste with only a mild coffee-like bitterness. From the first sip to the last there's just very little to offer here.  Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body. Mild carbonation. Joyless, watery texture.  Drinkability: Perhaps the widget-bottle isn't the way to go, 'cause this beer lacks any sort of distinct characteristics and comes across as watery and uninteresting.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,becktone,2.7,"Its been along time and I though that I'd have another go round with Guinness now that my palate is a bit more sophisticated.  Eye: Pretty much black in color with brown highlights when the light strikes it just right and an egg white head, good retention. Despite its good qualities I don't like the way it looks it looks fake. The line between the black and white is too perfectly straight. I get the impression that I am looking at a magazine ad or a picture of a pint of Guinness, not the actual pint itself. It looks like those fake TVs at furniture stores, looks like a cardboard three dimensional cut out of a pint glass. It looks lifeless and dead....you'll find more life in a graveyard than in this brew.  Nose: Pretty weak overall. Weak roasted dark malt aromas along with weak coffee type smells. I mean, I really have to take some serious air in through the nostrils to be able to soak up any aroma from this beer. Either its not there or it just clings to the brew. Not really impressed.  Tongue: Oh, some metallic tang! Other than that there is some coffee bean and roasted malt flavors. In my opinion (now that I don't think that Guinness is all high and mighty, as I once did) this is a very weak beer. Not much in the way of flavor here, very watery. Tastes more like water than beer.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: One of the first things I noticed when I started drinking this just now was that it has the same type of body and feel as a cool glass of water on a hot day, just after you've finished mowing the lawn. It is refreshing in that sense....cool clean water, with a bit of flavor thrown in. It is easy to drink and makes a great session beer, but I feel that a stout should be much fuller and heavier than this. Though I'm not a huge fan of this beer I'll most likely buy it again as at some point in my life this will be the best offering on tap at some low rate restaurant I happen to be dining in.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,largadeer,2.92,"Appearance: Dark brown with reddish highlights, slightly translucent; ultra-thick nitro head.  Smell: Lightly roasted barley, a bit grainy - not much of an aroma.  Taste: Mild roasted barley, but without much actual bitterness. A subtle grainy sweetness comes through in the middle. It finishes clean and dry with no aftertaste. I'm not too sure what else to say - it really doesn't have much depth or character.  Mouthfeel: The nitro head gives the illusion if a thick, creamy beer; but the body is very thin and watery. I know Irish dry stouts aren't supposed to be the thickest stouts around, but this is thin even for the style.  Notes: Now here's a beer that's all about image. It looks impressive, but when you get down to it, it's completely lacking in aroma, flavor and body. It's not terrible by any means, but it's also not very good.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,TheodorHerzl,3.57,"The beer begins pouring a deep brown color mixing with the nitrogen and cascades into a midnight black beer with a soft two finger creamy head at the top. There isn't really much of a nose on a Guinness. Perhaps a bit of roasted barley, but not much. The taste is of the unique roasted malted flavor that allows for a bit of chocolate to find your palate from drink to drink and a dry finish leaves you going for another drink. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but the beer is actually rather light and doesn't overly coat your mouth. The drinkability is very high on this. It's low in alcohol, refreshing, and satisfying. It makes a great session beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

I waited a minute or so to watch the live performance that is allowing a Guinness to settle. Perfect.  S: Smells dark and roasty, a little like coffee grounds with a hint of sweetness. Not an overpowering nose.  T: Taste is sweet, smooth malt, bittersweet chocolate and a little hop bite leading to a watery finish. Very clean and balanced.  M: Mouthfeel is thin and watery, as an Irish Dry should be. Very easy to drink.  D: The low ABV, great taste, smooth mouthfeel and tradition of the style should see an imbiber downing more than their fill of the sweet nectar.

Smells of a bit of chocolate, coffee and roasted malt. The nose and taste is very tame compared to other stouts that I have had. Its like they want to get more beer out of their batch's so they add water.  On the palate there is some roasted malt, fair hop bitterness and a few hints of coffee.

It is a very malty smell that really grabs me. The taste is pretty good as well. I love stouts and this one is no exception, in fact, it was my gateway stout if you will. It has a smooth almost creamy thick feel in my mouth with a small amount of carbonation. Not alot, but enough to know that this is beer.

One nice looking beer.  S: Dark chocolate, caramel, coffee, and malts. Maybe not as aromatic as a stout should be.  T: I truly like Guinness, it may seem a bit lacking to some but thats what makes it good to me. A creamy chocolate coffee flavor that end with the slightest hint of hop. nice and dry at the finish.  M: Very thin bodied, but sometimes I crave a Guinness and this watery feel to it is one of the aspects that I like. This beer is trice better on Tap, though.  D: I've had a many night where I drank a 4 pack of the draught cans whilst playing euchre or poker or just idling with my friends.

Not much of a smell. If you try hard you get a whiff of roasted malt but thats with a big effort. Tastes nice and roasty with a minor hop bite at the end. Creamy in the mouth and smooth as silk.

In any decent bar, in any decent sized city, you can probably order a pint of Guiness. That's one comforting thing when you're traveling abroad.  Not much scent (it's still in the bottle), but I don't remember Guiness having a strong scent.  I dig the taste of Guiness. Strong roasted undertones, but highly drinkable. Malty rather than hoppy. Heavier than American macro brews. I used to joke that there's a meal in every pint.  Sure, it's not that complicated or complex, but I think that it's very good for a beer produced in such enormous quantities.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Barkeep filled the glass 2/3 full, let it settle, then poured the remaining 1/3...WOW! The head quite possible could have supported a 1/2 dollar coin it was so rich and did not receed noticeably at all. The lacing was almost indescribable...more a sticky, continuous coating vs. gobs & bits. Smeel and taste are cklassic guiness...heavily roasted malt and some mild hop bitterness. Mouthfeel seemed creamier, but may have been due to the increased head retention. Could pound 8 or 9 of these in a pub setting easily.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

This beer pour a beautiful dark brown, almost black, with a nice full tan head. The smell is also very wonderful, hint of milk chocolate. The taste is not what I remember. It starts mildly sweet, and creamy, but the finish, especially as it warmed seem almost metallic. Mouthfeel was ok, think enough and creamy. Drinkability is a tough one, while it goes down smooth, and is not overly filling, the metallic taste at the end left my pallet a little ragged. Overall, I would not turn a Guinness down, and it is a bit better on tap, but with Beamish being back on the shelves here, and that Murphy's is easy to find, Guinness won't be my first choice when I want an Irish Stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,LeftonJackman,4.21,"So much about this beer is in the fashion it is served. Never, ever, ever drink this beer out of a can or bottle. The only way to drink Guinness as it is intended is on-top and poured in two parts. It might seem trivial to some, but is as factual a statement as I can make.  I sat at a think wooden bar where Jason pulled 2/3 of my pint glass and let the nitrogen go to work. After the 2/3 had settled he SLOWLY pulled the last third and presented me with a beautiful libation.  The dark stout is complemented perfectly with a smooth, buttery head. The head of the Guinness is what sets it apart, for me, from any other beer. The head is creamy as opposed to airy and rests wonderfully on my top lip as I bring the pint to my mouth.  I draw my head back and open up the back of my throat. This is where the real taste of a Guinness comes in to play. Smooth, slightly bitter and creamy. Perfectly wonderful. For some the taste can be too mild, almost watery when compared to more hoppy beers. And I agree. But the freshness of a Guinness is what appeals to me.  The glass is laced to perfection and I ask Jason to start me another.  For me, when enjoyed properly, Guinness is the master of beers.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,wagenvolks,3.24,"On tap at the local pub.  Waitress brings a beautiful, slowly cascading pour that develops into a thick, creamy, homogenous bone-colored head. Retention is near-perfect and good lacing is left behind. The body is seal brown and nearly opaque. Aroma is rather faint, with whiffs of smoked & roasted malts, vanilla, and some toffee.  The flavor is perhaps the weak part of Guinness. Despite being perhaps the epitome of its style, the taste is limited to weak notes of smoky malts, some carmel, and a touch of chocolate. Mouthfeel is great, however, with a creamy thick body that's quite refreshing. Not much of an aftertaste, however. Drinkability is hindered by its lack of complexity and thickness. Meal-in-a-pint. Overall, though, a pretty solid beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,hreb,3.94,"Cold 14.9 oz Ntiro-can of Guinness Draught dumped into US-size 16 oz pint glass. The beer expands to fill the glass and forms the beautiful cascading pattern of brown and black down the glass, leaving a medium dark tan head a couple of minutes, which seems like it could stand for days. As a rule I prefer Guinness in cans over Guinness in bottles by a wide margin, although draught is best; the Nitro-bottles just don't do anything for me, and I think they taste sour. For whatever it's worth, the bottle says this beer was brewed in Ireland. It also says to serve extra cold.  Getting back to the beer, there isn't much aroma coming off the cold stout, except a very slight toastiness. The head is thick and creamy and mild. It sips bitter and deep and more creamy. The flavor is pure and of toasted malt with hops that blend and balance perfectly. The flavor is utterly neutral with no strange contaminations of coffee or chocolate or caramel or treacle or freshly cut glass. The result is highly drinkable.  There are so many really great stouts out there that I forget how much I like Guinness. It's great too. I hope to review at the very least the nitro-bottle and tap versions for comparison, but I expect this measures up surprisingly well compared to the latter and much better than the former.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,iconoklaztor,2.4,"Damn this beer. I give it another shot. Im a stout lover and this is in no way a stout to me. Its technically a stout but its not even close.  The appearance was the ""best"" part. It was dark with that classic ivory head. The head was small but it was visable. The smell was weak with no real distinct notes. The taste...left a lot to be desired. The mouthfeel was weak. Just a bit more fullness than water. It wasnt very drinkable either. Now I dont think its a bad keg considering all Guinness I've tried has been horrible. Funny thing was...the bar tender apologized for taking my mini-pitcher and said he would have wanted the last drops of his. (made me laugh)  Dont buy this beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,supercolter,3.74,"As many others have noted- the appearance on this beer is really something to behold. I have been very, very impressed with the consistent perfect pour this beer offers.

For sheer originality it deserves a 5.  M: Chocolatey and dry.  D: Nothing goes down smoother than a fresh pint of Guinness.  One of my favorite beers.

MF- Very smooth but I always consider Guinness to be too much on the light side.  D- Very drinkable. Could have one after the other, after the other...

Better from the tap.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Romulus141,3.69,"It's about time I've sat down and reviewed this. I've had this from many different sources.  Poured from the nitro bottle into a pub glass.  Appearance: Pours with that distinctive disturbance pattern within the body, where a caramel color is mixed with a darker, blackish color. The caramel swirls settle down, and leave just the dark color behind. There is a very healthy looking creamy head that seemingly never dissipates. When held up to the light, I see tinges of red, confirming the reports that this beer's color is actually ""dark ruby."" Overall, this beer always looks very good. It's very picturesque.  Smell: A mix of toffee and coffee are the main scents I detect on this brew. Subsequent sniffs reveal a malt character. The smell itself is not overwhelming, but it is a welcoming nose, like an old friend.  Taste: It has a light flavor of toasted malts and coffee overtones. The overall flavor has a creamy attribute, which finishes with a slight tinge of hopped bitterness. No, despite the hype, this is not the best beer ever. However, it is quite competent, and is a great change of pace from other beers. I like that it is light, but has that creamy, toffee flavor. It's reliable, and although it's tame, it's a sure fire pleaser when I need it.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly light, given its color. There is really no carbonation to speak of either.  Drinkability: Given the light body, subdued flavor, and its creaminess, it's very easy to drink a lot of these. When at the bars, I often switch to this when I tire of whatever else we're drinking, as its easy on the stomach and on the tastebuds.  I know this beer is somewhat controversial here, and receives a lot of flack from fellow advocates for various reasons, but I can't help but like this brew. As I said, it's reliable and subtle, and is a great go-to beer when I'm out at a place with an otherwise poor selection. The hype is certainly overdone, and some of my friends worship this stuff (and the extra stout), but I'd be lying if I said I disliked this. To each their own.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,jbsteiny,3.04,"Okay, I just reviewed Guinness on tap, so this is just the comparison of that with the nitro-bottle version (I wish I had the can too, to complete my BA review of the Guinness Draught experience and move on to more important concerns, like Guinness Extra Stout).  I have to say, they did a nice job with the widget in preserving the look of Guinness. Apparently the proper way to pour it is to forgo any tilt of the glass and just dump it straight in -- don't fear, because of low carbonation levels, it won't overflow... Basically, near black, beautiful cascading, incredibly durable head, foamy lacing. Smells much like the Guinness on tap, (creamy coffee, roasted nuts and ale hops) but with an unpleasant metallic tinge. This flavor comes out on the palate as well, and the characteristic Guinness sourness is also stepped up (I wonder if they put more ""spoiled"" beer into the vats meant for bottling than into those to be kegged). Not nearly as good. Again, weak mouthfeel, somewhat less creamy than that on tap, but still, an easy drinking beer for sessioning or the end of the night.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Mdog,3.06,"Appearance: I didn't follow the directions and poured this into a pint glass. It gave the nice cascading foam appearance as from the tap. A pretty sight.  Smell: Light coffee, dark chocolate.  Taste: Moderate coffee bitterness, kind of creamy.  Mouthfeel: Very very thin.  Drinkability: The definition of sessionable. Light in body, not strong in alcohol, decent tasting.  Obtained a bunch of Guinness from family who bought it but decided ""dark"" beers weren't for them. Not a whole lot there in this beer, but it's a decent change-of-pace from my usual big IPA (at home) and Miller Lite (at softball).",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,livingregret,3.99,"Serving Type: Today it's in a Nitro-Bottle(first time trying one of these bad boys)  Appearance: Still the same lovely look, a bit nicer of a head that lingers more and provides more lacing. Maybe because it's not in a chilled glass? The difference is amazing...looks perfect  Smell: Same lovely smell of toffee, chocolate, caramel. Still a touch weak though  Taste: Rich chocolate still shines through as does a light coffee taste that I didn't get out of the nitro-can. Light caramel and toffee still mixed throghout.  Mouthfeel: Light, smooth and creamy. Still great  Drinkability: Fantastic. Still great...the main difference from this and my other sample was the lovely head and plenty of lacing. Still a great beer I could enjoy all day  Edit: Editing my review after trying a few other Irish Stouts. Still a great Stout but a bit dryer/bitter than some of the others",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Mostly unremarkable.  Taste is not that good. The first time I had a Guinness, I thought it was a pretty solid beer. After I had ""real"" beers, I had another Guinness and was not impressed. Tastes like it smells - like coffee lite. Aside from that, the taste, like the smell, is unremarkable  Mouthfeel is borderline watery.  Drinkability is not that below average since the beer is filling and not that tasty as it turns out.  Try the extra draught. It's much better.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

There's nothing there. I'm giving a mid score, becasue there is nothing offensive. It is just a tasteless beverage - nothing great, nothing bad.  Mouthfeel is perfect - smooth and creamy.

It's lacing is fantastic, although the fact that I may drink it down pretty fast may have something to do with that. It's aroma is fantastic, deep and rich, the smell of rich dirt/loam after a heavy rain. I like to hold my pint and inhale deeply for a minute or two before enjoying its... taste, deep and rich, thick and creamy, chocolatey and loamy.

Smell&gt; Smells like home.. or where I wish home was, a large brewery. It is yeasty and biscuity, with a slight sweetness.  Taste&gt;low bitterness, roasted sweetness, and a nice dry hang. Perfectly fits its style because, in my humble opinion, it IS the style.  Mouthfeel&gt; Smooth, like buttah.  Drinkability&gt; Easy to drink... Perhaps too easy.

Smell was not great, a little bland I thought. Smells a little of chocolate and coffee but nothing stands out. Taste is OK. Much like the smell, nothing stood out. Some chocolate and caramel, but somewhat bland. Mouthfeel was great. This had a fantastic smooth texture about it, very creamy sensation, low on the carbonation. And overall drinkability is OK.

Appearance: Pitch black with cascading bubbles, .5-.75 of an inch of creamy, thick, give-you-a-mustache head.  Smell: Chocolatey (sp?) and a little bit of coffee, sweet.  Taste: MMM... It tastes... like guinness. The draught is much more smooth than the extra stout, with a bit of a bite or alkaline taste on the back of the tongue after it goes down. Sweet and smooth...

Pouring this beer produces the same cascading effect as the draft(nitro-tap) version at your local pub. Head is dense and creamy and lasts til the end of the glass. Smell and taste is creamy sweet with coffee and cocoa notes as well as a dark fruit fruitiness. Slight molasses and vanilla. Liquid is thinner and less carbonated than the tap version but the overall mouthfeel is still ok. Classic pub draft beer made to bring home or wherever and delivers just by popping a cap and pouring.  notes:The word stout does not appear anywhere on the label or packaging. Why is this? Packaging says to drink from the bottle. I did not do this because a big part of the experience is the dense creamy head. Also, the packaging says to serve ice cold. Really? Why on earth would you do that when most of the flavors will be hidden.

Just had one at a restaraunt that I was at and I'm not sure but I think this was either maybe a flat keg or something..but I sure didn't enjoy this like I thought I would.  Pour came with a tan head and it doing it's thing cascading down the sides of the glass..(I will say this is probably one of the best parts of a Guinness on nitro..it's like beer eye candy). We all know what it tastes like and I'm not going over that part..what I will say was it was totally flat..no carbonation at all..it was like drinking a flat soda that had some buzz to it..boring..I had the SA Summer Ale before this...I should've stuck with it,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The head looks very creamy, and it never fades, leaving the thickest curtain of lace I have ever seen.  This beer has a very subtle aroma. Some mild roasted malts. A slight toffee aroma. Maybe a little chocolate as well. For the most part, the aroma is very slight.  This beer tastes exactly like it smells. It is very mild. If I would have started the night with a Double IPA, I would probably not even taste this beer.  This beer goes down very smooth. It has a very creamy mouthfeel. The carbonation is very low.  This beer would probably make a good session beer. It is low in alcohol, and since it has hardly any flavor, it wouldnt get old.  Overall: I am surprised that it took so long to review this beer.

I love the way the colour cascades around, turning from a churning pale brown to a still black (although there is a little colour around the edges). Poured a finger of solid creamy head.  Smell - 3.5 Not a whole lot of smell at first. Now that I have let it warm a little, there is a little metallic, rusty smell, with a little grain and a vague trace of malt sweetness. Nothing really offensive, but nothing special either.  Taste - 3.0 Definitely not a match for the on-tap version, but still not bad. Quite dry, with a little bitterness, and not a whole lot of taste upfront. Roasted and burnt grain in the main taste, with a little black coffee and a little hops.  Mouthfeel - 3.5 This is smooth for sure, but nowhere near as full-bodied as I remember Guinness being. Feels medium to heavy in the mouth with low carbonation. The head is creamy and fantastic.  Drinkability - 3.5 On-tap, this makes a decent session beer choice (although filling), but I could never see myself chugging back can after can. Drinking one was not a chore, but I wouldn't want another. Went down smoothly, and ABV is relatively low, which is a plus.  OVERALL - 3.5 I feel that this score is perhaps a little higher than the canned version of this beer deserves, but there you go. It is most definitely an icon, and if you are a fan, it is worth the premium price.

A- poured like chocolate milk forming 3/4in of creamy frothy beige cake batter head that retained itself almost completely, leaving curtains of lace hanging on the sides of the glass over the dark brownish black stout. i could see faint hints of amber when held up to the light.  S- toasted nuts, malt, sourdough bread, over-ripe fruit, raisin, plum, floral butterscotch, caramel, toffee  T- banana coffee dark chocolate. caramel hot cocoa and bitter burnt malt, followed by roasted malt, sunflower seed, and an earthy hoppy aftertaste.  MF- silky smooth and creamy it just glides down. very little carbonation which is a good thing for a stout in my opinion.  D- just dandy  ""serve extra cold"" i put a pint glass and a bottle of guinness in the freezer for about 10-25 minutes. in the frozen glass the cascading was even more amazing. in the middle of all the action, things slowly grinded to a halt forming rock-like strata, or even like cloud layers on the planet jupiter for about 1/2in between the beer and the head. this time, the foam became a starchy, clumpy, foamy disc on top, a darker brown with little dark specks and more aerated like buckwheat pancake batter or the head on a rootbeer float with the same icy consistancy. using this method, some of the more delicate flavors and aromas disappeared, but the overall taste improved and the mouthfeel and drinkability skyrocketed.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

""Marshmallowy"" doesn't begin to describe its soft, springy, sticky texture and barely off-white color. Its body is a marvelous brown, full of coffee and chocolate and damp soil with those beautiful, enchanting cascades of ultrafine bubbles.  Smell: Burnt sugar, mild cola, and sweet, smoky firewood. Roasty with a pointed resinous edge buried under a duvet of sweet malts. Mild solvents make their way to the surface as the beer warms.  Taste: Roasty and rich yet somehow light, with a penetrating, palate-filling savory character. It manages to vibrantly express the fullness of its uniquely bittersweet roasty, hoppy, malty essence without becoming sharp, nor cloying, nor aggressive. Caramel, milky cocoa, and burnt wood abound.  Mouthfeel: Enlighteningly smooth and creamy; dry and super-clean but for a lingering bitter smack in the finish.  Drinkability: A classic, and one that deserves its status as such. Versatile with many foods, especially seafood, but I found it remarkable with smoked lamb and raw spinach eaten together. It brings out the sharp bitterness of the leaves and the gamey sweetness of the meat while emphasizing unexpectedly robust undertones in the beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Lots of roastiness and sweetness, but overly dry for my tastes Mouthfeel was pretty decent for such a mass marketed product. It's pretty amazing how Guinness can contract brew so much and have a remarkably similar product every time. Not my favorite beer, in fact I tend to shy away from this but Arthur Guinness obviously had struck gold with this, as it is one of the most widely drunk beers ever, and he was smart enough to know that and sign a 900 year lease.

A 1 finger tan head makes it look like a picture.  S- Smell disappoints. Not much there -- some slight toasted malts without much character.  T- Taste is also a little light. Some more roasted malt tastes with a bit of a grainy character, a little of the expected coffee/chocolate, but more grainy than I'd like.  M - Mouthfeel seems to be what they're most interested here because it's got the right consistency. Creamy, smooth, and easy to drink... a bit more watery than I'd like ideally, but hey, not bad.  D- Well, it seems to be made to be damn easy to drink. Enjoyable, but not killer. Not bad, but not what I was hoping for.... I wanted a little more out of this beer, but I've probably been drinking too many really good stouts lately.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,fank2788,3.49,"On Nitro-tap at The Spot in Bethel, this is definitely better on tap than it is either in the can or the bottle. Looks about the same, which is pretty close to amazing. A bit more malt in the nose same thing for the taste definitely more malt bitterness when this beer is out of the tap. The mouthfeel is very nice the real nitrogen injection makes this incredibly smooth and soft on the tongue. Drinkability is not bad either because again there is just enough taste to keep you mildly interested while the low alcohol makes it highly sessionable.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BigBry,3.73,"Tall and thin, tapered, 330 ml bottle with a plastic shrink wrapped label. Production date on side of label, but no serving instructions, poured into a standard pint glass. Popping the cap and you hear the familiar fizz and bubbling from other nitro-enhanced cans. Pouring, you get the expected cascade, as good as the tap from what I see. Dark liquid, black with red hilights, and a thick and creamy, brown foam. Great retention and lacing rings are left behind. Not alot of aroma but there is some roasted malt and coffee. Taste is as expected from Guinness, thin almost watery, with flavor of toasted malt. Creamy smooth yet thin mouthfeel. Guinness Draught isn't strong and flavorful (like the Extra Stout) so it fulfills its expectations.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Lacing is above average, sticking in patches of differing sizes.  S - Rich roasty, slightly caramely malty goodness. Slightly sweet and very creamy.  T/M - Taste starts out thin feeling, a bit sweet then a nice hit of roasted malts and cream. Finish is bitter, creamy and slightly chocolatey tasting. Very little carbonation, leading to an extra smooth drink.  D - Guinness is an excellent beer, nice tasting and very easy to drink.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,shoehornteeth,3.08,"You know, ""nitro-can"" doesn't sound like something meant for human consumption. It sounds like an event on American Gladiator. You can hear the little widget rolling around, like the marble in a can of spray paint. When you pull the tab it releases an angry hiss like an asthmatic cat.  It pours a murky brown, which slowly coagulates into death-black liquid topped with thick meringue head. It looks like an evil root beer float.  The smell brings to mind Lucky Charms, ashtray, and bile.  The taste is very complex. It tastes like day-old burnt coffee. Wait, that wasnt all that complex.  The mouthfeel is disconcerting. Its creamy enough to make me worry about my lactose intolerance. There isnt any carbonation, so there arent any burps. Too bad, I like to burp. Its so heavy, it drops to the bottom of my stomach and settles there like concrete.  Overall, a highly enjoyable and very drinkable beer. Ill definitely have another.  -Shoehornteeth.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Hard to smell it very well either, still, what I did whif was worth wiffing. At first swallow, seemed a bit thin, but gives way to excellent Guinness flavor and body. Unequalled finish too.

Taste starts out roasty but then fades into a sour aftertaste. Creamy but appears to be somewhat bland with very few hints of roast or coffee. Guinness is Guinness (not always to some) and I can say that it's average at best. I've had much better stouts.  However, Guinness makes a great introduction to craft beers, especially stouts. I just know there's better stouts out there.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,MillRat,3.63,"I spent three weeks touring Ireland, and the only thing more consistent than the rain was the ubiquity of Guinness draught. While the impression I got from the folks I conversed with in the various pubs is that the attitude of the Irish toward Guinness/Diagio is kinda ambivalent, I'd remind them that it could be far worse, and I speak from experience. Since ubiquitous beer in the states were the BMC lagers and light lagers, I was actually enjoying having a reasonably flavorful and high quality product quite so readily available.  As long as the publicans maintain their lines, Guinness draught is hard to beat in the session beer category. Roasty enough to keep your attention, yet not so hoppy, malty, sweet, or powerful that it wears out its welcome.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

M - Thin and watery with just the slightest carbonation.  D - Am I missing something? This is the world-famous Guinness beer?

Great theatre watching the tall head overtaken by the liquid and the color is near black and near opaque. Smell is mild-mannered to not there at all. Mosty sharp-sour taste at first and creaminess and malts kick it after, but the aftertaste was bordering on ""huh""? Smooth, medium body mouthfeel and low carbonation. This is more typical, for me of a draft Guinness that the nitro-can I recently reviewed. I have to raise the drinkability score a bit, b/c of the mouthfeel. I still think Guinness fans might be better off with a fresh draft pour or the bottled ""extra stout""",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

T/MF: Not quite sure how this thing got the reputation of a heavy beer, maybe because the people I know who've had this are strick BMC drinkers and compared drinking one of these to eating a rack of lamb. I wish! There was nothing of the sort in this beer. The mouthfeel is indeed creamy but still falls a little flat for my tastes, it goes in a just sits there and is sort of dissapointing. The taste isn't much to write home about either, hints of roasted barley and the smallest hints of coffee as the beer finishes quite lightly and very bland, almost flat it seems.

The first draw is incredibly smooth, medium bodied and satisfying. Rings of foam and lace are left behind with each successive pull. It has a faint roasted malt nose. The taste is distinctively Guinness, with a fine, almost inperceptble, carbonation masking a mild roasty bitterness till the dry finish.

S: Hints of roastiness, chocolates, and smoke, not very substantial, but enjoyable.  T: Roasted malts, coffee, and dark chocolate.  M: Light-bodied, thin, a little too watery for my tastes.

The flavor is also a bit bland. Some faint coffee notes sit behind a decent roasty flavor. The mouthfeel is lightly creamy due to the nitro infused head. The stout itself is a bit watery.

209,754,CortexBomb,3.4,"This is a strange beer to review now, but I had one again for the first time in ages so I thought it would be worthwhile to jot some notes down.  This particular serving was the draught bottle, which is intended to be imbibed straight from the bottle because of the nitro system. The marks in appearance denote what I think of Guinness when I can actually see it. The nose is of the lightly roasted malt variety, not a lot else there, but again, I'm sniffing it out of a bottle.  The flavour on this is the prototypical Irish Dry, it's lightly roasted, somewhat chocolatey, and somewhat sweet with the lightest dash of coffee...though that could be in my mind. The flavour is very subdued to my palate, but that's because I generally drink Old Ales and Russian Imperials.  The mouth on this is standard for the style, but thin in general. It has a bit more body than a beer by the big three, but it's still light. Drinkability is the only area where I really can give this beer a big pat on the back, it's very quaffable, light, and inoffensive to the stomach. Really the definition of a stout session beer.  The bottom line: You can really do a whole lot worse, and a whole lot better. The main appeal of Guinness to me these day is that it is easy to access, as it is available even at places that only serve swill. It's not a particularly depthy beer, but it at least has some flavour profile, and I don't mind having one every once in a while.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,jslot38,3.73,"Collector's Can... cool  Appearance: The notorious cascading effect leaves behind a pitch black body with an off white / egg shell head of about a finger.  Smell: A bit smoked, a bit roasted... nuts, figs, dates, and a bit of baker's chocolate.  Taste: Unlike the extra stout out of the bottle in so many ways. The flavours here are much more subdued. Some initial sweetness quickly cut out by roasted barley and a touch of chocolate and coffee beans. That sweetness returns in the after flavours.  Mouthfeel: Where it lacks in taste it makes up for in mouthfeel. I'll give them this, they have managed to capture that smoothness from the tap.  Drinkability: While a touch filling I don't have any problem putting away that 4 pack in a sitting... and at 4.2%ABV it won't sneak up on you.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Draught's taste is much sweeter than it smells, but the after taste is nutty.  The mouthfeel is amazing, probably the main reason it is such a good beer. It is almost as thick as a milk shake, with very little carbonation.  Guinness Draught is an extremely smooth beer. It is quite filling, so more than a couple will make a person full.

Maybe my palate has evolved, but Im pretty sure theyve changed the product. It still pours beautifully, although Im convinced the head isnt quite as thick and creamy -- and its an eggshell white, rather than the creamy white I remember. Pleasantly mild roasty notes, but not as dry as I remember, and there isnt much of a finish at all.

Really pretty light.  Coffee, dark chocolate and some cocoa powder are the predominate flavors. Slightly burnt. Mostly sweet. Just a little bitter bite on the finish. Light to medium bodied with a smooth and easy drinking finish.  A bit over-rated, definitely better on-tap, but still a classic brew.

For an Irish dry stout, it's the definition. It deserves much more than many a douchebag gives it. Sigh. The appreciation for what this beer has given the world is simply not up to par.  A small child was walking along the road, looking for her mother, late one dark night in london. She found a pub, and, recalling her mother to drink the beer with the big 1759 on the label, she went in, wondering if perhaps her mother could be soliciting some business to bring back to the flat. Instead, she met the bartender, jake. Jake told her that her mother, the attractive brunette of about 115 lbs and a chopped haircut, had retired upstairs with a man that was wearing a rolex. katherine, for that was the little girl's name, thought a rolex was a type of filing system for papers and phone numbers. She wondered why her mommy would spend her whole retirement with an accountant. But jake, for that was the bartender's name, offered a new drink for her to taste. When she saw it, she was afraid. But England doesn't protect children from the amazing wiles of the dark. Katherine took a gulp. It tasted like whipped cream on top of the blackest soot-tea in the world. she took another. and another. soon she was joyful and frolicking, looking for her mommy or her uncle joe to take her home before she ate too much brie.

The bottle is dark and completely covered by a label, preventing me from seeing the liquid inside. I can only imagine that this beer is dark with a creamy tan head. Also, being from the bottle, there's very little scent that comes through, but what makes it out is very slightly nutty/coffee/roasted.  Taste, something I can easily measure on this one, was similar to the scent. It was weak, but there were some roasted bitter nutty coffee flavors in there. I also noticed a slight metallic taste to it. I'm not sure where that came from but it's there.  It felt very watered down. This is not the Guinness I remember. I remember it being heavier, but this feels very thin and watery, although thicker than a light beer.

The aroma is metallic nitrogen and a little sweet grainy chocolate and leathery coffee.  The flavor is pretty bland - watery, earthy grains, a little coffee with a slightly bitter roasted charcoal finish. The mouthfeel is fairly light and very watery.  Overall, this is not as good as I remember Guinness being. Maybe it's because I'm looking at it more critically. It's just slightly better than BMC beers.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

This is a very drinkable beer. I had this right after i had a harp lager, and this beer was far more enjoyable.

209,754,Quej,3.71,"A - Pours pitch black and thick, with great amounts of thick creamy coloured head. I have to admit for a macro brewed beer, they sure make it look great!  S - Smells sweet mostly, with hints of caramel and toffee. The bitterness ofhops is apparent as well as some roasted maltiness.  T - It first strike you as some bitter black fluid you probably shouldn't be drinking, but then dark roasted coffee beans and cocoa come flooding onto your palate. Heavy roasted, burnt malts compliment the taste of unsweetened chocolate and bitter, leafy hops. The beer is so thick it almost seems to stay in your mouth after you swallow, letting you taste the dark malts all over again. As it warms up, the beer begins to slide toward the bitter end, but slight cereal tastes of oats, and perhaps wheat, emerge.  M - Incredibly thick, drying and rough. Almost like old motor oil with crushed up leaves in it. The thickness makes for a long lasting aftertaste, which if you like this beer can be a good thing.  D - This beer is not so drinkble due to its incredible thickness, yet somehow I find myself able to go through several cans in a good night.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,SaltyLime,4.16,"Years ago, this was my first of the dark beers and I resisted at first.  Appearance - I agree with many of the other raters...definitely one of the most gorgeous beers I have ever seen. It comes out perfect every time.  Smell - Not a very strong smell, light coffee and dark chocolate is the first thing I sensed.  Taste - Just like it smells. Regrettably, it does have a little watery taste, but with so many other mouth watering flavors it was easy to overlook.  Mouthfeel - Very smooth and creamy. Seemed to be a little thicker after it warmed up a little bit.  Drinkability - It goes down easy. Foamy head stays to the end  After a little open mindedness and beer maturity, it has become one of my regulars.  Rating based on overall comparison between tap, bottle and can.. Appearance from tap has a creamier head and the body was thicker than what comes from the nitro-bottle or nitro-can. Also had this beer on tap while passing through Ireland and Spain.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,InsolublePancake,3.32,"A- Almost black, some brown around the edges of the glass. It retains a creamy tan head of about a half an inch for the entire time I'm drinking it. Oh, and of course there's the whole falling bubbles thing going on too.  S- Not much here. At first I thought that it was because the beer was served too cold, but it didn't really improve as it warmed. A little roasted malt and that's it.  T- Roasted malt and coffee along with some molasses and cocoa. A bitter burnt flavor lingers on the finish.  M- Nice and creamy but a little thin.  D- Definitely a strength. Incredibly smooth and low in alcohol. Great session beer.  I really appreciate Guinness for what it is. I don't usually order it, but it's always there for when I want it. A nice Irish Stout that I'm sure many craft beer lovers cut their teeth on. It's not the best stout in the world, but it serves its purpose well. Recommended.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,stevehagy,3.94,The perfect pour of Guinness is a piece of art. At first all you see is black with almost no head but then you start seeing the downward flowing bubbles and mysterious swirls of tan and amber as the head slowly forms into a tan masterpiece. Although it looks black it is light and non filling. Truly a great classic.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,tapman,2.58,"Why, nitro, why?!  Ok, this is an easy one. It looks good. The bottle sucks, but the can (featured in this review) is far superior. A dark ruby color when poured is preceded by a cascade of carbonation signature to the Guinness line. Head is off-white, but not tan like you would hope.  My first 1 ever. I can't smell anything. The nitro's metalic tinge masks all other smells. When I put my nose to the empty can I get some chocolate malts, but I'm not reviewing the can here. God I hate nitros.  Tastes like a Guiness which in a pub would garner a 4 for taste, but much more watered-down than from the tap. I don't dig the nitro-widget and it appears to be more of a gimmick than an actual colaborator with the beer.  Once again this suffers due to wateryness. Better than a Macro lager, but short of the standards that Guinness reminds us of everyday on T.V., bus sides, bill boards, etc.  Guinness will always have a special place in my heart. It was the first beer that lured me away from being an ignorant Miller Lite drinker and introduced me to a world of flavor, but my intake is now limited to tap-only and I won't pay more than $4 for one now that I am of the enlightened ranks.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Crystufer,4.36,"A - This beer is simply gorgeous to behold. The red that becomes black, the downward flowing bubbles, and the lovely head all come together to create a lovely appearance for this beer. S - Smells bitter and mineraly. Not initially inviting, but after the first one, it lets you know the delicious guiness is coming. T - Also a bit bitter and mineraly. Took a few to get used to, (Not all tonight. I'm sober I swear.) but now the hoppy flavor and refreshing aftertaste are good friends of mine. M - I absolutely love the way this feels swishing around in my mouth. It tastes thick and syrupy, but still swishes like a liquid. Also doesn't have any of the watery feel you'd expect from (insert beer here)-light. Very satisfying sliding down your throat. D - I enjoy this beer quite a bit, and can drink 5 or 6 in a row if it's all that's around, but it's quite filling and thick tasting. I need to switch after a few if I have the option. But it leads into and back out of a nice whit nicely.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,vanrassel,3.42,"That little widget in the can sure does the trick: a majestic light tan head formed in my pint glass atop a layer of mesmerizing, cascading bubbles and a dark brown body. The head eventually settled into a creamy, one-finger cap that left attractive rings on the sides of my glass.  I ignored the idiotic instruction to ""serve extra cold"" and let the beer sit for awhile before continuing. Even when it warmed, it was hard to pick out much of an aroma, other than a muted whiff of roasted barley.  Roasted barley is the main feature of the taste, though I've always detected a faint nuttiness and a hint of black licorice in Guinness Draught. The creamy mouthfeel and dry finish are bang on, but the body is a tad thin.  Despite the quibbles  and the existence of much better stouts  this is a good, crowd-pleasing standby.

Appearance: I love the look of Guinness Draught as the bubbles appear to fall down and it becomes black then...so cool looking. It also maintains a nice head throughout the drink.

209,754,repeal06,4.11,"Ahh, Guinness. My introduction to ""dark beer"", back in my college days. Not much I can say that hasn't already been said. This is one of, if not THE, prettiest beer there is. Poured from a nitro-can, the cascading effect is hypnotizing, resulting in a head that just doesn't quit. The lacing on the edge of the glass after each sip is equally impressive. Tastes...like a Guinness. Not as fantastic as I remember that first sip being, but still pretty good. Mouthfeel is a bit disappointing - more watery than I remember. But, that makes it easy to drink. People who say Guinness is ""too heavy"" need to have their heads examined. The relatively light mouthfeel and average ABV make this a very drinkable beer - I try to keep a few in my fridge at all times.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Appearance is key , fills up nice and pretty whenever poured, very creamy foamy head at first, and black as night.  The smell is very meaty, kinda like beef steak with pure water.  Taste is nice as well , I always like mean stouts , but for a home beer , this is a great way to get the draught affect. Very smooth and creamy kinda like a root beer float without the root-beer taste.  Mouthfeel is pretty goot as well , goes down easy and has no nasty after taste.  Drinkabilitity is amazing , since this is a dry stout and is kinda like water , very easy to drink all day and go for that stout buzz. Amazing beer with or with another beer...

Taste: Some roasted barley bitterness and the slightest hint of dark chocolate. Overall, very bland and watery.  Mouthfeel: Low carbonation level. Body is thin and watery.  Drinkability: Many times, this is the only non light beer available in bars, so I find myself with this in my hand a decent amount.

209,754,albern,3.38,"What more can be said about Guinness. This clearly isn't as good as what you will find on tap at a bar that has fresh Guinness that knows how to pour it. The right experience on tap can be exhilirating. I still want to go to the Guinness plant and have it at peak freshness in order to compare it to the best of what we get on this side of the Atlantic. Having said all that, the nitro can is decent, creamy, and a reasonable take home alternative. The smell is a little tinny, but good and malty. The taste is water, roasted barley malt, and a little bit of tin. The lacing is excellent, if you want to call it lacing, in that it billows on the sides of your glass. There is no sweetness in this beer, very dry, all malt, no bitterness, lots of water. It isn't a strong beer by any standards and the alcohol taste is completely absent. The cream is good right out from the pour, but it does dissipate a bit towards the end of the pint glass. I like Guinness, always have, and it works in the right setting, complementing the right food. It's better on tap, and I'm sure better across the Atlantic, but if you crave a dry, malty, Irish stout, this is where you have to begin. You don't have to end here since Beamish or Murphy's is probably a better next stop. L'Chaim",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BretSikkink,2.91,"Um..what's all the fuss? There is very little redeeming in this brew. Nice black appearance with that cool Guinness head, nice cascading effect in the pour. There is almost no smell beyond a slight grain aroma, no roast like the Extra Stout. In the same way that Budweiser tastes ""watered-down"", so too with the Draught. The texture is by far the most redeeming feature of this schlock: creamy and full, hampered by thinness, but I'm willing to dole out the 4. Sorry to see such a venerable brand brought down by the bottom line. Boo Diageo.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Georgiabeer,2.88,"Thia isn't the greatest beer on the planet and its a far cry from the best of the Guinness products, but it does offer a certain amount of refreshment on a hot day with more flavor than a macro offers. This is by far the lightest stout I have ever tried,and the bottle is my least favorite method for drinking it. Pours a very dark brown with the trademark cascading effect in the glass Some okay lacing as well. The smell is thin,but there are some roasted grain and bitter chocolate notes as well as a slight whiff of iron. The taste is very thin with more lightly toasted grain and metal. Mouthfeel is creamy and refreshing and that combined with the low abv means you can definitely toss them down- just not a lot to keep you interested.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,marcobrau,3.12,"I had a nitro-can of this after having the bottled Extra Stout.  I immediately noticed a difference in this stout versus the bottled version in terms of appearance; this version of Guinness was lighter (more the color of cola) with a lighter, more off-white (compared with light tan) head. The nitro pour produced a flatter, denser head, too.  The aroma was fairly neutral, with the faintest hint of espresso. The mouthfeel (big surprise) was very smooth. I tasted some caramel flavors up front mixed with roasted coffee, which became assertive towards the finish, which was fairly dry. Overall, a more this is Guinness light compared to the Extra Stout, and less interesting -- but also more quaffable -- and that's the idea.

The taste was good, not super cold so the taosted malts faired well along with some roasted coffee bean and chocolate.  The mouthfeel was real nice at first, good thick, yet soft and smooth.

209,754,AustinBeerLvr,3.51,"This is one of the most mixed beer reviews I have ever written as drinking this tonight on tap it seemed to taste completely different than it ever has before, regardless of the source. I normally would never order this brew, but I figured in the spirit of St. Patrick's Day, I would do so.  A: A creamy head on top of a fairly dark looking body. However, there isn't a whole lot of body in this brew.  S: This is the most dissapointing aspect of this brew, as there just simply isn't much in the way of the nose on this at all. That said, there isn't anything really off either.  T: Okay, here is where the mystery comes in. In the past, I swear this brew has tasted much creamier, heavier, and had a lot more coffee flavor. I have never tasted it in Ireland, but my girlfriend who was with me tonight took a sip, as said that it tasted much more like it does in Ireland. To me, tonight's two pints I had tasted very refreshing, leafy, minty, with just a hint of the creamy head in the beginning which faded quickly. The finish is basically light with just a hint of hop bitterness. Like I said before, seems very different, as I saw a Guinness truck outside, I am guessing the keg must have been very fresh.  M: Kind of thin for a stout, the body of it reminds me more of a easy drinking lager.  D: It's my understanding that this brew is meant to be consumed a few pints (or more) at Irish celebrations. As stated above, the pints I had tonight were much lighter than what I remember before. Almost weant down too easy. Very good, very refreshing. However, if this is what true Guinness tastes like, it might actually be a little too light for the style. That said, I still enjoyed it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Unfortunately that is the only good thing about this beer. Not much smell, some light roasted malt small. The taste is pretty awful, tastes watery over pasturized, not much flavor at all.

Pours nearly black in color with ruby hints at the edges and a light tan head that ultimately settles to about a half inch after the beautiful cascade effect. Smells of sweet roasted malts. Taste is dominated by the sweet roasted malts but there is also a nice bitterness there as well. Good mouthfeel. Very light in body. Great drinkability due to the low abv, light body and the beauty that is a properly drawn pint.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The flavor isn't as roasty as most microbrewed stouts, but there is a hint of chocolate in the aftertaste. Sweet but pleasant. The mouthfeel is thin - definitely not as viscous as stouts tend to be. It's pretty drinkable, though perhaps a little too much carbonation. In all, a safe alternative to Bud, but it will not satisfy hardcore beer geeks accustomed to Shakespeare Stout and the like.

T - If my eyes were closed, I wouldn't take this for any style of stout, more due to the wter-like mouthfeel. Mild coffee & earthy/biscuity flavors are still there, but they all float in the background...nothing really takes a stand as the dominant taste.  M - One of the worst bodies I've yet sampled...more due to my own expectations for this beer. I was assuming it had a thicker body with some kind of bold finish...extremely thin body with little carbonation and a slightly dry finish.

Malts and bitterness come on gradually and linger in the aftertaste (especially when warmer). M: Chewy which is really surprising giving the ultra light body (for the style).

209,754,Liquids,3.79,"Insane and drunk bartender is obsessed with pouring a beer with no head; ""it's all beer!"" he proudly proclaims. But a thin creamy head remains and never quite turns to scum. Black but reddish around the edges, and the head is an off white. The smell is really nothing special, as we know. I ususally don't bother smelling this unless by force of habit...but the taste--what could be more palatable and feel like a meal? It's totally non threatening, no charred notes, no excess sweetness, just a faint smooth roasty brew that gives the sensation of filling the mouth, has a touch of sourness which makes you want to sip it again, and one that both by ABV and easy of consumption defines session beer. I nearly always want another. I've tended to mock Guinness in the past and I typically won't stock it in favor of the occasional Murphy's, but I'm never sad if it's the best beer on tap, because it's a good beer to drink, and works well with most food, too. And otherwise it might have been a Bud or nothing. I rarely sip a Guinness and end up feeling disappointed.  Lots of not-quite beer drinkers adore this brew but know nothing about beer. That makes it hard for some to admit that, even with their refined beer palate and expansive microbrew knowledge, Guinness too IS good, for what it is, but not, and the inexperienced might shout ""the best beer in the world!"" as there is no such thing.

209,754,Kendo,3.59,"A: Poured from a 14.9 oz pub can into a pint glass, it does that whole nitrous cascade thing. Body is dark brown -- bordering on black but not quite there -- with ruby hues on the edges when held to the light. A 1-finger creamy, foamy beige/khaki-colored head sits atop the body and is well-retained. Leaves lots of splotches of foamy lacing on the side of the glass -- almost a wall of foam, really -- and some solid rings as well when I let it sit still long enough to settle in one place.  S: Very, very faint: roasted malt and a hint of bitter coffee. But not at all the least bit strong.  T: Like the nose, it's relatively light in flavor, and like the nose, the first impression is of roasted malt and coffee bitterness. A slight burnt charcoal or burnt coffee flavor is present, with a dry, metallic bitter finish that lingers into the aftertaste. Some sweetness from the malt is more evident as it warms.  M: Very light, almost watery in fact.  D: Easily consumed in massive quantities due to its light heft and low ABV. I've been known to put down a dozen to fifteen of these in a night, no problem. A session beer if there ever was one.  Notes: A good Guinness every now and again -- preferably on tap --is still a treat, though my tastebuds have moved on from a beer that I used to drink seemingly by the gallon. On the positive side, it's a nice looking beer with the cascading nitro effect, and it's very drinkable because it's so light. There is some flavor there, but it's not nearly as interesting as other stouts. And it really doesn't smell or feel like much at all. Funny that so many folks look at this beer and think ""ohmigod -- it's so DARK and HEAVY"" and miss the boat entirely. A good beer to have around the house for guests, and like I said, you can drink a lot of 'em without getting too full or drunk.

209,754,kajerm,3.27,"This review could be a beautiful, touching retrospective, but it won't be.  Pours an absolutely stunning black with a deep ruby hue that only shows up in the light. Initially cascading tan nitro bubbles that settle out into a black beer witha majestic white cap. The Guinness Draught nitro-head is legendary, a mountain of creamy bubbles sinking into the beer.  The smell is pretty thin-- dark-roasted malt is pretty much all I could pick up here, and I'm really reaching here.  The flavor profile isn't overwhelmingly complex, but that's not what this beer is about-- it's simple black malt bitterness and drop of coffee flavor. I've had tastier, more interesting stouts, but it'd be pretty hard to hate Guinness on tap.  Mouthfeel is creamy and heavy-- it's pretty hard to forget you're drinking a nitro-beer when it feels like a milkshake in your mouth. Call it ""cheating"" if you want to, but that silky nitro-palate is pretty incredible.  Mouthfeel notwithstanding, Guinness is pretty damned drinkable as far as stouts go. I suppose the low ABV and diminished malt character help here, as does the bitterness. I remember pounding these back in the day and people acting like it was magic.  All told, I expected to be more disappointed than I was. Tastewise, this is a bog -standard dry stout, but the classic characteristics (almost all of them nitrogen-derived) hold the beer together and make for a sessionable brew that you can get at your local ass-bar.

Pitch black coloring with one or two finger creamy tan head. The cascade may have settle a little quicker pouring from the can compared to served off a bar tap. Tons of lace sticks down the glass. S: Some sweet and roasty flavors come through the nose. T: Dark roasted malt brings out that familiar coffee flavor, with a slight hint of chocolate. The malt also gives off a sharp astringent, almost metallic flavor (not exclusive to the can version but definitely more pronounced.) After the initial taste, a slight floral hoppiness comes through, but not too much. Despite the huge reputation, it comes off a little bland. M: Thinner than the tap version. D: Not quite as tasty or high quality as on tap, but good enough to have a few.  Not as good as at the bar, but I'll always have one or two in the fridge just to be safe.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,dciskey,3.81,"Pour from a 14.9oz nitro barely fits into a 16oz pint glass. I'm guessing it's 14.9 instead of 16 so that it fits in our wee American pints. Pours black with ruby edges, along with about a thumb's worth of head. Good retention and great lace.  Smell is of roasted barley and a touch of hops. Taste is bitter from the barley, with some malt complexity on the back end. No chocolate or faint sweetness as in Murphy's; the end is more like coffee beans. Mouthfeel is what you expect from a nitro stout; it's kind of thin but not watery, with a certain creaminess. More like milk, maybe? Drinkability's great; the ABV is low and it's not heavy. Sessioner, definitely.  Some people expect a lot out of this beer because of the hype or because they resent the hype or because they feel like being overly critical. It's not a meal in a glass and you shouldn't expect it to be (if they started doing ""drink Guinness instead of eating? Brilliant!"" ads maybe you could expect it). It is a quite drinkable nitro Irish stout. It's not as good as Murphy's, but it's still a nice stout for an evening out (better if bars didn't charge quite as much for it) or a long card game. If you're looking for something beefy, you've come to the wrong beer, and you should have known that. To me this lines up with Murphy's and Beamish, with the only distinction being some small taste differences.  One interesting thing is that having it from the can eliminates the effect that a bar's tap and lines can have on the beer. I definitely have to wonder if I haven't been to a few bars that were a little lax with their cleanliness.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Cyberkedi,4.78,"There is nothing quite like classic Guinness, especially served on-tap. From a bottle or can is OK, but there is only one way to drink Guinness - from the tap, nice and cool (3-6 degrees Celsius).  Its dark color - dark and opaque as finest dark chocolate - and rich head with tiny compact bubbles promise an excellent beer. The flavor is strong and a little smoky, with plenty of hoppy bitterness. Smooth as silk and thick but not heavy, it is truly a legend.  I tasted this at the Guinness Believer event in Atlanta, to confirm why I am a Guinness devotee.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

I do was blind to the beauty of this wonderful brew at one point, pouring my first out of a nitro can and wondering what the hell all of the fuss was about over this black milk.  Then I went to Ireland. Maybe it tastes different over there but man this beer is world class. The roasted malts and the frothy mouthfeel are nothing short of addictive. The appearence is simply the best of any beer I have ever seen and believe will ever see, if there was a rating of ten I would give it that. In fact I believe a rating of ten should be created for Guinness alone.  Guinness is definately a change of pace if you're drinking nothing but American Stouts. Many people go in expecting that same flavor and are severely disappointed. Don't be. Give it a chance and you'll find that this brew has a beauty all its own.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,DogFood11,2.35,Guinness is great to look at with its cascade effect and brilliant color of a dark ruby outside and a robust black core. The untra creamy off white head sits atop this irish dry stout for the entire tasting.  Its a confusing beer of sorts although its a confusing style for my palate as well. Its very delicate and a bit watered wich is the furthest thing from what I expect on appearance alone. This is a very easy drinking beer that requires little thought. There are some interesting subtleties like the chocolate underbelly but its quickly squashed by a watered backend. Finishes up with a nice coffee bean flavor.  Notes: Its just alright at best. As it warmed up this actually gets worse as there is a slightly astringent middle.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Poured that famed dark guinness color with 2 fingers of tan head. Thick lacing on glass when swirled. Smells of nice chocolaty and nutty scents, very pleasant to the nostril. Taste is good, chocolatey followed by a coffee taste. I would like to try other stouts to compare. Unique when compared with other types of beers. Not as thick as it may look, but still quite thick, definatley not a beer to get drunk off of as it is filling and of a lower abv. A great full bodied beer that everyone must try at least once, the pride of Ireland.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It tastes just like it smells, creamy and smooth. This brew goes down so easily, you could easily have one or two and not even feel guilty about going for a third. I have to say the mouthfeel is definitely better on tap. In fact on tap is definitely the way to go with this brew, but I'll take it either way.  This is the best brew just to have in the fridge at all times. Not something that you expect to be complex, and full of artistry and masterfulness. It is what it is...old faithful.

Drinkability - Quite smooth, very easy to drink. Excellent session beer.  A.K.A. ""Vitamin G"". I for one am darn glad that they enjoy the distribution that they have (prefer Murphy's).

209,754,SMark,4,Two part pour with thick creamy head. Amber-dark chocolate color as best I could tell with the lighting. No noticeable carbonation or bubbles.  Roasted malt with coffee providing a bit of sharpness to the olfactory system. Could almost smell the thick creamy head.  Bitter coffee taste which caused some in the group to wrinkle up their noses. Not as bitter as cold coffee but a good marriage of the hops and malt to bring out just the right coffee flavor.  Everything leads up to a good mouthfeel that can be swished around in order to extract all the flavors of this beer. Savory.  A good sipping beer that takes a little effort in order to really appreciate all there is to offer. I usually do not drink more than 2 or 3 of these in a sitting as it seems like a great deal of work past that point. Good beer all around.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

(what?!?) very creamy in the mouth, which i like, with flavors of milk, chocolate, coffee, and mild roasted elements. everything is extremely balanced and rounded out, which has its advantages and draw-backs. very enjoyable, easy to drink many of. often this is a go-to beer when in a primarily-macro environment.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Smell is sour and weak. Faint hint of chocolate malt, maybe some licorice. Very watery on the palate. Some faint roastiness is present, along with some sweetness. Tastes like it's got potential, but intentionally dumbs down the flavor.  Mouthfeel is very smooth. Very little carbonation makes this super drinkable. Definite session material, due to the lack of any artificial BMC adjunct notes.  Guinness seems like it has incredible potential, but in order to make $, it dumbs everything down for the NASCAR fanatic, Bud Lite drinking, streotypical American palate. I understand they have mortgages to pay, but it's a shame they have to compromise what could be a quality product.  If Guinness would brew a beer with some character (besides their extra stout, which is too sweet), and export it to the US, I believe they would have a lucrative market, if they would be willing to give it a shot.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,JimFalzone,4.63,"I was surprise to see the low reviews on these nitro cans. I personally think the concept (and results) are genius. It's the best way to drink a stout at home if you don't happen to have your own nitrous system and tap.  The ""widget"" makes the perfect carbonation every time. And the appearance is stellar. It's like watching a pint sized lava lamp as the tan foam mixes with the black stout.  Besides just drinking these by themselves, it's always a treat to buy some Bass and make black & tans at home.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,zymurgy4all,4.26,"I got this at the local liquor store, and enjoyed it more than I thought. This beer proves that it is possible to can a beer and make it taste wonderful. Guinness is a wonderful beer, and no matter how they ship it (canned, bottled), it comes out great. There is no way to compete with the nitro plastic rocket-ship thing that infuses the nitrogen when you open it. Pour this in a glass without hesitation, and you get the perfect head. For those who think Guinness is heavy, stop looking at the color. This is a light bodied beer that has the flavor of all beers. The carbonation level is lower, which combined with the black color, makes people assume it is heavy. This isn't true as I've had plenty of these, and I think that once you get past the color, you will find it is highly drinkable. In addition, its alcohol level is low, so it is more nutritious than some other beers.  This beer is one reason why I started homebrewing (German Hefe being another), and if you haven't had it already, you must have hit this site by accident.

209,754,Sconnie,4.04,"I've always loved Guinness Draught from the bottle, but I had the opportunity to drink this from the tap in Dublin and it was an experience. Appearance: Guinness is the archetype for stout, especially in appearance. Watching the white head foam up out of the black body of the beer, waiting for it to settle out...anticipation makes the drink that much better. Smell: roasty with coffee like overtones. Taste: A great stout. The pure roasted barley goodness comes through as the strongest flavor, and that's the flavor that I love in a good stout. Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy, exactly like it's supposed to be. Drinkability: One of the best aspects of Guinness is that it has plenty of flavor and yet is smooth and very drinkable.

A: After the beautiful cascade of bubbles subsides, the beer is a pitch black color with a very dense off-white head that fades at extremely slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is of creamy chocolate and roasted malt and overall it’s a little stronger than most beers that I’ve had in the style.  T: I typically don’t use the same words to describe a beer’s taste as I do a beer’s smell, but as I sip the beer, creamy chocolate and roasted malt are the first words that come to mind. There’s a little bit of smokiness to it and although there’s a little bit more flavor than other beers that I’ve had in the style, the taste just seems weak overall.  M: Very smooth, heavy body, light carbonation, finish is dry but a little bit sticky.  D: Within the style this beer is tasty, but it’s not a style that I favor. It goes down very easily which has caused this beer to gain so much appeal. I used to think that I couldn’t handle this beer, but after having tried a wide range of high ABV beers and knowing that this beer has the ABV of a Light Lager, I now realize that I simply don’t like it.

Guinness is, for my money, a gorgeous looking beer - this may be a function of the nitro-can, but nothing beats the pitch black pour and the perfect tan head that sticks around forever. It's beautiful. But the smell and taste disappoint. The smell is odd - kind of like tomato soup and cheap coffee. The taste is, well, almost non-existent. There is a very faint coffee bitterness followed by slight sweetness, reminds me of flavored water. Mouthfeel is thin - there's no carbonation and slight creaminess, but too thin.

What else is out there?""  ...well, at least that's how it was for me and I figure it probably happens to others.  One might jump to conclusions and immediately claim that Guinness is the best beer in the entire world. It's not (not at all). It's too tasteless and unidimensional. It's a bit watery. But it is one helluva drinkable beer, its cascading pour looks fantastic, and it's a fun beer to enjoy all night long.

I love the smell of this stuff, there isn't a better smelling stout in the world, even if its from a can.  Taste, eeh. This is where the cans fall short IMHO. You can sort of realize this resemble what it should, a world class Irish stout. If you let it warm up a bit out of the fridge you can get some of the malt complexity to come out, but don't expect the moon here.  This beer goes down like a champ, thanks again to our friend nitro.

Drinkability: The definition of Irish dry stout. A great everyday drinking beer.  Always follow the 2 min. pour rule. Guinness Draught is best served at 6°C (thats 42.8°F), with the legendary two-part pour. First, tilt the glass to 45 degrees and carefully pour until three quarters full.

Probably the only time that will ever happen. Anyway, it is black, presumably, and because I cannot actually see it I just gave it a 3 for appearance. It smells roasted, with coffee, oats? and an interesting character that kept saying ""ash-tray,"" although it isn't as bad as that implies. It tastes the same with the addition of a mild bitterness on top of a smooth, lactic body with low carbonation (nitration maybe is the correct word?) and a medium finish.

At only 4.1%, the alcohol never made itself known, and it ended up tasting like a glass of dark, foamy water. There was no bite to the mouthfeel, and the finish was wet, short and slightly moldy.

A: Pours a jet-black, and you can pour nitro beers all day in front of me and I'll watch the reverse cascade every time. Every time. Creamy light tan head on top that lasts for the entire beer.  S: Hmm. I'm not getting much here. A hint of roasted malt and some smokiness, but it's not assertive at all.  T/M: Not one of the bigger stouts out there, but what's here is certainly enjoyable. Very mild roastiness, mild smokiness, mild creaminess; so, overall, the theme here is that it's a mild beer. Finish is mildly dry, nicely bitter, and has a very light, burnt tail. Mouthfeel is creamy, but this sucker goes flat if you nurse it. Hell, if you take too long in the bathroom it might be flat by the time you get back.

209,754,theopholis,3.49,"Poured into a pint glass.  Appearance- Poured completely black into my pint glass. Even when held up to the light. Wow. This is some dark stuff. Just a little burgandy at the edges of the glass. The truly amazing thing is the way the head falls tho. It has a thick, light tan, tight head that appears to cascade through itself. It's truly an amazing site. Like the add says, Guinness is a beer made for all 5 senses.   Aroma- Dark roasted grains with a hint of malt sweetness are the 1st things you smell.  Flavor- Starts out with roasted malt and some coffee overtones. Nice milky sweetness at the finish.  Mouthfeel- Creamy and smooth. Perfect carbonation level. Medium body, but it's a little thin for the style. Still....very nice.  Drinkability. Yum. If you like U.K. stouts, you will definately like this beer. If not, then quit reading this review right now. Anyway...it's nicely balanced in all respects, and the Nitrogen charging makes a good beer great.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,NeroFiddled,4.06,"Typical Guinness in a bottle with a widget rather than can. I don't really get it. It's in the bottle so you can drink it out of the bottle, right? Since when did it become so hard to find glassware? Hell, a plastic pint glass will do. But I guess this is all about show. In any case, I found it no different from the canned version. I didn't think the widget did as good a job, but that was with a single pour with just a few pauses along the way.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,olegv40,4.51,"Out of all my friends there is only one person that likes Guinness as much as I do, most of the other one just give me weird looks as they order macroswill. Absolutely hands down, my favorite beer, brings a huge smile to my face when a cold one is put in front of me.  The color is sublime and the head is there all the way through. It is always hard for me to describe the taste of stout to other people, but in comparison to other stouts I've had this one reaches the best balance, its not too bitter, not too heavy, the perfect roasted flavor without overpowering, Works great with just about any type of food, and is light enough to drink by itself. Ive had it both on tap and in the nitro can, and I find that they are indistinguishable from each other.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,zuggy9,4.14,"It's a bit hard for me to be partial here, as Guinness was my introduction to stout, but here goes. For me, the appearance of a well poured Guinness is stellar. The deep rich near-black mahogany tint of it, while the flow of bubbles seems to defy physics is near magical. It causes me near pain to see this pulled off a draft by someone not skilled. A strong coffee flavored aroma filled you with hints of grain, and the taste is comparable with definite chocolate and smoke notes. The mouth feel is smooth and creamy and finishes nicely. Very drinkable, whether draft, widget bottle or nitro-can.  Always great poured over a bent spoon atop Bass Pale Ale or Harp Lager as well!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,joe1510,3.63,"11.2oz. Bottle  Poured completely black into my pint glass. When held to the light there are mahogany highlights around the edges of the glass. A tan creamy head sat on top of the body that left sheet lacing. The cascade wasn't as good as I've seen from the cans or on tap. Still looks good though.  The first smell to hit is one of dark roasted grains. There is a creamy quality that mellows the roastiness. Ends with a rather strong smell of smoke. The smell isn't very complex but it all goes together pretty well.  Flavor is very much like the smell. Starts out with roasted malts. Bitter coffee grounds show up mid palate but are slowed by a milk creaminess. There is a mild coffee ground bitterness that finishes things off.  Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Mild carbonation. My only complaint is it seems a bit too thin. The body could be a little creamier.  The thinner body lends itself nicely to the drinkability. Tastes good enough to have a couple. I think this tastes better on tap but it's a solid stout out of the bottle.  Now in a new plastic wrapped bottle with instructions at the bottom that state ""serve extra cold"". They must relly be trying to get to the masses with that and the cheesy bottle wrapping. Beyond that it's a pretty good easily found stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Avagadro,2.34,"Packaged in the 11.2oz nitro bottle. There is no information given about freshness, but some nutriant info is given, and there is the cool widget inside the bottle. When the cap is popped, you hear the nitrogen bubbling through the beer. This beer is one of the more impressive looking beers out there. As it was poured into my Bell's pint glass, a creamy head instantly formed, with nitrogen bubbles cascading to the bottom of the glass. After settiling a bit, a creamy tan half inch head remains throughout the whole experience. The beer is very dark, hints of brown are visible when held to the light, but this brew is pretty opaque. Aroma presents a creamy roastyness, with a mild sour side. Not a whole lot of flavor. Dry, faint hints of roasted malt are present. There is a slight sourness to this beer, according to charlie papazian, guiness adds a bit of pasteurized sour beer to each batch of guiness. Overall a pretty bland tasting beer. The mouthfeel is decently thick, as a stout should be, but something seems to be missing, maybe not thick enough? This is an enjoyable brew, but unfortunately it costs about $8.50 for a sixer of 11.2oz bottle. When I go to the store and I see small bottles of guiness for the same price as regular bottle of Bell's double cream stout, I choose the Bell's. If this were cheaper, I'd like it more, but it's just not worth it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,beeragent,4.46,"Poured from a nitro-can, into a pint glass. This has to be one of the best beers, appearance wise. The beer pours a fantastic 1inch head, that never quite goes away, leaving some nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is very creamy, kind of like chocolate milk. The taste is much like the aroma, being very creamy, with a slight chocolaty flavor. The mouthfeel is a little thin, IMO, for a stout. This is an exceptionally easy beer to drink. A great session beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,ekempey,3.99,"Served on tap into a pint glass, this beer has a very well retained head, as well as good lacing. At first the smell is smokey, with hints of nuts. The beer feels great and is well carbonated, not too much. A very smokey taste, with caramel flavorings coming out. First time having one, and it went down smooth. I will definately try this agian next time I'm out.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,rodrot,3.53,"Poured a dark brown color with the faintest of light just barely shining through the glass. There was a large creamy head that is typical for the nitro stouts. Aroma was malty with just a hint of roasted malt. Taste was coffeeish and roasty with a light sourness in the finish. Mouthfeel was light, creamy and smooth making this very drinkable. This type of stout lacks the character that the regular bottled version is known for, but it's not a bad brew at all and is very sessionable with it's light character and low alcohol. Given a choice between the standard macro light beers and this, the Guinness draft wins every time.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,jmbranum,4.15,"I poured about half the bottle into a glass so I could test it both in and out of the bottle (this is one the nitro-bottles), and I must say that I think this is an improvement over the nitro-can version of Guinness Draught.  Very dark brown if held up to the light, but pretty close to black. The head is a nice creamy off-white. Quite attractive.  The aroma has some roasted malt notes with a tinge of coffee. The flavor is full, with lots of nice roasted malt, some coffee, maybe a tiny bit of chocolate, and a rather nice bitter aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.  The negative of this beer is that it is not terribly complex. Compared to other stouts that I enjoy, Guinness Draught seems to be rather one-dimensional. I do prefer Guinness Extra Stout or some of the American stouts to this, but compared to the canned draught version (or what you sometimes get on tap), this is an improvement.  As far as drinking straight from the bottle, to me the flavor is more concentrated on the bitter notes, but the mouthfeel is a bit more watery.  Lastly, for relatively low-carb beers, this isn't half bad (only 9.9 g per 12 oz.). Much better than most other sub-10g beers.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,GratefulBeerGuy,3.78,"AP: Ahhh...that wonderful cascading effect!! Starts out milk shake colored until the frothy mocha head finally settles at the top and measures 2"" deep. The body settles in as a dark brown color with some burgundy hues in direct light. Gotta love the look of these Irish dry Stouts. My personal favorite look of any style.  Smells: Mocha cappachino with oak and mild chocolate notes, malted barley and nutmeg.  Taste: Oaky&gt;Malted barley&gt;herbal and leafy and a semi-bitter hop. The aftertaste is a nutty malted flavor that finishes leafy.  MF: This has a full body look with a medium body feel, not as creamy smooth as it's rival Murphy's. It still has a smooth feel due to the creamy head, but the body is rather thin feeling.  DA: THe low ABV % makes this an all-day drinker...and you gotta respect the classics.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Derek,3.68,"I'll preface this by saying I'm generally not a fan of dry stouts... and it has taken me years of revisiting this one to acquire a taste for that sour essence.  A: Black with an off-white/light-tan head. Nice cascading effect from their widget. Good retention, only hints of lace (the real draft leaves a nicer lacing).  S: Dry roastyness with a hints of nut, coffee and chocolate.  T: Pleasant dry roastyness isn't overbearing. Flavours of nuts, coffee & chocolate are all very mild. There's a slight saltyness that helps to cut the roasted bitterness. Sour grainyness in the finish. It's an acquired taste, and while interesting, I've never been overly fond of it.  M: Light body is creamy, decent for its weight; lightly carbonated.  D: Flavourful, low in alcohol, easy on the gas, quite drinkable.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BEERchitect,4.18,"First time in a long time. Trying this brew on draught is one of the most classic and endearing moments in beer. The look of the nitro-carbonation sheading the beer and floating to the top is something special. The head retention is basically a milk shake for stout lovers. Slight aromas of roasted grains, chalkiness, and mild souring. Flavors and moderate and firm, ranging from charcoal, roasted grains, mild lactose, and and underlying sweet maltiness. The feel of this beer is always supurb. Full and creamy, then thinning into a powdery, soft finish. Quite dry and fleeting in the aftertaste. It's the taste that defined the style. How can it be anything but great?",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,tatterdash,4.18,"I've reviewed Guinness Draught in every form but Nitro-Bottle, so here goes:  Pours a cascading black with a tightly-packed creamy off-white head (Looks good, despite the bottle saying ""Drink straight from the bottle""). Lots of gloppy lacing as only Guinness can do. Aroma is nice fresh Guinness Draught. Coffee grounds, burnt toast, lots of roasted malt. Taste is creamy coffee front, roasted malty middle, and slightly sour burnt finish. Mouthfeel was creamy smooth. Lovely brew as always.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,maddogruss,3.85,"Good stout. Poured can into a glass mug. Let settle. Beautiful dark and tan color with a off-white head. You can smell the hops as soon as it's poured. Can taste a pleasantly slight bitter taste with a strong roasted barley aftertaste. Very smooth and thick mouthfeel. Very drinkable, but one should do you good for a little while due to its thickness.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,simmons,3.68,"Apperance- A dark brew with a thin creamy tanish head that didnt last too long which is weird cause every time I've drank this beer the head would be there till the last drop.  Smell- No hops at all, not much roasted aroma, mildly malty with a sour note to it from the sour mash.  Taste- This beers taste is just like the aroma, no hops, not much malt at all, mildly roasted with the sourness prodominent. Very basic not much life it this beer at all.  Mouthfeel- This beer is very watery but at 4.2% you really cant complain. It is also not that carbonated but does have that widget gismo filled with nitrogin to help make the body creamy.  Drinkability- Overall this is an ok beer. It isnt the best beer in the world but it will do just nicely at the beer full of swill. For the price that people pay for Guinness you would be better off buying Murphys Stout or any other craft stout with more character.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,mnesporov,4.15,"Love it or hate it Guinness has established them selves in a notch that they will never be removed from. It might be the fact that the look of the beers just makes you want to scream for happiness who knows? One thing for sure is that Guinness is one of my favorite beers, and is one of the only stouts you can buy at the gas station at 2 in the morning when all the other places have closed down for the night.  A: few beers look better than a 'draft' pint of Guinness. Truly a sight to behold, legendary head retention  S: Roasted grain, perhaps a touch of coffee. Average in aroma.  T: Roasted grain flavor with the smallest bit of sourness that is equalized by the bitterness.  M: Medium bodied, with a creamy mouthfeel.  D: Extremely drinkable, I dont think I could watch a football game with out one.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

One of my favorites before I really knew anything about beer. But now I realize that there is very little complexity to this brew and it is not quite as stout as a stout should be. The taste is very malty with an obvious chocolaty finish. Very smooth and highly drinkable, but leaving something to be desired if you want a really good stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The mouthfeel was thin and watery.  The drinkability was average or maybe a bit better but I did not get a second. MK",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,neenerzig,3.68,"This beer is a very dark brown/black color. Has a creamy looking white head about 2 fingers thick when drawn from the tap that is about one finger thick upon settling. Good head retention in part due to the pasteurization of this beer no doubt. Pretty decent lacing too. Aroma wise there are some smells of roasy malt,coffee, maybe some hints of chocolate, and perhaps milk. A milk smell in beer? Not something I have ever experienced before in a beer. Again, due in part to the pasteurization no doubt. Has a sort of malty, bitter, coffee and lactic like taste. Has sort of a dry and bitter aftertaste. Guinness is definetly one of the more bitter stouts out there. Has a creamy and smooth mouthfeel with fairly minimal carbonation. Despite the mouthfeel the body is obvously medium at best and this fact can't easily be hidden. The body is one of the most thin of any stout I have ever had and nothing can be done to hide this fact. Except for the bitterness factor Guinness is a good beginners stout, but can hardly be considered to be a stout to one who has much experience drinking stouts, but still enjoyable from time to time. Easy to drink in a good way.  Eric",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BBM,3.59,"The classic Guinness pours a deep opaque black with a rich, creamy tan head. There's obviously great retention and lacing, and that ""cascading"" effect never gets old. There is an aroma of roasted malt and milk. Not too pungent.  Guinness is a creamy, thick beer with a roasty flavor and a bite of bitterness towards the end. It's not as sweet as some other stouts you'll find, but it is highly drinkable. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, with not much carbonation, which is a good thing.  If you want an intro to stouts this is the classic brew. It's easy to drink, looks pretty and is available just about anywhere. I look forward to trying this in Ireland one day, where I hear the taste is much different. Until then, this is a nice sessionable alternative. Brilliant!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Damian,3.42,"Drank on-tap at Great Scott, Allston, MA  Poured a thick, pitch black with a three-finger blanket of mocha-colored foam. As the beer sat, throngs of brown bubbles cascaded down from the unwavering head. This was truly a sight to see, one that is unique to this beer alone. Sheets of lacing coated the glass, which later turned into spider webs of lacing.  Not much as far as smell was concerned. Some powdered cocoa and possibly milk.  The taste however, was rich, complex and unlike any other beer. Sour, lactate-like creaminess noticeable on the front end with deep, roasted malts and intense, bitter hops appearing mid-palate. An espresso-like bitterness became apparent on the back end. Quite dry. Some bakers chocolate noticeable as well. The lingering, coffee-like bitterness in the aftertaste seemed to last an eternity. Before it faded, some bitter hops and mocha notes were picked up as well.  Creamy, almost soupy mouthfeel.  Even more impressive than the consistency of the liquid was simply touching my lips to the frothy goodness.  This is definitely a sipping beer. A classic in every sense.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,hckyfn9999,3.56,"Pours a very nice black color with some ruby hues and a thick white head. I love to watch this beer settle.  Smell is a little smokey and a litte roasted. Taste is mostly roasted bitterness, not a very strong taste. Mouthfeel is creamy but i prefer more carbonation in a beer. While its not my first choice of stouts, its a readily available and a nicely drinkable session beer. As my glass says its a lovely day for a guinness.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Drinkablility: I can sip this from the tap all day, but i won't be buying any more of these bottles anytime soon.  i guess you aren't supposed to pour this out of the bottle, but i love that thick pour.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,dedrinker,3.85,"I guess they put the widget in a bottle for those who fear canned beer. Nothing different here, just smooth velvety light bitter choclate and burnt coffee with that classic tang from the little proportion of soured beer. Very drinkable, and lacking in character with every successive time I buy one (only once every few months - just as a benchmark stout refresher course). Just because there are so many more flavorful versions out there is no reason to disparage this old standby. We all remember a time when we looked up to this beer in awe and admiration.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Envious,2.2,Pours neatly into a chilled pint glass. The brown foam eventually settles out to a dark ruby red as seen through the glass when held upto a light. Smells of sour dough and faint spice. Head is creamy and thick like yeast foam when making bread. Unpleasantly sour tasting makes this beer not easily drank. Not smooth my taste buds became overwhelmed with the sourness and bitterness through out. Not a beer I would buy again.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,drotski,3.91,"A classic.  I disregarded where the bottle said to drink straight from the bottle. It poured nearly black, with a light tan frothy head. Excellent retention and lacing. Beautiful, why would anyone drink this from the bottle or can?  Light, soothing aromas of roasted barley and toasted malt.  Tasted great, dark and roasty, yet light and fluffy at the same time. Had the expected slight sourness that I always love. Very smooth.  Felt nice in the mouth. Lightly carbonated which balanced out the smoothness. Not too thick or thin.  Very drinkable. Goes great with vanilla ice cream, or even Stout Floats. I love this one.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Thick, sticky lacing on the glass. Nothing looks better than a wll poured Guinness.  Light roasted malt aroma with a touch of caramel. Very light aroma overall.  Roasted malt flavor upfront with a light bitterness midway through. Finishes dry with light notes of coffee and caramel.  Body is rather thin, regardless of the super creamy head.  I can drink these like there's no tomorrow, a great session beer. This is the standard for Irish Stouts, the grand-pappy of them all.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,SupaCelt,4.01,"There are few beers that are more appealing to the eye than draught Guinness. The pour, albeit form a can in my case now, produces a pint of ale that is alive with gaseous activity. To see the fierce bubbling and settling occur before your eyes is always a special moment. The darkness starts to fill in from the bottom of the glass on up to the top where a succulent creamy head develops. The head is substantially thick and it seems to hold its form when a finger is dipped into it. This thing looks kingly.  The nose is a bit weak. From my paltry experience log with nitrogen propelled beverages this seems to folllow suit. It has a definite airy quality that carries a faint smell of cream and mild coffee and bland chocolate aroma. Overall quite subdued, yet blatantly appetizing at the same time.  The taste is again far less than imposing. I take weak coffee in as the main flavour. It holds a slight bitterness that seems to add to the coffee impression. All the while, a creaminess supplements the dark tastes. It is utterly quaffable. There is nothing I can find wrong with the picture. Just enough hearty flavour and the proper amount of watery content to cut through anything brash.  Mouthfeel seems to border on a medium heftiness. The brew is quite fluffed and creamy feeling which almost makes it seem light. If the flavour was not as hearty as it is, it would surely be construed as a light brew. There exists a fair amount of roasted malt richness to create an illusion of weight.  The drinkability factor is through the roof in my estimation. You have all of the more appealing components of beer that make it grand. A dark and substantial flavour with a well titrated richness that never overwhelms coupled with a mouthfeel that is deceiving and vacillates betwixt thickness and light qualities. This beer just provokes me to sip it incessantly. With the somewhat slight abv, one can enjoy copious amounts of this and never become burdened by the effects. This is truly worthy of my praise. Well crafted. Easy to consume. Just plain enjoyable. I regret that I paid this beer no heed for such a long while as now it is a regular denizen of my cooling chamber. Live and learn.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Freshie,2.77,"One of the beers I have had most in my life, yet never got around to reviewing it.  Had on Nitro-tap at the Halfway Cafe in Holbrook.  Dark as crud, with a thick creamy head. Cascading effect is as always a sight to behold.  The smell is faint, because of frigid serving temperature, but yields a nice bitter coffee-type aroma.  The taste is surprisingly light when you consider the colour. Bitter hops, and rich malty chocolate flavour. The mouth feel is clean, but a bit watery. Finishes dry.  I am not sure if I have ever had the Foreign Stout or Extra Draught, but I look forward to their example, because this one just does not do it for me, compared to all the much more flavourful and stronger American Stouts. Give me a Murphy's any day of the week, over this.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Absumaster,4.01,"This was my first nitro-bottle and I was amazed at how well this works. The head is climbing and it takes minutes before the head is formed. And then the head is just excellent, stable and compact. Color was black and the total appearance was a 5!  Smell of roasted barley, burned with some sweet/sour things going on. There is also something of a Marmite or Worchester sauce in it and defenitely some earthiness.  Taste of roasted barley, Marmite, soy sauce and the earthiness again, this could be the hops? Wonderfull stuff, but I remind myself that from draft this beer pours much thicker. Now it tastes a bit watered down. The mouthfeel is smooth and has a very pleasant texture. Drinkability is very good, especially with 4,2% alcohol in it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,monkeybutler,3.69,"Draught can actually says ""serve extra cold"" on the side, for no good reason that I can discern. This beer should be very close to room temperature if you ask me.  Pours a cascading mocha which settles to a dark brown topped with a creamy white nitro-head that lasts the whole glass. Excellent lacing.  Smell is slightly roasty, but is dominated by the gassy, almost chemical odor from the head. It might look good, but I'm of the opinion that nitrogen has more cons than pros.  Flavor is easy to dissect. It's roasted barley bitterness up front with a subdued malt backbone. No hop character can be delved out from all of the barley bitterness.  Mouthfeel seems watery at first, but then the creaminess of the nitrogen seeps in. Some people famously suggest that this beer is ""so thick!"" but I think that they are really just thrown by the monster head. The body is actually quite thin.  It's a session ale, so of course this beer is drinkable, moreso if you ""serve extra cold"", which quite often is the case. What's that about?",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It is a beer that you sit around with friends and tip back a fewor more. As for would I have another, yes I would and am doing so now.  I must admit, that when I began beer drinking I could not stomach a Guinness even for money. However, now it is perhaps my favorite beer. I am in preparation for my Oktoberfest party and decided to try out the 1985 Munich Oktoberfest stein I have just bought. The decision was made to christen it with two nitro bottles of Guinness. I find that as I age I appreciate Guinness for its robust flavors and its smooth nature.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,KevinB,4.78,"This is the one, the one we all use to set our compass when judging other stouts. It's the barometer, the reference point. There was a time it couldnt be found state side as crazy as that sounds. As a child I remember adults calling it muddy or the meal in the can. The interesting thing about Guinness is you know when you have gotten a really nice one, for it's heaven on earth, you also know when you are on the receiving end of a lower tier one. I guess it's like the pizza saying even when it's bad it's good, ehh well almost. Contrary to what people say don't have to travel to Dublin to get a nice one, just a good bar that cares about its patrons. For the review I poured the Guinness from a Nitro can into a pint glass. The appearance was ebony, ruby black with a thick foamy tan head. It's smells and tastes of coffee, roasted barley, and hops. It's bitter, dry, watery and very drinkable. The nitro can does a very decent job of imitating a tap. Overall you can never go wrong with a nice pint of Guinness, find a nice pub or a fresh nitro can/bottle, preferably a solid pub. I also recommend Beamish and Murphys from the Irish Stout holy Trinity, I like all three for varying reasons.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,penut,4.46,"A - This really depends on the pour but if done correctly this beer looks great in the Guinness tulip glasses. The contrast of the creamy head and dark beer color really look great.  S - Roasted coffee smells  T - An easy drinking, low carbonated, smooth coffee flavor.  MF - A bit bitter and dry afterwards with slight aftertastes of coffee and alcohol.  D - This is the beer that's gotten me to prefer getting new brews over new whiskeys. I consider this my ""goto"" beer when session drinking occurs. WIth its low alcohol content and low carbonation they're easy to drink but oddly filling. Hence the ""it's like a meal in a can!"" saying.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,ridedammit,2.7,"The beer itself is not horrible (its not great either) I guess i just don't like the draught beer in a can concept. I realize the company wants to be able to market to a large audience, but to realy enojy a draught, go to a pub, order it, wait a few minutes for it to be poured correctly, then enjoy. No its not the best beer in the world, it just has a feeling to it. It needs to be enojoyed in a pub, preferably in an Irish Pub, and even better in a pub in or around Dublin.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Smoky, creamy, roasty --- I need oysters quickly --- lightly sweet aftertaste, lingering roasted flavours, and also some late grain notes. Medium bitterness at the back. Again, a hint of sourness. Silky texture, light carbonation, and full bodied flavour all the way back.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The appearance is black/very dark brown with zero transparency and a tan head that is light and creamy. The smell is complex with hints of toffee and raisins to suggest a couple. The taste is light, smooth, and smoky but a bit watered-down. The mouthfeel is also very watery, not as creamy or stimulating as I would have hoped for, yet the lightness does make this easy to drink.

Its like Candyland for beer...  This is the rating for the Pub version that would be ""on-tap"" at the bar. More bitter, filling, and fuller body. NO chalk / sour aftertaste.

209,754,Rudgers73,3.73,"This is one of my favorite stouts to have for session drinking.  When I first saw a guinness poured from the tap I noticed that there is a very specific way in which to serve this dark stout. If you want a guinness served properly, you must be patient. It begins with filling the pint glass about 2/3 - 3/4 the way up and then it is set to the side to settle. After it settles the tap is held at about 1/2 tilt and filled the rest of the way--traditionally the tap is swirled around at the very end to form a clover leaf in the thick nitro head. When the glass is set in front of you, you will notice a strange precipitating-like effect. The head sticks around longer than any head you will ever see and leaves a sticky foam in the empty glass.  The mouthfeel is bold and robust. Almost like black coffee there are hints of alcohol and bitterness. After a while it is a little watery, but for a stout it's good to have one mild-mannered so you can drink a lot of it.  Overrated. but respectable.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,willc11,3.26,"Pours a dark black into my Sweetwater pint glass. Nice cascading bubbles that settle rather quickly, leaving a modest head, about less than one finger, that looks similar to that of milk poured too fast. Moderate lacing where the Guinness was sipped.  Nothing too remarkable in the nose, mostly roasted barley and a hint of coffee and alcohol.  Again, nothing too exceptional about the taste--mostly roasted barley, hop presence is difficult to detect. This bottled version is rather watery compared to that I've had on tap. Extremely low carbonation with a mouthfeel that, again, easily compares to a glass of milk (though this is also just one aspect of the style). Finishes with a hint of sweetness. Despite the low ABV, I seem to be tasting more alcohol than I should as the beer warms a little.  Nonetheless, this is a very drinkable beer; one should stick with the Extra Stout variety when looking for a Guinness (Stateside, anyway) with real flavor.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,indysamra,4.04,"Pours with a creamy tan color with cascading waves of brown liquid forming under a thick tan head. After about 20 seconds the motion stops and the rich roasted aromas spring forth. The flavor yields a similar dry, roasted barley character, with the roasted aspect becoming more pronounced as the brew warms toward ambient temperature. Simply one the best ever brewed.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,GCBrewingCo,3.68,"The beer poured into the glass clear brownish black beneath the cascading tan foam from the nitro bottle. The head was tight and tan and everlasting.  The aroma was chocolate and caramel with a very slight roast/smoke and a present but hidden tart character. The aroma was not sweet but did contain a sizeable amount of caramel.  The flavor was chocolate and coffee and a light bit of caramel, but the beer started on the palate bone dry. The caramel flavor seemed to increase as the cascading foam from the nitro pour died back. The flavor also contained a light bit of acrid sourness.  The finish was dry, bone dry, with lasting coffee and light roast into the aftertaste. The body was medium light with a creamy character due to the head and nitro. Same Guinness that you find on draft which is quite an achievement.  11.2 ounce bottle with shrink wrapped label.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Deconstructionis,3.56,"The old days of fresh Guinness on tap are apparently history in this country. It seems anymore that you are just as likely to get a stale resiny pint as a fresh one (which is a treat). Sadly, the nitro can is now a better bet-- at least it's consistent.  The cascading head is always very pretty. Both the smell and taste are middle of the road for stouts. Clearly, the brewers have positioned this one for the mass market but that doesn't mean it's not a good beer just one that won't overwhelm those used to macrobrews and might underwhelm those who have sampled the better craft stouts.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BeerSox,2.75,"Taken straight from the 12oz. bottle. However, a small amount was poured into a large shot glass to observe the appearance and record the aromas.  Pours opaque black with a very thin tan colored frothy head. Very little retention, although it is sticky.  Sour aromas are present, almost soy like. Other aromas are a bitter roasty smell.  Almost no sweetness like other stouts. Slight roastyness, along with some bitterness. Overall flavor is bland.  Watery mouthfeel, not as full as a stout should be.  A decent beer. Pales in comparison to their extra stout, as well as other stouts in general. Probably better in a glass out of a nitro can, definitely better on tap. I still use Guinness Draught as a way to start out the night in a bar if I'm not sure what I want or I just want to have something when I'm with people. This is still a good beer for the summer when you want something relatively strong with a roasty flavor instead of something hoppy (or bland). Also seems a little overpriced at ~$7-$8 per six pack for what you get. One thing is for sure though: The beer tastes much better than the widget.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,rayjay,3.94,"Great foamy head that retained itself even after the beer was gone. Laced the whole glass. Great cascade of bubbles from the nitro canister.  Careful on that pour; 14.9 oz don't fit into that typical 12 oz pint glass that's become so common!  Much lighter body than the bottle of Extra Stout I just had; also a little more tart which was what I was looking for. Roasted malts and hard water. The whole time I kept thinking liquid pretzel. Nice roasted bitter aftertaste. I've always loved how this beer comes across as dark and strong, yet it still manages to be light and refreshing.  Surely pasteurization has taken away from the flavor, a disadvantage of the can.  Mouthfeel is where it really shines. Smooth like silk. Creamy.  Extremely drinkable. Goes down like water. I actually found it more drinkable the warmer it got.  A very close match to the draft, and very different from the extra stout. They are all good in their own way. This one is videly available, making it a solid backup option for the fancier stuff I usually go for. Great to come back to if you've forgotten how good it is.

209,754,WVbeergeek,3.68,"Appearance: Dark ruby brown body that cascades into a velvety black tone and forms a lucious textured biscuit tan head which rises above the rim of my glass, very nice. Aroma: Has dark roasted malts which give off the tone of dark roasted coffee roasts, dark cocolate, and creamy slightly acidic notes along with an herbal hop character. Taste somewhat metallic with more soured acidic chocolate milk with old coffee melded in, a very signature Guinness taste to it light hopping is evident with the herbal hop flavor. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth and lighter bodied with a definite smooth factor going on. Drinkability...this is a definite keystone of transitioning into better beer I can drink this in number although since discovering stout I've found many brews in that style that I crave over Guinness Draught.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,Lancer211,3.44,"Poured from an 11.2oz nitro bottle into a stein.  A - Nitro/CO2 head forms immediately, slightly off-white, very fine carbonation. Beer itself is opaque black, a most inviting proposition. Lacing is excellent. Pour created beautiful tan waves of head flowing upward from bottom of stein.  S - Roasty malted scent, a bit chocolatey, not too much there actually.  T - Not as good as Extra Stout, Foreign Extra Stout, or on tap version. Malty, a bit chocolatey, but even when warmed up a bit, not much in the way of character. A bit of acidity in the middle, and a quick hit of bitterness and a slightly drying finish. (even at 4.2%) I feel like Guinness Draught is kind of the ""lite beer"" of stouts... but since it's a stout, that still puts it above about 75% of the brews out there.  M - Nitro-smooth, thinner and more watery than expected though. Went down easily enough tho, with a hint of a bitter lingering aftertaste, not altogether unpleasant.  D - Sessionable, not as good as on tap, however. The lightness of body and taste means I could drink more of these, but there are better beers out there. I do feel like this could be a good stepping stone towards moving mainstream beer drinkers away from BMC crap and towards darker and better brews.  I remember when I thought Guinness was the finest beer in production.... as my Guinness poster that dates from my college days attests. I know better now. Still a damn decent brew, and when I feel like having something a little lighter, I'll still have one of these.

Appearance: The beer is very dark. Can be anywhere from a dark red to a pure black. Head should be light tan to white. If the bartender is good, a shamrock will be in the head.  Smell: It is immediately evident that this is not a skunk beer. The Irish have been making this beer exceptionally well since 1759.  Taste: This beer is thick, but surprisingly light for a stout which is why it floats on top in a black and tan or half and half. The initial taste is that of the roasted barley and hops as well as the light thickness that is traditional with Guinness. This fades into surprisingly little after taste for a stout.  Mouthfeel: A mouthfull of Guinness is like a massage for the mouth, it is a thick beer, but surprisingly smooth at the same time.  Drinkability: Not a party beer! This is a beer that is to be enjoyed in a relaxed setting. This is not a beer to chug, it is a beer to sit back, drink slowly, and enjoy. This is a break from the world to relax and enjoy.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Beer pours a dark black-ish color, but has none of the great ""surging"" look that it is supposed to have. A real disappointment to start out with. The smell is very minimal, but it's really watered down compared to what a Guinness is supposed to smell like. Tastes a bit like a Guinness, but again, the flavor is a bit watered down and it has none of the thick, heavy, creamy flavor and feel of the original. As a beer it's drinkable, but not as a Guinness.

209,754,TheLiterati,1.53,"Decades ago, my very first big beer after being weaned from Miller and Bud was a Guinness Extra Stout. My father had visited Ireland and brought home a bottle or two straight from the source and it was simply amazing. Even then, I knew Id never go back to the yellow stuff again.  That was more than three decades ago. Since then, my palate has matured and my beer tastes have grown more complex. Even so, I was surprised to feel so disappointed on my recent reunion with my one-time favorite.  Since Id bought a six of the new and improved nitro bottles, I had two tastings  the first in a glass so I could judge the color, etc., and a second one so I could savor it as it was designed to be had  straight from the bottle. I knew this would be different from the ""extra"" that I'd enjoyed so long ago, but I never expected to be so, well, bummed over the absolute blandness of this beer.  Served in a glass, I could appreciate the dark brown color and creamy head. Frankly, there was absolutely nothing noteworthy about the smell. The words smoky and creamy come to mind, but that would suggest that there was something substantial about it, and sad to say, that just wasnt the case.  And even sadder, that lack of substance translated to the flavor as well. Theres a very mild, malty sweetness there, and again hints of smokiness  all from the roasted barley of course  but thats really it.  The mouthfeel is flat; and the finish was more chalky than dry.  As for the second sampling, which was had straight from the bottle as suggested, well, lets just say while I know Guinness is something of a classic, based on this sampling, its really more hype than substance.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,danielocean03,3.33,"This is a beer I've had numerous times from the bottle, I have drank directly from the bottle as directed and wasn't nearly as satisfied as pouring into a pint glass and enjoying much more.  Vigorous and slightly rougher pour into a pint glass to intensify the effervescent waterfall effect, appearance is an opaque ruby edged black with a full finger of light beige head that exhibits decent head retention. Aroma is light, mainly made up of roasty grain and sweet malts, very simple and pleasing to the nose. Taste is also light, just as it smells with some creaminess and bitter unsweetened cocoa and espresso notes. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate levels of carbonation, most likely an effect of the nitro widget's delivery. Goes down quickly and easy, washes off the tongue effortlessly given the light body. Remarkably refreshing, very enjoyable brew. Drinkability is good, easy to drink and appreciate, low abv.

The head is is a wonderfull khaki, smooth and creamy.  S: Sour milk, acidic cola, roasted coffee and fresh butter.  T: A very original beer here. The first impression is sour milk without the serious pungentness of it. From there mild roasted grainess come to the surface. This transitions to a milky essence with a subtle lactose sweetness. Overall coffee and slight burnt chocolate flavor, especially in the finish.  M: Much thinner than one would think, with superb carbonation.  D: The world famous Guinness.

209,754,acrawf6,3.14,"I think most of us has had this in the three ways it's sold. I'd say i would rather on tap, but this review is from the nitro can.  Pours out a black with just some small light on the side giving it a ruby red, but just a little. Nice nitro head that is tan. I do have to say nitro stouts look very nice, especially with the nice cascading it produces. I think anyone who gives this a 1 on appearance when they pour is being way too partial, this shit looks good.  Smell. Quite neutral. a small faint aroma of roasted malts and a little sweetness. Not bad, but nothing rememberable.  Taste. Not bad, but this, of course, is affected with the nitro. I consider the nitro affecting the mouthfeel the most, but it gives the flavor an alter taste. It's not really roasted flavored but is slightly sweet. Again, kinda neutral.  Mouthfeel is the thing i like least about these nitro beers. just too light, and gives these stouts an empty mouthfeel, imho.  Overall its decent. It's that one all those bmc drinkers ask if you like, gauging it and your taste buds on the color because they see it as a ""meal in a can."" Horse shit.

Mouthfeel is up my alley, smooth and refreshing, people who feel that guinness is soupy and thick rather confuse me. I think I could drink these all night long, in a party situation, the ABV seems lower than the already low suggested 4.2, then again, I've been into Storm King, of late.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,MusicmanSD,3.8,"I always like to throw back a Guinness Draught when I'm already pretty hammered. Won't get you belligerent because the ABV is a bit lower and goes down easily because of the watery complexion. The appearance is always the high part of this beer. In its trademark glass, its a classic look and is hard to beat with the creamy brown head! The smell is of roasted malt (of course...) and a bit cocoa-ish. Taste is very different; especially if youre just getting into stouts (my buddies still consider this undrinkabily bitter for some reason). Tastes like chocolate mixed with coffee. Mouthfeel is always the downfall of a mass produced stout. Watery and feels flat. Which is EXACTLY why I like to drink it after a few heavier beers, cuts the bloating down a bit. Drinkability is just outstanding and I'd session with this any day if everyone else brings the regular BMC products to a get together, plus! It stirs some conversations!

The beer pours a smooth dark brown with definite layers that separate into an opal color with a creamy head. A rich smoky smell. A crisp taste with a chocolaty after taste. The beer has a smooth creamy feel and that doesnt linger too long in your mouth. This is a beer I could drink all day and not get over powered by its flavor.

Pours a ruby-tinted black with the usual nitro characteristics: a typically large head and long settling time, and that lovely guinness lacing at each level of drinking. Aroma is lightly roasted malt. Light roast flavor, low bitterness, no noticible yeast character or hop flavor, but it's so familiar a flavor, like an old friend. Big chewy mouthfeel, very smooth.  Really, among the beers available to us today, Guinness wouldn't stand out in a blind taste test, but it's still a classic, and light enough to drink all night without many ill-effects.

A hint of chocolate and a very tiny amount of a burnt flavor. This beer has no bite and I find it is one of the only stouts does not get better as it warms up. The flavor stays consistant but the creamy texture really is lackluster under warmer temperatures. The beer is full bodied but with less flavor than you would think.

Yes, it pours black with typical nitro, foamy head. But the taste is so thin, so metalic with utterly no toasted, coffee or carmel notes that I wondered if I was in fact drinking a Guinnes. Miller Genuine Draft has as much character. This beer is all gimmick, and no heart. I gave the remainer of the 4 pack to a neighbour. If I ever drink Guinnes again, it will be from a bottle.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,tneel,4.16,"The beer that made me realize there is good beer out there. This will always have a spot with me because it was the first beer that opened my eyes to the world of great beer. Guinness will always be one of my favorite beers.  The appearance is what first sells it- the turn to black is always a cool thing to watch. It has a mild coffee smell and taste to it and the roasted malts are apparent throughout the stout. There is also a thick, creamy head and a surpisingly smooth taste. I thought that this would be a thicker beer than it turned out to be.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

T - The taste is watery and not all that impressive. The roasted flavor does come through.  M - Very little carbonation, medium bodied  D - This beer is drinkable only because it is so dumbed down for mass consumption, in my opinion. Not one of the better dry Irish stouts out there.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,bluejacket74,4.09,"Ah, Guinness. Served in a pint glass, it pours dark brown with some tinges of ruby red in there when I hold it up to the light. The head is about 3/4 inches high, creamy and tan. The aroma isn't strong, but it smells like roasted malt with a bit of coffee. It tastes pretty much the way it smells, like roasted malt, coffee and some chocolate. There's a nice slight bitter aftertaste as well. It's very creamy and smooth, and goes down pretty easy. In my opinion it's a great beer, especially because of the way it looks (the taste is good too). I don't think I've ever had a bad Guinness, of course it's always better on tap somewhere. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,rtratzlaff,3.4,"This beer obviously has it's positives and negatives. What it lacks in taste it makes up for in a really cool look and drinkability. Had this on tap at a bar. I saw the bartender pour it and he poured it straight down the glass creating a ton of head that slowly but surely turned to a pitch black beer in front of me. I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to be poured. I usually see bartenders taking their time with pouring a guiness, but this one just set the glass down pulled the tap, walked away and did something else. Either way, my beer arrived and was exactly as every pint of guinness I've had before. An awesome 1/2"" white head sits atop a black body for the entire time you drink. Not much of anything in the nose and only a bit of roasted malt flavor in the taste. If I focus and let my imagination go wild, I can maybe fool myself into tasting some chocolate notes. The mouthfeel is creamy smooth, but watery in a weird way. This beer is a session beer if there ever was one.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,hunteraw,3.38,"Appearance: Poured out of a nitro bottle, it's opaque black, and thanks to the widget forms the familiar two-layered head. Doesn't leave lace so much as a tan film on the glass.  Smell: All I'm picking up is roast, but to be fair I've got a stuffy nose so it's likely I'm missing something.  Taste: roast, grain-bitterness, a little touch of chocolate and coffee, and a finish that's almost too-sweet (more like a sweet/milk stout), but the aftertaste is pleasant. Not as flavorful as the extra stout, to be sure.  Mouthfeel: Unfortunately, the creaminess of that nitro-layer of head dissipates all too quickly, and the rest of the glass doesn't have that same creaminess. I definitely have a soft spot for nitrogen-charged beers, though.  Drinkability: I've had something of an ongoing debate as to whether I prefer the draught or the extra stout, and the conclusion I think I've come ot is that the Extra Stout is a better beer, but I wish it had some nitro. I suppose the moral of the story is ""just get it on tap.""The sweet finish does hurt the drinkability a bit, though.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,pibbxtrasucks,3.61,"Had this (most recently) at Buffalo Wild Wings. The beer of course looks fantastic. Guinness has a very unique (as far as I'm concerned) look. Being Pitch black with a THICK, CREAMY head that lasts forever, it is one of the most daunting (readily available) beers for people to try. Its very cool to watch the beer settle, I never take a sip, and usually don't take my eyes off of the glass till its done. It Smells bitter, can't really pick out any particulars. It tastes good. To me its a very subtly flavour. tasted a little smokey, a little bitter. My girlfriend said it tasted like Bacon... but I have no idea what she was talking about. the mouthfeel again, is very unique to me. has a flat, but still carbonated feel. I like it. its a nice change of pace from your typical beer. Its a slow drink and I can normally only take 2 or 3 before I switch to something else.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BamaWorKs,4.47,"One of my favorite beers, the classic Guinness is overall a wonderful beverage. The hints of Coffee are one of the flavors I like the most about this beverage, not to mention its opaque color and traditional white head, this beer is definitely in the upper eschelon (in my own opinion, anyway!). As far as price goes, it can get a little pricey, but you pay for what you get all too often when it comes to beer, and I'm not hurting to pay a couple of extra dollars for personal enjoyment, though I wouldn't recommend drinking too many in a sitting if you're trying to keep away a beer gut :).",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Frothy brown head that has incredible retention. The smell is average for a stout, sweet coffee and creme, with some roasted and chocolate hints. The taste and mouthfeel are very much like an iced latte or something of the sort, quite sweet and filling, but not much malty goodness in most good stouts. For how deep this beer is, it has a very light body. This is a beer to make 'average beer' drinkers feel like 'good beer' drinkers. It is not impressive after you have tried some good stouts.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,edskirk3,2.72,"I was at my local taproom, drinking Yuengling Traditional Lager, when the bartender informed that I had kicked the keg (this seems to happen every now and then, they never have another one??). She asked what else I wanted, and after scanning the selection (Milwaukee's Best, Pabst Blue Ribbon, Icehouse, etc.), I decided to go for a pint of Guinness Draught. Haven't had one in a while.  It was presented to me with the signature creamy head produced by nitro-tap, though not as opaque as I remember it. Hmmm. Not much of an aroma either (besides cigarette smoke, but that's from several outside sources around me), maybe some weak roasted malt.  As I'm drinking it, I can't help notice how watered-down it seems. I can't tell you whether they've changed it or whether I'm just ruined from drinking a lot of other really good stouts recently. The three pints that I had this night were really toned down on the roasted flavor. There was still the familiar 'tang' at the end.  I do remember my first Guinness, how ""rough"" it was for me. Flavor was too strong, or I wasn't used to drinking a non-yellow beer, etc. This time it was a little too easy to throw back. Weak aroma, weak flavor, almost no carbonation. A stout for the masses.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,delmet,1.92,"It pours in style; unfortunately, it is down hill from there. The head is not too impressive, as it obviously should have been if this had anything to do with the real thing. It has good color: somewhere between very dark red and black. It smells like stale woodchips soaked in beer. And, as smell and taste are close cousins, one expects what to get from the taste. It tastes like it smells with little body. It is amazing that a beer that looks this way could be so dead. Watery, with a tiny bit of bitterness. You take another sip, and another in the hope that it may come to life; mouth to mouth so to speak. Unfortunately it is dead cold. That watery feeling turns me off, so not much to be said on the mouth feel. A little better than licking a corpse perhaps. At this point, I have no doubt you can guess what I think about drinkability. Some people are necrophiliacs, but I prefer something more vigorous, that is just about any other decent beer. My wife is also of the same opinion overall.  I should add that I like the bottled non-nitro regular Guinness. It is one of those beers I have a love-hate relation with. But I always warm up to it after a few days. That beer exists on its own feet. This really wants to be something else, and fails miserably.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Appearance- It's hard to beat the floor show of this beer... a loud *tssssk* with the pull of the tab, and the creamy, brown Irish nectar fills the glass. An enigmatic pulling and stretching of microscopic bubbles go upwards and downwards, all the while building a perfectly formed creamy head that sits quietly at a half-inch cap.  Smell- Notes of bitter coffee, with a mildly floral hop presence lingering in the back. Aromas of fresh cream and chocolate syrup are apparent. Clean and inviting, it's just right for the style.  Taste- An easy, round display of mildly roasted coffee with a subtle hop bitterness that counters and balances wonderfully.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- What begins as a watery, thin entry expands ever-so-slightly and develops a creaminess that improves the texture. Although the carbonation is downplayed in favor of smoothness, I do not miss it here. This is undoubtedly one of the finest session beers of all time, for obvious reasons.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Sosh,4.03,Had this on tap at a bar last night for the first time. I loved it. Coffee was the most recognizable taste in this beer. Overall it was very creamy and smooth going down.

I can sense that this beer has a smell, but it's so weak I can't tell what it smells like. Guinness Draught was the first ""good"" beer I got into, and I had to drink a few before I started liking the taste; malty and slightly bitter. Mouthfeel of the beer itself is prety thin; my favorite thng to do with this beer is suck in some of the head when I take a sip, they feel really good together. Drinkability's good; I could drink this stuff pretty fast if I wanted to, and drinking a few would be no problem.  Guinness Draught is something I drink when I want to sit and enjoy a beer that's pretty good but won't get me too buzzed to do stuff that needs to be done.

Tastes much as it smells, dark roasted (burnt) malt with notes of coffee and oats...very bitter stuff..  Good stiff Stout body that is definitely enhanced by the nitro-charging.

209,754,TheSarge,3.79,"Guinness Draught pours an almost totally opaque, thick, and creamy stout. The CO2 stirred up from the little plastic device puts together a neat little show to watch as the thick, frothy and tan head begins to emerge. For kicks, I like to draw a happy face in my Guinness before I begin to consume it.  Guinness gives off a slight coffee aroma, with the darkly roasted malts being the main player for producing fragrance.  This tastes a little sweet at first, but gives way to the smack of bitterness produced by the burnt malt, in conjunction to the mild hop presence.  It feels thick as one would expect from a stout. There's not much carbonation left over, since most had left from the initial pouring of this brew.  I've always like Guinness quite a bit. I was surprised to see this has about as many calories as a light beer. Only about 100 per 12 ounce serving, with a moderately low alcohol content of 4.2%.

The first time I had it, I was used to watery macros, and the Guinness tasted like drinking liquified burnt nut bread. But now I'm to the point of actually enjoying it, and I'll likely like it even more as time goes by and I get more experienced with non-American macros.  The head is beautiful. Thick, soft, foamy, sticks to the glass, looks eddible. The color is a dark black, which is a little off-putting. But not bad. I love the way the creamy ""foam"" kinda appears and swirls in the black as you pour it.  I don't get the coffee smell or taste that some people have mentioned, but it does taste like toasted nuts to me. It's thick and smooth in the mouth. I've generally had it pretty cold; I haven't tried it warmed up, though. I imagine more subtle notes become more appearant the warmer it gets; I'll need to try that.

Toffee/caramel/chocolate/coffee...you name it, it is the atypical stout. I think the reason I just can't get back into it is the bitterness at the end of the Guinness that is so common. The overly roasted flavor that leaves that lingering bitter malt flavor on my tongue. Ugh! Oh how I long to love that taste again.  The mouthfeel is a clean frothy smooth pull that is reminiscent of a great cup of espresso.  It's drinkability is average for me.

209,754,asabreed,2.97,"It's funny now that I think of how I've gotten into stouts in the past few years as compared to when I first had a Guinness and, like most, thought it was extremely thick and huge. Now I realize that's pretty laughable, but I had the hankering for some Guinness a few days ago, as I do once in a blue moon, so I bought a 4 pack of cans. And I suppose I'll give one a review now.  Appearance: Because of the widget and the nitro can, there's obviously a ton of creaminess and thickness to the brew, with a head that stays at about 1"" and the lacing that's just as thick that stays down the whole glass the beer's consumed. The body seems opaque but it's more of a very very dark amber color when you shine some light on it.  Smell: Faint roastiness, faint toasted malt, and that's about it. I guess I get a bit of sourness, though not unpleasant. Still, not unbalanced or anything, just not much there at all.  Taste: Should appear thick at first, but really the body is quite watery unfortunately. Some hops and toasted malt linger on the tongue, and a bit of roastiness is there initially, but once again, that's about it.  Mouthfeel: Once again, the mouthfeel is pretty watery, which once again makes it laughable when people describe Guinness as like eating bread. For a stout it could definitely be a lot thicker and more coating.  Drinkability: I wonder if the higher alcohol version we can't get in the states is also more complex? If that's the case, then maybe we should indeed take a chance on trying to get some over here maybe. Still, though this is one of the most overrated and consumed stouts in the country, I will buy it once in a while to watch the magic happening on the glass, and have a stout that's easy to drink when I want a few and don't want to worry about sipping one or two all night.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Smell is extremely roasted, like coffee but almost stronger. This is a classic sipping brew, Lord knows chugging it is just a bad plan.  Taste is all bout the roasted malts. Black coffee presides, followed by a slight sweetness leftover from the hefty malts used in this brew. Extremely dry, thin and creamy in the mouth. Bitterness is Over the top, but not in a West Coast USA, AIPA way, but in a first cup of coffee in the morning kind of way. Still, this is a classic beer, and one can't really argue with tradition.

A - pours that great classic guinness black, with a foamy 1/2 finger thick head that is thick and creamy and spreads carbonation down the glass and rebounds back to the top  S - man, guinness aromas evoke so many pub scene memories as im sure they do in all of us, that rich smoky, nutty, hoppy, slightly woody aroma  T - the taste always surprises me, i always expect it to be thicker, its a deceptive brew. it has a bitter hop taste at first, then it gets creamy and smoky, with a nutty flavor, with a faint fruity flavor in the very back, man i love guinness  M - smooth, so smooth, well balanced and well bodied, a great gateway beer for newbs too  D - high, due to its smoothness and lower ABV, you can go through 5-7 of these before you know it",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,BigRedN,3.66,"Interesting timing, I had just cracked this leftover from St. Patty's and sat down when I see a nice article about Guinness. Very nice.  Appearance: The nitro can opens with a good pop, the beer is poured into a standard US pint glass. The beer is very dark, black, and must be poured very slowly. A frothy, tan head forms in the classical ""Guinness Way"". Head lasts until the final sip. Sheets of lace. A neer perfect looking beer IMO, especially from a can, close to a tap draw. Much beeter than the bottle draught.  Smell: Mostly a roasted malt, touch bitter. Aroma of roasted coffee and chocolate, yet the scent is somwhat faint.  Taste: A classic Guinness. Slight roasted malts. A little sweeter than I expected (although I would not call this a sweet beer by a longshot). A touch bitter on the finish brings this in balance.  Mouthfeel: Medium in body, smooth, creamy, a little rich.  Drinkability: I think I have said this in a different Guinness review, this is probably one of the easiest beers to drink in the world, yet so many people are put off and intimidated by the appearance. While I enjoy this better on tap, I do like the can better than the bottle. An excellent beer, well worth a try or two, or three or... Update: 3-17-08 Part of a St. Pat's Irish Stout-a-thon. This beer is the most commercial of the ones I had side by side, and it was the lesser of the four beers IMO.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,cproioi,3.96,"A: one of my favorite things about a Guinness Draught is the way it looks after the two part pour. With the surging inside the glass and it seperating to make the creamy white head contrasted by the dark amber color. Leaves very thick and uniform lacing.  S: Smells like coffee with the sweet roasted malt giving off an aroma that reminds me of chocolate.  T: While the taste of the Draught is good I would prefer it to be a little more intense like their extra stout however, I do not want to take away that still this is a damn fine beer.  M: Probably one of the lighter Stouts out there.  D: I find it very easy two drink a couple of these in one sitting.

209,754,cro250klr,2.45,"My first Guinness was actually on draft, and I was really ready for a beer. Bad choice at the time, that Guiness. I had to wait for the head to settle and I though it was really bitter. Time passed and I got away from the BMC thing. I felt that my tastebuds had matured so I tried another Guinness, this tme in a bottle. Kind of chocolaty, coffee like and soft on the palate. After a little research, I now understood the workings of the 'widget', what makes the head, and why it's so thick. Armed with all of that intelligence I still wasn't that impressed, especially with the taste. Something is missing. The taste is kind of bland. Maybe it's the soft mouthfeel of the nitrogen as opposed to the crispness of CO2. I'm thinking the shortcoming is more on the line of ingredients. I've had some killer Russian stouts. Hercules out of Belgium is outstanding. Bell's, from Kalamazoo, Mi., offers a great selection of stouts that blows this one away. Mix Guinness with a Bass ale to make a black and tan, or a Harp for a half and half, and that's a different story. That seems to liven it up a bit. That's really to only way that I drink this anymore. Otherwise, for the money, I would pass on a straight up Guinness if other stouts were available.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

This is 11.2 ounces of pasteurized stout.  Pours into my tumbler nearly black with a creamy cappuccino color head. It does the cascade thing for a little while which looks nice. The head lasts a long time and leaves some lace.  Aroma is quite nice: coffee and roasted malts. Very soft and creamy smell.  Taste is shockingly bland. This honestly tastes like slightly flavored water. Thin malt flavor, slightly roasted, slightly sweet, with a slightly bitter aftertaste. I gave this beer plenty of time to warm up in hopes that some more flavor would come out, but it was in vain.  Mouthfeel is nicely smooth and creamy, but disappointingly thin. I mean really thin.  I guess I could drink several of these, but why would I want to?  I haven't had one of these is several years. I'm glad I didn't pay for this. Boy are people ridiculous when they say how ""meal-like,"" heavy and filling this beer is. I am quite convinced that people buy this due to how it is marketed, not due to how it tastes.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,SkeeterHawk,3.66,"Appearance: Pours a thick looking opaque black with rolling tan foam that cascades about the top of the beer slowly forming into a thick tan creamy head. There is some pretty thick lacing left on the glass after the beer settles a bit.  Aroma: It smells really dry with some defined roast and a slight metallic hint to it. There is a sweet caramel presence there to go with a dry biscuit like base.  Taste: The flavor is much milder than the aroma suggested. It has an almost watery edge that contradicts the dark complexion. The malt is in charge the entire time, and I don't get any hops specifically. There is a bit of a floral flavor to this beer, but I think that is an illusion from the malt complexity. The finish is a bit dry from the roast and it has an acidic note that makes it seem even more dry. There is no alcohol noticeable.  Opinion: Well, I just keep trying this beer, as I want to see what difference it makes between the different packaging techniques. I don't think that it makes much difference. This is a pretty good session beer, and I can't hardly imagine being able to drink enough to get drunk on these. I'll stick with their export.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

I guess it could be much better taken from a tap nevertheless this is all we have so here it goes straight from the bottle. A very dark colour, very thick body, one can almost chew this beer. Has a great head that remains thick on top of the beer till u finish it by scooping every last drop of foam from the bottom of the glass. Even though light in alcohol one tends to want to have one after another due to the great taste that resembles coffee, a faint touch of caramel and a predominant taste of roasted barely, this is a very bitter beer. I tried to brew my own guiness and though I did obtain a decent flavour I could not imitate the perfect head this beer posess. All those that believe that guiness is over-rated will disagree but I think this a very good beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It is pretty in the glass, although the bubbles and head recede more quickly than on tap. The major difference is the thin moutfeel. It isn't as creamy and delcicious as it is on tap.

Appearance: nice and chocolaty black. With a nice lacy head that trails the inside of the glass down to the last drop. Smell: Very malty with a hint of coffee flavor. May not be too forward out of the bottle so let it breath a little bit. Taste: robust and full bodied taste. Again malty and some roasted coffee. Mouthfeel: I feel like the bottle is always a little more watery than I would care for. It is lighter and not quite as creamy. Yet still has a comfortable body and still enjoyable. All in all I still think it really a decent beer even out of the bottle.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,ybnorml,3.5,OK. The bottle label says drink from the bottle. So for review purposes I have poured a small amount into a glass for appearance. I drank the rest from the bottle per the brewerys instruction. A dark brown black beer. Has a creamy (nitro type) dark beige head with a good lace. A lot of chocolate at first (milk chocolate) in the aroma followed by some hints of toffee and a coffee bitterness in the background. The first sip give a chocolate note. The second leaves more dark roasted malt bitterness (with a hint of burnt toast on the back of the tongue). The mouthfeel seemed a bit watery to me.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,crwills,4.18,"My second Guinness Draught review. This time the bottled version, with the widget. I've always found bottled Guinness to be a little sweeter than both the nitro can and draft version. Less dry, I guess.  Pours typical Guinness motor-oil black, with a 1/2 inch off-white head that looks like a solid object. Doesn't fade until you start drinking, and even then it sticks around for most of the glass.  Smell is dry and bready, but with, as I said, a sweeter, slightly chocolately aroma that doesn't show up when you have it on draft at a bar. Reminds me a bit more of the bottled Extra Stout (which I'll have to review sometime soon -- only one bottle left).  Taste is dry and bready. Bottled Guinness Draught is a bit more watery than other versions, which lowers the mouthfeel score for me. Still tastes great though, and the combination of taste and low ABV mean I could drink it all day. Well, maybe not ALL day.  This is the only beer so far that I've reviewed twice, simply because there are so many ways to get a Guinness around here. Can't say that for most beers in Canada.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It has a widget, and the plethora of advertising make it seem like they got this down well. Sadly, that's just not the case.  The head was the only thing remotely close to the tap pour. This was watered down, it didn't cascade in my pint glass, and the lacing was missing as well. Foamed up a bit as I swished it, but the essense, the thickness and mouthfeel that I love from this beer just wasn't there. The roasting, chocolate, and deepness that I love about this was replaced with a cheap espresso flavor, that just didn't get any better over time. I really wanted to like this, but it just wasn't there...  It's pretty odd when the head is the best part of a brew, by quite a ways. This never got off the ground, even when I tried pouring it at different temperatures. Between the ""served chilled"" suggestion (I always thought Guinness should be served around 50-55 degress fahrenheit and the edges of the beer being a deep reddish instead of a uniform black, I think they dropped the ball on this. Is it true that not all Guinness is brewed at Saint James Gate, but also in Canada? My next serving of this will be on tap - brilliant!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,alexskovan,2.3,"Looks nice. Smells nice. Tastes. . . watery.  I think Guinness really wants this stuff to have mass-market appeal, so I guess they figure watery is the way to go.

Nitro bubbles rise and fall in a hypnotizing dance that invites a sip. Head is a thick, dense, and tan. Smells like toasty malt, hops are nowhere in the nose. Once in the mouth it loses some of its luster. It has that toasty, dry malt I love, but it is just plain watery compared to other offerings. Drinkability? I can drink Guinness until I blackout. Low ABV and the watered down taste makes it slip down as easy as taking a breath.

Like the aroma a lot: roasted malt up front, with a whiskey-like, oak-barrel thing coming next, also a vibe of rum-soaked raisins.  Drank from the bottle, as instructed on the bottle itself. A flat wateriness intrudes first and foremost. Smoke and burnt malt show through most, which turns me off. It's not a flavor I can give high marks to, and with the absolutely awful flatness, I found this completely unenjoyable. I had a Guinness on tap once in Dublin and felt the same way, so I don't think it's this nitro-bottle thing. It's just not for me.  [note: drank a second bottle ""extra cold"", which is suggested on the bottle, and it helped the drinkability slightly. Still tasted awful.]",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The appearance is not as good as I'd hoped and certainly not as good as the tap version. The canned version doesn't appear as dark and thick as the tap pour. In fact, it is easier to see the deep reddish color than the opague black that you usually associate with this beer.  Smell is typically malty and British. Nice roasted aroma but also hints of metal.  Taste is exceptional. Roasted, dry malt flavors. Very smooth  Mouthfeel is where this beer excels. The mouthfeel is of thick stout but the beer is in fact very light. A weird balance to say the least. The nitro pour also adds quite a bit of body.  Drinkability is fantastic.

209,754,KFaulkner,3.51,"Top-a-the-mornin to ya!  Happy St. Patricks day, and to celebrate the occassion a Guinness draft was in order... on-tap of course. The draft came in one of those Guinness glasses that I think they had specifically for the beer since most people were drinking their green-dyed Bud Light drafts out of regular barware. Regardless, it was dark, smooth, creamy (well, not really creamy, but you know what I mean) and the head was that of a stout; thick and, well, thick.  People joke about drinking Guinness with a spoon, but I find it to be a very smooth beer. It's easy to drink, thanks mostly to its low alcohol content and goes down smooth, if not slightly bitter. It's certainly not the best stout on the market, but it's definitely the most famous. Considering it was St. Patrick's Day, I couldn't have enjoyed it more.  So, if on no other occassion, celebrating the day of the Irish is a great to sample an authentic Irish stout you can get just about anywhere; because we all know, Killian's Irish Red is not from Ireland.

Forget the bashers and various odd comments. Enjoy it if you like. Here's my short review:  Classic black color with that fun to watch carbonation cascade and the nitro head that lasts the whole drink. Taste is not going to overwhelm most anyone and it's lighter than appearances suggest.

209,754,headlessparrot,3.73,"St. Patrick's Day is nigh upon us, and I had yet to find a bartender in the Greater Toronto Area who knew the makings of a perfect pint of Guinness. So, naturally, I had to take matters into my own hands, and I purchased a 'grab and go' four-pack of Guinness nitro cans - actually brewed in Ireland, unlike the bottles and various other Guinness incarnations.  It's been a long time since my first sip of Guinness, at age fifteen (I loathed it), and every time I try it, I find myself liking it more and more. Let's see if this trend continues.  The pour, as always, is absolutely gorgeous. Not as good as a perfect pour on draught, but it takes significantly less than 118 seconds to get this baby out of the bottle and into my pint glass. The beautiful signature cascading bubbles, the black-as-night body with just hints of brown and ruby around the edges, and the beautiful, creamy looking substantial off-white head are all here. The head retains well, and leaves a spectacular amount of lacing. No problems here - this looks delicious.  The smell is also quite enjoyable. Usually my pints of Guinness are in smoke-filled pubs where it's hard to really get a handle on the stellar smell - roasted malts, creamy, cappucino, with burnt coffee and slightly chocolatey notes. Toffee, caramel, a little smoky.  Taste, however, isn't quite up to par with genuine pub draught Guinness. At the very forefront, quite sweet for only a couple of seconds (but a little metallic). Burnt flavours dominate quickly after; coffee, toffee, hints of chocolate, but all smokey, and with a bit too much burnt-ness for my personal liking. Bitter and dry on the finish, though not extremely so, and with an unusual, but not utterly unpleasant aftertaste. Would probably pare better with a food to match it then it does on its own (possibly why I recall liking it more, since I used to consume Guinness and wings by the plate). Nothing particularly impressive, but they're doing something right.  Mouthfeel is a mixed bag. The body initially feels rather thick and full-bodied as it passes the lips, but quickly reveals itself to be thin (a bit too watery) as it rolls over the tastebuds. I can see where the perception of Guinness as a 'heavy' beer comes from, but whoever believes this must have spit theirs' out before even tasting it. Carbonation, however, is top-notch - subtle, not too excessive at all. Almost, perfect even.  Drinkability is also rather high. Guinness just begs to be consumed in two or three pints at a time. Beyond the bitterness, it's smooth, rich and just complex enough to be rewarding (but not too rewarding). American macros could really take a lesson from Guinnes Draught. And while its far superior on tap (but only especially so in the 'taste' department), I would never turn it down from a can - and in fact, I'll probably eventually buy more next year, when I still haven't found a bartender's who's mastered the Guinness 'perfect pour.'",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

This review is based off a nitro bottle but I can't tell if there is much difference between this and the nitro can.  Pours a jet black with a nice head that is sort of the color on a cappacino. The head is frothy and hangs around the whole time I'm drinking this. The nose is toffee, chocolate, coffee, and roasted barley.  The mouth is incredibly smoothe but a little water. All the essences from the nose are present in the taste. The finish is medium but builds up over time. While it isn't a very strong stout I can always do a session of these.

Taste....burnt coffee and toffie dominates and finishes dry. Mouthfeel is watery and thin....other dry stouts offer a better mouthfeel than this brew does. Drinkability is rather good since this beer will not load you up like other stouts will. It will make a good session beer but I have to believe that Guinness you get from the tap or over the pond is better than this export.

The pour is amazing, the entire beer is filled with a wavy cascade of tan foam on black slowly settling to the thick head up top. The head is thick and creamy with eternal retention, the lacing is also thick and creamy. It had a dark red black color with little black impurities that look like ash.  S - Faint elderberries, toffee and very weak molasses.  T - Water with a bit of charred white bread mixed into it. There is a burnt lightly coffee flavored bitterness. The flavor is weak and lacking in depth.  M - Very thin, very watery, very smooth and refreshing.  D - Highly drinkable. The beer is easy to session, although the charred flavor gets old quickly. It is easy to wash down food as well. All and all, a bland irish dry with a bit too much burnt character for my tastes.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Orrshow,2.82,Appearance - Pours black with a centimeter of light tan head which appears creamy. When poured from the nitro can there is an interesting effect as the bubbles move all about the glass and eventually settle to the top. This one leaves lacing all over the glass.  Smell - Not strong at all. Roasted malts present there. Somewhat sweet. This was very difficult to decipher.  Taste - A weak smoky flavor touches the tongue with very slight hints of chocolate. Ends bitter...but not that bitter. This beer lacks flavor and tastes almost watery.  Mouthfeel - Creamy for sure but at the same time somewhat watery. The carbonation is very low Needs a lot more body.  Drinkability - I find Guinness easy to drink. The lack of bite to it makes it easy to down but takes away from the enjoyment significantly.

209,754,jayc333,3.78,"Decided to try the nitro bottle because it's the only ""take-home"" Guinness product (most pubs have imported Irish Guinness on tap) that isn't brewed in Toronto.  Poured a solid black with ruby hues at the sides. There was no cascading effect like what you get from the tap or nitro cans, and there was only a lace of tan head. Not impressive, but it clearly states on the label to drink it from the bottle, so it shouldnt really matter.  Smells strongly of blended chocolate and caramel with a hint of coffee thrown in.  Taste is the opposite of the smell strangely. Strong coffee up front, with hints of chocolate and caramel. A tad watery, but without the brutal aftertaste I remember from my last experience with the nitro can.  Mouthfeel is perfect as always. Silky smooth, with the ability to drink these all night.

Besides looking the part, it felt like a Guinness. Milkshake-like texture.  However, there was little smell or tasted. It was smooth. So smooth that it lacked character.

Appearance is good enough -- almost-black, with a tan, creamy head -- but I didn't get much of that famous Guinness ""cascade"" effect off the nitro can. The nose is pretty comparable to the tap version of Guinness, by my memory at least -- lots of roast malt/burnt carbon smells. A bit like dirty water. Taste is definitely disappointing, with a big, upfront metallic sweetness that then morphs into a burnt-tasting malt bitterness. Quite a different taste experience than the nitro-bottle version. Mouthfeel is very thin and watery, with none of the grittiness present in the nitro-bottle.  Overall, what can I say? I love Guinness when it's fresh, high-quality and poured correctly. I don't like it when it's none of those things, and that's what this can represents. Bleh. Tir na Nog, I miss you.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,rustymoore,3.18,Guinness Draught to me is one of the most mediocre stouts out there but here goes. Pours thick brown which slowly develops into a dark black. Smell has coffee and chocolate notes. The taste is very watery and milky. Doesn't have very much flavor at all....the coffee is there but it's not as pronounced as in some stouts. Overall is just a very average beer.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Malty grainy smokey flavor has some sweetness, is very smooth and feels silky on the palate and tongue. Satisfying.  A great beer to casually sit, sip and enjoy, preferably in the appropriate pub atmosphere with your chums, but not required.  Check that, I'll veritably pound ONE, then sit, sip and enjoy a couple more in the company of friends.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,sammy44,3.04,"On-tap at Atkin's Park Tavern in Smyrna, GA. Needed a session beer for a birthday/happy hour after work and the old reliable was on tap. Served in a pint glass.  Appearance was great with an opaque shiny black and a creamy off white head. A beer that cascades as the head rises has to be one of the coolest things on earth. The head stayed at about 1/4"" and coated the glass on the way down. The smell was kinda weak, which is disappointing. The taste was mild coffee and chocolate. The mouthfeel is great at first as you get some of the creamy head in every mouthful but as the head fades the beer just feels watery. Creamy that changes to watery = Average.  A good session beer that you can easily knock back several in one sitting without getting shnockered.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

M: If any beer is approiately labeled ""smooth"", it's this. Thick, creamy mouthfeel that finished dry.

Bitter tang becomes a nice semisweet finish.  M: Too thin for my liking. Leaves the tongue very quickly.  D: It's good to have every now and then.

209,754,TheEclecticGent,3.93,"I poured this beer out of an 11.2 oz nitro rocket-widget bottle into a Guinness pint glass. I feel like I really get cheated with only 11.2 ounces, the beer only comes up to the label on the pint glass. It has that beautiful Guinness cascade and the lovely thick nitro tan head that is a rock solid 1 thick. The beer itself appears black as night but is actually very, very, very dark brown. The modern nitro Guinness in a can and bottle to me has very little smell. What smell there is a light hoppy dry smell that smells like brown paper. When I first started drinking Guinness in the standard bottles many years ago, it had a yeasty sludge in the bottom of the bottle and appeared to be bottle fermented and carbonated  a completely different drink. However, this is a classic as well. The mouthfeel is smooth and amazingly light for a stout. The taste starts with a sharp bite of carbonized grain, to a dry almost ethereal warmth, and end with a dry aftertaste. A bit of a very light chocolate overtone in the flavor and a bit smokey as well. Nothing quite like a Guinness. This is a very drinkable stout, although I couldnt slam as many Guinnesses as say Sweetwater 420 or other lighter beers.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,nicksta,4.15,"I am reviewing this from the nitro can this time.  The appearance is a jet black solid with brown edging. In the beginning the carbonation rises and rises, not as much as in a bottle though, and it finally settles in the form of a tan pancake on top of the beer.  The smell has faint hints of mocha ringing through and not much else. A little disapointing.  The taste is very much like the bottle. Roasted, creamy, hints of chocolate and toffee, and rounded out with black coffe bitterness. Always let it warm up a bit just to let you know.  The mouthfeel is still light, but not as light, like the bottled version.  The drinkability is better than ever! Chug, chug, chug!, or great as a session beer.  Not bad but I still prefer the nitro-bottled version.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Phatz,4.16,"Presentation: Tall nitro-can loaded with the Rocket Widget. Nice touch (some people have called it a pointless gimmick but the appearance of the beer is a beauty so...). Served in my pint glass at 50 degrees. This review is the same as my previous review of the nitro bottle. I think it is just as good in the can as it is in the bottle and maybe more convenient IMO.  Appearance: Pours a great noble brown and sits in my pint glass looking very black. There are slight red hues as the light reflects, but it looks quite black. Awesome creamy off white head that lasted the entire duration of the beer. Substantial and lasting lacing is impressive.  Smell: A bit of dark fruit. It has a unique and surprising mild sweetness about it.  Taste: Some chocolate and some raspberries. On the first sip I am impressed by the Dry characteristic of the beer. It invades on the taste for only a moment though. After that the surprising sweet almost dry fruit flavor but not quite fruit (to dry to be fruit) unless you add a certain toastedness to the description. Evident dark malts. Very mild flavor but very enjoyable. The only bitterness is a very slight hint after the dryness in the aftertaste. Overall, very pleasant taste.  Mouthfeel: A bit thinner than I'd expect from a stout; somewhat lighter in weight and in body. DRY! This beer screams Irish DRY Stout from moment one. It is fantastically crisp with just the right amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Very VERY drinkable. Nice and tasty, light weight (sits easy in your stomach) low ABV, no extreme characteristics; all make this an easy guzzler. There is a low quality bar down the street from my house. They carry almost nothing worth drinking but it is the only bar close to my house. Guinness Draught is the only thing they have that I am interested in; and that is the best thing about this beer. It's everywhere! For an easily accessible beer made by a 'Big Brewery' this is definitely one of the best 'Big Brewery' beers out there. The only Macro characteristic it has is that partway between the middle of your mouth and the swallow I noticed a small empty watery space that had a little gap in the flavor. Nothing substantial and certainly forgivable but characteristic of big breweries. I highly recommend this as a Bar Beer. When you are at a bar with limited selection it is likely they will carry Guinness Draught and it is a great fallback choice and a regular in my fridge.  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,DarkerTheBetter,4.33,"This beer came a dark brown that let a lot of light through giving it some burgundy highlights. The head was a lovely pale tan that was flat and creamy. Smells of delightfully toasted malts with a distinctive sweet and sourness behind it that I can only say smells like Guinness. Tastes initially of a cocktail of dry roasted malts that springs to life with a pleasantly subdued sweetness, and then finishes dry with a coffee and cream and a gentle nip of hops. The mouth feel is a silky thin to medium body and flat. The real kicker here is the little bit of head that makes its way into my mouth on each sip that simply floats along my palate. Thats invigorating and down right enjoyable! Whats not to love?",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

As the beer begins to settle and the cascading effect kicks in, a beautiful scene in a glass takes place. Soon, a white, creamy lace head stands atop an almost black body of beer, with ruby/brown trim. It also shows sheets of lace down the glass. Draught smells of dark chocolate and coffee, and tastes malty and bready with sharp coffee/cocoa accents. A burnt malt and tangy hop aftertaste is noticeable after each sip. There is also a very slight metallic tang. The beer mellows as it warms. Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and has no carbonation. It offers a thin mouthfeel, and glides away very quickly, effortless to drink. Its smooth as silk. Not bad, and can be found anywhere.

The pint is topped with a perfect 1/2 inch cap of dense miniscule stone bubbles that looks more like a dollop of cream. This one needed some time to warm up as it arrived at a standard bar draft temperature, which was far too cold. During the entire pint, the head never diminished at all, and there was plenty left once the beer was gone, even after painting the inside of the glass with lacing. Deep dark, almost black, with ruby highlights. The smell is of faint roasted malts and little else. The taste is slightly bitter up front with deep roasted malt, almost charcoal like, in the finish. There was something almost sour about it. Light body and a generally smooth mouthfeel, it is also a bit drying.

S- The soft note of dark roasted barley has a hint of black coffee, and dark chocolate with a note of wet horse (but in a good way). The aroma is a bit light possibly due to the thick foam.  T- This beer has a cold taste to it even though it was at 50 degrees in the beer fridge. The taste of roasted black malt with a faint dry tartness is nice but too soft.

There's no more mesmerizing sight in all of beerdom than a properly poured nitro stout with all those millions of tiny bubbles cascading downward from a huge creamy head. Guinness has pronounced roastiness to go along with that characteristic lactic twang that homebrewers find so elusive. In keeping with the style, it is quite dry, but still I find the mouthfeel to be on the thin side for a stout, despite the creaminess that the proper gas mix can impart.  Guinness is a good beer, but alas it's not even my favorite Irish Stout. Usually after one pint I'm ready to move on to another beer. Wish I could have sampled it way back in the day before the realities of marketing and brewery consolidation set in.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,CaskofFlyingDog,3.76,"Poured into a regular straight pint glass. Poured black and brown. The nitro bubbled down. This told me there was definitely nitro in it.  Taste was burnt malts of course and slight dark chocolate. Not much hoppy character that I could tell. Very straightfoward and basic tasting other than that for a porter/stout. The smell is just sorta there (definitely burnt, dark, good smell though.) The mouthfeel is pretty much perfect. Thick almost like milk mouthfeel not taste. This beer also is quite easy on the stomach but I probably couldn't drink too many which is probably a good thing. I'd rather drink a few guinnesses than 8 Coors Light/Colorado Water.  Other thoughts on this beer: definitely a good beer. I respect this beer for being supposedly starting the 'stout' style. I must say if you are not into microbreweries and trying new things instead of settling with a 'best' this beer seems to be the top of the chain for people. It's quite sad and silly. I have a friend who's irish, has red hair, and wears all sorts of celtic stuff and Flogging Molly shirts. He doesn't like other porters and always compares them to 'the best.' To me it's a beer you ought to try even have once in a while but to say it's The Best is a little over the top. I will say though that I have not yet enjoyed it off the tap. I have been told that this is the ONLY way to drink it. After then I can feel not full of myself. I bet it is better though. P.S. it is great though if you want to feel full after drinking a beer. I hear over in Ireland it's not uncommon to drink one of these for breakfast with all the grains and carbs.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Very tight, nitro head, only a few centimeters thick - maybe one finger. Head stays around the whole way, leaves nice lacing.  S - not a whole lot of aroma, but what there is consists primarily of roasted malt. Almost no hop aroma.  T - roasted malt predominates. A little hop bitterness in there.

209,754,dnrobert24,3.79,"I imbibed this specific Guinness in an Irish pub overlooking the Baltimore Harbor. I had read somewhere that stouts go well with raw oysters so, seeing as I was on the harbor, in Baltomore, and already drinking a Guinness, I thought I'd give the Guinness/oyster combo a shot.  Poured from a nitro tap, the legendary Guinness head formed as the falling tan foam settled. The head is extraordinarily thick and creamy in appearance, texture, and taste. I had to push through the head to get to the black richness beneath and found the familiar roasted goodness. At 4.2%, it is easy to drink. One would expect a heavier beer, given the color, but this is one great sessioner. Aroma was clean and slightly toasty. The Guinness Draught is simple and good, much lighter in flavor than other stouts. I don't know if it's comparatively light stout flavor complemented the oysters or if they oysters would have paired better with a richer, roastier, stout-ier stout. I do know that I could have easily had another couple of these with a couple dozen oysters had I had the time to do it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Aroma is rather faint, save for a few subtlties, light roasted marshmallows, hint of chocolate and burnt coffee. Sour bitter flavor with light coffee, chocolate, roasty malts, tobacco. Rich and creamy on the palate with a clean, dry finish. One of the true gateway ales out there and a good one.

Simple but not boring. T&M: very light flavour of roasted barley followed by a thin-bodied and watery texture before quickly hitting the lightly sour and dryish aftertaste, while necessary bitterness for a stout is kept at bay...

Notheless, this was a very good version of Guinness. Similar great taste of malt and barely. Similar texture of heaviness and lightness. Same great apperance and smell. If possible when you have a can, I would recommend getting a glass since the can sometimes leaves a watery/metallic aftertaste that just ruins the whole Guinness experiance.  However, I would not recommend this in a can and if you have the money to buy Guinness I would say go the extra mile for the Extra Stought, as it is worth it.

209,754,casualbeerman,3.96,"I never would have assumed Guinness would appeal to me. Like I've said before, I have pretty moderate tastes. Mostly my beer preferences run to the moderate. Red/Amber Lagers and more recently, ""white"" (wheat) beers. I'm not generally into the really heavy, dark, bitter beers. So Guinness is was a pleasant surprise. Now first, let me say this is the single most appealing beverage I've ever seen. A lot of people use the comparisons to say motor oil to describe the appearance. I never understood that. From the very first time I saw Guinness, my first response was ""whoa, nothing could possibly taste as good as that looks"". For that matter, since I was watching TV, I thought nothing could look that appealing in person (not true as it turned out). Anyway, the smell is distinctive- carmalized malts and coffee. The taste is surpisingly pleasant. Rich, with some sweetness, and an uncanny similarity to strong coffee. Yes, it is quite bitter (which I usually don't enjoy), but the way the bitterness comes out makes it less objectionable. The bitterness is in the middle rather than the finish, and does not linger. I assume this is because the bitterness comes from the very dark malts rather than the hops. The mouthfeel is, like Guinness (or really like stout I guess) in general, unique but enjoyable. It is rich and thick, creamy even. The head is especially pleasant and creamy. Guinness is actually more drinkable than it seems, it goes down pretty well and even washes food down pretty well. But for some reason I find the taste and experience of this particular beer gets really old if I have more than one or two. So the drinkability is what I'd call mediocre. To me at least, Guinness is distinctively different, but quite pleasant. I don't really drink it often, and I definately don't rate this a good session beer, but its still very good and one or two of them every now and then hits a spot that nothing else I've yet had will.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

If appearance were the only thing about beer, I'd never drink anything else.  Aroma is weak, though, with a thin coffee-like licorice scent. No hops present in the nose, but a touch of chocolate is apparent on deep whiffs. Decent, but not perfect.  Bit of an astringency up-front on the flavor, followed by a touch of coffee and a very dry finish. No hops to speak of, more malty than anything. Quaffable.  Very thin mouthfeel, less like a stout than any other stout I've ever tasted. This isn't even as thick as a porter, or even some lagers and ales I've tasted.  Overall drinkability is okay. A bit too dry on the finish to be a favorite of mine, and there are certainly better stouts out there, but to be as available as it is pretty much everywhere, it's not bad.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BillyB,4.38,"Brilliant! Pours a deep dark black. Thick, cascading frothy brown head. The aroma is of dark malty sweetness, coffee, chocolate, toffee, caramel. Taste is a strong malt taste while still maintaining a decent bitter/sweet balance. Mouthfeel is smooth, a bit oily, not much carbonation. Overall a great beer and one of my favorite stouts.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,jarmby1711,3.31,"Typically black ,but at the bottom edges was semi transparent maroon. The head was dense cloudy and tan in colour (I love nitros) The smell was un exceptional toasted grains. the taste had lots of dark chocolate/ coffee the latter providing a balanced bitterness. The biggest disappointment is that it has a watery feel to it which overall makes it taste and feel as it has no body. A bit more oomph and it would rate a lot higher. Its drinkability is lessened by the watery qualities but I have sacrificed too many brain cells over the years to Guinness Draught not to keep this on my drink list",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,semihobo,3.41,"My 14.9 oz nitro can has those stupid guys in lab coats telling me to chill it for three hours. Okay, I did. Normally I don't like noting the glassware brand, but I have a sweet Guinness glass that holds the 14.9 oz brew nicely, even says ""Guinness Draught."" Ahh a thing to behold.  The can didn't explode all over, which is nice... started off dark coffee and then changed to chocolate milk as I finished the pour. Got the reverse cascading effect, and a perfect two finger head slowly manifested itself. Two simple layers, impossibly dense ivory on dark coffee. Say what you might about nitro cans, they release some gorgeous beers.  Smells of coffee, burnt wood, and a little bit of that new car smell. A touch of hops and maybe faint mint also. The smell is strong, which is nice. Smells almost like a caramel coffee ice cream.  No surprise, taste is heavy on the roasted barley. It melds with the hops, and I can't really tell the two apart -- this beer has one taste, the same in every sip IMO. A little bit of cream lurks within. The taste comes on mild and then peaks after a few seconds, with a small bitter finish. Something tastes a little like egg water. Kind of generic but okay.  Mouthfeel is very nitro, teeny bubbles that bathe the tongue. More watery than other nitro Irish Dry Stouts I've had, and not as creamy. A body this thin would be upsetting in other styles, but it's okay here.  Looks amazing, everything else is average, not bad or good. I know there's the campaign to drink it warmer, but I think only bad notes (a noticeable sour taste) emerge as it warms... I'll keep it cold. I don't really crave another, but except for the price (usually between moderately high to high) this is pretty sessionable with the light body, low ABV, and accessible taste.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,PBRstreetgang,3.92,"Pours very dark ruby, near opaque with lots of translucent highlights. Very creamy tan head; thin and tight and produces unreal retention but leaves only modest lacing. The smell is sweet in a milk stout sort of way, with roasted barley and english hop aromas becoming more apparent as it warms. The taste is bitter from the roasted malt, and black patent lends a smokey sour taste. A dry hop aftertaste becomes pronounced in the finish, but the drinkability remains high due to the light body and nitrogenration that create a creamy mouthfeel. The levels of specialty malt, burnt flavor and dry hops seem too bitter, and distrub the balance rather than compliment eachother. Otherwise a well-done session stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Mandrake,3.76,"This beer pours a very dark brown, almost black, and forms a light beige head about one finger high. Smell is unremarkable and a little sweet, with some light chocolate and malt. The taste wasn't very strong at all, but wasn't unpleasant. Again some light chocolate and malts, but very underwhelming for a stout. Very smooth mouthfeel, and extremely drinkable. Not bad, but not exceptional either.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,stevegamburg,3.81,"Guinness Draught, more than any other beer, is subject to a very broad range of opinions and you should try it youself and see if you like it.  I love the process of opening the can, listening for the nitro release, and pouring the black frothy liquid down the side of a glass. Then being entertained by the ""waterfall"" while a thick creamy head is forming. The aroma is decent and is of well roasted malts. The flavor is creamy, reminds me of chocolate milk, and is very mild as far as stouts go - almost watery. This is not the best stout by any stretch of the imagination but I do enjoy it occasionally, much like I enjoy Taco Bell even though I know that it is not good Mexican food.  This is a beer you can drink all night because if its mild flavor and relatively low alcohol content and it beats the crap out of standard cheap American lagers.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,dirtylou,3.91,"14.9oz nitro can, from the family's fridge  I remember my first guinness...couldn't have been more than 16 or 17, somewhere on the eastern seaboard in an amphitheatre parking lot before a phish show! i think i drank it out of the can and probably couldn't finish it. it has since become a staple around the parents house and a regular in the fridge when i make it back to charlotte  appearance: say what you will about nitro-can's but one thing they are good for is a flawless pour...this one pours a veary dark brown, tinted ruby, with a super creamy tan head that doesn't fade  smell: slightly sweet, nice roasty malt aromas, some smooth chocolate...overall pretty uneventful  taste: roasted malts, mild chocolate/cocoa powder and coffee flavors, slightly sweet. well balanced but again, uneventful  mouthfeel: ultra creamy, the benchmark for dry stout mouthfeel  drinkability: extremely drinkable",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,tempest,2.71,"I've had this periodically over that past couple years, largely because of tap-selections.  Looks great in the glass. Dark red, near black body with creamy white head and lacing.  Smells a little sweet, but something is off. Almost like the malt is a little sour. The taste really disappointed. There is some nice sweetness and the fainted bitterness, but it largely tastes like bad, watery malts.  The mouthfeel is too thin, almost watery. This makes for good drinkability, but unfortunately, one is good enough for me. I used to think this stuff was good until I tried other stout offerings.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,sevineyes,3.49,"Poured from a brown bottle with a black label. The name was the main element of the label design.  A: Superb. This beer poured nice and black with some dark walnut showing through the sides. A nice creamy, thick tan head that remained throughout the drink. Chunky lacing that started out as big areas of sheeting.  S: Malty and roasty. A sweetness that reminds me of roasted Almonds and some subtle fruitiness.  T: Not a very complex roasty flavor. Although the main flavor is a roastiness that begins as a sweentess and ends with the classic dry bitterness, the taste really doesn't go very far.  M: Creamy. Watery and dry at the same time with a little coating, but thin.  D: Superbly drinkable. Could easily be a session beer because it goes down so quick. Although I'd easily order many stouts time and time again, few dissappear this quick.  Overall: I think this beer hits its mark if the mark is to be easy to drink and drink and drink. The lack of complexity in the taste and thin moutfeel make you forget you're drinking a stout at all - which isn't necessarily a bad thing.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,MurphyMacManus,3.53,"On tap at the Calvert House Inn in Riverdale.  Appearance: dark brown/ black with creamy off-white head. Classic nitro stout appearance.  Smell: It smells almost exactly like the Extra Stout I always have in my fridge--roasty, malty, and with a strong resemblance to coffee. But the draught version isn't quite as aromatic as the Extra Stout.  Taste: Watered down Extra Stout. That's the best description I can give. It's not bad, but it lacks the roasty punch and hop kick of the Extra Stout, so points off here. I do think the tap version is better than the bottled stuff, though.  Mouthfeel: The nitro makes it nice and creamy, but the flavour doesn't match with that, so it's wonderfully thick while lacking in much real taste.  Drinkability: I suppose it would do all right as a session beer. The lack of flavour and creamy mouthfeel make it go down easily, (I had 2 pints tonight and wanted more) but I'd far prefer the Extra Stout to this stuff, even for long sessions. Why doesn't Guinness put the Extra Stout in kegs?",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Noxious26,3.33,"440ml nitro can pours nicely into a pint glass.  Black, opaque with a little bit of dark brown highlights when held to the light. Dense nitro head is light beige and 1 inch at the pour. Head retention is good. Lacing is sporadic, but where it latches on it's in big thick clumps.  Aroma is roasted malts with hints of sweetness and fruit. A little mild, but still pretty nice.  Taste is roasted malts at the start with a bit of coffee in the background. There's a bit of a herbal quality through the middle before finishing with a burnt character. Aftertaste is burnt with hints of coffee. Surprisingly, the sweetness that is evident in the aroma isn't present in the taste. After the first couple of sips the qualities at the start seem washed out and a bit watery and all you really get is the finish and aftertaste.  Medium bodied it's perhaps not as thick or full as it could be. Seems a bit out of balance as there really isn't any hop flavour or sweetness present to off set the burnt finish. The washed out start hurts the balance as well.  Surprisingly light for a stout, this beer pours down fairly easily. The only drawback for drinkability is that (like alot of stouts) it suffers a bit from the burnt finish and aftertaste. None the less, this is a pretty standard middle of the road stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,GuinnessHero,3.26,"This being the Americanized version of Guinness kind-of brought everything down a notch. The nitro-bottle doesn't do this beer justice compared to anything on-tap.  Appearance - Beautiful. I love the blackest, darkest beer you can give me.  Smell - Typical. Honestly nothing too special going on here. A hint of coffee maybe.  Taste - Silky smooth taste, not as much bitter enjoyment as I am used to with my favourite Extra Stout Guinness. Nonetheless, it's good for a first stout.  Mouthfeel - Good aftertaste. Leaves the mouth feeling smooth and lingers on for quite some time.  Drinkability - To a beginner beer drinker, this may seem way too heavy. It is heavy, but what's a beer without feeling like you ate a meal after it?",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,HugoGrim,3.97,"What can I say about this beer that has not already been said. Possibly the most visually appealing beer around in my opinion. From the token ""snow"" effect to the jet black body to the creamy firm head, you can't beat the visual effect. It leaves nice rings down the entire glass.  The smell is nothing amazing, but represents the brew fine.  The flavor is full, robust, roasted, malty, coffee, hints of chocolate, with a bitter kick. Very creamy.  Low ABV makes Guinness very drinkable. Almost too drinkable.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,metallistout,4.56,"How can you go wrong with this beer. Dark coffee with the carbonation cascading through the drink. Truley one of the best visuals of a beer.

209,754,Schwarzbart,3.54,"I know that this beer bottle was designed to drink the beer from the bottle and I have done so, but this time I poured it into a glass. I just have to see my Guinness to enjoy it more. First, the pour is one of the best with the cascading nitro effect. The head is a beautiful finger high creamy off-white and the lacing is great also. Aromas of caramel coffee, roasted malts, and white bread. Taste is not as flavorful as the aromas lead on, but there is still plenty of roasted malt flavor, but it tastes a little watery. Mouthfeel is thin for a stout, but Guinness usually has that quality and I sort of like that. Low alcohol content and not as filling as one may expect which would make this an easy session beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,wcudwight,3.38,A: Pours pitch black with brown and red hues. Small creamy tan head that last. Thick lace on the glass. S: Smells of coffee with just a hint of chocolate. T: Plentiful roasted malty sweetness with a very mild bitterness on the back of the tongue. Kind of a rubbery aftertaste and a little thin tasting for a stout. M: Creamy head feels good on the lips and in the mouth. A bit watery for a stout. D: Very drinkable. Good beer but better options for the style. Solid but not impressive.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,jaluria,3.55,"A dark brown color with a tan-colored head that has excellent retention and body. Smells of roasted barley. The taste is smooth and creamy with a dry finish that amplifies over time. Maybe it's just that I've had a number of Double Stouts and Milk/Sweet Stouts so to me, this beer seems rather bland. I know it's a good representation of the style, but it's just seems like something is missing. The texture of the beer, the richness of the beer seems to imply something else could be added, just don't ask me what that something is. Overall, this is a good beer that can be had several times, but I do think that it is a bit bland and can have additional complexity and flavors.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

T = Creamy with slight roasted malt flavour, followed by a faint sweetness. Yuck.  M = Watery.  D = Better stouts to drink.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,charlatan,3.08,"This looks fine (describing it is rather redundant), and its smell is pleasant. There is no coffee in the nose, but there is a little oatmeal, a creamy dairy smell and a hint of pilsner style clean hoppiness.  The taste is decent. There is a slightly roasted malt start, and a pleasant oatmeal tinged finish. The problem lies with the feel. This isn't velvety, thick and luxurious (like Rogue's Shakespeare Stout, or even as some proponents of Guinness would have you believe), but rather it is unconscionably watery, and thus the beer is terribly insubstantial. It is eminently drinkable, if you can be bothered. I'd rather have one bottle of Guinness Extra Stout than three pints of this though.  Please note this score seems much to high to me, but then again I think feel is much more important than appearance.

The truth is there are better Irish stouts out there and drinking nothing but Guinness is like drinking nothing but Budweiser. I drank this in both nitro bottle and nitro can and for some reason the bottle version is more flavourful while the can has a thicker mouthfeel (though this beer never has very much body). Some of the flavors aside from the typical roasted barley and coffee are nothing and sour beer. That's right! I said it! I taste sourness! That's weird, I'm used to bitterness, but never sourness. Almost like they put old beer in the mix with new beer. I actually have heard that this was true of the brewing process, but I can't be sure.

Kind of tasted like some old coffee. Mouthfeel: To me, the mouthfeel was light, watery, and thin. It also left a strong dry roasted malt aftertaste that lasted for a while.

Well, the liquid that comes in bottles and cans here in the states hardly seems like the same creamy, rich roasted malt beverage they serve in pubs all over Ireland. So thick it's almost chewy, with a head like nougat -- good bar-maids draw a four-leaf clover in the head with a dribble from the tap, and that clover stays there all the way to the bottom of the glass!  Chocolate, espresso, dates, all on a toasted biscuity dryness that finishes long and bitter. Sooo smooth and silky-creamy.

Moderately acidic and lightly bitter coffee and chocolate malt taste with some bland resin and orange hops flavor.  Medium bodied, dry almost creamy texture, no carbonation, and lightly metallic and moderately astringent finish.  Unless I mix Guiness as a black and tan, I'm not going to pay money for it however if It was close to being free I may.

209,754,woemad,2.25,"Had this on-tap at Mootsy's, a bar in downtown Spokane. I was siting at the bar, placidly working on my Godfather when a twenty-something hipster wannabe that was trying to carry four pints of Budweiser back to his booth, managed to spill all four of them onto the bar right in front of me. Nasty Budweiser badness spilled over the bar and onto my legs, making me smell as if I had been wading in the stuff. This Guinness was his peace offering to me. I selected it because I looked at the somewhat less than promising tap handles and decided it had been a long time since I'd had Guinness and, oh, what the hell?  When I received it there was the usual big, creamy nitro head. No shock there. But the color of the beer was shocking. Having once been a Guinness freak (long ago, before I stumbled across BA, I would only drink Guinness), I was shocked to see that even the muted light in a hipster bar could reveal that this was not the jet black Guinness of old, but something that looked very ruby red in color. A stout should not look this color, especially in very low light.  There was a vague scent of roasted malt, and a toffeeish sweetness, but that was it.  Very unimpressed here. I've had crappy stouts in crappy brewpubs that tasted more on target than this, a beer that is still seen by many as the industry standard for stouts. This started off with a very weak roastiness, then passed on to a clumsily overdone toffeeish sweetness. There was an extremely slight dryness at the swallow, almost imperceptable. Weak and bland!  This is the thinnest stout I've ever had. Downright watery. No stout should feel like this.  This goes down easy if you have a palate that requires a highly bland, inoffensive dark ale. I believe I saw a thread here a year or so ago from the Bros. as to how this beer had been recently noticeably dumbed down. It certainly seems that way to me. I've had too many good stouts to be able to drink this with any relish, regardless of how I once enjoyed it. Thomas Wolf was right - you can never go home again.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,niangelo,3.6,"Served in a pint-glass, poured from a nitro can at a local restaraunt. Special bonus review with my co-reviewing wife!  Poured black near the top, with some nice amber flashes at the bottom of the glass (""Dark cherry!"" remarks my wife). A thick, creamy head that sticks around for the duration of the drink - and I just can't help but draw a happy face in a thick head. Call me a kid blowing bubbles in his chocolate milk.  Lots of coffee and malt on the nose. Smells like a total cup of joe. My wife notes this a well.  Mouthfeel and slightly viscous with almost no carbonation. Very similar to straight off the tap! I think these nitro cans have done a fairly good job of what they are supposed to do. Taste is immediately tons of coffee! Fades into a slightly bitter maltiness, with a toasty finish.  Satisfying beer overall! A good overall introductory stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,charlottebeerguy,3.3,"I do love pouring nitro beers you have to enjoy watching that cascading in action. This beer pours deep black with a light tan head. Smell dosnt reveal anything. The retention on the head is ridiculous though ,it would sit there for days. A smooth mouthfeel paired with some biterness. Nothing spectacular but i wont snub my nose at it. I still buy this beer when im in a pinch. After all it is a tasty classic.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Albinoh,3.26,"Dark color with a good head, this beer has all the presentation going on, it makes me want to take a good sip. Smell was ok, i felt like it was hidding a good beer however i was not impressed later. Taste, same thing that was found in the aroma... roasted malt, maybe a little coffe/chocolate, like a moka but not showing a lot, a lot of bitterness that it didnt fit right with the rest. Watery mouthfeel... i felt the lack of body a little disappointing, i was expecting far more creamyness.  Good tending to average...",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,ski271,4.16,"Appearance: Very dark brown with a thick, creamy, light tan head with excellent retention and fabulous rings of lacing. The cascade is a thing of beauty!  Smell: Big roasted malts. Lightly sweet-smelling with aromas of cherries, oak, earth, and chocolate.  Taste: Starts out big but finishes rather thing and weak. A dark malty flavor dominates, accented by chocolate, cherries, and coffee. The finish is lightly bitter and dry, just enough to make you thirst for more.  Mouthfeel: Medium-full body, silky-dry texture, low carbonation.  Drinkability: I used to think of this as THE beer of beers. But now that Ive expanded my beer horizons, Ive been a little disappointed by this beer. I guess I just keep drinking it thinking its going to be as big and full as it looks. But as far as stouts go, its rather weak. But highly sessionable, and a true classic. Almost in a class of its own. I think if any beer is going to call itself the King of Beers, it should be Guinness (not that US macro swill) due to its age and worldwide popularity. One of the best looking beers though. I love how when I'm done with a pint I have to tip the glass back to get the last of that thick, creamy, tenacious head.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,beerfan82,3.66,Guinness draught from the bottle isn't that impressive from the outside can't see the beer at all. The smell is not there at all smells like water. Once you take a drink that's where the taste comes in. Drinking from the bottle is not as good as from the Tap but it loses some of it's creaminess. But other than that a pretty good beer.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,scooter231,2.82,"Dark, dark brown color. Funny, I recall when Guinness was black- like, no light escaping black. Hrm. Pours a gorgeous tan head though. No lacing, though. Smell is lovely- sweet malts, some roastedness, a hint of caramel. Taste is not nearly as deep. In fact, it's downright lacking. Bitter, but not bitter enough. Slightly roasted. Something reminds me of soy, as well. Almost seems salty. I don't know, I'm just not digging it. Mouthfeel is watery, not that creamy, and pretty boring. Fairly drinkable, but on the whole, I'm no longer impressed with this Guinness. Not giving up hope, though.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Fiset35,3.88,"Delicious Guinness. Possibly the most recognizable dark beer, ever. As far as Irish stouts go, it's one of the lighter ones, but delicious none the less, and the 4.2 alc/vol insures that you can savor many on an afternoon without going berzerk. (After you've had a Guinness or two, next time try Guinness Extra Stout for a super treat)  Initial taste (after you get through the billowing head of the beer) is a bitter, slightly burnt coffee taste. As you continue through the beer, the flavor becomes richer and more prominent throughout, but not harsh at all.  This beer is highly recommended on tap. The canned version (14 oz) is decent, but a perfect head is difficult to obtain out of the bottle - even with the invention of the ""rocket-widget"". Deduct .5 from each cattegory from the bottle.  Have a draft, and a song. You'll thank me (and everyone before you) later.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,battlekow,2.11,"Reviewing this simultaneously with Guinness Extra Stout. They're both almost-opaque black, just a little bit of ruby showing through when held up to the light. Unlike the Extra, the regular Guinness has a thick, off-white head that's almost frighteningly creamy. Lacing is good, I suppose, but you can't even really call it lacing, because the enormous head just won't go away. It's starting to scare me--the Guinness Blob. Smells smoky and unpleasant, like meat. Taste is even worse, with the same smoky character but with some plastic thrown in for ""good"" measure. Mouthfeel is literally like water. This is just awful.  Note: according to the bottles, the Extra Stout was brewed in Canada, but the Draught imported directly from Ireland.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,DevilDogBeer,4.71,"Guinness is one of the most unique beers I have tasted. Even with its fame around the world as the leading Dry Irish Stout the Guinness Brewery continues to make a quality product. The nitro-bottle can be drunken straight form the bottle or poured into a pint glass (or smaller, the bottle holds 11.2 fl. oz, 0.8 oz must be used for the ""rocket-widget""). The famed surge settles quicker from the bottle than form a nitro-forced tap, but it still flows into a tan creamy head. The smell is a bit on the sour side due to their souring technique, and few hops are detectable; just enough to balance out malt sweetness. The taste is something I have only found in a Guinness. The sour taste on top of the dry and roasted malt characteristics make this a complex beer whose flavors compliment each other. The mouth feel is smooth but not overly heavy; a common misconception due to Guinness's deep ruby color. This beer is very drinkable and does not leave a bloated or full feeling. A true winner for the average beer drinker looking for something other than Coors, Miller, or Bud; or for homebrewers looking for a good case at the beer distributor.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,jettjon,3.53,"Pours a dark brown with that famous Guinness nitrogen-fueled head of fine, dark tan, small bubbles that lingers and lingers. Best head on a beer Ive personally encountered. Smell is pleasingly mild, with hints of charred barley. Taste is slightly bitter, with something of a coffee flavor. Smooth and very watery mouthfeel. Mild, coffee/bitter aftertaste. Very drinkable. This would be a good beer to enjoy all night on tap, but in bottles at $8.50 per sixer, its of dubious value. (Note: drink them out of the bottle. Poured, they sometimes taste flat.)",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Bestuurder,3.39,"The cascading effect is unhallengable by anyone. This s possibly the best stout from a Nitro I have ever had, and I'm not a natural Guinness supporter.  At first pour, it poured the patented Guinness black, and poured properly gave a thick, smooth, 1 1/2"" head that lasted all the way through (characteristic of any true Diageo brew). The aroma was pleasant, and full of chocolate notes, along with a fluffy taste and full body. Evenly thick throughout, and finishes very nicely in all manners. Virtually no aftertaste, which left me yearning for another, and another, and another (as long as you can stomach the weight).",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Golden2wenty1,2.74,"Grabbed a pint on tap at Bullfeather's off State Street here in Madison. I've been on a stout kick of late and sadly this just doesn't hold up to domestic stouts I've had.  Poured jet black with an off-white creamy head that lasted for the entire pint. Helps the appearance but can't help the smell which is mostly neutral, some faint grainy malts, maybe some metallic notes, that's about it. Taste is rather neutral as well. Quite watery with some grainy/oatmeal malts. Slightly sweet, but not to any interesting degree. Mouthfeel is excedingly thin and watery. I could drink it forever, but I really don't have a desire to as the palate was right up there with the Shiner Bock I had last night, which is certainly not saying much.

Not that it is ever as good as on tap but they've set it up so a pour from a nitro can or bottle still gets you the bubble vortex in your glass. As you watch the golden cascade, the pillow of foam floats on top. You may not be able to walk on it but you can draw a clover. Oh, yeah, this beer is dark. Very dark.  The smell out of this is very low. It is like a smell on a breeze and you can pick up the smells of chocolate, sorghum, molasses, or some other mellow sweetness off in the distance.  This Irish fellow is thick but mellow in your mouth. It coats it just a bit with a creamy feel. Along with those other flavors in the smell, it also seems to have an essence of raisin. Very smooth, mellow, and not bitter at all.  I'm not a Guinness disciple but I do enjoy it at times. However, one is usually enough for me and it is hard for me to have another one because of how much it fills me up.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Rootdog316,3.53,"Poured a nice dark ebony brown. The head was bright white not as tan as I would have thought. The aroma was weaker than expected with notes of roasted barley.

Appearence is hard to beat, cream coloured and cream textured head atop an almost jet black body. Some ruby colour filters through when holding pint glass to the light. Smells of nothing much, I think the intense head acts as a lid! Taste: roast malts, a little hops, some rustiness combine with the excellent mouthfeel to give a satisfying sensation. Drinkability: this is a session beer and no doubt. The 4.2% abv explains why this draught has been the mainstay of much of Irish social life for years.  Drawbacks: Often served too cold in Dublin pubs. Also there is a good deal of variation to be had. I don't know is this can be explained by the fact that the pubs have been doing their own line maintenence for the last 10 years or so, and must vary in their diligence in this regard.  This is so different to bottled Guinness.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Taste... light roasted malt, but rather flat. Not as flat as the bottled version... THAT, I really disliked. This was OK.  Mouthfeel was OK.

Taste is so-so. Begins with a creamy almost water like feel on the tongue. A little bitterness hits the back of the throat when going down, and lingers around for a while until you take the next sip. I find this beer very thin in the mouthfeel...much like boddingtons, taste very much like water and cream.  Saying that, drinkability is not to bad but dont expect to down 8 of these in a session, nice for a cold day during winter.

One of the main reasons I wanted to turn 21 was so I could have Guinness on tap. Once I started drinking it on tap I had to say I was a bit dissapointed. Being that I'm irish, I felt like it was my duty to like it. All my friends swore by it but over time I just had to be honest....this beer aint that great. Extra Stout and Foreign Extra Stout blow this beer out of the water. Guiness Draught is just Black Water.  Appearance: Pitch black after the casade is done. Nice creamy head.  Smell: Some roasted coffee and chocolate...although a mild scent  Taste: As my one friend says...""it's a bit soupy"". The defining tastes of Guinness are that artifical creaminess from the nitro and a skunky water taste. Their is a hint of roasted malts and coffee...but I'm talking just a hint.

There wasn't a lot of carbonation evident. The scent wasn't very remarkable; there were slight hints of chocolate and malt, but not much else.  Tasting: Guinness is a satisfying pub stout and session brew. It was rather dry, without real hop bitterness. Malts dominated the tongue, as well as a bit of chocolate. It's a full-bodied beer, which I liked, and it's very easy to drink, mainly because of the low alcohol content.  Poured well, this is a fine beer. I recommend it for anyone who is looking to try ""better beer"" in this category. There certainly are more adventurous stouts, but this is a good start.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,johnrobe,2.93,"I carried in several of these on a backpacking trip in the rugged South Cumberland plateau region of TN. I find that nitro cans are the best option for beer in the backcountry. They're lightweight, and because the carbonation won't activate until opened, you won't generate ticking timebombs from constant movement on the trail. Unfortunately this was my only nitro-can option at my local grocery store. Oh well, I guess it could be worse. It poured an almost opaque black with the signature nitro cascading effect which leaves a creamy, albeit thin, beige head. Roasted barley is the only significant flavor and it is not particularly deep and palate coating. Overall the brew is pretty thin, even for a low alc, stout. However this gives it high marks in drinkability and I'd choose this over many domestic adjunct lagers on a hot summer day. It was very satisfying after several miles on the trail.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Smell-charred barely, hints of chocolate and coffee, sweet roasted malt as well.  Taste-charred bitter taste, some notes of chocolate and coffee but really subdued, creamy yet bland somehow. Thick but somehow syrupy for a stout.  Mouthfeel-decent enough, creamy and with a slight aftertaste of coffee. Pretty good.  Drinkability-less alcohol and calories than budweiser, if you can handle the thickness your fine.  Overall-Dissapointing, what has happened to this beer? A dilluted down version of itself even among Dry Irish stouts. Beamish has much more flavor, give that a try instead.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,arguemaniac,3.02,"Note: I only poured about two-thirds of the beer into a pint glass and drank the rest from the bottle (Ive heard from a number of folks that drinking from bottle is the only way to really taste this particular beer).  Appearance: At first an interesting cascading carbonation effect that is associated with nitro-taps. After that there is a truly creamy and sustaining light tan head of roughly a quarter-inch. Impressively, the head sustains throughout the whole time I was drinking the beer (wow!). The beer is almost entirely black in color with some very dark ruby hues coming through as well.  Aroma: The beer has that familiar nitro sweetness to it that is very present in the aroma. I can also smell some roasted coffee scents as well but they are somewhat masked by the nitro stench.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Compared to many other beers the mouthfeel of this particular brew has a medium body, but is very thin when compared to most other stouts. In fact, relative to many other dry stouts its actually quite light and watery. The nitro funk is also very present in the taste, but the roastiness and coffee flavors come through very nicely. There is also some very mild grain and caramel flavors, with a smooth overall chocolate character as well. When sipped from the bottle the beer tastes a little sweeter and the roasted flavors come through a bit better. A strong roasted coffee bitterness in the finish. There is very little hop character to this beer.  Overall its a good beer, but I really cant stand what the nitro tap does to beers like this: while it gives the beer a nice sustaining head, it adds this unpleasant sweetness to it that I think detracts from the overall aroma and flavor of the beer. Also, its pretty thin and watery for a stout. On the other hand, because this beer is fairly light and drinkable, it would make a great session beer (which cant be said about too many dry-stouts out there, IMHO). Also, the bottle says that this beer has less than 130 calories per 12oz serving, so for anyone on a diet, Id imagine that this is easily a much more flavorful choice than just about any other light beer out there. Still, even though beers of this style are prized for their roasted maltiness, I would have liked to have smelled and tasted more hop character. All and all, not amazing, but pretty good.

209,754,beermanbrian,2.59,While i always considered this the standard for a stout i was disappointed when i actually sat down to review it. I drank it from one of the nitro bottles. Maybe the bottling process causes it to loose some of its appeal vs the keg served variety in a bar that i am used to. As stated on the bottle i did not pour into a glass and drank straight from the bottle. I also find it funny that the bottle says to drink cold (i always thought you should drink it at around 50)  My appearance rating is based on the wonderful head and great dark color you get when getting it out of a keg at a bar.

Sure, I may have been about 17 years old when I last had a Guiness, but in those last 5 years it seems amazing that my perceptions could change THIS much. I remember a brew that was completely impermeable to all light and that was damn near completely intolerable because of the dryness and the bitter roastiness of the malt. Now all I taste is a creamy, watery substance with a very small residual hint of the roasted barley. The beer even shines through a small hint of ruby, though I suppose it is still dark enough that I could have exaggerated the intensity in my youth. The head is a sticky, creamy foam, actually looks quite appealing. The smell was decent too, but the richness of the aroma was lost in the taste, which as I said was like water. No dryness to be spoken of. No wonder so many masses of mindless Americans are able pound so much of this shit each year on the day where everybody suddenly thinks they are Irish. It wasn't totally bad, but for the stout I remember, it was VERY disappointing. I'll stick to Rogue's Shakespeare, Chocolate, or Imperial Stouts when I have the craving for something a little roasty.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,zacharius,3.04,"This beer pours a thick white head with tiny bubbles that lasts through the glass. The body of the beer is almost black but has a ruby tinge. Aroma is all malt. Taste is roasted malt with a barely detectable hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is creamy. Drinkablity is good, a great session beer but probably would get boring after a few.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,TheGipper,2.32,"I wanted to wait until I got to Ireland and had a taste of Guiness in its homeland to make this review, and I finally did. I could not be more disappointed. The idea that this average (at best) stout tastes better in a Dublin pub than it does at, say, a Times Square tourist trap, is nothing but myth. It's served just as cold in the pubs of Ireland (and I went to several throughout the west, south, and in Dublin) as it is here. The appearance makes this beer, while the lack of any sort of flavor beyond a bland feint, nondistinctive, cold coffee effect ruins the legend. I always suspected that Guiness was nothing more than marketing and myth; know I know. Don't believe the hype of this Hibernian Budweiser.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,twelvsies,3.41,"Like a lot of us, I really used to like Guinness when I first got into drinking better beer. Since I've been checking out this site and trying new beers all the time I really kind of forgot about it and haven't had it in a while. Last night in honor of St. Patty's I started my night off with a Guinness on tap. I really wasn't too impressed. I mean it still has those typical Guinness things that you like; the nice classic Guinness appearance, the easy quaffability, etc... But it's really not that tasty to me anymore. There are better dry stouts. So I was thinking this last night and then my thoughts seemed to be backed up by the forum post about the declining quality of Guinness over the years. It's definately been popularized and rather macro-ized and really has kind of become a characature of itself. I prefer it out of the can for the cascade effect but really it's kind of just become a novelty act.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Gruntlumber,3.43,"I don't know why I'm reviewing this. If you've never had Guinness you must be from another planet. However, after having a few of these recently I figured what the hell, I'll post my thoughts.  I prefer the nitro cans poured into a glass, but straight from the bottle ain't bad either. It's the most easy drinking stout out there, which isn't to say it is the best stout. I ordered a bottle at a restaurant and couldn't believe how fast I drank it. So I got another and did the same thing. It's almost like a stout light. Very average on all levels compared to good stouts, but this is the most drinkable session stout I can think of. Great with almost all types of food.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,kmpitz2,4.15,"This beer pours a slightly rubied dark dark brown to black color with a finger of tight foam over top. The nose is nice and roasty, right about where I expect things to be. The flavor is nice, but a little thin for me. I want a bit more full flavor. The aftertaste has a nice bitter roasty quality to it. The feel is moderate and creamy. Overall, the aftertaste keeps me coming back to this beer time and time again. Its not as dry as others I have had in the past couple of days. I think Guinness may have been toppled as the best irish stout in my book. I still like and enjoy it, but it seems to be missing something here.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,tomthumbsblues,4.06,"It's St. Patrick's Day so I'm reviewing Guinness. I obtained my Guinness in one of those 14.9 oz. cans. Guinness pours a black color with no light to be seen through it. What little light appears around the edges of the glass is an extremely dark reddish brown. The creamy off-white head is about one finger high and stays on top of the beer producing a good web of lacing on the glass. The smell is of coffee and roasted malt with a slight burnt character as well. The taste is of coffee and cream, and bitter roasted malt. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth with hardly any carbonation. Guinness is a great beer, but certainly not the end all be all of beer. I'd have another though.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,mgdeth,3.87,"Appearance - I don't think you can beat the appearance of Guinness in a nitro tap. Upside down bubble action, excellent creamy head with good retention and lace. Dark!  Smell - There's not as much to this beer as I would like. Slight roasty malt aroma.  Taste - Dry is right. Roasty and burnt flavor dominate. But it has that special tang to it at the end that makes it special! Always reliable.  Mouthfeel - Creamy mouthfeel, and smooth, despite being relatively heavy.  Drinkability - This beer is easy to consume, unless something like ""flavor"" gets in your way. It is not high in alcohol, but many folks still seem to shy away from this beer because of its color.  Comments - I've noticed many reviews knocking pretty hard on this beer. To be sure, there are stouts out there that are more exciting in certain ways. However, this beer is a classic in my opinion. The beer probably also has played an important role in the advance of craft beer in the United States (again, in my opinion).",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Gagnonsux,3.03,"Is this the most reviewed beer on BA? In my opinion it might be one of the most overated too. The appearance is good enough. Almost black in color with a sizable creamy head from the nitro. The aroma is lightly of roasted chocolate, but not strong or memorable. This is light on taste, it's unoffensive, but not notable. Roasted taste is noted, but seems too restrained. Taste is too watery for a stout and needs more character. I won't be picking this up again.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,beersarang,3.26,"Nitro tap pours with the creamiest of creamy heads and thick lacing all the way down the glass. Dark brown, not black.  Faint aroma... too faint to discern.  Flavor, mild toasted malts, far far too mild for a stout. Even milder bitterness. Not characteristic of a stout at all, maybe a cream stout?  Pretty thin body, quite dissapointing.  Goes down smooth and easy, considering its practically water. Good, but seriously... This is not an irish stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Barraclou,3,"Presentation: It was over 5 years that I had a Guinness. At that time, I didn't liked that brew, but I am giving it another try with this 14oz nitro can. So, I don't start with overated or underrated opinion, neither the 300+ years history of this brewer will influence me. Others brewers such as Molson in Canada or some Europeans are old brewers too. According to the official Guinness website, Guinness Draught is only brewed since 1961.  Appearance: It's darker than coffee. The nitrogen helps it to produce an awesome brew to look perfect. I loved it to pour and to watch its great neck.  Smell: Very weak. Some roasted grain smell with hoppy finish.  Taste: A mix of roasted coffee grain and water.  Mouthfeel: Way too watery, but with a bitter aftertaste.  Drinkability: This second time, I enjoyed more my drinking time, but I am disappointed by its lack of taste and personnality. After it is poured in your glass, it is like drinking cold coffee. I hope that I missed something and I hope to review it again.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,rowew,3.37,"I have to admit - I am not that thrilled about the beer, but a well poured Guinness settling is one of the most beautiful sights on earth. The beer is good - but not all that many Guinness junkies claim. It is a nice dry stout - smooth and easy to drink. At many ""Irish"" bars in the US it is the closest you can get to real beer, so it fills a nice niche. The malt bill is impressive - it does have a nice deep malt taste and aroma.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Smells are of dark coffee and malts.  The taste however is very disappointing. Its very weak and I would even say watery. It doesnt have a lot of character.  Its like a trophy beer.. all appearance and no substance.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,edchef1850,4.51,"there is something about guinness that always makes me happy. maybe its the great memories it conjures up, sitting in an irish pub with my grandfather, sawdust on the floor, the smell of stale beer in the air, a coca cola in front of me, and the dream of someday owning my own pub, or playing major league baseball, or being a proffessional cyclist. Well a bar owner it is, a bar with of course, guinness on tap. I am probably a little biased in my review of guinness, there might be other stouts out there that may technically have a better mouth feel, or slightly more complex aromas, but none of them have what guinness has. There isnt another beer out there that commands such love as guinness.This is what sets guinness apart, what makes it special. I love beer of all styles,colors, countries, and continents. I have made beer, read about beer, written about it, and made a living selling it. I will always come back to guinness.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,wisnerd,3.93,"Ahhh, Guinness. The one who opened my eyes to better beer.  Though not the best tasting beer I've ever had, Guinness is an old faithful for me. After many a pint I have finally had the presence of mind to post on it.  As is often said, Guinness is best enjoyed out of a tap, but for lack of a kegerator I enjoyed it out of a nitro can. There is nothing like the look of a Guinness pour with the cascade joy that ensues, it is as the slogan says ""Brilliant!"" The beer is just not as thick out of the can however and the effect doesn't last for long, although I had a nice creamy head on my glass for the duration of the experience. It smells of coffee and dark roasted malt and tastes of it too with a good dry bitterness on the palate. Compared to some other stouts it is not nearly as full bodied in the mouth but this does assist me in drinking large quantities of the ol' black stuff.  Everyone should have at least one pint of Guiness draught in their lifetime, and that is all there is to it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Gaisgeil,3.31,"Oh yes, good ol' Guinness, is it just me, or does it seem like Guinness from a bottle or can is just wrong somehow? I've always liked the tap version, it seems much more full and rich.  Anyhow, this one pours from a widget laden bottle giving the pint that classic Guinness nitro head. Creamy and very nice on the lips. Smell is okay, subdued, roasted malt and a bit of a bitter smell. Taste is... well, not what you'd expect it to be if you've only had it draft. Malty with a prevailing bitterness that trails into nothing, very little aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin and surprising as if you just look at the pint, it looks like the perfect stout, thick and chewy, but no, disappointing.  I think I'll stay away from Guinness in this form, it just doesn't live up the name I don't think.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,stjarnflikka,3.56,"Pours a very dark, reddish around the edges, beer with the very special Guinness foam that comes from the nitro, stays on top of the beer throughout drinking.  Smell is better than can version. Dark, roasted with clear dry and bitter traces. Somewhat malty but generally nice.  Taste is dark, roasted and malty. Its bitter with a dry malt touch to it, served a bit could to bring out all the taste though.  Guinness is guinness, whether or not you like it ;) This beer should be on tap, not on can or bottle. The only decent guinness on bottle is the foreign extra which taste even better than this one.  Still, Guinness is a classic.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,mjc410,3.86,"Appearance: Poured from the nitro can into a snifter. By far the most beautiful beer I've ever seen. The only reason I avoid giving it a five is because of my inexperience. The body is utterly black, and it's amazing to see the wonderfully creamy tan head rise out of the liquid in the famous cascading effect. The width of the snifter allows the beer to spread out, forming a huge pool of miniscule tan buddles, almost too small to see.  Smell: Light, which belies it's dark character. Slight malts competing (and slightly beating out) slight hops.  Taste: Initial dark malts, including hints of coffee and chocolate. Nothing very pronounced, but very smooth. Hop bitterness comes in at the end in a perfect balance (that is, very light to match the malts)  Mouthfeel: Smooth, very thick and mouth-coating. Has a creamy element to it. The most satisfying stout I've had in terms of mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Superb! It's so smooth and has such a low ABV that it's no problem. It may not be very complex, but sometimes that's ok.  Notes: Like Corona, a geniously marketed import. Unlike Corona, Guinness has quality to back up the hype. I'd heard that Guinness was ""like a meal."" That is definitely not true. Although it is pretty thick, the calories and heaviness don't allow me to agree. 12 oz of Mountain Dew has 170 cal, while a Guinness has only 126. I drank 9 cans of this and a pint on my birthday, so it gets big points for drinkability.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,hero27,3.98,"Had on-tap @ the Lava Lounge in Waterloo, Iowa..  I asked the bartender if their Guinness was on nitro-tap. He said it was regular Co2 but explained that it was a slow-pour tapper. He wasn't kidding... It took almost 3 minutes to completely fill the glass. When it got to me, it had the characteristic black color but not the dense, ultratight head that the nitro has. Still, a damn good looking beer nonetheless.  Same roasted aroma and taste that you'd expect from Guinness, creamy mouthfeel and smooth going down. I noticed that Guinness on nitro is more creamy and has a better mouthfeel and look thanks to the dense head, but felt that the nitro takes a little bit away from the taste. Still a great session beer and a great fallback on-tap if there's nothing better around.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,whartontallboy,2.41,"Didn't think drinking straight from a plastic-coated bottle sounded like fun, so I poured this one into a pint glass. Head was a little disappointing for a nitro, but it's still dark black and looks like Guiness. Smell is burnt malt and coffee. I haven't had a Guiness since returning from the UK a few years ago, and maybe I've become a big-boy stout drinker since then, but the taste is way too weak for me. There are some flavors like roast malt and coffee in there, but it's so weak it feels like you've mixed a bigger stout with a glass of water. Bit of a watery taste in there as well. Mouthfeel is dry and thin. Really thin. Eating-disorder thin.  Overall: Eh. Widely available as a fall-back, but it's so watery that I can't imagine ever falling back to it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,kosmoraios,2.72,"To me, guiness is the macrobrew of english stouts. It poured a deep black into my mug, with a tan head that lingered for quite some time. The smells are of chocolate and coffee, with that malt base. The taste is of malt, molasses, chocolate and coffee, with a bit of yeast and not a hint of hops coming through. Perhaps a bit of very dark bread, also. To me, the mouthfeel is almost milky, with not enough of the carbonation or pepperiness that I enjoy. For that reason, I find Guinness to not be a very drinkable ale. I do quite enjoy a good stout, but for some reason I am not very fond of Guinness. Perhaps it is because I have only had the American bottled version and the nitro can.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,sweetwaterman,4.15,"Guinness is one of my staple beers. One of the more famous imports, this is consumed by cubic meters in Irish pubs. It is nice and smooth, with the darker malts providing a nice flavor that is goes down soft as black velvet. The nitro rocket is a neat little touch, but be careful opening the bottles, sometimes they overflow a little. This makes a great session beer, espically with pub food such as shepard's pie or chili.  Respect beer? Brilliant!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,NEhophead,3.14,"11.2 fl oz bottle with the 'rocket widget'. ""Drink straight from the bottle""?, not today.  Creamy, dense coffee colored head that lasts until the last sip. A condensed sheet of lacing with above average strength. Black in colorwith a dull mahogany hue.  Light coffee aromatics. Also a faint mustiness. Not too much in terms of smell.  Creamy light chocolate and espresso. A very present dry-roasted malt character. Moderate, yet smooth bitterness leading to a very dry finish.  Medium bodied; incredibly smooth with almost no carbonation present.  Very drinkable in terms of lightness on the palate, but the nitro bottle is not doing it for me. A much better beer on tap is an understatement. Back in the day, this one opened my eyes to actual beer versus macro-light-crap. Not nearly as exciting as it once was for me, but still an old favorite. This serving type though is extremely unappealing.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,bearrunner44,3.44,"Served on tap in the obligatory pint glass. When served properly, this is a glorious beer to look at. It's a very dark brown with a thick, creamy head. As I drank the beer, the sides of the glass were almost totally covered in foam. Between the color and the great lacing, this glass of Guinness is probably the best looking beer I've had so far. The taste is a letdown, though. The mouthfeel is very thin for a stout, and the aftertaste has a dry bitterness that seems artificial for some reason. Guinness is a nice alternative in places with a thin beer selection, but it's basically the Budweiser of the stout world.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,bark,2.83,"The colour is black with a tint of very dark wine red. The finger-thick compact foam (peculiar for nitro-tap beer) is off-white.  The smell is really weak with some metallic notes and a touch of black coffee.  The carbonation is mild, yet quite fresh making it very drinkable.  The taste is much milder than I remember; there is a bitter-sour touch and a burned taste of coffee and rubber bands. The dry aftertaste got some notes of bitter hops and burned malt.  This might be the most famous of them all, but there are some far better dry stouts out there",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Garin,3.79,"A typical nitro pour, it is nonetheless quite beautiful to watch the cascading sheets of bubbles as the deep black stout is revealed and the thick creamy head forms on top. I'm a sucker for a good gimmick.  Roasty black burnt aromas make it through the head. Slightly sweet maltiness starts it all out, with a hint of acidity in the middle, and a somewhat acrid burnt finish with a little bitter. The mouthfeel is very light, with that nitro creaminess throughout. I get an appley character building as I get through the pint.  It's a nice quaffable stout, light and refreshing. Maybe it's not breaking any new ground, but it fits my idea of what a dry stout should be quite well. Why have I not reviewed until today?  Perhaps I'll have another and see if I like it just as much as a second time.  Yep, I do.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The taste is very watery with some grainyness, roasted coffee and a slight astrigency in the back. chocolate notes and roasted barley bitterness have really been reduced in recent years. The mouthfeel is too watery with a fine soft fizz. This beer has definitely lost body in recent years.

209,754,bultrey,3.34,"Jeez, how many times have I quaffed a Guinness? And I've yet to review it... First off, the appearance of this beer trumps almost all others in existence. There's a reason -- it's a big selling point. The beautiful cascading head is pure art, that can't be denied. There is not much of an aroma, a faint roasty coffee bitterness, and a musty smell, like a basement. I think it has a very dry, slightly bitter, earthy flavor, with some minor notes of chocolate, and a strange sour twang that makes it a Guinness. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but not as full-bodied as the brewery would have you believe. The drinkability is relatively high -- it's a go-to session stout, and one can easily put away several pints in a night. This is what the entire Guinness empire is built upon.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Illini5596,3.69,"Perhaps the most drinkable and pleasing of the commonly available beers on tap at most restaurants and bars. Guinness manages to be pretty consistant, with an excellent appearance, dark and thick, with a vigorous head and the wonderful nitro cascade. The smell is just average, having little in the way of distinctive aromas, just a basic stout smell and a little less fragrant than some of the better stouts. The taste is well above average, nothing to write home about and not as creamy as I like my stouts, but there is a distinctive flavor of hops that is pleasing. The mouthfull is good and full, what you would expect of a stout. A very drinkable beer. Pretty much my staple in bars that don't have large selections of ""good"" beers.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

I always enjoy the warnigns to pour cold (as if the beer police will come for me if I dont).  The color and head were excellent. As usual, there was not much smell associated with the initial pour. The smooth feel in the mouth and the long finish are the best qualities and I find them to be superior in the can when compared to either of the bottled versions.  I know there are better stouts out there and I am told what we get in the states is a pale comparison to what you would find in Ireland but this will always remain a favorite.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

But last night I found myself in Boston with some time to kill and stumbled onto an Irish pub in Allston -- sorry, can't remember the name -- and was immediately lured in by the sight of several pint of frothy Guinness coming over the bar. I ordered one for me, and I swear it took longer to pour than it did for me to drink. I wound up having three of them, and enjoyed it as much as I have any beer in recent memory.  I'm amazed at people who say that Guinness is 'too heavy,' or 'too strong.' This is one of the easiest beers in the world to drink, and at only about 4% alcohol, you can drink plenty of them.

Appearance: Same great creamy looking head and leaves rings of lace all the way down ... the color is not as black as it used to be, its more of a very dark brown.

Taste: The tame roasted character is laughable, bitterness has been toned down and there is a mild cloying sweetness in the back.  Mouthfeel: Same nitro mouth feel but very, very thin and watery.  Drinkability: This beer has been dumbed down so much it is like drinking water. There are far better stouts than this.  This beer is an obvious victim of thinking about the $$$ and not the quality of the product.  There are rumors that the American product is kegged in the US from a combination of the ""Essence of Guinness"" (A product of Ireland) and the same malt base used in malternatives.

Many has been the time I've knocked back pints in the double digits of this black brew. Highest drinkability of any beer beccause its so damned smooth. Definately my favourite easily accessible beer, not enough I can say about Guinness Draught except that I need to try it in Ireland.

Nitro can into a British Imperial Pint Glass and it yeiled a dark near perfect black stout with a half-finer off-white head that was fed from the cascade and that lasted the entire length of the sample.  Smell was of dark caramel, nut, and coffee and it felt slightly less heavy on the palate than it does on tap. I little thin, certainly not watery but it left a weaker consistancy that I am used to on tap.  Taste also a little lacking from the tap. It was slightly more bitter but still lead to an enjoyable finish. Very dry to finish consistant with the style.  Very easy to drink. Although certainly not my favorite stout it makes a great classic fall back when the selection is nill and this is almost always a choice at most places in Boston both at the Bar and in the Store. It lacks a little in the nitro can as oppose to the tap, but still very easy to put a few of them down. IMO, a safe bet.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BeerBob,1,"Guinness Draught pours a midnight red from a 11.2oz black plastic with cream white trim, covered glass bottle. Head goes to well over two fingers and after the nitro settles out, leaves a frothy cap, that stays for ever.  Nose is of damp charcoal and nitrogen, mixed with whiffs of alcohol. Palate is a hops bitter, tempered by the nitro, leaving me wanting more, but getting less.  This brew is all show and no go, give me the malts, give me the hops, and give me the alcohol, the quaff of nitro does not empress me in the least.  I want the stout!!!  I have stoped drinking this stuff, I can't really call it ""Guinness"" any more.  I am also re-reviewing this stuff... It's going to be all 1's...

There's a nice roasted malt odor to be found but you got to search for it like its a goddamn easter egg.  This does not taste like any Guinness that I've ever had. Nutty, almost. There's a tiny bit of roasted malt up front, a little bit of bitterness at the back. It's too faint to be too complicated.  The mouthfeel is like fucking water. Ditch the widget, fellas. It ain't doing no good. I actually think this might be better straight out of the bottle.  I got this for Christmas. Thanks mom. It's ok, I guess. It came with a little mini CD ROM that shows those adorable little men from the commercials talking about famous plays in sports history. The disc was easily the best part of the package.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,redmosquito,3.74,"Nitro can, pours like cold creamed coffee. Massive brown cascading head with lasting power and lacing. Roasted coffee aroma with chocolate hints, and little hops. This is a bitter beer, smooth and roasted, it has a creamy aftertaste accented by the nitrogen. The body is thin even with the nitrogen, and leaves a coffee aftertaste. This is a good stout that others can be measured against.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,rousee,2.18,This is a shit beer. The only reason I even tried it was because it was on-sale at $1 a bottle at a place I didn't want to be at anyway. So I had one of these. I can't believe that the people who are in charge of importing Guinness into USA allow such a huge quality difference.  This beer is so bad that I won't honor it with much more of a review other than to say that these Guinness people ought to stick to know what they know best. Draft beer.  MF is crap. D is reasonably good. hate to trash a brewer but here I go.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Enygma,3.7,"Ah, good ol' Guinness. This is the beer I credit as starting me towards the better beers in life.  Appearance: This is the one part of this beer I think no one can complain about. Absolutely beautiful. Deep black with a thick and creamy head, and the cascading effect is absolutely magnificent.  Smell: I reall wasn't able to smell much from this one. Little hints of roastiness and maltiness. No hops. Certainly not an unpleasant smell, just not significant.  Taste: Very thin. Creamy with some nice coffee and roasted flavors. In fact, that's about all that's there. Tastes quite good, however not a strong taste in the least.  Mouthfeel: I personally enjoy the nitro mouthfeel. It's a bit then, but the creaminess and texture of the carbonation is distinct from the CO2 and a nice change of pace.  Drinkability: Fantastically drinkable beer. Love to go with these for a session, the ABV is relatively low at 4.2, so you can have a ton and not be in too bad of shape. Given an unlimited amount of free guinness in an evening, i'm not sure when I'd stop.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,theozag,4.27,"There's Guinness from the tap, Guinness from the can, and Guinness from the bottle. If you drink enough of the stuff, you'll come to understand - like I have - that the three sources provide three distinct variations on a theme. From the bottle is okay, from the nitro can is excellent, but from the tap... Guinness Draught can be divine. Which leads us to this review - the nitro can.  Pop the top and listen for the rush of the nitrogen as your Guiness goes through a process very similar to what happens when it's mixed at the tap. Pour and watch the brew tumble to a tar-black body crowned with a tawny brown head. Remember that head, because there's a very good chance it will outlast the rest of the beer.  If there's a ""chink in the armor"" for Guinness, it's the beer's smell. Some stouts have distinct aromas, but Guinness from the nitro can tends to have such a thick set of smells that nothing really comes through. Instead of actual smells, I'd tend to explain the aroma of canned Guinness in terms of weights. For example, one might call the smell of canned Guinness ten pounds of coffee and five pounds of chocolate in the bag for three pounds of gold. But maybe that's just me.  The taste of this beer is perfectly replicated from the tap to the can, as opposed to the bottle. Those of you who've only had tap and bottle will notice a considerable difference. Personally, I find the difference to be a little repulsive, so I was glad to find out that St James' Gate Brewery got it right in the nitro can. For those who no nothing of the taste of Guinness, I urge you not to take my word for it. Guinness is one of those beers you simply have to try for yourself, and if you like stouts or porters, I think you'll enjoy it.  Mouthfeel and drinkability are unbelievably smooth and satisfying. You might as well drink a small saucer of creme if you want to know how Guinness will feel going down.  If you've never tried an irish dry stout before, I think Guinness would be a great way to break into the style. Just be sure you have Guinness on its own before you branch out into black-and-tans or irish car bombs. To experience it properly, I think you have to start with the basics.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,orbitalr0x,3.61,"Pours a nice dark black with the classic cascading head...leaves a thick fluffy inch and a half head on top. I always enjoy the presentation of Guinness. Nice roasty nose with background hints of cocoa and coffee. A bit too subdued for me, but nice.  A good roasted, slightly burnt malt profile along with hints of coffee and slight notes of chocolate. A good irish stout that goes well with food.  Mouthfeel is creamy, however there is almost no carbonation. Goes down like water. I could have a few of these, but there are plenty other stouts that I'd go to first.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Shultzerdugen,2.35,"It feels blasphemous to be anything but awed by Guinness, but this product seems sub-par. Maybe the brewers decided looks are more important than taste. To disregard all other aspects, this is a beautiful beer. I poured it, though I'm not sure you're supposed to, and it did its usual thing with the cascading waterfall rising up the glass. Dark as night, hard to say a SRM for blackness. The smell was forshadowing of the lackluster performance of this Canadian imitation. This beer tasted and felt watered down. I gave a friend a drink and he said the same thing. Just a hint of the things I love about Guinness, its a shame.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Smells of light roasted barley, mild milk chocolate, and nitro cardboard. Tastes much the same. I like the complexity of the roasted/milk chocolate malt flavor. Combined with the creamy, silky, full-bodied mouthfeel, it makes for a tasty, yet subtlle beer. Better as it warms, and very drinkable.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,RushLimbmalt,5,"Some people love to hate Guinness. I think it is the best Irish Dry Stout that man has created. Pitch black with it's creamy tan head that never goes away... I dig nitro dispensed beers... The light aroma of dark malts is nice and mellow. The flavor is every bit as mellow. It is a sweet and has a bit of a roasted malt bite that dry's out the finish. The hops are indiscernible in the background, but that is fine for the style. It is as good in the draught can as it is on tap. I wonder if it really is better in Ireland, but I think the American/Canadian version is pretty good. With it's low alcohol content it is easy to drink all night long.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The taste didn't impress me either. Some coffee and chocolate and then a strong bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel was not all that great either, rather thin for such a dark beer. As for the drinkability; if this is the best beer that a bar serves, I'll be drinking rum and coke.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It isnt bad, however, if you are going to go for a guinness, the real one is far superior due to the temperature at which it is served.  Also best on tap in Ireland, I tried one in England and it didnt have the same flavor.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,jeshii,2.83,"As we poured the can, the beer was a uniform color of sand. As it settled, the bottom was a gorgeous black/brown, with a head the color and almost the consistency of cream. The head is a bit short (could be my novice pouring skills), but is definitely the best part of this beer. It is tenacious and tastes like whip cream. Carbonation was rather weak, and that seemed to lead to the fact that when held in the mouth, there seems to be almost no flavor at all. After that, the aroma is almost non-existent. Aside from the delicious cream, the only thing that stands out is the oppressive aftertaste. Without that, it would be a very average, drinkable beer. But, with that aftertaste, it makes you want to drink it fast, which is a shame.  Overall, enjoy the head, fear the aftertaste. Everything in between is unremarkable.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Anyway, have had it many a time in bottles/can/tap but they've been advertising this nitro can, so what the hell. Pours the same black with a thick creamy foam. Beautiful cascading head after it's poured. Smell, coffee and burnt chocolate. Taste is about the same - think day old french roast with alcohol. Mouthfeel, thinner than I remember the other forms, but it has been a while (and lots of beer since). I really expect more from a beer this dark. Drinkability - sure, if you think it will make you look cool, go ahead. The BAs know you're just a poser.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Taste/Mouthfeel - Faint toasted malt - VERY faint. No hop character to speak of. This tastes incredibly watered down, and I'm very surprised. All I ever heard is how ""rich and creamy"" Guinness is.

Not really bitter but more of a chocolate, grainy flavor going along with some creaminess.

If you talk to most people they will say, guinness shouldn't even be under a beer category, it should be a food. they are certainly right. You drink guinness like you would eat a meal. Its hearty and quite bitter, which is why i didn't give it a better score for drinkability. You can't just down guinness after guinness, that would be a horrible waste!   for best results drink from tap at a genuine Irish bar.

209,754,GClarkage,3.31,"Consumed in October 2004 at the Prince of Wales Pub in San Mateo, CA. The barkeep took forever to pour this brew. The head kept growing bigger and bigger and would not subside. It took literally 5 minutes from the time they started pouring to the time I actually got the beer in my hands. Needless to say, it was a nice pour. Looks pretty damn black and creamy. Smells of dark malt. Not a whole lot of coffee scent, just dark, burnt roasted malt. Taste is just ho-hum to me. A little coffee flavor and admitedly goes down very smooth. Served at room temp which was also nice for this kind of beer. Have had this beer many times before and I am just getting around to rating it. A good beer, but not a great one in my opinion. A good stand by though. A pretty drinkable beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Hibernator,4.13,"I had this out of a 14.9 oz tall can and served in a pint glass.  Jet black in appearance with a fluffy, off white head that sustains its form on top. Classic rushing and cascading mini bubbles form the structure of this beer as it settles from the widget induced can pour.  Aroma of roasted and smoked malts.  Taste is creamy and very, very smooth. Creamy and buttery up front with a nice dry finish. The dry finish works with a roasted malt presence. Think coffee flavored shake at room temp. Roasted coffee like bitterness also makes it way on the palate.  The Guinness draught can is so damn drinkable and quaffable. Very low in carbonation and its creamy flavor make this an easy beer to slam in minimal time. Without question, we all know Guinness is so much better from the tap, but this is a nice alternative. This beer doesn't have the complexity of the Guinness Foreign Stout, but is still very enjoyable.  The only ""negative"" to this beer is the low ABV%. It's like trying to drink light beers and getting a nice buzz on...it's a difficult task. On the other hand, this makes the perfect session beer on tap at my local Irish pub.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,Thrasher,3.18,"I've just written a review for the nitro bottle and here is the nitro can comparative review. I prefer the bottle, for various reasons, and the can has always been a disappointment to me. When I've wanted a nitro-can Irish stout, I've always found Beamish to be a superior choice (although I prefer Guinness on draft at a pub).  Having said that, I discover the beer pours with distinction, a rich, deep brown with a band of solid cream atop. Off a can pour, the top of the head is a bit ragged and jagged, not as smooth as a perfectly poured pint. The aroma is muted but some traditional Guinness elements are in evidence. The flavor itself is similary obscured, perhaps by the nitro can technology, or it could be an older sample. Still, some roasty and creamy Guinness flavors pull through. On the whole, the beer is a bit grassier, perhaps, without as much of the complicated and subtle hop flavors -- more of a prickly bite. The finish is similarly misaligned, and a lingering sourness is out of place. The mouthfeel is not as seductive. Not as high scores as I gave the nitro bottle; actually, I was surprised by how badly the can fared in direct comparison.  I suppose I should complete this trilogy, and go to a bar to review a pint from the keg, but I seriously doubt that will happen anytime soon.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,jvajda,3.95,"Appearance: I was instructed to drink it from the bottle, but it looked very dark with a good head. Smell: Good and crisp. Taste: Light roasted stout flavors. Decent bitterness.

209,754,baugherlager,4.08,"Okay the first time I had this beer I wasn't super impressed but I was impressed enough to buy it again. Now I really have acquired a taste for this stuff.  I have had guinness draught in bottles, cans, and on tap. If you can get it on tap it is of course the best but the cans aren't bad.  I love the way this beer looks after it has been poured correctly. It pours very dark almost black. The nitro cascades down as a rich creamy milky head forms about a fingers width.  The smell is unique to this beer. It smells slightly sour with husky grains and coffee.  The taste is similar, tastes sour on the palate but as it warms in the mouth you can taste more of the goodness that is Guinness. It has husky grains taste with coffee, and and another taste that reminds me of cranberries. Mouthfell is slightly thinner than expected but I don't really know why people can't drink more than 2 at a setting. I do think this beer is an acquired taste for most people. This is truly a unique beer in most ways.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,baiser,3.27,"I have to admit, that I didn't follow the instructions and drink from the bottle. I still poured it out, hence the appearance marks are still up.  This bottled version has almost no aroma. Slight roastedness.  Taste...just wasn't the same as on tap. Seemed a little more watery. Still that classic guinness taste, but just a lot less. Lacked the smooth and creaminess too. This beer is just not meant to be had in a bottle.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BuckeyeNation,1.93,"Despite the fact that the plastic label beseeches me to 'drink straight from the bottle' and to 'serve extra cold', I will do neither. This will be at my beer fridge temperature of 50 degrees and will be poured into a nonick pint glass. I don't take orders from beer bottles. I'm also chagrined to discover that it checks in at less than 10 carbs (9.9 to be exact). That is what is commonly known as a red flag.  I get the usual nitro cascade effect on the pour, though it seems to be less impressive than what I see from the average nitro can. When the show is over--no more than 15 seconds--I'm left with an opaque, dark brown liquid crowned by a slim finger of heavily creamy, grayish brown foam. The nose is meek and is of roasted malt, chocolate and coffee in roughly equal proportions. Not bad, not great.  Guinness Draught tastes like watered-down Guinness Extra Stout. I mean that literally. It seems less like a weak stout (that was brewed as such) and more like water was added before bottling. What flavor I can discern is of lightly roasted dark malt and weak iced coffee with very little chocolatiness at all. The finish is nonexistent because there's very little flavor to begin with. The body/mouthfeel is, again, watery in the extreme.  Guinness Draught is one of the wimpiest stouts that I've ever had. It challenges my taste buds about as much as kindergarten final exams would challenge my intellect. It may have been a slightly better experience if I had sampled it straight from the bottle, but any beer that has to rely on a gimmick such as that gets no respect from me. This is a beer that doesn't deserve to be taken seriously. Next.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,dren,4.03,I have had the chance to drink Guinness on tap in Ireland and let me tell you it is better than the Guinness you find on tap here in the states. It is also much better than the rocket bottle and the can. In Ireland it is a science on how the perfect Guinness pint is poured. When done correctly you are left with a creamy half inch or so thick head that is just as enjoyable to drink as the rest of the beer. It goes down smoothly consisting of rich coffee and chocolate flavors. I highly recommend this beer.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,RedwoodGeorge,3.31,"Appearance - beer poured a nice dark brown as one would expect from a stout but the head was thin, closer to white than tan and disappeared rather quickly leaving no lacing.  Smell - pretty weak. There are the expected stout notes of roasted grain but not terribly strong.  Taste - good enough. It has the nice bitter notes of browned malt along with a smooth creamy note. Much less strong than most stouts, this is the type of thing you'd give a neophyte to avoid scaring them off the style.  Mouthfeel - surprisingly disappointing. This brew has all the body of Miller Lite. The cognitive dissonance between the look of the glass (dark, rich stout) and the feel of what was in your mouth (soft, fuzzy water) was disturbing.  Drinkability - If you're looking for a stout, search elsewhere (Guinness Original perhaps?). If you're looking for a light, airy stout-esque kiddy drink, this may be for you. While I could pack away quite a few of these without filling up, I could say the same for Perrier and that wouldn't make it a good brew. I guess if I'm having a very light meal and don't want the beer interfering with my palate this may be appropriate but I'm not really looking for a good stout to go along with my salad.  Frankly, I'm disappointed with this brew and I'm not looking forward to finishing off the rest of the four-pack. Stouts and porters are my favorite style and I've been a fan of Guinness Original for a number of decades. To me this doesn't come close to the experience of Guinness on tap - with one exception - it is much more creamy than the bottled Guinness Original. I'd only recommend this to someone who was interested in trying a stout for the first time but was normally a Bud Lite drinker with lite taste buds...  ---===---  On reconsideration after having a few more of these, I've got to recant much of what was said here. While it was surprising to find a lighter bodied stout than expected, there have been quite a few times when I've been looking forward to and even craving that can of nitro-fuzzy goodness in the fridge. It's still light bodied, but it is smoooth and when that's what you're looking for, the Nitro-Guinness delivers!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,Mitchster,4.33,"Ah, Guinness. The stuff of legends. Pours out to a very dark brown, forming a large creamy meringue head of light tan soapy bubbles (aka milk microfroth for the espresso crowd), with the nitro cascade effect that makes this brew look so cool. Retention and lacing are awesome. Carbonation is mild. Aroma is trademark...a little bit of almonds, a touch of diacetyl, mild dark roasted malts, vanilla, and a touch of sour milk. Mouthfeel is very mild and smooth as liquid velvet with a lightly dry finish and medium-light body. Taste begins with a touch of Irish yeast and diacetyl, followed by a brief sourness and a light acidity, dark roasted malts with no substantial malt sweetness, black patent and roasted barley astringency, and ending with a very mild non-descript bitterness. Cleanly fermented, alcohol is imperceptable. Easy to drink owing to the nitro and low alcohol.  A classic who's legacy can't be refuted. The bread and butter of the beer world.

Aroma is also Guiness but the temperature its poured is so cold that it seems to restrain some of the nuttier aspects of the roasted flavors. Flavor is Ok, but whatver they have done seems to have really muted that classic Guinness sharpness. The fact that is ws poured in less than a minute should have tipped me off that was not going to be a good experience. Mouthfeel is OK but again it just lost some of the edge that I think a good Guiness should have. I enjoy it cold in Ireland but this is just too cold.

209,754,bigone4,3.83,Well Guinness is a well liked stout all over the world and it obviously rules bars during St. Patrick's day. I was lucky enough to travel over to Ireland last summer and take a tour of this great brewery. Much history goes into this brew. Smooth taste with a great head that coats the glass with a tasty film. Guinness is very enjoyable and is usually used by many people to compair other stouts. It has a great color black almost dark ruby if held to a light. It really is good to drink and it can fill you up. It does have a rather low ABV which many people don't care but I like stouts with a little more to them. In conclusion the brewery is great and the beer is decent. Drinking it on the top floor of the observation deck in the brewery over looking Dublin is a great experience.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It was great to see how the fine white bubbles came from the lower part of the glass to form the head.The smell shows dark malts, a nice roasted coffee aroma, coffee beans, and almost some smoke. The taste is of coffee and chocolate, with some roasted notes and hints of smoke; a deep chocolate like bitterness. The mouthfeel is terrible. Weak, watery. You can't even get the creamy head, it remains in the glass. The mouthfeel makes me not wanna drink this beer again.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,foamyhead,3.09,"Very dark reddish colour. extremely smooth and rich beige, light brown foam with small bubbles. It lasts all the way to the bottom  it smells of dark roast coffee, a rather light smell though  It has a light darkburned taste, like instant coffee.  The mouthfeel is pretty smooth, but for my tastebuds much too light for a stout.  It has a nice foam, and is ok refreshing, but definitely nothing special. The Nigerian Guinness Foreign Extra is a much richer, more complex and satisfying brew to me.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,DrJay,3.38,"Dense, creamy, light brown head on top of black beer with deep red highlights. The aroma was slightly sharp, with a light roasted smell. It had a light bitterness and strong roasted barley flavour, with some sourness in the mix, producing a dry finish. Not much in the way of malt sweetness. Very lightly carbonated and very smooth, but the light body leaves it a little thin. Head retention was great, with plenty left over at the end of the pint and thick lace down the sides of the glass.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Dithyramb,3.21,"Appearance Poured from the new rocket-widget bottle to a glass, despite the instructions not to. Poured a dense black color. Used my new towel to catch any errant overpour. The classic cascading look with a frothy tannish white head. Surprisingly had incredible head retention and great lacing throughout. Nice new packaging on the bottle (has directions to serve cold??)  Smell  French roast coffee smells. None of the chocolate and/or malty tones Im used to in the draft version. Hopefully will still be nice and malty.  Taste  Dry and bitter on the front end, with some quick sweeter aftertones. Guinness is much creamier, sweeter and maltier on tap.  Mouthfeel  Almost too smooth and almost watery. Bitter roasted flavors dont linger on the tongue or the mouth. I thought this was a sweet stout?  Drinkability  Definitely drinkable, since it goes down smooth and light.. Tried it over the weekend at a place that only offered  Overall Kudos to Guiness for trying a different market segment. Who knows, maybe it will stick, and get more people to drink the beer. Im not sure if it is the bottle version here, with the rocket-widget, or if it is just my new imperial stout kick, but it seemed weak overall.  Not a horrible beer, but not much better than average. A lot of bars are keeping this and Sam Adams as their good beers. Given the choice between this, and Mic Ultra, Im definitely going for the widget bottle. The flavor is much different than the traditional tap. I thought the can had the same problems too.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,EPseja,4.76,"What can I say? When you get a properly poured pint of Guinness, there is really not much more to say than slainte! Whether or not your local bar makes a shamrock on the head of your Guinness, there are a few things to look for in a perfect pint.  First, it should be poured in two stages. The barkeep should pull 2/3 of a pint, and let it completely settle. After a minute or so, the final third should be pulled *slowly* to make the head form correctly. The height of the light cocoa-brown head shold be between 3/4"" and 1"" in total, the top 1/3 of which should rise above the rim of the glass.  A good pint of Guinness should have a faint scent of sweet toasted malt and not much else. Too much scent indicates that it's being served too warm. Too little, and it's too cold. Other scents may indicate a stale keg or an unclean glass.  The color of a Guinness is black in the glass from a foot away. If you hold up the pint against a bright light source (perhaps a crackling fire), it will be seen to have a faint transparency with a dark crystal ruby color, much like a tawny Port would possess when viewed from a distance.  And then the drink... A perfect pint of Guinness (in my observation) will taste malty, slightly toasty, faintly smoky, refreshing without being chilly, and very well rounded with no sharpness. It's low carbonation will allow you to draw in the entire first 1/3 of the pint without stopping (which I like to do with my first pint especially after the anticipation during the pour). It's lingering aftertaste is sweet and makes you want to have another mouthful.  Lastly, and contrary to many people's beliefs, a good pint of Guinness should not leave you bloated and/or full.  The process and understanding behind a properly poured Guinness can be very Zenlike. It is an excellent choice for those who are looking for some solace from the everyday world or perhaps relax and have some good times amongst friends and family.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,mobyfann,3.67,"This was the first beer I truly noticed a difference when poured, it pours a very dark brown base with a beautiful light chocolate colored head that keeps form for the duration. The smell however was the low point of the beer where smells of coffee and chocolate are there but hard to find.  The taste is pretty light but a very smooth and slightly bitter texture. I recommend this as a dessert or dinner beer. The mouthfeel and drinkability are both outstanding, maybe a little too light in the mouth. Always feels great and could drink this till I die.  A staple in the refrigerator.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,JohnW,3.9,"Guiness of draught in England varies considerably from pub to pub, and a lot has to be said for the way it is poured and kept. If it is not a popular drink in a bar, then don't touch it...it could be flat and sour. They always say draught Guiness tastes better in Ireland, but it's probably more to do with the way it is poured than the beer itself. Somehow I do not think they brew a special Guiness just for the Irish bars ! I enjoy the dark mysterious appearance and creamy head that you can draw faces in, the very burnt malt and hops taste that lingers, though, as others have said, the finish can seem a bit thin. If it is served too cold, then you loose some of its subtle overtones. I enjoy one or two pints of Guiness, but more than that and you can have trouble in the morning!!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Phyl21ca,3.53,Nitro can: Poured a dark black beer with a nice foamy head with ultra long retention due to the nitro ball.

209,754,mattcrill,3.31,"I have a hard time not being biased towards this beer. This was the first beer that got me started being a BA. That being said, there are many stouts that far surpass this one. It pours dark black with the cascading foam that's hard to beat. Not much in the smell department but it does smell like good ol' Guinness. I really enjoy the taste although a little on the dry and on the boring side. Easy for me to drink a yit-load of these though.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,ppoitras,3.56,"Enjoyed at Uno's, Milford, CT, presented in a 11.2 bottle, and a frosted glass.  Usual impressive Guinness nitro head and bubble action, with great lacing. Not much in the aroma department, just a bit of dark grains and that ""Guinness"" smell, which I stumble trying to put into words. Taste was as expected from a nitro, somewhat deadened, but still a presence, for sure. Mouthfeel was the usual good nitro, and drinkability was excellent. Just don't know about their suggestion to drink it from the bottle, I'll take a glass, thanks.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,HTX,2.38,"As far as stouts go, this is the bottom of the barrel. If you want a good stout, go out and find one, but don't settle for this one.  Its smell and appearance are very dark and thick, but the taste is something that most stouts would not be proud of. Its too thin, and runs in your mouth like water.  And to the people at Guinness, PLEASE make your Guinness on tap not foam so damn much. The bartenders spend 5 minutes scooping and repouring and it just makes it even flatter and gives the nitrogen too long to sit.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,PopeJonPaul,3.82,"First of all, I can't help but love the appearance of this beer. The black (with a deep, deep, barely noticable ruby color if you look at it right) and vanilla-white contrast is perfect. The smell though has always bugged me a little, the sour yeastiness makes me think of the old half-full cream container you end up finding in the back of your fridge.  Tasty creamy roasted malt flavor with coffee overtones. Ultra smooth, goes down fast. Like margaritas, there's hardly an alcohol in 'em and you'll have to put plenty down to fall off your barstool. Though the drinkability drops a bit with the ""meal in a glass"" feel, a Guinness pint only has 210 calories. But, if it takes 6 to make you happy, well, there's your calories. All in all, the more stouts I try the farther this creeps down my list of favorites, but still good stuff, and a great ""old standby"" in NYC where it's always on tap, even if you're stuck in a sh*thole.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Hunter,4.2,"Lovely stuff, this. Pitch black in color, with a tan head. The nitro widget does an admirable job of replicating the cacading bubbles of a tap pour. Nice aroma of coffee and chocolate, and it comes through in the taste as well. It can be a little bland, but that's not necessarily a bad thing if you're looking for a mellow stout to knock back without needing a spoon. Mouthfeel is absolute satin. Some make a big deal about this not being genuine Guinness, or not up to a pub draw. I say let 'em, if it means there's more of it lying about for me. No point in being snobbish about what is essentially a good, light, utterly drinkable stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,MobBarley,3.08,"Nitro boost creates an aesthetically perfect beer that I won't describe as it has already been done ad nauseum. Smell is all roasted malts. Taste is slightly burnt malt in abundance with a hint of hops for balance. Mouthfeel is thin for a stout, and I've honestly had Browns with more body. Drinkability is decent but boring. A one-dimensional that may be representative of the fact that it was imported. Honestly though, Black Butte Porter is a stouter beer than this. Stout for people who like the idea of drinking stout, but not real stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

I was up in Hell's Kitchen for Halloween and my buddy took me to this place Scruffy Duffy's (coolest damn sports bar ever, check it out if your ever in NY) and wouldn't let me order anything until I tried a Guinness on tap. I must say I was very surprised. Dark and smooth, almost coffee like. Then I saw the ABV, 4.1%, with that kinda ABV I could drink this stuff all day!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Very very smooth, minimal roasted character. Mouthfeel is creamy and not overbearing. Very drinkable and i had forgotten how enjoyable a Guinness can be. Might have rated higher if it wasn't brought to my table accompanied by a totally frozen lager mug. I will never learn about buying beer in restaurants. I politely told the waitress that this was totally inappropriate and to bring me another glass. All they had was mugs for beer. I stooped caring and took one that wasn't frozen. Wrecked the ambience of the brew. Any how, this is a stout i'm not going to ignore any more. A solid stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,chriscolby,3.99,"What can I say about Guinness that hasn't been said a billion times before? Obviously, the cascade of bubbles in the glass is mouthwateringly inviting. The primary aroma and flavor is that of dark roasted malts, but it's the dry, creamy mouthfeel that makes this more than your average ale.  Guinness needs to be fresh, or it can be terrible; but these days it seems easier to find fresh sources than ""back in the day."" I know it's popular to believe that Guinness varies a lot depending on where it's brewed, but I'm not sure if I believe this. (I'm not saying I actively disbelieve it, either.) There's a huge potential for self-delusion here.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,crackerpooch,3.86,"The quintessential dry stout. This review is on a 14.5oz can of Guinness Draught. This beer is just beautiful when poured into a glass. Two finger light brown head that is very creamy. The head hardly diminishes at all throughout the entire drink session. The beer is dark chocolate brown in color and is completely opaque.  This beer has a very light roasted coffee aroma. The taste also very light and has no sweetness. Just a slightly bitter roasted taste. Smooth as silk with a very creamy mouthfeel. For some reason, I just dont like the mouthfeel of nitrogen charged beers. This beer surprises in that it looks heavy and full of flavor, but the taste and aroma are both very subdued. Quite a difference from an imperial stout. Im not a big fan of this beer, but how can I review it poorly when it is the original dry stout? I mean, its the gold standard for this style of beer.  A very smooth, creamy and easy to drink beer that suits its style to a tee.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,JustinBathurst,2.88,"Okay, well, Guinness looks great when poured. The head is just perfect--a creamy off-white about a centimeter high.  Mouthfeel is kind of chalky and veering towards a strange paste when it mixes with the head. Hmm.  Taste is quite roasted and there is a prominent copper bitter. Reminds me of the chalk stuff you have to drink at the doctor...  Not a bad brew, just average.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,hobbes2112,4.23,"What can I say, this is the beer that started it all.  A dark dream of a beer, black enough to suck in all light around it, and then seems to refocus this light in the pristine small bubble head. Having a nitro kegorator in college just for Guinness was NOT overkill.  Low alcohol lets you really knock these back, mix in a corned beef sandwhich and it is heaven.  You get a mix of head and beer in every mouthful, but makes for a very creamy experience. I love nitro taps!  The taste is not pushing the envelope, but you get your little bitter fix in all the creamy goodness.  Some beers are more appropriate at times, but Guinness is always ready to step up to the plate.  Edit:I've got to knock the taste from a 5 down to a 4. Either this beer is changing or my tastes are drastically different now. Still good...but not close to perfect.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

What taste there is, is of burnt barley and not much else. Dry and unpleasant. The mouthful is ok, like waterd down cream, with it's low carbonation.  I think that Guinness is where a lot of people are turned off by dark beers. I'd take it over a budmillercoors, but if there were a decent stout or porter around, I'd leave this for someone else.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Appearance is a light translucent brown, and seeing as how i took the advice of the bottle and drank straight from it, i couldnt tell you any more than that, save for the fact that it kept foaming over the top. Smell is mettalic and wheaty, with some meaty protein hints but not very much complexity at all. Taste is about the same, with a bitter metallic taste, but its clearly not from hops. Tastes kind of earthy, with some wheat and malt in there. Mouthfeel is thicker than most other macros, as would be expected, and there is little carbonation, which combines to make it feel like youre drinking foamy milk. Its an ok choice if you want something a step above regular macro, but not really a good choice if you want a real stout. I hear the Guinness Extra Stout is better though...",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The taste is a bit of the roasted malt, not very strong at all. Mouthfeel, despite the nitro, seems a bit thin. As for drinkability, well, could have a few of them, especially with the low ABV.  Well, I have to say that one of my favorite parts of beer is the lovely Guinness cascade, which the nitro can didn't do very well. Guinness may have been the first ""dark beer"" I ever had, but I can tell that I've outgrown it, as this just doesn't have the bite that most other stouts do. It's a good fallback beer, especially at bars that don't have much else, but I wouldn't go looking for it (not that I have to, of course).",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It's got a hint of sour on top of its mild bitterness.  More than anything else, it's uniquely Guinness. It's not as special as some have made it out to be, but it's definitely still a good beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Edwin,3.48,"Served in one of the nitro ""rocket-widget"" bottles.  Appearance - I poured this out into a glass, despite the instructions on the bottle to not pour it out. Pours initially tan with that ""snowfall"" effect while it settles. A head that reminds me of chocolate milk, and it stays on top a good while. Mostly dark brown body with an amber/ruby tinge when held to the light.  Smell - A roasty, coffee-like smell with possibly a hop hint left in there. No chocolaty smells in there, which is surprising. Smells kinda thin for a stout.  Taste - Bitter with emphasis on the coffee flavors. A wee bit of a nut flavor comes through, but nothing to write home about. Again, the flavor is kind of thin for a stout. Not bad, but not great.  Mouthfeel - Very unassuming on the tongue. Slips by without any real imposition. Almost watery/light.  Drinkability - Yeah, it is drinkable, but if you are looking for a true stout, this won't get you too revved up.  Overall - This is a let-down for a stout. If you are looking for a true, full-bodied stout/beer, pass this by and go for a non-macro version. This is a very so-so brew.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Guinness Draught pours a dark coffee black with a creamy, frothy tan head that did not subside through drinking, the head alone will leave you breathless. The lacing on the glass is incredible, you literally can't see the glass because it is covered by frothy lacing. The smell is of roasted malts with hints of mocha. The taste is very suprising, as I didn't like the Extra Stout offering from Guinness, this version is incredible, dark mocha flavors and caramel tones will bounce off the tongue, suprisingly refreshing. Feels very full and dry in the mouth. A very drinkable stout, probably the most drinkable for me, not to rich, nor to light, but my god the head.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,FormatKid,3.49,"Picked up a four pack of nitro-cans from my local Bi-Lo. I figured its about time I try a nitro-can of something.  I really enjoyed the pour on this one. I can hear the can gurgling and groaning as I open it. The experience was pretty authentic as far as I can tell (sans tap), cascading bubbles and all. Its very pretty to look at, a deep, opaque, chocolately brown. The bubbles cascading down in sheets, give it a very textured, attractive look. Ultrafine, creamy as steamed milk head coalesces at the top a nice finger and a half and hangs around rather well. Creamy lace clings to the glass in gobs.  The smell is light, and mildly roasty and chocolately. Malts smell nice and hops are almost imperceptible to my nose.  As the head touches my nose on the first sip Im reminded of a chocolate milk-shake. Taste is light and changes very little from the front of my tongue to the back. Sweet, roasty malts slide across my tongue and an extremely faint bitter aftertaste is left behind. Its hard to put together the words Creamy, and Watery, when it comes to mouthfeel but thats the best way I can think to describe this. Goes down very easily.  Well, this is too watery for me to think that strongly of it as a Stout, but its a refreshing drink and the nitro-can adds something to the experience. Im sure Ill be drinking this again as its the dankest option in many bars/restaurants.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Nice and black. Nice creamy head. No hop aroma. Taste is surprisingly... absent? The nitro kills what flavor there might have been. I try to hallucinate some roasted grains or burnt grains, and I get a tiny whiff. There is a minimal hop bitterness. The worst part is that it is so darn thin. I was struck by the fact that it tasted like water after the moderate bodied pale ale I had just before. It made for a great teaching point for my newbie friends, though. They were so surprised at how thin and light the Guinness was. ""Guinness is like a meal"" my ass.

And yet this is the first time I've paid close attention to it.  No aroma. Very little carbonation. A nice, creamy texture. But as I drink I note sour hops, a slightly burnt, yet syrupy malt.

There are many nitro beers available but Guinness is the most famous. The cascading bubbles are beautiful and the head retention is and consistency is second to none. Pair this with a dark ruby colour and Guinness may be the nicest beer to look at.  Guinness is also a very smooth beer. The mouth feel is creamy but with a low specific gravity and caloric value, this beer also feels light on the stomach. It is certainly easy to drink and makes a good session beer. The taste, although much better than a typical macro is a little on the watery side when compared to other stouts.

The bubbling brown body of the pour eventually cascading into the familar ""Black"". Topped by a finger plus of firm, table top smooth light tan cream.  A deep roasty nose rises up, wth notes of coffee. Not as soulful as I would like, but so familar.  The roasty malt slides across the tongue, with notes of coffee and chocolate. A mild sheath of hops along for the ride. The nitro coats it all though, and buries the extremes. There are no edges to be found.  Mouthfeel is of course creamy. This is the milk shake of beer.  Drinkability is extreme. This is one of the world's oldest and truest session beers.  This is a hard beer to look at objectively. I'm an Irish-American. This was the first beer I ever had wasn't a ""fizzy yellow American Lager"". At least in the can, it may have lost something. Is it thinner? Too smooth? Not roasty enough?

209,754,SilentSabre,4.42,"Guinness. Some people just love Guinness, like myself. Others cringe at its very mention. But that's the thing about Guinness. There seems to be no middle ground. People love it, or think it's the most vile, disgusting thing in the world. Guinness pours an extremely dark brown and depending on the lighting, can appear to be black. After you pour it, watch it through the sides of the glass. It looks like a waterfall. Not quite sure what causes this to happen, but it's quite interesting to watch. The smell of Guinness is unlike any other. Charred. Roasted. Chocolate. Coffee. These are just a handful of words that come to mind when I smell a Guinness, and the taste, too, could accompany these words. The mouth feel is smooth as silk, as there seems to be a negligible amount of carbonation in Guinness. Also, to be as dark as it is, Guinness is very easy to drink. I typically don't buy Guinness because of the tremendous variety of other things I buy instead, but at least on St. Pat's, I gotta have some Guinness!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

I must say, while reviews range from all ends of the spectrum concerning the quality and standards of this beer and it's company, damn, it is always cool to watch the pour. The cascade and the head, it is a truely unique thing to watch  So we have the unique pour, the thich creamy tan head, and, the drak rich color of the beer. Smells very ""roasted"", with hints of coffee. Now for the taste..it has a nice dry roasted taste, but it is satisfying. It is somewhat light in taste, smooth, somewhat sweet, but still rather light. No, this is by no means the best stout every had, or made. But to many, this was one of their stepping stones, and still holds true in the hearts, which is what really matter.

I especially enjoy the pad of brown foam that follows the liquid as it is drained from the pint. Fine lacing. There's also something special about the heft of a Guinness.  The smell is lacking, plain wetness comes to mind--just a wet beer.  The taste of Guinness is also good, but not great. It's sweet, with roasted grains lightly present. Good hop dryness. That said, it's quite light and lacking flavor. I'd also like a little higher alcohol...  The mouthfeel is weak, but the sensation of one's lips hitting the rubber-like foam and then experiencing the cooler, smooth Guinness liquid slide makes it memorable. Drinkability is excellent, exceptional.  Guinness on St. Patty's Day, on-tap at Slainte.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Jacobier10,4.36,"Enjoying a Guinness on St. Patty's Day, is there anything better?!?!  I love the sound the nitro can makes when opened. Pours black/brown with a tan head, but then the brown magically rushes to the bottom and the black rises until it's as dark as midnight. The head is dark tan and remains there throughout the course of the entire beer. You can smell the roasted malts and taste them even more! Incredibly smooth with a delicious aftertaste, but very filling. You gotta love this beer.  I've had this beer on tap, out of the can, and out of the bottle. Obviously the tap dominates, but the nitro-can is a close second. As for the bottle, don't waste your time...The can is where it's at!  **Edit** (3/17/06) - Two years since my initial review and I enjoy Guinness even more than i used to. As my palate becomes more trained towards different feels and flavors, I have found that I really enjoy Guinness Draught. The appearance and mouthfeel are superior, second to none...Truly a unique creation and highly enjoyable.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Foxman,3.71,"It pours a dark, opaque brown that might just as well be black. The starkly contrasted whitish head swells strongly up to multiple fingers, then drops very slowly as the cascade usurps its energy. Lacing runs wild inside the glass.  The aroma is thinner than the appearance might suggest, with dark roasted malt coming off as top dog but certainly not strong. Bitter burnt chocolate notes swirl about a black coffee undercurrent, until a very indistinct hops quality mellows out the finish.  The flavor too is a bit less assertive than one might expect, with the same dark, roasted malt edge cutting in, but without much of a real edge. Dark chocolate bitterness wields a the big stick in the middle, but allows a bit of burnt sugar to creep through as well. The bite of coffee plays off the bitterness of hops at the finish, leading to a gentle fade of both. Overall, a nice stout balance, but without much real muscle.  A sight heavier than medium bodied, it has a mouth-filling, dense creaminess that impresses, and it leaves a nice hoppy glow as a legacy.  This is a case of my palate being upgraded by many of the stouts I've sampled in the years since I last had one of these. Standing alone, it's still one of the most drinkable examples of the style out there, but in comparison to some others, I realize that in some ways it pales. I have to say, it's certainly a classic, but it's something like a starter beer in the wide world of available stouts. But please, understand that I'd never say no to one of these. Often it's the best available on tap at a given establishment, and I'll order one gladly. It's just that it's no longer the one I think of when I want to go this route. Goes to show you, nothing lasts forever, no matter the marketing.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Bierguy5,3.81,"Pours a tan liquid that compares to chocolate milk at first. There is something hypnotic about watching the beer cascade into a jet black liquid with a wonderful tan thick creamy head. To me, the head on this is the best of almost any beer, and has a unique look. Smells slightly of coffee, almost a burnt smell. Taste is a good roasted coffee flavor, with a hint of chocolate. Feels a little thin for what I would like. I do find this to be very drinkable. Many people trash this beer now. I understand that it doesn't taste as it once did, and what get in the US (from Canada) is almost an insult. Still, I find myself coming back to this beer now and again.

All I get in the nose is a bit of malt. Taste is pure roasted and burnt maltiness. Coffee upfront and a hint of vanilla. Sublime and subtle. Chalky, bitter hops arrive next on the tongue. Mouthfeel is luscious and smooth. More malt and hops in a fine long finish.

Lacing coats the glass very well in broken sheets. Smell is lightly roasty and chocolatey with a subdued dryness and sweetness of soft bread. Taste yields about the same as what the smell delivers with a slight roasy tone of malts the whole way through and dotting the mix along the way is a soft soggy breadiness thats a bit sweet, chocolate lightly appears with a subdued dryness in the finish. Overall, nothing to strong or lengthy in flavors. Feel is lightly smooth and kinda fluffy with a slight drying finish. It had been a while since the last time I'd had a Guinness in any form, the last being nitro-tap which wasn't very forthcoming, well now I remember why I don't order it on either tap or nitro.

Not a bad beer by any means.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Less aroma than I recall in other forms of Guinness. Some hint of the chocolaty malts.  A full taste with a nice balance of sweet and bitter.  A mouthfeel that appeals to me personally, although it disappears quickly.

The smell of this beer is not too strong, some faint notes of roasted malts is all i can perceive. The taste is very plain, this beer simply doesn't taste like much which i believe is do to the nitro. The flavors I do get are those of coffee balanced by a little bit of chocolate. The nitro does make this beer extremely creamy and the drinkability is high as this beer doesn't fatigue the palate.

209,754,99bottles,3.84,"I just realized that I never reviewed Guinness. So, after quaffing one at happy hour, I shall give my review. Guinness looks better than any beer out there, especially when someone pours it right off the nitro-tap. Deep brown with a lively white head that settles so tightly, its spooky. I don't know why I'm describing the look of Guinness. You know what it looks like. Neat.  Ok, but as for taste. Guinness is a little thin in the mouth, and though it has the stout flavors of coffee and light choco, it really doesn't ripple with flavor like an imperial stout would. So, on its own it's really not that great. But then again, there's nothing quite like sitting in a pub and throwing pint after pint of Guinness back with your best pals. The posters are great bar deco also. So, yeah. Thin, burnt malt, tiny little bitter hop character, and a big ole cream like head. Maybe the world's most distributed beer, and what I'll take when I run into a dive that has 4 taps - 2 buds, a coors, and this. Good for Guinness.    PS - I hate non beer drinkers who say, ""Guinness is like a meal"". Ooo, that gets me. Just because it's not transparent and tasteless like a macro, all of a sudden, it's too heavy. It's ABV is less than most macros !! damn !! Have a pint of barleywine and tell me about meals. Ok. Sorry about that.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Zorro,2.39,"""Drink From Bottle"" What the hell? I poured mine in a Guinness glass anyway.  Pours a black brew with a thick tan head.  Smells a bit like chocolate and coffee, mild sweet smell.  Taste is watery, mild sweetness is there. Slight chocolate and coffee flavors, really too mild in taste. Slight bitterness in the finish.  Watery Mouthfeel.  Drinkable, I guess but just a really inferior Stout. Every other stout I have tried is better, sad really.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,RasputinsRevenge,4.63,"Ahh, Guinness. What is there to say about Guinness that hasn't already been said. Well, here's my 2 cents anyways.  Guinness is an opaque beer that can often times be intimidating to those who have never tried it. If you haven't, I would say try the nitro can or on nitro-tap before trying the Guinness Extra Stout, as it is smoother. Guinness is sometimes perceived as thick, syrupy, or heavy. As well as referred to as ""motor oil"" by those who would rather down a case of [insert macrobrew here] Light, than try a ""real"" beer.  Once you take the plunge and try it, I think you may be surprised to find out that none of the above descriptions are true. Everyone's individual tastes vary, and it's possible that you may not like this even after giving it a fair chance. However, don't avoid Guinness simply because you believe the stereotypes.  Anyways, back to the beer. As far as taste goes, there is definately a ""burnt"" or coffee-like taste but I would in no way characterize it as such. Those tastes don't, in my opinion, dominate, and make the taste over-powering. I've run into a few instances where I've ordered it on tap, and it has a somewhat ""metallic"" taste (perhaps the beer was not as fresh as it could be), but overall this should not occur often.  Also, technically this review refers to the nitro can version, but if you've never tried it before, I would recommend getting it on tap from a place that a) sells a lot (so the likelyhood of it being bad is minimized) and b) has a bartender that knows how to pour one properly. Speaking of which, if you do get it in the nitro can, be sure to pour it properly (I believe that it should be slowly and gently poured in one long pour, as opposed to the 2-part pour from the tap). Also be sure to get your lip under the head for the best taste. I think some people get a big gulp of head off that first sip, and then are put off because of the taste (I probably would be too).

I held the glass up to the light... jet black and wonderful! Nice frothy almond head. I took a nice deep sniff.... hmm... not much there. Not bad, but not as strong as I expected. I took a taste. Hmm...it had the aftertaste I expected, but where was the front end flavor??? Kind of felt a little watery. Make that a lot watery!? Not what I expected at all. Not in the least up to the standards I have come to expect from a Guiness brew. I have to say that overall, I'm not impressed.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Water roasted malts, dark chocolate-like bitterness. It is like the nitro sucks all the flavor from this pathetic swill. Nasty foamy weak thin nastiness.  I had this a half a dozen times just to make sure that this was not a defect at the particular bar I was at and have to say it is the bigest beer disappointment I can ever remember having.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,smcolw,4.24,"Guinness created the category stout with this beer. By definition, one would expect it to score well if not the best. Honestly, I've always found Murphy's to be a bit smoother, richer and creamier. This glass was well-poured by the bartender--two thirds high, rest, then finished. The head was two fingers thick, light beige and produced beautiful lace. The color was dark, dark brown, nearly black.  The aroma was dark malt with strong coffee and biscuit notes. There was also a slight yeast smell. This was far subtler than I expected. This might be my only real disappointment.  The taste features sweet, malty flavors up front followed by a hop balance. The aftertaste offers a lingering burnt, black patent malt. The liquor is viscous and rich. While not as creamy as some stouts, it is a very full bodied. Overall, an excellent beer that commands respect from beginning to end.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,mschofield,1.92,"So I think - I've never tried one of these nitro bottles, so why not... bad decision. You can't see the beer, so the appearance is a 1. Half the fun of drinking a Guinness is that nitro cascade, tough luck here. Being stuck in a bottle kills the aroma, what little sneaks out has some roasted malt quality. Taste was odd, not like a normal Guinness probably due to the lack of smell. Bitter - a lemonade type bitterness, some earthyness, roasted malt, and a bit of chocolate. Drinkability is awful, I got bored with it halfway through and had to dump. Not as bad as say Corona or Crazy Ed's Chili beer, just boring and useless. This serves no point with the nitro can being on the market.  and the body is water thin",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,emericanchaos,3.41,Guinness Draught is probably the prettiest beer i've seen. Pours with a thickness that reminds me of lava as it doesn't ripple so much as just oozes. After pouring a thick frothy head of caramel color arises and continues to develop slowly as the beer settles into it's container.  Smells very deep to me. Like there's alot going on. There's some sort of party in the glass with alot of heavy hitters. Not much else to say.  Taste was a let down after smelling it. I drank in the nitro bottle and the glass. In the bottle this is a hard drink because of the thickness. It's just difficult to get a mouthful. That party that noticeable in the distinct aroma has some how vanished. Roasted barley over powers the taste. After about 3 i felt like having some barbecue chicken because of the roasted charcoal-esque taste.  Feels very heavy in the mouth. Dominates any flavor you may have had. I don't smoke but I've tried cigarettes and I'd imagine this goes with smoking very easily even though it would overpower and type of cigarette flavor.  Overall drinkability isn't very high for me. I can get drunk off of it yes but I would appreciate it much more in moderation with a heavy dinner like the barbecue i mentioned or a hearty beef dish.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,tommy78,3.48,"I first heard of this new item when I received an invitation to a party Guinness was throwing on a ferry boat going around Boston Harbor in September 2001. They were going to premier the new Guinness in the bottle. Unfortunately, this shindig has been overshadowed in my life by September 11th (since this party took place on Sept. 10th, 2001). Anyway, I tried the new Guinness and I was impressed with the flavor. The flavor was a 100% improvement on the original Guiness extra stout bottle. However, when I purchased a sixer, I was disappointed to see that it was only 11.7 fluid ounces. I didn't realize this at first, since the Guinness ppl provided us with Guinness bottle covers at the ferry boat party. Also, the design of the bottle makes it look very attractive to those beer drinkers who go on appearence instead of quality. I prefer Guinness by the pint glass at the local pub, but if I need to pick up a pack of Guinness for some home enjoyment, I would purchase the four of the Guinness cans.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Ink black hue, opaque, via the nitro-widget in the bottle a creamy, beige colored head was produced, about a finger in height, typical cascading effect. I found the overall appearance less impressive out of the bottle in comparison to the nitro-can or nitro-tap. Also the amount of beer looks sadly small in my Guinness imperial pint glass. The nose is small in aroma, light but pleasantly roasted malts that produce hints of coffee and chocolate, watery and hollow, in other words it smells like Guinness. The simplistic pleasantness of the bouquet is also found on the palate, roasty malts produce flavors of coffee and chocolate, sadly watery. The taste is adequate with enough flavors to inspire me to quaff this at the bar when a session beer is needed. The low abv is the most redeeming quality about Guinness in my opinion. Medium-light in body, disappointedly thin and watery, smooth and pleasant mouthfeel. It is plenty easy to drink.

I used to drink guinness quite a bit, but then I started looking for some of the good stuff out there, and now drinking a guinness again is like drinking watered-down stout. There's really no body to this beer. Pluck down the extra 2-4 dollars and get a real six-pack. The only good macro out there is sam adams IMO.

A decent aroma of roasted malts, nuts and coffee beans. Up front, refreshing, crisp, clean, dark roasted malts noticeable. The body has a delicate creaminess and a lingering sweetness; as this is explored further, she is a bit light in the body, and dare I say a bit watery, perhaps from the widget?

It's appearance is a beautiful sight for me, with the cascadeing colors in the begginning, and then it switching over to the pitch black body with the thick creamy tan head. One thing that's cool, is that at the Irish Pud I frequent, they dab the foam on top, so that it forms a clover. The taste is not too shabby.

The smell was roasted nuts, caramel and malt, full and flavorful. The mouth was thick and smooth. The taste?

It pours one of the most beautiful black stouts ever made. With a pitch black color and a frothy dark tan head one would expect the perfect stout. This is wrong. Thre was very little smell. A little bitterness in the whiff, but that was about it other than what might have been a slight coffee smell. The taste wasn't much better. Though it was more complex than the beer I was drinking before that (shitty lagers like Bud and Blue), It really doesn't have much complexity at all. A Musty coffee taste that reminds me of how my grandfathers house smelled when I was a kid with an overpowering bitter aftertaste. There was a poor lack of balance.

Overall- I haven't had a Guinness in years and don't recall it being a watered down mess. Maybe it was served to cold. Regardless, my review stands on what I drank!!

Watching the nitrogen work it's magic is half the fun of drinking any nitro-beer. Upon first opening you get a whiff of roasty, chocolatey malt. After that not much of anything can be picked up with the beer inside the bottle.  Taste: I really enjoy this beer on tap, but the bottled version doesn't even seem like the same beer. Roasty, chocolatey malt. Some coffee. Plenty of bitterness, more bitterness than flavor, IMO. Very dry middle to end.  Nice, creamy nitrogen mouthfeel, although drinking from the bottle messes this up a bit as well. I've come a long way since I first started drinking beer out of a glass and I don't want to drink any beer out of the bottle anymore.

When the pour is fresh, there is a wonderul thick head on the top of your beer. You should be able to draw in it or make little 'peaks' on the head by dipping your finger in the beer.

209,754,HochFliegen,3.43,I didnt really like Guinness from the bottle when comparing it to the nitro-can or tap. When poured it sort of flat not as I was used to. Its color was the standard black and the head was rahter weak and not very creamy. Kinda expected that though. The smell was almost dryish. The taste at first was good like a guinness from tap but the after taste is what really turned me off. It had a burnt bacon like after taste. I dont know how else to explain it. It was drinkable but the lingering after taste I didnt like.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,francisweizen,4.23,"While not quite as good as a true pint of nitro-tap Guinness, the nitro canned version is decent. When you pop the top you can hear the nitrogen ball rushing the nitrogen into the beer. On the pour you get that wonderful cascading affect, that settles after a few moments and creates a pitch black, opque beer, with a lovely, dense, creamy nitro head of foam. The aromas are a bit subdued compared to draught, but they are still nice. They consist of roasted malts, and slight hops. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, but not as smooth as draught, and the drinkability takes a bit of a hit as well, for all of the above differences.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Gavage,3.79,"The pour is the best part of this beer. The wait - watching your beer ""build"" into shape is great stuff. Its black in color with a thin tan head. Lacing through the drink. The aroma isn't as exciting as some roasted malts are detected and not much else.  The taste is mellow and not overly exciting for a stout, but it is pleasant. The roasted malt is most notible. Very creamy and smooth mouthfeel. The body is thin for a stout, but this make this a great session beer if there are no other good beers on draft.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,neg007,2.78,"I must admit, this kind of thing isn't my bag.  Anyone that has seen Guinness will know that the appearance is just incredible. Exactly what stout should look like.  Though I had it a few times served properly by Irish beer maids in the home country, I just don't like the tase of it.  Black creamy liquid isn't for me I guess. Though, I do understand why many would love it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,merlin48,3.4,"It's been nearly 9 years since I fell in love with a fresh pint of Guinness, at a Dublin pub near St James Gate. I savored many a pint of this ""brown liquid food"" in Ireland, and it made me a believer. Here, I have an 11.2 oz bottle with a widget inside, and the label recommends drinking it straight from the bottle. I refuse such heresy, and pour into a pint glass. Looks right--opaque deep brown with a frothy tan head. Decent nose of heavy malt, smoke, and burnt coffee. Mouthfeel is creamy, but seems watered down. Taste is of pipe tobacco, two day old coffee, and some stale bread. Enormous lacing on the glass.  This bears scant resemblance to the heavy duty fresh pints I savored in Dublin, Cork, and Galway, but is yet a respectable pint, to my amazement. This expensive looking bottle with widget inside,offers a decent effort to duplicate an authenic, fresh, draft Guinness. Sorry, it just can't be done with widgets.  Impression--Mediocre out of a ""widget"" bottle. The real deal is quite impressive, as I recall. Most Irish folks told me that you would be unlikely to find a decent pint outside of the Republic. They be correct.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Quaffer,3.72,"This is probably my favorite beer and has been since I can remember. I don't remember ever NOT liking Guinness. I am going to forgo my usual review format because everyone knows what this beer tastes and smells like.  I consider this to be the most beautiful beer once poured. The deep black color, the high-density head, the wonderful cascade effect. It doesn't get any better that that.  As far as drinkability, I can put down pints of this stuff all night long. What a classic.  12/12/03  Wow, that was less than a year ago? While I still agree that this beer is beautiful in the glass, and that it can be sucked down all night with little effort, I don't think that it is quite the ambrosia that I did at one time. I've knocked the numbers down accordingly.  Smell: Not bad, but very mild for a stout.  Mouthfeel: Very, very, oh so very thin for a stout. It's very smooth, I must say, but there just needs to be a butt-load more body.  Taste: While the taste is very pleasant, it is mild beyond belief. Still a little roasty, just a bit a toasty, but overall flat.  I still drink this beer when I go out. (Remember, this is Wichita and my choices are severely limited.) But I rarely, if ever, buy it to bring home anymore.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,GreenWBush,3.85,"Since i've lost most of my good pub glasses bringing them over to friend's houses and leaving them there, I wasn't about to make that mistake last night. So I took the opportunity to try the only incarnation of Guinness that I haven't had and picked up a sixer on sale for $6.99  When I got back to the house, I was dismayed to find that these sleekly-designed bottles aren't even 12 ounces, but are in fact 11.2 ounces. Guinness always has a way to get your pocketbook, be it the pub cans that will never give you a buzz, or just their generally overpriced products. They got me yet again.  After drinking the first beer from the bottle, I decided that route of delivery was pretty lame so I switched back to the glass. Pouring the beer into a glass is a bit awkward, but it still kicks up that nice Guinness froth. The smell is actually a bit better than the pub-can version.  The taste is still what i'm used to, with a bit more character. I think some of the watery-ness is decreased by a fuller mouthfeel.  All in all, a huge gimmick that might result in slightly better beer. I would have to do a head to head taste test to establish for sure.  Another way for the Guinness corporation to diversify its interests.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,diablo14,3.06,"without doubt the most well known and acessable stout going around, guinness is a great start for anyone wanting to move up from crappy macro lagers into the realm of darker beers. on the whole tho, if youve tried the foreign export, youll know the tap draught is the equivalent of any boring lager as far as dark beers go.  one thing that has to be pumped up as far as this beer goes, theyve set the standard for a great looking beer. is there a greater sight in beer drinking history that a freshly poured guinness? rich dark color with that flowing head that builds up the glass in waves. its bordering on arousing. thick and creamy head that has more staying power than an irish thoroughbred,. burnt coffee nose, that presents itself in the taste. some chocolate present with quite meaty flavors, and a robust hoppy finish. a meal in itself, ive never managed to have a big session on the guinness no matter how hard ive tried, even thought thet AV isnt high.  a classic even tho its not an especially great beer. guinness is the stepping stone for anyone looking to get past the usual dirge of boring lagers etc that pervade the market. pretty 'sexy' too as far as appearances go. if only every beer poured like this one.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Stingray5,2.08,"The appearance of this stout is by far the most impressive thing about it. Pours a charcoal black with a frothy tan head that lasts the entire pint, leaving a solid wall of lace. Carbonation somehow travels south as things settle.  Mouthful was entirely disappointing. Thin thin thin with almost no carbonation at all. Aroma was sorely lacking as well, with just hints of some cocoa and a strange fruitiness. Taste/texture was very creamy, but not in a good way. more of a non-dairy-creamer thing going on.  Unique in the sense that it's the best looking poor tasting beer I've had.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Boilermaker88,3.61,"Off a nitro-tap, this brew gives you the time to pay some attention to its appearance - a glossy black with ruby edging, a creamy one-finger tan head and a modest amount of lace. The smell is somewhat subdued, of coffee and some cocoa. The taste has a pleasant roasted maltiness with some last-cup old coffee flavor and a light taste of bittersweet chocolate. It finished with a mildly sour taste. The weakest link for Guinness Draught had to be its feel: thin and a bit on the watery side. On the whole, Guinness is a decent stout that is quite easy to drink. Still a good standby, I can think of a number of other stouts I'd rather drink, given the choice.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Poured out a dark brown with minimal head. Decent lacing at least. Smelled weak. Very weak. Like maybe there was a roasted coffeesque flavor in there, but where? Didn't have much to the taste at all. A decent roasted flavor was in there, but it was really watered down. Decent flavor, just not a whole lot of it. I would say the gem of this beer though, was the mouthfeel. Very smooth and creamy. Very smooth. With a low ABV, it's also quite drinkable, and I'll take it over a Bud any day of the week. At least I'm not waking up this morning too sick. What little there is I blame on Tecate.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BierManVA,3.13,"Nitro draft bottle does a good job of impersonating the real thing. But the head settles on this much too fast. The taste of this bier is solely dependant on wether it comes from tap or can or bottle.  Good chocolate and nutty flavor yet somehow not something I am want to have a lot of. The smell is a little weak Creamy heavy head and a smooth mouthfeel. Not as thick a flavor as I am used to with this bier.  I've had this many times over the years in true draught form both here and in the U.K. In my opinion, these canned/bottled version are muck.  John",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Taste is bitter but smooth and creamy. Also watery and weak. Taste teases but refuses to satisfy. mouthfeel is also watery yet creamy with a light bitter malt aftertaste. Drinkable for sure but this is a different beer in the bottle vs. draft. Very good on draft, pretty mediocre in the can/bottle. The only good reason to have some around the house is for homemade black and tans, half and halfs and the like.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,beernbbq,4.18,"Still an exceptional stout. Mine was a can brought back from Ireland, so it was not the export from Toronto. Beautiful silky black appearance topped with a creamy beige head.

209,754,Anglewood,3.66,"This isn't so much a review of Guinness than a commentary on the importance of where you get it and how it is poured. I remember a time when there was a real mystique to this entry level stout. Everyone said it was great, I couldn't wait to taste it, I had bought into the advertising hype. Then I had that first pint poured, watched the cascade, etc. etc. I woke up (disappointed) after the first sip. It really didn't taste all that good, in fact, I had had much better beers before.  I did not, however, let this dissuade me from trying it again. I tried the can, OK: the bottle: not so good, even the trendy rocket widget bottle after it came out: OK again. I wanted so much to like this beer, and though it was drinkable, it was never what I had hoped for. That is until I walked into a little Irish Pub/dive bar in Milbrae CA (beer mail me for the name). They had Guinness on tap, and being in an Irish Pub of sorts, I had to try it. At first I was wondering what took so long, there was nobody else in the bar, we could see it being poured, but it still took at least five minutes. When it finally came, I tasted Guinness as it is meant to be had. Still not stellar, but vastly different than any other pint of this brew I had had up until that point. It so happens the Bartender/Owner is actually from Creaslow (sp?) Ireland, and really knows his Guinness. He said the first thing he did when he bought the place was to re-work the tap so that it poured ""right."" He also said that he had had pints of Guinness in the states that would put anyone off the stuff for life. I could definitely relate there.  What is my point? Guinness is not the greatest beer (obviously), but in the right place, and when poured correctly it can still be a great part of the beer drinking experience. I still visit that little dive whenever I can just so I can re-visit what I have come to love about the beer and the experience it brings. Since then though, I have yet to have another pint of Guinness quite as good as from that place. If you want Guinness, make sure it is poured correctly, and let the atmosphere be part of the beer. You might even buy into the hype, even if it is for just one pint.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Dubblebock,3.59,"True story...I have a friend at work who is a dedicated malternative drinker....he likes the Smirnoff Ice and all that hokum....swears that he doesn't like beer much....except for Guinness Draught. It's the one and only beer that he will drink. What kind of point am I trying to make? Hell, I don't know...it's just a story...don't read TOO much into it.  To my palate, Guiness Draught is sort of like an entry-level stout. It looks impressive, but it doesn't have much in the way of a real bite. It comes in these nifty nitro-widget cans and bottles. If you pour it, it will disply the characteristic Guinness head: large, fluffy, and long-lasting. You can also drink this one straight from the can or bottle. Looks absolutely wonderful. No nose at all...what's there is faintly sweet and malty. Brewed by Guinness in Canada and imported to the US market.  Tastes sort of weak and watery compared to it's more robust cousins. It's a low ABV beer, so it's easy to drink and enjoy. It has some malt character, but it's not at all pronounced. Coffee-flavors abound, even a few light cream sensations come through. Mouthfeel is strictly average. Extremely drinkable, though. It's easy to keep pouring this beer. It's good when paired up with lighter beef and potato meals.  Look, it's a fun beer. It's just not a monster beer by any means. I can sort of see why my buddy drinks it. The Draught is light on the palate, absolutely no bitterness can be found anywhere, and it comes in this sexy, cutesy-widget bottle. All of the elements are there for success. If you're new to stouts or want to get off of the lager/pilsner bandwagon, this is the beer for you.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,RoyalT,3.78,"Appearance  Black with the cascading foam that makes this stout famous. I had this on-top and it was filled to the top, so I didnt get a chance to gauge the head.  Smell  The aroma is not strong, but I can pick up dark malts and chocolate and maybe even a hop balance. Theres also some light molasses sweetness to this one.  Taste  This is much drier than it smells. It has a nice sweetness with a touch of caramel malt.  Mouthfeel  I thought this was the stouts strong point. This one is super smooth from start to finish.  Drinkability  A session stout if there ever was one. Not the hardiest one youll ever put down, but good nevertheless with an above-average mouthfeel.  Update 06/08/18 – I originally reviewed this at a pub 15 years ago and am surprised on how smooth it is from the bottle.

I have had it many times before so I wasn't looking too forward to it like when trying a new beer.  Tasted like burnt coffee heh. Your average stout taste. Kinda bland when compared to other stouts.

209,754,gueuzeonhigh,2.72,"I'm told by those in the know that something happens to Guinness products when they're bottled and imported into the US of A.  From what I could taste, after my session with the ""Draught"" the above rumor has merit.  For this review I opened a nito widget packed bottle.  The nitro widget does what it's supposed to-- the beer poured with a wonderful creamy but light, tan tinged head.  The head endured throughout my tasting session, with some lacing but generally more of a coating-- like olive oil might coat the walls of a salad bowl.  The beer itself was black as widower's weeds.  So far in keeping with what I expected.  Perhaps I do not comprehend what the essence of ""Draught"" is. But in my opinion this beer is a light weight in all respects.  The nose is a nondescript wilted bouquet of hops with a hair of toated malt thrown in for good measure-- but I'm straining-- no distractions please.  The flavor is a watery non-entity- a touch of ale like character, a pinch of roasted malt and that's about it.  The finish was short 'n' clean..  Overall the flavor came in with a wimper and went out with a wimper.  The mouthfeel was quite cordial with a ""heavier"" body.  Given the gallons of Guinness I've consumed throughout the years, this beer is a disappointment-- even for an imported and bottled product (see my opening statement)...  I'll leave my review open for revision after I try some more of this beer....",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,mwrseeley,3.97,"As I am referring to the nitro-can, and not to the bottle or to the draught offering, I am going to review Guinness Draught conservatively, and leave myself room for future amendments.  I liked it of course (to say otherwise would be disingenuous) but I regard it the same way I regard Glenfiddich, in the realm of single malt scotch whisky - as a stepping stone to better things.  You gotta love the wild cascading effect that comes with the pour. The body was black, of course, and the head was the normal off-white, but the lacing was different from bottled Guinness or the Guinness draughted from the tap. I was looking forward to counting the rings but there weren't any (and yes, I am using the proper glassware and using the standard pour method) even though the head retained its robustness throughout the time it took to finish the drink.  I thought that by effect on the palate, by the standards put forth by Guinness Draught afficionados, was a bit thin. The taste of roasted malts, however, is always appreciated. Is Guinness a mass-marketed cliche? Perhaps. But it does go down damned easily.  A can 330ml nitro-can costs 5200 won ($4.50 US) in Korean supermarkets and somewhere in the 10,000 won ($11 US) range in pubs or restaurants. Can you believe that? And to think Koreans often call themselves the 'Irish of Asia'.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

I still think its a great looking pint, the light head on the dark brew, the lightness eminating from the dark as you set it down after taking a sip. Simply one of the best heads ever, which lends a beautiful look to the whole thing. Taste is good, very presentable to someone not familiar with Stouts or a soul that's intimidated by dark brews, but not something that would make one more familiar with various dark beers throw down thier pants and say Hallelujah. Some say its too filling or heavy, but don't beleive what you're told in that regard, I can certainly drink ten pints of this without feeling more full than I would after 160 oz. of any other good beer.

Strange to review it really 'cause I'be been drinking it for 30 years. Still sometimes the review is simply a way of expressing oneself. From the bitter to the coffee; with that creamy smooth feel in the mouth. Why can some macros do it and others can't? I have often said aftertaste is my big thing. Well, Guinness has good aftertaste.  Guinness draught is one of the reliable ones when it comes to beer. In those airport bars, chain hotels, etc. you can always be sure with this brew.

The cascading head slowly changes to a near black liquid in the glass, with just a hint of redness when held directly in front of a light. The nose is a mix of burnt torrified barley, very light smoke, very light espresso and some bitter chocolate. Taste is smooth and very creamy due to the nitro bottles, with notes of highly roasted malts, chocolate, fleeting fruitiness, a wisp of smokiness, and non-denominational bitterness...probably more from the roasted barley than the hoppiness, which seems to be minimal here.

Mouthfeel: Creamy, yet watery at the same time. A conundrum in a glass.  Drinkability: I can drink this easily, and with no shame. But, outside of certain circumstances.. why really bother?  Other: Guinness is the elevator muzac of good beer. Let others trash it all they want, it's not really _that_ bad. It's just not exactly that good either.

It lacks the cascading bubbles one gets from the tap and the head is not nearly as high or long lasting. The color is still dark. I do not think it has the same strong aroma I get from a draft either. There is some lingering coffee scent. Taste is not as pronounced almost has a metalic feel. The mouthfeel is not as creamy.

Sitting in the Sky Bar of the Guinness factory with a view over Dublin and a pint of the black, expertly poured, without the touristy shamrock was a great experience. All the true stout flavours and textures came through. A hint of coffee, that slighly burnt taste, a thick creamy texture and not too much gas as Australian so called ""stouts"" can have, and a head that lasted all the way to the bottom of the glass.

And for fuck's sake -- you can't even pull the label off the bottle in a drunken stupor since it's plastic that's shrink-wrapped to the bottle shape. But I will give it a 1.5 because the bottle is kind of sexy looking -- curvy like a fine woman. (I choose to see the silver lining.) Similarly, no aroma escapes the bottle. Tastes OK. More or less like Guinness with the flavor boiled out or diluted with milk or something. I'm telling you; it tastes like corn flakes. Reasonably creamy still, which is nice.

209,754,Brian700,3.99,"If you want to talk appearance...this is a beer to be talking about. Its fun to just watch. The head is almost surreal as it forms. As a homebrewer it is baffling. The head is so creamy looking, off-white, small bubbled froth. It never disipates, it just follows the beer to the bottom of the glass until you feel its time to suck it down. Smell is chocolate but a mild smell all around. Not very strong. Definately not hoppy. Tastes of malt and chocolate and definately some coffee notes. The mouthfeel is so Creamy. Sort of chewy. I'm not a big Guiness drinker so I've got no Idea how the Ol' tummy handles it in larger quanities, but, I'd sure give it a try one night. Seems a little too creamy to try drinking it all night. But thats just me. A damn good beer",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Ellbert,3.96,"This is a great beer. It just looks awesome with the cascading effect of the head. The head just last the entire glass. tonight mine was served with a four leaved cloved drawn on the head that stayed there till the end.  The smell was very roasty with coffe and burnt caramel smells. The taste was the same.  Mouthfeel was great, it was very rich and smooth with little carbonation but it fit the stout just right.  This wasn't very drinkable. I could substitute this with my meal because it is so thick.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Gueuzedude,2.49,"This is the nitro bottle version. Very smooth tasting almost creamy, a bit of roastiness. Overall very clean and not too exciting. Carbonation is very low, and in this beer makes it seem a bit too thin. Much better versions of Guiinness exist, the Belgian version is awesome.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,UnionMade,3.54,"The beer pours forth in a thin stream from the tap, deep beige cascading to black, topped with a thick, creamy sand colored head. Great lacework, typical nitro clinginess. Aroma is mildly roasty, a bit tinny from the nitro. Very mild hopping. No real extraneous aroma, just simple and classic. A touch of coffee, but that's about it. Flavor is fairly thin and lightly roasty. Roasted malt flavor prevails from start to finish. Very easy drinking, with smooth nitro carbonation and light bitterness, mostly from the roasted malt. Hops provide a solid dryness to the finish, leaving a slight black coffee aftertaste. Some tinny metallic flavor, with a flavor deadening effect from the nitrogen. Very simple, but a pleasant beer to drink when the tap selection's limited. Very easy to drink, with enough flavor to keep you interested. A definitive beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,nomad,2.99,"Pours a deep brown, with that big creamy cream head, impossibly slow to fall. Lace is extremely thick, leaving stain of a similar quality that create a second wall on the glass. Eerily attractive from the nitrogen but must give it some credit. Smell was faintly of dark chocolate mixed with oak, with some lighter oaky and roasty scents too. Not easy to sniff. Taste begins with the lightly creamy taste of the abundant head, then comes the thin dark malts and roasted barley, oaky notes, and ends with a short to medium finish of similar burnt flavors. That very thin mouthfeel strikes too close to water, makes it feel as weak as the taste, though this does get alleviated by the hyper-creamy head to a thicker feel.  I wonder what it would be like if we got the original Irish recipe, draughting, and serving temperature...",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,ithacabaron,3,"Not bad, but I've always considered Guinness' most appealing element to be it's silk-like smoothness. This, of course, is from the nitrogen it's either kegged or bottled with. Otherwise, apart from it's appealing crispness, I've never found anything about this beer to write home about. Instead, I always find myself wondering what other beers would be like with a nitro tap...",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,TinusTime,3.91,"The Guinness draught pours a jet black with the beautiful creamy off white head that lasts forever. One could go into a Zen like state watching the head cascade and form. The smell is of roasted malts and grains, with heavy coffee, and chocolate notes. The taste is similar with flavours of coffee, chocolate and caramel. There is some bitterness from the roasted malts, not so much from the hops. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a touch of dryness at the backend..This is a great session beer as the low ABV keeps you from getting too loopy. But be careful, as too many of these in a night can do frightening things to your innards",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,chaduvel,3.22,"Say what you will about nitrogen and it's effects on taste etc., but it's hard to find a better looking beer than this. Black in color with a head that looks like meringue. Cascading effects are very cool. Very smooth and velvety taste/mouth feel, kind of artificial. Lots of roasted malt flavors somewhat chewy in texture. Some lasting bitterness for the finish. Pretty damn good for coming out of the can.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Dmann,4.31,"A true classic among beers, I was re aquanted with it tonight on tap at Dave&Busters. The bar tender even knew how to pour it correctly, I was shocked! Anyways, it poured that great dark black color with a great creamy head that stayed throughout the whole glass. It smelled of roasted coffee and chocolate and tasted pretty much the same. The mouthfeel was great and creamy and it really opened up once it hit your tounge with a bit of a tingle. I could have drank it all night, but at 4 bucks a pint glass my pocketbook was saying ""no"". This is one macro that still tastes fucking great!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,OldFrothingSlosh,3.55,"It seems rather strange to drink this Guinness right from the bottle, as the directions on said bottle told me to do so. I'd had this nitro bottle before and didn't follow the directions and poured it into a glass. I really liked the sheeting action from it.  This time, points get deducted because I can't see the damn beer. It's dark....I'll give it that. Aromas are still on the thin side. Some coffee, chocolate, and nuts. Taste was a little fuller than expected, but still nothing great, with the roasted coffee and chocolate trying to show some muscle but really not doing much of anything. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Drinkability suffers since I really enjoy the ""visuals"" associated with a well-poured Guinness. I'll still take a fresh pint over any botte, nitro-bottle, nitro-can, etc.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,IronDjinn,4.68,"These new nitro bottles have been staring me down from the shelves and coolers this past year, taunting me, even heckling me when I'd consistently pass them by for a 6 of something else. I'm at odds, I love trying new stuff that I find, but at the same time I inherently distrust any new changes to old norms. This would be one of them. Guinness in a bottle, with a widget? Oh it's a mad world. And they recommend that you drink it straight from the bottle. Yeah, fat chance fellas...  Poured it from it's 330 ml nitro bottle straight into a Guinness pint glass (regulation size I think....). Good Golly Miss Molly, that is probably THE most beautiful pour I have ever witnessed from a bottle (or any other vessel). Same traditional Guinness pour, nitrogen cascade slowly leveling upwards in a shower of tan layers until only a black curtain remains, topped by a thick beige head that leaves a spiderweb network of lacing all the way down the pint glass. I am very impressed. Aroma of roasted malt and coffee, very inviting. Flavour to match as well, mouthfeel is thick and creamy, rich and satisfying. I could drink this all year. Guinness used to be my standard ever since I was legal, I used to swear by it. Over the years it became a bit too much of a pop culture phenomenon, passe, and I've drifted away due to this image and in search of different stouts. Still, it's wonderful to come home like this. If only all macros were brewed to this caliber. High volume consistency is an art form in itself when it comes to this sort of quality. I've always loved the extra stout, but when it comes to buying draught at the beer store, mine will now always come in bottles. Halelujah!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,Rumrunner,3.61,"Pint glass  Pours a thick black. Very dense. Great grey head. Excellent lacing. A very nice bitter bread, coffee scent.  Taste is burnt coffee(Sanka? Just kidding), dark unsweetened chocolate and deep toasted bread flavors. Some dryness follows the aftertaste.  Nice and heavy mouthfeel. Very dense on the tongue. A crisp finish.

I'd have to say that all stouts should be judged from this one. Well, if you're not familiar with it, here comes my review. It pours a dark black - completely denying any light that tries to pass it through. The head is perfect (always): large, thick, creamy white head that will stick around until you're done with the beer. It leaves a nice bit of lacing on the glass too. The flavor is very rich and full. Mostly sweet coffee and chocolate in the flavor with some maltiness underneath. The aftertaste has the coffee/chocolate hint as well and leaves you with a milk mustache. Wonderful. The only thing that can even compare with this stout (that I've found) is the Young's Luxury Double Chocolate Stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,freed,4.29,"I'm surprised its taken me this long to review this beer. Its such a standard. The appearance is quite definitive, which counts for a lot. From across the room you know its a Guinness. Nice shapely imperial pint, creamy off-white head that takes up the top 1/2 inch of the glass. Below is a midnight black liquid through which no light passes.  The aroma is of dry, peated malts. Hops are probably used in this beer, but its not apparent, either in aroma or flavor. Its affect are known though partly as a balance to the lactic sour. A sip is a nice experience, as it leaves a drip of foam on the mustache. Instantly dry feeling in the mouth as the smokey and peaty liquid moves through the mouth, the sour backend and dry mouth feel are almost one of a kind.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

I'll confess, I'd rather drink this than 2/3rds of the beers out there, but it falls so far short of the tap that you spend all your time wishing you were back at the pub. The drinker shouldn't be left wishing for more like that. If nothing better is available though, then by all means, drink it!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,TheDM,3.52,This sample from a can poured a small creamy head of fine light brown mostly lasting bubbles and an opaque dark brown colored body.

209,754,dmarch,3.71,"We all know the situation. You're in an irish style pub and look at the tap selection. Swill, swill, swill, ah, I'll have a guinness. Black in color with a creamy nitro head. Aroma is of roasted coffee. Taste is mostly coffee as well. Very drinkable, makes me wish it wasn't so overpriced. It doesn't come close to many other stouts out there, but due to its widespread availability, it's certaintly a blessing.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,ngandhi,4.31,"What you have heard is true.  This is not the best stout in the world. When we're talking about real stouts  Bell's Kalamazoo, for example  we're talking about an intensity of flavors and aromas and body so dense you ladle the beer into bowls.  Guinness Draught, however, is a great stout  just on the other end of the stout spectrum. Think Sammy Smith Oatmeal Stout, even Rogue Shakespeare (which so many users here have rated so high). These beers don't make you puck your lips and bend over; they are simply great beers. And Guinness Draught is a great beer.  I've had it every way you can. The nitro-can is the most impressive. I don't know how it works (or what that little ping-pong ball inside the can actually does), but Guinness Draught cans are as good as tap. The bottle is another story; it lacks body and depth. (Also, you get more bang for your buck with the pint cans over of the glass-sized bottles).  This brew offers hints of caramel, coffee, chocolate, everything you would expect, all subdued. Light hops on the finish. The key to this beer is its balance. This is the best balanced beer anywhere in the world.  The flavors are not mellowed, as some would argue, to suit an American audience. The cans are not the same as European tap, but it's pretty damn close (believe me, I've had both). There's a reason this beer is so creamy, a reason why they went through the trouble of designing a can that could insure the creaminess on every pour; this beer was intended to be swished around in the mouth, lace not only down your glass, but down your throat. As with any fine liquor, this is to be savored. If you let your tongue do what it does best, there's a world of delight here whether you like burnt-malt heavy stouts or sourpuss IPA's.  Forget the label; don't let ""stout"" scare or dissapoint you. Whether you drink Busch, Rogue, Duvel, or Chimay: you will enjoy this immensely.  Get the cans and, for the love of God, don't serve it chilled.  Relax, relax. ng",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,avylover,4.04,"I first had this in England when I was 18 and fell in love with it. I Still enjoy it to this day.  It pours brownish black with a massive waterfall of carbonation throughout the brew. Once this waterfall lets up, it's black with a thick,creamy white head. Aroma is on tons of bready malt, with some coffee and chocolate aromas. The taste actually reminds me of hard italian bread crust. There's a nice bitter finish with some coffee/chocolate notes. Mouthfeel is smooth & creamy, just excellent. The benchmark for stouts, and a great beer at that.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,sardonic,3.95,"This is my first review, whee.  Guinness Draught, from what I gather, is almost Guinness' equivalent of light beer. And it's insanely better than anything I've tried with the word ""light"" on the packaging.  I got this at the local provincial liquor mart, including taxes it cost me $3.13 CDN per can. At that price, it's definitely nothing I'd use to actually get drunk, but it tastes great.  The taste and smell remind me of gourmet coffee, with a hint of chocolate. And that coffee taste sure does linger for quite awhile.  Guinness Draught went down very smooth for me, so smooth that I was tempted to chug it very quickly. Then I remembered what I paid for it.  Overall, a highly drinkable beer. I'd definitely be able to drink a few pints of this without thinking twice.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Beastdog75,3.83,"The nitro version of Guinness does an admirable job of attempting to retain the qualities of the Extra Stout while adding that nitro-boost that is supposed to help the mouthfeel and appearance. Flavorwise, it isn't quite as impressive as Extra Stout (from now on referred to as ""ES"" in this review). Supposedly this one was really brewed in Ireland (no mention of Canada anywhere on the packaging).  Guinness Draught opens with a rather loud hiss and pours a deep dark/near black color with some hints of brown. Appearance is slightly more murky than ES. Perhaps it was the way I poured it, but the head, while still nice, wasn't quite as expansive as ES. Definite coolness in the cascading effect, as the lighter, chocolate milk colored half rises from the bottom to the top forming the head and leaving behind the richly dark colors. Head has a nice cappocino color to it, and resembles the froth of the aforementioned beverage. Some sticky, spider-web like lace is left behind. Smell is lighter than ES: some roasted grains in the nose and something that was almost medicine-like (perhaps similar to Ben-Gay?!??). The mouthfeel is great. Smooth and creamy, but somewhat like skim milk as well. Reminds of the mouthfeel of an iced coffee. The taste is lighter/waterier than ES. Typical roasted grains, perhaps with some more chocolate notes than ES. Another iced coffee comparision can be made regarding the flavor. Some modest dryness and bitterness. Aftertaste doesn't have that long, lingering bitterness that ES has. Some leftover roasted coffee and bitterness notes, and this beer finishes off with some alcohlic warmth.  This is somewhat like a Guinness Light. I have had a nitro-bottle of this before and the can far surpases the bottle. Altogether, not as flavorful or as bitter as Guinness Extra Stout, but perhaps a bit easier to drink.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,hotstuff,3.27,"Can. When this beer was poured into my glass, it poured with a very long-lasting tan, creamy, thick head with small-medium sized bubbles.

209,754,euskera,3.41,"I would venture to guess that this is most people's entry point into stouts. I used to love this stuff, with its velvety mouthfeel and slight hints of peat in there, but since I've started expanding my horizons, I find that there are just so many better-tasting examples of a stout out there. I will, however, never turn a pint of this stuff down. It's an old friend....",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,maxpower,2.19,"Went out for lunch, the only beers available were from AB or the Guinness draught, I got the Guinness, it does have a nice appearance, black in color with a huge creamy tan head, weak roasty aroma, bland and weak flavor, it is thin and watery, yet has a creamy mouthfeel from the nitro, overall very bland and flavorless, not much going on here.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,yosh,4.7,"I much prefer to drink Guinness on draft over a bottle any day. A nicely poured Guinness keeps it's look and taste all the way to the end.

209,754,TPoling,4.03,"The Spurs just lost a pivotal game four to the Nets in the NBA finals, making it an even series. I am on my third Guinness Draught in a nitro can and I'm still not over the loss. What does this have to do with reviewing a beer?  Texas law forbids ale under 6 percent alcohol to be labeled stout. A pint of bottled Guinness bought in Texas, therefore, was from separate batch with higher alcohol content. But the word ""stout"" appears nowhere on the draught cans, allowing the Guinness folks to produce their lower alcohol real deal. Now it is a session beer. Not great for drowining sorrows, but wonderful for an evening of drinking with friends.  The stout pours with the base note of beer, creating a ridiculously creamy tan head with falling bubbles. Black as the heart of Jack the Ripper. The smell is mild, but very malty that could best be described as walking into an Irish pub anywhere in the world.  The taste, which reminded me of used motor oil on my first sip in 1988, is a smooth, but dark roasted malt with almost enough hops for the balance.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,tar,3.59,"Pours a beautiful black with a finger think layer of off-white/cream colored head. The sharp distinction between the head and the rest of the beer is part of what makes a Guinness so nice to look at in a glass (the wonderful cascade following pouring also contributes greatly to its attractiveness). The thick creamy head is very persistent (its there til the end), and sticks wherever it comes in contact with the glass. The smell is of roasted coffee with an oaky undertone. The taste is also of roasted malts with a coffee flavor. A bit of smokiness is also present. A very smooth and creamy mouthfeel leads to this being a rather drinkable beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,thefireman,4.42,"Pours with a nice head. Head thins, leaving a dark beer and good lacing. Coffee, malt, and all the goodies Guiness is known for. Smooth as silk.

209,754,SheepNutz,3.86,"Even though I tried both guinness and bass tonight, I didn't get to try a black and tan. I had this in a 16oz. glass on nitro tap. I was a little pissed off when the bartender didn't do a two part pour. It took forever to settle. The people of Guinness would not be happy if they saw this guy's aweful pours. Nevertheless, it pours a deep brown changing to black as it settles with a creamy white head. There is awesome head retention and lots of lacing. The smell has a roasted coffee aroma to it. The taste is a little bit of coffee with burnt malt. There isn't much hops noticeable. The mouthfeel is a little light due to the nitro. The drinkability is very good at 4.1%. This is offered almost anywhere and is good to fall back on.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,brewdlyhooked13,3.54,"So me and Sheepnutz are out at the Hofbrauhaus Newport swilling down Weizens, see. Well we ended the evening a little earlier than I usually would due to my wife's friends with a short leash or something, what the hell ever, right? So we said our sayonaras and perhaps Sheep and I will check out Beer and pretzel night at Barrel House later in June, do a beer night proper justice. But now it's me and my other half, with a sitter at home and some free time on our hands. We check out a local bar with live music (The Polecats) and I'm looking for something I haven't reviewed. They don't even have taps here at Patrick's in Delhi, just bottles, my military background tells me we will make due.  Quite the long setup, I know, but sometimes ambience has an impact for a review. I look into the cold case, and the only thing I can even *consider* drinking after Hofbrau will be either Guinness or Newcastle Brown. Obviously, the Guinness won.  I asked the barmaid for a glass, did I get a pint glass? Course not, she gave this comic book pilsener glass that might hold 6 ounces or something. What's that about? Again, we'll make due. The beer pours out quite dark and the liquid texture is on the thick side. Perhaps you're thinking this is a heavy-tasting beer. Aroma, however, may make you reconsider. I pick up some faint roasted malt, but not as much as the dark color would implicate. The head appears after the beer is poured, in a bottom-up fashion. Maybe one finger or so, and kept a layer across the top all the way to the bottom. Wonderful lacing down the side, I used the empty glass as an example to show my wife what 'lacing' meant. She was dutifully thrilled if nothing else. A fine woman, my wife, but that's another review...  The taste, while in my book underachieves the first impression left by the darkness and head, is a stalwart in this particular beer style. It is a benchmark of sorts, and also an entry point for many who want to try dark beers - save the Expedition for another day.  Noticeable roasted grain taste, heavier than normal mouthfeel, but not overwhelming in flavor, bite, alcohol. The nitro effect certainly softens up the mouthfeel as you would expect, I would like to try this in another format beside nitro bottle. Just a slight hop feel at the end, keeping in step with the malt level. Taste-wise, it's not over the top, but it *is* most tasty and a very drinkable beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,DESTRO,3.91,"The legend. It pours pitch black with a decent creamy head. Head dies down a bit but a nice float remains which laces the glas just beautifully. smells of malt and a nice roasted scent but nothing stong. the taste is a mild roasted malt flavour with a hint of coffee and the mouthfeel is a lovely creamy texture that coats your mouth. The drinkability as far as taste goes is great, but they do ten to fill you up a bit. I also love them floated over a nice cider or brown ale. I've had them in the nitro cans also which were pretty good (not as good as beamish) and the bottles which i felt were very un-impressive (way to watered down). on tap is the only way to have it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Andreji,3.08,"A big change this beer has taken me on. Radical, because the first time i brought this stout from the states, in a can, I was seriously disappointed (like 1.0 disappointed). In a recent trip to North Ireland I gave myself a second chance on this stout. On tap, canned, etc. And It was, comparatively, fabulous. I underrated it the first time or did not have the palate for it, but for some reason it just tasted better- the range of flavours, the temperature, the pour- in NI. I became somewhat appreciative of it and, in spite of this lowering when retrying it in Paris, I keep a decent regard to it now, and change my opinion.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Boto,4.5,"The pour is just part of the experience, watching that wave of tan rising to the top of the glass. Beer itself is a very dark RED. If you don't believe me hold it up to a very strong light. Very subtle flavors of coffee and chocolate. I feel that this is a very under-rated and malinged beer. The ""widget"" can gives it almost an identical flavor to draught. I haven't tried the widget bottle, I can't bring myself to drinking it that way. Absolutely Genius!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Realale,3.38,"First, the bias disclosures - I don't like Nitro dispense. Its right up there with artificial turf, dome stadiums (for football or baseball) and the designated hitter in my book. I'd banish all of them if I could, but sometimes you get stuck somewhere that a Guinness is the only alternative to a U.S. macro lager, so . . .  Pours a nice black with ruby highlights, capped by a picture perfect dense slightly off-white 1/3"" cap of foam that goes nowhere throughout the pint. I deduct appearance points because I know the Nitro is responsible rather than the skill of the brewer. [breast implant analogy deleted by Realale in the interest of good taste]  Nose is just a whiff of roasted barley, and a touch of lactic sourness. More complex on the palate, with additional grains supporting the roasted barley, and some bitterness kicking in from the roast barley, and presumedly, some hops. Decent length from the bitterness. Its a simple melody, but its catchy.  The texture of nitro dispensed beers makes me a bit queasy, but that's just me. I'd drink two if there was nothing else, and I really wanted a beer - otherwise I'd be scoping the bourbons and whiskies on offer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Pegasus,3.61,"Appearance: Deep ebon in color with a small but incredibly creamy head from the nitro glass; the retention is excellent.. The beer roils most impressively when poured from the can, it resembles an avalanche within the glass. The lacing is superior, it leaves a thick unbroken coating on the glass walls that resembles cream.  Aroma: Earthy, smoky malt aroma with hints of bitter cocoa, coffee, and understated citrus hops.  Taste: The taste is dominated throughout by the backbone of roasted malts. At the beginning of the taste there is also a mild caramel note, followed by strong bitter chocolate and coffee notes. The finish is dry with an earthy character.  Mouth feel: Incredibly rich and creamy, difficult to over praise.  Drinkability/notes: Quite nice, I prefer Guinness Extra Stout, but this is better than most of the beer to be had in this world.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,kindestcut,2.71,"So, this is Guinness Draught. Well, it isn't the beer I thought it was. I'm a Guinness newby. I was trying all sorts of beers while ignoring this, the king of stouts. I had a couple many years ago, but now it was finally time to try it again.  Guinness is indeed dark...very dark. So far so good. The nitro bottle pours the beer with a creamy head. I have to say it appears to have been shot from a keg.  The aroma is decidedly faint...roasted malt, vague coffee, maybe a little chocolate out there somewhere. The flavor and mouthfeel are tied, or shackled I should say. I was amazed that this beer is not as strong in its flavor and is almost watery. Now, there's definite flavor. Again it's malty with a very dry finish. However, a good stout, to me, surrounds you. It's not a beer that waits for you to find it. This beer sneaks up on you while you look for it. It's just not all that great.  I acknowledge that I was drinking a nitro bottle, a fantasy, an illusion, a reflection of reality. This isn't a kind review but I am not giving up on Guinness. I am going to try it in all its incarnations before I chuck it. But with all the flavorful stouts out there, we're near the end of the line.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,lampkins,5,"In my opinion the only decent stout beer that is packaged in the nitro can. Appearance is amazing and pours a silky foamy head.  Taste is fantastic, a complex taste that does not leave a bitter aftertaste that is often common with American made stouts. Some have compared the consistency of this brew to motor oil, but I disagree. Since this is a nitro mixture the beer is light, smooth and goes down easy.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,furiousxgeorge,4,"Guinnes is my favorite beer. It has a wonderfully complex taste and years of tradtition behind it.  It may be overrated, but really you will be hard pressed to find a better beer unless you are a real snob.

I will stand by my belief that Guinness is entirely overrated, but that's just because John Q. Beer Drinker gets tickled pink at the sight of an opaque brew. The fact is, Guinness is not a bad beer. I've come to expect more from a stout but it's got a decent flavor and a robust yet refreshing mouthfeel.  HOWEVER, the only reason it should be so famous is because the brewery has such an interesting history.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,allboutbierge,3.47,Argue if you like but I think Guiness Draught on tap pours one of the prettiest pints in all of beerdom. Smell is weak though-light notes of roasted malt there. Taste is the same with a delicate blend of hops and chocolates. Relatively watery finish but body is moderate to slightly heavy. The greatest aspect of Guiness is its availability. With few exceptions you can find it where ever you go and have a half decent beer.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Running4beer,4.23,"One of my favorites since I began drinking this in college 5 years ago. There has been a difference in taste in those five years though. Nowadays it seems to be watered down a little but irregardless it's still good. Pours out black with a slight red highlight and a thick creamy tan froth this stays till the very end. The cascading effect is awsome it's something to enjoy every time you see it being poured. Smell of malt, coffee and some chocolate. The taste is similar to the smell malt, coffee and chocolate with a slight nutty twist at the end. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy easy to drink. Even though this has changed since I first began to drink it, I still enjoy it any time of the year.  Slainte!!!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BeerResearcher,3.66,"If it's in a bottle or can it's not a draught...simple. Really dark with red/amberish tint. An earthy malty and peat aroma blends with tea and hops. The heavy extra roasted malt is smoky and thick. Highly hopped with tea-like and metallic bitterness. Strong coffee and a hint of molasses and a trace of camphor round out the flavors. A taste of earthy peat is omni-present. Fantastic beige/tan creamy/frothy head. An Original! But, somehow not as dark or bitter as I remember...",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,feloniousmonk,2.88,"Pouring the contents of this unique, innovative bottle creates the mythical creamy head and the magical flowing cascade, so favored in the pubs. Or is it just a cheap imitation? Aroma nicely hints at coffee and cream, and a touch of chocolate, rich and luscious. Small amounts of bitterness,but exceptionally smooth on the tongue. Light body, thin texture, and far too soft for my taste. It took me a while to understand the supreme appeal of Draught Guinness, for the Extra Stout was my bottle of choice in early days. I did a taste test between the two, and ultimately found that the draught version resembles a chocolate milkshake, or a mocha latte. It's for people who want to go beyond fizzy lagers and such, but don't really want to approach the bold flavors and bitterness in a true stout or porter.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Winter,4.56,"Served black in appearance with a thick creamy light tan head that stays throughout consumption. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and creamy. Serving temperature was cool. Aroma consisted of roasted malt, coffee and chocolate. Roasted malt and coffee flavors dominate the palate. Dry bitterness lingers in the finish. Guinness on draught is still my number one preference when compared to the nitro can or bottle.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,AtLagerHeads,3.41,"Very nice presentation from the nitro bottle. Pours the cascading style that Guinness prefers to porvide. Very dark appearance with a great big, tan head. Good lacing. The taste is vintage Guinness with the kind of mid bitterness and creaminess that is well known. A godd beer that is a go-to when only macros are the alternative. Smell is not as robust as from the tap.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,ThePostmaster,2.75,"I was told to drink right from the bottle, and I did so. Taste is very chocolate in nature. Somewhat malty, a little less so than the original. I thought I was tasting cocoa at first. Very watered down. The carbonation was pronounced, making it easy to drink. A pretty smooth ""stout"".",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,canucklehead,3.81,I have not had a pint of Guinness is some time and I thought that St. Patrick's day was a great excuse to retry this classic quaff.  The head was white and thick which is part of the pleasure of a well served pint. The body was malty and smooth with a hint of caramel and coffee. The drinkabilty of this beer is what makes this a perfect session pint to accompany good food and good friends.  I compared this beer against a bottle of Killarney Stout from Granville Island Proto Tap and I must admit that lacked the full bodied flavour of the Killarney. It is true that while still a classic brew there are other newer stouts that have raised the bar on dry stouts.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,stirgy,4.06,"Well, it is St. Pattys Day isnt it?  So I must have a Guinness. You cannot beat the appearance of this stout. It really is special and amazing. A midnight opaque black with a huge creamy and cascading tan head.  After having this beer in countless pubs in Ireland and England, in bottles and on tap here in the states, and even sampled after a tour of the brewery at St. James Gate in Dublin, I must say I have a big fondness for this beer. Its calming and a pleasant palate cleanser. Bitterness is right on with nice roasted grain flavors.  Yeah, It may not be the best stout out there, and the taste may vary from country to country and even from bar to bar, and can sometimes taste weak, watery, light or too bitter sometimes,  I say what the hell, smile its Guinness, and it's good for you!  :-)",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Admiraldinty,3.61,"No where close to on tap. That being said, not too bad. Pours pitch black with a creamy tan head. Not too much going on in the nose. Some roasted malts and caramel, but very faint. Taste is not too bad for a nitro can. Usually they are very metallic tasting - particularly for pub ales, but this didn't real have that quality. Still, not too much flavor. Roasted malts, coffee, and faint chocolate. Silky-smooth mouth feel, medium bodied. Great drinkability due to low abv and low calories. All in all not bad, but I'm starting to get tired of these nitro cans.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,rastaman,1.42,"Taste just the same as the draught and can: Utterly revolting, thin, lightly roasty body meets with rancid bitterness, body is smooth and watery, not really a good example of a stout, although i'm sure once upon a time it was. It has a nice appearance though (deep black colour, with a nice creamy head). But besides that, this is easily the most overated beer on this site and on earth for that matter. Cat piss and vomit in one, the Budweiser of Stouts, gives stouts a bad name.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,budgood1,2.89,"11.2 oz bottle. ""serve extra cold"" ""drink straight from the bottle""  well i finally tried it. can't see the presentation, which counts for a lot. aromas are severely muted trying to shove the bottle up your own nose. some roasted malt notes. tastes ok, typical guinness flavors of slightly bitterly roasted malts. ok creamy mouthfeel, i guess the widget does an acceptable job of providing the famous texture. scores higher for drinkability; the bottle provides for portability and easy access without needing a glass...and it is pretty easy drinking.  all this said, a sixer of the these 11.2 oz bottles are the same price as a sixer of the 12 oz, tastier, higher ABV extra stout, so why bother? buy the nitro cans and drink it out of a glass, or just go to a reputable pub and get yourself a properly poured pint.  marketing gimmick. but i suppose i'd rather see people drinking this, in the hope it might turn whoever is drinking these nitro bottles onto better and bigger brews.  happy st. patrick's day!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,ADR,3.86,"On tap at the Liffey Irish Pub (another new lame Irish joint that counts Killians as Irish), St. Paul, MN...  Proper suspended carbonation, slowly cascading nitro creaminess with a solid hold of the upper head at 3/4 of an inch. Medium dark brown and clearish at the bottom. Slightly yeasty aroma, some sense3 of clotted cream. Milky mouthfeel, mocha java flavors, and a sudued sense of oily bitterness. More roast at the close. Somewhat surprisingly, this hit the spot better than I expected but there are definitely dryer versions of the Irish style. Happy St. Pat's Day...",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,slitherySOB,2.46,"Reviewed this on tap, now reviewed on can. Ugh, terrible when compared too nitro tap. Dark red/black colour when poured, with the fluffy cloud head I adore. Smell was similar too burnt toast. Some coffee, roasted malt, something sweet I couldn't put my nose too. Tasted boring. BTW, all 4 cans are gone. Unless I got 4 bad cans, this is an accurate review. Coffee, toffee, chocolate and more sweet malt, but not as much as from the cask. Terrible mouthfeel. Gritty. Like their was sand in my mug. Or sugar. Yes, it was a clean mug. Because of the gritty mouthfeel, it wasn't very drinkable. Very good on tap, not good from can. I'll try it from the bottle, for no other reason than too collect the cap. An overrated stout. Lacked the silk feeling I got from the cask, which was my biggest dissapointment.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,rabidawg,3.74,"Appearance: It's a nitro-poured Guinness. How much ""prettier"" does it get? A head that never quits, classic cascade, liquid black as coal; I can't ask for more as far as looks.  Smell: Burnt coffee and roasted malty notes.  Taste: Slight bitterness after the swallow. Thats the only thing separating this beer from chocolate milk, well, also without any of the heaviness associated with milk. This is a beer you can drink and drink, so it's my Wednesday night drink of choice. Join us at the Half Door if you'd like. We'll be in a booth in the back.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

Mouthfeel and smooth and creamy, probably greatly aided by the nitro.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It feels very creamy going down. Tastes good, but it is a bit too light to have the taste that we would want it to have. Perhaps a bit more like the extra stout, but we can't have it all.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Sixpack595,3.57,"Great looking beer, great head, good flavor. Best part about it is you can get it almost everywhere.Bad part is few sellers can pour a decent pint.

Well balanced mouthfeel, a little thin but flatter carbonation (which I like). Very smooth. Good versatile beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Bruiser81,3.41,"I reviewed this from a nitro bottle and I poured it into a glass even thought it says to enjoy it from the bottle. I love the look of Guinness, I couldn't resist. It still tasted pretty much like I remember it from the nitro can. An awesome looking brew with a thick creamy head that never dissipates. The nose is of roasted malts and a hint of chocolate. The taste is similiar with roasted malts up front followed by chocolate and a slightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is super smooth, but personally I like at least some carbonation. I could probably go with guinness as a session beer but it wouldn't be my first choice.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Redrover,3.86,"Black nitro can, good looking package!  The pour on this beer is awesome. Jet black color, creamy tan head and those great cascading bubbles. wonderful lace (or should I say priest's collar?) Great presentation. The smell is wonderful, toasted malts and a little smokiness.  The taste is very good. While there are better stouts, this is still a very good one. The malt is sweet but not cloying. The taste is just smoky enough to be good, but not over powering. Flavors come out more as it warms. Good taste can hold up to anything but really spicy food. This is great beer to cook with.  The mouthfeel is nice, I would prefer a little more substance and bite.  Some places serve this too cold. Don't be afraid to let it sit and warm-up. This is often one of the only decent beers a nonbeer bar or chain will have. Enjoy!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Stubbie1,4.03,"Pours a dark blackish brown and give off to the famous thick tan head that Guinness is known for. I love to watch the beer turn tan as the carbonation boils and turns to the head. The head slowly left leaving a thin lace behind. Roasted malts come to mind with a hint of coffee as you intake the aroma. The taste goes with the aroma, roasted malts and a slight bitter finish. I enjoy Guinness, even more from draft and will use this as my base line for other Stouts of this kind. Try it you will like it!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Bang34,4.11,"A must if you are at an Irish pub. The Flagship beer of Ireland and the leader of all souts, in most people's minds. This beer is just a joy to watch. After a pour I just love to watch it cascade up to a creamy brown head that sticks around until you finish the glass. Dark black in color, you can;t see through this, as it should be with any stout. When you sip it make sure to slurp a little of the head the creamyness give the beer a nice smooth start. The beer finishes with a slightly bitter aftertaste. But overall, the beer is not very complex and I prefer some American stouts over this one. I know that is sacrilige but remember, I still love this one.  The best out of a Nitro tap. It should take the bar tenderat least five minutes to poor this one with a couple settling pauses in order to get the glass full. If it is with you in 40 seconds beware. Guiness has made great advances in its Nitro can and bottling methods but stick with the tap on this one, it is the only way to go.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,Reidrover,3.86,It had been many years ( 12) since i had last tasted Guiness Draught( on tap in Scotland) so with trepidation i tried this nitro-can thingy. The appearance as always is wonderful..poured a lovelly coffee( with milk) colored froth which slowly clears upwards to reveal the blackness below..the head though not as large as i remember is a good half inch right to the bottom of the glass. Not much of a smell..very light scent of burnt oats ( I like this !) lovelly taste not as good as i remember on draught but not at all bad. good smooth feel in the mouth. i can drink this like milk..very very nice will buy more of this.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,WanderingFool,3.99,"I love hearing the pop and fizz when the can is opened as the nitrogen widget mixes with the beer. When poured into a glass the upward cascade of bubbles is a wonder to behold. The contrast of the black color of the beer and the ivory foam head scores highly with me. Guinness has a wonderful thick velvety mouth feel, nice creamy ivory colored foam head that remains on top of the beer while you drink it, and a well balanced flavor of sweet malts and bitter hops. The taste is somewhat dry, bitter, and a mixture of coffee and chocolate. I thought the aroma was rather ""bready"" which did not seem normal to me. Overall, the pub cans are my favorite way to enjoy Guinness at home.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,LarryKemp,4.38,The color was very dark and had a nice white head sitting upon a sea of white bubbles in dark beer. The head lasted a long time and the malty sweetness lasted throughout two LARGE draugts. The liquid clung to the tongue and finished with a dryness. The bite of the beer still clings to my tongue. It is by far my favorte beer when going to a bar that serves mainly mainstream beers.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,GreatPondBrewer,3.61,"This beer is beautiful. The reverse cascading is like a piece of live art. The head was thick(probably a little too, but it settled pretty well) and looked like a milkshake. The smell had some nice roasted overtones, but the first taste was a little disappointing without the complexity I was expecting. It was not at all bitter and left a nice taste in mouth. Over all a good beer, deserved of its reputation.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BeerManDan,2.8,"So much better the the Nitro swell of theirs. This poured a black color with a brown head of foam. The smell was not overly pleasant to me, but, I not a stout fan.

209,754,UncleJimbo,3.51,"Guinness Draught from a ""nitro bottle"" is a different animal than its nitro can and on-tap cousins. It is still a decent drink, but it is noticeably more bitter. This is perhaps intentional as this serving type is meant to be drunk from the bottle. A rather odd way to drink a stout, but it does mean that Guinness can now be sold at places that prefer to deal with bottles only (e.g., it has become popular in Las Vegas casinos). The mouthfeel and taste both suffer a bit in this version. The drinkability is still good, and this is still a pretty smooth beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,purplehops,3.77,"Nothing like the visual display of a nitro draught Guinness. The deep black opaque body and the creamy light tan head made up of so many tiny bubbles. What other beer can an artist draw and sculpt in the head? The aroma is faintly malty with notes of black malt and crispness to the aroma (the nitro perhaps?). The taste starts with a thick maltiness and finishes with a very dry bitterness. The aftertaste has some notes of coffee and carmel with a hint of chocolate but is overpowered by the black malt bitterness. Not a whole lot more to it. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth like a thin mousse. Not bad for something brewed by Labatt. For me Guinness Draught is a, ""so you don't have anything else beer"", or a lite beer (4.1%). I have had much worse and I have had some better.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,doho95fu,3.91,"Although I recognize the shortcomings of this beer, it remains one of my favorite stand-bys. The appearance of a well poured Guinness is really a thing behold with it dark brown color(near black color). A Guinness head should really be the standard for all stouts, brown, creamy, pillowy soft ---- Perfect. Unfortunately, the taste of Guinness does not match its presentation, it is a rather bland stout. It is good but not great, with coffee being the only real flavor I can discern. The mouthfeel is thin for a stout, but overall the brew is highly drinkable with a low ABV. I love it.... and can see its flaws, but it remains a favorite.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,tang214,3.75,"Honestly, I do not often drink stout beers. I am just not a big fan of the style, but this one definitely makes me have second thoughts. It pours from the bottle with a nice dark creamy color. In the glass it is very dark with hints of dark ruby coloring, if the light hits it right, and has an excellent thick creamy head that does not go anywhere until you start drinking. The smell is mostly cocoa with light hints of coffee and with hops right on top. The taste is also chocolatey with a superb combination of roasted malts. This brew is smooth in the mouth and goes down even smoother. The drinkability is good even though I am not a big fan of drinking more than one of these at a time, but that is just personal preference. Overall, this is an excellent beer and I would recommend it to anyone who has not yet tried it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,MJR,3.27,"Appearance: Let's face it...few beers look better than a 'draft' pint of Guinness. The creamy tan head, the deep black body, and sharp line between them...the classic, and perfect, look. A sight to behold...  Smell: Roasted grain, perhaps a touch of coffee, and nothing else. Remarkably average in it's aroma.  Taste: Roasted grain flavor with the smallest sour tang. The draft can version, in my opinion, doesn't come close to a real draft, as I think it sacrifices flavor for that perfect body.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, with a 'thin-but-somehow-creamy' mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Combine the laid-back flavor of this serving, the fantastic body, and the low alcohol content, and you have a good session beer.  While there are many stouts out there now that put Guinness (any version) to shame, it's still a classic worth re-visiting over and over... If you're going to drink one, do it right and get it straight from the tap.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

It has a creamy tan/beige color to it. The aroma is lighter. Hints of coffee, malt and light hops. The flavor is creamy with flavors of roasted malt and coffee.

209,754,yen157,3.01,"I like Guinness Draught much more than these scores indicate. The review is for the bottle and all remarks are going to be comparisons.  I had wanted to try GD in a bottle for some time now. Was it worth the wait? No, but I am glad I tried it. The ""rocket widget"" IMO was a waste of Guinness' time. Since the label states that the beer is meant to be drank straight from the bottle, most of the head inside will never reach the lips due to the angle of the bottle and the motion of the approching liquid. Also, unless you peel back the label you cannot see the surface of the liquid.  Anyway, the aroma, or al least what was sensed through the neck of the bottle, was really off. It was kind of cheesy, perhaps dried beer from bottling. As for taste, it was certainly different from true draught or even the can. There was less bitterness throughout the beer. However, it did have the lingering bitterness to the finish I had expected. Because of the lack of bittness, toasted grain flavors were more apparent. The body was a thinner than from can; both are thinner than nitro draught.  Overall, not a bad beer. I'm glad I tried it from the nitro bottle. If the time was right I may even purchase it again.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

The Guinnness tasted very watered down, and it seemed there was barely any in the bottle. I think they should end this ""sham"", they aren't fooling anyone.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,MaineBeerMan,3.71,"The best thing about this beer is that it looks great with its pure black color and nice beige head with the great cascading effect imparted by the nitro widget in the can. Has a nice aroma of sweet malt, but the smell is not as big as other stouts. The nitro widget gives this an extremely smooth, creamy mouthfeel, but the overall impression I get is kind of flat and lacking in body. Malty flavor without much sweetness, hints of chocolate and coffee, but overall seems watered down. I find that Guinness is very easy to drink, (sometimes even chug) but there are much better and more complex examples of the style out there. If you want a Guinness that will challenge your tastebuds, try the Extra Stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,TheLongBeachBum,3.91,"100'S of Reviews so far, so you all know what it looks, smells and tastes like already, yeah?. So I will spare you the details.  Guinness ""Draught"" (spelt properly as well ?! Oops sorry!) in a Can. So it's an Oxymoron I know ! - and one for which I would personally challenge them in Court... well OK, only if I had the money. I am English and a CAMRA member, and for me, Draught Beer ONLY comes from a Cask; Not a Keg, Can or even Bottle now I see. But I'm nit-picking and digress. Anyways, the beer pours black (news to you I know), with a nice tight brown nitrogenous head (yawn...). It looks great and very smooth (Huh, whats on TV...). But Hey!!, it goes down well !. I do not often drink Beer from a Can (this is someone elses but don't tell anyone) - Cans are ungainly receptacles, and a symbol of all that is wrong with mass-produced beer and the scourge of the true craft beer IMVHO (my psychic powers see RobBeers next Forum posting already !!!!). This actually tastes VERY GOOD, and I would contemplate parting with the Green Paper to buy it - well, if I was held at Gunpoint by a Rabid Psychopathic Machete Wielding Guinness Drinking MadMan, er.. Person, in the nearby 7-11. Only Kidding ;-) The Highest Mark I will ever give a Canned Beer !!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,aaronh,3.39,"While the nitro widget produces a wonderful looking head that resembles nitro-draught, the overall flavor of this beer seems a little simple. It is exceptionally creamy and drinks easily, but doesn't have the great flavour profile of the extra-stout. However, I have yet to experience any variation in quality as I sometimes do with the extra stout. A good substitute for real draught.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,BeerAngel,3.2,Just not a fan of this one. I picked this at a Mongolian restaraunt because the only other non-macro choice they had was Kirin's Lager. Poured a black coffee like color with a VERY cream tan head. Looks pretty nice. Smells of roasted malt with a little caramel. The taste is overwhelmed with the nitro creamy mouthfeel that just doesn't go well with this almost bland stout. The flavor has light hints of coffe and burnt chocolate and then there is that creamy aftertaste too. Middle of the road at best. Cheers!,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Lupe,4.04,"Pours black with a thick light tan head that lasts and lasts. Wonderful cake-like lace clings all the way down. Wonderful cascading as you wait for the head to form. This is what appearance is all about, makes my mouth water. Creamy mouthfeel, roasted flavors with hints of coffee. Finishes with some hops to balance and a little dryness. Highly drinkable, difficult to savor as it begs to go down all at once. great beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,beerbill,4.58,What can I say that hasn't been said before. This is simply an excelent beer. Guinness blends the perfect melody of bitter and creamy. It goes down easy and fast. If all of life was like a nice cold Guinness.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,doerickson,4.76,"Opaque black with a thick light tan head; I never get tired of watching the cascading as it's being poured and while it sits waiting for the head to form. No beer I've ever had has a creamier mouthfeel. Roasted flavors with notes of coffee. Couldn't ask for a more drinkable beer, never mind a more drinkable stout. I know that by true beer experts' standards (and I ain't hardly a beer expert yet) this is a fairly pedestrian stout, but I always enjoy it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,LarryV,3.83,"Excellent session brew since it has a lower alchohol content than a lot of other beers. Nice tight creamy tan head leaves lace all the way down the glass. Lighter body than what you would expect based upon the color. Almost black in color. Accents of smokiness come through in the taste. An enjoyable beer, and entertaining to watch as it cascades after the pour.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,brakspear,4.51,"Nice striking contrast: perfect pitch dark beer with creamy soft and smooth head, cascading nitro effect similar to hand-pulled beer. For a non-draft beer, it looks perfect. Little to no noticeable aroma at first but warms to a faint roasted sour scent. Taste is creamy but light, surprising those expecting a heavy beer. Unmalted barley taste evident and with slight sourness, finished with nice roasted taste. For a canned beer, I do not see how it can get any better....a session beer unlike any other.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Wildman,4.03,"Okay, this beer arrived a very dark brownish black color nd formed an off white head with little lace. It had an aroma malt, smoke and chocolate. The flavor was of malt and chocolate. The body was creamy and the finsh was chocolate with some smoke present.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,zerk,3.13,"The thing which stands out to me about Guiness is the way it looks. The head is so majestic, and the beer is opaque and dark as night. Unfortuanely the beer doesn't smell or taste quite as good as some other stouts. It's a creamy and full bodied beer, with a nice roasted malt aroma and flavor, and a nice upfront bite, but I find there to be a slightly unpleasant astringent aftertaste. And with it's low alcohol content, it's too filling to drink very much of it.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Dogbrick,4.21,A good on-deck beer if it is not available on draft. I can't get enough of the widgets! The major downside is there is a rather small window between too warm and too cold. It is also a little thinner than the draft offering.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,ryanocerus,4.32,"The first time I had this, I was in my ""quantity not quality"" phase. Drinking Bush and Bud at the time, I did not appreciate or enjoy it. Now ordering it is a joy. It poured with a thick off-white head and dark brown/near black color. There was a nice malty aroma. The first roasty flavored drink left excellent lacing. This is an excellent choice when the other options are the macros. I enjoy it even though it is not my style of choice.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,goindownsouth,4.31,"One of the best beers in the world, yet still an acquired taste. It is dark at the pour with no visability through it. The head is thick and apparent throughout the glass. Guinness' aroma is high with a coffee and dark chocolate tinge. From the first sip, this stout is satisfying and very much of a knife-and-fork mentality. A true beer fan must try this classic. I know it is rare for someone to give this brew a ""5,"" especially someone who has tried as alot of different brews. But I cannot lie. This is my favorite. When I go to my favorite haunt, I get great pleasure from watching a PROFESSIONAL tap me a quality pint, the proper way. In my mind. It is THE beer in my book. Bottoms Up!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,tigerpaws,4.06,"While the stout style is not my favorite, I do enjoy a good one occasionaly. The appearance of Guiness as always is as always exceptional. Not for the novice beer drinker, your typical mass produced drinker needs to work their way to this one. Of course alot of the appeal has to do with the pour, a bartender that doesn't know what he/she is doing can ruin this beer. If your half irish like I am you can't help but love Guiness, I tend to want to drink it when listening to a U2 cd......CHEERS",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,StevieW,4.38,"On tap...Jensen Beach Ale House....The best beer served at my local bar. Nice deep dark color, thick, bubbly tan head. I love the cascading effect. Nice coffee, faint chocolate smells. Taste is creamy, silky smooth. Noticable chocolate malt, slight creamy sweetness. When fresh and poured properly is one of the best mass produced beers available. Noticably better on tap, than the bottle widget.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,frank4sail,3.83,"Strange pour, but does settle like a nirto-can and does create the beautiful beige 1/4 inch head. Opeque black/tan color. It is not as good as the can or draught but it is still guinness. I am not letting the other guinness products cloud my judgement... it is above average in comparison to the style and other Stouts. I don't know why they reccomed to serve ""very cold"" or tell you to actually ""drink it from the bottle""? The smooth roast malt flavor is still there though... The brew also seems slightly thinner than the can or draught versions. It is much superior to the regular bottle version!",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Bierman9,4.03,"Reviewed approx 12FEB02.... Half the enjoyment of this beer is watching the pour and head form! Creamy head....mmm, on a jet-black body. Nice coffee-ish nose. Body is actually not as full as you'd expect by looking at it, but does have a great smoothness. More roasty-coffee flavors, and a bit dry in the finish. A pleasure to quaff, though I don't hold it as highly as I did years ago!  overall: 4.1 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4  44",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Skywave,3.79,"Here's the nitro can perspective on Guinness: It suffers in the can. Perhaps it has something to do with the packaging methods. The canned product says that it is pasteurized, which can affect flavor adversely. Secondly, when tasted side by side with the Beamish nitro can stout, it tastes harsher and less appealing than Beamish .",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,mickeymac,4.1,"A properly poured Guinness is really tough to beat. It's got that beautiful dark brown, almost black color, and that one of a kind head that makes you want to dig in with a spoon. The flavor is complex yet understated and subtle. It's rich and creamy and goes down with a silky perfection. Just the thought of it makes me want to run to the nearest pub.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,marc77,2.91,"Beautifully thick, dense tan head as expected. Intricate lace is left down the glass. Deep garnet hue and very clear when held to a light. Typically attractive for Guinness. Malt notes are mild in aroma and are comprised of a hint of sharp, dark roasted barley sharpness, and a hint of chocolate malt. Light diacetyl comes through as the beer warms. Roasted grain bitterness dominates the flavor, while hop bitterness seems to be more subdued when compared to draught Guinness. Typically smooth nitro/CO2 mix induced mouthfeel. The finish is soft, w/ less residual roasted grain bitterness than the draught version. It's an okay dry stout, but even canned Guinness seems to have more character.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,jreitman,4,"Everyone knows Guinness so I won't get too detailed. Guinness is my default beer when having quests as it is usually amenable to all. Dark black with an o' so creamy head. Nice roasted character. A very good beer, especially considering the volume it is produced in.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,psugrad98,3.18,"Dark brown/black. Thick head. Cascading bubbles is a sight to see. Smooth and dry with a slight bitter finish. A hint of dark toasted malts. Not quite as complex as I'd like, but maybe its just the lack of traditional carbonation that freaks me out.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,stoutman,4.15,"In each country the beer varies a bit to meet the local tastes but the American version is deep black in color, with a dense tan head of foam that lasts until the bottom of the glass. This stout also features a surprisingly fruity aroma amidst the massive roasted malt nose. Deep, rich, and bitter with tinges of sourness and flavors of dark roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and malt. The version in the draught-can is somewhat thinner in body and less fruity and therefore more drinkable.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,Suds,2.74,"I had a Guinness on tap after a round of golf this week. I couldn't believe how disappointed I was. This brewery gets credits for its longevity and ingenuity. The beer has few flaws, but its boring. It simply isn't an interesting brew. The nitrogen-induced head is a gimmick, and the character has been dumbed down for Budweiser tastes. Go for the extra stout bottle if you insist on Guinness. Or, better yet, go for a local or regional craft stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,ORM1,5,"As to me I drank this Guinness Draught in ""export-to-Finland"" variant. This is a black (what else color should it be? :) ) 33 cl can with pour instructions in Finnish and English. Importer is Hartwall OY (www.hartwall.fi) But ABV is 4,2% not 4,1%.  What can I say about the beer? Even nothing to say: just the stout like it ought to be: smoth, creamy, ground, roasted malt, vivid hops, coffee and chocolate. Every taste sight is separate and at the same time all are combined in a harmony. I can drink it endlessly... That's why I always buy not more than 3 cans a time :)",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,Viking,4,"After looking at some of the other reviews, I felt I should try pouring this into a glass for a review. Partially because I thing drinking from the bottle is rather barbaric...Much better, I'm not sure what it is exactly, but it seems the beer/nitro seem to blend and settle better when poured. I've actually experienced similar effects with a 'bad pour' of Guinness off the tap. Though this beer is meant to be drunk straight from the bottle, I recommend pouring it into a glass, just as you'd do with the Nitro can. You will not be sorry.  Out-o'-the-bottle review: I didn't try it before last night, because there's just something wrong with drinking from the bottle. You don't get to see the beer. You miss out on 99% of the aroma...It's just plain barbaric. So, yeah this is a tough beer to rate. Couldn't see it, couldn't really smell it. It tasted OK, but compared to the Guinness I had off-the-tap earlier in the evening, it was rather lacking. (1, 1.5, 3.5, 3, 2.5)",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,packetknife,3.8,It's ~different~ compared to on-tap but I find it much better than the nitro-can. I'm suprised by the poor reviews. Let it infuse for a minute or two before your first sip.,Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,IrishRedRock,3.82,"Guinness is definitely an acquired taste, as are many darker beers. Being that it is everywhere, I finally got the palate for it, and now it seems like a very light beer in comparison to many. The appearance, when poured correctly, is pure perfection. It's like a painting. Smooth as any beer you can find, creamy, with mild bitter notes of chocolate and roasted malt. After a few is rather filling, but I would not say it is a heavy beer at all. Finally have sampled Guinness in Ireland, and I don't know if it's the atmosphere of that beautiful country or the wonderful pubs and people, but Guinness is one of the most enjoyable things in Ireland, more than anywhere else. Not the most flavorful of stouts by any stretch of the imagination, but a classic in its own right.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,cokes,2.4,"Who's idea was this? Is this a joke? I feel like someone over at St James is doubled over in laughter: ""People in America will actually buy this to drink straight from the bottle! Ha"".  The bottle presentation robs Guinness of it biggest asset. That being its magnificent appearance. No aroma either. Maybe because of this, it seemed less creamy and less robust. Almost like a Guinness light. Strangely, the taste seemed to improve once I removed the silly shrinkwrap around the bottle. I guess it shows that taste is at least partially mental. But honestly, the shrinkwrap was offensive, the fake poured pint look doesn't cut it with me. The rocket-widget-dildo thing was aggrevating as well.  What is most important is that this is not nearly as good as the draught version, or the canned version. When I want a Guinness, I sure as hell don't want to suck it out of a bottle. What's next? Guinness 40's?",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82

209,754,aracauna,3.71,"Quite frankly, I think Guinness is overrated. Don't get me wrong, it's a good beer, very much above average, but if I have the choice of the two I'll take Beamish. It's still a good stout, but if you stick it next to a Shakespeare Stout, it's no contest. Still, Guinness is a good measuring stick for the style since (at least from what I read on this site) it was the first stout as Guinness wandered deeper into the black as their porter transformed into the first stout.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
209,754,jackndan,4.63,"The true pub classic. I have spent more time studying this beer than any other. I judge local pubs on how well they draw the pint, and spent two days in Dublin comparing the pint at the Guinness brewery to its competitors. This is the only beer I know that can be a 3 (due primarily to disappointment) at one establishment and the perfect 5 at another.

But who cares, this stuff is to be consumed from the bottle not a glass so I had to give a 1 for appearance. Aroma was skunky in the bottle and in a glass. Flavor, what flavor, watery. Was best when ice cold (crappy when not ice cold.) Weak, thin and flat. Label should say ""Watery Guinness Light"". Screw the widget rocket. Maybe I had a six that was stored upside down and the nitro escaped into the bottle so when I opened it up, the nitro got out causing a flat and tasteless beer.

This is made spacifically to drink out of the bottle which is shrink wrapped so you can not see the beer at all. The smell and tast are good for the style but this ""Draught"" stuff is just too thin.

209,754,Todd,3.2,"Presentation: 14.9fl oz can with a built in widget (they call theirs the ""Guinness Floating Draft System"") for that ""draught-like"" quality. No freshness date.  Appearance: Absolutely pitch black with an amazing cascading effect. As the nitro-injection settles it forms a perfect finger width, creamy, foamy, tight off-white head. It's sticks to the glass and the head consistency remains all the way to the bottom of the glass.  Smell: Very pleasant aroma of sweet and roasted malts. Faint caramel note with a finishing of smoked malt.  Taste: Silky smooth mouthfeel, tremendously creamy -- so much so that I always find it difficult to not simply chug the beer in one swallow. Malt is nicely roasted with little astringency. The roasted malts give off coffee, slight chocolate and mild smoked flavors. Things dry up after this, then follows a watery-like floral hop flavor. There's a slight bite, for a brief second, that combines with a touch of roasted malt astringency. The unique roasted flavor carries through as a foundation from beginning to end. Body is medium. Finishes with a delicate roasted and dryness.  Notes: What can I say? It's not the most remarkable Stout that I've ever had. It's not very exciting compared to its siblings (yes, even on tap in Ireland). Apart from ""Guinness"" (the tap version) this is Guinness' top selling beer, and the most consistent as it's all too easy these days to get an inconsistent poured pint of Guinness. Personally I enjoy and appreciate the Extra Stout and Foreign Extra Stout 10 times more, but you'll find me slumming it on occasion. A mediocre beer.",Guinness Ltd.,Ireland,Irish Dry Stout,82
