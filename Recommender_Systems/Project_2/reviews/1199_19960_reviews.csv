1199,19960,skisonic,4.73,"Pours a thick murky dark cola brown with a healthy head. Smells of tree bark, chocolate, coffee. Medium-heavy mouth-feel, not as thick as some but still a nice heaviness. Complex taste, a little more on the coffee side than than others. Pungent on the tongue, dank and earthy yet still shocked at it being a 12%",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Neelbeer,4.39,"I thought the B stands for bourbon, but apparently stands for breakfast. At any rate: Nose: Smells like bourbon; you can smell the alcohol more than you can taste it here. Chocolate, sweet toffee, vanilla, burnt wood, soy sauce. Taste: Quite luxurious, very smooth for %12, though you do get a bit of that alcohol burn in throat and chest. Bourbon, lots of chocolate, charcoal, coffee that comes out more and more as the beer warms. A little bit carbonated, which is very much appreciated in such a rich stout. Not too sweet, not too bourbon-y. Very nice. Not as complex or aristocratic as Goose Island (though also for a quarter of the price), but it's very good.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,BitteNochEinWeissbier,4.31,"12 oz bottle Bottled On Date: 02.03.2021 Consumed on: 07 Feb, 2023 Glass: Snifter ABV: 12% Serving Temp: room temp   Look: Opaque black with a 2+ finger creamy light brown head. The head dissipates to a thick ring and thin cover. The lacing is good.  Smell: A goodly amount of semi-sweet chocolate combine with bittersweet chocolate and some coffee. Light notes of vanilla. A touch of oak and bourbon.  Taste: Follows the nose but with the coffee more pronounced and noticeable as are the bourbon notes. An earthy note shows up after mid-sip and lingers into the aftertaste alongside the coffee. Nicely balanced and not cloying. The alcohol can be noticed a bit and provides a nice warming sensation.  Feel: Smooth, silky and mouth-coating. Noticeable warmth from the alcohol. The body is medium-full.  Overall: An excellent Imperial Stout and a great sipper. Complex but not overly so. Very well done. The unintended 2 years in the cellar may have led to a reduction in the coffee and some of the bourbon and the barrel but this is still a tremendous beer. For what this beer is (a 12% coffee/chocolate/barrel ages IS) it is insanely drinkable.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,dano213,4.29,"12oz bottle received as a gift from a friend. Bottled on 02.28.22, so this is almost 11 months (10 months and 20 days) old.  Look: A fairly aggressive pour yields a nice one-finger of light-brown colored head with mostly small bubbles. The head gradually receded to hold around a quarter of a finger tall. The beer is very dark, almost black and appears to be somewhat viscous. Looks like a very nice bourbon-barrel aged imperial stout.  Smell: Strong, expressive aromas of bourbon and charred oak up front. It definitely smells boozy. Secondary notes of dark, alcohol-soaked cherries, coffee, rich dark chocolate, and vanilla. Halfway through, a nice note of a bit of sweet amaretto comes through also.  Taste: Really flavorful and luxuriously smooth. Something else that I am initially impressed with is the relatively high level of carbonation for a barrel-aged beer, which really helps prevent this beer from becoming overly sweet or thick on the palate. The finish lingers long; eventually I get charcoal notes well after my last sip. Bourbon spirit notes are very strong and a bit overpowering in my opinion. The decadent coffee and chocolate notes that were so present in Founders Breakfast Stout get lost in the crowd here.  Feel: Has a velvety smooth texture with a medium to full body. Carbonation is relatively high for a barrel-aged imperial stout and it works well here.  Overall: I have had KBS before but this is my first KBS review and my first tasting of the 2022 version. My overall impression of this is that it is very good. However I feel that it falls short compared to the base version of Founders Breakfast Stout, which I only had for the first time last month and I found it to be really delicious and impressive. This is still really good, yet I find the bourbon notes to be so strong, almost overpowering. Even though this was bottled almost 11 months ago, the bourbon notes are still super strong. I suppose if you really like bourbon, then this would be right up your alley. Personally, while I really do enjoy bourbon-barrel aged beers I do find that bourbon can be a bit harsh for my taste so I prefer Founders' base beer in this case. I will say that this this beer benefits greatly from coming to room temperature. I took it out of the fridge and waited several hours before I opened it, but it was probably still too cold initially.  From the bottle: The beer that taught us that patience truly is a virtue. This big, bold imperial stout is brewed with premium chocolate and coffee then aged in bourbon barrels that introduce powerful notes of vanilla, cocoa, and charred oak. KBS is a luxuriant, full-bodied drinking experience that emanates sophistication while honoring our craft beer roots.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,AzfromOz,4.66,"Received from @turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022. Drunk in January 2023.  L: Jet black, with a thin rim of tan head. Carbonation is visible if you look hard.  S: Huge hit of roasted coffee and chocolate. A savoury/soy/umami note, as well as booze and barrel, come out as it warms.  T: Big chocolate and coffee notes as per the nose. Vanilla and barrel come out as it warms. Retronasal booze is noticeable but pleasant. Residual stickiness after the swallow. Very dangerous for a 12% beer. Delicious.  M: Mouthfeel is smooth, silky and sticky, faultlessly matching the rest of the beer.  O: This is the only beer I've given a 5 on Untappd. I'm probably a harsh marker, but I'll give it a 4.75 when I check this one in. The main reason is that in hindsight I've had beers just as good as this one and only given them a 4.75. so in that case, what's a 5? Dunno. The theory is I'll know it when I encounter it.

Delightful Smell: IMO this is the best part of the KBS. Comes off almost like a Mexican hot chocolate with deep chocolate notes, some small cinnamon hints. Booziness apparent from the scent. Taste: Matches the smell nearly to a T. Heavy alcohol heat throughout with the chocolate notes brightening as it leaves your mouth. Just like a barrel stout should be. Quite sweet, but even as someone who doesn’t love sweet beers, it’s great. Feel: Carbonation is quite low, so the combination of the stout density and boozy heat creates a rather unique, slick feel in the mouth. High sugar content seems to be enhanced by the slick feel. Overall: King of barrel aged stouts for me. Great stuff",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,LukeCov49,4.44,"Preface by saying I’m not the biggest stout fan.  Bottled 12/4/2021 poured straight from the fridge into a frosted glass. Started around 48° and it was very closed up. Still able to get all the main notes of coffee, dark chocolate, and bourbon, but they were nowhere near as strong until the beer warmed up. My favorite temp was about 55-60° but I sipped until it hit closer to 70°  Overall: Incredible stout. Loads of separate flavors that all come together perfectly!  L: pitch black color, can’t even see light coming through when held up to a lamp. Toasted brown head with good retention and lacing from top to bottom.  S: at first I got more chocolate than anything else, but as the beer warmed up 5-10° I got a much darker chocolate and strong coffee notes followed by bourbon on the end. Chocolate heavy overall  T:cold straight from the fridge at 48° I got some coffee and chocolate and maybe some black licorice with a heavy hit of alcohol at the end. As the beer warmed up the alcohol completely disappeared. Strong coffee flavor followed by dark chocolate and some nice bitterness that you would get from a nice piece of dark chocolate. Bourbon follows on the aftertaste. Slightly sweet at first with a bitter ending. Some roasted malt, but coffee and chocolate are by far the strongest notes.  F: low carbonation, thicker and slightly creamy without being overly heavy. Very smooth",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,Christianriveraaa,4.62,"This is my second review:  L: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass - huge head risen. About 4 fingers length to be approximate. a bit of lacing left behind while resolving to liquid form. S: Getting some sweet bourbon on the nose with some chocolate, molasses, slight coffee there in the back. Also getting some dark fruits such as apricots, figs, as well as some vanilla. Very nice! T: Taste follows the bourbon in the initial note but then you get big amounts of coffee, with chocolate, molasses, dark fruits, vanilla. Getting some woody tastes in here too. Very complexed beer and you can almost taste something different each taste if you try to focus on it. F: Full bodied, medium to high acidity, light to medium carbonation, this is a sipper. Alcohol is present for sure. O: This is a classic. With the complexity of the beer - even as it warms you get a different taste - it's no wonder it's a world class for beer/stout drinkers. I'd definitely be buying again and would recommend to anyone who is into barrel aged beers/ wants to explore that route. The first time I tried this (3 years back) when I first started drinking stouts, I didn't like this due to thinking the alcohol was overpowering. As I got more into stouts I really appreciate this and see how it's world class.

1199,19960,Perioddicals,3.72,"I recently tried and reviewed Founders - Breakfast Stout, which is also highly regarded. Similar to that review, I will state that I actively dislike coffee. Both the taste and the smell. So I don't foresee me falling in love with this beer, but I did want to try it out to see what all the fuss was about.  L - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass at roughly 55 degrees. The beer pours a dark black opaque. Very thin film of tan head which quickly faded to bubbles. The thin head only leaves moderate lacing.  S - The roasted coffee comes up front with a slight hint of chocolate. Not much else. It's pretty much straight-up coffee smell.  T - The coffee roast comes up front, then fades to a chocolate. There’s a little bit of cola flavor there too. The flavor is then balanced with a slight bourbon at the end. Aftertaste is a mild coffee roast. Toward the end of the beer though, the coffee notes fade a little and the chocolate notes take center stage. The taste is much more complex and pleasing than the smell.  F - The carbonation is almost like a cola. Smooth texture overall. Easy to drink.  O - Again, I tried this a week after trying Founders Oatmeal Stout. From memory, they are very similar. (Not sure about side-by-side comparison.) As I stated in that previous review, I do not like coffee. Taste or smell. But these were so highly regarded that I had to try them. I still don’t prefer the coffee taste, but this is still a great beer. Very smooth flavors that go together well. The 12% alcohol did not make this boozy at all. It was all flavor and no sign of high alcohol. I personally won’t try this again, but for a coffee drinker, this would be a fantastic beer.  Again, in all honestly, I don't like coffee one bit. The smell, the taste, all of it. But after the initial coffee hit, this was a great beer with balanced flavors.

S - Deep dark chocolate with a bourbon base. Freshly-roasted espresso beans. It smells like it's going to be very rich... T - That was intense. Dark chocolate punches you, then kisses you with a nice roasted coffee with chicory, then kicks you in the balls with the bourbon. The ABV isn't noticeable until the end of the glass, but by time that happens you feel insanely warm already. Well-balanced all around, and each note is plain and simple - no deciphering here!

S Alcohol first, actual malt structure is lost beneath adjuncts and barrel aromas. Coffee note seems stale. T Taste follows smell, except surprisingly and unpleasantly bitter. Very little evidence of malt or hops. F Very little creaminess, thin and effervescent. O The high sticker price must cover all of those additional ingredients and aging in barrels because the malt and hops don't seem to be substantial enough or high enough quality to justify it.  Tried this again at 55°F, since some beers sweeten up and seem to lose bitterness slightly warmer. This one did not.  The high average rating must be owing to people mistaking heavily flavored beer for good quality beer. Definitely less than the sum of its parts and I can't get past the sickly bitter note that persists from first sip and lingers as an aftertaste.

1199,19960,blazerkor,5,It smells like coffee and bourbon.  There is the sweet woody smell of the bourbon backed up by the bold coffee stout.  It tastes sweet up front with a punch of liquor and then it's like a bitter bold chocolaty coffee.  It's so much like Founders Breakfast Stout but just stronger in every way.  It's got a medium body and is smooth in every way. The bubbles are smooth the liquid itself is smooth and then the finish is smooth bitterness and a little bit of wood.  Wow that's delicious.  It's better than the Mackinac Fudge and the Espresso varieties that I thoroughly enjoyed before ever having the real thing.

KBS excels in nearly every conceivable metric from a stout lovers' perspective, and while I don't advocate for using alcohol to influence your emotions on a regular basis, Founders KBS truly has made me happy every. single. time. I have consumed it. Every bottle – at least once, causes me to stop and appreciate how good it really is.

Wish I could do this live, but here it unfolds as it happens. Taken from frig, very small pfftt as I pop the cap. Pours into glass...very dark color...head and legs like Marilyn Monroe...nice but getting old. Aroma a bit malty, but my sniffer pretty much got snuffed decades ago. Carbonation tingles the tongue, chocolate is there but not a Willy Wonka dream. One reviewer claims it improves as it warms, so I'll try to resist guzzling for now, but it's good stuff. Definitely smoother as it warms, and more bourbon and coffee flavors. Getting frothy as I swirl it in mouth. Given it's a ""breakfast Stout"", would probably be good with pancakes. Definitely better as it heats to room temperature ( or at 12% ABV, maybe it's me). Feed the cats (they love it when I sit on the floor). Beer warms some more. Chocolate seems more pronounced now. Only a few swigs left...will be sorry to see it go.  Overall: Definitely an experience. Great brew, although questionable if it beats my fav quaff. Certainly leaves you with a buzz.

Nicely, this brew, clocking in at 12.3% alcohol, manages to NOT taste ""boozy"" (the totally sugar masking that). Mouth-feel is creamy and full.

There is a hint of sweetness but I certainly wouldn't call this beer sweet. I don't get much of the coffee flavor personally. I'd say the chocolate flavor is the stronger one. But bittersweet chocolate. The barrel flavor is there in the start and the finish but not overwhelming. It just gives the whole thing a nice edge and a long, warming finish.  It's full bodied and just a tiny bit viscous, but not at all syrupy. Just right for washing around your mouth for maximum flavor.

1199,19960,LeRose,4.66,"This beer is a perfect pour from the large format bottle at refrigerator temperature into the Duvel tulip, it is a rich, chocolate brown, viscous-looking delight with an ample tan/brown head that lasts forever, never quite falling completely even as the beer warmed.  The smell is at first chocolate-dominant, but as it warmed up the rest of the team came to play. Coffee, ample bourbon barrel notes, and the malt isn't hidden - you can still smell a strong contribution from the roasted malts. As the beer warms, the aroma just explodes - a variety of chocolate-like aroma, fresh-brewed coffee that seems espresso-like, caramel, brown sugar/molasses, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and just a hint of boozy alcohol that is otherwise quite well and deceptively hidden.  The taste developed in a similar fashion - chocolate at first with the coffee and bourbon coming in behind. But this opens up with warmth just as the aroma did becoming a multi-layered taste experience. It's deep, rich, and complex. Yet it is not so complex that you can't just sip and enjoy if you turn off trying to analyze it. Everything comes through and is discernible, then it's gone and you need to go back for another sip. For all the intense flavor this carries, it is not cloying and overpowering - somehow to me it is still a ""clean"", unmuddied flavor overall. The bitter and sweet is on point and completely balanced, as are all the flavors - there's nobody sticking out as it is all fantastically blended.  The feel is smooth and silky with just a bit of chalkiness. There's enough bitter to notice, but it doesn't carry over with much of an aftertaste. The carbonation is low to moderate - just enough to liven the beer just ever so slightly and not interfere. Slightly drying on the finish.  Overall this is a tremendous beer that delivers wave after wave of aroma and flavor to just sit and enjoy. The changes on warming were particularly enjoyable.

Overall delicious, and held up to the hype. Slightly less sweet than I was expecting. The maple flavor was hard to detect. As others have suggested, this may be the result of 1 year in the bottle. I subsequently tried a KBS and, all things considered, liked the KBS better. It's hard to pin down exactly how I preferred the KBS, but it was generally fresher. Not sure if due to year to year batch variation (the KBS was a 2020 bottling, drunk < 3 weeks from bottle date), or due to the 1 year bottle age on the CBS.""",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The nose is quite complex dominated by dark chocolate, with hints of coffee and Bourbon. The taste is very rich as well with chocolate being the main flavor, but the coffee becomes more apparent as it warms. Once the beer reaches a room temperature the vanilla and Bourbon and a woody like taste come through very clearly. The beer feels like a thick sludge consistency-- almost like Hershey's syrup being added to a beer, but not in a bad way. The high alcohol content is not apparent when it is cooler, but I'd recommend having it just below room temp to really enjoy it as it becomes very boozy and Bourbony at room temp and greater.

If I need an excuse, then it's that finding a KBS after a decade is reason enough to celebrate.  Appearance - Pours large 2-3 finger brown-tan pancake batter head with good retention and decent to good stick with irregular lacing, possibly due to the irregular, but sometimes large bubbles. Body is completely black and opaque. Even with backlight. Even with my more powerful cellphone flash as a backlight, not even a faint red dot appears. Nothing. Probably the darkest most opaque beer I've ever seen. Impressive. Lacing evens out and stick overlaps and builds over time. Very impressive. 5  Smell - Toasted coffee and chocolate and cream. Some alcohol comes through especially with swirls. Some? I should say a lot of alcohol, really. No off tones. Fairly smooth texture despite the harsh compounds involved here. 5  Taste - A complex explosion of flavors. ""Oh ho ho ho!"" was my first reaction. There's just so much going on. Immediately bitterness, alcohol, dark roasted coffee, more alcohol, more bitterness. Faint hints of chocolate and spices. The back label says 12.3% alc/vol and you can definitely notice the alcohol. Harsh at first but again as the alcohol warms it smooths out considerably. Don't chug this one, let it breathe! 5  Mouthfeel - Warming. Full bodied. Creamy head. Astringent and harsh with alcohol. As the beer warms slightly and the head disperses, the harshness subsides and it smooths out a bit. 5  Overall - While this beer is enjoyable from the first sip, I was somewhat underwhelmed until the beer had time to breathe a little, and it found a balance between its characters. The harshness died out and it slowly became more luxurious as I began to take smaller, slower sips. I think that's another issue, I was taking normal beer sips. This beer requires sips about 1/4 the normal size. Then you can really experience it without having your senses being overloaded by the intensity. But consider that this is 3x the alcohol of a light beer, so there's really no hurry. Not the best beer I've ever had, but considering I'm rating within style, and this is the best in style I've had, I have no choice but to give it perfect scores across the board. 5",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,osheamatth,4.24,"It's hard to knock and acclaimed brew but it falls more to, I just am not a fan of the style than to this is a bad beer...because it's clearly not a bad beer. The look is epic - black like Texas crude, with little to no discernible head and zero lacing. Do I fault a stout for no head and lacing? Yeah, I think I do. But the look of the liquid itself, again, is quite beautiful. The chocolate and the coffee are evidently apparent in the bouquet, the bourbon barreling - not so much. There's expected and ample malt which i can only assume went through some kind of caramelization because caramel is clearly there. The thing that gets me sometimes about the high alcohol roasted and flavored stouts is the lose of purity. I can enjoy these sometimes. Sometimes a fruit flavored sour ale is good too. But I like my beer to taste like beer, regardless of the style. The tastes notes directly follow the nose and adds some vanilla, charcoal but it finishes with a noticeable, and for me not enjoyable, alcohol bite. One prop I'll give this beer is that it is not cloyingly sweet, which I fully expected. I don't think I've ever rated a brew with such a wide berth of scores.

The head had moderate retention to it and had a pretty nice diversity of micro and rocky bubbles making it look very appealing.  Notes of coffee, roasted sweet malts, chocolate, and a bit of bourbon filled my nose upfront. I expected more of a barrel-forward aroma but was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't too overpowering and the coffee and chocolate characters were able to shine on the front of the aroma. I got more of the bourbon aroma in the back-end, which was coupled with a roasty herbal coffee and a slight earthy oak note.  Upfront on the taste I got notes of cocoa, herbal/earthy cold brew coffee, and bourbon. The bourbon was present pretty much from start to finish but it didn't overwhelm any of the other flavors of this beer. I tasted more of the sweetness from the roasted malts in the middle but this subsided a bit in the end when I just got cocoa nibs and an espresso-like bitterness.  The aftertaste on this was pretty bitter overall, leaving you with tastes of coffee, chocolate, and bourbon which weren't very lingering. This beer is pretty warming on the throat and chest but I couldn't really taste the alcohol at all; this along with being full-bodied and low in carbonation makes this super silky smooth and dangerously drinkable.  I loved this beer, it has everything I typically like in an imperial stout: big notes of coffee and chocolate with a bit of sweetness and bourbon that aren't overpowering. Smooth, velvety, and easy to drink, I definitely had to slow down and remind myself to only sip on this and let it breathe.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,JJKBeerLvr,4.92,"Poured from a bottle into pint glass in May 2020. There was a bottled on date of 2/20/2020 @ 10:31, so the beer was about 3 months old.  Appearance: Very dark black with a thick dark brown head. Head was about 2 fingers high, and lasted a minute. It leaves only a little lacing on the glass, and ended with a thin tan head still on the beer.  Smell: Excellent aroma mix of coffee, chocolate, and bourbon. There is also some vanilla, caramel, and some other sweet aroma like black licorice, but overall the coffee and chocolate dominate the others. It is a very nice balance of aromas, and I expected the bourbon to dominate which is did not.  Taste: There is a nice balance between the coffee, bourbon, and sweetness like chocolate and licorice flavors. There is some smokie roasted flavors, some caramel and vanilla flavors, and a little amount of bitter hop flavors to enhance the taste and add some complexity. There is a strong alcohol presence, which matches the 12% on the label, but it is balanced nicely by the sweetness. The taste is an excellent mix.  Mouth-feel: Thick like liquid licorice, but with a smooth body. Not overly smooth like a Milk Stout.  This is an excellent, complex, Imperial Stout, and it has a variety of flavors that adds a nice complexity to the beer. Although this is a big beer, it is very smooth and enjoyable to drink. This chocolate sweetness nicely contrasts the bourbon flavor, and is a nice balance to the high alcohol content. This is one my favorite Founder's stout, and one of my favorite stouts overall. I just wish it was not so expensive.  UPDATE: I bought 4-packs of both Founder's CBS (vintage 10.09.19) and KBS (vintage 02.26.20) for a side-by-side taste test. My previous impressions that these are both excellent beers was confirmed. KBS has more of a kick with the bourbon flavor. The CBS is a little smoother and has a little more sweetness from the maple syrup flavors. I give the CBS a very slight edge over the KBS since I prefer the balance of the CBS a little more, but I would gladly drink either of these anytime, and may prefer one over the other on any day depending upon my mood.  My current favorite stouts in order are: Founder's CBS Founder's KBS Goose Island Beer's Bourbon County Brand Stout Weyerbacher's Sunday Morning Stout Fegley's Bourbon Barrel Aged Insidious Hoppin' Frog's BORIS Oatmeal Imperial Stout - Barrel Aged Sierra Nevada Barrel-Aged Narwhal Avery Bourbon Barrel-Aged Czar Imperial Stout Founders Breakfast Stout",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S: Bourbon jumped off the glass with more subtle roasted notes. Didn't pick up as much of the sweeter notes of chocolate and coffee that others talk about. They were there, but not as aggressive as I've read in other reviews.

Personally, I liked the punch of coffee in the KBS Espresso and the slightly richer and sweeter taste of CBS. But this was terrific too - its coffee taste and smell is more muted, but still present. The bourbon barrel flavor is very obvious, but it avoided becoming too bitter or too saccharine. What impresses me about this series of beers in general is how much flavor is in there without having an overly thick or syrupy body. It's still a relatively light-bodied stout that goes down easily.

Pours a dark brown, with two fingers of dense, creamy, darker than khaki head. Strong lacing. Very nice looking. Reminiscent of their Imperial Stout.  Nose is chocolate and coffee for days. Some heat from the oak, a subtle touch of vanilla. A very rich and balanced presence. Nothing dominates too strongly. There's a lot of room for everything to move around and breathe.  Taste is dark chocolate covered coffee beans. Nice bitterness. Reminds me of Nickel Brook's Cafe Del Bastardo. Oak and bourbon come in afterwards creating a warmth and drying quality. Booze is present for a brief moment. The wood/bourbon is quite detailed. An enjoyable lingering aftertaste. Vanilla persists very mildly throughout creating a bright sweetness that balances out the dark, richness of this brew.  Mouthfeel is medium to fullbodied with mild to medium carbonation. It feels very light on the tongue. Not quite as dense as their Imperial Stout. The 12% ABV creates a evaporating/drying quality on the tongue.  Overall another great Founders brew. Well balanced and very drinkable. I really don't need to sing their praises any more than I already have.

It pours dark, very dark and has a fair head and smooth aroma, typical of bourbon barrel aged stouts. The taste, when fresh, to me is too hot, so I stick some bottles in the cellar and let them sit a while. A year or two generally suffices for me. This softens the hops heat that is so pronounced when new and makes the flavors meld more. The mouth feel is very good, just what one likes in a BBA stout.

The chocolate and vanilla are still present throughout the bourbon course. Then the bourbon fades into a milky, creamy, and malty finish with faint hints of chocolate and vanilla lingering for support. Like bread pudding on the finish.

The bourbon comes through like a tsunami, but again there are bubbling hints of chocolate that rise to the surface during this process. The two battle for control. The whole time I think the bourbon is winning, and then comes the vanilla and malty finish that cleans off both, but still leaves a lasting bourbon flavor lingering on the tongue that is sweet. (4.00)  Feel: Heavier-bodied. Heavy and thick. Not really syrupy, but approaches that level. Mostly thick and creamy which is nice. Relatively clean for the body. The bourbon and alcohol clean a lot off the palate, and what remains is definitely sweet, but at least relatively tamed. (3.75)  Overall: Still new at bourbon-barreled beer.

I'm having beer euphoria. 5.0 The mouth feel is thick, and silky. 4.5 Overall, the sweetness level is just right making it extra easy to drink and the high ABV makes it a real pounder. 4.75",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Cracked open a bottle to celebrate the Packers victory over the Seahawks. Poured out of a 12 oz bottle, very little head but got the coffee and chocolate on the nose, pours a midnight black.

Delicious; thick, frothy full of flavor, not to sweet so it is not gimmicky! Bursting with chocolate, coffee and hint of bourbon. Perfect fall and winter stout. Love it!

Nothing else, nothing at all objectionable to me to note. F- Deep, pungent, and rich (not 'sweet') feel. Intense, don't plan on reviewing anything lighter after this one! Amazingly for 12.2% there is no 'burn' as you swallow it and it goes down. O- My wife likes stong black beers but not coffee-tasting ones, or heavy whisky notes.

Taste similar but more of a candied chocolate (thinking M&Ms) along with the unmistakeable bite of strong alcohol, which makes it drink 'thinner' somehow. As it warms, the minor hint of coffee joins the candied chocolate, and we have ourselves a real treat of a dessert sipper.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Appearance: Pitch black with a dark tan head, with plenty of sheets and strands of persistent lacing.  Smell: Coffee, bourbon, bittersweet chocolate.  Taste: Lots of mixed flavors going on. Definite coffee and chocolate - like a bit of a chocolate covered coffee bean that you bite into and grind with your molars. Bourbon / vanilla notes, along with lots of roasted malt that brings some bitterness to complement everything. Despite being so thick, this is not a malt bomb, nor is this bourbon with some beer flavor. Instead, the stout, coffee, and chocolate come first, and the bourbon is there for a complementary flavor.  Mouthfeel: Very thick and smooth. Some prickly carbonation underneath it all. Warming at the finish along with a bit of spiciness.  Overall / Drinkability: A very well crafted stout. I can see why people rave about this beer so much. Definitely a beer to sip and savor, and dangerously drinkable. Went well with chocolate covered Lebkuchen.

Full of incredible chocolate and coffee flavours, hints of oak and bourbon that linger on the tongue. Licorice hints as well. I get a oaky finish that hangs around for a while on the palate. Overall an amazing BA stout. I would rank it just below the CBS. I loved the CBS maple flavours, but found KBS to be less sweet, which is expected.

I'm only 22 and after the first sip, I was almost in tears because of how impressed I was with this beverage. Nothing even compares with the quality of the Kentucky Breakfast Stout. Pours almost black, with a minimal brown head. Smells of coffee and dark chocolate liquor. Tastes of Coffee, bourbon, chocolate, molasses, vanilla, and black licorice. The taste and the feel was just unbelievably complex and heavy. Many can drink this, but can you just drink a 12 oz over the course of 3 hours and just only think about the tastes in this stout?

Being from Kentucky myself, I love the flavor of this beer.  It's dense, pours black with a tiny head of foam, a little lacing, and looks opaque in the glass. Smells richly of coffee, chocolate, molasses... alcohol content is pretty forward, but the ""burn"" is well-masked by the hit of flavor. The mouthfeel is divine. Silky smooth, rich, coats the mouth, and leaves a lingering roasty-toastiness that is gorgeous, especially in these colder months.  I love this beer.

This version weighs in at 12.2% ABV  Dark black glugger, not much foam, all motor oil with a mocha ring. Smell is whisky fumes mixing with a chocolate and coffee base. But some expensive-ass quality whisky, 'spensive chocolate and 'spensive coffee. The taste is a nice blend of stout, oak barrel whisky, chocolate nibs, and a dark roasted coffee, all enveloped in warm alcohol. It's way undercarbonated and syrupy - that's my only real complaint  Great beer for a cool night during the colder seasons.

1199,19960,Rug,4.22,"I should start this off by saying that stout are not one of my favorite styles, but holy hell is this good. Huge shoutout to CraftBeerKings.com for making it possible for me to try this, and it was on sale!  Bottled 2/11/19  From a 12 oz 2019 bottle into a snifter, it pours an opaque black with a brown tan head that holds up for quite a while  The aroma strongly coffee and dark malts, almost overly sweet at times. But the coffee here smells genuine with a smokiness to back it up  This brew comes alive in the taste as it warms while it sits in my mouth. Chocolate malts coat my tongue initially while a coffee and oak presence finish it out. There are very mild fruity esters I am picking up on, perhaps plums  The feel here is exceptionally smooth, and the alcohol is extremely well hidden. After the swallow, notes of oak and coffee remain for a long while  Overall, this brew is incredible and lives up to the hype, especially for someone such as myself who wold much prefer an ipa or a sour over a stout any day. It is not overly complex, but it flows well because of this. The flavors, aroma, and mouthfeel all interact nicely to create a very cohesive stout. I paired this with a wedge of gouda cheese that helped bring out more of the coffee notes than it had initially, and I strongly recommend that pairing. If this is still available on CBK for $4.99 a bottle, do yourself a favor and pick a few up if you've never tried it. I'll set my other aside for a special occasion, maybe my college graduation, and compare it to a brand new bottle  Cheers!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Two finger foamy bubbly taupe-brown head slides down slowly leaving soapy lace on the glass.  Scent is bourbon (and how!) and bitter chocolate. Cold brew coffee. Vanilla. Raisins.  Taste is chocolate, both bitter dark and sweet milk. Chocolate cherries. Ooohh there's the bourbon - in a long dramatic lingering finish. There's a notable alcohol warming in the throat. Espresso. Raisins and figs. Mocha. Capuccino. Marzipan. Toffee. This is a boozy dessert in a glass. There are also subtle notes of char and hop bitterness in the background which only become apparent after the initial chocolate/coffee and bourbon flavors have said their peace. Chocolate is the dominant flavor here and though there is certainly some sweetness it is in no way cloying and is balanced nicely by the bitter notes.  Mouth is voluptuous and creamy. Silky. Full bodied. Very satisfying.  For the warming and the high abv this is still eminently quaffable. Drinkability does not suffer.

There is espresso coffee grounds, black licorice, dark chocolate and a little basil in the taste profile. It's not your average breakfast stout and that unique basil/licorice flavor really sets it aside as a beer flavor I haven't tried before.  One of these at 11-something ABV will leave you a bit tipsy.

Also other dark sugar notes, get a nice rich syrupy aroma, maybe toffee or hot caramel, honestly just super pleasant smell. No detectable alcohol T: rich dark chocolate character. Almost a little bit more on the savory side of cocoa than overly sweet. Toasted notes, like crisp almost-burnt bread, toasted walnuts. A bit of tannins on the finish, slightly dry. Not necessarily bitter just astringent. Could be from the coffee. Also a slight creamy lactose-like sweetness. Bourbon/oak is really only present on the back end of the palate for me, after I’ve waited a while between sips. F: really smooth and easy drinking. Silky, but absolutely coats the mouth. Big body, definitely heavy, but it’s not a chore to drink. It goes back really easy for a 12% beer (dangerous!). Carbonation is apparent but it’s on the lower side. O: really quite a treat to drink this. I can’t really come up with anything wrong with this beer, and can rattle off a list of reasons why it’s amazing.

1199,19960,Calarice,4.18,2019 Aroma is overwhelming with mocha and a slight hint of Bourbon. I can't pick up much else. Not complaining either. Smells very nice.  Looks jet black. I couldn't get even a slight glimpse of light through this one. About a pinky finger of light brown frothy head.  Taste is an improvement on last year in my opinion. The bourbon is a bit more subtle than 2018. Leans more towards coffee and hints of chocolate. Pleasant alcohol warmth for a beer this heavy.  Heavy body. Creamy not chewy feel.  Overall a very delicious beer. I like it a lot. However my wife doesn't like the style and thought it was discussing. If you don't like Bourbon you may want to skip this one. None the less a great beer.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,mogulskier,4.66,"This is about as good as your gonna get for a barrel-aged coffee-chocolate beer. Do not age this beer though. After a year, the coffee really fades and it doesn't taste as good or as balanced. Even the barrel character begins to be a negative.  4-6 months is the sweet spot, but fresh is also really very good.  The only complaint I might have is mouthfeel, it could be better.  Other than that, taste is a perfect blend of coffee, chocolate, and barrel. An absolute perfect blend of the three. Take your time and enjoy it, but it can be hard because it is highly drinkable despite the high ABV (~12%).  Zero alcohol burn with an almost cacao powder on the finish. Taste follows the nose. Your palate is hit with coffee, chocolate, and then barrel. A really nice combo. The best thing about KBS is the consistency. Year after year, it delivers! A true tried and true classic.  Lastly, what I really appreciate is that it is not sweet or cloying. One of the best BA beers out there for fans of coffee. The chocolate is also of high quality.

More bourbon to taste thsn anything else on the palate, but nicely tempered by chocoladepand given a little more depth by the coffee made part of the mix. Again, sweet but not syrupy. Drinks like a liquer. Tasty and delicate on the palate. Would make an excellent after dinner brew for sipping at.  Interesting across the board.

1199,19960,jrc1093,4.19,"First sampled in 2018, but this 2019 version will be my first to be (officially) reviewed.  Bottled on 3/5/19  Pours a gorgeous, thick jet black body topped with a creamy light brown head; decent retention yields a heavy collar of bubbly froth and some light but persistent lacing coating the walls of the glass.  Aromas of huge mocha, baker’s chocolate, and some general brownie batter tones upfront; oaky, ashy char, tobacco, brown sugar, coffee candy, and molasses all ease their way forward as the beer warms; seems almost overwhelmingly chocolatey at times, but the building bourbon and barrel hint at a further depth.  Taste brings more dark chocolate, oak, and a deeper hint of smoke malt to start; bourbon depth begins to reveal itself as it warms, with light vanilla and wisps of espresso playing for attention, but the depth of chocolate here is intense and indomitable; in spite of this, it’s a perfect kind of sweetness executed against relatively quiet barrel tones.  Mouthfeel verges on heavy, but shows a tamed body eased by the lightest kind of carbonation; bits of malty grit along the mid-palate build steadily, eventually resulting in an amazingly dry finish that subdues the weight of the profile nicely.  This 2019 iteration is very oak-forward with an intense chocolate profile that threatens to overwhelm the beer entirely, although the depth coming through the borderline one-dimensionality is impressive, all things considered, and there’s an overall refinement that makes this consistently easy to enjoy; a BA stout done at a high level, simply put.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S: Wood, boozy/whiskey, vanilla, tobacco, leather, molasses, brown sugar, roasted malt. Crazy complex aroma here.  T: Roasted malt, maple syrup, vanilla, bourbon, and wood. A little bit of chocolate throughout, surprisingly not a stronger note. More coffee evident but more like mocha. Some smoke.

But while the alcohol is over the top, the chocolate, coffee and whiskey are not. This absolutely black beer has a big continuing aroma of rich malts, chocolate and bourbon, and is even more complex on the palate, with sweet bourbon, smooth coffee, malts, and chocolate, before a heated alcohol finish. The overall effect is rather like drinking a fine liqueur (after the half-finger dark tan head drops out).",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Mindcrime1000,4.38,"Poured from a single-serve bottle into a tulip.  I am glad we finally have this brew available on the barren prairie. I can't believe I've not tasted this one before.  Pours a thick, viscous, absolutely opaque black/brown with dark mottled tan two-fingered head, which lingers well for the ABV and good lacing. A very fine looking imperial stout.  A very strong, complex and pleasing aroma is delivered here. Chocolate, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, dark fruit, anise/herb notes, along with caramel, roasted grain, nutty background aromas (hazelnuts and walnuts). Graham cracker, molasses and hints of booze, rather well-hidden for the ABV.  The flavors of this brew are varied, complex, and tasty. The bourbon/vanilla notes are, obviously, pretty strong and solid, but they are part of a collection of flavors, not the only show. Coffee, chocolate cake batter, semi-sweet chocolate nibs, char, fig, date, hazelnut, anise, molasses, oak, tobacco, leather, and broader non-bourbon booziness join the party.  Barrel-aged offerings of anything are often skewed ""thin"" for the style that was aged--not so this offering. The mouthfeel is medium full, with solid carbonation for the style and ABV. The finish is just so--no stickiness or sweetness.  Barrel-aging has always been a hit or miss for me. This is one of the best barrel-aged brews I've had.

Lingering espresso finish.  2017: light coffee aroma intermingled with significant chocolate. Flavor is espresso and chocolate, booziness is significantly mellowed.

1199,19960,woodychandler,4.59,"I am rather incredulous that I have not reviewed this beer until now! I have had multiple vintages, but the one currently in my possession is absolutely fresh as a 2019 release.  From the Bottle: ""The Amazing Kosmicki's KBS""; ""A flavored Stout is good for everything a flavored Stout ought to be good for""; ""Ale brewed with Chocolate and Coffee [and] aged in Oak Bourbon Barrels""; ""Barrel Aged Series""; ""What we’ve got here is an imperial stout brewed with a massive amount of coffee and chocolates, then cave-aged in oak bourbon barrels for an entire year to make sure wonderful bourbon undertones come through in the finish. Makes your taste buds squeal with delight.""  I wouldn't mind squealing with delight so I Pop!ped the cap & began a slow, gentle pour into the awaiting glass. The beauty of a Stout, in any form, even if it is CO2-driven, is that they tend to perform a pseudo-cascade, leading to the formation of loads of head. In this case, I wound up with over two fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-tan/light-brown head with very good retention that left loads of lacing in its wake. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose smelled prevalently of baker's chocolate & bourbon with an undertone of dark-roasted black coffee. Mmm. The taste, while delicious, lacked the subtleties that I have noticed in aged vintages. For example, the bourbon brought an unsubtle heat to the equation and thereby masked especially the coffee while it muted the chocolate. That is not to say that I did not enjoy its taste - simply that I feel that it improves with age. The heat brought a dryness to the finish that aging seems to buff off. I am glad that I finally reviewed it, but I still recommend aging before drinking. YMMV.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Nose of deep coffee, subtle boozy bourbon, and heavy char with touches of vanilla and bakers chocolate.

1199,19960,Wolvmar,4.41,"2019 vintage drunk 3/16/19. Poured into a tulip glass. Numerical rating is updated for 2019 vintage.  Pour: Black as night. 2-3 finger tan head. Thick ring, clouds, lots of lacing. Still one of the best pours out there.  Nose: lots of coffee, dark chocolate, very, very slight bourbon. Maybe a little dark roast malt sweetness or vanilla. Better balance than 2018, maybe a touch sweeter and slightly less coffee. So far, after one, I prefer 2019 to 2018.  Taste: plenty of coffee, a little booze, dark chocolate, some caramel and toffee notes. Burnt toast, dark roasted malt, hint of vanilla sweetness, slight hops bitterness on the backend. More balanced than 2018. Really enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: maybe a touch less creamy but still thick and satisfying.  Overall: this is really good, better than 2018 and more comparable to prior vintages. Slightly more bourbon flavor is a positive for me while the other characteristics are well balanced.  =============  2018 vintage drunk 3/10/18. Picked up at taproom today; this is fresh! Poured into same tulip glass as 2017 vintage.  Pour: same as 2017. Awesome!  Nose: lots of coffee, some more coffee, some dark chocolate, very, very slight bourbon. Maybe a little dark roast malt sweetness. Doesn’t seem as complex as in the past with bourbon and sweetness reduced from what I recall and my notes.  Taste: again, coffee and some more coffee. Very little booze, some caramel and toffee notes. Burnt toast, slight bitterness. Relatively clean. Surprisingly little bourbon compared to previous fresh vintages.  Mouthfeel: similar but maybe even creamier with less alcohol burn. Really thick and satisfying.  Overall: this is really good but maybe not as good as in the past. The lack of bourbon flavor is a negative for me while the other characteristics are solid. I love coffee so that is good. Would like more of the chocolate as in the past. Will try another bottle in a few weeks.  Numerical rating reflects the 2018 vintage. Prior vintages were higher.  ==========  2017 vintage poured into a tulip glass.  Pour: deep, dark, brown/black with a solid two finger tan head that only slowly dissipates leaving lots of lacing. The lacing lasts, and lasts. One of the most beautiful pours I’ve seen.  Nose: heavy malts, caramel, bourbon. The sweetness dominates with the bourbon well balanced. Not over powering; maybe more subtle than expected. Very pleasant.  Taste: creamy malts and bourbon hit first with hop bitterness right behind. Lots of coffee and dark chocolate. Some caramel and molasses provide a subtle sweetness, a hint of vanilla and dark fruits. Really well balanced with only the hop bitterness being a little more than I would want. Compared to fresh, the bitterness has mellowed and the bourbon is a little more subtle. Improves as it warms. I started at low 40s warming to low 50s. A really tasty treat.  Mouthfeel: creamy with bourbon coating the mouth. Mild carbonation, which makes the beautiful head even more impressive. The hops and alcohol linger a bit and, as with the flavor, maybe linger a bit to much and long. But that’s splitting hairs.  Overall: one of the best. This is a great sipper that improves as it ages. Keep a supply in the cellar. This was a year old and fabulous. I’ve had two year old and it is even better.

1199,19960,etaggie09,3.28,"Bottled in feb of 2019. Poured into my treehouse teku glass a stodgy black color with a finger and a half mocha head that’s already leaving a huge amount of lacing on the glass. This is completely opaque. I can see a decent amount of carbonation but this is black as the devils soul. Head has settled to a half a finger cap and there is just a ton of lacing on the glass.  Bourbon is much more reserved in the nose than I would have expected. Smells very similar to the regular breakfast stout but more well rounded. Chocolate, coffee, and oats are all there, but so are oak and vanilla. That boozy malty caramel of the bourbon can be detected but it doesn’t overwhelm, which I am so incredibly happy to find. Very pleasant smell. Dessert like but not assaulting with sweetness. Very, very enticing.  There’s a definite booziness in the delivery here that is more predominantly charred oak barrel than bourbon. The bourbon is there, but I’m getting a lot more of the oak in this. The taste doesn’t seem to be quite as balanced as the nose. Yeah the chocolate and coffee just aren’t really coming through all that much. They are getting bullied by the oak bitterness. It’s quite a dry finish actually, which I am more a fan of, but the finish is very short and I like stouts that try to behave like scotch and leave you with a memory of the taste that has you keep coming back. Even as the beer warms, there’s just not a lot of complexity in the flavor to be found here. Very one dimensional and flat.  The mouthfeel is pretty appropriate if just the tiniest bit thin. Carbonation is where I want it to be and it most definitely is not cloying.  Overall, I was a little disappointed with this one given its reputation and my love for the original breakfast stout.

The taste is a little overwhelmed with the coffee, but behind that you can definitely taste the bourbon barrel & the chocolate.  From what I’ve heard, the coffee gets more mellow as this one ages, and perhaps that’s what this needs is some aging in a cellar for some time before enjoying it.  Even if you don’t age it, it’s very likely not to disappoint anyone who loves this style.

Immediate hit of whiskey which quickly dissolves into rich milk chocolate, coffee and caffeine. Heavy body; dense and luscious sense of velvet and residual sugars; warm with lots of boozy heat; semi-sweet.  At long last I get to try some of this beer. I am not disappointed.

Sure, last year's iteration still sits on shelves, but why is that *bad,* really? Because Founders produces world-class beer for the masses?  Drinking the newest batch in 2019.  Pours a deep dark brown with a thick brown-sugary head that leaves good retention and amazing lacing. The smell is rich dark cocoa, fudge, toffee, a hint of espresso, just the slightest hint of burnt marshmallow. Taste of baker's chocolate, anise, tree-bark. The bourbon just rounds it all together, turning the whole into something better than its parts. Full-bodied, medium carbonation, goes down thick and smooth.  I get that craft beer is well into its post-hipster epoch but this beer has NEVER STOPPED BEING GREAT. I've had it a hundred times but I am never short of stunned drinking it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The taste is an explosion of coffee, chocolate, bourbon, toasted oak and some maple again along with this dry/slate like presence. The finish is dry don't feel like you get much sweetness which is god. Mouthfeel is medium carbonation, medium mouth coating and again a dry feel. For such a large alcohol bomb it is hidden very well. A great beer for sure.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,ArthurFrayn,4.76,"Reviewing the recently released 19 batch.  Look- Exactly what I expected, black as midnight and poured a lovely 2 finger head of light brown/tan foam. Nice lacing on the glass  Smell- Not getting a ton of things here, maybe just a little bit of roasted malt, but not really strong bourbon or coffee coming forward.  Taste- At first im getting a very nice black coffee with the perfect amount of sweetness added from what i'm thinking is the bourbon barrel. The true joy of this beer is how each drink develops the taste a bit more and you are able to discern individual notes. I get a quite lovely caramel note slowly start to creep in secondly, with chocolate coming right after. As the beer dries on my palette I get some of the oak I believe from the barrel and dark chocolate.  Feel- Not to heavy actually. I would describe this as around medium for a stout, but the real thing to mention here is the way it dries down. The very small carbonation bubbles present in the head give this beer a pillow like feeling as it dries out on the palette. I would describe the feeling as semi-dry as the taste is almost completely gone, and this provokes you to take another drink to get some of the sweetness from the first part of tasting. Nothing sickly-sweet here, very well balanced.  Overall- This beer was hyped to no end for years, and I finally owed it to myself to try it this go round and was fortunate enough to grab some the day it was released, usually it goes pretty quick where i'm from! This is up there with the best that I have tried. Worth trying once if you are a fan of the style.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A whole tray of brownies, fresh coffee, chocolate cake, chocolate pudding, singed caramel squares, straight bourbon whiskey, barrel wood, vanilla pods, wood smoke, stewed dark orchard fruit and ethereal leafy hops.  Tastes like I've been transported to the land of coffee, chocolate and bourbon. Tastes of one-cream coffee, melted dark chocolate, lightly watered bourbon, wet ash, soft black licorice, more barrel staves, and more faint green hop bitterness.  Feels soft and silky. Full bodied with smooth carbonation. Finishes dry.  Verdict: Vigourously recommended. A masterpiece.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

One finger of dark tan head, which shimmers from the rising bubbles. Leaves behind a spotty pattern of lacing. Aroma right away expresses the aromatic nature of the bourbon barrel, and beneath that are the smells of chocolate and coffee. Also caramel and some vanilla are present. Taste is first the more bitter coffee, and then the rich chocolate flavor arrives, along with the roasty base, some caramel and vanilla. The bourbon barrel encompasses it all but never overwhelms. Toward the end are the more boozy notes. The end trails off with bourbon tinged chocolate and slight coffee. Some light char and smoke in the aftertaste. Ends up with a dry note. Full and creamy mouth feel. Supportive carbonation. Fully deserving of its accolades, this beer delivers with both a pleasant and a powerful drinking experience. Lots of big time flavors but quite easy to drink. The bourbon barrel is so well incorporated.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Definitely one of the best stouts I've ever had. A wonderful combination of flavors with a background of bourbon to round out the taste. Slightly boozy.  A beer I've always wanted to try and it lives up to the hype. Expensive but a definite must try. Highly recommended.  Edit: I've since picked up two four packs of KBS (2019). All I can say it is one the THE best beers I've ever had.

Appearance: Dark brown to black in colour with a half finger mocha brown head that dissipated fairly quickly, but left some nice lacing.  Aroma: Roasty, coffee, chocolate, bourbon, oak and a light caramel.  Taste: Roasted malts, lots of rich dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon, oak, vanilla, light bitter finish.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, smooth, full bodied with soft carbonation.  Overall: Aroma wasn’t as rich as the taste, but the taste was outstanding with the strong rich and smooth chocolate flavours.

Taste - coffee flavor dominates, followed by hints of chocolate and vanilla. A fair bit of carbonation, and smokiness is definitely present. Kind of like actually drinking an iced coffee. Finish is long and smooth. Really delicious. Feel - full bodied, higher on carbonation than I would expect out of the style. A strong brew at 12.3%, but if you didn't check, you wouldn't even know because the alcohol is so well masked. Overall - a phenomenal barrel aged stout that is really done right.

About 1.5 cm of coffee coloured head with tight bubbles. Head slowly fades to a film that stays around for the duration of the beer. Smell: Chocolate and vanilla straight up. Soon the coffee starts to come through, like espresso. A touch of raisin/dark dried fruit towards the end as the alcohol makes itself known. Taste: Straight up, coffee. Like drinking a strong short black. The chocolate a vanilla comes through when you are a little more used to the coffee, but its a lot more restrained than it was on the nose. Roasty bitterness at the mid to front palate. A touch of bourbon. Definitely a bit of heat throughout, hiding behind the other flavours. Not much fruit, unlike the smell. Feel: Full bodied, but with some prickly carbonation. The bitterness hits the front of the tongue and works its way back over the course of the beer. Good length and a little dry on the finish. Overall: Its a fantastic beer, strong flavours, touch of heat but well masked and adds to the experience.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,SierraNevallagash,4.33,"12oz bottle - 2018 vintage - 12.3% ABV - poured into a chianti glass at abiit 65F  Pours a glugging stream of motor oil brown, and sits in the glass obsidian black. Onyx. A plume of dark mocha head rises to the top, and proceeds to stand it's ground with a sizzle and hiss - holding two fingers of height for an impressive length of time. Eventualy, the head settles to a mocha film, and thick, sticky brown collar with tenacious lacing.  Nose is brightly roasted coffee out of the gate, carrying along a good smack of acidity, but without the green chili note I often get from coffee beer. Alongside the coffee, and boldly kilned malt, there is a strong presence of bourbon, barrel, and char. An oaky vanillin note presents itself. Molasses, brown sugar, a hint of maple, and oh so much coffee. No real dark fruit notes like the ones found in BCBS. Coffee is the dominant aroma.  On the palate, the coffee is thankfully more subdued than on the nose. It is very evident that this beer has spent a nice lengthy time inside a bourbon barrel. The opening note is semi-sweet chocolate, but then those familiar and beloved barrel notes slide right in. Vanilla, oak, char, bourbon fumes, very subtle licorice, very subtle cinnamon, more char, and then the chocolate turns dark, with tannic/charry/bitter/roasty/coffee notes unfolding late in the palate, and into the finish. There is a sweetness to it, but don't be fooled, this is not a dessert-sweet beer. Lots of dry, tannic, bitter notes to be found. Once the finish is in full swing, the roasted coffee once again presents itself as the dominant characteristic.  Mouthfeel on this one is slick, full bodied, smooth, slightly viscous, and essentially flat. The lazy carbonation can barely fight through the body of the beer - keep in mind, I do believe this was laid to rest in a barrel for an entire year? If so, very few bubbles are to be expected. There's the slightest bi of effervescence to provide some airy texture amidst the thick elixir, but I would hardly use the word ""carbonated"". More like, ""almost sparkling""  Overall, this is a fantastic BBA stout, do not be fooled. I completely understand the prestigious repertoire this has. It's fantastic. I have trouble giving it stellar, world-class ratings, simply because there are some.insanely good BBA stouts out there. I think it's almost impossible to beat BCBS, and Bell's BA Expedition is a damn close second. HOWEVER....I find this offering from Founders to be more drinkable than the two of those. This lacks the syrupy sweetness and insane viscosity that those two beers possess. While I found those attributes to be part of what makes them so special, this dryer, less sweet and syrupy, slightly thinner beer that is KBS is definitely a beer all its own, and I must admit, is a little easier to drink in a sitting. Certainly not a fast gulper, but also not one that will take up to a day to finish. An outstanding barrel-aged stout from Founders that I will certainly spend money on in the future.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Aroma: Big espresso, loads of semi sweet dark chocolate, bourbon, oak, green coffee bean, dates, raisin, roasted malts, and some slight vanilla. It smells very nice and the adjuncts still pop much more than I had anticipated at almost ten months old.  Taste: Tons of sweet bourbon wrapped around a well roasted malt backbone. The chocolate is rich and decadent, but not overly sweet. KBS has sweetness up front aided by the dark fruits, bourbon, and vanilla but it dries out some and gets a touch bitter thanks to the oak barrel and the coffee. KBS is still a nice departure from onslaught on pastry stouts that have become so popular over the last few years and it has a flavor profile that is reasonably close to a personal favorite, The Abyss, less the time spent in wine barrels.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

It has a good three layered body, decent lacing, and rich flavor accompanied with a good coffee smell. Since the aging process is quite significant with this beer, i feel the vanilla compliments the bourbon flavor, and makes the overall feel a little bit subtle and pleasant. I would compare this with a fine Malbec or a $70 wine bottle. I feel that this should be enjoyed a little bit on a cooler side, and then let your hands warm the beer to a comfortable temperature on your last sip.  Look: 4.5/5. Good three layers with a quarter to half inch head. This causes a decent lacing on the lower side, and not too much Smell: 4.75/5. Perfect blend of ingredients, coffee and vanilla with a bourbon hint. The coffee has a toasted smell because of the age Taste: 4.75/5. Good rich taste. It has got a refined taste that will make you smile, but does not leave an after taste. Perfect beer for stout lovers. Feel: 4.5/5. It is a beer that i would recommend on a cooler night. Having this during spring time, on tap is perfect. You can feel three stages with this. First one where you take in the cold sip, the second one is where the flavor settles on your pallet and you get the stout flavor and the third one is where it soothes you as you swallow it.

The nose is a treat - rich dark chocolate and aged rum, complimented by lighter notes of medium roast coffee and vanilla. My mind keeps going to rum cake, or a true, aged fruit cake. A velvety smooth feel and luscious chocolate flavour are the first things to stand out, like an authentic hot chocolate. Once again that fruity, sweet, rum flavour kicks in, right after the chocolate and lingering through the finish. I wish this came in cake form. Light burn of alcohol provides balance to the sweetness, which thankfully isn't cloying or heavy-handed. Dried fruit (dates, figs, raisins) flavours come to mind, and vanilla. A touch of coffee. Easy-drinking despite the intense flavours, with a medium body and medium-light, very fine carbonation.  Get your hands on this come Fall!

A: Pours a very, very dark brown color (but not quite black) with excellent formation of a one inch plus, light brown head, moderate retention, but rings and rings of serious lacing. S: Gorgeous nose with aromas of chocolate > coffee (but definitely both), vanilla, frankly very reminiscent of a chocolate ice cream malted. As warms, more of a bourbon note. T: Chocolate and coffee are very evident, with vanilla and bourbon flavors much more evident. Thought I detected orange peel and spicy notes. Aging from oak and higher order alcohols both seem to be present. Bitterness imparts almost a birch or sarsaparilla note. M: Full bodied with solid, very persistent carbonation. Creamy and smooth.

There's been other brews I have had that have not, but this one certainly does. From the time I poured it out of the bottle from the time I downed it, it was dark, laced on the pint glass, and did I mention dark...The smell was everything you would expect - boozy, chocolaty, full of the scent of coffee - and that goes for the taste as well. Mouthfeel is something I am rarely impressed with when it comes to beers - but this one was creamy, light on the carbonation (like I like it) and for all the bourbon - smooth.

Malts take a back seat as it ages. Surprisingly it still has a nip of alcohol and it has kept a good amount of carbonation. 8 months to a year is still the sweet spot for me with this beer.  2019.

The foam fades to a sturdy surface layer slowly after the pour. The aroma is deep rich and malty with dark chocolate and some bourbon notes, also a bit of boozy warmth even on the nose here. A little molasses and some anice with hints of coffee grounds. No hops showing up here that I can really pick out. The texture is very smooth and carbonation is mild and gently rolls across my palate. The body is pretty thick as anticipated for this large imperial stout. Flavor is a dose of sweet and also dark chocolate, some molasses and roasted coffee. Some rich bourbon also comes through and the booze is very well hidden for this high ABV. Again the hops are buried and make no appearance. This is a super drinkable and smooth imperial stout for how large of a beer it is.

Dry and bitter aftertaste; clean without extending too much on roasted notes. Bordering full body with perfect carbonation. it feels lighter. Alcohol of 11.9% is deceptive. Superbly balanced RIS with great complexity without being confusing or having single flavors predominating over others. It does have an original flavor although many have followed it.

1199,19960,Hoppsbabo,3,"Initially a great head which dies down quickly, but I'm guessing because it's barrel aged. Oh man, a flavoured stout that actually tastes of the stuff it's flavoured with. The bourbon in the aftertaste is very aggressive after not long. Very much reminds me of a stout with chilli pepper. Otherwise quite sweet but the bitter whisky aftertaste turns my stomach a little.  Started well but after a few minutes, oh boy is it aggressive. Give me a Good King Henry any day.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,thehyperduck,4.59,"355 mL bottle from the LCBO; best before Feb 13 2019 and served barely chilled. Not the first time I've tried this - I enjoyed the '17 batch, but never got around to reviewing it.  Pours ebony jet-black, topped with a half-finger of frothy, dark tan-coloured head that wilts within 90 seconds; a bubbly cap and wide, creamy collar remain, along with a liberally-applied coat of lovely lace. On the nose, coffee grounds virtually leap out of the glass and tantalize the nostrils; they're accompanied by robust notes of molasses, bourbon, oak and baker's chocolate. Minor hints of vanilla, smoky ash, herbal licorice and ethanol also come through as it warms.  If you're trying your first KBS, ensure that you're seated before you take a sip - it's so tasty that your knees might start to wobble and give way. OK, maybe I'm exaggerating, but rich, decadent and intense are still the adjectives that immediately come to mind - roasted malts and coffee beans, dark chocolate and vanilla, as well as bourbon whiskey, molasses and oak wood combine together into an absurdly yummy conflagration of flavour. Towards the finish, hints of herbal licorice, burnt wood and bourbon provide an added kick, with the latter element lasting on, well into a boozy-sweet aftertaste that lingers. The ethanol is well-integrated with the flavour profile, but still very potent and impossible to dismiss; it's actually concentrated enough to numb the palate somewhat after a couple of sips. Full-bodied, with very low carbonation levels that barely even register; it has a silky-smooth, satisfying texture on the palate.  Final Grade: 4.59, an A+. Founders KBS is one of the best stouts I've ever tried, and an undoubtedly excellent, world-class beer that I'd be thrilled to drink again. There's no subtlety to be found here - this one wallops you in the face, over and over again, with more coffee, chocolate and bourbon/oak than your taste buds will know what to do with. I don't know if it's one of the 50 best beers on the planet, but it's a damn good one either way: I'll be picking up a few more bottles before the stock runs dry, because it's not as if beers this amazing show up in Ontario every month.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Ice_Cream_And_IPAs,4.36,"Look The beer pours deep brown, though it’s pitch black in this glass. There is a thin light brown head that dissipates quickly; the bubbles are fairly uniform. There is no lacing left on the glass.  Smell: Lots of molasses and chocolate. No coffee or oak on the nose, which is surprising considering all my beer friends in California have assured me that 2018 is nothing but barrel.  Taste: The taste follows the nose. There is lots and lots of dark chocolate, which these dominates all the way through. Not much molasses in the taste. Coffee is again not apparent. Very slight barrel warming in the very end, with just a tiny hint of oak. I’ve had the 2017 CBS and the taste is definitely reminiscent of that in some sense. Alcohol is very well hidden for it being a 12% beer.  Feel: Medium body, medium carbonation. Don’t know what else to say.  Overall: Considering the California prices, I got this 2018 bottle for pretty cheap. All my beer friends have described this beer as an underperformer due to too much barrel on both the nose and the smell. Honestly I’m not getting much of that. Chocolate is definitely the dominant flavor overall. This stout is very well made and is great overall, but it’s definitely not a standout among its class in 2018. Would I buy more bottles at $2.50 a pop again, absolutely. Is it worth to seek out or spend more for than its real market value currently — definitely not in 2018 NorCal.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ChrisCage,4.23,"A- Pours a very opaque, and very dark brown color....near impossible to see through. The head starts out about one finger thick and looks super frothy!.....it is toffee colored and retains rather well into a half finger thick layer over the brew. The lacing, while thick, doesn't really do any sort of clinging around the inside of my glass, leaving only behind a couple of small scattered blobs. Decent looking overall!  S- Huge amounts of dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, black coffee, some vanilla molasses sweetness, bourbon barrel woodiness. The overall aroma is rich, delicate and smooth. Hints of black and dark chocolate barley malt make their presence known too, and the finish is of a dry Earthy sweetness, with perhaps some fresh coffee bean grinds and subtle hop bitterness.  T- Wow, this is a nice tasting Stout! Huge deep dark chocolate right up front, with background notes of licorice, oak aged bourbon, tender vanilla bean pods, dark fruit pits.....kind of a rummy booziness, and lots of dark/toasty malts that provide a dry astringency throughout the finish! There is an alcohol burn that runs from the back of the throat straight down into the gut and the dryness/booze lingers a little bit on the palate.  M/O- I was very surprised with how bubbly this is!......plenty of effervescence to this medium-full bodied brew! The drinkability is kind of low in my opinion, as it is much too rich to have more than a half bottle of at any one time.....definitely a sipping beer and it needs something sweet (or a nutty chocolate) to pair up with this. This is a good beer, if not a little overrated.....it could be a little more sociable and a little high in alcohol content.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,Squange,5,"Holy Moses! This beer is no joke. Rich, chocolatey, and delicious with a kick like a Southern mule. I thought I knew what I was getting into with this bad boy, but when push came to shove, I was woefully unprepared. I managed to score a 32oz growler of this nectar from a tap house today and was looking forward to settling into a good movie and a couple of imperial pints. It pours a bit like bottled Guinness, and not that fancy schmancy widget ""draft bottle"" stuff, but rather the old school, tan label, ""we scored a crate off a truck in Armagh"" Guinness bottles. Thin, but not watery. Black as coal, with almost zero carbonation. A tiny cocoa brown head forming at the top of the pint. I was instantly intrigued. As for bouquet, it is stouty and complex without being overly so. There are hints of dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, and (unsurprisingly) bourbon. I tipped the pint to my lips and BAM! The taste. Smooth, thick, coffee laced, with a delicious oatmealy richness, but what most surprised me is the dryness. The high ABV is reminiscent of Monster's Barleywine more than any stout I've ever had. At first, it almost put me off. But the more I had, the more I realized how delicious and balanced it is, even with its extraordinarily high alcohol content. The mouth on this beer is slightly syrupy and thick, as it coats the tongue, but it maintains its traditional stout drinkability. It's as if a standard, run of the mill, draft Guinness had a love child with Sam Adams notorious triple bock. Potent, yet incredibly drinkable.  This is not a beer for beginners, or for tossing back. Its high ABV and complex profile will knock you down the stairs if you aren't careful, but It is rapidly becoming a new favorite and may just have become my new signature beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,doktorhops,4.78,"I’ve been waiting a long, long time for this one: Founders KBS. I’m a touch apprehensive reviewing KBS, what with my FBS review still the most liked on BeerAdvocate, it’s like a beer reviewers version of a sophomore album, how do you follow that? By doing the best damn review ever! [no pressure] So here we have it, Founders mightiest of whales (only CBS comes close to the legend status of this brew). Must be reasonably fresh as well – it’s got a BB of 13.02.19 (I’m guessing Founders have a 2 year BB, so that would make the bottling date: 13 Feb 17). That been said age isn’t too much of a concern, apart from reports of coffee-flavour dropping off, this should be really tasty firecracker of a Stout.  Poured from a 355ml bottle into a Duvel tulip.  A: Blacker than Darth Vader’s knickers, which are a combination of obsidian and jet black, with a thin tan lace ring and minor head retention – it looks exactly like FBS, so formidable that it warrants a 10/10 too.  S: Unlike FBS this has quite the complex aroma: bourbon sweetness, of course, oak/woody/vanilla tones, dark chocolate, roasted coffee, (no doubt) unwarranted hints of spirit giving off an almost Japanese sweet potato shochu character (yeah, I thought that was weird too). Unsurprisingly KBS is making my olfactory senses it’s bitch, thanks KBS, yes I will do anything you tell me to do. 9/10.  T: “POW! Right in the kisser!” says KBS. This is a mighty, yet smooth as an R&B singer, American Imperial Stout, right up there with the best of the best, all hail KBS! [we’re not worthy, we’re not worthy!] Flavour profile is: roasted coffee, dark chocolate, bourbon, oak/woody/vanilla, molasses, with a light coffee bitterness in the finish, and a kiss of bourbon burn at the back of the throat. This is simply awesome. Balance is sublime, even though the aroma hinted at ethanol, the flavour profile hides the 12.3% ABV exceedingly well. A real sipper of a brew here. 10/10.  M: Heavy-bodied, viscous to the max, as is the Founders way, with a smooth/creamy/luscious mouth-feel. “Oooo this beer is sexy!” [said in a James Brown voice]. Can’t beat Founders body. 10/10.  D: Near perfect Imperial Stout this is. One thing to be noticed though towards the end of the glass – my tongue actually went numb, which could have been a combination of the heavy ABV and it just plain shutting down due to flavour overload. Founders delivers gold with my new favourite Stout. 9/10.

S: Smell of malty, creamy, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and roasted nuts right off the bat. Smell drifts and changes, almost a dance with each move hitting the spot. This smell is happiness on a cold day and warms your heart. Exquisite.  T: Wow. So complex, so dark and rich. Tastes of coffee, vanilla, chocolate, and a nice roasted malt. I can't quite pin down how they all play into each other, but it works and I'm amazed at how each sip seems so different than the last. Hides the alcohol well.  O: World class.

The smell is good but it's not strong at all. 1 year notes: smell is much stronger with rich chocolate and roasted malt notes. T - Tons of bittersweet chocolate and bitter coffee throughout followed quickly behind with bourbon and oak. The bourbon leaves slight warming alcohol notes on the back end. Vanilla and nuttiness are intermixed throughout as well along with a roasted, malt backbone to tie it all together. F - Medium to full bodied but leaning more toward the fuller side of things with a light amount of carbonation. Silky smooth, but syrupy at the same time. Personally, for such robust flavors, I think the feel could be much fuller. 1 year notes: feel is much fuller. O - This is a hell of a bourbon stout with rich complexity that definitely lives up to the hype, but that said I do think there might be better or at the very least equal bourbon imperial stouts out there.

1199,19960,djames,4.01,"This is a review of the 2018 offering: A lot more bite and chocolate/coffee bitterness than what I remember. The hallmark of this beer has been the velvety smoothness and aged depth. That’s missing a bit to me. Still a great stout, but not the undisputed king status it once held. If I get me hands on another one, I will let it age for a while.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,jpkand,4.71,"A: a nice oil black with a light brown head S: it's not overwhelming, and I mean that in a good way. No overpowering alcohol despite the content, but instead softer vanilla, coffee, and subtle roasted malts. T: this beer saves the best for the taste. So perfectly balanced for an imperial stout. It's easy to get coffee and chocolate, but the vanilla flavors from the oak help round it out nicely. Bourbon flavors permeate throughout but without overwhelming. M: heavy enough but if there is a weakpoint in this beer for me I think it's here. Just slightly too thin for me O: overall it's an outstanding beer. Probably my favorite imperial stout that I've tried yet. The flavors are just so perfectly balanced and it rounds out so nicely at the end it's just a pleasure to drink.

1199,19960,CEL,3.05,"In my opinion, this is another one of those hyped up beers. I'm not sure I agree with the description, ""subtle hints of chocolate and coffee."" The chocolate and coffee was so strong it completely overpowered any semblances of hops or malt. These flavors even overpowered the bourbon, which is a shame, especially since this is likely the most expensive and time consuming process of production. I was tempted to put a scoop of vanilla ice cream in there just to embrace it. I've got a few more left, I'll give it a try.

It starts crisp, chocolaty, and acidic and then comes the bourbon notes followed by a sweet, coffee aftertaste. The best tasting beer I've tried. F: Thick and slightly carbonated with a wet finish.

1199,19960,gr0g,4.5,"2.02.21 bottle enjoyed on 04/27/21. Aroma is the same -- like a mocha cake. Nice balance between sweetness and astringency. Booze is a bit too prominent in this admittedly quite fresh bottle. Taste and overall scores lowered from 5.0->4.5. This is a great barrel-aged stout but it's not on the same level as fellow stalwarts like BCBS or Parabola. --- Bottled on Feb. 9, 2018. Pitch black with a good amount of khaki foam for a big stout. The aroma really pops with rich, decadent notes of mocha/vanilla/bourbon that are nicely blended together. This is a pretty fresh bottle, so the booze notes are somewhat prominent, but they don't smother the aromas of the base beer. Coffee notes are quite a bit more subtle than in other Founders coffee beers like Breakfast Stout and Sumatra Mountain Brown.  Bittersweet dark chocolate and coffee hit the palate first. A brief wave of sweetness fades as the bourbon and wood flavors come into play. Booze only intrudes on the finish. Mouthfeel is very soft and smooth, and the only knock against it is that Founders couldn't match the richness/chewiness of their Imperial Stout. Having finally gotten my hands on one of the longest-tenured, most venerable Bourbon barrel stouts, it definitely lives up to the acclaim it has received over the years.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Dark brown, silky and luxurious when poured. Velvety. This beer does not resemble 10W30 when poured as so many other imperial stouts do (which is neither a positive or negative.)  Aroma: wonderful. Boozy. Chocolate, fudge and coconut. I wouldn’t have picked up the coffee if it weren’t referenced on the beer’s label.  Flavor: very boozy but not hot. Milk chocolate, coconut, bourbon and oak all in harmony.  Mouthfeel: thick and chewy; a meal by itself.  Overall: very, very good. I commend Founders for bottling this in 12oz bottles; a 750ml would be way too much. The 12oz format allows me not to have to share it. This BA imperial stout is near the top of a long list that I’ve tried. I’d put it alongside Bourbon County and Pirate Bomb as the best.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Ahypercube,4.96,"So excited to run into this. Finally appeared at my local Whole Foods (highest praise for their beer selection). Pouring one into a goblet on a late Friday morning. Happy 4/20!  L: Looks pretty typical of a BA Stout. Black as night, with a centimeter multicolored mocha/tan head. Hard to see how well-carbonated, as light cannot penetrate more than a centimeter, but from the persistence of the head, it can be assumed it is substantially so.  S: Very sweet. First I get maple and chocolate syrup, a splash of espresso, then toffee, vanilla, bourbon, fudge, molasses, coconut cream, then some subtle hop character of sage and lemon, salty soy sauce and a finish of dark roast coffee. Smells delicious and beautifully balanced.  T: Like giving God a rim job. Holy. Shit. The level of sweetness is somewhat subtler and comes off absolutely PERFECT on the palate. Chocolate and vanilla battle for dominance within an oak bourbon barrel, but coffee comes in and beats the crap out of both of them, with a little assistance from soy sauce and herbal hops. Finish is acidic, dark-roasted coffee with no cloying sweetness, and just a hint of hops that complement the roast.  F: Smooth, with a creamy consistency like whole milk. Not syrupy at all, as you might think from the smell. I would guess this crisp finish is likely the first attribute that would suffer with age.  O: SO damn good. It brings me back to my single random encounter with BCBS. Definitely a world-class BA Stout.  Edit: P. S. Had another one a little colder in the evening as an experiment. My assessment is that it is acceptable to drink this brew at any temperature between 45-65°F, but peak deliciousness is somewhere in the higher range, around 58°.

Coffee up front, with hints of chocolate - chocolate flavors finish stronger with coffee notes lingering and the sensation and flavorings of the bourbon starting to come into the picture. M - Perfect. O - Wow. Again. Was somewhat expecting this to be over hyped and plagued by group think but this is truly an exceptional beer!

1199,19960,NextBestThing,4.73,"This beer is a legend and another that has somehow become fashionable to take shots at, sort of like Hopslam and a bunch of others. Not sure how Bourbon County escapes this, maybe because it's a sloppy boozy mess? Anyway, absolutely easier to find than it was two or three or 8 years ago, but still outstanding.  I get about 1/8 inch of head after an aggressive pour, quickly dissipating into a ring of tight, creamy foam around the perimeter of the glass. Not quite black but very dark. Aroma dominated by chocolate moreso than coffee, light bourbon on the nose. Not overpowering whatsoever. Excellent.  Tastes like it smells. Very smooth going in and zero alcohol burn. I would never guess that this beer is even similar in abv to say, Black Note. Nice chocolate flavor, very faint coffee presence, zero alcohol. This is not to say that it's a training wheels beer, but rather it's approachable and actually superb.  Medium body, decent carbonation, which surprised me. Similar in the mouth to the last batch of CBS.  This beer remains world class. I do not have anything close to a criticism of the beer itself, and it's not even difficult to find anymore.

What is truly amazing is that this 2018 release has 12.3% ABV in it and you CANNOT tell it is that strong. Masterful blending! I've had beers at 9% ABV and you can tell it is strong by the burning alcohol. Not this beer!  Inky black in color, khaki colored head, smells of cocoa and coffee. The taste is VERY smooth. The bitters are there but it reminds me of the sort of bite that you get from drinking Barqs Root Beer. It doesn't turn your face inside out, very smooth and easy to drink. SO easy to drink.  This is my first time trying KBS so I can't compare it to prior years but comparing this to other stouts... this is my 2nd favorite stout I've ever tried. I've tried several stouts and they are often WAY too bitter. This is more my style. Really good beer! The negatives is how expensive it is and how difficult it can be to acquire.  I'm drinking it to celebrate finishing my taxes! I needed something to uplift me after such a grueling tax season. Note to the wise: drink this carefully.

The 2016 and 2017 were phenomenal. 2018 (this review)is a bit too coffee forward which eclipses the bourbon and chocolate profiles. A hard pour into a snifter glass gives a nice tan head. Tilt pours don’t fully form the head. I smell the coffee more than the bourbon, chocolate or oaky barrel. The beer itself is as dark as my soul.

Smell - The smell of coffee and chocolate was very noticeable immediately upon opening, even from a few feet away. There are also significant notes of wood from the barrel-aging as well as a cinnamon note I didn't expect.  Taste - This is coffee forward, but almost a flavored coffee. It was like a cinnamon espresso type flavor. The chocolate was actually more subtle than expected given how strong it was on the nose. The vanilla was also prevalent, along with a certain dry, woodiness. Some boozy notes are present as well, but overall the cinnamon takes the stage.  Feel - This was surprisingly smooth and creamy, like an Irish stout, rather than thick and oily like so many other barrel aged stouts.  Overall - This is an absolutely delicious cinnamon coffee with cream stout. I have no idea where the cinnamon came from, but it was there. This had a great balance of sweet and bitter to it. Overall I really enjoyed this, definitely more than last year's release.  Pairs Well With - An afternoon pick-me-up.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

About 2 and a half fingers width of a frothy tan head was attained from a simple pour (which dissipated rapidly). Good amount of lacing on the glass. Smell: Oak forward, with slight chocolate presence. Some coffee is present on the nose, but I am not picking up much. Bourbon isn't detectible on the nose. Taste: Oak, oak, ash, and more oak. The flavor is overpowered by the oak barrel presence. Even as it warms, the chocolate does become more pronounced, but at minimal levels compared to the oak. I am not sure, but taste wise I am not enjoying this as much as I hoped. The bourbon flavor is present on the finish, but yet again, the oak overpowers in a woody sense. Feel: Medium body and medium weight, with moderate carbonation for the style. Overall: I was really disappointed with this years KBS. The oak was just too overpowering for my liking.

Thick and creamy, chewy and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation.  O: An extremely complex, chewy beer with world class mouthfeel and some great flavor profiles working well together. The only element that keeps it from being as good as CBS or Morning Wood in my opinion is that there is some heat and grain alcohol smell and taste that is objectionable.

The draft tastes slightly more alcoholic than its counterpart. If your vessel is a bottle, pour this guy hard to create a creamy foam that is bursting with chocolate aroma. The first sip delivers velvety bourbon flavor followed by chocolate and coffee. The most surprising thing with this beer is how smooth the beer is given the ABV. Not much alcohol taste compared to many other bourbon barrel aged beers. Very well crafted. If you are deciding between this and CBS, get both.

1199,19960,BayAreaJoe,4.53,"2018 Release  Bottled 2/22/18, consumed 4/7/18  L: Deep, dark black with about an inch of tan head that left terrific lacing. Holding this up to the light, no brown or red here folks, this is all black.  A: Heavy bourbon with a little bit of coffee and roasted malts. A little intimidating at first, even though you know this beer is about the bourbon - after a few sips, loving this aroma more and more.  T: Oh man, just an absolutely wonderful balance of a strong imperial stout with the deep, rich bourbon flavor. Not overbearing at all - bourbon here is better blended than Backwoods Bastard. Coffee, malts, some chocolate, this treat has it all.  F: Smooth, suprisingly medium for such a strong ABV brew, low but solid bitterness. Pretty clean, delightful sipper, whiskey doesn't linger.

1199,19960,beersampler6,4.44,"Original review (on 4/7/18, National Beer Day):  look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5  Smooth stout with strong notes of chocolate and coffee, weaker hints of bourbon, vanilla and oak. Nice dark almost-black color but not as rich or creamy as I was expecting. I was disappointed and expected a greater beer considering all the hype that surrounds KBS week every year. Surprisingly subtle mouthfeel.  Updated review (on 8/21/18):  Really wanted to give the famous KBS another try since I was disappointed the first time around - maybe I had a bad batch? Also saw the opportunity to try it on tap, and boy am I glad I did. Completely different experience! Great dark brown, almost black color with immediate great frothy tan head that slowly faded, along with some nice sheets of lingering lacing. Smells of dark coffee, chocolate and a little vanilla. Tastes of dark roast coffee, dark slightly bitter chocolate, molasses, vanilla, malt and a little caramel. Great bourbon oak undertones with some hints of sweetness. Smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel and just the right amount of carbonation. High ABV is well-hidden in this beer’s incredible flavor. Not too heavy or overpowering at all.

I was mostly surprised at how strong the taste and smell of bourbon was. Unfortunately bourbon is not my taste in beer too much . I liked the beer but I can’t say I loved it because of that.

L: black with a good dark head. It's frothy and delicious looking.  S: this smells great. You can pick up a bit of heat from a high alcohol content, dark chocolates, coffee, and bourbon.  T: oaky, with bourbon and chocolate. Lots of good roasted malts and some nice heat from the booze.  F: smooth, creamy, with light carbonation. Very pleasant.

Dark would be an understatement of this stout’s color as no light escapes this pitch black beverage with dark lacing. Bourbon, oak, dark bitter chocolate, and dark roasted coffee flavors. The higher level of alcohol creates a bit of sweetness to complement the malt but not enough tgat id call thus a sweet stout at all. A note of a bitter dark chocolate lingers in the aftertaste alongside the bourbon flavor. Moderately full-bodied beer that seems a bit lighter due to the higher carbonation.

1199,19960,micada,4.9,"Lucky enough to catch a few 4-packs of 12-oz bottles, 2018 vintage. I don't know what all the hype is about... oh wait, yes I do. It's nothing less than entirely delicious and way too easy to drink quickly and frequently. On aggressive pour to a snifter, jet black and makes a tall, tight bubbly, mocha brown head. After a few minutes, the tight bubbles change to open cell, which eventually fade to a thin tan ring with lacing that stays. The nose is primarily dark chocolate, with a hint of coffee/espresso. First sips follow the nose, plus a tiny hint of bourbon. Mouthfeel is full, thick, with great lasting flavor. Alcohol is nowhere to be found, so drink carefully. No real hint of any hoppiness or acidity, just sweet and dark malt. Mellowness and drinkability reminds me of the 7-year aged DFH WWS, without the wait. Agree with other poster about stockpiling, if there's any left, is a good idea, especially considering how difficult it has been to score in my area at release...this year being an exception. A little more warming brings in more bourbon up front, then the coffee/espresso, with a chocolate linger. It disappeared too fast..a crushable stout! Just be home when you do that. I also scored two 2015 at Christmas, cellaring, which now seem at risk of being popped.  2019 notes: more bourbon forward, followed by coffee, with a hint of cocoa. Pretty hoppy on the tongue, which should mellow over time. Pours dark and thick, with a dark tan head that burns fast. No legs, no lacing. Alcohol is a little present, but stays balanced.

Smells of cocoa, (good!) black coffee, a little bourbon, and a hint of barrel char.  Flavor is bourbon, cocoa, bourbon, coffee, a little barrel tannin,and ending with a slight bit of bourbon ""heat/flame"", and light bitterness, that linger on the tip of the tongue. I see others lamenting lack of bourbon, but for me, I think I will probably like it better when that mellows & blends a slight bit more. Will have to revisit.  Feel is moderately thick/oily/creamy initially, then a little very fine carbonation prickle, that comes and goes 'til the end.  I don't have much to compare it to, as '16 was the first time I arrived in time to get it, gave away all but 1 bottle, and there was a heavy snowstorm in '17, & I only got there in time to get 1 bottle. As such , maybe that's why I'm not disappointed, as other regular imbibers of it seem to be, in their reviews/comments. :) [I.e., enjoy what's in your glass, that such wonders are in your glass,BAs. :)] That said, if I am remembering correctly, and I may not be, I liked '16 slightly better.

1199,19960,kemoarps,4.27,"2016 batch  Pour is that just shy of black dark brown that lets no light through. Wet brown head dissipates fairly quickly, but leaves some decent lacing as I sip on this. Nose is actually pretty underwhelming. I'm not getting much... in general. There's some char and dark chocolate and coffee and a touch of booze which I attribute to the bourbon, but honestly it's all a lot more faint than I'd anticipated. Less 'subtle' than just low volume. Flavour though... well. This salvages what was turning into a mild disappointment. A bold front of roast burns away quickly revealing acrid black coffee and bitter dark chocolate. A touch of oak, but only just a touch. After that crescendo the release is a long smoothe brown slope of creamy dark chocolate with flecks of coffee bean that carries through the finish and leaves the same lingering mouth coatin feeling of eating a bunch of high quality dark chocolate. Decent amount of carbonation but only a medium body at best, the alcohol is folded in well and serves more to warm the belly than to burn the throat. Like, I KNOW that it's double digits ABV, but it's easy to forget.  KBS has an incredible reputation. Founders in general is well known for (among other things) having an unparalleled touch with dark grains. I am glad to (further) confirm both of these as true for myself.

There is no booze taste to it at all, but that's part of the problem for me. I want to smell the bourbon in it and it's just not there. Nothing but coffee.

1199,19960,Nass,3.36,Let's review the highly sought after and hard to come by Founders KBS. Founders is a real hit or miss brewery. Some of there stuff is the best beer around town and some of it is downright dreadful to drink. That high abv is not perfectly hidden. Due to the barrel aging the coffee & chocolate have been flattened out. The bourbon is definitely there but it does not seem to be mixing well with the other adjuncts that they put in it. This is a big & boozy mess. This is interesting because their regular breakfast stout seems to always be a crowd pleaser in the fall & winter time. I don't see what the fuss is all about for this beer. For me this beer does not deserve the praise that it's receiving. Cheers!

You can immediately discern major differences, the biggest of which to me was that KBS has much more dark fruit flavor than BCBS, which really punches you in the face with huge smoke and chocolate flavors.

The beer is a pitch black brew with a thinner dark brown crown. Resembles mocha. The crown doesn't stay around for as long as I thought it would. Just a couple of minutes and it only has an outer ring. The smell is boozy and chocolately. Almost like a cocoa powder. After that it has hints of barrel and coffee. The taste has the bourbon in the front, the chocolate in the middle and the barrel and coffee in the back. Very balanced. Nothing stealing one thing from the other but just showing different times to come in. Like a well rehearsed play. The feeling is warm right off the bat, but not burning in any way. The chocolate and coffee coats the mouth as it goes through and stays, leaving you clearing your mouth absorbing all the flavor. Overall, I love the consistency of this beer.

The robust nose is still excellent, the chocolate now overpowers the bourbon and coffee and the oak seems to have disappeared. The alcohol is nearly absent.  The taste follows suit, chocolate, coffee, bourbon, and oak barrel flavors harmonize. The flavors have tailed off a little and aren't quite as synergistic as they once were but are still very balanced. The alcohol combines with the caramel malt to add a nice leaf tobacco burn.

It smells okay a little bourbony but it is so thin in body and quite awful in taste that it had to go down the drain this year! Thankfully I had a Yeti on reserve. Okay if you want to get a buzz I guess at 12.3% but in the taste and body they royally blew it this year. I mean really bad. Don't waste your money if you prefer a stout with some body and taste substance to it. Do spend $22 a 4 pack if you like a watery and barely bourbony and lacking substance beer. The only substance this beer has is high ABV... there must be more than just High ABV to equal a beer worth buying for me.

1199,19960,Zythophile,4.47,"Bottle Date: 2017 Palate Contaminants: other beer  The look is a down-the-middle dark brown with a very small amount of fine head.  The smell is dark malt and freshly ground coffee, very freshly ground. There's as much depth to that as anything I've had, not bitter at all. I get some desiccated fruit, as well, mostly non-sweet dates. Concentrated vanilla starts to show up as it warms.  The taste (for me) is raw cookie dough in the base. Some of the flavors (coffee and vanilla, namely) I often get in a brew, but there's a level of savoriness that I haven't run across before for those flavors. It has plenty of coffee, but there's also a slightly lactic sweetness. I keep getting close to saying bitter cocoa, but it keeps splintering into separate things, meaning I can never really pinpoint some sort of chocolate. Vanilla extract pervades the taste, and the level is very even throughout. I do get a little alcohol heat, but that's only because I was really paying attention to my first ever bottle. The only bitterness is on the back end, and it's slight.  The sweetness is lacking in the aftertaste, but there's lots of savory coffee left. It's very smooth with foamy carbonation, but I can get a little prickliness out of it.  As Darth Vader said, ""Impressive. Most Impressive.""",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Nose is primarily vanilla, oak and of course bourbon boozyness with a long lingering damp musty forest. Dark toasted oak and bitter black coffee dominate at first with a brow rich earth. A sweet creamy vanilla bean icecream shines through the middle just briefly. More booze comes out at the end with dried leaves and cedar finishing surprisingly dry.

1199,19960,Snowcrash000,4.65,"Pours a pitch-black coloration with a medium, creamy, mocha-colored head. Smells intensely of roasted, caramel malt, coffee, chocolate, vanilla and a hint of bourbon. Taste is an amazing balance of roasted, caramel malt and rich roasted coffee and dark chocolate notes, as well as some vanilla and lighter notes of licorice, bourbon, oak and just a hint of dark fruit and herbal, earthy hops. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some roasted malt, coffee and chocolate lingering in the aftertaste. Full, creamy mouthfeel with a rich body and light/medium carbonation.  An outstanding beer with a fantastic depth of flavor and balance, with all the different notes subtly complementing each other and nothing really standing out too much, which is a good thing. I don't think I've ever had this at less than a year old, which doesn't really bother me though. I can imagine the coffee being more intense in this fresh, but it's still there and the chocolate just comes out so much more with some age on it. I can also imagine the booziness mellowing out a bit, because this really doesn't have a lot of it going on at over 12% ABV at all, which is a good thing yet again. The subtle balance of rich flavors really is what makes this so amazing, even though it may lack quite the complexity and mouthfeel of something like BCBS, although it certainly makes up for that with a vastly better availability and value-for-money.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Aroma is coffee oils, baker's chocolate, and browned butter. Palette is deep, complex sweetness, recalling sticky toffee pudding with boozy raisins. The bourbon is mild, lending some rubber-ish heat that joins the bitter coffee to tame the decadence. Throaty heat increases as things settle.  Mouthfeel is smooth, but slightly thinner and more effervescent than what would be optimal for the taste. Denser head might help out here.

Aroma – Coffee and chocolate. Coffee fades somewhat allowing a little bourbon to come through. Chocolate remains. Head – Large (Maximum 5.7 cm, aggressive pour), brown, medium density froth, good retention, diminishing to an irregular four to seven mm creamy ring fed by gentle effervescence and a complete layer with a raised rocky hillock. No detached lacing. Lacing – Not very good, but typical of BBA at the higher alcohol levels (11.8% ABV). Two columns of tiny to medium bubbles, connected to the receding ring. Body – Dark brown/black, opaque. Flavor – Alcohol, coffee, and chocolate. Some bourbon, particularly in the aftertaste. No hops, no diacetyl. Palate – Medium, creamy, lively carbonation.  Impression: A very good BBA stout, although somewhat alcohol-forward. The chocolate and coffee are well balanced and hold their own against the alcohol.

1199,19960,dubbschism,4.68,"First ever review. I picked up a four pack of the 2017 vintage back in June and this is my third time having this.  Look: Violent pour into a 16oz tulip produces a one-finger khaki head that sticks around for a minute or so. Color is black as the night, slight bubbles rising to the top.  Smell: Vanilla, bourbon, faint coffee.  Taste: Smooth chocolate and coffee up front, booze and oak on the end. Coffee lingers, especially as it warms up. A gorgeous melange of decadent flavors that makes this style so appealing to me.  Feel: This is where the 2017 loses points - it is too carbonated for me, with an effervescence that is distracting. However it is still thick and coats the tongue, though not as viscous as I'd like it to be on account of the bubbles.  Overall: I prefer the prior vintages of this that I've been fortunate enough to have (2015 and 2016) but it is still a premium BA stout. It's always nice to walk into a packy or gas station and be surprised to find this is available (though it doesn't happen very often!) - there is definitely something to be said in favor of widespread distribution, from time to time.

Well, I couldn't believe my eyes when I stumbled across a 2016 release at a craft beer store on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, Brazil! It cost the equivalent of $17 for one 12-oz shorty, but I couldn't pass it up. Poured jet black, viscous, into a small glass, yielding a small tan head without much retention. The aroma is of roasted espresso beans as well as some more raw and assertive wet coffee grinds, warm dried fruits such as raisins and dates, bitter dark chocolate, cinnamon, burnt caramel and other roasted and toasted dark malts, some booze, oak. Not the most aromatic stout I've had, but inviting nonetheless. Taste is of all of the above, with the roasted espresso and the bittersweet toasted caramel malts dominating, with bitter chocolate and some barrel character and booze. Thick and resinous body, mouth coating, some alcohol burn present, with a long finish that it is a bit bitter, mainly from the malts.

Very pretty beer to drink.  very smooth taste .Dark Chocolate ,vanilla, bourbon. Those are all top notch complex flavor profiles .  savoriness level is great.  I opened this beer expecting to be disappointed. 2017 release sat on the shelves at my local and seemed like a fall off from previous years. To me it tasted aged or overly mellowed already upon release. Now it just the same solid beer it has been over the years, smoother maybe. Buy as much as possible rating increased. Founders is great.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Jtee,4.95,"From a 355ml bottle served at 11 degrees Celsius into a snifter. The beer warmed up to room temperature during consumption. Best by date: 20.12.2017. 11.9% ABV confirmed.  Look: It's like pouring used engine oil out of a bottle. An opaque black with .5cm of mocha head that basically has no retention. A partial film is formed on top of the beer after it quickly dissipates. Poor retention which comes as no surprise for such high ABV beer. Some lacing.  Smell: Bam! Strong, sharp, rich, and complex. The beer hits you with a massive range of dark, roasted malts with slightly burned notes of coffee, dark chocolate, caramel, licorice, tobacco, and restrained bourbon. Faint alcohol note.  Taste: Bam! Like a sledgehammer. Strong (read intense) and bitter. Major notes are roasted malts (borderline charred), chocolate, coffee, and bourbon. I'm also detecting some dark fruit, tobacco, licorice, and caramel. The finish is long, strong, and the bourbon really comes through here.  Feel: Full body and mild carbonation. Heavy, thick, and slightly chewy with mild astringency and restrained alcohol warmth.  Overall: Big, bold, complex, and harmonious. Wonderfully balanced displaying excellent craftsmanship. World class and a must-try. My favourite bourbon barrel-aged beer so far. I think the beer lives up to the hype, however I'm left wondering how much I've been affected by it and to what extent does the hunt and the price tag have an effect. I suppose in any case you should grab a bottle if you can.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,taxandbeerguy,4.52,"355 ml bottle served cold into a tulip. Purchased 9 of these for $7.25 apiece. This has been on my beers to try for 3 and a half years so I made sure to stock up. Still can barely believe its in Canada. Best before December 2017. I believe this is most recent vintage and advertised at 11.9% ABV. A fine way to conclude the Canada Day weekend.  Appearance - dark, dark brown, nearly black ominous. Capped with a finger and a half of frothy tan head. Some spotty lacing on the glass. Good if not quite great head retention.  Smell - dark chocolate and secondarily coffee to an extent I have rarely experienced. Vanilla shines through too with something akin to marshmallow as it warms. The bourbon starts showing up in copious quantities as the beer gets closer to room temperature. Effing phenomenal. Quite possibly the best nose on a beer ever. If not then in my lifetime which is good enough for me.  Taste - chocolate and creamy with some vanilla, plenty of bourbon as well. Bold flavors throughout, but the flavors ramp up a couple notches of intensity as it warms. Complex with lots of roasty notes and some bitterness, yet enough sweetness and richness to be a dessert beer on its own. At times can finish a little hot and boozy.  Mouthfeel - smooth, voluptuous, dense and heavy. Well carbonated, yet easy enough to drink on a summer's night. Flavours stick, but not cloying and the beer has enough balance to make this the truth.  Overall - as the label reads KBS is a very different beer than the breakfast stout. While it doesn't put out just incredible intense (coffee) flavor, it puts out many, culminating in a delicious dessert beer that's just fine on its own. While possibly not quite as good as the original, still an incredible beer worth all the praise it has ever received. Worthy of the hype!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Most of it dissipates fairly quickly but it lines the edges until the final chug.  Aroma is coffee, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, molasses. Sweet yet savory. Loads of chocolate but you can easily appreciate all of the the aromas as well.  Taste is rich chocolate. So rich. Just a deep bourbony, chocolaty blend of flavor. Sweet but not cloying.  Feel is heavy, lightly carbonated, smooth, and creamy.  Overall, the most balanced BA stout I have ever had. No one flavor dominates-- the coffee, chocolate, and bourbon all shine through in the just the right amounts.

1199,19960,WickedBeer,4.69,"Picked up at Stagecoach Liquors in Newbury Park, CA. 2016 release, bottled on 2/11/2016. 12.4% ABV. 12oz bottle.  Look: Pours a beautiful jet black. Very small head of dark tan foam. Very thin, quickly dissipating lace. Smell: Overwhelming coffee hits you initially. It is quickly met by an amazing sweet chocolate that perfectly balances the initial coffee bitterness. An evidence of toasty caramel malts plays with the back of your nose. Taste: Again, you're met first with a great bitter coffee. A sweet boozy warmth comes next, with a subtle breadiness and more of a dark chocolate feel. Feel: While it pours very thick, the mouthfeel was surprisingly thin with a much stronger carbonation than I expected! While you don't get too many hints that this beer is 12.4% from the taste, you feel that bourbon burn in your stomach right away and get a nice stickiness with each sip. A smooth beer, even with that surprisingly high carbonation. It also does thicken as it warms.  Overall this beer is fantastic as I predicted it would be. Coffee dominates the profile , but with a great balance from the chocolate, caramel, and booze. This beer had such incredible hype that nothing short of perfect would have lived up to it. It definitely nears the top of my stout lists, however if in my opinion I'd place Alesmith's Speedway Stout and North Coast's Old Rasputin IRS slightly ahead of it.

1199,19960,biboergosum,4.33,"12oz bottle, shared by a shitty (sorry, 'know it all') random at rogerdandy's latest typically epic bottle share, while I monitored everyone's frolicking spawn in the backyard, because, y'know.  This beer pours a solid black hole, with two flabby fingers of medium brown head, which leaves some scattered island chain lace around the glass as it slowly sinks away.  It smells of pungent Bourbon barrel notes - bittersweet cocoa powder, cafe-au-lait, grainy and roasted caramel malt, black licorice, and a further barely-restrained oaken booziness. The taste is bready and doughy caramel malt, some free-range ashiness, bitter coffee, still heady Bourbon (the barrel and the whiskey therein), milk chocolate, anise candies, and a weak earthy, leafy, and perfumed floral hoppiness.  The carbonation is quite average in its meek-ass frothiness, the body a decent middle-heavyweight, and dead, dead smooth, with a nice, full and rounded creaminess, to boot. It finishes in a sweet confectionery and saucy, southern Bourbon manner, if I do say so myself.  Overall, this is certainly a stellar big-boy brew, with lots and lots of the promised and expected flavours, while not disappointing in the least. Totally worth sampling or imbibing deeply should one get the opportunity at a later date. We shall see, we shall see.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium to lowly carbonated and balanced in terms of bitterness. Overall, great. This is a case study in balance.

Nose for me was predominantly a dark chocolate, not much of the bourbon barrel I was hoping for from a highly acclaimed brew. Taste followed, lots of dark chocolate. I drank this one slowly, let it warm but never really got the barrel presence I was hoping for. Maybe a little hint of coffee. Mouthfeel was nice, thick and almost oily.

Could be that the 2016 has mellowed out a bit in that regard. You get the barrel and a bit of bourbon on both 16' and 17' equally.  2017 Kbs, pours a deep jet black with minimal head. The nose is coffee forward with a little caramel and bourbon mixed in. Taste of coffee and then a bit more coffee! Under the coffee is a nice roasted malt, caramel and vanilla flavor. You get the bourbon and a bit of wood on the backend. Mouthfeel is a little thin on the 17 version so it's missing a bit of the creaminess that the 16 had but there is still enough there that I didn't dock the score too much.

1199,19960,Dinglehacker,4.54,"Poured into snifter. Not much head, but its a lovely light brown. Opaque black.  Nose is bourbon sweetness, roast, and some coffee. A little boozy in the nostrils.  Taste: dark chocolate, barrel sweet, dark roasted coffee, all coming in to play with equal range.  Full bodied, like drinking silk. A little warm, but not too much.  Claimed by some as the codifier (if not the originator) of the barrel aged stout craze, and a fine example at that. All the ingredient balance well in the taste, making this a real breakfast of champions.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,rifleman_zach,4.64,"2017 release poured into a chilled tulip. Bottled 02.02.2017.  The smell isn't really anything out of the norm of a great stout. Nots of chocolate and bourbon. Not much of a coffee scent I felt.  This release is my favorite by far!!! The coffee is prominent, I love it. There is a light and sweet bourbon flavored finish. The flavors of this release are layered so well, the chocolate flavor really smooths everything out. Tye carbonation seems a little more than the prior year but that could be due to the aging of the 2016 release. Poursed nicely with a thick caramel colored head.  Over all an amazing release of my favorite Founders stout. Cant wait to pop open the '17 bomber that is currently aging in the back of my fridge. Great release, wll be buying more to drink fresh.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,B0shes,4.96,"2017 Release poured into a snifter. Looks are anything interesting. Very little head or lacing.  Like any good stout, smells of burnt chocolate... but so much better than any other good stout. Best description is that the chocolate note is thicker and more natural, not a single artificial smell.  Taste is perfect. Not bitter, slightly sweet, slightly creamy/dairy tasting. Again, natural chocolate. No flavor tastes like it is added; they all blend together as if they were just naturally part of the beer. There is a subtle sweet bourbon aftertaste. I don't like bourbon, but I like the taste of it in this beer. Not easy to explain, but it adds a wonderful complexity to the beer.  The beer is much more sharply carbonated than I expected, but it works well. Beer is a little sticky, but not cloying or negative at all.  Overall, a damn perfect beer. So many beers try to be something and have overwhelming flavor notes that are far too obvious to enjoy. A chocolate coffee stout should be a chocolate coffee stout, not a stout that tastes like chocolate and coffee. This beer doesn't try to be anything, it just is.

Taste: Bourbon comes through first and foremost, but dances with the coffee, chocolate, wood, and vanilla notes in perfect harmony. Feel: Very little CO2 as you'd expect. The beer is chewy but not syrupy. Overall: I love dark beers way more than should be appropriate for someone born and raised in San Diego, and I really fell in love with this beer. It lives up to the hype and if you're a dark beer lover like me or enjoy barrel-aged beers, this is a must-try and perhaps the quintessential bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,drtth,4.49,"This 12 oz bottle is from the 2017 release and so fairly fresh.  The dark dark brown, almost black, liquid pours out into a snifter glass with 1/2” dark tan head that slowly but visibly recedes to a thin film over part of the liquid and leaves a partial ring-like band of lacing on the sides of the glass. Sipping creates some arches, patches and small legs of lacing, some of which cling as other slide back down to the tiny ring of foam around the glass.  The aromas are first noticeable when the bottle is opened. In the glass they remind of Bourbon, but also include some coffee, chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and some touches of oak from the barrels. While bourbon is there it is very well integrated with with the other aromas and almost hard to sort out from the other aromas.  The flavors are also a very complex and well integrated package that is noticeably Bourbon-like but includes the coffee with chocolate, a bit of dark bread, some sweetness, some vanilla both as part of the Bourbon flavor profile but also from the oak since there are also a few woody notes from the oak way in the background. The alcohol is well concealed.  The mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy smooth with some light, fairly persistent carbonation. The finish begins as the complex flavor profile begins to fade to away, allowing a bit of warmth/bite from the alcohol to emerge in the back of the palate along with some coffee like bitterness mingled with some noticeable but very light Bourbon character which seems to persist in the back of the palate a very long time, even after the bitterness is gone.  This is absolutely a well made beer and is well worth having again. I expect I’ll be doing so since I’m not convinced I’ve unraveled all that is intertwingled in the flavor profile. That said, KBS is also a one a night sipping beer, both because of the high ABV and because of the challenging complexity of the aromas and flavor. BTW, this beer is fairly temperature sensitive in that when still chilled the aromas and flavors seem to be all about the Bourbon. But once it warms…. The beer definitely lives up to its reputation and is worth trying at least once. In some ways I think I enjoy the KBS more than I did the BCBS from Goose Island. But then it’s also likely my palate has matured a lot since I had my first 4 pack of BCBS.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

It went from a finger a bright khaki-tan ultra finely carbonated head down to a darker half finger of mocha tan around the edges, punctuated by bigger beautiful bubbles. Smells of coffee/chocolate ice cream with a hint of woody bourbon heat and tobacco. Taste is verily similar to the smell but the burn from the bourbon comes across pretty heavily, however, the finish is a lot more delicious bitter coffee notes and creaminess, especially as the beer warms up to room temperature. This brew is densely packed with flavor without feeling too viscous on the tongue. Really great imperial breakfast stout. It lives up to the hype.

Hints of plum and vanilla. T -- Tastes like an Irish coffee that's had a liberal amount of chocolate syrup added to it. Damn good and damn drinkable.

1199,19960,jaketaz,4.42,"2017 batch found in FL and poured hard from bottle to goblet. The first thing I notice is the thick, dark head resembling coffee Haagen Dazs. Dissipates quickly and doesn't leave much leg, body thick but not completely black - like a strong coffee.  Contrary to what I'm reading here I only smell a little bit of chocolate, and milk not dark. Most of the aroma is coffee and bourbon barrel, including what you would expect from the barrel toast (salted caramel, vanilla, black cherry). I thought it smelled super chocolatey at first, but it's just the placebo effect from reading too many reviews. The nose is vanilla dominant.  It's impressively smooth considering the amount of alcohol, I'm having trouble coming up with any heavyweight stouts that can match this for smoothness (Marshal Zhukov being one of the few). For my money it trounces Goose Island's ""Bourbon County"" series, easily beats Stone's ""W00tstout"" and obliterates Weyerbacher's ""Sunday Morning"". The whiskey barrel heat is just obvious enough to identify and doesn't make the taste harsh at all.  At $26 a 4-pack in my area I can't say for sure whether it's worth it compared to Founders' regular ""Breakfast Stout"". To my taste the smoothness isn't superior, the aroma is possibly inferior. But I am glad I bought it to finally experience what all the hype is about. I would say this beer's best attribute is its balance and smoothness... for all the hype barrel-aged stouts get they tend to be abrasive and bitter.

1199,19960,Terptwerp,4.27,"Had this on tap at Duckworth's in Huntersville. It is a very good imperial stout with hints of chocolate, vanilla and coffee. I was expecting a little more bourbon than there was. The flavors blended together very well. A very good beer, but not my favorite bourbon barrel stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,sokol_1993,4.12,"Got a goblet of KBS 2017 on tap at Bier Baron, DC. Look: Dark black, with little head. Dissipated quickly too.

1199,19960,Dakin,4.78,"2017 Edition  Look: Beautiful thick dark milkshake-esque look. Silky smooth tan head. Looks like a nitro. Super nice lacing. Loving the look of this beer.  Smell: Rich baker's chocolate, perhaps some dark chocolate, perfectly mixed with an expensive tasting dark black chocolate. Touch of malt balls. Whiskey barrel aging is evident in the nose. Gives it a nice subtle heat. Cherry oak. Amazing. Smells very high quality.  Taste: AMAZING chocolaty taste. Like melted m&ms and cold rich coffee. Nice touch of whiskey heat. No trace of alcohol though. Very simple but RICH. Excellently balanced. Would be incredible with a nice big breakfast skillet. The hype is real, this is worth it. Blows their normal breakfast stout of the water.  Feel: Thick, nitro feel. Surprising mouthfeel.  Overall: Absolutely amazing. One of the best beers I've ever had. Incredibly balanced and measured. Simple. Rich. Premium. This is the epitome of what a stout shout be. Cave aged for one year in Jack Daniel's whiskey barrels. Worth the price and lives up to the hype for sure. 9.5/10.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,BrewsOverHoes,4.41,"12 oz. bottle, 2017 Version, poured into a Founders KBS glass! Proper?  Look: Deep and dark, pitch black as I pour, light mocha head on the top, not lingering for too long. Didn't seem as dense (motor oil consistency) as year's past.  Smell: Plenty of roasted malts, dark chocolate and fresh coffee grounds; lending to a hint of vanilla (from the barrel) and the bourbon is subdued at the end.  Taste: Following suite with the aroma; vanilla, chocolate, a bitter espresso, and roasted malt. Not a boozy or hot beer at all, the bourbon is integrated nicely and pokes it head out as this warms to room temperature.  Feel: Not going to lie: I wish their was a touch more thickness and body. Seems a hair lighter than past batches and it's noticeable to me; not just to be objective and say ""Last year's was better."" It's not watery thin by any means, yet just a complexity I'm missing. The carbonation is nice and it's really drinkable sitting at 11.8%.  Overall: KBS is always worth a search if it's readily available to you in April. Definitely a big beer, but it goes down so easy it's frustrating how quick it goes. Just a world class stout as usual. Excellent, all round.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,Tampalocal5577,4.3,This is the 2017 bottle. The 2017 batch is good but not legendary. The negative thing I'll say is that the mouthfeel is thinner than past years. It's almost as if they added more water to stretch it further to make more money. It's still KBS but just not on the level of past years.

Had no snifters so I used a shaker pint for my pour. It's a very dark, opaque brown, with some scant beige foam at the edges. Lacing is somewhat light but still ok. Aroma has a luscious mix of choco, caramel, molasses and bourbon. Body is medium to medium-plus, and it is rather smooth.  Flavor picks up where the nose leaves off... Choco, vanilla, mocha, caramel... has some subtle intimations of dark fruit.... on the back side there's some earthy, tobacco-like notes.... Overall, pretty frigging tasty. World beater?

The bourbon here just feels much more warm and rich and pronounced, its such a perfect combination of flavors, just a really really pleasant drinking experience",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Thomas_Wikman,4.5,"After years of failure to get it, I finally had Founders KBS. I should say I never stood in line for it, but I often stopped at the store after work the day they got it, and they were already out. This year they still had a couple left three days after they arrived at the store. I've heard that the 2017 version was not as good as previous releases, I know nothing about that, I still loved it. Hyped beers may not always be worth the hype but they are often (but not always) hyped for a good reason, and that is true for this one.  Look: it’s jet black with a thick mocca colored head that stays.  Aroma: the aroma is roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, and vanilla, maybe a hint of bourbon.  Taste: There's roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, some bourbon, exactly as I expected. However, it is really well put together in a perfect mix like Neuhause's best chocolate cake with coffee.  Feel: medium body, creamy and smooth mouthfeel",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,Premo88,4.46,"12 oz. bottle poured into vertical goblet (2017 release)  L: classic black-and-tan stout look in the glass, though it's clear dark dark brown/claret pouring out of the bottle; pushes up about 3/5-inch head of tan foam, doesn't stick a ton but it's keeping a very thick, soapy-bubble collar and most of a skin ... this collar is something else and fun to look at  S: figgy fruitcake, dusty Belgian dubbel/quad note, molasses-chocolate milkshake with lots of whipped cream, vanilla extract; as it warms, becomes an all-chocolate milk shake ... milk chocolate, cafe mocha, a hint of dark chocolate and loads of vanilla to sweeten it even more ... so perfect it's not even a question  T: bourbon smoothed out by chocolate, cafe mocha, sharp astringent coffee; then smoothing out and sweetening up with loads of milk chocolate as it warms; the alcohol is present ... not what I'd call ""hot"" (surely the time in the barrel tamed it some) but there is definitely a pinch of alcohol flavor and loads of warmth in the throat; bourbon flavor exists mostly in the finish and aftertaste, even some oak wood in there, but this isn't peaty single-malt Scotch -- this is sweet ol' Kentucky nectar  F: light for a big stout but well filled out with good carbonation ... still has a thick quality to it, almost chewy at times, but overall no more than a firm middleweight  O: obviously good, KBS' best quality for me might be that it comes in four-packs of 12 oz. bottles, a much easier serving size to deal with than the 22 or 25.4 oz. bomber which is often standard issue for big BA stouts; it doesn't stand out from several of the other good BA stouts I've had, but it definitely hangs with all of them, and the smooth milk chocolate finish as it warms is better than most; I'll buy this often ... as often as I can find it in my neck of Texas",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Nickwierda,4.91,"Wow best vintage (2017) of the past three years hands down (I've only had Kbs 15, 16, and 17).  A: stout black. Head is lighter though, unlike FIS which has one of the darkest heads I've ever seen on a beer.  S: super coffee forward with dark chocolate to undergird it. When cold it also has overtones of that medicinal/herbal thing you sometimes get from bourbons. Even a hint of a red fruit/cherry note that I find in Bookers. As it warms, though, the medicinal/red fruit thing fades and the vanilla comes on strong.  T: honestly I feel like this is basically a specialty coffee drink. Some place near me does a Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk that is rich and sweet but also has a beautiful smokiness/roastiness to it. This tastes like that, with a bit more dark chocolate, caramel, and vanilla sweetness. Very very little booze or heat to speak of. Very little bourbon flavor either, which is not a knock on this beer by any means.  M: much thicker than I remember. Medium-full, carb is just a bit less than silky. A toouuuch prickly but I'm nit picking here.  O: this shit is the bomb. Every time I've had KBS I've liked it but never as much as this 2017 vintage. It's a complete beer. Each individual component - the roasted malt, the chocolate, the coffee, the barrel - does its job so well, harmonizes so well with the others; none takes precedence, all meld beautifully. No clashing of flavors, no clunkiness, no rough edges. If this is them trying to up their game in an increasingly competitive marketplace, bravo. I will definitely seek out other offerings in this series this year.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Steve_Studnuts,4.02,"Bottled 6/13/22 Reviewed 10/28/22  An unexpected finger's worth of bubbly mocha head takes shape over a dark doodoo butter body. It thins to a slick sheen with a minimum of lacing. Smells pretty nice; like a their standard breakfast stout on steroids and aged in bourbon barrels. I also detect a little toasted coconut to go along with a heaping helping of charred oak. Chocolate, vanilla and over-roasted coffee beans round things out. It's a pleasant, busy nose. Tastes an awful lot like Weyerbacher's Sunday Morning Stout, which I don't remember always being the case. It's tasty but, much like the aforementioned, the coffee seems just a little out of place. Slightly burnt, maybe. The barrel notes are pleasant, though, and make for good bedfellows with the big, roasted grain stout notes. Medium to full bodied with a certain (I assume) bourbon barrel born slickness. It was fun to revisit this after a few years, but it's not quite as good as I remembered. Or maybe I'm just a snotty cunt who's impossible to please. Either way, I'm going to sip the rest of this real slow lest I wake up with a head several sizes too big. Hides that 12% ABV pretty well, this does.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,CaptainHate,4.79,I certainly understand the buzz around this. I'm glad I picked up four more that I can age and maybe that will cut the booze taste and smell that are the only things that keep me from giving it a perfect score. I have nothing to say that hasn't already been said. Just a great beer experience.  4/7/2018 Having a 2017 after a year (time flies when you drink excellent beer) and the chocolate flavor has faded slightly but the barrel taste and alcohol burn are still present. This probably isn't a long term item to cellar but there's no urgency to consume the remaining four.  8/25/2018 Had another of the 2017. Poured into a DFH tulip I think the head was slightly smaller than when fresh. The barrel and booze smell is still prominent but is slightly more balanced in the taste along with the chocolate and malts. Still a very rewarding experience in the waning days of August. Still three left to consume and compare  11/12/2018 Another 2017 in an Abbey long stemmed tulip. I think this is very balanced now and am thinking of gradually finishing the 2017s between now and late spring 2019 to ward off any off tastes or the barrel tastes disappearing and it becoming something less pleasing than it currently is.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,jazzyjeff13,4.29,"A 355ml bottle with a BB of Feb 2016. 2015 vintage; bottled Feb 2015 with an ABV of 11.2%. I've been sitting on this bottle for a while - I hope it has aged well. I haven't seen this beer in the UK before or since, so I feel fortunate to be able to try it.  A: Poured into a Duvel tulip. Bottle conditioned. Pours a very dark brown hue that appears pitch black in the glass. Yields a small head of frothy mocha-coloured foam that swiftly subsides to a patchy surface layer.  S: Aroma of rich dark malt with notes of roasted grain, subtle coffee, brown sugar/molasses, earthy yeast, mild bourbon, faint chocolate, a twinge of vanilla and a warming whiff of booze. Fantastic.  T: Tastes of intense roasted malt with substantial bourbon undertones. Notes of roasted grain, dark malt, bourbon, wood, molasses, mild coffee, earthy yeast, a hint of vanilla, faint chocolate and an alcoholic twang on the finish. A substantial malt-driven bitterness upon swallowing. The flavours are not as well meshed as the aroma, though impressively complex nonetheless.  M: Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, with soft carbonation. Decent body but not as thick as might be expected. The alcohol dries the palate somewhat. Aftertaste of roasted malt, bourbon, yeast and bitter coffee.  O: A top-notch brew that deserves the recognition it receives. Looks the part, while the aroma and flavour are a heady mix of dark malt, bourbon, coffee and yeast. Body is OK but could be thicker and creamier for the style. Perhaps not the best bourbon barrel-aged stout I've tried - I feel the bourbon is a tad too dominant to the detriment of balance. However, a great beer and worthy of sampling if you have the chance.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Bruno74200,4.94,"2016 vintage This beer grows on you at each sip. The balance might be the main attribute of this beer.  Pitch black with a nice brown head. The smell is quite interesting. It's a perfect mix of cocoa powder, coffee and booze. Smells like a good tiramisu tastes like. Nuttiness on top. The taste is still about the nuts (mostly hazelnut), the cocoa and the coffee. The bourbon and oak brings a good balance to this complex smell. Some apple and peppercorn notes, some booziness. But this beer is so drinkable, it's insane. This beer is thick but not much and astringent. Velvety mouthfeel. The carbonation is quite low.  One of the best beer I've ever had. The best use of bourbon barrel I've had in a beer to date.  On some other tasting, the booze is not present at all. You can find some cookie dough notes I've had it many times now and each time I try it, each time I like it more. This is a wonderful beer.  I can only upgrade my rating each time I try it. This beer is wonderful in every aspect. It's gorgeous to look at, it smells great, it tastes divine, it's so smooth I'm going crazy for it! Hell I'll consider it my new favourite! I can't wait for the time I'll try CBS! (As I write this, it will be soon enough) I just have to not drink my entire reserve of KBS. I've got to make it last. One thing is for sure, I'll find a way to get a load of this beer each and every year!    2018 vintage  L - 5 pitch black, wonderful mocha head. Quite gracious. Especially for an ale which has spent so much time in barrels  S - 4.75 oak straight forward. Vanilla, cocoa, coffee, bourbon. A bit of booze  T - 4.75 tastes very fresh compare to the 2016 vintage samples I've had. Fresh oak upfront. Astringent coffee. Big bourbon presence. Very balanced. Cocoa nib, almond and roasted hazelnut  M - 4.5 moderate carbonation, a bit of astringency. Smooth.  O - 4.75 a very nice barrel aged imperial stout but I prefer the 2016 vintage aged. This one is real barrel forward which is not bad but is less rounded.

1199,19960,CochonKing,4.92,"2017 Founders KBS - Served in the 2017 Founders KBS glass.  Look - The beer pours a nice black with brown edging. Foam is sturdy with a large amount of longevity and it forms thick legs that run down the glass.  Smell - Coffee, chocolate and raisins are in the initial attack for me when I first opened it up. Vanilla comes off the nose next as well as some of the more subtle whiskey notes throwing in a little tar and tire at the end. The bouquet is beautiful and has a lot of depth as it starts to warm up slightly.  Taste - Chocolate leads in the taste based off of my perception with some of the roasted coffee notes to follow. The alcohol then picks up its intensity. Vanillas, chocolate, molasses, burnt wood, caramel and burnt sugar. The flavors are amazing.  Feel - The mouthfeel is incredible as well. Full bodied and similar to heavy cream in texture the bubbles are small and yield to the intensity of the beer beautifully. Creamy and rich this beer is a beast.  Overall I'd say I'm really happy I bought this beer. Took a lot of searching in NY but when I found that Half Time in Poughkeepsie was selling it after I've been waiting three years to try it (always sold out before I got out of work).  My only complaint is that its gouged. Much like Pappy Van Winkle this 4 pack cost me 36.

Thick walls of lacing sheet down the glass to join with the thick ring of foamy suds which stays all the way to the end.

Taste follows the nose so precisely that I don't need to repeat myself except for the part about napping in it because, now that I've tasted it, I can't stop drinking it. Finally picking up some bitter cold-pressed coffee at the finish.  Mouthfeel is smooth, rich and creamy, medium-thick bodied, a little better carbonated than it needs to be, and finishes with a slight dry, bitter pucker. Just a little boozy warmth in the gullet.

L: Pours a very dark brown with a creamy tan head. S: The tapped version seemed heavy on the chocolate and coffee smell. I honestly didn't catch a whiff of bourbon at all. The bottled versions similar, but both had bourbon aromas, the '16 version was more pronounced. T: The tapped beers had coffee and chocolate flavors, again no noticeable bourbon except for the warming effect. I actually thought I was drinking an Imperial Breakfast Stout an nitro. The 16/17 bottles had similar tastes, I think the 16 bottle had more bourbon in the taste. All had the ""heat"". F:. All had medium thick feel to them, not in the Ten-Fidy of FIS class. O: The tapped version went down easy, the ABV not noticeable until I stood up. The two bottles were more sippers. Definitely, one the really good ones. Founders is probably #1 on my list, especially when it comes to stouts. So what happened to Double Trouble and Devil Dancer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,GratefulBeerGuy,4.78,"2017 release. Grabbed the very last one from my local beer store. * Updates from 4/2/18. ""KBS release day"". Bottled on 37/18 opened on 4/2/18. 12.3 % abv. Jet black color, very active and fizzy vibe with a dark tan colored foam topping. Fizzes and slowly recedes. There is always a fine swirly covering, thicker mocha colored ring all the way around the outer-edge of the glass that never goes away. Very active for a huge beer layed down for a full year !  A huge malty nose: caramel, roasty chocolate, vanilla and cream, freshly ground french roast coffee bean and dry, earthy hop notes under that. Plenty of high heat tingle and dense, dark fruits. A very intense aroma. The nose really opens up, as the liquid gets warmer, sweeter chocolate, bigger sweet dark fruits and more caramel pop out....even more. The nose is really dominated by the bourbon and alcohol effect. Coffee grounds become much more intense later on as well.  I must comment on the mouthfeel first, the first sip proves to be one of the, if not, THE most LUSH, full and smooth effects I've ever expereinced in a beer. Velvety smooth, full, long and very easy to gulp for such a beast. The heat is pretty high but the addition of chocolate and coffee really make for a ""full""effect without the alcohol presence taking over. Thick, viscositous and oily but still exceptionally smooth. * chalky and very dry texture for 2018. Not nearly as smooth and velvety as 2017. Still, very full with a thick, chalky texture. Dry finish.  The alcohol heat and bourbon barrel taste hits you first in the flavor. The Oak bourbon barrel effect is huge, adding massive complexity to the already full- bore flavor's of: roasty chocolate, mild, dark roasted coffee, vanilla...?more like heavy cream really; dark roasted grains and dry earthy tones. The hops provide an excellent dry, herbal and earthy counter ballance to all of the massive malty and adjunct style complexities found within the flavor spectrum of this rather incredible brew. * dry and sour herbal tones of fruit and spice with long, earthy-bitter hop finish that seems very different from the 2017 version.  The lable does not give the actual abv. % (after closer inspection, the lable does include the abv... But it was faded) 11.8 % for 2017......but I would guess somewhere near 12%. Usually ""barrel aged beers"" have a slight oak... And whatever spirit the barrel holds flavoring that is very subtle. This Bourbon Barrel aging actually brings it on home ! Aged for a full year, does the trick! Kudo's for creating a Very aged Massive stout!  The aftertaste has dates and sweet but also sour notes of alcohol infused chocolate. Grassy and very herbal hop flavor's tend to take over slightly near the end of the glass, when the liquid is at it's warmest.  Certainly an Epic stout. I love how the Bourbon oak cask really effects the already excellent malty spectrum offlavor's. Favorite aspect: The feel. Best ever. If a 6 was possible.....lol.  Overall, a true Beast. Epic stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Impfan,4.88,"With its midnight black pour, and heavy body, it was obvious that this was going to be a stout to reckon with. The nose was coffee, foremost, with chocolate next, followed by mild bourbon. The flavor was more intense with an overall impression of letting a raspberry truffle melt in my mouth. The finish was very long, and completely balanced. This beauty was definitely worth the (years long) wait to enjoy.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Meow49,5,"This was the most decadent, yet balanced imperial stout I've had the pleasure of savoring. Coffee was in the forefront with chocolate and cacao coming through next, followed by dark fruit. The finish was a smooth and mellow marriage of all three, and the finish was quite lengthy. The body was voluptuous; firm, but yet, silky and not syrupy. Yummy stuff!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Kdouble,4.74,"A 12 oz bottle listed as 2017 release poured into a tulip.  Appearance- A deep thick black with around a 3 finger brownish thick head. The head faded rather quickly, but there was nice lacing down the glass. A classic stout look  Smell- Dark chocolate with roasted coffee are dominant. I was expecting more of the bourbon barrel aroma to come through, but next none there. I did notice some other dried fruits as I let this breathe a little. Really enjoyable mix of flavors with a pleasant change around the middle of the glass.  Taste- The coffee hit me a little strong for the first sip then the dark chocolate and caramel kick in. The dried fruit seemed like a mix of dates and figs with more sweetness. The bourbon barrel smokiness is more like a mellow aftertaste with the sweetness mixed in. The most difficult mix of flavors I have tried to explain- just know that I really liked it.  Mouthfeel- Lite to medium carbonation with warming feel. A slight bite from either the high ABV or the bourbon mix.  Overall- A fantastic stout made to be sipped and enjoyed. This stout leaves no doubt about the 11.80% ABV without a bitter alcohol taste. The complex mix of dried fruit and sweetness definitely shine through. Stock up on it while you can get it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Lahey,4.75,"This is my first beer in 3 months as I've cut down on sugar intake, so this review is skewed. (I couldn't turn down this one though) The appearance, smell and lacing are all what you would expect for a top notch stout. The taste is excellent. The chocolate, coffee and bourbon all show up in a glorious mingling of flavors. It may be too boozy for people not used to high octane beers, but as a guy who drinks straight bourbon it tastes pretty smooth. If you like stouts and especially bourbon aged stouts, give it a try (if you can afford/find it) Edit: I tried it on tap. It's a little thinner. More chuggable, but I think I like it bottled more. Plus 8.50 for a 12 oz pour is a bit much...  Edit #2 My fiancé doesn't drink stouts, but she drinks this.  Edit #3 lol june 2017 i got to buy a 4 pack of vintage 2016 bottles. It actually has more bourbon taste than this years, which is heavier on coffee. Probably the difference in weather moving the beer in and out of the wood. Still very good.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,CanadianBacon,4.56,"Appearance - Poured from a 355ml (12 oz) into a teku 11.9% labeled best before :12/20/2017. The beer pours a jet black color and light does not get through the glass just like I would expect. The head pours just under 3 fingers and tanish brown but rather bubbly and fades quick. If it wasnt for the rapidly fading head this would be a no brainer 5/5, oh well though. Nothing is perfect.  Aroma - Deeply roasted coffee and rich dark chocolate are the 2 primary aromas to hit the nose. One of the things I'm used to in these barrell aged beers is a strong oak and bourbon aroma. While they both exist in this beer they sit idly at the back of the nose letting you know. I am a breakfast beer and coffee is what you are getting with me. I will age one of these a little to see how it changes. Inbetween the strong and weak aroma you get a plethora of others including coconut, caramel, a little bit of fig and dates. They all come together to create one heck of an aroma.  Taste - Rich roasted coffee beans are again the first to stand to your attention, than they are followed by a beautiful dark chocolate, caramel and toffee, The oak and bourbon hit the back of my palate with a splash and send me to another world. and some very subdued dates and figs add a sharp sweetness on the back end. The coconut is subbtly there with the oak and bourbon on the back of my throat. These flavors are magically put together.  Feel - Madium mouth feel with a beautiful medium velvety carbonation. There is a very light spice on the end which may be a bit of the boozyness coming through at 11.9$ while retaining its medium body this beer can almost be chewy. It goes down smooth without so much as a burn at 12%.  Overall - While it definitely lacked a little on head quality, the rest of this beer was outstandingly put together from the way each aroma mingle with each other to invite your nose in, The taste profile is equally as irresistable and it has a mouthfeel to die for, With all this being said I am a night shift worker This would be one that I would love to come home and sip on everyday. However I know it has to be a limited release given the aging and in the end the price would make it so I couldn't daily this beer. I can get stouts near this level for half the cost. I think its time founders send breakfast stout to Canada and this will be a once a year treat.  P.S, I'm also gonna age a couple of these a year and see if the bourbon and oak become more predominant. Cheers!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,ludachris,4.37,"It pours cola brown out of the bottle but is black in the glass. A frothy coffee brown head quickly moves to the edges. Sheets of alcohol coat the sides of the glass after a few swirls.  Deeply rich and roasted coffee grinds and loafy dark, spicy bread start things off in a big way. Sweet booze and dark chocolate combine to give off a soft impression of cake icing. This gradually unravels as it warms. Sticky raisins and dates are close to its core. A bit of vanilla and oak are underneath. The bourbon comes through very slowly and melds into the rest of the flavors as opposed to standing out on its own.  Softy and chewy oak and vanilla coat the palate. From there, everything happens. Rich and rounded coffee grinds and dark chocolate are dominant. Raisins and dates continue its sweetness into the finish which closes a bit dry, roasty and with a boozy bourbon note. Vanilla beans and fluffy oak have the last word.  The combination of wheat, oats, and an extensive aging process in bourbon barrels gives off a remarkably velvety, silky, chewy texture. It's full, satisfying, and decadent.  This is a wonderfully balanced and rounded RIS. Its high ABV is hidden behind its silky, fluffy decadence and feel. The barrel aging comes through in its texture and its balance more so than in its aroma and flavor. I really was expecting more bourbon character but I'm more than happy with what I've got in front of me.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,TFB5,4.77,"2017 KBS is another winner. It seems to be a bit more coffee forward than chocolate. As a result it seems to be more bitter, but I really like it this way.

Completely pitch black in color with one finger of loose tan head that stays for a while before collapsing to some long-lasting bubble sheet on the surface and leaving behind some spotty and patchy lace on the glass-side, it is quite sticky at time.  Coffee, chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, oaky bourbon, roasted profile, licorice, burnt wood, charred nuttiness, some smoke, dark bread, and some earthy hop, all of these scents are delicately presented in a nose. The aroma is more open when the beer starts to warm with a strong presence of creamy chocolate, black coffee, and spicy bourbon.  The taste is malty sweet at first upon initial contact through the tasted buds, however, it won’t last for long as the bourbon character bursting with its vanilla, oaky, and spicy note. Then it is roasted and chocolate malt profile with notes of coffee, chocolate, cocoa, burnt wood, charred nuttiness, some smoke, and dark bread. Some earthy hop too then it is bourbon barrel again that reclaims its place with its spicy heat of alcohol along the end through the aftertaste.  Full body and sticky mouthfeel but it is rich and soft with moderate carbonation to generate a wave of silky effervescence through the palate. It is well proper to cater all the things inside the smooth palate in very good shape. Finish is dry.  Complex and robust but tasty as hell with a lot of thing going on and changing all along in all aspects, the only thing I can recommend is that take your time and sip slowly to let it developed from time to time.

I can see a hair of copper and a hair of amber, side by side when held up to sunlight, like a two toned rainbow.  Smells of coffee, dark chocolate, alcohol, liquorice, and hints of vanilla sweetness. Its got that kind of rusty, earthy, coconut fiber quality I get in a lot of imperial stouts. Umami, soy sauce, salami qualities as well. Cinnamon at moments. The bourbon comes in as it warms.  There it is! So many layers, so much going on in this brew. The coconut fiber, black liquorice tar like, earthy qualities come in first, then it opens like a flower in the middle with vanilla, dark chocolate, sweet carmel notes. It continues then with the umami, soy sauce qualities that come in from another angle, and it finally finishes with coffee and sugar. Like a full course meal! Alcohol is mostly hidden but shows up on feel for sure. The cinnamon comes in as well. I only get the bourbon after it warms, but its there.  Thick and oily but smooth with moderate carbonation. Alcohol shows up mid palate, then burns in the throat and back of the nostrils.  Amazing brew. At first I was like smelling it and going 'There must be more!' but it opens up with each sip. More scents, more flavours, really delicious, well rounded brew. My first time to have this is December 1st, 2016 in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Amazed to have found it online in Thailand!

This is well balanced by the sugars present and the vanilla that comes from the aging. There is wood in this beer too. This beer is just really well crafted and all the flavors are well integrated. It is not an overwhelming push of bourbon. S: Light bourbon smell -- not over powering and nearly perfectly balanced with chocolate vanilla and oak. The smell sets the table for expectation of a well balanced beer w/o over powering bourbon flavor. Slightly sweet smell with the residual sugar. F: Smooth without bite. Well balanced between thick and thin. Not cloying. Pretty fricking amazing. Is that a rating? O: A huge fan of Founders and a lover of stouts overall so this review is probably doubly biased. Despite the more recent push against barrel aging, it does offer an extra depth and done well it is worth the extra coin. (Done poorly and it is a mess) An amazing beer at a reasonable price point.

1199,19960,hoptheology,4.32,"Thanks @newbeeraday for this elusive beer.  Inky black pour, quite the same as their Imperial Double Stout around Christmas time. The head is minimal, to be expected for a 12% beer. A beige ring manages to form, and of course the body is just a blackout.  Aromas are hot, sticky, and mouth-watering. Lots of boozy bourbon, some milk chocolate, Hershey's syrup, torched/fried bananas, and sweet molasses.  The flavors just soak into the palate as you let it rest there. Chocolate, chocolate syrup, oatmeal, top-shelf bourbon, honey, sticky figs, and honey. The tip of the tongue samples coffee, but washing it to the back mutes that and reveals all of the above. The hotness of the bourbon wraps over the profile and gets stronger as the beer warms.  The feel is total exhuberance. Just thick. Viscous. Not palate-wrecking, not like the Speedway Stout; but rather it coats the palate completely and soaks in like a fine red wine.  Overall, world-class is right. This beer is absolutely fantastic. I'm a frugal guy, but $22 for a 4 pack is an outright steal for this kind of beer. I'll stand in line next year to buy my limit. Absolutely mind blown.   Further analysis : Compared to a standard FBS, aged at 1 year (which in my opinion is optimal as the coffee fades and the chocolate and oats pop up), the FBS drinks more like a porter and is prominently coffee forward, with little dashes of oats here and there. The KBS destroys it. Both good beers, but KBS is an obvious notch or three above.   * Note : This was reviewed as a 2015 aged 2 years. I had the 2017 version pretty fresh and it's very booze forward. Still delicious, but not nearly as good as it is aged.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

This one is a tasty, boozy beer that is very smooth and strikes a good balance between all the characteristics at work. The aromas are a smooth stream of chocolatey tones with a roasty, oily coffee backbone and some sweet roast notes. The flavor follows suit. The bourbon is at a nice level for my tastes. It is definitely there and can even be felt going down, but I don't feel like I am drinking whiskey like I do with some BA stouts. Based on it's heat, maybe this is cause the base beer is so crammed full of flavor that it overpowers the sharpness or maybe it's cause it's a year old?

Makes your taste buds squeal with delight."" Brewed in.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a snifter glass.  (Appearance) Pours a creamy foam head of a pale tan complexion over a near black body. Retention is good and lacing is light and spotty. 4  (Smell) Moderate roasted grains, bitter cocoa nibs, moderate roasted coffee bean character, vanilla and bourbon notes. 3.75  (Taste) Subdued chocolate and coffee notes with a moderate earthy bitterness, finishes with a pinch of bourbon alcohol. 4  (Mouthfeel) Smooth, silky, lightly chewy, finishes mildly dry. Carbonation is moderate, generating a moderate and a moderately crisp finish. Body is moderate for the style, short of heavy overall. Balance is evenly sweet to bitter to boozy. Alcohol presence is mild for the style, mild overall. 4.25  (Overall) Fairly lighter bodied than expected, but very well balanced with loads of flavor in the coffee, chocolate and bourbon character environments. Highly recommended. 4.25  Founders Brewing Company's KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout) 4.02/5.00  Vertical Notes:  2015 (1 Year, 4 months Aged): Pour is identical to the fresh vintage, wispy tan head, identical hued body. More revealed bourbon nose, less chocolate and coffee. A little more grainy, exposed booziness, still very solid.  2014 (2 Years, 4 months Aged): Oxidation creeping in, entirely faded coffee and chocolate flavors, trace graininess. Little chocolate, no coffee, dark fruit esters gaining. Less enjoyable at this stage.  2013 (3 Years, 4 months Aged): Really incredibly boozy up front, slightly more coffee and chocolate preserved, inky, rich and viscous. Still nicely balanced, a bit richer with a lot of preserved syrupy chocolate and roasted barley flavors, with a rich bourbon bite on the back end. Very enjoyable.  2011 (5 Years, 4 months Aged): Pours very silky smooth, jet black appearance. Not as much bourbon aroma, roasted character, chocolate, very pale aroma overall, some slight oxidation and fruit characters incoming. Flavorwise, there is a remaining trace of dark chocolate, some viscosity, dark fruit and oxidation. A bit down from 2013, but still decent.  2010 (6 Years, 4 months Aged): Earthy roast characteristics, dark chocolate aromas, dark fruit notes, light graininess. Rich earthiness and chocolate notes, faded coffee and balanced bourbon. Probably my second favorite vintage (after '13)  2008 (8 Years aged): Super earthy, rich and roasty. Flavor is roasty, softly grainy, chocolatey. Very enjoyable overall, quite incredible. One of the best vintages.  Overall impressions: I found that although aging these beers resulted in varying degrees of enjoyment, I found the older vintages to be overall excellent, very well primed for aging and held up outstandingly well. I can only ponder if Founders changed the recipe in the past few years, as the 2015 and 2014 were not enjoyable overall.  Recommended Vintage: Drink 3 bottles, leave one bottle.

As I drank/sipped it I couldn't help thinking ""they couldn't have put a shot of whiskey in a Breakfast Stout, could they?"". Just seems like way to much bourbon flavor to have come from barrel aging...unless someone didn't empty some barrels very well. I would bet my life that this has bourbon added to the beer. Very strong alcohol flavor but delicious. It took me a while to finish it but it was a definite experience for a Texas boy who was wondering if I would ever get the chance!

Later on I get certain notes of plum, very very ripe plum, but only with my mouth open.  T -- Follows the smell very closely, with the addition of a strong bitter chocolate flavor. I think I started drinking a little early as I took it outside in the afternoon sun and as it warmed the bourbon become more pronounced, in a good way, as it slipped into the sweetness and the two created a very nice balance. There's a definite note of hop bitterness to account for all the malts, but they sit nicely in the flavor profile. The more and more I drank this, the higher I rated it -- the balance becomes more pronounced with time.  F -- Not the thickest beer ever, and I think I was expecting a bit more based on the pour, but very nicely viscous. Same as in the taste, warmth brought on a better experience as the beer got to that viscosity that I expected when watching it pour.  O -- A great bourbon barrel aged stout. It is one of the best I've had, ranking just a bit below CBS and BCBS, as it seems to be missing just that bit of thickness and, in my mind, a little sweetness to counter the bourbon bite and the bitterness of the hops.

Black as all get out with a smooth khaki head that thinned pretty quick as expected. Oddly enough, this JUST smells like a normal stout. Not getting much bourbon smell. Sweet decadent oats and rich creamy chocolate. A bit of licorice. Taste is per the smell but, there the bourbon hides. It's like it was in the barrel, soaked in the grains of wood waiting to be released. Not much coffee in the taste, or if it is there it's just the best dang smooth coffee I've ever had. Man this is good! Really regretting passing on the chance to buy a 14,16 to try as a vertical a week ago! DOH! Mouthfeel is silky smooth like doing a good bourbon shot and chasing it with worlds best chocolate. Seriously good. Overall, it's meh.   Just kidding.

1199,19960,rodbeermunch,4.69,"Last time I had one of these was on Derby Day. The convenient 12oz bottle makes it available to break out at a variety of settings. You don't need help. Pours thick and black. Hits the tan head, even amasses a 1/2"" break point. Retention isn't all that high, there's a lot of booze slickness. Aroma is bunches and bunches of chocolate, vanilla and bourbon.  Chocolate really pushes itself in this one, especially with time on it. Isn't boozy, is enjoyable. Pro tip: Save a few ounces at the bottom of the bottle and put it in your morning coffee. Start the day a fun way. Its not all chocolate, bourbon and vanilla though. There is a mild oak contribution.  She's a keeper and elite tier barrel aged stout. No infection issues ever that I recall.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Mongrel,4.29,"Smell is just WOW - marshmallows, licorice, rich chocolate, big coconut, a little smoke... Some espresso bringing up the rear. Not a huge aroma, but certainly a rich, enticing one.  Flavor is a bit more conventional for BBA stout. Light chocolate, cherry and oak. Certainly a nice cloak of bourbon, although not overpowering. Everything melds well, but feels a little thin. Doesn't drink like a 12% beer, for better or for worse.  Chocolate flavor gets a bit richer and ""gooier"" as the beer warms. Some apple spice also emerges. Solid, solid flavor profile. There's a level of balance and nuance that is more in line with an abbey quad, rather than the in-your-face character of barrel aged stouts that we've recently grown accustomed to.  Update with 2017 vintage: Rich, robust and smooth. A little boozier than I remember, but it does not detract. Creamy coffee flavors and mellow, quality bourbon. Like a boozy coffee brownie. Herbal, peppery finish.  I prefer the sexy, subtle sophistication of 2016.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Mikeybricks,4.72,"Picked up 2016 KBS 3-13-16, and its been sitting in my 45F fridge till now. Drinking it out of a tulip Snifter glass. Liquid thermometer reads 57F, for those who want specifics. This is my first year sampling KBS and I have had it 3 or 4 other times before this review when it was fresher, but wasn't sitting down where I could give a review, so it is possible my overall opinion could have changed from when I tried it fresh, but this is currently its profile to me.  Look- Looks is what I would expect and like in a stout, although I would like a little more head retention, could be my glass though or the couple months its had in the fridge. Dark black though almost like dark chocolate or black coffee color. When swirled around glass, leaves fine head around glass and dissipates after a few seconds leaving alcohol fingers. Head also lingers for several seconds.  Smell- Smell is pretty faint of coffee and bourbon, no oak which I found predominant in the Project Pam and from my memory of my first try of KBS this year. After a swirl or two aroma of coffee and bourbon pick up but fade quickly. At this point in the review beer is at around 61F. No real pick up in aroma with temperature change either. I like and prefer aromatic stouts that smell of fresh coffee and barrel aging, and again this could be the couple months in the fridge.  Taste- The taste is still impeccable from what I remember from memory of my first go around. Upfront in you face coffee flavor. Not really noticing much of the chocolate that I did when it was fresh. Although there was not much oak aroma, I definitely pick it up on the back end of the beer. For me the ""Boozy"" quality is not present, both at the lower starting temperature and 61F temperature. There is an small alcohol taste but that is quickly overtaken by the coffee bitterness and oak flavor. I love the way the flavor of this stout came out. In my opinion only thing that would make it over the top taste would be the presence of vanilla bean or maple syrup as with CBS (one I have not tried yet.)  Feel- Mouth feel is what I seek in a stout, almost porter-ish kinda feel. Slick mouth feel that starts with a very fine bubble carbonation feel that coats the mouth. Does not leave a dry feeling, I believe this is because of the chocolate. However, you are left with a slight warming feeling from the alcohol content of this beer that coats your mouth and throat down to your stomach, a pretty neat experience if you know what im talking about.  Overall- Overall I love this Beer! Not because of the hype, but because of my actual opinion of it. Im not sure if this style of stout would go over well with a hardcore stout lover, depends on there pallet, lots of flavor and complexity. I think even for a hesitant stout goer that has tried a few and has some likes and not likes this might be a go to. For me, I wish KBS was available all year round, it would easily be my go to stout. If it was the hype that brought this beer to light then im glade it got me around to trying it. Even with a couple months I still dig this beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,Beric,4.28,"Serving: From the bottle into a snifter Served: 17 May 2016  Appearance: Pours a deep brownish black color with a very minimal tan head. Looks like your average imperial stout.  Smell: Definitely picking up a lot of the vanilla bourbon influence in the nose. Quite boozy, which was unwelcome.  Taste: Surprisingly well done given the super boozy nose- it still finishes a bit hot, but I found the boozy notes to be toned down appropriately on the palate. This beer has your standard stout notes--chocolate, coffee, and espresso--but also a distinctive burnt note which I really enjoyed. Vanilla sweetness from the barrel aging, though one that complemented the overall flavor profile, especially that subtle smokiness.  Mouthfeel: Big body with medium-low carbonation. Finishes off-dry.  Overall: This is a good beer, but one that I firmly believe is hyped up *way* too much. I like this much better than BCBS as far as a straight barrel-aged stout goes, but I believe that there are much better imperial stouts out there than this. Maybe I'm just not gaga for barrel aged stuff. Nonetheless, this remains a great beer, but I can't see myself drinking more than one of these a year.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,LarryV,3.9,"Definitely a good stout, but (IMHO) way over-hyped and overpriced. Poured with virtually no head at all, very light carbonation if any. It's pretty well balanced, the bourbon notes don't overwhelm and the coffee is pretty subtle. An enjoyable beer but at $25 a 4 pack around here, I'll pass.

Poured an opaque chocolate brown color with a 1F head- I couldn't seem to get a bigger head.  The aroma is prominent coffee. A bit of vanilla, chocolate. No Bourbon or oak as in other IS.  The taste follows the aroma. Very strong coffee, the strongest I have tasted in an imperial stout. However, the vanilla and chocolate seem to be missing. No oak or Bourbon.  Excellent bitter coffee finish.  Overall: a lot of hype, although an excellent beer. This IS is not in another class. The top of the class is still BCBS and its varietals. This stout is excellent. However, it's only standout quality is the coffee prominence. An excellent beer, one of the best of the IS, but not outclassing any other stouts to rise to another level.

Initial odor is bourbon, a bit boozy, follow by distinctly chocolate with coffee underneath. Some roastiness as well. Thick mouth feel, but still no carbonation on the tongue. Mild, coffee, bourbon, chocolate initial taste with a nicely bitter and bourbon finish. As you drink, it leaves a thick, clingy, stringy lacing down the glass. A bit boozy, but just wonderful overall.  2018: Strong coffee in the aroma - little / no bourbon. Thick feel. Just enough barrel / bourbon in the taste to know it is there, but as with the aroma, strong coffee, roasted malts. Smooth in taste and feel, with a nicely bitter finish and aftertaste. Just enough alcohol warmth to know this is an Imperial stout. Compared with my notes from, this one has less bourbon and more coffee. Still very nice, but different for sure.  2019: Tall tan head, thick and creamy from a fairly vigorous pour into a tulip. Opaque black color, even with a back-light. Head recedes moderately fast, leaving dense lacing. Somewhat thick creamy cap remains after a few minutes. A few minutes more results in a thin cap with creamy islands. Aroma is roasted coffee and chocolate, just barely picking up the bourbon aroma. Medium-thick feel, creamy. Taste is vanilla, chocolate, coffee, with bourbon just underneath. The barrel and whiskey is there, but definitely in a complimentary role. A subtle touch. An excellent intermix of flavors. Chocolate, no that's coffee, no that's vanilla, and then back to chocolate.

(Sight - 4.50)  Smelled dark milk chocolate and black coffee malts. After second effort got smooth bourbon, oaky wood, booziness, toffee, caramel, crayon, hints of vanilla and roasted hazelnut. Reminding me a bit of Tioga-Sequoia’s Autumn Rush. (Smell - 4.25)  Taste followed the nose nicely. Still reminding me of TSAR. Got dark milk chocolate, boozy bourbon, oaky wood, creamy vanilla, hazelnut, chocolate milkshake, roasted coffee malts, toffee, caramel, Oreo cookies, wet cocoa and hints of spice (cinnamon?). (Taste - 4.25)  Full body. Creamy-to-sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth, warming finish. (Feel - 4.75)  This was just an awesome beer. I still think I slightly overrated it a tad with the pedigree, but so be it. It is not elite to me, but just a great beer.

1199,19960,dream,4.5,"2015/2016 batch Look: This beer pours pitch black with a slight brown retention. A very nice looking stout.  Smell: Smells strongly of bourbon and coffee.  Taste: Very strong (but smooth) bourbon beginning note, transitioning into a mid way coffee note, then back into a relatively smooth bourbon finish.  Feel: Not bad, but not as thick as other barrel aged stouts I've had. It could use some maturation in this area.  Final Verdict: After enjoying many high end barrel aged stouts such as BCBS, Parabola, Black Tuesday, and Pugachev's Cobra, I would have to say that KBS ranks below these in terms of an all around world class barrel aged stout. With that being said, coffee lovers might find this brew to be awesome and on a perfect 5 level, though the non infected BCBS Coffee is superior to this.  2017 update  The 2017's batch is definitely way better than 2016 or 2015 imo.. a dramatic improvement I'd say. In accordance I have updated my rating to reflect the""Current state of this beer"". In particular, the mouthfeel seems a lot creamier, fuller and chewier, and the taste is far more well rounded and decadent, in line with bourbon county. I'm also getting this wonderful nutty note on the far end of the aftertaste.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,strengthdoc,5,"I was very fortunate to pick up two 4-packs of KBS at a small store in VT. I've never tasted it before so I had to try one and I'll cellar the rest a while. I often feel that many hard to find beers are over hyped, but not this one. It poured out of the bottle to reveal a thick 1.5 finger brown head with lots of lacing. The aroma was rich and complex with chocolate, coffee, bourbon, oak, and raisin all coming through. The mouthfeel was thick and silky. The first taste is predominantly bittersweet chocolate with a medium bourbon. The beer finishes with a light oak and coffee taste followed by an alcohol warmth. I am usually an IPA person, but this is one of the best beers I have ever tried.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,bbtkd,4.27,"Founders KBS!!! I didn't expect to get my hands on this in South Dakota but nabbed 6 bottles. Other BBS's I have had and can compare to are BCBS, Dragon's Milk, and Central Waters. Fairly thick, decent brown head that stuck around, and opaque. Those expecting a bourbon-forward BBS will be under-impressed, as this is more coffee forward, with a lingering chocolate taste. I really like having a beer that has the coffee taste without the strong coffee bitterness many stouts have. Though this tastes quite different from the others, I like it as well as BCBS and Central Waters, and prefer it over Dragon's Milk. ABV aside, I could sit and drink a lot of these. As with most all stouts, this gets better as it warms. Based on other reviews I had half-expected it to be an OMFG experience, and though it's not that, it will go on my favorite whale list.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,OldManMetal,4.47,"(2016 release) This seasonal imperial stout from Founders is a great-looking beer: a giant pebbly brown head lasts nicely atop an impenetrable black body, devoid of highlights save for a slight orange glimmer at its base; lacing is quite good, consisting of bands and caverns. The nose is medium-big in intensity; it leads with bourbon and oak, backed by subdued milk chocolate, brown sugar and modest alcohol undertones. The palate is a seamless blend of bourbon, milk chocolate and molasses riding atop a quite assertive undercurrent of alcohol; it lands just a bit on the sweet end of the balance. The finish is a good hit of booze and chocolate, followed by the onset of a slight chocolate flavor that lingers, with a modest oaky bitterness, for a few minutes. Mouthfeel is on point for the full body, and quite warming; the texture is viscous, sticky/creamy, and slightly peppery from the well-expressed carbonation. The bourbon character is nicely done- it is central to the flavor and aroma, but not domineering in either case. While the oak is very prominent on the nose, on the palate it plays coy, declining to act the diva as can sometimes be the case with barrel-aged stouts.

I mentioned I had two because it was that good. Pours a thick and viscous jet black color with a coffee and dark tan head. This dissipates and leaves a lacing that is modest but persistent. The aroma is intoxicating. So much going on; coffee, chocolate, oak, bourbon, vanilla and dark fruit. This matches the taste. It is truly a slice of heaven to feel this in your mouth.

I've been drinking a different BA stout now almost every other day, so I am happy to have this now that I can compare it to other beers that I've had very recently. The biggest thing it has going for it is the mouth feel. It has a great thickness and creaminess that I really enjoyed. It is very drinkable and hides the 12% abv as well as any other beer.

1199,19960,nyoung,5,"2016 KBS, no age on it.  Before I begin my review, let me preface this by saying I have, as of now, found my favorite beer with KBS. This is the first time I've tried it and I was left in shock. It has everything I personally look for in a beer and it's beyond well balanced.  Look: Looks dark brown with a minimal head on the pour. Appeared to have a thicker viscosity on the pour.  Smell: It smells fantastic! Chocolate, coffee, sweet heavenly awesomeness. I would say if you've never had this, smell breakfast stout and add a hint of bourbon.  Taste: Perfect in every way! Subtle bourbon with coffee and chocolate, all working together to perfection. As it warmed up, it began to bring the bourbon hint a little more to the front, but nothing overpowering. I prefer my beverages cold, but with sipping drinks you can't help but let them climb to room temperature.  Feel: Full mouth feel, not too thick or thin (like water). I would say it's right where I needs to be.  Overall: I just found a place that had 4-packs for $12 a piece, needless to say I stocked up for the year. I've read it doesn't age too well so I recommend drinking it within the year. But I'm going to experiment now that I have that ability.

1199,19960,mac31,4.5,"2016 KBS, 4/22/16 Bourbon, rich chocolate, and graham cracker sweetness are what first strike my palate. Soft vanilla low lights are there, cropping up from time to time. Just as the sweetness is on it's descent, the bitterness from the hops kicks in. This is quite the hoppy ale, big clean bitterness. The hops are earthy, herbal, slightly floral with a touch of spiciness. The rich chocolate flavor advances to bittersweet chocolate and coffee in the finish. The bourbon present from start to finish, it lays low mid palate. The bourbon is a component of the beer, not the dominating flavor, which I really appreciate. Cereal grains linger on after the finish. The alcohol is well covered. Highly drinkable for a 12.4% beer. The body is slight for a stout. Nicely balanced. This is a flavor bomb, for sure. A great beer. For my palate, it's a little sweet at times. But that's a little nit picky. 4.5/4.25/4.5/4/4.5  4/13/2017 KBS 2017  Big coffee, espresso up front. There is an intense, but nuanced sweetness that underpins the coffee notes. Nice! I get some black licorice types spices, perhaps from the roasted barley or the sharpness of the coffee. This beer gains a nice, savory depth at the mid palate mark. Vanilla softens everything up beginning 3/4 palate and in to the finish. A beautiful body 2017 has. Soft. Creamy. Silky. Carbonation is soft and sudsy. Alcohol is masked well. Can be found, but only when thoroughly searched out. Grains and ever-so-slight herbal and menthol notes in the finish. The beer started at 46F. As the beer neared room temp the vanilla became more prominent as did the sweet booziness from the bourbon barrel. A wonderfully comprised beer. So easy and effortless to drink. One down, thankfully seven more to go. I prefer this to 2016. The body is much improved. Beer is more in balance.

First beer I truly loved was regular Breakfast Stout, so had high expectations for this one...  ...and it delivered!  Pitch black with beautiful tan head  Smell was at first a little underwhelming - only hints of the barrels and coffee. As others have mentioned, the smell was fairly muted - just smelled like a great stout.  Taste was where this beer took it away. Sweet, roast, nutty, caramel, bourbon... if I had to describe this beer in one word it would be ""harmony"".

But the taste makes up for it - decadent chocolate and coffee give way to a bourbon bite, followed by a sweet coffee aftertaste. Really amazing how the flavors blend together. I fou nd it to be a bit thin and it didn't stick in my mouth as much as BCBS. Because of this, it desn't feel as luxurious or powerful as Bourbon County, but it was just as smooth and I believe had more adjunct flavor.

I could really taste the bourbon and coffee undertones in this one when fresh from my beer fridge; however, the chocolate presented itself with more character as it warmed in my glass.

It does come off as a little hot to me. But a real nice amount of bitter, dark chocolate.  The biggest difference for KBS this year is the mouth feel.

Chocolate, fudge, roasted malt, vanilla, coffee and some solid heat on the backend. The heat subsided noticeably and gave way to the incredible flavors of chocolate and coffee as it neared room temp.

Burns in the back of the mouth... and that caused me to check the label... 12.4%. Yep. Pours thick with a bit more head than 2015.

Strangely, I didn't really taste a lot of coffee though the chocolate was there. The bourbon was there most definitely.  For this beer, I'd say the warmer the better. Even warmer than 55 degrees. Honestly, I may sound silly, but I wouldn't be afraid to drink this at room temp. The beer got increasingly smoother as it warmed up from my usual 55 degree start point.  I will cellar some, though I have heard it best to drink it fresh. Overall, KBS did not disappoint. I know a lot of people compare to BCBS. I won't.

Taste is the same, with the coffee coming in more in a slightly bitter aftertaste. Sweetness is slight. Alcohol is almost nonexistent, which is amazing at this ABV.  Feel is a full, rich medium. It can seem a bit thin compared to other viscous imperial stouts, but it's really nice and appropriate.  Overall, an awesome beer.

The beer is a deep chocolate brown, almost black in color, with a thin nut-brown head that dissipates but continues to lace the glass. On the nose there is coffee, first and foremost, followed by chocolate maltiness. Coffee leads on the tongue but opens up to chocolate, sweet malt, hints of bourbon, and then a surprising hint of malt bitterness that finishes with a roasted coffee and dark chocolate bite. There is a light astringency I associate with wood aging. The mouthfeel is rich, smooth, and not cloying as one might expect. In all, one of the best barrel aged stouts I've had.  As the beer warms up, notes of vanilla and oak become more prevalent. It's a beer that keeps on giving  I'm not doing this beer justice.

The head almost looks like a nitro pour. Lacing clings everywhere and lasts throughout. S-The nose is coffee immediately, with hints of chocolate midway, finishing with some alcohol at the back end. T- The taste is initially a pleasant chocolate which transitions to some coffee. There is some bourbon presence, but its much more muted than it is in a BCBS. The alcohol in the nose is covered much better than expected. F-The carbonation is light as you would expect. The beer isn't as full in mouthfeel as some other stouts, but is thick enough not to detract. O- As someone who is not a coffee drinker, I was concerned I wouldn't like this beer. Those doubts have been pushed aside. While it's not something I could drink every day, it is an excellent treat. The coffee bitterness is balanced out nicely by the chocolate. The bourbon presence is more muted than I was expecting, but still the beer is enjoyable.

The aroma that hits first is freshly ground coffee, followed by a myriad of other smells - vanilla, nutmeg, oak, plum, apricot, hickory, bourbon, cream, and apple juice. On the sip the first apparent flavor is vanilla, which come is with an ice cream smoothness, as we s some milk chocolate. The mid-palate is where the coffee comes through, but is even more cremy than on the nose, and it is accompanied by plum, date, and fig, and on the finish I get hickory and dark chocolate.

Pours completely opaque black with a fairly quickly dissipating light brown head. Smell is earthy coffee, lots of milk chocolate, oak, and mild booze. Taste follows pretty closely with a prominent woody, bourbon milk chocolate flavor and coffee. Booze is noticeable but not offensive, it hits you along with a warming sensation right at the end. Body is full but not huge, and it finishes pretty dry for the style. I poured this on the warm side to begin with but as it warms the milk chocolate flavor comes even more to the forefront.

Lots of bitter dark chocolate and roast notes on the first swallow. Roasted coffee, more chocolate, a bit of vanilla and a bit of boozy warmth. Then some lingering char, some oak, a touch of bourbon.

Alcohol legs are sure there.  Smell: all the adjuncts are there: chocolate first, a slight coffee and then a barrel that dominated my senses.  Taste: Taste is similar to the smell, barrel dominates to me, with some chocolate and coffee in there too.  Feel: Holy full mouthfeel. As someone relatively new to the craft beer scene, this is one of the thicker mouth feels I've encountered. Similar to milk. The beers alcohol certainly makes its presence known as there's a warming sensation in the chest. There's a slight bitter finish and a drying sensation as well.

1199,19960,911CROFT,4.55,"2015 Vintage (11.2%) Aged for 1 year. 355ml bottle into an oversized tulip. Paid £7.35 for a single bottle.  Pours a completely opaque, pitch-black body that is unchanged when held to the light. A one-finger in height, dark tan coloured bubbly head fades quickly to a patchy film and collar, but leaves behind plenty of thin, soapy lace.  Bourbon undoubtedly leads the aroma, but its presence isn't so powerful as to dominate. Underneath, a complex bitter-sweet mixture of dark chocolate, ripe stone fruit, wood smoke, charred malts and heavily roasted barley comprise the remainder of the nose, whilst subtle roast espresso profiles become noticeable towards the finish. Taste follows suit. Soft, warming notes of bourbon and vanilla slowly transition to a rich and heavily roasted malt profile. Dark, bitter-sweet chocolate and the slightest hint of ripe black cherry join charred, faintly smoky, robust dark malts to form the perfectly balanced mid-palate. Medium to full-bodied with a low amount of carbonation, the mouth-feel starts rich, slick and smooth, despite being just a tad thinner than expected. Towards the end, moderately bitter, dark roasted espresso, cocoa, dark chocolate and woody impressions of the oak barrelling linger on the palate for an age, finishing dry with only a trace of alcohol warmth.  Overall this is an incredible beer. The bourbon barrelling is unquestionably a prominent feature, but it is so superbly well integrated with the base beer that it never becomes too much. The exceptionally well-balanced dark roasted malt profile masks its 70 IBU’s with ease, keeping bitterness in check throughout, and at 11.2% ABV, alcohol is almost undetectable. Undoubtedly this is a treat to be sipped and savoured, I wouldn't hesitate to pick up another bottle should I be lucky enough to come across one in the UK.

1199,19960,Mateo2699,4.73,"2016 release, bottled 2-12-16. Poured into snifter.  Pour is a dark jet black. Definitely no light coming through. Very very subtle ruby red hue in light. Head leaves some crazy lacing, poured aggressively and ended up very foamy. Lacing sticks through the whole drinking session. Thin foam, great lacing.  Smell is definitely more chocolate and vanilla. I always thought the nose was more bourbon foward, guess I'm wrong. Still get subtle bourbon, but even more oak and wood. Some tabacco and some butterscotch. More sweet than expected.  Taste is a well rounded chocolate flavor, reminds me of nesquick. Once again, more sweet and less bourbon than expected. But it's still very well balanced, and even without the pronounced bourbon you still get that wood and oak very nicely. Very nice sweetness and roasted malt. Warming up a little the bourbon flavor comes through a little more.  Very interesting mouthfeel. It's actually sort of thin, not syrupy and oil thick at all. But with the bold flavors and full flavors, it feels as if it's a thick beer. Don't get much carbonation at all. Extremely velvety and smooth.  Lives up to the hype for sure. Remember the 2015 version being more bourbon foward and less sweet. Maybe it changed with time. Or maybe this being the freshest batch of KBS I've ever had, the sweet chocolate profile is more dominant.

The taste is a lot of coffee, a good amount of bourbon, and some chocolate. It's got just a little tang to it.

1199,19960,teromous,3.83,"2016 Bottle. On the back in very faint writing: ""Bottled 03/02/16 20 11 2:55 12.4% ABV""  Appearance: Black body with a thin head that is a medium shade of khaki. Not much head retention or lacing but for a 12.4% ABV beer it holds a head well enough.  Aroma: There is a definite woody aroma that stands out by itself and also melds well with a bourbon aroma. It does smell a bit boozy but for a 12.4% ABV beer that has bourbon in it that can be expected. Not a lot of aroma aside from what was previously mentioned.  Taste: Up front there is wood and bourbon. In the middle there is a bit of boozy flavor and at the end there is a very well defined chocolate flavor. The chocolate is reminiscent specifically of cocoa powder. I really enjoy the chocolate flavor in the beer and it works very well with the bourbon and wood. The label does state that it is made with coffee and I really didn't pick up any coffee flavor at all.  Mouthfeel: It feels a bit thin. It has a very light coating quality on the palate that doesn't linger long enough to deliver the flavor. Despite the thinness of the beer it still has a full body. It's a bit like if you were to put a bold flavored barbecue sauce on some meat and the sauce was very thin. The impact is there but it just doesn't lather the meat. One very good quality about this beer is the drinkability. This beer is extremely drinkable. While at 12.40% ABV this should be a sipper this beer disguises itself at a much lower ABV in drinkability standards.  Overall: I did enjoy this beer and I will really enjoy drinking the other bottles that I purchased. If I saw it in the store again I would buy it and I would recommend the same to everyone else. I did feel that the beer overall was outstanding but in a line-up it wouldn't be my first choice.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Joe_Palooka,3.72,"Okay, KBS shows up in Northern Illinois and most places that sell it get about 12 to 24 to distribute among their customers. Some sell it at suggested retail while some double the price and also make you purchase some additional Founders products. After scurrying about I was able to purchase about 6 bottles and I want to tell you I am not sure it was worth the effort. It was not as good as Avery's Barrel aged products. Last years KBS was fabulous but this years seemed a bit thin to me with a very faint Bourbon flavor. I am going to try several more as well as age a few so I will re-rate this beer again in the future. This beer kind of reminded me of a cross between Founder Imperial Stout and Founders Breakfast Stout with a slight Bourbon Flavor. It may be unfair to expect it to be of the same quality of Avery's Uncle Jacobs or Mephistopheles Stout.

1199,19960,THSmusicman,4.41,"2016 edition poured into an Allagash sample glass.  Look: No complaints here. A nice, super dark stout with a half a finger of khaki head, which leaves a very nice lacing.  Smell: Doesn't smell as good as last years did; a bit more alcohol on the nose. Starts with that, with coffee and chocolate showing up, then a bit of caramel.  Taste: Tastes much boozier than the 2015 I had. Taste mostly reflects the nose with a very alcoholic aftertaste.  Feel: Thick and creamy, as a huge barrel-aged stout should feel.  Overall: I enjoyed the 2015 edition much more than this but still enjoyed this. I will probably age a good bit of the other bottles I have.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smell - The first thing I noticed was the dark chocolate, as it warmed the booziness came out. I can also pick up some vanilla and dark roast coffee excellent nose.  Taste - Big chocolate flavors the alcohol is noticeable but blends excellently with the chocolate and vanilla notes. I also get a little more of the coffee flavor than I did in the smell.  Feel - Thick very creamy coats the mouth, slight burn from the alcohol.  Overall - I kept hearing about how great this beer was and did not expect it to live up to it but it does.

1199,19960,bwood06,4.6,"12 oz. bottle into a stout glass  A - Moderate pour produces a head that is 3 fingers in height and is very creamy in appearance and dissipates very slowly. The head is a very dark khaki in color. The beer itself is pitch black with only tiny bubbles visible around the edges of the lower third of the glass. These bubbles rise fairly quickly. 4.5/5  S - The aroma is incredibly dark and complex with chiefly dark roasted notes but a bit of sweetness as well. Vanilla, bourbon, caramel, toffee, dark roast coffee beans, dark chocolate, blackstrap molasses, pumpernickel bread, tar, tobacco, and smoke all come out at once and create an amazing aroma that makes you just want to sit and smell this beer. Hops are hard to distinguish but seem to be slightly earthy. 4.5/5  T - The flavor is somewhat dull at first but then leaps forward a warp speed into caramel, vanilla, bourbon, and oak all at once, very similar to a bourbon sip. As undertones to these notes there is molasses and toffee. Very strong sweetness to start things off here. The dark roasted coffee beans and dark chocolate comes in right in the middle of the flavor profile alongside some smokiness and burnt pumpernickel bread. The final third of the sip features a bit of tar and tobacco along with a bourbon and oak spiciness and finishes out with a roasted coffee bean bitterness that lingers slightly alongside a hint of booziness. 4.5/5  M - Light carbonation tickle up front but smooth and creamy the rest of the way. Light alcohol burn but nothing unpleasant. Very heavy beer but not unpleasantly heavy in the slightest. Coats the tongue and has only a bit of drying on the back end of the sip but this does linger slightly. 4.25/5  O - Incredibly well balanced between sweet, bitter, and earthy with a complex aroma and flavor profile that is a wonder to sip on. This is a sipping beer, no doubt about it (if nothing else due to the high abv). The bourbon does not come out and beat you over the head like many bourbon barrel aged beers do. Rather it comes across as a complement to the coffee, chocolate, and molasses notes. 4.5/5",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,Jay_P22,4.9,"KBS! Poured from the tap into a snifter.  Looks like a regular stout, with a nice head and lacing.  Nose has an amazing chocolate and coffee smell.  Taste is chocolatey goodness and coffee, with the right amount of bourbon. Some styles are too agressive, or boozy, but this is almost perfection.  Overall this brew smooth for a 12% abv. This is my favorite stout. I could drink these all day. I love that it comes in a regular 12 oz bottle as well. Most times I don't want more bourbon stout than 12 oz, and this style usually comes in bombers. KBS is amazing, and worth seeking out. The distro is getting a little easier now to find. I recommend buying some and aging some.

The aroma is a perfect marriage of sweet bourbon and roasty coffee. You get butterscotch, caramel, vanilla, milk chocolate, espresso bean, and burnt toast. Upfront, you get milk chocolate candy and bittersweet dark chocolate. Toward the middle, you get burnt toast, black coffee, caramel, and toasted coconut. Finishes with butterscotch, bourbon, and bright vanilla beans. Finishes semi-sweet with lingering cocoa, vanilla, and oak. Smooth, silky mouthfeel. Ghost-like carbonation. It's not super creamy, but it's filling and enriching.  Another awesome bourbon barrel aged imperial coffee stout.

I was surprised that it poured a little more brown that black but definitely dark black in the glass. I know this is heresy but I enjoyed it cold from the refrigerator as opposed to warmed up a little. As it warmed it felt thinner not necessarily bigger. Definitely more bourbon as it warmed.

L: Pretty standard look for a stout  S:Lots of coffee and and chocolate  T: Again lots of coffee and chocolate, followed by bourbon  F: Impressively light for a 12% abv. This is what really made the beer for me. I was expecting something more thick from such a high abv dark beer.  O: I am not a huge fan of stouts, and this beer was not enough of a revelation to change my opinion. I would probably not pay the ridiculous price for this beer again (I'd like to see this site add a ""value"" tab in addition to LSTFO).

1199,19960,gshak,4.46,"Bottled 2/16/16. I'm comparing this to the only other beer I've tasted like it - Alesmith's BBA Speedway. A - A nice pour out of the bottle at about cellar temperature, yielding a mocha head that dissipated quickly. Not quite as sludgy as the BBA Speedway. S - Huge aromas of bourbon and coffee straight out of the bottle. Some oak and vanilla, but the coffee and bourbon are pretty much dominating everything else. T - Intense bitter coffee notes, sharp bourbon, chocolate, roasted malt. F - Feels thinner than the Speedway. Perhaps the beer is a touch too young, and the alcohol and the hops combine to give it a thinner mouthfeel than it otherwise is. O - A very impressive beer that will likely be better in a few months from now.  Edit 5/6/2016: What a difference a month makes! The alcohol has subsided a bit, and that allows the coffee and chocolate to shine. The mouthfeel is much improved as well. This is definitely on the fuller side now.

Taste is amazing, like a bourbon coffee fudge dessert bar with bourbon leading the way. Mouthfeel is medium heavy, leaning towards medium. Overall a crazy stout with crazy hype, love it from start to finish. Let this beast warm to get full effect.

S: Roast, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, booze, a slight hint of smoke, and some dark fruits.  T: Similar to the aroma: Roast, coffee. chocolate, oak, bourbon, char, vanilla, a bit of booze and it's accompanying heat, a lingering roasty bitterness that is not at all overwhelming or out of place.  F: Lighter than expected (which is a strength for my palate) Very smooth with moderate carbonation and a stickiness that compounds over time.  O: Fantastic. Brilliantly complex and the flavors are delightfully balanced. The booze is slightly more apparent than I'd like, but I presume a little time will assist in that regard. Highly recommended.

Like all fine imperial/double stouts, the flavors of KBS get more complex as it warms. On the taste, you get coffee, chocolate, bourbon and the oak flavor from the barrel.. But one does not dominate over the other. All flavors coexist in perfect harmony. The smell is as good as the taste. It's just slightly on the thin side as it relates to mouthfeel, so that's the only area I would downgrade it a bit.. I'm glad I was able to score a 4 pack of this yesterday.

Aroma is coffee, chocolate, bourbon, oak, and alcohol. Taste, this one is HOT! the booziness hits up front and comes back in the finish. There is great coffee, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, oak, dark fruits, etc, but that booze really detracts and disappoints. Also a bit more thin than I prefer my stouts, but if the booziness hadnt been there I probably wouldnt have noticed. I had a bottle of '15 in January and enjoyed it much more, less hot and more of the bourbon and base stout flavors came through. Glad to try it fresh, so happy I have 3 more and I will definitely be aging them in hopes that the heat subsided and the mouthfeel thickens up. In the meantime, I have plenty of FIS to enjoy :)  Had a second bottle of 16. Still not as chewy as I like, but it's not hot. That's just bourbon flavor.

Taste: very nice. you get the coffee and chocolate notes up front. Then you get a roasted bourbon type character followed but a decent linger of bitterness. I guess there is a bit a vanilla somewhere in here.  Mouthfeel: pretty satisfactory.

Also had the 16 version at just over a year and found it tasted excellent. most of the sharp bourbon and coffee had faded but as a whole the same notes were present and tasted so round and cohesive. awesome stuff founders!

What KBS taught me was that I had a deep appreciation for stouts...which up to that point I had not realized. Now, stouts are my preferred beer and I wait anxiously every year for KBS to be released. This beer is outstanding. One of the best regular release beers in the world in my opinion (and I am the inventory coordinator of a beer wholesaler that sells beers from all over the world... so I get to try beers from all over the world). If you are reading this because you are trying to decide if it is worth the price tag.. stop thinking and buy it. There is no way in hell you will be disappointed.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,johnamo,4.56,"2016 edition, 12.4%abv, poured into an official Founders KBS tulip glass (of course).  Look: charcoal black; nearly opaque. Thin, dark caramel head that disappears without lacing.  Smell: mostly coffee, with sweet vanilla and slight oak.  Taste: a huge, sweet wallop of nearly-fresh coffee and dark, melted chocolate. Alcohol is there, but not overpowering. Lingering notes of slightly astringent tannins from the oak - but pleasantly so, delivering more complexity beyond the initial coffee/chocolate powerhouse.  Feel: thick and creamy, with a sticky, syrupy coffee/vanilla aftertaste. My tongue has an almost anesthetic tingle from the alcohol.  Overall: An excellent, unique beer. Sweet, powerful, and tasty. Never had anything quite like it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,bladehines,5,"First off this is NOT a new KBS!!!! This review is for an aged KBS! The bottle says ""bottled on 02/08/10!!!!!!!!! That being said let's begin!  I stored this beer from day one in a cellar fridge always kept between 55-65 degrees.  Look - SUPER BLACK! No carbonation left on pour at all, some in mouth if you let it set. Great pour. Smell - toasted coffee, dark dark chocolate, leather, tobacco. Very earthy! Taste - sharp start, bitter chocolate rounded over by coffee under tones. Earthly over all, SUPER CLEAN FINISH! No detectable alcohol taste until after swallowing, then you can feel the vapors at the back of the throat. Smooth as glass. I can taste very little of the ""bourbon"" quality left (I like bourbon), my wife who doesn't like bourbon can taste it more but loves this beer! Feel - very coating of the entire mouth until swallowed then fades away nicely to a hint of coffee. Slightly viscous overall.  Overall - happy I waited to age this beer 6 full years from the bottled date!!!!! When I purchased the 4 pack in 2010, I drank one every year for 3 years. Don't really know why I waited this long to drink the last but glad I did!!!!!!!!  Lastly this is prob the longest I might age a KBS, longer and I think you would lose more of the overall flavors.

1199,19960,Harrison8,4.5,"**2016 variety, poured from self-serve tap, drank on 4/13/16. Reviewed from notes. Scored above.  When fresh, a hearty, creme colored foamy head springs up and hangs around for a while over a jet black beer. Lacing is prevalent. Aroma is chalk full of complexities, including bourbon, oak, coffee, and chocolate. Boozy bourbon and alcohol poke through too. Taste opens with oak and sweet, biscuit malts. A wave of booze, bourbon, coffee, and chocolate hits next. It's mighty strong and powerful. Borderline hot. A little bit of grainy yeast at the end of the finish. Mouth feel is thick, robust, hearty, filling, and slightly mouth coating. Overall, a sublime beer. Borderline hot, so it may suit it to age it and tame the burn a little, but otherwise fantastic. Complex, and yet drinkable.  Served in a 12oz snifter. 8oz pour. Poured straight into glass.  **2014 variety, drank on 2/28/16 Score: 4/4.5/4.5/4.25/4.5  Pours totally black with a little dark caramel colored fizz when aged. No lacing or the like left behind. Sweet biscuit malt, caramel, and oak. Little bit of a booze burn, but nothing bad. Sweet, malty syrup opening, with hints of caramel, coffee, bourbon, and oak coming in later. Mouth feel is extremely smooth and easy to go down. Maybe a little thin, but not watery. Overall, a really good barrel aged stout. Plenty going on, while still remaining filling.

World class nose of bourbon, cocoa, vanilla, a hint of coffee and subtle roast and oak notes over a base of caramel and biscuit.  Almost full body with a texture that is creamy and possesses an oily character as well. Superb carbonation with a nice effervescent middle coupled with a very prickly finish.  The flavor profile is world class. It is intense, complex and masterfully balanced. Bourbon is the primary flavor but is buttressed by a rich malt base that pops with roast producing a somewhat sweet stout. Coffee, oak and chocolate comprise the supporting cast of this renowned stout. Bitterness is mild in the middle with roast rather evident over a subtle oak character. From the middle on, chocolate notes are ascending to challenge the bourbon. The finish has a bit of heat and subtle astringency that actually add to the complexity of this masterpiece.

Taste really follows smell, with some interesting layers. The coffee jumps out on the pallet from the get go, giving way to bourbon, oak, and great amount of warming vanilla. The finish brings the coffee back to the forefront with some bitterness, but everything is in harmony and nothing is overly roasted or burnt. Mouthfeel is thinner than I'd expect (though this isn't an IRS, so I might just be mislead by my mental dreams of this white whale of a beer).

Lees Harvest Ale), subtle metallic penny quality, the roasty coffee note is the most prominent thing here (though the boozy note become much stronger as the beer settles).  T: Immediate chocolate, coffee and cinnamon with a hint of bitterness (which becomes slightly more prominent) and a mild soy-esque umami character, there is a boozy note here and while it is definitely present, it is not overwhelming, some warm vanilla notes here as well (a side note in regards to the vanilla, it becomes noticeable as the beer sits, and will be drowned out by bitterness if you swill the beer. For that reason, only swill the beer to get aroma). The cinnamon becomes more prominent as the beer settles out. the bourbon is most present in the general warmth and aftertaste (I get more booze than outright bourbon though I do get some bourbon). The boozy note smoothly blends in with the richness of the coffee as the beer settles out.  M: not nearly as thick as one might think though full and silky nonetheless, with a tinge of sharpness from the carbonation  O: Where to begin with this beer, it seems like I feel differently about it every time I have it. This time I'm feeling that it is superb and complex, but not as good as I recall from the first time I opened one of the 2017s. Don't get me wrong it's an excellent beer, but there is something personally about this beer that keeps me from loving it, I think that I personally, might like it better if it were either just a tad sweeter, or a tad less bitter (not that it's overly bitter but the bitterness distracts from the richness of the beer). Nonetheless, it is a superb beer (not as good as barrel aged el gordo IMHO) and is more or less worthy of the praise it receives.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,Sabtos,3.81,"Black with a very large, tan frothy head that leaves some some legs and sparse curtains.  A whiff of chocolate milk comes off fresh out of the bottle. Coffee and oak follow, with a hint of bourbon giving almost no warning of what's to come. There's some molasses in there as well.  Flavors of roasted coffee and chocolate come up front, then hot bourbon immediately follows with some vanilla from the oak. Nutty flavors support. Drink this fresh, as overall, this can become too boozy--the heat builds and builds over a session, and if it's not fresh, there's really not enough coffee or roastiness to survive the very whiskey-forward attributes. KBS has a very hot exhale, with an almost red fruit sweetness, and lots of wet oak.  The medium, slick body has a frothy mouthfeel and a surprisingly dry finish. All in all I like SMS, and especially BCBCS, much more. But this is still a top notch, drinkable BA coffee stout, just a little woodier and boozier than I prefer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A truly unique nose - rich bourbon with dark chocolate undertones - few other bourbon barrel beers capture the bourbon scent as well on the nose as this beer. Palate opens with coffee, chocolate, and boozy bourbon-y sweetness. As with so many beers in this style, the palate opens dramatically as the beer warms, and the deep bourbon elements swell to dominate the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is wonderfully thick. A truly rich beer. Overall, a truly exceptional beer that occupies the bourbon barrel imp stout category with classic Founder's rich sweetness. My only critique is that beer doesn't quite have the same depth and complexity of some other imperial stouts. That doesn't stop this beer from occupying - or rather, dominating - a unique flavor niche within the bourbon barrel category.

The nose is a WHISKY punch with a faint whiff of coffee following behind. Over the tongue it is super smooth and creamy with an explosion of dark chocolate, espresso, and tons of bourbon. This is a damn good beer, although I think earlier years were better. Having said all that, KBS has fallen of the pedestal in my book as other BA stouts have caught my attention. KBS has earned its place in beer history that's for sure, but I find myself wanting more from 2015 KBS than it is willing to give.

1199,19960,hopflyer,4.31,"Revisited 2017 version...completely Different from my 2015 version. Drank this one fresh. Bourbon much more subdued but adequately there. Chocolate forward with coffee and light bitterness background. Barrel carries a smooth vanilla flavor.  Feel is still quite thin but little in way of lingering bitterness. A touch of booze heat.  Glad I gave this another shot.  2015 version bottled 3/5/15. Consumed 12/5/15.  Pours jet black, no highlights even when held up to light. Head is one finger, light tan. Retains a thin ring and sparse film on top. Looks really good.  Nose is mostly bourbon whiskey. Not in your face, but that is the smell. Not picking up much coffee, chocolate. If anything, there's faint light roast coffee. Where's the chocolate?  Taste again is whiskey forward all the way. There is a touch of coffee but everything else is dominated the whiskey. Some bitterness, which is expected with 70 IBUs. Bourbon retreats a little as it warms, but only opens up to bitterness instead of char, wood, or chocolate. Some vanilla arrives late.  Feel is just medium body and carb is sufficient and not overdone. Surprised and let down that this isn't heavier. Lingering bitterness, maybe too much, and some boozy heat.  I gotta say I'm pretty disappointed. I chased this each year and struck out. Got one bottle this past year. This doesn't have much depth beyond the bourbon. Doesn't even carry a whole lot of oak, wood from the barrel and I'm really not picking up any of the chocolate. Yes there is coffee and bitterness, but for something sought after be so many, I would think this had something special. It doesn't! Nonetheless, it's a decent BBA Coffee stout, but not worthy of such high marks.  Revisited 2017 version...completely",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,thepenguin,4.53,"Bottled March 2014 Reviewed 11/6/15  L: Black as a hearse, with a very minimal tan head. Nice sticky lacing left behind.  S: A bit more vinous and oxidized than fresher bottles, but once you get past the green olive briny note the bourbon and oak pull through, mingling with a nice mild chocolately roastiness. Compared to FBS, I’d say the chocolate is a bit more dominant than the coffee. The coffee pops a bit more as it warms, coming across as musky and earthy rather than vibrant.  T: Creamy and deliciously sweet. Again, the bourbon is definitely apparent (not so much the oak) with semisweet chocolate, vanilla, and rugelach (may be the first time someone’s pulled that out in a beer review). At 70 IBUs I expected this to have a pretty firm backbone but instead leaves little noticeable bitterness while still remaining incredibly balanced. The taste doesn’t have the same vinous sherry-like flavor noticed in the aroma, but flavors do seem more muted than with fresher bottles.  F: Unbelievably tame for 11.2% served at just under room temperature. Creamy and chewy, with very moderate carbonation. Very impressive in this category.  Overall: KBS is a delightful beer – truly one of the classics in the BBA Stout category. This was a delightful beer to drink – not as pronounced, nuanced or frankly tasty as a fresh bottle, but quite balanced with the bourbon notes holding up nicely.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,fscottkey,4.09,"A: [4.75] Beer is very dark brown to black. It forms about 1 finger of tan colored head. The head takes a while to recede and leaves a coating around the glass. Sipping the beer leaves tons of lacing clinging to the glass. The bottle lists the ABV (11.2%) and it has a born on date (03/05/15).  S: [3.75] Vanilla, coffee and booziness and maybe a bit of smoke. I let the beer warm for quite a while but it is still not as open as I'd like on the nose.  T: [4.00] Chocolate, coffee, toasted marshmallow, slight heat from the booze. The booze accumulates with each sip. But so does a pleasant smokey flavor. Like you get from whiskey.  M: [4.50] Nice rich body. Minimal carbonation contributing more to the heft and chewy feeling.  O: [4.25] I think head to head I'd choose Founders Breakfast stout over KBS. FBS has similar flavors but without the extra booziness. Don't get me wrong this is a really good beer, extremely smooth mouthfeel. The flavor has elements of chocolate, coffee and toasted goodness. For an 11% beer I was expecting a bit more nose.

I get coffee on the finish. However, the dominant aroma is the bourbon and the barrel characteristic.  This beer is exquisite and constantly changing. It's a perfect balance between sweet, smokey, and bitter. Dark chocolate and roasted coffee peaks through in the beginning. Each individual flavor surfaces for an instant before rejoining the others. The beer is not overly sweet, as it is cut by a slight bitterness in the finish. Plenty of barrel and tobacco smokiness in the middle of the sip. Pure bourbon and bitterness extend past the sip. A mild alcohol presence and heat is active as the beer warms.  Overall, this is a world class beer. My only disappointment with the beer is that it is a touch thin in the mouthfeel in comparison to the flavor. It is a bit of a mismatch. Don't consume this with anything.

Black in color with orange tint. Rising bubbles are very small in size and moderate in quantity. Lacing is thick and moderate. SMELL: Strong aromas of molasses, figs, and plums, entangle with mild aromas of vanilla, sweet chocolate, sweet coffee, and subtle aromas of oak, bourbon, and bitter roasted malts. TASTE: Initial taste is of strong molasses, fig, and plum flavors. Mild sweet chocolate, vanilla, and sweet coffee flavors enter right after. Next, enters mild flavors of oak along with subtle flavors of bourbon and bitter roasted malts as all flavors persist, except for vanilla and coffee, which grow stronger. FEEL: Full-bodied with hints of carbonation. Goes down smoother than a Keystone and creamier than cream itself. Finishes with a moderate dryness. NOTE: An amazing imperial stout, however, I feel this is strongly hyped. I have definitely had better. ______________________________ 2016 Release Poured at 48°F from a 12oz bottle (bottled on 12Feb16) into a Spiegelau Stout glass. Allowed to warm up to 50°F before reviewing. Consumed on 11May16. LOOK: A fingers worth of dense, cinnamon colored foam is formed after the initial pour. Well after 3 minutes, the foam head hasn't receded, but has only become slightly less dense and has changed color to khaki. Black in color with an orange luster. A plethora of small, rising bubbles explains the head's refusal to die. Lacing is high in quantity and both thick and very thick. SMELL: Strong aromas of coconut, sweet chocolate, and sweet coffee entangle with mild bourbon and oak aromas. Subtle aromas of vanilla and molasses further contribute to the complexity of the sweetness while hints of bitter roasted malts join the bourbon aromas in bringing balance to the brew. TASTE: A wondrous sweetness takes hold of the palate as strong sweet chocolate, sweet coffee, and coconut flavors enter. Mild bourbon flavors grab onto the palate right after and ensure that no cloying takes place. Sweet coffee flavors fade to mild as mild molasses along with subtle vanilla and oak flavors make their debut. Hints of bitter roasted malts trail lastly as chocolate, coffee, and coconut flavors maintain, but bourbon, molasses, vanilla, and oak flavors all grow slightly stronger. FEEL: The thickness of the beer lies somewhere between medium-bodied and full-bodied. Given that this is an Imperial Stout, that is quite disappointing. Carbonation levels are subtle. The beer goes down smooth and creamy.

1199,19960,TooHop4U,4.44,"11.9% (Ohio) version. Bottled 03/09/16, served at 50*F. Dark, rich, complex. Nose is all chocolate and coffee. Bourbon comes through in a nice, subtle way - less coffee on the finish. More savory than sweet...really not too boozy/hot, but somehow sacrificed some flavor",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,tregan_20,4.66,"I purchased the beer at a local liquor store and poured into a pint glass. The appearance was really dark, almost black. The head was tan in color like espresso/mocha. The smell consisted of roasted chocolate, espresso and bourbon, with a hint of oakiness to it. The taste is very close to the smell... coffee / espresso / mocha / bourbon / malty flavor. The feel was a bit heavy and somewhat chewy. Overall, this is Founder's best offering in my opinion, just above their Breakfast Stout. Definitely worth trying! Cheers!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Elsuperjefe,4.96,"Phenomenal. Strong caramel nose followed by a perfect balance of roasted coffee, vanilla and sweet malt. Can't say enough about this master stout.

1199,19960,XBeerBellyT,5,"Pitch Black, wouldn't expect it any other way. Smell was roasty, vanilla, a little oaky from barrells, chocolate with little hint of booze. Taste amazing.

1199,19960,EdwardAbbey,4.48,"There are now many better barrel-aged imperial stouts out there these days, but this remains a deserved classic, and a smooth and subtle beast. The chocolate and coffee are front and center here, with the barrels definitely in the background. I'm definitely okay with that, but on the flip side this beer's flaws, in my eyes, are that it probably needs a touch more barrel character and fuller mouthfeel.

Very nice vanilla bourbon aroma. Taste is similar with coffee, vanilla and bourbon, blends really well together, none of the flavors dominate. Carbonation is perfect and mouthfeel is so soft.

Pours nearly black with just a hint of mocha on the fringes. Moderately viscous with a slight dark brown head that brings the foam of an espresso to mind.

1199,19960,Jacobier10,4.35,"Bottled 03/04/2015, 12 oz bottle.  Poured into a snifter.  Pitch black color, opaque, with a small tan head that sticks to the side of the glass. Decent retention initially, but fades the longer it sits. Sparse lacing, and a quick swirl of the glass reveals some legs from the barrel aging.  Heavy chocolate malt aroma. Some coffee mixed in, as well as a hint of vanilla. The alcohol is quite prominent, though it’s more reminiscent of straight alcohol or vodka than bourbon. Not much complexity. Chocolate definitely dominates here.  Upon tasting, the bourbon hits you right away. It’s amazing how well-masked it is in the aroma yet jumps out as soon as you take a sip. You get more of the chocolate too, but the coffee is a distant memory.  The texture was my least favorite feature. A bit too thin given the strength of the aroma and flavor. Medium to full bodied, but could definitely benefit from more. Moderate sweetness from the combination of bourbon and chocolate, yet not overdone. Long lasting flavor.  KBS was something I had wanted to try for a long time and it lived up to expectations. I previously missed out on several opportunities to try it at bars. The timing just never seemed to work out. Then, when I was least expecting it, the local store near my office had “found some bottles in the back” and individually scattered them throughout the beer section. A lucky find indeed...  #5 Beers of Fame; #16 Top 250 Beers; #16 Top Rated - USA; #2 Top Rated - Michigan; #10 Top Rated - American Imperial Stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,James_Michaud91,4.16,"Pours a thick, opaque, pitch black, with a small brown head that fades quickly. Smell has a TON of chocolate with some minor coffee notes (2 or 3 year old bottle). The flavor is again dominated a bit by the chocolate, but it is still really tasty. As it warms in the glass the roasted malt flavors begin to wake up a bit. Would love to try this a little fresher when the coffee is a bit more prominent. The texture of this beer is damn near perfect, thick and mouth coating without being cloyingly sweet. Really glad I got to try this.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,TomMorris,4.61,"Was lucky enough to catch this on tap at World of Beer in Stamford, CT.  Look: Mine came out pitch black with about a full finger of chocolate-brown head, which quickly dissipated.  Smell: WOW, just brilliant. Huge notes of coffee, chocolate, and vanilla held together nicely by bourbon; smells like a decadent chocolate cake coated in bourbon. Quite possibly the best-smelling beer I've yet to experience.  Taste: The immediate taste is an explosion of chocolate with some lighter coffee notes that somewhat quickly fades into a pleasant bourbon and vanilla after taste. After the fantastic and assertive nose, the taste was much more subtle and balanced. Definitely delicious, but lacking the punch I was hoping for.  Mouthfeel: Definitely the weakest part of the beer. This is actually incredibly easy to drink despite the complexity and abv; it does start out thick and viscous but it very quickly becomes thin after contact with the tongue. I would love for this to be thicker and chewier.  Overall: Without a doubt a fantastic beer, probably even one of the top 10 I've yet to try, but I could fathom it being even better if the taste matched the strength of the nose and the mouthfeel had more substance. I would still call this a world-class brew, but it's just lacking that little something that would make it really special.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Strong chocolate and caramel notes, with coffee and vanilla developing on the palate as well. However, the overwhelming (and at times, overpowering) flavor is the bourbon notes. They hit hard and linger long after the others have gone, being outlasted only by the residual sweetness.

Rich, thick, dense, black as sin, and decent foam on medium carbonation, the texture of a great beastly stout is there. And it gets better once you sip it. This is, for my money, the superior big brother of CBS, and while it shares textural qualities, it's a different animal and, aside from being easier to find, my preferred brew.  Not overtly chocolatey, but plenty of cocoa and coffee for sure, which keeps it from being overwhelmingly sweet. The bitterness of the flavor works here better than any stout I've had before, I think. There's also a mesmerizingly chalky, tannic texture to the bitterness brought on by the cocoa and oak - what I assume is charred oak from the smokey smell that, mixed with a hint of vanilla, makes me dream of this beer days later.

1199,19960,woemad,4.57,"12oz bottle courtesy of LehighAce06. No bottling or “best by” date, but it’s the 2015 vintage according to the label. This was a longtime want.  Poured into an Iron Goat snifter, this was inky black and quite viscous looking as it poured out of the bottle. There was a modest tan head that dropped quickly, which was not a surprise given this beer’s potency, but a collar of tan foam remained afterwards. The lace reminds me of pictures of distant clumps of trees on the African Savannah.  Boozy and sweet aroma, in that order. It smells like a dessert. Although the label boasts of 70 IBUs, no hop aroma seems able to cut through the scents given off by the dark malts, bourbon, chocolate and coffee.  This beer tastes rich and decadent. Chocolate and bourbon lead the assault on the taste buds. The coffee flavor is more subdued, kicking in after the initial flavor blast and providing a kind of backbone of rich bitterness to the sweeter aspects. There’s a big, boozy undercurrent here. It doesn’t exactly dominate things, but it keeps you aware at all times that this is a BIG beer. Slight dry, hoppy zap at the swallow, but that’s about the extent of any standout hop character.  Full bodied, with a rich, sticky, coating, velvety mouthfeel.  God, I love this beer! It’s great after a late breakfast and coffee, but would be amazing after a dinner or as a nightcap. Going forward, my problem is that I’ll have to trade or do more BIFs just to get this beer again. Thanks, Kevin!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,emalc,4.17,"2015 vintage, bottling date 2/11/15. I've found quite a bit of variation between the different batches this year, even in a side-by-side blind tasting, but this is the first one I've sat down to do a proper review on.  L - Body pours opaque dark brown with garnet highlights. Thin beige head dissipates quickly.  S - Vanilla, bourbon, molasses, and oak leap off. The oak becomes more prominent as it warms. Moderate coffee roast and milk-chocolate covered almonds. A hint of brown sugar and licorice. No hops, esters, or phenolics. I'm looking for the ethanol, and can't find it - very well masked, even with the prominent bourbon character. I could smell this for hours.  T - Dark chocolate, oak, and coffee predominate. Again, the oak intensifies as it warms. Roasted and chocolate malts are vivid, and a bitterness from the roast and the bittering hops in the finish keep it from even thinking about being cloying. For me, though, the oak is too far out of balance and gives a tannic astringency that really knocks this version down a peg. The alcohol is present here, far more than the aroma lets on.  F - Tannins from the oak gives a significantly astringent finish. Moderate alcohol warming. Medium body - a somewhat fuller mouthfeel could better support the substantial character of the beer. Medium-low carbonation and creaminess.  O - This vintage is over-oaked for my tastes, which really pulls it down a notch compared to some others batches/vintages that I've had. The nose is tremendous, though, and if Founders can ever nail both the nose and the taste in the same batch (as they've done separately, in my opinion) then we've got a real contender for top honors.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

This does that: whiskey in coffee one sip, chocolate plum bonbons the next. Chocolate is big, dark, and right upfront; coffee, less so. Dark fruit all hit on the sweet side, though there's the occasional astringent fig note or hit of dark malt acidity. A massive stout, all right, but incredibly drinkable - one sip follows the next and it's tough to slow down.

The nose was a mix of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon. I couldn't resist taking a sip from this dark brew with a great khaki head. The taste followed the nose but some of the flavors were faint and then the bitterness hit me. OK well I am always one to let my stouts warm up to see if they develop. This beer got better as it warmed. Once warmed all the flavors developed and meshed together very, very well and the bitterness subsided. The flavors danced around your mouth while the beer felt very silky. Ok now the bourbon was there but it did not overpower the beer letting all the flavors and roastiness come through. I really enjoyed that the coffee was not over the top. While I have been let down by other highly sought after beers this is not one of them.

Extremely smooth, perhaps the silkiest, velvety mouthfeel ever.

This meets that definition. Putting aside any hype or disdain for the honors this beer has received, this has shaken up my expectations for a barrel aged beer. Often times I have enjoyed a world-class BA stout or barleywine and thought to myself, ""wow, I'm curious how this will be a year or several down the road"". That does not apply to KBS. All of the disparate elements are present: bold coffee notes, decadent chocolate, rich malt flavors, oak barrel, and boozy heat of bourbon.  The combination of these notes is so seamless in a way that one does not overpower the other. That is where this beer succeeds. It is from this balance that I initially have not wanted to age this beer any further. I truly first sipped this beer and could not offer any other suggestions for improvement.

It is very good, but I don't think it is elite like the FW barrel aged beers. In fact, I recently tried a Lagunitas High Westified Imperial Stout that fresh was very comparable and similar to KBS at 1 year. For the details, KBS smells very nice, has a great, sweet smell almost like vanilla ice cream. The taste is more bittersweet chocolate, but not too hot as the age helped mellow it.

1199,19960,AmeriCanadian,4.03,"KBS is definitely one of those OG American stouts that I longed to try for years, enjoyed immensely when I finally got a chance, and have consumed a few of just about every year since. But it is one that I've definitely fallen out of love with over the years, largely as I've gotten the chance to try much better BA stouts (and even non-BA stouts) from other breweries. Perhaps the beer, itself, has changed over time, as well, but I largely chalk up KBS's decreased appeal (to me) to my palate and competition. I have tried to leave my original scores mostly alone over time as I've revisited the beer, but there have been some changes. It remains a gorgeous specimen of a big stout, pitch black and silky looking, with little more than a small cap of mocha head but decent lacing. Unfortunately the aroma and taste profile, while big and bold, come off to me as overly coffee-forward and sharp. It isn't that those things are bad -- far from it, and what's there is very tasty -- I just prefer more balance and nuance (chocolate, dark fruits, barrel notes...I'll come back to that last one momentarily) in these types of beers. The feel is also a little on the thin side.  My biggest complaint -- which I don't remember being an issue years ago, but which is an obvious weakness more recently -- is the lack of strong barrel character in the beer. If this was just a coffee stout (thinking Breakfast Stout), then fine. But this is a barrel-aged stout, and the notes you would expect to be absorbed into the liquid -- caramel, toffee, vanilla, oak, tannins, tobacco, dark fruits, nuttiness, molasses, carmelized char -- simply aren't there in meaningful amounts.

1199,19960,dd43,4.54,"Based on the 2015 bottling. Poured into a stout glass after allowing it to warm on the counter for 20 minutes. An imperial stout at fridge temperature makes no sense.  My pour was on the gentle side, and thus head formation was on the low end. Inky black in appearance, very opaque. Head is a lovely milk chocolate brown in color.  Aroma wise you are hit with a blend of vanilla, a slight nutty/coffee note, bittersweet chocolate, and most definitely alcohol. Descriptors like ""hot"" and ""boozy"" apply to this beer more so than a lot of other high ABV stouts that I've tried. No hiding 11.2% in this big boy. The alcohol makes itself known again on the exhale, in an almost whiskey-like fashion. It feels appropriate given the style and the brewer's intentions for this beer.  Malt flavors are that of roast coffee and dark chocolate, hop bitterness on the side palate is present but not overwhelming. There is also a wood character that must come from the aging barrels, wine aficionados would call it oaky. The mouthfeel is silky smooth but with less body than I was expecting given the overall portfolio of appearance, flavors and aromas in this beer.  One thing that could make the 2015 bottling even better is to age it for 9 months to a year.

Not a barrel heavy beer, but coffee, dark roasted malt and cocoa notes abound. Viscosity has improved.  I must have gotten a bad lot last year. This is my 4th yearly sampling, and this one is back on track. I prefer bourbon heavier, but this is my own personal shortcoming... Not the beers problem. Well done Founders. As a big fan of your standard and limited releases, this beer deserves praise at this price point.  I have been lucky, diligent, and cunning enough to score at least 12 each year.

1199,19960,SerialTicker,4.65,"3/21/16 UPDATE! Original review: 5/2/15.  So much better than I remember. I can say this is much better than what I remember having last year... I wonder if the beer I had last year was the same as this. This has such a great.... everything. I love the depth of flavor, and the mouthfeel is fantastic as well. Flavors of bourbon, coffee, chocolate, wood, a little bit of char, vanilla, a little alcohol... crazy tasty. So much going on. Alcohol is perfectly present and not too warming, even fresh, bottled just over a month ago. The feel is pretty unique for a 12.4% beer -- it's thin, but not. It's slick. It's a little creamy. The carbonation is surprisingly prickly and nice near the finish. Disregard what I said about this beer before, this is a winner, and one I'm ecstatic to just have gotten three bottles of this year.  Good God, finally. I've been interested in this ever since I started enjoying the style 2.5 years ago. I couldn't ever manage a bottle, but I got a howler (32oz growler) fill for $27 including tax earlier today. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint. My expectations are stupidly high... which is probably a bad thing.  Appearance: Poured down the center of the glass and gave a thick and creamy brown head about two fingers high that went down to a thin layer. The color is, of course, pitch black, and there's basically no lacing. Great looking beer as a whole. (4.5/5)  Smell: Very nice. Really a lot of coffee in there, which I wasn't really expecting -- dark roast coffee is one of the first things I pick up, followed by roasted malt, and a little bit of chocolate, too. Really, I don't know what it is, but I don't pick up an insane level of oak or vanilla -- I do get a fair amount of bourbon though, that's for sure. KBS definitely smells ""hotter"" than some other BBA'd stouts I've had. (4.75/5)  Taste/feel: And this is where I'll lose some friends (as if I have any) -- it's just not quite blowing me away. I will say, it's unique and unlike BCBS (the popular comparison). Coffee stands out in a huge way with KBS, being at the forefront, and then it's very heavy on the bourbon, with a pretty bitter finish -- this is not at all syrupy sweet like many others in the style, and for that, I appreciate it... but I'm not sure that it's worthy of a 100 rating on this site. Of course, I'm just one unpopular opinion. It's just that I don't get an overwhelming amount of depth in this beer. It's a lot like black coffee with a shot of bourbon, and just a little tiny bit of vanilla/oak/barrel... but mostly coffee and bourbon. The aftertaste is that dark roast coffee with a bit of a boozy burn, and a fair amount of warmth. Maybe it's because this is fresh and/or from the tap, but my jaw's certainly not to the floor. As it warms up a bit of dark chocolate hits the back of the tongue on the finish, but some more barrel character would go a long way here. (4.25/5, 3.5/5)  The mouthfeel of this is, as I figured it would be, quite nice. It's not super thick and heavy like some other BBA'd stouts, but it's got a reasonably nice feel and makes for an excellent sipper.  A great beer, but without a doubt, a very disappointing one, simply because I was expecting this to be, if not my all-time favorite beer, right up there. It turns out it barely cracks my Top 50. I'll finish my howler tomorrow and make rating adjustments if necessary, but as of now, this is just a very good (albeit overhyped) BBA'd stout. I don't think this beer is better than BCBS, or the far lesser known but still insanely awesome Bourbon Ben's Asthma by Short's. It's a beer I'd most definitely have again, but I wouldn't seek it out aggressively. If I do find this beer again, I hope it's in a bottle, so I can put a few years of age on it in hopes of developing more depth and also mellowing it out.  TL;DR: Certainly buy it if you see it, but I wouldn't trade my cellar away or drive far too pick up a bottle/growler/case/what have you -- it's not the best in the style, in my opinion. Definitely ecstatic that I got a chance to try this beer though. Pretty freakin' marvelous.  (4.25/5)",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,DeFaz,4.35,2013 vintage. Midnight in color with a surprisingly small head.

1199,19960,dcmchew,4.4,"2015 vintage. Black pour, small half finger beige head, quick to a frothy string and a really thin film on top. Moderate lacing. The smell is pretty intense and brings up front exactly what you'd expect: dark, but also some milky chocolate, a lot of coffee powder on top, some Bourbon, caramel and vanilla, not too heavily roasted malts. At least not charred to a crisp. Alcohol doesn't show up yet, a bit of hop tends too, tho. An interesting, layered sip. Starts with a bit of dark fruit, washed with some clear Bourbon, a bit boozy at first, but it gets just warmer later on. There's a hint of brandy in there. Clear chocolate goodness follows, not the darkest kind, but really rich, with a touch of molasses, more caramel, oaky vanilla and some roasted grain. This nice, but moderate sweetness leads to a pretty contrasting finish, dominated by acidic black coffee, some bitter hop underneath, making up a dry feeling that goes well with the last bite of alcohol. Each new sip renews the Bourbon taste, making it more and more clear. Still, the alcohol becomes manageable and you're left with nice coffee bean, cocoa and light roast in the aftertaste. Medium body, with a smooth, slightly prickly carbonation, works quite well. A big bad imperial stout that's well worth the hype. Still, not the perfect monster that i was led to believe, so don't break your neck looking for it. A toe or two would suffice.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Glorious.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Bshaw22,4.68,This beer really does live up to the hype. I had this version on tap 2015. Coffe was very present. Bourbon was there with oak and bite. Enough to hit your throat.

1199,19960,infinitebruner,3.99,"2015 Vintage  April 12, 2015  12 oz bottle, snifter  A – Deep black, pours moderately thick, not quite viscous. Milk chocolate brown, bubbly foam of a couple millimeters, with low retention. Some legs remain.  S – Cold-pressed coffee, dark chocolate, bitter roasted malts, some oaty-sweet aromas. Some fruit, herbal hop aroma far in the background.  T – Coffee and sweet milk chocolate, light fruity and earthy notes. A bit of vanilla. High roasty bitterness and hop bitterness, lingers through the finish, and is huge on the aftertaste.  M – Low carbonation, and medium-full bodied. Some sweetness up front, but very, very bitter.  O – A big, rich barrel-aged stout with a lot of complexity. Right now seems very bitter, but I believe it will mellow out and fine tune with additional aging.  Note: I have had this several times in the past, and enjoyed a much richer, fuller, more balanced beer. As I said, I'm hoping this one will improve, but it is inferior to previous editions right now.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,BDub_1988,3.92,Overall very good but the hype for is beer is a little overboard. Wish the bourbon-vanilla flavors would be a little stronger; The cocoa flavors dominate this beer.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,byronic,4.12,"On draft and poured into a snifter, looks delicious and smells inviting. There are hints of cocoa and a nice dark roast along with some heavy barrel presence. Unfortunately after the hype and the appealing pour the disappointment started settling in. The flavour definitely backs up the smell along with a few other notes such as vanilla; however the barrel aging and alcohol presence is at best overwhelming. There is no subtlety as this is very much brute force. It very much diminished the enjoyment of this brew.  Revisited this brew from the bottle and rather fresh, six months of age. Much nicer all around especially in flavour and feel. Still found the coffee grounds to be a bit harsh and almost gritty, hoping that aspect will fade with time.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,MichaelNeelsen,4.19,"L: Drank off nitro tap in a pint glass. A PINT GLASS (which was a mistake, we were later told). Looks like Founders breakfast stout. Thick cappuccino head. Zero light penetration. A thinner beer than BCS or Abraxas. Not motor oil. Pours more like an Irish stout.  S: Chocolate covered espresso beans. Not too intense - I'd like to smell it more, but that could be my subjective lack of sense of smell.  T: Starts off like an Irish stout - little to nothing up front. After a second though, your mouth becomes an espresso shop. Wonderful, rich coffee taste. The finish is where the dark chocolate and vanilla make their stand. Beautiful aura, not the vanilla yogurt candy taste of BCS Vanilla Rye, more like a cloudy vanilla cutting through the coffee notes.  F: Nothing unique - it drinks like a high quality Founders breakfast stout (I drank off Nitro tap).  O: Doesnt deserve to be ranked above BCS as it is currently on BA's American Double Imperial Stout list, but if I forgive that transgression on the part of the critics, the beer is wonderful on its own merits. Really good, but don't kill yourself trying to find it - the rarity of this beer doesn't necessarily pay off in flavor.

Taste followed the nose very close with the exception that the chocolate was more pronounce and a slight syrupy vanilla taste was present . Alcoholic esters were present although very subtle for an 11.2% ABV brew. Finish was sharp. Overall: Very nice stout. definitely a sipper. Too bad I was only able to get one bottle from my supplier. I'd rather have this than BCBS. Founders should think about making this more readily available to folks. Good stuff!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The high ABV is present but nowhere near a presence you would expect of 11.2, just enough. The flavors other describe of coffee, chocolate and vanilla are superbly blended. The coffee flavor is most apparent, more of a smoky coffee flavor (note, I don't drink coffee) that hits the mouth in the front. Silky smooth mouthfeel, a tad heavy but not too much.

Many of these end up too boozey & hot for my taste, but KBS doesn't punch you in the face with the bourbon. It is a creamy beer, heavy but smooth, not too thick or cloying. A good amount of roasted coffee upfront, a little oak with the vanilla & bourbon coming in as support, with the faintest bit of cherry cola. My personal favorite bourbon aged beer.  Update for 2016: thinner than I remember from years past. Coffee is still dominant upfront, but I picked up a lot less of the vanilla / oak flavors, and more straight bourbon alchohol flavor.

1199,19960,titty_mcbitty,4.73,"Feb. 2019 bottle so about a year old.  A: This beer pours the expected pitch black color. It has a thin dark khaki head.  S: Very impressive! I get tons of coffee and chocolate notes in the aroma. Some vanilla and bourbon appear too.  T: Prominent flavors are light-roast coffee and sweet dark chocolate -- especially the chocolate. Vanilla makes an appearance. Very nice balance of bourbon coming through that's not overpowering and adds a nice touch to the coffee/chocolate. The balance of flavors is otherworldly. Alcohol is insanely well-hidden.  M: Medium-thick consistency, just enough carb to notice. Really it's almost perfect, but could be every so slightly thicker. This is the only aspect of this beer that I feel could improve, but only in the slightest.  O: Love it. Crazy crazy balance of flavors. Super chocolate/coffee forward which I love. And bourbon!

Aroma- Boozy sweetness, oak, chocolate, vanilla, and coffee.  Taste- The barrel is noticeable from the get go along oak and coffee bitterness. The booze sticks around for little but is never overwhelming. In this finish the coffee and barrel gives way to a creamy vanilla and chocolate sweetness.  Feel- Full bodied, low carbonation, creamy, and a perfect amount of malt sweetness.  Overall- Finally having the famed KBS and it is a great barrel aged stout. Great barrel presence, great coffee flavor, and a sweet creamy finish. Really some great flavors here, and great drinkability for high abv stout as well.

To be perfectly honest, I enjoy it more fresh (as I've also had aged varieties both on tap and from a bottle). The more it ages, the more alcohol / bourbon I taste. While some prefer this, I prefer the alcohol/bourbon taste to be present, yet more mild.  I would give the 'fresh' (if you can call a beer aged a around a year in bourbon barrels such a thing) KBS a rating of 4.75, while the aged KBS rates 4.25.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Beer poured black with a very nice tan head that is still hanging around and leaving some lacing behind.  Nose is dark chocolate, coffee, and soft whiskey barrel.  Taste is coffee, dark chocolate, light whiskey, light vanilla, and oak. I kind of get the pepper take that some folks have as a result of the flavor combination -it is lurking in the background and may become prevalent over time.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth.  Overall this brew goes up a notch or two compared to FBS. The barrels used lend a nice easy touch which is appreciated. Epic brew, I understand why the craft beer geeks chase this down after enjoying it today!  2016 Edition Enjoyed 8-4-17 - Definitely drinking a tad hot - 12.4 abv. Very flavorful (cocoa, roast, and bourbon) and good as ever.  2017 Edition Enjoyed 8-5-17 - this one clocks in at 11.8 abv - not as hot as last years. Nose is awesome, chocolate and bourbon. Flavor is chocolate, roasted malts and bourbon.  2018 edition Enjoyed 3-8-19 - this version is 12.3 abv bottled on 03.07.18 - been stored in the regular beer fridge all year as opposed to the wine coolers--definitely vibrant still with the chocolate, coffee, and bourbon in the nose and taste.

1199,19960,YeahRightt,4.5,"2015 KBS Bottled 3/05/2015 drank on 4/10/2015  Look: Pitch black like you just turned the lights out in a bright room, brunette head like Monica Lewinsky, decent lacing.  Smell: sweet, boozy scent takes the forefront, chocolate, spice, and very slight coffee linger in the back. Smells like it would smell if you snuck a jack and coke into your starbucks cup before you go to work, without the scent of shameful alcoholism.  Taste: Very bourbon forward, like the aftertaste left in your mouth after a sip straight from the bottle if you chased it with cold coffee (good cold coffee). Chocolate chills in the background and is forgotten until the brew warms a bit, which brings a bit more of a mocha character heightened by the malt. Heat from the bourbon isn't as present as its sweetness, which was alleviated by the beer getting a bit warmer.  Feel: Nice and velvety without being like a syrup. Perfect median between what you would expect from a stout and a bourbon, very pleasant but heavy if enjoyed with anything other than a dessert or by itself.  Overall: I try not to think of beers as products of their own hype, but hype as a product of a beer. That being said, this is a very good BA stout that deserves a lot of credit and deserves to be sought after. Perhaps it is overblown due to availability, but it is a mistake to discredit this beer or any in its same class due to its scarcity or popularity. It is extremely complex and well balanced and only improves as you sip. Highly recommend seeking out at least a couple bottles annually. Excellent.

Smell: A big wallop of coffee and chocolate greet the nose followed by a sweet vanilla aroma and beautiful bourbon that makes everything pop and meld into one of if not the best smelling beer I've had. Amazing. The dessert like sweet masks most of the booze.  Taste: Rich coffee and decadent chocolate greet the tongue that then turns either coffee or hoppy bitter that fades to a beautiful sweet vanilla bourbon with more rich coffee as it faded to a beautiful mixture of decadent chocolate, coffee, bourbon, and a dry oaky finish. Fantastic.  Mouthfeel: Rich and velvety on the tongue. Almost like a cushion of liquid decadence that is only interrupted by the bitter that brings it back down to the palate and a dry finish. The booze is only present on a slight warming on the back of the throat and chest.  Overall: Wow. This is my first crack at this beer and I must say it was worth the wait. It's so rich and complex with flavors popping in sync through the duration of the ride. The coffee is fantastic and I really enjoy the huge bright vanilla/bourbon mix that jumps out.

1199,19960,schoolboy,4.77,"Well this certainly is an amazing brew. It was recommended by a co-worker, and of course Save-On had some. It was pretty pricey, but for this quality ... a bargain.  The appearance is exceptionally fine, with tiny bubbles and deep crystal black. Those bubbles produce a sublime aroma of chocolate, coffee, bourbon, malts and alcohol. Once the bubbles stop, it is all alcohol.  The taste is a beautifully balanced mix of all those great ingredients - chocolate, coffee, bourbon, and a huge hoppy, malty stout. Perfectly balanced. The aftertaste is a lovely booze taste, but no burn. This is a dangerous brew.  This is so good I will need to check my notes of other brews to make sure I did not over-rate it. I will look very soon to see if there is any more at the store. Awesome.  PS 4-6-2018 I stand by my previous comments and (to a lesser degree) ratings. What I would like to amplify is the boozy sensation. Yes, you are drinking a malt beverage - a stout ale - but it is a very boozy high sensation. I've taken maybe five swigs and I feel pretty dangerous. I had three smaller brews earlier this afternoon and they did nothing. This one instantly puts me in an alcohol zone. Be careful!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,victorylow,4.2,"Honestly, this beer is overhyped and shouldn't garner the high score it currently has with BA but it could just be that this years batch (2015) just isn't as good as the original version.

It's one of the highly acclaimed beers that truly lives up to its reputation.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Jahjehwa,5,"2015, on tap and in bottle are both amazing (No hype required). I won't compare it to the other bourbon aged beers because it has its own unique way of doing things. To me the bourbon is present but it is more subtle and doesn't overwhelm the other flavors of chocolate and coffee. I do love the bourbon heavy beers as well, but KBS is much smoother and refined imo. Had a chance to meet Jeremy K. The brew master at a local seminar and local tapping. Smaller town in MN and was not crowded at all. Very laid back and humble about all his beers. I haven't rated a lot of good beers that I should have. I would say, don't pick a favorite. Also just because it's new and super rare and you got some, doesn't make it better or worse than those who have been perfecting their style and can make more of it.

1199,19960,BladesOfBarley,5,"For years, I've wanted to try this gem, and despite my best efforts, I was never able to snag even a single bottle; but alas, this year I succeeded! Thanks to my friend Jake, who works at Vineyard Liquors in Plano, IL I was able to score a bottle of this and Firestone Walker's Parabola (cue squeal of delight!), and safe to say, this beer not only met but FAR exceeded my expectations. However, it's hard to really describe this beer because of how harmonious the flavors, aromas and textures play together, alas, this being a beer 'review', I shall sum it up as best I can.  Midnight black, aromas of mellow bourbon and chocolate; vanilla, coffee, bourbon and chocolate dance playfully and beautiful upon the palette.  Maybe it's shock, but that's the best I can do right now! Some day, I would to trade / buy a bottle to sit on for a year.

Taste chocolate, sweet and vanilla upfront. More of coffee or espresso in the middle then ends with a bourbon oak and moderately boozy flavor in the back  Relatively thin mouth feel for a stout but still smooth at the same time  Overall a well rounded imperial stout that masks the high abv well. Thin for an imperial/breakfast stout. Bourbon really comes through.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,MacMalt,4.75,"Been waiting to try this for quite awhile. Poured into snifter. Perfect black, opaque color. Perfect head and lacing. The smell is predominately coffee and chocolate. Can smell the bourbon but it isn't overpowering. More highly carbonated than I expected. As to the taste, I expected more bourbon. It's an incredibly smooth blend of coffee, chocolate, and toffee with a somewhat bitter finish. It's also a lighter mouthfeel than I expected. Overall, this is a very fine stout but I can't justify the hype. I actually like Founders Imperial Stout better but that isn't a criticism of KBS. Perhaps my expectations were not reasonable given the difficulty in finding this stout. I'm going to age a couple of bottles and I might change this rating based upon the results.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,BigH75,4.98,Scored 6 of them at my local supermarket in Granville Ohio. Poured into a Founders snifter. Black as night with minimal brown head. First sniff is from the bourbon barrel but not overwhelming. Lighter smoother body than I anticipated but very nice. Chocolate with slight coffee on first taste. Bourbon flavor comes in at the end. Boozy but not crazy considering it is over 11%. Absolutely fantastic in all respects.  Plan is to age a couple of them and potentially trade with some of my friends in Boston if they can score some Heady when they go to Vermont but will be hard to resist them.  Btw. I love Founders Breakfast Stout to the point that I currently have a 1/4 barrel on tap at my house. This is a very different beer. Not just bourbon version.

M: Medium to the slightly full side  O: this years was the absolute best I've ever had. I have never really liked this beer because of the explosive heat from the bourbon and the watery mouthfeel.

Some bourbon barrel stouts make you forget that you're drinking a beer and force you to drink this lighter body bourbon with less burn (BCBS), and that's fine and all, but it isn't a beer. I'm drinking '15 KBS and I'm hit with the coffee up front, then it fades to sweet chocolate and vanilla notes at the end. It isn't as nearly as boozy as BCBS (though doesn't have as high alcohol % either). As per which is a better ""beer,"" 2014 BCBS or 2015 KBS, I'd say the KBS.

Look = 3.75 Pours a deep brown color into a pitch black in the glass with .5 fingers of brown head that fades to a slight ring, thin lace. Aroma = 4.75 Coffe notes hit me first. Then the bourbon alcohol smell takes over. Also notes of chocolate and vanilla come out as it warms. Nice, complex aroma. Taste = 4.5 I get a lot of coffee throughout the taste. Sweet chocolate notes build throughout the middle of the taste. Bourbon and alcohol come in on the backend and define the aftertaste. The finish has a mild bitterness to it also. Feel = 4.75 Thick and creamy with medium carbonation, more then expected for an aged stout. Feel is great on this one. Drinkability = 4.0 11.2% ABV. Drinkability is reduced a little by the bourbon burn and the bitterness, but overall very drinkable. Overall = 4.4375 Lives up to its reputation for sure.

Feel – Cream explodes in to large, heavy bubbles.  Overall – Is it worth the hype? No. Is it amazing? Yes. For a beginner BA drinker, this is the way to go.

Highly complex, intertwined flavors that can be individually identified, yet blend together. Not much carbonation, but I didn't feel like I needed or wanted more. A sipping beer, to be sure. Really a thing of beauty.  When I manage to convince the guy at the beer store that I am worthy, and he comes out of the back room with the KBS, I am very thankful.

T- vanilla and licorice candy in the front, chocolate and coffee hits you in the middle and it finishes with some bourbon and hop bite. Just wonderful  F- Mouthfeel is nice but much thinner than I would have expected. Definitely thinner than regular breakfast stout (not necessarily in a bad way) With that said, it is pretty silky.  O- Overall, by far the best bourbon aged beer I have ever had. The only word that describes it is wonderful. I have had BCBS from Goose Island, and everyone raves about that, but in my opinion, this is far better. BCBS is too heavy on the bourbon. This allows the bourbon to come through just enough to give it some oaky vanilla/bourbon accent that really enhances the experience. Well done Founders.

1199,19960,Sparty1224,4.58,"Serving: 12 oz. bottle poured into a Founder's taproom snifter. Bottled on 2/12/15, making this just over 1.5 months old.  A: Pours a nearly pitch-black color, with just a trace of mocha-colored head that swirls on the surface. A thinner body than Breakfast Stout or Imperial Stout. Some light does get through on the edges.  S: I get two things right off the bat, and that's coffee and bourbon. The coffee is a different roast that I'm used to in these beers, it's not a bright, fresh, fruity type of bean, but rather a darker, sumatra-type roast, almost espresso-like. The bourbon is very wet and fresh, and very present in the nose. Not a lot of chocolate here, but I do get some vanilla and plenty of oak from the barrel.  T: So already, this beer is way more bourbon-forward than the previous years. Lots of booze and whiskey up front and in the finish. Then there's the coffee, again a very dark, bitter roast. Some dark, bitter chocolates, vanilla, espresso, oak, char, tobacco.  M: Unfortunately, the beer slips up here. It's rather thin and watery for the style. Nowhere near that rich mouthfeel of Breakfast Stout or Imperial Stout. Given the increased bourbon presence this year, it's still not overly boozy and the alcohol is integrated well. Good amount of carbonation.  O: Ah... KBS. My first BA Imperial Stout. Takes me back to 2012. I've had this beer countless times, but my first time actually reviewing it. A lot has changed since my first impression, and I've had a lot of world-class beers since. Originally, this beer was always #1 for me, next to CBS. But over the years, I've slowly fallen away from it. Initially, I thought it was because I lived in GR and just took it for granted. But now I'm sadly realizing that it's just not this king of a beer anymore. First off, it doesn't really have an identity. It says coffee chocolate stout, but I really don't pick up on either of those in the nose or flavor. When I drink BCBCS, I get coffee, and it's amazing. Here, it's just a big, boozy imperial stout. Another fault is the mouthfeel. Way too thin and watery here. I don't remember it being this thin back in 2012, but over the years, it's gotten that way. I love Founder's and I really wanted to love this beer again and rate it highly, but I can't. BCBS and all the variants just blow this away. And that's hard for me to say since I recently moved from GR to Chicago, and I'm a homer and still love Michigan. But Goose Island just owns the style. CBS, on the other hand, is perfection, and this years re-release still holds up as one of my favorites. But KBS is just losing it's luster as other great BA Imperial Stouts move to the fore front. This beer is still a classic and always will be. Heck, it's aged in caves beneath Grand Rapids. But it's just not the best of the best anymore.  Recommendation: No matter what, everyone needs to try this beer. It's a classic and is the face of Founder's. Find it, drink it, love it. Just don't expect to get your face blown off.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,TheElectricOne,4.58,"Had two of 'em in a row on tap at the Avery in Providence. Both 10oz. pours and on a 2014 keg that was tapped five minutes before I drank.  Appearance: super dark, with little to no carbonation. Straight obsidian black with a minimal mocha colored head. No carbonation present.  Aroma: Couldn't help but audibly go MMMMMM as I smelled it. The nose is vanilla, caramel, roasted almond, coffee......everything an imperial stout should be, and pronounced.  Taste: First impressions; all chocolate, coffee and vanilla. Sweet, delicious, and decadent. Moves into a little bit of bourbony heat, but the alcohol is only slightly detectable, even at 11%. Finishes with more sweet, creamy dark chocolate and coffee.  Feel: Almost like a nitro in its velvety, creamy texture. At points, I was reminded of when I was a kid and would drink straight up chocolate syrup. Really, really awesome.  Overall: Lives up to the hype of being one of the best stouts out there. I love breakfast stout which is much more available, and the availability factor of this one makes it a rare treat, but it was really damn good.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,emptyglassagain,3.7,Ok but not great. I believe there are more enjoyable versions of the style out there. The flavor is there (yet both the coffee and chocolate/roastiness). The overall feel is fairly good too if not above for the style. However the overall hotness/booziness of the beer takes too much away from the good stuff for me. I get why others enjoy it and I usually like founders beers but think this one is overhyped imo. I wanted to like it but the alcohol warmth has been high in different versions I've had.

1199,19960,UrbanCaveman,3.68,"5 oz pour from tap into a pint glass.  Appearance: Your standard stout - very dark brown verging on black, with a khaki head with decent retention.  Smell: Coffee, chocolate, and bourbon wafts out of the glass, with some vanilla that I primarily attribute to the bourbon.  Taste: Dark roasted malt meets some bitter chocolate and a heaping helping of coffee, much like a dark French roast. Beneath all of that, faintly, there were some vestiges of bourbon flavor - a shadow of vanilla, maybe a whisper of oak.  Mouthfeel: Full and rich, as one would want from a stout.  Overall: Had I heard no hype about this beer going in, I'd have thought it was a solid beer, and would have rated it slightly below an ordinary, unbarreled Breakfast Stout. However, given the hype this beer receives, I'm left with the question of why. It's solid, it's good, and it has been matched and surpassed by many other stouts out there. If you can get it without serious effort or resources, it's worth trying. It's assuredly not worth standing in line for.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,imscotty,4.55,"Other have described this beer better than I ever could, so I will just offer the following comment.  Drink it fresh., do not age more than a year.  Did a vertical of aged KBS the other night, just to see what aging would do. The clear consensus was the fresher the better. One year of aging did no harm Beyond that you began to get more vanilla and soy flavors which I think detracted from the beer. The darker chocolate and fig flavors began to mellow and the beer lost some complexity.  So if you are lucky enough to grab a bottle, enjoy it now, or at least within the first year.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A vanilla bean or two.  M: Full body and soft carb leads to a creamy feel that takes the edge off the alcohol warmth which is present along with roast astringency.  T: Dark chocolate coated orange dusted with espresso. Sweet bourbon mash. The age of the btl has broken down the darker fruits into the ubiquitous port and tannins; the acidity counters the sweetness. Light oak and smoke, cherry cordial. Hints of clove and nutmeg spice.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Waited for a while in line for a fresh pour out of the tap but left as it was hours before I was getting in.

1199,19960,mitch3114,4.91,"Received 5 ounce pour at Saratoga City Tavern  A- very nice, dark, thick, decent cocoa head that was thicker and stuck around longer than I thought  S- I held on to this for awhile until I finished my other beer. I wanted it to warm up. The smell was fantastic; warm bourbon was there with some cocoa and vanilla  T- I hate coffee beers! But it was at the bar so I had to try it. I wasn't dissapointed! The coffee was very there but very subdued. It blended nicely with the other flavors. The same with the bourbon, often these fresh bourbon BA ales come off hot and boozy, bourbon forward but this was not the bourbon was sweet and complimented the brew nicely. Cocoa, mocha, vanilla, hint of coconut, dark roasted malts, very good  M- the mouthfeel was a bit thinner than I had imagined but it seemed to work with this beer. I think if it was thicker it would be too syrupy.  O- overall, i always did want to try this but never wanted to spend the time, energy and money to hunt it down in stores... Plus, as I mentioned I'm not a fan of coffee flavor d beers. This being offered at the bar was a perfect scenario for me. The beer was blended extremely well, yet it was so complex. There were so many flavors mixed in and none really stuck out or outshined the other. A very solid BA offering that is ready to drink. I wouldn't age this one. I think it would risk losing some of those great subtleties and undertones. Plus, I think with time some of the other flavors may fade bringing the bolder flavors forward, thus destroying that perfectly balanced liquid harmony that currently exists!!!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

You can smell dark roasted malts - almost burnt, strong espresso or dark italian coffee, hint of vanila with a slight aroma of bourbon. I do smell oak. It is thick in the mouth much the way it appears. Medium body though - would have thought it would be heavier. Tastes are all above with coffee underlying most of them. I tasted more dark chocolate and coffee than anything else. ABV is very well concealed. However, this beer has been so hyped to me it was doomed to disappoint. Hoping I just had a bad bottle. I will try it again. This particular bottle was above average but nothing outstanding. No Surly Darkness, 3 Brothers Resolute, etc. 4/16/15 update. Drank this year's version. Much the same.

Aroma of dark toasted malt with a hint of char, drip coffee, hints of vanilla and nuts; no notable bourbon. Flavor of toasted, charred malt, boiled down coffee, vanilla, bitter chocolate, hints of bourbon and oak. Malty to start, with coffee flavors developing to finish with the more light acidic flavor of coffee and oak. Nice medium to heavy bodied with light creaminess. A well made coffee stout with a good balance between the coffee and malt, with perhaps a bit more coffee than expected, but the fresh coffee flavors have faded in the barrel, which left surprisingly light bourbon flavors.

A: Bourbon right up front, toasted coconut, picking up some coffee, chocolate, roasted malt aromas. Smells really balanced, there's nothing that just out directly. Nice aroma.  T: Like the nose, bourbon, toasted coconut, coffee bitterness, chocolate sweetness, picking up a little vanilla, there is some alcohol burn on the back, bitter dry finish. Nice roasted malt flavors, no alcohol burn. Picked up some warming in my belly about halfway through the glass.  M: This is very creamy, smooth, dry finish.  O: I was not sure what to expect from this beer, it's different from other BA stouts I have tried, the bourbon is not big up front but the other flavors make up for it. It has a nice coffee, chocolate, vanilla bitter sweet flavor that I think makes this beer unique from other BA stouts, it almost seems as if this Founders Breakfast Stout barrel aged, even though it's not. I think it could use a little more bourbon presence but it's definitely a world class stout. If this was available every Spring in CA, I would definitely buy as much as possible.  Cellar check: just pulled a 2013 from my cellar, it has a great creamy smooth mouthfeel, hints of coffee and chocolate come through, bourbon is still there, taste amazing, surprisingly, still picking up some heat from the alcohol.

Aroma- Alcohol, coffee, chocolate with a hint of raspberry.  Taste – I’m thinking Ethel M. coffee liqueur chocolates. Very good chocolate flavor. Not a lot of the expected extreme roasted malt flavor and a little of the usual bitter aftertaste of a stout. Thick, sweet and slightly acidic. I like this. So this is obviously flavored and very drinkable but tastes like more alcohol than advertised. Great sipper. The more you sip it the more you taste the coffee (or the chocolate fades).

S: Bourbon, but not overwhelming like in Backwoods Bastard - I can smell this beer without getting sick. Detect vanilla from the oak and some bitter chocolate. Overall, not very complex - kind of disappointing.  T: Very bourbony - bourbon flavor completely coats the aftertaste. After a minute, however, the chocolate takes over somewhat, leaving an indelibly stouty taste on the tongue (you have to wait a moment after gulping, but it's there) However, I fail to see the hype over this beer.

Its not the darkest stout I have ever seen though.  Aroma: Chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and those wonderful malty stout aromas. This is abut as good as it gets on the nose.  Taste: Sweet, but not overly sweet, mouthfeel is thinner than I remember, but it is really well balanced. Compared to the BCBS I drank before reviewing this one this one had a much more solid mouth on it, not overly boozy either. The vanilla is definitely present and flavor profile blends perfectly well. Not as much coffee after this on had aged for I assume a year.

To be fair, there's been some variation year to year, but I don't know that's ever really risen above just another solid brew. At its best, it has a nice, creamy feel, to go with a chocolate/coffee palate, neither of which is overbearing. I actually appreciate the use of coffee in KBS, as I feel it doesn't go over the top with it. That said, the nose is generally weak, I struggle to get much barrel influence out of it, and, again, overall I just don't think it amounts to much more than a nice brew. Which isn't a bad thing. Reviews like this are a bit unfair, because they're sort of judging to a higher standard. That comes with the territory of being a hyped brew, though, and so I think it's fair to be a little more exacting here.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The beer poured with no head whatsoever and is inky, and I do mean inky, black. Totally opaque.  The nos e is pure black coffee with just a hint of some malty sweetness at the back.  The taste is VERY impressive. Incredibly silky and smooth. Up front is pure chocolate, silky, this slowly gives way to a hit of hoppy bitterness but then that fades quickly to a long slow coffee flavor on the palate as the taste subsides. Incredibly complicated multipart flavor profile. I would be curious to see how this compares to the fresh version, but this is most impressive.

No reason to age it. After ordering food and letting it warmed up I realized the great notes of bourbon, vanilla and coffee.

1199,19960,aleigator,4.04,"Bottles from Greg, thank you very much!  Pours an oily, almost complete black color, with nearly no head.  The nose is defined by creamy chocolate aromas, with loads of bitter ground coffee, accompanied by a wooden bourbon note, very well integrated into the body of the beer.  Begins with toffeish malts and a pungent bourbon bite , followed by a gentle wooden note and a supportive coffee infusion, accompanied by smooth, creamy milk chocolate. Vanilla provides a delicate peak to the foundation of the beer, which gets perfectly along with the sweeter, toffeish part of the brew, while also calming the alcohol burn. The coffee falls off soon, as we paired the '14 version next to the '12, developing in a very pleasant way above the sweeter notes, followed by a hint of Bourbon. The older version, while missing the coffee, blends the different flavor directions more carefully, adding many layers, which are related to each other to the taste, also the Bourbon is more recognizable. Finishes with wooden, sweeter malts, still extremely smooth on the palate, while the recent version adds a slick, well integrated coffee bitterness, among a sharp boozy echo.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Chris_Hager,3,"In my opinion, KBS is overrated. It tastes entirely like bourbon with no real detectable beer. I like the idea of bourbon-barrel aged beer, but the bourbon flavor should be more subtle and not overpower the beer completely. Don't get me wrong, I'd drink this over and over again from a shot glass. Quite heavy alcohol flavor as well. But for a beer? Nah. The funny thing is, for all the hype, when I admitted to the guy at work that gave me his last one that I didn't care too much for it, he confessed to not caring for it himself. Ditto for a few other beer buddies at work. I'm a huge fan of most of Founders' varieties. Their porters, stouts, IPAs, scotts and pales are all among my favorites. I'll probably try this again, because I'm not one to give up on something after one taste, but for now I'm not a fan.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

No. Its flavors are spot-on, but does the booze shine through, does the vanilla, do the flavors stand apart in a unique way? Somewhat, but not necessarily more so than many other BBA stouts.  Look, I love this beer. But not only is it a ""whale"", it's a ""unicorn"". Meaning, its rarity drives its hype more than its quality. If it were widely available, would it be a 100? Probably not.

1199,19960,dmgeng,5,"I didn't know that this was available outside of the brewery/surrounding area and some how there was a case in western Indiana.  A - Deep dark brown basically black but not as black as Ten Fidy. It pours beautifully with khaki head and nice lacing. One of the most beautiful beers I've ever seen.  S - Tons of of sweet stout smell with roasted, chocolate, caramel, toffee, vanilla, and some soft bourbon mingling in your nose. Probably the best stout I've ever smelled. It was extremely complex and amazing all in one snifter  T - The flavors culminate on your palate with malt, roast, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, bourbon, and some light coffee. There is some alcohol but it is the best representation of >10% ABV that I've ever had in that regard with the burn being smooth and not harsh. There is some bitterness from the roasted malt but the sweetness and smoothness of all the flavors whirling on the tongue make it simply sublime. It is like tasting the best bourbon ever made mixed with the best stout ever and being able to decipher every nuance of both. I believe that a beer with extreme complexity without muddling or having a disproportion of the flavors is the key to such a ""WORLD-CLASS"" Beer.  M - High mouth-feel with light carbonation. It isn't the thickest stout but it has just the right amount of stickiness and bitterness to make you want to take that next sip; until it's gone.  Overall, this is one of the best beers ever made (if not the best). So much flavor packed into every sip. This bourbon barrel stout is truly what great beer should aspire to. I'm sure that there are people without the palate to discern the menagerie of amazing flavors and would favor a more direct beer but I love this one.

1199,19960,SHDoyle,4.89,"Description: Deep black color with zero head and just a few, small brownish bubbles on the surface and some legs. An extremely (and pleasantly) strong aroma that can be smelled from a few feet away, the smell is as promised: bourbon, coffee, vanilla and cocoa in that order with some oak/wood especially as it warms. Flavor is coffee, then bourbon, then more coffee with some vanilla and cocoa on the finish. Complex and very well balanced, none of these flavors overpowers the others but instead they seem to be patient and subtle without being ignored. Feel is smooth with minimal carbonation. Might be a tad thinner and less velvety than expected but that doesn't take away from the beer at all.  Suggested food pairing: Medium rare prime rib  If you like this beer then you should also try: Bourbon Barrel Black Maple  Overall: 4.75 (This beer is excellent and I would definitely drink it again) Having already been reviewed a few thousand times there's not too much new or novel to say about this. It's worthy of its reputation and the hype surrounding it. Certainly a beer to seek out and cross off your list.

Appearance: Very dark. opaque and has a brilliant dark brown head to it. not a ton of carbonation coming off  Smell: Quite well balanced. The main players here are coffee and bourbon. there is a nice hint of chocolate  Taste: This is where having it on tap makes a huge difference. So it starts off with coffee and bourbon then transitions to a smooth chocolate with maybe a hint of vanilla. The end is quite smooth with more bourbon woody coffee and an almost creamy hint. a good amount of sweetness to deal with the bourbon and covers the alcohol which you cant taste at all. You can keep sipping on this all day long  Mouth feel: almost viscous and super pleasant. thick and creamy. hits the mouth and coats the tongue.

1199,19960,tmm313,5,"2016 - on draft, 5's across the board. The perfect Imperial Stout.  2013 review below - bottle 4.52 (aged 2.5 years )  A- Super black with virtually no head from aggressive pour. Still generates sticky lacing.  S- I think this may have been the first stout I ever smelled from a distance... I pushed the snifter away to take a pic and could smell it from two feet away. Chocolate, coffee, bourbon, dark cherry, and a touch of vanilla. There's also a subtle nuttiness that comes out toward the end. Bourbon grows more and more intense as it warms.  T- Surprisingly sweet up front with notes of cherry, chocolate, roasted malt, and wood characteristics. Middle brings out coffee and more chocolate with a big surge of bourbon. Finish is dry dark chocolate with a nice subtle burn. The flavors are huge. As balanced as balanced gets when on the cooler side, but bourbon becomes more dominant as it warms.  M- Lightly viscous. Creamy and drying.  O- Cheers to my old beer guy, Drew, for landing this for me. I would've never had it, otherwise. What I'll remember most about KBS is the supreme balance between such huge flavors. I don't think I would go out of my way to buy again, but I can definitely see why it is so hyped.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,REVZEB,4.69,"Such a rich viscosity to this beer. The feel is warm and thick, serving to help wrap the palate in the flavors of bourbon, coffee, vanilla, chocolate, molasses, wood, and malt. Smell has a nice roasted character but more or less the same as taste but not as deep. Year after year this is a favorite of mine, just an amazing ba stout that is timeless.  Aging Note: Gets better with age. My go to aged stout Aging Note 2: The above statement is true for a year or two. Accidentally aged some beyond and there was decline in year 3 but drinkable, and year 4 is bad. Not shocking as a coffee stout but thought I would share",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,BigRedDog,4.61,"Pours a black as night color. Mocha colored head that doesn't stick around too long. Decent sized ring around the edge. Great lacing.  Smell is of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, marshmallows, oak, and bourbon. In short: holy crap. This is awesome.  Taste begins with coffee. Mellows into a bitter chocolate with lots of vanilla. Finishes with booze and oak. The coffee, chocolate and a bourbon flavor lingers long after the finish.  Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. It's like a liquid bourbon marshmallow.  Overall this beer is simply amazing.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,M_chav,4.43,"1"" foamy head layers a pity black/motor oil pour. Smells so enticing, full of chocolate and barrel. Wood soaked bourbon. Taste is on point, very good. It's hard to complain about a beer this good but it's slightly hot, maybe a few years in the bottle would do this beer good. Soft yet full chocolate bourbon feel and overall an outstanding beer",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Tsar_Riga,4.31,"A - Pours up inky black, completely opaque. A slight bit of brownish tan head, really just a trace, but what pours does not fade.  S - Sweet bourbon odor, laced with a slight alcohol sting. Reminds me of of the bourbon balls my mother taught me to make when I was a wee one. Hints of vanilla, a touch of chocolate and roasted coffee, with a buttery note coming in from the oak.  T - Delivers on the nose, but more subtly. The sweetness is balanced off the more bitter line from the coffee, which comes forward mid-palate. Bittersweet chocolate notes as well, but these fade toward the end, with the close primarily suggesting spiked black coffee. The bourbon permeates everything, linking with the high ABV to suggest some form of stout-spirit hybrid.  M - Slick and full, with significant warming from the alcohol. This one does not put its ABV behind a curtain - it is out front.  O - Nothing can meet the hype, but this is still an outstanding beer that deserves recognition for its power and carefully crafted combination of bourbon and stout. If the hype cools off some day, I'd buy it, but I doubt I'd wait around in line to get a 2 bottle allotment again.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Hop-Droppen-Roll,4.53,"CreepinJeeper sent this one over to me, just 'cause he's a nice guy. He also threw in a BCBCS, can you believe that? I had to go out and buy a snifter. This one's been covered to no end so I'll keep this short.  This beer is DARK! Smells that way too. I'm surprised at the bitterness, but I feel like I shouldn't be... beer + coffee + bourbon... I knew what I was getting myself into. I've had BBA stouts, and I've had Coffee stouts - but I almost wonder if this isn't too much for me - maybe I'm not worthy, but I don't think I've ever had a DIPA that struck me as this bitter. I certainly need to take my time with it, and that's just fine, I have work to do (I'm not going to get much of it done). The flavor here is BIG, very complex. The alcohol hangs out in the liner notes, but makes itself known. Warm, that would be my one word descriptor. Should have saved it for winter, but that's so far away, and I just bought a snifter.  In closing, this is like a cascade of whiskey barrels rolling down the back of my throat while coffeed-up Mario jumps over them to ascend the esophagus and strangle my tongue .

1199,19960,frenchblood21,4.51,"Poured from bottle into KBS goblet. This is the 2014 edition of KBS. Date of review is 7/15/14.  Appearance- Black as night with a brown head that disappears almost instantly. Very little carbonation but the lacing looks great so far.  Smell- Roasted malt, coffee and chocolate in that order. Vanilla comes through at the end. There is a complete lack of bourbon, which is strange considering this beer spent over a year in bourbon barrels.  Taste- There's the bourbon! In order of dominance, I get bourbon, vanilla, chocolate and then finally, coffee. Flavors remind me of an Oreo dipped in coffee with cream and vanilla sugar. So awesome.  Mouthfeel- Super thick and creamy. Has the mouthfeel of a milk stout. You get all the flavors at once, and then somehow all by themselves.  Overall- Fantastic offering from the best brewery in Michigan.

Aroma has warming bourbon, caramel, sweet malts, slight butterscotch but also a weird dirty rag note that I get with some sniffs.

What better way to relax than to finally, FINALLY pouring this beer drinker's first bottle of KBS. It's been a while in waiting (not really), but is it worth it? Oh yes.  Not sure of the bottling date, but it picked it up around... April of 2014? Around that time o' year. It was poured from a cold 12 oz. bottle into a goblet. Surprisingly, there was no head, and any possible evidence of it was this very light and tan. But the beer... Oh man, is it dark as night! The sun itself couldn't penetrate this beauty; my favorite color when it comes to dark beers.  The smell on this is pretty nice. Mmm... That bourbon, melting into dark chocolate and fresh coffee bean, straight outta the roaster. I'm not too sure if my nose picks anything else up. Maybe cherries? Who knows? I don't. I'm just excited for the sip...  And boy, is it glorious. Rarely do I close my eyes after taking a sip of beer, to try and prolong that flavor and feel. What happens first? The instantaneous cold brew warming my throat and body, or the delicious chocolaty coffee that leaves my breath warm of whiskey drinking? I seriously wish I could cover this in ice cream (doesn't matter which kind. Vanilla, rocky road, chocolate chip cookie dough...) and still have some to drink. Or perhaps i could drink this in a manly cave of yore called a den, next to a fireplace, wearing a leisure robe and holding a pipe with fine Cavendish tobacco in my other hand. Much to my enjoyment, it gets better as warms up a bit. Anyways...  The feel of it in my mouth, it is sticky, but not so in an intrusive way, but in such a sort that I wish to continue tasting this bitter chocolate flavor in my mouth. Exquisite. Makes me want to have another sip.  Overall, (as you can tell) I find this beer to be phenomenal. Too bad it is limited, or else I'd easily pay $8 per bottle of this year around. Alas, 'tis not to be. I highly recommend this stout and that you must purchase a bottle, when or IF you can find it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Mouthfeel is thick and it really coats the mouth. Syrupy even, but in a good way.  Overall just a great beer, get it if you can.

The thing is I don't think they are using the store brand coffee, vanilla, and chocolate. The ingredients all taste wonderful and blend together to make the spectacular concoction that is KBS. It's one of those few stouts that every sip taste different than the one before thanks to all of the layers of flavors this beer gives to us.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

It smells great. Bourbon really sticks out but has a great alcohol smell.  T - Fantastic! The balance of bourbon, chocolate and coffee is perfect. The bourbon is not overpowering like other BA stouts I've had. It melds perfectly with the chocolate and finishes with a slight bitter hop bite which just works.  M - Perfect. So smooth, it coats the tongue and goes down so easy. Carbonation is just right for a stout, understated as not to get in the way of the flavors.  O - This is my new favorite stout. Definitely the best stout I've had in a a bottle. I'm ready to trade for some more KBS.  Update 3/13/19 - I realize now that when I originally wrote this review I knew very little about BA Stouts and the hype of KBS at the time inflated my ratings.

Dark brown/black with a tan head about three fingers thick. The nose is molasses, chocolate, and roasted coffee, but the molasses is the highlight. The taste is slightly sweet. There is a good balance of hops and roasted barley. The alcohol is there and you feel it after one.

1199,19960,blackcompg,3.93,"I've read so much about this beer, and acquired a bottle 2 years ago. I've been patient long enough. Bottled on 2/17/12, here we go...  Appearance - Pouring directly into the center of a large snifter yields a finger of rich brown cinnamon foam, having almost a creamy appearance. This quickly comes down to a broken cap. The body is a viscous opaque black - no highlights on the sides. This brew is deep and dark. *Letting this breathe for a few minutes really brings out the coffee and chocolate in the nose.  Smell - The nose starts with dark ripe fruits, molasses, rich roasted malt, moist oak, a quick blast of dark semi-sweet chocolate, faint coffee and vanilla bean, and a whiff of bourbon well up into the sinuses.  Taste - I'm a bit surprised here honestly. Even after 2 years, this beer is still somewhat bourbon forward. Let m break this down... Starts with bourbon, but not over powerfully so. Immediately there is roasted malt, and the oak is right there with it, a slightly bitter vanilla extract is there, and a light ribbon of dark chocolate. I'm getting a little dark fruit, but also some slightly sour plum skin. I then get a little black coffee and bitter coffee grounds, and then at the finish the hop characters begin to show - a bit of dried grass and slight dried grapefruit pith. Long into the finish the lingering flavors are dried oak, lingering roast and coffee grounds, and a little warmth from the bourbon.  Mouthfeel - I'm really surprised here - FBS is rich and mouthcoating. KBS is definitely a medium mouthfeel, not heavy at all, almost slightly watery for such a big aged beer. Carb is definitely on the lighter side, and is smooth across the tongue, with some prickle along the sides and the back. It is silky smooth, and a very easy sipper - but I feel that the lighter weight accentuates the bitterness and the bourbon.  Overall - To each his own, but I'm truly not impressed. FBS is head and shoulders above this beer, and this isn't in the same universe as BCBS, which I rated last night - it got all 5's. This is a good solid beer, don't get me wrong. And with all the discussions and history of this beer, you MUST try it. But in my humble opinion, this is above average at best. The flavors are good here, but not bold enough. The bitter and the bourbon carry the day. The nose on this beer is incredible, I will give it a 5 - but this does not carry over into the taste. And the mouthfeel I felt was somewhat lacking - almost watery. But this is just my personal rating. There are those that preach this as the gospel beers. As for me, I am not a believer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,MasterfulIdiot,4.56,"Served in an Ikea snifter. The liquid is a viscous dark mahogany pouring out of the bottle, and almost pitch black in the glass. The pour kicks up a one-finger cafe-au-lait-colored head that fades after a few seconds, but leaves a few tendrils of lace.  Aroma comes out at you from the pour alone - chocolate, lightly roasted coffee, and a wonderful silky-vanilla bourbon character with just a hint of an alcohol burn. Bourbon is present, but not overpowering. Absolutely delicious smell!  Flavor follows the nose, but with a more pronounced bourbon flavor. Lots of milk chocolate, vanilla, oak, coffee, and bourbon mingling around perfectly. Alcohol heat is just a slight prickle on the finish, which is perfect. Ratios of the flavors are well-balanced - none ever overpowers the other. Lots of nice roasty flavors without any roasty bitterness. The only thing I can say is that I wish there was a more pronounced coffee flavor, because the coffee kind of falls flat on the palate. Still, the other flavors are good enough to make up for it.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, with a fair amount of carbonation... maybe a bit too much for my taste. Thanks to roostor07 for the bottle!

Aroma is beautiful - the tell-tale Kentucky bourbon followed by chocolate and roast malt. Taste is phenomenal. The bourbon is there and is unmistakably Kentucky mash. An additional complex range of flavors pass over the tongue - chocolate, cherries, hints of dried fruit, roast, wood. This is an amazing beer.

1199,19960,Halfbrother83,4.5,"Poured from a bottle into a Pipeworks snifter.  A: Pours a deep black with a slight khaki head that fades quickly.  S: Sweet, mellow bourbon, some coffee, mild milk chocolate. Intoxicating.  T: Mellow chocolate, coffee, roasted malt. The bourbon makes itself present in the finish with a slight burn down the throat and a lingering presence in the mouth after swallowing. Pretty complex.  M: Very smooth, almost no carbonation. Of most interest, though the alcohol and bourbon characteristics make themselves known in the taste, there is almost no alcohol presence in the overall mouthfeel, lending to the smoothness of this beer. The mouthfeel is what, I feel, really separates this beer from others BA stouts.  O: Is there some overhyping of this beer? Sure. Are all of the detractors correct? Absolutely not. This one is complex enough to reveal itself in different ways to different palates; to me, it's not as enjoyably complex as, say, BCBS. I'm not sure this belongs in the top 10 on BA, but it's definitely not outside of the top 20.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,seedyone,4.66,"03/19 From bottle at home. Purchased 2 at Milk & Hops who are limiting purchase to 3 per customer. A few days later I see it stacked to rafters at my local Whole Foods (who have reduced their beer section by 75%), Still pretty pricey & extremely disappointing. This bottle, was way too ""hot"", almost uncomfortably so. Taste was ""woody"" like the aging had not taken place. Very disappointing. Could it be just this bottle? If so WTF has happened? Will return here to BA to compare the other bottle, but I'm not holding my breath, because I'm holding my nose. Goes to show, one should be careful what you wish for. A few years ago I was wishing for greater availability, but little did I realize there might be a cost. As they say, more is not necessarily better & yes, you can have too much of a good thing. I'll be looking for it on tap, buts that's like finding hens teeth. :^(  02/17 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. It's been a while so I figured I'd revise. These gals/guys have tamed the burn like forest rangers without damaging the wilds herein. This is one kick ass glass full. The hint of coconut is there but extremely subtle. There's coffee, licorice & a sidekick share of chocolate. All of which adds up to a treat that's worth the annual wait. I'll withhold ""superb"" but surrender to superlative without a hint of duress. An enduring treasure.  08/15 Scored, with help, a couple of bottles of the 2014. This has definitely mellowed. Lux on the taste buds is still elegant, but the burn has been extinguished. Therefore I'm upping the scores to reflect the newer superlatives.  04/14 - Later that week I was able sit & indulge & an indulgence is what this is.  My attempt to put into words what I smelled & tasted can not do it justice. Superlative after superlative will not convey the message. As long as you realize there will be an alcohol 'burn' on the first sip (as with just about every bourbon barrel aged quaff) & stick with it, you will be rewarded.  I've been around the block & resent the type of hype that goes on around these ""roll-out"" events, but I begrudgingly admit this is worth going out of your way for.  Even being over charged by a shady bartender when it came time for settling up, did not spoil the experience. I was in such a good mood that I didn't set the turd on fire, I just flamed him on YELP.  04/02/14 On tap. Just a taste as I was too late by 5 min. Keg lasted 65 min. Nice enough.

1199,19960,RutgersEng,4.24,"Poured from a 12oz bottle with unknown date. I have to thank Dan for supplying this bottle on my retirement after 40 years.  Poured black with almost no head, but plenty of lacing on the side of the glass.  The smell is of toasted almonds, vanilla and bourbon and very much like most barrel aged stouts. I have been looking for KBS for more than 3 years. It doesn't usually make it out to the west coast. I was very glad to finally get to try this.  The taste follows the nose with some coffee, burnt almonds, vanilla and bourbon notes. I do like coffee stouts and glad that this was done very well. Although the coffee was forward and the burn in the back of the throat testified to the barrel treatment. It was a little more rough than I expected for a refined barrel aged stout. It may need more aging and I don't know what year this bottle was from. When compared to BCBS or King Henry it didn't seem to measure up. I think it is more closely related to barrel aged Victory at Sea or perhaps Black Xantus. I found the date and it is from 12/12, therefore it has rested for 2 years in the bottle/cellar. With that knowledge, I am going to have to reduce the rating a bit as it has rested 1 1/2 years in the bottle. When compared to other 2 year aged coffee stouts it is in the middle of the pack.  Overall it is a very good coffee stout, and I enjoyed every last ounce of it. But it left me wanting for more refinement that perhaps longer aging will help. The coffee is noticabley similar to Black Xantus, but Black Xantus gets really really good after two years of cellaring and perhaps this would also. I'm glad that I could have a chance to drink and rate it. After letting it warm it does improve and becomes more blended and refined.

A caramel colored head sits atop of this for a bit.  Smell: Chocolate? Check! Coffee? Check! Bourbon? CHECK CHECK CHECK! Some vanilla hints to the aroma, as well. This smells heavenly.  Taste: It kinda tastes like a bourbon-infused mocha. Just the right balance of chocolate, coffee, vanilla... and booze. Honestly, this is right up there with BCBS in my book. Whereas BCBS is a little more complex in its flavor profile, this has a certain ""rough around the edges"" hit to it that makes it stand out in a different way.  Mouthfeel: Goes down smooth.

1199,19960,Jmamay22,4.45,"Glad to finally get ahold of a bottle. Looking forward to trying it and found a nice cool evening even in June to enjoy.  The beer pours a very dark and truly opaque black. Not even the slightest hint of ruby or brown along the edges of the glass to let in the light. The mocha colored head briefly fights to maintain its height, but eventually falls to a foamy collar.  The scent is wonderful and complex. Slight char from the oak barrels and a nice roasted scent without being overwhelming. Nice hints of vanilla and maybe even a touch of allspice. A bit of dark sugar and treacle to round things out.  The flavor is not an overpowering onslaught I had anticipated. No doubt it's a big beer, but it's a nice complexity rather than a strong punch of flavor. The vanilla comes through nicely giving a sweet impression. This fades to the dark sugar and roasted flavors. The oak and bourbon inter plays nicely rather than feeling layered on as can sometimes be the case. Finishes with a slightly bitter roasted bight, but still comes off as silky smooth. No astringency. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy.  Overall a fantastic brew. Wish it was more readily available, but the long aging time must make it difficult to distribute to a wide audience.

Notes of vanilla and cotton candy are found spots and offset by a punch of fusel alcohol and an earthy bitterness at the end. Exceptionally complex but relatively smooth. Heavy but never bottoms out. Drips a little viscous at times.  When it comes to any certain style, a jaded beer drinker is many times tempted to say if you've had one you've had em' all.

1199,19960,boudeysbigbrew,4.36,"Received 8 of these bad boys in a trade with user PeteGuento!  Appearance - Gentle pour with practically no head save for a tiny darkened brown circle. Lacing is minimal for the most part. Color is pure black with zero transparency.  Smell - In one word: delicious. Noticeably aged in bourbon barrels, with some sweetness clearly present. Smell of coffee beans comes through nicely.  Taste - Hints of vanilla I had not expected, which is something I've always loved in beer. Aftertaste is full of molasses and dark brown sugars. As it warms the bourbon's presence becomes noticeably more apparent.  Mouthfeel - great thickness with a bourbon aftertaste.  Overall - Though this is only my second KBS, it is certainly turning up to be my favorite RIS along with the Parabola. It completely lived up to the hype for me and cant wait to get to the remaining 6 I have left in my cellar!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,highdesertdrinker,4.65,"I poured the beer into my FW tulip glass, glug, glug, glug, it pours out like motor oil, black as coal with a sheen of light brown on top. The smell is slight barrel, some chocolate and coffee. Good, but a little muted. The taste is marvelous, roasty, very roasty to give it sort of a rough around the edges edges flavor, vanilla, chocolate, and coffee all blended seamlessly and in near equal parts. The alcohol is almost unnoticeable. What a smooth, easy drinker for a big stout. The mouthfeel is medium which only adds to the drinkability. Low carbonation, it's tough to drink this slowly.  In closing, I gotta say that I really like this beer! It reminds me of Parabola, but maybe a little rougher around the edges with it's roastiness, and not as much barrel presence. Super easy to drink for a big beer, and the 11.2 ABV is expertly hidden and just the right amount IMO. I will buy this every chance I get!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,kevobutler,3.72,"acquired this bottle in a trade in order to see what it is all about. Loved Founders original breakfast stout, so I looked forward to trying this one as well. Pours and looks like every other imperial stout out there. smells very strongly of bourbon, oak, faintly of chocolate. tastes like a booze bomb...almost like they just added straight bourbon to it at bottling time, I don't get much chocolate or coffee flavor from it at all... overwhelmed by the bourbon and oak. The mouthfeel is a bit thin compared to many other examples, alcohol burn, carbonation is at an acceptable level.  My overall impression is that this is a good imperial stout, but lacks balance. I found it to be over the top as far as bourbon character is concerned and there is a very noticeable alcohol burn.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Spiffaz,4.59,"Appearance - Color is jet black. Reminds me somewhat of The Abyss, solid and beyond murky. Pours dark and heavy, like it's literally a heavy liquid. Some dark foam on top after the pour, little/no lace that fades quickly.  Smell - The only thing not extremely impressive; smells like it tastes, the alcohol smell might get in the way a bit.  Taste = My favorite part of the beer - it tastes exactly as advertized! The coffee and chocolate come through very nicely, but most of all the bourbon barrel is right there over everything. Tastes higher than the 11.2 ABV (to me at least), reminds me of Dogfish Head's WWS. The back-note lasts for days, and I bet this would age superbly.  TL; DR - Very dark roasted coffee, alcohol on the exhale, smooth.  Mouth feel - Different than most stouts. Almost silky, like the water they use in float sessions. Very warming.  Overall - Excellent beer, deserves the praise. I want to age some and see how they are in a year or two. Pairs great w eggs and sausage!  Yay beer!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,cjgiant,4.51,"Can't say much that others haven't said. Had this at Extreme Beerfest in March for first time, first tap I headed for. Didn't disappoint. For this review, I must say the second time wasn't as good as the first, and I attribute that to the experience of the first time and the failure of memory.  So, this beer is quite well balanced, sweet stout, bourbon, and bitterness. On this day, the bourbon seemed to play a slightly larger role than I recall. The beer also just seemed slightly thin in body. And as usual, letting the beer come to temp helps a lot. I think I still prefer BCBS and I need to re-review Ten Fidy, but this deserves it's place near the top.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Head retains caramel color and foaminess relatively well. Smell is intoxicating to me..deep dark chocolate, cigar, light molasses or brown sugar, coffee. Flavor follows the nose...dark chocolate malt and cream. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy...you really get the chocolate taste in the aftertaste which is extremely pleasant. Reminds me of an old school Italian pastry dipped in dark chocolate..very concentrated. Overall I must say I am impressed.

1199,19960,EveningCordial,4.85,"Bottle poured into snifter.  A- Dark black. Thin brown head with only a little lacing. Not much carbonation. Served on the warm side from this bar, which I thought was the proper way to taste something of this nature.  S- Mocha and other dark chocalates, fresh ground coffee, vanilla, syrup, and oak. The bourbon is also very present and goes well with the mix of toasted and charred malts and barley.  T- Great BA stout. The bourbon definately stood out first for me. Followed by the rich chocolates and coffee. Much like the smell, the vanilla and oak are also present in the taste. A touch of leather, molasses and caramel as well.  M- On the full side of the spectrum for sure. This is a mouthful, as it should be when you have something of this caliber. Creamy, smooth, and a little on the sticky side.  O- Such a treat KBS is. It was overly impressing. The fact that these are always special released and harder to come by, make it that much more of a treat when you land them. I will revisit these as often as possible. Great job as usual by Founders.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Finishes off with a dark chocolate and coffee taste, with a hint of the vanilla lingering. Long aftertaste.  O: This beer makes me happy and surprises me with every taste. It's the best bourbon barrel aged beer I've tried, without adding an overwhelming bourbon flavor but still infusing the beer with sweet and complex whiskey notes.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ThisWangsChung,3.9,"Thanks to Shroud0fdoom for hooking me up with this one! 12 oz bottle into a Chimay goblet.  A: Pours a pitch black color. The head is a bit less than a finger high, with a khaki shade. As expected, retention isn't great. Minimal lacing is left on the glass.  S: Wow, this is almost a dark chocolate bomb. But note the almost - it's the underlyling, subtle notes that turn this into a winner. Bourbon, black coffee, vanilla, oak, and bourbon are all soft yet expressive. And did I mention how great the chocolaty tones smell? The nose could be a bit beefier, but damnit I'm still impressed with its aroma.  T: At first, I'm getting nice chocolate flavors, which build into a bourbon-laden middle. On the finish, I'm getting gentle coffee, roast, and vanilla. The alcohol notes also seemingly shift from bourbon to Irish cream in a way. Still, it's never too alcoholic or harsh (really, the bourbon and oak notes are subdued in the best way). I'm enjoying this a lot...but there's something missing. The more I sip it, the more it hits me: the flavors are a bit muddled. Don't get me wrong, it has great complexity, it's just the individual notes are a bit undefined. It's a bit difficult to discern the chocolate/coffee/vanilla/roast notes from one another. Otherwise, this is still a VERY good brew.  M: Generally, the feel is soft and creamy, but a combination of decent carbonation (for the style) and mild alcohol bite the palate a bit. The bite is never harsh, though. Like many BA beers, it's a bit on the thin side (by no means is it insubstantial, however). A very pleasant sipper that isn't overly sweet.  O: Hmmm. I like this - a lot actually - but I'm honestly not blown away. I think my expectations were too stratospheric for this one. After having the ""Big 3"" of barrel-aged imperial stouts (this, Parabola, and BCBS), I'd put BCBS 1st, Parabola 2nd, and this one 3rd. But to dismiss this beer entirely would be folly: it's more (dare I say) 'elegant' than the other two, every bit as complex, and well balanced with a delicate bourbon character. Like I said, it's just not extremely exciting: BCBS is over-the-top in the best way possible, and Parabola - despite its incredible harshness - is loaded with a metric ton worth of twists and turns. This just seems a little muddled and unexciting in comparison. I'd definitely drink this again. I'd still buy this again if I got so lucky. But I wouldn't chase trucks just to get my hands on this again.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,timfc,4.62,"This is a really amazing beer. It has almost everything I look for in a RIS, the one critique that I'd offer; the bourbon is just a bit too hot when the beer is cold. I love the vanilla and tannins that come through, and, as it comes up to temp (or, as I've had half a glass, hm, maybe both?), I can get more of the malt and sweetness as well as more hop-bitterness to balance it out.  I'd call 55 the perfect temp for this beer, and, should I find a place pouring at 55... I'll be happy to sit drink until they cut me off.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smell is not too intense, and has only light hints to bourbon. Smell is pretty balanced.  T. Oh boy. Sweet malts with lots of vanilla, bourbon and oak up front. Then it gets more bitter with dark chocolate, and roasty malts. Finishes quite bitter, and lasts pretty long. Slow sipper. The bourbon really adds it's value without getting to hot as in BCBS. Perfectly balanced in every way, not to extreme or complex. Very, very good.  M. Very thick and creamy body which suits the beer / style perfectly. Perfect level of carbonation for a stout (thus only a bit of it). Matches perfectly with taste.  O. A perfectly balanced bourbon barrel aged stout. Has everything I like about these beers. I'm a fan of their breakfast stout and imperial stout as well, and I think this really fits in their line of stouts. It is ranked very high although I often see it critized on the forums.

Bourbony aftertaste.  m; Full. Just right for a stout, although I always long for something even meatier, impractical as it might be to actually try to drink.  o: An amazing flavored stout, hits all the right notes, although the coffee is rather predictably overpowered by the extended bourbon barrel aging.

The taste of dark malts, chocolate, coffee and the barrel are impressive. The mouthfeel is smooth. For me there is some rawness to this brew, maybe because I love bourbon and it is a unique taste.

A wonderful, enticing, rich, strong aroma profile, that is amazingly executed and extremely appealing. Flavor begins with a rich hit of roasted black coffee, mingled with some dark cocoa and roast malt flavors and hints of bittersweet chocolate, moving into more abundant flavors of rich bittersweet and dark chocolate, cocoa and now notes of bourbon and alcohol, alongside some oak and vanilla. Finish is heavy on oak, bourbon and alcohol flavors, with roasted coffee and cocoa notes present as well. Aftertaste is roasted coffee, cocoa powder, bourbon, alcohol and notes of oak. An amazing flavor profile that is rich, bold and wonderfully balanced between coffee, cocoa, chocolate and bourbon flavors. Simply fantastic.

Recedes quickly leaving some moderate lacing on the sides.  Aroma is typical of BBA beers, but KBS always has that distinct difference. Very well defined aromas of roasted, bordering on burnt coffee and chocolate. Vanilla, and especially oak, seem to be more prevalent this release. Bourbon is there, but not as strong as you'd expect. Subtle dark fruits, fig, cherry, and prune. It's all the good aromas of a dark, heavy beer, melded into one. Excellent.  Taste of dark, burnt coffee. Dark and milk chocolate. Melts in your mouth, warms the tongue. Incredible. Taste is not as complex as the nose was, but the flavors it contains are executed perfectly. A little bit of bite/warmth on the back end. Bourbon lingers deliciously on the tongue on the aftertaste, leaving a coat of dark coffee, dark chocolate, and booze on the tongue.  Insanely drinkable at this percentage. I could down three of these before realizing I was gone. Medium bodied with low carbonation.  As I recall, this is an improvement over the last two releases. Haven't had anything prior to 2015.

1199,19960,TheSixthRing,4.18,"Appearance - Pours near black with cola brown edging and a quarter finger's worth of dark tan head. Sub-par retention leads to a surface near barren of suds, sans the thin ring around the edge of the glass. Small, spotty lacing with little stick. About on par for the style.  Smell - Deep coffee aroma highlighted by chocolate fudge notes. Lesser notes of bourbon and oak which strengthen as the brew warms.  Taste - Follows the nose. Coffee at the forefront, along with some fudge chocolate and lesser vanilla notes. Bourbon booze character becomes prevalent as the beer warms. Touches of oak. A bit thin in the finish with some light alcohol burn.  Mouthfeel - Medium in body, with tingly carbonation. Despite the heat, this thing drinks stupid smooth. Thins out, with a drying finish.  Overall - Maybe not as flavorful as the Firestone's Parabola, but probably more approachable. Great beer, though I can't help thinking I'd rather have a Founders Imperial Stout in it's stead. The more I drink, the more I realize these BA stouts just don't quite do it for me.

1199,19960,HoppySeb,4.68,"Poured from 12oz. bottle kept overnight in fridge to a KBS snifter. Its appearance is a stout lover’s dream – pours the darkest black with an apparent thickness in its body that you know to fit this style well. Halfway through the pour, thousands of bubbles start a carbonated explosion that culminates in the birth of a heavy, two inch tall head that looks like the crema in a finely crafted espresso – aromas of chocolate and bourbon invade the air around the glass as the head forms. Ultimately the short-lived foamy head sinks into the absorbing darkness of the beer below, leaving an elegant ring to remind you of its once majestic existence.  Its aromas boast dark dried fruit that brink back plum & rum-soaked raisins, medium roast espresso coffee (although not as much as expected), chocolate ice cream , sweet bourbon, molasses with faint notes of oak. Upon taking the first few sips my immediate impression is obvious, KBS’ taste mimics its aroma. After savoring the first few sips and soaking my palate I can tell that its taste stronger in the coffee & chocolate than its nose, the coffee tasting more dark roast and the chocolate tasting like cacao. There are also vanilla notes which complement its coffee and chocolate forwardness very well. The oaky bourbon presence, both in its warming heat and taste, surrounds the vast array of flavors and seems to aid well their transition. There is a warm yet mildly bitter finish to the beer which I consider very inviting. Its mouthfeel is great although from the appearance of the pour I imagined it to be slightly more viscous and chewy – which I believe would make its flavor profile even more enjoyable.  Overall – in this BA’s humble opinion - KBS definitely lives up to the hype. I wouldn’t say its my all-time favorite, but I would happily trade for it again or go out of my way to get it when travelling.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Nose was my favorite quality of the beer with some very seductive bourbon dark-chocolatey notes, and roasty aromas. Big body on the palate, heavy dark chocolate, and plenty of bourbon booziness.

1199,19960,TheBeerDrinker,4.1,"Pours out like dark oil that hasn't been changed in years with a small dark brown head with little retention and no lacing.  Smell is dark fruits, molasses, burnt malt, and a little bit of sweetness.  Taste is different in that there is some nice vanilla, some chocolate, definitely some dark malts, and there is some sweetness in there. Ironically I thought there would be some big coffee flavor but I only get a TINY hint of it and I would not have noticed it if I really wasn't looking for it. I get a little sweet toffee in this as well.  Mouthfeel is quite thick compared to most stouts in this ABV range. Just had a Black Tuesday and it is no where near that thick. I think its pretty thick but I found a new benchmark today.  Overall this is an incredibly tasty stout. There is so much going on and everything really melds well together. I really like this beer but I was surprised by the lack of coffee which really isn't there for all practical purposes but really there is nothing to complain about here. This is a really complex stout with all the different flavors it is amazing. I don't really get much booze from this beer which is surprising as all the great flavors really work well and I would say hide the booze. That being said I love bourbon so what I can taste is great.  I really love this beer but I won't be chasing trucks for it. It's great, complex but if I'm going to be chasing anything it won't be this. Maybe I'm just putting it up against the Black Tuesday I had today. They are almost 8ABV between them but this just doesn't even come close to that. I guess I would have rated this higher if I didn't have that other beer today. Amazing how an amazing beer can make you think another amazing beer isn't as good. I guess I got spoiled today. Still an amazingly complex beer that demands respect.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A: Midnight black with a small dark tan head that recedes relatively quickly and leaves patchy lacing. Leaves some legs after a swirl around the glass. No light making it through this one.  S: Good Lord… Sweet fudge, earthy coffee, and dark chocolate covered cherries. Barrel notes take up the rear with oaky vanilla and boozy bourbon. Masterclass.  T: Sadly not quite as intense or rich as the nose, but still fantastic. Bitter chocolate, heavily roasted coffee, and tannic bourbon notes. Impressive not in its intensity, but in the cohesion of each of the flavors.  M: Thick and smooth bodied, minimal carbonation is perfect for the style. Mouth coating tannic finish and a bit of alcohol tingle.  O: Fantastic beer, but didn’t quite live up to the hype for me. The nose was epic but the taste fell a little short of what I expected.

Full disclosure, I was very disappointed by FBS, so I'm tempering my expectations for KBS.  Look: Dark dark brown. Basically nonexistent head—musters a millimeter that dissipates to a mere dusting after a second.  Smell: Chocolate, bourbon, and coffee, in that order. After it's allowed to warm, a little vanilla sneaks in, but remains pretty straightforward.  Taste: Chocolatey coffee stout goodness with a fair bit of bourbon heat (but milder than fresh BCBS, which is more of a bourbon bomb to my palate). A marked improvement over FBS. Flavors all blend nicely, with no one dominating the others.  Feel: Smooth and medium-thick. A little tingly, but really just spot-on for the style.  Overall: Good, no doubt, but I've got easy access to plenty of brews (like FW XVII or Stone Southern Charred) that put this to shame.

Stunning. Almost no carbonation but with an oily whisk at the beers top. Aromatics: There is a lovely boutique in this beer. The bourbon barrel hits and I get vanilla, oak and the bourbon itself. I'm also hit with chocolates bitter and sweet with coffee intertwined. Espresso I think. Flavor: The bourbon comes through nicely here as it's just perfectly balanced into the beer. The base is solid in its own way and I pick up those chocolate and coffee notes. There is a big molasses flavor to the beer as well. These might be a touch of alcohol in there but it is really hard to pick up as it's hidden so well. Mouthfeel: The beer is medium full. Oh so creamy in the front a little viscous in the back.

Still, it's silky smooth, and retains a superb balance with being boozy, chewy and sweet near the end..with a sticky choco-marshmallow-like sensation. Big, dense and complex. Worthy indeed. My lasting impression is that yes, this is a world class imperial stout. All the flavors I enjoy about the style are present, and balanced perfectly in such a high abv.

Moderate pour brought fourth a one finger head of a tan hue that dissipated in a hurry, lacing seems moderate. Not able to access the level of carbonation.  S: Warm dry aroma, roasted malt with dark chocolate. Some mellow wood undertones with a syrupy sweetness. Black cherry, prunes, date, and fig, and light coffee flank the nose. Smells less burnt than the imperial stout, maybe some chocolate liquor or genial whisky  T: Initially tall and roasted, chocolate malts come crashing in before the powerful bourbon profile erupts onto the palate. Dry wood, oak, roots, dirt and earth. The bourbon persists into the middle mouth in a powerful fashion clashing with sweeter notes of milk chocolate and toffee – this creates a façade of chocolate liquor, which incorporates spice of anise and faint caramel. A resounding rich espresso is playful throughout. The resinous bourbon reverberates back into the finish, which is warming; shyly boozy – spiced rum inspired vanilla peaks through in the transition between the middle mouth and finish. Hallowed and delicious  M: Big body, heated, chewy as hell, thick, light to no carbonation. After taste is dry and offly sweet, slightly resinous, can get the oak and some earth in there.  O: Hot Damn! I was honestly scared to drink this, worried about the hype and my preconceived notions. This beer lived up, completely. I was pretty enthralled with the FIS, but this is something else.

1199,19960,57md,4.6,"After unsuccessfully trying to score this beer for a few years, I was able to locate both the 2014 vintage on-tap (about a 10 oz pour) and an aged 2011 vintage bottle. Both samples came from the Tavern on Liberty in Allentown, PA.  The numerical scores are for the 2011 bottled version because I actually preferred it to the freshly tapped sample.  The review compares both tasting experiences. Appearance is a deep dark brown with golden brown edges. The half finger of beige head dissipated quickly. The nose had distinct bourbon notes. The roast profile is solid and blends well with the bourbon. The alcohol on the 2014 version was too hot; three years of age really mellowed this offering to my liking. The body on the 2014 version seemed thinner than the 2011 version. Also, the 2011 version possessed a lingering molasses essence that the 2014 version lacked entirely. As expected, no coffee notes were discernible in the 2011 version; surprisingly, the coffee notes in the 2014 version were barely present and only at the very end of the tasting experience.  Update: Had another chance to sample 2014 KBS about a week after writing this original review. This time, it was courtesy of Shady McGrady's in Harrisburg, PA. This sample was a healthy 12oz snifter size. The appearance and nose were similar, but it seemed that the alcohol bite was not as strong on this sample as the one that I had the previous week. The body also seemed slightly more substantial. One similarity was that the coffee notes were quite weak.  I cannot account for the variance – frankly, it was probably just my palate (I had a hoppy beer before the KBS this time around).",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Then mid palate there's an attack of bourbon throughout until the finish. Vanilla melds into the brew and long with a hint of chocolate sweetness and lots of bourbon on the finish.

1199,19960,brianmandell,4.25,"Originally rated 4.25 on draft from brickyard in Jan 2014 (2013 KBS)  The bottled version of the 2014 is a very dark brown/black pour with short tan head and lacing. Big aromas of chocolate syrup, coffee liqueur and vanilla.  The coffee and chocolate are forward with a mild sweetness followed by vanilla and marshmallow flavors. There is some oak on the end finishing in a boozy astringent dryness reminding me of lower quality bourbon.  The mouthfeel is silky and delightful but thinner than I'd like. The thin mouthfeel makes this beer easier drinking than other barrel aged stouts.  Breakfast Stout is one of my favorite beers and I love how KBS shares some similarities and adds some of the benefits of barrel aging. The end result is very good but it falls short of my high expectations. The flavors are big but aren't well integrated.

If this beer was aged in bourbon barrels, then it wasn't for long or the barrel had been used several times. This beer tasted like an iced coffee. The mouth feel was thin.

1199,19960,hudsonskunk,5,"I do not fan boy a lot of beer, but for me, this is as good as it gets.  This beer pours darker than most any beer I have seen. The color resides somewhere between french press coffee, and oil. If poured in a tulip glass the edges reflect a beautiful tinge of mahogany.  The smell is unreal. This beer is 11.2abv, and you can smell a little bit of alcohol. Most of the aroma from beer rests around roasted flavors, peaking around bitternotes with flavors of coffee and oak, and sweet notes with touches of cream and molasses.  Taste is out of this world. When served chilled your roasted barleys and chocolates pop along with bitter notes of american hops. The aromas of hop flavors are suppressed between coffee and cocoa notes, but the bitterness is still there bringing out some of the sweeter tastes of malted milk, and cream. At a more cellar temp. this beer will bust out fruity elements hinting at notes of wild blackberry. Like I said before, the alcohol still supplies a noticeable bite on the back end.  Mouthfeel is perfectly weighted drifting slowly over all plains of the tongue dancing ever so slightly between savory and sweet tastes. Viscosity looks a lot heavier than it actually is, but this comes as a relief in the end as the flavors are so complex a quick finish is most likely favored to ensure all elements of the beer can be enjoyed. (just my opinion, may be total bullshit.)  Overall, this beer is the only beer I would go broke for. It only comes once a year, and it is by far the most consistent and satisfying beer that founders currently produces.

So I tried three bottles at three different temps over three days to get all the possible flavors I could out of the beer. First off this beer does a great job masking the alcohol at 11.2 %. Started with refrigerated bottle into snifter which gave off vague bourbon tones (good thing) but had to wait tor the dark chocolate and coffee tones to become more present as beer warmed. Second day poured room temp into pint glass. Chocolate and coffee tones more present in smell which becomes sort of an oatmeal cookie (again good thing). Third was cellari-sh temp and followed more like the second tasting.

1199,19960,porter_collie,4.93,"8 oz poured from tap in what appeared to be a juice glass  A - Rich black color with a minimal caramel head.  S - Toffee, dark chocolate, tobacco, espresso, and, of course, bourbon. However, none of these scents were overpowering and instead just invite you in for a taste.  T - At first, very similar to the smell. Upfront, I pick up the espresso and dark chocolate notes. However, neither is too strong. Next comes a touch of the bourbon, along with oaky vanilla, figs, and caramel. The finish again brings out bourbon flavors with a hint of warm grain alcohol as it goes down.  M - This was perhaps my favorite part of the beer. The oatmeal imparts a glutinous and almost chewy mouthfeel to the beer. The body is full, but not overtly syrupy. Fantastic.  O - I was astonished by the complexity and balance of this brew. None if the flavors dominated and instead they worked together in harmony to create a splendid beer.

I found the smell a bit more subtle than other reviewers.  Flavor was a bit lighter than I was expecting given the pour. Taste sweet on the tongue with hints of coffee/bitter and warm almost bright bourbon flavors without the whisky bite.  Feels light on the tongue and flows freely through the mouth. leaves a nice warm feeling on the back and sides of the palette.  Over all an enjoyable experience.

Great notes from the bourbon cask.  first drink: not sure - my eyes rolled back in my head. The flavor was amazing, I wonder how this beer would do under Nitrogen, instead of CO2  second drink: able to taste the above flavors, a bit of euphoria, and I could feel the alcohol evaporating in my mouth. No lingering, nasty aftertaste.  end of bottle: small buzz, definitely slightly impaired.  halfway through second bottle: I feel like I've had about 9 Yeunglings in an hour, on my own buzz-rating.

The smell, the bouquet brings it all together chocolates, light coffee, delightful spicy bourbon, espresso, and vanilla. Taste is even better than the nose if that's possible. There's not much alcohol burn or presence of alcohol except for the delicious bourbon flavors. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and thi beer is as easily drinkable as something with much lower ABV. One of the smoothest stouts I've ever tasted.  The hype machine on KBS runs on overdrive but its a worthy beer to be sure.

1199,19960,guityler83,4.9,"2013 vintage  A: After letting the bottle sit out of the fridge for a half hour (agonizing), the beer was poured into a tulip glass with moderate aggression. The head built 1 finger tall the color of tan leather with dense tiny bubbles. After sitting for about a minute the foam receded into the pitch black liquid leaving behind a wave of lacing on the glass. No light shines through the beer when held to a light. Moderate alcohol legs pop out when the beer is agitated.  S: The nose is full of rich dark chocolate, sweet cocoa, hints of vanilla, mild caramel and toffee, very complex. Although I can detect the vanilla and toasted barrel character with a hint of bourbon it doesn't come off alcoholic at all. No hop aroma detected. Light coffee and roasted notes come out on further inspection.  T: Lots of complex chocolate flavors, dark chocolate, bakers chocolate, milk chocolate only a small roast and a nice coffee finish. The middle malts are caramel, toffee and candy raisins that have a nice balancing sweetness with the barrel tannins. Vanilla character coming through with the oak throughout the experience. No hop flavor, and the bitterness is just enough to keep the sweetness from being cloying.  M: There is a large body with mild carbonation that leads to a nice creamy mouthfeel. No astringency detected. Alcohol warming is surprisingly minimal. And that nice tingly sensation with a well made bourbon barrel beer.  O: KBS really shines in its chocolate and barrel flavor balancing act. Its extremely drinkable not overly sweet and has a nice body. Theres not much out there as well brewed as KBS, a shame I could only get 2 bottles this year.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,BradenMK,4.78,"(In the interest of full-disclosure, this IS my first KBS tasting)  APPEARANCE (4) - Poured pitch black and let not a ray of light escape its grasp, as any self-respecting imperial stout should, unfortunately, had only a fleeting, fizzy head, and left no lacing. It was certainly above-average looking, but definitely not amazing in appearance. But hey, looks can be deceiving.  SMELL (4.75) - Vanilla. Bourbon. Maple Syrup. Dark Chocolate. Holy shit. Surprisingly, I don't pick up the coffee on the nose. I'd be interested to know at least a cursory summation of the recipe for this beer. Even though I don't care as much for bourbon barrel stouts, this smells almost perfect.  TASTE (5) - It's outstanding. I don't understand all the hate over this beer. Such a great depth of flavor with a balanced nuance of malt sweetness, upfront bourbon, followed by black coffee, and finally a lasting cocoa note that lingers as the heat from the alcohol warms all the way down. And yet, with all that alcohol, I wasn't hit by a harsh heat on the tongue, and the flavor wasn't influenced by alcohol burn at all. That's a good stout. The barrel-character itself may be a little drowned out by the coffee and bourbon (and any actual chocolate if there is some in the recipe), but it's perceptible in the after-taste. Oh, man, the coffee here is so much better integrated than it is in FBS, and it melds with the bourbon notes into a wholly different beast. Now I've gotta see how this compares with something like Toppling Goliath's Mornin' Delight. The chocolate definitely does come forward a bit more as the beer warms.  I've gotta say, with this beer jumping to 5th overall on the top 250 list this year, I was very skeptical that it would actually stand up to the hype. I am very much glad that it did. Maybe I've got blinders on because I'm just tasting it this year. Maybe it was better in years' past like so many people say it was. But that just goes to show how great a beer it still is.  Ha! I even got a slight cherry note on my last sip. What a nice little send-off to an already amazing beer.  MOUTHFEEL (4) - A little thin, which isn't truthfully unexpected from a beer with so many alterations and additions. Coffee + bourbon + lots of alcohol - it can unbalance the base recipe a little and break up some of those proteins. Not watery by any stretch of the imagination, but in terms of thickness, this guy doesn't measure up to beasts like Founders Imperial Stout or Yeti.  OVERALL (5) - Will I say I like this better than the more readily available Imperial Stout? That's hard to say, but after a few moments deliberation, I don't think so. But am I going to bash it for being so hard to get my hands on? Absolutely not. It is clearly a beer that is more difficult to make and more difficult to balance. If I liked bourbon in my stouts more, then this would absolutely be MUCH better than FIS. There is a LOT going on here, and I'm glad I got to try it. Am I going to go out seeking it every year from now on? Well... yeah, a little bit. It's not overpriced at all, so if I find it, and I will look for it, even if only a little, I am definitely going to buy some. Great, great beer. Founders nails it again.

1199,19960,1000lbgrizzly,4.18,"A: Black viscous body, red tinge around the edge with the proper lighting. No head was produced on my pour, nor is carbonation visible through the opaque body. No lacing, either.  S: Strong notes of burnt malt, coffee, chocolate, smoke, and faint alcohol burn. A little harsh, but loud and clear.  T: Started off with dark chocolate (yum), turned to smoke and harsh bourbon (ok, but disruptive), palate ends with semi-sweet chocolate, smoke, coffee, maple wood, coconut and vanilla (more like a traditional beer, with more than one flavor apparent at once). Very enjoyable, especially the very well done and realistic chocolate notes, but that middle stage was harsh. Alcohol readily present on the finish throughout.  M: Medium bodied, nice and thick but too oily for my preferences, appropriate carbonation.  O: Doesn't cut any corners, for better of worse. Those chocolate notes are incredible- I think they snuck a bar of chocolate into my bottle. Those alcohol/whiskey notes are lifelike- I think they isolated pockets of straight ethanol in my bottle, too. Very well rounded stout, tons of flavors that I can honestly say I've never experienced before (coconut) or at least not with such clarity. The expectations were high, no doubt, and while it did not live up to them it still surpassed nearly every other stout (and most beers of any category).

A- Pours a fully opaque motor oil black color with a 1/4 inch light brown head that retains a bit before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a small side patch of bubbly surface foam. Strange lacing that's split into three columns and is not-so-resilient.  S- Nice waft of oak and vanilla that's sweet and carries with it notes of chocolate and mild coffee. I really like this because of its sweetness. You can definitely smell the bourbon but the brown sugar/caramel/maple notes round it out to make it quite awesome.  T- Initial dark chocolate flavors wind their way across the vanilla, bourbon and finally coffee notes to make for a complex, nearly decadent, drink. The booze becomes apparent after a few hearty swigs but never gets in the way of enjoyment. Wonderful cherrywood finish.  M- Nearly the best part of the beer. Soft, silky smooth and semi-syrupy. Medium-low carbonation and the fullest of bodies.  O- Wow. Fuck all the haters that say ""It was better last year, the year before, the year before..."" This is a premium BBA stout.

A nice vanilla and oaky flavor is evident as well but the coffee and alcohol dominate.  M: Full bodied with just-right carbonation and a noticeable alcohol burn. This is a pleasant sipper as the booze is there, but doesn't dominate. The flavors mesh together and it even gets better as it warms.  O: Definitely hyped, and for good reason.

Plus the booze is nicely masked. You can tell its there but it doesn't permeate the flavor profile.  Mouthfeel is meaty, slick, with low carbonation, it's just enough to support the numerous flavors as they register on the tongue.  This makes for one amazing Spring afternoon back porch sipper.

The smell is fantastic, like chocolate milk and vanilla bourbon. I've had many stouts flavored with coffee and chocolate before but this one definitely takes the cake, far and away. The first thing that hits the palate is the oak and the bourbon with a little bit of coffee bitterness. You can definitely tell that this beer is 11.2% alcohol; it warms the throat but in a very pleasant way. The aftertaste is very forward on the chocolate with undertones of coffee.

It's tough to see) Drinking: 4/4/14 @ 7:30 PM Setting: Living room couch, watching Bear Grylls: Escape from Hell- CANYONS  Scored one bottle this year. I tried for a few others, but it didn't work out. Happy to have one, and can't wait to enjoy this baby.  A: Poured into a snifter glass after letting the beer sit at room temp for 15 minutes. Poured somewhat aggressively and got a nice 1 1/2 finger of a chocolaty milk-like head. The beer itself is almost jet black with shades of deep purple. The heead fades over about 2 minutes to about 1/2 finger and caps the inky liquid beneath. Deep, dark, and sexy sexy, that's for sure.  S: Dark roasted coffee beans and vanilla cream immediately hit the nose. Huge chocolate presence with hints of bourbon and oak. A faint hint of cinnamon perhaps? Earthy hop tones balance out the rich malty sweetness. Bravo!  T: Taste follows the nose with the bitterness of the coffee and toasted vanilla up front. There's some glorious flavors in here: Creme brule', burnt caramel, roasted coffee and cream, oak, peat, char, toasted coconut, and enough balance from the earthy hop bitterneess to keep everything in check. A wonderful richness throughout.  MF: This beer leaves a lacquer-like coating on the tongue. It washes over all of the taste receptors in your mouth, and because of it's stickiness, allows for all of the flavors to linger and let themselves be experienced, before finishing dry. Really leaves you wanting more.  O: When I had this beer last year, I claimed it to be the best beer I've ever had. Since that time, I've been fortunate enough to try the likes of Heady Topper, Pliny The Elder, Goose Island BCBS, etc...Gun to my head, I'm a stout guy, and because of that, I still lean towards this offering as one of the best beers out there, if not the best.

At $8.99 per bottle, it sure as heck should be.  The KBS did not disappoint. As good as it was, the price bothered me a bit for one reason: This beer tastes almost exactly like Dragon's Milk from New Holland. There are some differences, mainly the coffee and chocolate tones, but other than that its got that same boozy taste which I love.  Anyway, did I like this beer? YES. Would I buy it again? NO.

1199,19960,jageraholic,4.69,"2014 KBS. Number abiove are from 2013. This release snuck up on me but i was able to track down a bottle in the area. Served into my snifter around 50-55 degrees.  A: a beauty. Pitch black, light brown froth on top. Microbubbles keeping it alive. 5  S: fantastic aromas of coffee, vanilla, bourbon, some oak, a little anise, caramel and slight hint of alcohol heat in the background. 5  T: wow. Wave of sweet bourbon at first, vanilla follows with some burnt chocolate and caramel in the background. Coffee in the finish and alcohol heat in the aftertaste but in a good way. Man i wish i was sitting by a fire drinking this. Crazy wave of flavors with each sip being a different flavor taken dominance. Awesome wild ride to drink. 4.75  M: coats the mouth but dissapates really quickly. Leaves a lingering presence known along with some of the complex flavors above. A little over carbonated for a stout which is its only flaw. But that goes away the slower i drink it. 4  O: a phenominal beer and one i look forward to every year. Worth every moment of tracking it down. Looking at my review of last year, 2014 definitely has more stout quality and is really really awesome. 4.5  2013 KBS...start of my birthweek, sitting outside, been drinking a lot of IPAs lately, time for a stout.  A: rough pour, nice inch light brown head that reduces down to a microline of bubbles throughout the rest of the beer experience. Pitch black in the body of the tulip glass, with a light clear brown around the surface edge. Beautiful stout.  S: lot of bourbon in the smell. Very sweet. Some vanilla and chocolate in the background, but smell is predominately sweet. Like if maple candy were bourbon rather than maple. No sense of any alcohol in the smell. Slight coffee notes come out too. Alcohol comes out more as it warms.  T: lot of sweet bourbon in the taste. Takes over the mouth at first, then gives way to notes of vanilla, maybe a little cherry in the background. Not much chocolate, coffee or malt taste...yea,not getting many stout flavors, but very smooth bourbon (pleasant bourbon,not overwhelming like fresh BCBS) vanilla and slight tart cherry. No woodiness. Alcohol presenting itself as it gets mid 50s and getting more chocolate.  M: very thick in the palate, coats the mouth with a nice dry finish leaving the great flavor in my mouth and wanting more.  O: I remember more stout qualities in the past, even when i tried this years when it was first released. I like the balance of the bourbon aging and imp stout qualities that KBS usually has and this one is lacking that. It is very sweet and very flavorful, incredibly smooth beer with no burn at all for a hgh abv beer. Was expecting more stout, got more bourbon, and founders did excellent, because i'm not dissapointed in the slightest. Just have to throw in when the alcohol shows itself, it tastes like delicious chocolate bourbon with a smooth subtle burn, basement temp is the way to go with this beer.

Slightly disappointed in Founder's after all the expansion, Breakfast Stout has/ is not the same, nor is KBS now.  2011:  figured this would be a good place to start for my first review since it's the best beer I've ever had and prolly ewill have this year  Bottled 2-25-11 poured into New Belgium Globe  A- Jet black with dark brown mocha head that sticks around for awhile...

1199,19960,Jack_Malts,4.84,"Founders KBS 2014 release 11.2% abv  Pours black/midnight brown with no head, no lacing  Smell is sweet bourbon booziness, vanilla, heavily sweetened dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts, . Everything it says on the box. No nonsense.  Taste has a bigger coffee presence than the nose because of some bitterness in the aftertaste. I’m also getting darker chocolate, almost approaching cocoa powder tartness. Vanilla and sweet bourbon booziness are very enticing. I’m detecting a little licorice as well. The warming alcohol presence is delightful. Bourbon is very present in the finish. All the flavors blend together nicely. More and more bourbon as it warms.  Low carbonation, full body, a little sticky, never cloys. Delightfully alcoholic.  I can’t say much about this beer that hasn’t already been said. It is amazing. One of the best BBL stouts I’ve ever had. I feel like a lot of breweries that do BBL stouts make the mistake of not leaving them in the barrel long enough. It takes patience to make a beer this good, just like it took me a hell of a lot of patience and effort to find the damn thing. I can say with great confidence that I am enjoying this more than BCBS. I haven’t had the coffee varietal yet, so lord knows how delicious that is. The only beer that I can say I enjoyed more than this is Old Rasputin XVI. Now that was a hell of a beer. That being said, this is a much cheaper beer. A 500ml bottle of XVI cost 24$, whereas I was able to get a four pack of this for about the same price, making this beer infinitely more economical.  About the four pack - the four pack was a mish-mash of bottles from different locations around Northern Virginia. I had quite an adventure assembling the four pack, one that I will probably remember for the rest of my life as my first real beer adventure. I’m sure there are more to come, but those will probably involve trips to Belgium. Or Vermont. Or California. You know what I’m getting at. All that I can say is that it was totally worth everything I went through to get it. So please please please do try this beer. You will love it.  Also, drink it first. You’ll only get a full appreciation for this beer if you start drinking it sober. This is not a nightcap. It is an event, and should be treated as such.

1199,19960,Stevedore,4.26,"Context: 12oz bottle of the 2013 vintage (just obtained today in the Great KBS Derby of Madison 2013) poured into a Bell's tulip. This is the first I've had of 2013, but I've had 2012 in the past. Disclosures: there is the potential for the extra work of obtaining this beer to influence this review, as I left work early and drove across town to get some.  Aroma: Smells just as good as I remember it. Very big, pungent nose that I can smell coming out of the bottle. Very, very bourbon barrel forward nose- vanilla and oak dominating. There is some dark brewed coffee, and some cocoa and chocolate malt aromas that comes to the front as it warms up. While its dominated by the bourbon barrel characteristics, it's up there with BCBS and Black Note when it comes to aroma.  Colour: Looks great. Pours a viscous jet black body- not quite Ten FIDY but really thick. It may be the way I poured it, but it comes with nearly no head whatsoever and leaves just a thin brown collar. It might have to do with me drying my tulip glass by hand with a towel just before drinking this. I'll revisit when I drink another one in a clean dry glass, but even then- the relative lack of head is pretty typical of imperial stouts. Also, the lacing is pretty average- it's there and sticks, but there isn't a ton of it. Overall it beats some of the other BA stouts I've had but not by much.  Flavour: Nice. The first sip of this beer kicks me in the face with its bourbon barrel-forward character. Tons of vanilla and oak. Just like the nose. It's pretty much all bourbon barrel for the first few minutes. And as it warms up, I can make out cocoa and dark chocolate malt flavours, almost on the bitter side even. Warming up some more, the coffee definitely makes its appearance, tasting like cold brewed coffee- not too stale, not too pungent- not too coffee forward like people seem to always be saying about fresh KBS. A nice progression of flavours that continue to layer on top of each other. It's quite fun to sip on as it goes from fridge-cold to room temperature.  Mouthfeel: Compared to what I remember of last year's, it's actually a bit thicker on the body which I'd classify as on the thinner side of thick body. Last year would be thicker side of medium bodied. This could be pure semantics or pure folly. It's as creamy as ever that leaves my palate with a dry finish. Carbonation is average for beer in general, and is just about right for this kind of beer. The aftertaste is a nice, smooth mix of bitter coffee and chocolate and the bourbon barrel oak flavours. And I definitely feel the heat as the beer warms up to room temperature. This beer doesn't disappoint in the mouthfeel department.  Overall: Despite all the naysayers saying this year's KBS is thinner bodied, has no bourbon, etc., it seems to me that this is the same KBS that we've all come to enjoy. I'm happy to have gotten my hands on some of this year's vintage. It's a nice, complex beer that's great to sip on- it really should be released 3 months earlier in the winter. It's a very good bourbon barrel-aged coffee imperial stout that any BA stout fan would really enjoy and that's as simple as that. Ignore the hype, taste the beer and be happy.  Old rating: 4/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5, total score 4.48  Note: I would consider holding onto this beer for a month or two to see if the bourbon barrel contribution mellows out a bit and to see if you can get some of the underlying malt flavours.  Re-review (2014 vintage): Picked up a bottle of this perennial treat on KBS Day yesterday, 4/1/2014. Poured into a Founders' etched snifter today, 4/2/2014. Essentially, it's very similar to last year in terms of my tasting notes. However nose-wise, I feel that the coffee is very subdued, and the bourbon is a bit watered down. Not as much vanilla (from the bourbon/oak) or oak presence here. The bourbon really doesn't hit me in the face as much as it did in last year's vintage. Flavourwise, plenty of sweet chocolate flavours, dark malts, milk chocolate, some coffee which is clearly not as noticeable as BCBCS et al. On the backend, there is more of a solid straight bourbon flavour that is initially sweet and a bit ashy, but the barrel contribution is relatively minimal. Good mouthfeel, viscous but a bit hot, leaves a nice warmth in my stomach as I drink it. But overall this is a slight letdown for me considering how much I enjoyed last year's version. It could very well be palate evolution or bottle variation.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Breakfast stout dark sweetness and chocolate. Some coffee as well. These with a little bourbon thrown in. Not boozy or over powering, the bourbon flavor was very complementary.

1199,19960,itsscience,5,"This review covers a fresh bottle of the 2014 release. Shamrock Liquors in Orlando FL hooked me up with two. Thanks!  It comes out viscous and black, like motor oil. Looking around the edges of my snifter glass, there's a -little- bit of reddening in the light, but not much. There's no head to speak of but some khaki bubbles around the rim. The nose is bold with chocolate , vanilla, coffee beans, and wood from the bourbon barrel aging. These notes are in harmony with each other -- each comes through in a big way but nothing overpowers the rest. When tasting it, the sweetness of the vanilla plays off the natural bitterness of the coffee and chocolate for a balance of flavors, putting each ingredient on a pedestal to speak for itself. The oak and bourbon lend a secondary profile of woodsiness, burned toast, and molasses to make this beer an absolute pleasure to drink, and it all goes down creamy and smooth. The alcohol is absolutely undetectable. I wanted to age my other bottle, but I don't know if I can keep myself from cracking it open.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,jmadiadora19,4.84,"Ill start out by saying wow. This beer definitely lives up to the hype surrounding it and exceeded my expectations. As an IPA lover, stouts usually aren't on the top of my list. Plain and simple if you like bourbon and the deep, rich flavor of dark roast coffee you will love this. Much more complex flavor profile than most stouts I have tried, the bourbon is very pronounced on the nose and flavor (I feel it would be better with some age). The heat of the abv is there, allowing for the beer to seem much larger than I thought.  A-very little carbonation and poured jet black  S-like bourbon and coffee. Some vanilla notes as well  T-very complex and balanced. The bourbon was the noticeable of all flavors  M-my favorite aspect. Perfect level of carbonation and nice slick consistency  O-seek this beer out. Imo doesn't matter what style of beer you are into this will be a treat. Cheers from Denton, TX and Oak Street Draft House!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Apatschinn,4.96,"App. - Very dark with little to no head at all. Whatever came up quickly dissipated. Intermittent bubbles broke the surface. Beautifully brown in color if held up to a light, but only around the edges, this beer is incredibly opaque.  Smell - The bourbon was the first thing to hit my nose. This was quickly followed by rich coffee and chocolate hints. Not overpowering but very strong.  Taste - As expected, the bourbon hits strong but does not last very long. The coffee and chocolate cascade right in afterwards. Strong, but again not overpowering. Very well balanced.  Mouth. - Velvety and smooth.  Over. - Fantastic beer. Definitely lives up to the hype.

I hadn't looked at the ABV before sipping it, but after one mouthful, I got up to check. If anything, it feels like more than 11.2 - - but that's OK.

Strong, smooth, and aggressive. Such was the taste. Low carbonation, highly viscous.  O. This is an excellent ale. Big time. Worth the hype.

A thin chocolate milk foamy cap rests on the surface. When the head begins receding, some lacing is left behind.  Smell: Wow...big bourbon and oak fill the nose followed by dark bittersweet chocolate, and espresso notes. Also get the booze.  Taste: Big bourbon, coffee, chocolate, heavy roasted malts, booze are present. When you take a sip and savor, it tastes like a rich chocolate cake made with espresso and soaked in bourbon. Delicious.  Mouthfeel: Velvety smooth and cooling alcohol vapor. While the 11% is felt, it's not un-welcomed or overpowering.  Overall: Amazing. This was my first KBS and I do understand the hype.

While visiting some friends in Kalamazoo, MI, several friends suggested making a trip to Grand Rapids to try the seasonal release of the KBS from Founders. We arrived around 5 am in the morning to find people wrapped around the brewery almost twice over. By the time noon rolled around, we found out that cases were no longer being sold because of the unanticipated number of people in queue. 30 minutes later, 12-packs were no longer available, and eventually by the time there were less than 50 people in front of us, we were informed that there were no longer any bottles available but the taproom still had plenty.

The bourbon is quite present, providing some vanilla and a bit of sweetness that offsets the bitter. Roasted malt. Like the nose, the flavours are super integrated.

They're black, they all have a little bit of foam. I'll give it the obligatory and completely arbitrary 4.5.  S - Coffee, chocolate, and a little vanilla. Don't get the barrel's bourbon in the nose.  T - Taste follows the nose with a little oak and woodiness from the barrel. This tastes really good, but it has Kentucky in the name and I'm not getting any bourbon taste or alcohol.  M - Terrific silky smooth feel on the tongue with a super pleasant chocolate milk finish. No thin or tingly alcohol here.  O - This is a great beer, but I think a little bourbon flavor would make it even better. I remember more bourbon from the times I've had it before, but who knows if my beer memory is reliable.

I was up in Waterbury VT for a beer release this past weekend and was fortunate enough to find myself at the Prohibition Pig - one of my favorite taprooms I might add. They had a keg of KBS from 2012 that they tapped. Immediately with your first sip you get notes of coffee but before you know it they are taken over by chocolate and vanilla. This is one of the smoothest beers that I have ever had. There is just no bitterness to it. If it wasn't for the ABV north of 11% I could drink this all night.

Just a bit of sweet bourbon left in the nose. The standout here is the deep, chocolaty notes.  Taste: Up front you get that sweet, caramel/butterscotch bourbon barrel. Follows with more of those awesome chocolate notes, almost like a dark chocolate mocha with lots of cream and smooth roasted coffee beans. Finishes with a bit of oaky bourbon barrel.  Mouthfeel: Almost perfect. Full and very creamy. Warming but only in the best way.  Overall: Needless to say a beer like this is always a treat.

Smell is good but the coffee really overpowers the subtleties in the nose - bourbon is hard to pick up and the cocoa comes through but 80% of what you smell is just coffee grounds. Again, this is good but I look for geared complexities in big stouts like this.  Again, the taste maintains the strong coffee profile but brings in the vanilla from the boubron barrels, some cocoa/chocolate and a lot of off-bitter malts - very enjoyable.

I can slightly detect chocolate and bourbon, but they certainly take back seat. T: Similar to taste, coffee very dominant up front. The bourbon is ever so smooth and present, with chocolate there to balance out just enough sweetness to bring it all together. Very well done in the flavor. As it warms up the complexity just keeps opening up. M: Carbed well, smooth, silky. After taste reminds me very much of my morning coffee, making this very hard to simply sip. O: If I were doing a blind taste test, I don't think I would rate this one among the best. While I don't want to take away from how great of a beer this is, I think the hype is mainly due to availibility. I did enjoy the 2013 on draft this Summer as well, and remember it being much more complex than in the bottle. All this being said, I do recommend anyone who's a fan of the style to seek it out and give it a try, as it is a great beer. I would only recommend to not give into the hype, and please don't give a life and limb to acquire.  Edit 7/14/14 This review desperately needs updated. 2014 was a much better year in terms of personal yield, and I've enjoyed a few from this year already - this review to come later. I have been working through a vertical dating back to 2009, and have to say I am getting much more respect for this beer.  The 2009 surprised me, as it was a twist off bottle. It poured with absolutely no head to speak of, and the carbonation level was super low. The biggest aroma and flavor was chocolate. There was a powerful yet pleasant bourbon presence in both the aroma and flavor - but bourbon was definitely backseat to chocolate.  The 2010, pry off bottle, is almost the reverse of 2009. The bourbon takes lead, and while the chocolate is present, it by no means is dominant. I also detect subtle vanilla as well in the flavor. Carb level is still appropriate, and very similar to the fresh 2014 batch.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The strong coffee and bourbon notes meshing together are heavenly.  T- While not as great as the smell it's easily one of the top 5 best tasting beers I've ever had. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, oak, all incredible.  M- Only knock on KBS is I which it was a bit fuller. Kind of thin. Still great.  O- One of the best beers made in the world easily compares to BCBS.

Taste is strong on the base Breakfast stout, chocolate, coffee - lighter on the bourbon, but I may just be twisted from drinking so many BA stouts this year. Nose mirrors that, with a bit of the tinge of bourbon.  Mouthfeel was thinner than I remembered, but still solid. Little to no head.  Great sipping beer, and better when the temperature warms.

A: Pours a deep, rich, opaque motor oil black color with minimal head, a little bit of mocha coloring with small patches of mocha colored lacing.  S: Probably the most aromatic beer I've ever smelled. Chocolate liqueur, rum, coffee, toffee, vanilla, cinnamon, these are the things that come to mind.  T: Hard to put my finger on it. It's sweet but very smokey and earthy as well. Tastes of bourbon, spices, caramel, malts, barley, coffee, toffee, spices and booze.  M: Rich, full bodied beer, with lesser amounts of carbonation, ample amounts of flavor, very rich and viscous. Good warmth from the booze.  O: Overall, this was a pretty damn good beer and an interesting experience. However, I not sure if it was worth the price I paid, I mean, I thought it looked incredible and smelled incredible, but it didn't taste incredible, it was good but I guess it just didn't fit the bill for my definition of a divine beer but it was good none the less.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,Roguer,4.51,"Pours a solid, 1 finger dark brown head with good retention for the style, fading to a thin bubbly remnant. Solid lacing. Brew Is the motor oil solid black one would expect.  Chocolate and bourbon through the nose, with a milk-and-barley stout composition. Intimidating but smooth. Slight red grape booziness, dry cocoa, and a hint of coffee.  Smooth flavor, with everything blended perfectly: bourbon, chocolate, red grapes, cream, vanilla, a hint of burnt coffee (especially as it warms), and wheat/barley. Nice bite. Basically follows the nose, but everything is unbelievably balanced. The alcohol from the bourbon can come across a touch harsh at times.  Unbelievably thick and smooth mouthfeel; creamy and tingly. Chewy. Alcohol is definitely present, with a pleasant warmth, but that's too be expected.  It's a toss-up as to which is the better beer: KBS or BCBS. There's certainly no loser in this exchange. This is a fantastic beer, and hits every wicket you want in a bourbon stout.  2013 vintage.  Big thanks to JayORear who included this as an extra in a trade.  Additional notes: I tend to find KBS smoother (read: less harsh) on tap and aged. Fresh from the bottle, it's a bit hot, but still fantastic. I can't explain why it always seems to be better on tap.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,magictacosinus,4.66,"Thanks a ton, angrybabbon! 2013 vintage. This was poured to me blind in a bourbon stout tasting recently, but I kind of figured that it was KBS when we got to try it. Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a snifter.  Pours a plainly opaque, blackened color, with some slight hazelnut (seriously, it's f**king hazelnut tinted) tinges at the sides of the liquid. There's not much of a head on this by this point, but it delightfully leaves behind a solid mocha colored ring with some thickened bubbles at the sides. Extremely viscous, even for the style - this would leave a shrapnel pattern worth of film and droplets against the walls of the glass every time that I would swirl this. A really appealing looking beer - falls short with the head lacking a bit, but it's doable.  Smells terrific - HERE'S an elegant way to make a bourbon barrel aged stout, folks. This is like the answer to the question that I've pondered on since I started trying these types of beers. At first, rather than a barrage of bourbon-y, sweet flavors, you get the roasted and fruity qualities of the base stout. This may not be FBS, but it certainly reminds me of it. Freshly ground coffee, cocoa nibs, raisins, and black strap molasses are right at the front, followed by subtle yet vivid notes of vanilla, burnt toffee, allspice, and caramel. Then, my favorite part - a ""dusty,"" slightly tobacco tinged oaky note that you only really get in higher quality oak-forward wines or bourbons. It's so vivid, so alive... And yet, so elegant and subtle. It's like I'm in the barrel room. I'm seriously astonished that this is 11.2% ABV. This is the work of wizards.  The flavor continues the path the aroma takes, and over some time and patience, the flavors from the oak start to really meld and open up meticulously alongside the heavily roasted character of the stout. The roasted flavor, in fact, is similar to chocolate covered espresso beans, and dried fruity notes of raisins and prunes are fully in play. Only enough, however, to bring forth the woody notes underneath lavished in sweet bourbon flavors. Caramel, vanilla, toffee, but more importantly, baking soda, cinnamon, and tobacco. The pure essence of the barrel flavors are revealed over time, with the caramel notes becoming increasingly stronger in a comforting way as the fruit opens up. Very restrained, but bless the baking soda notes for cleansing the palate every single sip - it allows for each new sip to be different from the last. Creamy, well carbonated, and never too syrupy and sweet. It's simply astonishing how drinkable this is.  Dear me, I can see why people buy these by the case in several parts around the country every time this is released. Contains all the aspects I love in a stout, as well as oak forward characteristics I enjoy in oak-aged beverages. What's so impressive is how restrained and subtle so many of the flavors are. And, dare I say refreshing? It's a premier cigar beer, no doubt, but I could have this any day of the week, regardless of the occasion. It's complex, but extremely easy to approach. All of the elements are well thought out. I, however, feel the roasted coffee character is the highlight of the beer, and it's unfortunate that it probably wouldn't age as well as others of its league. Nevertheless, this is a world-class beer that should be tried by everyone, whenever possible.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S - Amazing coffee aroma in this beer that stood out incredibly.. smell blended very well with cocoa and very well hidden bourbon notes.  T - This was the best tasting beer IMO at this event with the likes of many other top 100 beers. This beer warmed up amazingly and more and more coffee, cocoa flavors came out as it approached 55-60. Alcohol is extremely well hidden in the taste as bourbon hints come through at the end. This taste exceeded my expectations regarding the hype surrounding this beer.  M - This beer was served too cold so waited for it to warm.. it because much thicker, creamier, smoother as it warmed up with a full bodied mouthfeel. Awesome finish on this beer. THis beer exceed my expectations in terms of taste and finish.  O - First time having this and it was on draft… I've been blessed to get my hands on a few bottles in the last couple weeks and will be opening 1-2 on Christmas Eve. This beer is well worth the hype and lived up or exceeded my expectations.  Seek this one out if you can!

There was a much brighter Bourbon nose last year. This year the bourbon notes are very light and the taste is not really there. The chocolate is good, but I would prefer a heavier Bourbon flavor.  That is my review from last year above...

Appearance: Jet black with a nice mocha head that sticks around for a while. Lacing all over the glass at is disappears. Pretty stout.  Smell: coffee, chocolate, and a nice sweet bourbon smell. Exceptional smelling bourbon barrel stout. Little roasty too.  Taste: Bourbon out front and coffee follows immediately. Even with a bit of age on it it's still has a great balance to it. It's a sipper, but not because of the heat (which is non existent) or intense bourbon barrel flavor. It's just delicious. The flavors come together wonderfully. I definitely think it deserves the hype it gets.  Moutfeel: A little thin, suprisingly. I expected this to have a bit more chewiness to it to be honest. I'd say this is it's one minor flaw.  Overall: Hunt this beer down, trade for it, whatever (don't chase trucks...that's lame). It's worth a bit of effort and certainly worth the price ($5-9 for 12 oz).

1199,19960,falloutsnow,3.76,"From: On-tap at Crane Alley, Urbana, IL Date: 2013-11-24 Glass: Founder's Snifter  Founders' KBS is a good, fairly balanced stout that does not push its bourbon character to the forefront, which typically masks all other elements of the base beer. The result is a modestly coffee-chocolate syrup forward stout with nuances of bourbon, ethanol, and vanilla. The 2011 version features less subtle bourbon and vanilla than the 2013; perhaps brought out by extended aging. Regardless, 2011 or 2013, this isn't a beer that I think deserves the hype, nor is it one of the best beers I've ever tasted. Above average, but nothing exceptional or that I'd go out of my way for again.  Arrives with 0.5cm tall head of tan-colored bubbles, small and dense in size, leading to a frothy appearance. Foam retention is poor, fading to a thin ring around the glass in under one minute, leaving a ghostly island of foam atop the body of the beer. Lacing is good, a large scattering of dots and lines cling to the glass' sides after each sip. Body is a dark brown to black color, opaque, with light bringing out dark amber-red hues around the perimeter of the beer. Carbonation not visible through the opaque body.  Aroma is a bit milder than expected, of dried leaves, oak, instant coffee granules, chocolate syrup, vanilla, and no apparent bourbon. Good, but not amazing or one of the best aromas I've ever smelled in a beer.  Overall flavors are of dried coffee, chocolate syrup, modest ethanol and bourbon, with slight vanilla and smoke. Front of palate picks up freeze-dried coffee granules, chocolate syrup, mild bourbon and ethanol, hints of vanilla. Mid-palate of chocolate syrup, freeze-dried coffee, mild bourbon, mild ethanol, extremely faint vanilla: fairly rich, good, but not as deep or amazing as expected. Back of palate finds ethanol, freeze-dried coffee, and chocolate syrup. Aftertaste of smoky, freeze-dried coffee granules, with mild cocoa and sweetness, and lightly acrid bitterness.  Beer is medium-heavy to heavy in body, with low carbonation that makes this slightly foamy (1/5), but mostly smooth (4/5) on the palate. Appropriate for the style and this beer in particular. Closes dryly, with moderate to medium-heavy stickiness lingering on the palate.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I also just witnessed one of the coolest things I've ever seen when looking at a beer. At the end of the pour when the head starts to foam, what appeared to be tiny beer-filled bubbles formed and, due to their density, wanted to get below the head and into the meat of it. Instead of breaking through the surface, they just whizzed and glided across the surface, spinning at high rpm until *pop*  Disclaimer: I'm a bit lifted atm. Fukkin' KBS is one of my favs until this influence.  S - plastic, kinda hollow empiness. Sugary coffee comes through on the finish joined with lactose. Coffee with cream and two sugars.  T - Roasted caramel and toasted marshmallows drizzled in mocha chocolate sauce. It's a Regular Coffee. Sweet medium roast coffee packed full of sugar (brown sugar!) and heavy cream.

The head did not appear very proteinaceous. Carbonation was not visible from the sides of the glass.  Aroma- Big nose full of roasty malts, vanilla and bourbon (booze). Can't quite put my finder on it, but the 2009 is better ""put together"" on the nose than the 2010. Overall, both had a slight solvent aroma which kept these from receiving a perfect score on aroma.  Flavor- Big, huge malty backbone- rich with syrupy sweetness. This is met with an equally strong hit of oak and bourbon. There is a substantial herbal bitterness here as well- presumably from both the black malts, coffee and hops. These serve nicely to offset the sweetness. The solvent notes detected on the nose become apparent on the tongue, but are not overwhelming. Long finish that stays with you for days. Both vintages exhibited the same flavor components, but the 2009 was much more attractive; the flavors had married in this vintage, much how flavors in chili combine better the next day.  Mouthfeel- Big, chewy and slightly silky mouthfeel from both vintages. Carbonation is perfectly soft. There is some heat here from the alcohol, but a pleasant heat. Astringency is present but at an appreciable level as well.  Overall- This is a fantastically big beer. It definitely ages well.

T - This is a really good tasting beer. The notes are all there; bourbon, vanilla, coffee on the front end and finishing with dry oak and dark chocolate. The only reason this wasn't rated any higher, was because the booziness is a touch too much. I'd like to see this aged for 6 months, and maybe a touch (more?) oatmeal.  M - This is where the beer kills it. It's perfect. Thick, chewy, and creamy. Slightly sticky and mouth-coating. A real stand out.  O - A damn delicious beer. Search it out. The only way this could get better is with a little less booze (for me). Some people seem to enjoy the booze. I feel this would be fun if it had a Huna/Abraxas/Mexi Cake treatment and had some chili's and/or cinnamon thrown in. It's a huge beer in a small bottle. Every time I've had this previously has been at the end of a tasting, with a wrecked palate. It was still good, but now, after having it by itself, I believe the hype. Well done Founders!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,TheBiercast,4.69,"Appearance: Blackest of night with the tannest of tan heads of about a finger and a half thick. It’s foamy and oh so pretty.  Smell: Let’s not forget about what this beer came from, the Breakfast Stout. The aroma has so much coffee. I also know that you can’t physically smell density, but KBS just smells thick. The aroma is a good warning for what you’re about to get into.  Taste: As the nose leads on, the stout has a lot of coffee, but surprisingly, it doesn’t dominate as the nose might suggest. I expected bigger bourbon flavor in this, but the subtle presence smooths out the bitterness from the coffee and dark chocolate malts. Hop presence is very minimal as expected, but slight bitterness comes presence from the coffee and chocolate. The bourbon’s main contribution, in my opinion, is the smooth vanilla flavors to balance it all out.  Mouthfeel: When you see how thick the pour is, you don’t really expect a thin, watery brew. There is nothing thin and watery about KBS. It is very thick, but it is so smooth that there is nothing unappealing about it. One word: creamy.  Overall: Founders KBS is just delicious. It is not extremely complex in the varieties of flavors it offers, but what it does offer(coffee, chocolate, vanilla bourbon), the complexity is so deep. The thick, creamy mouthfeel is just so drinkable. It’s not a beer I could drink everyday, but anytime someone offers me one, I’ll drink it…and love it irregardless.  4.75/5.0…what’s really perfect?",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,kylehay2004,4.64,"Rare opportunity for me in the southeast to have this one. I had about a shot glass if it once before.  A: thin off white head with excellent lacing on a jet black body. A little more head and it would be perfect. May be pour related and do to the fact it is on draft  S: aroma is dominated by milk and dark chocolate and oak with vanilla, bourbon and dark fruit notes. I was sitting under a fan and yet the the aroma stayed full on the nose.  T: I had this one cold then let it warm up to are how it changes. The bourbon dominated when cold. As it warmed I got more chocolate, oak and vanilla. I must say I want more coffee which was more in the after taste. Last years seemed to have more coffee.  M: thick body but doesn't overly coat the palate, smooth with moderate carbonation. Carbonated a bit more than I wanted for the style to make it perfect but damn close.  Overall: I have tried many great beers and this one is at the top of that list. Best thing about it honestly is that it lives up to the hype which for a beer this highly rated is difficult to do.

1199,19960,rx-beer,4.36,"A - Pours a still black with a very thin ribbon of head that fades almost entirely. Very fine lacing.  S - Upfront and at lower temperatures there's a lot of coffee with some notes of bourbon. As the temperature rises, bourbon becomes more apparent and the coffee becomes much harder to detect.  T - Dark chocolate predominates initially, and then gives way to some espresso. Finally, the bourbon becomes more evident. Aftertaste has a balance between the bourbon and the coffee flavors. The warmer it gets, the more bourbon comes through.  M - Very full bodied, quite thick, and no carbonation.  O - This is a phenomenal beer. It blurs the lines between a fine beer and a fine liquor. Even though I think this is a great stout, it would not be my go-to stout. I would save this one for special occasions. I have to say, my favorite stout continues to be Breakfast Stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Duane_Opfer,4.7,"Special thanks to Jake Holland for providing me the #4 beer on BA out of the goodness of his heart...  12 oz. bottle poured into a Spiegelau glass. No date on bottle, but from April 2013 release.  A - Brown approaching black in color. Low carbonation. Moderate pour yielded less than a finger of a tan/cinnamon head which quickly dissipated. Minor splotching rather than lacing as liquid receded. Not as thick as I expected.  S - Absolutely indulgent. Best aspect of this beer. Smelled of dark chocolate, sweet bourbon, and toffee.  T - Complex flavor palate. Bourbon first and foremost, but without the unpleasantness of straight bourbon (not a bourbon drinker), although still boozy. Additionally, dark chocolate, vanilla, eggnog/irish crème, brown sugar, nutmeg/cinnamon, and slightly acidic coffee notes. The coffee flavors were not as dominant as I expected.  M - Less viscous than I expected; not creamy. Slightly sticky. Lower level of carbonation typical of an imperial stout.  O - An incredibly warming beer. Recommended after a full meal on a cold night. Nothing bashful about it... high ABV, but flavor complements incredibly well. I am not a bourbon fan, but I can appreciate the complex flavor palate. Highly recommended if you are a fan of bourbon and can actually get a hold of one of these rare gems.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,BradtheGreat7,4.99,"This particular review was taken on my birthday May 2nd, 2013. 2013 KBS release. I've also had 2010, 2011, and 2012.  12 oz shorty bottle Founders style. The KBS logo and label are downright classy and simple but beautiful. The color scheme makes my day and really what other colors are more suited for something called Kentucky Breakfast Stout? I poured this into an authentic KBS glass(yes a KBS goblet!) it was a gift from my dad on the very same day I popped the 2013 open. This is a very special review for me. About time I put it on BA.  A - this stuff pours like liquid mud. Black as the darkest corner of a moonless night, black. It's black and its as thick as oil. A proper big stout. A dark brown head is pretty sturdy on the pour leaving a lighter brown to tan stick throughout the goblet. This slow moving liquid is a sight to behold. Beauty at its best.  S - all the sweet notes a fine bourbon would have to offer. Vanillas, caramels, and soft chocolate are a real treat for the nose. I drink plenty of the best bourbon made right here in Kentucky to know what these notes do to a man. The oak aromas are dead on with a real woodsy character and a small hint of roasted coffee bean remind you its indeed a Breakfast Stout style.  T - more bourbon flavors up front with black coffee and chocolate in the background. A real roasted oakiness to it. The vanilla, and caramel sweetness paired with roasted malt make for one hell of an experience. It's just layer after layer of bourbon barrel goodies.. The finish has a tingle of alcohol spice that ends in a bittersweet delight. This may be the most perfect beer ever to reach a bourbon barrel.  M - massive and thick. The texture and thickness is unbelievable really. Top marks to layers upon layers of thick liquid that coats the entire palate. Smooth and rich.. Delicious! Oh so delicious. Oh so perfect!  O - KBS is a consistent highlight in a man's yearly beer calendar. It's as good as the first bottle I ever had the pleasure to experience. What Founders has produced is the ultimate perfection of the American/Double Stout style. I will look forward to this year in and year out. As a Kentuckian I know the best bourbon and I know good ales aged in these barrels and KBS is an absolute out of this world brew. It has everything and lacks nothing. Ill buy this every single time I get the chance and never think twice about it. It is the platform to what a barrel aged stout should be.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,PaulyB83,4.57,"Enjoyed on-tap in a 10oz chalice at Shakespeare's Pub in Kalamazoo, MI  A- Jet black like dark espresso. Thin, light mocha head that stays around longer than expected. Noticeable alcohol legs as you swirl the glass. Very tiny amount of light comes through on the edges when you angle the glass.  S- The coffee is the main aroma here, then comes some chocolate, vanilla, booze, dried cherry, and some light oak. I do find that the aroma in this beer is not as in your face as some of the other big bourbon stouts, BCBS, BCBCS, Black Note.  T- Similar to aroma but everything comes across bigger. Coffee, dark dried black cherry, chocolate, vanilla, and a medium-high level of booziness.  M- On the lighter side of heavy, a definite sipper and lies somewhere between Black Note and BCBS.  O- I've had this beer a few times now and when I first had it I was pretty disappointed but slowly I've been able to look past the hype of this beer, in both finding it and the high ratings, and appreciate how well crafted it is. I still prefer BCBS and Black Note to this one, the coffee and chocolate are a bit too much and kind of covers up the barrel too much as opposed to working with it, IMO. Still an amazing beer and worth seeking out and maybe waiting in a not too long line for.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,PlinyTheYounger,4.6,"KBS is a very limited release, and in recent years, the lines for the release have started early in the morning. That said, occasionally you can get some elsewhere. KBS is brewed with a massive amount of chocolate and coffee, then the brewers store it in bourbon barrels in an abandoned mine for 9-12 months to let the bourbon from the barrels soak into the beer.  KBS pours like a typical imperial stout: thick and impossible to see through. The head lasts for the duration of the beer. The notes of chocolate and coffee are strong, and the bourbon really hits on the back end of the beer. Because of the beer is so infused with bourbon, this is not a beer to drink quickly.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,mmars010,3.35,"KBS has lost its luster. Recent years batches have been disappointing. Mass production takes its toll on every beer, but especially barrel aged stouts. I'd rather drink founders bs or porter. Try LA Serpent's Stout instead if you can get it.  A-Dark brown, almost black with decent lacing. Head doesn't stick around long. S-Probably the best aspect.

1199,19960,DesolationAngel,4.79,"I went into my favorite country store to buy milk for my boys and walked out with a four pack of Double Dose and a single of KBS that the owner had hiding in his office for loyal customers.  Opened after work at my bar and shared with a bartender poured into snifters. Looks like my trucks motor oil with 8k miles on it. Actually looks 'thick' as it hits the glass, with little head forming that disappears quickly  . Smells of fresh ground coffee, good whiskey and chocolate.  Tastes as the smell suggests. Dark chocolate, dark roast coffee and a bit of warmth from the well integrated high abv. Just beautiful. Look over to the bartender and she cant believe beer can taste like this. Six months ago she only drank Mich Ultra. This is as advertised.  Mouth feel is thick and creamy like chocolate milk. Coats a bit without cloying.  This beers reputation is well deserved. $7 well spent. We get most of this brewery's product in NH but the stouts are an extreme rarity.

1199,19960,Ljudsignal,4.46,"2012 bottle poured into a stemless tulip. Split with some friends along with a BCBS '12 and a TenFIDY '12. Reviewed from notes.  A cautious ~3oz pour yields a finger-high mocha head, which lingers briefly before settling to a thin collar of bubbles. The beer itself is a deep, rich, dark chocolate color. Spotty, minimal lacing, very little retention...all pretty much as expected.  The nose, in a word, is succulent. Rich dark chocolate, molasses, plums, cherries, fresh coffee, and vanilla all come rushing out of the glass to greet me. Smells like something I want to eat. Smells like something I'm not going to wait any longer to drink.  The taste is complex, robust, and spectacular. Potent French roast, oak, and dark chocolate on the front of the palate give way to a mid-palate blend of richer milky chocolate and dark fruits--plums, cherries, raisins all come to mind. Vanilla makes itself known here as well, and the heat that was present on the front of the palate begins to fade. On the back of the palate notes of leather and mocha appear, before finishing with a slightly dry and lingering espresso-y bitterness and the slightest hints of earthy hop character.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. While the ABV is definitely present and noticeable throughout, the beer is full-bodied and robust enough to handle it without undue stress.  On the whole...what can I say that hasn't already been said? KBS honestly lives up to the hype. Rich and robust while still displaying remarkable subtlety and complexity. I can't wait to be able to try more than a small sample of this beer...but for now, a sample will do very nicely.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,DMarlinJ,4.44,"I am re-reviewing this based on having it on-tap now after first having it from the bottle. I increased my scores because it was noticeably better and having some other big beers to compare it to again, this gets my vote for what I like to drink best. This is as close to perfect for me as it can get based totally on drinking enjoyment and fit to style. It may have some flaws to the beer snobs but I don't care.  I hoped this would live up to it's hype. I love the smell and taste. The head is weak and faded quickly. There is a lot going on in the smell. Wood and bourbon barrel, chocolate and alcohol. It is rich and deep. I keep getting different notes as it warms. Long lasting in smell, stronger than most other beers.  My first impression of taste was milk chocolaty creamy goodness. Then the strong bourbon and oak comes in. Coffee is not as present to me as what I expected from others comments. Nice lingering flavors, nothing off putting. I would rate it higher but I think age can improve it by smoothing out some of bite. So I look forward to next year. I'll save 2 of my 4 for that. After having it on tap, fresher may be better. It was very smooth but I had food with it too. So that may have improved my overall enjoyment of it.  The feel is perfect for me. Creamy, smooth full and rich. Frothy carbonation that is not biting or harsh. A bit sticky lasting coating but I like it. I like how the flavors come out just holding a full mouth and slowly swallowing.  Overall I think the hype is bigger than the beer but it still is a great beer. So much to offer in complexity. There are few beers I may like better for wow factor in flavor and drinkabilty but this is hard to beat. For the price it is definitely worth it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,artoolemomo,4.92,"Appearance- Pours about a finger's worth of head which doesn't retain well but who really cares- this is KBS. The head is a dark beige/mocha color while the body is an opaque, dark chocolate black. No lacing at all.  Nose- Absolutely appetizing. Everything that the aroma of a great imperial stout should have. Dark rich chocolate explodes with notes of coconut and cherries coming soon after. Caramel, toffee, vanilla, and chocolate. It's pretty much a like a lineup of the usual suspects of scents in great imperial stouts. Lots of chocolate fudge brownie such that this one note tends to drown out the others. Also suggest truffles and macaroons.  Taste- Replete with the notes of the aroma only to a larger degree. The coffee really stands out much more and gives a great contrast to the whole chocolate fudge brownie while blending in with it at the same time. Large notes of cherries and a good amount of heat but this heat works very well. Knowing that this is released in April makes it that more impressive. This six month old bottle still has tons of presence and complexity and thankfully, the heat is still there. The coffee is dominant and at times, that bothers me in stouts but this is so well rounded that I'm really enjoying it. It doesn't have a sour linger and doesn't succumb to being too sweet- it's simply really good coffee. Slight licorice on the tip of my tongue. The deepness of the fudge is remarkable as well- the two main aspects of this beer really constructively contrast one another. The heat starts to fade, making this a truly dangerous beer. Plus this is so well balanced and blended, it's difficult to make out individual notes but I can guarantee you that every note of the aroma is present in the flavor profile to some degree. I think this is easily going to land in my top ten and mostly likely, my top five. Slight leather and tobacco notes. But this is really about the coffee. The more I drink it (and as it warms up) notes of bourbon and oak start to appear, giving an already complex beer an increased richness. I can only wonder what Canadian Breakfast Stout tastes like. The bourbon aspects tend to linger in the back of my throat.  Mouthfeel- Thick and heavy bodied. Lots of syrup to the point that it's almost ropy. Good amount of carbonation but this doesn't get in the way at all.  Drinkability- In a way, the incredible richness and complexity inclines you to sip. This is not to say that it is not incredibly drinkable (because it is), it is to say that this beer is so intriguing it gives you pause. It reminds me a lot of BCBS but with coffee. Which makes me think if I can't get any BCBCS because of the increased distribution, I am definitely swearing off Goose Island. I don't care that you're in bed with InBev, but I do care if I can't get your good stuff. This is easily worth 6 bucks a bottle. I wouldn't think twice about buying this at 20 bucks for a 750.  Overall- Amazing. Outstanding. Should you try this? You know you should try this. You don't need my recommendation",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

What struck me most was how balanced this beer is in the aroma and flavor. The appearance was deep black in color with a thick ringlet of mocha foam around the edges. Due in part from the high ABV's most likely. The aroma was simply fantastic with many different smells that played off each other. Plenty of roasted malts, coffee and dark chocolates, creamy vanilla, oak, and bourbon. The aroma was complex, sutle and worked well together. The taste was equally fantastic, more so actually. Bold and sutle, sweet and bitter with great deapth of flavor. Roasted malts, creamed coffee, milk chocolate, vanilla cream, oak peat and bourbon and the list goes on. There is a sweetness that reigns in all the flavors, mellowing them out nicely. At the end is a refined bourbon taste that warms and coats the tongue and mouth. On the palate it drinks like a medium thick weight. It flows over the palate with the greatest of ease. Sticky sweetness lingers into a semi bitter and dry aftertaste. It's interesting how the nose suggest a more robust dry and bitter taste say like a black coffee but it drinks smooth and creamy like coffee and cream. Perfectly aged.  WOW.

Smell: sweet and rich; roasty without being acrid. There's a deep bouquet of fruit flavors, almost like a quadrupel. Oaky, vanilla and bourbon notes from the long barrel aging, but nothing over the top. A well-balanced, well-considered, and very enticing aroma.  Taste: the flavor has a little bit more edge to it than the aroma. Darkly fruity right up front with a good coffee character coming through -- something that was much less prevalent in the aroma. There's definitely a harsher bitterness in the flavor, probably from all the roast. There's also that characteristic vegetal hop aftertaste, which, while it's not my favorite thing, is kind of integral to the style. I love the deep, dark fruitiness, though.

Coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, tar, and roast malt begin the aroma. Decidedly coffee dominant, with enough bourbon and oak to add complexity to the roast malt character without overwhelming.  Luxurious is the only way to really describe the flavor. Sweet, rich malt balances the slightly bitter coffee, dark chocolate, and roast malt elegantly, while vanilla and toasted oak provide contrast. The finish is fairly dry and roasty. Coffee is definitely the prominent flavor, but it completely lacks acrid character, and it doesn't dominate. Bourbon gives it excellent complexity. Dark fruit notes of bruised cherries emerge late. Chocolate and bourbon ball character really comes out as it warms.  Body is full, smooth, creamy, and luscious. Carbonation is low, and alcohol warmth is significant, but not at all offputting.

I NEVER thought I'd get a chance to try this beer. So after I made a mess in my pants I finally had the chance to give the almighty KBS a shot.  This is a beer that definitely lives up to the hype. Bell's Expedition Stout was the king in my books, but it's been dethroned. KBS is easily one of the most well balanced and delicious beers I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. HUGE bourbon, coffee, chocolate, cognac, and vanilla flavors that blend so well together it almost makes me angry.  As far as stouts go, this is one of the smoothest, most easy drinking stouts I've got my hands on. And this beer's 11.2% ABV. Dangerously drinkable, dangerously delicious, and just plain flat-out incredible. My only complaint is the mouthfeel wasn't as creamy as I expected it to be, and that's really all I can complain about. This is an absolutely must have beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,joe1510,4.63,"12oz. Bottle $19.99 4-Pack Binny's Orland  Kentucky Breakfast Stout pours black as night. Viscous body that gurgles into my snifter. A chocolate half finger head formed on the pour that faded to a ring. The ring leaves ringed lacing after each drink. Very handsome beer.  Big notes of coffee and vanilla. This beer absolutely makes my mouth water. Mild bourbon and oak. The coffee smells freshly brewed and hot. This very easily could be the best smelling beer I've ever had the opportunity to smell.  The flavor is as good as the smell. One of the best beers I've ever tasted. Starts off with freshly brewed coffee and cream. Mild vanilla up front. Mid palate the coffee gets stronger and is accompanied by hazelnut, a splash of bourbon, and even a little hop spiciness. Excellent!  Mouthfeel is perfect. Thick and creamy body. Sluggish carbonation lets the beer work through my mouth velvety smooth.  There is no doubt about this beer being a sipper but it's one that I could sip from the moment I rolled out of bed until I fell back asleep.  This is one special brew. I wasn't sure if this would live up to all the talk or not. It lives up to and surpasses the talk. One of the best beers I've experienced in my drinking days.

1199,19960,BlackBelt5112203,4.85,"HUGE, HUGE, HUGE thanks to beersndrums for this one. I’m just starting to realize how many awesome beers I’ve gotten to try because of this guy. Really an awesome dude!  12 oz bottle poured into a snifter at cellar temperature.  L – Jet black color with a 1.5-finger frothy, rocky, brown head. Great retention and fantastic sheets of lacing. Very viscous.  S – One of the best-smelling stouts that I’ve ever had the pleasure of smelling. There’s a perfect blend of tons of chocolate and coffee, vanilla and oak from the bourbon barrels, and rich dark fruits like plums and currants. All of the aromas are in the perfect proportion and work so well together.  T – It starts off sweet with chocolate, molasses, vanilla, and dark fruit flavors and rapidly picks up a wonderful bourbon and oak flavor. As the dryness from those two flavors builds, bitter roasted coffee appears and also continues to build. Once the coffee starts to fade, beautiful bittersweet dark chocolate comes in to finish up the taste. While bourbon flavors are certainly apparent, alcohol is not. This beer is absolutely delicious.  F – Full-bodied, more carbonation than expected, a silky-smooth, velvety, and sticky mouthfeel, and a bittersweet and dry finish. Coffee, dark chocolate, and bourbon flavors linger along with a smooth throat-warmth from the alcohol.  O – This beer is fantastic and everything that I dreamed it would be. It looks fantastic, has one of the best aromas I can remember, tastes heavenly, and has a great mouthfeel to back it up. It comes close to perfection and is by far my favorite bourbon barrel-aged stout that I’ve had so far. I love bourbon but I don’t want it to overshadow the beer when the two are blended. I think Founders absolutely nailed the blend. The bourbon flavors and aromas are present without any boozy sting. I really wish this beer was more readily available because it’s too good to only be able to get a bottle or two via trading. Maybe my luck will change in the future and I’ll be able to find more. In the meantime, thank you SO much, Jared, for the chance to try this wonderful, wonderful beer!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,Bosoxfan20,3.76,"A big thanks to my buddy Brian Welzbacher, founder of Beer Is OK, for providing me with this tasty treat. Aged about 6 months  A- Pitch black with an outstanding 1 finger head that hangs around for a while . Magnificent lacing and impressive retention. Beautiful as can be.  S- Smelled of delicious coffee and cocoa upon first take. Amazingly different aroma the second time around. Almost like a new beer. Bourbon, oak, and booze on the second take. There is certainly some layers of complexity at work here.  T- Huge coffee, cocoa beans, and malted milk riding on an intense wave of bourbon barrel character. Espresso with a perfect amount of hop supplements the beer and creates a welcoming balance. Lots of roasted goodness along with the warm booze builds a nice complexity.  M- Full flavor, full body. A bit boozy fut not too distracting. Creamy, chewy, still smooth til the last drop. Goes down way too damn easy. Damn you Founders!  O- Very impressive brew that can be quite difficult to find out my way. I was hoping some aging would take the edge off some and bring out more of the chocolate flavors, but it could have probably used another 6-12 months.

Smells of lots of roasted coffee, some bourbon, oak, vanilla, roasted malts, some dark chocolate. Taste starts with coffee, dark chocolate, some oak, and roasted malts. Then the middle brings more sweetness. Notes of molasses and carmel join the darker coffee, chocolate, and roasty notes. The finish is just fantastic. Strong, yet not overbearing notes of bourbon, vanilla, and oak come into the picture and meld with the now stronger notes of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. The bourbon, oak, and vanilla get stronger as it warms; yet it does not get hot at all. It simply makes the beer more complex and flavorful. Surprisingly thin for a beer of this magnitude. High medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Not enough good things to say about this beer. It’s smoothness makes it stand out from a lot of other barrel aged stouts. Extremely well done.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,Donco,4.9,"Edit to review (3/18/16): Just tried a bottle of 2016 KBS and it's the best fresh version I've had since I began drinking beer in 2013.   2015 from a bottle. Although I had rated this beer highly back in 2013, I had not reviewed it. So now (March 2015) I am adding comments on this beer fresh. Look is reminiscent of Founders Imperial Stout. Jet black with a bit of head when poured into my Founders tulip glass. Smell: Wonderful bourbon/coffee as it warms. Taste: Better than last year's version when fresh. Let this warm from fridge for at least 25 minutes. Then beautiful coffee/bourbon/chocolate comes out with a significant hit of bitterness on the end (again, like Founders IS). To me, this year's version is better than 2014 and well worth the crazy search. Even better with about 6 month aging.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,BEERMILER12,4.63,"A: Pours a pitch black color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a nice cap that leaves some good initial lacing  S: Lots of roasted malt along with bourbon, vanilla, oak, coffee, and dark chocolate. Light bitterness underneath everything  T: Starts off with the roasted malts, bourbon, oak, and vanilla. Goes into a solid dark chocolate and coffee. The dark chocolate is nice and fudgy, almost like a dark chocolate brownie. Finishes with more of the roast, vanilla, and a hint of alcohol  M: Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation  O: Truly a great brew. My only complaint is with the mouthfeel, which is a little thinner side but still not a major hangup. Not quite as good as BCBCS, but it's right up there",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,MadScientist,4.78,"A: A black beer with think, creamy dark brown head. The head is thin but long lasting and easily roused.  S: A rich nose loaded with strong chocolate, coffee, caramel, a vanilla oak character and bourbon aromas. There is a fair amount of carmel to toffee like sweetness, some licorice and a medium floral alcohol sweetness. No hops to speak off.  T: The same flavors as in the nose with the coffee and chocolate leading the pack at first then the vanilla and cinnamon oak flavors take over mid-palate along with the caramel malt sweetness and bourbon. A lot of the dark roast character along with just a hint of charcoal are tasted throughout. There is a medium hops bitterness with the balance being about even but slightly towards the malt sweetness. The finish is semi-sweet with a lingering aftertaste of coffee, roast, bourbon and chocolate.  M: A full bodied beer with a medium level of carbonation. A medium amount of alcohol warmth sits solid on the throat and chest.  O: The flavor and fanfare is everything this beer has claimed to be; a stout richly layered with balanced flavors of roast, chocolate, coffee and bourbon barrel aging.

T: Coffee upfront, balanced with a sharp bourbon bite - although its far from being what I would call overbearing. Tons of bitter chocolate, comes across like a thick chocolate milk. The finish and aftertaste is consumed by sweet vanilla, which brings everything together perfectly.  M: Full body. Creamy. Moderate carbonation. Booze is hidden well.  O: Founders can do no wrong, and this one is no different. It lives up to the hype. The balance in this one is incredible.

1199,19960,cardsfan,3.83,"Was super excited to try this after all the hype. Aged one year (might have been the problem). Appearance was typical for this style...however expected it to be thicker. Smell was bourboney but still underwhelming. Kind of browny esque. Taste, didn't get a ton of bourbon but lots of dark chocolate. Still just not for what I was hoping. Mouthful was probably the worst part...very thin and just not a lot of substance.  This is what I love about beer..this is highly rated and while it's good it just reminds me that taste is subjective.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,CarlosDanger,3,"Taste is subjective.  I just don't get this one.  Perhaps it's the limited availability, the price, the cult (sort-of) following, or perhaps this style of beer just isn't my cup of tea, but I just couldn't get myself to enjoy it.  Appearance was dark, Coca-cola-like, and the head was caramel in color. I wouldn't classify it as beautiful but certainly not offensive.  I'm going to address taste and mouthfeel together: syrupy, sweet, boozy. Again, it wasn't offensive, and as I've said in other reviews I'm a newbie, but I just don't understand how anyone can drink more than a few sips of this beer. I could see it being awesome in a flight. Or poured over vanilla ice cream?  I think taste and experience and all those things associated with them are a collective, subjective experience. In KBS's defense the hype surrounding this beer is off the charts. People posting photos of themselves with KBS bottles as if they were holding the holy grail. And if this style of beer is your bag, then by all means, go for it.  I also think value comes into play as well. When I got my bottle at the beer distributor, they only had one left. It was like $12! I was prepared to buy two 4-packs because of the hype.

1199,19960,LambicPentameter,4.27,"Enjoyed out of a 12 oz brown bottle that I was luckily able to procure from the madhouse that was the Founders tap takeover event at Bier Station in Kansas City on July 1st. I must caveat my review by saying that I'm reviewing based on only a 6 oz pour, as I couldn't bring myself not to share with my two buddies who weren't so lucky in getting their hands on a bottle at the event. Poured into a small, tumbler-shaped 8 oz tasting glass.  Appearance - Like looking into a black hole, with the viscous inky liquid seeming to move in slow motion when sloshed. The head is fairly sparse, with an--at best--one finger mocha colored head that dissipates to a bubbly layer of foam on top of the liquid, about a quarter finger thick. Some larger bubbles are interspersed. Just what I would expect from an enormous barrel-aged imperial stout.  Smell - A symphony of coffee, bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, and bourbon, with undertones of oaky vanilla and some alcoholic esters hinting at how much of a wallop the taste is going to pack. I also detect a bit of sweetness, much like what you might expect from a milk stout. A delicious smelling beer--here's hoping the flavor lives up to it.  Taste - Here, the booze is more present than in the aroma, which was dominated by the espresso and cocoa nib notes. Now, the bourbon is very much on display, being complimented by the softer profiles of the oak and vanilla. Not to worry, however, as the traditional stout profiles make their presence known and prevent this from becoming an unbalanced whiskey bomb. I think I prefer the smell better, but the taste is definitely quite good.  Mouthfeel - Viscous and thick, like drinking a boozy beer milkshake. Carbonation is fairly low, but actually not as low as some BA beers that I've had. There's enough of it to provide a bit of a bite to the otherwise thick beverage. Finish is semi-sweet, from the chocolate and oak.  Overall, a beer that certainly lives up to the hype. I think personally, I prefer the standard FBS to this modified version, but that's mostly an individual taste issue than anything else. And since this one is so damn hard to get hands on, I imagine I will continue to drink FBS to get my imperial stout fix from Founders.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smells almost of an old workshop full of wood. Great! Espresso is huge as well, complex and changes. Remarkable nose.  T - Starts at front with oakiness with the coffee. This alone is a great combination. Then comes the bitter chocolate bite, and following that is the bourbon. You can tell there is a decent ABV here (11.2%). Slight booziness at finish, leaves warm mouth feel. The wave over the palate is phenomenal.  M - Full bodied and buttery. Leaves a velvety coat on your mouth. Warm at the end. Not the most drinkable (ABV, duh). Lingering feel/taste is very appealing.  O - Been aging for 6 months. Couldn't take it an longer! Great stout.

Fermented dark fruits come through as it warms, along with a touch of sweetness.  T: Very mellow for what I anticipated, extremely well balanced for such a bold beer. Bourbon is present but doesnt over power like it tends to with most aged beers, this time it feels like the flavor is in the beer not simply an addition. Chocolate provides an almost milk stout quality.  M: Creamy, velvety and very smooth. Booze are far from hot making the alcohol fairly hidden. Mild carbonation, full body.

Thin dark chocolate coffee brown head which fizzes out quickly leaving an extremely thin layer around the inside of the glass and on top of the body; some chunky lacing left behind, I think more so now than fresh. I thought it would smooth out a bit more, creating ""legs"" with the bourbon, etc. Color almost black. Coffee aroma has dissipated somewhat at this point, leaving sweet and boozy chocolate with some oak. Taste is similar; less coffee, more sweet vanilla and bourbon coming through now. Sweet bourbon is prominent. Mouthfeel seems to have balanced out a bit more, both bitter and smooth now, I'd say a tad less creamy. Light carbonation. Going to let this one sit and breath for awhile.

1199,19960,jegross2,4.52,"Reviewing the 2011 vintage of KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout) (2011) from Founders Brewing Company out of Grand Rapids, Michigan. This is one of Founders' most well-known beers and probably their most sought out special annual release that is bottled. I have not been a fan of the 2012 or 2013 vintages, so I thought I would dig into my cellar to revisit the last year I recall enjoying this brew. I originally reviewed this vintage of KBS back in January 2012.  Score: 96  March 2011 vintage bottle served in a Founders' snifter and enjoyed on 07/07/13. Review is from iPhone notes.  Appearance: Pours a jet black color with minimal head. Poor lacing and retention. 3.75/5  Smell: Stale coffee, vanilla, oak, and lots of chocolate. A little ""old stout"" smell and cocoa too. Still smells nice, but not nearly as sublime as when it was fresh. 4.25/5  Taste: One of the reasons this beer is so great is that it used to be so balanced (the last couple of years have been overly acidic/bitter in my opinion). The bitter chocolate and coffee in this vintage counters the sweet barrel and sweet chocolate notes. This bottle has become drier and more bitter with age, but it is not acidic or acrid. Despite being one of the post-vanilla vintages and two years, I still detect ample vanilla notes from the bourbon without the oak or brown sugar -- a lovely quality I think is quite lacking in the recent two years. Dark chocolate is also present, and there is less coffee than nose. Has an ""old roastiness"" quality to the flavor that I love. The vanilla present is mostly upfront, with the drier/bitter favors prevalent on the finish. The complexity of this brew really shines as it flows from the front of the tongue to the back, and it opens up nicely as it warms. 4.75/5  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, minimal carbonation. The mouthfeel has lost a little of the smoothness as it has dried out with age. The finish no longer leans sweet, and is arguably more balanced from the bitterness that has grown a bit in the flavor profile with age. I originally claimed it was a better beer than fresh Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout, but I think it's a slight notch below how the 2011 vintage is currently drinking. 4.75/5  Overall: As was the case with 2008 KBS, 2011 KBS is not quite the same beast that it was fresh (it was near perfect then), but I think that it is still drinking quite nicely with age and better than the fresher vintages. The coffee has faded a little and the brew has dried out some, but that has lent it a slightly better balance. I was surprised by how much vanilla I detected in this bottle considering that it is a post-vanilla vintage. Give me properly cellared KBS over the newer releases any day; hopefully Founders gets KBS back on track in 2014.  Cost: $5 for a 12 oz bottle.  ---  Reviewing the infamous KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout) from Founders Brewing Company. This beer was offered as part of a special bourbon themed beer tapping at the Brickhouse BBQ in Madison -- one of my favorite restaurants in the area. Due to a misunderstanding, a friend attending the event and GREAT customer service on the part of Brickhouse, I was able to enjoy a glass of KBS with my meal! Score: 98  10 oz pour served in a globe glass from a 2011 vintage keg tapped at the Brickhouse BBQ on 01/21/12.  Appearance: The body is a completely opaque, jet black color -- almost looks like used motor oil. Served with no head save for a thin dark tan ring around the glass. Leaves an oily film of lacing along the side of the glass. 4.5/5  Smell: Dark chocolate, light vanilla, burnt sugar and smooth bourbon. Some tobacco and dark fruit. A very rich, slightly sweet aroma. 5/5  Taste: Dark, chewy chocolate and sweet raisins/fig upfront with a smooth bourbon and vanilla backbone throughout. There is no real alcohol bite to the bourbon. Some brown sugar and marshmallow on the midpalate. Increasing levels of bourbon marinated dark fruit flavors. Leathery tobacco. Lightly oaky/woody flavors mixed in there too. Finish is sweet bourbon soaked raisins and oaky chocolate. The raisin/bourbon flavors of the finish really linger. 5/5  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, minimal carbonation. Mouthfeel is silky smooth. Finish is a little sweet, but not nearly as ""sweet"" as Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout. 5/5  Overall: A ridiculously flavorful, balanced stout. Definitely a sipper, but this is not a beer you'd want to chug anyways. KBS is loaded with sweet robust stout flavors with all the deliciousness of bourbon without the alcohol bite. If not for Bourbon County Brand Stout, KBS would be my favorite barrel aged beer. This is a brew to seek out.  Recommendation: A must-seek out brew for everyone who can stomach any degree of bourbon flavors. I was not a fan of bourbon flavors in beer until recently, and even back in the day I enjoyed this beer.  Pairings: Duck legs or roasted duck.  Cost: $19.99 for a four pack.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,StoutItOutLoud,4.4,"2013 vintage. 12-oz bottle to tulip. This is my second dance with this bad boy, the first being a few days after the brewery's release at the end of March. (Initial ""had"" rating was 4.25.) Consumed with a light dinner of grilled chicken, grilled zucchini, and salad on the 4th of July, over the course of an hour, to assess any development in the beer's aroma and taste. I did not sense much change throughout the session.  Initial, soft pour of a few ounces shows that this is a viscous, dark brown brew, with slow bubbling on a surface as quiet as a swamp. The full pour shows it is opaque black with 1-finger mocha brown head. The head dissipates to a lingering 1/2-finger size. The alcohol legs are decent, but this beer does not coat the glass for long.  Oak and vanilla, giving way to rich dark chocolate syrup and molasses. The alcohol does not overpower. It is faint. Interestingly, I did not sense much coffee, either in the aroma or taste, throughout the session (though there is a roast bitterness taste as the glass warms).  Dark chocolate gives way quickly to bourbon at first, with molasses and prune developing later in the session. As with an actual piece of dark chocolate, the inherent bitterness overtakes the sweetness as the glass warms, but vanilla begins to show its head in the last few drops as well.  The mouthfeel is oily and thick, with little to no carbonation. The beer lingers in the back of the palate, but this is not a lipsmacker.  Overall, there are better-tasting bourbon-barrel-aged stouts out there, in particular the ridiculously smooth Black Note and Baudoinia.  The uptick in my score accounts for the phenomenal aroma.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,nmann08,4.55,"2012 Vintage  Pours a thick dark black, soft tan head, a bit low on the carbonation on the pour, but the head still appeared.  Smell is roasted coffee, molasses, chocolate, hints of oak and vanilla. The smells are very distinct, don't have to think hard to find them.  The taste is boozy up front. Still very hot. Bourbon. Roasty espresso in the middle, with dark chocolate and bitterness on the end.  Great mouthfeel. Very smooth, full on the mouth, milky finish.  Overall, this is a great beer, but still needs at least another year on it, maybe 2 before it hits its stride.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,velcrogrip,4.84,"Absolutely incredible beer. Served in a CCB Hunahpu Snifter. Not as strong of bourbon smell or flavor as I expected, but just an incredible flavor. Strong Bold coffee, first and foremost, in both the smell and taste. Mild vanilla. Bourbon came through more as the chill came off and beer rose toward room temperature.

Lots going on in this beer....Molasses, chocolate, coffee, custard, and even a slight bourbon aroma.  T - Wow. Doesnt get much better than this. Very similar to the smell. Hints of choclate, coffee, buts, bourbon. I love the chocolate custard I'm picking up. Wish I had a few more o these sitting around  M - A very heavy beer. Nice a creamy. definately warms the mouth. Surprisingly very smooth for a beer that is 11.2%!  O - Love this beer. It was the first time I was fortunate enough to have one. Its like no beer I've ever had.

1199,19960,TheNightwatchman,4.92,"A legend. What else is there to say in that regard?  A - Dark. Almost black. Light brown head that quickly dissipates. Lacing is minimal in my glass at least. Exactly how I expect a bottle poured stout to look.  S - Delicious. Coffee is the first thing I smell, a slight hint of chocolate, and a noticeable whiskey smell. The whiskey smell definitely comes through more as the beer warms up. A slight hint of alcohol, which also intensifies as the beer warms.  T - Coffee is the first thing I get, follow by the bourbon. The bourbon is there, but it never really threatens to overpower the other flavors. I prefer a bourbon barrel aged beer to taste this way. I personally don't want the bourbon to overpower the other flavors. I get chocolate on the finish, along with a slight alcohol hit.  M - Sweet, sticky as it warms up. A bit oily. Nothing unpleasant to speak of. Carbonation is very subdued, and never threatens to be noticed.  O - Outstanding beer. Very complex. Coffee, chocolate, and bourbon are your primary flavors, as they're advertised to be. Truly an outstanding beer.

1199,19960,GarthDanielson,4.94,"2013 Vintage. Poured from a bottle into mug, the beer is jet black, and pours heavy, with no head and only the slightest dark brown ring of film around the surface. It literally poured like motor oil, and it looks delicious. Aromas of wood and earth, with a backbone of rich chocolate and touches of smoke, highlighted by booze. Flavors are robust, with a smoky, woody forward flavor followed quickly by dark, bitter baker's chocolate and rich, full, roasted coffee. Wow, this one is layered, and it is unbelievably smooth. Smoke and roast fills the senses, as well as the palate, throughout each drink. Creamy vanilla highlights, with a warming sensation from the heightened ABV. This is tremendous. Smooth, full, and creamy in mouth, with an almost velvet feel. Roast and coffee on the aftertaste, with hints of booze. Dry, roasted finish, with a smoked and woody linger.

Some molasses and vanilla are apparent as well. Some bitterness in the finish. Great balance. When compared to Parabola the sweetness was a tad much, the coffee is much stronger than in other Imperial Stouts.  M-Thick and syrupy. Very smooth.  O-Wow. Going to DLD was worth it for this beer. I can't believe how easy drinking as smooth this great tasting beer is.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Brenden,4.87,"Finally.  KBS is black with that ""motor oil"" viscosity present in such a big stout. The brown head is surprising; it's not huge, but it's actually pretty large. It's also thick, creamy, dense and a bit craggy, and it's got some stick to it, making itself known by way of heavy patching in good quantities. The nose is big. The nose is robust. The nose is massively malty. A huge blending of powdered, creamy milk, and bittersweet chocolate, cold-brewed coffee, roast, barley, vanilla, and oak, with expressive but not overpoweringly boozy bourbon make for what had to be exactly what this beer was going for. The bourbon, in fact, doesn't show off just ethanol; it's the good stuff, and it's the right level for this beer. Perfect. This stuff is stupidly complex, big rich, and delicious. Everything from the nose is here, from milky and bittersweet chocolate to fresh coffee to wood to vanilla to bourbon, along with something like a hint of cherry. Then, as if it's not enough, there's even a dose of hops; and the hops still let the malts dominate. Roast gives way to the slightest bit of char. it's just so close to perfect...I almost wonder if just the faintest hint more bourbon would do it. Big, thick, rich, robust, creamy to the point of being like the even smoother love child of velvet and silk, this is everything you want when an imperial stout is making love to your mouth. Somehow it's this big, this viscous and hearty, without being overly filling. I wouldn't have thought it possible.  Jump on the hype train, because there's a reason it left the station.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,pjkelley82,3.84,"Finally got a chance to try it out at a Founders event a craft pub by me was running. It started at 8 o'clock and I was in front of the bar at 7:58 giving the bartender that stare.  Well 8 o'clock came and I was pored an 8oz serving into a stemed Sniffer glass from which they had on tap.  Very dark color with a small antique white/cranberry colored head.  Smell was all Bourbon with notes of chocolate and dark fruit but the alcohol was also very noticeable on the nose....  To me it was balanced in taste.... got alot of the boozy bourbon taste up front but everything else in it blended well together and complimented each other. If one flavor dominated for me it was the coffee... but the coffee flavor was excellent... really good coffee had to be used cause it was very bold and just tasted like a very good bean.  A minute or so later the Bakers chocolate stranded out in the aftertaste.  Moutfeel was full but thin, easy to sip but the alcohol is there with warmth.  Overall.... my unicorn of beers is down and to be honest I was let down. I am going to eventually try it again but to me we had a bad batch or something. Maybe cause I had it in June (out of season) and it's no where to be found anywhere else, I doubt it... but you never know. It was way too boozy/barell-y taste for me. I've tasted 10,11,12 percent abv that tasted like there was no alcohol. Alcohol was very prominent in this one. It was excellently balanced and good but in my opinion not top 10 worthy... in fact I tasted 5 other beers that night and KBS was the 4th best I had... Definitely try it... age it.... buy it... but don't get your hopes up.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,JRO,4.14,"This was the 2013 iteration, which was notably different than last years. The bar that served this up to me notified me that it was $13 a pint (pint?!?!?), to which I asked if they served it in a snifter (thinking the bartender made a mistake). She told me they could do a half-pint for $10. Uh, ok, I'll take the pint. And two snifter-esque glasses. Worked out well since I had a friend to share it with, but pretty funny. 9 barrels were allocated to WI, and this place got one. Very delicious, as usual. This year seemed distinctively more chocolate-forward and less bourbony than in years past. Nonetheless, it is a very well-balanced and delightful brew. Not quite a top 10 beer, in my opinion, but still very very good. You should drink it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,TheCuriograph,4.83,"First time. Long time want. Bottle into a pairing glass.  A: Black and viscous, like molasses. Impenetrable with a fine, lacy tan head.  S: Dark roast coffee, smoky wood, ethanol, vanilla bean, chocolate maltiness. The bourbon is present but nowhere near as dominant as, say, BCBS.  T: That is a medley. All the stuff you’d expect – chocolate, vanilla, coffee – but the bourbon is so well integrated. The tangy and oakiness up front easily subsides into the chocolate-coffee body, but the vanilla at the end gives it a fine resolution and makes you desperate for another sip. The booze is noticeable but well masked.  M: Certainly heavy like a stout, but oddly light for the style. Substantial but not overbearing.  This is what I call an upsettingly good beer. It’s so tasty and well-crafted and drinkable I become angry I cannot have more. Yes, there are plenty of other wonderful imperial stouts (Peche, Parabola, Ten FIDY, Speedway), but KBS is a revelatory brew.

1199,19960,fmccormi,4.31,"Straight pour from a 12oz pry-off bottle to my Cigar City snifter; no bottling date that I can see, but this is the 2013 release, so it’s been about two months since it was released.  Appearance (3.5): Maybe half a finger of cappuccino-colored head comes off of the pour before dying down relatively quickly, leaving just a thin foam ring around the edge of the body. The body is pitch black but shows some deep amber tones around the edge when held up to the light. Not a whole lot of retention, the head having fizzled away and left just a couple of wide, flat legs of lace on the near side of the glass. I s’pose it fits the style, but I like more head, personally.  Smell (4.25): Lots of dark chocolate and French roast coffee lying underneath it—high-cacao content cocoa powder and fresh coffee grinds, all mixed with woody, rich vanilla tones (clearly the bourbon coming through here), and a low-level roasted grain character (like burned toast?) and a little smokiness. Not as intense as I was anticipating, but the elements are all very good and very well-balanced.  Taste (4.5): Much more of that wonderful, high cacao dark chocolate character mixed with cold-brew black coffee, a little rich molasses sweetness to smooth things out underneath, and some more of that smooth vanilla, bourbon-y component, but without the boozy heat you’d expect from a lot of –bbl stouts (and other styles). The booze does come through in the way the chocolate-coffee combo kind of evaporates away in your mouth, but that’s it—not too bad. The mildly oaky, vanilla tone helps smooth out any bitterness that the coffee, chocolate, hops, or roasted malt might be contributing, leaving just a moderate bitterness that opens up in the finish into a slightly boozy, roasty vaporous character.  Mouthfeel (4.25): On the full side of medium-weight but not heavy, with only a modestly syrupy feel. The carbonation is moderate, with just a bit of tingle here and there accompanied by a soft, slow foaming action. This is very smooth, and kind of hard to drink slowly.  Overall (4.25): This is a very, very good beer. Is it excellent? Maybe. Is it the best imperial stout I’ve ever had? No. That might actually go to (at this date) Founders Imperial Stout. But this does bourbon barrel aging better than 95% of other such beers, which I’m thankful for (’cause a lot of ’em can’t balance their shit very well). But this is a very, very good imperial stout with excellent chocolate and coffee components and a well-played barrel component, too.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smell is of black coffee and dark chocolate along with a mild bourbon sweetness.  Taste is very dry with a ton of bitter black coffee and dark chocolate. The bourbon barrels add a nice sweetness to it and really helps to balance out what I think would be a very bitter and dry stout. The taste lingers around for a long time and just continues to develop.  The mouthfeel is wonderful with the perfect consistency of not too thin and not too viscous. A slight burst of tiny bubbles that work on your tongue amazingly.  One of the best balanced and complex stouts out there. Nothing over the top. Just a perfectly executed stout.

T: This was one of the first beers I fell in love with and is one of those beers that I seek out with a vengeance each year it is released. When relatively fresh, as this bottle is, the initial flavor is that of melted chocolate. The bitterness of the coffee then creeps in and cuts some of the sweetness.

As it started to warm up, the bourbon aroma became more pronounced.  While the beer was chilled, tasted almost like a mocha. I was getting primarily sweet chocolate and coffee. It's almost like coffee with a sugar packet and cocoa stirred in. Once again as it warmed up the bourbon flavor became more pronounced. It was not overwhelming, barrel-aged to perfection. I've tried beers that had too much barrel-aged flavor but this is not one of them. The beer is also bitter at the finish. It had a heavy mouthfeel and just sits around the tongue.

1199,19960,CMUbrew,4.78,"12oz bottle into a Founders snifter  A: Pours thick and viscous and is midnight black in color. Dark brown head forms on the pour and soon fades to a ring. Filmy bubbles float on parts of the surface.  S: Right after the pour coffee leads the nose, but not overpoweringly so. Chocolate is noticeable also and smells on the sweeter side. The bourbon nose does not show up until after some warming, first coming on as a nice meld with the coffee and chocolate, and then eventually taking center stage and pushing the other smells into the back seat as the beer becomes even warmer.  T: Heavenly. The flavor is simply a perfect amalgamation of coffee, chocolate, and bourbon. All these awesome flavors come together to create the finest flavor experience I've ever had in a beer. No single flavor overpowers any other, and the bourbon barrels have worked awesome magic to lend a fine bourbon quality that just blends in so well. Bourbon can be so overdone in beers, but that is not even remotely the case here. There is simply a perfect harmony of flavor in this stout.  M: Full, creamy, smooth. Very, very light carbonation, but just enough. A year in barrels has made this beer so velvety smooth it's ridiculous.  O: A must-try for any lover of beer.

Its thick and chewy. Founders nailed this because its not too sweet. It has enough to hold up the body, but is still dry enough that I could drink a few of these if it wouldnt kill me, and then Id be all out =( The bourbon flavor in this is amazing. They nailed everything about this beer.  This beer deserves 100. The only thing Founders could do to improve it is MAKE A LOT MORE!!!! It was HARD to get this year in MN. ( make it year round too.

1199,19960,StonedTrippin,4.54,"a huge thanks to drlovemd87 for making this a reality. he is a gentleman and a classy BA. the holy grail here, it pours a chocolate brown color, dense and creamy looking, with an inch or so of espresso colored head that doesn't budge. the nose is awesomely coffee heavy. not acidic, but bright and mellow at the same time. some mild dark chocolate notes, a ton of roast, but not bitter at all. the flavor really features this coffee, somehow with a neutral ph. the ultra roasted barley gives an almost smoky flavor, while the chocolate stays in the background. I am most blown away how I taste no alcohol at all in this beer. the founders imperial is hotly alcoholic, in this beer, its totally hidden, even though its stronger. some bourbon hints with char and vanilla come through, but this beer isn't sweet at all. not teeth coating, not heavy. its remarkable how drinkable it really is. the coffee feature is as good as it gets, almost weirdly refreshing, like an iced coffee. the depth and complexity of this fine ale is second to none, and the perfection of its craftsmanship is mind boggling. I cant remember a beer so highly hyped that delivers as well as this gem does, save pliny the younger. its that good. thanks again to drlovemd87, youre a bloody legend mate!  edit: did an interesting taste test last night, a currant vintage in the large format against a really old little bottle, not sure how old because there was no visible date on it, but it had to be no newer than 2011, maybe 2010, so its got at least seven or eight years on it, maybe more. its held up really well, although the coffee has certainly faded. i found the new one to be richer but also enormously alcoholic by comparison. both feel smooth and dense and slick, both have a ton of dark chocolate character, and both stood out as incredible to me. this was a little more unique and dramatic back when nobody else made beer like this, now everyone does, but this one still stands out as one of the best. the difference between the vintages was striking, but i loved them both!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I was excited to pour it, it smelled of espresso, chocolate, and (my fave) bourbon. Poured a nice dark head that only dissipated after a few sips. But my hopes dissipated with its head. There was nothing...it tasted like a coffee infused beer. Don't get me wrong, I love those, but there was no bourbon to be had.

I'm having this next to Black Butte XXVI and The Abyss. (OMG, did I really just write that? Pinch me!)  I'm surprised by how less blown away I am, this time around. I'm having to lower my 2014 score (4.71). The first two sips are just as amazing as I remember from 2014 -- the vanilla of the bourbon kicks ass. But every sip after that, the flavor gets more and more reduced to charred bitterness. Disappointing.  But can I mention again what an insane lineup this is here at the Blue Moon, today?!

Why I'm not giving KBS A 5:  I may not be the most reliable judge For this beer because I do like me a sweeter stout.  I figure to review an iconic beer like this, rather than hashing over the same old ground, it might be more useful to place it on the continuum of my list of all-time favorites.  For best of all-time flavor in the mouth (any style), my 5.0's are Mikkeller Black Hole, Berserker, 120 Minute, BCBS, and very few others.  For aroma, the KBS just doesn't have enough bourbon in the nose. My 5.0's for aroma (any style) go to My Monkey's Got Wood, Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Barley Wine, and J.W.Lee's Harvest Ale.

It pours really dark black with a nice rich brown head that ends up being a thin ring around the glass for a bit.  It smells of Bourbon!!,coffee and roasted malts. The bourbon is really present-more than I thought it would be.  The first sip is full of wood, bourbon, chocolate, and coffee. I can't beleive how much bourbon taste I am getting from this beer. I am all about bourbon barrel aging, but this intense!  At 11.2%, it never seemed HOT. The bourbon flavor is nice, but maybe a little over the top. I would love to try it on tap or an aged version.

Decent head retention with sticky spots of lacing.  S - Sweet vanilla, bourbon, oak, coffe roast. Roasted malt, tons of sweet aroma, with a big roasty coffee character. Bittersweet chocolate, as well as milk chocolate, with some molasses and maple notes. Just tons of roast, and tons of sweetness, with a big bourbon quality. A very big aroma overall.  T - Follows the nose closely, with tons of vanilla, bourbon, wood, coffee and chocolate. Big base of roasted malt, with a huge bourbon barrel character, with oak and sweet vanilla abound. Finishes with tons of bittersweet chocolate and coffee roast, with a subtle earthy character, and a twang of alcoholic warmth.  M - Thick, creamy and smooth.

D - A huge stout with about as much flavor as you can possibly pack into one brew, but I'm not so sure it was worth the hype. It certainly had a massive bourbon and coffee flavor, but I think in the end it lacked a bit of complexity and depth.

1199,19960,JamesMN,4.37,"2013 Vintage. Having this one for the first time. Pulled out of the fridge and let warm for 30 minutes.  Appearance: Pitch black with visible streams of effervescence along the edges of the tulip glass. Modest half finger cap of dark brown foam. Got some good lacing as well.  Aroma: Lots of chocolate notes, both sweet and semi-sweet. Just a hint of vanilla and a touch of alcohol giving a nice bourbon aroma. Really not much in the nose but what's there is enjoyable.  Taste: A lot to digest here with a complexity that keeps shifting long after each sip. Starts with a lot of milk chocolate and a good charred malt backbone to keep it from getting too sweet. About halfway through you get a bit of a hop bitterness that sort of masks itself in the mocha liqueur-like flavor that the alcohol brings out. At 11.2% ABV it is possible to hide that flavor but it really works wonders in adding to the experience of this beer. The flavor and complexity hits a high note during and right after the finish. The palate is drowned in charred malt, hints of coffee, vanilla, and alcohol. This combination brings the bourbon to mind without it being forthright. The aftertaste lingers for a seemingly endless amount of time with black coffee bitterness, burnt chocolate, and a nice heat in the back of the throat. The oak-aging of this beer doesn't add very much oak flavor but it is probably the reason that all the flavors have matured and blended so well. One of those great beers where every sip is better than the last.  Mouthfeel: Just under full in body. Not really thin for what it is just not as thick as expected. Average carbonation for a BA beer but a vigorous pour is probably a good idea. A nice ease of drinkability.  Final Thoughts: I was very lucky to snag a bottle of this year's release and thoroughly enjoyed KBS. Founder's proves time and again that their seasonals are some of the best beers available. While KBS probably won't break my top 10, it is still a phenomenal beer that every beer geek should get the opportunity to try. Would I drink it again? Yes.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,RacerX5k,5,"Edit 4/8/2018 This year's KBS is spot on perfect. Coffee, chocolate, bourbon. Black iced coffee with hints of dark fruit and cherry. Raise the scores, and I will say this is the KBS I've been waiting for all these years. Coffee bomb.  Original Review 4.78 Had one single last year and one single bottle this year and was not impressed at all. Thin, black licorice, with an unpleasant aftertaste. That review would be a generous 3.0 very average. This is not that review. When I saw the draft pop up on my list at an out of the way bar I purchased a good bit of Heady at last year, I thought, well, if I don't like it its only 7 bucks, and if I don't go after work Ill never know. So off I went. And what a pleasant surprise.  Walked in there is only 2 people in the bar and thats good. My 8 oz pour listed at $7 was only $5 and thats better. Beer looks real good, smells just ok (which does get better as you go), hints of chocolate, coffee, bourbon. First taste blows me away, nothing like the bottle. Big chocolate, coffee flavors mixing with a beautiful bourbon barrel in perfect harmony. Finishes dry, stout like dark fruits. Really impressive balance of flavor, thick and rich. 3 pours later I had my 24 oz bomber equivalent for $15 now thats what Im talking about.

1199,19960,Maxwell,4.61,"The beer pours black like motor oil, black and almost sludge-like. The beer pours with a small khaki head that fizzles away to just a ring around the glass. The head leaves a lacing of thin dry velvety bubbles in root-like tendrils. The beer is properly impenetrable to the eye, like the infinite blackness of space. On the nose, the beer smells of meaty roasted coffee, creamy dark chocolate, a little touch of charred oak, and even a hint of sea salt chocolate. Bourbon is pretty weak in the nose, which is not a bad thing. What does seem to be there, from the bourbon scent is blended beneath the thick roasted coffee notes, but does show a touch of booze. On the tongue, the beer tastes smoothly sweet and then bitter with a slight savory touch, a lasting wetness from acid, and a final light burn of boozy alcohol. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet roasted coffee with touches of creamy dark chocolate, and boozy bourbon hiccups that add a sticky sweetness to the beer. A dry roasted bitter from the coffee flavors sits through the second half of the taste and into the aftertaste along with touches of tannic oak barrel. The finish is sweet with bourbon and smooth milk chocolate and the aftertaste is slightly bitter but sweet with chocolate and bourbon lingering. In the mouth, the beer feels like heaven. Thick and creamy with a carbonation of velvet softness that caresses the tongue beautifully. This is the best feeling stout that has ever sat within my mouth. It leaves the mouth slightly dry and sticky with lingering sweetness from the booze and malts. Overall this beer lives up to its hype. It feels amazing in the mouth, and carries the perfect amount of sweet bourbon and oak characters. The coffee and chocolate flavors are much more prevalent in the flavors.

The balance on the nose is fantastic, as well, not one scent dominates the rest.  T: This beer is ridiculously rich. The chocolate and coffee notes come through first and absolutely fill your mouth before the bourbon, vanilla, and oak characters come through and wash it away. This beer warms your body the whole way down. It also gets better as it warms. The chocolate and coffee notes mellow out and the beer becomes far more balanced as it gets warmer.  M: Thick.

The sweet , dark , rich malt starts off nicely , its just bitter enough to let you know it fits the imperial stout style then the bourbon comes along and takes you along for the rest of the ride. As this stout warms up the bourbon becomes more robust and tastes even better  Overall I really didn't think this beer would meet the hype , I was wrong , it met it and beat it.

1199,19960,jaasen64,4.35,"12oz bottle poured into HF glass. This review is a combination of four bottles split between three of us, two of the bottles were '12 KBS and two were '13 KBS. Beer was consumed on 4/19 right after CBS and review is written from notes. I've had this beer a few times in the past but this is my first time reviewing it.  A- Pours a dark black, light mocha head that leaves some spotty lacing, decent carbonation, and overall great appearance.  S- Coffee, light chocolate, extremely nicely balanced bourbon that isn't too abrasive, some slight oak. Fairly aromatic, especially in the '13 where the coffee hasn't faded as much.  T- Coffee, lightly bitter dark chocolate, extremely nicely balanced bourbon. Finishes with more coffee some chocolate and a slight vanilla oak. Coffee and chocolate lingers as an aftertaste. Overall the beer is very nicely balanced and at 70 IBUs the bitterness definitely stands out a little bit for a stout especially in the '12 where the coffee has faded a bit. Overall extremely nicely balanced with some great flavors coming out.  M- Smooth, extremely drinkable for an imperial stout, decent carbonation for a barrel-aged stout.  O- KBS is easily one of my favorite barrel-aged stouts, the only slight complaint that I have about it is that it is a little bit on the bitter side for a stout. Other then that though this beer is very good and the barrel-aging on it is almost a perfected art. I wouldn't highly suggest aging it as the coffee fades letting the bitterness from the chocolate come out. The '13 was definitely better then the '12 which had a little over a year on it, I can say what further aging would do. If you haven't had this before it's definitely worth seeking out, I just wish it was as readily available as the regular Breakfast Stout instead of a once a year release.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The aroma is luxurious, with top shelf whiskey notes, Toblerone, and light vanilla cream. It's quite vibrant! Upon tasting, the word 'exquisite' immediately came to mind. Lavazza espresso, gourmet dark chocolate, new oak, caramel, subtlety floral hops, and Haagen-Dazs ice cream...the multitude of perceived ingredients are all blended quite smoothly. The velvety liquid is dangerously drinkable with its moderately light body. It's almost too hard to believe the alcohol level is 11%.  It bears repeating that its degree of balance is astounding.

Appearance: She's a beaut after just a mild pour. Jet black with a khaki-colored one finger head. Leaves some nice lacing on the side of the glass as you put more into your gut. Head shrinks to just a small layer that stays with you throughout the experience.  Smell: Bourbon for days. Vanilla follows, and a bit of coffee is also present.  Taste: Omph. This brew was(is) worth the trouble. Vanilla is actually much more present in the taste than it is in the smell. Coffee is big too. The bourbon and alcohol elements are mellow but definitely appreciable. Coffee taste is what is most prevalent between sips. I'd say that the vanilla is more prevalent when the brew is cooler, and as it warms, the coffee mixes in more with the vanilla. Not too hot at all at any point.  Mouthfeel: This and the taste are what really make this beer shine. It is extra, silky smooth. Almost like milk, and I mean that in the best way possible... Coats the mouth with a welcome layer of velvety goodness.  Overall: Well worth all the hype, honestly. This was my second bottle this year and I enjoyed this one exponentially more than my first (which is why I held off on reviewing it until I had this one). It is a must try for all of you fine people. At about $5/4 pack more expensive compared to BCBS, I'd have to say it's worth the hike in price. I love BCBS, but this beer justifies the extra $1.25/12oz IMO.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,RichardMNixon,3.18,"Tried it a second time out of concern that I got the wrong beer the first time. Looks nice in the glass, dark body with a thick dark head rare in beers this strong. Aroma is mostly booze with some stale coffee and splintery wood once it wams up. Tastes confused, like an imperial stout with bourbon poured in, and a fair amount of acid. Finishes syrupy and acidic.  Can't understand the obsession with this, I'd suggest you could add a shot of bourbon to an FBS, but I like FBS too much to waste it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Some serious alcohol heat as well  M- Silky smooth mouthfell with some vanilla and alcohol on the end  O- A great stout and im glad to be able to get a few thanks to a trade. I would drink this daily and keep it for special events. Think a few months may lower the heat a lil and create an even better brew.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,pmoney,4.4,"2013 vintage reviewed on 4/21/13.  Appearance: It pours a thick inky black color. After a vigorous pour, a half-inch head forms and then dissipates within the first minute leaving behind a cream-colored rim. The head-retention is a bit underwhelming, but that is typical of high ABV beers. This year's KBS comes in at 11.2%. I intentionally let the beer sit and warm up to about 50 degrees before enjoying it.  Aroma: Faint aromas of bourbon, chocolate, coffee, and oak. The aroma has improved as it has warmed, but it is still less than I would have expected. Bourbon and chocolate are the more prevalent smells.  Taste: Huge flavors of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, roasted grains, and a little coffee. There is an excellent balance of all of these components! Bourbon is in the forefront, but definitely isn't overpowering. The coffee kicks in a little more in the back end.  Mouthfeel: Very thick, chewy, and silky-smooth. Everything a barrel-aged imperial stout should be! The carbonation is a little less than average, which is perfect for this beer.  Overall: The best aspects of this beer are the perfect mouthfeel and the wonderful balance of all the flavors. The only things lacking are the coffee flavor and the overall aroma. This year's KBS is a lot more chocolate-forward than years past, and definitely less boozy (especially considering it was bottled only a few weeks ago). It is typical for people to age barrel-aged imperial stouts, but this one is drinking great right out of the gate! I would recommend drinking it at cellar temperature (around 50-55 degrees), and consider pairing it with a piece of plain cheesecake.

Plus that great vanilla oakiness from barrel aging. Ends with a kick of dark fruits, especially plums. Quite an amalgamation of aromas.  T - holy bourbon! big roasted sweet vanilla oaky bourbon flavors. The coffee and chocolate follow up the bourbon elements nicely.  M&D&O - hype met. KBS is an incredible experience and I am very glad it finally made it to New England. I hope some local watering holes got some logs of it as well.

1199,19960,mfnmbvp,4.35,"12 oz. bottle, bottled on 03/04/2013. Thanks to the generosity of my local beer store dudes, I was able to snag their very last bottle. Exponentially hyped to be able to try this, although that probably goes without saying.  For lack of a snifter, I am pouring this into a St. Bernardus Watou chalice.  A - Pours a rich, thick, opaque black colored body with about a centimeter of mocha colored foam that dies out within seconds. Looks very enticing. Bit of alcohol lacing on the sides.  S - Nose is comprised of the usual suspects: iced brewed coffee, coffee beans, dark chocolate, and a lovely vanilla / bourbon barrel aroma.  T - Wow, this is a lovingly complex beer with layers of goodness. Silky chocolate body with bitter roasted coffee beans. Finishes with creamy delicious vanilla from the bourbon barrels and a hint of bourbon & some alcohol heat. Perfect carbonation.  M - Sleek, creamy feel, with just a hint of alcohol warmth. Bitter coffee beans & vanilla goodness lingering on the palate.  Overall, it lived up to the hype surrounding it fairly well. Although, I wouldn't trample innocent women & children to have another go at a bottle of this. I have to say, while it is still fresh in my mind from yesterday, that I think the Pipeworks Abduction Coffee Break was a better beer, albeit not aged in bourbon barrels. However, if this beer was more readily available than it is, I could see it as a mainstay in my fridge.

The taste is slightly oaky and loaded with vanilla. This tastes like a vanilla latte with cocoa powder sprinkled on top. There is a hint of bitterness from the coffee. Loads of vanilla bean on the front end. The backbone seems like an oatmeal stout and has that level of viscosity. It might not be thick enough for some, but it makes it easy to drink.

S - Roasted coffee & chocolate, lots of vanilla and oak and maybe some caramel malt. Simple sounding but amazing smell.  T - Lots of roasty coffee flavors and bourbon up front, sweet chocolate, vanilla and alcohol astringency follows. A nice rather bitter/alcoholic finish. There may be some dark fruits as well. The roasted bitter flavors, bourbon/alcohol and sweet vanilla dominate.  M - Fullish bodied, a bit of a sipper as the bourbon is pretty noticeable. Mildly (appropriately) carbonated. Very smooth  O - Pretty much met all of the hype, bourbon/alcohol and vanilla sweetness really dominated this one for me. The dark fruits were very much in your face initially, the warmth brought forth more vanilla boozyness.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,jdkitchi,4.18,"Poured black with large brown head into a large snifter. There was good head retention and sticky lacing.  I mostly get wet coffee grounds on the nose along with some malt. There is a somewhat sweet coffee flavor up front. I get a little bit of cocoa and bourbon barrel after that. The mouth feel is medium.  About halfway through I'm getting more of a balance of the bourbon barrel flavor with the coffee. I started this at cellar temp of about 55F but I think it's a little better as it warms up from there.  I don't know if it is worth the $7 for a 12 oz bottle. Goose Island BCBS is much more intense. Central Waters BS has much more of the bourbon barrel notes. Overall, this is a very good imperial coffee stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Poured motor oil black into an oversized wine glass with a modest creamy mocha head. Hints of mahogany when held up to the light. Scintillating aroma with a lot going on; roasty and sweet. Taste is elegantly layered, like a dark chocolate coffee cake in liquid form, revealing hints of caramel, vanilla, and oak as it warms. Muted bourbon character that isn't overpowering but comes together well with the other flavors. Incredibly balanced and nuanced. Mouthfeel is moderately thick but thinner than other big stouts. Dangerously drinkable, luxuriously smooth, and not as hot as you would expect for the ABV. Definitely one to sip and savor. A real treat. A shame this is so much of a hassle to acquire.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,TTAmod,4.18,"Procured a 2013 bottle today. Poured into tulip. Let's see if it lives up to the hype.  A: Dark, dark brown...almost black. There's quite a bit of brown head and carbonation, too. It's about one finger thick and the retention is quite good.  S: Lots of chocolate, coffee, and alcohol come through. There's a touch of oak and bourbon going on in the nose, but not that much.  T: Taste is burnt cocoa nibs, coffee, touch of chocolate. The bourbon is there, but isn't as strong as something like BCBS. Ends with a taste like a chocolate cake and a bit of heat. The bottle says 70 IBUs? Haha...it doesn't taste anywhere near that. Is the bourbon covering it up? This brew doesn't taste bitter at all. And they're not lying when they say that this is a completely different beer than Breakfast Stout...doesn't taste anything like it.  M: Very, very smooth and quite easy to drink considering the high ABV. There's a bit of carbonation tingle, but this stuff is SMOOTH.  O: It's good, but not as good as BCBS and not the liquid gold that people claim it is. It's not a bad beer by any means, though. I think a bit more bourbon flavor and slightly less sweetness would do this beer some good.  I'd definitely buy some again, but not something I'd buy every day, especially considering the price.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I originally rated it 4.79  Given to me as a gift by a very generous BA on 4/16/13.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a St Bernardus Chalice, served at room temp.  Appearance: Kentucky Coal Black with a 1 finger mocha head that has a cinnamon color to it. No lacing to speak of.  Aroma: deeply roasted malt and a hint of coffee get a mammoth bear hug of oaky, vanilla-ish Bourbon. Alcohol vapors.  Mouthfeel: silky, smooth. As delightful a mouthfeel as any beer.  Taste: rich, dark, chocolate, a touch of coffee and a good wallop of Bourbon with some molasses and vanilla in there somewhere. The oak from the barrels is noticeable as well.  notes: so this is KBS! I was afraid the beer couldn't possibly live up to the hype, thank God my fears were unfounded. Aroma, mouthfeel and taste are all perfect or nearly so. The only minor blemish is lack of lacing and head retention but that may just be a result of the barrel aging. The Bourbon flavor is blended in to the beer very well so it is not a hot mess.

We usually ask to sit at the bar, however, since it was extremely packed we grabbed a table (at the Whetstone Station in Brattleboro- you may have seen ads for it on this site!).  Waited 15 minutes for the beer to come so you can imagine how antsy I was to finally try it. I was with my partner and one of my best friends, we all were trying it for the first time and the anticipation was exciting and fun. We all took sips at the same time, and we all exclaimed simultaneously OH MY GOD.  Seriously smooth and velvety - vanilla and caramel and sweet sweet bourbon. The aftertaste is a sweet burn from the bourbon barrel. Delicious and very sippable - the intensity of this beer makes me recommend not chugging it! It is also incredibly rich.

What pops out right away is the dominating malt character. Lot's of thick, roasted flavors going on. This is melding very interestingly with vanilla and chocolate sweetness. Quite a bit of bourbon as well; this is actually lingering quite a bit. I'm lovin' it!  M- Smooth like velvet. Full bodied, heavy bodied, whatever you want to call it, this beer is dense and delicious. Not a whole lot of booziness from the 11.2% ABV, which is actually a bit surprising. I'm sure this would mellow out even more with some aging.  O- Absolutely stellar beer. Rich and complex flavors are keeping me wanting another sip.

Pours a midnight black in color w/ only a few dark brown bubbles that leave no lacing on the glass. Aromas of coffee, oak, bourbon, and vanilla. The flavor was of coffee up front, leading into very smooth oak/vanilla/bourbon, and finishes w/ ever so slight hop bite and char. Full bodied, but a bit thin due to the carbonation falling off a bit over 5 years in the bottle. Very easy to drink as the ABV is well hidden and the flavors are so well melded together.  Overall, this is the KBS I remember and it took me back to a better time in beer 5 years ago. When this beer was fresh and the carbonation was there this beer was a lush monster, this rich and lush monster is what built the reputation and high score for this beer.

1199,19960,MaximalC,4.52,"*Had on tap 4/15/13  Pours ebony with a respectable mocha head. Aroma smells of chocolate, coffee, and bourbon, with perhaps a hint of dark fruit--not overpowering, but present enough to be appreciated. At first blush, taste is similar to that of Breakfast Stout, but with a greater balance between the chocolate and coffee notes, which I find to be more heavily weighted on the coffee side in the Breakfast Stout. The balanced chocolate-coffee blend is offset by the addition of the bourbon, which lends a smooth, solid, oaken sophistication. This brew certainly doesn't want for flavor, and is best enjoyed sip by sip. The taste is smooth and never cloying, and the staying power is impeccable. The aftertaste is pleasant and prolonged, affording plenty to savor between sips. Alcohol is just present enough to lend some warmth without being overbearing, and certainly well masked--I never would have surmised the 11% ABV. It only improves with warming, and I found the experience of enjoying a bottle over the course of an hour to be wholly satisfying.  KBS is a smooth, luxurious blend of chocolate, bourbon, and coffee in equal measure, and pretty much on par with the reputation that precedes it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Aroma is fantastic, could just smell this beer all day! Bourbon hits first followed by smooth coffee aroma. Notes of vanilla, chocolate, toffee, sweet malt and alcohol  Flavor is more chocolate but swiftly followed by the bourbon, sticky malt sugar and coffee. Bitterness is assertive and beautifully cuts the sweetness. Would have given a higher taste rating but I am detecting a slightly metallic or alkaline flavor that I have not remembered from past years - maybe just too young.

Taste: The taste is full-bodied and complex, with notes of coffee, chocolate, and vanilla. There is a strong bourbon flavor that comes through, along with a slight sweetness. The finish is slightly bitter, but well-balanced.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with a slightly thick texture. There is a good level of carbonation, which adds to the overall experience.  Overall Impression: Founders Brewing KBS is an excellent beer that combines strong flavors with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a real creamy smoothness; coats the tongue and lingers.  Overall: This was my first encounter with the esteemed KBS, and I have to say, it didn’t disappoint. I was drinking several very good beers in a flight while waiting for KBS to be poured at a local establishment’s Beer-Fest KBS party, and when compared side-by-side to KBS, the other beers definitely fell a bit into its shadow.

Smells great- sweet, tasty bourbon, chocolate, and coffee. Very strong, even to someone like me with a poor sense of smell.  Somehow tastes even better. Brownie batter mixed with cookie dough comes first, then bourbon sweetness, coffee bitterness, vanilla, oak and a slight hop kick. The alcohol shows itself a bit at times, but not horribly so. This is certainly tasty, but it does not compare to some of the absolute top BA stouts.  Kinda thin compared to other BA stouts. Drinks a bit like a coffee bourbon milkshake with extra chocolate.

N: Hard to figure out where to begin. You have the milk chocolate, with vanilla, but all wrapped in a kind of buttery toffee smell. The bourbon is there when you first open it, but subsides after a while. Doesn't really smell boozy to me. 11.2%?? No way. But wow, the smell is delicious and just like many a FB relationship status: it's complicated.  T: This really really really is a well crafted stout. Artisinally produced. Evertyhing you get in the nose is there on the tongue, and each flavor on its own is quite bold and distinct, but it's all just sooo dang balanced. You get the very rich coffee and expresso but it's totally interwoven with the chocolate and the vanilla from the bourbon barrel. The bourbon flavors and booziness didn't really start to become prominent until this warmed to 60F or so. But completely and complexly delicious.  MF: So smooth and velvety. Very creamy and sticks to your mouth and palate. You can still get the oak and vanilla 10 seconds after your last swallow on the back of your tongue.

Big, two-finger-thick, mocha-colored head that sits with some tight, some foamy bubbles on top. Some lacing too. Deep, black body that does not allow much light to pass through at all. Head dissipates to thin layer after several minutes.  Massive aroma that is pumped up with notes of coffee, vanilla, and dark malts. Coffee definitely dominates the aroma, but those layers of chocolate and bourbon-soaked wood help to add more complexity here. Smells delicious. Delivers what is says it is going to deliver.  Rich coffee/espresso and chocolate notes that are overlaid with notes of bourbon, oak and vanilla. A very supple taste that could easily hold up to some strong food pairings or cigars. As the beer warms the alcohol becomes much more prevalent and even a touch hot.  The beer's body is as thick as can be. Velvety and creamy carbonation. Smooth and rich, with a slick finish. This is a great body for such a big beer. Compliments the flavor and aroma very well.  Yet another great beer from Founders! It isn't something you could drink a lot of, but still remains a tasty beer. I don't think it's the best beer that Founders makes, but it's 100% worth trying and I would definitely drink this again.

It has so many distinct, bold flavors but they're subtle when they need to be. There's still a lot of coffee and roasty flavors in there, and as always KBS has much more chocolate to it than vanilla. It's bitter at the end, but not a hoppy bitter, more of a dark coffee or dark chocolate bitter. Like I said, every flavor in KBS is incredibly bold.  M- Thick, chewy, what I've come to expect from Founders' stouts. Carbonation has died down since last year but with the thick mouthfeel it's kinda perfect.  O- KBS is a solid BA stout. It says on the bottom of the label, ""Is good for everything a stout ought to be good for"" and it certainly is. I typically like my stouts with more of a vanilla characteristic to them (something KBS and CBS certainly lack) but it's a fantastic beer nonetheless.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smell- Big roasty coffee and chocolate, with a mild vanilla presence from the barrel.  Taste- Very coffee forward, followed up with fudgey dark chocolate. The bourbon takes a back seat in this, but has a mild vanilla sweetness on the finish. I love the big coffee presence, but wish there was a bigger bourbon presence.  Mouthfeel- Full and coating.

The barrel aging kicks in just after, lots of whiskey, lots of oak but neither are over the top. Leaves your mouth with a perfect flavor of chocolate, coffee, and bourbon barrels. The texture is creamy and not bitter at all O- this beer is amazing. The flavors compliment each other perfectly and there is a lot going on at one time. Along with the obvious listed flavors, you get subtle cinnamon, marshmallow, lactose, hint of smoke, some boozieness. Can't wait to do a side by side with my 2012.

Almost like a Riesen candy, if you've ever had one.  The flavor mimics the aroma identically, but intensifies what you're smelling by immersing your pallet. Absolutely no surprises outside of how easy-to-drink this beer is for an 11.2% ABV. While this is a very full-bodied stout, it drinks like light beer. Before you know it, the experience is over and you feel every ounce of the potency.  I've heard all the hype... And after finally sampling two bottles, I suppose it's well justified. This is an amazing stout. Didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as did, and now I'm sad it's over.

Served in a Founders snifter  Appearance: Pours motor oil black with a finger and a half of dark tan, almost brown head which dissipated to a relatively thick collar. Leaves some spotty lacing.  Smell: Coffee, vanilla, dark chocolate, roasted malt, bourbon, hint of dark fruit. The bourbon is less prominent than I was expecting.  Taste: Follows the nose closely. Roasted coffee, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, burnt malt, mild oak tannin/astringency.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a thick, viscous, velvety smooth mouthfeel.

A thin burnt yellow head appeared, and disappeared. A delightful dance of hop oils before the last couple drops went into the cup.  Smell- Coffee first, coffee ice cream second, and a sweet alcohol finish.  Taste- I can see what the hype is about. The coffee bitter combines well with the hop bitter to make this not too sweet like many bourbon barrel aged beers. Like the smell, it leaves a sweet alcohol presence.  Mouthfeel- Microbubbles surrounded by the oil. Heavy, could keep you warm all winter long. Luckily though, it doesn't hover on your palate unpleasantly long.

O - This has a much more roasty taste than anticipated. Flavors are excellent. Mouth is incredible. As in, I don't think it can get any better. Aged fruit makes appearance after substantial warming.

This is an excellent beer but when comparing it to other ""world class"" bourbon barrel beers such as Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout, I didn't think it was quite up to par. I didn't even think it was quite as good as Peruvian Morning by Central Waters (one of the best beers to come out of my home state). It was still very good though.  The taste is mostly of coffee with hints of vanilla, chocolate and bourbon. The mouthfeel wasn't as thick as I thought it would be and although the alcohol was very noticeable, it wasn't as overpowering as BCBS.

We have had so much trouble bringing this beer into our shop, so when we did, it went out faster than it came in. I saved a bottle to try.  The pour was beautiful, that heavenly jet black oil, glistening into my glass. The semi dark amber head was not overwhelming, but present.  The bouquet was awesome. I think I got my nose into this glass deeper than I have with other beers. No question about alcohol in this one, I could pick it out immediately.  The first sip, to me had a little burn to go along with a big round full mouth of coffee. The mouthful was better than the initial taste. Now, the finish, that left me a bit undecided about this stout. The second and third sips were basically the same, but what troubled me the most was the aftertaste. I just didnt finish the way I had hoped it would.  But to be fair, I am not a big Bourbon fan. I've tasted many brews that have either been aged in bourbon casks or have definite bourbon overtones. Those are the beers that I have not enjoyed as much as others.

Both poured into a stemmed tulip.  2012: Pour is a deep black with a slight bit of tan rim head with a little lacing remaining. Fantastic aromas of sweet chocolate and vanilla with hints of ever so slight roasted malts and coffee but ever so slight. Nice bourbon and woody booze aromas. Actually hits you in the face on opening. Taste is so amazing. Deep rich sweet chocolate with nice vanilla and bourbon notes. Its sweet but so well balanced with the malts. Wow. So smooth and such a pleasurable brew.  2013: Pour is same color but way more tan head...about a finger worth but dissapates quickly leaving a bit more tan lacing. Aromas are of chocolate and booze..way more sharp in the alcohol aroma. Not quite as sweet as the aged. Taste is a bit more vanilla and sharp booze. A bit more roasted malts and coffee flavor. Its way more sharp and way more coffee. Still an awesome brew. 4.5 on the 2012  Overall, the 2012 was way better. Much smoother, much more developed flavor, less of a sharpness, and smoother.

The bourbon oak was noticeable but not over powering like other beers aged as long. This may have been more noticeable when it was freshly bottled. Coffee and chocolate was present, but not as explosive as the Breakfast Stout. It had a nice combination of bourbon, oak, and roasted malts.  T- The taste followed the nose. Initially tasted a heated bourbon with a very smooth transition to a roasted coffee finish. I am not sure if it is the age, but there is a distinct earthy/dirt after taste.

T - Bourbon right off the bat, shortly followed by dark coffee and espresso. Chocolate makes it's presence known and it finishes off on a warming boozy vanilla note. The coffee sticks around well into the finish.  M - Thick oily body with almost no carbonation. Consitant dark chocolate and coffee. Flavorts unravel as it sits.  O - Overall, definitely a solid stout, unfortunately, I don't think it belongs on the top 10, or even the top 20 beer list. The bourbon was nice, but the vanilla undertones weren't pronounced enough.

1199,19960,BirdFlu,4.32,"So after much time spent hoping and waiting, KBS finally came to town like Santa on Xmas night.. Every store in my state that I know of who had it only sold a single bottle per customer (so I had to go to every store, obviously, and obtained a full 4 pack or so).. So its fitting that this is my 100th review! Served just above room temperature in a snifter. The appearance of this beer is the sort of thing RIS lovers can usually only dream of- Jet black, it literally made me laugh out loud at how absurdly dark and viscous it looks. Just solid darkness with thin brown head which clings lightly to the walls. The aroma is very chocolatey- dark and milk chocolates mixed with dark roast coffee/espresso beans and a bit of liquor. The wood barrel characteristics are there too giving it an earthy quality. Its a much, much more prominent smell you get in the glass (as opposed to just out of the bottle) compared to a lot of beers. The taste is smooth and balanced between similar characters you find in the aroma- dark coffee, dark chocolate, wood, some vanilla bean, and certainly boozey brown liquor. Bitterness (like dark chocolate, not like hops) is upfront. Mouth is incredibly smooth, unbelievably even, on the tongue then warm boozey burn (not in a bad way) as you swallow it. Amazing, a great, chewy, viscosity that doesn't cross the line to overbearing heaviness. You really had to try and find something to thats NOT fairly perfect about the beer.. For an RIS its much much all you could hope for, though it does have a few slight drawbacks in its drinkability considering the boozeyness which becomes reminiscent of sort of an after-dinner liqeur and the weight of it which develops.. its almost like a milkshake towards the end.. Its not a solid 5's across the board, but its definitely an A+",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,DrewskiWhit,4.64,"First time drinking KBS.... Wow  Combination of chocolate, bourbon, coffee at forefront. Not overly complex. Drinks like a milkshake.

1199,19960,RichD,4.99,"2013 edition poured into a snifter.  A: Pours an impenetrable midnight black color. There is a small khaki colored head that gives way to a small ring around the glass. There are some strong alcohol legs that develop as I drink on.  S: Smells of straight alcohol powered bourbon initially. A strong vanilla smell is picked up after a few minutes of letting this sit in the glass. Chocolate and coffee come through in a prominent way as this brew begins to heat up. Some oak character shines through as well as some malts. I didn't pick up any hop character despite this being 70 IBUs. This doesn't punch you in the face with aroma like some other barrel aged stouts do, but it's one of the things that makes KBS unique.  T: Notes of chocolate and vanilla are what I immediately pick up. Upon further drinking, some coffee and oak character also come through here. This is such a smooth drinker even though there is a slight alcohol burn. This sweetness from the molasses and vanilla is effectively balanced out by the coffee which makes this an incredibly enjoyable brew.  M: A medium-heavy bodied beer that is actually quite smooth. As I wrote earlier, there's a slight burn, but nothing that takes away from the brew. It's just a matter of letting this warm up to let the bourbon take a backseat and blend in with the rest of the nuances of this imperial stout. This is definitely the way it should be done.  Overall: This is definitely one of the best beers I'll ever drink. Upon tasting the original breakfast stout, there was no doubt in my mind that KBS could and would top FBS. I hold both on a pedestal and I love the fact that there are big differences between the two. I believe Founders did a great job making KBS and FBS stand by themselves. It would've been quite easy for Founders to just throw FBS in bourbon barrels but they didn't. I'm glad they did because it would've been quite easy to view FBS as the base beer of KBS, but since Founders brews a completely different stout for KBS it allows us to appreciate both for what they are. Barrel aging and adding coffee to their beers are what Founders does best and KBS is a prime example of this. This is a top 5 beer, but it might be my personal all-time favorite.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Deep, pitch black color with a tan, copper colored head that dissipates fairly quickly. The color is sublime.  S-Bourbon hits the nose pretty astringently, which I do not like. However, it fades quickly into a deep, complex symphony of chocolate, toasted almonds, burnt oak, and coffee.  T-Quick bourbon bite at the front. Strong on the chocolate and toasted almonds. The bourbon has a lingering taste, but it is not as overpowering as it is on the nose. The bourbon at the front fades nicely into the chocolate and toasted almonds at the finish as I notice its presence again with a faint touch of vanilla. Very well-rounded, full bodied brew.  MF-The body is perfect. Not as thick as most Imperial stouts, but not to thin. A perfect balance between watery and chewy. It feels like I could drink more than 2 in a sitting, which is not typical of an imperial stout. Very smooth and semi-rich with slight carbonation  O-Absolutely exceptional.

1199,19960,Thickfreakness,4.25,"300th review  Pours like liquid brownie into my tulip glass. Thick, dark and chewy. A walnut tan head rises up and fades rather effortlessly back into the abyss leaving only tiny islands of lacing and some foam settling on the murky black. Rich black coffee, subtle hints of bitter 90% chocolate, little bits of vanilla and bourbon but not fake or overwhelming. Subtle touches of coconut, gently toasted nuts, and I swear just a hint of orange peel. To me KBS never had an over-the-top bourbon punch, just gentle, smokey kisses that cling to your palate without overwhelming you. I had pulled this out of the fridge about 15mins before opening it, and it's now starting to really open up in the nose and come alive. Bitter black coffee, 90% Belgian chocolate bar, cocoa powder, orange peel dipped in melted chocolate, whisps of vanilla, coconut and smokey bourbon. The bourbon is really opening it up as it warms up. This is a perfect candidate for opening right out of the cellar. I prefer KBS with a year on it so that some of that bitter coffee fades and everything melts together beautifully. Neither thick or thin. Sticky and chewy enough to stick to the sides and roof of your mouth like a brownie, but still flows and drinks easily. Nice cocoa powder/coffee/charred malt/bourbon blend. Neither takes the lead, but each shares eloquently. Not my favorite BBA RIS by any means, but still a nice treat on this first decent day of spring in NY. Nice and chewy, a decent blend of coffee/cocoa/bourbon. It's really too bad that this is so limited. I think that's why this one is so damn hyped. A damn fine RIS. Plenty of other better ones that are easier to find, but if you've never had it and have the chance, by all means grab it. I'd love to try this on tap sometime.

It taste like bourbon spiked cold coffee. And I don't like coffee. Don't take this wrong I know coffee notes are part of having a stout but usually chocolate is too and didn't get that anywhere in this beer. If ever have again it would be one and done, then go onto another beer.

1199,19960,Brewasaurus,5,"First KBS ever, fresh 2013 bottle poured into a Triptych pint glass.  A - A thick black liquid that lets no light through, with a medium-dark head.  S - A flawless mix of coffee and bourbon with hints of vanilla  T - This is by far the best blend of flavors I've ever had in a beer. All the flavors are right there all the time, but none are dominated by the others. The sweetness of the bourbon falls into the background as the coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts gently roll through. You're never 'bombed' with any flavor. One of the most consistent beers throughout the whole tasting process.  M - Very smooth, sticks around for 10 seconds or so. The best mouthfeel you could want in a stout.  O - A lot of people comare this to BCS, but to me it's a whole different animal altogether. You can tell that this isn't just a bourbon aged stout with coffee added, it was made with those flavors in mind, producing an extremely well-balanced beer that retains the complexity through every last drop. I was worried that I was too hyped for this beer, but it proved itself worth of the rarity and praise it gets.

Seemed like it was going to linger far longer than i wished due to the anticipation of tasting this much heralded brew. Liquid dark chocolate in appearance, not quite as viscous as BCBS  S -coffee was predominant aroma by far, followed by a subtle blend of bourbon, oak, vanilla and roasted malts  T -I was surprised by how balanced this was. I was expecting a coffee bomb but it was a tantalizing combo of coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and the roasted malts. The bourbon definitively plays the supporting role well, kinda like the 6th man in basketball. Didn't try to steal the show but is an indispensable part of the team  M -very good mouth feel. not too thin and not thick. Goldilocks would say this was just right.  O -Superb offering from Founders. Does it live up to the hype? Yes. Does this dethrone BCBS as my favorite BA stout? No. It will be interesting to age for 6 mo or so to let the coffee subside just a little bit. It was definitely more prominent than my pallet is accustomed to, not going to say this is a bad thing, just different. I had 2011 BCBS coffee around Christmas time and I would prefer KBS over that, I have not had fresh BCBS coffee though. Makes me want to bust out my 2012 now for a comparison.

1199,19960,bnes09,4.59,"Jet black and perfectly opaque. Thick and creamy tan colored head on the pour. Head retention is excellent, forms a ring around the glass and plenty of lace blotches.  Aroma is very robust. Sweet molasses and maple. Oats and corn. Lots of coffee. Hints of vanilla and oak character. Well rounded and complex in the nose.  Flavor begans with the malt consisting of roasted barley, dry oats and cooked corn. Robust coffee and rich dark chocolate come to life near the middle. Subtle earthy hop character. Mild maple sweetness. Not getting too much oak or vanilla in the flavor. Complex but with less than perfect balance and the corn flavor is throwing me off a bit.  Full bodied though not syrupy. Highly carbonated for the strength. Rich, creamy texture and just slightly drying in the finish.  A very good beer but a let down from what I expected given all the hype.  Revision after second tasting 4/28/13: Compared side by side against breakfast stout and drank over the coarse of 1.5 hours. After about an hour the beer reached a temperature which allowed all the oaky, vanilla, bourbon nuances to emerge. The flavors also seemed to blend and harmonize. This brought the taste and overall score up for me and I recommend this sampling technique. Overall, every bit as good as breakfast stout with a little more flavor that tackles a slightly different style and both can be thoroughly enjoyed depending on the mood of the drinker",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The bourbon presence is fantastic. Heavy mouthfeel. This one was a pain to get a hold of but I'm glad I finally landed one.

Good amount of oak and a pretty significant bitterness, some from the coffee and some from hops.  M: A little thinner than expected. Some oak tannin/astringency are definitely present.  O: There are alot of people trying to do big oak aged stouts, alot without success, but that is not the case with Founders.

S- Lots of coffee and chocolate lead the way in the nose. The bourbon and oak characteristics are a little more subdued. To me it almost smells like a mix of FIS and FBS. Wish there was more bourbon in the nose.  T- Again, fresh, bitter coffee beans are balanced out by silky smooth milk chocolate. The bourbon comes through a little more on the taste but there still isn't as much barrel as I'd like. I get a little vanilla, oak and even some anise at the end, but its mostly a coffee and chocolate bomb, which isn't a bad thing.  M- I'd say its a medium to full body, not as thick as I'd expect but not too thin to where it detracts from the beer. Pretty high carbonation for a barrel aged stout as well.  O- After trying many barrel aged stouts this year, (bcbs,bcbcs, peruvian morning, cwbbs, parabola), this falls in the middle of the pack. Nothing spectacular for me, but still a very solid beer.

Absolutely no light penetration whatsoever through the beer. Aroma upfront is extremely high on coffee, with hints of bourbon and vanilla and burnt/roasted malts coming through with every swirl. Taste is also high on coffee upfront, bittersweet all the way through from the front to the finish. The bourbon is evident only in the finish. Overall, this beer lives up to all the hype. Smooth, luscious and delectable. The alcohol is very well hidden. This is absolutely a 'must-try' beer in my humble opinion.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,THANAT0PSIS,3.83,"Founders KBS (2017)  A: A beer that needs no introduction. It pours completely black and opaque, no light getting through. On a hard, direct pour, it yields barely a finger of tan head, evoking the image of a very large, heavier-roasted espresso shot complete with crema (an image that many coffee stouts bring to mind). The presumably high ABV (this vintage does not list any ABV) likely hinders the head. Retention is average, but lacing is great as are the unmistakeable alcohol legs. Viscosity seems a bit thinner than some of its upper tier brethren, but still, it is a great-looking BA coffee stout. 4.5/5  A: While cold, coffee dominates the aroma leaving little room for anything else to show through. It is an indiscriminate dark roast, not quite French or Italian, but a far cry from fruitier, more acidic single-origin light roasts that are creeping more and more into beer vogue. Chocolate notes, likely amplified by the stout and the added chocolate, make the overall impression that of chocolate-covered espresso beans. There is a creaminess underneath that gives the simultaneous impression of a latte, but it is oddly separated enough from the chocolate that the obvious ""mocha"" is not the word that comes to mind. As it warms, caramel, burnt sugar, vanilla, dry oak, and bourbon show up. Think roasting a marshmallow over a hardwood-fueled campfire while also brewing cowboy coffee over the same source. It is truly a great aroma, even if the coffee is simplistic, and it lacks cohesion. 4.5/5  T: The flavors do not live up to the promise of the aroma, sadly. Where the aroma was hedonistically appealing despite its brash, slightly unrefined nature, the taste seems to have latched onto all the wrong cues. Hefty wood and acrid, burnt coffee assaults the palate immediately before transitioning to earthier notes (hops?) and baker's chocolate (but mainly the bitterness). A touch of sweetness burrows in to the wooden prison that persists through the entirety of every sip, bringing vanilla and unmistakeable bourbon sweetness and a hint of fruit. The bourbon is huge upon warming. Breathing outward yields pure acetone. Predictably, given the blunt approach of the rest of the flavor, this brief bourbony respite also brings alcohol heat, which reactivates the acridity and bitterness of the coffee, transubstantiating with the oppressive weight of the wood into an unholy trinity that manifests in Judaean dryness and a lingering burn that Lucifer himself would approve of. Like that overlong metaphor, the whole flavor spectrum lacks subtlety. 3.5/5  M: Unfortunately, the struggles continue in the mouthfeel. The dryness is even more off-putting, and the lingering burn (which begins in the middle of each sip) hurts the beer twice as much here. It is simultaneously sticky and thin (relative to many, many other stouts), which comes well short of peanut butter and jelly as a classic combination. Carbonation is right on for the style in intensity and frequency, but it lacks the creaminess in feel that a stout like this should have. It is not outright bad, but it stays far away from the best stouts out there. 3.25/5  O: Finally, I got a fresh bottle of this beer and got around to rereviewing it. Needless to say, my opinion has changed greatly since I last gave it a 4.97 on this very site four years ago. While I do not think KBS is a bad beer, it is certainly nowhere near the zenith of BA imperial stouts, coffee stouts, or even standard imperial stouts. KBS is, at this point, a legendary acronym that used to stand for a great beer. The beer world has left it behind, and my palate has followed away. Perhaps it is my palate; perhaps the batch from 2013 was truly great; perhaps new stouts have set the bar higher (obviously I believe the latter, or a combination of all). Looking back, there seemed to be more flavor nuance and a better mouthfeel in that first batch that I reviewed. Whatever the case, KBS is not what it used to be, for whatever reason (CBS is not worth the chase either). Go buy Lagunitas High Westified for a slightly better beer and a much better value, or hope and pray that Goose Island and AB-InBev bring BCBCS back to four-packs with greater availability in the future, or maybe just grab a coffee stout from your local brewer; I am sure there is something local to everyone that is nearly as good. The price is too high; the chase is too annoying; the drinkability is abysmal. Pair with Brain Drill's ""Apocalyptic Feasting,"" which has all the subtlety of Cannibal Corpse with none of the fun, songwriting, or substance. 3.75/5  Note: I had to edit out my whole previous review because of character length restrictions. In brief, it showed more complexity in the taste, thicker mouthfeel, less burning, and a more complete package. I had more of a rookie palate. Please open up character limits, Bros! I want to be able to have different vintage ratings side-by-side.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I was expecting to be let down, but it lived up to the hype completely!

No bourbon but what is there is quite magnificent.  T- A big bitterness at first. At first there is a subtle caramel sweetness. A massive roasted malt takes over on the tongue. A lasting dryness and smokiness left on the tongue. The coffee is very bold in this beer and really dominates the palate. The beer also has a dry cocoa to it that sticks to the tongue as well as a sweet and silky milk chocolate flavor to it. The bourbon is mostly noticeable on the back end. A nice sour mash to the beer and a nice bourbon flavor. The oak is subtly hidden under the bold flavors but adds a crisp dryness.  M- Big and thick, as it should be. Warming on the way down but not much in the terms of alcohol taste. A sweet stout with a very dry finish and lasting roast flavors on the tongue.  O- After trying to get this beer for 2 years.

This is my first KBS, and here is where I think Parabola edges this beer out: at this point Parabola explodes with a huge chocolate malt creaminess whereas KBS seems to fade out on the bourbon note. That being said, while it doesn't exceed my expectations of this super hyped beer, KBS at least meets them.  Edit: 2016 bottle fresh: I'm seeing better head retention and lacing on this batch.

Layers of wood and vanilla notes provide it complexity as well as the silken touch. Creamy. But very potent. The booze is strong as the stout is very fresh. Nice mix of flavors. Finish is dry and bitter.  Mouth feel is full bodied. Thick. A lot of creamy and silky touch. A good amount of alcohol, hop and malt astringency. A lot of warmth. Drink really slow and warm.  This is one super big stout. Stouts definitely don't get much better than this. Probably not as good as BCBS may be due to an explicit booze content.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,tectactoe,4.43,"2010 Vintange, aged two years... Thanks, Mick! Pours dark as hell as it glorps itself into the glass, barely making a sound. A deep tan head slowly forms, never getting too big, but perching at a reasonable size and leaving some nice, wet lacing in its path. Who said high gravity stouts couldn't have a nice head?  Big bourbon presence in the aroma, right from the start, but it remains smooth, silky, and inviting; never ""hot"". Big-time oak and wood notes, outlined with a nutty presence; toasted and again, soaked in booze. The coffee brings up the rear; a nice collage of bitter-roasted coffee beans and a underlying malt sweetness. French blend, cream and sugar, please.  Though I didn't get it at first, after a few more whiffs, super thick and dark fudge becomes apparent. Deep, dark chocolate fudge - bittersweet, savory, and dense. The nose on KBS is fantastic, and I can understand why this beer is held to such high regard. So complex and robust, yet so approachable at the same time.  KBS hits my tongue feeling silky, smooth, and carbonated well considering that it's almost three years old at this point. Not as huge of a mouth feel as Founders' Imperial Stout, but this is still a full-bodied and lightly chewy stout, no doubt. Big, robust, syrupy bourbon flavors are the first things to attach themselves to my palate; heavy yet smooth, well-integrated, and non-abrasive.  Mild notes of oak and vanilla back up the bourbon flavor as well, showing a strong barrel presence in this finely aged stout. Roasted malts are abundant, of course, as is that dark fudge that snuck itself into the aroma later on. Super thick fudge-cake, exploding with dense cocoa flavors and bittersweet chocolate morsels. The wood and oak flavors get heavier as the sip goes on, followed by a bit more nuts and coffee beans.  The coffee is a little less present on the palate than it was in the aroma, but it's still very much there; roasty, creamy, and bold. The aftertaste is full of more thick fudge, nuts, coffee beans, oak, vanilla, all over the fading bourbon background. One of the most beautiful and elegant things about this beer - as it warmed up, the alcohol warmth never got any hotter. If anything, it almost mellowed out a bit and become even easier to drink... very dangerous for an 11.2% ABV stout. I didn't want this one to end.  What a huge stout, tons of things going on, and a beautiful display of how bourbon-barrel aging can turn beer into a work of art. KBS was an excellent beer, and while I certainly think it might be a *touch* overrated in the sense that there are many other ""just as good or better"" beers of the same type that aren't nearly as hard to get your hands on, it's still a fine beer, regardless - there's no denying that.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,shand,4.75,"2011 vintage.  KBS pours blacker than black with next to no head. There is a ton of bourbon in the nose, along with a strong roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and some vanilla from oak. Smells great. But the real judge is on the tongue where KBS really shines. The barrel and the base beer are in absolutely perfect harmony, letting enough of the bourbon barrel shine through to flawlessly compliment the notes of the stout. Everything works in lockstep all the way from the strong vanilla-bourbon start to the roasty, oaky and slightly boozy finish. The mouthfeel is rich and velvety, with just the slightest tickle of carbonation, and the drinkability is exceptional. Overall, a superb barrel aged stout that is masterfully aged and blended. Highly recommended.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Next, bourbon (and a lot of it). Finally, dark coffee and a little black malt. Phenomenal nose. Flavor is rich, complicated, and smooth. The attack is sweet and bourbony. Almost no heat, but I know there is plenty of alcohol hiding. There is a huge coffee flavor and a little bit of vanilla.

While bourbon is definitely one of my favorite additives to beers these days, it is nice to not have it overpower the beer.

Matter of fact it almost seems like plagiarism. 2012  Motor oil viscosity with foamy tan head receding into whispy cirrus cloud formation. Tan sweetness taints the glass brown with a faint haze.  Aroma of roast coffee, vanilla, wood, milk chocolate, café con leche sweetness, and alcohol tinge.  Taste a refined bourbon and coke. There is a smoky or ""char"" quality throughout. Dark fruit with sweet cream. Nice mild bitterness at the end with alcohol lingering in the nose.  Very creamy, thick and pleasing.  This is my first KBS and I have a few left to rifle through. Anywhoo, overall this is top-notch. Being critical though--I did not pickup cocoa on the palate and the alcochol, not the bourbon, is a bit distracting for me. Also, the aroma was very intriguing, that kinda did not come through on the palate. I find BCBS a touch more complex overall. Nonetheless, I would definitely keep this in my rotation at all cost and I look forward to seeing how it ages.

Thanks to my trading partner iHEARTbeer247 for hooking me up with this one.  Appearance: Pours a motor oil black with a tiny, bubbly dark mocha brown head which dissipates quickly leaving a ring around the edge of the snifter. Excellent lacing.  Smell: Dark roasted coffee, milk chocolate, oak, vanilla and a slight hint of alcohol. Smells excellent.  Taste: Dark roasted malt with a nice amount of sweet chocolate up front followed by molasses, vanilla and before ending with oak, bourbon and a touch of black pepper at the finish. Aftertaste is coffee with a touch of sweetness. The alcohol is hidden very well in the background behind the robust and complex flavor profile.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and thick with just the right amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. This one is ridiculously smooth for a beer with 11.2% ABV. It could definitely sneak up on you.  Overall: Incredible beer overall. Rarely does a beer live up to this kind of hype, but KBS absolutely is worth all the acclaim. I can't recommend this beer enough. If you ever have the chance to try it, you must do so.

1199,19960,C20Percent,4.37,"KBS bottled almost one year ago!  A: Pours an inky dark black with little to no head -- not much more to say. Very clean. Looks like a solid BA Stout. Nothing too special, though. Gonna add some points here because for a beer with minimal head the lacing wasn't half bad.  S: Smells like a bourbon bomb. Oaky. Some subtle coffee notes in the background. Some vanilla, maybe. But, for real, bourbon.  T: Taste waaaayyy better than it smells. Bourbon taste so mild. Alcohol is very mild, yet warm. The oaky vanilla is the first thing I tasted. Tobacco. Leather. Some chocolate , even. Super nice boubony-warm finish. The roasted malts and coffee flavors have really mellowed out over the past year. There's even some sweetness in here. Fantastic.  M: Smooth and creamy. Coating the mouth in what I could only describe as a stout liqueur. Still very nicely carbonated after the year. Velvety. Buttery. Think body. Very good chewiness. Great feel all around.  O: What a great tasting Stout this is. The appearance and smell give way to a wonderfully tasting brew. Gotta try it. I suppose I'd try it fresh the next round, but this beer tasted really good with some age on it too. Great brew. Did not disappoint.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,montrealbcr89,4.56,"FInally was able to try this one fresh.  A: Poured a very dark brown, verging on black. Highlights of brown and red. In the glass, the beer is pretty much black, with blood red hints around the edges of the glass. The head was a dark khaki brown (3/4 of a finger) that dissipated very quickly.  S: Upfront, you get the coffee. This is a nice change, as the other time I tried KBS (an aged bottle), the coffee was gone, and the bourbon was dominant. After the coffee, you get the bourbon, along with the vanilla and a touch of coconut. And then, all of a sudden, you are hit with strong notes of sweet, runny chocolate. I really dig the balance between coffee, chocolate, and the bourbon characteristics.  T: Again, coffee upfront. Then the bourbon, and the vanilla. NO soy sauce (which I got hints of in the aged version). Bitter chocolate with subtle bourbon notes. This version (although I am aware that FBS is not the base beer) is very much reminding me of FBS. The bourbon is not ""hit you over the head"" which I enjoy in a BA coffee imperial stout. I would dock this beer slightly for what I feel is a SLIGHT lack of chocolate.  M: A little higher than medium-bodied. Really nice. Carbonation is JUST enough for the style. So, so drinkable. I am trying to savour my one and only bottle, but it's going too quick.  O: Really reminds me of the 2013 batch of BA Peche Mortel. This is not a ""in your face"" BA beer. The subtlety works well. Really enjoying it.

Super thick, jet black pour with one finger caramel colored head that fades pretty quick but with excellent lacing. The nose is simply amazing! One of the greatest smelling beers of all times. Dominated by the bourbon, but not far behind are the roasty coffee, chocolate, and oak along with hints of vanilla and booze. The taste is just as stellar. Perfectly balanced with the bourbon, coffee, oak, and chocolate once again the stars. Hints of toffee, vanilla, and dark fruit round it out nicely. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy and smooth as silk with a wonderful subtle, warming alcohol burn on the finish. The influence from the barrels is absolutely amazing. Huge woody character much like I get when drinking a good oak aged wine. Overall, this is as close to perfection as you can get for the style. And it's consistently spot on every year.

1199,19960,LinusBohman,4.41,"Bottle from 2010 (thanks adrock7309 for the trade), drunken January 2013. Served from bottle at room temperature into a snifter.  A: Black as a cloudy Kentucky summer night. The thin head is brown mocha coloured. No fizz apparent. It leaves some lacing and sugar residue on the sides of the glass but not as clearly as you would see in lots of similar brews. The head resides quickly and leaves only a thin ring of brown foam around the deeply black liquid.  S: The big ones are coffee, chocolate, bourbon and vanilla. The coffee and the bourbon sticks out. There's also a tart fruityness that is best described as remeniscent of blackcurrants. I can defenitely sense som ethanol there aswell. Hop character is not apparent, neither are any other fruity esters than the blackcurrant.  T: This is multi faceted with an interesting transformation as it travels over and gently caresses the taste buds. On the tip of the tounge I get a sweet yet sour taste which I perceive as spot on blackcurrants. On the mid-part of the tounge, to be specific on the sides of it, I get sweetness and chocolate. After this taste I get bourbon with a distinct vanilla character to it. It all finishes at the root of the tounge with an overpowering coffee taste that ends with a bitter sensation with tastes of dark roasted malts and after that distinct alcohol. The aftertaste is coffee and chocolates with a hint of bourbon and it stays with me a long time afterwards, getting sweeter after a while.  M: Creamy and oily yet not overly thick. Very little carbonation but I would say the body is on the lighter side of full. Has a warming of alcohol and bitter dryness as the last impression.  O: This is a beer that has loads of character and depth. There's some really huge chracteristic tastes battling for recognition and I'm a bit impressed that they pull it off as well as they do. But I would say the coffee tends to dominate a little too much and alongside with the alcohol being able to see it's way through this maze of tastes and smells I would not rate this a fiver. I would appreciete a tad more subtle chracters for it to blow my mind completely.

1199,19960,KFBR392,4.97,"Bottled on 2/17/12  Appearance: Pours pitch black with a consistency that looks heavy but not over the top. A very thin menacing head formed and some slight carbonation remained through drinking. No lacing on the glass as to be expected. Enjoyed out of a goblet shaped glass.  Smell: What jumps out right away is the chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon. The vanilla/bourbon combination really packs a punch in the body of the aroma with the dark chocolate undertones following. A cherry and oak darkness looms as well.  Taste: Up front, the oaked flavor carry the front of this beer which quickly yields to the wonderful vanilla flavors. Truly wonderful. The bourbon flavors warm up the back end of this brew. The high ABV is cleverly hidden in the powerful flavors. The lingering flavors never seem to stop which a attribute to the masterful bourbon accents. There is also quite a nice hint of coffee presence. The complex layers make this one of the best in the world. I got chills drinking this brew.  Mouthfeel: A heavy lacing takes over. Have I mentioned the bourbon? Because it continues to be a major player here providing a sticky mouthfeel. The vanilla/caramel creates a sweetness that is to be remembered. The perfect balance of a heavy mouthfeel without being offensive.  Overall: The first time I had this beer it changed how I drank, appreciated, and thought about beer. I continue to be blown away by the complexity in this beer. I think it is unfair to try and compare FBS and this beer due to how completely different they are. Both are two of the best beers in the world for very different reasons. Founders is the gold standard of Stouts in my opinion.

Started off drinking it nearly out of the fridge, but savoured it for awhile till it warmed quite a bit. Lots of reviews obviously so will keep this short...  A- Very dark, slightly brownish if you hold it up to the light, dark tan head, initial build up, quick die off. Alcohol lacing on the sides....  S- Strong dark aroma's, some dark malt and roasted coffee, light sweetness (vanilla?), more than a touch of dark chocolate and decent amount of woody bourbon....  T- I found the taste quite affected by the temperature. When it was first poured and cold, I found the bourbon really popped and the alcohol. It was really overpowering but I found this quite nice for a change, you hardly noticed you were drinking a beer! As it warmed it came more into balance. Overall, either way it was still really balanced, though the chocolate and bourbon flavours do dominate as others have noted, and I get a bit of the sweeter vanilla too followed by some coffee-like-bitterness (do note that this beer actually contains quite a bit of hops for a stout, at 70 IBU's... but not having tried a fresh batch I can't say if some of this bitterness/coffee flavour disappears over time, as this bottle was already 8 months old, after a year in barrels, so I would imagine a lot of the hops disappears at this age.  M- Creamy, extremely smooth, med-light carbonation overall and a decent body with just the right amount of alcohol for a 11.2%... about what you'd expect from something almost 2 years past fermentation...  O- Didn't really have expectations with this one... Have not had a ton of bourbon barrel aged beers but overall one of my favorite styles for their complexity and uniqueness...that being said, I have had some really decent ones, but this one blew me away right out of the bottle... would say so far this beer could easily skip being labelled 'bourbon' aged because for me it really stands out as a defining taste in the beer and really comes to the front, instead of being overpowered by the amount of malts that must have been used to get this one up to a 11%.... As with almost everyone else, so far this has set the bar for this style for me... would have been nice to compare this to other same styled beers, but I would imagine you'd not be able to taste anything else after... will be interesting to compare this to the BORIS which is up next....

Estimated calories - 336/12oz  Price - $23.59/4pk  Yeah baby, pours pitch black with a creamy brown head and simply put, looks absolutely amazing. My mouth is watering just looking at it. Head retention is limited but the polka dotted lacing is both decorative and abundant. Some red edging is noticeable as the snifter empties along with a shiny oily appearance on the bottom.

I could smell this all day...  Following the aroma the flavor is spot on with dark chocolate, vanilla, molasses and espresso. A perfect blend of bourbon sweetness. Everything works well here with not one ingredient overwhelming the others. Impeccably balanced.  Mouthfeel is creamy and syrupy with a thick and chewy body. Not much carbonation to speak of but the bourbon here tickles the taste buds in it's place. Very smooth and easy to drink at 11.2%. Finishes off with a nice warm feeling.

1199,19960,sjones5045,4.78,"Well, this is about as perfect as you can get. Founders perfected the bourbon barrel beer with this. It pours jet black with a minimal brownish head that fades quickly. Unless a stout is hopped up on nitro I guess this is par for the course. The appearance is probable the only thing regular about this beer.  The smell is crazy with tons of chocolate and sweet bourbon that hits you early. As the beer breaths it remains the same. Almost smells like a dessert beer.  The taste is heaven in a glass. The chocolate gets you first, then a bit of vanilla with a great bourbon sweetness that is consistent and bold. Smooth and silky are the words that come to mind while drinking this. The alcohol is pretty well hidden, but there is enough there to give a nice burn in the throat.  Honestly, I think I appreciate this beer more as I've tried so many others. I feel that all the other bourbon stouts hit you with tons of bourbon taste upfront. And what separates this from the others is that somehow Founders creates a very even taste all the way through. When drinking the other top bourbon stouts it seems like it all hits you at once rather than creating a unique balanced flavor. There may not be a wide variety of flavors here, but the ones that are here are so craft-fully blended and there really isn't another beer I've tried that can accomplish this. World class, and this is the reigning champion of the beer world as far as I'm concerned. If you really separate yourself from the hype and concentrate on the beer, I defy anyone to find a bourbon beer as well balanced as this.

Dark chocolate, vanilla/heavy oak notes, molasses, a light coffee note, and some booziness.  T- Heavy handed on the oak and bourbon notes up front, and a smoky wood note that dissipates quickly. Chocolate and some light sweetness associated with the Breakfast Stout portion come to balance. There's a little booze, but it's really quite well hidden. Dark chocolate and coffee bitterness hits later on as well. I get a slight coconut note as well (I get this on a lot of bourbon barrel aged beers). A lot going on here, and you can sit and pick out different flavors the more you sip on it.  M- Thick, syrupy. Carbonation is pretty agressive on the tongue, but not overdone. Drier on the finish than I would expect, and I appreciate that because otherwise I think I would fatigue on this beer quicker than I actually do.  O- I can't say it failed my expectations. Pretty much what I expected after having Backwoods Bastard a few times, and being a BIG fan of regular Bfast Stout. An excellent beer in every sense.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,mkotsayfan,4.97,"Thanks to a generous trader, I finally get a chance to try this great stout. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a dark inky black with a dark mocha colored head. The aroma is amazing - chocolate, bourbon, and coffee all stimulating the senses, and in a balanced fashion. The taste is just as wonderful, chocolate and bourbon are a little more pronounced than the coffee. The mouthfeel is heavy-bodied with good carbonation, and is smooth and silky.  This is how a BA stout is made, it is amazingly balanced and hides the ABV pretty well.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,PeterIngemi,4.57,"Poured from a 12oz bottle dated 02/17/12  A: pours black with a nice fat finger to finger and a half of chocolaty/mocha looking head.... Decent retention and some nice sticky lacing.  S: the first two things I get right of the bat are booze and oak... It seems like, most if not all of the coffe has fallen off, at least of the aroma at this point.... Letting the boozyness and barrel aged character really shine through... I also smell chocolate and some dark fruit, mainly pruneyness. The chocolate and burbon aromas mingle beautifully, like burbon fudge brownies almost.  T: much like the aroma, most of the coffe has deffiantly fallen off at this point... Which deffiantly seems to accentuate the booze and wood flavors going on here... There is a surprising amount of alcohol heat going on for a beer that has had almost a year to mellow. Upfront I get a touch of darkfruit immidiatley followed by burbon soaked, lightly charred,oak. All this along with some nice chocolatyness.... In the middle I get a nice bit of vanilla, which I always though was exclusively from the barrells, but have come to find out, is actually part of the base beer itself. I also get notes of caramel and toffe, along with the oakyness... And even a hint of dark cherry from the burbon.... This brew is very complex, and very delicious.  M: nice chewy heavy body... Slick and viscous with a creamy dry finish.  O: this beer is amazing... Delicious at all stages of its lifespan... As I have been lucky enough to drink several vintages over the last three of so years. It seems to me I like it best at about 6 months old... When the coffe has mellowed enough to really let the burbon shine through. But at the same time i do miss the coffee now that it has fallen off.

S: massive bourbon, oak, vanilla, sweet milk chocolate, fudge, alcohol soaked figs, sweet molasses, some coffee notes. beautifully balanced, immensely complex. just simply awesome!  T: again, the complexity is awesome. pleasant balance of bourbon, oak, chocolate, and dark fruits. coffee is more prominent here than what the nose portrayed and the alcohol is surprisingly very evident despite having nearly 2 years on it.  M: for me this was a disappointment, the brew is completely full bodied which is absolutely perfect, but it seems flat. and to my surprise, I get more coffee and hops lingering around with an intense alcohol burn (thought i would get more of a sweeten molasses or chocolate aspect).  O: its awesome but hands down Bourbon County Stout dominates this brew in every facet IMO. I have tried this brew 4-5 times now and this is the first time having it aged.

Hints of small bubbles. The lingering sweetness makes me salivate.  Overall: Absolutely superb. The aroma and taste are incredibly well layered and balanced. Nothing overdone, but nothing left out.

Nice consistency with sticky lace filled retention.  S - Big blend of things on the nose here. All in balance: coffee, dark chocolate, booze, bourbon and wood. This is amazing stuff.  T - An amazingly balanced melody of flavors listed in the nose. The flavors are all present, with no sharp imbalances. I usually can detect one note overwhelming the field, however this is the definition of harmony.  M - Medium body with a smooth feel. Carbonation is light.

1199,19960,Zach136,4.74,"Reviewed from notes. Had 12/10/2012.  Bottled February 2012 and cellared in appropriate conditions.  Poured into a New Holland flute at room temperature.  A: Standard stout appearance. Pitch black with a caramel head. Pretty solid lacing and head retention for 11.2 ABV.  S: Mostly coffee with a bourbon background and hint of vanilla. Woody tones as well. Just what you'd expect from a BA breakfast stout. A touch of booze as well, but much more subdued than any other barrel aged brew I've had.  T: A perfect, impeccable balance of everything sweet in bourbon, everything roasted in coffee, and just enough malt to remind you your drinking beer and not liquid gold. There's virtually no alcohol burn that's typical in their other BA beers like Backwoods. Nor is there any of the (undesirable to me) bitterness that straight black coffee has.  M: Oh so smooth. Very low carbonation and very rich, chewy feel.  O: Everything I ever hoped it could be and more. I'm really can't wait to try it fresh and see if some of the bourbon burn and coffee bitterness are more present, or if the same flavors I'm getting now are just brighter. Kind of hoping for the second option, as having one of these sit in my cellar for a year would test my will power.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,LaChupacabra,4.92,"A: Pours thick, opaque black with deep espresso brown tones around the edges. Has decent amount of mocha colored head from a vigorous pour. Head dissipated somewhat quickly, leaving thin foam ring around the glass and an oily layer at the top of the pour.  S: All the standards you would expect from a BA Stout: bourbon, coffee, chocolate, oak, vanilla, roasted malts.  T: Same as smell: bourbon, coffee, chocolate, oak, vanilla, roasted malts. Also some alcohol warmth. Great balance on everything, especially as it warms to room temp.  M: Thick, chewy mouthfeel. Leaves creamy coating on mouth. Low carbonation.

1199,19960,atigerlife,4.59,"Had a couple of bottles for a long while and decided to celebrate tonight. I'm guessing this is the correct beer, even though mine actually says ""Kentucky Breakfast Stout"" not the initials. Also, ABV is stated on Bottle as 10%, not 11.2%. But, must be the same stuff....  Pours dark black, black hole black. Dark soy sauce. Little/no head. Light brown color. Very mysterious looking.  Strong aroma, dark chocolate, coffee and molasses.  Taste is of dark chocolate, light bourbon [nicely done], oak and coffee.  Mouthfeel is thick, heavy, creamy.  Overall, a very, very nicely made beer. Can taste the love put into this one.

Smell: Maple syrup, burnt brown sugar, vanilla, bourbon.  Taste: Maple and vanilla dominate the front end of the experience. Afterwards, the slide downward through the flavor adventure gives way to bourbon, burnt brown sugar and a boozy ending. There's also an earthy quality to the ending I'm crediting to the barrel aging.  Mouthfeel: Slightly carbonated, viscous, creamy and smooth.  Overall: This is a great beer with so much flavor. Despite a tiny bit of a boozy ending, this is an amazingly complex and balanced brew that unfolds with flavor as you drink it.

Bourbon smell is almost overpowering  Edit (1/12/2013): after nearing a year of aging and a few months the booze smell is not as overpowering and there is a presence of dark chocolate in the nose  T: The taste follows the nose with the bourbon but that is balanced out with dark chocolate and that dark fruit taste from the smell but it is extremely well balanced I'm not a Bourban guy but I actually really enjoy this not over powering but a few strong heavy flavors that all are evenly represented  Edit (1/12/2013): There is a lot of dark chocolate in the front that is then balanced out by the bourbon but there are also definitely some presence of coffee or coco nibs  M: the feel is smooth very thick and very chewy almost a toffee like aftertaste feel but there is no hint of alcohol so it goes down very easily if it wasn't for the heaviness of the flavors it would be sessionable  O: This is by far and away the best bourbon barrel aged beer that I have tasted still but after finishing the whole bottle it did not sit well with me the booze flavor started to come out and hard anything isn't my thing if you like kentucky whiskey get your hands on this but if you don't may not be worth it  Edit (1/12/2013): Ive realized I just can't have a full bottle of this beer but after comparing it to BCBS on back to back days this is definitely the better of the two and is a really good beer, I now highly recommend.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,kylelenk,4.95,"First off, spectacular beer. Cannot wait until next year when the production is higher and the beer should be more available. I live here in GR and it sells out in the market usually before 2PM on the release day and the taproom has it for roughly a week.  I've had fresh and aged at 6 and 12 months. Definitely ages extremely well and it's an almost have to leave it in the cellar for a few months beer.  A: Similar to Breakfast Stout, the head dissipates quickly and leaves a little ring around the edge that produces nice lacing as the beer is consumed.  S: Bourbon, bourbon, bourbon, cocoa/coffee, and barley.  M: Heavy, thick, and a stomach full. The beer will leave you filled up for sure. Only complaint is how difficult it feels to drink two of these. IMO, should only be enjoyed one at a time or with a break/cleansing of the pallet in between. Heavy beer and completely capable of paralyzing your tastebuds.  T: Where can I start. Fresh, it's got a huge bourbon blast at the start. If you like the bourbon portion of BA beers, then enjoy this fresh. Bourbon is complimented nice with the traditional cocoa and coffee flavors so familiar in traditional Breakfast Stout. Aging it will produce probably the best flavor I've experienced in a beer. There are so many things to compare it to. At six months, I've used the words milkshake, chocolate milk, Jamocha Shake from Arby's, etc. It's such a wonderfully balanced ale at that point even though the bourbon has dissipated slightly and still packs the whopping ABV punch.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,BrownNut,4.57,"2/17/12 bottling drunk on 10/16/12. Served barely cool in a tulip. 2/17/12 bottling drunk on 4/30/13. Served barely cool in a tulip. Scores based on 2012 tasting.  A - 4.0 - Opaque dark brown in the glass yet not thick or inky on the pour. More dark tan head than expected (a finger), which still dissipates to a cap in a minute. A nice looking head while it lasts.  S - 4.5 - Straight up coffee, wood, a little pipe tobacco, nonspecific booze. Later in the glass the wood becomes more prominent. 2013 tasting - Slightly green wood blending into something savory on the edge of soy sauce but not quite, chocolate, just a hint of something like port or sherry, a little char, malty sweet caramel. The first three things I just listed come together almost like a Tootsie Roll, and also almost like the faded ghost of coffee taste. The coffee has really pretty much left it since six months ago.  T - 4.75 - Dark bitter chocolate balanced with some coffee. Those things border on a subdued char. Not very sweet. A nice bitterness coming from multiple elements - chocolate, coffee, char. Leaves a lingering tartness immediately upon swallowing, with coffee and and wood on the exhale. Aside from general booze fumes in the throat afterwards, I'm not really picking up a specific bourbon note like many others have. Maybe I'm immune from drinking too much bourbon over time. Later in the glass, the chocolate is sweeter, like the bottom of a glass of chocolate milk you've mixed yourself. Leaves me with coffee breath and for once I like it. 2013 tasting - Taste is similar to smell. The savory woody element, the chocolate, the mild char. Mild to moderate char aftertaste. The coffee has faded and the chocolate seems sweeter and less dark/bitter. I'd probably give it a 4.5 at this age rather than a 4.75.  M - 4.5 - Just shy of medium body. Very smooth. A little lingering sting on the tongue. 2013 tasting - Comes across closer to medium-heavy than 2012 tasting. A nice texture ending in a bit of stickiness. The previously noted sting comes across more like a faint numbness and abrasion at this point.  O - 4.5 - This is a mature beer, and no pun intended. It's a grown-up stout that doesn't lean heavily on syrupy sweetness. A number of the big stouts are like drinking pudding, which I like a lot, but which can make them seem more like rare, special occasion beers. And sometimes they really make you work, making you go slow lest you be punished with too much intensity. This one is robust and rich yet with a drinkable body. You still want to sip it because of how well it is made, but its body and balance put it more in the category of normal beer that you'd like to have anytime, not just when clearing out the schedule for a special occasion, even though it's definitely special. One of the top 5 beers I've had to date. 2013 tasting - Very nice, very enjoyable, very mature, very distinct, very memorable. It's one of the top beers for good reasons. The coffee fades over time and it seems to come across thicker with more age. Still one of the best and most memorable.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,williamjbauer,4.8,"Shared with good buddy Eric before going back to the grind at work. Bottled served in two pilsner glasses, refrigerated and allowed to warm to room temperature.  A - Black with a ruby tint with a huge 3 finger dark brown fluffy head with excellent retention and great sticky lacing all around our glasses.  S - Warming bourbon notes, chocolate, coffee, flaked oats, oak wood notes, dried fruits. The perfect blend of stout and bourbon aromas.  T - This is one hell of a sipping beer. Really does embody the character of a bourbon while still fully hitting the great chocolate, coffee, espresso bean, vanilla, malt, and a touch of flakes oats that you expect in a stellar imperial stout. The balance is truly refined and my brain bounces quickly from the bourbon flavors back to stout notes, but these are blended masterfully and the alcohol is very much present, but draws out the other flavors rather than inhibit.  M - Very warming booze with a full body and low carbonation. Chewy.  O - One of my favorite beers of one of my favorite styles. This really did live up to the hype and I can't wait to get my hands on another.

1199,19960,Darkmagus82,4.61,"Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass  Appearance – Served a black colored brew with only a tiny off white head which faded very fast to leave some patchy spots of lace on the sides of the glass as well as some small islands of foam floating on the top of the brew.  Smell – The aroma was lighter then I was initially expecting. It had nice notes of coffee, dark chocolate, some vanilla sweetness and a nice boozy bourbon aroma. While it was light it was quite nice and warming in smell.  Taste – The taste begins with roasted malt and coffee flavors. Some sweet vanilla and dark chocolate are up front and grow stronger toward the middle. While these flavors grow stronger, some lighter bourbon flavors come to the tongue. While the bourbon starts out lighter, by the end it really picks up in intensity with the chocolate and caramel lessening some in the profile. Along with the boozy flavor increasing in intensity, so too does some of the coffee flavors, which in the end, when combined with roasted malt flavors creates a quite roasty and pleasantly bitter boozy taste on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer was on the creamier side with a carbonation level that is below average. Both the lower carbonation and thicker-creamier body are fantastic for the brew and really accentuating the roasted, coffee, and bourbon flavors of the brew.  Overall - A very tasty beer and one that is well worth a try. While it is fantastic with its wonderful roasty and bourbon flavors its reputation precedes it some. I actually think Founders Breakfast is more balanced then the Kentucky. While with this said however, the Kentucky is definitely a beer to try if you have the chance.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,melliott,4.59,"Bottle poured into wine glass (don't ask) - I had this after sampling dozens of other barrel-aged beers and my senses were getting fatigued. This beer remedied that, with bold and full flavors that didn't separate.  Pours dark with little head, which released its coffee and bourbon aromas which I could smell before I brought the glass to my nose. A sip is a mouth-full. There's a bit of a kick from the alcohol, but even that is smoothed out. Unlike the Breakfast Stout, I detected less oak. Maybe b/c that has oak chips, which release more flavor than barrels, which is where the KBS gets its flavor.

1199,19960,JimsArcade,4.54,"2012 vintage. Pours jet-black with a significant amount of dark-brown head. Smells of coffee and a shot of high-proof alcohol. The taste is amazingly complex: oak, bourbon, coffee, Belgian chocolate, and toffee. The first sip can be harsh, but it becomes nice and smooth as it warms. One of the best barrel-aged stouts I've ever tasted.  I've had this on-tap and in bottles, both fresh and aged one- through three-years. KBS' defining characteristics drop significantly the first two years, leveling out by year three. I usually prefer beers like this aged, but for me KBS is best fresh as it becomes just an average barrel-aged beer the older it gets.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Aethien,4.6,"Pours very black with a small coffee coloured head that quickly fades to a small film on the beer that leaves a nice ring of lacing on the glass.  Smells like bourbon, lots of bourbon, oak, roasted malts, coffee and brown sugar like sweetness. Very heavy and strong.  The taste has all the nose has but adds a warmth and smoothness to it that is lacking in the nose. The almost overwhelmingly strong flavours are matches by a smooth and creamy body and the addition of plenty of vanilla in the flavour really compliments the harsher oak and bourbon flavours. It is quite boozy, as should be expected from a bourbon barrel aged stout.  Mouthfeel is smooth, full, creamy and warming. Exactly what I want for a beer like this, not something you'll drink quickly but a sipper where you can fully enjoy every last drop.  Overall this is a very good beer. Smooth, balanced and complex with a high enough ABV to make an impact. It can live up to the other whiskey/bourbon barrel aged stouts I've had and it certainly confirms to me that this substyle of the imperial stout is one of the greatest things in beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The pour is a thick black with a nice dark brown head that dissipates to a small head with tons of alcohol legs. The aroma is a deep roasty richness with bourbon, oak, chocolate, and tons of coffee rushing to the nose. Big aroma that hints at a decent amount of alcohol heat as well. The flavor is not as big as the nose, but it is just a beautifully well rounded beer that touches nicely on the vanilla oak bourbon and chocolate before going to all coffee on the finish. Really enjoyed this, though it wasn't a top 10 or so beer I've ever had.

1199,19960,chinchill,4.43,"12 oz bottle poured near black; opaque with a proper head.  Powerful, enticing aroma of dark malts, fine bourbon, and faint wood. Slightly boozy, but less than expected for over 11% ABV. There's a lot going on here, with even more complexity in the flavor. An excellent mix with good balance. Taste is just a tad too smoky/burnt.  M: full body is slightly harsh (recall over 11% ABV); medium carbonation, if off at all, is a tad high; smooth and warming.  O: had 2-3x in the past on tap but this was the 1st time bottled; perhaps because it had some additional age (no way to tell at this point) this was even better than remembered. An excellent big beer; very rich and complex, and a bit boozy in manner most may find appealing.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,MRAnderson,4.8,"Pitch black in appearance with a cocoa tinted creamy one finger head which i poured aggressively.  The smell is bourbon with tons of vanilla,dark and milk chocolates with some great expresso coffee notes.I just want to attach my sniffer to my face and live this way, that is how good this beer smells.  The taste of this beer is heavenly! Vanilla,chocolate,prominent bourbon on the back end with deep expresso notes..There is a warming effect much like whiskey on the way down to your stomach. There is quite a bit of boozieness to this beer which is expected with the high abv...This beer has more than a hint of Bourbon to it, it tastes like the barrels were filled with some whiskey before the beer itself was poured in to age..This is a huge beer and i personally love every aspect of it!

1199,19960,eclipse54,4.59,"Re-reviewing on 9/8/2012. Bottle dated 02/17/12 into a snifter.  Pours a dark, dark brown color that looks black in the glass. A light dusting of mocha-colored head appears but subsides quickly to a thin ring and faint central patch. Not unexpected for such a large brew I suppose.  The aroma is spot on; bourbon, vanilla, toffee, caramel, molasses, chocolate, date, plum, oak, maple syrup, brown sugar, and maybe even some dark cherry. Just a delicious smelling little world down there.  Taste does not disappoint. Bourbon, vanilla, and toffee lead in with dark chocolate, milk chocolate, caramel, and brown sugar following suit. The mysterious dark fruits (date, raisin, plum) come through, as does some dry oak and maple.  Mouthfeel is very smooth, with little gritty roast that seems to pervade a lot of stouts. A bit dry on the finish accompanied by some warming ethanol, but in a good way I suppose.  Overall, a killer brew that impresses me every time.

1199,19960,macrosmatic,4.62,"Thanks to MDunk for this one! Reviewed from notes. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into CCB pint glass.  A: Pours a very, very dark brown to black that reminds one of motor oil. No particular visible carbonation and forms only a thin tan head.  S: Booze/whiskey, dark coffee and dark chocolate. Excellent.  T: Follows the nose nicely - coffee, whiskey, almost a nutty amaretto. Hang is sweet balanced with some coffee bitterness, and some whiskey.  M: Medium body for style. Sweet & sticky mouthfeel. The alcohol/booze presence is obvious but doesn't detract. Low carbonation but appropriate for style.  O: Flat out, this is a really, really good beer.

1199,19960,cfrances33,4.41,"2012 bottle thanks to thebeerisgood enjoyed on 8/27/12 in a Founder's snifter.  Pour: Pitch black with a quarter finger khaki head. Recedes quickly to a rim. Surprisingly leaves a light lacing. Got some legs too. EDIT: this beer is revised from a 4.5 to a 5 (midglass) for excellent lacing, especially for a beer of this style  Smell: Huge coffee notes, followed by a fantastic caramel vanilla. Bourbon is really in a supportive role here. Some toffee comes through at the end as well, but only a tad.  Taste: Wow. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, toffee, and roasted malt all meld together is a milkshake of bourbon undertones. It is truly hard to distinguish where one flavor profile ends, and another begins. I would say a raw mocha start, which gets blended with the bourbon vanilla, and then blossoms withs caramel and toffee towards the end. Coffee has the final say, mingling with the bourbon as this hangs on the palate.  Mouthfeel: Like no other bourbon barrel stout I've had. This has all the flavors of a the best bourbon barrel imps (a la Parabola) with NONE of the burn. I'm astounded that at 6 months, this beer is so good and so smooth. A fantastic sipper, not necessarily because it's hard to drink, but because you truly want it to last.  Overall: This beer is a true gem.

1199,19960,Thehuntmaster,4.7,"355ml bottle 11,2% Abv. Served lightly chilled in an over sized wine glass. Bottled on: 02/25/2011  Thanks to Futura123 for this one, it has been one of my long time wants.  Appearance: Now this is what an imperial stout should look like! KBS pours pitch black and oily, with a rough pour yielding a massive mocha coloured head. The head lasts really well for a barrel-aged imperial stout and coats the glass in a beautiful pattern of thick lacing. A light swirl coats the glass in yellow-tinted alcohol legs.  Smell: Mmmm, this smells absolutely delicious! The initial nose is dominated by bourbon, vanilla, oak, sweet caramel, toffee and toasted coconut. After a few sniffs the base imperial stout notes begin to emerge, with dark chocolate, sweet coffee, dark fruits, dark caramel and cocoa-laced butter icing are well noted. The booze isn't totally hidden, but it has a quality bourbon feel and is hence far from unwelcome.  Taste: As with the nose, the flavour here is absolutely fantastic. Notes include: Bourbon, vanilla, oak, dark chocolate, sweet coffee, dark caramel, cocoa, toasted coconut, dark fruits, toffee, a touch of molasses and a hint of roasted coffee beans in the finish. The finish is moderately bitter (although it doesn't quite feel like 70IBU) and fairly dry. As with the nose, the alcohol isn't totally hidden, but is integral to the character of the beer.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, with a moderate level of some of the smoothest carbonation I have had. I wish Founders had put this stuff in a 750, I could drink it all day long.  Overall: KBS certainly lives up to the hype. This is a fantastic barrel-aged imperial stout and one I hope to have again many time in the future.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S - Heavy amount of chocolate, yeast, and some chipotle peppers. Very rich and strong. I get more of a oaky sting as it sits and warms.  T - Starts off lightly sweet, malty with hints of roast and spicy peppers. MId-stream brings in hefty amounts of chocolate and vanilla. Finishes a little bit cloying and sweet with some alcohol hotness.  M - Full bodied, thick and clingy. Not much carbonation to balance it. Some alcohol warmth as it sits on the tongue.

1199,19960,Dope,4.97,"2012 batch  A: Pitch-black pour with a large, dense dark brown head. Fades slowly, leaving substantial lacing on the glass.  S: What a smell it is. Nice but not overpowering bourbon. Caramelized sugar with some toffee and oaky vanilla. Hint of molasses. WONDERFUL rich roasted malt character. Lots of strong roasted coffee, dark chocolate and man is it creamy. Oatmeal smooths everything out and just makes it a dream to take in. Loads more vanilla on the back end.  T: Wow. Dark chocolate, vanilla and bourbon up front. Oatmeal in there again with a wonderfully smooth creamy texture. Nice roasted coffee kicks in with some bitterness and mingles with the dark chocolate and vanilla just right. Bourbon makes a comeback in the finish with a little bit of toffee, molasses and caramel.  M: Heavy, creamy and unbelievably smooth.  O: One of the best beers, period. The complexity and balance of flavors along with the strength is just stunning. It's got sweet and bitter elements. Bourbon melds in perfectly. Super creamy and smooth and the drinkability is insane for such a big beer. The only beer I've ever had better than this is CBS, which just had better lacing and legs and a slightly more complex flavor with the maple. Any stout fan should make it a point to seek out this beer, it's THAT good. If you get your hands on this, drink it fresh. The flavors are slightly sharper and even better.

Would rather have a CBS, Founders Imperial Stout, Founders Breakfast Stout, Hoppin Frog Oatmeal Stout, Stone Imperial Russian Stout, Old Rasputin, ect.

A truly amazing aroma on this beer (and vintage). I don't recall the 2012 having this much to offer in regards to aroma.  T: Follows the nose closely. Fairly strong pop of vanilla and bourbon up front combined with roasted coffee and bitter chocolate notes. Finishes with a smoky char and some pleasant bourbon heat.  M: Full bodied with a nice creamy texture. Nicely carbonated for a brew with this much ABV. It's pretty much everything I want in an Imperial stout.

A: Pours an opaque dark brown color with a relatively thin mocha-colored head of moderate retention. It's viscous and leaves quite a lot of lacing behind.  S: In a word: mouthwatering. Coffee, subtle bourbon notes, vanilla, chocolate. Very enticing and certainly no alcohol comes through here.  T: Opens with dark chocolate notes that give way to deep coffee flavors. The coffee notes add just the right amount of bitterness before giving way to a mildly alcoholic bourbon finish that top this one off very well. Delicious.  M: Full-bodied and creamy with a dry finish slightly reminiscent of whiskey. Complements the flavors very nicely.

1199,19960,Jugs_McGhee,4.09,"12 fl oz brown glass bottle with standard pry-off cap served into a snifter. Props to Schlimenhaumer for the bottle share - thanks, man. I've waited a long time to try this one and I couldn't be more excited. Expectations are through the roof. 11.2%. No best before or bottled on date. I'm approaching it skeptically on account of the hype.  Served refrigerator cold and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  Paired with dark chocolate.  A: Pours a one finger rich tan colour beautiful head of great cream, fantastic thickness, and damned impressive retention for the high ABV. Colour is a nontransparent solid black. no yeast particles are visible, but it's nontransparent and opaque. No bubble show. It's looking damn good so far.  Sm: Rich chocolate and quality mocha coffee java notes. Roasted barley and dark malts. Marvelous bourbon oak - but not too much. Who knew they could make bourbon so subtle? Some great vanilla on the climax; it's a bit buried but it's there. Cream. It's so rich and exquisite I can barely wait to drink it. Yet in spite of its rich complexity and subtlety, it's surprisingly restrained - it's moderate in strength. I'm just hoping the taste delivers on the promise of the aroma. No alcohol or yeast comes through.  T: Rich chocolate and exquisite coffee. Dark malts form the foundation. Cream opens and closes the beer. Roasted barley gives it a solid but subtle backbone. The bourbon is so damned subtle it's unbelievable. I'm having trouble finding the vanilla, but I do get it on the climax - though I will say I wish it were a touch stronger. There's a vague cookies n cream esque vibe to the climax. No yeast or alcohol comes through. It's all around incredibly balanced and very well built. I'm impressed. Very complex and subtle. This is a damn good imperial stout. Hardly any boozy heat comes through at all, except perhaps on the finish.  Mf: Smooth and wet. Rich. Creamy up front but the cream bleeds through to the end. Just thick enough; perfect. Ideal carbonation. Suits the flavours near perfectly.  Dr: Incredibly drinkable, especially for the well-hidden ABV. I'd definitely get this again - if I was so lucky. Really an incredible imperial stout all around. I quite love it. In a world populated by so many imperial stouts, it's hard to stand out - but this beer does. It lives up to the hype. I'm really blown away. It's not quite perfect, but it's a damn good beer - that's for sure. This one delivers.  A  --- 12/31/13: Truncated notes for a 2011 vintage bottle. Tasted side-by-side with BCBS.  A: No bubble show forms as it's poured.  Pours a half finger head of khaki colour which recedes within 30 seconds to 1.5 minutes. Body is a solid opaque black. No yeast particles/sediment is visible.  Sm: Sweet. Rich vanilla/oak bourbon notes. It's rare I find bourbon executed better than it is here - certainly better than the 2012 BCBS I'm drinking at the same time. Dark malts. Chocolate malts. Some subtle roasted barley. Cream. Gorgeous coffee/java with some coffee roast and the perfect amount of bitterness.  No hop character/alcohol is detectable.  T: Ah yeah. That's the stuff. Damn near perfect bourbon notes are seamlessly integrated with the base beer. Subtle coffee, good sweet dark/chocolate malts, cream, and hints of hazelnut.  There's the perfect amount of alcohol warmth, but no booziness or harshness.  Damn near perfectly balanced. Build is gestalt; you couldn't remove anything without damaging it.  Mf: Great creaminess. Smooth and wet. Great presence on the palate. Ideal body and thickness for the style. Complements the flavour profile beautifully, but doesn't quite custom-tailored specifically to it per se.  Dr: Incredibly drinkable for the high ABV. It's certainly a treat, but I do think I prefer it a bit closer to fresh. This is a beer I'll continue to seek out and enjoy. It's real difficult to compare to the BCBS - both are great beers, and I think age determines which is better.  High A- (4.25)  *** 04.02.15: Brief 2nd impressions from a 2015 bottle.  Opaque black with a restrained head that don't stay around long.  Aroma is luscious bourbon with great chocolate tones. Great notes of white oak.  The bourbon barrel aging is amongst the best in the business, and melts seamlessly into the chocolatey base, which boasts a near ideal sweetness. Balanced near perfectly, with a very cohesive gestalt build. Quite a treat, with ample subtlety to its execution and plenty of complexity. A nice cream note.  Nice creamy soft mouthfeel. Perfect carbonation. Full-bodied.  Fucking magical.  A-  *** 04/11/17:  Bourbon is reticent. Not a lot of coffee in this vintage. Plenty of wood.  A lot less depth of flavour is present here than in previous vintages.  B / GOOD  *** 2017 vintage on-draught:  Drops with bourbon soaked dark fruits and caramel alongside roasty bitterness.

I poured every last drop into a chalice Appearance is very dark with a thin creamy brown head, which slowly turns into more darkness. Smells good. Bourbon up front with some coffee and other good stuff blending in nicely. It smells kind of hot or boozy but this doesn't affect the taste.  Taste starts out with a very silky smooth chocolate followed by an orgy of sweet coffee and bourbon. Awesome. The sweetness lingers on the back of my tongue. Each sip lends more and more of the aforementioned tastes making this one easy to enjoy. The 11.2% alc lends a nice kick to boot.  Overall KBS is a superb example of what a bourbon barrel stout can be. This bottle is about 5 months old and I feel the flavors have mellowed a bit.

1199,19960,GR_Rick,4.77,"Poured fresh (2012 vintage) in March of 2012.  Review from a rather informal set of notes.  A: Nice, dark coffee-colored beer with a thin, almost non-existent head, typical of a high ABV beer.  S: Delicious smell of coffee, roast, vanilla and booze (which I love in a nice big stout).  T: Wow. A bit of bitterness, but not overly so. I got very little hops (I'm not a fan of hoppy stouts). Boozy, but in the best possible way (I like my big stouts a little boozy) as the bourbon flavors (vanilla, oak, etc) shine right through as well as the coffee. Can tell this beer as a little age on it already as the flavors seem to be distinct, yet meld together at the same time.  M: Thick, but not too thick. Went down very, very smooth for a 11% beer. Very little carbonation.  O: This is a very, very hyped beer, and after trying some, I can see why. Luckily, I live close to the brewery and have a generous brother-in-law who gave me this bottle, as, although it's fantastic, I'm not sure I'd go through the hassle some do to get it (I personally don't want to go through that hassle for ANY beer).

The solid brown head dissipated quickly into the black abyss which is KBS. No light getting through this one at all.  Oh my god! I'm turning into a religious person, apparently. The beer starts sweet. Its sweet like brown sugar, molasses, and vanilla. Hints of other flavors come through on the mid-palate like the coffee. I also get a grain-like taste that is akin to cheerios. The finish is chocolate, vanilla, and coffee with a slight taste of alcohol.  Full bodied with medium carbonation.

The initial aroma emits notes of bourbon, followed by hints of vanilla and roasted malts. First taste was of bourbon and the vanilla that comes along with the style. The aftertaste was warm and boozy with hints of vanilla. The beer lacks body to me but that doesn’t diminish from the taste.  KBS is definitely not as sweet as CBS but it is very good. Doing a taste side by side really magnifies the sweetness of the CBS.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,natemort13,4.58,"'11, poured into a snifter. Thanks Tim!  A hard, jet-black motor oil pour creates a dark mocha head that fades quickly into a ring.  Nose is strong bourbon and mellow coffee coffee with vanilla and dark fruits bringing up the rear. The nose is straightforward and does not play around but retains a ridiculous smoothness.  The taste brings coffee first then fades into bourbon with a strong vanilla finish. Lingering notes of smooth coffee. As the taste becomes more coating the bourbon becomes more prevalent. This is some of the smoothest bourbon I've ever tasted in a beer. Warming alcohol.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and coating. Alcohol becomes a little warming as it hits my belly.  Tough to live up to the hype, but as far as coffee stouts go, this one is right there.

Nice lace surrounds inside of glass. Aroma fills glass - coffee, chocolate. Taste: Where do I begin? For a great beer, I look for the ""wow factor"". I want to be blown away. This was Wow Factor times two. Multiple flavors - coffee, chocolate, bourbon blend like I've never experienced before. Nothing harsh about it. Not even in the sting of the alcohol.

Pours a dark brown/black color with a foamy brownish head. Lots of slow legs on the glass. Smell consists of an abundance of coffee, with a boozy undertone.

Pours a pitch black motor oil thickness, brown tan head that bubbles up like a tarpit from the glass. Beautiful. A tan ring settles around the circumference of the glass. Smell- amazing. Sweet molasses, caramel, honey, chocolate. Just absolutely decadent. Maybe a little bit of cinnamon. Taste- buttery caramel, molasses, spicy tobacco reminds me of Red Man from my HS baseball days. Sweet bourbon, espresso roast finishes the end. Wow. This is absolutely mind boggling good. This is so smooth, the bourbon flavor is absolutely present, but this shows no booze at all. I'm glad to have had the chance to taste this (thanks Eric!), and will seek it out again. World class, lives up to the hype.

1199,19960,JohnnyHopps,4.6,"This review is specifically of the 2012 vintage. While I had the 2011 vintage, I did not review it.  The stout pours a black color with little head and a leaving almost no apparent lacing. The initial aroma emits notes of bourbon, followed by hints of vanilla and roasted malts. First taste was a burnt malts, molasses, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and a big bite of bourbon. Hidden amid the bourbon was a hint of vanilla. The aftertaste was warming in such a way that it makes you aware of your own existence in an existential sort of way. As the bourbon mellows, the chocolates and the malts emerge and linger in the mouth. The thickness of the texture, most typical with lactose sugar, brings to mind a milk stout.  KBS lacks the sweetness of CBS, but is great stout in its own right. Unlike some in this mold, this stout is more than malt with a hint of whiskey.

Pours a dark, dark brown(almost black) color, with absolutely no head to be seen... but I'll let that pass, assuming it's due to the barrel aging. Practicaly no lacing.  Aromas are of dark roasted(almost burnt) malts, sweet molasses, coffee, some chocolate, some vanilla and a definate bourbon/oaky note. A bit of an alcohol bite in the nose to let you know that you're in for something special.  Flavors are amazing! Like the nose, I'm getting tons of coffee, bitter chocolate and the sweet molasses. Add the bourbon flavors and a bit of smokiness and you end up with a very complex, nicely balanced stout.  A medium/full body with a perfect amount of carbonation for this style. Feel is rather outstanding... smooth, rich, somewhat creamy and... well, BIG is a good word to describe it. Slightly bitter, and a bit of a dry finish.  Overall, I've had this beer in my cellar for awhile, kinda scared(for some reason) to open, and try one for the first time. I'm guessing it's just one of those beers, with so much ""acclaim""... that you just don't want to see it go away. I'm, obviously, absolutely impressed, and will be looking forward to opening my last bottle for some special occasion.

A: Dark viscose motor oil pour sits heavily in the vessel supporting a scant brownish-orange head that dissipates rather quickly.Dark and brooding.  S: Burbon laced burnt chocolate first arrives on the nose with a noticeable alcohol content that is pleasant and well mannered for its 11.0 abv nature. Burbon barrel woodiness comes through nicely, licorice, burnt barley and strong vanilla and cinnamon notes.  T: The flavor is thick chocolate slurry with a strong boozy burbon alcohol. Vanilla, cinnamon alcohol influence, burnt chocolate sweetness and barrel woodiness. A fade of alcohol heat comes with some dark fruit and burnt barley but the flavor is very smooth and silty like a campfire bitterness.  M: thick and creamy, viscose with a warming of alcohol glow. Burnt roasted chocolate bitterness warms the inner cheek and stays behind.  O: Im no fan of hard liquor but if I was burbon would be my choice of poison, just love the influence the burbon barrel aging on beers, especially a hearty stout. The alcohol is no slouch here, a heavy hand helping that compliments the thick viscose stout nature. Burbon and burnt chocolate works well together delivering a blast of bitterness to the taste buds.

Had this again on 2016-04-07 from a fresh 2016 bottle Lots of bourbon in the aroma. The chocolate and coffee taste are very fresh. Higher ABV than last year at 12.4%. Another winner. I think fresh is best. Had the 2017 version (11.8%) on 2017-05-18. Plenty of coffee, chocolate, dark fruit and bourbon. An extra good year. Had the 2018 version on 2018-04-14 in Bolingbrook, IL with rich mocha-coffee, dark fruit and molasses flavors. Had the 2019 version on 2019-05-04. As good as ever.

The alcohol is apparent but well-integrated.  M - Pretty thick body, light carbonation yields a smooth, creamy feel.  O - This is a delicious brew; especially if you like a forward bourbon flavor.

Appearance: Very dark almost used motor oil look (mean that in a good way) Very little lacing and almost no foam, very small rim around the glass.  Smell: Amazing Strong Bourbon Scent (I love Bourbon) a bit of wood and chocolate after but the bourbon hits you and gets better as it warms.  Taste: at first I think you get the other flavors and then the bourbon hits you. I get the tingle on my tongue then get a strong bourbon and then another after taste of bourbon coffee.  Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy, wow that sounds gay but very thick  Overall: Very impressed with this beer, I almost like it as much as BCBS 2010.

It leaves a trail as it slides down the glass.  S: Lots of chocolate, a little bit of coffee. It has some bourbon booze in there too which really tickles the nostrils in a pleasant way.  T and M: Lots of oak and bourbon are still prominent. There's a bit of coffee there too. These flavors really dominate the palate. There is a tiny bit of some dark fruitiness, but it's incredibly buried. It feels big, rich, creamy and chewy in the mouth with no astringency. So smooth and chewy. It's pretty hot from the booziness, even after over a year.  I really enjoy this beer, but I can't help but feel like it's a little bit unbalanced. The bourbon really dominates.

Forms a thin rim of turbinado sugar that settles down to a crown leaving light spotted tracks of creamy lace.  S: Smells of dark roasted malts with a big bourbon kissed oak influence.

T: Tastes is incredibly rich with deep roasted cereal/grains, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, and earthy oak. I get secondary flavors of coffee, toasted caramels, and bit of earthy spice hops. Brings in a slight bitter touch to things. Some warming booziness flares at the nostrils but this is amazingly smooth for an 11%+ ABV brew. Bourbon barrel treatment is masterful.

1199,19960,minterro,4.46,"2012: Been holding off rating for a while to make this one #200!!!  Purchased from Spartan Spirits in East Lansing a weeks ago.  Poured into a wine glass (no snifter available)  A&S: Upfront (directly after uncapping) the smell was very pungent, lots of the classic imperial stout characteristics you would expect to find in a world class stout: bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, rich coffee, a tad bit smokey. After some consumption the smell faded greatly both in intensity but also in characteristics, I started to really only smell coffee and dark chocolate. The been has an very thick pour (very dense looking). Dark black colored beer that seem to have reflective qualities to it on the surface. Pretty much no head, when poured viciously there was about an inch of fizzy, tan head but it faded very quick.  T&M: Pretty intense but not blow you back in your seat intense, it has extremely good balance and is easy to especially for the style. The main flavors (pretty much the same as in the smell) I'm getting are more toward to back and instead of being mixed (like they are more towards the front) they kinda come at you in waves, its very interesting. Excellent bodied: creamy, thick, velvety (pretty much everything your looking for), pretty chewy. Carbonation very low.  Overall: I really enjoyed this beer! Its pricey, I'll maybe buy a single or a 4-pack once a year, but your getting what you pay for. As I think many people feel, I would love to do a blind tasting of CBS vs KBS vs Breakfast Stout, side by side. Maybe sometime down the road. I feel as of now I liked CBS much better.  On a side note: I tried a aged 6 month aged version of KBS and it was definitely less bold and way more sweet then before. Lots more marshmallow tones way less bourbon.  2013: 1#: First tried a few weeks after the release  More of a chocolate, coffee, and vanilla bean taste compared to the bourbon I remember from last years batch. I can feel the alcohol earlier then I remember. Lots of dark chocolate in the nose.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The aroma is packed with chocolate, coffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon and caramel.  The taste follows very much the same way. Right off the bat it's kinda sweet with the vanilla and caramel taste and then that fades to the chocolate and dark coffee with roasted malts and then finishes with a bourbon burn and a slight bitterness.  Extremely fully bodied and creamy, this is almost too easy to drink, but there is a definite alcohol burn. You can't really taste it as much, but you can definitely feel it. I'm letting 2 bottles age to see how this mellows out.  Another great beer from Founders!!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,harrymel,3.98,"Latest review: Vintage 2012, reviewed 02MAY12 This one pours black as ever, with a good etched tan surface. Up in the nose: cocoa, so much chocolate this year, it's insane....and I dig it. Coffee comes through in the secondary, and then the vanilla bourbon notes come through. I gotta say, nosewise, that this is beautiful, but no longer worth the trouble on the nose aspect vs. FBS for me. Flavor, vanilla, bourbon and american oak up front, upon moving to the posterior lingual aspects, I get an alcohol burn and some nice cocoa, but really more bourbon character - okay, this is way better than FBS, but still, in the current trade market, not quite $ worth it for me vs. Abyss. Smooth, but a bit hollow with a litter higher carb than I'd prefer in this style. All around great brew, worth at least two or three tries. Really admire everything Founder's does. 4/3.5/4.5/3/4-  Thanks to Chaney for this brew! Bottled 02/2010 2nd time: bottled 02/2011 - sampled 3/2011 4/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.48 Poured to NB Globe at around 50F A: Deep, dark, black ale with opacity which it seems difficult to overcome. No light, not even at the edge of the beer. No carbonation evident, just black, thick beer. When agitated, can get a small appearance to provide evidence of carbonation. A2: Same as above. Add thick quilt of dark mocha head which hangs around. Little lacing. S: Coffee, dark chocolate, hints of bourbon, good and sweet vanilla tones intertwine with plenty of malt goodness. This develops over the course of the beer and further accentuates the the chocolate tones. S2: Coffee again. You know, the bourbon is just not here, too much coffee! T: Wow. It's the most chocolate I've ever experienced in a beer. Dark, +85% pure, but chocolate nonetheless. I almost want this beer to be served warm, oddly. So much coffee continues to highlight this beer, and I can't think but wonder how they did this. Just delightful. Just a hint spicy and hot with the alcohol. T2: More coffee this time around. Still no bourbon. Why don't they just skip the barrel? Lakes and East Coast seem to be obsessed with coffee beer. okay, okay, there's bourbon on the back end, but not substantial. Okay beer, not as good as the homers make out. M: Heavy, thick, sticky. Dries the tongue, dries my life. Sucks me dry and compels me to fill my mouth with more of the seductive beer. Low carbonation. Well played. M2: see above. O: This beer is good, no doubt. My problem is with the bal presence. Here's the thing, if you want to have a coffee beer, have a coffee beer. If you want to have a BBA beer, have a BBA beer. If you want to have a BBA/coffee beer, learn to balance them. I can't say I will pursue this as aggressively next year. It's just not that great.

S: toffee, burnt coffee, strong whisky with some soy sauce/molasses mixed in.  T: Heavy sweetness at first then the whisky comes in across the palate very strong, then comes bitter roasted malt with a vanilla finish.  M: For not having much head to speak of this beer does have an appropriate amount of carbonation. This beer has kind of a slick, oily mouthfeel with a prominent alc. burn.

S: Vanilla and hints of coffee. Just want I wanted. However, I also detect something astringent...I wonder if it's soap residue or strong alcohol.  T/M: Bourbon and vanilla nibs. Harsh but strong. Silky smooth mouthfeel just glides down the throat. Not obviously excellent, but actually quite well-balanced. Loads of chocolate malts and a touch of bitterness from both hops and coffee beans.  O: A pretty great beer. I would definitely have some more if I could ever find any. Incredibly drinkable for the ABV and the epitome of a bourbon-barrel aged beer. They don't get better than this.

A - Pours out go the bottle a very dark brown, almost black body. Settles in the glass pure black with a finger deep brown head. Head settles to a slight soapiness on top of the obsidian body. This is how stouts should look.  S - Friggin' awesome. Big notes of coffee, dark chocolate and oak. The woodiness is massive but not overbearing. The barrel character really shines here. Vanilla is present as well in dashes/  T - It doesn't get much better than this. I can't think of a better blended barrel aged stout. Huge woody barrel notes, huge coffee and huge vanilla/chocolate all working together in perfect fashion. This is like a celebrity sex party.  M - Thick, creamy and perfectly carbonated. Coats your mouth like it should. Alcohol burn is there, but pleasant, and this beer loses that over time anyways.  O - Brilliant beer that is well worth the hype.

Poured from the bottle into a CBS snifter. Pours a deep dark brown/black with a dark brown head.  Smells of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, alcohol.

1199,19960,starrdogg,4.54,"Served alongside the regular Breakfast Stout to get a comparison between the two. Have had this beer a number of times, but only finally getting around to reviewing it.  Beer pours a pitch black with a medium tan head, more head than it's non-barrel aged little brother. Smell is just incredible here, the bourbon takes center stage, but it's mixes fantastically with oak, coffee and chocolate to make an amazing aroma. Bourbon, oak and vanilla really stand out in the flavor here with the coffee really taking a back seat (especially compared to the original). It's got a nice chocolate-y finish and is extremely smooth. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, I've actually always felt this beer was a little overrated, but this particular bottle that I'm reviewing is excellent (maybe it's always been excellent?). It's a little more bourbon-forward than I remember, and I wonder if that's a product of drinking the original next to it.

N - Whiskey, oak and cream, strong notes of vanilla bean, cocoa, burnt toast, boozy; very bready backbone like biscuit, reminds me of a chocolate brownie. Suggestions of dark, sugary fruits like fig, raisins, glazed fruit and even candy corn.  T/M - Chocolate brownie, biscotti, quite fudgey, chocolate chips, vanilla bean, coffee and cream all set against a chewy, dense mouthfeel; balanced for a BBA imperial stout - it has just the perfect touch of bourbon whiskey and charred oak in the finish.

It's black, it leaves a slight dark coating on the glass as you swirl it, the head was minimal and it disapated quickly to a light ring in the glass, legs abound as you swirl or tip the glass.  The smell is of boozy bourbon, light notes of chocolate and vanilla hit me while the oaky bourbon stays in the spotlight.  The taste is what you want in a breakfast stout, I get coffee, chocolates, and the bourbon. This growler is more boozy than past KBS I have had.  In my mouth it's silky and filling. It covers my mouth with warmth the way I could see it coat the glass. The carbonation is right and the finish is perfect for this style.  Nothing I can say can give this beer the respect it deserves.

Served too cold, had to let it warm in the appropriate serving glass (Founders snifter). 2/17/12 bottling opened at the time of this review.  A - Fairly dark, then a thick mocha head that slowly dissipates. Sticks very well, looks fantastic.  S - Massive amounts of smooth coffee, slight amount of vanilla in the distance. Hints of oak around the edges.  T - Roasted malt, coffee, coffee, coffee, then some barrel emerges in the finish with the coffee. The oak is present and gives a hint of dryness. Vanilla notes are the most present of the barrel flavors that come through in the end, but apparently there is already vanilla in the base so it is hard to tell. There is a lack of any real complexity for over the first half of the flavor. There is some chocolate coming through in the flavor after the first few sips. The finish is great, the coffee and barrel blend very well. I do enjoy the flavor more than I probably should.  M - Medium body, lower carbonation on the tongue.  O - Really a good one. The coffee is very smooth and tastes great. The barrel aging shows up well in the finish. 5/4/4.5/4/4  UPDATE 2013:  Shag hooks it up when I swung by his store, thanks man.

There are some beers out there that unfortunately have a lower score that are just as good if not better than KBS, and the hype on the KBS right now causes it to be almost un-getable in store, especially outside of Illinois.

S: Lots of coffee. fudge, oats, wood, with some light caramel and vanilla in the background. Hints of bourbon.

A- An aggressive pour yields a viscous, motor oil black fluid with a 1+ finger, brown head which dissipates quickly. Pronounced (as expected) alcohol legs coating the glass. Any light that penetrates the curves of the glass (as consumed) reveals a deep, ruby red hue.  S- Chocolate, coffee and bourbon (which contains the following in any order): vanilla, toffee, oak, toasted nuts and some dark fruits (like raisins) thrown in for good measure.  M- Much like the appearance, oily and slick...just the way a bourbon whiskey coats the toungue, but the 70 IBU's leave a dry woody finish leaving you with (dare I say) the need for another sip...at 11.2%ABV, that can get dangerous rather quickly. Strangely drinkable for a brew of this magnitude.  O- Is it beer/chocolate/bourbon, chocolate/bourbon/beer or bourbon/beer/chocolate? Hard to tell, but this is one complex brew and blurs the lines between beer and spirit...a sipper for sure. Another homerun from a brewery (I think) that can do ""no wrong.""  This is a must for beer geeks, but certainly not for the casual observer.

Had this once a couple of years ago, but I think I'll probably appreciate this more now.  The beer has an oily black color. Formed a one finger brown head in my snifter. Looks appealing enough.  Dark and roasty aroma and an alcoholic burn are the first things to hit the nose. The booze does turn in to more of a pronounced whiskey aroma with notes of coffee and chocolate.  The bourbon taste is definitely up front, then follows the coffee and chocolate. The beer has a finish of vanilla and finally ends on a minor licorice note. There is only a very slight lingering bitterness. All the flavors have their place, but mesh together wonderfully.  The mouthfeel was very smooth, slick, and oily. Pretty heavy in body and full flavored.  I'm very glad that I was able to re-visit it and have a few to sit on.

S - Dark roast, bitter chocolate, coffee, a strong oak aroma, and some bourbon. Some wisps of vanilla bean, but nothing compared to the other components. The aroma is a little different from any other beer I have smelled. The chocolate and coffee components are prominent, but there is also an overwhelming roasted, earthy, woody aroma that is undoubtedly form the oak barrel. The bourbon smell is as strong as any BA stout I have come across.  T - The flavor is dominated by the bourbon throughout. It starts slightly bitter with a mix of oak and baker's chocolate. This progresses to a sweet middle of the vanilla I didn't pick up in the nose and some fresh coffee bean flavor. The finish and aftertaste are big bourbon with an oak dryness and burnt flavors. The bourbon flavors are present and the beer is very large at 11.2 ABV, but I would classify the alcohol finish as warm, not a burn.  M - The feel is sticky and lightly carbonated. There is a slickness from the booze and it coats the mouth well. Nicely done.  O - I was happy to get a few of these and tonight decided to finally try one. I was very impressed with the strong roasty aroma which I found to be a complex blend, the likes of which I have never smelled.

First aromas are of sweetened coffee, slight chocolate, hints of caramel and roast, Kaluha, deep malts and of course... bourbon! Unlike Goose Island BCS, this one is not over the top on the bourbon alcohol booziness tastes. The chocolate coffee is complimented by just the right amount of bourbon. As the brew warms, I notice the bourbon tastes becoming a bit more prevalent. It has a very crisp mouthfeel, not very heavy or sludgy. 11.2% abv? Seems about right.

1199,19960,zac16125,4.77,"12oz bottle poured into my favorite snifter Bottled on date: 02/17/12 100th BA review  Big thanks to BobSmooth for this one, awesome trader...  A: Pours black as night, with only the slightest degree of browning on the edges.  Completely opaque and moderately viscous.  A very agressive pours yields only a faint outer rim of mocha colored head.  But the small amount that is there manages to leave a fair amount of spotty lacing.  S: Roasted malt, booze, a big oak character with the accompanying bourbon notes, a significant degree of bakers chocolate and some mild coffee.  T: There are a  very small number of beers in which I take the very first sip and literally say wow. This is one of them.  The palate profile on this one is complex and incredibly well balanced   The bourbon character is big, but not overwhelming. Other flavors noted are a hop bitterness, a hint of dark fruits with raisin noted, woody oak, some booze, dark and bakers chocolate, roasted malt, a touch of vanilla, and an almost astringent anise character.  There is a significant booze presence but it acts as a nice balancing agent.  Coffee and dark chocolate linger forever in the aftertaste. Fantastic.  M/D:  Silky smooth with a chewy mouthfeel.  Full bodied but not as thick as some other stouts I have had.  Has a nice warming quality.  ABV is noticable but not negatively so, and the drinkability is surprisingly high for such a big beer.  I really dig the smoothness but it could be a touch thicker.    O: This is a beer I've been waiting a long time to try.  I was like a kid on Christmas opening up the trade package today and seeing the big ""KBS"" letters.  Even with all that hype and expectations, I was not the least bit disappointed.  Is it my all time favorite stout?  No, I think that still belongs to Peg's Rare DOS, but its neck and neck with the Abyss for number 2.   A world class brew.

1199,19960,sukwonee,4.89,"Finally!!! Got to taste KBS - 2012, Bottle poured into a snifter  A: Opaque Black. Medium brown head (barely there). Okay amount of lacing  S: COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE, very slight bourbon, chocolate  T: DAMN!!! this is a great tasting beer. Coffee, Chocolate, very very slight bourbon & oak.  M: A bit on the medium thickness side. Moderate to medium carbonation. I wish it was a bit flatter and smoother, but hey.  O: I love this beer! I wish I get this all year around. I can't imagine this would age well though... (not too much body and all the coffee I am getting). Great Great stuff - so much better than FBS.  EDIT:  I just got a chance to try to 2010 vintage on 8/8/2012 and I gotta say great beer is still great beer whether or not it has passed its prime.  Coffee and bourbon definitely faded but dark chocolate is more dominent. Less boozy, but booziness is still there. Still sweet and bitter (or I should say bitter sweet). My score stands.  I have a bottle of 2011. I will give this a shot soon.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Hoptometrist,4.19,"Served from the bottle dated 2/17/12 into a tulip glass  A- Poured a super dark black, heavy viscosity like motor oil, one finger mocha/cherry colored head with tight bubbles and lots of alcohol legs. This looks like a big beautiful stout  S- Big bourbon, vanilla, oak, and alcohol notes. Some cocoa powder notes too. The aroma is dominated by the barrel, not a lot of stout aroma. Boozy aroma  T- Big rich cocoa powder taste, rich vanilla bean, oak, bourbon notes, some caramel and toffee, light coffee ground taste on the finish. Complex, good balance between bourbon, oak and cocoa notes.  M- Unbelievably soft, silky, and decadent mouthfeel. Full bodied, chewy mouthfeel, big alcohol warming and burn  O- It is a complex and flavorful big stout. Great silky smooth mouthfeel. It is a good beer with a little more heat and alcohol flavor than I like in a beer. I would love to have an aged bottle on this, but for the rarity and price I am not sure I will seek this out every year. There was not much coffee taste or aroma in this beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,emeline,5,"Today, a bottle fell into my hands thanks to the beer guy at Charleston Wines and Spirits. In great anticipation, I had to pour it tonight.  KBS pours a dark, deep red, color only visible in bright light and in the shadow of the glass. Barely any carbonation, just a thin ring of mocha bubbles at the rim, and a faint hint of air on the surface.  The smell is amazing. Vanilla, bourbon are the boldest, with just a faint hint of maple and roast.  The mouthfeel is the first thing you'll notice. Heavy and syrupy, the richness of the beer will coat your mouth and tongue with an amazing sheen of flavors.  KBS tastes like candy, in a way that no candy could possibly match. The bourbon is up front, definitely, followed by vanilla, the darkest of chocolates, a mapley flavor, and smoke, a mix of bacon and a fine cigar.  Finishing this richness is a dry, bourbon taste, leaving almost a caramel finish in the mouth. The taste sticks around, and would be well complimented with some vanilla bean ice cream and/or a fine cigar.  Totally worth the hype. Rich without being too sweet. Bold without being boozy. Beautiful color, texture and mouthfeel. 5/5, across the board.  http://instagr.am/p/JF_SQ8SgLy/",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The nose has a ton of coffee, more so than the bottle. Subtle bourbon, chocolate, caramel, tannin, and roast.  The taste is coffee forward with dark chocolate notes, roasted malts, light vanilla and oak. The bourbon is much more subtle than the bottled version. The balance and array of flavors is just as stunning as always.  The mouthfeel is thick and creamy as hell. Silky and beastly.  Overall, amazing beer. This is a great example of how a great beer can vary between serving types. Excellent for both ways.

Bottled 02/17/12 and poured into a Duvel glass. Pours black as night and thick as oil, no light passes through whatsoever. Smell of chocolate, vanilla and wood; all the tell-tale signs of a bourbon barrel aged stout are present. The taste matches with some underlying notes of peat and other charred flavors.  A full-bodied, delicious beer, one you have no excuse not to drink. Go get one.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S- Chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, fresh coffee beans, oak, dark fruit and a slight hint of tobacco. What a nice aroma. Plenty of pleasent smells that are expected from a beer of this caliber.  T- Bitter coco, bourbon, vanilla, coffee, dry oak finish, and alcohol heat. Very deep and rich, with lots of complexity. Some hop bitterness reside in the fresher bottle, I have had aged KBS ( 1-2 yrs ) and it's not quite as bitter throughout.  M- Smooth and easy drinking. A little thin for such a complex stout, but by far one of the most solid barrel aged ales on the market. The alcohol burn is noticeable but blend well with the other strong flavors.  O- One of the best. Although I do feel there are better, even within founders own line up, KBS is a beautiful stout every year.

Overall: I do not read any reviews before writing one, I don't check number nor anything else I just buy a beer sip a little and already have in my head what I think about.

I'm not one to buy into hype and typically go against the grain when it comes to things that are trendy and popular. This beer is definitely trendy in the craft beer world and you are considered some sort of loser if you haven't had it.  The taste is multi-dimensional and I am pretty sure there are several more dimensions beyond the roasty, woody, chocolatey, bourbon.... the list goes on.

The sip starts with bourbon and chocolate, but becomes temporarily awash with raw alcohol. Then the aftertaste comes, coffee, coffee, coffee, and all is forgiven. If not for the tiny ick moment of alcohol we'd be talking 5.0 here.  Classic FBS consistency -smooth, syrup, lightly carbonated.

1199,19960,thecheapies,4.66,"2012 KBS. Such a bitch to land the 1/3 of a case that I now have (unlike last year), but now it's time to enjoy the fruits of my efforts.  Poured into a just-washed snifter glass.  Sludgy pour yields black with a ring of creamed coffee-colored head. Three or four dozen bubbles perch on the surface. Great legs. Very viscous. Very rich-looking. Quite the promising start.  Trusty bourbon-vanilla nose with serious dark roast, black coffee, alcohol fumes, burned-out lactose, and char. Huge nose that's whiskey forward with some excellent oaky qualities that come off like sandalwood. Intertwining flavors include dark roast coffee, root beer, dark stewed fruits, bitter chocolate, anise, and butter rum.  Rich chocolate crossed with bourbon in the forefront, like those foil-wrapped chocolate candies that have a liquor center. Milk chocolate flavor with some added alkali, buttery vanilla, and earthy-toned coffee with some underlying caramel and smoke notes. Licorice in the finish washed-out with vanilla sweetness and wood from the barrel. Spikes of oak flourish from start to end, peaking at the last. Big ol' alcohol burn follows the whole presentation, as well, ranging from sharp to sweet to warming. The caramel starts to really shine as this one warms up. There's an almost spicy/minty hop element carrying out some supplementary bitterness that is both intriguing and beguiling. A top-notch imperial stout that goes without saying.  Other than being hot fresh, this beer is right on the mark. Thick and juicy, hearty and rich. Not much carbonation, but this one is a half-percent away from straight 12%.  An unreal beer. A massive, complex stout. A real treat. So happy to have it so good.  * * *  Revisited 1/13/13  Founders KBS 2012. Bottled 02/17/12. Poured into a Courvoisier snifter. Enjoyed side-by-side with Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout.  Pours super-black. One of the darkest beers I've ever seen. Very thick and oily. Like chocolate beer syrup. Even scrounged up an 1/8"" of light chocolate brown head. Great caramel legs.  Huge roasty malts with mega aromas of vanilla, dark chocolate, bourbon whiskey, and sweet black coffee. Perfect marriage of bourbon and vanilla. Whiskey mash notes exhibit a hint of smoke and pronounce the malt grains and balance out the sweet chocolate and coffee, along with the dark roastiness. The alcohol merely just comes off as odorous whiskey. Full-effect nose, and one of the best of the style.  So smooth after almost a year. Bourbon and mocha syrup and gobs of Madagascar vanilla flavor. The chocolate is almost fudgy; the coffee sweet and dark and slightly fading. Liqueury sweet. Dark caramel, oak, and whisps of eucalyptus oil and subtle peatiness round out the complexity. The middle is big and juicy with all of those decadent flavors in full-swing, while the finish is slick and sweet with a breath of booze and a short stamp of bitterness that makes all of the difference. Just an unreal stout. Super-high rating, deserved.  Feels packingly-full with light prickle from the carbonation and light burn from the alcohol. Sticky sweet, like a glaze upon the lips, but the feel and the swallow are smoother than granite. A lovely sipper.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A stronger smell of dark chocolate follows the other smells. Normally when a beer smells heavily of coffee bean, I am not excited to drink it because i am not a coffee person but whatever they paired with this beer, makes me very excite.  T: Initially I get a dark chocolate taste followed heavily by the coffee beans. There is a smokey flavor that empowers the finish of the beer and overwhelms my nostrils. This is definitely, in my opinion, what a imperial stout should taste like.  M: Good thick mouthfeel but pleasant on the pallet.  O: Overall, great beer. I am glad my husband did a trade for this.

1199,19960,wspscott,4.22,"12oz bottle in Duvel tulip bottled on 2/08/10  A: Pours a completely dark/black color with a thin dark tan head that disappears almost immediately. Interestingly, it does not look ""thick"" the way some RISs do. S: Lots of wood/oak, I always think coconut with heavily oaked beers like this, just had Weyerbacher's Insanity last night and had the same initial thought of coconut. As it warms, some of the bourbon becomes more apparent. T: Lots of oak with bourbon in the background, I like that the bourbon is very well integrated with the beer as compared to some bourbon barrel beers. There is a bit of roasted malt/coffee but it is not overwhelming at all, a little bit of sweetness and a hint of alcohol heat in the background, but just a hint, no evidence of 11% ABV. No hops at all, not even from the bitterness side which is somewhat surprising given the 70 IBUs stated on the bottle. The balance seems to be coming from the roasted malts, but they are not ""dominant"" at all. M: A slight carbonation tingle that fades very quickly on the tongue, very mouth filling/coating without being heavy. Surprisingly light, but still a little bit of creaminess. O: A truly awesome beer. This is an excellent campfire beer. I need to compare to a newer version because I am curious if it comes across as well integrated when it is new.

There is a small layer of tan bubbles that isn't quite a full head.  The aroma is full of chocolate and coffee. I wouldn't know this was a beer from the aroma.

1199,19960,kevanb,4.52,"2012 vintage, 12oz bottle into a snifter.  KBS pours a wonderful jet black color with minimal brown when held to the light, it’s like staring into the abyss. An aggressive pour yields a small caramel colored head, about a finger at most, but it vanishes quickly leaving behind a nice layer of tan film atop the beer with a significant amount of tan film along the circumference of the glass. The lacing is nice and sticky with thin webbing around the whole of the glass. The aroma is pleasant, a bit weak and somewhat astringent, alcohol is definitely apparent, nice smooth notes of chocolate and robust roasted coffee come through as well that finishes with a nice balance of sweet vanilla. The flavors are wonderful, much more complex than the nose suggests. Roasted coffee jumps out right away which leads to rich, smooth dark chocolate and sweet vanilla, which is much more apparent than in the nose. Soft toffee and caramel flavors are also apparent along with the bourbon, which at no point overwhelms the beer, but supports the other flavors exceptionally well. Slightly charred wood is also apparent, but it definitely takes a number of sips and tastes to really grasp everything that is going on, wonderful complexity. A nice warming sensation comes from the alcohol but is in no way a distracting heat, just a nice bit of warmth as it goes down. The body is absurd, extremely rich, smooth and velvety, it coats your mouth perfectly and gives the flavors a little extra oomph, not they needed it in any way.  Verdict: A pretty sensational stout from Founders. One of my favorites to sip on after a long day or after a great meal, it makes for a fantastic desert beer.

So what better than a beer that combines his two passions: beer and whiskey? Bourbon was as close as I could get.  Pours a ruddy darkness with a thin head of tan, dense foam tinged with maroon. The head doesn't last long, leaving just a ring and a few floaters. Disappointing head, but wonderful, glowing colors.  The first sensation in the nose is chocolate and then bourbon comes in second. After more contemplation, some red wine notes appear against an understated roast.  The first sip reveals some coffee notes, cut by some acidic booze. Chocolate still remains, but barely and there is a sense of cherries or maybe other dark fruits. The balance of the flavors is really nice with none really dominating.  But the real star in this show is the mouthfeel. Luscious, viscous, tongue-coating, mouth-filling or whatever your favorite way to say full-bodied, this is it. And then there's velvety, smooth, satiny and all every other synonym that fits there. You don't get better than this.

Can pick up some burnt caramel and chocolate notes.  Taste is absolutely phenomenal. At a semi-chilled temp - I picked up a lot of the bourbon/barrel flavors. Somewhat boozy tasting. As it warmed, the vanilla flavors came through, and the taste turned much sweeter. Very complex. This is a beer that you take a decent sized sip of, and let it roll around your palate. Awesome awesome awesome.  Mouthfeel was pretty oily, slightly carbonated. Really complements the complexity and flavors.  Overall - this is a world-class beer.

Maybe another year of aging would fix some of the things I didnt enjoy.  Served in snifter at Founder's.  Appearance Black. Nice tan head that took only a minute to nearly completely disappear.  Aroma Strong Bourbon aroma, slight alcohol burn, dark chocolate bitter smell and subtle coffee roastiness. Great smelling Beer! Everything you want in a big bourbon imperial stout!  Taste I expected to be almost overwhelmed by the bourbon based on the smell, but was surpised to find the coffee as the dominant flavor. Kind of disappointed by the lack of oak and bourbon notes. They were there, but just not in the amount that the aroma let on.  Mouthfeel Much lighter mouthfeel than I had expected and compared to other imperial stouts. With that said, heavy enough to carry those delicious flavors we all know and love.  Overall Still a great Imperial Stout and may really benefit from another year of aging.

1199,19960,Cheezus,5,"A - Pours like motor oil, pitch black with a small, dark tan head.  S - Immediately, the bourbon is the strongest notable scent, underneath is the hint of coffee and chocolate.  T - Even though the bourbon is the most powerful smell, it is not the most overwhelming taste. It's a very well blend of the three main ingredients.  M- On the tip of the tongue you get the chocolate, the sides of your tongue are taken back by the coffee and bourbon mix. The aftertaste is a hint of bourbon, like one would get from a bourbon on the rocks.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,deadonhisfeet,4.85,"2012 vintage. Poured from a bottle into a Brooklyn tulip. The pour is not quite black, but nearly so. It is extremely dark brown with an impressive brown head for a high abv, barrel-aged beer. The nose is subdued, but pretty rich. I'm mostly getting notes of baker's chocolate and oak along with faint traces of vanilla and coffee.  Full-bodied flavor and as creamy and slick a mouthfeel as any beer I've had. I was startled at how smooth this beer is. Many barrel-aged beers have rough edges (which I kind of like), but this stuff is frighteningly smooth and drinkable. In the front of the tongue, I get tons of rich chocolate, a bit of sweet vanilla, and some molasses and brown sugar notes. At mid-palate, some bourbon and espresso flavors join in and wake up the taste buds. Right on the finish, I get a very distinct rum-soaked dark fruit flavor that I wasn't expecting. It lingers in the mouth and makes for a nice, warming finish without seeming boozy at all. As the beer warms, the bourbon becomes more pronounced, the sweetness up front recedes a bit, and the warmth in the finish starts to heat up. The coffee flavors are everywhere. How the brewer gets so much intense coffee flavor into the beer without any unpleasant bitterness is a miracle.  This beer was pretty much what I expected it to be: gone far too quickly! The flavor is wonderfully tantalizing and complex and demands that you sip in complete silence with your eyes closed (!), yet the beer is so smooth and well-balanced that I had to fight the temptation to take huge gulps. While the nose was not as pronounced as I anticipated, the taste more than met my expectations. This was the very last beer in Founders' regular, seasonal, and specialty lineups that I had never tried. As such, it marks the end of a wonderful beer journey that every beer lover should try to make. Thank you Founders!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,TCMike,4.63,"Poured from a bottle it only produced a 1 finger, tan head, which dissipated quickly. The color was like well used motor oil. The only aroma was of bourbon, and a lot of it. This scared me, because I like beer, and I like bourbon, but generally don't like them mixed, unless the bourbon is faint. The taste was surprisingly smooth. The bourbon taste wasn't as strong as the smell had let on. It also had tastes of coffee, and vanilla. Next to nothing, as far as hop bitterness. It has low carbonation, and a thick, slightly sticky, mouth-feel. This is a very good beer in it's category.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Well I was really excited to get my hands on a 4 pack. That being said I am not as impressed as I thought I would be. I have had better beers and I have had worse.

T/M: The coffee and the bourbon from the barrel aging blend together so well. The bourbon flavors come through clearly but aren't overpowering at all. Sweet up front followed by the bitterness of the coffee. It goes down so smooth and creamy. The alcohol becomes just a little more prominent as it warms, adding a pleasantly warming sensation to the follow-through.  O: This is just amazing.

Bottle dated: 2/17/12  A - Pitch black with some carbonation, and a thin brownish head  S - Light bourbon, coffee  T - Roasted malt, coffee, oak wood undertones, and a buttery bourbon flavor yet surprisingly not overpowering as is typical for the style  M - Believe it or not, the body is somewhere between medium and heavy. Smooth, and the subtle carbonation and warmth from the alcohol, almost seems to soothe the tongue  O - If it wasn't so hard to find and Founder's made more batches, I'd make this one of my go to stouts. This is now my new favorite bourbon barrel stout. It is crucial to let this one warm up to about 50-55 degrees to experience the full range of flavors in this beer. It has a great mouthfeel, is complex and as balanced as a bourbon barrel stout can be given this beer styles strong bourbon flavors.

1199,19960,parchedjay,4.38,"Drinking two bottles back to back...a 2009 and '12. Lucky me! First time trying what I've considered the holy grail of stouts. Both pour black holes. Flavor profile similar between the two. Huge chocolate/nibs. Smell the coffee in both but just picking up a bit of iced coffee in the aftertaste (and my burps). Nice bourbon layer in both, much smoother in the '09. Both go down well, the '09 is much mellower and doesn't carry the slight bitterness of the '12. The '12 is a little alcoholic, the '09 went down sooo smooth, almost too easy. The aging flexes itself nicely. Of course they are both fantastic but a little aging does benefit the style very well.

Managed to get it for under $16 bucks for a 4-pack and was happy. Now....  A: Black. Dark coffee color, really creamy and thick looking. Like used oil perhaps. Good lacing, not much of a head with a good pour, but little mocha ring around the glass and nice tiny bubbles on the top.  S: Chocolate, bourbon, coffee, and a boozy fruit perhaps, but of the good old maple syrup.. Pretty inviting.  T: Bourbon. You really taste it, and it's smooth and not overpowered but enough to know the damn thing was aged in bourbon barrels. Really great chocolate, cocoa nib, roasted malts and coffee. Sweetness in there, rich cream. Great taste, you hate the hype until you taste it. Slight warming alcohol finish, but smooth is the key here.  M: Full body and chewy. Creamy and robust. Ultra smooth.  O: I friggin love it. I love stouts, I love higher ABV imperials. I love bourbon too. This beer is fantastic. I really wanted to not love it, the hype, the hard to find, the price gouging. This beer is flat out great. It's everything rolled into one and just works.

1199,19960,gregy55902,4.88,"I really loved Founders CBS, and I'm hoping this is on par. Founders is, by a decent margin, my favorite Michigan brewery (love Dark Horse and Bell's as well). Obtained one 12oz bottle from Andy's in Rochester, MN.  A - Pours a nearly opaque motor-oil black color into my XL snifter. Not entirely gentle on the pour - an aggressive 1-finger head forms and dissipates within a minute or two leaving beautiful bubbles and lacing.  S - Bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee, maple, roasted malt, anise, and various dark fruits.  T - Very complex taste. Vanilla, bourbon, coffee, chocolate, roasted malt. It really tastes incredible and gets better the more you drink it. The flavors linger forever, with chocolate and coffee being very prominent.  M - Very smooth for what it is. I usually have a hard time drinking 'bourbon beers' and this one is definitely a sipper, but it has a rich taste that is meant to be enjoyed slowly. Founders BB-aged it for a long time (1+ year), and it shows - it is 11.2% but there is minimal bite (on par with DH Plead the 5th).  O - This is a monster of a good beer and is right up there with the CBS. It may be hard to appreciate if you don't love a good imperial stout, but if you do then it is entirely worth seeking out.

This is the third year I have had KBS.  Founders did not disappoint. The aroma is the same amazing aroma I came to love when I first tried KBS, bourbon, chocolate and coffee.  The mouthfeel is so smooth, I love the bourbon up front and the fact IMO you can taste the chocolate, almost suspended in the beer.  The warmer it gets, the better it is.

S: I'm picking up a strong chocolate character in the nose; behind the chocolate emerges an extremely pleasant mixture of coffee, bourbon and vanilla. This beer has divine aromatics.  T: Up front I am getting a nice balance between the oak and bourbon. By the middle of the mouth the coffee and roasted malts steal the show. The aforementioned flavors lead way to a nice bakers chocolate flavor.  M: Liquid velvet.  O: One of the best Bourbon barrel aged stouts that I have had to date. In my opinion this beer stands much higher than CBS. I felt that all of the flavors mended together extremely well; all of the ingredients are showcased in such a well balanced manner.

S: Sweet chocolate upfront, with light coffee, and even lighter bourbon. Alcohol is definitely noticeable in the back, but not bourbon specifically.  T: Bittersweet chocolate upfront, yielding to dominate coffee mid-sip that lingers into the finish. Light bourbon in the finish, but not very present. Very well-integrated flavors, with the bourbon playing second fiddle to the choco-coffee stout.  M: Medium bodied, with full carbonation.  O: Enjoyable and not nearly as bourbon-y as expected.  2010 (Aged 2 years) A: Full black with no head and little lacing.  S: Cocoa powder, sweet, less complex coffee, little bourbon if any is noticeable. No alcohol noticeable, unlike fresh  T: Sweeter chocolate—less full flavored than the fresh, but sweeter. Little of the coffee remains and what does is a shell of the fresh coffee. Bourbon dominates the finish, much more noticeable than in the fresh, probably due to the lack of coffee.  M: Medium to light, with some carbonation, but not overly so.  O: Sweeter than fresh with the chocolate a little lessened and with the coffee all but gone. The upside is that the bourbon dominates the back to finish in an outstanding way. If I'm looking for a bourbon-y stout, I'd go for an aged KBS. If I want totally integrated choco-coffee stout with the slightest hint of bourbon, I'd go for fresh KBS. If I want a bourbon-dominate beer, I'd go for BCBS.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A vigorous swirl simply produces more edging with tiny amounts of lacing. Has some sticky alcohol legs though. 3.5/5  S - Strong fresh coffee notes followed by some milk chocolate, oak, faint vanilla and a touch of alcohol. As it warms up the bourbon becomes more pronounced. The coffee is just so prominent and dominant here, and this is some damn good coffee beans were talking about here. 4.5/5  T - Bitter coffee followed by some bittersweet chocolate and bourbon notes. Oak, vanilla and butterscotch. This is a beer for bourbon lovers. Its amazing how it starts off with dominant coffee and leads right into a fine bourbon. The finish is boozy and bittersweet. 70 IBU's? Holy hell! 4.0/5  M - I don't know how I feel about the mouth feel. It's medium with an average level of carbonation. As a stout lover I feel like it could be thicker and chewier. As a bourbon lover I think it works really well. The finish is warm yet pleasant. 3.5/5  O - I adore BCBCS because its blends the fresh and intense notes of coffee, the roasty and sweet chocolatey notes of a stout, and the rich and buttery notes of a good bourbon to a near perfection. KBS doesn't blend all of these elements together very well. In the end its a bourbon strong coffee beer with a light body.

Bittersweet chocolate, oak, and vanilla. 3.0/5 O - This is at an awkward phase right now. Majority of the coffee has faded but it hasn't yet melded into the sweet chocolate beer that the '10 is. 3.5/5  02/08/2010 vintage into a brandy snifter.

Oak on the finish with no alcohol present. Body seems a bit thicker here. 4.5/5 O - This is unbelievably delicious. Amazingly sweet chocolate flavor with a nice bourbon finish. However, the coffee flavor is all gone which makes this beer so unique. 4.0/5  In conclusion I found the beer to have an amazing aroma and a damn good taste when fresh. Great coffee and bourbon notes. The mouth feel was a bit too thin for me though. At a year old its lost most of the coffee flavor but has retained that coffee bean bitterness. Seems like its at an awkward phase in its life. At two years old all the coffee has left the building as well as that awkward bean bitterness. Its become a delicious sweet chocolate stout with bourbon notes. Similar to BCBS but with a lighter body. Two years seems to be the sweet spot for this beer aged.

1199,19960,anglagard1,4.72,"Found this tonight at my local supplier.I am not worthy. Wow. The smell alone is really amazing. I'm not really partial to the idea of beer aged in burbon barrels, but the whiskey smell is just one item in a bouquet of aromas. Bourbon is far more prevalant in the taste, but even here there is a lot going on. Swallowing gives a little whiskey bite in the back of the throat. The whiskey barrel taste is a little more dominant than I'd like, but there is still a lot here to enjoy. I'll be honest and say my reviewing skills are not up to snuff to give this a fair description. Vanilla is probably the second strongest taste, followed by molasses. There are many flavors but they appear quickly then are gone, too quickly for me to identify them. Buought two bottles at $5 each and wished I'd bought more.I'll go back tomorrow, but I'm guessing it'll be gone. Truly an experience, but I'm not sure how repeatable it would be.

There must be some hops in there, but its main effect is to balance the other ingredients.

If you are going to age something in bourbon barrels it had better be a blockbuster to start with. This works.  For comparison, I had saved a bottle of Backwoods Bastard. The BB is sweeter, lighter in color, and not as big. It really isn't fair to the BB to compare it to KBS, but if you want to know what KBS is about, there is no substitute.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,TheFightfan1,4.27,"After all of the bottles being sold out before the case hits the store I get a stroke of luck and land one of these bad boys at Philly steaks,wings ,and beer.  Poured into my cigar city snifter.Pours an opague black with a very weak light coffee colored heading that disappears to nothing and stays flat the entire session. Looks like oil leave rings lacing after every sip.  When the cap was popped, a rush of coffee. After the pour nice aromas of mocha, some bourbon there not too overwhelming just lingering in the background. Dank,funky oak goes right along with it.  Something about the taste seems off. Not as hot and heavy as I remembered on tap. This seems very tame with that hot boozey bourbon element, that funky oak taste is there but the bourbon is very tame. Heavy coffee notes and cocoa powder lingering in the finish.  Full bodied, average carbonation but excellent balance.  Very drinkable maybe not sessionable but I could definetley have another one. In the end is it worth it? I would say so very happy to have tried both on tap a few years ago and now bottled. I do prefer this one on tap.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,BMMillsy,4.3,"2012 Bottle tried pretty much as fresh as can be after purchasing it at a store. Pours motor oil like with no head. Smells of heavy chocolate, vanilla, licorice, wood, bourbon and boozy. Taste is like chocolate sauce and light bourbon booze. Very good, but a bit hot. The palate on this one is thinner than I would have expected, and this is usually the impression I get from the BA coffee stouts. Not sure if it's due tot he acidity, but something about the coffee-barrel combination makes things seems thing to me. Lingering bourbon vanilla on the palate and warmth in the throat. Actually like the standard breakfast stout better. Gotta find some again.  Tried a 2011 bottle on Dec 20, 2012. Same impression as before, like the regular FBS better, but this one is a nice warming yumminess. Only complaint is there’s no more coffee flavor. Just sort of bourbony, and slightly metallic but nothing serious.  2013 bottle pretty fresh on 5/3/13. This one seems thicker than before with a little more vanilla. Bourbon is still a little harsh and there are others of the style I prefer. Still a neat beer though.  Alright. Now hitting up the 2014 version at the Tipples Rare and Barrel Aged Beer Tasting on July 13, 2014. Current year's version. This is coming off much better than any other KBS I have had. Lots of coffee on the aroma, chocolate, and even vanilla. The flavor is much more bold on the coffee, vanilla, and chocolate than previous vintages I have had, and the bourbon is not as harsh. Creamier mouthfeel, and plenty of body to this one. Really nice and the rating here is now for this vintage.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,musicforairports,4.22,"2011 bottle. Reviewed 17 March 2012. Poured into a small snifter.  Looks like motor oil. Very little carbonation and a minimal head. It leaves some lacing, though.  Smell is a very smooth blend that's two parts bourbon and one part each of vanilla, coffee and chocolate.  Flavor is much like the nose. Very smooth. Bourbon coats the mouth and helps carry the flavor, but there's chocolate and vanilla notes in the middle, and maybe a bit of oak. Finish is heavy on the bourbon. Overall, though, you might think the ABV is less. The bourbon character grows as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel is much lighter than I was expecting for the size of this beer. This makes it easier to drink quickly, for better or for worse.  This is my first time having this beer. I'm not sure if it lives up to the hype, overall, it's is a great bourbon-barrel stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,rodkin,4.34,"A: Pitch black in the glass, with some dark reddish brown at the very top if you hold it to the light. Very thin head at pour, reduces to a light film lacing.  S: Excellent. First thing I got was the bourbon, but as it warms I'm getting vanilla, chocolate, and coffee. Coffee and chocolate are less pronounced than in the regular breakfast stout, but not in a bad way.  T: Very similar to the smell, but more balanced. Has a little bit of bourbon warmth in the finish, but the alcohol is extremely well hidden. A little bit of dark fruit and some sweetness at the side of my mouth. Near the front it's mostly coffee and chocolate, with more sweetness in the middle of the mouth and a lightly bitter finish. The bourbon is pretty noticeable. Glad it's a 12oz bottle, I can definitely feel it pretty quickly.  M: Pretty thick and chewy with excellent carbonation. Leaves a little tingling in the back of my throat when it goes down.  O: This is a really fantastic stout. Very balanced and smooth, really great thickness and carbonation... drinkability suffers a bit from the barrel character, but this is still a great beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Managed to get my hands on some, despite avoiding the price gauging of other unnamed establishments. I believe it to the best best stout I have ever had. Mountains of complexity, bourbon, oak, coffee, vanilla, awesomely smooth and delicious, but not overwhelming on the palate in terms of mouth feel . easy to drink, could have it everyday. it has so much going on but not that intense, giving it a nice smooth taste with so much to savor.

1199,19960,jtingue,4.92,"2012 Batch. Poured into a tulip.  Appearance. Cherry dark brown through the pour. Pitch Black in the glass. Some small patches of lacing stick to the side of the glass.  Smell. Surprising amount of coffee on the nose. A lot roastier and more chocolatey than regular breakfast stout. The bourbon adds some wonderful, light vanilla and some charred oak.  Taste. Starts out very chocolatey, with a hint of vanilla. Some slight bitterness punctuates a switch to toffee and bourbon and then fades into the background. Overtones of grain alcohol start and are present throughout. Coffee bitterness and flavor take over with surprising power for a beer which has been aged for ""over a year"". Some vanilla and toffee come back, with a buttery bourbon flavor in the background. The finish is sweet at first, and then quickly becomes dry with coffee bitterness and some alcohol burn.  Mouthfeel. Starts out thick and creamy, but the carbonation gives way to a prickly mouthfeel.  For me this one lives up to the hype and more. I see the similarities between this and original Breakfast stout, but this one just takes it to the next level. The bourbon is so subtle in its application, and only accompanies the other flavors already present. For me a perfect beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I also pick up some good bitterness, and a bit of boozy warmth. No complaints, as close to perfect as possible.  M-Thick and viscous, almost chewy.  O-As good a beer as I've had.

Taste - Very similar to the nose, but wow so integrated. I mean, its so balanced. Def the most balanced stout I've ever had. So good. It would be hard to top this in any genre or beer.

Lord save me, for I may never see another day so great.  After all this time: my first KBS. I opened one tonight.  It pours an unnatural black. No beverage can be this dark, this transcendently deep, dank and bottomless. How can this be?  This beer smells better than anything else I've ever smelled. I smell it, and I think Mozart. Spine tingling. The definition of balance. Coffee, chocolate, bourbon. Not one note out of place, not one phrase misplaced. Harmony.  The taste dances. Each sip a symphony of fireworks in your mouth.

Defeat never tasted so good...  12oz bottle. Bottled 2/25/11. Served in a snifter.   Pours jet black with a quarter finger mocha head that dissappears quickly. Any lacing seems accidental. Looks good.   Big smells of bourbon, wood and chocolate. Also coffee, vanilla, smoke and booze. Overall quite pleasant.   Taste is very nice. That bourbon is still right up front but without the burn it had a year ago. Coffee and chocolate are also major players here. Oak, vanilla, brown sugar, booze, and some dark fruit. The flavors blend wonderfully with bourbon, chocolate and coffee consistently on top. Long dry finish. I can tell there is plenty of alcohol but it hides the 11% quite well.   Thick creamy feel with very little carbonation. Good thick coating on the tongue. Very well done.   A much better beer than it was 12, 9 & 6 months ago! I remember it as coming across too hot and hiding many of the flavors. But this really is an outstanding stout. If you see it on tap, drink it now.

I can't honestly think of another beer to equate this with.

Fair warning: this review is basically a jack-off session to kbs.  a- first off, my first surprise came from simply pouring this into the glass. it's a very heavy beer, completely black and no light getting through even as I pour it. settles into snifter with about half an inch of head that diminishes to a thick ring around the glass. it's glossy up top with a layer of beige lace, with a few tiny bubbles around, and lacing that slides around the glass like butter. this is one hell of a beer.  s- intense ground up coffee, vanilla, powdery, brown sugar, and bitter chocolate. a good deal of bourbon coming through. i can almost taste the beer by smelling it and it makes my mouth water.  t- unbelievable. all of that coffee comes through with a nice roastedness, the most chocolate i've ever picked up in a beer, both dark chocolate and milk chocolate (and i can actually separate the two), and a slight sweetness. super complex beer, i can pick up the flavors clearly. the bourbon is delicious, and it doesn't overpower the beer. it contributes an almost undetectable alcohol-ness that is noticeable only because of the slight heat, and that heat continues long after you've paused. there's also a nice vanilla coming through. perfect.  m- by far the thickest and creamiest beer i've ever had. it's so rich. it's wonderful, what i've always dreamed of in a beer.the carbonation is on the low side, but it's perfect for it. not boozy, but there's definitely some heat. it's definitely a sipper.  o- impeccable. i have no other words.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,andrewjraab,4.2,"Reviewed on 3/10 at the taproom release party. I first must say that the hype surrounding this beer is simply amazing. A few weeks back at the West Michigan Beer Festival ($44 entry fee) I waited over an hour in line for the founders tent to get a 3oz sample. After I had my sample, some guy came running out of the tent....""Nooo, the KBS is out!"" I thought it was good enough to give it a go for the Tap room release party in which I just attended. More notes along the lines of the hype machine for this beer... People were camping out last night at Founders to get there hands on a case. People follow the distributors trucks around just to buy the beer and sell it on ebay or craigslist. I found a fellow beer lover selling a 4 pack of the 2011 for 34 bucks ( a bargain) so I'm jumping on it. ( I will review that later)....okay on with the review.  A - Black as night and thick. No sunlight getting through this blanket of black velvet. No head to show for and not much lacing. Each blanket of lacing disappeared with each new drink. As a swirled my glass around, the beer left nice ""plinko board"" bubbles sticking to the glass for a brief moment.  S - First thing that pops out is the bourbon followed by sweet notes of maple syrup, chocolate, and coffee. I'm not a big bourbon follower, but this still does a number on the senses.  T - Strong bourbon flavor up front followed by a smooth blend of the sweet characteristics and a bitter bourbon finish. It is absolutely amazing the different jigs this beer dances on the tongue.  O - This is one hell of a great beer....but I have a hard time with the fact that it is so hyped up. I actually prefer the breakfast stout to this any day of the week. I wonder if it wasn't so limited in supply if it would be so hyped up? Do you get the people that see that it is so highly rated and feel that they have to judge it that way just because they are supposed to? Don't get me wrong, I think it is incredibly smooth and would keep this in my regular rotation (if supply permitted), but I just don't see the hype surrounding it.

M: Excellent feeling of thickness and medium carbonation makes this beautiful, especially with the slight bitterness.

S: Rum-raisin cake with caramel-prune puree.  T: Up-front, there is chocolate and oak with hints of caramel espresso. The middle is very wine like: an inky Malbec or a Saperavi with moderate oak tannins, overlaid with just a kiss of vanilla. The finish is very woody: chocolate, oak and a bitterness that is part hops and part oaky tannins. The aftertaste is incredibly long, easily persisting longer than five minutes. Interestingly, the bourbon (whisky, really, as there is little corn sweetness) aspect comes past the aftertaste when you burp. (Sorry if that offends any purists, but it's true.)  M: Smooth and warming, yet oddly watery given the ABV. The mouthfeel is Burgundy to the taste's Bordeaux.  O: An incredible beer, but then again, with real cream and full fat, what's not to like. I am pleased with the barrel ageing aspects of the beer, and I'd like to explore more along these lines. I love Palo Santo Marron, and this easily ranks in the same class.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S - Tons of coffee with some chocolate and bourbon on the back end. One of the best smelling stouts out there, no doubt about it.  T - Great coffee flavor, even though it is a year old. Tons of smooth bourbon vanilla character. No alcohol burn after it being this far out. So fantastic.  &lt; - Super smooth and velvety. Fresh, it does have an alcohol burn. But with time, this really mellows out.  O - Easily one of my favorite beers out there. I could drink this all the time. Definitely worthy of its huge score.

On Ice for about 30 minutes.  S- very nice. Chocolate was there and bourbon. Can't wait to dive in.  T- wow! Very smooth chocolate coffee and bourbon. Perfect mix of flavors. I could taste a bit of vanilla on the backside. The best imp stout I have had.  M- thick and creamy. Best mouth feel out of a beer I have had.  O- this meet my expectation and more. Glad I have more of this beauty I can wait to see how this beer taste warmer and maybe cellared for a year.  2012 batch is awesome!! This was bottled 2/17/12. This will be a hard beer to beat!

1199,19960,boilermakerbrew,5,"Decided it was time to crack open a KBS finally after securing my summer internship. Bottled on 2-25-11.  A- Pours and appears exactly like it's brothers FIS and FBS. Less head than the other two with only a slight hint of chocolate colored bubbles on the top that barely hang around 30 seconds. Black as night and good lacing.  S- Complex and delicious as all get out. Prominent chocolate and sweet scents intermingled with vanilla and bourbon tones. Hints of coffee flavors are also present.  T- Tons of dark malts and roasts up front. Chocolate and coffee intermingle for usual breakfast stout flavor. Bourbon and hints of vanilla kick in next. They compliment the previous flavors well. A slight booziness is in there too. Aftertaste is of mainly dark roasts.  M- Creamy, thick, and heavy. The feel for this one is exactly what one would expect for the flavor profile of this brew. Little carbonation adds to the weighty feel.  Overall, this a terribly good beer. Honestly, I was a little let down after hearing so much about this beer.

1199,19960,shangwang,4.97,"Had KBS once before on draft in 2011, but this is my first time reviewing it. Drank with a couple of buddies side by side with GI BCS. This was the 2011 version, poured into a Chimay glass.  There was very little head after the pour, which became thin swirls on the surface in seconds, and left a brownish residue on the side of the glass. It was viscous and jet black. There was lots of wonderful coffee smell, with hints of vanilla and boozy bourbon. Probably the best beer I've ever smelled. Also caught some roasted chocolate malt. The taste was awesome - a chocolatey stout taste with bourbon sweetness, and a bitter hoppy/roasty finish. Every sip was better than the last. The mouthfeel with fairly light in weight, but there was a good amount of carbonation that left a tingle on the tongue.  This beer was so well balanced, and while there wasn't anything specifically complex about the taste, it was unbelievably satisfying. This is as good as it gets for an imperial stout IMO. As a side note, while I enjoyed the BCS along side it, KBS blew it away. It's pricey and hard to find, but well worth every penny.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,coreyfmcdonald,4.27,"12oz bottle into a snifter  A: Pours pitch black, no chance of any light shining through this one at all. A half finger of light brown head quickly recedes to a film.  S: Not sure where to start as there are so many equally strong aromas. Milk and dark chocolate are probably strongest, but toffee and caramel aren't too far behind. Just behind that is sweet bourbon, coffee, and roasted malts. The aromas work very well together - its surprising how many strong aromas are in this beer.  T: Dark chocolate is the dominant flavor in this beer. Coffee, milk chocolate, and sweet bourbon are also quite strong. Booze is very evident. As delicious as this beer is, I find myself wanting a bit more complexity in it. I'd give it a 4.25 if I could.  M: Thick with low but ample carbonation.  O: This is a delicious beer. The chocolate, roast, and coffee flavors work very well together, and the bourbon adds to the complexity. This is one of my favorite RISs, but I don't think this is in the same class as BCBCS.  Edit (5/4/12): I had a relatively fresh one to compare as my last review was a year+ old KBS. The coffee is obviously much stronger in the fresh one, though a bit raw and bitter. Not quite enough sweetness to balance the strong coffee flavors, I prefer this one with some age on it. I normally like my coffee forward imperial stouts fresh, too.

Smells blasts you with vanilla, coffee, and bourbon. Roasted, rich caramel and chocolate linger in the background.  Incredibly sweet start to the taste with chocolate and caramel malt. Barrel characteristics are present, but nowhere near overpowering. Vanilla is strong. Burnt, bitter espresso lingers on the tongue at the end, leaving a nice departure from the beginning taste.  The body on this was surprisingly low, and carbonation was a bit tingly, but low also.  Overall, I enjoyed this beer, but really expected a creamier mouthfeel and a thicker stout than what it was.

A: Comes out black with with amazingly full, thick head that comes down to a solid finger of well built, beautiful head on top. Tiny beads of lace linger as the drink disappears from the glass.  S: pronounced aroma of chocolate and coffee. Some kind of amazing spiciness is present that isn't like any other beer I've ever had. Fusel burn is picked up when deep breaths are taken.  T: Sweet chocolate comes on strong that eventually settles down to a mellow coffee. Again, that spiciness comes through in the back palate. Not at all bitter and very pleasing.  M: Quite the mouth full of beer, I tell ya! It's thick and filling. It took me a good half an hour to enjoy the whole glass. No dryness, it's wet and delicious. Hardly any carbonation is felt which is surprising after seeing so much head on this beer.

A: Jet black and even with a hard pour the thinnest of tan heads appears and then disappears. Eventually a small bubble of foam appears in the middle due to the last etched bottom. S: Very nice. Bourbon, booze, liquorice, vanilla, oak, chocolate syrup (like Quik), light roasted notes and maybe some coffee, although that may have been the roasted malts... T: I know this is supposedly a world class beer. It is a nice beer, but man this beer is a pain in the mouth. Very hot, with lots of booze playing through. Not sure if this is the bourbon barrels or the base beer, but it is overall distracting and off putting. Otherwise the beer is fine. Notes of vanilla are most prevalent. Hints of molasses, mild coffee notes along with hot chocolate play through. Overall though there is one thing only that is beating down everything else: Hot, Boozy & Bourbon... M: Hot. Not sweet at all, well balanced with the bitterness. O: Incredible disappointment here... Not to say it was bad, but I was led to believe this was something mind blowing, rather it is a pedestrian BA beer, which sadly let the bourbon take over (maybe it was just this year's blend, who knows...

A: Black as night with a half-finger of tan head that recedes quickly. Fantastic lacing. Completely opaque, even around the edges. Whoa. I never realized how dark this is.  S: A perfect blend of chocolate, vanilla, oak, and bourbon. Very sweet and decadent smelling, like chocolate cake.  T: Dark chocolate, with hints of oak, bourbon, coffee, and vanilla mixed in. The bourbon flavor is incredibly mild and takes a backseat to the chocolate and the coffee. This is like drinking a chocolate cake. I would probably even call it liquid sex.  M: Thick, sweet, and lightly carbonated. The flavor coats the tongue and lingers for quite a while. The bitterness from the coffee really balances out the lingering chocolate quite nicely.  O: Quite simply, if not my favorite beer, this is one of my favorite beers of all time. Every time I drink it, I am blown away.

Great body on the brew as well as a welcoming hearty look. The dark color amplifies the lacing on the sides of the glass  S- absolute bourbon presence lies over some chocolate and vanilla flavors. Faint coffee and even a well hidden whiff of alcohol complete the initial outlay for the scent profile. The bourbon is so rough and captive that it truly makes this a stout I have never experienced. Completely enticing and mouth watering simultaneously  T- perfect collaboration of the roasted malt and it's flavors with the bourbon. While the taste is so complex within the bourbon aging aspects, KBS is smooth and flavorful on the palate. Never before have I experiences a beer that is literally perfectly crafted with all these attributes. Even at 11 percent, the alcohol only adds to the experience  M- a new bar has been set for mouthfeel. KBS is so smooth and creamy as it drapes your mouth with roasted bourbon flavors.

I was rooting around cleaning out old food containers when I hooked the btl cap of my last KBS. It fell out hit the floor and began to bleed coffee chocolate stout goodness. I actually didn't loose too much but I wasn't prepared to drink this particular bottle of beer as you can imagine. There's no special celebrations going on other than the fact that I just got my 4 month old son to fall asleep for the night. So anyway, here I am drinking what I believe to be one of the greatest beers ever conceived/created/brewed/served/sold.

I drank the 3rd one when my son was born and now I drink the last on on a fluke. BUT GOD DAMN THIS IS GOOD ALE! I'm not going to break it down for you, describing all the intricate flavors and complex tastes...no I'm just going to tell you to go out and find some, try it, love it.

Brown sugar and dark chocolate dominate, but I'm surprised by the lack of coffee. I suppose it's because it's almost 2 years old at this point.  Taste: The nose knows. Caramel, vanilla, bourbon, and dark chocolate. There's still some alcohol left over in this, and not in a pleasant way; it's far too sharp. Though the sharpness dissipates some as the beer warms. However, the alcohol presence overwhelms the aforementioned flavors as I don't find them particularly strong in any aspect.  Mouthfeel: This is where the beer loses me. KBS is heavily carbonated and comes off surprisingly thin. More importantly, it feels like it's keeping the flavors off my tongue. I figured with the lack of lacing and bubbles, this might have sat down a bit further in the glass.  Overall: Good, but not great. This is the second bottle I've had and I haven't been impressed either time. (I wanted to give this a second chance since I first had it when my palate was a bit less far along.)

Gobs of vanilla, with some lighter roasted coffee and cocoa. Smells alcoholic, but that could be the brain's response to the heavy bourbon.  T: First reaction is the lack of coffee, which seems to have faded a bit from fresh (as to be expected). There is still some roasty malts but they are mostly chocolate. Plenty of bourbon flavor overlaying the imperial stout underneath reminds me this beer has obviously changed significantly from whatever the base is.

There is a milk chocolate as well as dark chocolate. Molasses comes into play along with some prunes. Clean esters that make it feel like an American Double but this doesn't get too overpowering with alcohol. The bourbon is muted.

It's heavy and black - like a tiny glass of opaque concrete. Very little head upon the pour, with just a bit percolating up, slowly building in a cinnamon brown color and the drawing back. Visible now only like silt on water - all nearly washed away.  Heavy bourbon at the outset, along with big cocoa and coffee - just from the nose, you know it's sturdy.  Velvety in a way like no other beer I've ever had. So huge, yet still mellow with dark chocolate - tingles on the tongue with some tartness. The bourbon is robust as well - doesn't burn at all though. This is one that you can take a small sip and enjoy it for a few minutes afterwards.  Relatively low carbonation - allows the bourbon and other tastes to lead.  Great winter sipper.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,brewmudgeon,4,"KBS (previous review apparently lost), bottled 2/25/11  a 3-4 dark, ok? very little head, no lace.  s 4 whisps of vanilla, light wood, charring, coffee grounds, butterscotch. some alcohol is noted zipping by.  t 3.5-4 follows the smell but sweeter, barrel flavors, a little root beer. a little flabby. not sure how others use the term but when something has a body with less flavor than it would take really fill that body, when there is a sort of viscous emptyness along the perimeters, i think of it as flabby.  m 3.5-4 enough heft in the body that it goes a little past the flavor, resulting in the above described flabbyness. carbonation is just about right, much more noticeable than in the nearly flat FIS, of fine quality and never intrusive.  o 3.5-4 i do like KBS, and it is certainly easy drinking. but it's kind of too easy drinking in a sweet, friendly, nonchallenging way. its several flavor elements play well together, and i would not want more roast--it's really just the right amount of roast. the butterscotch lacks an edge, though, and the vanilla is more of a ghost. between this and bcbs, i strongly prefer the bcbs, at least the 2011 iteration, although that is admittably a much stronger concoction. but where bcbs explodes with flavor and aroma with every sip, the KBS just sort of demurely slides down, leaving a touch of char and sucrose sweetness, but never fully grabbing me, embracing me, making me say ""wow."" guess i have become a full-fledged 'merican?  good, several-faceted, but a teensy bit boring.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,will1256,4.84,"2011 vintage, cellared since picking it up last winter. Poured into a snifter.  A: Thin light to medium brown head that quickly dissipates. Black in color.  S: Hits you immediately with a fantastic mixture of molasses, burnt sugar, cocoa, coffee, and bourbon. The bourbon/alcohol scent really picks up as it warms.  T: Lots of bourbon and coffee. The boozy tingle/warmth and burnt sugar flavors stick with you in the aftertaste.  M: Medium-low carbonation. Although the body is on the heavier side of medium, it seems a bit thin for the style, or at least thinner than I would like. I always thought the Breakfast Stout was a bit thin too, so no surprise here. Not gonna let that stop me from enjoying what is otherwise an awesome beer, though.

1199,19960,AndyAvalanche,4.65,"12 oz. bottle (that states ""Highly Acclaimed"") poured into a Duvel Tulip Style Glass. Beer comes out thick like motor oil and completely black, consuming all light. Small slightly darker than tan head, maybe about a finger width thick. Goes away fairly quickly leaving a ring and a skimming, the ring has big bubbles. Liquid coats to the glass like a thin maple syrup, really good looking beer.  Smell is really good, actually, really really good. Coffee and bourbon very easily detectable. Also some presence of bittersweet dark chocolate. There's a pleasant unique sweetness to it, sort of between maple and vanilla, probably the oak, it does smell slightly woody.  Taste is equally excellent, maybe even a little better. A sweet and decadent mix of chocolate fudge and coffee flavors provided here, quite tasty. Also a generous bourbon flavor without it being too hot, quite pleasant; it has all the positive flavors of bourbon without tasting like alcohol, it's very well hidden. The sweetness is more of a vanilla flavor here than detected in the smell, it's really nice.  Easiest way to describe the mouthfeel and drinkability is perfect. Pretty full bodied, bourbon lightens it a little if that makes sense, but still pretty full. Bourbon is warming to the throat and stomach but not the palate or tongue, very nice. Silky smooth, sort of a heavy silk. Strong and a nice malty sweetness, really digging this one. DANGEROUSLY drinkable, getting close to finished here and want to finish the review. The alcohol is VERY well hidden.  I think there could be some minor improvements, but believe me when I say that Founders Brewing Company knows what they're doing, especially when it comes to Stouts!

Smell is bourbon and oak, absolutely lovely. Taste is bourbon forward, followed by absolute wood....so much oak. Vanilla and roasted malts follow, not as much coffee as I would want. Maybe a fresher bottle would show coffee flavors? Either way, the taste lingers on my tongue forever!!! I remember this beer being thicker but the mouthfeel is nice. A tad thinner than FBS, I'm sure sitting in a barrel will do that. Overall, I love this beer. Always have, always will. Going by memory, I will try and drink these as fresh as possible going forward....age really does nothing for this beer.

1199,19960,claspada,4.11,"Bottle courtesy of mcgwire756. 2011 release which I believe is sometime in the Spring.  Pours a viscous-looking black body with a small, short-lived dark tan head that leaves some minimal spotty lacing. Agitation is unsuccessful to force any significant head.  Aromas of strong baker's chocolate, both dark and milk versions. As it warms you get some coffee and slight vanilla and nutty notes from the bourbon, but not a drop of alcohol or ""hotness"" what-so-ever.  The taste follows the nose with luxurious dark and milk chocolate flavors; some vanilla notes as it warms. The coffee flavors are quite prevalent throughout and really overwhelm the chocolate flavors that I enjoyed on the nose. Bourbon barrel flavors emerge more and more as it warms, vanilla, slight sour mash bourbon alcohol flavor. Definitely opens up as it warms.  Mouthfeel is crazy high/strong, however you are supposed to describe this category. Coffee bitterness lingers for days and coats the palate, bourbon flavors linger and add to the intense flavor profile.  Overall, what can I say, this is a great beer. The flavor profile is obviously great and second to few. The problem is how hard it is to get this beer now-a-days. Beer geeks are stalking this like it is the best beer on the planet, which I do not think it is, so unfortunately I will only be able to sample this via trade or trade extras going forward. I sample CBS a few nights ago for the first time and I can say I enjoyed it more because the sweetness helped to balance the coffee bitterness that I found to be slightly (slightly) too much for my tastes here. Is this great, yes, recommended, yes, a necessity to check off your list as a beer geek, yes, is it my favorite, not by a long shot, but to each his own.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Aftertaste is malty, slightly bittered chocolate, coffee, booze.  M: Full body. Viscous. Ingredients and carbonation combine to create an extremely creamy and smooth feel. Alcohol clears the palate/feel on the aftertaste a bit. Finished semi dry.  O: One of the best, if not the best, beers I have ever had. The combination of the ingredients is flawless.

1199,19960,JTSbeerislife,4.94,"12 oz bottle purchased 7/2011 from a very reliable and knowledgeable restaurant that has craft brews on draft and bottled for take out. No date code on bottle, but I believe it to be 2010’s production. Well stored at 55 degrees or less.  Poured into a Dogfish Head Snifter.  Pours a rather thin head which quickly reduces to thin film, easily activated with a swirl of the glass, a live ale. Jet Black, totally opaque color, with a tan colored head.  The smell first hits you with an aroma of exceptionally rich roasted malt, and then follows with chocolate, hints of caramel, yeast, some balanced oak, and the faintest hint of anise. As the ale warms the very rich chocolate malt and vanilla oak take over and dominate. Complex. World Class.  Crisp, creamy, unbelievable rich entry on the palate of roasted malt, dark unsweetened chocolate, and caramel, vanilla oak. Massive mouth feel, unctuous, a dream come true. The rich malt and chocolate flavors, plus the vanilla oak, take turns at being the dominate flavor, with caramel and a slight bitterness kicking in now and then. Quite complex. Exceptionally delicious! World Class!  Very long finish of rich caramel and chocolate malt. Coats the mouth and lasts forever. Very, very enjoyable.  Well what to say. This ale has legendary status. That being said I did my best to be objective in my review. Not that it accomplished much because this is truly one of the top five stouts I have drunk. The richness of this ale leaves one searching for words to truly describe it. There is an indescribable (for me) complexity to it. The wood ageing is near perfection, never overpowering the other wonderful qualities of this ale.

So thanks for that. And yes every one, I have a beautiful family in which good beer is highly appreciated.  A - This is a pitch black motor oil. Was there a head? I forgot to look carefully I guess.  S - Chocolate bourbon, my favorite.  T - A sweet chocolate, caramel liquid, mixed with bourbon and oak. All very subtle though, I expected a more strong and aggressive beer.

1199,19960,bcostner1,4.53,"I am reviewing a bottle that I am drinking at 1 yr of age and comparing it to one that I had fresh last year from notes:  A: Both the same: pitch black, thick, viscous; rich tan head that dissipates over minutes into tan lacing around the edges. So black...so impossibly black!!  S: Fresh: subtle coffee, lots of bourbon, some vanilla, wood 1yr: no coffee, bourbon more tame, vanilla still present, wood more subtle; chocolate notes evident.  T: Fresh: moderate vanilla, some chocolate, very subtle coffee, moderate bourbon; no hops; sweet, smooth. Honestly, still pretty boozy and hot; almost too much to me.  1yr: very little coffee if any at all, chocolate more pronounced, definitely not as hot, much smoother and easier drinking; vanilla still prominent and at the forefront. Delicious!  M: Pretty much the same for both; viscous, thick, rich; coats the mouth and sticks around for a while. Definitely a sipper. 1 per sitting for me for sure. ABV is pretty well hidden but the bourbon sure comes through; more so fresh than aged.  Overall, like everyone else, I absolutely love KBS. When fresh, I love it for the coffee elements that blend with everything but it's almost a little hot for me out of the gate. At 1 year, though, I think I prefer it more overall because it is not as hot and the bourbon/vanilla notes are significantly smoother and have melded well into the beer.

Appearance: Pours a murky brown body (looks black in the glass) that is literally impenetrable when held to the light. Barely a thin ring of foam before disappearing. Swishing does show sheets if lacing.  Smell: Wow, this is strong with overpowering. Mix of chocolate, oatmeal and coffee with some bourbon thrown in as an afterthought.  Taste: Good oatmeal base, raw, some chocolate but the bourbon is more present. Traces of vanilla are felt and the coffee comes strong as it warms. Taste could have lingered a bit more but that's the only knock.  Mouthfeel: Amazing how a strong beer like this can be as smooth as it is. Very low carbonation, as it should be, with a body of silk. Suffers mildly as it warms.  Overall: After a few average bourbon-aged stouts, this one has restored my faith in this type of aging.

Coffee is still very prevalent yet probably faded a touch but still there enough to mix with the bourbon and the chocolate to create an extremely complex blend of flavors that - if I hadn't had CBS recently - I would have been blown away by.

The chocolate and coffee I taste at the front with a slight bourbon hotness/kick on the finish. With all that is going on the hops are still present and add a nice litter bitterness to what would otherwise be a very sweet beer. It's as full bodied as they come.

1199,19960,marchoftheclouds,4.65,"After enjoying a regular Founder's Breakfast Stout (that I haven't reviewed yet) that I picked up last night (for $9.99 a 4-pack) while meeting birchstick for an in person trade at our local Friar Tucks (for KBS) I tried this top 10 beer in a Duvel tulip.  Appearance - It passes my ""It's so dark I can't see through it.""  test. It has slightly more carbonation than I expected ... more than Dark Lord, but not enough to be annoying. I prefer less carbonated beers. It had almost no head, even though I frantically dumped the beer in my tulip. It was ruby red at the edges and it screamed DRINK ME SLOWLY!  Smell - This smelled like a vanilla bomb that needed immediate attention. It took me over an hour to drink the 11.2% ABV 12 ounces. It tasted great cold (too cold really) from the fridge, but as it warmed up, the smell only made me want to guzzle it more. But I was patient.  Taste - I tasted mostly vanilla, which surprised me since I prefer coffee beers. Or do I?! This is an incredible beer ... balancing vanilla, chocolate and coffee. Does it sound like a dessert you may have had? Well, it tastes most like dessert than beer to me. As much as I'd like to guzzle this beer, like I do anything that tastes incredible, as I said before, I made it last a long, long time (during the first half of an NFL game). I do NOT like hoppy beers as as a rule, and I noted that this was 70 IBUs ... very well hidden and balanced with the 11.2% ABV and strong flavors.  Mouthfeel - This had a bit of carbonation and a very chewy feel to it. It was almost perfect. I may have had one or two beers better, Dark Lord ... and a one-off from Two Brothers called Red Eye (I think it was imperial stout pressed through coffee).  Overall - If this was $12.99 a six-pack AB would be a brewery of the past! On the other hand, I understand this beer is approximately $25 a 4-pack. As good as it is ... I got to thinking ... how much better is it than regular Founder's Breakfast Stout? I picked up a 4-pack of Founder's Breakfast Stout for only $9.99 last night and tried one right before this. Was KBS worth $15 more a 4-pack? I don't think so. If you can score some KBS, then by all means check it out. If you can't get it, but can score some $9.99 Breakfast Stout ... you'll still be having a treat.  I think the reason I wasn't as impressed by this beer as I thought I would be is the first time I had it I had been waiting in line for over 2 hours (with 1:45 to go) before getting into the Three Floyd's brewpub during Dark Lord Days 2011. I got a tiny taste of this and thought I'd tasted the holy grail of beers. Of course, I was also very tired and dehydrated after waiting in line so long! An hour and 45 minutes later I DID taste one of the holy grails of beer ... Vanilla Dark Lord on tap ... OH DEAR!  All in all, an incredible brew ... worthy of it's top 10 rating. It's cheaper, lower-ranked brother, Founder's Breakfast Stout ... is also incredible. (Review to come).",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,gbbass16,5,"The beer that started it my complete obsession with craft beer. I have had this numerous times now so this is an overall review, not just a one off. Please see my review of CBS as well, as I was able to do a side by side of both.  This is my pinnacle beer. Pours dark and think like motor oil with a half inch head that disperses quickly. The smell pulls you in with coffee, cocoa, and bourbon. The taste absolutely will blow your taste buds and your mind. Thick viscous mouthfeel. Its crazy to think but this has absolutely no heat whatsoever. Chocolate, coffee, bourbon, typically in that order with a finish that goes on and on and on.  100% guarantee...This will always be in my top 3 beers ever!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,kbuzz,3.91,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my trusty snifter. This is a 2010 vintage - bottle dated 4/18/10  A: As black and thick as they come. A very thin tan head fades quickly. Massive alcohol legs and decent lacing considering the ABV.  S: Mostly bourbon. Some roast, some cocoa and just a wee bit of vanilla. I get a bizarre ""dustiness"" and some oaky tannins in there as well.  T: Again, as in the nose, mostly bourbon up front...but I get more roasty coffee bitterness in the taste than in the aroma. Tons of oak. The alcohol isn't very noticeable at all. Some really thick baker's chocolate coming through at the end. This beer isn't necessarily sweet though. Definitely a good bit of bitterness left on the tongue.  M: Very smooth and creamy. Coats the throat as it goes down. Minimal carbonation. Chewy as hell.  O: I think this was actually a bit dissapointing to my tastes. I don't think I was expecting so much bourbon flavor. To me it's the dominant characteristic of this beer. The roastiness and the mouthfeel are inarguably top notch, but they are in a distance second...and that faint dustiness in the aroma is offputting. I would consider this a hybrid of an imp stout and a scotch ale. I'm not trying to be a hater, cause I LOVE Founders, but this is just slightly better than Backwoods if you ask me.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,mpcrump,4.5,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass  A: Black with minimal carbonation. Thin brown head that disappears quickly.  S: Bourbon with hints of chocolate and coffee. The ABV comes through in the smell as well.  T: Chocolate, coffee, and bourbon. Nice warm medium alchohol aftertaste. Starts a bit bitter and ends with a slight sweet aftertaste.  M: For a stout I don't think it has a syrup type of thickness that matches it's look. Minimal if nonexistant carbonation.  O: Very nice. I was initially taken aback by the lack of carbonation - I thought I might have had a bad bottle. Worked as designed.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Pintofbrown,4.52,"This beer was poured into a glass stein. A big thanks to Geneseohawk!  Appearance- KBS pours like motor oil. It so incredibly viscous and heavy. The body is completely black. The chocolate colored cap builds to a finger and look really smooth. Good retention, but not much lace.  Smell- The nose is full of bourbon and coffee roast. The dark chocolate on the nose adds some nice snap to the smell.  Taste- Wow! The bourbon is not the most dominate profile, but there is certainly heat packed into this one. The chocolate and roasted malt are the most noticeable flavors after the alcohol. There is a little bit of dark chocolate as well that is strong in the finish  It is also surprising that vanilla and some oak coming out too. It rounds out the drink very nicely. I am all for a stiff drink, but I wish the alcohol backed off just a little bit.  Mouth feel- This one is really slick. It goes down very easy. The chewy factor is awesome.  Overall- I would gladly give this one a perfect score if the bourbon was not so strong on the palate. Otherwise, this is one incredible and deep stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Kendo,4.62,"There's a backstory to this. . . . Years ago I procured a bottle - can't remember if it was by hook or by crook, but BA MRMOJORISIN had something to do with it. Anyway, I put it in my DBF expecting to sample it soon. While out one night, my wife had our neighbor Jen over. She likes Rolling Rock. She asked my wife if she could have a beer, my wife sent her down to the DBF in the cellar and grabbed... the KBS. As if that wasn't bad enough, she had a couple sips and then knocked it over on our porch.  I sampled the KBS one night a couple years later, but today it finally arrived in Albany. I missed out at Westmere Beverage, but got two bottles locally. Here goes on the first one. . . .  A: Poured from the bottle into a Piraat tulip/snifter-type glass. Body is black with a small chocolate brown head that settles quickly. Each sip leaves behind a bit of lace that clings to the glass.  S: Bourbon. Molasses. Dark fruit. Leather. And alcohol. The bourbon in the nose jumps out of the glass upon the pour. Sweet molasses follow, with the dark fruits underneath and more subtle.  T: First impression, again, is the bourbon. Dark fruits and molasses lay a sweet foundation underneath. Vanilla is noted after a few sips. Touch (only a touch) of bitter, roasted coffee is noted as well, with modest chocolate on the back end of the sip and fighting the bourbon to linger in the aftertaste. Label claims this is 70 IBUs, but it doesn't seem to be anywhere near that level of bitterness. I do note after a few sips, however, that there is a decent amount of bitterness that cuts the sweetness and battles the bourbon at the finish. . . . Warmth from the high ABV (11.2%) is noted in the belly right away, and a buzz follows quickly.  M: This is not as thick as expected; call it medium in heft, which is a surprise for such a ""big"" stout. There's just a certain ""buoyancy"" to it. Modestly slick, with fairly low carbonation levels - or, perhaps, just fine-bubbled fizziness that is (again) a bit airy in feel.  O: What can be said that hasn't been said about this beer? I believe it's currently ranked #5 on BA. I can appreciate that. It's a wonderful sipper - the bourbon makes you go slow, even if the body - and great taste - makes you want to drink it more quickly.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,plehnus,4.55,"Aroma: Spices, pepper, bitter chocolate followed by vanilla and cinnamon as the beer warmed.  Appearance: Thick black body with a tan-brown head.  Flavor: Roasted caramel, chocolate, and hints of bitterness. The alcohol is well masked.  Mouthfeel: Heavy full-bodied beer with a short creamy and every so slightly dry finish.  Overall: Very subtle for a huge barrel aged stout. Lots of interesting spice and roasted malt notes. Easily drinkable.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,tobelerone,4.52,"Finally trying the much heralded KBS. Pours jet black with almost no visible carbonation. Decent sticky lacing. Totally opaque; appears nearly still. A tiny hint of dark brown head vanishes almost immediately.  Strong aroma of vanilla, coffee, and traces of bourbon underneath. Very appealing.  Wow, delicious, super vanilla coffee combination; bourbon is underneath and subdued. Sweet and roasty at the same time. Complex. The most prominent vanilla flavor I've had in a beer.  Syrupy and thick with just a touch of carbonation. Sticky and lingering in the mouth. Scrumptious!  The hype around this beer is pretty well justified. As it comes to room temperature more complexities emerge, with a warming bourbon kiss on the finish that's quite nice and doesn't overpower the other flavor characteristics of this beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,stabzmcgee,4.25,"Appearance is opaque black with a nice lacing of tan head. Aroma is immediately bourbon followed by vanilla and caramel. Taste is of caramel, bourbon and mocha.

1199,19960,jethrodium,4.09,"12 oz bottle courtesy of myspoonistoobig. Thanks Michael. Pour a black that is cola brown at the edges when held up to the light. A small light tan head disappears pretty quickly and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma chocolate, coffee, some roast, bourbon, and some light char. The coffee is still pretty strong. The initial taste is sweet chocolate, followed by coffee, some light oak, bourbon, and a little bit of char. The finish has a decent bitterness to it and leaves some lingering coffee flavors. Medium body. Relatively low carbonation. This is a very good beer, but there are several barrel aged imperial stouts that I enjoy more.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,sacrelicio,4.94,"This might be the best stout I have ever tasted. The beer pours black, with a short lived mocha head that leaves a little lacing. The smell is vanilla, bourbon, coffee, chocolate and cream. The taste is similar to the nose, but with the wood from the barrels shining through.The mouthfeel is full and rich, with just enough carbonation to give it lift. Overall, a stellar example of a bourbon barrel aged stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Knapp85,4.67,"Managed to score a few bottles of this at Abe's Cold Beer when they got in a very limited supply of them. The sale price wasn't too bad for this beer surprisingly enough.  The beer itself pours out as a really nice black stout. The head does vanish pretty quickly. The aromas of coffee come first than the bourbon and vanilla come trough later. The taste is powerful. It's got to be sipped over a set period of time, don't waste this and drink it fast. Sit back and enjoy it. I also felt that this beer was a little thinner than I expected which was a bit of a bummer. I have one bottle of this left and I'm gonna age it for just a bit before I crack it open. Just want to see if anything changes in it.  Just opened a bottle of this that I bought in June 2010 and split it with a friend. I found this to be even better now after some time has passed. The smell and taste of the beer is much better overall I think. Just a great beer for sure.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ThePorterSorter,4.35,"2010 bottle from tburk - thanks again for the trade!  Appearance: Jet black with a thin dark brown head. There is not much carbonation either. Super rich and chocolaty, which is just my kind of stout!  Smell: Whoa strong cayenne peppers, what a strange sensation (yes I know there isn't any pepper in this beer). The pepper becomes a heavy oak once the beer warms. There are also generous notes of bourbon and a surprisingly subtle coffee/chocolate. The bourbon/booze nose isn't nearly as strong as a bourbon county.  Taste: Super bold flavors, this is definitely a stout that pushes boundaries. The beer is quite bitter and roasty with a slightly sweet aftertaste. I quite honestly can't taste the booze; a year must have done a number on softening the alcohol bite. Quite a superb beer, very rich and filling.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and syrupy thickness. This beer coats the tongue and is definitely not a chugging beer. There is almost no carbonation, it's just smooth and velvety.  Overall: This is a delicious stout, it did not disappoint. I can understand why people look hard for this beer and I'm happy to share it!

S: Whiskey is the main smell I'm getting off of this which hides some coffee, vanilla and chocolate flavors. My mouth is really salivating  T: Wow, lots of bourbon on the taste. In fact that's the dominating flavor for me, bourbon heat. Hidden behind the bourbon is some good coffee and vanilla notes with a great chocolate aftertaste.  M: strong. That's the best word to describe it. Thick as it should be and a little creamy  O: I'm not happy with the amount of booze heat there is in this stout.

1199,19960,patm1986,5,"Notes: April 2011  12 oz bottle. Got a good deal. Didn't have to hunt. I won't. I swear I won't. (just wait til next year).  Just watching this beer pour into a glass is nirvana. Some divine release. Mahogany. Darkness. With a dark brown head like root beer. Beautiful.  Smells like heaven. I am not a coffee drinker, but with the amount coffee in this, I'd partake if it'd smell like this. Vanilla beans, mildly dark chocolate, roasted pecans, well-aged bourbon, a little bit of butterscotch or toffee.  Tastes of a dark roast, dark chocolate, bourbon vanilla, nuts like roasted pecan or almond, and good, small batch bourbon. Really sweet, slightly boozy finish, but refined so subtly it's candy-like.  Now this is my third year on this beer. I swear it'll change. I swear I'll change. I thought taking notes on it this year for review would change my opinion some, scrutinize something. It seems as though something will happen, and I'll be jaded. It doesn't. It hasn't. I really tried to not rate it with 5s across the board, but what can you do? I really couldn't help it.

1199,19960,beagle75,3.4,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into an half-pint snifter. 2011 vintage  A: Opaque black, showing dark brown light at the edges, with a few scattered bubbles of beige foam. Light lacing remains on the glass.  S: Old wood and hot boozy bourbon stand out with remarkable clarity. There is little in the way of roasted qualities, other than the charred oak of the barrel. As it warms more coffee shows, followed by briny shoyu.  T: Begins dry, with a thin thread of roasted malt preceding rampant spirituous bourbon. Acidity is moderate to high, making the dark flavors struggle needlessly. Chocolate becomes detectable when acidity recedes into the middle, finally adding a layer of flavor that is able to complement the untamed bourbon presence. The finish demonstrates a bitter edge, while other previous flavors are able to marry more closely in the presence of mellowing vanilla.  M: Medium viscosity, disjunct on the palate at first due to due to scathing acidity and alcohol heat, with moderate carbonation.  D/O: The barrel treatment is a process that is all about refinement, where value is added to a product. Amongst barrel-aged stouts, KBS is a relative bargain even after emerging from the oak, but its qualities appear amateurish at times, compared to its contemporaries. Flavors find themselves mostly at odds with each other early, but become passably simpatico during the latter two acts. Challenging textures in the mouth do not help, yet there is still something appealing about it--compared to bourbon it is basically the same taste, but easier to tolerate for the non-spirit drinker. I can appreciate why this profile would appeal to so many, and it does qualify for an extreme candidate of the sub-style.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,RoamingGnome,4.5,"Thanks to Dr. K and N. Ketchum for hooking me up with some KBS. I was kind of saving this for a special occasion, but my computer broke on Monday, and my television broke today, so now I'm just getting my drink on.  Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into a chalice. When my wife gets up tomorrow, I'm asking where my other chalice went, because I'll bet someone broke it.  A) It pours out a jet black and it looks pretty heavy. There was about a half finger of tan head. The head dissipates rather quickly into a nice ring around the glass. There were bits of sticky lacing.  S) The initial aroma was of bitter dark chocolate and hints of coffee. As this warms, there is a transformation in aroma to the sweetness of the malt and the presence of the bourbon.  T) Off the bat, I was tasting a smokey/burnt coffee flavor. This meshed together well with the malt and bits of chocolate and vanilla. Then the bourbon takes over, leading to a boozy coffee finish. This beer really has many twists and turns.  M) Pretty full bodied brew, with not much carbonation. The texture is really quite smooth, but there is also a sticky quality. The aftertaste lingers about for maximum savoring of this stout.  O) I have not consumed many barrel aged brews, but I found his to be quite enjoyable. I can understand now, why this is such a sought after beer. I've had folks tell me the alcohol is hardly detectable in KBS, however I would disagree. I found it quite detectable, but not in a negative way. Again, this may be my own inexperience with barrel aged stouts. In the end, this is a pretty complex brew, that is well put together, and a pleasure to drink. After one bottle down the old hatch, I'm feeling pretty good, and pretty relaxed.

1199,19960,Alieniloquium,4.59,"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. My first KBS! I am excited. 2011 vintage.  Appearance - Jet black with a small tan head. It dissipates with some wispy lacing on top. Looks better than FIS for sure.  Smell - Coffee, bourbon, and heavy roasted malts. Dark, burnt chocolate. What's amazing is how well all three components shine through, without any one overshadowing the others.  Taste - Follows the smell. Bourbon first, then some coffee, followed by a very roasty malt character. It's fairly bitter throughout, mostly from the coffee and the roasted malts, which give off even more coffee flavor. Distinguishable is a chocolate flavor, but it's very dark and very burnt. I first thought the malts were a bit harsh, but on a second tasting, I appreciate more than Founders could maintain the intense stout flavor among the bourbon and coffee.  Mouthfeel - Amazingly light, considering the ABV. Low carbonation, but that's to be expected. It finishes quite bitter, which makes the lingering flavors a little bit harsh. A thicker beer might make for some mellowing of these effects.  Overall - I've edited this review upon drinking a second bottle on 3/7/12. It tastes decadent now. Really spectacular blend of flavors. The coffee has faded to my liking and I get a touch of the vanilla from the barrel which was previously masked.  Edited a third time as a result of drinking this multiple times over the course of two days.

1199,19960,mocktm,4.47,"Huge huge shout-out to cpferris for this bottle as part of his classic rock LIF. The regular Breakfast Stout stands as one of my all time favorites, so I am psyched to finally have a couple bottles of this.  Viscous and dark, no light stands a chance in hell of penetration. Brown highlights accents the edges with a thin layered cap of espresso colored head to top it off. This is an '09, so the carbonation has seemed to have faded a bit, but that's a sacrifice I'm more than willing to make for what time has done to the flavor profile.  Explosive aromas on the nose: bourbon whiskey on the forefront plus unmistakable scents of strong coffee, dark chocolate and just an iota of vanilla. I'm also picking up some hints of herbal/leaf elements in the background as well as mild whiffs of booze.  First taste reveals an affluence of malt sweetness, unleashing relentless waves of chocolate, caramel, as well as bourbon obviously. A slight herbal twang is present in the aftertaste, camouflaging the expected high ABV, which is rendered almost undetectable.  Medium bodied, this is actually a little lighter than I anticipated, but it still posses a silky smooth quality that makes it an absolute delight.  Overall, I have to say as much as I enjoyed this, I actually prefer the original Breakfast Stout. The bourbon seems to overbear the subtle nuances that are more apparent in the regular variety that make it my personal favorite stout, but this is still certainly a world class beer.

A little alcoholic, but it feels more like a kiss of bourbon than an overly alcoholic beer.  O - Just a great brew that more than lived up to expectations. I haven't been surprised by a beer's complexity like this since Veritas 009.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,southside,4.79,"I love this beer so much I can't stop drinking the homebrew clone that tastes exactly like it. It's so well balanced, it is well worth the hype. The bourbon aroma and notes add such a great complexity, but are so well hidden that the ABV is quite surprising to be so high. Can't imagine how good this would be if you let it sit for 6 months or so. The body is nice and thin which pairs well with the taste.

M: thick without being syrupy or sticky, the bourbon barrel-aging almost lifts the drink from your palate after each sip  O: totally get why this beer is so highly-rated.

Some of the coffee that you get in the normal FBS. But for sure, bourbon is there. The nose is extremely complex, and inviting.  T: This is more than a beer. It intense. Some boozey notes in the back of throat. Definitely some alcohol burn. You get the dark chocolate, the roasted coffee, some vanilla, and bourbon. My tongue was loving it, even with a palate that was destroyed from the tasting.  M: Full bodied chewy mouth feel.  O: A+ rated beer.

Ominous, and looks like a lunar eclipse from above.  S: First scents are sweet roasted coffee and sweet chocolate reminiscent of cake frosting.

Smooth, very palatable vanilla heat comes through from the barrel. Maple and caramel round it out.  M: This is no doubt a heavy beer, but feels smooth and drinkable on my palate. Perfect bite of carbonation up front moves across creating a creamy, silky mouthfeel. Honestly delectable.  O: Let this beer warm up! I served it a bit cold, but its transformation to cellar/room temperature was a pleasure. It's true that they say this beer is dangerously drinkable. It lives up to it's hype.

Chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, coffee, and a hint of cream. No astringent smell that often comes when you get in the 10%+ range.  Taste follows the smell, loads of coffee and cocoa. The vanilla and bourbon on the backbone are in perfect harmony with the overall taste. This is the prime example of a stout aged in bourbon barrels for me. Nothing over the top, just a balance that is not achieved by any others.  Mouthfeel is medium-heavy, not overbearingly coating or sticky like many bourbon stouts.  Overall this is the beer for me.

Coffee is still hangin' in there along with vanilla, oak, bourbon, roasty malt, and slight hops. This smells incredible, nothing is out of place here, just super smooth and well integrated. Coffee and bourbon are right at home in this dark brew.  T: The chocolate and roasted malts are huge in the taste. The coffee has toned down a little bit, honestly to a great level. The bourbon doesn't have much burn or add too much booze to the beer, it just adds a moderate level of sweetness to balance out the roast and char. A slight hop presence is still felt but thankfully it isn't overdone. A bit of char lingers on the palate. The alcohol isn't much of an issue even at the high ABV.  M: Smooth, creamy, and thick.

The bourbon is quite apparent in the beginning, but the coffee, vanilla and caramel really come through in the middle and balance this out. Not overly astringent coffee flavor either. Smooth throughout the tasting.  M: A full bodied beer that leaves a boozy taste on the palate. Only the slightest amount of 'alcohol burn' hits the back of the mouth which is impressive for a brew over 11% abv.  O: As many before me have said, this is a fantastic beer.

1199,19960,CBlack85,4.42,"On tap at Mac's Speed Shop Steel Creek. Served in an 8 oz. pint glass.  The beer is completely black with no visible highlights. There is a big, creamy, dark brown colored head that slowly recedes leaving behind bits of lacing.  Lots of roasted malts, chocolate, caramel, and coffee. The bourbon is definately present but not overpowering. It really mingles well with the rest of the aromas present. There are also some smaller hints of toffee that round out the nose.  The dominant flavors are that of roasted malts, caramel, some coffee, and to a lesser degree chocolate and vanilla. Like the nose the bourbon is noticable but not dominating. Just a hint of alcohol burn that lets you know that it is there. A very well crafted beer. Full bodied and mildly carbonated, dangerously easy to drink and very smooth.

S: holy bourbon, Batman! Huge notes of oak and bourbon, ground coffee, bittersweet chocolate, caramel, toffee, malts, and more bourbon. Complex and potent.  T: follows the nose. Bourbon flavors flow throughout as chocolate, sweet malts, bitter coffee, caramel, and roasted malts each take their turn stepping forward. Finishes sweet and roasty with even more chocolate and warming alcohol. Finish really reminds me of chocolate milk. Fantastic!  M: perfectly carbonated and full-bodied, but not as thick as many of its peers. More body would be helpful.  D: pretty easy to drink.

1199,19960,StarshipPoopers,4.82,"A - Completely opaque black with a considerable amount of mocha brown head. Lots of lacing clings to the glass.  S - Even a few minutes out of the fridge it already has many layers to start picking through, but it's a treat once it's warm.  T - Bourbon and vanilla sweetness countered by coffee, dark chocolate and roasted malts. Incredible complexity without being overpowering or too unbalanced. The oak is also noticeable in amongst all of the other flavours. It's an exciting beer from start to finish.  M - Quite heavy. While not completely motor oil, it's texture is very thick and syrupy. The full body helps to leave an excellent aftertaste as well, with all of the flavours still lingering long after the beer is finished.  O - An incredible beer that I am glad to have gotten a hold of. I had worried from the aroma that it might be on the sweet side, but Founders have done an excellent job in achieving a perfect balance.

Nose is an incredible mixture of vanilla, bourbon, dark roasted coffee and chocolate.  The first sip brings forth solid espresso flavors, followed by bourbon, oak, vanilla, and roasted barley. Bitterness is present, keeping it all in check in a beguiling balancing act. Alcohol definitely comes forward in this beer, but in all the right ways, playing off of the other flavors and enhancing their individual characteristics. Bourbon and sweet vanilla overtones stay all the way through the finish with espresso notes in the breath. Toasted oak takes over at the end, drying things out with an earthy spiciness, and leaving the palate ready for more.

Just a delight!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,matttttYCE,4.32,"Appearance - A little more than a finger high brown head is produced from a moderate pour rate into my Stone IRS glass. Color is pretty much black as the night, as I expected. Head diminishes pretty quickly and leaves some slight lace. That's expected also from the high alcohol content and barrel aging.  Smell - Smell is actually not that much like what I expected, but not bad at all. Up front I'm getting coffee, dark chocolate, very rich roasted malts, some burnt notes, caramel, and sweetness. Behind that I get some lighter notes of vanilla, oak, and bourbon aromas. These aromas come out a little more as this warms but the bourbon/vanilla really take a back seat here, which wasn't what I was expecting at all. Not bad but I think I'd prefer a little more bourbon aroma.  Taste - Bourbon flavors aren't as light as the aroma suggested. Taste is VERY balanced and complex like Founder's achieved the perfect ratio to let the base beer shine through while the bourbon, coffee, and vanilla work their magic in such a wonderful way. I get dark chocolate, coffee, burnt and roasted malts, a little bittersweet taste in there, lighter oak, vanilla, caramel, balanced bourbon flavors, and some light alcohol burn on the way down. Really are a treat to sip on.  Mouthfeel - Feel is essentially medium-full. It's actually not as thick as I thought it'd be, but pretty full. Consistency is viscous, carbonation is light, body is pretty close to full, and the finish is nice and long, leaving me with lingering hints of all the complex flavors.  Overall - I am very impressed with this beer. Some people might crucify me for saying this, but it's not my favorite bourbon barrel aged beer. With that said, I really do like this beer. I can't imagine the bourbon flavors have faded a bunch since bottling, but I'd still like to have this really soon after bottling. Either way, I completely enjoyed this beer. It's fantastic, complex, and just one of those beers that everyone should try. Thank you SO very much to Tom/trxxpaxxs for sending this to me (among many other goodies) in the N00B BIF 5!

Leaves great lacing.  S: Bourbon, but not dominating like other BBA beers. Dark roast coffee comes through beautifully. Chocolate, vanilla, and butterscotch fill out the sweet notes of this beer. A very creamy aroma overall. And even though BBA no boozy aromas come through.  T: Vanilla and chocolate sweetens the tip of the tongue.Then a roasted coffee bitterness comes through, still leaving the vanilla lingering on the tip of your tongue. All the bourbon comes through in the end. Doesn't have the big butterscotch aftertaste that other BBA beers have. Light alcohol and warms the stomach a lot.  M: Amazing mouthfeel. Thick and full but not chewy. Super creamy and velvety. Coats every part of the mouth with flavor.  O: Wow. Not over hyped one bit. Meets every expectation I have. Just lovely.

Thank you for this one Handle. 2011 bottle into a tulip.  It just glugs out of the bottle, like thick motor oil. Pitch black. A very dark brown head with some large bubbles forms, but it's barely there before it fades, leaving a ring of lace around my glass. Minimal lacing, nothing too enticing. Tiny legs. Leaves an oily film around the glass.  A very sweet-smelling beer. Wood and a lot of vanilla come through, and underneath there's just a little bit of alcohol. Really not too much coffee here, but there is a strong aroma of dark chocolate fudge. The bourbon is the centerpiece.  Taste is smooth as silk. The bourbon presence is huge: to a greater degree than the aroma, there is just a ton of oak and vanilla. Leather and tobacco compliment these flavors nicely. Oddly enough, my initial thoughts are of smoking a cigar - not necessarily because of the taste itself, but because all of these huge flavors coat my whole mouth like thick smoke so all I can think about is KBS. The alcohol is kept in check, though this is warm going down. Really rich chocolate. Some bitter coffee grounds, but they seem to have toned down after a few months in the bottle.  The mouthfeel is awesome: thick, rich and syrupy. The carbonation errs on the lighter side, which works perfectly. All -bal aged stouts should drink like this.  A standard bearer of the style, it's a shame this has become a hassle to procure in Boston.

Perfect mokah minimual head with thicky gooey lacing.  Smell: Complex, robust, initial bouquet of bourbon subdued by vanilla with notes of toffee, roasted coffee and dark, deep, rich chocolate.  Taste: Bourbon burn, aged, destroyed vanilla, bitter dark roasted coffee and bittersweat chocolate. Chocolate and coffee reside on the finish followed by a resounding 11.2 alcohol burn. The feel of being alive. I maintain that this beer is better fresh rather than aged because the vanilla and coffee flavors are much stronger...here they seem diminished.

Only an inch of beige/mocha head with an aggessive pour. Some decent lacing.  The nose is excellent: smells of a perfect blend of bourbon, roasted coffee, dark fruit, and chocolate.  Taste is roasted coffee bitterness combined with chocolate/molasses smoothness, with bourbon booziness. I love it.  Mouthfeel is smooth with mild carbonation and some nice warmth from the bourbon notes.  Overall this beer is worth all the hype and all the praise.

No hints of any light come through even when directly held up to the lamp. A ever so slim tan head sticks around for a little bit. Some good lacing coats the glass as well.  The aromas are strong to say the least. Very powerful notes of dark chocolate, quality bourbon, some vanilla, caramel, and lots of roasted malt. Really deep and complex nose. Didn't get a ton of coffee but it was there.  Taste is just as great as the smell. Nice bourbon up front melds wonderfully with chocolate undertones. The roasted malts are pronounced and add another layer to savor. Some nice coffee notes also help pull everything together making for a phenomenal beer. A bit of alcohol warmth in there too.  Full bodied, very rich and smooth. Carbonation is pretty mild.  One of the best beers I've had in my short beer drinking career.

Looks like black coffee with the slightest brown ring when tilted and held to the light. Not much head to speak of, but still enough carbonation to create a little lacing on the edges.  S: Chocolate, Coffee, Vanilla, Oak and bourbon all swirling together. A subtle alcohol heat and sweet malts.  T: Bitter chocolate, with smooth vanilla and coffee undertones. A bit of a boubon burn, and some dark caramel.  M: Thick and syrupy. Pleasant carbonation. Perfect for just sipping.  O: With about a year and half on this one in the cellar, it is holding up quite well. Things seem to be leveling out a bit and finding a smoother balance. It's hard to think of improving on this. Just the best barrel-aged stout I've ever tasted.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Roke87,5,"BA REVIEW #100 (Saved something a little special for my 100th review)  12oz. bottle, chilled and poured into a snifter, 2011 vintage.  Appearance- Pours black as midnight, one of if not the darkest beers I have ever seen to this day. Gentle pour yields a very small bubbly top that very quickly disappears into the darkness with a very very small ring around the glass, you almost have to search for any type of head left over after the pour, leaving  Smell- I’m getting huge amounts of bitter coffee aromas right off the bat paired with that woody bourbon aroma, mild dark chocolate in there as well with some sweet hints of vanilla and a mild touch of roasted malt in the nose.  Taste- Holy shite this thing will put hair on your chest, wow what an adventure for the palate! First off I get a milk chocolate flavour paired with the alcohol bite from the bourbon, very sweet with hints of vanilla in there as well, lots of roasted bitter coffee notes coming through next with a mild touch of roasted malts in there as well.  Mouthfeel- Full bodied and smooth as silk, creamy and goes down as sexy as red velvet cake, very little to no carbonation but the tastes more than make up for the lack of carbonation.  Overall- I think only one word can describe this beer; amazing! It deserves all the hype and score that it has here on BA, this is easily one of the best stouts in the entire word. Everything about this beer is absolutely stunning, from the initial kick of the bourbon in the tastes balanced perfectly by the coffee, chocolate milk, vanilla, and woody flavours to the amazing smells right down to the feel of it on the palate. This is a world class beer for a reason, all other stouts take notes because this is what you should taste like, and hides the big ABV extremely well. Will always search this one out and drink it every day if I could, there’s nothing more to say, 5/5, A+ all day everyday.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,amanofbeer,4.73,"Pours very flatly, little to no head at first, but carbonation comes through seconds after the pour, creating a tan head. The liquid is visquous and coffee like. Dark dark dark.  The aroma is instensely roasty, and actually quite sharply bitter, seemingly from the coffee, but maybe hops too?  Very sweet. complex, and sharply chocolatey. Bitterness comes through with both the hops and the coffee and chocolate.  Again, very viscous and coating. Good feeling, but could stand more age at lower temps.  Overall, I think this beer is one of the top of it's class. It exhibits the sweeter imperial stout qualities while including the coffee and chocolate 'breakfast' flavors.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Netdigger2,3.83,"2010 bottle acquired in a trade, served at 50°F  Pours black with dark mocha head. Sparse lacing throughout.  Smell is oak, coffee, malt, cacao  Taste is oak and chocolate, some booze.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, softened by the oak, heavy carbonation.  This is a good beer, but so overly burnt oaky, that it is tough to finish alone.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,cavedave,4.5,"Thanks to jager68. John, you da man, I owe you big time.  Darkest brown flirting with black, topped by a generous layer of brown foam that recedes to a skim that lasts surpisingly long considering what this is. Legs and lace are lashed to the glass.  Coffee and chocolate with some righteous and clean bitter hop aroma, roast and toast, rich and redolent with resiny goodness. Light bourbon and vanilla, some hints of tannin, and a floral component beneath it all. My gosh it is heaven for the nose.  Oh what a flavor, laid back this ain't, but it's no steamroller either. It starts with some roasty sweet and coffee, grabs the handle of semi sweet chocolate and caramel, alcohol and bourbon jump on the back, vanilla kicks in, and roasty bitter heads it down the road to an ending that is sweet, bright, full of the barrel notes, and clean as a whistle. Awesome taste, a touch less complex than CBS, not as balanced, very brash and assertive, with a finish just a bit more bitter.  Mouthfeel is stupendous. Had I not tried CBS recently, I would rate this the best in mouth I've tasted. Highly viscous, creamy and drinkable, strong but approachable, brilliant finish that just gets better as it warms.  Folks, the big trio that Founders makes, CBS, KBS, and FBS are all so good, each differing and excelling in their own ways, that to miss out on any would be doing oneself an injustice. Superior stout from the masters.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,SkiBum22,4.5,"A- Pitch black, one finger of nice brown head. Very little lacing that resides quickly down the sides of the glass.  S - Roasty sweet malt, chocolate, and bourbon.  T - Big milk chocolate and bourbon oak up front. Then comes dark chocolate and espresso balanced by the vanilla from the barrel. There's so much going on here, the vanilla, chocolate, and coffee work together so well.  M - The mouth is velvety smooth and full bodied. While the carbonation is week it doesn't take away from the well balanced thickness  O - Been waiting to try this beer for a long time. It definitely lived up to the hype.

1199,19960,angrybabboon,4.42,"Review adapted from notes taken 4/3/11  Appearance: Super black, not much of a head, but some tan lacing - very oil-like in appearance  Smell: Bourbon, and epic burnt malts - some caramelized malts, sugar - coffee, chocolate - pretty crazy, but not overwhelming  Taste: Remarkably balanced in terms of flavor - in other words, it isn't a bourbon bomb - tons of coffee, vanilla, chocolate - burnt malts, roasted malts - complex, with some earthiness and nice, burnt bitterness  Mouthfeel: I had this in 2010 and it was silky-smooth - in 2011, I found it to be less perfect - smooth, medium body, a reasonable amount of alcohol heat  Overall: A modern classic? Yes.  This beer absolutely blew my mind the first time I had it. When I had it again (the source of this review), I was less blown away but still impressed. This is such a solid beer. There are very few beers that do bourbon-barrel aging better.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,2xHops,4.23,"I really enjoyed this bottle of KBS.  A: Rich, rich, rich, rich black colored appearance with little head.  The taste is exquisite with bourbon flavors seeping through as you drink it. This is kind of beer where you would want to drink much more slowly than you usually do. The oak barrels really give this beer another layer of character than you don't get in an usual stout.  The mouthfeel is great, and it's not overpowering nor underwhelming. There's just a right balance without being too thin or thick. For something that has a strong ABV, I really thought this beer was just perfect. The alcohol did not come screaming at you at all.  I'm not a big stout drinker, but I certainly enjoy this one. This kind of beer is something you would want to drink slowly either by itself or with a nice dinner.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Dave128,4.38,"A - Pours a THICK rich black. There is pretty much no head not that I was expecting any. Comes out almost like a sauce. A small ruby head rises after the pour is finished and fizzes out to the edges.  S - Coffee, Chocolate, and Dark roasted malts. I was expecting to smell more bourbon, but I really don't get much of it at all :(  T - Like the smell, rich and complex. Gets much better as it warms. I made the mistake of pouring this one too cold and wasnt too impressed, but now its true colors are showing. Bittersweet. Alcohol bites pretty hard in the finish on some sips.  M - Heavy with perfect carbonation. Like drinking a liquid breakfast.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,jondeelee,5,"One of the rarer beers on the market, this is released every March and is, according to the maker, available pre-order only. A contact at a local liquor store begged and wheedled his way into a case of the stuff, and I then begged and wheedled my way into a small, expensive fraction of that case.  Even the smallest whiff lets you know that you're in for a unique beer experience. This is a stout, so has many of the standard stout aromas--heavy chocolate malts, coffee, caramel, pure vanilla--but smells like the juice of four stouts had somehow been wrung from their bottles and poured in a concentrated form into a fifth bottle.  The taste experience is no less incredible, and the sheer quantity and volume of flavors that rush over the tongue are truly astounding. The almost-burnt flavors of chocolate malt are more massive than in pretty much any Imperial Stout I've tried, and are matched by black coffee flavors that I've only seen equaled in Turkish coffees. Vanillas, caramels, and tobaccos dance gaily in the background. And all of this rests thickly over a base of bourbon flavors that will leave your soft palate tingling--as well as your nose, if you're not careful.  I do admit that the sheer size of flavors in here will prove a hindrance to many, if not most beer drinkers. As for me, I've just found a new favorite stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,DoctorDog,4.32,"Presentation: 02/09 vintage 12 oz. bottle into a snifter. Thanks to beveritt for passing this along to me.  A- Deep and dark, essentially black and opaque. Pours with just a small dark brown head, which recedes to a smattering of bubbles almost instantly.  S- Rich, roasted coffee, chocolate, bourbon and vanilla....wow....  T- Bourbon and oak laden vanilla, dark roasted coffee and caramel char give a bit of a smoky edge to the finish. A bit of a boozy kick.  M- Moderately low carbonation, with a fairly full feel.  O- Good to very good. Standout smell and flavor...this beer teeters on the edge of ""A+"" IMO.  Future outlook: This brew did very well after 2.5 years of hibernation....would like to see how one would withstand even longer...but alas, this was my only sample, and the hassle to getting another one when they come out and stowing it for 3+ years....",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

After a several whiffs there is a good amount of bourbon and vanilla. Milk chocolate and coffee are also obviously present. Also picking up hints brown sugar and caramel.  Wonderful bourbon flavor, bold and smooth. Vanilla and milk chocolate follow with coffee tagging along. Fantastic roasted malts are there the whole way through.  Mouth feel is heavenly, thick and creamy. Slight alcohol at the finish. This is the way a bigger bourbon stout should feel.  Amazing beer overall. The bourbon flavor is outstanding and the balance of all flavors is second to none.

1199,19960,dnrobert24,2.94,"KBS. The notes on BA say this is NOT a barrel-aged version of the breakfast stout. Too bad. I love their breakfast stout. This? Not so much. It pours oily black with minimal tan lacing. No head, really, but none is expected. The first pour stirs up fresh coffee beans and toasty-smoky malts. It is very inviting. Later on, aromas of chocolate and dark fruits emerge. Finally, I start to smell the vanilla. I am encouraged to dive into this beer. But...I am amazed at the disconnect to the taste. There is a bitter sourness that permeates each drink, like I am licking an oak cube. There is a mysterious bitterness that keeps butting in. I keep looking for flavors in the glass and end up furrowing my eyebrows in disappointment. A hot alcohol burn ends up carrying the day. It reminds me of 100 proof cherry brandy. Think of chocolate covered cherries with a grain alcohol center and you get what I'm tasting. Yeah, I like chocolate, and I like cherries, but c'mon, this is too much. Maybe some time in the cellar will do this some good.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smells of chocolate and Kentucky err...bourbon with maybe a bit of vanilla.  Oh my gosh this is amazing. I hadn't had one of these since early in my craft beer journey and it's even better than I remember.  Lots of chocolate at the beginning rounding into a little bitterness and smooth alcohol finishes with a bourbon kick and some lingering bitterness. The bourbon is INCREDIBLY smooth. Some bourbon beers are way too harsh for my tastes, but this is perfect. You can taste the bourbon, but it's not overpowering.  Not quite as syrupy as some stouts which is good. Very little to no carbonation which again is perfect for the style.  I'm very glad I bought this guy's three friends as well. In fact, I may go back tomorrow to buy a few more.

1199,19960,seabass87,4.42,"Another excellent gift I got as an anniversary present. Bottled 02/25/11.  A- Pitch black... One of the darkest beers I've seen. Aggressive pour forms just a finger of dark brown head. Head dissipates quickly and leaves a frothy ring that yields slight lacing.  S- Dark chocolate biscotti, bitter mocha, bourbon, vanilla extract. The sweetness is balanced well by the warm bourbon. Inviting.  T- The bitter chocolate and bourbon tastes are dominant in the front. The bourbon is handled very smoothly, and doesn't have a strong bite during transition phase. Instead, a nice coffee taste comes along and eases over into a well-balanced combination of all of the above flavors. This carries into an aftertaste I can best describe as like an irish carbomb.  M- Medium-thick bodied for the style. Zero carbonation - this is a good thing for this beer. Dry, sticky finish - as one would expect from a strong stout.  O- I love this stout. It has all the classic stout flavors one could want, and handles them in a very smooth fashion.

The nose is a delightful melange of chocolate, oak, bourbon and vanilla. Taste starts out with sweet roasted malt accentuated by notes of chocolate, coffee and vanilla. A very nice bourbon presence asserts itself in the finish, warming things up a bit. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous with an excellently low level of carbonation which lends a smooth, creamy quality to the beer. This is one of my very favorite barrel aged stouts. The different aspects of the beer are melded together with such skill that the advertised 11.2% ABV is completely hidden.

1199,19960,ehammond1,4.6,"Bottle (2011)  Thanks for sharing Sam!  Motor oil. Black. Thick. Substantial. Tan, hearty, head. Not much lacing, but more than forgivable at this ABV.  Gobsmacked by this beer's aroma--it's just so complete, without being overwhelming or too alcoholic. It's a divine cornucopia: bourbon, vanilla, wood, coffee, chocolate, earth/dirt, roasted malt.  The flavor is just as delightful: the bourbon, vanilla, and coffee make for an astounding threesome. No one flavor is particularly dominating, they're all accessible, yet the way they play off one another is truly exceptional.  What's so shocking about this beer is how well it disguises it's monstrous alcohol punch--because there isn't one! I began drinking this beer, got halfway through it, looked at the bottle, and was just floored that the label read ""11.2% ALC. BY VOL."" Though I hate the word, this is the perfect time to use it: unbelievable.  Thick and luscious mouthfeel.

The body is an extremelty dark brown to black color, completely impenetrable by light.  The scent is a perfect combination of dark chocolate, coffee, and bourbon. They mix into a great concoction which drives you into the flavor quite will.  The flavor follows right from the nose, it starts off with a roasted malt coffee flavor in the beginning. That fades into a bittersweet chocolate taste which lingers on the tongue as the bourbon fades into the picture. It finishes with the barrell aged vanilla bourobn combination with stays with you for a while.

1199,19960,Cavery,4.17,"2010 and 2009 bottles sampled side by side. A fun little mini vertical, if you can even call a year to year comparison that.  Both had in an Over-Sized Wine glass.  09'  A: Black cherry body with a peppering of brown bubbles. No real head with a violent pour. No let up in the opacity of the beer, but it really has a brown character to the body. It's really not such a deep black. (3.5)  S: Oak nuttiness with a shot of whiskey. Some really faint nutmeg spice with sweet alcohols giving a big profile of coffee liqueur. There's some unrelenting hot alcohol notes. No major burn, it's just a dominant note. (3.5)  T: Forward sweet bourbon and nutty oak fight like siblings for attention. It appears the bourbon is the eldest. The alcohol does eventually evaporate to reveal a tame woody note. Good but not great, at least not now. (4)  M: Really this is quite flat, a very watery mouth that definitely hasn't survived the test of time. Flat coffees with healthy doses of whiskey. This is hot water in the mouth. (3)  O: You can tell in the flavor that there are more than a few ingredients that are lost in time. The base beer isn't overwhelmingly hot, it's just that the veneer of this castle has long since eroded, and reveals a boozey skeleton. Complexity compromised, but not bad even considering that. (4)  10'  A: A fluffy creamy brown bubble film covers the top of a creamed coffee body. The resemblance of coffees is memorable, and sets the tone for the rest of the experience. Appears very alive and enhanced by its time in the wood. (4)  S: Creamy spiced marshmallow with cinnamon, coco, and most certainly vanilla. All of this is engulged by a warming bed of spiked iced coffees. A mousse with inclusions of nutty ganaches reign supreme for a yummy nose. (4.5)  T: Huge cinnamon marshmallow smore character to this one. The graham crackers do appear, but are stale compared to the milk chocolates and roast marshmallow notes. Chocolate chip shortbread cookies are my favorite note in this mess of American campfire desserts. (4.5)  M: Fluffly mouth without a strong presence of bubbles. The mouth is soft and mellow, and it remains so throughout. The body is medium-full, with the flavor making it feel like it could really use that truly full backbone. (4)  O: A buttery treat that stands out as a trendsetter for the genre of bourbon barrel-aged stouts. A classic due to the mix of lively spices and flavors. The ingredients really do mingle in here; and transforms the beverage into a personal all-american bakery. I'd say this is very good, and makes me want to try a fresh bottle. The ingredients seemed much more apparent in the newer than older bottle. Though I wouldn't give up on the 09' entirely, as my bottle certainly had a rather weak feel.

1199,19960,drowland,4.36,12oz bottle (2009) into a snifter. Pours deep black with shimmering brown when held to the light. The small head is dark leather brown and dissipates quickly into a small ringlet. The aroma is honestly comprised of mostly a big dose of fresh roasted coffee. Underneath this is a small helping of nice bourbon and oak characteristics including a lot of vanilla and a touch of wood. The sweet aroma of whiskey touches through but not much. A drink taken in while inhaling starts quite sweet and flows into wood and vanilla mixed with a touch of citrus. The mid is all added coffee and this is definitely what lingers with undertones of very dark chocolate. As it warms the chocolate comes out more and more. There is a nice carbonation that mingles perfectly with the silky mouthfeel.

Slick and oily texture, and the bitterness leaves you with a dry tingly aftertaste.  O- Very good beer. Had this in the spring and for some reason it didn't impress me, but glad I was proven wrong.

1199,19960,SubpoenaDeuces,4.7,"Founders KBS, Imperial Stout, 11.2% abv  A: Deep oily hues, with very very faint brown at the thinnest edges of the glass. The viscosity on this beer is ridiculously thick and it coats the glass like chocolate robitussin. It pours with a big foamy collar and huge khaki bubbles.  S: Wow. Deep chocolate scents with hints of boozy bourbon notes, cocoa and vanilla bean. The wood is faint and I would appreciate a Pappy Van Winkle version of this but, now we are splitting hairs of what is already an amazing beer.  T: Again, just outrageously good. Being from the west coast it is difficult to admit absolute defeat but the tag team of this masterpiece with Rare BCBS must make me raise the white flag on imperial stouts. It has such a deep taste to it with a ton of complexity to it. This is chocolate robitussin with a heavy yoohoo coating and hot alcoholic balance on the front. The sweet lingers a bit and the smoky and coffee notes go to work and dry out the back sections of your mouth, which would piss you off if you didn't see the interplay of how well it works together. It’s a simple dynamic of, drink, coating, swallow, want more, drink more. Again, this is very drinkable and may crack out of the imperial stout cloistering for warmer climate drinking. Some things are just delicious enough on their own to defy pigeonholing.  M: this is exxon mobil in a glass, perfect for sipping because a little bit goes a long way, you put the glass down for a few moments and joy representatives are still within your gumline cleaning seals and waiting for the smoke and coffee notes to clear. Drink it in the morning and taste it all day. Overall a fantastic stout and the only contender to really put an even challenge up against the abyss and perhaps even defeating it, wish I had more test data to contrast. A couple bottles of this simply is not enough.  D: this is its roughest area as it is so aggressive so filling so hectoring in approach you have a hard time welcoming it for long periods, it kicks your mouth all over the room like a spaghetti western brawl and when the 12oz is done you are cast through swinging double doors and brush the coffee notes off of your chest, but you do want more. You want to slide this KBS across an old tymie piano simply because the fight itself is so enjoyable.  Narrative: Claire Murkmuggins didn’t mind the delta. Shoot, half her family couldn’t tell you the way rightside out of the delta. In fact, she kinda liked its murkiness, the way the cool silt ran through her toes when she was fishing for crawdads. The deep black nights where the bayou water looked like shimmering oil, ignited by the moonlight. I mean sure, she liked all that just fine, but what she really aspired to do, I mean, someday of course, Claire wanted to take over the family Chocolate Milk dairy. She grew tired of harvesting coffee beans all day with all the youngins, she had that dark capitalism spirit and she wanted in on that chocolate empire.

1199,19960,Kayn169,4.28,"12oz bottle poured into a tulip Vintage: 2011  A- Pure black, no light coming through at all. Very nice carbonation for a stout. Tops off with just over a finger of mocha colored head. Head is a medium density, that sticks around for quite a long time. Although after about 15 min the carbonation subsides substantially.  S- Upfront there's bourbon, old coffee grounds, and a good dose of oak that seems to weave through the other aromas. Behind this there is an undertone of very bitter chocolate, something almost metallic, and a slight alcohol burn  T- Just like the nose, taste is full of coffee grounds, bourbon, that seems to increase was it warms, oak, and a vanilla that I didnt get in the nose. Although I may have misidentified the odd slightly metallic smell, and could have been the vanilla, mixing with the bourbon. Bitter chocolate finishes as it passes the back of the tongue.  M- Suprisinly light and well carbonated for such a big stout. This cuts the thickness and stickiness of the sugars, from clinging on the tongue. Very nice  O- Very good, glad the bourbon is an accent to the beer versus a completely dominating attribute. Also glad for just a hint of vanilla, I'm always scared when vanilla is used as a descriptive flavoring, as it is usually used in excess.

1199,19960,infi,4.39,"Bottled on 02/11 – originally had during Thanksgiving, but now reviewed with a proper sized pour!  Poured into a Corsendonk tulip.  Black body with very little carbonation. Very thin, mocha-colored head that reduces into a cap and leaves mini bits of speckled lacing. Smell is full of dark-roasted coffee and dark, bittersweet chocolate pieces. Great barrel-aged qualities, with the oak, vanilla and bourbon– all leaving aromatic identities. The bourbon presents a thin amount of heat towards the end.  Taste is actually filled with coffee-like roastiness, but also massive amounts of oaky tannins, vanilla and caramel. Great amount of bittersweet chocolate on the end, which leaves a subtle astringency in the finish. The bourbon leaves a thin burn at the end too, but not as hot as I originally remembered. Complexity arises further as you let warm. Very, very comparable to Parabola in taste with its flavor qualities.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied– not as big and thick as other bbl-aged ones. Just about silky with little to no carbonation in feel. Amazing tasting beer, even for how fresh it might be (~5mo old). Not as great as CBS, but definitely has the clout. Drink one now or age further – you won't be disappointed.  #3 of 9.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

This one was bottled on 02/25/11 at 2:43pm. Enjoyed on 07/14/11.  A - Poured into a Stone goblet. Absolutely pitch black, can't see any red around the edges at all. A very small tan head forms and recedes quickly. Leaves no lacing, has really good alcohol legs. Good looking high alcohol stout.  S - Lots of bourbon still present at this beer's young age. Behind the oaky vanilla of the bourbon is some light espresso and some dark chocolate. I know there's no lactose sugar in here but it smells as if there is.  T - What an excellent beer. Big milk chocolate and bourbon oak up front. Then comes a bitter dark chocolate and espresso onslaught balanced by the vanilla from the barrel. A lingering chocolatey sweetness and some vanilla is offset by a pretty hefty alcohol burn. There's so much going on here, the vanilla, chocolate, and coffee work together so well.  M - Mouthfeel is perfect for an imperial stout. Very thick and creamy with just a hint of carbonation.  O - Overall, this is one of my favorite beers to date. Lots of alcohol burn at the moment but it works well. One of the most complex beers I've had.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The mouth is velvety smooth and full bodied. While the carbonation is week it doesn't take away from the well balanced thickness  Overall the beer is fantastic.

1199,19960,Klym,4.8,"Poured into a snifter.  A: Pours a syrupy black with a small tanned head. Dark and deep like a good BA stout should be.  S: Espresso, bourbon, spice, and chocolate-- everything dark and rich.  T: Pretty much the same as the nose. Your classic bourbon barrel aged stout flavors, all exceptionally deep and rich. The most amazing thing about this beer is that while it deals with such dark flavors and has a classically thick mouthfeel, it's amazingly sessionable. This is the only BA stout I've ever encountered that I could imagine knocking back four or 5 glasses of. Everything is so incredibly well blended together, you can't get more blend and balance than this.  M: Really balanced mouthfeel, thick but thin enough and smooth. Unlike some BA stouts it doesn't make you feel like you're drinking delicious mud. Again, I don't think you can get more balance than this.  O: KBS is worthy of its worship, I think that can't be denied. If you're talking about classic flavors of bourbon spiciness, chocolate, coffee, and a little roast, I don't think you can put those flavors together any better than it's done in KBS or deliver them in a better mouthfeel. I will say though that if you're looking for not just a perfectly executed version of a classic bourbon barrel aged stout and instead are looking to be surprised with new and bold flavors, that KBS might disappoint you. Besides the balance, blend, and excellent execution, I'd argue there's little here that's very original or new to an experienced stout drinker. Anyway, my hat goes off to founders for this one.

1199,19960,lisomiso,4.1,"Thanks kdiggidy!  Pours like motor oil. We smell a little bit of acidity, a lot of bourbon, and some milk chocolate, sadly only the slightest suggestion of coffee and only after I taste it. It's hot, too much bourbon and oak for my palate. Walows disagrees that it's excessive, but he concedes those flavors are dominant, particularly oak tannins...  As the beer warms the chocolate comes out more, as does the coffee, but its a bit of a struggle as the heat also becomes more expressive. It rounds out nicely... but it's still kind of aggressive. Enigmatic!  11.2% jesus christ, it's pretty restrained considering the ABV, but Walows thinks it needs some time (he says eight months) and I'm considering not even drinking my 2nd bottle, since someone else will love it much more than I do...

Sadly no born on date though I know its this year's batch. The legendary KBS...will she live up to the hype?  A - Pours a motor oil black with a small, sticky copper head. Minimal lacing.  S - Prevalent scents of bourbon and vanilla. Hints of expresso find their way in. Incredibly balanced aromas.  T - There are so many layers to this beer, each so definable. It starts with a bitter chocolate and vanilla flavor. Coffee/ expresso flavors follow which are perhaps the most profound characteristics of this beer. It finishes with a slightly hot bourbon note and a lingering coffee taste. Chocolate and hot alcohol strengthens as the beer warms. Founders has found a near perfect balance between these three tiers.  M - Full bodied and incredibly smooth. Semi dry finish.  O - Outstanding barrel aged stout, perhaps the best of its kind. It's certainly a sipper and one to enjoy over the course of an hour, perhaps more. However, with that said, the booze might be slightly too hot at times, especially as it warms.

Simply amazing.  T - The bitterness of coffee and dark dark chocolate come up front with the vanilla, bourbon and smokiness follows it. This is truly remarkable for an 11 percent beer, but the alcohol is not there at all. Not as much chocolate as I would have thought from the smell.  M - Smooth as can be.

1199,19960,Spider889,4.55,"Review of the 2011 batch, fresh the week it was released. Taken from notes.  This is a thick black beer. Quite dense and viscous looking. The head took a little coaxing, but was very dark like toffee or coffee ice cream. The lacing on my snifter was very thick and heavy.  Smells super roasty, almost grainy at times. Chocolate and the aroma of heavy pumpkin bread waft forth. Faint dried coffee beans are there too, though the coffee isn't as potent as I remembered (or would prefer). Once the head had receded I was getting much more bourbony alcohol with notes of vanilla and oak.  The flavor is roast up front, followed by bourbon. Coffee comes through too, but again, it seems overpowered by everything else going on in this beer. Lots of alcohol warmth to fresh KBS. This year's seems much boozier than last year's was for me.  Between the bourbon, coffee, and strong roast there is also a lot of really nice chocolate flavor too. Rich cocoa powder and coffee char both linger after each sip.  The bottle claims 70 IBU's... really? You'd never know it. This beer is smooth, smooth, smooth.  As the beer continues to warm the vanilla rises and becomes very potent. Swirling the glass reveals an even stronger whiskey profile - sweet candied dates and Fig Newtons play off of the chocolate.  As for the mouthfeel - this stuff is super smooth despite the alcohol. I really need to try this beer aged, but I don't think I can save my last bottle long enough to notice much of a change. If you have some vintage KBS feel free to send some my way on our next trade!  KBS is not quite as thick on the feel as it appears, though it certainly still holds a bit of chewiness nonetheless. Overall KBS is KBS. It will always be amazing. However, I must say that be it the freshness over the 6-7 month old keg I reviewed from last year, or simply the 2011 batch, the bourbon is really hot here vs my last sampling. Also, this year I have been especially floored by the really rich chocolate and vanilla flavors.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

When agitated, earthy hops were noticeable for a short moment but then it was all bourbon. I couldn't smell anything but bourbon until it settled down.  Taste is incredibly balanced. Roast malt and vanilla up front with coffee beans. Coffee bitterness carries through to the middle with chocolate and molasses. The finish brings sweet chocolate and bourbon, with a pleasantly faint alcohol warmth, followed by coffee bitterness. Just as it was with the smell, the alcohol and bourbon become more prevalent when this beer is disturbed.  Full bodied, low carbonation. Smooth texture. Leaves a sticky coating.

1199,19960,azdback,4.87,"Poured into a large tulip glass. Color is as light sucking as possible. Black on black. The only light is the reflection off of the glass. As expected there isn't much carbonation and not much of a head either. What head does show up is dark brown and quite creamy. Lace is trying it's best with the %11.2 abv. it doesn't stand a chance of hanging out.  Smell is fantastic!!! Dark roasted aromas of coffee bean and vanilla. Maybe even chocolate coated coffee beans dipped in vanilla. The vanilla flavor is obviously coming from the bourbon barrels but this isn't that bourbony, maybe it is the absents of the alcohol smell.  Taste is out of this world. Everything that you want in a barrel aged beer is here and doesn't take any searching to find. The dark roasted coffee's and chocolates, the vanilla bean, the pipe tobacco smoke, the boozy bourbon undertones, and the dried fruit tartness, all blend together in a beautiful symphony of palate pleasing awesomeness. Wow!!! I drank this too fast, but I couldn't stop myself. I still have to review the mouthfeel with my last few swallows. Guess I blew my load too quickly... again.  Mouthfeel is rich and smooth, and soft as Italian leather. There aren't a whole lot of Imperial Stouts that can match this one. There is some nice warming of the throat from the alcohol. Maybe the standard by which all others should be judged in this style.  Overall, what else can I say.

1199,19960,CHickman,4.84,"Bottled on 2/25/2011: pours pitch black like a tar black hole with no light coming through and a 1 finger creamy light brown head that was full of bubbles and faded slowly leaving great tan foamy lacing and a layer on top.  Smells of bourbon, vanilla, oak barrels, burnt wood, coffee, toffee, cocoa, peat moss, dirt, syrup, molasses and roasted grains; this nose is sweet and reeks of bourbon, with hints of malt, grains and coffee grinds. This aroma is strong and the alcohol is a big factor, but not in a bad way. The booze came out the second the cap came off of the bottle.  Wow, this is rich and strong…the heat hits you up front, with the sweet bourbon and vanilla followed by coffee bitterness. After the swallow there is a mix of coffee, syrup, molasses, cocoa powder, roasted grains, herbs, perhaps some light citrus hops, sweet malt, and then a huge blast of chocolate and toffee. This is very sweet and boozy, complicated and confusing, and all the while delicious. The nose made me think that it would be full of bourbon, but this is chocolately and mellower than I anticipated. Considering the ABV, this goes down quite easy.  Mouthfeel is creamy smooth and almost watery, with basically no carbonation, a medium to heavy body and an overall heavy feel that still seems to slide down nicely with only a minor alcohol burn as it goes down. Very impressive feel considering the complexities of this brew and the bourbon and ABV.  While this is definitely not a session beer, it is an excellent experience beer and an excellent stout that was extremely flavorful. Founders has again lived up to the hype with another superb product which I highly recommend. The bourbon was a little heavy handed, but it should be expected since that is the design of this brew.  9/29/14-Had a well aged version bottled on 2/25/2011 and it still has the strong bourbon, oaky and smoked notes in the aroma, but the feel is so smooth it was like chocolate milk. Aftertaste is all bourbon, but it incorporates coffee, vanilla, chocolate and smoky flavors and tastes like the beer was just poured off the side of the barrel. As it warms the bourbon seems to pick up ground and dominate more, so you'd better like booze if you're drinking this one. The complexities of the wood and peat moss notes come out more too as it warms, and about the only thing that I might adjust was the heat level as it could to me be dialed back just a little bit. Even being 3 1/2 years old in the bottle plus the barrel aging can't stop this bad boy from coming on strong. This is Clint Eastwood's kind of beer, bad ass all the way. Really enjoyable.  3/30/15-2014 bottle aged at least a year; smells of cocoa, peat moss, oak barrels, molasses, bourbon and coffee grinds. Tastes sweet, but with more complex woody and bourbon flavors that allows coffee, vanilla, cocoa, herbal and earthy notes, caramel and the booze to come through much nicer than the other 2014 bottle I had last year. Much better aged, this was smoother and not as abrasive as the fresh bottle a year prior, really nice with the age. There is no masking the bourbon, it is in your face, but it's tamed after the extra year mellowing and lets the chocolate and cocoa add better flavors.  4/16/2015-second time I've had it on tap over the past few weeks and I can conclude that I think it's better and tastier on tap; it's mellower with nicer oaky and peat moss notes, and the bourbon is a less aggressive which makes it smoother. The brew warms you up as the ABV is evident and seems to hit the bloodstream immediately, even while sipping. Lots of good maltiness, roast and chocolate/caramel sweetness lets it slide down easy for such a heavy beer. Get it on tap if you can, it's best that way.  4/5/2017-Had one of my 2017 Release bottles and it was thinner than a porter but still the same tasty KBS I've come to enjoy. Very chocolate dominant tasting, but I like it as it has lots of char, smoky notes and trailing bourbon mixed with coffee grinds. My other bottles won't thicken up with age, but the flavor and aroma should improve. The head and lacing this year were better than usual, nice to look at indeed.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,NeutraAir,4.05,"This is a 2011 KBS I am drinking from an eight ounce snifter. No light shows through this dark abyss of flavor. A thin line head holding a dark caramel color; the foam dissipates into slim ring around the glass.  The smell is boozy with strong characters of dark chocolates and coffee. A very strong bodied stout. The coffee dominates the front into the middle but is overtaken by chocolate through the finish. All the while a very subtle bourbon underlying backing up both predominate flavors, but every drink surprises me with flavors I can't describe.       This is not something I would recommend to bourbon lovers, though it is still a very well rounded stout.

The smell is probably the best part of this beer. Lots off chocolate but smoothed out by slight vanilla/oak and a hint of coffee.

1199,19960,mwcullnane,4.78,"2011 draft at Trion, New Haven, IN  Appearance: Viscous and coffee black in appearance with faint head  Smell: Roasted grain, coffee, and faint bourbon aroma; not overwhelming  Taste: Exceptional. Coffee and chocolate flavors mingle with similar flavors contributed by specialty grains. This is an amazing beer.  Mouthfeel: I didn't have to chew it, unlike some other high quality stouts. So that's good. Went down exactly the same as bottled kbs - smooth as silk.  Overall: Smell could be more intense but this is merely my opinion and should not come at a cost to other attributes. Taste is superior to Bourbon County and Dark Lord imho. I find it hard to give any beer a 5.0. This beer could only get better if it were allowed to age for a while. That's why I got a case when it came out :)",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,draheim,4.57,"12oz bottle dated 2/25/11 poured into a snifter - thanks Dope and/or tai4ji2x!  Pitch black beer with a minimal tan head that quickly dissipates into a ring of bubbles around the side of the glass.  Nose is dark chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla.  First sip is a complex blend of cocoa, bourbon, espresso, and vanilla.  The balance is great, masking but not entirely hiding the 11.2% ABV. The beer is smooth, but also provides a gentle hop bite, reminding me of KBS's 70 IBUs. The bitterness works though, balancing some of the sweeter elements.  Allowed to warm for a few minutes now in the glass, it's clear that this is a very special beer. I don't want it to end but I can't stop sipping.

1199,19960,BobCS,4.72,"A - very dark brown and nearly opaque, pours with a brown head that falls quickly leaving a ring of lace, clearly viscous and leaves a nice film on the glass when swirled  S - coffee and chocolate and alcohol are all very clear up front  T - coffee and roasted malt come on strong with a good bit of sweet malt mingling with the chocolate while bourbon dominates the finish which is long and warm with just the slightest bitter edge (part roasty coffee and part chocolate) backbone  M - full bodied and thick, creamy, and warm and remarkably, given everything going on in this beer and the high ABV, it is neither hot or harsh  O - I've been sipping this beer for about an hour and a half as I've worked my way through a single 12 oz bottle. This is definitely a sipping beer, in part because it is so big and boozy, but also because it has so much going on and changes so much as it warms that it rewards taking it slow. It is easy to focus on the coffee, and if it is anywhere near fridge temperature I think that comes out very clearly and early with every taste, and it is also easy to focus on the long warm finish which is where the bourbon dominates and even more so as the beer warms and develops.

1199,19960,ToasterChef,4.78,"A bottle of the 2010 edition of KBS is poured into the center of a tulip glass. It is an opaque dark brown liquid, with a perfect brown foam head. It's not too thick, but has enough heft to give you pause when you look at it and remark ""now that's what a stout should look like!"" Swirling the beer gives the head some strength and coats the walls of the glass with a foamy film that is trying its hardest not to recede.  The aroma is a great mix of coffee and bourbon. Roasty bitterness is quite apparent, but there is also smokiness in the background to remind you of the year this beer spent in close proximity to bourbon-soaked oak.  Tremendous flavor that refuses to admit it's an 11.2% imperial stout. Coffee and vanilla flavors dominate, but neither overpowers. It's not too bitter nor too sweet; both tastes are balanced perfectly. Bourbon notes come into play as I swallow and leave my mouth feeling warm without burning. Even as the bourbon flavor fades, an oakiness remains long after I've swallowed. I don't recall how hot KBS is when fresh, but a year in the cellar has mellowed things out to make it an exceptional beer.  It is certainly a heavy beer and has low carbonation. It is a touch sticky on my lips and does leave a coat behind, but has a viscous feel, like it wants to be swallowed and not cling to your mouth.  KBS is a benchmark in the world of bourbon aged stouts. There is justification to how sought-after this beer is. Do yourself a favor and seek a bottle out. Even better, spring for the entire 4 pack. Drink one fresh and age the remaining three. It will be worth it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,drewba,4.11,"A - Jet black with a great pillowy mocha head. When you move it out in the glass, it has some serious legs and very minimal lacing, but a nice mocha oil slick of a head perks up.  S - vanilla soaked wood, sweet caramel, deep roast, leather, freshly roasted coffee grounds and a fairly assertive alcohol aroma.  T - Lots of dark goodness in here; begins with a hefty roast, caramel and milk chocolate. The flavor quickly progresses to a delicious vanilla character, hints of wood, maple syrup. Bitter expresso, cocoa powder, charred wood wraps up the flavor with a HINT of bourbon still riding through. The bourbon flavor is kind of disappointing, not nearly as much as I remember in years past and certainly not the star of the show. Wish I would have reviewed an 09 fresh so I could give this a 5/5 on taste.  M - the body is syrupy and substantial, but I wish it was a bit bigger. There is a nice subtle carbonation that is there, but isn't reminding me that it's there. What the hell does that even mean...you know what I mean, moving along.

I liked the year old version better  2008 A - Pours a pitch black/brown with a 1/2 inch of tan foam that slowly fades leaving a nice coating or oily lacing 3.5 S - I'm picking up hints of chocolate, some vanilla a bit of the bourbon, I like it though not fully blown away 3.5 T - Really nice taste, the choclate and roasted malts all blend well nicely with the bourbon which brings on a subtle burning at the end. There is some caramel and woody notes that really round this one out nicely. 4 M - Smooth and creamy, it just fills your mouth with silk and it is very enjoyable 4.5 D - 2nd favorite of the three, but I feel like the flavors are starting to go downhill a bit. Still enjoyable, maybe just a bit oxidized. 4  2009 A - Pours a pitch black/brown with a 1/2 inch of tan foam that slowly fades leaving a nice coating or oily lacing 3.5 S - I'm picking up about the same as the 2008 in aroma, but there is a bit of a difference. Not sure if its the bourbon that is a bit stronger in this one. 4 T - The taste is the same as the 2008 but amped up a bit more. The bourbon is more present in flavor but not in heat. The chocolate stands out more as well and the vanilla is there to round it out. There seems to be more of a coffee presence in this one as well. 4.5 M - mouthfeel is about the same for the 2009 with just a bit more of an alcohol burn. slight carbonation as well. 4 D - I think with one year on it, it is perfect for me. I could sip this and be quite happy. 4.5  2010 A - Pours a pitch black/brown with a 1/2 inch of tan foam that slowly fades leaving a nice coating or oily lacing, it seems to be sticking around a little longer than the others. 4 S - Again, the same flavors but a bit more intense, the chocolate stands out more 4 T - This is interesting, the bourbon seems more present while the chocolate and coffee seem more subdued. I'm picking up alot of the wood and vanilla as well, but the chocolate and coffee are not there as much. 4 M - Again, smooth and creamy but even less than the 2009. Its just not as silky and a bit astringent, but all around decent. 4 D - Of the three, I think I find this my least favorite. Time for me to set some more aside. Still very drinkable, but I feel it could use a year in the cellar. 4",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S - HOLY CRAP there is so much going on. Vanilla, Oak, Tobacco, Chocolate and Bitter Coffee all at once. Although theyre all in there, theyre extremely hard to distinguish because theyre all blended so well due to the aging. Simply amazing.  T - The bitterness of coffee and dark dark chocolate come up front with the vanilla, bourbon and smokiness follows it. This is truly remarkable for an 11 percent beer, but the alcohol is not there at all. Not as much chocolate as I would have thought from the smell.  M - Smooth as can be. The fact that this is 11 percent is shocking, and the carbonation helps to cleanse the palate for the bourbon aftertaste.  Notes - This is my first time having this, and I am absolutely blown away.

The bourbon becomes more pronounced as it warms.  T: At first, stale coffee and bourbon with some chocolate. There are also some vanilla notes, presumably from the wood. Initially, the taste is layered, with no one dominating. As it warms, the bourbon becomes more prominent, and the beer takes on a liqueur-like flavor. Even though the chocolate and coffee are restrained, I had to struggle a bit to actually taste the underlying stout. I was worried that this beer would be too sweet, but that wasn't the case.  M: Medium, lightly carbonated. Ordinarily I like stouts to be thicker, but this works.  O: It took me a while to drink a 12 ounce bottle, and one was enough.

Coloring is closer to a very dark brown rather than black. The liquid looks thick like Worchester sauce.  Smell: Initially, the chocolate notes come through followed closely by alcohol.  Taste: Hershey’s chocolate taste, sort of a semi-sweet chocolate but smooth with a dark chocolate aftertaste and some alcohol. It was smoother than I expected given the thick appearance. The chocolate taste is rather quickly replaced with the bourbon barrel and the oak char.  Mouthfeel: Leaves a film coating in the mouth with the bittersweet chocolate residue although it does have a fair amount of carbonation considering the lack of head when pouring.  Overall: Surprisingly smooth beer with a clean taste although heavy on the chocolate, but not overdone. The barrel really comes through on this one.

1199,19960,Lauthaha,4.84,"Beer was served on tap at my local watering hole.  Appearance: Beer was a super dark brown, with a coffee-like muddy vibe. There was minimal if any head by the time it got to me (which can probably be attributed to the higher ABV of the brew), but what was left was a menacingly dark tan ring around the edge of the glass. The only stopping block to perfection was the lack of a head, but that's forgivable given the circumstances.  Smell: Rubbing alcohol, bourbon whiskey, deep-dark chocolate, espresso beans, red wine, thick maltiness. My exact wording from the note was ""Mocha Bourbon Mania.""  Taste/Mouthfeel: Liquor. The beer nearly evaporates off the tongue. Once it settles in, there is a perfect amount of carbonation...the best way I could describe it would be to say ""lava flow"" because it just keeps unfolding layers and layers of flavor on the tongue.

1199,19960,StraightNoChaser,4.65,"Had to go for something special for my 200th review. I had the good fortune of picking up 2 4 packs of 2010 and even more 2011 (well, actually 2009 and 2010 if you count when bottled). Yes, I know this is an extremely hyped beer, this years causing a frenzy even. In my opinion, this is one that that lives up to the hype. appearance: Black, black, black, gorgeous mocha head. smell: Incredibly smooth mocha. Coffee w/o over the top bitterness, chocolate w/o over sweetness, and that buttery barrell aged thing in just the right amount to balance all. taste: again, all this coffee, chocolate, and barrel aged goodness in perfect mellow harmony. This is my second perfect score. Not sure if that's over-use or not but I just can't imagine this beer being any better. Like a great work of art, nothing should be added or taken away.  Update: 4/9/17. '17 Draft from a growler. I'm not quite as nutso for KBS as I was, mainly because I've had so many barrel aged stouts since. BCBS, Parabola, and the Avery big stouts.

Aroma was of slight mocha (even a minute aroma of coffee). Most present was the stout aroma as back-bone but definitely bourbon presence.  I have to review taste and mouthfeel together because, in my opinion, this beer overwhelms both at the same time.

1199,19960,StoutHunter,4.89,"I picked up a bottle of Founders KBS when it was released in March for $4.99 at The Lager Mill. I have wanted to try KBS since the first time I heard about it but I quickly learned that just because Founders is from Michigan doesn't mean we get a large surplus of KBS, so when I just so happen to be at the Lager Mill the day they got their shipment I knew that was a sign I had to get it, my only regret is that I didn't get my 2 bottle limit, oh well you live you learn. I have been keeping this baby in the cellar for a special occasion and now that I am on my 200th review I feel like its a great time to give this beer a try and to celebrate 200 reviews and many more reviews to come. No visible bottling date but I know it's a 2011 vintage. Poured from a short 12oz brown bottle into a snifter. 2014 Edit i aged one for a year and I found out what I already knew this beer is best fresh, but still good when aged.  A- I don't like the label as much as the original Breakfast Stout's label but it's still ok and the mock surgeon general warning is an amusing touch. It poured that usual used motor oil pitch black color that I have come to expect and love in imperial stouts. It had a finger and a half worth of nice mocha colored head that died down to a slightly thick layer that stayed the rest of the time and left some nice looking lacing.  S- If I had to describe the aroma in two words it would have to be chocolate and bourbon. I pick up a nice combination of bourbon, black coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, and some caramel. There was also a slight aroma of alcohol but it wasn't that dominating. This beer has a great aroma that is really complex, theres just a lot of good things going on here. It seems like the vanilla and caramel flavors come out a little more when the brew warms up a little.  T- I thought this beer was going to have a hard time topping the awesome aroma, but after taking a couple sips I can verify that this does indeed live up to the aroma. The first flavors I get are dark chocolate and coffee, then comes that wonderful bourbon flavor that is not too overpowering and it imparts some very nice vanilla and caramel flavors. There is for sure some warmth from the alcohol. but I expect that and it doesn't seem hot to me. On the finish there is a slight coffee bitterness and the aftertaste leaves behind lot of nice bourbon flavors.  M- Smooth and a little sticky with a semi dry finish. It was full bodied but it was on the lighter side for being full bodied and it had a good average amount of carbonation, a little more wouldn't hurt but it isn't necessary.  Overall I think KBS is an excellent Stout and one of the best ones I have ever had. I have always been a big fan of barrel aged beer, but this one takes barrel aging to a new level, I really love how all the subtle flavors of the bourbon came through and they blended with the base breakfast stout nicely. This beer isn't that drinkable, it makes for a nice smooth sipper, but if I had another one it would be hard for me not to drink it. I liked everything about this beer, everything seemed spot on and balanced very well. There is tons of hype surrounding this beer and it lives up to it gracefully, I see why so many people drop what they are doing and rush to the stores to get some before it is all sold out, it's just that damn good. A little part of me was hoping I wouldn't like this beer that much so I wouldn't have to go through the madness each year to get it, but since I like it so damn much, I guess I am just going to have tough it out and scour my city for any available bottle I can find next year, damn you Founders, this must be all part of your master plan. This is a must have for any true beer lover, it's not just a beer it's an experience. This has to be the best beer I have had from Founders and now it has a place as my favorite barrel aged stout to date. I can't say enough good things about Founders, and with beers like this, you don't have to, you just let someone take a sip and watch the smile form on their face. I couldn't think of a better beer to celebrate 200 reviews with, heres to 200 more. 2014 Edit i aged one for a year and I found out what I already knew this beer is best fresh, but still good when aged.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S- Caramel, vanilla, hints of bourbon, alcohol, chocolate, and a few notes of coffee. Smell is very complex and changes as it warms.  T- Chocolate and coffee right away, they are soon displaced with a bourbon note that grows until it dominates the taste. Finish has hints of coffee, chocolate, and vanilla mixed in with the bourbon and some heat from the alcohol. Finish is bone dry and has a lingering taste of bourbon.  M- More that medium in body but not heavy, low in carbonation. Has a creamy and silky feeling on the palate.  O- A sipper to be sure and at 11.2% ABV you are only going to want one or two.

S- Smells good, but seems to be less boozy than last year. Still has a great smell of coffee, bourbon, and booze.  T- Taste is incredible, but seems to be lacking from the 2010 variety. It is flavorful, but doesn't have the bourbon flavor that I remember. It is a very good stout. One of the best. But each bottle I've had so far (10 total) each one tastes very different. The first few were very strong on bourbon, the next were strong on coffee, and the last few have seemed to be more balanced, but weaker in overall flavor. You do get it all though. Bourbon, chocolate, alcohol burn, with a very nice coffee finish.  M- Sticks to the tongue, and stays with you. And thats all the good flavors. I want a stout to stick, and this one does. however, it does feel a little thin when compared to it's appearance.  O- A top notch stout. If I had not tried an 09 BCBS, the batch 1 of the boulevard RIS, and GI Big John from this year, I probably would have rated this A+, but those stouts impressed me in overall quality and flavor, thereby raising the stout bar.

1199,19960,JayQue,4.67,"This one deserves its reputation. I could drink this until I fell down!! Pours a dense dark brown color with no light getting through. Takes a hard pour to get a medium size head, but the head is rich and dark brown in color. Fairly light lacing. OK head retention.  Smell is great. Chocolate, vanilla and coffee expertly blended.  Taste is great as well. None of the flavors stand out. The bourbon barrel flavor is fairly subtle. The coffee, chocolate and malts are more pronounced but they all complement each other in a beautifully blended whole. Very smooth, very nice.  Mouthfeel is rich and smooth. There is an alcohol presence but it is at the back end and not off-putting, just part of the show.  Overall this is a great beer...as enjoyable as The Abyss and probably better. I would drink this one again...any time any place. Outstanding",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,GallowsThief,4.5,"Received in trade from Chugginoil (many thanks as always!).  A – Pours a deep dark ominous black. A fairly heavy handed pour still only produced a small ½ inch of creamy looking tan head. Leaves a nice ring around the glass with a tiny bit of legs.  S – Vanilla, caramel, coffee, dark chocolate and bourbon.  T – Has a nice dark coffee roasted flavor to start. Next up comes up some of the nice vanilla flavor with caramel. It really isn’t sweet but you can certainly get those lingering flavors from it. It also has a nice dark chocolate hint as well with molasses. The bourbon is certainly apparent but not overpowering leading to a great balance.  M – Creamy medium to full bodied. Light carbonation.  O – Hard to not love this. It’s really a wonderful stout, well balanced and not overpowering. Great mix of flavors. If you are a bourbon fan this will be an epic tasting and even if you are not its just subtle enough to make you a fan.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,dookiepower,4.8,"12oz bottle poured into my Bruery tulip  Appearance- with a normal pour KBS yielded a 1 1/2 finger head that had pretty decent retention and lots and lots of lacing on the tulip. It poured motor oil black with a very viscous body that just looked amazing coming out of the bottle. A very great looking beer, almost proud of itself inside the tulip with the mocha colored head.  Smell- I sniffed the bottle right after I opened it and got all coffee. Then once I poured it I sniffed again and got all chocolate. After a few minutes and letting it rise in temperature there was a great dark chocolate and coffee smell that seemed to have a small amount of bourbon and a little heat coming off it. I didn't detect any wood in the smell from the barrel but it was all bourbon if anything that I got from the barrel. Also a nice smoky almost tobacco note was extremely nice. Overall a great smelling beer.  Taste- Wow, a great lead off with a beautiful malty chocolate kick that moved into a deep coffee flavor with a beautiful beautiful bourbon backbone. No detection of alcohol at all over the entire hour that I nursed this baby. As it warmed the chocolate became more pronounce and the coffee subsided, and was replaced with even more marvelous bourbon. In the taste however I can get a bit of oak and vanilla from the barrels, not overpowering but just the right balance to let you know it was bal-aged.  Mouthfeel- going along nicely with the pour the mouthfeel is a nice and thick creamy goodness. It was a very very smooth and full bodied beer that I really loved. If anything I would want just a little bit more viscosity but thats nitpicking. The carb was right on for a stout noticeable but not too much.  Overall- Wow so far my favorite stout. KBS was nothing short of amazing for me. After having a not so great time with Abyss (I'm not a licorice fan) I was hesitant towards big bal-aged stouts, but not anymore. I wish I was closer to Michigan so I could get this goodness every year. What a beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,RodneyX,4.68,"From a bottle. Pours a velvety black with a brown head that didn't leave anything on the sides. It smells of coffee with some barrel, oak, and bourbon. Has a nice roasted character with wood and huge coffee and chocolate. This beer feels and tastes great, can't think of much that could make it better. Glad I was able to get some bottles this year.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,DoubleSimcoe,4.05,"KBS on tap at R'n'H in Manhattan, part of a Founders event there. Tasted side-by-side with CBS, which was dangerous because both beers have very similar looks. My second time trying KBS on tap, after I popped my Kentucky cherry at The Pony Bar in Hell's Kitchen.  Appearance: Served in an eight-ounce wine glass for $12 (fuck!), KBS pours just like CBS. They are twins, only head doesn't last on Kentucky. Lacing and retention here are less than spectacular here. Color is the darkest side of black this side of Africa.  Smell: Not as good as the looks. A little underwhelming, more so compared to CBS. Wood, some distant vanilla. Boozy (but not in a bad way) and then some as it warms up.  Taste: A tad of chocolate and that barrel feel. Sort of a spicy finish, and definitely woodsy and bourbon-y. Hot! Somewhat one-dimensional.  Mouthfeel: Fuller, rounder and more interesting than the bottled version, which I found a lil' thin and disappointing. Super creamy, smooth, chuggable. Prickly booze at the end, though. Very hot and barrel-y when warm. Fittingly low carbonation, full flavor.  Overall: I still think this beer is mighty hyped and overblown. Good? Sure enough. Very good? Yes. Exceptional? Don't think so. I've had better bourbon-aged stouts, and when tasted along with CBS, KBS just doesn't have it. Tap is a better option for it than a bottle, though. Always, very drinkable, smooth, enjoyable. Overall:",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,BarryMFBurton,4.92,"If you told me three months ago that I would review fifty different beers by June, I would have choked on my Busch Light. It’s crazy, but that’s just the way it happened. Anyway, I wanted to do something special for this one (even though, yes, I know that number fifty isn’t all that big of a milestone). And, thanks to 1Adam12, I’m now holding a bottle of Kentucky Breakfast Stout – one of the most beloved American beers ever. Thanks again Adam! You made my first trading experience easy, rewarding, and generally awesome. But enough about us – let’s get to the beer:  A: As soon as the first drops flowed into my tulip, all I could think of was “thick.” It poured very slowly, even more than a lot of beers of this style. In fact, it was so syrupy that my girlfriend asked me what I was drinking. “Is that really beer?” It’s funny, because this is what a lot of dark beers should look like, in my opinion: deep brownish-black, thick as hell, with a small but resilient head. I love the bold first impression.  S: A dark coffee aroma is striking at first, then it blends peacefully into sugary syrup notes. There’s chocolate, toffee, and a little bit of raspberry, even. The finish on the nose is, not surprisingly, bourbon. Oaky, spicy, smoky bourbon. Overall, a wonderful prelude.  T: Oh wow. This is unbelievable. A killer upfront bitterness throttles everything I know about dark, aged beer. It’s perfect for a hophead like me. The hops are solidly grounded in a combination of yeast so earthy that it gives the entire palate a rustic footing. Coffee and chocolate grow, as expected, from the dark expanse of the body, with some caramel in between. Great execution – very well balanced. The best part, though, is when the bourbon comes in. I really can’t think of any other word but “fantastic.” It’s deep, warming, peppery, and woody. It’s never artificial or out-of-place in the palate. The finish brings back that tart raspberry from the nose, coupling with the dryness of everything else to present a satisfying aftertaste that begs for more of the same. This is an experience that will be hard to match. Nothing short of incredible.  M: Rich, creamy, thick. This works very well with the palate. However, there is some fizzy carbonation (which seems to be a trademark of Founders) that makes the body just a hair light on occasion. Everything else, though, is golden.  O: Four words: This. Beer. Is. Epic. I’m glad that I waited for review number fifty to check this one out, because now I can really appreciate how exceedingly complex and satisfying it is. Without a doubt, this has been one of my favorite beer experiences ever. Next year I’m grabbing a case.  I’m so glad that Founders has such high standards. This is the kind of beer that gets me excited to go to the bottle shop. This is kind of beer that puts a smile on my face when I think of my future experiences. And this is the kind of beer that makes me proud to be a part of the craft community.  Here’s to fifty more like KBS!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,mjtiernan,4.28,"Got this from a trade with heyta…thanks heyta!  2011 12oz bottle into a Jester King snifter  I did this review as a side-by-side tasting with an ’09 BCBS  A – Black as night with an oily film on top. Only sign of carbonation is the tiniest ring of bubbles along the outside of the glass. A vigorous swirl brings a bit of life to the head.  S – Chocolate cream pie served with Irish coffee and a freshly rolled unlit cigarette on the side of the plate. Nice!  T – Bittersweet chocolate is dominant. I’m so glad this isn’t yet another too sweet chocolate stout. The coffee and tobacco shows up long enough to wave hello before giving way to the most excellent bourbon and oak. Not getting as much vanilla from the oak as I usually find with other barrel aged beers. Possibly the most balanced -bal beer I've ever consumed.  Hang on, I tasted this so many times that I need to get more to finish the review.  M - Not a surprise, but there isn’t much carbonation to speak of. Can’t believe how smooth this is though. Not as oily as I expected based on the appearance, which was nice. The bourbon really comes out in the finish but isn’t even close to being too hot…and this is a relatively fresh one.  O – I poured myself appx 4oz to do this review and had to go back for seconds before I was finished. So much going on with this one. Not sure if I will end up preferring this one fresh or with some age on it, but I’ve got a second bottle so I’ll find out eventually. Really loved it!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Agold,4.45,"What an exceptional beer. This has been on the list of beers I've been wanting to try since the second I heard about it. Founders has continued to not disappoint with their offerings.  It pours beautifully with a short dense light brown head. It holds onto a nice little film of foam which leaves lacing down the side of the glass. Really exceptional aroma. Huge coffee notes, with mild mocha chocolate and light bourbon in the background. The taste is the same, with a mild pleasant alcohol burn. It is chocolate, coffee, creamy, and a very small dash of bourbon to add character. As a matter of fact, I was expecting a bit more of the bourbon -bal or oak in here, as i thought a touch more vanilla would be really nice with the other flavors. As such, it is extraordinarily balanced. The mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied. Really happy with founders on this beer. Delicious beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,s1ckboy,4.65,Bottle poured into a snifter. Very strong nose of oak. Taste is a good balance between coffee chocolate and bourbon.

Very Good!,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,JayS2629,4.79,"Absolutely amazing. I traded some Mad Elf for this and it was well worth it. Best stout I've had to date. Complex and very well balanced.  The pour produced a solid thick motor oil black that had a creamy tan head with moderate retention and sea foam lace. The smell was intoxicating with oak, smoke, and bourbon blending into roasted malts, chocolate, and robust coffee. The taste was a robust coffee, roasted malts, dark chocolate with a perfectly blended woody, oak and bourbon. The sweet bourbon flavor blended into tones of rich caramel sweetness and balanced with robust coffee with hints of vanilla.  The most impressive thing about this beer was how the complex flavors blended and complimented each other. The deep robust coffee lended a bitterness against a sweet caramel and bourbon smoothness. Nothing overpowered or dominated. Great chocolate undertones and smokey, woody notes finished it into a superb and mellow drink. It was creamy and full bodied. This is a beer to be sipped and savored. The bourbon flavor lends a sweetness and the booze burn was subtle and blended. Awesome beer!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,GoldenVIKE,4.61,"Thanks to JRod1969 for this beer!  A- pours thick like motor oil; pour it HARD and you'll get a nice 1/2 finger copper-colored head that will quickly dissipate into a ring. Nice. Otherwise beer is pitch black and no light is getting through it!  S- The first smell that hits you is a STRONG smell of bitter dark chocolate, closely followed by bourbon. Subtle hints of vanilla, molasses, and a bit of cherry perhaps. Superb.  T- In the mouth it's the bourbon that grabs you first. It's got a bitter, smoky bite. Not too much though--perfect balance of the stout and bourbon flavors. Chocolate, molasses, and mocha are present as it goes down. Strong warming sensation, but the alcohol doesn't overwhelm even though it's over 11% ABV. NOTE: drink this warm and possibly even decant it. I made a mistake of putting it in the fridge for a little too long the first time I had it. It's still good cold, but much better as it warms.  M- Very heavy and good carbonation for a stout.

A very robust smell that is balanced by a nice sweetness. Very good. They should make candles that smell like this.  T- Same as the smell. Bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, molasses, coffee, and slight smokiness. Dont really know where the 70 IBU's are in this one. Not getting much bitterness at all except a slight bitterness from the dark chocolate/coffee. Alcohol is present for sure but works great with the beer. Definitely a slow sipper and one that should be savored. The warmth feels very nice also. For Breakfast? No. For a cold winter night? Hell yeah!! Give me a couple of these and I'll sleep like a baby. So good you wanna slap your mama! haha. The tastes in this beer work so well with each other. I wish I had a couple 4 packs of this to age because I believe this would be excellent with a year or two on it.

The first time I had this beer, I got only the strong strong coffee taste out of it. However, as I grew in my tastes, I got a much more blended taste of coffee, a little sweet, some good alcohol burn, and a great beer.

1199,19960,sommersb,4.97,"My 100th review on BA, on my 1 year BA anniversary!  Served in a Founders tulip/snifter, from a bottle dated 02/25/11.  Appearance: Black, opaque color with only a slight reddish tint on the edges. Head is creamy and tan, about a finger high. Not a lot of lacing on this one, but not a surprise.  Smell: Very nice, rich aromas of dark roasted malts and coffee. Can definitely pick up the wood (oak) smells, as well as the bourbon and alcohol. Slight sweetness in the aroma, rounded out by vanilla.  Taste: Complex flavors are mixed well - the roasted malts and dark coffee, the bourbon, and chocolate. The thing that makes this so special is how well balanced it is. You definitely get the alcohol from the barrel aging, but it doesn't overpower the stout as I've tasted in other similar styles.  Mouthfeel: Wonderful, creamy texture on a full body. Carbonation is medium. Aftertaste is of roasted malts, coffee and bourbon.  Overall: Superb barrel-aged imperial stout! I had two from the 2011 bottling and will eagerly look for this again.

Smell is very intense, aromas of coffee, raisins, caramel, semi sweet chocolate, and plums. Taste is rich and complex, with flavors of roasted coffee, dark chocolate, dates, raisins, plums, caramel, oak aging, and lemon zest. Warning, the demon alcohol, which is masked by the wonder flavors, comes like a thief in the night and hits you the side of the head...wow. Mouthfeel is velvet cream, moderate zing, and a slight dry feeling in my soft palate. A touch of maple syrup aftertaste lingers in the back of my hard palate.

Immediately taste the chocolate notes, followed by a sweet bourbon, and a little overwhelming alcohol warmth. Not picking up any coffee.  M - full bodied. A little syrupy. Would prefer a little more carbonation.  Overall - I feel these big beers win ratings for alcohol content. The alcohol is a bit too much. Though it may mellow out with aging. I've been getting into single malts and small batch bourbons/whiskeys. Barrel aged beers tend to be too reminiscent of sweeter low quality whiskeys. I was attracted to this beer for the time and care listed in it's preparation. I would try it again, but am glad I only got a bottle for now at $6/bottle in NYC.

1199,19960,CFHMagnet,4.65,"A. A vigorous pour left me with a half finger of light brown head that quickly retreated to little more than a ring around the glass. This beer is such a dark brown into black color, I imagine it is something like a black hole, in that no light that enters this beer will escape it. Very light delicate lacing throughout.  S. I first smell the chocolate and coffee, but these are quickly overtaken by the strong aroma of bourbon. After the bourbon hits my nose, nothing else is apparent.  T. I'm first struck by roasted maltiness, and this quickly flows into the chocolate and coffee flavors. Bourbon follows this up, and the beer finishes with a big oak taste that seems to be complimented by bitterness.  M. Heavy bodied to be sure, not as creamy as expected, but that does not detract from this beer. Has the perfect amount of carbonation and ends with a lovely alcohol burn in the back of the throat.  O. This is a beer to savor and remember, I wouldn't have more than one of these in a sitting as the supply isn't abundant enough for me to want to just drink them away.

This is the only vintage I've tried but I imagine the previous batches were similar. Alcohol is pretty muted (at least to me) I can taste the oak but for the most part it is pure coffee and malt.

1199,19960,jbertsch,4.65,"Poured into a snifter.  Appears black (surprise, surprise) with a tan head that fades to a film. Minor lacing. Leaves more of an oily coating on the glass when you swirl, not so much a sticky lace - but this is expected for this beer given it's ABV and the bourbon.  Aroma of coffee, bourbon, coca, and a little metallic.  Tastes like creamy mocha with notes of caramel, chocolate, and molasses. An alcohol bite lays over everything. The aftertaste showcases bourbon heat and the flavor of dark coffee grinds.  Meadium-to-heavy body (more on the medium side) with a slick, oily mouthfeel.  This tastes like the people who make Baileys Irish Cream made this. You have to like bourbon to like this, though the bourbon isn’t overpowering…it just takes this “beer” into almost non-beer territory…with flying colors.

1199,19960,LaCoursiere,4.03,"On tap @ Mackenzie's for MN Craft Beer Week  A - A 10oz pour served in a beer flute. It arrived with a one-finger dark brown head on top of pitch black night. The head dissipated slowly to a few patches and thin collar. A little bit of lacing was produced when swirled.  S - Roasted malts and hot cocoa w/ marshmallows spiked with a healthy shot of bourbon.  T - Tasted roasted malts and coffee up front fading to cocoa and molasses sweetness in the middle. This gives way to a finish of boozy bourbon flavor with oak and leather notes. At the end the bourbon breaks up leaving an interesting hint of cinnamon/brown sugar sweetness.  M - Medium-heavy body with light carbonation without being syrupy or chewy, yet not particularly smooth either. There is generous alcohol warmth.  O/D - This is a bourbon bomb. The bourbon is the dominant characteristic in the flavor profile. I would have liked a bit more depth of flavor in the beginning taste notes to balance out the strong bourbon character that comes after. But that's being picky.

1199,19960,LiquidCucumber,4.62,"2011 vintage for a cold, rainy night in May.  A - Dark as night. Pours with a thick but small tan head.  S - Sweet malts and bourbon with a touch of oak. A roasty scent coming from the coffee and chocolate as well.  T- Coffee and bourbon right up front. Melts into chocolate and vanilla as well as some sweet prune. Quite a bit of booze and a hint of oak.  M - Lighter than expected yet still full bodied. Unlike many other bourbon-barreled beers this one doesn't leave an excessive film all over your mouth  O - Tasty and indeed one of the tastiest of the style. Founders makes many of the best beers around and this is a prime example.  Update 2013 I did not get to sample 2012, so here's a little update on the 2013 batch:  Getting a lot more coffee in the aroma than before. Lots of chocolate and bourbon too. Super-smooth and velvety, like their porter and Imperial Stout. So much chocolate and bourbon come through in the flavor, I am surprised that the coffee isn't as pronounced as the aroma. This beer is so nice I wish I could get a four-pack like I did in 2011...",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Devi0us,2.97,"Let me start off by saying ""Letdown""...had this as part of our Blind Epic Beer Tasting Event and it took a unaminous LAST Place overall. List included 2010 Darklord, Rare Bourbon County Stout, 2011 KBS, 2011 Hunahpu, 2010 Abyss.  A- Pours pitch black like old motor oil with a minimal tan head that disappears rather quickly. Very thick with decent carbonation.   S- This is where it got me. Had a very Musty smell to it. I've smelled plenty of barrel aged brews and this smell is one that I was not familiar with.  T- Taste was bland and left a dry mouthfeel for me but got a little better as it warmed up. Did not expect it to be this bland. Alcohol was undetectable and very well hidden.  M- Mouthfeel is dry and bland. Light carbonation.   O- Overall, this was the biggest disappointment of the day. I had a hard time finishing this brew. A bad batch perhaps? Trying this brew again is a MUST. With all the hype surrounding this beer, it has to be better. This was the hardest beer to obtain and was the biggest letdown.

1199,19960,ArrogantB,4,"Got this 2011 in a recent trade with Jedwards, thanks man! Dark black color with a bit of a brown head. Smells like really good coffee to me, nice. The flavor was also really good coffee, not overwhelming, a hint of booze but the alcohol was well hidden. Overall I can see why people like this beer so much but given the price and availability I don;t really have any incentive to get this again.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,cakennedy2006,4.26,"My first official review. Just received this 2011 vintage of Founders KBS today; paid $8.99 per single 12oz. After tax its $40 a four pack! Better be worth the hype. A- Pours a very thick black with a slight brown head that doesn't stick around long at all.  S- The first scent I pick up is a bourbon and ""boozy"" smell, followed by chocolate. Wow, its as if I'm smelling a chocolate liqueur with a strong bourbon note!  T- Okay, not as boozy as I expected from the smell but the bourbon flavor has a strong presence. Following the bourbon I taste cocoa or dark chocolate. I'm finding it hard to break past the dominant bourbon flavor (maybe this mellows with age??). The closer to the bottom of my glass and the warmer it gets I can pick out some vanilla notes. Isn't this suppose to be brewed with coffee?? If so, it's a minority in this pool of bourbon chocolate.  M- Full Body, light carbonation, and goes down very smooth for a beer with an abv of 11.2% You wouldn't guess by the smell but the alcohol stays pretty well hidden throughout.  O- Considering the abv this is very drinkable and very smooth. I can't say I'm a huge fan of the bourbon flavor but if I was this would be the perfect brew! I'm very glad I came across this one; just not too happy about the price I paid for it ( $40 a 4 pack!?) I highly recommend this to any bourbon barrel-aged stout lovers, still a must try even if not. Can't wait to age and compare this one!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,OddNotion,4.05,"After driving roughly one hundred miles and calling many many stores to track down just three bottles of this spending $21 for them the day it became available in NJ I finally have this beer. With all of this time and effort I was hoping this would be one of the best beers I ever had. I cracked on that night and was a little let down. I decided to not review it, and try it again a few months later away from all the stress and hype.  Poured into my Fantome tulip.  Appearance: Pours a pitch black with a one quarter finger dark tan head. The head sticks around for a little bit.  Smell: One of the most complex smells I have ever experienced in a beer. Chocolate first followed by coffee, vanilla, oak, and then bourbon. Slight booziness is detectible upon a deep inhalation.  Taste: Very complex, yet confusing. When the beer first hits my tongue I get chocolate which quickly turns to oak. At the end of the sip the coffee flavor sticks to the tongue after the beer is gone. As the coffee fades it turns to a vanilla oakiness. Some bourbon is detectible but is well integrated into the beer and it is not overpowering in a bad way at all. For 11.2% it is not overly boozy, but the alcohol certainly is present. Bourbon is much more noticable as the beer warms up, kind of becomes a bourbon bomb.  Mouthfeel: Pretty thick but not nearly the thickest I have had. So I would still call it full bodied, a little more carbonation than expected for how big the beer is.  Overall: Good? Yes. Amazing? I am not sure I would go that far. Given the hype, the insane ratings, the high price, and the insane measures gone through to get it, I was hoping for one of the best beers ever. Instead I was met with a very strong flavored and bold beer that did not quite pull it all together as I hoped it would. I feel like it will do great with some age. Dont get me wrong, I enjoyed the beer, but given all the other factors it did not leave me one hundred percent satisfied. Not worth the insane hype around it. I will certainly drink it again and wouldnt mind trading for it in the future but I will not go through extensive measures to acquire it again.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,nataku00,4.08,"A 2011 release bottle, lightly chilled to around 55°F, poured into a tulip glass. Thanks to mtunnell for providing a '11 and a '10 bottle to me in our trade!  Beer pours pitch black with a half a finger of brown milk chocolate colored small bubble head with a vigorous pour. Head dissipates quickly, leaving some light lacing. Swirling shows a bit of alcohol feet sticking to the glass edge. Some carbonation is visible at the edge of the glass when swirling the beer lightly.  The bourbon was very apparent as soon I popped the cap on the bottle. Bourbon overshadows the rest of the flavor notes on the nose, bit of charred oak, burnt sugar, milk chocolate, dark roasted malt, and fruity coffee. A bit too much bourbon on the nose though, but it somewhat makes sense since this is a fresh bottle. As the beer sits, the aroma is weaker than I would have expected from a beer like this.  Very strong bourbon on the tongue, vanilla, caramel, oak, dark fruits, prunes mainly. The stout is somewhat backseat to the barrel treatment, but there's milk chocolate, roasted malt a hint of coffee, some floral hop bitterness. Lots of alcohol warmth in the mouth and the throat. Finish is mostly clean, maybe some bourbon vanilla and oak notes.  Medium body with some good small bubble carbonation to move the flavors along. Definitely a slow sipper with the alcohol making this burn a bit. At this point, this really is a bourbon lover's type of beer, but I would like more of the beer to come through. Curious if I should open the '10 bottle soon and see how it compares.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,jcartamdg,4.92,"Poured a 2010 bottle into my bruery tulip. Dark black with a 1finger mocha head that dissipates quickly. Nice lacing that clings to the glass like its glue. Aroma is coffee malt and light bourbon. I thought coffee fades out of beers quickly, I guess the coffee in KBS doesn't follow the rules. Man this beer tastes smooth, it follows the nose but is more balanced with a year on it, less hot and booze. I like it fresh but I love it with a year on it.

1199,19960,gaugebozo,4.76,"2011 batch, drank in May. Served in a small glass (totally not appropriate for beer :) ).  Appearance - Opaque black with chocolate foam. Very lacy foam on the glass while drinking.  Smell - Chocolate, bourbon, and light alcohol.  Taste - WOW. So complex! Chocolate malt milkshake, coffee/vanilla, then boozy bourbon (hardcore) all with plenty of roast. Not my favorite type, but hands down the best beer I've ever drank. Can't taste the hops, but they have to be there to balance the sweetness.  Mouthfeel - Thick and milky. The foam is even milk-shakey.  Overall - This beer is amazing. Easily the best beer I've drank, though I have other favorite types. If you like these flavors, you have to try this. It's never appropriate to pay some of the prices I've seen for it or any beer, ($60 a 4 pack?

Traces of vanilla and mellow molasses float in the background. Also present are light woody texture that add character to the nose.

1199,19960,DCon,4.67,"Enjoyed on-tap @ the iTap House in Chesterfield, MO. Served into a Snifter, had a 11.2% logo on the wooden sign, and enjoyed only 1. (This was limited and was on-tap for the KBS vs Goose Island Event @ iTap).  Appearance- Received with a a great, dark looking brown body color and a deep brown, 2 finger head. Great bubbly head and retention long lived.  Smell- WOW! Huge roasted Espresso Coffee smell, Cappucino, and Hazelnut in the background. Can smell huge Coffee Bean from even a distance! How is this possible? Great! There also is a hint of vanilla tobacco smoke (in my pipe now), in the background.  Taste- Nice taste from the beginning but VERY strong. Starts off with huge coffee and espresso taste. It is great in the category of coffee stouts but then kicks it up with the Imperial Stout Style and has an additional alcohol/strong flavor. There are also hints of hazelnut, vanilla, and chocolate in the background (Late Moreno anyone?). Has a wood/bourbon taste in the background.  Mouthfeel- Full Bodied, Nice Carbonation (appropriate), and has a smooth finish. My teeth and tongue feel like they just had an espresso shot... Gritty and coffee breathe. Awesome characteristics!  Overall- Impressive! Can't believe this is my first time having this one! It seems like there is a bourbon additional flavor here like the Dragon's Milk by New Holland OR it was aged in bourbon barrels. The drinkability is low (which is why I gave it a low score towards the Overall category), but still is enjoyable!

Its pitch black and in the low lighting that is my apartment there is no chance of seeing through this one.  Aroma: Upon taking the first whiff I thought I heard and saw trumpets sounding and light emanating from the glass. This is a truly sublime smelling beer. This is without a doubt the perfect blend of vanilla, coffee, bourbon, chocolate, and subtle fruity esters that I have ever experienced.  Taste: It took me a while to finally take the first sip because I was too busy enjoying the aroma bursting through the rim of my glass. Upon my first sip I realize that I shouldn’t have waited so long and fall into an unconsciousness serenity. Amazing balance of coffee, oak, bourbon, sweet molasses, chocolate, and a slight boozy finish are the flavor profile I can discern.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation that only tingles and awakens your taste buds. Silky smooth and very easy to drink, almost too easy, I had to force myself to slow down and enjoy it.  Overall: This is an incredible beer! There is no doubt that next year I will attempt to trade for at least a 4 pack. Truly world class, one of the best beers I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying.

1199,19960,ryan1788a5,4.54,"12oz bottle poured into a New Belgium globe.  A: Pours the deepest, darkest black. One inch brown head dissipates quickly and leaves very thin lacing.  S: French roast coffee, oak, strong creamy vanilla presence, cocoa powder, and bourbon. Absolutely delicious, complex but not complicated. Each aroma is quite distinct and easy to pick out, yet still blends seamlessly with the rest. Maybe the best smelling beer I've ever come across.  T: Oak and a slight hint of bourbon open. Tangy plum darkfruit registers for just an instant. A second wave woody oak is accompanied by softer barrel flavors of cream and vanilla. Tastes of chocolate are constantly shifting between milk chocolate, cocoa powder, and bitter dark chocolate. Herbal tobacco leaf tastes accentuate the spicy, peppery bourbon notes. Whiskey flavors begin to build in intensity. Acidic coffee tastes emerge just before the finish. Finishes on the sweet side with a beautiful marriage of coffee, chocolate, and woody bourbon.  M: Medium bodied, but delightfully velvety and creamy in the mouth. Low carbonation. Heat from the bourbon and high abv is there, but kept well enough in check.  O: A truly exceptional beer. This has always been one of my all-time favorites.  Notes: No true beer geek can really pick a favorite beer, but if you put a gun to my head, I might have to pick this one. I'm a sucker for a great bourbon barrel aged stout, and this one is king. Mouth watering in taste and smell, and very complex. Now, having said all of that, this year's release seemed a little different than past iterations. The mouthfeel seems a bit thinner than I remember, and the bourbon flavors were a bit more dominant, though I didn't feel that they ever became too hot.

Bourbon character has died down since the last taste I had soon after this years release, but it is still strong. Light oak.  Bitter coffee, chocolate, and dark roasted malts come to the front, only to be quickly upstaged by a strong bourbon kick. The more it warms up, vanilla and oak surface, followed by a peppery spice.

It smelled like i jammed a bottle of jack up my nose. Then, the stout smells started to trickle in. The smell is outrageously good.  Complex, and so incredible. The bourbon is so present, and almost too much, but JUST mellow enough for it to avoid being completely overbearing. The chocolate and coffee notes seep through. This is so well crafted.

What you DO care about... is that this is the 2011 KBS... one bottle, overpriced, but worth the tick since I seemed to have lost my 2010 review somewhere. Poured into a snifter purchased on DLD and consumed and reviewed simultaneously.  A- Nothing amazing about the looks. Solid lacing, inky darkness, you know the drill. Not disappointed, not impressed.  S - Strong roasted coffee hits. It morphs quickly to be laced vanilla and burnt grain. Not acrid, but amazing. It is truly a nice mixture of heavy burnt and charred with a light roastiness to the back end. Fresh ground coffee comes close to this. It has some sharpness, but not like other bourbon barrel beers. Its more tangy dark fruits rather than spirits. The bourbon gives it a nice molasses backbone that is too faint. I want more of that. The vanilla at least is present throughout and at an adequate amount.  T- Here is a shock. Nothing like I was expecting from the nose. First thoughts are acrid sharp burnt grains. Than a wave of heat, bourbon, alcohol comes pounding through. Sharp, prickly, and pointed. Not overwhelming, well done. There is something missing though.  The opening stages of roast, grain, and sweet dark fruits are gone in seconds while the bourbon layer sticks around for the entirety of the liquid and even into the finish. As it warms, the bourbon layer has a nice sweetness of molasses more apparent. Hints of brown sugar and heavy syrupy nature sweetness.  Finish is ethanolic, hot, sharp. There is some roasted nature and acrid characteristic that outlasts the bourbon. Sometimes some cocoa that makes it an amazing experience.. however it is a minor occurrence when I want it all the time. Starts to turn paper-y and cellulosic. Very interesting.  M- Full bodied, creamy, a bit hot and sharp. Sticky for sure to a T. Breadbasket full, whew. Overbearing if you aren't careful. Needs to cut itself back in the bourbon and work it in somehow. Turns into this crazy bourbon mess if you aren't sure of what you are doing.  O- All of the problems really bring it down overall.

The barrel is evident, but tannins are smooth and well integrated, especially for a barrel aged beer so young. Somewhat sweet, but never cloying. Absurdly drinkable for 11%.

1199,19960,beavers,4.75,"Bottle from 2011  Pours a thick and oily jet black. Coffee brown head that dissipates quickly and leaves a ring of small bubbles around the edge.  Nose is bourbon mocha truffle with woody vanilla undertones. Charred oak. A little soy-sauce and a alcohol tinge. Roasty qualities (chocolate, coffee) become more pronounced with warming/oxidation. Same with alcohol.  Flavors of bitter chocolate, roast coffee and toasted tannic wood are contrasted with caramelized sugar, vanilla bean, and sweet bourbon. This is the epitome of bourbon barrel integration.  Mouthfeel is dense and oily but the bourbon/alcohol meets moderate carbonation to cut through this enough to leave you wanting another sip.  I'm looking for some level of balance in a beer, and then there is a beer like KBS that achieves this in showboat-like fashion. You don't typically get contrast/balance like this in imperial stouts and this makes it remarkably drinkable relative to the style.

S: Bourbon and coffee to start with, with some chocolate on the back end if you inhale long enough (try it, it's fun). Evolves over time into more chocolate, oak, and vanillin/spice from the oak barrels as it warms.  T: Strong in the coffee and chocolate, with some cocoa, oak and a hint of smokiness on the finish. Great balance. If I had any complaint, it would be that the oak/tannins come through a little much as it warms.  M: Medium bodied, not as much presence as I was expecting. Carbonation is good.  O: The aroma and flavors are definitely top notch. A little heat is noticeable. Even though I complain about the lack of heft/presence above, the medium body makes this exceptionally drinkable if you're going to tackle the entire bottle yourself.

The head recedes to a nice brown ring.  S: Cofee backed with sweet bourbon notes, vanilla and bittersweet chocolate. Caramel and toffee notes mix with the sweetness, with whiffs of alcohol. Suprisingly balanced smelling.  T: Lots here; chocolate, vanilla, oak, molasses, coffee, bourbon, nutmeg. Lots of underlying roasted malts, with caramel and toffee notes mixed in. So sweet and smooth. There is a touch of alcohol burn initially but as this beer warms up the booziness kind of takes hold. Still good though.  MF: Full bodied and creamy. The alcohol cuts the mouthfeel a little.  O: Its extremely well balanced initially, especially since its hard to find beers where the fresh coffee characters don't overwhelm everything else. This beer delivers, and while I would like a touch less booze, the cellar should take the edge off.  Great beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,cpmichael,4.67,"I can't believe I have yet to review this, probably had this over 20 times with a variety of aged selections. This is based off of a 2011 from this past weekend.  A Pours a nice jet black, with about 1 finger tan mocha colored head. Good retention.  S: Smells of coffee beans, roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla and oak with a touch of bourbon.  T: The coffee is upfront, but does not dominate instead it leads to the baker's chocolate, vanilla and oak, and the bourbon, which is subtle, but noticeably there.  M/D: Big bodied, medium carbonation, not overly thick or syrupy. Very well balanced and crafted.  This beer is fantastic either fresh, or aged for a year or two. It is always hard to keep my hands off them.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,deleted_user_574223,4.32,"I opened this 2011 KBS only beause I have 2 more aging in the basement for future tasting. I poured the KBS into a snifter at about 56 degrees.  The initial pour was inky black and viscous with a slight thin reddish brown head. I also noticed a nice syrupy cling along the side of the glass.  The nose is heay coffee with notes of vanilla coming through.  The taste is malt and coffee followed by a pleasant vanilla and mildly bitter finish.  The mouthfeel is thick and oily, exactly what I like in a stout.  Overall this is one fine example of a breakfast stout and I look forward to seeing how this fine stout ages in the upcoming year or two. Enjoy!!!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,pburland23,4.8,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter.  Beer pours a dark, dense black. No light escapes when held up to a lamp. Pitch black. A thin wispy layer of brown head appeared and quickly dissipated...not surprising from a stout.  Smell is dominated by dark chocolate, a touch of bitter coffee, bourbon and a faint hint of woodiness. There's a lot going on in the nose of this beer. Quite complex and aromatic.  Taste starts off with the traditional flavors of a stout including roasted malts and a touch of coffee and chocolate. As the sips progresses, the sweetness of bourbon (vanilla and oak) trickles in and provides balance to the malt, coffee and chocolate. I really expected the bourbon sweetness to absolutely dominate the flavor. I'm quite pleased that Founders used bourbon as a complimentary player to the stout rather than making it the star of the show. It's that kind of sophistication in brewing that makes KBS a world class beer.  THe mouthfeel is thick and oily. As expected with a big stout, there isn't a lot of carbonation, but what is there works well. For an 11.2% beer, this one is a dangerous beer as the alcohol is cloaked so incredibly well, it's not even funny.  Overall, an exceptional beer. Sophisticated, complex and delicious. Glad I got a chance to enjoy one of these.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I love how the beers flavors transition from one to another in an ordinal fashion like it knows exactly when each flavor has its time and is never lost. alcohol is slight and warming. Divine, at dessert time while others are grabbing their cheesecakes and brownies, i'll be reaching for this amazing brew. No need to even refrigerate great at room temp.  M - Flows onto the palate coating everything with its full body, slick and no carbonation is present or wanted. this is the feel that you want from this style, its like it swarms over your entire palate in a protection form daring anything to penetrate.  O - if i were to ever move to Michigan all would be ok because of this beer, bottom line. all the hype is always annoying to me for any brew and it causes me to become extremely critical daring it to stand its ground.

1199,19960,twiggamortis420,4.59,"12 oz bottle right at about 1-year old. Drank the other one I was lucky enough to get fresh last year. Pours viscous and black with some brown foam.  Nose is better than I remember with layers of chocolate, roast, toasted coconut, bourbon and vanilla-oak. Very nice.  Taste is smooth and oaky with a fair amount of bourbon. Mildly sweet, just about right for me. Light raisiny fruitiness adds some complexity. Coffee has died down quite a bit, as has the heat - bit of a tradeoff I suppose. I like this better at one year old than fresh. Much smoother and well integrated...a delicious beverage to be sure. I would seek this out again, no doubt. Although I must say (probably in the minority) that I enjoy the standard Breakfast Stout more than this.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,eric5bellies,4.6,"Thanks to drez77 for trading me this one.  Drank from my St Sixtus vintage chalice.  A - Pours a deep ebony colour with a nice dark tanned head that reduced quite quickly, but laced.  S - Heaps of wooded bourbon aromas and some chocolate liquer very much present, also some nice vanilla and coffe aromas.  T - Oh man this is so damn good, Up front there are some creamy vanilla notes, that are follwed by a burst of milkc hocolate before settling into a nice boozy bourbon barrel flavour. The finish is all whiskey barrel and so very well balanced.  M - Full body and low to medium carbonation that makes for a very smooth brew  O - A monster of a stout and the best that I have tried to date.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,youradhere,3.73,"Pours oily black, no head but a dark tan lacing exists from which I can infer what a head would look like on this. Smell is complex; tootsie roll chocolate, coffee, green pepper like vegitation, vanilla. Taste is complex as well; chocolate, slight coffee, greenbeans, just the right amount of a hint of bourbon (not overwhelming like Backwoods Bastard), vanilla, roasted malt. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, just chewy enough without going overboard, not so thin as to allow the bourbon and alcohol flavors to be too brash; drinkability is good, I can already feel the latent alcohol burn and I'm a quarter way through the glass. Definitely a decent stout but not really worth the hype.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,mjw1200,4.63,"Dark very small lighter brown top.  The smell is impressive. Vanilla from the bourbon, coffee, you know you are getting something special just from the smell.  The taste is what sets this apart from everything. Bourbon is right up front. Espresso in the end, chocolate, maybe some caramel, lots of coffee.  alcohol is hidden most of the time, but becomes very prevalent at the bottom of the beer.

A- Pours a beautiful oily black hue into the glass with a fantastic dark tan head that slowly dissolves with a gorgeous lacing.  S- Sweet bourbon and chocolate hit me up front. Oak notes come through as well. Glorious and well integrated. As it warms, faint coffee and a stronger bourbon characteristic come through. I could smell this all day.  T- Easily the best part of this beer. Bourbon and vanilla at the start, but very subtle and mellowed. Followed closely by a chocolate presence and then more bourbon-laced vanilla in the finish. Not a trace of alcohol to be found. Absolutely fantastic.  M- A little light on the carbonation, but makes up for it in its insane smooth and creamy feel.  O- Easily one of the best barrel-aged beers I've had, and does not disappoint in its complexity and well-integrated flavors. A very hyped up yearly release that delivers in every way.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Dubbledown,4.87,"Poured into a Guinness pint glass. Color black, 1-1/2 inch head; chocolatey beige. The smell is overwhelmingly complex -- strong alcohol, molasses, whiskey, coffee, chocolate, burnt sugar and much more. Mouthfeel big and oily -- pancake and syrup explosion in your mouth. It really is a Kentucky Breakfast Stout. First swallow sits in the pit of the stomach like a shot of bourbon. This is a very serious beer. It delivers a warming effect; more intense and, for me, more pleasant than even the best winter warmer. Not a totally unique brew, since Uncle Backwoods Bastard lives right up the holler, but still gets my highest recommendation.

N- Very nice: dark chocolate ganache, plums, dates, spiced rum, vanilla extract.  T- Intense milk chocolate, cocoa, mellowed out roast and heavy coffee. Bourbon, oak, vanillin are muted and soft.  P- Rich, oily, soft, ending fairly dry.  355mL 2009 ed.  A- Head formation is still not spectacular. Weak lace.  N- Soft butterscotch, buttery bourbon quickly devolve into rubbing alcohol.  T- Soft up front with rich bourbon and coconut oil. Moves in the mid and finish to tannic oak, drying chalk, sort of like over oaked red wine.  P- Silky for a moment but ends chalky and dry.

S- Initial smell is of chocolate and coffee, more chocolate though.  T- Whoa! What a ride on that first sip. Chocolate, coffee, with the end being a cool blast of vanilla and bourbon. The bourbon is not over powering like some bourbon barrel aged beers come off. It seems of those four flavors each one bounces around as the predominant one with each sip, always keeping you guessing. I like that.  M- Syrupy but not too much so. Smooth, low carbonation.

1199,19960,CashMoneyVagrant,4.57,"- 2011 Vintage, served at cellar temp.  Pours with a nice milk chocolate color head of foam. Black, motor oil in appearance. Looks very velvety, and full-bodied in the glass. Foam has dropped down considerably now. Vanilla and bourbon are the first things I pick up on the nose. Behind that I get rich dark chocolate, or baker's bittersweet chocolate. Sweet, burnt, heavily roasted malts. Fresh ground dark roast coffee, a little earthy. Rich chocolate cake or mousse, dark fudge.  Smooth and creamy upfront in the palate. Bourbon and vanilla at first. Smells of fresh vanilla bean. Then like the nose it becomes rich, dark chocolate, fudge. Roasted, burnt malt with, some oak behind it. Earthy, fresh ground espresso beans. Vanilla and bourbon are well balanced neither one dominates the other, though the bourbon comes through more as the beer warms. Has that dark fruity house character I find in Founder's Imperial Stout as well. Abv. is well hidden, not hot at all. Velvety, in the mouth, smooth and creamy with some sweetness on the lips, a little sticky. It drinks like a rich liquid chocolate cake or mousse. Would pair well with cheesecake maybe? or other rich desserts. Always a great beer, it never gets heavy or tiresome. Sadly becoming more difficult to find each year, oh well I've got a 4 pack to age.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,notchucknorris,4.97,"Huge, huge thanks to brew3crew for this one! Thanks, Jason!  A: Jet black with a very thin, tan head.  S: Oh my. Huge smells of dark roasted coffee, chocolate and fudge. The coffee is what really blew my mind here. It smelled like someone had just ground a bunch of dark coffee into my glass. Amazing.  T: Without a doubt one of the best beers I've ever had. There are some absolutely huge dark chocolate and coffee flavors that blend really well together. Just like the smell, the coffee is unbelievably fresh-tasting. There's a substantial roasted quality that works well into the flavor profile as well. I didn't pick up much bourbon here, but I wouldn't change a thing about this one. It was incredible. So glad I got to try this one.  Re-review  2/11/13  A: Pitch black with a thin mocha colored head.  S: Bourbon right away, oak barrel, vanilla, rich dark roasted coffee and chocolate cake. The smell is fantastic.  T: Bourbon and roasted malt on the front end. Middle shows some dark roasted coffee, toffee and caramel. Finish brings some charred wood and a nice hint of heat. Such a great beer and one I'm really glad to have found again.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,mdvatab,5,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into snifter.  Aroma: Chocolate milkshake, dark roasted coffee beans, powdered cocoa, Hershey's bar, and a faint sweet bourbon note  Appearance: Black as ink. One finger of cappucino brown head collapses to a thin layer of foam that clings to the inside of the glass.  Flavor: Moist, rich earthiness up front, a light vanilla note, peppery bourbon heat is tempered by dark chocolate brownie with an underlying coffee note. The label says 70 IBUs, but they're very well hidden. The overall flavor tends, as it should, to sweet roastiness, and avoids acrid notes sometimes derived from the darkest malts.  Mouthfeel: Thick body with creamy carbonation. The bitterness that lingers on the back of the tongue seems to come more from dark, roasted malt than from hops.  Overall: This beer has so much complexity, one can't help but slip into a relaxed, contemplative mood. Lots of great things going on here. The noticeable booziness is not overwhelming, and will probably soften over time. Next time I'm lucky to get a hold of one of these, I think I'm going to cellar it for a few years.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Pahn,4.89,"12oz bottle into Duvel tulip. Bottled 2/25/11, drank on 4/24/11.  Appearance: Free pour yields a one and a half inch frothy tan head that dissipates slowly leaving short-lived rings of lacing. Pours a viscous black with brown highlights. Leaves short-lived lacing walls and tight peaks and spots of lasting lacing.  Smell: Bottle: like a bottle of bourbon. Glass: Sweet dark fruits, mild light coffee, some vanilla. Some booziness and unsweetened chocolate come out quickly. Chocolate chip cookie, raisin, mild breadiness.  The smell is really nice. It's not busy, but constantly evolving; there's usually three or four discernible notes present, and each one is full of character. For example, halfway through some great molasses and savory aromas start to emerge (tempered by lingering vanilla), which soon give way to more raisin and bourbon.  Taste: First sip is bourbon and coffee ice cream up front, segueing to a delicious and complex barrage of decadent liqueur flavors through to the oaky vanilla finish. Surprisingly smooth and clean finish, with the heat mainly showing up in the beginning. However, the heat builds up and becomes a constant background for the ultimately long and good aftertaste.  Oak and bourbon influence all the (numerous) flavors here, but only occasionally stand out as a distinct bourbon note. The advertised 70 IBUs are apparently just enough, because the beer doesn't strike me as too rich or too sweet or too bitter. The flavor is strong but not harsh; there's sort of a coffee bean essence, chocolate chip highlights, lots of chocolate cake and even more (bourbon-influenced) liqueur flavors, marrying together perfectly.  While the beer's aroma is a constantly evolving set of three or four notes, the taste is a symphony. It is the powerhouse people make it out to be (the flavors are all bold), but everything is sublimely palatable and complimentary. The brewers have extracted an unbelievable amount of (always balanced!) flavor from the ingredients and processes that went into making this beer.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied. Smooth, but not quite creamy. Great bitter bite going into the hot finish. Finish occasionally clean, occasionally semi-dry.  Overall: Flawless beer. Merits the hype surrounding it. One bottle of KBS is like getting the best of many other world class stouts in one glass. I'm not one to give points for hype or rarity either; I'm a practical man who would ideally be able to buy 5.0 beers whenever I go to the bottle shop--I don't like hassle. This beer is worth the trouble of finding it (though I, as usual in my life, just sort of happened upon it).  The more Founders beers I have, the more I'm convinced that they're probably the most talented brewers in America today. KBS is a triumphant bourbon barrel aged imperial stout, and a further testament to the brewery's greatness... and I'm trying hard here to temper my gushing about how amazing this beer is.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Just a really good mix of all those scents with a faint smell of brown sugar.  T-Just booming with toffee and chocolate.

In fact, that's exactly what I did for 15 minutes, just smell, no taste, I may have a problem here. Lot's of chocolate, mostly milk. The bourbon smell mixes in perfectly as well as a strong coffee note when it warms up.  The taste is equally amazing. Man, I hate gushing about a beer but this everything I want in a beer and then some. Plenty of chocolate, like the smell, but the bourbon is much stronger on the palate. Chocolate, coffee, and bourbon, all very strong, assaulting your palate, but yet, perfectly balanced.  Slick consistency, low on carbonation, but exactly how I want the beer to feel in my mouth.

S: Chocolate, coffee, and vanilla, in that order, to me. The nose could use a bit more ""Kentucky,"" as it's a bit soft and lost in the complexity at first, coming through as my nose adjusts. Excellent all around.  T: Not too sweet, and lets all the excellent scents shine through in the taste. Chocolate, caramel, whiskey, vanilla, and a bit of hops even--70 IBUs, after all! This is very much on par with Bourbon County variations, an excellent quaff--smooth, balanced interplay of complex, complementary flavors.

They all blend very well together.  Taste: roasted coffee once again, followed by vanilla, chcocolate, and oak. There is a boozy alchohol taste towards the end.

Minimal dark chocolate colored brown lacing. There appears to be plenty carbonation.  Smell: Dark roast coffee is most apparent on the nose. Dark chocolate/bourbon notes are in the nose as well. Slight hints of oatmeal in the background. I'm also picking up the slightest hint of vanilla, although it is masked by the other scents. I can't wait to give this one a taste.  Taste: The arrival consists of dark roasted malts, coffee, and dark chocolate on the foreground with vanilla and sweet bourbon in the background. Very oily, and malty Dark chocolate and smoked tobacco is most apparent on the lingering finish. There is a warming effect with the high ABV. The alcohol comes through in the form of bourbon. From a superficial standpoint, it tastes like a strong bourbon and coke. Over time, it settles down and becomes more manageable. Overall, fairly complex.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied. This one is a bruiser. Moderate carbonation is the only thing separating this beer from the viscosity of oil. Very thick and creamy. Slight drying effect on the finish.  Ending notes: This beer is definitely not for the feint-hearted. it packs a punch at 11.2% ABV. It is a good sipping beer. Definitely not sessionable. I had to take my time with this one.

1199,19960,TheBrewo,4.3,"We pour an impenetrable brew of slick molasses black. It holds a dark brown head of about half a finger. It disappears rather quickly but comes back with big bubbles when coaxed in a swirl. It appears thick, and the bubbles rise slowly within it. No sediment is noted. The aromatics begin a bit muted, but flower as it warms. What is apparent first is the oak barreling. The woodiness comes off stronger than the bourbon infusion, but the latter is there with some buttery diacetyls to the back of the nose. It is not overly boozy, but the alcohol is notable. The barrels give off a curious tannin-like vibe, giving the impression that some of the barrels may have had red wine in them, rather than bourbon. The malts are dark and roasty, and come all slightly dry and chalky. The coffee is there, overwhelmed by bitter cocoa nibs, but the two scents sing together. Vanilla also seems to be present along with the diacetyls and booze, cooling the nose. As we sip there is an explosion of sweet chocolate at the very front. The woodiness breaks through to cut the sweetness, while the bourbon floats right over the middle of the tongue, affording a buttery, alcoholic bite. Through the middle we see those dark malts and heavily roasted coffee beans, further cutting the sweetness from the beginning. We peak with boozy sweetness that drives us home to the finish. The end is drying and heavily woody, with some low rumblings from the alcohol poking through. The aftertaste breathes with buttery diacetyls, heavy malts, residual sweetness, and a slight bourbony kick, which comes across similar to baking vanilla. The body is full, and the carbonation is hardly noted. The smoothness to each sip is outrageous, with each mouthful being slick and silky soft. There is the utmost slurpability, as well. The oak acts to dry the mouth out considerably, much in the fashion of red wine. This is a very warming beer. The abv is up there, and this beer is certainly a sipper.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how creamy, frothy, and oily the mouthfeel was. The brew pours as I would imagine a glassful of the chocolate waterfall from “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” would pour. While the bourbon wasn’t starkly present throughout, as the beer warms it becomes very boozy, and by the end, was a bit much. All in all, the feel alone was enough to bring this into the “great” category.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Nose is bourbon, dark roasted malt, notes of dark coffee, vanilla. Taste is robust and complex; not an overwhelming amount of bourbon taste thankfully, but still enough presence to dominate. Bitter and dark coffee flavours are heavy and delicious. Mouthfeel is heavy, leaves a dry sensation. Overall, unsurprisingly, Founder's really hits it out of the ballpark with the KBS.

1199,19960,tsatem,4.07,"12 oz. bottle (2/25/11 at 8:45) into a snifter, thanks to ColdPoncho.  A: Barely any head, but a small group of large bubbles forms on the top of the beer. Pours pitch black, with the very small head that does exist being a light tan. There's a surprising amount of lacing.  S: Coffee, predominantly - espresso and mocha. Lots of roasted malts. Vanilla balances these with some sweetness. Slight bourbon notes, but less than I was expecting. The bourbon mixes with wood and a good amount of earthy notes. There's some smoke, but this is pretty subtle overall.  T: I would believe this was a barrel aged breakfast stout if Founder's didn't tell me otherwise. Lots of coffee. Surprisingly bitter, lots of hops at the front which mix nicely with the mocha and balance the bourbony sweetness nicely. Bourbon flavor overall is rather subtle. Tobacco leaves dominate the finish, mixed with some oat-like notes. More wood than bourbon from the barrels - these wood notes are extremely dry.  M: Pretty lively and rather smooth. Dry, woody finish. Sticky after that. Alcohol is hidden incredibly well.  O: This is absolutely a delicious beer.

S - the bourbon is the strongest aroma and is very strong on caramel. Everything else is rather muted. Hints of chocolate and coffee.  T - some chocolate flavor up front. As the stout warms on the tongue coffee flavors are stirred up as well as some woody flavor from the oak. Maybe a touch of vanilla as the strong caramelly bourbon becomes very apparent. Finishes like a bourbon, long and strong.  M - heavy. Full bodied. The oats give it a velvety luxurious feel.Barely any carbonation is noticeable.  O - still a really good beer.

For me that was the highlight of this beer, the taste is big coffee, oak, maybe a bit of dark chocolate. The flavor reminds me of cold burnt coffee (i personally did not get any bourbon barrel).

1199,19960,mwill7287,4.72,"Poured from a 12-oz. bottle into a Chimay goblet (snifter is unfortunately in Boston right now). Thanks to Warehouse Beverage in South Euclid, OH for holding on to a few bottles into April for latecomers like me!  A - Pitch black, with a thin mocha brown head that retains around the perimeter throughout the drink. Spotty surface with mid-low carbonation. Little lacing left behind on the glass.  S - Wonderful bouquet of rich, sweet chocolates and some coffee. Bourbon from the aging barrels swarm throughout the smell. Such an inviting whiff.  T - At first, dominantly chocolate, sweet but not overpowering a la Young's Double Chocolate Stout; a very natural-tasting and balanced sweetness. Bourbon tones detected in the nose are very present on the tongue. Transitions to a bit of sourness, a la Peche du Mortel. Finish and aftertaste and mild, not tongue-scorching, and leave behind traces of sour and bourbon. Hard to complain.  M - Begins tingling on the tip of the tongue, shifts to warm alcoholic feeling as it rolls across. Creamy. This beer has a high ABV but is hid relatively well. The bourbon tones slow me down halfway thru the drink.  O - Worth the hype. Taste pokes its head above the rest of a very strong pack of Imperial Stouts. Smell is divine. Dark as night.

S: Lots of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. The bourbon comes through but its not the main event for me. There is a bit of sweetness - perhaps vanilla.  T: Coffee upfront with a strong bitterness that lingers all the way through. Dark chocolate, bourbon stick around the entire drink alternating prominent roles. There is a distinct woody flavor near the end flows into sweetness but evaporates and lets some sweetness and bitterness come back. Dry finish.  M: Thick and dry without being overly chewy or syrupy.  O: Really a great beer. Its not overly sweet or burned or boozey. A great balance of everything.

A: Opaque black, creamy foam with small bubbles, persistent through the beer, light-medium lacing  Sl: Sweet milk chocolate, light bourbon with a tinge of burning alcohol  T: Surprisingly dry in a very pleasant wany, starts with the sweet milk chocolate, moves to dark chocolate and then into coffee. Bourbon notes are light and present throughout, though never overwhelming.  M: Minor heat from the alcohol but considering the strength it is acceptable, even warming if the weather is appropriate. Carbonation does not sting, and the mouthfeel is quite full and creamy.  O: Please sir, may I have another? Was fortunate enough to have this both in bottle and on tap, no drastic difference. Only thing that would keep me from having more is price and availability!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,thebeerisgood,4.92,"Aroma: A complex weave of bourbon, chocolate, coffee and roasted malt.  Appearance: Dark as midnight, maybe darker. No light escapes this brew and is complete with a one-finger thick brown head.  Taste: KBS has huge taste consisting of chocolate, roasted malt, and just a hint of tobacco. Finishes dry with warmth from the bourbon.  Mouthfeel: Thick, coats everything and stays with you. Very light carbonation in this.  Overall: A really great tasting brew with big, complex tastes. Certainly not a session brew, this is great for sitting back, relaxing and enjoying each sip.  Notes: I was lucky enough to pick up some bottles at Citywide (South Bend), and then a few weeks later at Belmont on S.B. Ave. This is a very rare and sought after beer every year, running around $7-8 per 12oz bottle. Fiddler's Hearth on Main St. in South Bend also has a keg of this every year shortly after its official release. This is a really great beer, aged in bourbon barrels for an entire year before it is released.

1199,19960,EORS,4.55,"Founders event at my local pub meant a 1/4 barrel of this year's release was on offer. Poured into a goblet.  Appearance: Very dark brown to black. Small amount of light brown head. This beer definitely has legs, almost looks syrupy along the edge of the glass.  Smell: Bourbon, chocolate, coffee up front. The barrel aging really adds to the aroma of the beer, and the large amounts of coffee/roast malt dominate. Hints of lactose and other malt sweetness as the beer warmed.  Taste: Again, woody, resiny notes from the barrel really come through, chocolate and coffee less prevalent on the palette. Great credit to Founders here: even though it's a different recipe from their Breakfast Stout, there still seems to be some milk sugar in the recipe, which combined with the abundance of malt, balances out the body of the beer and prevents the alcohol or the bourbon flavor from running rampant. You can definitely tell that both are there, though.  Mouthfeel: Another exceptional category - a gripe I have with imperial stouts is that they feel syrupy, almost medicinal at high ABVs. This one, (while viscous, don't get me wrong) still feels full-bodied and smooth. It really improves the beer's drinkability.  Overall: This is a great offering to be enjoyed on a very limited basis. I enjoyed it, but wouldn't have more than one glass at a sitting (took me about 40 minutes to get through it). Prefer it to the local offering, Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout, and have high hopes for the Breakfast Stout when I try it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S: Coffee up front, then one has to search for the bourbon, kind of disappointing, but still great scents. Some nice chocolaty hints, along with vanilla.  T: Huge roasted malts, but matched with a fudge-chocolate sweetness. Strong coffee presence, as the nose would lead on, then comes the delicious woody notes; hints of vanilla. The bourbon is very much in the background, but the rest of the flavors are excellent.  M: Medium body, not too thick, but pretty smooth and almost creamy. No sign of alcohol in this beer.

I swear a poured this beer to the best of my ability and all I got out of it was maybe 1 finger of toffee colored frothy goodness that quickly dissipated into a thin film on top of the beer  S: OH SHIT this beer smells amazing! I'm being blasted with rich chocolate and bourbon right away. Once it starts to warm up i'm getting a lot more coffee, vanilla and roasted malts in the background and amazing wood characteristics. Very complex  T: This is a BOLD brew. I'm loving every drop of this beer. It's following the nose pretty true. Rich chocolate, rich coffee, the bourbon has just the right amount of heat, molasses, subtle vanilla and oak... this beer is AMAZING! Each flavor stands out but mixes so well with one another. I could keep rambling but typing is taking away from my next sip...  M: Full bodied and viscous. Coats the mouth with each sip and sticks around until you put a fresh coat on it with the next one. The bourbon stings your tongue with every mouthful and the carbonation is there just enough to enhance that sensation.  O: After drinking this beer I finally understand all of the hype that goes along with it. Its a complex, bold, rich, fantastic, wonderful, delicious, viscous mocha bourbon latte and I cant thank my trading partner enough to have sent more than one.

A: pours a viscous black, I raise the bottle away from the glass as I pour and the stream never breaks, even at a full arms length. Even at this distance I can't get a head on this beer, what results is a light layer of burnt brown froth that quickly recedes to a thin ring. This bad boy has far too much booze to get any lacing but I'd say that's to style for this one. S: a perfect blend of wood/bourbon and coffee with rich roasted malts on the back. Let this baby warm up for full effect. Molasses and chocolate roll out as it warms and the vanilla shows it's face for just a moment. T: ohh, the sweet burn of bourbon that is immediately comforted by an explosion of sweet sugary malts. Once this onslaught has passed the door opens to a thick molasses type/ dark fruit background with just the right amount of bourbon. M/O: thick motor oil texture with just enough carbonation to cut the sweetness. I would drink the whole 4 pack if my liver could take it.

1199,19960,Captainren,4.53,"Somehow, living not even five minutes from the brewery, I missed out on getting any bottles of KBS because of all the people following the delivery trucks from store to store. Luckily, I was at the right party at the right time and was given a bottle. And another two weeks later, I was in a store that had a ""stash"" and sold me two. Now that I have multiples, I can drink one now and age some.  Brandy snifter - as dark as you can get without actually being black in all the right ways.  Aroma - A first whiff, a sharpness that made me think it needed aging badly or it needed to breath/warm up a little. After about an hour, it's taken on a completely different aroma. Chocolate is the most prominent thing I get. I can definitely smell the wood, and I say wood on purpose instead of oak specifically. Very thick and roasty overall.  Taste - Where to start with a beer like this? It's like going to Cedar Point and trying to decide which roller coaster to ride first. The chocolate and wood take me for a ride right away. The Bourbon barrels definitely add a mild sweet vanilla oak taste and when the rides over, coffee is left on the taste buds.  Mouth Feel - For a beer over 11 percent, its characteristics overwhelm the sensation some beers can have at this level. If actual coffee had this great of a finish, I'd never sleep.  Overall - A Dantastic beer, but I can't help but think it will be much better with some age behind it. Nevertheless, it's still a great beer that will impress your friends or reveal that they have no idea what a great beer is when they gag after tasting it. That can be the sign of a great beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,HattedClassic,4.7,"Appearance: Pitch black with a hint of dark brown. Half of a finger of dark tan head that dissipates quickly.  Smell:Dark chocolate with vanilla and coffee with the bourbon at the edges, which complements the vanilla and coffee very well. No malts to speak of.  Taste: Coffee flavors and vanilla complement the chocolate, which reminds more of dark chocolate syrup taste than a dark chocolate bar. I think I might have detected some light roasted malts but not quite sure. I get some oak barrels through the beer but it blends with the coffee somewhat. The bourbon is not as heavy as I thought it would be and only exists at the far edges of the brew rather than pervading it. The vanilla and bourbon seem to be complementing each other to contrast with the coffee and dark chocolate flavor.  Mouthfeel: Delicate carbonation with a thick, syrupy texture.  Overall: After chilling it a little bit, the stout really lets its flavors loose. KBS is definitely thicker and heavier than other stouts and doesn't suffer from the bourbon taking up too much of the palate, which is a plus in my book. The former were all rich. KBS is not a beer for the faint of heart.

Super rich. Amazing.  Very rich. Chocolate and vanilla. The bourbon is very subtle at the edges. Syrupy in feel but thin in texture. Gosh that's rich. There's a roast there that really backs up the chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon. I can tell right away that I'm going to let this get nice and warm.  Man, this is freaking delicious. The bourbon swirls in with the chocolate and vanilla along a coffee spine. A few quick sips and I realize the trouble this one can cause.

1199,19960,Mississipping,4.03,"12oz bottle poured into snifter. Thanks StayWhatYouAre2 for sending a bottle of this out of the blue.  A: Pours a nicely viscous, black liquid that (of course) resembles motor oil. A fairly violent pour yields almost no head at all, but just a thin patch film and sticky ring. It settles very still; almost no evidence of any carbonation.  S: The smell is quite complex, with dark chocolate, bourbon, toffee, roasted barley, and alcohol being the most noticeable characteristics. The smell is really great, although it smells a bit hot.  T: Dark chocolate, again, is right up front, along with barrel characteristics, dark fruit, and subtle toffee. The roasted malt quality is much stronger than it is in the smell. It finishes just slightly bitter from the alcohol along with subtle hoppiness and coffee.  M: Pretty darn thick. It's viscosity is evident on the tongue and it coats the mouth well. Subdued carbonation adds to the thickness but creates a very nice creaminess. This is one of the best aspects of this beer, in my opinion  D: My opinion of drinkability seems to differ from most, due to some qualities that I wasn't expecting. It's not that well balanced to me. The bourbon seems to compete too much with other characteristics. In addition, the alcohol isn't hidden all that well. Quite hot, and burns a bit.  This is really pretty spectacular, but it's not something that I'd seek out. I randomly got a bottle of this from an extremely generous BA and am glad that I got a chance to try it, but there are plenty barrel-aged stouts that I'd prefer and will go out of my way to get in the future.

1199,19960,GoldenChild,5,"A- Very dark, Pitch black, The look of some very heavily used motor oil. A pretty hard pour only yields a half finger head that is caramel brown. There isnt much head to this beer. There is some pretty sticky lacing that leaves some very nice patching.  S- When first poured the smell was heavily dark chocolate up front with hints of sweet bourbon, bold roasted coffee and vanilla. As the beer begins to warm the bourbon takes center stage as the dark chocolate joins the coffee and vanilla in the back seat. The smell of alcohol only intensifies as time goes on and takes on the presence of oak as it warms.  T- Very bold dark, bitter chocolate hits you right up front as you take your first sip just as it does in the smell. As the beer sits on your palate and reaches the back there is plenty of warm, mellow bourbon that finishes with a sweet vanilla and roasted coffee. Much like the smell, as the beer warms the flavor of bourbon and coffee become stronger and stronger until they almost match the flavor of the strong flavor of dark chocolate.  M- Very smooth and balanced. Definitely one of the most mellow bourbon flavors I have tasted in a beer with this alcohol content. Carbonation is low, as expected, and the finish is drying.  D- The beer as a whole has a very rich flavor and should not be drank as a session beer although i tried after 5 in a hour i blacked out. The rest will go in my cellar.

What a perfect appearance to have for a stout of this caliber. The aroma was good but surprisingly not as strong as I expected. Also the head was thin but warranted, being what it is. As for the taste, quite exquisite. I can taste the alcohol from the bourbon aging, no doubt, and I love it. A slight licorice flavor seems to follow the finish; another flavor I love to see present in a deep, dark stout. Mouthfeel is beyond smooth, it's almost like a cream.

1199,19960,nhindian,4.5,"12oz bottle poured into a Dogfish Head Signature glass.  2011 vintage.  A - Pours slowly and thickly into the glass, slowly filling it with an oily black fluid. A fairly hard pour yields only about a finger's worth of dark khaki head. Retention is decent for the alcohol, and a thick cap stays behind. Lacing is very good as well, leaving a thin film on the walls of the glass. The body is completely opaque and polished ebony in color and makes a nice makeshift mirror.  S - The nose is brash and bold with flavors of coffee, vanilla and bourbon. I'm not sure if Founders uses any vanilla in the making of this beer, but the aroma of vanilla is some of the highest I've had from a bourbon barrel-aged stout. It's a bit boozy, but the coffee is fresh and aromatic and the bourbon actually goes a long way in cutting the alcohol with some sweetness.  T - The taste brings even more balance and complexity, adding chocolate fudge to the mix. Again, the vanilla is huge here, and the combo between the coffee, chocolate, and vanilla is reminding me of a bourbon-aged Ballast Point Victory at Sea in the way everything comes together. These flavors are so big that they actually overshadow the bourbon, which adds a nice additional layer without being too alcoholic or overbearing.  M - Mouthfeel is heavy-bodied with low carbonation. Damn smooth and creamy and it leaves a coating that keeps the flavors coming minutes after drinking. A bit thin for the style.  D - Drinkability is high. I don't get any sense of 11.20% ABV in this beer and the flavors keep coming with more twists and turns as it warms. Very good beer, but unfortunately the hype-train behind this beer left me with only 2 bottles at a price of $8 each...",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Azurescens,4.73,"12oz bottle pulled from my cellar with bottled on date 2/25/11, poured into Maudite stemmed glass, reviewed on 4/9/11  A: Pours extremely dark, pitch black with next to no light coming through the edges even when held up to the light. A frothy brown head dissipates pretty quick leaving some lacing around glass.  S: Big bourbon smell, vanilla and oak with some coffee and alcohol that combine incredibly well.  T: Tastes so good I can barely put it down to type this. Delicious bourbon up front with roasted barley, molasses, some coffee and chocolate as well. Leaves the most amazing sweet barrel aged stout taste lingering in my mouth teasing me to take another sip.  M: Full bodied and absolutely silky smooth from start to finish with next to no bite from the 11.2% ABV that is ridiculously well hidden. The only thing that gives away the high ABV is the terrific warm feeling that I get while drinking this.  O: World class. Quite possibly my favorite beer ever, we definitely have a winner here. I'm not a big fan of drinking straight bourbon, but I really, really love this. Wow, enough said, I'm going to finish savoring this masterpiece of a brew. Once again, I tip my hat to you Founders.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,StoneTSR,4.27,"APPEARANCE: No light got through this beer, even when I held it up towards the light bulb. Not much head either, but a few bubbles trickled up towards the top throughout the glass. No lacing to speak of.  SMELL: Not as intense a smell as I would have liked in a bourbon barrel aged stout, but what came through was very pleasant - a smoky, bourbon and vanilla aroma with hints of vanilla.  TASTE: The coffee, bourbon and chocolate flavors of this beer all seem to be equal parts. If this were a mixed drink it would be one part bourbon, one part Kahlua and one part Godiva Chocolate liqueur. Yes, that sounds too sweet, but remember, it is not a mixed drink, it is a beer, so there are plenty of hops which provide 70 IBUs in order to balance this one out. Nothing too complicated here, just an excellent, straight forward example of what a bourbon barrel aged beer should taste like.  MOUTHFEEL: KBS is one of the more bubbly and sparkling Imperial Stouts I have had, although, it would still qualify as more of an oily and mouthcoating beer than anything else. A nice, mild warming feel accompanied the bubbles on the way down as well.  OVERALL: Technically, this is one of the best beers I have ever had. Near perfect balance and flavors that make it one of the best representatives of the style out there make this beer delicious, but I have tasted one better Imperial Stout and it's name started with Bourbon, ended with Stout and had County in the middle.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Liverpool08,5,"Wow, so lucky to have found this one available at The Lower Depths in Kenmore Square after the Sox game yesterday. Pours a dark dark dark chocolate brown. Nice mocha colored head. Aroma is boozy warm and inviting. Smells of vanilla, coffee, and bourbon goodness. This is the best balanced boubon aged beer I have tried. The booze is nice an mellow and sweet, and compliments the malty coffee flavors very well! Its like the best alchoholic coffee drink you have ever had. Even as it warms the flavors still remain solid and the booze does not take over. This beer is everything you have heard about it and more!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,sentomaster,4.85,"on tap poured into a snifter  A- Black. Pitch black. Jet f*ckn black. Gorgeous mocha colored two finger head pops up. It's surprising to see a monster beer of this abv able to produce such an ample layer of foam.  S- freakin awesome. Served cold, probably about 48 degrees which leads to a much softer nose than what you get after it warms up- regardess, this is a huge beer with massive aromas. When cold, toasty malty and chocolate dominate. The bourbon is not obnoxious, rather it hides behind the HEFTY, thick, roasted malt and cocoa aromas that batter your nose.  T/M- This beer tastes as black as it looks. Unbelievably thick and malty. Malt flavors range from burnt toast to sticky fudge, with the former presenting itself as the beer warms. The first few quaffs may lead you to think the beer is a bit of a one trick pony. The bourbon is again in the background somewhat as the massive malt profile takes centerstage. Roasty dark chocolate, vanilla, and fudge flavors lather and coat your tongue in an epic, huge body that is rounded out by a silky oatmeal smoothness. In the finish the bourbon finally makes its full presence known. After it goes down a woody bourbon heat lingers ever so lightly, falling just short of being too pronounced- perfect.  As it warms the bourbon really comes out in all stages, and the coffee flavors and aromas appear beyond what was just an espresso like quality at first. A bit more astringency and burnt sugar also comes forth. There may even be a slight earthy and herbal hop presence but its almost impossible to tell underneath all this malt, coffee and bourbon.  O- This beer is really quite amazing, noticeably better on tap than I remember it being the half a dozen or so times I've had it out of the bottle- which I also thought fantastic. An epic concoction with copious amounts of malt. A no holds barred concoction that I would liken to a bag of dark chocolate, thrown into a bag of coffee, thrown into a bourbon barrel- but that would be only the beginning. The resultant mixture must be tasted- heaven in a glass.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,Ynot2,4.65,"2011 from Frog223, thanks for the hook-up. Notes from April 2nd.  Poured into a tulip glass deep black with traces of a lighter black or dark brown at the edges. Very thin beige head and virtually no lacing.  Smelled bourbon and chocolate immediately, and a little vanilla at the end, mmmm nice.  The taste is a chocolate at first and a slight taste of coffee. You can feel the bourbon at the back end, but it is not overpowering at all. I get a slight vanilla taste more of a lingering taste than up front.  Mouthfeel is sweet and kinda thick, not as chewey as I imagined. Very litte carbonation, sits on the tounge nicely.  Overall an excellent beer. Great balance and easy to taste the individual flavors.

I would like to give a huge thanks to both of these top-notch BAs. Thanks, guys!!! These were drank side-by-side with witchsbrew. My review reflects the 2011. With notes about the 2010 at the end.  Appearance- Black with brown highlights around the edges. Small tan head that dissipates quickly.  Smell- Creamy chocolate and some bourbon. Vanilla to back it up.  Taste- Oh yea! Chocolate, vanilla and a really nice bourbon heat as it goes down. There is also some coffee, but not very much. Small, small taste of coconut as well. Yumo!  Mouthfeel- Chewy and sweet. A little sticky, but in a good way.  Overall- This is a great beer. You don't feel the alcohol till later. Starts out not tasting 11% but catches up to you.  2010- Much more rounded than the 2011. Less bourbon heat and more chocolate and vanilla. Still sticky sweet mouthfeel. Maybe even more so. This was wichsbrew's favorite of the two.

1199,19960,greenmonstah,4.32,"2011 batch into pint glass  A - Black. Solid black. Thick as can be. Almost no head. Good lacing, somehow.  S - Tons of coffee. Sweet chocolate. Hint of bourbon. Dominated by coffee ground aroma. The coffee aroma is so intense you can smell it across the room, as if someone just put on a fresh pot.  T - Tastes like boozey coffee. A splash of bourbon in a mocha. Chocolate and booze and coffee. So much going on, it is delicious. Finish is allll bourbon. Some charred oak. Finish is so warm and inviting. Tastes like the best whiskey you've had. Also tasted a sip of 2009, and it was markedly better. Let this one age.  M - Quite thick. Needs to be creamier. It is quite wet throughout, with a slightly drier finish. I love how thick it is. Great feel.  O - One of the best. That said I think FBS is a better balanced beer. KBS is almost too much bourbon. I think BCBS does a better job of accentuating the bourbon flavor without losing the best parts of the underlying stout. KBS is a bit too much bourbon for my taste. Even still, it is beyond delicious, especially with some age on it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,GarrettMD,4.35,"A - Pitch black with a thin layer of dark tan head. Fades very quickly leaving no lacing.  S - Smelled coffee from a few feet away after the pour. Upon closer inspection, that's almost all there is to the aroma. Fresh ground coffee beans. Some hints of chocolate, but really not much. No alcohol aroma at all.  T - Tastes like God's vagina. But seriously, bourbon, wow. I could have sworn someone spilled a shot of bourbon in my beer. Coffee is still pretty dominant in the flavor, along with chocolate.  M - Fairly thin for a stout of this ABV. Mouthfeel is slightly watery, but it fits very well with the amazingly present bourbon taste. Finish is slightly wet and sweet with a lingering aftertaste of sweet bourbon with a hint of coffee.  D - Absolutely amazing. Can't taste the alcohol at all. As far as a bourobn beer goes, this is absolutely amazing. The balance between coffee and bourbon is great, but balancing in other stout-like qualities it's lacking. I feel I have to under-rate some of these qualities just based on what an Imperial Stout should be, but as far as a bourbon stout, this is one of, if not, the best.

S- Chocolate and porter-esque dirt. Or is it more proper to say ""earthy""? The chocolate is wonderfully overpowering and is finished off with a whiff of whiskey.  T- Balance: chocolate, bourbon, malt...wow. What really amazes me is how strong the bourbon and chocolate come through without being too sweet or too boozy.  M- Can you use the term ""chewy"" with beer? If so, this is it. It's thick, but still has an unexpected level of carbonation.  D - I may actually have another, this is so good.

1199,19960,duffcalifornia,4.97,"2011 vintage poured into a Duvel tulip.  A: Combine the darkness of bourbon with black coffee and you'd still have something that let more light in than KBS. Absolutely tar black. Pours with a 1"" thick dark mocha head that fades quickly but provides excellent lacing.  S: The nose is a perfect blend of bourbon and chocolate. Neither dominates, instead complimenting each other. Also included in the nose are faint notes of roasted malt, and perhaps some dark fruit. This is the most balanced bourbon barrel aged stout I've ever smelled.  T: Again, the bourbon is present, but not overpowering. An excellently blended combination of bourbon, chocolate, hints of vanilla, roasted malt. I've never tasted anything this complex and yet this harmonious. Nothing is out of place, and every sip reveals something new.  M: As viscous as you could hope for. KBS slithers down your throat, hanging on for dear life, letting you savor that amazing flavor for as long as possible. Carbonation is as low as can be without being nonexistent.  O: This is absolutely the best beer I've tasted to date. For being over 11% ABV, there's absolutely none of it in the taste. It's not too bourbon-y for somebody like me who had a bad experience with Jack Daniels in college, but not so light that it doesn't make a difference. And what a difference this makes. I will absolutely buy every bottle I can get my hands on in the future, and probably trade none of it away regardless of the asking price - it's too good to not drink myself.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Incredibly complex and well balanced.  M: Absolutely perfect, not too thick or thin, and doesn't have a ton of bite on the finish. Incredibly smooth.  O: Best beer that I've ever had.

1199,19960,comfortablynumb1,4.08,"Thanks to brees6221 for this one. My first KBS...  2010 bottle poured into a Ballast Point Brewery pint glass...  A - Pours black with a one finger brown head on a fairly passive pour. Good amount head retention, and lacing to be had here...  S - Coffee, chocolate, and lots of dark roasted malts. No Bourbon to be had through in the scent...  T - Chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malts, and a hint of vanilla. Finishes on a roasty bitter note with some coffee lingering. Coffee is definitely the main focus here. Bourbon is lacking big time. Was hoping for more heat in the finish...  M - Nice and thick with a moderate amount of carbonation...  O - Wondering if maybe age had an averse affect on this one because I don't see what all the hype is about. Way to much roasty/coffee notes, and next to no Bourbon in the taste made this just an above average drink for me. Would like to try a fresh one, but not something I am going to go out of my way to obtain...  Edit:  Had a chance to try a fairly fresh one these thanks to a very generous extra in a recent trade. Thanks Joey!  Coffee is still dominate here, especially as it warms, but the bourbon is much more pronounced. Enjoyed this alot more fresh, and adjusted my ratings to reflect so. Still don't think this lives up to the hype. While it is a solid brew, it is nothing above and beyond. To each their own though.

1199,19960,socon67,4.88,"Bottle dated 2/25/11. Got a 4pk at Best Yet in Harlem.  A - Pours black with a mocha colored foamy head about an inch thick. Settles out well with some lacing in my Corsendonk chalice. Just based on appearance this will be great.  S - Strong scents of vanilla, chocolate, toffee, and coffee. No real smell of bourbon, but this is a complex stout that isn't powerful as much as well blended.  T - Yeah, this is as good as advertised. The sweet taste of chocolate malts and carmael give to a bitter yet flavorful coffee. The finish does hit with a bourbon burn, but it really is smooth. Scary how this beer is so drinkable. This is what separates it from the pack IMO. Even Founders BS is not as blended quite as smooth.  M - The way this is so damn drinkable makes it impossible for me to think of how this could be better. No issues giving a 5 here. Doesn't feel heavy, has incredbily complex and varied flavors, and is gentle on the palate for a stout.  O - I tried to be so objective on this beer given the scarcity in New York and the praises KBS gets. It really is a top tier stout and about the best one could hope for. Have it with food, by itself, but share with others. I will cellar a couple to see what age does to the profile.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,nicknameddad,4.8,"I am a bit of a rookie, with this being my first review. I have read a lot of KBS reviews and all of them THAT I HAVE READ give this beer it's deserved credit. It is amazing and very satisfying.  This review is from a 2011 bottle. This is my fourth bottle in five weeks. I am trying to pace myself as it calls to me from the refrigerator everyday(not much left). I also chose not to write this review until I was able to pick it apart a little.  A - Always Jet Black when poured. The head is consistently a creamy mocha brown with a light tan tint that dissipates rather quickly but leaves a thin film across the surface throughout your enjoyment of the beer. I pour half to a 1/3 of the bottle at a time and get about 1/8 of an inch of head.  S - The first thing I do is smell the beer 4-5 times before tasting it, it is like beer foreplay and just makes the first taste so much better. Now I do not have a great sniffer, however I smell oak from the barrels, coffee, and bourbon immediately (i love my bourbons), then secondly I can slightly pick up chocolate, vanilla and caramel but I have to really concentrate and take it all in. Either way it smells amazing.  T - I can taste vanilla and chocolate notes throughout. It has a little kick from the bourbon and is comforting and warming on exhale. Now I know this beer is going to mellow out and the flavors are going to develop more over time (about 6 months to a year), but I am impatient as it is so good.  M - Velvety and creamy and smooth as silk is the best way to describe it.  O - I love it. I would have given it 5's across the board if I did not taste 09, 10, and 11 on tap on opening day. I know the taste is going to get better and better if kept well over the course of a year. We will see and try.

It poured with a dark brown, bubbly head. It smells and looks delicious just on the pour. There was a little bit of lacing as the drink is consumed, but not very much.  Its hard to discribe that aromas that I am smelling as I sniff this brew. There is a aromas from all sides, all strong, and yet independant enough I can smell each one. The front has a blast of chocolate malts and vanilla. As the brew sits, the oak and bourbon come together with the alcohol to give this brew that warms you with just its aroma. There is a hint of a dark fruit as well.  As I take my first sip of this brewl, im at lose for words. This brew is amazing. My first taste is of vanilla and malts that just blend together so well. As the brew sat and warmed, there is hops background that moves in, but allows the brew to remain creamy. Then the best part hits, and the there is an amazing flavor of toasted oak that just warms you almost instantly. Again, I have had some amazing brews, this brew has me at a lose for words.  The mouthful on this brew is crazy, its creamy, soft and yet full of life and bold. Its a full bodied brew, that has amazing balance and flavors.  Though some would say the drinkability on this brew be hard because of such a high ABV at 11.2%. But once you get a few sips in you hardly want to put it down. I finished, and wanted another.

1199,19960,BrewIrish98,4.85,"Serving: Out of a bottle into a Rastal Snifter.  A: The black hole of beer, light cannot escape it. Very minimal jello pudding skin of a head.  S: Coffee, licorice, chocolate, hint of bourbon sweetness. Not surprisingly a whiff of the empty bottle brings on the bourbon, big time.  T: Deeply roasted coffee malt, dark chocolate flavor, catch some cocoa bitterness toward the end. The alcohol is buried deep in the flavor profile, but when it gets there you get the woodly bourbon. Nearly reminds me of a ""Black Russian"" cocktail.  M: Delivers a creamy entrance, a little waxy which melts away. Finishes thin, but a nice almost sour bitterness lingers. Large moutfulls go down smooth, small sips bring out the alcohol.  O: If you can drink one stout a year, this would be the one. A lot of flavors here, and so much character. As the bottle warns ""Is good for everything a stout ought to be good for"". It's a lot to handle, a thimble would be enough for an evening.

1199,19960,SkunkWorks,4.54,"2011 vintage 12 oz bottle, poured into a Southampton Imperial Russian Stout release day snifter. Picked this up today and drinking it as fresh as I possibly could. Being a fan of the two other Founders' imperial stouts I've had (the IRS and Breakfast stout), I'm excited to try this one.  Look: a hard pour yields a single finger of milk chocolate colored foam with decent retention, eventually leading to a thin layer of milk chocolate bubbles at the top. As for lacing, a few bubbles of lacing stick but for the most part there's nothing but a bit of alcohol staining. The body is quite black with no highlights.  Smell: bourbon oak barrel aromas dominate, with hints of vanilla, some smokiness, alcohol, and chocolate. One of the best smelling imperial stouts I've found so far.  Taste: oaky, smoky bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, some coffee bean, and roasted grain. Once it is room temperature, the bourbon comes out much more prominently with a bit of brown sugar or molasses.  Feel: medium bodied, maybe a little thinner than I would like a stout of this size to be, and this is probably the only downfall of this beer. Fairly smooth, a little creamy, with some alcohol burn, and nicely carbonated at first and ends up a little flat before I can finish.  Drinkability: a bit of a sipper, but that's only because I want to be able to savor it as best as I can.  Overall: great beer that lived up to the hype. This is one of the best barrel aged beers I've had. It doesn't overdo the bourbon and leaves enough room for the other flavors to come out. I'm definitely very glad that I had a chance to try this and will hope to score some every year that it comes out. Founders, thanks for coming to New York. You've made my life that much better.

1199,19960,thstevens12,4.55,"2011 vintage - served at 50* into wineglass  Appearance: Fierce pour leads to thin lace. Soapy coffee colored bubbles cling to wineglass. Pitch black-no light breaks thru the glass. 4.5  Smell: Oak barrel, turbinado sugar, lactic sugar, coffee bean, bourbon, almost peaty like scotch. 4.5  Taste: French press, dark chocolate, brown sugar, vanilla. Mild roasted notes balance the sweeter flavors of this beer. 4.5  Mouthfeel: Delightful mouthfeel-creamy and nearly thin like a milk stout. My biggest complaint with most imperial stouts is the viscous and overly chewy mouthfeel. This beer manages just enough weight to have substance w/o becoming cumbersome.  5  Overall: The beer is a great exp from beginning to end. I bought several but am considering drinking them now b/c they are so delicious-I don't see how age could improve these.  4.5",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,Morey,4.55,"Pours black as crude oil and is topped by one finger brown head following a medium pour. Head is filled with multiple bubble sizes and has settled to a pretty thin lace after a few minutes or so. Pretty darn good head retention for a beer so high in alcohol.  Smell is roasty, sweet, woody, and slightly boozy all wrapped up in one pleasing aroma.  Wow! This is incredibly smooth, yet interesting and complex at the same time. I definitely get dark chocolate and a hint of vanilla. There's also the smooth thickness you expect from a good Oatmeal Stout. And to top things off...it's aged in bourbon barrels! What more could one ask for?  Nice full bodied mouthfeel with a carbonation level that's absolutely spot on.  Been waiting to try this for a while, and it's definitely an elite Imperial Stout.  Morey's Bottom Line: I had to do some driving as well as some smooth talking just to score a couple of bottles of this. Quite honestly, as good as this is...I don't think that I'd do it again. It's fantastic, but so is FBS, Founders Imperial Stout, Heresy and Ten Fidy among others.

1199,19960,mechamifune,4.85,"Another favorite that I figured was time to give a proper review to.  Poured into a sifter it looks pitch black with an oily looking texture. Very slight brown head develops in the glass, but carbonation is pretty evident in the lacing.  Nose is bourdon upfront, followed by chocolate and coffee in lesser notes. Not hugely floral but very pleasant.  Taste is bourbon upfront, followed by a very pleasant coffee/dark chocolate taste. Finishes with a slight coffee bitterness. Halfway through the glass a slight charred fruit taste starts to develop, but nothing overpowering. Very slightly hot but not unpleasantly so.  Mouthfeel is amazing.... as creamy and smooth a beer as I have experienced but manages to not feel ""heavy"" at the same time. While the bourbon taste is there it does not ""feel"" alcoholic. Dangerously drinkable.  Overall this might be my favorite beer, period...at the very least it is in my top 5. What really differentiates it from similar styled beers is the sense of blending. The bourbon isn't overpowering and flows beautifully with the chocolate and coffee notes, none of which I feel dominate. It is smooth without feeling heavy and slightly sweet without feeling sticky. You can not be a fan of bourbon and still enjoy this beer.... which says a lot, to me anyway. Get this beer.... but then again you already knew that.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,albertjr21,4.43,"Had this on tap at Rattle N Hum-NYC on 4.2.11.  Into an 8 oz. wine glass this appears the expected black or the darkest brown color with a ""chocolate milk"" tan color head and a consistent lacing. The nose is a lot milder than I would have expected but it's still an attractive one with light notes of coffee bean, cocoa, and vanilla cream. A smooth and creamy malt mouthfeel with a mild and crisp carbonation delivers into a deep and earthy fudge chocolate ice cream noted finish. Caramel also lightly echoes on the palate. As I neared the end of my third and final glass, I also sensed the warming quality reminiscent of a whiskey drink or a cool sipping rum.

1199,19960,BBP,4.65,"A- Dark Dark, and then some. Good carbonation, decent head, and decent lacing.  S- Sharp sharp bourbon booze aroma. There were subtle notes of the malt in it, but the bourbon was very overpowering.  T- Bourbon and more bourbon. Roasted malt and chocolate. Mocha and coffee as well. I almost wish there was less bourbon as it seems to overpower these a little bit. Due to the bourbon, it took until the later part of my drink for the base flavors to set in.  After the flavor began to settle in to my palate, it tasted unbelievably good. The follow through was far more then I would have expected, leaving superb flavor behind for a while after my sip had finished.  M- Very smooth and creamy. Medium full body. Perfectly carbonated. Slightly dry, and very sticky finish.  D- Too drinkable. It was gone before I knew it, and I consider myself somebody who takes my time drinking beer.  It was really an incredible beer, but it's extremely hard to find and a little pricey. I can't argue that it isn't worth the price tag, as it definitely is, but my only complaint is the availability.

1199,19960,EricCioe,4.62,"Reviewed from 1 April 2011 notes from the University of Chicago Pub. Apparently they had a KBS event the night before that I had no idea about. I called at 4 pm when a buddy of mine and I decided to go out for a drink after work. ""What stouts and porters do you have on tap?"" ""Northwinds, Ed Fitz, and if you hurry, the incomparable KBS."" Having whiffed on a bottle this year, I rushed out of work to get there. Got there, my glass poured, then a couple came up and the bartender talked then into trying a sample. They ordered a glass, and the bartender went to pour another sample for someone else and the keg kicked. I'm really glad I got there when I did. I saved the notes for a bit so I could have this as my 100th review.  This pours blacker than the blackest black times infinity with a one finger khaki head and some lace left behind. Sort of surprised to see that based on my experience with other bourbon barrel beers. On the nose it was an unreal mixture of oats, chocolate and vanilla, oak, and bourbon. The bourbon sat back a lot further in the mix than BCBS, for example, and it really integrated well. The chocolate and vanilla were an amazing mixture that formed the backbone that everything else sat on. I know it's not the same beer as FBS, but the nose was similar if a bit softer on the oats, with the addition of bourbon and oak. In the mouth all of the above still applied, but the chocolate really jumped out ahead of everything else. The bourbon and slight heat make for a long finish, and the body is big and palate coating, maybe just a bit too much. I am very glad I had the opportunity to try this beer. It's great, probably just a nose ahead of FBS and FIS. A brewery would do well to have any one of those stouts in their arsenal, and Founders has three.  EDIT - Had 2011 and 2012 bottles last night. Fresh was very slightly better.  EDIT 2 - Had this, CBS, FBS, FIS, and BLiS syrup as part of a Founders brunch with the Missoula crew. This and CBS were different flavors of awesome together, though for me this won by just a nose.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,haazer,4.94,"Review #100!!  This was the star of the show last night at the Craft Ale House Founders event. This was supposedly the 2010 version, served in a 10oz glass.  A- The beer is a opaque, pitch black brew. A small amount of coffee bean colored head sits atop for a few minutes and settles to the surface. Some dark red highlights shine through around the edges of the glass. A tiny bit of lacing hangs around as I make this dissapear slowly.  S- A phenomenal blend of bourbon and vanilla esters to start the nose out. Rubs the walls of the nostrils but makes no burn. Taking deep breaths brings in oak wood cut down in a damp forest. The barrel used gives off a lot of earthy aspects to this scent. Buried deep behind these great aromas is a freshly brewed pot of coffee.  T- Four main flavors I get out of this are coffee, chocolate, wood, vanilla and bourbon. In that order although the coffee comes back in the aftertaste. The coffee is felt on the first sip, which leads way into subtle hints of chocolate syrup. The chocolate submits to the oak about mid palatte. The oak taste is very smooth, not harsh at all. The vanilla and bourbon are blended together well to produce a sweet alcohol flavor. The bourbon flavor has just a tiny amount of heat and is not overkill as I thought it was in this beers cousin from the backwoods. Coffee makes a comeback in the aftertaste letting you know this does have breakfast in its name for a reason. This is just phenomal.  M- I've seen complaints about the mouthfeel on here, not for me. Full, thick, and chewy which is how I'd like my stouts to be. Alchohol really has no drying effect. Super smooth and palatte enveloping. Tiny sips of this find their way all across your tastebuds.  O- I try not to give such high ratings but this beer exceeded my expectations. I was a little worried at first that this would be good but fall short, and did not do so in any way. This is very drinkable, and I'm ever so grateful to have tried this due to its limited availability in PA. I can't imagine it being much better fresh as people say but I'll gladly be a test subject any time for that.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Kbogac,4.26,Picked up a couple of bottles of this at a local micro-brew pub. I'd had it once before but never a full serving just a taste.  Poured into a snifter. Dark and heavy with minimal foam. The initial smell was not very exciting. Dry earthy coffee smell with some malt that improved as it warmed. The taste also improved as it warmed up. The first taste was upfront coffee and roasted grains with a alcohol finish. As the beer warmed up the alcohol disappeared and was replaced with a nice coffee molasses finish. Not as sweet as I expected but overall excellent. Deep dark burbon and coffee. As good as it gets.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S - Incredibly pungent with roasted barley, strong bourbon hints, and chocolate. A slight punch from the hops is evident as well.  T - Heavenly. Thick chocolatey taste combined with roasted coffee flavors. The bourbon influence acts as a sort of glue, not asserting itself too strongly as a flavor but serving as a backbone for the other flavors.  M - Full-bodied and sticky, about average for the style. Surprisingly little warmth considering the ABV. Sits nicely in the stomach.

Appearance: Pours a thick black with very little tan head that leaves some spotting.  Nose: Big black vanilla bean, molasses, dark amber maple syrup, freshly brewed coffee and a little cream.  Palate: The coffee is big in both flavor and texture. It's a little gritty on the palate. The bourbon is present, but takes a back seat to the coffee. Vanilla is present and the molasses comes back. Maybe something like buttered rustic bread too.  Notes: I've had a couple vintages of this brew over the years, and my real complaint with it is about texture. It reminds me of really strong coffee that has some grounds that snuck out of the filter into the pot. I'd like to see more of the bourbon flavor which is fairly understated in this brew.

Hints of vanilla start to show as I get toward the end of the glass, along with the bourbon I felt was missing in my first few sips. It's understood that FBS is not the base beer, but want to note it tastes more like a barrel-aged FIS. Definitely weaker on the bourbon, which some may think is lacking, but for me this is better. Mouthfeel is chewy and thick. very nice, and slightly creamy. Drinkability is incredible given the ABV, it's very nice and smooth and just an awesome drink.

Smoke comes through in a burnt charred tabacco woody kind of way. Theres more to find here, see for yourself!  T- I would say the taste is more coffee foward and less on the smokey side of things, truth be told this is delicious but I appreciated the nose more with its smokey complexity. Lots of roast and acidic coffee flavors and with a shot of bourbon.  M- As massive as this beer is its not a thick as you might think, more smooth which I think enhances the flavors and enables you to find all the nuances instead of distracting you with the thickness.

1199,19960,awalk1227,4.77,"Consumed on 3/29/11, this was purchased at 5 Points Bottle Shop in Athens. 2011 vintage.  A: A deep brown, almost black pours out. It's pretty dark, like a cold void. A tiny cap of mocha head forms and dissipates into a thin light brown collar.  S: Bourbon, coffee, maple syrup all adorn this one. It's sweet and slightly boozy and just smells like a monstrous stout.  T: Wow! While a sipper for sure, this beer continues to throw new flavors at me with each taste. At first I get rich, vanilla bourbon. Then I get a deep chocolate, both dark and milk varieties. Then a robust, coffee note finishes. This beer is both sweet and bitter at the same time. Very complex.  F: Founders nails mouthfeel. It's silky smooth, coating and slightly oily on the tongue and teeth, with a bittering aspect on the finish. I want to keep sipping it but savor it at the same time.  O: I'm glad this beer comes in 4 packs. It's not a ""1-bomber beer."" This is one you would reach for every time at the liquor store if it was always on the shelves. I've heard people buy cases of this stuff. I don't blame them.

1199,19960,raszputini,4.65,"This was the big winner at ThirstyFest - a craft beer festiva sponsored by the Thirsty Monk. The keg didn't make it through the day. Nothing real unusual about it - its exactly what you would expect. A coffee-heavy Russian Imperial Stout with Bourbon barrel aging. There are no curve balls. What distinguishes it is that is such a fantastic example of this style. The bourbon flavor is definitely there, but not overwhelming. This is just a great beer. Drink one at any opportunity you get.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ahlavato,5,"I can't say anything more than has already been said about this brew.

1199,19960,ms11781,4.63,"Bottled on 02/25/2011. 12oz bottle poured into a snifter.  Pours a very thick solid black with a half finger brown head. Head reduces to thin tannish/light brown right around the glass and leaves some wispy lacing that eventually slides back down to meet the head.  Great subtle complexity to the nose. Small doses of coffee, chocolate, roasted malt and bourbon are all present. Some oak/woody aromas at times but for the most part it's a nice mix of the first four. None is too strong, none too weak and they all play off each other nicely.  Incredibly well balanced and complex in the taste as well. Pretty much identical to the nose except that each flavor is kicked up a notch. Great coffee and chocolate flavors along with some dark roasted malt character. The bourbon is there start to finish but it stays in the background and rides nicely underneath the other flavors before providing a slight burn at the finish.  A thick body and little carbonation, if any, give the beer a very slick and creamy feeling. There is a bit of a burn at the finish from the alcohol but in this case it just serves as a precursor to an extremely smooth finish.  Often, such a hyped and highly rated beer turns out to be merely a very good beer that is hyped and has high ratings. That's not the case here. An incredibly complex and well balanced bourbon barrel aged stout that doesn't hit you over the head with the fact that it's barrel aged.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,rmalinowski4,4.42,"Pours a dark black with a small tan head that recedes quickly and leaves a small ring around the edge of the glass.  Smells of chocolate, roast malt and bourbon. Very faint hints of coffee, vanilla, and oak.  Tastes starts with rich chocolate/ fudge, follows with bourbon and slight coffee bitterness, finish leaves traces of vanilla and oak along with more chocolate. Leaves a lingering taste of chocolate, simply delicious, smooth, and an absolutely wonderful sipper.  Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, but I feel it could use slightly more carbonation.  Overall this is a very fine beer. Complex, smooth, great taste. Very enjoyable to sip and ponder it's complexities.

1199,19960,joshuaseresse,4.47,"2011 vintage. Poured into a snifter:  A - Pours jet black with a quarter inch kahki mocha head that dies to a thin ring around the edges. Good signs of carbonation with bubbles running up the side of the glass. Patchy lacing on the sides that just slides off the edges.  S - Peppery bourbon, mixed roast and espresso notes and tones. Bits of chocolate and vanilla, barrel and earthy oak.  T - Smooth chocolate and bourbon. Easy vanilla and roasty undertones. Creamy cocoa and buttery goodness. Little bit of pepper, smoke and meat.  M - Really creamy and smooth. The carbonation sort of pricks up the mouth. The roasty notes leave a bit of drying effect. Reminds me a bit of coffee with a bit of bourbon in it.  D - Nice, smooth sipper. Its good to split with another person or just enjoy by the fireplace. Pretty delicious barrel aged stout, but I just wish it wasn't so expensive. I know this will age very nicely since I have a few bottles from last year in the closet. Lives up to the hype, but compared to some other usual barrel aged stouts (BCS) it is just pretty good.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S - Wow. Vanilla, coffee, bourbon, dark chocolate, some deep dark fruits, notes of wood. Even some tones that remind me of leather and a cigar bar. Everytime I smelled it it brought something nice a complex. T & M - Everything I found in the nose I found in the taste. It was incredibly balanced full bodied and smooth. I love bourbon and I really enjoyed the caramel dark chocolate open up to vanilla and cherry flavors like I enjoy to find in some bourbons. O - Incredible beer. Well aged and incredibly complex. This beer is well rounded and truly elite.  -Cheers",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,larsenju,4.69,"Thanks to psychotia for setting me up with this!  A-Black with a rich brown head, 1 finger, dropped relatively quickly leaving a pretty decent amount of lacing.  S-Smells like a top shelf bourbon. Very creamy sweet caramel with a little toffee and vanilla along with a nice oak character. Just a little heat (11.2, really?!) completes the bourbon aroma, and that is all backed up with a big smooth chocolate, a little biscuit, and finally some freshly roasted coffee beans. The coffee didn't really take center stage for me, but rather acted as a bridge for the other aromas, well played Founders.  T-Coffee and chocolate are a little more prevalent here with the bourbon taking a back seat, but it does come out after a second with some sweet brown sugar and caramel notes, vanilla, and just a touch of oak. For me the flavor was kind of a reversal of the smell, smell was bourbon first, then beer, the flavor was beer then bourbon. I started to get a little more heat here, still not on pace for what it actually is, but again it reminded me more of an actual bourbon.  M-Very low carb, super creamy and smooth, very nice.  D-One of the best I have had, I felt like everything was incorporated very nicely, and the ABV is hidden very very well. I recently had Peruvian Morning (great beer, don't get me wrong) but I feel like Founders did a much better job using the coffee to add complexity, rather that just adding another ingredient.

1199,19960,gdrydenc,4.68,"2011 KBS  A - Black as night. Try as I might, I can't see through this at all. A skim of dark brown head appeared as I poured it, but died very quickly.  S - Bourbon, tons of roasted malts, alcohol, coffee. Almost an overwhelming array of scents.  T - If I thought the smell was complex, the taste is more so. The bourbon is forefront, followed by coffee and the sweet chocolate of malts. Finally, the burn of the alcohol finishes off.  M - Pretty much no carbonation in this, but that's to be expected. What is there is small, foamy bubbles.  Overall, this stout does not disappoint. Thick and syrupy, black as night, and delicious.

Taste is very sweet chocolate, vanilla, and coffee followed by bourbon, lots of bourbon.  Mouthfeel is smooth and thick with little carbonation.  Drinkability is excellent.

T- The bourbon is very up front and makes it a little boozy. Roasted coffee malts and chocolate. All in all, its very balanced and delicious.  M- About as heavy of a stout I've had. Coats the throat.

Black as the night and thick like motor oil. Has legs in the glass  S. Very alcoholic, vanilla, bourbon, licorice, coffee, caramelized dates. Smells like chocolate espresso.  T. Booze is hidden well here, not following the smell. Like drinking a glass of very smooth bourbon, with raisins in it? Caramel sweetness verging on cloying, but it's still balanced. Finish is all strong coffee.  M. Very low carbonation and VERY thick mouthfeel; almost slick.  D. Half a glass is a good amount for this beer. Definitely up my alley, especially on a rainy cold day.

1199,19960,Groucho75,4.67,"2011 bottle poured slightly below room temperature into a snifter. Heard a lot about this and my local store stashed a few for me and a friend.  Jet black, like coffee poured from an Italian stove-top espresso maker. Viscous, almost syrupy. The pour yielded a micro-thin head, but I'd chalk that up to the careful pour. Lovely caramel-khaki head. Some bubbles, but not loads of carbonation.  Smell - oh man, here we go. Serving close to room temps definitely brought out the oak, the bourbon, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, malty goodness. If this were a fragrance, every dad should get it at Christmas.  Taste - Everything you smell, you get on the taste. Wham! Like having an excellent coffee stout with a dark chocolate wafer followed by a shot of smooth Kentucky bourbon. I nursed mine steadily for nearly an hour just to savor each sip. This is the first time I've given a ""5"" in this category.  I doubt you could, nor would want to pound this all night. Very smooth and very rich, but like a dessert, too much of it could leave you feeling ill. The 11.2% ABV is there. Really feels like you're drinking bourbon at some stages, but without the merciless hangover.  This is an excellent stout.

1199,19960,dmfrench,4.65,"Bourbon chocolate molasses in a bottle ___  A: The blackest beer I've ever seen... almost looks like it's giving off black. Two finger dark khaki head... second darkest I've ever seen (second to Founder's Imperial Stout).. had to hard pour to get the head to form, but it provided me with a pretty and slow cascade of tiny bubbles struggling against the viscosity.  S: Huge cocoa. Very fresh, powerful roasty cocoa... bourbon is not smelled as bourbon, but rather an enhancement, like in a confection. Alcohol itself, however, is clear. Fresh vanilla extract and espresso are detectable. Hard to get at the hops, but there's more going on that what specifics I was able to pick out, so I'll attribute this to hops. As the beer warms, spicy hops and molasses come out more, as well as charred wood. One of the best noses in the business.  T: There's the bourbon! Clear on the palate, along with alcohol. Syrupy chocolate molasses is next, with char and drying hops behind. At first, it's just these three flavors, but as the beer warms, cocoa, vanilla, espresso, and more hops come out, blending very homogeneously, though the overall impression is still on the syrupy side. Finish is forever long on bitter cocoa. As delicious as this beer is, I could imagine more complexity and depth on the palate.  M: Thick syrup... I could use more carbonation as it gets a bit too heavy at times.  O: Gets a bit heavy and syrupy, but smells amazing, and is still a delicious beer... wouldn't drink it all the time though... we have Breakfast Stout for that.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,Gehrig,5,"As I mulled my beer selection at the sterling Sun Singer, pondering whether to select Trois Pistoles or Pranqster, the excellent manager approached me and excitedly asked, ""You want some KBS?"" Stunned, I responded wide-eyed, You have Kentucky Breakfast Stout?!? He then reached over to the singles shelf and handed me the last two bottles of KBS. As I looked at them adoringly, then leaned back my head, closed my eyes and smiled, he walked past with a casual, ""You're welcome."" Thanks hardly seem sufficient.  A thin but persistent patch of mocha foam tops the blackest stout body imaginable. KBS, it seems, is where light goes to die. Incredibly, beautifully black. Very nice aromas, filled with bourbon, coffee, vanilla bean, and molasses. The smell isn't massive, but rather full and complex.  A sip of KBS is a glimpse into stout Heaven. The bourbon is pervasive but permissive, coating but allowing for the myriad flavors to emerge in stages. The first half was loaded with bourbon, fresh ground coffee, and vanilla bean--plenty of stout bitterness packed with flavor. What emerged in the second half was a surprising sweetness mixed in--a milder vanilla, loads of fruit especially berry and citrus, capped by a smooth bourbon finish. A work of art.  The velvety smooth mouthfeel brings plenty of hops with the creamy texture. Full, flavorful, and shockingly accessible. It is astounding how submerged the 11/2% ABV is, for this was far from a sipper, astonishingly enough.  This one easily lives up to its billing, no small task given its well-established reputation and that of Founders. KBS has, for me, joined the long litany of Founders legends and is also ensconced at the top of my favorite stouts. This beast is the stuff of legends; simply amazing.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,KYBrewgrass,4.82,"A- 4.5 Pours a dark, dark brown. You can tell it is brown and not black because of its thin, dark tan head. Ultra fine bubbles lace the sides of the snifter smoothly. It looks great overall but I was hoping for just a little more head retention. Not that this is keeping me away, obviously...  S- 5 Dark roasty malts, chocolate, and coffee dominate. There is a definite bourbon aroma in the background which balances its sweet smell nicely. I can smell the oak from the barrels as well, which is a surprise! It smells as perfectly as you'd imagine from reading its label.  T- 5 As you'd suspect from its aroma, this wonderful stout is bursting with flavors of chocolate and coffee. There is much more heat from the bourbon present in the taste than the smell, which is to be expected. I love that about this beer, though! It has a strong, excellent kick and it balances the initial sweetness perfectly, reminding me of its potency.  M- 4.5 Nice feel to this medium-full body stout. It isn't too heavy considering the strength of the brew, but it does coat the mouth well. There is just a bit of syrup on the tongue from the booze which leaves my senses tingling. There is a mild carbonation.  D- 4.5 One thing I love about this complex, beautifully crafted stout ale is that it really isn't that complex to decipher. All of its flavors are pronounced in their respective ways as it is balanced perfectly. It is definitely high in volume and flavor... And unfortunately, price. At $23.99 / 4-pack, it lost some of its ""drinkability"" for me before I was able to snag it off the shelf (or should I say from the employee who brought it out to me from the back room of the last store in town to have it stocked). Honestly, it is just so limited, so expensive, and so powerful that I couldn't see myself drinking more than one (maybe two on a special night). I'd rather hoard it! I'm wishing now that I would have saved one from last year to compare it with vertically... I'll be sure to do that for the 2012 batch!

1199,19960,2BDChicago,4.88,"Aroma: Very, very complex in the very best way. First is a coffee, but an exotic blend, then a deep rich molasses, and a little whiskey fire.  1st Taste: Soft, extremely full, burnt brown sugar, and bourbon with a tad of dark, semi-sweet chocolate in the background.  Overall: You know this is a big beer. Costs a ton, aged a year, and as Van Halen says ""everybody wants some."", and after this first tasting session I know why. It's statement of the obvious to say this brew has a huge personality. There's a a ton flavors that float around in the background...vanilla, oak, cocoa, oatmeal...go on and on. The sweetness doesn't seem to be malt, but from any of dozens of dark fruits and brown sugar variations. It's presence in the mouth is almost 3D, creamy and oily. And if you like the taste of whiskey fire, buddy this is your beer. Some might argue it's not the best brew in America, I think it's in the running. And, it shows the strength of the mid-west's dominace of the american whiskey(bourbon) barrel aged brews.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Some nice sweetness and the alcohol heat is in the background, being present but by no means overwhelming.  Mouthfeel: Lovely balance, smooth for a big beer like this.  Overall: Great beer.

1199,19960,BirdsandHops,4.97,"Doing a side-side with a 2010 and 2011 bottle.  A: Both pour a thick, jet black with a finger of chocolate head. Head retention is surprisingly good for a big, bbal stout as it fades to a solid, brown cap. Lacing is good as well as they tint the glasses brown.  S: 2010--Some roasted malt up front followed by a creamy, semi-sweet chocolate aroma. There are some light coffee aromas in there as well. The bourbon follows closely behind, providing aromas of vanilla, oak, and of course bourbon. 2011--Lots of dark chocolate and coffee up front on this baby. Full-bodied, robust, delicious coffee. Behind it comes a creamy-sweet vanilla aroma along with the bourbon.  T: 2010--Mmm, creamy, dark chocolate on the tongue followed by vanilla, oak, and bourbon. The finish has a robust--but not overly bitter--coffee flavor along with some warmth from the bourbon. Everything is so well balanced here--the coffee not too bitter, the bourbon not too strong, the chocolate and oak providing a light sweetness but not too much. 2011--Similar to the 2010, but much more coffee-forward. Dark chocolate and that full, robust coffee are first and foremost. The bourbon along with its vanilla and oak flavors come next, more present than in the 2010 but still not overwhelming. A surprising piny hop flavor comes afterward, providing some bite to go with the lightly bitter and full-bodied coffee flavors. The finish has a light bitterness to it from the hops along with some alcohol burn, but not too much.  M: 2010--Thick thick thick and creamy with low carbonation. This beer is like drinking dark chocolate, coffee, and bourbon flavored silk. 2011--About the same, though with a bit more bite from the hops and slightly more burn from the bourbon. Still amazing, though.  O: 2010--Overall, amazing. I was worried the coffee would fade too much or the bourbon would become too weak, but they are both still there and the beer is phenomenal even with a year on it. The coffee flavor is a bit less apparent and the bourbon a bit smoother than the 2011. 2011--Also amazing. So much delicious coffee and dark chocolate going on here with the bourbon very present but not overwhelming. The hops also provide a surprising kick towards the end.  In the end, I thought the 2011 would be far superior, but it's very close. Trying to pick a favorite is like trying to pick a favorite child. I think the fresh bottle has the slightest upper hand in the aroma, though I think I prefer the 2010 by just a hair in the flavor department for allowing more of the dark chocolate flavors to shine through. Regardless, I would take either vintage over any other imperial stout I've had any day of the week. I cannot say enough good about this beer--it truly is my favorite beer and I am someone who generally has difficulty listing my favorite of anything. Absolutely phenomenal.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Rich, strong espresso. Bourbon pulls its punches and plays second fiddle. Vanilla is strong throughout.  D: Big and boozy, but far from hot. This beer demands respect, one in done, but in the best possible way.  Overall: No doubt, this is a great beer. The flavours are complex and strong and the bourbon is perfectly attuned.

I have drank almost half of this tulip before even writing the review. So, so goddamn good.  A - Pours an incredible oil slick black with a one finger creamy mocha head that fades incredibly slowly for something with this much ABV. Not much in the way of lacing, but I expect that. There is a nice mocha halo when this does fade into the swirling cloud.  S - Coffee, bourbon, more coffee, and more bourbon. Some light burnt malts there as well but coffee and bourbon dominate the nose.  T - Wow, this is amazing. So much rich coffee flavours and strong, delicious bourbon notes. Some light vanilla and big alcohol flavours. With some age, letting the ABV mellow out, this stuff would be even more crazy.  M - Oh so thick and creamy and smooth. This is what stouts are supposed to feel like. So thick and delicious.  O - Yep, this stuff lives up to the hype. Just stellar aged stout.

1199,19960,GDBEERMAN,4.8,"12oz bottle into tulip. 2011 release. A: The vibrant, black body is deep and very dark, even held to the light this beer looks like a beast. The tan head resembles the color of the bottles label. The head formation pours a one finger thick froth. The retention falls quick, but is adequate for style. Lacing is minimal, but small amounts are left on the glass.  S: The aroma shows wonderful elements of all ingredients. The chocolate comes off strong, with a nice mellow note of coffee. The oak bourbon is present, but not overpowering. A medium to high intensity aroma, but again not tacky and overpowering. The aroma project a very smooth beer, by a well rounded, complex aroma.  T/M: The front of this brew shows a smooth, robust chocolate and coffee battle, the creamy body is second to none. Bourbon flavors a very subtle, as not to shadow any of the other complexities. An oatmeal mouthfeel texture builds the foundation for this big stout. The malt sweetness is very nice and helps to hide the high ABV. I find the coffee and chocolate notes to be at the fore front and would see how this beer is respectable fresh as well as a great one for aging.  O/D: This is a very drinkable high gravity stout, with great flavors and smooth body I could drink a couple of these. Seeing as it is ""highly acclaimed"" and treated like gold, I can see why now. Great brew.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,JLebowski,4.58,"A: This beer is black and beautiful, with a small amount of tasty-looking-head, could a stout be more beautiful? That question is rhetorical, the answer is no.  S: Bourbon and Vanilla and...nope, that's it.  T: A lot of Bourbon and Vanilla and a little coffee and chocolate, wow, just like the smell, how odd.... I don't drink much Bourbon, but I do sip on some Scotch, and this brew is wonderful  MF: Smooth and creamy with a little carbonation, fuck'n A.  D: As far as Stouts go, I have not had, nor can I imagine having, a Stout that is more drinkable.  To sum up this beer let me offer a quote from the once great ""former crack-head"" Lawrence Taylor:  ""It's the world of prostitution,"" he said during the Fox News interview.

1199,19960,BB1313,4.54,"2011 vintage. 12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a vicious black, no light getting though this one. Very thin mocha head and little lacing. This stuff is like motor-oil, no joke. Definitely one of the thickest beer I've come across. The aromas are heavy on the bourbon.. but then the strong milk chocolate will hit you w/ some vanilla. The bourbon is heavy in the flavor as well, almost diminishing all of the other flavors going on. This is a pretty complex brew. There's also nice oak/woodiness to this one, which is very noticeable in every sip. The coffee and tobacco is definitely present as well. Extremely boozy, almost too boozy, not letting the other flavors shine or develop. I can argue the flavors are unbalanced, but they work in the end. The mouthfeel is phenomenal, extremely thick and chewy. Practically no carbonation. Finishes warm, actually hot. Drinkability is okay.. this is a quintessential sipper, one's enough to please. KBS loses points from me for lacking balance in the flavor department.  KBS is a great beer. I'm not going to say it's over-hyped because it's an excellent beer. There's no denying its' complexity. It's definitely a treat.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ccm414,4.83,"Poured from the 12 oz bottle... thanks BeerMaverick!  A- Black. A little chocolate looking around the edges. Not much head, a little less than one finger. It disappears relatively quickly leaving some slight lace on the glass.  S- Not overwhelming but nice on the nose. Coffee notes that are nicely complimented with hints of chocolate. Sweet malt with heavy bourbon scents. Excellent combination!  T- Pure bliss. One of the best. Great coffee flavors with hints of chocolate and vanilla bean. The bourbon also really comes through in the perfect amount, has an almost spicy feel to it. Slight alcohol burn towards the finish, but its just the right amount that lingers. Very enjoyable.  M- Medium to heavier bodied beer here. Lightly carbonated. Coats the palate nicely and almost feels like it coats the entire mouth with a film of flavor.  D- Very drinkable. Can probably become dangerous at 11.2% abv. It has a nice drinkability with the pop from the bourbon.  Cheers!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,RTJakarta,4.83,"Pours a gorgeous dark brown, without much a head, and without much lacing. On the pour, this beer looks as thick as molasses. I'm not sure if I find this more intimidating or inviting. Definitely has me excited.  Smells mostly like chocolate and coffee to me. A little backdrop of bourbon. If I smell it really quickly, it almost smells like a tasty, tasty chocolate milk.  Holy mother of God, this is one of the tastiest beers I have ever had. Thick, rich chocolate-ty goodness. Definitely coffee, and a little bit of a bourbon-y taste. Myself, I'm not tasting much of a vanilla presence, but I'm not too mad about it.  Mouthfeel is a full, rich, and thick. After you start drinking this bad boy, it really sticks with you. I'm going to be happy having this linger in my mouth when I'm done.  Overall, I've been waiting for what seems like an eternity for this beer, and I'm so happy I finally got it. If you can't tell....I'm a huge fan just like everyone else.

S - Mmmm... get lots of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon. A great bouquet of flavors. Almost like a spiked chocolate milk!  T & M - Just like the smell but better. You get deep, dark, robust coffe and dark chocolate, with a kick of bourbon and a hint of vanilla. As it progresses, you get a little bit more bourbon and alcohol. Very smooth and drinkable for an 11.2% stout. You can't drink a lot of this or it will knock you on your ass, but wow is having one just amazing. Medium, chewy body with some rich sweetness.  Overall - glad I was able to score some of this during recent release. Well worth the wait. They should release this beer in the coldest part of winter, not at the beginning of spring in my opinion... this would best be enjoyed on a cold, dark, snowy night in front of a fire.

Smells first of coffee and chocolate and then lots of bourbon. This is a mouth watering mix of awesome.  Taste coffee is still present after a year of aging but is consumed by the tasty sweet vanilla, bourbon, and a little chocolate taste in the back.  Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Bourbon resin stick to the palate and stays but it bring its coffee friend along as well.  Drinkability is good. Such a smooth beer but the bourbon has a little to much pop after the coffee has faded. The 11.2 ABV is fine with me as I like to get a boozy kick after a half glass; it lets me relax and really lets me enjoy all that this brew has to offer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,zeledonia,4.67,"2011 vintage.  Lovely deep syrupy brown, with a cascading, frothy, abundant coffee-tan head that lasts and lasts. The head turns thick and pillowy as it subsides. Doesn't get much better than this.  Smell, which pours out of the bottle when you pop the cap, has coffee and chocolate up front, with strong bourbon notes and dark roasted malts. As it warms up the bourbon starts to come out more, with a nice sweetness in the background. Amazingly smooth and rounded for a loaded, barrel-aged imperial stout.  Been awaiting this first sip for a long time. Here we go. The bourbon is the first thing that hits, but it's not overpowering like it is in so many barrel-aged beers. Next come the smooth dark malts and a bit of chocolate, in a smooth transition. Finish has some bitter coffee. A touch of warming alcohol on the back end, but you have to look for it. The flavors bounce around in the mouth, coming in little mini-waves. As with many of my favorite beers, there are a lot of different things present here, but they all fit together quite well, with no single flavor dominating. I let it warm up a bit, and the bourbon came with a wallop. So in the future, I'm going to drink it a bit on the cold side to enjoy the other flavors.  Wow this is thick. It has a chewy, almost sludgy character, but still feels rather frothy and light in the mouth. Quite surprising. It doesn't feel like it coats and lingers as much as many thicker stouts do, but the flavors remain and continue to assert themselves for quite a while.  An all-around standout imperial stout. Great balance of bourbon, coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts (in that order), in both the nose and the mouth. This one lives up to its billing. I could drink quite a few, if it wouldn't knock me out. And btw, where's the alcohol? I don't even notice it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,NODAK,4.55,"Aroma upon opening is huge. Big notes of bourbon were initially apparent, giving way to coffee, dark chocolate and tons of sweet molasses. Very rich. As rich and thick as they come.  Pours perfectly black, with a thin dark coffee brown head.  Now for the taste. It's immediately evident that is very thick. Oily. A bit boozy in the front from the bourbon. Man, is that bourbon evident!! Most beers of this style don't come close. Next, the coffee this is brewed with is very noticeable, along with a good dose of chocolate and thick, molasses sweetness. Finishes with an alcoholic bite from the bourbon and with a little bitterness from the roasted malts. Basically, it's thick with coffee, chocolate and molasses upfront, with a boozy, roasted finish.  Definitely one of the thickest beers I've ever had. This is like a coffee and chocolate milkshake with bourbon in it. Lots of bourbon. For its high ABV, I'm very impressed by its drinkability. Give me this over most imperial stouts any day.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,StayWhatYouAre2,4.67,"2011 vintage poured from a 12oz bottle into a Central Waters snifter.  A- Very dark. Not quite pitch black, but the look of some very heavily used motor oil. A pretty hard pour only yields a half finger head that is caramel brown. There is some pretty sticky lacing that leaves some very nice patching.  S- When first poured the smell was heavily dark chocolate up front with hints of sweet bourbon, bold roasted coffee and vanilla. As the beer begins to warm the bourbon takes center stage as the dark chocolate joins the coffee and vanilla in the back seat. The smell of alcohol only intensifies as time goes on and takes on the presence of oak as it warms.  T- Very bold dark, bitter chocolate hits you right up front as you take your first sip just as it does in the smell. As the beer sits on your palate and reaches the back there is plenty of warm, mellow bourbon that finishes with a sweet vanilla and roasted coffee. Much like the smell, as the beer warms the flavor of bourbon and coffee become stronger and stronger until they almost match the flavor of the strong flavor of dark chocolate.  M- Very smooth and balanced. Definitely one of the most mellow bourbon flavors I have tasted in a beer with this alcohol content. Carbonation is low, as expected, and the finish is drying.  D- The beer as a whole has a very rich flavor and should not be drank as a session beer, but rather a sipping dessert beer on special occasions (unless you were lucky enough to get more than a case). Very worth seeking out if not available in your area.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,aficionado,4.72,"Jet black body with a 1 finger caramel colored head and low lacing.  Pleasant, mellow bourbon aromas that don't hurt your sinuses when inhaled. Freshly made dark chocolate fills up the nose as if you were a chocolatier in a bakery. The same goes for the quality coffee aromas as if you were a Barista in a coffee shop. Some mild vanilla on the back end to bolster the rest of the aromas.  Decadent Belgian bittersweet dark chocolate, roasty bitter espresso, real Madagascar vanilla beans, and the most smooth bourbon flavor I've ever encountered. Simple, but extremely well executed.  Quite smooth indeed given the alcohol content, the richness, the low carbonation, the thick mouthfeel, the sweetness and the bourbon notes. I would love to brew this, but I doubt I could pull it off without decades of practice. It's very drinkable. The head brewer and all of his relatives are quite possibly the luckiest beer drinkers in America.  2012 update:  Drinking this again in a Chimay Chalice. Not too cold.  More sweet dark chocolate this year with a decent amount of bitter espresso. The vanilla and oak are tamed and balanced like always. Smells a little hotter than the taste. Smooth, creamy, lush mouthfeel.  In the past 3 years, I preferred 2010 &gt; 2011 &gt; 2012.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,weatherdog,4.25,"2011 12oz. bottle poured into a Bells tulip glass  It pours a nearly pitch black with a 1 finger head rising from the depths of the beer. Retention is medium and a minimal amount of lacing lines the glass. Impressive head formation and retention for a 11%+ beer  The nose is a hodgepodge of sweet bourbon, chocolate and roasted coffee. The coffee and chocolate fade towards the end and a little nose hair tingling alcohol aroma wafts up.  In the taste the chocolate isn't as present but up front a medium strong roasted coffee. The barreling then becomes very evident with a strong dose of vanilla and then a nice smooth bourbon taste. The finish is a hint too strong in the alcohol burn down the throat, but I'm sure that'll age out.  The body seems very thinned out by the bourbon, not thick and viscous in the least. Carbonation is medium low. There is also the alcohol burn previously mentioned. I really just prefer more body in an Imperial Stout.  I've had this a number of times and am just getting around to reviewing it. While I do like this beer and think it's great, it's just never been world class to me.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,weizenbob,4.74,"2011 vintage, 12 ounce bottle, no bottle date, poured into a large wine goblet.  A very aggressive pour yields about half a finger of dark mocha head. Retention is low, which is unsurprising given this stout's alcohol content. Sticky lacing leaves small patches on the glass. The brew is very dark, though not quite pitch black. I loved the color of the head but I wish it could have held on longer.  Though KBS is supposedly a different base beer than regular Breakfast Stout, the aroma is reminiscent of that brew. Like Breakfast Stout, KBS is also brewed with chocolate and coffee. Like Breakfast Stout, those scents are very prominent and literal in the nose. There is a trace amount of oak to be noticed but for all practical purposes the aroma is dominated by chocolate and alcohol. Regardless of whether or not it is the same beer as Breakfast Stout, it smells delicious.  Then came the first sip. At the expense of sounding like a Founders fanboy, I think my mouth just had an orgasm. A quick glance in the mirror confirms that I am indeed making the ""oh"" face. Make no mistake; this is NOT the same beer as Breakfast Stout. Flavors are full and wonderfully blended. Chocolate is forward on the tongue with a sweetness reminiscent of raisins. There is a beautifully smooth alcohol presence. It's very noticeable but also quite mellow for a stout of this strength. A year in bourbon barrels has done this beer good. The result is greater than the sum of the parts.  The mouthfeel is incredible. Everything about this beer has blended together into one unified smooth caress of the mouth. The body is heavy; the carbonation is mild, and the alcohol is velvety. The weight is perfect and this stout is unbelievably smooth.  Unfortunately, 11.2% ABV does not a drinkable stout make. This beer smells, tastes and feels amazing, but the alcohol content and overall cost make this prohibitive to session drinking. That's not a huge worry however as this is very much a dessert brew; and one 12 ounce bottle is more than enough for one sitting. This is really quite an astoundingly constructed beer.  ---  The Two Schlitz Scale: (see my profile for an explanation) This bottle cost almost as much as a six-pack of Schlitz and it was completely worth it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Satchboogie,4.53,"12oz bottle (2011) poured into a balloon snifter:  A: Pours completely pitch black, absolutely no light gets through this. I got just over a finger of mocha brown head that was really frothy and actually took a good couple minutes to dissipate.  S: Chocolate fudge, coffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak. The flavors are just bursting from the glass.  T: First thing out of my mouth (and repeated quite a lot) was ""WOW!"". Chocolate fudge with vanilla is really the best description for the overall base of this beer. I don't get as much alcohol in the taste as was suggested in the nose (fine by me). First thing is that awesome chocolate followed by vanilla and sweet bourbon. The bourbon flavor is no where near overpowering, it just adds another dimension and brings the nice oak and vanilla sweetness, not just that boozy alcohol taste like many other bourbon barrel ales have. There's a bit of medium roast coffee in the background and I get a nice bit of earthiness as well, I'm not sure if it's from the high-quality coffee used or the barrel. There seems to be just a hint of dark fruits in the background towards the finish. Tons of dark roasted malt, though not charred. Finish is dry and just a little warm, getting mostly chocolate, vanilla and oak. I'm shocked just how little alcohol is apparent, again you get mainly the flavor of the bourbon, not the alcohol burn. Just an incredibly delicious, balanced, and deeply complex flavor profile.  M: Medium carbonation to low, just enough to give a little ""umph"" in the middle. This is very thick and chewy, close to TenFidy thick. Very smooth and luscious, it coats the entire mouth and slides down the back of the throat with ease. The barrel did a hell of a job smoothing this out, it's velvet. Probably the best texture behind '11 Kate.  O: Does this live up to the hype? Absolutely. I can honestly say this was even better than I imagined, and I had high expectations. Probably the most perfectly balanced bourbon barrel aged stout. When I first tried a BCBS, I thought it we be perfect if the heat was turned down (in a year old bottle), the bourbon was less boozy and overpowering, and with a little more depth/complexity. KBS is the beer with those improvements, in my eyes, the perfect balanced bourbon barrel aged beer.

1199,19960,jsulko,5,Bottle poured into a snifter  Thanks to a coworker for finding it at his local place.  Pours a very dark almost black coffee color with slight redness at the edges.  Taste  Bourbon comes out prominent in intial tasting. As the beer warms up the coffe and chocolate undertones appear with the coffee being slightly more pronounced. Didn't think I would like it as I am not a coffee fan but the flavors worked well together.  Finishes with a bitter aftertaste. Very smooth.  Dind't know if this would live up to the hype.

1199,19960,veinless,4.74,"Big, huge thanks to ChadQuest for generously sending me a bottle of this in our trade; Chad you are a sick trader!  Vintage: 2010  Pours a borderline slimy viscous oily jet black. Head is nonexistent. This is a bottle of shadow, and looks as dark as any beer I've ever seen. Light mahogany bubbles at the edges are the only sign of any carbonation. I guess this is what to expect from an enormous stout like this.  Nose is just incredible. Sweet vanilla bourbon is perfectly weighted to not ever be too sweet or harsh, while milk chocolate fudge adds to the ice cream sundae package. Nutmeg and spice are also present. What perfectly summarizes this is my brother's homemade eggnog in the winter except better balanced and with more chocolate. Flawless.  The taste follows the smell exactly, offering an awesome combination of stronger bourbon flavors, vanilla/chocolate milkshake and new found coffee bitterness at the finish. This has to be one of the finest dessert beers out there. Nutmeg and cinnamon add to the holiday chocolate delight and give the beer further dessert quality. The bourbon is stronger here than in the nose, but not so much so that it dominates the other flavors. Woody flavor bursts through as the beer warms to complete the picture at the finish.  Smooth, creamy, viscous, and syrupy, this beer ticks all the boxes a big stout should. When I swish it it feels like I have Hershey's Chocolate Syrup in my mouth. Drinkability is good, as you wouldn't find me complaining about eating ice cream sundaes. Everything is balanced well enough that the sweetness and bourbon don't get out of hand. I can see the flavors perhaps leaving a mark after a couple of these though (along with the fact that the smell is good enough it makes you not want to drink the beer). The alcohol is definitely a bit too strong to make this a quick drinker, but as a sipper it's great. Definitely could see this becoming a perfect drinker with age, but for now, even after a year of age, I have to say it doesn't match its smell, taste, or mouthfeel in this category.

Since their supply was so short, a two bottle limit was imposed by the owner. Hey, I'm not complaining, I'm celebrating!  I poured KBS at about 60F into a New Belgium globe. (Don't be a hater of the globe 'cause they be good glasses.) Body of thick black darkness topped by deep caramel tan somewhat disappointing (yet velvety) thin, scant head creating minimal lace. Bubbles so tiny I can barely see them which is a good thing hinting of the creaminess to follow. Was hoping for some good froth, but whatever.  The aromas are amazing here - dark roast coffee beans and cocoa up front followed by vanilla, a mild woody booze, and notes of chewy caramel malts. Hops are in deep, but it's there. Very nice. Seems we're in for a treat.  Coffee right outta the shute. Then huge vanilla notes permeate the palate as milky chocolate bleeds through. Following is slightly warming bourbon woodiness and caramel chewiness. Probably the complex shades I've ever experienced in a beer. Good god, man, that's just fantastic!  Love the feel - silky, chewy, thick and dry at the same time. More complexity!  KBS lives up to the hype. There's just so much going in a glass of KBS.

S: Big, Bold, Beautiful - A balance of sweet bourbon, a little more bourbon, charred oak woodiness, coffee, and a bit of chocolate. Didn't pickup on the vanilla, but perhaps it was lost in the bourbon.  T: Kickass layers of awesome. Bourbon starts the dance and is quickly joined by thick dark chocolate, rich coffee, and sweet vanilla (ahh vanilla, I missed you in the nose, but so glad you joined the party) alcohol adds a nice bit of warm spice to the mix. Finish is slighty dry bitter chocolate and splash of bourbon goodness.  M: A hot big bodied beer with thick ankles. The alcohol doesn't hide but doesn't need to as the rest of the components have no problem playing their parts. A super smooth sipper.  O: This tastes like a lil' chuck of vanilla fudge bathed in bourbon then covered in a thick layer of dark chocolate and dipped in bourbon again for good measure.

Swirling leaves a light brown coating on the glass. The visuals convey an attitude of ""okay, let's get on the important stuff already.""  S - The nose isn't as huge as I thought it'd be. Clearly the bourbon is the emphasis but Founders didn't go for broke and did a great job of avoiding overkill here. Everything secondary to the bourbon is subtle and points to complexity - coffee beans (of course), chocolate, caramel, and a *very* slight roasted -almond- quality.  T - More of the same notes as the nose in a similar mellow fashion. A bourbon focus/emphasis on the front end with secondary character following closely behind. The mellow nature of this brew is really something to behold. Founders gives you the flavors as advertised and does so in a truly relaxed manner. KBS exudes craft in every aspect of the taste. Bourbon gets more prominent as the drink reaches room temp; this was neither better nor worse for me.  M - Not quite as expected. Not completely full and not at all chewy. Medium body, average carbonation that doesn't really come through until the backend of the drink.  D - Incredibly drinkable. Absolutely no ABV presence, not even when room temp. Honestly, I feel like the slightly-thinner body contributes to a higher drinkability for this particular brew. It doesn't drink like any other stout I've had. It wasn't really necessary to sip this one beyond trying to savor my 6-7 oz.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,gopens44,3.7,"Purchased at Wine and Beer Westpark for $5.50 per 12 oz. bottle  A - Poured black into a snifter. Head was about 1/2"" worth of brown fizzyness.  S - Thing only real stand out smell at first was that of whiskey. A few moments later I could start to smell the coffee come out pretty well.  T - When I used to work 3rd shift, I'd make myself a coffee with Jim Beam in it with just a little sugar before I went to bed. This tastes EXACTLY like that. Coffee with whiskey and a touch sweet. The only difference here was a slight hint of dark chocolate coming across after the palate adjusts to the whiskey.  M - Smooth and not as dry as I would have thought. Aftertaste of coffee lay on the tongue for a bit, forcing a serious water drinking frenzy.  O - I love the taste of whiskey, and had been let down by other beers touting ""whiskey barrel"" before, but this one delivers exactly what it was billed as. If I ever want a beer that has a heavy whiskey presence, I'll grab this one first (if I ever find it again).

1199,19960,rapidsequence,4.65,"This is a side by side tasting of a 2010 and 2011 KBS. This years was $5.15 from Pints O'Plenty. I'll describe both beers, but the ratings will be for the 2011.  Appearance: Both beers pour totally black. Thin dark brown head on the 2011 with about 1 minute of retention. The 2010 has no head. Both create nice spotty lacing and some legs with each sip. Dark and forboding.  Smell: Roasty chocolatey malt, oaky vanilla and bourbon, day old cold coffee. The 2010 is much more chocolatey and much less coffee-y. The bourbon notes also seem to integrate better in the 2010. Both are excellent.  Taste: Lots of bourbon and coffee flavor with chocolate coming in later. Vanilla and a little caramel flavor in there too. Very little roasted bitterness until the finish, but there is a little bitter alcohol burn in the middle. The finish and aftertaste is like a mocha. The 2010 is very different, where, like the smell, the coffee notes are somewhat muted and chocolate and caramel notes are more dominant. The bourbon flavor is much less harsh, but still dominant and prominent.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and creamy. Full and wonderful. I think the 2010 is actually a little better than the 2011.  Drinkability: I love this stuff. In 2008 you could walk into a bottle shop and buy a half case 2 weeks after release, now I'm glad to get 4 bottles the day it comes in. Letting it sit for a year is a challenge, but its worth it. Its almost perfect fresh though.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Bourbon, oak, chocolate, almost like theres a shot of Bailey's Irish Creme in it. Wooow.  Taste: Chocolate, oak, bourbon... tiny bit of Coffee on the finish. Much more chocolate this year than the '10. God, so amazing. Such a complex and amazing beer.  Mouthfeel: Creamy mouthfeel, thick, just wonderful.

1199,19960,stonermouse,4.7,"Lucky score at Boston Wine Exchange. Big thanks. 2011 vintage.  Poured the whole bottle into a Sam Adams glass.  Looks like a heavily brewed, perhaps day old pot of Columbian dark roast. Head doesn't hang out too long, but lacing is sticky and nice.  Smell is a little tempered, but coffee-forward. There's a bit of burnt sawdust in the aroma, which isn't off-putting, but is instead rather interesting. I don't sense any booziness yet.  Flavor is quite a complex wallop. I can't believe the complexity here. While it was still cool, it was boozy and bourbony, comparable to Backwoods Bastard. As it warms, chocolate really takes over. The heat never goes away, but intensifies every flavor I taste. The coffee in the aroma is present, and adds a super base for this brew.  Mouthfeel is viscous, and the aftertaste is bitter and dry (could be the hops, but probably more due to the coffee). Just perfect for the flavors.  Sweet fancy Moses, I could bathe in this stuff. Just great. My remaining three bottles are surely special occasion-type brews, and I'd love to shelve at least one of these suckers for a couple years to mellow them out a bit. But fresh, it's still phenomenal. Off the tap must be heavenly.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,AlCaponeJunior,4.71,"Was able to get a single four pack of the latest 2011 batch. True to the hype, this one didn't disappoint.  Very dark, black with tinges of brown and red, one finger dark brown head and decent lacing. Not all that impressive to look at.  Smell is like a sweet milk chocolate bar with just a touch of cappuccino. It's a bit leathery with a touch of vanilla and woody, earthy background aromas. You can detect the bourbon and the barrels it was aged in, adding a nice touch.  Taste is quite exceptional. Wonderfully strong, yet balanced, vanilla blended with smooth milk chocolate is the first thing I noticed. There's a touch of coffee but it's not the predominant flavor. Smooth bourbony wood flavors accent but don't overpower. Smoky malts are complimented by just a touch of hops. It's very sweet but there's also a touch of bitterness. Fantastic brew that totally does live up to the hype.  Feel is very smooth, slick, full bodied, with a lingering sweet vanilla and chocolate aftertaste.  Drink is fantastic. Off the charts for the style, and wonderful for any beer in any category. I love this beer!  MAKE MORE of this beer already. Struggling to get a four pack or two once a year really sucks. I have not been the biggest founder's fan so far, but this one I would buy all the time if I could.  Updated 4th july, on the 2020 batch... Wouldn't change a thing.

1199,19960,Rhettroactive,4.55,"From 12oz bottle to Bruges hybrid glass on 3/17/11 - Vintage 2011 *From notes  A: It's like someone turned off the lights with this one. Look up the word black in the dictionary and you'll see a bottle of KBS. Supremely elegant 2+ finger bubbly head that looks like whipped motor oil. Thick lacing rims the glass throughout.  S: Sweet vanilla bean and woody, dark, smokey char. The bourbon makes a move and really sears the nostrils.  T: Wow - there is so much happening here it's crazy. Bourbon, really smooth and slightly sweet whiskey. This compliments the vanilla essence which shows up on the mid-palate. Freshly roated coffee and 70% dark cocoa nibs finish this one out and linger on the back of the tonsils for minutes on end. As it warms, the bourbon and 11.2% alcohol really come through.  M: In one word, it's perfect. Like a carbonated, bourbony, chocolate & coffee milkshake. I can't think of another beer that feels quite like KBS. So rich and immensely creamy. Just delicious.  O: Founders KBS is simply a marvelous brew. It's so well put together, perfectly balanced and utterly drinkable. This heavenly nectar is liquid crack.  I have no qualms that this '11 vintage will age beautifully. I can't wait to find out.

1199,19960,Smakawhat,4.85,"Poured from the bottle into my large Dogfish head snifter, fresh as can be, patiently reserved in line for a simple four pack to be consumed and reviewed. This is my milestone, and my 300th review on Beer Advocate. Much thanks to the brothers. Onward...  Off the visible pour it is borderline motor oil black out of the bottle but not quite... Head is very solid and cocoa light brown I would say with a good solid retention. After falling for LOTS of time (having consumed two of these in one sitting) it maintains a collar that will not go away. The body is my personal favorite walnut brown, but just wants to hint... I mean just hint at black midnight. Based on all that... she looks great. Decent lacing giving up to leopardy like spotting.  Bouquet is jarring for this style and a big surprise considering the abv in front. DRY husky grain, faint dried out wood, not a wood smell that I could pinpoint (regardless that they come from American oak bourbon barrels). The sense is something tannic is coming even though you DO NOT smell tannins. It strangely (dare I say it) feels like fresh cut timber or assembled oak furniture. Very dense and full of body. Some simple cheap store bought coffee also. Extremely unique smelling and balance.. really nice. When I smell these aromas, they feel like I am tasting and drinking this beverage as it is. Cellar like smell with a dampness that isn't ruined, musty, no not BAD.. just down there.... DANK DANK DANK!!!! Chocolate milk bent on the nose. No sense of heat or big booze coming for this large ABV.  Taste is well, stealing something from the vocabulary.. exceptional when factoring the mouthfeel. Almost silky but SOoooo... easy palatable and borderline wet in feel. Big milk chocolate front but not turning into a sweet chocolate bomb. Sweetness hints, faint standard coffee, but extremely balanced profile. Slight tannins in the mouth pushing forward and puckering, it is dry I will give it that but tolerable. What is not here for me on taste just for the record is tobacco and fruit. Vanilla for me personally .... creeps up unknowingly then takes over. It's not apparent at first but then makes it's presence known latter while drinking. This is not a beer that feels particularly like whiskey either. It's not bourbon feeling at all (I have a bias being a bourbon drinker) but that is a good thing this is truly a great beer, and the highly masked abv boozy quality that you would think came from this is completely hidden. This should be considered beer forward and not whiskey. The chocolate and vanilla mix gets into almost ice cream territory, with much fun. This could pass easily as a dessert beer for sure but works also on its own.. So stupidly easy drinking, creamy, almost dark chocolate, balanced soft tannins, woody, FROTHY, too much to desire.  Overall some serious intense craft and quality while drinking this. This is magic right here, and some great feel. Just for the record the high abv on this is dangerous cause I feel like I could just pound these back like no tomorrow. Part of that stupid drinkability, besides all this sophistication and time put into it, is that it feels like a kids morning chocolate breakfast drink, such as Carnation Instant Breakfast drink. Does this beer taste like bourbon... NO. Emphatically no giving way to a good magic that is masking the alcohol.. It is just a great tasting beer and very unique and done superbly.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Big coffee, nice amount of vanilla, chocolate, and yes of course, bourbon. The bourbon is really nice, not too heavy, just right. Nutty sweetness.  Taste: Creamy palate. Coffee and bourbon are the defining flavors, followed closely by vanilla and chocolate. Great roast body, followed by wonderful creamy sweetness. The taste is wonderful.  Mouth: So rich and creamy. It truly is a wonderful beer. The vanilla give it a great feel, with a good after taste, and staying power.  Drink and Overall: Such a great beer. It was nice to do a side by side with the Peruvian Morning. The Peruvian Morning is a solid beer, and very similar in all respects. Almost like the little brother of KBS. The PV brings alot of nose to it, but the KBS has much better body and much more flavor. A really top quality beer. It deserves to be in the top ten.

Some vanilla and bourbon and alcohol.  T: See above. KBS' characteristics are quite distinct and close to working against one another. Almost harsh because the flavors are so young and strong. Finish is long and bitter.  M: Oatmeal reveals itself in mouthfeel: full and creamy. I detect something off, too, something like powdered chocolate. Alcohol warming, but that doesn't surprise me.

1199,19960,FanofHefe,4.85,"2011 version, bottled on 2/25/11. Poured into a Duvel tulip. Pitch black body with zero light penetration. Surprisingly (for such a high abv) it yields a one-finger dark mocha head that leaves just a little lacing on the glass.  The first aromas present are bourbon and chocolate. As I work my way down the glass, I get more of the roasted malt and just a touch of the coffee notes. Very well-blended scents that do not seem overly sweet or harsh. Very inviting.  The flavor is incredible. More coffee flavor comes through in the taste as compared to the aroma. None of the flavors are overbearing in the least. Bourbon, chocolate, and roasted malt combine with the coffee to a near perfection. It is sweet enough to be enjoyable. The slight bitterness seems attributable to the coffee more than hops, but it also has the exact right amount of bitterness.  The mouthfeel is medium and silky smooth. The alcohol is hidden very well by the abundant flavors. I saved a bottle from last year's release and am looking forward to a comparison. I'm certain this only gets better with age.

Very little to no hop flavor.  Mouthfeel: Seemed sort of thin to me, but I think I liked it that way.  Overall: Way to drinkable for a beer of this strength.

I must say that 2011 Nitro was more appealing to me than 2011 Regular...in terms of beer ratings/reviews. 2009 on tap was the superior brew that day in a vertical comparison with '09, '10, '11, nitro-'11.  Direct short hand notes:  A: Sticky lacing, very black and mocha head. S: So much Toffee, caramel, dark chocolate, and heath bar. T: Espresso, toffee, bourbon, and dark chocolate.

1199,19960,russwbeck,4.47,"2011 Vintage enjoyed on 3/18/11  A: Pour is completely black. Not much of a mocha head appearing, even with a rough pour. 4  S: The Bourbon isn't dominating in the smell, which is very balanced. Lots of coffee, toasty malts, chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon mingling amongst some alcohol. 4.5  T: The taste is phenomenally interesting. Not quite what I was expecting. The coffee is truly the dominating factor. Chocolatey bourbon leads the taste off, but it recedes to a big coffee taste. A slight booziness sits throughout. 4.5  MF: A little on the lighter side, as far as imperial stouts go. It has a creaminess to it, however. Alcohol is noted, but not overpowering. Aftertaste is dry. 4.5  O: Very drinkable for 11%, but not the end all be all of bourbon aged beers. 4.5  2012 Vintage enjoyed side by side with a 2011 Vintage on 5/6/12 (2011 review / 2012 review)  A: Surprisingly the 2011 has a better head. Both come out of their respective bottles deep black with a nice brown head. 2012 has a thin head, but 2011 has a finger or two. The retention on both is pretty average, but the 2011 seems to lace better. (4.5 / 4)  S: Both vintages have a big chocolate character that provides the base for the rest of the beer. Not surprisingly, 2012 has a much more robust coffee aroma, but it is not lost on the 2011. I'm getting some roasted malts on the 2011, whereas all of the roast in the 2012 comes from coffee. The bourbon notes are pretty similar, and secondary to the aforementioned aromas. Neither are boozy, but the 2011 is a tad more thin than 2012. (4 / 4.5)  T: The tastes really differ, which surprises me based on how similar the other characteristics are. I'll start with 2011, which obviously has mellowed out a little bit. Smooth, sweet chocolate blends with some light bourbon, vanilla, and slight hints of coffee at the very end. Some roasted malts tickle in as well. The taste is sweet and decadent, but without a ton of bourbon. I don't hate that it's not there, but I do wish it had more. The 2012 has some booze noted. The chocolate is not as pervasive as it is for the older vintage. There's a dry coffee aftertaste, but the coffee isn't huge. The bourbon and vanilla starts to be noted somewhere in the middle of the taste, and lasts through the finish. Again, I wish it had more bourbon in it, but the taste isn't unbalanced. The 2011 is better in my opinion. Glad I still have a few left to see what another year will do to it! (4.5 / 4)  MF: I think I like the mellowed 2011 better than the more in your face mouthfeel of the 2012. Both are thick and go down really smooth, but the booze has been curbed by the year in the cellar on the 2011 and I think it has improved the mouthfeel. Both are crazy drinkable for an 11% ABV beer, however. (4.5 / 4.5)  O: These are both phenomenal beers, but I liked the aged version better in almost every aspect. I do think the coffee was too understated in the 2012 batch, and that the bourbon should be more prominent in every batch of KBS, but overall it's a wonderfully thought out beer. I hope the increase in batch size next year doesn't hurt the quality because I hope to enjoy these for many years to come.

Coffee, chocolate, and slight bitterness toward the end of the sip, which I am guessing could be from the bourbon barrel aging. I didn't expect the bourbon barrel aging to be so subtle. I am usually not the biggest fan of ba's, but this one doesn't even remind me of one because its so balanced. Good carbonation and medium to heavy body.

S - Good amount of bourbon on the first draw with a sweet, malty background of chocolate, caramel and coffee. It's almost like smelling a sweet, chocolatey glass of whiskey.  T - The taste here is so complex it's hard to decipher it all. Of course the bourbon is there ,along with with the chocolate and roasted coffee. Some slight notes of vanilla cream and dark fruits as well. I do, however, feel like the bourbon should play more of a supporting role than what I'm tasting here, I don't think it's full masking the flavors, but it's a little too dominant.  M - Very creamy and smooth with a good body. A bit of heat from the alcohol hits the back of the throat. Good amount of carbonation present.

1199,19960,phiberoptik,4.73,"2011 Batch 12oz bottle. I picked it up from the store an hour after it was delivered. Yes, I know, I should have been there an hour earlier.  Pours like used motor oil, just how I love my stouts. Leaves a mocha head with definite lacing. You can tell this beer has body just by the pour.  I am going to reserve the right to edit this on my second tasting because I need a better glass to get more aromas centralized to my nose and my hands smell like soap so its throwing me off when I try to cup it. I definitely get strong dark chocolate notes, there is no surprise there. It also reminds me of my french press after I brew coffee in the morning... the aroma of the used grounds. I get a slight hint of sweetness from the bourbon also, but not as much as I expected (first time KBS tasting).  I LOVE the taste of this beer. Any imperfection that I might have found in my DORIS tasting, I feel like its made up here. I hate to swing on the hype of this beer but it really really hits all the points that I want a great beer to hit. Burnt coffee, dark cocoa, and great nuances of bourbon with the heat of alcohol following. I expected more bourbon, for being in the barrels for a year and comparing it to our local Listermann's Cincinnati, which is predominantly bourbon based flavors.  This is a silky smooth across the mouth and very controlled as you would expect a beer thats been aging for a year. I cannot wait to try it a year from now and another year after that.  Highly highly drinkable from the enjoyability factor but not from the price or alcohol factor. At $21 a 4-pack and 11.2% alcohol, you would be wasting good beer to drink more than a couple of these in a row. You might as well replace it with a lesser beer and save good beer and money!  I just wish this came out more than once a year.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Dan3279,4.77,"Perfection in a bottle, thats the first thing that comes to mind. Worth the wait and worth the hype. I recently fell in love with the regular Breakfast Stout and this beer is a totally different beast.  Poured pitch black into a snifter glass. The smell hits you rigt away mainly of coffee and vanilla.  I can go on and on about the taste but to me it comes off as being very balanced. There is a lot going on here when it hits your mouth. You notice the coffee & vanilla and then the bourbon. To me you would never guess that the ABV is as high as it is.  You can tell that it is a heavier drink when it first hits your mouth but at the same time it is very easy to drink, though its something that you want to take your time and really enjoy the drink.  I was very lucky to get my hands on a four pack and I hope to find one more.  Very worthy of the hype, and is in league of its own.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,sugeknight6289,4.75,"12oz 2011 bottle of KBS poured into snifter.  Apperance: Pours jet-black mud. Not even dark red hues from the light can be seen through this beast, only my reflection. 1 finger of brown, creamy mocha head sticks around but then gets pushed to the sides of the glass from the 11.2%. Decent lacing left behind.  Aroma: Dominant bourbon, with hints of vanilla behind. Also, strong cofee notes and a rich dark chocolate character lingering in the background.  Taste: Coffee playing the role in the beginning of the tongue, followed by dark, creamy chocolate in the center. The vanilla and bourbon dance down the back of the throat, with warm alcohol heat. Wow how all these flavors are so well integrated and balanced its amazing, they each compliment one another. So warming in the stomach. A bourbon cappucino!  Mouthfeel: Smooth, creamy medium bodied. I expected it to be full bodied, but this only heightens the drinkability. Just right amount of carbonation too. This beer would be perfect to sit around the fire on a cool, summer night.  Overall: But be careful, this delicious, dessert-like brew will come out of the backwoods and knock you on your ass. Worth the hype and every penny too.

Once in the glass things took a dramatic upturn. Filled the glass black with a slight hint of brown around the edges and a thin head that left some very nice lacing. Smells of heavy roasting, smokey, woody, coffee, chocolate and booze. First taste was bitter heavily roasted coffee and soon the flavor of the wood started to come through along with the bourbon. Despite my wife's disapproval I am a swisher. Every few sips I like swishing around and with this beer I got some tingling on the gums but going back to first impressions I thought it was a little thin for a stout but still very good overall... For the hype and the price I would refrain from going in search of this again but I would casually pick it up if found randomly somewhere and is a great treat and hope it ages well...",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Vanilla, Milk Chocolate, Bourbon, and a mild scent of coffee flood my nose. I spent a solid 2 minutes holding to the glass to my face and inhaling.  T: Vanilla and chocolate assault my mouth. Coffee comes mere moments after followed by the wonderful taste of bourbon. A lovely oak finish. I could drink this all day.

1199,19960,walteez,4.75,"My notes from a vertical tasting of KBS 2010 & 2011.  Both beers poured the same black, viscous, liquid with a very thin light brown head. The 2010 had a lot more bourbon on the nose and little less coffee, while the 2011's coffee masked the bourbon scent a bit more. The chocolate scent was underlying in both brews.  Down to the good part. 2010 KBS was so smooth, very creamy, chocolate tasting & sweet. It's still very roasty and malty but the coffee was only an afterthought here with just a hint up front with the bourbon. Not a lot of carbonation here either. This beer was all chocolate, much sweeter than a fresh bottle & a lot less harsh going down with just a hint of alcohol warmth at the end.  2011 breaks the ice with a nice rush of coffee and roasted malts on the initial sip. The chocolate lingers mid taste but with a much stronger roasted malt flavor than the 2010. It is a stout but still comes in at 70 IBUs - the end of the taste finishes with some bitterness but still very, very malty.  I've got to say I'm all in favor of fresh KBS. I like the bite it has & although it isn't as smooth, I think the older bottle was just a little too chocolate & sweet for me - not enough coffee. It's still a spectacular beer from either year & I've still got 1 2010 left to do a 3 year vertical next year but I gotta say - drink it fresh!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,mellowmark,5,"Poured from a 12 oz. stubby brown bottle to an Oversized Wine glass. 2011 vintage. $16.99 for a 4-pack.  Appearance: Black as night with a dark and I mean dark brown 1-finger creamy head. No transparency in the liquid whatsoever. Head retention is moderate. Great lacing, thick rings.  Smell: Bourbon barrels for sure. It's very very woody with sweet brown sugar undertones. Roasted freshly ground coffee. Dark and milk chocolate really start to come out as it warms, like a fine bourbon chocolate Belgian truffle. Very little alcohol is detectable, if any. Some earthy tones, like fresh cut grass. I could go on. It's phenomenal.  Taste: Sweet up front, mild bitterness in the middle. No sign of the booze until the end leaving a pleasant warming sensation in the back of the throat and in the chest. Citrus comes through towards the end and plays around for a little while leaving your mouth juicy and wanting more. Chocolate and roasted coffee flavors are present. Vanilla bean. Earthy hops come through at the end. Fine bourbon and smoked wood dance on your palate till the next sip.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is full and extremely creamy due to a low carbonation level. This really is a perfect mouthfeel. Absolutely zero harshness for such a big beer must not be easy to pull off. The flavor and nose express themselves even more as the beer warms without adding any of harshness attributed to some other IS's when consumed at higher temperatures.  Drinkability: Very High  This should be more of a sipper than it is. The smoothest and most disguised AD/IS I ever recall drinking, with an amazingly complex nose and flavor up the wazoo. Well worth the wait and the money. I feel like I am ripping THEM off.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,drpdaddy,4.92,"After numerous phone calls and a bunch of stops at different bottle shops, I slowly pour into a snifter. Black as night color, giving way to chocolaty head which quickly dissipates and leaves slight lacing. Aromas of chocolate, wood, bourbon, and faint malt. The taste is second to none, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, oak, with a cohesive coffee flavor pulling everything together. The booze is apparent but melds well with the other flavors and definitely adds to the enjoyment of this beer rather the detracting from it. Mouthfeel is exactly like I remember it to be, silky, creamy, with a touch of carbonation... Overall this is one exceptional stout and well deserving of all its accolades, I just hope I can find some more because I see myself wanting to revisit this one very soon.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ElGrecoVerde,4.82,"Look: Completely black. Medium brown head with redish hue.  Smell: Monstrous and inviting. Heavy doses of coffee, cocoa, vanilla, and burnt sugars.  Taste: Incredible blend of roasted coffee, smooth and bitter dark chocolate, and molasses. Vanilla bean, hints of maple and rich wood flavors compliment well. This brew does a great job of focusing heavily on a limited number of flavors, perfecting them, and overwhelming you with just those rather than adding to the complexity.  Feel: Very smooth and creamy. Fits the style and the flavors well.  Wonderful beer that lives up to the hype, and around here, there was a lot of hype.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,output01x,4.89,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  An extremely vigorous pour yields only a 0.5-finger light milk chocolate colored head. The body itself appears pure black with no real traces of color noticable when held to light. After a few minutes the head recedes into a thin film but leaves very little lacing on the glass.  Bourbon. Good, strong, boozy bourbon. And then some dark chocolate followed by more boozy bourbon.  Coffee, chocolate, and bourbon all assault your tastebuds simultaneously. Every sip brings both chaos and harmony.  Heavy body but moderate carbonation lets this beer creep into every nook and cranny of your mouth with each sip. Then once you think it is over, the bourbon warmth comes travelling back from the deepest reaches of your throat.  This is definitely not a beer for a hot summer day, nor is it a beer for a dorm party. Instead, this is a beer that loves to be slowly sipped on and wouldn't mind a thoughtful pairing with a fine cheddar or a strong cigar.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Sticky sporadic lacing. S: Smells a lot like Woodford Reserve, my favorite bourbon to begin with vanilla and oak. Then comes dark and milk chocolate as well as coffee/espresso. Nice boozy character. T: Tastes a lot like it smells. Lots of Vanilla, chocolate and coffee. Nice bourbon flavors in the and the finish. The bourbon stands out even more as it warms. The bourbon is a bit boozy, but I'm going to consider this a positive considering it is what was intended. Zero hop character. M: Smooth and medium mouth feel. Little bit of tongue numbing booziness.

Breakfast Stout with bourbon flavors... what an outstanding idea.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,BeerMaverick,4.97,"A - Completely black with absolutely no translucency. Only a little khaki-tinted head with bits of refined lacing on the Stella glass. Moderate retention, but pretty good considering how little it started with.  S - Amazing...milk chocolate and bourbon mixed together perfectly. I'm not a big bourbon fan, but it's so well balanced in aroma that it is good whether or not you like bourbon. Slight bitterness as well.  T - Slight hop bitterness up front with a nice bourbon bite that is balanced out with a viscous milk chocolate taste that coats the tongue. The alcohol is slightly noticeable, but it is hard to decipher due to the bourbon flavor that pretty much masks it.  M - This is one of the best features of this brew. Typically in a bourbon barrel aged beer, the bourbon lingers forever due to its strong and ever-present tones. In this beer, however, the bourbon lingers, but at the perfect magnitude creating a warming sensation that makes you eager to keep coming back. The sweet milk chocolate is also a very desirable quality that isn't overdone in this beer. The bitterness of the hops (70 IBUs) is perfect for this style and does not kill the palate, allowing you to enjoy this brew for quite some time!...until you're dominated by the 11.2% abv...  O - Overall this beer is one of the best I've ever had and it is certainly the best I've had of this style.

The aroma is fantastic - bourbon, chocolate, and some vanilla. The smell is heavier on the bourbon side. The taste, however, is heavier on the chocolate side methinks. The bourbon is there, but not as strong as the smell suggests. Initially, it is quite sweet with the chocolate and vanilla dancing on my palette. Then the other flavors seep through - coffee, bourbon, and a hint of oak. Delectable.  The mouthfeel is absolutely fantastic. Possibly the best I've had in this regard. Viscous and smooth. Ideal carbonation. Flawless victory.  This brew is exceptional. The best stout I've had bar none. This beats BCBS in almost every category.

A: It pours a pitch black color with a finger of khaki head that fades quickly but laces very well.  S: There is quite a bit going on; dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, anise, blackcurrants, and cream.  T: It is a struggle between boozy, semi-hot bourbon and medium-roast coffee early with vanilla cream, hazelnut, and bitter dark fruits late.  M: The body is a bit thinner than I expected with a little heat and a sticky, syrupy finish.  D: This is very good but not quite what it is cracked up to be.

1199,19960,chilly460,4.85,"A - Pours black into my Chimay chalice, some mahogany at the edges of the glass. One finger of mocha colored head pops up as it settles, medium sized consistent bubbles. Nice lacing and retention.  S - Coffee dominates the nose, followed by a fair amount of bourbon . Some sweet roasted malt, definite vanilla and a deeper rich smell, maybe molasses. Getting some sweet chocolate at times as well.  T - Tastes follows the aroma. Bigtime coffee flavor, roasty right up to bitter but not overboard. Plenty of boozy bourbon laced with dark chocolate. Then there is a layer of vanilla and sweet caramel, and maybe some spiciness from the wood? I've had other big barrel aged beers like BCBS or just plain big beers like Overlord that may have more hard hitting flavor in one way or another, but KBS hits the perfect balance in my opinion. Coffee, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla...they all are there with plenty of punch, but not overpowering.  M - Outstanding, thick rich smooth full body beer. Not goopy, just perfect, it matches the best hangover curing diner chocolate milk I've had.  D - Again, outstanding. They take a big ABV beer, and balance flavors perfectly to make it as drinkable as you'll find.

S: Dark, bitter chocolate and spent coffee grounds up front. Boozy bourbon smell comes through with the oak as it warms. There is a slight touch of vanilla sweetness that is an absolutely perfect compliment to the booze spice.  T: bitter chocolate again, with a heavy wave of bourbon that overtakes the palate. The bourbon flavor definately takes over and creates a fairly uncomplex beer, but I gave it a 5 due to the fact that this beer comes as close as it gets to nailing the style. I do taste coffee again after the heat subsides.  M: Heavy, oily, chewy. Coats the mouth and leaves a ton of spice from the hops and booze. My gums are quite numb after the first 4 sips. I love this thick, rich, meal in a glass body.  D: I am really digging this beer and it was worth the wait. Is this the best bourbon aged stout I have ever had? No, that would be left for Goose Island Bourbon County Vanilla Stout.

The smell is fantastic, chocolate, cocoa, well-integrated, not boozy vanilla and bourbon. Just an amazing smell and one I went back for more than seconds on. Chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, booze, this is a really good tasting barrel aged imperial stout. The mouthfeel is medium with reasonable carbonation. Not as heavy as some imperial stouts, but in a good way I'd say. Drinkability is quite high for an 11% barrel aged beer.

1199,19960,zoso1967,4.42,"Enjoyed on nitro-tap at the 2011 KBS release with my good friend TCGoalie.  Nitro KBS is served up an inky black with a nice tan head that has great retention. It pretty much looks like normal KBS but with a bit more of a whipped head.  The aroma is quite different and a bit muted. Luckily, it is muted in a good way. The alcoholic nature of the bourbon and the astringency of the roasty malts and coffee give way a bit to a nice toffee and chocolate sweetness with a bit of vanilla mixed in. It is a much friendlier nose that is not necessarily better or worse than normal, just pleasantly different.  The flavor is quite similar to normal draft KBS, but still seems a bit less intense. Coffee, bourbon, vanilla, caramel, toffee and molasses are all present, as is a decent hotness.  The mouthfeel is super smooth and velvety, making this stuff dangerously drinkable. The finish is sweet and slightly roasty as well as seemingly toned down just like the aroma and flavor.  I enjoy KBS no matter what form it is in and this glass is no different. If I had to choose between only having draft or nitro the rest of my life, I would probably take draft KBS.

1199,19960,superdedooperboy,4.04,"Fresh bottle of 2011 vintage poured into a snifter glass. Served at approximately 50 degrees F.  Pours pitch black, perfectly opaque with zero light penetration. A small, fairly loose mocha head forms and fades equally quickly, leaving behind only a few scattered smatterings of ill-fated lace on the walls of the glass.  Aroma is quite nice, with overt notes of bourbon taking the forefront; notes of dark chocolate and medium-roasted coffee emerge underneath. The nose is really somewhat subdued for a bourbon barrel-aged beer, but the subtlety likely belies skill.  Mouthfeel is smooth and moderately carbonated; with a medium-heavy body, it is rather easy drinking and not as weighty as many beers in the style. Unlike the nose, sweet chocolate and bitter coffee come to the forefront of the palate, with vanilla and bourbon following in the middle; bitterness is high and drying, but seems to come more from the coffee than hops. Coffee, dark chocolate and vanilla seem to engulf the palate before finishing dry with a lingering bit of espresso and oaky vanilla, and a bit of boozy warmth on the way down.  Smooth and balanced, this is one heck of a barrel-aged beer. Bourbon can often be overpowering in beers of this type, but here it plays a supporting role, and does an excellent job in doing so. It's obvious why Founders has such a classic on their hands. Amazing fresh, this may have some cellaring potential, but it seems best enjoyed as it is.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Nonetheless, it has beautiful thin layer of head that is swirled on top of the beer.  S-Chocolate and vanilla, mmm. This smell is not too powerful, very little to no hints of bourbon. This can be attributed to its rather cool serving temperature.  T-Fantastic. Chocolate, vanilla and coffee notes. Very little sweetness is detected, a lingering coffee and baker's chocolate taste lingers in your mouth.  M-Just enough carbonation, not too much not too little. Chocolate and coffee coats your tongue and leave you wanting more. Each sip/drinks coats your tongue just a little bit more but does not overpower the palate.  D-Superb!!!

A bit of dry oak and rubbing alcohol comes thru as it comes to room temp. Not too bad.

(only kidding)  im usually not crazy about reviewing the beers that i drink, i enjoy them much more when i simply take my time, and pay attention as i please. but after sipping this for over an hour (a couple bottles) i feel compelled to write something about it.  its 2009 vintage  a. super dark, barely a dark red tinge around the edge of the glass when held up to light. a rich dark brown head is agitated with the pour and raises between one and two fingers width. settles gently with a thin line of lace and maintains a partial head through the entire session. in general, it looks very very appealing as a stout, the heaviness though is slightly unappealing, in terms of the weight of the head and its inability to persist. it gets sucked into the dark depths of the brew. ominous.  s. smell is overall bourbony, but very intricately composed of sweet chocolatey and malty fringes. its not alcohol im smelling, its bourbon barrels. the chocolate vibe is more of an atmosphere surrounding the more pungent bourbon aroma.  t. i like the use of the bitterness here, it attacks bitterly at first. the bitterness opens the door so to speak for the bourbon to introduce itself midpalate. the end is very gentle, simple, fulfilling chocolate. lingering aftertaste is coffee grounds and faint reminiscence of the alcohol and barrel and toasted baked goods. really nice.  m. very smooth at first, silky. then the carbonation pops up and settles dry, but not too dry, but it leaves a heavy coating of KBS in its wake.  d. very very very very lots of ""very""'s drinkable. its just overall so enjoyable and pleasant that there's no trouble at all taking down a couple bottles, as im doing. there's nothing difficult about it, its pleasant (instead of pungent, strong, intense...), and to me, that's the main appeal.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

M - Fantastic mouthfeel; one of the best imperial stouts out there in this respect. On the heavy side of medium, perhaps, but still drinks so smooth.  D - For an 11.2% beer, this beer goes down far too easy.  Overall - I am not a huge fan of this beer fresh, as I always find the coffee overpowering. However, with a year on it, this is just unearthly.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,tr0n,4.71,"Had the Kentucky Breakfast Stout on tap at Lord Hobo before Extreme Beer Fest.  KBS was brought to the table completely black in a tulip glass with a thin coffee-colored head. The smell at first was very lightly coffee at first, but as the beer warmed the stronger coffee and subtle vanilla flavors became more apparent.  Coffee is the dominant flavor but is very balanced against the background vanilla and oak. It felt very full but not particularly heavy. This KBS was easy to drink, and benefited from slow warming as I drank.

1199,19960,websherpa,3.76,"Appearance: Pitch black no opacity, beautiful chocolate brown colored head, 1/2 finger thick. No significant lacing. The head is really what makes this beer look so good.  Smell: Way too much of the bourbon up front. Besides that, plenty of vanilla.  Taste: Bourbon all day. It's not bad, I just wish it left room for the other flavors. Besides that I get vanilla primarily again from the barrels and ""supporting"" chocolate flavors. This beer also has a very significant alcohol presence. All in all, it's a pretty simple beer that rests most of it's flavor on the barrel aging. I wish there was more to the beer and less of the barrel to be honest. As per usual though, the bourbon barrels come through in the finish with a beautiful long and smoky finish that makes you think this beer is worth it after all.  Mouthfeel: The alcohol makes this too spice but otherwise a well built beer.  Drinkability: This isn't a bad beer by any stretch. Given the choice though I would reach for Ten Fidy over this every time. The beer just doesn't balance it's flavors well, it's too boozy and it's best attribute is the finish, rather than it's taste on the palate.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S- A big whiff of honey, vanilla, oak and bit of the stout flavors. I would say bourbon here, but there was absolutely no alcohol kick that I've come to expect with most bourbon (and bourbon stouts)  T- Chocolate and Coffee more on the coffee side of things, I get the breakfast aspects here. Some incredible roasted notes This then turns to bourbon flavors: honey, vanilla, and a big big amount of oak. The thing is though, all the flavors make sense and blend well. Most of the time I don't like bourbon beers because it doesn't feel like the flavors meld well. Here the flavors meld and then some. Delicious.  M/D-Thick silky mouth feel with a big body, not a ton of carbonation. Drinkability is where this beer shines. Halfway through my first glass, I stared in awe at how smooth the beer was. I could drink this all night, for 11.2, that's unheard of, especially for a bourbon beer.  Holy hell this is good, words can't do it justice. This coming from someone who isn't big on bourbon beers.

Not getting much, if any vanilla or oak.  Too cold. Aaaand way too much coffee grounds taste for me. Guess that's why it's a breakfast stout. I get it now. Not going to drainpour but not lovin' it.

A: Pours a deep dark brown with a thin dark brown head that quickly bubbled away into a faint collar that left a few wisps of lacing down the glass. S: I can only describe the smell in adjectives: bourbony, choclatey, spicy and woody. The barrel-like quality to the scent is outstanding. There is kind of a spicy oak texture to the nose with maybe a hint of vanilla. T: Rich flavors of roasted coffee mixed with sweet malts, a hint of vanilla, and spicy woody bourbon. Chocolate comes through in the finish, and the aftertaste is creamy and warm with just a touch of caramel as well. Everything is so well integrated that, while the flavors are all very bold, no single aspect overshadows another. M: Light frothy carbonation creates a medium body with a lighter than expected mouthfeel. This beer could be thicker, but it is a minor nuisance. Alcohol is warm but never hot or uncomfortable. D: One of the best bourbon stouts I've tried. I was very impressed at how well the flavors worked together. Another great beer from a great brewery!  EDIT: Bottled 2/8/2010, consumed 3/12/2012. Two year old bottle is incredible smooth - almost too smooth. All of the warming bourbon heat has vanished from the brew, and the boldness as seemed to have mellowed.

The vertical was hosted at my place, and was done blind as well. Each beer was bagged with a letter A-F, and everyone received a 2 oz pour from each bottle (there were 9 people at the tasting & two bottles of each beer). So everyone had a little over a total of 12oz. of this beer.  We had some plane walnuts, roasted unsalted almonds, dark chocolate, water, Swiss, gouda and Havarti cheeses to go with the beers while tasting ( and lunch afterwards with Irish stew and mash potato's)  Anyhow, on to the beer.  First, I've had this beer many times, and since this beer has so many reviews of how it taste, most of which are spot on, so instead I'm summarizing this into my initial impressions of each beer in the vertical directly from my notes.  2006 - Roasted malts, wood, vanilla  2007 - Oak, coffee, roasted malts  2008 - Heat, alcohol, light chocolate, low carbonation, stringent, medicinal, like dirty pennies.  2009 - Coffee, bitterness, vanilla, bourbon  2010 - Bourbon, vanilla, roasted malts, figs, dates.  Out of the group, I actually guessed three out of the five years right (2006, 2009 & 2010) The favorites in the tasting were the 2007 and the 2010. (4 votes each as the best) The 2006 was the thinnest, and the 2008 was the worst. (Could have been bad bottles, or just a bad vintage that year)  We also each had a blend of all five years, which was also incredibly smooth as well, and recommended if your able to.  Overall, this was a great vertical tasting with friends with a world class beer.

Coffee's actually pretty strong as well. Dark fruit and chocolate are overwhelmed by the bourbon/coffee 1-2 combo, and roasted malts are mostly an afterthought. Holy mackerel this is boozy.

Aroma is delightful and roasty. Aromas of bittersweet chocolate, iced coffee, black molasses and raisins, all wrapped up in a blanket of heavy dry oak.

1199,19960,mjsheehan08,4.55,"Been waiting to try this a really long time. Got it in my first trade from trapper2408. Did a side by side comparison with a FBS.   Pours a dark, dark black pour with absolutely no light shining through. Head is not as thick as the regular FBS and it disappears rather quickly, leaving behind a rim of lace on the top of the glass.  Lacing looks consistent, but again, not as impressive as the non barrel aged version. The FBS head is also a lighter shade of mocha.   Initial stench is an overpowering whiff of bourbon, which leads into smells of vanilla and wood. I'm picking up some string coffee smells as well. Not as heavy on the chocolate as in the FBS, which is one of my favorite components of the FBS.   Initial flavor is again dominated by the bourbon, but it mellows into the palate very smoothly, more so then any other barrel aged stout I have ever had. The bourbon leads into vanilla, which leads into the coffee, which flows into the chocolate. There are some more bourbon overtone in the aftertaste, which also mix with a strong alcohol presence and some mild wood notes.   Drinking them both side by side has been a pretty cool experience for me. While I respect the bold flavors of the KBS, I am enjoying the drinkability of the FBS a little bit more. As far as bourbon barrel beers go, KBS is by far the smoothest and most impressive that I have ever had, and I am excited to sample the one other one I have in my cellar in a fee years. I am really glad that I got to try it, but I am not devastated that I don't get to drink it all the time.   ***edit***  Okay so this was my initial reaction to the beer. I was drinking the KBS outta the fridge, and the FBS outta my cellar. I let it warn for about 20 minutes, but now that it is warmer, so much more flavors are coming out. There is some smoke present, and the warmth has brought out a really terrific roasted coffee and chocolate flavors that weren't as present was it was a little colder. The alcohol is a little more present, but that brings out some more of the strong bourbon barrel notes. Overall, a wonderful beer and I def recant my statement that FBS is better.

The beer poured typical stout-y black, with two fingers of rootbeer foam colored head that clung tightly to the sides of the glass. It's like, how much more black could this be? And the answer is none. None more black.  Bourbon smell dominated the nose. Behind that was a rich, chocolety malty smell along with oak and vanilla. There was some coffee, but it was pretty subtle. The taste closely matched the smell. Bourbon up front, followed by a rich roasted chocolate vanilla blast of goodness. The finish was slightly bitter.

The bouquet is prominent and inviting.  T - Follows the nose almost precisely. Tastes more like Founders Breakfast Stout than I expected, but the oaky, slightly smoky bourbon notes add another dimension. A hint of smooth buttery caramel is added to the mix, presumably also from the barrel-aging, as I detect something similar in Rare BCBS and some of the finer bourbons I've sampled.

1199,19960,Boitnott,4.74,"Founders KBS (2010) was poured from the bottle into a DFH snifter. The initial pour led to virtually no head, which I blame on the age (year old). A very small head does appear and a small lacing exists as well. The color is basically black with a few brown notes, and no light permeates from it.  The smell has a strong scent of coffee and cocoa nibs, which blend to a mocha sent similar a well made coffee shop mocha. There is also a roasted malt presence, which adds a burnt smell, which does not over power the coffee and chocolate. The smell is also very strong begs you to take a sip; enticing you to drink this miraculous creation. The nose mimics the smell very well, which show how much smell plays a role here. It is very sweet from the chocolate and a slight coffee smell comes out as well. The Kentucky bourbon really hits you in the finish and mixes with the coffee and a faint taste of bitter hops. I would like the hop presence to be more apparent but this is probably due to the age.  The beer feels excellent on the palate, but has no head presence. The very full body makes this a meal in a bottle, but a highly enjoyable one at that. Despite the full body, I could probably drink many of these, and would probably pass out very quickly at 11.2%. The alcohol really comes out from the bourbon, but does not take away from the overall flavor. This defines the style of Bourbon Barrel Stout.

It pours deep and black, with a thin brown, milk-chocolate head that clings to the glass like one of those little rubber wall stickers you had as a kid. The nose is soft, silky, and washes over the tongue and onto the roof of the palate in waves of creamy chocolate and roasted malt. There's an herbal spiciness with hints of sweet vanilla, earthy tannins, and a lingering dry, malty finish that beckons the next sip.

1199,19960,Elendinn,4.35,"An '09 vintage, poured into my Sierra Nevada tulip glass. Thanks to hellomisterp!  Pours a beautiful black like every stout should -- a tranquil, globular void in my glass, which seems to devour light -- with a modicum of rich, chocolatey, coffee-like head and a surprising amount of lacing. The aesthetics have got me excited and I'm anxious to see how this smells.  Coffee dominates the nose, followed by a fair amount of bourbon (though it's definitely taking the backseat), with hints of roasty malt, molasses, chocolate, and wood. It's not particularly sweet, as the coffee, unrelentingly, seems to overshadow every other facet of the beer. That being said, it's a very pleasant aroma and well-deserving of the name.  Tastes like it smells -- a prevalent coffee flavor, roasty and bitter, heavily laden with boozy bourbon; hints of dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, spice, and wood round out the backend. Finishes dry, with coffee and bourbon flavors lingering long after ingestion. Not as sweet as The Abyss, or even Bourbon County Brand Stout, but it's exceptional in its own right. The bourbon, as before, plays a decidedly secondary role, which is a little disappointing, but it's still deep, complex, and damn good.  It's full-bodied in the mouth, with light, passive carbonation, making for a very smooth, though slightly viscous, experience.  Living in Oregon, I've grown intimately acquainted with The Abyss. KBS is an entirely different beast -- not even remotely as sweet, with emphasized flavors of coffee, bourbon, and wood. It's also a bit more boozy. Nevertheless, it's a welcome change; the roasted coffee flavors are blended exceptionally well with the sweeter elements and the delicious, almost subversive flavors of bourbon. Drinkability suffers a bit because of the bitterness and booziness, but it's not supposed to be guzzled, it's supposed to be sipped and savored. The Abyss still takes first place in my book, but this beer puts up an honorable fight. I'd buy it frequently if it were readily available, as it fills a niche that other stouts don't. If only I could drink this at work...",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Taste is more complex - some woody flavors carry through along with a bit more of a bourbon bite and your more standard stout flavors.

1199,19960,JackieTH,4.95,"On-tap at Bryant Lake Bowl.  Appearance: Simply put, this is an opulant pour, from the tap it's obsidian with runnels of maghogany foam churning in the glass forming a cap of rich brown head. Striking, exceptional, and inviting.  Smell: Heady waves of midnight dark chocolate, roasted coffee, bourbon, vanilla, dark fruits and roasted malt roll forth in a tidal wave of flavor.  Taste: Dark chocolates, roasted malt and espresso perfectly balanced with hop lend a bitterness that just pricks the tongue before laying on what has to be one of the most grandiose displays of what a brewmaster can accomplish with a bourbon barrel aging process. Big & warming with notes of vanilla, dark cherry, chocolate. Toffee sweetness. Altogether perfectly balanced bitterness and bourbon elements make for a looong, warming finish.  Mouthfeel: Luxiourous texture and very coating. Carbonation supports the body and it's just about perfect.  Drinkability: Delicious from start to finish. I really don't care if it's 11-12% ABV. Bring it on.  Notes: As I understood it, the bar owner aged this vessel of KBS for an additional year before tapping it a couple days ago. I could be wrong.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I couldn't wait to drink this beer, once I smelt it. coffee, vanilla, raisins, and bourbon lingering in the background  T- The taste follows the smell pretty closely. There is a roasted coffee, vanilla, I want to say slight maple, and an aftertaste that reminds me of a White Russian. The aftertaste lingers for quite some time, occasionally revealing hints of chocolate, port and quinine. Very complex, yet very well integrated. A classic bourbon stout. Worth moving to Michigan for.  M- utterly coats your throat. The aftertaste sticks around for a while and morphs as it goes. I'm waiting minutes between sips.  D- This beer is delicious and goes down surprisingly well for this style. That said, how many 11% ABV stouts do you want to drink in a sitting? This beer would be great with fruit or chocolate deserts. I also like that it is not terribly sweet for this style. It IS on the sweet side, but not as cloying as some.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smell - woah. sweet coffee, roasted malt, and boozy bourbon. very inviting.  Taste - toffee, bourbon, coffee, nice warming booze on the first sip. alcohol and bourbon presence progressively more prevalent as the beer warms. Very nice.  Feel - not nearly as thick and heavy as I expected from the appearance. very smooth, but very low carbonation.  Drink - higher than expected for such a big, flavorful beer...but the high ABV makes this one a sipper.  Overall - I'm really glad I tried this beer. It is definitely unique and extremely well crafted.

Molasses, bourbon, coffee, malt - well blended and exquisite. As it warms the coffee gets a little more prominent, along with an occasional burnt, bitter smell.  Taste is good - a lot like how it smells, except more bitter. There's a nice blending of bourbon, sweetness, coffee and malt - but a lot of burnt flavor as well. That's my only complaint - a bit too bitter for me. The overall complexity is very nice, however. As it warms alcohol and caramel notes start to show up.  Mouthfeel is good. Thick and creamy, but a bit undercarbonated and not quite as viscous as would be ideal.  Very drinkable.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

It poured black but what did you expect it's a stout. Not much head on this one. The little head that did appear went away quickly.  I smell coffee, I smell barrel, I smell little bits of vanilla. I think I'm gonna just taste it...  Wow, this a sweet, sweet stout. Yes, I can taste the barrel, I can taste some vanilla and chocolate. It's a complex big beer but could also be dessert. Little bitter and boozy on the finish.  It's a nice creamy stout. Lots of flavor that lingers in the mouth after the swallow.  Loving it.

Little to no head with just a thin layer of foam on the top. Not much carbonation. A nice lacing is left on the glass as you drink it.  Smell: Strong bourbon and vanilla. Not much of a coffee smell, but it's there. Fairly strong alcohol presence.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Tastes like it smells, strong bourbon and vanilla. The coffee taste is much stronger than the smell and I'm also tasting chocolate. Good presence of alcohol that leaves a nice burn on your lips. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Great beer for the colder nights - it's definitely warming me up. The amount of bourbon taste in this beer is perfect, not too overpowering at all. Stronger presence of caramel as it warms.  Drinkability: Definitely a sipper at a little over 11% abv. The many flavors do a good job at masking the alcohol though. This beer is just so damn tasty it would be easy to drink a few.

It's basically like my pint of Ben and Jerry's. Rich, creamy and delicious, it is one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.  First, it looks like beer strained through coffee grounds, head and liquid. Second, it smells like unicorn poop, with just enough of a booze nose to remind you that you are drinking real. Thirdly, it tastes like god's melted ice cream cone, coats the tongue and goes down smoothly. Vanilla, caramel and coffee hit you up front and the bourbon finishes you off. Each sip is superior to the last as this bad boy warms up to room temperature. The only reason I can't drink a six-pack of these is because it is so decadent that my heart may stop. Find some. Drink some. Love some.  If I had to pick one beer to drink for the rest of my life, it might just be KBS.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Coffee and chocolate, vanillan, toffee, chocolate again, and lastly bourbon followed by roasted malts.  T: This comes in waves as well, and its everything you smell, only opposite. First hit is the bourbon presence moving on all the way to the coffee finish.  M: Just where I'd want a barrel aged stout, full and creamy without being too oily. Bourbon bite lends its warmth throughout the entire palette.  D: This is a great sipper for a snowed in day, should be the sign of a good night to follow. This is one that is better as it warms slightly, but I find if you wait to long it ends up a little thin and disappointing.

Carbonation is there, but not too strong.  Caramel and chocolate in the nose...almost a tootsie roll smell. There are hints of vanilla, molasses, smoke, oak, and a slight hint of curry--not an intense flavor, but just around the edges in the flavor, balancing the dark roasty aroma.  The flavor is on the sweet side, boasting notes of chocolate, cherry, vanilla, tart fruit, spice, coffee, caramel, honey, and plums. This is a rich, rich beer...  The flavor here is quite complex, deep, and rich. A remarkable stout that stands outside the box of other barrel aged stout. It is smooth, drinkable, and has an overall palette-pleasing element.

Lots of roasted choc malt and some alcohol. Also getting some molasses, burnt marshmallows and licorice. Flavor starts very sweet with the molasses, lots of oak, and bourbon, very nice woody character behind all of the sweet toasty malts. Big alcohol kick in the finish that trails for some time through the swallow. Full bodied and rich. Very nice beer overall.

Retention is pretty decent considering the ABV, and lacing is pretty good as well.  Smell: Roasted malts and bourbon are the two biggest components on the nose for me. I also get quite a bit of coffee, and very light hints of chocolate and vanilla. Pretty complex.  Taste: Roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate up front, followed by a good deal of bourbon heat and a bit of vanilla. Finish is definitely bourbon/alcohol with a bit of coffee. The bourbon heat is just about perfect. One year old seems to be a good age for this beer.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Mouthfeel is probably going to be my biggest knock on this beer. It's slightly under full bodied, which is fine, but carbonation is quite low and the resulting feel is pretty slick. It seems to accentuate the bourbon/alcohol component in this beer more than the base flavors. If the malts/chocolate/coffee clung to the palate a bit better my score on this beer would be even higher. That being said, this is still an excellent beer.

Taste a lot of bourbon and coffee right off the bat. Then, hints of chocolate and something very sweet like a syrup.

This beer is heavy and fills you up, also 11.20% so its not a beer you need to drink a whole lot of. Still though, you might find it hard to pass up another glass.

Not much in the way of head: less than half an inch that quickly dissipates to a tiny wisp of lace.  S- Intense aroma of chocolate and coffee. The chocolate is quite strong with both bitter cocoa and sweet syrup coming through. The coffee is also quite prominent with a great roasty, earthy character. A nice dose of bourbon adds some richness and complexity. Really outstanding.  T- Sweet, syrupy chocolate upfront quickly segues into bold espresso and char that is slightly astringent. Bourbon adds a pleasant vanilla/ butterscotch character but is not too strong. Finish is slightly bitter with a touch of alcohol and an aftertaste of bittersweet chocolate morsels.  M- Full, rich, and velvety smooth with just enough carbonation to balance it out a little. Fantastic.  D- It's rich and fairly alcoholic, but the flavor is so good you want to keep drinking it. Great for the style.  Truly a great beer and easily one of the best stouts I've ever had. As far as bourbon barrel stouts go, this gives the Abyss a run for its money. The bourbon character is there but not too strong, which is just right for my taste. I imagine this will hold up quite well for years to come.

1199,19960,burnheartsMKE,4.5,"I received a black & beautiful tulip glass of KBS with a nice tan head. The nose gave me hints of chocolate and that to-be-expected deeply roasted malt. First sip, is that it? I wondered? This is way too smooth... second sip, mmm...  A solid year in the cooler had mellowed this fellow out quite nicely. Gone was the overwhelming bourbon and dark coffee presence I was expecting. Instead, was chill imperial stout that was remarkably drinkable for the high 11.2%ABV.  As it warmed it only became better, complex, but subdued. Sticky sweet with a nod to vanilla bean, sure, but never over-bearing. I wondered if I was really drinking a KBS(?)  I put my serving down quite quickly, said my farewells and made my exit back into the frigid darkening evening. As I stepped outside and breathed the cold January air, my taste buds were shocked to find a mouthful of ice-cold chocolate (like taking a big-gulp of a chocolate malt) suddenly forced into an awakening. It's as if this KBS had followed me outside and sucker-punched me (for no good reason other than because it could) as I walked to my car.

T: The flavor suggested by the aroma are all there. Initially the flavor are balanced and complex. Really enjoyable.

Chocolate notes and a slight bit of vanilla extract beside the bourbon.  T - Coffee, chocolate, and bourbon. The coffee isn't as prominent in this beer as in Founders Breakfast Stout, but it is replaced by a very well integrated bourbon character. As it warms molasses and a bit of burnt sugar stand out more. Roasted malts and a very subtle hop note on the finish.  M - Founders just has the mouthfeel category down to a science in all of their beers. I really don't think a single brewery in the world can match them. This is just unbelievably smooth for such a high ABV, flavor heavy beer it is stunning.  D - this beer is over 11% ABV and it just seems to evaporate in my glass i'm drinking it so quickly.

A: A slow, steady pour delivers a finger of coarse dark brown foam on top of a pitch-black body. Decent retention (especially for the strength) and some decent spotty lace. A swirl of the glass revives the dark foam admirably. Simple and appropriately intimidating.  S: I couldn't be less surprised - or more happy - with how this smells. Bourbon-soaked oak, dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, and alcohol are all present in roughly equal, and equally lovely, portions. Nothing really stands out, but everything works together to deliver a practically perfect bourbon-barrel stout aroma. I only say ""practically"" because the alcohol plays a bit more prominent role than might be ideal. Still, this is amazing.  T: Roasted malts start things off richly, with coffee and chocolate both well-represented; the bourbon and wood come through more in the middle, adding a huge layer of intensity and complexity; bitterness and heat round things out on the finish, followed finally by a delicious roasty aftertaste of high-quality dark chocolate. Wow. This. Is. Awesome.  M: Substantial, but not quite thick, body, with moderate carbonation. Not quite as mouth-filling as I'd like, but perfectly good.  D: Incredibly delicious, but also huge enough to be a sipper.  Notes: I've had KBS before, but only fresh. As much as I loved the stronger coffee notes in that, I'm more impressed with the balance and complexity that have come out in this ~18 month old bottle. I just wish I had more in the cellar!

Spotty lacing remains on the glassware. A light swirl revives the cap briefly.  The aroma of this brew is sweet with a scent of chocolate laden coffee. It is quite earthy with hops and has a rich vanilla sweetness throughout. A bit of a musty grain character fills the back end of the nose. There is a tangy bourbon influence here that brings the entire smell of this brew together in a wonderful way. As it warms, the bourbon notes come to the front of the aroma with quite a bite.  The taste of this brew has a bold display of roasty grain bitterness tasting like chocolate and rich espresso. A solid bourbon influence is in this brew with both a tangy alcohol presence and warmth throughout the mouth and down the back of the throat. There is an earthy taste of hops mixed with grain in the aftertaste. As the brew warms there is a light oaked quality that imparts a dryness to the finish.  This is a medium bodied brew that is surprisingly lighter than expected. It is modestly carbonated presenting just enough bubbly on the tongue. This is a bold and tasteful brew that was enjoyed on a cold snowed-in day and is equally enjoyed as a nightcap or by the fire. Don't let it fool you, for all the beers that are out there that masterfully hide the amount of alcohol they have, this one is bold and out in the open.

There were hints of all the popping flavors that came and described below.  T - ummm. Nearly perfect, let's get this exact. Each time I went to take a sip from my etched New Belgium globe glass, I had to stop and smell first. On the sip, first you get coldness on the draw with a slight tingle and great carbonation, then perfect amount of sweetness, with subtle bourbon, more subtle chocolate, with perhaps even more subtle vanilla mixed in there. Point is; nothing is over powering. It is probably the most balanced complex beers I've ever had and I am a beer geek and brewer myself. I am sure the creaminess is due to the higher temp mashing process, or some crystal malts, doubtfully maltro-dextrins, but maybe carapils, or even lactose powder, I just don't know, but I am close. NO DOUBT, there is espresso somewhere in there. It's almost as if someone threw a little bourbon in some fudge, but the hops and malts chill it out some. Bourbon can over power a beer, but this is the first bourbon beer that is NOT over powered. I don't really like bourbon, so this is the perfect amount.  M - stated above, creamy, perfect and slightly tingling to the tounge. Just the best balance of any beer so far. They did a lot of test brews to come up with this one. Fucking awesome! Sorry, but it is true. I love it, ~ drink this before you go out for dinner.  D = yes, all night, no probl3m",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Sticky lacings left behind.  S: You can smell this bad as soon as you crack the bottle. Lushes chocolate, lots of sweet bourbon, coffee, and vanilla. Even a little bit of oak in there as well. Heaven.  T: Lots of roasted coffee. Vvanillia, and chocolate, with the bourbon makes its appearance shortly after, all coming together for just one kick ass tasting beer. The bourbon isn't too strong which help the other flavors not get lost in the mix. Would like maybe just a tab more vanillia.  You taste the alcohol, but very little burn, esp for 11%  M: For something so robust, it's comes in with a med body. Would almost like it just a bit fuller. Creamy, excellent carbonation level...very very smooth.  D: Goes down like water to me. I could kill a four pack on a good night. Great price point, IMO.  Hot damn, I love this beer.

Got little to no head On this one but what i did see was dark brown.  S= got a bug whiff of chocolate syrup at first. Then as it settled in a little more I could smell the bourbon barrel a little more and also some coffee aromas as well but chocolate definatley takes center stage here.  A=chocolate upfront supported by coffe flavor then get the burbon and oakiness faintly. I actually like the flavors in that order of prominence. The alcohol is very much an afterthought to my tasebuds, I would have never guess 11.2% on this smooth beer.  Mouthfeel is great right on the thicker side of medium.  Overall this is the best stout i have ever have and really can't see anything about it I would change for my personal taste aside from the appearance, wish there was more head.

Also get some coffee flavors and some very sweet bourbon type notes.  T/M: Dark chocolate malt flavors in the front. Some light booze in the middle and finishes like a chocolate chip cookie. I stress the cookie part. Great thick mouthfeel and good balance between bitterness and malts.  D: Love this beer.

Smell- roasted coffee dominates with chocolate, booze, bourbon and oak undertones. wow! there is a lot going on here. when it warms the bourbon and vanilla flavors slowly become more pronounced.  Taste- bourbon comes through in the taste but is well balanced with the coffee and a sweet chocolate finish- lots of well balanced flavors...vanilla...bourbon is complimentary and lingers throughout.

Nice bourbon aroma, mixed with vanilla, chocolate, and you can definitely tell this is a strong beer with a sweet alcohol aroma present.  T - This was worth the wait! Despite the high alcohol content it wasn't an immediate slap in the face like some of them. I first got the roasted coffee, chocolate, and vanilla flavors. The bourbon flavor emerges shortly after that, along with the warming sensation of the alcohol.  M/D - Surprisingly smooth for an 11% ABV, with little carbonation, this makes for a wonderful drinking experience. You know the alcohol is there, but won't blow you away as you drink it. Very nice!

A: Bottle dated 2-8-10 poured into a Brooklyn Brewery snifter/tulip... Wow, this pours a viscous motor oil black with virtually no head. A thin ring of dark mocha foam clings to the glass; not much lace on this 11.2% sucker... maybe a few specks.  S: Whoa. Ummm... bourbon; some oak and vanilla (see bourbon); some charry roast and sweet malt notes, along with some hints of alcohol; the bourbon aroma on this one is almost overpowering, but hey, its barrel aged (they apparently did a good job).  T: Much more complex than the nose would imply... A swig starts with some sweet molasses... bourbon and vanilla mid-palate... coffee on the lasting finish. Huh - 70 IBU's - doesn't seem that bitter (in the realm of hoppiness, at least) yet it is moderately acrid.

Taste is a nice bouquet of flavor. Maple syrup and caramel make up the sweetness that great you at first. The chocolate and vanilla dance around letting you know that they're there, but not quite sure of where in the mix they come in. It's sweet but gives way to a dose of malt and plenty of coffee in the end.  Fills your mouth, and your gut. It's a smooth, thick brew.  Obviously this beer is awesome. Period.

Roasty with woody notes, bourbon, coffee, and malty sweetness bouncing off each other, and are well proportioned. Boozy heat is clearly present but not over the top.  Delicious is a huge understatement. Malty sweetness, wood barrel, roasted grains, coffee, and bourbon all come into play early, in balance, and with good synergistic effect. Booze is there too.  Smooth, rich and full. Alcoholic warming comes with a teeny tiny bite, but is otherwise pleasant. Some mild roasty bitterness in the finish, but pretty clean overall.  A stout lovers dream! I think this is fresh (thank you iowahawk for gifting it upon me), and will likely get even more smooth with time.

Lots of dark aromas but has a lingering sweetness at the end.  T - Roasted malt, lactose sugar, chocolate malt, hershey bar. Sweeter than I expected but it is still straight cash money.  M/D - Quite a heavy body with, again, a sweet aftertaste. Zero alcohol flavor, even though weighing in at 11.20%. Tons of full flavors that fill the palate and way too easy to drink.

Smell- I want to say I can smell some caramel but Im not to sure, definitely get a whiff of the bourbon and chocolate.  Taste- Obviously this can make or a break a beer and KBS does not dissapoint. My first sip I was surprised that I was not catching any of the alcohol or bourbon, but by the following sips I was getting the full flavor of what this beer is about. Malty beginning leads into a crazy assortment of chocolate, bourbon, and a nice alcohol burn.  Mouthfeel- Lightly chewy, if that makes sense  Drinkability- Definitely something one can finish, moving onto a second one right after might be tough.

Velvet smooth bourbon, vanilla, and light smoke. Some light hops fade into the finish with pleasant boozy warmth and rich sweetness.  Full body, lower carbonation, ultra smooth on the tongue.

Deep, viscous black liquid fills my tulip, topped with a long lasting light tan head. No lacing, but I can almost see legs on the side of the glass.

Flavor is bursting!! Very nicely done. Initial sweetness of toffee, caramel, and vanilla is followed quickly with a hint of burnt toast and leather, then bourbon rounds out the end adorned with a nice dose of freshly ground coffee. Wow.

Behind these two mammoth aromas lurks a very solid roasted malt scent.  T: More of what I described in the aroma. Brash coffee and bourbon dominate the taste, and are blended with artistic precision. Slightly sweet. Really well done. You must like coffee and bourbon stouts to enjoy this beer.  M: Still crisp, well carbonated and fresh tasting, even with a few years on it. ABV hidden very well.  D: A favorite of mine, this beer is really easy to drink. This is a ""must have"" beer for my cellar. My highest recommendation. I believe this to be one of the best beers on the planet, and certainly the best bourbon & coffee combo I have yet had.  *** February 3, 2011  After trying this beer nearly one hundred times, I must say that this is not only one of the best barrel-aged stouts, but one of the best beers I have ever had in my life.

The coffee as well as some very earthy notes are quite present as well. It really reminds me of a chocolate covered espresso bean.There are also some faint oak notes.  The taste is a wonderful blend of bourbon, coffee and chocolate malts. The coffee is again of more earthy notes. And I am still pleasantly surprised with the upfront yet unobtrusive bourbon notes.  It has a bit of a thin body. It has just the right amount of carbonation. It is subtle yet not so light that it is flat.

S-- Gritty old coffee with chocolate, touches of vanilla and bourbon. My first thought was this is what Cowboy Coffee should, or would taste like. Also got some chocolate truffles and a bit of mushroom smell to this. No ABV smell at all.  T-- Cowboy coffee. Old coffee, chocolate, vanilla with a touch of bourbon. First sip reminded me of out camping and having 2 day old coffee that is cold.  M-- Surprisingly thin. Not in a bad way at all. Very smooth. Vanilla becomes dominant but the coffee taste is still there. Just flashes of bourbon. Just more like cold coffee with vanilla and a touch of bourbon.

ABV is scary hidden. Even once it gets warm it is just very well hidden. A sipper in every way but this is world class.

I haven't sampled this brew since.  A: Poured a very dark, dark, DARK brown, almost black. When I initially gave it a hard pour, no head formed for about 3 seconds, then... the head eruption! About an inch of head formed, roughly only two to three shades lighter than the brew itself. The foamy retention surrounded the brew throughout the session.  S: Not a bourbon bomb (ala. Older Viscosity and Black Tuesday) like I would have thought. The bourbon was definitely there, but it was tempered by the high grade coffee, mild candy sweetness, a bit of oakiness, and a tinge of vanilla.  T: I actually recognized this instantly as Founders ""Breakfast Stout"" with a little something added. This was basically a coffee dessert, with freshly churned butter (bourbon), chocolate, and vanilla. The finish was about as smooth and silky as it gets!  M: The alcohol didn't burn and was barely detectable. However, one could make the argument that when dealing with a beer involving bourbon, you are just trading one form of alcohol for another. Nevertheless, the balance was astounding, the carbonation perfect for the style, and the sweet elements are not in your face or abrasive in any way.  D: Believe the hype! This brew is truly on of the best in the entire world IMO. At the beginning of the session, I was wrapped up in a blanket in front of the fire watching TV.

1199,19960,r0nyn,4.72,"Poured from a bottle into my DFH snifter. Shared with BAs infi, johnjae, NYManc, brun and others for Thanksgiving. Reviewed from 11/25 notes.  Deep, dark and viscous, with complete opacity. Slight tan head that leaves sticky, spotty lacing. Don't think I'll ever get tired of the way stouts look, and I'm certainly not going to start with something like KBS. Smell is ridiculously complex, with a ton of different aromas wafting about. Sweet vanilla and toffee, along with caramel and coffee, all complemented by the definite bourbon scent that defines this beer. I didn't know it was possible to combine so many distinct olfactory essences into one beer, but damn, Founders managed to do it. Color me impressed.  With a nose like this, I was hoping that the taste would follow up on it and I was not disappointed. Everything I smelled was in the flavor profile, from the vanilla to the caramel to the bourbon, each one rolling across my tongue and allowing me to distinguish between them. Malts are present and are on the sweetish side, like mostly everything else. The bourbon booziness is readily discerned, but isn't obtrusive or overpowering, which is quite favorable in a barrel-aged stout. There's a very slight tinge of bitterness at the end from the coffee, but the brief aftertaste is a recap of all the sacchariferous nuances from before. Mouthfeel is slick and smooth, with little carbonation and a medium body, ensuring an easy drinking experience.  I really do wish this was readily available around me because I would definitely buy and drink this regularly. I'll admit, I had very high expectations going into this brew, and it met them handily. I just wish there was more to go around! Definitely deserving of its spot in the pantheon of top tier beers.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,dragonWhale,4.45,"Dear God, Please send more KBS down to Earth. Amen  Dear Santa, All I want for Christmas is more bourbon barrel aged beers. Maybe a redux of the Wood Aged Weekend? I will settle simply for a 6er of KBS, though. All I really need is that coffee and bourbon, The Big wood and vanilla, angry notes of black magic. Those things that make my gums tingle and my heart sing. Bittersweet. Perhaps some notes of chocolate and astringent wood and coffee. I have been (mostly) good this year. I should not have set off bottle rockets inside of the indian casino, but other than that, I think I've been the model of ""what is good."" Thanks for listening, Love, Joe  PS: The most recent bottle I had was way better than the watered down version that was my first experience of KBS. That first one alone is what keeps this from more 5s.  Dammit, KBS. I'm going to have to make a shift in the ratings here on account of 2 of the 3 bottles now that I've had not being at all up to the amazing record. Only the middle bottle has been outstanding. The first was crazy over the top coffee, this one currently is bourboncentric. Those two were from the same trade.

1199,19960,jimbomill,2.98,"KBS was another member of Capone's super Black Friday lineup. Unfortunately, perhaps the sixtel was off. Appearance was brown - not the near black that was to be expected. The nose was acidic, not floral and creamy. Taste was thin, could this have gotten watered down? Mouthfeel was blah. Drinkability gets punted under these conditions. Normally, I'd be rating this (if I had been taking notes) in the mid-to-high 4's. Yesterday's edition was abnormal.

1199,19960,NYManc,4.82,"Shared with BA infi, r0nyn, and many many others. Drank during Thanksgiving. Poured into a tulip.  A: Poured motor oil black with little to no head. When held against the light, little bits of dark dark red was seen around the edges. Little to no lacing on this. When swirled a small mocha head would a appear briefly.  S: Strong smell of coffee, bourbon and vanilla. Upon further and deep sniffs of the beer, I got a hint of chocolate mixed in there. Bits of nice malts mixed into that smell as well. The smell of alcohol is prevalent in this one. This smell got my mouth watering.  T: Taste of coffee upon the first sips, mixed with vanilla and a good malty backbone taste. The taste of the bourbon comes into play as well. Not overbearing, but a perfect mix in my opinion. After taste was dark chocolates with notes of malt. Very great mix  M: Feels great going down, so smooth. Medium bodied with little carbonation. It was what I expected for this type of beer.  D: Alcohol is prevalent so it may slow down the drinking a bit.

1199,19960,CHADMC3,4.67,"Pours a jet black body without even a hint of light showing through beneath the thin mocha colored head that quickly gives way to just a hint of lacing.  The aroma is quite complex. It is rich and woody with roasted malt, bourbon, hints of vanilla, and possibly maple. As it warms the coffee starts to appear as well as some of the earthy hops.  The flavor is equally complex yet a bit different. Roasted malt greets the palate and the bourbon, oak, and vanilla come through mid way. The chocolate and coffee bitterness arrive towards the finish with a hint of hops that provide the 70 ibu's.  The mouth feel is quite thick, yet smooth, with medium to low carbonation and a lip smacking finish from the vast flavors offered.  This beer is fantastic. A great bourbon stout as Founders found just the right mix to use without altering what made Breakfast Stout good in the first place. This is dangerously good.  2009 edition",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,wolfinthemirror,3.27,"Pours pitch black like the night sky of the countryside of Kentucky. about a fingers worth of chocolate colored head resulted from a moderately aggressive pour, doesn't last too long. No light can be seen through the body of this beer whatsoever.  i can smell strong boozy notes up front and immediately upon putting my nose to the glass. scents of vanilla/licorice, some dark chocolate, sweet rich malt. Very enjoyable nose.  The alcohol is very strong in the taste as well. Big bourgon flavors, lots of oakiness. Not tasting any kind of coffee, a hint of chocolate in the back, though. The booze really dominates everything else, its a bit overpowering.  Full bodied, but maybe not quite as thick as I had imagined it, which is a bit of a disappointment. I'm definitely getting a warming sensation in the back of my throat, which is always good on a cold night.  I can't get this in Oklahoma, and at 11.2%, i don't think i would want to drink very often if i could. This is definitely an interesting beer to try, but probably not one i would want to drink again and again.

1199,19960,afksports,4.18,"Thanks to CooperEllis for sharing a bottle of this with me while we worked on the Secret Santa 2010 BIF box we're putting together.  It definitely got me working. Appearance is thick black and ruddy, basically the same as CBS. Smell is bourbon. Although it's tempered by a bit of chocolate and malt. Not too much though. It's a very heavy smell. The taste is like the regular base beer ... plus hints of bourbon. Could be leftover from the nose and not really in the beer itself, but the effect is the same. Finish is clean and it leaves you warm inside.  The mouth is full, carbonation low but its thick enough to coat the palate. I have to knock the drinkability though. I appreciate the regular Breakfast Stout (although a different beer) more than the CBS/KBS stouts because I feel like it got the booze right. This is too much. Without a doubt powerful though.

1199,19960,TheBeerCarl,4.7,"Appearance: Beautiful rich deep dark stout with an auburn rim near the edge of the glass. It has a nice amount of head that is a nice tannish brown in color.  Smell: The scent of this beer is awesome. Vanilla hits my nose right at the start with strong bourbon notes right after. There is some definite but light earthy hopps and oak that linger after if you can dig through the intense bourbon. Some definite heat which is to be expected from something called a bourbon stout and that is 11.2 ABV.  Taste: The flavor profile is a complex mix of bourbon, coffee, vanilla, oak, licorice and spiciness that dances on your tongue and calls you to go back for another shot.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. light enough for all the flavors to coat the breadth of you tongue but thick enough to be savory. Light carbonation so as to not distract from the multitude of flavors.  Opinion: I would drink this everyday if I could, especially now that its winter. Sadly though I am stuck half a country away from the nearest distribution point. =( I miss you already KBS.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,eatabagofbooger,4.87,"Poured from a 12oz bottle to a snifter.  A: Pours a thick black with a touch of mahogany at the edges if you hold it up to light. Actually a lot like black coffee in color. Decent sized light coffee colored head and nice lacing.  S: Bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon, licorice, molasses, and bourbon. Decadent and beautiful.  T: at first, bourbon and coffee dominate (surprising, as coffee was less prominent thane vanilla and chocolate in the nose). Molasses and licorice take a back seat. Bitter dark chocolate seems subdued at first, but is prominent in the finish. Tobacco smoke Is noticeable as well. As the beer warms, chocolate becomes more pronounced, but still takes a backseat to bourbon and coffee. Faint hints if cherries come through as the beer warms as well. Floral hops are present, but very subdued-you've got to pay attention to notice them. I love malty beers that are more bitter than sweet-that is to say, bitter in the sense of dark chocolate, molasses, and coffee as opposed to a hoppy bitter. This beer definitely fits the bill, as it comes across as slightly more bitter than sweet, although the bourbon provides a nice sweet balance. I should also point out that the beer gets better as it warms, to a point where it encouraged me to increase the already high score I had given for this category. Quite a while after finishing this one, my tongue thinks I just finished eating a fine bar of dark chocolate.  M: If this beer has a weak spot, this is it. It's full bodied, but not quite as thick as I expect from a world class impy stout. Still, it leaves a nice coating on the tongue and has just the right amount of carbonation.  D: Definitely a sipper. Yet I find it difficult to hold back and just sip and savor it, it's so delicious. Kudos to Founders for putting this in a 12oz-a bomber would be too much. Very happy to have a few if these, as I'm excited to see what some more age does for this beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,SolomonGrundy,4.28,"Thanks to Brian44556 for this on a trade...Super-excited to try this one, as even the label proclaims this as ""highly acclaimed""...Pours an inky, dense black. No real head formed, which is surprising. Maybe the long trip via UPS or the temp I poured it at (a little cold)...in any event, I expected more from the pour. Impossible to tell how much carbonation just by looking. It looked oily and thick when it poured, so I'm a gonna guess sweeter than the avaerage stout. 11.2% ABV seems to hint at this also. Huge, delicious aromas. Almost unbelievable, really. Smells like a triple chocolate cake that has been plated on a small plate that has a tiny bit of Bourbon whiskey on it that soaked into the cake. It's luscious, and you can smell it across the room. Might be the best-smelling ale I've ever had. Maybe a hint of hot chocolate (i.e. some vanilla and cinnamon hints)...It's just so much like a chocolate dessert it's uncanny. Flavor is enormous and robust. The alcohol is evident and hot in the middle, warming on the finish. Loaded with heavily roasted chocolate malt, lots of espresso and dark chocolate bar notes also, right upfront. These morph into a more whiskey-cask middle, you can almost taste the barrell...I'm willing to bet this is elite on tap. From the bottle, it's harsher than one might expect from the nose. Complexities in the flavor profile are lost if served too cold, so let it warm up to cellar temp before pouring. Some other items roll out of the beer as it warms. Super complex and really delicious. The finish is long and has a nice, sharp bitterness that is one part roasty malt and the other hoppy goodness. This is probably expensive as hell, and this is not really sessionable beer. Absolutely worth tracking down.  What I like most: The amazing, chocolatey aroma profile.  What I like least: The lack of a good head.  Verdict: Really in a class of its own, this is unique, robust and a must try.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Into a tulip glass, it poured black with one finger of brown head that retained and laced extremely well. Smelled of oak, chocolate, chocolate milk, hazelnut liqueur, modest licorice, and cherry-vanilla. The taste was a fantastically balanced mixed of the aforementioned flavors, with a cherry-vanilla/modest alcohol-presence finish, and leaving a spiked chocolate milk aftertaste. No carbonation, and medium to full thickness...like liquid silk on the palate. This is another one of those beers that you would think could not be sessioned, yet it goes down extremely easily.

Hits the tongue and burnt coffee and dark chocolate come first followed by just the right hint of bourbon and caramel or toffee and very slight booziness which is masked so well I could easily drink 3 more.

Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, bourbon, brown sugar, and molasses. The flavor was of roasted malt, spices, bourbon, and molasses. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this is and always will be quite an excellent brew. This one that we had could use a little age on it to help mellow out the bourbon flavor some as it was quite hot.

The alcohal mixes well with the strong, woody barrel aroma. There's slight chocolate and coffee. Very nice.  This taste like it was poured straight from the barrel! Lots of alcohal soaked wood. A little vanilla plays on the coffee of the stout. I get more wood than any other similar beer I've ever had. That's not a bad thing at all. The complexity grows as the beer warms.  Despite the big abv it's surprisingly drinkable. The carbonation seems to fade as the beer warms leaving a nice syrup quality. The body has some depth but isn't chewy. Thinner than I expected.

1199,19960,BuckeyeOne,4.9,"Had on tap at Stub & Herb's in Mpls. Served in a 10 oz. snifter. Poured a impenetrable black with a mocha-colored solid head that left only a trace of lacing.  The aroma was perfectly wonderful --- bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, molasses, dried fruit, and only a hint of coffee. No hint of alcohol in the nose.  The taste was exceptionally blended together, while the nose had distinct, somewhat separate aromas. The flavors were blended into a sweet (vanilla, molasses, dried fruit), yet bitter (dark, bitter chocolate, espresso, and bourbon) elixir. As this warms, it becomes ever more flavorful. Like the nose, I didn't get a taste of booze at all.  The mouthfeel is oily and slick with just the right amount of carbonation to hold the whole thing up. It becomes downright creamy as it warms.  I could (and would if it were distributed in my area) drink several of these at a sitting. This might just be the best imperial stout I've ever had. For me the high alcohol content would limit its drinkability and is the only non-5.0 rating I've given this exceptional beer.

Nose is wonderful: loads of dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon, a general lovely roastiness, more coffee, a touch of alcohol. Taste is bourbon sweetness upfront with some molasses and licorice, melds seamlessly with lots of coffee and some lesser chocoalte. Lingering alcohol burn in the throat; long, long finish.

Poured by the bartender into a Founder's Tulip.  Appearance: Rich, deeply khaki tan head on top of a slick looking black body. This one looks rick and deep. Hardly a shred of light can cut through this guy.  Aroma: I get a very boozy, dark chocolate whiff right off the bat. Warms the nostrils. Not so much coffee flavor here, but a nice host of roasted malts are in the scent too.  Taste: This is a very unified, complex tasting beer. I think the alcohol melts all the flavors together. There is indeed a lot of dark chocolate bitterness that get complemented well by dark fruit and roasted malts.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This may be the slickest feeling beer I've ever had. It is chewy and warm, but hardly what you'd call viscous. There is a strong lingering taste to this beer, but it mostly comes in the form of a boozy heat, not cloying body. One of these will do you just fine. Probably no need to drink for than one of these in a night. Just too rich, boozy, and nuanced to have more than one.  Overall: I really loved this beer. I'm glad I've had it now so I can compare it to regular FBS.

Slight lacing, nothing major but for an 11.2% ABV beer, it's impressive.  S: Boozy bourbon notes up-front, dark rum, oak wood, roasted coffee and vanilla beans. Really intoxicating and delicious for a barrel-aged beer. Nicely done.  T: Bourbon notes come through immediately, hitting heavy and dominating the palate. It's not hot, so it's very bearable. Coffee beans are next to help take a bit of the edge off and provide some balance. Vanilla and more wood finish things off and leave a nice warming sensation in the throat.  M: Medium-full bodied, almost chewy, moderate carbonation.  Perhaps I've matured into appreciating (bourbon) barrel-aged beers much more than I did a few months ago.

S - Heavy coffee with subdued notes of bourbon and oak. T - Tastes strangely like a coffee malt/milkshake with a bitter lactose chocolate kick.

Good carbonation though. D - Medium. As said earlier, there is a lot going on, but it all lends itself to the sweet side. One bottle is MORE than enough.  Overall - I have had KBS many times. New.

Deep roasted malt flavors and notes of bitter chocolate in place of any perceptible hop character.  M: Light to medium body with low carbonation. Very smooth and rounded without any carbonic bite.

I taste a hint of chocolate at the front of my tongue.

S: Bourbon, chocolate, coffee. Bourbon and malt blend together exceptionally well to give that sweet chocolate effect. Soft coffee follows and along with vanilla and oak, contributes to a smooth yet complex aroma. Very nice.  T: Starts as nice blend of chocolate and roasted malt with molasses, bourbon and cherry. Smoothing effect of the coffee is noticeable through this stage. Bourbon flavor continues and gets progressively hotter, lingering through the slightly astringent finish.  M: Thick with light carbonation. Sticky sweet feel, but not as thick/frothy as what I consider the benchmark for mouthfeel in style - GD OA Yeti or GI BCS.  All in all, a great sipper.

Taste- Compared to the smell the bourbon is subtler than the other flavors that come through. I get mostly coffee, then the bourbon, and again very little chocolate/vanilla. But the flavors are very well balanced so in the taste category I rate this a little higher when compared to other BA stouts.

The aroma is most notably similar to well aged bourbon whiskey. The main difference is there is a wonderful bouquet of coffee, chocolate, bourbon, oak, vanilla and smoked malts that create a splendid melange of aromas for the nose. The taste is quite similar. There are the distinct flavors of a really good mocha coffee and bourbon whiskey to warm the cockles of the heart. Oak is one of the most prominent flavors on the tongue followed by hints of vanilla and butterscotch. The chocolate flavor works really nicely with the whiskey. The mouthfeel is interesting. The alcohol and bitterness which are indeed flavors are only preemptive of the smoothness that follows. This is a sipper by nature but goddamn if it isn't tasty and velvety smooth. I only have 2 thumbs to put up, but I wish I had more to tell you how good this beer is as a recommendation.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Nice lacing on the sides with a thin layer of tan, head like residue lasting for a few minutes. Smells overwhelmingly of coffee and alcohol. Hard to detect bourbon or vanilla but its there, just need to let it warm up a bit. Mouth feel at around mid 40's is okay but let it warm up to 50 degrees and it's right where it needs to be. Carbonation is subtle, but needs to be compensated with just a little more body. Taste is coffee all the way through with slight notes of vanilla and less of bourbon, both more prevalent as it warms towards the finish. Coffee is very, almost too intense. Some coffee like acidity balanced by some dark brown sugar towards the end as i finish the snifter. Definitely A little boozy too. Good beer? Yeah. Over hyped? For sure.

Taste follows the nose with coffee, vanilla, and a lot of alochol heat from the bourbon barrels. This beer takes bourbon barrel aged beers to a whole new level. Ridiculously good now and it will only get better with time as the bourbon mellows and the flavors blend together a little more.  Smooth and creamy mouth feel, not the thickest stout I've had, but about what I would expect from a barrel aged stout.

S: Sweet with coffee up front, back is bourbon all the way.  T: Bourbony, overwhelmingly so in the nose as the strong bitterness of the coffee hits the front of the mouth. Delicious carmelized hops and coffee dominate up front, then straight coffee, the straight up bourbon finish all the way to oblivion. The bourbon finish is enjoyably soft, yet potent. This, is a HUGE beer. The only fault in the taste could be that there is too much going on, I could see it being confusing, but not to my palate.  F: Rich, Velvet, Chocolate. The Feel is phenomenal.  D: For how massive this is, it goes down real smooth. A very drinkable, and very massive beer.

Finishes with some bitter coffee and chocolate notes and a warming alcohol.  M- Rich and creamy without being too syrupy. Would've liked a tad more carbonation, but this is near spot on.  D- Well, considering this tastes almost as much of whiskey as it does of beer, and has the ABV to prove it, you'd think it would be low. Well, it isn't.

If you could contain a black hole in a glass this it what it would look like.  It is not just black, it pulls light from the room.

I do not get the usual dark fruit or molasses in this. This beer seems more decadent and almost evil.  Did the snake offer Eve fruit...or was it KBS?  T: Yep...goin' to hell. This is too good. Chocolate and coffee are strong with some warming bourbon on the finish. Vanilla is there to along with the oak. The alcohol is not strong, assertive, or even a player in this. There is just a slight warmth on the finish that it provides.  Makes you want more.  M: Silky, smooth, light carbonation. Almost like a beer-shake. I cannot express the smooth feel of this beer and its full body in mere words. I have never had a beer this full and satisfying.  Chocolate Milk Steak might be a good comparison.

S: Dark Roasted Coffee put up evenly with Oaked Bourbon. Vanilla and sweet Milk Chocolate notes, as well as a kind of baking chocolate smell in there as well.  T: Great Balance. I get three phases, as most great beers have: 1) Coffee and roasty flavors up front. 2) Heavy Bourbon, Oak, Vanilla, and an Alcohol burn. 3) Creamy bitter chocolate finish also with a lingering sweetness as well. Great mix of Sweet, bitter, and savory flavors. Outstanding.  M: This is my favorite part. It is so creamy and smooth, coats but yet has just enough of a carbonation to it as well.

The booziness is mainly presented in odor, but this tastes quite palatable and very smooth at the high abv. At first I am reminded of Bourbon County Stout but this seems to be smoother and more evenly rounded. Both are great, I think this one is a little better and does not burn as much as BCS.  Lots of bourbon, chocolate and coffee. Not much roast, which surprised me. Little to no oak. However, the flavors present are excellent. They mesh well and are wonderfully assertive. Lots of vanilla and some caramel, as well. Actually, this is one of the most vanilla-forward beers I've had in awhile. Alcohol is present but stays inside the bourbon aroma.  Mouthfeel is relatively thick with a light carbonation. There is no ugly charred flavors rearing their head which makes this more desirable to me. I would say when compared to FBS, this is slightly smoother, not as dry with the oatmeal flavors and not as much char flavor whether or not it is just the bourbon barrel masking these flavors.

Let this beer warm up, then you can taste everything it has.  Mouthfeel - AS i said, you need a few drinks to let mouth get used to it. Your mouth gets coated with everything in the beer from the malts to the spices. After drinking this beer, you need to eat something or drink lots of water to recover.

Imperial Stout (of the finest kind) 11.2% ABV OG? 70 IBUs 12 oz bottle (from March 2010) poured into a New Belgium snifter on September 22, 2010.  Appearance 5/5 Pours black with a very dark brown head that is quick to dissipate into a thin collar. Expected from a high ABV barrel aged beer. Dark brown on the edges when held up to light.  Aroma 5/5 Coffee, dark chocolate, sweet bourbon in huge amounts. Some alcohol too, which is expected.  Taste 5/5 First impression is bliss. Bittersweet; malts and bourbon lend the sweetness, coffee and dark chocolate contribute towards the bitterness. Very rich, complex, and delicious taste that finishes bitter, and has a character like powdered chocolate. Some acidity of coffee is also felt. Alcohol warming is evident as well. But, this is not an extreme beer, it's a fine example of balancing the extremes.  Mouthfeel 5/5 Silky and full, but not very big. Medium carbonation, bitter, medium finish. Not cloying at all. A stronger body won't hurt this beer, but this is perfection as it is. Who am I to comment?  Drinkability 5/5 Given the alcohol, it's a sipper. But the great taste doesn't let it be one. I can keep drinking this forever.  Other When I had it first, I thought it was the best beer I ever had. Still belongs in my ""all time best beers"" category and for a beer of this kind, there's only one that comes close or equals or possibly exceeds it by a tiny bit: Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout.

On the other hand, I wouldn't quite call it a top tier stout, much less than a top five beer (it's currently at 5 on BA's list).  A: Pretty much perfect for an impy stout. This beer is solid black until you thin the liquid to less than ~1/2 inch. A full glass looks like espresso. The head is tan, about a shade lighter than expected, and very creamy, sticking to the sides with ease.  S: Lots of bourbon, chocolate and coffee. Not much roast, which surprised me.

Actually, this is one of the most vanilla-forward beers I've had in awhile. Alcohol is present but stays inside the bourbon aroma.  T: The taste is simpler than the aroma and a lot more booze comes through, particularly in the finish. I can feel some fusel notes creep up right as I swallow. The barrel notes seem to push the booze from warming goodness toward rubbing alcohol. It's not bad, but it just doesn't quite live up to the promise of the aroma. Fairly sweet with some pleasantly bitter coffee notes.  M: Smooth and fairly thick. I tried their Breakfast Stout recently, and it had a significantly better feel. So, I'm probably being a bit harsh here due to the comparison.  D: The booziness is wearing down my palate. It's a good, interesting beer, but the hotter bourbon notes are tiresome.

Not the darkest stout out there, not the most impressive looking, but note worthy none the less.  S: The nose is by far the best I've ever smelled on a stout. Pure mouth watering Bourbon backed with espresso bean, vanilla bean, and a slight cocoa bean.  T: The flavor profile is dominated by Bourbon. A healthy amount of time was spent in those barrels. Espresso is tame compared to FBS. Notes of chocolate want to poke trough, which I'm sure will with a little age. A little vanilla is present to smooth is all out.  MF: The mouthfeel is light for such a big stout. I expect this is due to the Bourbon. Would have liked a tad bit more carbonation also.  D: Drinkability is above average. Even mild Bourbon lovers will get a kick out of this brew.  Over all Founders KBS is an almost perfect stout. Compared to the big boys of the top 100, KBS IMO stands out as the reigning champ. This brew would make good ol' Jim Beam proud.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Appearance:The head is a mocha or cappuccino color, great viscosity, great lacing. The beer is black and opaque.  Taste:The flavors on the foreaste are charcoal, roasted malts, chocolate, dark chocolate, burnt toast, bourbon, and vanilla. On the midtaste, I get raisins or figs. The aftertaste is the same as the midtaste, but slowly fades away.  Mouthfeel:Medium to heavy body, really really smooth. Subtle carbonation that is trying really hard to get thru the thick liquid.

1199,19960,Gobzilla,4.42,"Thanx to nopucophop for sending one of these my way  A: poured a black like motor oil with absolutely no head present and honestly no lacing either sticking to the glass.  S: yup.... there is plenty of bourbon to go around with brown sugar, oak notes, slight, spice and toffee notes. I did get a little chocolate and roastiness but for the most part the bourbon dominated the nose.  T: like the nose the bourbon takes over the palate but does give a little room for the brown sugar, oak, vanilla, and chocolate, to take a peak. it also seemed to have coffee on the tail end of a sip but had cocoa coming through as well and slight hop character as well.  M: the brew was full body with a very low amount of carbonation which was sweet, silky, slight chewy, bitter, and boozy finish.  D: it drank pretty damn good considering the ABV on the beer and was really living up to all the hype. I have to say that it is a beefed up regular breakfast stout and is a brew you definitely have to share with friends.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S- Bourbon, dark roasted coffee, vanilla, and roasted malts. Very complex.  T- Wow. Doesn't get much better than this. Intensely complex with primary flavors being roasted malt, bourbon, vanilla, leather, coffee, and very dark chocolate. Just enough booze to hint at its strength.  M- Low carbonation and very smooth and silky. It actually pleasures my mouth.  D- A touch of heat from the alcohol prevents an exceptional drinkability rating but for the style and strength it is very good.  I love KBS. There is no way around it.

Really though, the head is too small.  S: Super cofee. Very much the dominant smell here. Maybe some nice graininess. But for me, this is too much coffee.  T: STILL pretty coffee, but not as much as I expected based on the aroma. It lacks the roasted graininess that I would like to see in a stout, but makes up for it in general robustness. There's a hint of vanilla in the finish, but none of the sweeter, dark fruit flavors that are often in a stout. I don't get any chocolate.  M: Smooth, supple and with good carbonation.

A- Pretty much pure black, has a coffee colored head. The head is pretty decent for the style, but fades very quickly.  S- Smells intense. Bourbon mostly, with hints of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and maltiness. There is a sweet and caramelly smell that comes through as well.  T- The heat from the bourbon hits first, but fades to notes of coffee, chocolate, and vanilla. Aftertaste is chocolate and bourbon. A very nice combination of flavors that keeps me coming back for more.  M- The beer is very well balanced. It has a pronounced bourbon flavor, with out being too overboard. It could use a little more time to mellow out, as the 07/08 KBS I've had are much smoother.  D- This is probably one of my favorite styles of beer, so I always want more KBS. The beer is very drinkable, and is less viscous that some similar beers. If it wasn't so strong, I could easily drink a couple bottles.  Definetely a classic, and always a welcome bottle in my cellar.

Pours with a slight one finger dark brown head. Below average retention. The head sticks nicely to the glass throughout this though.  Aroma: Very assertive dark chocolate and cocoa powder hits first. Strong hints of bourbon, vanilla, and espresso here too. Some of the alcohol can be noticed here and provides a little burn.  Taste: Gorgeously smooth upfront with strong dark chocolate and espresso. Subtle vanilla and bourbon do well to smooth out any harshness. Big burst of chocolate and cocoa powder toward the back end. Balaced, complex and truly sublime.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and very creamy. Smooth, but with a slightly dry finish.  Drinkability: This really is a strong beer in both ABV and flavor. While delicious and incredibly complex, I cannot imagine having more than one of these in a sitting. Just too decadent.  Overall, a truly gorgeous beer in many ways. Complex, balanced, and flavorful.

Kentucky - woods, bourbon. Breakfast - coffee, sweets. Stout - you get the booze.  Too strong a coffee taste is made up for in the complex other flavors to focus on.

Tastes like it smells; rich roasted dark coffee with a splash of bitter dark chocolate and a hint of bourbon and vanilla. Amazing.  Mouhfeel is creamy and smooth.  Dangerously drinkable although more than one or two would be a problem due to ABV.  I think the thing that sets KBS apart is that the bourbon and barrel aging don't overwhelm the beer.

1199,19960,sk8man121,4.36,"Bottle obtained in a trade w/ craytonic.  12 oz bottle poured into Unibroue snifter.  Before beginning, this is my first KBS and I want to make clear that the cap popped with almost no sound and poured no head whatsoever. Someone please feel free to BM me and let me know if this is common, as I'm worried perhaps I got a bottle with some issues.  A: Pours jet-black with no head whatsoever, even with a vigorous pour. Filmy mocha lacing sits atop this brew. As I said, this may be an off bottle, but I'm not impressed with how this looks at all.  S: Cocoa powder is strong upfront, as is vanilla, maple syrup, leather and a hint of freshly ground coffee beans. Smells great, although I'd like there to be a bit more bourbon present.  T: Mmmm...as roasty as it gets, and not overly sweet. Vanilla, cocoa and bourbon; the bourbon is a bit strong, but welcomed as far as I'm concerned, as the heat really brings out the more complex flavors in this brew. Outstanding.  M: Carbonation is low, which may be the result of a potentially poor bottle. Nevertheless, it fits the style and works fine. I'm happy to say that this beer isn't syrupy or overly viscous at all.  D: If I had a few more of these, I'd happily session them so long as I had nothing else to do. The high ABV (11.2%) is hidden extremely well; this drinks more like an 8% stout. I may have hyped this a bit too much in my own head, but I'd by lying if I said this wasn't a pleasurable experience.

1199,19960,Jeffo,4.42,"This is one of those highly anticipated brews that everyone tries to get their hands on every year. We were lucky to see a few bottles of Founder's regular Breakfast Stout trickle over here, and it quickly became one of my favorite beers of all time. When I saw some KBS included in a couple trades this past winter, my mouth started to water almost immediately. A big thanks goes out to NYCWheatFan and Masterski for giving my 1 year old boy some drooling competition in this house.  From a bottle into a snifter. I think I'll keep this bottle too. Vintage: 2010  APPEARANCE: Pours out thick black and sits jet black in the glass. Pour yields a small, medium-thick looking mocha colored head with good retention. Head slowly fades to a sparse wisp and ring. Only the ring remains until the end and leaves some nice splotchy lacing down the glass.  SMELL: Roasted malts, with lots of bourbon and vanilla as well. Some nice coffee beans in there as well as hints of cocoa, but the bourbon qualities really shine here.  TASTE: Really good, and much bolder and more balanced than the nose had led on. Roasted and smoky malt, bourbon and vanilla through the middle from the barrels of course, with some bitter coffee and chocolate at the finish. Some boozy heat near the end as well. Bold and lingering aftertaste is full flavored and well balanced. Like their regular Breakfast Stout, the flavor progression here is great; tells a story from start to finish.  PALATE: Medium body and very soft and creamy on the palate. Soft carbonation and somewhat lighter than anticipated. Goes down very smooth and finishes slightly dry on the palate. A bit of heat and a little bite at the end. Nice stuff, but could use a little more weight.  OVERALL: This brew is definitely worth the hype. The nose had me expecting a bit of an overly strong bourbon stout, but the taste profile is extremely well balanced, going through several stages from start to finish. Great stuff. I had to force myself to slow down. Definitely worth standing in line to get some of this every year. Given how much I loved their regular Breakfast Stout, I guess it's no surprise that this one was right up my alley. Thanks again for hooking me up with this world class brew gents!  EDIT: The 2019 batch of this was exported to The Netherlands. It's still delicious, even ten years later. Excellent.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S-Dark chocolate, espresso, bourbon, vanilla, burnt sugar. One of the most complex, unique, and intense noses I have ever encountered, simply amazing.  T-Bourbon explosion to start. Chocolate fudge, espresso, cream, coconut, and hint of brown sugar. As it warms the espresso stands out alongside the bourbon more and some oak flavors creep in. There is also a slight alcohol presence. Very, very complex to say the least.  M-Thick, rich, creamy, and silky smooth. Almost syrupy.  D-Good, but due to its complexity, its high alcohol content, and especially its strong bourbon flavor cut into the drinkability. I couldn't drink two of these in one sitting.

Some mixtures of bourbon whiskey, dark chocolates, light coffee, and sweet sugars. The taste is just as complex and smooth as I was hoping for.

1199,19960,berkey,4.49,"12 oz bottle poured into a tulip 08/11/10. I've been looking forward to this one for awhile.  Pours completely black. A rough pour coaxes up a small tan head which settles to a narrow ring along the perimeter of the glass.  The aroma is incredible on this beer. Coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and wood almost completely manage to mask the alcohol which lingers nicely in the background.  Chocolate on the entry and more coffee as is progresses across the palate. Seems there's a fairly prominent hop flavors for the style which actually seems to enhance the bitter sharpness of the coffee character. Of course alcohol comes through on the aftertaste in a beer as strong as this but it's relatively subtle and adds a pleasant warming. I let it warm quite a bit before sampling but even more chocolate and an almost dark fruity character start coming through as it completes the journey to room temperature.  Carbonation is very low but that's not really a huge problem for me in this style. Wish the body was a bit fuller but I'm not going to sweat the details too much as this is a very enjoyable beer.  What's this? A Bourbon barrel aged Stout that allows the barrel influence to do it's work without drowning out the base beer? What a concept!

T - The first note that hits is a surprising tartness, which is indicative of it's 70 IBU rating, but it is immediately followed by the sweetness you expect from this kind of beer. The coffee flavor brings up the rear and finishes very mildly leaving a pleasant carmel aftertaste. Gets a much stronger bourbon character once you let it warm up to room temp.  M - Perfect. It's velvet on the tongue. If it weren't for the taste you might not know it was there.  D - The only reason this rating is so low is because you have to drink it at breakfast. You just have to. Any other time of day and it wouldn't be a breakfast stout. However, the kind of mornings for which you need a breakfast stout are limited so the drinkability is necessarily a bit low. Definitely not gonna give you the same buzz as a cup of coffee.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,uturn,4.67,"12oz capped bottle poured into a Dogfish Head snifter.  A: Pours dark brown to just about black, leaving a thin dark tan head.  S: The first sniff you get is loaded with coffee, then you find some cocoa and a mild hint of the bourbon.  T: As far as the taste goes, it's of roasted coffee, chocolate and just the right amount of bourbon, if you dig down you could pick up some of the vanilla.  M: Thick, rich and creamy.  D: You only get some mild heat form the 11.2%, but it's still a sipper for sure.  This is the ""best"" bourbon barrel aged stout I've had to date.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,gcpanda,4.9,"Found this at a 10th anniversary celebration for a bar I frequent. Poured a very dark brown/black with light head and a strong vanilla/coffee aroma. Taste was intense, largely of vanilla, and bourbon. Definitely something you sip as opposed to full on drinking. If you can find it, definitely worth a taste.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Lazerlobe,4.3,"2010  A: Pours thick, black and creamily with minimal beige head.  S: Old coffee, booze, woodsy scents and light vanilla  T: Bourbon and percolated coffee dominate first, with molasses, oak and booze filled chocolate subtly working their way in. I'm having a tough time picking out the hops because the rest of the beer is overwhelming. Pretty hot still, but the aftertaste is like tiramisu with a kahlua based sauce drizzled over it.  M: Luxurious and creamy, the carbonation is spot on. Gentle mixing with the tongue whips it in to a velvety cream.  D: My first KBS, I'll let the rest mellow out a few years. A solid drink all around.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ZeroSignal,4.8,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle  A - Pours motor oil black with a good one finger's worth of cappuccino colored head. Retention settles to a thin layer but remains until the end; sticky lacing.  S - Immediate smell after pouring is like Hershey's Chocolate Syrup. After sitting for a bit, notes of coffee bean, espresso, chocolate, and a woody/earthy aroma come through. A bit of alcohol is also present in the nose.  T&M - Thick and full bodied but smooth. Many bold flavors; chocolate, vanilla bean, cocoa nibs, and a big earthy presence. There is a woodsy, ashy quality here that contributes to the earthy factor. Fresh roasted espresso beans and coffee notes. The finish is somewhat tannic with a bit of alcohol warmth, and the chocolate and coffee notes seem to linger forever.  D - I wouldn't guess that this was over 11% ABV. What a tasty, deicious and drinkable beer. So many flavors but all well balanced. This is a home run from Founder's, and it would get solid 5's from me but for the high ABV impacting the drinkability  Notes - I was actually expecting this beer to be over hyped and not as good as described...I was very happily proven wrong. I think this beer would be fantastic with dessert or as an aperitif, but my pairing preference would be tiramisu.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,cbak999,4.82,"Big Thanks to CampusCrews for the trade that allowed me to sample this treat. The month is not readable on the bottle, but the year is defintely 2010.  A- Black. Simple as that. A small tan head that quickly fades to a ring around the glass. There is no light getting through this beer.  S- Bourbon, chocolate and coffee, in that order. But the overwhelming smell is the sweet bourbon.  T- Coffee is the first taste. Then boubon is the first aftertaste. The predominant aftertaste fades to chocolate. This beer is complex!! There are so many other tastes going on.  D- I love it! The 11.2% is well hidden, but not so much that you forget that you are drinking a monster stout - the king of imperial stouts. This beer is awesome....there is no doubt it stands up to the hype! I only wish it were more readily available.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,adrock314,4.15,"12oz bottle served in Unibroue tulip. I've had KBS quite a few times now this season so I figured it was time I reviewed one.  A: High viscosity is apparent from the pour. Looks like old motor oil. No light whatsoever seems to be able to permeate this one. Half and inch of light brown head initially that quickly dwindles to a thin ring.  S: Dark roasty malt. Charred, but in a good way. Vanilla and oak along with chocolate and coffee. Cappuccino? Little bit of toffee.  T: Sweet up front, almost too much so. Combination of semisweet and dark chocolate with some chocolate syrup to boot. Coffee makes an appearance. I feel like the bourbon is present in an appropriate amount. Sometimes it gets overdone (I'm looking at you GIBCS) but KBS gets it about right. Finishes bitter in preparation for the next sip.  M: Viscous and slick. Low carbonation.  D: Complex and interesting. Evolves over the course of 30-60 minutes.  I'm a very big fan of Founder's and KBS is no exception. It is a great beer, however, given its high price and limited availability you can do better. Old Raspy, Peche Mortel, Yeti, and Founder's Imperial Stout are all more readily available, easier on the wallet, and arguably as good or better than KBS. Don't get me wrong, I rate this beer highly and I'll continue to pick up some of this every year. I just feel that this is one of those beers in which rarity plays a big role in its lofty reputation.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,chase2634,4.47,"This beer pours a dark black with a dark brown head that settles down to a nice ring around my glass.  The smell is of coffee, bourban, chocolate, burnt malt. Excellent aroma.  The flavor is very complex. First you get a bit of coffee presence in the front but it is fought off with the bourban nose. The middle is a lot of chocolate and roasted malt. The finish is a mixture of bourbon, chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, and i think even a hint of caramel. All of these flavors just blend together perfectly.  The mouthfeel is full bodied with medium carbonation. Very creamy with fine carbonation. Seems to get creamier as it warms up. I caught myself almost trying to chew this beer at times. So much flavor!  Well balanced and smooth. Goes down pretty darn easy to say the least.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,a10t2,4.57,"12 oz brown stubby, no lot number or date I can find. Pretty neat label art IMHO. Poured into a imperial pint nonic.  A: Pours a viscous, opaque black, but without the legs you might sometimes see on a beer this big. A few tiny wisps of head that fade within the first few minutes, but actually some good persistent lacing all the way down.  S: A distinct whiff of coffee as soon as it's poured, then a more aggressive sniff reveals fairly intense roasty and chocolatey notes. Maybe a hint of spicy or noble hop character. No alcohol.  T: Very up-front in the chocolate, then some coffee, then the vanilla and/or oak flavors come through. Alcohol starts to be felt in the middle of the palate, then builds throughout. The aftertaste is distinctly reminiscent of a good dark chocolate. Extremely complex and long-lived flavor profile.  M: Surprisingly light, some moderate carbonation is apparent. Alcohol is definitely there, but never solventy or overly harsh. Faint oily slickness is left behind, making you want to wash it down with another sip.  D: This is not a session beer by any means, but for what it is it's hard to imagine it being any more drinkable. Highly recommended.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ncaudle,4.45,"Poured from 12oz bottle into snifter.  Pours a nice black color with a slight brownish colored head.  Bourbon. No avoiding that but at the same time, one sip you get the dark chocolate aroma, while the next is an espresso, then a sweet molasses, etc. Keeps you guessing which one will pop up as you drink.  Lightish mouth feel. Not bad, but the barrel aging has thinned down the oatmeal base maybe a touch too much.  Still very drinkable, even at the higher ABV.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,unclejimbay,4.59,"Thanks to CampusCrew for sharing this brew on a recent brew day for us to enjoy and discuss.  Appearance was dark coffee in color with a short tan head and limited if any retention. Aromas of roasty dark malts, mellow burbon and oak whispers without being overly done. Coffee, roasted chocolate and some sweetness sneaks in. Big on taste. Tasets as it smells. Warms up nice with a silky smooth mouthfeel, low carbonation and well done hop support. Mellow but evident bitterness.  Possibly a bit hyped? Sure, possibly... This beer is a well crafted Impy Stout for sure, I would pursue it again, but dont think I could drink more than one given its jam packed with flavor, body and character. Sip and enjoy this one at an appropriatte slow pace. This one requires some time to earn the full respect and complexity it deserves. Ok... I now think I need another one to fully do it justice.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,TheHoppiest,4.75,"Poured from the standard Founders squat bottle into a pint glass. This is my second time having this brew, and I'm quite eager to enjoy it.  Pours an inky black, with a deep tan head that slowly dissipates, clinging slight;y to the sides as it does so.  Has a rich, mocha flavor, dark chocolate and coffee. Alcohol, burnt toffee, and vanilla slightly tickle the nose as well.  Mmmmm, this is as tasty as I remember, better, even, as I allowed it to get good and warm. Rich and creamy, the sweet mocha flavor fades as a burnt coffee bitter rises as the tip of the tongue. Vanilla wamth flows down the throat with a pleasant alcohol burn. This is a pleasant, warming, soothing brew, perfect at the end of the day. I wish I had a few more in the basement to savor on a cooler day than today.  Mouthfeel is like silk, exquisitely smooth and rich.  Highly sipable, one to enjoy slowly.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,BuckyFresh,4.6,"Appearance: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a large wine glass. Pours an oily, opaque, black color with a thin chocolate head that dissipates rapidly. I can pick up some dark brown during the poor, but once this stuff is in the glass, very little light finds its way through. Some sticky lacing present as well, but not to a great degree.  Smell: Roasted coffee, molasses, and dark chocolate are the major aromas at play here. The alcohol is fairly detectable and the bourbon adds something nice as well. Overall, the nose has great depth and complexity, with smells varying from very rich to very light and sweet.  Taste: Very smooth and much less boozy than I anticipated. The oak character goes a long way in offsetting a lot of the sweetness, and there is a bit of a bitter quality that is quite refreshing. The coffee, molasses and chocolate are discernible, but the bourbon and oak stand out amongst the other flavors. Top notch!  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, but fairly balanced because of the oak presence. Creamy, and smooth. The alcohol/bourbon warms the soul and lasts throughout the tasting experience.  Drinkability: Delicious, but intense. I think I might be able to have two of these, but beyond that I think it might get to be a little much.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,EgadBananas,4.14,"This thing is sexy. Complete absence of color; opaque. A vigorous pour yielded a big mocha brown head. clumpy, stick lacing ensues.  Smells rich of chocolate, alcohol and coffee. The alcohol actually fits into the aroma wonderfully. As a whole though it's slightly underwhelming. Still inviting.  Dark chocolate roast coffee. That's my initial impression. The alcohol punches you in the face, then caresses you and tells you everything is okay. It's a wonderful meld.  This is a thick, full, sludge of a stout and I wouldn't have it any other way.  This is strong, but in no way off-putting. 1 is everlasting in a night, despite it's desirability.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Bourbon, chocolate and coffee, these are a few of my favorite things, with a bit of vanilla to round it out. Amazingly balanced, despite all the big flavors.  M - Smooth and creamy with perfect ""prickly"" carbonation. There is a bit of alcohol burn, but I like it. It lets you know you are drinking something with bourbon in it and it puts hair on your chest!  D - I could live off this. I fell in love on first sip, easily one of my favorites of all time.

Color is jet black with an initial one finger light brown sugar colored head whose consistency reminds me of the foam present on hot cocoa. Smell is bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, and malted milkshake upfront with undertones of coffee. Taste has coffee burnt sugar and unsweetened chocolate present with toasty malt in the background and the finish is a bit too bitter for me for a stout like this.

1199,19960,Infamous7100,4.82,"A: Pitch black with a very, very thin tan head. S: The smell of fresh coffee comes wafting out upon pouring followed up by waves of chocolate and bourbon. Reminds me of the bourbon balls on Derby day. Just an outstanding blend. T: Absolute perfection. Coffee and chocolate hits you right away and is accompanied by some vanilla. The bourbon rears its head toward the back and makes you take notice. However, not one flavor is too dominate. Founders was spot on when they brewed this. M: Slick and creamy. A nice aftertaste thats not too dry and a slight burn from the high ABV. D: Somehow, with all that is going on with this beer, it manages to stay highly drinkable and not too filling. Use discretion at 11% ABV, but this tastes so good, you might as well have another because you aren't going anywhere. Kudos.

1199,19960,Cylinsier,4.52,"Bottle.  Pours pitch black, with a dark tan head that is little more than a lacing to begin with and dissipates down to about nothing.  Smells of roasted coffee beans and dark chocolate.  Tastes mildly smokey, a bit chocolaty and a little bacony. Has a good bourbony taste as it warms up.  Feels full with little carbonation.  The best imperial stout I've ever had. Too strong to drink a lot, but I would do it anyway.  Edit: After a recent tasting, I feel the need to dial this back a tad. It's still superb and a beer everyone should try, but it's not quite as good as it was when I first tried it.

While a strong coffee aroma, the taste was not as strong in that area. Sooo nice and smooth with a good bit of chocolate. The high alcohol content does not present itself. Many other in this style leave me with a headache even after just one, but not this one. Is really at the top of my list now.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Bouleboubier,4.47,"They aren't kidding. This tastes like Kentucky, breakfast, AND stout.  ""Kentucky"" in that the scent of bourbon, the smoky quality and alcohol, wafts upon the surface. It surfaces in the flavor much the same way, with the smoke in the middle and the burn at the end.  ""Breakfast"" in that a straight-up coffee flavor dominates the taste. If I didn't know that they used a lot of coffee in the recipe, I would've went nuts trying to figure out how they achieved that. I must admit, this has by far the best utilization of coffee in a beer I've ever had. Normally, I detest coffee in beer, but I can't deny this is fantastic.  ""Stout"" in that underneath supporting the ""Kentucky Breakfast"" characters is a solid stout. Probably would stand on its own quite well.  The components of the flavor are all expertly separated and balanced. With each sip, you may get more coffee than the bourbon, or more bitter malt roast than the coffee, and so on. Surprises with that and the fact that, at 11.2%, it's too damn easy to knock back. Nice dry finish doesn't hurt either.  I would most definitely drink this again - morning, noon, or night.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

With the oatmeal almost gone and the chocolate very subdued this is all about the coffee and a bit of the barrel.

The smell surprises me a bit, much less bourbon than I had imagined but it is in there. Chocolate, some fresh coffee, roasted malt and a slight hint of vanilla. Color me impressed so far.  KABLOW! Man the taste is insane. Just delicious, I would say the best IS I have had up until this point. Great balance between sweet chocolate, bitter coffee and the bourbon. So much going on here, very complex. Bitter chocolate, coffee, bourbon, malts, picking up on all of these but the coffee and chocolate really shine. Just outstanding.  Mouthfeel is perfect. So smooth and luscious with perfect carbonation. Somewhat thick and syrupy but in an amazing way. I could sip on this all day, this is the beverage that makes a man feel smooth as shit. Mouthfeel is pure pimpin.  Drinkability? Well it suffers due to the fact that I cannot get it on a regular basis and now have to plot to trade for enough to last me the winter this year, but aside from that its great. Smooth, the alcohol is present but never on your mind while drinking. Defiantly a sipper, but more to savor the complexity than anything.

Alcohol is mixed in as the beer warms. Some subtleties that i picked up on, hard to distinguish with my palate.  Mouthfeel is nice, not too carbonated, just the right amount for the style.

1199,19960,Beerandraiderfan,4.78,"Broke this out for the ol' 4th of July weekend celebration right before the awesome UFC 116 fights.  And while I'm seguing, this heavyweight beer is like a hybrid of the best two heavyweight fighters: massive and daunting strength and size of Brock Lesnar, with the technique, skill, consistency and acclaim of Fedor Emelianenko. A big giant thick black pour. Good bourbon smell, notes of vanilla and cherry as well.  But damn, if the chocolate wasn't clearly the most established taste. I remarked, if Younger's has a Double Chocolate Stout, this is a Quadruple Chocolate Stout. Just immense. So smooth, there's 11+% alcohol here? The chocolate smothers it. But it doesn't smother the vanilla, oak and cherry flavors. They are embraced throughout and so smooth.  At around $5 for a 12oz. stout of this caliber, its a pretty good deal. I think I like it more than Abyss, but then again, Abyss was so easy to get out here, whereas this, I have to go back to my Milwaukee homies to hook this up. We'll see how future tastings (got 2 more to go) work out. As far as my first, excellent, and could easily be the world champion stout.

It's how you would want your coffee to taste in the morning. It's extremely smooth and milky. It again is just perfect. It's so drinkability due it being amazing in all of the above categories.

Very excited to try this beer!  A: Bottle poured into my new Great Divide Brussels glass. Jet black with a very dark brown head, close to Marshal Zhukov's in head color. Very dark and thin head that settled to a brown ring atop this black beast.  S: Barely have to put my nose into this one to smell it. Without even attempting to smell I picked up a gigantic dark coffee and rich roasty malts. Putting the nose to the beer only accentuates the previous aromas. Fresh ground coffee, vanilla, some sweet bourbon. Huge semisweet chocolate aroma, and a bit of burnt wood. Only picking up a bit of alcohol, can only imagine how this will mellow out with age.  T: A near perfect balance of sweetness and roasted malts. Great alcohol presence. The bourbon comes through very nicely and is mellowed by the vanilla bean on the palate. Never had a beer that tasted like a spoonful of fresh ground, dark roast coffee beans. Picks up all the woody qualities of the oak barrels, along with the sweetness. Has an aftertaste of bourbon whiskey. Very complex flavors here. Slight maple syrup flavor on the end.  M: Incredibly rich and full bodied with no one element outweighing the other. Thick and syrupy like a barleywine, roasty and dry like an RIS. Excellent heat from the alcohol that doesn't overpower the beer. Flavor lingers for quite a while after each sip.  D: Easy does it with this one, slow and steady. This beer offers so many levels of flavor each and every sip that it needs to be enjoyed slowly. Appreciate its complexities with a good book or just as a great night cap! I am also tempted to try one of these in the morning instead of my morning cup...

1199,19960,KickInTheChalice,4.3,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter.  Appearance: Pitch black, with a small brown head. Some light lace, but nothing significant sticking to the glass. After just a few moments, nothing more than a ring remains around the glass.  Smell: Chocolate and roasted malt, somewhat sweet. Coffee, oak, and bourbon are noticeable as well. Vanilla seems to have faded from the aroma at this point.  Taste: Starts out with the taste of bittersweet chocolate, dark chocolate malt, and roasted malt. Burnt sugar and molasses sweetness comes in next, some light vanilla too, and some booziness gradually seeps into the flavor. Coffee is firmly mixed with the roasted malt flavor, but does not overpower. The finish is more bitter chocolate and a little bourbon.  Mouthfeel: Extremely full bodied; nice and creamy. Carbonation is almost crowded out by the motor oil thickness.  Drinkability: Booze flavor gets the best of me pretty fast, but other than that this is a fantastic sipper.

Getting hints of bourbon, coffee, and bittersweet dark chocolate in the background as well. Some alcohol is present but no where near overpowering like a lot of fresh imperial stouts. Just enough to give it a slight sting on the tongue and fullness. Really well blended and full of so many flavors!

Drinkability - For how complex this beer is, I was able to drink the 4-pack in one sitting with ease.

S - Dark chocolate and some coffee with sweet vanilla and bourbon notes. The bourbon is discernible but is not overwhelming in the nose.  T - The palate has more pronounced bourbon notes at first that become less evident as I drink the beer. Even initially the bourbon is not overwhelming but is definitely the most up front flavour. There is some sweetness here too that is derived from the vanilla flavour and provides a nice compliment to the bourbon. As the beer warmed up even more there were more pronounced coffee and chocoalte notes that were well balanced with the bourbon and vanilla. An outstanding beer.  M - Medium to thick body.

1199,19960,BobZ,4.52,"Last night I poured 3 bottles of KBS. 2010, 2011, and 2012 releases. Split the bottles with a friend (as my wife is not a fan of either Bourbon or Stouts).  Minutia: 2012 into Duvel Tulips, 2011 into St. Bernardus chalices, and 2010 into Aventinus Eisbock glasses.  The differences were noticeable but not extreme:  The 2012 had the Chocolate, Coffee, and Bourbon, with a fair amount of Vanilla flavors. The bourbon caused the beer to finish a little on the ""sharp"" side but in all honesty if I wasn’t doing a side-by-side tasting I'm not sure it would have been that noticeable.  The 2011 had the same three components and contrary to what I expected, the coffee flavor hardly diminished (or fell-off) at all, the bourbon mellowed nicely and the beer finished incredibly smooth.  The 2010 did have a more noticeable drop in coffee but again not ""extreme drop-off"" by any means, the chocolate was more prevalent and the finish had a more noticeable warmth.  I'd have to say the 2011 was the most enjoyable for me, a shame there are only 2 bottles of that year left in the cellar but based on my experience I'll be drinking them sooner rather than later.  Still a great beer that deserves its rep. Never sticky or cloying as it warms (as this was my primary complaint with BCBS as it became like molasses as it warmed) just enjoyable start to finish. Again drinking all three years at the same time, going back and forth, was a great way to enjoy them.  --- 12 oz. Bottle. Thanks to Billy at Muckey's for holding a couple of bottles for me.  Appearance: Very dark brown almost black. Rich with a quickly dissipating dark tan head. Lacing is strong throughout the beer (start to finish).  Smell: Very good and complex, you get everything, coffee, bourbon/booze, and strong chocolate. A lot going on here and it all smells great.  Taste: Wow, all of the flavors in the scent come through in great balance, so clean, literally explodes off the palate, great flavor complexity with no after taste. Great beer!  Mouth feel: Smooth as can be for such a deep and complex beer.  Drinkability: Because it's so rich it's a one beer per session type of beer.

The alcohol presence did not make an appearance and let me enjoy it much more than I thought I would be able to.  If you see this on draft, do not pass it up.

Taste: At first notes of chocolate, pine and coffee greet the palate. There is a nice dark chocolate flavor abundant in this beer. Some charred oak flavors couple with a bourbon like boozyness. As the drink warms, the alcohol becomes more noticable, but it does not overpower the chocolate, oak and vanilla. Complexities abound but the palate is never confused, in fact, it accepts all the flavors at once.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, good amount of carbonation. A bit oily and slick.

S: Bourbon aroma grabs first followed by dark coffee, dark chocolate, licorice, and roasted malts. Hops are hard to appreciate with everything else going on, but there is definitely some earthy, tobacco notes as it warms.  T: Bursting with dark roasted flavors such as coffee, roasted malts, and barely bitter dark chocolate. The bourbon barrel aging produces a lot of whiskey flavor but it acts as an accompaniment rather than the lead act here and enhances the coffee and dark chocolate flavors while masking the ABV effectively. The tobacco notes of the hops are prominent as it warms. A really nice bourbon-tinged, coffee stout, but I still think I like Espresso Oak Aged Yeti fresh for the price as a coffee-infused imperial stout.  M: Wonderful balance of creamy carbonation and silky big-bodied brew that layers the tongue. Aftertaste lasts for many minutes with coffee, dark chocolate, and bourbon.

Finish is chocolate, char, and bourbon.  Mouthfeel -- Velvety, full-bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. Sharp alcohol bite in the finish.

The smell is heavy with bourbon, but chocolate and coffee are there in full support. I like that the flavors are present above the roasted scents that often accompany stouts.  Taste is just straight up comforting. I'm all about whiskeys and the bourbon variety is no exception. Chocolate and coffee come up first with some of the classic oak-imparted flavor. Bourbon comes heavy in the finish providing a sweet and boozy sensation. There is no mistaking the alcohol in this one but it works for the benefit of this beer, I think the warmth adds to the experience of this.

F: As in the aroma, toasted and roasted malts are present, but the balance of this beer leans toward the coffee and bourbon. The only hops that I could possibly perceive would be in the finish which are coupled with an oak bitterness/tang.  M: To me this beer was surprisingly light in body, and I was expecting more chew. There is a slight warmth from the bourbon but not overpowering. I couldn't perceive any creamy feeling. There was a slight astringency from the oak/bourbon/hops in the finish but is appropriate to style.  O: I really enjoyed this beer. The coffee and bourbon play really well together. The only suggestions for improvement I could give are in the way of mouthfeel. This beer was lacking in body to me, but the aromatics and taste more than make up for the slight shortfall.

A - An onyx shade with a thin cap of medium brown like crema on espresso. The clarity is opaque and the head retention is decent w/ spattering of lace taking hold to the small snifter.  S - At once the full nose has fruity deep plum and aromas of bourbon with vanilla and cocoa odors following closely . the notes of wood follow the dark malt, but no strong roasted aroma, simply a coffee, vanilla, bourbon and chocolate blend that smells slightly of alcohol  M - The feel has the oaky tannin of a bourbon barrel yet smooth coffee oil and cocoa astringency are all downplayed by the full foundation of sturdy stout. The chewiness is moderate as is the carbonation and the dry finish still carries a slight note of alcohol from the bourbon barrel with some hops and spiced notes of cocoa, coffee and vanilla  T - The taste....whoah, the taste! That took me back for a second to fresh KBS I tried after Dark Lord day 2 years ago - a full on chewy chocolate malt and vanilla flavor which submits gradually to a hop like pine spice and coffee note which leads to the element that gives the beer its name -bourbon and oak. The mild yet sweet bourbon is drenched in vanilla creaminess and cocoa flavors which have sweet and roasted edges and tinges of nuttiness from the wood complete the flavor. Like a fudge truffle with its rich full cocoa notes and the bourbon taste is the icing on the proverbial cake with intense pine hoppiness creating a contrast that makes fresh KBS the best stout I have had probably with exception of Canadian breakfast stout. The hop finish is delicious and provides a mild bitter dry finish  D - I consider the KBS experience the top of the pack, the pinnacle if you will, I had three of these and as strong as it is it still seems balanced and not at all like an 11% stout. The barrel is used deftly as an ingredient and adds to the delicious tastes of the stout, coffee and vanilla without intrusion, the flavors are all melded together expertly and I think the draft is ever so slightly more drinkable than the bottle.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I'm reviewing the bottled version (I was able to score a four-pack for a whopping $30) but it was wonderful on tap, too (obviously).  A: Pours thick, thick, thick. It'd be a waste of quality beer to try this, but I'm pretty sure if you rubbed it in some old hinges, they'd stop squeaking. Pours with little to no head (though I have no complaints about that in this case, because the milk chocolate-colored lacing is beautiful and never ever goes away).  S: From the moment the cap is pried off the bottle, the smell of this beer fills the room. Upon further sniffing around my Unibroue tulip, I can quickly pick up bourbon, oak, and vanilla; with chocolate and coffee not far behind. The wonderful thing about the bourbon aroma is that it's buttery and sweet, and is lacking in any of the more aggressive characteristics of bourbon (there's no aggressive boozy smell to this beer).  T: Perfection. A smoky vanilla and oak flavor (with a ton of sweet sweet bourbon notes), followed by bittersweet chocolate, and finishing with bitter, ultra-high quality black coffee. Takes your tongue on an incredible ride from the beginning of a sip to the end.  M: Chewy. Feels thick in the mouth, but once swallowed, there's a nice carbonation tingling and oh-so-slight alcohol burn that reminds you that you can't just keep drinking this all night long. The fact that it's impossible to find this beer is also a good reminder of that in and of itself, though.  D: Even if you want to guzzle it down, this is a beer that you should cherish and savor over the course of an hour or two. I'm the kind of guy who buys an iced coffee and never takes his mouth off the straw until he's left with a stomachache and an empty cup three minutes later. So it's difficult not to just attack this beer, because it's just SO DAMN DELICIOUS. But resist. You'll be rewarded with every prolonged sip.  One of the best beers ever. I've been on a roll lately when it comes to stouts, and I don't want it to end.

1199,19960,scottyshades,4.95,"Big thanks to Beerwolf77 for this extra  Part of an epic tasting, along with Sculpin, BCS, BCBCS, and more.  A: Pours a syrupy, viscous-looking, black oil color with a small brown (almost purple) head. Truly a thing of beauty.  S: Ahhh...coffee, oak barrels are apparent in the nose giving a woody note, bourbon (but MUCH more balanced and manageable than BCS)- and not very hot at all, only a little chest warming. Vanilla, a hint of dark berries, toffee, molasses, brown sugar, lactose, oats, chocolate, maple syrup, and a roasted/slightly burnt malt character.  T: See above; nearly identical. The maple syrup is a little less pronounced in the flavor, but you can still get a slight whiff. Bourbon is essentially blended flawlessly into the rest of the profile. Lactose is present and gives a good cream flavor that really goes well with the chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla.  MF/D: Super (I emphasize super) viscous body- one of the biggest I've tasted. Alcohol is very well hidden, and the bourbon is not boozy at all, rather complementary. Low carbonation. This is the closest-to-a-5 beer I've reviewed.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,augustgarage,4.47,"A very generous extra, courtesy of ShogoKawada (a million thanks!). Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Portsmouth tulip.  Opaque, charcoal-tinged seal brown with a low camel head which has decent retention despite being diminutive. Thick clear bands of tears suspend the fine lacing like specimens under slides.  Rich fresh roast coffee, brown butter, light toasted malt, and faint cocoa nibs in the nose. Hints of vanillin and coconut suggest bourbon, but it is free of solventy aromas.  Like dipping milk chocolate into Buffalo-Trace-spiked fresh french-press coffee, this is quite a drinking experience. Bold flavors duke it out, but no single taste emerges victorious. Brown sugar, anise, and light oaky notes round out the profile. Strong yet mellow finish with a lingering smokiness from the charred barrels and a faintly bittersweet aftertaste.  Thick, creamy, chewy, and lush, but with just enough carbonation - everything the style should be.  The ABV sneaks up on you a bit, so I don't recommend more than one of these for breakfast - the char begins to wear on the palate by the end of the glass as well, so I think the standard Breakfast Stout wins out in the drinkability contest.  A very impressive stout, worth seeking out if you love bourbon and black coffee.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,LauraAlberts,5,"Bottle of 2009 Vintage KBS poured into a large snifter.  Appearance: the ideal, motor oil, watery rim, chocolatey/tan head - nice lacing on glass.  Smell: Bourbon, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, hint of pecan, fresh cotton, tree bark, leather, hint of pinaud aftershave,  Taste: vanilla, milk chocolate - a chocolate flavor that melds with the buttery oak flavor to create a smooth flavor, the hops mold with the coffee flavor to dry out the mid-back end and the rest is smooth bourbon whisky, semi-sweet chocolate morsel, clove, honey, molasses, a hint of citrus/hop bitterness/sour acidity comparable to lemon. This beer screams hot toddy! Hot chocolate chip cookies.  Mouthfeel: silky, thick, smooth, dry, crisp, fills every corner of your mouth - robust, chewy - bourbon cleans up the finish with a minty mouthfeel on the roof of my mouth.  Drinkability: a sipper, however, were it readily available in keg form, I'd probably drink it non stop - I could probably hit this beer like the glaze curtain at Krispy Kreme. Beautifully crafted.

Starts off with some vanilla and coffee notes. Lots of smokey oakiness in this beer. REminds me of Black Butte XXI. Some whisky and cognac smells. ohh and some more vanilla.  Tastes like a ton of smoke, like I am licking the inside of a fresh barrel. Bourbon is there too. Has a fresh oaky/coffee twang to it. Creamy mouthfeel, not super thick, just creamy. Some chocolate and reoasted malt flavors. This beer has a lot going on. To age or not to age that is the question.

1199,19960,morebeergood,4.57,"Found singles for sale in central MA a couple months back, and decided to drink one tonight. Poured into a DFH oversized snifter. The color of this beer is black as tar. I have not seen a beer recently that was this dark. Thick, caramel colored head forms at the very end of the pour. Nice lacing on the glass. Smell is intense. Lots of vanilla and aromatic coffee notes, with a hint of smokiness. The smell is boozy and sweet, but the flavor is dry and balanced. There is a definite bourbon flavor, but that is matched equally with a coffee liqueur counterpoint. An amazing amount of flavors that don't overwhelm each other, but all are in harmony. Mouthfeel was probably one of the ""chewiest"" beers I can recall. At first, it reminded me of syrup or pudding. But it mellowed out to be more stout like. I actually preferred this beer cold right out of the bottle. It seemed to lose some of the mouthfeel and flavor as it warmed up. Call that odd, but it seemed to be the opposite most times as true for me this time. Took a while to drink this beer, due to the viscosity, the abv and overall size of this beer. One serving was enough for me, but that one bottle was quite a journey. A great brew.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,Ryan011235,3.97,"Poured into a snifter on 5/19/10  2010 Vintage  The color is dark cola syrup brown; no surprise it settles jet black. I didn't actively try to pour a large head; I didn't need to. Medium brown colored foam rose to a full two fingers with little effort on my part. Mostly comprised of tiny bubbles, it has receded to a layer of larger bubbles that initially rested on top. Swirling keeps the foam alive, but lacing doesn't seem fully inclined to hang around.  The aroma is impressive in its rustic approach. Everything about it seems antiquated; a few sniffs called to mind an old, dusty junk shop. I consider this a plus. I'm surprised the bourbon notes aren't more prominent; instead there is a distinct oak aroma accented by a swaths of vanilla. Beneath the timbres barrel-aging provide are notes of coffee beans, more-bitter-than-sweet dark chocolate & molasses. Maybe some licorice. A very mild yeasty bread dough wisp is noticeable; which adds to the mustiness. No perceivable alcohol in the nose; definitely doesn't smell like 11.8% abv.  Somewhat surprising & weird is the manner in which the taste progresses. With each sip the flavors up front seem disarmingly mellow with modest notes of smooth oak, semi-sweet chocolate, cocoa powder & hints of roasted coffee. Mid-swallow the coffee becomes more apparent; vanilla & molasses, as well. The finish is where KBS increases intensity. Bourbon is manifest almost exclusively at this point. Sweetness tapers off & roasted dryness develops to a degree nearing ""burnt"" status. It didn't hit me until the third to last sip, but there is actually a bit of hop kick to be had. Alcohol heat is appreciable on the finish, too.  KBS is densely full-bodied & certainly chewy. Despite the ample head, carbonation is very low - smooth, creamy & slow; bordering on lackadaisical. I covered all aspects of the finish above, so no need to rehash them here. Suffice to say the feel is pretty solid.  Overall, I'm not unimpressed. The only thing that seems odd is how the flavor profile changes so dramatically from the start of each sip to the finish - it comes across as two beers in one. KBS is the mullet of beer: kempt & presentable in front; unruly & rowdy in back. It doesn't matter how well it can blend refined & extreme; at the end of the day KBS is still ""that guy.""",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Dubber55,4.5,"2010 vintage  Pours jet black with 1/2 finger mocha/tan/light brown head. Quickly dissipates and leaves a thin collar around. Leaves a bit of lacing on the glass.  Aroma consists mostly of freshly ground coffee. Upon further inspection, I get some bourbon, vanilla, oak, mocha, and fusel alcohol. Possibly some soy sauce as well  The initial flavor that hits my palate is fresh ground coffee. In the midpalate, I get some roasted malts, vanilla, chocolate, and bourbon. The finish is dry: chocolate, coffee, and some bourbon heat with a big roasted/char flavor. One of the things I like about this beer is that the bourbon barrel is kept in check. The bourbon definitely lets you know that it is there but, its not overpowering. The coffee is nicely integrated in this beer as well. I dont get that acrid aftertaste that many other coffee stouts have.  This is a chewy, viscous liquid. Its basically a meal in a glass. Low carbonation but entirely appropriate for a bourbon barrel stout.  Really drinkable stuff. All of the flavors are nicely integrated which makes for an enjoyable drinking experience. I could drink a couple of these in a night. Rightly deserving of its spot.  2011 vintage  Lots of bourbon, oak, vanilla, graham cracker, and chocolate with a little coffee.

1199,19960,udubdawg,4.94,"pours black in the glass. Thick, menacing, chewy? I prefer to think of it as satiny and sensual...let's get to it!  The aroma is like few other. Caramelized sugars are there, but are well behind chocolate, which is well behind coffee. Barrel notes show themselves in random, fleeting fashion. I smell alcohol too, more about that later. wow.  Whereas the aroma is largely coffee to me the flavor is overwhelmingly chocolate. It is a glorious thing. Tiny bits of things like coconut and woody oak, molasses, roast bitterness. It is sweet without being cloying, heavily cocoa-d without being one-dimensional, and generally rich and satisfying.  One of the very, very few that has lived up to the advance billing for me. So creamy soft, so smooth and slick on the tongue, enough carb to interest my palate but otherwise get out of the way. I sip it slowly but savor each taste. Spectacular beer, and borderline personal Top 10.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,axeman9182,4.83,"Served in a flute glass at Lord Hobo. KBS pours an absolute, all encompassing black. There's an impressive creamy milk chocolate cap, 2-3 fingers, that just refuses to go anywhere. Almost 10 minutes later I still have a solid 1.5-2 fingers of foam on top. There's a beyond ridiculous amount of gorgeous lacing left behind as I (all too quickly) empty my glass, especially for a beer of this size. The nose is great, a hearty mix of bourbon and coffee, heavier on the latter. I'm a little let down though because I don't find any vanilla or anything else in the nose, I was hoping for a little more complexity. That complexity I was looking for? Well, I found it even in my first few sips. There's an opening blast of coffee, supplemented by rick dark chocolate, before the beer transitions to a wonderful vanilla sweetness mid palate. The bourbon comes on strong (but not too strong) to close things out. KBS goes down absurdly smoothly, with a fine amount of carbonation. For a beer this big and flavorful, I found the body to be just a little bit thin (but this is a minor quibble in the grand scheme of things). While there's definitely a bourbon kick to this beer, there's no hint of any alcoholic heat, which for a barrel aged stout clocking in at over 11% ABV is absurd. I'm firmly convinced Founders sold their soul to the devil to be able to craft such an exquisite beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Riccymon,4.65,"This bottle courtesy of the generous RBlaszak. Pours from the bottle a deep, dark black with a quarter inch of dense brown head. The aroma off the glass isn't all that strong, but it's enough to give off a good whiff of oaky goodness. The wet, fresh-cut wood note comes through most clearly, followed by some vanilla and bourbon flavors.  The taste brings in added dimensions of high-quality chocolate and weak coffee. The bourbon characteristics come through even more than in the nose, and the oak flavor integrates very nicely with the rich, chocolate malt. Mouthfeel is definitely on the full side, and something in KBS leaves the mouth tingling after each sip.  As much as I didn't want this bottle to end, I couldn't help but drink it on the fast side for an 11% barrel-aged stout. This was one of the best beers I've had in months, and it definitely lived up to the hype!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,BBThunderbolt,4.05,"Thanks to BigBlueBeerGuy and GoGriz for sending me KBS in recent trades. Poured into 10oz glass. Poured pure black with just a very thin cap of deep tan head that no retention or lacing.  The first aromas were coffee and maple syrup. On second approach a bit of the roasted malt was present. On the tongue, the coffee dominated, with some bourbon showing up behind the maple notes.  The body was solid, as expected, but a bit too thin for this style. As I am not a coffee drinker, I found the coffee to be a bit more noticeable than I like, but not as strong as some other brews I've had.  Overall, a very good and solid brew that I enjoyed a lot. Did I enjoy it $6 a bottles worth? I'm not sure. With Old Rasputin and Old Stock Ale, both from North Coast, available for $9 a 4-pack, KBS wouldn't be a regular purchase for me, but I'd have a couple a year.

1199,19960,Phelps,4.54,"Picked up one of these bottles during Dark Lord Day 2010. It's now one month later...I've held off long enough.  With the first glance I realize that patience is overrated. KBS pours a thick, inky black with absolutely zero light penetration. A densely packed head akin to the color and consistency of brown sugar caps this beast, receding slowly and leaving entire walls of lacing in its wake.  The aroma is like walking down the coffee aisle at the supermarket. Notes of sweet vanilla, caramel and irish cream mingle with bitter dark roast coffee, rye, dark chocolate and macadamia nuts. The bourbon is just strong enough, perfectly balanced with the myriad of other carousing flavors. This may be the best nose I've ever experience on a stout. Incredible.  The taste is the nose incarnate. Heavy on the nuttiness and vanilla, with some extra notes of irish cream. A bourbon heat singes the throat on the way down, though notes of oak and cocoa nibs distract from the pain. Finishes sweet, with only a very slight bitterness. This is a man's beer. I feel like I should go chop some wood.  On the palate, this thing is silky smooth, with a medium body and some pretty high carbonation -- it just rolls over the tongue. My only protestation: the alcohol could be hidden just a bit more effectively.  I was only able to grab one of these during the extravaganza in Chicago, and it's killing me that I'll likely have to wait another year for more. I want this in my tummy at all times.

1199,19960,devilben02,4.54,"Pours pitch black with a modest espresso-brown, foamy head. The aroma explodes with a big coffee and chocolate presence, with lesser notes of sweet bourbon and a hint of vanilla. The flavor is much more bourbon-forward, with chocolate, an earthy hop character, and caramel coming out in the finish. The coffee is much less pronounced in the flavor than in the aroma, but maybe it just seems that way because it is overwhelmed by the dominant bourbon character. Regarding the texture, KBS is mouth-filling and creamy, but it is smooth enough that it doesn't come off as thick and chewy. It's easy-drinking, especially for 11% alcohol, but with the cacophony of complex flavors, palate fatigue becomes somewhat of an issue.

1199,19960,AleWatcher,4.46,"I poured this into a 16 oz snifter...  And in giving it a rather vigorous pour for the last 6 ozs or so, I manage to create a 2 finger head that settles to a murky and ominous cloud that hovers above a dark and stormy sea of Kentucky goodness. This thing is dark. I mean- driving down a country road with no headlights in a rain storm dark. I'm holding this up to the brightest light in my house, and I'm unable to see through it even at the edges. Upon swirling though, you do notice a deep mahogany/amber color that glints and shimmers with flashes of stunning beauty. The head is a light caramel color and seemingly composed of very tight and fine little bubbles. The lacing is spotty, but it seems to be the norm for these big bourbon barrel stouts.  The smell is huge on chocolate and coffee, with notes of vanilla and oak. The bourbon is hiding amongst them, but isn't really jumping out at me. All of those smells translate to the tongue and create an intensely flavorful experience that isn't for the weak of heart. The bitter coffee and unsweetened cocoa notes hit first with an underlying sweetness that I can only attribute to the malts working together with the added vanilla. As this has warmed up, the bourbon has really moved into a much more noticeable position in terms of the smell and taste. It is much more pronounced, and quite delicious. The oaky vanilla notes have gained some ground too. Upon my first few sips with this, all I could think was how well balanced this was... How strong must the other flavors have been to hide the bourbon and boozy bite? Why can't I taste the slightest hint of alcohol yet?  It seems that as the beer warms, the coffee and chocolate notes fade and the barrel aging kicks it into high gear. Wow. There's a nice alcohol bite hitting me now that is smooth and warming. I say this completely secure in my status as a heterosexual male that is nearing 30 years old-- This beer is utterly fabulous.  The mouthfeel is fantastic. The body isn't nearly as thick or full as you'd expect. It is actually light and creamy smooth. The carbonation level is about perfect for being a barrel aged brew. Certainly no complaints here. The beer does clock in at over 11%, so one of these is plenty. As a matter of fact, it has taken me 31 minutes to... (last sip)... finish this beer. Fantastic.

No malt comes through, just coffee, bourbon and alcohol heat. Very hot beer.  Medium body with average carbonation.  Overall not bad but not my favorite coffee or bourbon barrel beer. --- 2008 Bottle  Appearance is identical to the 2010 bottle. Short head with poor retention.  More bourbon and less coffee than the 2010 bottle. Much better balance of flavors and some dark caramel malt coming through.  Taste is similar to the smell with a lot more bourbon and a lot less coffee than the 2010. The bourbon comes through nicely and accents the slight coffee flavor.

1199,19960,CaptainIPA,4.34,"Pours an opaque jet-black color with no appreciable head. Thin rimming of bubbles form a tan foam that pools on the surface in paisley islands. Enticing aromas of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, malted milk, and bourbon. Smooth and silky mouthfeel. Light-bodied with understated, yet active carbonation. Taste mirrors the nose with precision. Opens with broad strokes of coffee, chocolate and malted milk before moving into earthy undertones of vanilla and bourbon. Alcohol is well buried for the extreme ABV. Finishes with a tang of black licorice. One complex, smooth and satisfying sipper.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,FishGetter,3.96,"Pours thick, midnight black apperance. Very slight head rims around top of glass. Spent coffee ground aroma with dull chocolate aroma. Faint tones of oak barrel. Sweet chocolate blends with dark coffee flavors. Some faint burbon comes on at the end with strong alchol that warms mouth. Drink finishes hot and boozie with Kalua like flavors Enjoyable mouthfeel, smooth and silkie medium body, close to heavy. This one may need some time to age to let the alchol mellow out and let the other charecters peak. Look forward to trying another bottle in a year or so. As is, decent offering.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,juhl31,4.67,-any way to come up with the descriptor...it's black. good brown head that stuck around well for what it is  -awesome! probably the best aspect. good bourbon mixed with coffee smell. the vanilla and roast come in there nice too  -what small aspects that lack in breakfast stout are definitely made up for in KBS. the same black coffee taste is there and mixed with the bourbon just makes it more rich and round  -excellent. not overly syrupy and a lot of warmth on the mouth and throat.  -fantastic beer. KBS surely brings it.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,traviserickson,4.7,"A: Motor oil with chocolate foam and a thick head with sugary lacing.  S: Bourbon with a heavy sour and thick alcohol and roasted chocolate overtones. Smells a bit more boozy that it tastes.  T: Well burnt chocolate with a mild roasted hop character. Toffee, very malt forward with a nutty malt, boozy taste.  M: Well rounded with perfect carbonation. Super thick without coating the mouth afterwords. Syrupy, but in a good way.  D: Amazingly good, I could get myself into some trouble with this beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,CaptinRedBeard,4.69,"09 Vintage  A: Poured into a Duvel tulip. Pours pretty much black no light gets through this one at all. Pretty much no head and no lacing.  S: Strong coffee aroma. A little bit of bourbon and vanilla as well.  T: The coffee comes through in the forefront followed by hints of vanilla and bourbon. The bourbon is subtle and not overpowering, which is a good thing in my opinion. A bit of roasted malt flavor comes through but it takes a back seat to all of the bigger flavors in this beer.  M: More carbonated than I expeced, but still a nice smooth mouthfeel.  D: This is my first time having KBS and this is great stuff. Going back to the regular Breakfast Stout after this is gonna be tough. Incredible beer. I will savor every one I that have.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,donkeyrunner,4.59,"The ladies like it!  Mud brown head shows off incandescent bubbles. Bubbly, circular retention with a little bubble island in the middle. Bubbles, bubbles everywhere. Opaque black.  Aroma is bourbon, glorious bourbon with a big, snarling stout underneath. Molasses, dark chocolate covered raisin, cocoa, oaky vanilla, an alcoholic nose tickle--lotsa depth.  Taste is sweet, burnt brown sugar, dark, bitter roast malt, raisinettes, and plenty of bourbon. Alcoholic heat well balanced by bold flavor.  I have previously used the term kitten puncher to describe big, dark, almost evil stouts. This beer is all that but so, so decadent. It's a sexy kittenpuncher.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,SAxDRC5,4.28,Had it on tap at the founders tap room. $6 for an 8 oz glass on a monday (cheap pint night)  A - pitch black with a thin head that leaves a nice lacing  S - smells a lot like bourbon a little like coffe and oak.  T - tastes like it smells. bourbon is the predominate flavor. a bit of oak and burnt maltiness. fairly sweet. I'm sure there is a lot more complexity but I'm just not good enough to list all the flavors.  M - Medium body. feels like silk. perfect carbonation for the style. the alcohol leaves a fairly noticeable feel.  D - alcohol is too strong to be very drinkable. but with the KBS I don't think drinkability is what founders is going for.  This beer had a lot of hype but I was not disappointed. When I'm not a poor college student I will have this again for sure.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,beerhan,4.76,It made me giggle.  This is one of the finest stouts on the planet. The local good beer bar had one keg of this and decided to have a founder's party and have nothing but founder's beers on tap. KBS was the prize of the night. It goes down very smooth with a very strong coffee overtone with a vanilla and bourbon after taste. The alcohol is hidden very well. It took me at least four glasses to even tell how strong this was. Overall fantastic. Best BBS stout to date.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,jzeilinger,4.77,"I was fortunate enough to pick up a few bottles of '09 this past weekend and was absolutely thrilled. This has been incredibly difficult to locate.  A - I never know what to say when it comes to stouts - it's an opaque pitch oil black. Has a nice one finger creamy toffee colored head which eventually subsides and leaves a thin lacing around the glass.  S - The aroma is dominated with bourbon and coffee grinds. Also picking up vanilla, oak, and a little bit of smokey roasted malts.  T - The palette is beaten with strong coffee and bourbon booziness. Other characteristics include bitter chocolate, woody oak, vanilla, smoky malt, and some ""bourbonized"" vanilla tang. After the sip, KBS leaves a coating in the mouth rich with bourbon, vanilla, and bittersweet chocolate that lingers for several minutes.  M - Medium Heavy body and complete silk on the tongue. The alcohol leaves a moderate amount of warming on the way down.  D - Exceptional but the strong booze base makes this perfect to be sipped slowly from a snifter glass.  Without a doubt, KBS has to be one of the finest stouts I've had to date. I understand there's alot of hype with this beer and sometimes I'm a little skeptical because of it. However, this is an exceptional beer and lives up to its reputation. I understand Founders added a few more tanks to the brewery so I hope this means KBS will at the very minimum be put in the brewing rotation twice a year instead of once. I'm packing two bottles away in the cellar to see how it progresses over time. This was a memorable tasting.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,SpdKilz,4.62,"New Beer Saturday! A HUGE thanks to erikkoppin for this amazing extra. Cheers!  2010 vintage.  Appearance - Completely pitch black in color. A 20 LED flashlight is held up to the glass and zero light penetrates, even around the edges. Pours into my Bell's tulip with less than a finger of dark mocha head that quickly dissipates and leaves little lacing. Overall, a very ominous looking brew!  Smell - Heavy coffee, coco chocolate (bittersweet), oak/wood, slight vanilla, and a hint of bourbon.  Taste - I know I shouldn't mention the mouthfeel till the appropriate section but damn. The taste is quite similar to the nose. Despite the bourbon being one of the last scents I smelled I taste this and the coffee heavily up front. This is followed by a heavy dark/bittersweet chocolate flavor which is completely infused with oaky/vanilla flavor. Extremely complex, extremely flavorful, extremely enjoyable.  Mouthfeel - As mentioned, holy cow. The first sip makes me think I'm drinking whole milk. Quite a creamy, thick viscosity we have going on here. Slight carbonation but any more and it would ruin this beer.  Drinkability - A massive sipper for sure. I am enjoying this with some Trader Joe mini chocolate peanut butter cups. They go amazing with this. I am extremely grateful to have this, being able to try the normal Founders Breakfast Stout earlier this year. Very enjoyable on this slightly chilly Southern California night. Thanks again to erikkoppin who is an amazing and generous trader.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,squaremile,3.21,"'10. Pours a nice dark brown/black with a quarter inch head, typical for Founders stuff. Nose is a lot of espresso, some minor notes of bourbon and vanilla. Taste is more of the same. Not sure how people describe this as a bourbon bomb, in fact it is quite the opposite. This is a coffee stout to me. It's all espresso on the tongue. Must say it's a bit disappointing. Mouthfeel is a tad fizzy. Definitely not a top 20 beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,gregmoscetti,3.75,"I really felt like I missed something the first time i tried KBS. I then tried it again. And then a 3rd time. I didn't miss anything, its just not at all what its cracked up to be.  YES its goood, but there are so many better beers out there. The flavors of this beer are like 3rd grade soccer. They are all just kinda running around, doing nothing of real importance. Finally, I dont think the gravity of the beer stands up to the flavor.  I will age the hell out of my last bottle and hope that it may change my opinion but as of right now there are a handful of coffee stouts/porters that I would say are better then KBS and even more of the barrel aged variety",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,brewerburgundy,4.03,"12oz bottle, goblet, bottled 2/18/10. I wanted to reserve this special beer for my 100th review. Circumstances have made it convenient to savor it early.  Well, here it is, black as night in the mountains with a serious little cappuccino brown head. Soon a frothy ring on top of a liquid that no light penetrates with spotty lacing. This is the darkest thing since Ten Fidy.  The nose is spicy with bourbon and rich with coffee. We're talking Kentucky coffee rather than Irish coffee. Loads of vanilla, cocoa powder, black coffee, oak, hop spice, and a bit of alcohol. A very deep dark chocolate note develops.  There is a massive amount of woody, oak flavor that enhances or comes across as spice, slightly peppery and singeing. The boozy bourbon no doubt is the originator of this spice, but the hops are generous in helping it along. Sweet vanilla, sweet oak, dark chocolate, bitter bourbon, black coffee in the finish.  Satiny and creamy in the mouth with minimal carbonation.  Anyway you cut it, I do not believe this to be a drinkable beer. Even though the alcohol is apparent in a pleasant way, it limits consumption. Boozy is a very appropriate word. The belly feels fire, one can get their whiskey fix, and enjoy a well crafted beer for likely no more than 12 ounces.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,klikger,4.2,"2 oz. from 2007 bottle poured into a tulip glass  A - Motor oil; not much head or lacing  S - Smoke, coffee, mildew? Sad, but true  T - Bourbon is definitely lingering despite the aging, as is some heat. I'm tasting more tobacco than coffee or chocolate here. This tastes very good (no mildew, thankfully), but not quite at the level of the 2008 or 2009 which I had last year.  M - Still has some heat; relatively thin for an imperial stout.  D - 2 oz. was decent, but I'd gladly have 4 or so more. An entire bottle would be overkill.  12 oz. bottle from 2010 poured into a DFH shaped pint glass  A - Significantly more head, partially due to the pour. Similar consistency as the 2007.  S - Alcohol heat & bourbon  T - All bourbon & heat for me...this needs some time. I prefer Founder's Breakfast Stout to this at the present.  M - Syrupy, albeit somewhat thin; warming  D - This is enjoyable in small quantities presently. I'm confident that it'll be much more drinkable in a year, but this still is a sipper and definitely not sessionable.  Overall, this is a top-notch stout. Right now, it's too boozy to enjoy all of the complexities of the bouquet and flavor, but I can't wait to crack them open in 3 to 6-month intervals over the next couple of years. I've had too many good KBS experiences over the past couple of years to mark this down in any one category, but aging will improve the current batch, without a doubt.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Beerenauslese,4.92,"Pours dark brown with a thin tan head, but still leaves ample lacing on the glass.  Strong, inviting aromas of malt and bourbon along with dark, pruny fruit.  The bourbon taste comes through strongly, but that is on a foundation of dark chocolate ice cream and dark, aged fruit that creates a wonderfully unique taste impression. Really tasting like a chocolate boozy dessert, like a bourbon chocolate ball. Finishes with a bitter hoppy dryness, along with a lingering bourbon note.  Body is moderately thick, with a little prickly carbonation.  This is an awesome, although quite boozy beer. Good for a nightcap, but more than that will cause trouble. It is an exemplar for a craft brewed stout. Every swallow is a delight.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A - Jet black body, so meets expectations there. Head was about a nice single finger of dark rust. S - Aromas were much tamer than expected, but pleasant. Vanilla, coffee and bourbon, but only a hint of actual booze. T - Here is where KBS gets its reputation. This is a perfect blend that is only slightly high on the vanilla for my taste. Otherwise... bourbon, coffee, roasted malts, chicory, oak, chocolate and the booze in the taste compliments such bold flavors. M - I was surprised that this was not actually thicker than it is. Don't get me wrong, this is thick enough to hold up, but the whole breakfast stout aspect gave me the impression that it would be meatier. But having said that, I was completely happy with the mouthfeel and level of carbonation. D - OK, I am sure this is where my rDev is going to dip, but I think that anybody who rates the drinkability of an 11+% beer in the 4+ range is out of their mind. This is a very strong beer and after just one, I was feeling every point of that ABV. It is also rich like cheesecake and I couldn't just sit around eating piece after piece of cheesecake.

There was a thin mocha head that disappeared fast, leaving a ring around the glass. No lacing  S: Notes of cocoa nibs, bourbon, vanilla, caramel, nut and malt fill the air. Very complex. Just the slightest hint of alcohol present in the finish [update: Alcohol is much more present after this warms up]  T: Just as wonderful as it smells. The alcohol is much more present however, leaving a nice warm feeling after swallowing. I'm fairly certain the heat is the only thing keeping this beer from being amazing. Has a nice roasted, bitter finish  M: One of the smoothest, creamiest beers I've ever had. Just the right amount of carbonation. Leaves a bitterness on the tongue after a few sips  D: This is truly one of the best stouts I've ever had. Definitely a slow sipper right now though.

1199,19960,Arbitrator,4.45,"2010 vintage in a trade from chcfan. Thanks, Chris!  A: Absolutely pitch black with a brownish coffee tint (may be my imagination). No light penetration when held to a lamp. Pours with half a finger of tan-colored head, which recedes into a collar with light filming on top of the brew. No lacing.  S: Coffee, caramelly bourbon, dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, and some booze sting.  T: Follows the nose perfectly. Coffee and bourbon are quite strong; I know this isn't barrel-aged FBS, but I swear that's the first thing that comes to mind. Vanilla and roasted malt, with the mid-taste seeing a rounded out coffee and dark chocolate bitterness. Oak hints throughout, but the finish is all alcohol and chocolate, with a pleasant warmth on the way down (an occasional burn, though). Very impressive.  M: Velvety and creamy from the full body and low carbonation. A little alcohol warmth at the end of a swig, but it's not fusel-y.  D: The recipe change threw me off a bit last year, but the 2010 vintage is amazing. I enjoy this more than Peruvian Morning (another bourbon coffee stout), and more than some other competitors in the style. Really top-notch stuff, and it amazes me that it's so plentiful and relatively cheap.

1199,19960,Kegatron,4.5,"On tap @ Founders (Grand Rapids, MI) on 4/22/10. 8 oz of the 2010 edition served in a snifter.  Pours black as midnight in the glass, with a thin covering of reddish & burnt looking mocha colored head. Swirling elicits a huge creamy flare-up that drenches the sides with thick swathes of lace and dark goo. I'm surprised by just how much of the Breakfast Stout is coming through upon first whiff. Roasted coffee and chocolate form a decadent smelling pillar in the nose, which the bourbon and vanilla notes rises up and wrap themselves around. Woody tannins and a touch of floral character lend this a certain degree of gentleness in the nose despite this being such a powerful bouquet.  The taste is very rich up front with crunchy coffee chocolate roast before bourbon and vanilla character just absolutely DRENCHES the back of the throat with warm sweetness. The bourbon does have some sharpness to it but never does quite get stinging (although it is close). It definitely does spread a boozy feel across the palate and in the chest. The tannic notes from the oak has a touch of raw and green feel to it, with the bourbon and wood leaving a lot of deep dryness in it's wake. The mouthfeel is full bodied and rich, with a big creamy feel that fills the mouth up with flavor. I'm getting some of that 11% ABV but most of the alcohol appears to come from the bourbon and stays out of the body for the most part, helping keep this a very steady sipper.  It's hard for me to say if I like this beer fresher, with the coffee and vanilla popping, or if I like it more with some age and all of that bourbon and wood showing itself a little stronger. Makes me wish that I had tried a glass of the 2009 next to it.

Smells of robust roasted malts, coffee, and bourbon with hints of vanilla. The coffee is more intense than it was fresh and the bourbon is more restrained.  Tastes similar to how it smells. Roasted malt and dark chocolate flavors kick things off. Smooth coffee flavors join in shortly thereafter. Midway through the sip vanilla and bourbon flavors make an appearance, the former more intense than the aroma intimates. Mildly sweet oat flavors kick in right before a solidly bitter ending.  Mouthfeel is great. It's got a very smooth thickness with grainy carbonation.  Drinkability is very good. I finished my glass quickly and could easily have another.  Overall I thought this was still a phenomenal beer after a few years on it but I was a bigger fan when it was fresh. The bourbon flavors are much bigger although it is boozier when fresh.

1199,19960,phishisphunk,4.64,"2010 Vintage, poured into a snifter. Enjoyed at cellar temperature.  A: Brownish black in color, not too terribly dark. Slight tan head evolves with a vigorous pour and recedes to the outer rim of the glass. Looks thin, leaves very scant residual lacing on the glass.  S: I love the smell of fresh KBS. Predominantly coffee and bourbon with light vanilla and oakiness. The bottle I am currently enjoying also has a mild to moderate aroma of alcohol, a first for me while enjoying KBS. One of the best smelling beers I have ever had the pleasure to sniff.  T: This batch is a little hot. I have had this aged a year, which was incredibly smooth with diminished coffee, but this has some pungent alcohol. But overall, very enjoyable. The taste follows the nose very well. Creamy, smooth, coffee, vanilla, bourbon. But not overly done with the bourbon. Compliments the base beer very well. Some mild earthiness is still hanging around as well as mild residual chocolate from the original breakfast stout.  M: Very creamy with little carbonation as one might expect from a beer of this sort that has already been aged for some time.  D: As I said earlier, this batch is a little hot (maybe a funny bottle, I had it around Easter and remember it being pretty well balanced as always). But overall pretty mellow for a beer at 11%. If this was more accessible and readily available throughout the year, I would drink it all the time. Have no problem consuming a whole bottle.

Amazingly this flavor is balanced enough that there isn't a lot of ""heat"" to the flavor and all the different flavors seem to compliment each other.

S-Mostly vanilla, chocolately, oaky and bourbony. But all the smells seem to compliment each other instead of overpower each other.  T-Vanilla and chocolate then the oak and bourbon barrel come through. The alcohol comes out a little in the end but nowhere near the 11%. Very oaky aftertaste. The wood stays in your mouth after the beer is gone.  M-Surprisingly light for such an amazing beer. I'd say medium body and very lightly carbonated.  D-The aroma draws you in, the taste makes you stay.  I was honestly surprised at how light the mouthfeel was for such a big beer. Very easy drinking for a bourbon barrel ages 11% stout.

Coffee is the first note that hits the nose followed by milk chocolate, light maple syrup, bourbon, and a bit of oak. I almost don't want to drink it because it smells so good. Almost. The bourbon is not shy in this. Comes out right away in the taste, but smooths out into oak-hinted toffee, creamy chocolate, and roasted coffee which lingers and bitters a bit with a mild whiskey burn at the end.

1199,19960,bobsy,4.94,"Bottle tasted side by side with Founders Breakfast Stout.  Pours pitch black with a finger of khaki head that quickly drops to a wispy film, leaving only a few lone streaks of lace on the glass. The typical appearance you expect for a barrel-aged stout. Sweet bourbon aroma brings wood, brown sugar, vanilla and spice, while the base beer has some delightful dark chocolate and coffee notes. Its certainly the kind of beer that telegraphs its quality by its scent.  Sumptuous, rich and luxurious flavour elevates this into the top echelon of imperial stouts. The balance between the base beer and the barrel character is perfectly recognised, and a harmonious marriage is created. Sweet and smooth on the tongue, with great chocolate, vanilla, and brown sugar notes. Creamy coffee, irish cream, a touch of wood - its all there. Wonderfully integrated bourbon and a prime dessert beer. Full mouthfeel, with a smooth, slightly chewy viscousness, and a soft carbonation that works just perfectly. Slightly warming alcohol, but very well-hidden considering its weight. Certainly not noticeable enough to stop me drinking this in record time!  I really liked this, and think it may be one of the best examples of barrel-aging I've come across. The bourbon adds just the right notes to this beer, and transforms it into something sublime, and truly worthy of its accolades.

Huge does of bitter chocolate followed by a marshmallow like sweetness with a touch of coffee and rich brown sugar  M:This went from creamy and sticky to dry and bitter.

M- thick, and very silky. doesn't overly coat your mouth and really has an exceptionally decadent mouthfeel. the feel is aided by a subtle carbonation level.  d- it's a very rich beer even for a RIS. rich and delicious though.

1199,19960,Schmaltzy,4.55,"Had a taster while I was in line at the Veritas release.  A- Black with brown head nice lacing left around the edges.  S- Coffee, heavy milk chocolate, roasted malt, nice vanilla bourbon oak smell, just a nice bourbon smell not strong or overpowering.  T- Similar to the smell, loads of milk chocolate and vanilla, roasted malt and coffee later with a nice vanilla bourbon oak finish. Smooth.  M- Full bodied Stout that is very creamy, almost chocolate milk creamy, with light carbonation and light bourbon notes that balance the beer nicely.  D- Easy drinking if you like chocolate milk, loads of flavors, creamy, smooth, dry finish. Never noticed 11.2% alcohol.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,hoppymcgee,4.65,"Poured from an '09 vintage bottle into a NYC Craft Beer Week glass.  A: Dark as night, pours with little to no head. Has a sticky, syrupy aspect to it.  S: Authentic coffee and chocolate aromas. A rather spectacular nutty smell too. Some signs of oak, but no signs of bourbon. Note that as the beer warms up a lot more vanilla and toffee characters come through.  T: So rich and delectable. The most ideal, perfect, dessert beer. I mainly get that perfect mix of chocolate and coffee and a hint of the bourbon. Some oakiness follows. Not sweet or acrid, just right on point - this beer really opens up when it warms up.  M: The carbonation is surprisingly okay. Not chewy, not oily or slick, just right for the style and ABV.  D: All I can is, ""Another one please?""  Overall, a decadent beer that is unmatched. Cheers Founders!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,emmasdad,4.25,"2010 vintage. Poured a deep, dark, opaque black, impervious to the light. A surprisingly decent amount of chocolately brown head formed initially, but receded to the edges fairly quickly. A big nose on this one, with loads of freshly brewed coffee, along with bourbon and dark chocolate. The bourbon presence is dominant on the palate as well, along with vanilla, oak, roasted malt and chocolate covered espresso beans. The alcohol is very well hidden in this one, making it dangerously drinkable. After being unimpressed with this one last year, I am extremely glad I got a couple more this year. A truly outstanding beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Recedes quickly but small creamy ring remains as I allow it to warm in the glass.  S: The smell is incredible! Chocolate, coffee, and bourbon come through big time. The aroma of this beer is at least half the enjoyment, maybe more. I swirl it in the snifter as it warms and enjoy the unbelievable aroma.  T: Intense dark chocolate along with the coffee and bourbon flavors give this beer a truly unique taste. You can tell the high alcohol is there; but does not take from the flavor of this sipper.  M: Thick mouth feel with slight carbonation. Alcohol is warming and wonderful.  D: This is an awesome stout and one that I will be able to enjoy again and again. I will age a few and will love to taste again after a year or so.

1199,19960,Kamahl75,4.15,"Tried this at a local bar in a small bottle poured into a goblet in March 2010.  I did like this beer a lot. The smell was a signal of the taste with a strong coffee, vanilla, chocolate and sweetness like from molasses. Had not enjoyed a bourbon barrel breakfast stout before, became a fan. A little bit of alcohol in the mouth and not quite as smooth as the tap version of course. Overall a beer I would definitely drink again as an after dinner drink.

1199,19960,sweemzander,4.9,"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. Bottled on 02/15/10.  (A)- Pours thick & as dark as the blackest night. Produced a frothy & large 3+ finger almost dark brown head with some good retention behind it. The head actually became a tan color as it finally settled to a light layer of froth on the surface. Left some legs of foam on the sides of the glass.  (S)- Dense aromas of coffee grounds, brown sugar, vanilla, molasses, dark chocolate, and light bits of wood. Rich & decadent. I could really smell this all day; a combination of all my most favorite smells rolled into one.  (T)- Exactly like the smell. Wonderful combo of coffee & chocolate with vanilla & brown sugar. Sweet, but not overly so. Finishes up dry & slightly bitter. Let this warm up to cellar temp.  (M)- Great carbonation level & balance. Sweet, yet dry & bitter to smooth it all out. Very impressed with how smooth this years is; great alcohol integration. There is a warmth to it going down, but in no way harsh or overpowering whatsoever. I am really surprised how smooth it is this fresh already!  (D)- Everytime I have had this beer, it continually surprises me and amazes me at the same time. An amazing example of the style that never disappoints. Founders just knows how to do their stouts; KBS/CBS/BS are overall just fantastic & perhaps my most favorite lineup of beers. This years release will not disappoint if you havent had it yet & are wondering the quality of the batch. In fact, it may just be better than last years. Simply a delight to drink & enjoy, I didnt want it to end.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,WeedKing4,4.27,"Bottle pours a dark dark black with a decent amount of caramal foam forming in the Duvel tulip glass. Smells of dark chocolate and roasted coffee. This taste follows suit with some bourbon and oak lingering in there too. Its very smooth overall and a very solid stout. Its easy to drink for the 11.2%, but it does catch up to you after a couple. Still prefer the Canadian Breakfast Stout over this, but its still pretty good.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,jhoban19,4.65,"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter.  A: KBS pours black as night with a finger's worth of rich brown foam. The head settles quickly into a thick ring around the outside of the glass. Random spots of lacing move around with each sip and follow the beer down the glass.  S: Immediately out of the fridge initial aromas of coffee grounds, dark roasted malt and milk chocolate. I'm not getting any bourbon just yet, but we'll see what happens as this baby warms and opens up. Could be that this bottle has been aging in my cellar for close to a year and has mellowed. Now that I've let it warm, some bourbon does come through, but never too much, and certainly not as much as I was expecting.  T: the flavor of KBS follows the aromas lock, stock and barrel- dark roast coffee and milk chocolate. I have to be careful because I could put down the entire glass- I'd like to let it warm a little to see how it transforms. As it warms hints of bourbon start to appear and become more prevalent the closer it gets to room temperature. That said, it never overpowers.  M: Thick, rich, smooth and creamy. While still fridge temp, KBS reminds me of a glass of good chocolate milk made with more chocolate than milk. As it warms, like the flavors, the warming feel of bourbon presents a nice balance to the creamy smoothness.  D: Kentucky Breakfast Stout is way to drinkable for an 11.2% brew. Dangerous as it may be, it's well worth the risk. I prefer the Canadian Breakfast Stout over KBS, but not by much. This is an excellent brew from start to finish.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,tegelaar,4.89,Pours a jet black with no head. Nice lacing with cocoa colored rings forming as you drink. Smell is very sweet with strong coffee and chocalate smells. This thing tastes insane! Totally blows you away with intense chocolate and to a lesser extent coffee. The Bourbon adds the perfect burn and sweetness to this beer. It's so smooth and effortless to drink. This is a top rated beer for a damn good reason! What an experience.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Banger530,4.95,"It was good to have this again. I used to live within walking distance of Founders before moving to Phoenix, and I miss it.  2010 Bottle  Poured a deep, dark, black with about a finger mahogany head.  Smelled of bourbon, roasted coffee, and chocolate. Very nice. I could have just smelled and been happy.  Taste like burnt coffee, chocolate, and of course bourbon. Well balanced throughout and left a boozy aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is full. Full-bodied beer. Lightly carbonated, enough to compliment the taste.  Very drinkable. One of my favorites.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Destral,4.59,"Appearance: This a very dark and thick beer. Pour produced a very thin, tan head. I expected a bit more, but it did leave some pretty decent lacing oddly enough.  Smell: I love the bourbon and alcohol smell on this. Bits of chocolate, vanilla, and coffee round out a wonderful smell.  Taste: Very, very rich. Smooth bourbon and chocolate sweetness hits up front. Getting some caramel maybe, more of the vanilla showing up next. Finishes with just the right amount of roasted malt and coffee bitterness. Quite tasty.  Mouthfeel: This is a really full bodied, thick beer, but incredibly smooth even while pretty fresh. I wish I had more of this to age. One minor drawback is this one really left my mouth dry/thirsty.  Drinkability: With the high abv and full body, you'd think this would be a sipper...but this beer went much to quickly for me. Overall the alcohol is hidden pretty well. Lots of complex flavors are really well balanced. This is a real winner.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

However I do notice it's actually a very dark brown with some light penetrating the top. Leaves a tan thin head.  S- Is roasted chocolate, dark malts, and faint bourbon and oak. The bourbon comes out more as it warms.I notice toffee, and the alcohol certainly comes out as it warms.  T- Taste is definitely an enjoyable ride with flavors playing off one another. Thick toffee sweetness followed by bitter hops and bitter chocolate. The bourbon presence follows with a somewhat chalky aftertaste that is different but not a negative.  M- Mouthfeel is warm, creamy and superb. It's a powerful brew but still drinkable.  D-Overall this is a world class stout. It's definitely deservng of its accolades and it's complex and enjoyable.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,zoolzoo,4.02,"2010 Bottle  Fresh KBS smells like a bourbon barrel filled with fresh coffee, and it tastes kind of Similiar. The taste smacks you with bourbon but melds into sugary chocolate, oak, vanilla, and notably bitter CHARRED COFFEE. The bitterness was slightly off putting. Complex, but rough around the edges. A little hot, but not as abrasive as some barrel aged brews.  Its tough to rate drinkability for KBS. If I were to score it for ""what it is"", it would be high. Otherwise, its slightly below average.  Ive never had anything but fresh KBS. Each time I have this I wonder how older vintages are drinking - probably alot smoother.

One finger dark tan head that dissipated rather quickly.  Smell: Huge coffee, bourbon, oak, vanilla, toasted brown sugar make up this amazingly smelling stout. Very smooth and well rounded smelling.  Taste: This is a 2010 release. The oaky bourbony taste leave the mouth a bit dry, but the taste that lingers on the tongue is great. Generous amounts of bittersweet chocolate, malt and brown sugar make up the majority of what I'm tasting.  Mouthfeel: Slightly bitter with a nice soft carbonation. I suspect it will be extremely smooth in a year. I plan on reviewing it again to see if things have developed any further.  Drinkability: Its a sipper for sure, but is surprisingly drinkable given the high ABV. The alcohol is well disguised in my opinion and isn't super boozy like the Goose Island BCS. I like this beer more than the BCS. I will age a few bottles and see how they taste later.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,SirSketch,4.5,"2009 vintage A - This beer has an awesome dark brown, espresso-like head, and the beer itself is even darker than espresso.  S - Ohh, the aroma is simply amazing! Everything you would want in an aged imperial stout. Dark melted chocolate, roasted qualities, black coffee and a big influence from the barrel. Perfect amount of bourbon character as well as it's not overwhelming at all. Time for a taste!  T - Burnt coffee flavors prevail, but the bourbon is undoubtedly there. The warmness of KBS as you swallow is a reminder of the bourbon barrel. Really a great beer!  M/D - Very balanced in terms of mouthfeel. It doesn't leave the mouth overly dry and doesn't linger as long as other beers of the same style. I wish I had a few more to cellar as I'm sure this would age nicely  2010 vintage A - Creamy tan head that sticks in small clumps to the side of my glass. No light escapes this dark beer, even when held up to light.  S - Has all of the smooth, rounded, complex aroma of bourbon without the harsh alcoholic aroma. Very dark chocolate notes. A bit of vanilla and perhaps a slight burnt grain aroma.  T - The very rich, dark chocolate flavor melds well with the sweet bourbon. Actually noticeably bitter. Ends nicely as the flavors last for awhile, giving you time to think between sips.  M/D - Slick, oily mouthfeel that covers the entire mouth and never fully washes away.

On that note, putting this in perspective with it's peers, this is pretty solid. Big dark pour, bourbon smell carries throughout, finish was big booze, with booze on top.

1199,19960,BeerFMAndy,4.5,"8 oz tap pour into an American tumbler pint and shared with Sweemzander at Founder's Black Party 2010.  A - Totally black, no light gets through this one, with a cascading dollop of tan, dense whipped-cream-like head. Fantastic retention to the small pile and dense lace left on the glass.  S - The typical huge bourbon nose of KBS is smoothed out a lot from the nitro. A big backing of large black roasted malts with a vanilla flavor and light roasted coffee. So smooth in the nose!  T - The majorly bourbon barrel flavor hasn't really changed or smoothed from the nitro like the aroma did. The flavor is almost identical to the bottled version of KBS. Vanilla, coffee, molasses notes, and lots and lots of bourbon.  M - Smooth as silk with a soft texture and milky finish but the bourbon alcohol booziness sensation in the stomach remains the same. Roasted bitterness to the finish and fuuull bodied.  D - Like a normal KBS the bourbon is rather large but still fairly drinkable due to the nitro introduction. I'm really happy that I'm sharing this one. 6 oz poured into a snifter would plenty to nurse though a cool evening.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Chronofied,4.52,"About 50°F, served in a tulip glass.  Appearance - A very dark, opaque brownish-black. Coffee colored head about a quarter inch high. Leaves some light lace behind.  Smell - Strong aroma of roasted malt and coffee right away. A definite tang of bourbon. Something of brown sugar and/or molasses. Quite intense.  Taste - Coffee and malt, but with much more complexity than the smell might indicate. The malt has a nice roasted quality to it, and the coffee is powerful but not overpowering. Brown sugar in the taste, and a hint of vanilla. It is likely that some of the smells are occluded by the coffee smell, but the composition really comes out in the taste. As the beer opens up, the bourbon becomes more noticeable. The way in which it blends with the dominant flavors of coffee and roatsted malt is exceptional. The high ABV is not very noticeable at all, and the brew does not burn going down. Rather extended (but pleasant) aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - A body somewhere between medium and full, it is a lightly creamy offerring that is handsomely carbonated for the Breakfast Stout style.  Drinkability - An excellent brew, and quite drinkable considering the 11.2% hidden within. That being said, one is probably sufficient.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smell is of great strength. Cocoa, coffee and barrel whiskey rules in balance. No more overaggressive alcohol, oak and bourbon. This beer needs age! MF is thick, warm, and low carbonation, very good.

Initial smell is fantastic. Dark roasted chocolate, coffee, and bourbon. The odor is incredibly rich and highly enjoyable. Large whafts are like breathing liquid chocolate. Taste is no let down from what my nose revealed. Liquid chocolate, bourbon silk. Slight sweetness that is the perfect complementary touch. Slight notes of smooth coffee and only a pleasnat lingering aftertaste. An eighty ounce glass would be just fine. This highly acclaimed beer booze is too good. An infinite supply of this brew would be great beer wish. Mouthfeel is a perfect medium dense, tight bubble, low to moderate carbonation.

1199,19960,garymuchow,4.17,"Pricey, but considering it's currently #9, I feel compelled to give it a go. Poured into a Same Adams glass. Doesn't pour too thickly, but it is black as a cloudy night. Takes a moment for head to appear, but it's ultimately quite small and thing, thickest on edges, and still leaves some dark lacing. Really coffee and roast in aroma. Much more than I anticipated and minimal bourbon (just hints actually). Actually heavier than regular FBS, surprisingly. Has a fresh and alive quality about it. Initially, the roast and coffee flavor reign, but as the beer breaths the bourbon begins to appear, first quite subtly, but then in an ever growing pattern, unfortunately it eventually gets to dominate, which ruins it for me. When the bourbon becomes too strong the beer loses the wonderful coffee roast very extended aftertaste that made the opening drinks so pleasurable. Now they are only a memory&lt;sigh&gt;. Alcohol is hidden quite well. Minimal burning or heat. Moderately high body and carbonated nicely for style. Smooth. Drinks dangerously easily.

On tap and in bottle, the mouthfeel seems to have thinned. The aroma is still great, but not as powerful as before and the taste just doesn't seem to be there. Overall, it seems like a much less hearty beer than before. With all of that aside this is still a great beer but I cannot judge it as a A+ (world class) beer anymore.

1199,19960,MrDanno96,4.54,"Courtesy of gratefulbeerhead. Thank you sir!  2010 Vintage  A: Pours coffee black with a thin tan head that dissipates pretty quickly. Some spotty lacing on the sides of the glass.  S: Great nose on this one. Notes of sweet chocolate and buttery bourbon really shine in this one. Coffee, vanilla, and just a little oak also come through. An amazing blend of aromas leads to great complexity on the nose.  T: Dark roast coffee and dark chocolate come through at the onset of each sip. This transitions to a strong vanilla and bourbon finish, sitting atop distinct hints of earthy oak. The strong bourbon and alcohol in the finish is just a touch overwhelming, but overall the flavor has really nice balance and complexity. A flavor of dark coffee lingers for a long time after each sip.  M: Very full bodied, thick and chewy. The strong sting of alcohol in the finish brings this score down a bit.  D: A beautiful beer by any measure. It's a little hot right now, but still very good. It can only get better with age. Cheers to Founders for a great BA Stout.  I enjoyed this more than the KBS I had on tap at EBF 2010.

Lots of boozy alcohol finish to it.  D: I seek this beer out every year when it comes out, mainly based on it's reputation and scarcity in the market. It's very different and very good, but also very pricey, and I think just a bit overrated -- the bourbon and coffee flavors mixed together just don't do it for me -- I'd much prefer a Goose Island Bourbon stout.

The strong whiskey flavor rides on top of the malt and coffee flavors. The alcohol flavor lingers for a bit, but still allows the others flavors to come through. The bourbon flavor adds woody, smokey, and fresh vanilla notes. Surprisingly a lot going on here other than straight bourbon.  M/D: Thick and chewy with lower carbonation.

There are some hints of chocolate, caramel, toasted marshmallows, and vanilla, but the bourbon is the main think I pick up.  The first thing I taste is a pleasant, mellow bourbon flavor. Oak, smoke, vanilla, leather. This would be excellent with a cigar.  Medium body, full flavor, light carbonation, not too dry, warming. Very pleasant bourbon aftertaste.  Highly sip-able. Very smooth and pleasant. Everything works well together.  I love bourbon and I love beer, this is Heaven!  Edit: 12.23.10...This beer was better fresh; it does not age well...IMO  Edit: 3.16.11...This beer is definitely better fresh. I just did a vertical with this years, and last years.

1199,19960,mmva321,4.58,"Poured into a snifter.  With stouts anymore, I'm not really looking for innovation as much as I just want the beer to have the best quality of the traditional ingredients. This beer does that better than any other. It trumps Founder's Breakfast Stout by making a traditional stout with the best tasting flavors.  A: Pours an extremely dark brown. Opaque body that has just the slightest red tint. About a finger of dark tan head that dissipates quickly and leaves remnants at the top.  S: Very well balanced. Roasted coffee and nuts mix well with the smoother vanilla and chocolate smells. I wish they had leaned a bit closer to the roasted side of things, as the emphasis on the vanilla makes the smell a little faint.  T: This is perhaps the first beer I've had where I actually enjoyed the presence of a strong alcohol taste (or this and BBQ). It has a strong alcohol flavor, but it mixes perfectly with the hearty roasted flavors of coffee. It's complimented well by the added vanilla which smooths it all out. The oak barrell adds character to the alcohol flavor and gives this beer a real burbon flavor.  M: A good thick body with just a little bit of carbonation. It's very substantial, but it doesn't get in the way.  D: Highly drinkable just because it tastes so damn good and is so enjoyable. I used to dream that the best tasting stout would be like sweet liquid chocolate, but I was wrong. Founders upped the alcohol taste, but instead of masking it, they used it to their advantage and balanced it perfectly with the best ingredients.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Nice amount of sticking to the glass.  S- The wood and vanilla hit the nostrils first followed quickly by the roasted malts and dark chocolate that one finds in the regular breakfast stout. Finishes with a slight amount of alcohol and bourbon.  T- Large drags of dark bitter chocolate along with high ends of coffee. Throughout the entire drink, the chocolate and coffee is laced with tastes of wood and vanilla that complement the roasted malts. Finishes with a lingering bourbon taste with a medium alcohol presence that really allows you to walk away with a refreshed palate.  M- Chewy and full, thick presence in the mouth is wonderful for a cool day.  D- Hardest part is letting this one sit around and warm up to develop its full character.  Notes- Must allow this beer to warm up if you want to get the full taste of the beer.

Slight bourbon as well.  T: The bourbon definitely shines through...oaky, roasted malts, mocha, and then some more whiskey on the back end.

The only reason I knew it was brown was the tell tale head which was a dark tan on top. This is a dark beer. Head didn't stick around. I blame a poor pour.  Smell is straight coffee. I appreciate this as dunkin's ice coffee was not up to snuff today. There is a little sweetness/ vanilla scent as well.  First taste is coffee. You could swap this in with my breakfast cereal any day... Chocolate immediately follows. Then the sweetness, vanilla. I am guessing that the vanilla is the bourbon coming through. As I drink more I am picking up more bourbon undertones.  This is a pretty dope beer. Might be a little happy after a 4 pack of these pupies.  A definite try is you see this one around.

Solid brown sugar and marshmallow undertones are synced with the deep coffee and chocolate maltiness.  Taste: Tastes a bit hot as its a 2010 release. Big bourbon bite leaves the mouth dry. Huge does of bitter chocolate followed by a marshmallow like sweetness with a touch of coffee and rich brown sugar.  Mouthfeel: Slightly astrigent, overly bitter.

M: heavy and full body, that has a silky smoothness before revealing the tingly bitterness and warming alcohol. almost like drinking straight liquor.  Overall, this one is a drinker's drink.

I picked up a lot more chocolate in the taste than I got from the scent, but that is most certainly not a bad thing. Finishes with a nice bite from the alcohol, but at 11.2 abv, I'd say that's to be expected.  M - Very solid. A little more carbonation than I had expected from such a dark, alcoholic beer.

The head is pretty thin but leaves some sticky lacing as it goes down.  S: Coffee notes dominate as well as dark chocolate notes. Hints of vanilla as I take it in as the bourbon has mellowed out a bit. Woody and oaky. Very sweet in the nose.  M: Rich and creamy with some soft carbonation. A little bit of heat in the throat. Just about perfect for the style and ABV. Finishes fairly clean with a bit of a dry afterbite. Awesome.  T: Coffee and dark chocolate up front, followed by vanilla and oaky notes. Just as I expected. The flavors are nicely balanced. Not the most complex tasting beer but extremely well done. Some alcohol comes through but is pretty well hidden given the ABV.  O: An excellent offering from Founders. It has some obvious differences over their standard breakfast stout. It's a nice change of pace but I'm glad to have the traditional breakfast stout around all year with this to bring a nice surprise once a year. I actually prefer the Canadian Breakfast Stout which I was lucky enough to try last year. The drinkability is low but honestly, who wants to drink this all night?

Along with a bit of bourbon which went along nicely with the slight oak/wood smell. This lets it origins be known.  T:There were some slight similarities to FBS. This had plenty of heavy hitting characteristics going on at once. Sweet chocolate, delicious coffee, vanilla and molasses like sweetness, and definite straight oak flavor on the tail end. Not alot if any hop pressence  M:This went from creamy and sticky to dry and bitter. They both worked complimented eachother nicely and kept anything from being too overwhelming.  D:This was a very drinkable, enjoyable brew. A great unique treat. Nothing is needed to accompany this due to the various heavy flavor and feel throughout.

T: All the above mentioned aromas blend very nicely in the taste with a nice finish of bourbon and booze. The bourbon is perfect, the booze is a little too much. Everything blends together very nicely. If the booziness was a little less I would have given it a 5.  M: Thick-bodied! Very full mouthfeel on this one. This is how a big stout should be.  D: As mentioned above, the booziness detracts a little from the drinkability of this, along with the 11.2% abv  I first sampled this last year when I first picked it up and it was much 'hotter'.

Dark black with a hint of brown. Pours a one finger mocha head. Quickly resides to a soapy ring of foam around the edge of the glass. Oily, spotty lacing down the walls of the glass. Exceptional looking, especially when considering the abv and barrel aging.  Smells of mocha, coffee, vanilla, and molasses. Also, a light bourbon and light oak presence. Strong, complex nose. Smells great.  Taste comes full force with mocha, dark chocolate, vanilla bean, bitter coffee, toffee, molasses, and oak. Some boozy bourbon at the end accompanied with a bitter smokiness and a slightly acidic coffee twang right at the end. The bourbon flavor is lighter than expected. The bitter coffee/dark chocolate flavor is pretty strong, but balanced with all the sweet flavors (vanilla, molasses, toffee). Very flavorful, complex and delicious.  Full bodied, viscous and chewy. Low end of medium carbonation that serves to break up the thickness. Smooth and creamy. Slightly hot as well. Mouthfeel met my greatest expectations for this beer.  This beer is balanced enough, and the alcohol is hidden well enough to be considered to have good drinkability. Also, the flavor is complex and delicious which continues to invite you back for more.

Or...just too much going on? I'll go with the latter. I get the bourbon, I get the coffee, I get the great malt, and I get a good bitterness. These this didn't seem to marry very well here for me. Mouthfeel is almost perfect, carb. levels are spot on and this one isn't too thick (like many impy stouts).

Not too surprised by the lack of visual appeal considery the high ABV.  Smell- A lot of vanilla and bourbon scents. There might be some coffee aroma in there someplace but I could not pick it out. Alcohol stands out as well.  Taste- Vanilla! This is the flavor that dominates throughout the flavor. As I worked my way through the 12 oz., the taste score continued to drop as I grew tired of the vanilla flavor. The bourbon adds some flavor dynamic before the alcohol dominates in the finish. Thankfully the brewer hopped the hell out of this beer to cut down on the sweetness. I was waffelling between average and good and went with the higher score as I did enjoy this more than the FBS.  Mouthfeel- Thick and rich like a good Imperial Stout should be. Great carbonation and texture. I do not know how this could be surpassed.  Drinkability- Not that drinkable.

Some vanilla pokes out and a modest bourbon flavor add delicious complexity and a nice bit of sweetness to balance out the beer...

Smell is the best of it- a hefty black coffee feel just the way my 5.30am breakfast smells like before leaving for the hospital. not necessarily the fondest of moments but still it's an admirable replica for a beer and it feels like my well beloved coffee all over.  Taste is nice, although generally overwhelming. strong sweetness from right off, obviously based on the alcohol content with a roasty malt background. too strong still, and the hops serve nearly nothing at all when rounding it up. but maybe a breakfast donut feel? plus the body's fluffly and full so to go along with this.  Still- and much like breakfast- this is, by all means, and at the most, a one-a-day sort of thing.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,SykDoc,4.7,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter. It pours a like a very dark brown (basically black) motor oil. A brown head forms to 1/4 inch and reduces to a partly cloudy lacing over the top.  The aroma is great with a nice up front punch of roasted coffee and dark chocolate followed by a smoother bourbon.  The taste is phenomenal. Great mixture of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, caramel sweetness with an added boost of oaky vanilla and bourbon, which combine amazingly well in this beer.  The mouthfeel is full bodied with a solid level of carbonation that minimally balances with the flavor. It has a pleasant texture and leaves a great coffee/dark chocolate bitterness and dryness at the finish.  This is a fantastic beer. I rated the original very high and have refined my palate. This is right there with some of the best. The only reasons I don't rate drinkability higher is because of the high ABV and strength of taste that does a number on your palate and cognition. Yum!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Gmann,4.62,"Pour a slick black color, brown around the edges, with a tight any creamy brown head that left some sticky lacing. The aroma is that of Kaluha, nice chocolate scent with hints of coffee and booze. I would swear that this was Kaluha if blind folded. Not much bourbon pick up. The taste is of Kaluha with more of a coffee bite and vanilla presence. The bourbon is subtle but noticable and goes extremly well with the chocolatey flavors. Some light fruit tartness in the back end as well as another blast of roasted coffee. Full bodied and slick but does have active carbonation that breaks up the heavy flavors. Some stickiness in the end. Very smooth and the ABV is nowhere to be found. This is a crazy drinkable beer, great flavors but none in excess all working well together. Glad I bought an extra 4 pack.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Soneast,4.67,"Vintage 2010. Served at cellar temp ~55°. Poured into a plain snifter. Color is pitch black....maybe some hints of brown in the right light. With a fairly vigorous pour, KBS only develops about a 1/4"", brown colored head, that receded pretty rapidly to a sudsy ring, leaving a modest amount of lace on the glass.  The aroma starts out with some pretty nice coffee and dark chocolate aromas, giving in quickly to a well-balanced bourbon character. Roasty and burnt caramels, with some sweet molasses notes.  The flavor follows suit. The coffee/dark chocolate characters take front seat, followed up quite nicely by a sweet booziness from the bourbon as well as a nice woody/oak character that I don't necessarily pick up in the aroma. The finish is well balanced, starting out with a sweet cream/marshmallow flavor, but falls short of becoming cloying, leaving just a mildly bitter, roast coffee flavor on the palate.  Mouthfeel is thick & sticky-icky. As I swirl it in my snifter, it coats the surface of the glass with an oil-like slick. Carbonation is very mild, just enough to tickle the tongue, but doesn't distract from the creamy mouthfeel of the beer. Compared to some of Founder's other bourbon barreled aged beers, I found this one to be the most balanced with the bourbon flavors. The bourbon is there but it melds perfectly with the characteristics of an amazingly well-crafted coffee stout. KBS is full of complex flavors yet remains well balanced. While I wouldn't recommend drinking more than one or two, all I know is I can't wait to crack my next KBS in a few months!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Mora2000,4.6,"Thanks to slasher007 for sharing this beer. This has been on my to-try list for years and it didn't disappoint.  The beer pours a thick black with a brown head. The aroma is bitter coffee with some chocolate as well. The flavor is very complex with bourbon, oak, chocolate and coffee. The aftertaste is heavy on the chocolate with a strong warming from the alcohol. Thick mouthfeel and low carbonation. An outstanding beer overall.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,seedsofchaos,4.23,"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no distinguishing marks of vintage or bottle number. 2010 batch.  Poured into a chalice/snifter a thick and opaque black reminding me of the mirror like qualities of a crystal ball... only jet black like the darkest of nights. Carbonation was fantastic and bubbled upwards to create a finger width head filled with colors of cappuccino and creamed coffee with just a touch of red. Head quickly fades to just a skimming but with great lacing that seems to haunt the side of my glass in large menacing rings and drips.  A heavy of bouquet of espresso beans, rich coffee and chocolate is quickly complemented by oak and vanilla. The vanilla lingers onward with hints of alcohol sharpness and bourbon richness.  Heavily alcoholic, the brew hits like the first sip of whiskey but then comes the chocolate... An interesting mixing of dark chocolate, black coffee, light oak, light molasses and espresso beans confuse my palette. Definitely enjoyable but very different. The more I sip, the more I feel as if I am drinking a cup of really great coffee as the aftertaste is only of coffee, cream and light vanilla.  Mouthfeel is medium heavy and a bit syrupy at times. For a stout, it drinks nicely and as I would expect.  Drinkability? I've downed half a chalice at this point and, at 330 pounds, feel warm and fuzzy... Don't even try to make this a session beer unless, perhaps, you're used to drinking moonshine. The beer is smooth enough, however, and the alcohol becomes dangerously more hidden over time. Careful drinking if you're having more than one.  All in all, this is a great beer with, perhaps, a little too much hype surrounding it at times. I would still recommend any BA to try one or two of these but don't go trading one-for-one for a Westy or vintage DL or anything. This is a grade ""A"" beer but it shouldn't be a white whale. This is another great offering from an already solid brewery that finds it's beers as regulars in my cellar.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

To make it even better, I found two of them.  A- Very thick and black. IF I didn't pour it from the bottle, I would think it was motor oil. Of course the nice tan head would give it away. Very sticky looking with the way it clings to the side of the glass. S- Coffee, check! Bourbon, check! KBS smells just as it advertises plus a little vanilla and roasty malts. I can't wait to try this year's version. T- As I begin to taste the coffee flavor is over powering. After a few sips, I taste the bourbon, but a stronger vanilla flavor comes through. The finish is very sweet almost like a chocolate malt. Although I taste all of these flavors, KBS becomes more balanced as it warms and as I drink more. There is no alcohol flavor at all. I can't believe I am drinking an 11%ABV beer. MF- KBS is very creamy in the mouth. It is not as thick as it looks! D-This beer is awesome. I could drink this beer again and again and again and again and again and again. O.K. You get my point. Despite the ABV, I will drink this beer anytime I have the chance.

S- Sweet,slightly boozy, some caramel, woody, rich coffee and a bit of dark chocolate.  T- Coffee and chocolate up front, accompanied by a nice vanilla that comes out more as the beer warms. Very rich, although I could do with a bit more bourbon flavor. A bit of woodyness littered throughout the beer as well.  M- Not the heaviest of hitters, but plenty thick and viscous. Perfect amount of carbonation.  D- Very very drinkable and it only gets better as you go. The alcohol is deceptively hidden, but you'll know it's there by the time the beer's gone.  I've drank two bottles of this years KBS purchased from two different locations, and they proved to be a bit different, so I scored them based on the better of the two. The difference seemed to be in the mouthfeel and the alcohol presence, with one being thinner and boozier that the other that was thick and has less bourbon presence.

Pour produced a very little half inch mocha colored head with less than average retention. As it faded it left a mere ring on the outer edges of the beer. No lacing was left at all.  Aroma consisted of some bourbon which was not overpowering, some vanilla, chocolate, oak, oats, leather. Very good aroma coming from this beer.  Upfront slightly sweet chocolate taste is first noticed that lead into some vanilla flavor coming through. In between I get some oatmeal with some coffee and a slight bourbon undertone that is really not that noticeable. Overall very smooth throughout.  Mouthfeel is full bodied with average carbonation. Smooth taste all throughout.  My impression of this beer is that it is a very good stout and deserves the praise and hype it gets.

You could smell rich chocolate and coffee. You could definitely taste elements of the bourbon oak barrels. In addition to the chocolate and coffee you could taste some vanilla.

The head is on par with the color of chocolate milk and coats the sides of the glass with nice lacing.  S: Wonderful strong smell here. Bourbon, vanilla, coffee, cream, and a touch of oatmeal all blend together for a stinging complex nose.  T: Coffee, roasted malts, and a nice layer of bourbon and vanilla all fill the tastebuds. My first bourbon aged stout, but this sets an enormous bar for the rest to come.  M: Rich with moderate to low carbonation. Would think this beer would be more creamy being a stout. A little thin, but surprisingly the bourbon kind of flows with this feel in my opinion.  D: From what I've read this one goes down very smooth.

1199,19960,Chadpaq,4.7,"I finally got my hands on a four-pack of this from my local eclectic beers shop, Lighthouse Beer and Wine. Love that place, and they definitely know their stuff. I walked in, asked if they had KBS, and the guy there nodded slowly, almost as if he didn't want me to buy it and was hoarding it for himself. Finally he said, ""Fucking...Awesome."" Of course I knew this. Scooped it on the spot.  Pours dark, dark, dark as the darkest evening you can imagine. Absolutely zero light filtration. I poured the damn thing nearly straight down, trying to get a semblance of a head on it, but no dice. This thing is HEAVY.  Wow, the smell...coffee, chocolate, so much malt, oatmeal, perhaps traces of fruitiness that reminds me of chocolate-covered cherries or something along those lines.  The taste was like no beer I have ever consumed, and I doubt I'll encounter an equal any time in the future. So much going on. Sweet, yet...not. The first taste is almost milk-chocolatey, and there's a lot of sweetness. But it finishes with a slight bitterness, much like a cup of good coffee. Your tastebuds yearn for more right after you swallow.  Not much carbonation, but there's so much going on that it would be hard to ask for more bubbles. It's very smooth, and it goes down quite easily. Perhaps a little aftertaste of bourbon as the beer begins to warm, which only makes it better.

S- Coffee and bourban as to be expected. Some caramel and molasses.  T- Coffee out the gate. Then the bourbon steps to the plate, not overpowering though. It doesn't drown out the other flavors in the beer. I still get some vanilla and molasses. As it warms I believe the bourbon flavor becomes stronger, however, it's still not overwhelming.

S: Big coffee aroma that gives way to bourbon and roasted malt, There is a good dose of chocolate in there as well. Im gettin a bunch of really dark dried fruits. reminds me of burnt raison oatmeal cookies with coffee for desert. Im also gettin a smoky campfire and licorice  T: This beer is hugely sweet right from the get go. There is a great malt presence that is in danger of getting overlooked due to the bourbon flavors. Lots of rich roasted malt, burnt bread and coffee from the malt. The actual coffee that was present in the aroma is takes a back seat in the flavor which seems odd cause you would think the aromatic property would be the first to drop off. The benchmark and profile of this beer lies in the bourbon. there is a huge bourbon flavor that is very strong but it doesn't mask everything else, there is a real complexity to this beer. Finally as you swallow and take that first breath you're hid with a nice alcohol warming and flavor. its not harsh or overbearing like i feared, it just makes for a nice warming affect. I wish this beer was released in the fall and not the spring, just seems like a camp fire beer to me (to each his own)  M: With the appearance and sweetness of this beer you'd expect you could cut it with a knife, but its surprisingly short of chewy... now that being said, its still full bodied just not as chewy as i had anticipated  D: If you define drinkability as how many you can suck down in ten minutes then cross this off the list. For me drinkability is synonymous with enjoyability. And this one's up there.

The taste was powered by bourbon. It had a nice balance of bourbon playing off the dark malts. The coffee was a little subdued compared to the aroma. The overall complexity of the flavor was incredible. As I mentioned the bourbon was in the driver's seat, but there were so many flavors present it was hard to comprehend. Overall an incredible brew.

T: Very complex, many different layers of flavor....Heavily creamed coffee (not over powering though) and lots of vanilla. Some oats, dark rich chocolate, brown sugar and carmel near the end and a crazy strong bourbon finish. Coffee is less evident in the taste, bourbon is more pronounced. The taste of bourbon and dark, creamy chocolate linger on the palate for a very long time. Going to come back to this one once I have some more reviews under me.  M/D: Full bodied, thick and very rich. Lower carbonation, silky smooth. Definitely a sipper due to the high abv and bourbon aftertaste. It probably took me a good 30-45 min to finish.

A bit of a hop bite does a great job of breaking up the sweet, rich flavors that come through in the front.

1199,19960,boatshoes,4.12,"Happy to find this on the bottle list on a visit yesterday to Brews Cafe in Granville. Along with finding Founders BB Imperial Stout, this was quite a good trip.  Appearance- Pours the usual opaque black with the thinnest sheet of dark brown head across the top. Head is gone to nothing shortly thereafter, though it appears minimal carbonation remains.  Smell- Lots of bourbon and coffee just like I was expecting. Huge notes of vanilla and rich dark roast coffee primarily that are well integrated. Finished off with just a whiff of sharp alcohol.  Taste- Very similar to the nose but I found the bourbon to come more forward than the coffee. Starts out with strong notes of vanilla and wood. Followed up with burnt, bitter coffee. Again, finishes with a bit of astringency and some sharp alcohol.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Mouthfeel was decent if leaning a touch towards the thin side as the carbonation died with the warming of the beer. Didn't really take away too much. However, in terms of drinkability for the style, I found it a bit hard to get this down towards the end of the glass primarily due to the alcohol with I felt showed through fairly strong.  Overall, a very good barrel-aged beer. However, I don't think I could have done more than one of these. Also, it is worth noting that I had this against the BB Imperial Stout, and I greatly preferred the latter. This is definitely worth a shot though and would probably benefit from some aging.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Reaper16,4.59,"served on-tap at Flying Saucer: Kansas City, MO, into a tulip glass  Pours what appears to be a jet black but scrutiny when held to light reveals it to be a very dark brown akin to the color of woodstain. 1/2 finger of lightly tan head forms with pretty soapy lacing that doesn't cling all that well.  Make no mistake -- despite the bourbon this beer is still in the Breakfast Stout family. The coffee aromas coming out of the glass are enormous. BA member turamarth turned to me and said that it smells like a mocha. Yeah, pretty much. Lots of sweetness -- vanilla, oak, coffee-flavored candies. Not so much chocolate as just a sense of maltiness. The bourbon manifests itself subtly as a kiss of alcohol on the deep inhalations. I can haz candle plz?  There is a lot of unique things going on here wrt the taste. The coffee isn't as strong as the nose suggests and the bourbon is stronger than the nose suggests. The bourbon isn't hot or overwhelming; it just adds roundness and sweetness to what the roasted malts are already doing. There is a greater presence of dark fruits in this draught version of the beer than in the bottled incarnation. Light touches of green hickory wood and a vanilla/milk sweetness add dimension and dynamism. The toffee flavors here are much stronger than in the bottle. The draught KBS has a lot more of the barrel taste within it.  Mouthfeel is thicker on-tap than the 2010 bottled version. It still isn't super-thick but it is certainly thickER. It is supremely drinkable, relatively speaking. You are drawn, commanded, to further sips. And KBS is ever-so accommodating. The high ABV% of 11.2% keeps the score from being a 5.0  KBS is slightly different on tap but no less delicious.

That went away quickly. I think it was alcohol esters with bourbon. The final nose is charred wood, boiled down coffee and vanilla.

I did not notice much bourbon flavor. The aftertaste is slightly bitter yet sweet.  Very, very appealing. I see why everybody goes crazy for these. It is not hard to drink at all.

The smell is quite simply the best I have ever encountered. Rich, freshly brewed coffee, dark chocolate, oak and just a hint of bourbon.  The taste is what had me worried. I have limited experience with bourbon aged beers, finding most of them too sweet for my liking. This is completely different. The balance here is incredible. The coffee is obvious, as is the chocolate. You then begin to pick up the subtle bourbon notes, along with vanilla, all countered nicely by a slight alcohol burn. I enjoy my bourbon straight, on the rocks, so I didn't find the bourbon here to be overpowering at all.  Incredible in the mouth. Thick, but smooth. Very lush with a perfect almost dry finish.

Nice blend of the bitter cocoa and coffee bean tastes set up with the sharp sweet bourbon flavors. Finish leaves lingering sharp bourbon taste.  M- Velvety as it rolls around in your mouth after the initial light carbonation fizzes away. This beer feels luxurious.  D- This is an 11.5% beer and it feels it. It's definitely a beer you want to savor while spending the evening sitting in your favorite leather chair thinking about how good life can be.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,xanok,4.6,"Been waiting a week to pour this guy, since I was sick when I first purchased. 2010 vintage poured into a Stone IRS tulip.  A-Thick pour, as black as you're going to get in color. A finger of tan head that fades surprisingly quickly.  S-Coffee and bourbon dominate the aroma. Coffee almost overpowering. Hints of chocolate and vanilla.  T-Happy to say the coffee wasn't overpowering like it was in the aroma. The bourbon is great here, adds awesome flavor, not hot at all until it hits your throat. Chocolate, caramel, and wood come in nicely. It's not overly complex, just blended and balanced perfectly.  M-Very big body. Carb is medium, great for the style. Great aftertaste as well. Just makes me wanna sip it more.  D-ABV is barely present. Big body, but still smooth. It's a sipper, but a fast one.  I'm not a huge fan of coffee in my beer, but this one hits the spot. It's so perfectly crafted, how could I not love it?",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Vixie,4.82,"Pours a deep black, no light getting through this at all. Forms a tan head that is not quite an inch thick, which reduces down to some nice lacing.  There's a lot going on in the smell. Coffee seems to be the main scent here, but there is also chocolate and vanilla, can also smell the alcohol.  This is one complex beer. There's coffee, there's chocolate, there's vanilla. There's flavors I can't readily identify, likely a lot is the bourbon, but since I am not familiar with that taste, I can only assume that is. Nice warming at the finish.  The feel is good and solid, just what I expected. This is one solid, serious beer.  Considering the strength, this is a very drinkable beer. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 is the bitterness in the aftertaste. I am not a fan of a lot of bitter flavor, but that is personal preference. Overall this is an amazing beer, layers of flavor, and one of the best I have tasted.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,DefenCorps,4.5,"On tap at the Brickskeller in DC last night.  Founders makes some impressive looking stouts and this is no exception. Jet black with a dense, thick, dark brown head with great retention and lacing, this is one gorgeous beer. The nose is similar to my experience with this beer out of a bottle, but a little different. There's copious amounts of coffee and chocolate, with plenty of roasted malt, but there's also a more pronounced bourbon character, with a pleasant, welcome booziness and some vanilla. Caramel character is low. The palate is quite the whopper. Big coffee and chocolate up front with plenty of roasted malt bitterness. The coffee is big, with plenty of espresso character, and coupled with the medium-full body, it just feels like one. Bourbon is quite prominent as well, with heat and vanilla present. Bitter chocolate and coffee are present on the finish, along with a boozy heat. Pretty solid stuff, I drank about 20oz of it and could have gone for another glass.  **Edit 07 Sept 2015. 08 Vintage, old style label.  Coffee's faded, bourbon is noticeable but mellowed, bitter dark chocolate, unsweetened cocoa, some raisin, port notes. Buckwheat honey. Palate has more of these flavors in harmonious balance. The lack of coffee makes this less glorious, but still, this is delicious. Just a shade thin in parts, this medium to full bodied beer is delicious. 4.5/4.25/4.25",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,atremains,4.58,"2010 Pours out one of the darkest beers I've seen lately. Dark fudge color 2 finger head. This thing is unbreakable. Great retention, great lacing. Amazing looking beer.  The smell could overall be a bit stronger. You can really get an idea for the whiskey here. Other things I can pick up off the bat are chocolate, toasted malt, and vanilla.  The chocolate is abundant in the taste. Probably my favorite aspect of this beer. Another point of interest is the vanilla. From what I've been told, last years KBS was different in that it didn't have vanilla. Toasted malts, cocoa, bourbon, feint hops; the two strongest elements are the whiskey and the chocolate.  The mouthfeel is also spot on. Very rich. Full-bodied, wonderful creaminess. There is some heat from the alcohol, it might be easy to consider this too hot. I'm going to wait quite a while before I drink anymore of these  This beer is excellent, but the price is off-putting. I may enjoy this extremely, but there are many other beers for much less that I also enjoy extremely. I've seen some wallets pillaged for 14 dollars a bottle at the Dirty Truth in Northampton.

1199,19960,RJay,4.45,"Appearance - Black with no light able to penetrate through. There was a small amount of tan head that settled down to just surrounding the edge of the glass within a minute.  Aroma - Initially I was hit with coffee and then sweet bourbon, chocolate, and some vanilla notes. In away it kind of reminds me of an Irish cream.  Taste - Well balanced, sweet and bitter with the taste of bourbon, warm alcohol, chocolate, vanilla, and coffee are also present here.  Mouth Feel - Smooth and creamy! Coats the mouth nicely and has the perfect amount of carbonization.  Drinkability - I would love to session this stuff but it is a tad expensive (but worth it) and it may be hard to walk after a few. This is something to save for special occasions, excellent beer!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,sisuspeed,4.67,"2010 KBS  Big black body with a thin tan head that slowly reduces to a ring of foam around the glass. Light lacing is left behind.  A decent amount of bourbon on the nose, but not overpowering. The barrel wood comes through quite a bit, along with some well roasted coffee beans and dark rich malts. Some chocolate is present as well. One of the better bourbon stout aromas I've come across.  Bourbon soaked wood and roasted coffee roll across the tongue on the first sip. Lots of the barrel coming through, but the bourbon is actually much more toned down than I would have thought. Very well balanced. A touch of vanilla and some faint dark fruits (most likely from the bourbon). A little bit of astringency from the coffee, but evened out by a subtle chocolate presence. Rich and complex. The flavor is excellent and the bourbon is integrated well.  A smooth, creamy body adds points to the mouthfeel. Carbonation is about right. Slight warming from the alcohol and a bit of harshness from the wood and coffee beans.  One bottle is the perfect serving size. This is definitely a sipper, but quite drinkable for the style. The ABV is pretty well masked and the complexity and richness of the flavor make this very enjoyable to drink.  Overall, this is probably one of the best, if not the best bourbon stouts I have had. Instead of knocking you over the head with bourbon, Founders does a really great job of balancing the barrel aging with the rest of the flavor profile. Lots of stuff going on with this one. This beer lives up to the hype and is worth the price. It will be hard to resist the other three I'm trying to age in my cellar.

S - It smelled of coffee, chocolate and bourbon. These three aromas were all very balanced, none overpowered the others. There were very mild notes of vanilla and toffee.  T - Some boozy, bourbon flavors with dark roasted coffee flavors. Nice chocolate, caramel and toffee flavors, too.  M - It was crisp, sharp and smooth. A medium bodied beer with some warm alcohol heat.

1199,19960,BearsOnAcid,3.35,"Decided to review this beer after having a 2009 next to a 2010 last night. I'll use the fresh one as the review but will leave some extra notes.  Beer pours out black with a caramel head. Nose is soaked with bourbon and chocolate. KBS holds a dark roasted aroma. But it's not overpowering.  This years batch seems a little less carbonated than last years, making it richer and smoother on the palate. Oak, bourbon, chocolate, and roast malt mix together on your taste buds. Still not very over powering. Bourbon is not as hot as some people say it is. I get more chocolate than anything in this batch.  Extra notes: I want to say that KBS, for me, has always been all over the place in flavor. Some will be heavy on bourbon and some will be heavy on chocolate and then the rest will all fall within that range. I've only actually had a few bottles that were fully balanced. But after I was able to get that rarity/hype factor out of my head I can say that I've never actually been blown away by it. And for a stout that has won so much fame, it's no where near as complex, decadent or robust as something like Bourbon County Stout. It excels in drinkability. It's smooth and silky but doesn't cause any fatigue in your tastebuds.  The 09 vintage, thanks to screw off caps, was awful. It had started oxidizing and tasted like wet cardboard and chalk. The nose was even worse. Underneath that, I don't feel like this is a beer to even bother aging. All the things that make this beer good are right there in the beginning and then after a year they start to fade and leave a pretty boring BA stout.  Drink these fresh people.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,WonderfulSam,4.9,"There are more sophisticated reviewers than I (see Buckeye Nation, for example). So allow me to say simply this: I was in DC for business, went to Brickskeller, and happened to walk in when they were changing out taps. They had one keg of this stuff. I can't get it at home so I jumped on it.  Quite simply:  THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING BEERS I HAVE HAD. I FELT HONORED TO DRINK IT.  Seriously. It was that good. Smooth. Complex. Drinkable.

1199,19960,kegger22,4.9,"Finally, the elusive Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout, well worth the wait.  KBS poured a very, very dark, opaque brown with a half inch darkly tanned head the quickly faded to a slim, but elegant collar.  The aroma was black coffee, rich dark chocolate and, I swear, light peanut butter; in that order.  The taste was... hold on, I expected KBS to be over rated, and I expected to have a home state bias. It wasn't! And, I didn't. It was so good, I had to crack open a second one, and it was warm, no matter. Roasted coffee, chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and yes, oh yes, alcohol. I do want to taste some hot alcohol in my bourbon barrel aged beers, or else why bother. KBS had IT.  Mouth feel was full bodied, oily and perfectly (modestly) carbonated.  Drinkability, this is my second one, I would love another. ABV be damned.  OK, call me a homer, but this is good shit. Make this a year-rounder Founders! On a side note; this makes me want to try another of my cellared Expedition stouts and do a re-rate.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,endincolorado,4.8,"Presented in one of Founders' signature short, brown bottles with a very cool label featuring a yellowed-parchment look and western-style font.  Pours thick and black as sin, with a very dark tan head that rises a moment after the pour and settles slowly after into the viscous fluid beneath. When this beer is sloshed around it moves slowly and with a purpose. Great dark sheets of lace cling all around the sides of my snifter.  The aroma is sweet and woody with dark fruit and black coffee. The hint of bourbon in the nose takes me back to touring the inside of Maker's Mark distillery near Bardstown in Kentucky and the annual Bourbon Festival for which I make the trip down.  The flavor of this beer cannot be topped. The rich and full, syrupy texture delivers sweet roastiness, smoke, wood, a healthy booziness, fruit, coffee, and chocolate, all in a perfectly harmonious medley.  I could drink this until my vision blurs and the world goes dark around me. Realistically, one ought not to do this, and the price tag would prevent any frugal man from indulging in more than one per sitting.

1199,19960,Beerinabelle,4.84,"This is one of my go-to favorite stouts, so it is fitting that it is my first review. KBS 2010!  The color of this nearly perfect looking beer is dark brown/black with very little transparency. Late rising bubbles appear in a light mocha color, and rise to less than half a finger high. Some bubbles remain around the edge of my glass as I watch the enticing foam dissipate. A small ring of lacing sticks to the sides of my pint shaped taster glass.  It is still too cold from the fridge, so I wrap my hands around the glass to warm it slightly. The smell overflows with bourbon, fresh brewed coffee, vanilla and some oak. I really hope that the claims are true and I can use this any time I am in distress! ;) It does have that slight medicinal scent.  Finally!! I get to drink it. Writing reviews is a bit of a tease. mmm...it is bit more roasty and bitter then I remember. I love the hint of vanilla sweetness and the perfect balance of bourbon/whiskey. The almost overpowering mouthful of coffee excites the senses, and I can't stop drinking it. Is it really 11.2%?! Not hot...even though this batch came out very recently. Dangerously delicious?  Just the right amount of carbonation tickles my tongue, while the creamy body swirls around my mouth leaving a satisfyingly smooth feeling. It is intoxicating, literally and sensor(ily). I really could have way too many of these!  The drink-ability falters when one contemplates the 11.2%...and how easy it would be to get very silly! This could be very dangerous if I wasn't in the privacy of my own home.

Don't know if I ever will again.  The appearance is an abyss of blackness, with a mocha creamy head that develops with difficulty but has some staying power. Totally opaque.  The aroma is deeply burnt and has a large presence of bourbon and vanilla. Oaky nose and really sublime.  The alcohol hits you immediately in the flavor, and does deliver a constant burn throughout. Massive burnt malt flavorings, but you also can grab hold of the vanilla and the bourbon, especially in the finish. Complex and rich in its latent bitterness. Amazing.  The feel is creamy and thick but far from overdone and not sticky.  What cliches haven't been mentioned? Who couldn't love this beer?

1199,19960,BillyBoysPie,4.52,"Bottle into a snifter.  Pours an opaque black with an inch of dense milky/coffee foam head. Dissipates into a small cloud on the surface with significant lacing.  Rich smell - loaded with bourbon, coffee and chocolate. Lost of toast from the oak in the nose, and a touch of heat. I don't get an overwhelming heat from this, which seems to be a point of contention this year (and in general...). I'd say this - to each their own, but I don't see it out of style. It's well balanced, but the nose doesn't suggest more than a year two of aging. Plenty of depth at the moment: but age could be good.  Very deep and dense on the tongue. Creamy, but not sticky. Very palatable. Coffee and bitter cocoa dominate the flavor - with enough other flavors floating over. Some of the milk flavors are present, but the sweet honey flavors from the bourbon are light. No florals, but a touch of heat from the bourbon. Lots of toasty flavors come into play to keep the warmth in check. Warms well - a hint of metallic stuff on the end.  Clearly, unless someone is in the mood to kill their liver and brain (not to mention their wallet), don't have a bunch in one night. I'll be aging one or two.

I can't scribble enough on my pad to even remotely come close to doing this beer justice. Pours black chocolate with Bourbon, chocolate, coffee, and alcohol on the nose. 100% velvet with the bourbon coming through just enough and then slowly fades back into a bitter chocolate and soothed over with malt sweetness.

The deep wonderful aroma of creamy chocolate with the undertones of alcohol and coffee. The smell only intensifies as the stout warms. Every time I put it to my nose I found myself saying, ""Wow!"" I just love the bouquet of this beer.  Taste: Warm, warm chocolate, like a spiked hot cocoa, yet not sweet. Like a 70% Lindt chocolate cordial. It warms all the way down and should definitely be drunk slowly and deliberately. The aftertaste is where you get the coffee, like the best arabica coffee beans.

I am currently a wine consultant but, I have several years of beer tasting experience. I guess that I have tried well over 100 beers, not including macro brews. The hype in the beer world is no different than the hype in the wine world so, I have to rip on this fairly overrated beer:  A: pours a slightly oily black stew with no head.  S: smells like mesquite wood, fresh ground coffee and dark chocolate. No bourbon aromas to be found.  T: Bitter sweet espresso shot cold. Long finish. Hate to say it but, it tastes just like a can of Starbucks Double Shot Espresso with less sugar and no cream. Not as boozy as a Bourbon County Stout as I thought it would be. Where's the bourbon?  M: Not as cloying as I thought it would be. Palate is on the medium body side and dryer than I thought it would be which is good.  D: One in the morning or one at night. Good with smoked cheese.  Both beer and movies have their ""fan boys"" (you know, the kind that love eye candy movies like The Matrix and Star Wars and will give movies like that a high rating simply because they are supposed to like it), and this beer will be praised by biased drinkers and will try to tell you it is the best thing ever.

After tasting it, there's no doubt in my mind that it deserves all the praise.  Typical appearance for a top notch stout. Black, thick, good cinnamon colored head.  Smell...mmm. Tons of coffee, molasses, and of course, bourbon. There's a nice touch of vanilla and charred oak. One thing that sets this apart from a lot of the other bourbon barrel aged stouts is the definitive presence of coffee. It almost surpasses the bourbon.  Hands down the best bourbon barrel aged beer I've had. There's a lot to be said about how smooth and mellow the bourbon is, while still being vivid. You get all the classic notes of vanilla and wood without any of the astringency that usually tags along. The coffee again is a major player and it's dark roast and fresh. The aftertaste is sweet and is somewhere between brown sugar and maple syrup.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. The alcohol is modest considering the abv and fact that it's aged in bourbon.  This is surprisingly smooth for being aged in bourbon barrels. I really enjoy barrel aged stouts, with it being a current trend, and this one does it the best. I have a hometown alliegance to GI BCS, but must say that this passed it on my list.

The finish is beautiful with notes of caramel, sweet coffee, cream and brown sugar. Great flavour.  M: Just smooth and elegant, creamy, it's great.  D: Founders blows me away again.

Light cannot penetrate a glass of this at all.  S - Founders nailed it with this one. The bourbon aroma dominates, but coffee and cocoa take away the edge and leave a truly fantastic smell.  T - Wow. Each sip is like a great journey. The first tongue contact reveals a sweet, mildly fruity character. Then a wonderful bourbon flavor comes through... balanced and woody, not overpowering. After the bourbon fades, a chocolate flavor is revealed, with the tail becoming darker and slightly bitter. This is definitely of the best stouts I've ever had.  M - Wonderfully creamy and thick... it coats your tongue and mouth without any ""grittiness"".  D - Perhaps this is the weak point of this excellent beer. The taste is wonderful, complex and powerful, but it simply will not go away. The bourbon and chocolate resonate forever... simply robbing you of an insatiable desire for the next sip (but perhaps I'm being a bit critical considering the 11.2% ABV).  Overall: This is a really, really nice imperial stout. It has an incredible taste... but it's a bit extreme and not an ""easy to drink"".

1199,19960,ghostee,4.88,"12oz bottle, 2010 vintage, poured into a pint glass.  Pours a pitch black with virtually no head. Lets no light through, this stuff is black like the Abyss. Seeing this darkness filling my glass made me happy.  Smells of coffee, caramel, and sugar.  The taste is fantastic. It's very smooth, and the alcohol is well hidden. Only a slight hint of booziness to the taste. Taste follows the smell, with the coffee, caramel, and sugar, as well as dark chocolate and vanilla. A bit of bitterness, but it is a very smooth and creamy brew overall.  Mouthfeel is heavy, thick, and creamy. Feels substantial. Perfect amount of carbonation.  Drinkability is good, perhaps too good. I could have a couple of a these, but given how strong they are, I'd rather appreciate a single bottle in a sitting.  Verdict: Amazing  This was my first KBS, and hopefully will not be my last.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Lerxst,4.8,"Much thanks to sjccmd for this one.  2009 vintage poured into a tulip  A-Black as night. A moderate pour produced a thin mocha colored head that receded into a ring. Looks good.  S-A great roasted coffee scent hits me right off followed up by definitive chocolate notes, bourbon and some vanilla. Smells great.  T-A nice bourbon flavor hits first but doesn't overwhelm, followed up by sweet vanilla, roasted coffee, chocolate and a wonderful earthy/woody flavor. Well balanced, these flavors all represent and really intermingle nicely with each other. Simply put, this is exceptional.  M-Viscous, full bodied, coats the palate well, creamy with a carb level that is just right.  D-Its really drinkable for a big beer.

1199,19960,jjshowal,5,"Poured from a growler into a Balloon Goblet.  This is simply one of the most enjoyable and best beer experiences I have ever had. I was with my older brother on a cool spring night in March on the outskirts of Cincinnati.  I won't even go into the specifics of each aspect of the beer, but I will say this is the only imperial stout that I have experienced three wonderfully distinct and vivid flavors in a row.  As soon as the extremely thick, black, syrupy consistency beer pours into the glass you are hit with an unforgettable aroma that is complemented by the perfect amount of carbonation for an imperial stout. The thick, amber-colored foamy head remains through the drink followed by a beautiful lacing.  When it hits your tongue, the drinker experiences a creamy chocolate taste that is infused with hints of vanilla. While in the mouth, a deep and rich coffee flavor erupts that is very powerful, yet very drinkable. The finish is a distinct flavor of aged oak and bourbon that is bitter and strong without being overwhelming. An incredibly soothing and warming experience. After being refrigerated overnight, we let the growler sit out for about a half hour or so drinking it at about 50 degrees.  Founders is known for making extreme beers and stouts and the Kentucky breakfast is no exception. Simply put, this beer will kick your ASS! I do not recommend this as a session beer. One is all you need to enjoy. After finishing the beer, I lit up a Makers Mark soaked Cigar that was an excellent cap to probably the best beer I have ever had.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A: Dark and opaque with a layer of creamy tan head that leaves ample lacing.  S: Coffee and chocolate notes familiar to Breakfast Stout fans, then vanilla and woodsy bourbon but not too much alcohol.  T: First, more coffee and chocolate. Then, a layer of bourbon blanketed by roasty and creamy vanilla. A touch of bourbon peat on the finish, followed up by more chocolate and coffee.  M: Lovely.  D: A well-hidden 11.2 percent.

I poured this review in a Westmalle trappiest chalice. i wanted it to breath.  i smell the infusion of bourbon all the coffee and chocolate, i like a beer that is infused very well, and i think that the chocolate and coffee is what gives this stout balance from the aging in the barrels, for example, ive tasted hoppin frog boris , old yeti oak age beers and you taste the pronounced flavor of the whiskey etc.  the taste is creamy of sorts and that's what i like in stout to be thick.

1199,19960,ChadQuest,4.53,"Oh no joke this is a 5 for visual. this is almost as much fun to watch as cirque de soleil, and i would support a photograph being placed in the american art society. Pours a viscous black motor oil with a Chocolate Milk colored head that is so thick itself that it mounds up in the center and stays like a black mountain. this head stays forever but leaves a wake of lacing as it departs.  There is some bourbon in the aroma but not an insane amount like BCS, the coffee is supportive in whispers, but the chocolate really stands out here.  There is great big smooth vanilla and chocolate flavors twisting around, with those roasty and coffee flavors coming in more on the finish. the bourbon... well the bourbon is sneaking in from the backdoor and making its mark, but while alcohol hotness is very subtle for a 11.2% beer,it is faintly disernable and mostly gives background notes. Bella.  Smooth,Thick, oily, palette coating, heavy bodied. heavy hitter. Smooth. light carbination.  The smoothness and light carbination give this so much drinkability. the alcohol is the only concern at all. I don't see a point of getting tired of the flavors of this one.

1199,19960,WYVYRN527,4.58,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter.  A: This beer pours pitch black, with a thin brown head that settles quickly. A thin film is left on the surface, and it produces legs more than lacing, almost like wine.  S: The nose of this brew is not as strong as I would expect. There is a lot of coffee, with subtle hints of vanilla, coconut, and toasted oak. Alcohol is also present on the nose.  T: Coffee is present at first, with wonderful hints of chocolate, vanilla, coconut, dark fruits and oak. Hops don't show much here, as the bitterness comes most likely from the coffee. KBS isn't as sweet as other brews of this style. The finish is bitter, and the alcohol lends a nice warming touch.  M: This stuff has the consistency of used motor oil. Viscous, chewy, and very big. The finish is silky as ever and lasts for eons.  D: This beer, despite how big it is, is actually very easy to drink. It will be interesting to see what this tastes like after some cellar time.

1199,19960,masterhomebrewer,5,"A = Crazy dark black. About as black and opaque a beer as I've ever seen. One-centimeter, brown head forms slowly and lingers.  S = I am very pleasantly surprised to catch bourbon straight-away with the initial smell. Much more so than the 2009 version, which lacked in both bourbon and coffee charachteristics. Fabulous, beautiful array of bourbon, coffee, chocolate, dark fruits and roasted malt.  T = A lot like the smell. Bourbon, tons of malt (especially Special B), coffee, roast all work in unison to create a fantastic tasting experience.  M = Really thick and luscious, coating the entire surface of the tongue and palate -- just as I like my imperial stouts to be. Smooth and warm light carbonation that works at bringing out all complex aspects of the beer.  D = The easiest drinking 11.2--percent I've ever had. Just fantastic and delicious, and deadly drinkable. This is a young beer at this point, and I can't even imagine how it well it might age out. Seek and destroy this one.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,hardy008,4.82,"Pours as dark a black as any beer I have seen. Has a nice dark tan head about one finger high, with decent retention. I could smell the Bourbon as soon as I opened the bottle, what a great smell it is. In addition to Bourbon, coffee, chocolate, oak, and vanilla is also present in the smell. This should be real good.  The taste is fantastic. Bourbon, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, oak, and some roasted malt all blend together perfectly. There is a little alcohol heat, but much less than I thought there would be. With some age, this should be even more incredible, if that is possible.  Feels medium to full bodied with low carbonation, which is proper for this beer. Very smooth and creamy. Very drinkable. I am glad I was able to pick up several more bottles of this.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,TCHopCraver,4.27,"Mmmm hmmm, I've been a-waitin fer this one fer awhile. Poured this rascal after just a short time in the fridge.  A: Pours nearly black as a country night, with just a touch of brown in the body into an oversized wine glass. The head is a 1/2 finger, perrrtty mocha-brown that fades quickly, I reckon. The lacing is a wacky, sticky mixture of dots and clumpy, curvy snakes.  S: A hefty helpin' of dark, roasted coffee is the biggest aroma in my sniffer, but that is wonderfully balanced by some sweeter smells, them bein' dark chocolate, caramel, and vanilla. The bourbon-oak smells are present, but relatively far back in the bouquet.  T: This seems to be a reverse of dominance of flavor as opposed to the smell. The oak, bourbon, and acidic coffee tastes are more of the dominant flavor, overbalancing the chocolate and vanilla tastes a bit. This is a really a complex sipper. The more I get acquainted with it, either I'm just getting used to the bitter heat, or the sweet flavors pop a bit more, because it's getting more and more balanced with time. It's really a three movement piece, with the acidic, bourbon-oak the allegro first movement, the sweet chocolate/vanilla/caramel the adagio second movement, and the puckering finish the swashbuckling third movement. Bottom line, I think all of these flavors will meld more with age. I'm happy that I have sufficient supply to try them at different stages of life.  M: This pretty much has every color of the rainbow. It is creamy, yet puckering, full, yet light and airy at times. I think I would rate it higher if the puckering bitterness wasn't the overriding impression to the palate.  D: Out of curiosity to figure this beer out, I could definitely have another. However, the high a.b.v. and the bitterness in its current form lend me to say the drinkability is only good. I think I'll be updating this review in the future when the beer has had plenty of time to do its bottle-aging dance.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,jokelahoma,4.82,"Poured an intense deep black, with just a skiff of head which lasts fairly well.  Aroma is chock full o' goodness, with coffee, vanilla, bourbon and oak coming to the fore. There's a whiff of booziness too, which isn't surprising given the 11.2% abv. Smells absolutely fantastic.  Taste is incredible. My first taste impression is oak. That's followed quickly by bourbon and vanilla flavors, with some dark fruits worked in. That's followed by a moderate blast of cocoa, which ultimately fades into a strong coffee taste. All these meld in the aftertaste, creating a wonderfully complex flavor that partly dances on your taste buds, and partly pounds on them with a sledgehammer. Only after that starts to recede do you notice the booze. There's a lingering heat here, even more noticable if you breathe in through your mouth, like a wine taster. The beer is bitter, but not hoppy. All this works together to create a sublime taste experience. I'd consider my life to be poorer had I not tasted this.  Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, as makes sense with the oatmeal. Substantial, matching the substantial flavors. It wouldn't do to have it any different.  The price tag slowed me down here, but my curiosity won in the end. Am I ever glad it did. One of the rare beers which actually exceeds the hype surrounding it.

This one is shaping up nicely.  S - Just like a cup of joe! Strong and robust coffee notes, with some more subtle chocolate and roasty hues as well. Amazingly complex.  T - This is everything I want in a coffee stout in particular, and a stout in general: strong coffee (w/cream, not black), dark AND milk chocolate mixed up together, bit of molasses and some hints of licorice - but just barely. Nice vanilla and oak character, never over-bearing as often happens. Light on the hop profile, yet it is evident. Fiercely complex.

1199,19960,Chico1985,4.45,"Picked up a (overpriced) single earlier this week at Table & Vine. Luckily, my awesome girlfriend picked me up a 4-pack out in Worcester today, so I feel fine about drinking this now. Pours a truly evil shade of black, nice creamy 1-finger tan head. Looks good the whole time and leaves some nice lacing. Smell is incredible, smells like rich vanilla bourbon, throw some great chocolate and oak/caramel and you've got the smell of this beer. If I blindly smelled this I would probably think it's some chocolate mix drink. I only pick up a very slight coffee scents. Taste seems to be chocolate right off the bat, followed by strong tastes of bitter roasted coffee, then finishes with a vanilla/strong bourbon taste. I truthfully pick up a bit more bourbon in the nose than in the taste. It is an extreme taste at times though, sitting on the tongue long after a sip and burning the nostrils slightly. The alcohol is definitely a bit much but it has a great warming affect. Mouthfeel is definitely more creamy than thick, coats the mouth nicely. Definitely hot on the mouth and throat especially with booze though. Drinkability I gotta pin at a 3.5 because of that too. Overall another excellent beer from Founders, but the alcohol is too hot and the flavors don't jump out enough. I don't think it really lives up to the hype, fresh anyways. As of right now I prefer the regular Breakfast Stout, but I'm going to save the rest for at least a year and re-review/put notes here...  *More notes - 3/17/11 - 1 year old bottle*  Alcohol is toned down for sure from the fresh bottle, but still a little hot for my tastes. The chocolate and coffee are really intense, and balance out the bourbon nicely, tastes linger on the tongue long afterwords as it writhes from the madness. Smooth oily mouthfeel, low carbonation, feels a bit thin to me though. Very roasty and strong. Too hot for me to consider it one of the best stouts I've had, but undeniably excellent flavors here.

1199,19960,BelgianPrincess,4.7,"12 oz. bottle 1/2 into snifter @ 55 F then 1/2 @ 50 F  A - Poured slowly: oily black with almost no head. Very dark with 0 - minimal visibility around the edges. 2nd 1/2 glass poured more vigorously to reveal an 1/8th inch tan/brown head that dissipates into light lacing.  S - Predominantly coffee with hints of oak, vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, prunes and/or figs. Very nice!  T - Mildly boozy with coffee up front that develops into roasted coffee then chocolate/vanilla/oak flavors. Balanced by enough bitterness and sweetness to age very well (this is a newly released bottle) and as importantly, taste great now. Finishes with a dry roasted coffee flavor.  M - Thick and slightly oily/syrupy, but with carbonation that lifts into delicate small bubbles at the end.  D - This is dangerously delicious, but much better sipped, slurped, rolled, and savored.  ... 20 min later... just swilled the KBS bottle with 1/2 a guinness stout and poured into the same snifter... added 1/2 oz Irish Whiskey 1/2 oz Irish Creme for a ""car bomb.""

The bubbles are few but do form an entire skin on the top of the beer for a little bit and then falls to a thin ring on the glass. No lacing to be seen.  S= Nice complexity here. There is a lot of coffee in it but the coffee is mixed in with a ton of other flavors. Nice oak and vanilla complements. Loads of dark chocolate as well. There is a real nice roastyness to the malts as well. Really a ton of nose to this one.  T= The beer starts again with a lot of coffee flavor. Then the oaky wood comes through with a smaller amount of vanilla. A little less vanilla than I usually get from Founders beers. There is a pretty decent amount of heat coming from the alcohol in it. The chocolate is deep and dark in this one too. The finish highlights the chocolate and heat in it.  M= Low carbonation making this a little more coating than the average stout. A little too much heat in the back making it burn a little.  D= Let this one warm up a bit for sure. This beer is good but I just don't see it living up to the hype that it recieves.

However, one of the reasons I love beer is that is a unique experience. The taste and the buzz are unavailable elsewhere.

Some nice soapy lacing remains.  S - This aroma is tremendous. Chocolate milk mixed with coffee and sugar. A deeper inhale produces the oak.  T - Huge amount of roasted malt upfront quickly mixes with some chocolate sweetness. This tastes much sweeter than I expected and almost like there is a shot of Hershey's in here.

Poured into a Duvel Tulip.  A: Jet black with brownish hues. As I pour it, it doesn't have a ton of carbonation. This shows in the head, as there really isn't a whole lot. The 1/2 inch head I do get, dies quickly. Other than this, it looks like a nice black stout with an brownish head.  S: Now we're getting better. Chocolate and roastiness is there first. Definitely some coffee in here. This is followed up by vanilla and chocolately sweetness. The barrel notes round out the end with some woodiness and burnt coconut. Slight bourbon notes as well. Smells like a fine desert rather than a beer, but that is ok with me.  T: So flavorful and complex, where do I start? First I notice the stout components with roasty malts. This is followed up by strong coffee flavors. Not overpowering but a nice, faintly earthy roast. This is followed by a nice strong chocolate flavor. Not too dark, not to light, not too overpowering, but there. The chocolate blends with the pleasant malty sweetness. In the end a ton of stuff going on. Woody barrel flavors, a touch of vanilla, some burnt coconut and there's the bourbon. All of these are subtle but the bourbon seems to last a bit. Not overpowering but definitely there. The hops lend a necessary bitterness, but it ends there. Maybe some pine, but with all of the other flavors going on, the hops don't need to add much flavor.  M: Medium bodied. A bit on the lighter end for a bigger stout. The carbonation is a little lower than I'd normally like. Otherwise velvety and smooth.  D: This is an exceptional beer. Definitely lives up to its name. I'm glad I picked up a 4-pack because this will age well. Will be nice to compare it in years to come to the newer batches.

Minimal dark brown head, that sorta sticks around the edges of the glass. Swirl the glass and the beer oozes down the sides. Neat.  Smell is strong with black coffee, charred oak, burnt toffee... and something else I can't quite place. Smells totally awesome.  Taste is chocolate, coffee, bourbon, and charred.. something (maybe more toffee). Lots of coffee and bourbon in the aftertaste. Crap, this is some good stuff.  Mouthfeel is super thick, almost the consistency of heavy cream. The bit of carbonation that's in the beer seems to load up on your tongue and make the beer seem really thick.  Drinkability is as high as an %11.2 abv beer could be. Can't taste much alcohol. Really, the most surprising thing about this beer is how balanced all the flavors are, and how nothing is all that overpowering.  Lives up to the hype. Fantastic. I only managed one 4-pack..

1199,19960,Drone53,4.58,"Appearance - Pours a nice motor oil black. Literally looks like that stuff thats been sitting in the oil pan. Pours with a small head which quickly dissolves, however a nice lace is left throughout.  Smell - Initial smell is definitely a nice bourbon and boozy smell, definitely smell the alcohol in this brew. This initial smell is followed by nice strong coffee and chocolate aroma. Strangely enough I definitely smelt some vanilla as well.  Taste - Bourbon is definitely present in the taste, followed by chocolate and coffee. The bourbon feel definitely continues throughout. This reminds me of those cold ""tailgate mornings"" where you add a little nip to your coffee for extra warmth.  Mouthfeel - Nice mouthfeel. The booze makes it a little drying, but the malt presence is very nice for such a strong beer.  Drinkability - Definitely a good beer to split with a friend. I had the entire 11.2oz bottle to myself over the course of probably 75 minutes, and I would suggest splitting it with friend due to the strong alcohol content.

S - Sweet-smelling, with strong vanilla and chocolate, not unlike a malted black-and-white milkshake. No kidding. Undertones of tobacco and (obviously) bourbon. Possibly the best-smelling beer I've ever sniffed. Almost seems a sin to drink, but if I must...  T - Up-front malt, oak, and warm alcohol on first sip, not unlike what I imagine a coffee-flavored bourbon to taste. Second sip brings out more flavors. This is a complex brew. Lots of tastes now. Chocolate more pronounced, and oak moves to the finish. Lots of dark flavors and slight spice.  M - Smooth and chewy like a stout should be, but finishes quite dry. Has a little bite to it. Coats the palette and lingers, even a few minutes after finishing.  D - Due to the dry finish and complexity, it practically begs to be sipped over and over. I often drink stouts quite slowly, but not this. It's what I call ""dangerous"" - high alcohol that is incredibly drinkable. Possibly the most drinkable stout I've had.  Overall, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, especially being such a fan of the ""ordinary"" Breakfast Stout. While I'm not entirely certain it lives up to hype, my score certainly tells a different story. I can honestly say that I think it's the best stout I've had.

Chocolate tones are there too. A little vanilla in there too. The scent of bourbon comes in a bit later but its definitely there.  T - Tastes just like it smells: rich, roasty and complex. The coffee and chocolate flavors play off each other beautifully. Whiskey tones are there the whole way, although not overpowering. Its a nice complimentary player. Alcoholic, whiskey like finish.  M - So smooth and creamy. Low carbonation level is perfect. Absolutely amazing mouth feel.  D - This one lived up to the hype for me. Surprisingly drinkable for an 11% beer too.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Mavajo,4.5,"Pours total black with a fair size brown head. Pretty good retention with a bit of sticky lacing down the glass. The nose is a coffee assault - the moment I popped the cap off the bottle, my nostrils were being assailed. Wonderful.  Taste has the strong coffee taste, with layers of bourbon, vanilla, toffee and a fair bit boozy - there was also a characteristic that reminded me of cough syrup or NyQuil, which distracted me a bit from time to time (note from the future: I don't experience this every time, so I'll just mark it down as my screwed up palate). Aside from that distraction, the taste is excellent. Extremely intense taste. Mouthfeel is absolutely phenomenal - silky smooth, space-gobbling full, and perfect carbonation. I don't think I've ever experienced a better mouthfeel.  Phenomenal stout.

About 3cm of copper creama colored head. Lingers for a second or two then recedes to a thin film on the surface of the oil. Specks of lacing on the walls of the glass; probably will disappear once drinking has begun.  Nose: First wiff this elixer smells like a top of the line Mocha from my fav coffee haunt. Soft milk chocolate hints laced around some bitter coffee and sweet milk. A sort of dusty coffee scent as well, like if you were to sniff a really, really thick cup of dark coffee brewed in a french press. Almost makes me think that when I taste it, it will leave a coating of sedimentary coffee grounds. A bit of toffey. And a hint of booze.  Taste: Again reminds me a lot of a very sweet mocha. The flavors here are very subtle and bold at the same time. There's a big coffee chocolate base to the flavors. But, there's also a milky softness to the palate. Vanilla is there, along with milk chocolate, and a nice espresso-in-a-latte bitterness. Some musky hops rest on the aftertaste. Booze is in the taste, some may think a little too much. This is super tasty.  Mouth: Founder's Magical Cure-all is thick and smooth. Milky almost in texture. Still has a nice carbonation that keeps it from getting too muddy on the mouth. Don't need no sugar to keep this medicine down.  Drink: This is a big, thick, coffeyey son of a bitch. Drink this quickly and yous a fool for a number of reasons. This deserves to be sipped and appreciated. And its pretty boozy...",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smell: Lots of layers here - chocolate, espresso beans, vanilla, oak, cherry, cocoa, char and molasses.  Taste: Chocolate, coffee, molasses and licorice upfront and then becomes more bourbon-like with vanilla, oak and cherry. Rich, complex and delectable.  Feel: Low carbonation, thick and chewy body, wonderfully smooth, extremely warming - almost burns down the throat.  Drinkability: Fantastic cross between an Imperial Stout, coffee ale, and Bourbon-aged beer. Never before have I finished a beer over 10% abv and immediately wanted a second.

1199,19960,BedetheVenerable,4.23,"Presentation: One of the first pours from a 2009 barrel, on tap down at Sycamore's Founder's Beer Dinner  Appearance: Pitch black, and I mean BLACK, opaque beer, with a large creamy dark tan cap with good retention and some nice thick sticky lacing.  Smell: Massive aromas of coffee liqueur and dark chocolate; this is sweet, lightly boozy, rich, and wonderful  Taste: Wow, this has aged beautifully. There are notes of rich medium-roast coffee, dark chocolate, a mild bourbon character with some dark fruit as well...coffee is predominate here, but this has aged very nicely and everything is blended together into a nearly seamless whole. As it warms, the chocolate notes become a bit more pronounced, and the booze emerges a bit, along with some very light wood notes  Mouthfeel: Smooth and fairly rich/full  Drinkability: You know it's strong...but you keep drinking it...  Conclusion: I had high hopes for this, and they were well-met. One of the best coffee (and bourbon-barrel, for that matter) stouts I've had to this point. Well-done Founders. I don't know if it's sharper and more intense when it's fresh; I'll have to wait until the bottled 2010 comes out in two days; what I will tell you is that with a year of age on it this is great.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,sugarbrew,4.8,"2010 vintage, poured from a 12oz into a nonic imperial pint glass.  A- Oily, impenetrable black pour with some understated lacing. A thin, creamy caramel head lingers densely around the edge of the glass.  S- Bitter chocolate, cracked, dark roast coffee and smoky hickory wood. A powerful and outstanding smell deserved of a brandy snifter.  T- Triumphant. Dark chocolate, espresso, vanilla bean and bourbon notes rise like an Italian aria. Deeply kilned and roasted malt are overwhelming, resonant and thunderous, with carefully balanced adjuncts lingering in the finish. I hate to jump on the bandwagon and proclaim this to be the finest imperial stout I've ever tasted, but I have no reason to lie to you.  M- Can the body get any fuller? This beer coats the tongue richly, like chocolate pudding. A splash of CO2 complements its charred-chocolate character, but a nitro tap would improve its consistency to the point of perfection.  D- So bold that I can't call it sessionable. This beer is a meal, one so satisfying that another plate would just be decadent. Drink this like a fine liquor, or digestif, perfect for after dinner. I wish Michael Jackson (the beer critic) could have lived to try this.  On this St. Patricks' day, I am proud to be from Michigan. This is stout ale.

The beer was very dark, virtually black with redish hues and so thick that direct sunlight could not penetrate through.  S-Potent malty-coffee-chocolatey aroma is immediately evident with hints of vanilla, oak and bourbon fighting for their place.  T-Despite the lack of aging, the bourbon is well masked until after the swallow and the heat then reveals itself. The coffee and chocolate flavors meld well together and there is a smooth silkiness throughout the tasting process.  M-Very thick and creamy and the liquor presents itself at the swallow with a slight bitterness and heat which should mellow with aging.  D-Excellent sipping beer. I started at cellar temperature and allowed it to come to room tempature as I sipped and enjoyed this one for over and hour.

1199,19960,Wisconsinality,4.45,"Poured from 12oz bottle into a Chimay chalice.  A- Pours a deep black with minimal light coming in around the edges. The head is pretty typical of this style of beer, barely a cap on it and settles on the edges. There is pretty good lacing left on the side of the glass.  S- Rich dark chocolate with a heavy dose of coffee. A good amount of toasted malt in there as well. The bourbon melds well with the other scents and doesn't take over. When it warms, the oak comes out as well.  T- Dark chocolate with a little bit of coffee and a nice brown sugar in there as well. The bourbon seems to add a smooth undertone to the beer. The alcohol becomes a little more present as the beer warms up. Very nice balance all around.  M- This is a full bodied beer that coats the mouth and provides some bitterness on the tongue and a little bit of a dry finish. You also get a little warming the back of the throat from the alcohol. It has a little more carbonation that some other beers of the style but the thicker mouthfeel makes up for it.  D- This beer is a sipper for sure but it is smooth and rich. I would have no problem having a consecutive glasses of this. I would have to say this is more balanced that the regular Breakfast Stout and not as bold of a coffee flavor. Should be interesting to see what a little bit of age does to this beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,JoEBoBpr,4.52,Served in a oversized wine glass. This beer was expensive man 21.99 for a 4 pack. Still lets see what we got.  A - Pours a gorgeous pitch black oily beer with a nice reddish hues. There is almost no head but a thin little fizzle that leaves a nice ring on the sides of the glass.  S - WOW!! I cant decide were to begin but here goes. First some strong roasted coffee hints are felt. This is followed by some nice rich bitter chocolate notes. Some nice woody notes with hints of vanilla spices and of course some bourbon and alcoholic esters.  T - Ok! I believe this beer is worth the hype. Begins with a nice roasted malt flavor with coffee and some nice caramel sweetness as well. Woody oak flavors a plenty that lead into the Bourbon notes which are very well balanced and not too overwhelming like other Bourbon aged stouts. Chocolate hints a plenty that are well balanced by some nice vanilla bean spices. The woody notes also carry a nice spice to it and there is definitely some alcoholic warmth as the beer goes down. Very delicious.  M & D - Nice oily and creamy mouthfeel with a full body. Nice CO2 balance. Great beer. Drinkability lowered because of ABV but I would definitely have more of this as time goes by.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,TMoney2591,4.36,"Served in a Dogfish Head snifter.  Pours the way a big, bold stout ought to: deep pitch black (or is pitch ""KBS-black""?) with a quarter-finger of burnt sienna head that dissipates into a flat cloud lingering on the surface. A slight bit of sudsily-ringed lacing is left behind. The nose has a seemingly unhealthy amount of wood in it, almost as much as a small forest. There's also some bourbon, maple syrup, molasses, dark roast coffee, and charcoal smoke, making this one of the darkest-smelling brews I have ever had. That said, the coffee, wood, and bourbon o'erwhelm the other notes a bit, leaving me an iota unfulfilled. The taste marks a second manifestation of the nose: heavy wood notes, bourbon, molasses, vanilla, smoke, nutmeg, dark roast coffee, toffee, and a hint of chunky peanut butter. This is a fair improvement on the nose, and leaves very little to be desired. The body is indeed pretty hefty, but not too much so. The low carbonation, thick chewiness, and spitefully smooth feel all lead to a high drinkability, though this brew is clearly not a gulper; rather a highly enjoyable deep-sipper.

S: Nose is of rich roasted malts, coffee, milk chocolate and light hints of bourbon.  T: Taste starts with a touch of caramel sweetness, hints of vanilla and perhaps a touch of dark fruits. Rich prominant coffee flavoring mingled with milk chocolate comes in. Roasted and burnt malts then take over made bitter with some baker's chocolate. Bourbon then begins to creep in ridiculously smooth. Finish is light continued bourbon flavoring mingled back with more coffee notes.

1199,19960,Daniellobo,3.45,"Fair bourbon imperial stout with a charred coffee range.  Presentation: 12 oz brown capped bottle. Light cream and dark brown label, highlighting name of the brew with a small tongue-in-cheek paragraph about what it does not ail, alongside a presiding intro about its acclaimed status. Notes IBUs (70), and Alc. by Vol. (11.2%). Served into a snifter.  A - Black pour with brown edges, nice 1/3"" bubbly brown head, poor retention and lacing with a fair surface memory ring.  S - Prominent coffee nose, burnt coffee that is, riding roasted malts with a mellowing whiff from a boozy bourbon touch on its back.  T- Charred coffee, malty notes with an acidic follow up that is finished with a nice bourbon pull. Uff, this reminds me of my problems with mainstream coffee in the States. Luckily the bourbon and boozy feel does some to rescue the brew from the coffee pits of their Breakfast Stout, although it is close. The acidic coffee note seems to be woven and not helped but enhanced by part of the hop bill. Faint vanilla-oaky notes riding the finishing coat of bourbon as they try to come to the rescue and add some make up to the pig that I have been kissing now for a while. As it warms up completely even a sweet sugary touch emerges. I wonder if some aging will help this a bit as hops subdue in a nice meld, and somehow coffee integrates with some benevolence.  M - Medium-full body with tingly carbonation held around a warm boozy finish with an overall creamy smoothness that unfortunately is hurt by the coffee profile. Otherwise its mouthfeel would be its most redeeming feature.  O - This is not bad but reminds me of ""carajillos"" i.e. mixing black coffee with whisky, cognac or a similar liquor, which is fine for those who like it that way. I typically enjoy the coffee on its own and the liquor sitting right next to it. Plenty of coffee and bourbon aged stouts offer a rich range, which feels like its own enticing brew and not a mix. For me this is not the case...  Notes: Unfortunately this is not for me. It is close to the shortcomings of their Breakfast Stout with an awful coffee offering, which kills the quality of the brew. I´m constantly surprised that this is so popular, but it could be a wrong turn in my palate... It´s like bad quality coffee trying to hide under an aggressive roast. I have chewed coffee grains on several occasions and one can notice the difference in quality, typically a bitter range is prominent but good ones have a nice range and a quality to them that low quality ones often translate as crash and astringent bitterness. This one feels like bad grains... And typically coffee stouts can get away with mediocre beans and average malt roasts if they do it well, let alone using quality stuff that really kicks them up a notch, but this? I really wonder what they are doing and if it is actually quality why it comes out in this manner. I know that very acidic coffees do not agree very well with me so that could be it.  Different brews but pricing, hype and quality considered I´d take Goose Island Bourbon Stout ahead of this any day, or even some underrated brews like say Schlafly Reserve Bourbon Imperial Stout...

1199,19960,OSUBeerStudent,4.75,"Ah, my pretty. I love this beer despite the limited number of bottles I've consumed (around 5-6?).  A - Exactly what it should be. Darker than dark body, teeny tiny mocha head that disappears except for a few lingerers throughout.  S - bourbony chocolatey coffeey goodness. Unlike, say, Black Ops, the bourbon in the nose doesn't waft up the booze. Perfectly balanced between the coffee and bourbon (larger notes), vanilla, oak, roasty malt; that's enough of the description while it's sitting here in front of me.  T - heavenly. A bit of sweetness up front with more of the chocolate, which blends smoothly into coffee and vanilla, oak, a little tiny bit of sweet booze. Then it segues into the bitter coffee and oak, with lingering bourbon notes that keep lingering after swallowing. The coffee is present throughout but blended enough that it doesn't overpower - same goes for the bourbon. The blending with aging (after one of last year's) isn't necessary, but it makes it unimaginably smooth. The blend from sweet chocolate to bitter coffee, all the time underlined with the woody vanilla of the bourbon, is sublime. The best-tasting imperial stout I've ever had, taking the title from Sexual Chocolate, Dark Lord, etc.  M - just right. The carbonation is there in moderation throughout, with a great thickness. This isn't motor oil or Guinness, it's where it should be in between. It would be perfect if the carb was just a tad lighter.  D - amazing. If not for my brain, I could easily down one of these quickly and be really happy. Or I could sip on several over the course of a night. For a bourbony imperial stout over 11%, it just doesn't get any better.  And, in my opinion, it just doesn't get any better among imperial stouts.

Appearance: They say a picture is worth a 1000 words, well pouring this beer into a glass is worth twice that. Exactly how an impy stout should look, beautiful cappuccino head that sits on top of a black hole.  Smell: Great notes of coffee, charred malt, milk chocolate and bourbon. Coffee dominates the nose, but is very pleasant and not overpowering.  Taste: The coffee is very dominant and I think will settle down with some time on it to allow some of the other spectacular flavors to come through. However what amazes me about this beer is just how great of a job Founders does with aging this beer. The bourbon provides a spectacular finish, that is really unequalled in any bourbon aged stout I have had. It really just lets you know it is there with a soft oaky, vanilla finish. KBS whispers bourbon in your ear as opposed to shouting ""HEY THIS IS BOURBON BARREL AGED!"" right in your face compared to some of the other BBA stouts out there.  Mouthfeel: Its like drinking velvet...absolutely perfect.  Drinkability: Easiest to drink impy stout out there that if it wasn't printed on the bottle you would say I was lying if I told you it was over 11% abv. I could easily enjoy multiples of this in one sitting.  I think this is Founders best offering, just a brilliant BBA impy stout.

Gotta give a little bump to the score particularly due to the incredible aroma. I could sniff on this all night. Wow. Appearance also gets a bump and I'm enjoying the reduced booziness from the fresh bottle. One of the best beers I've ever had.

On and on and on and on, adjective upon adjective upon adjective...NOMNOMNOMNOMNOM  ___  12oz bottled Feb 18, 2010. Served cool room temperature into a Duvel tulip.  Pours black, quite thick with a one finger brown head that reduces to a small foamy ring and cap, leaves some spots of lacing.  Aroma is heavy on the wood, nice amount of bourbon, vanilla, strong coffee, some chocolate, a little charred.  Flavor brings in a very good dose of dark chocolate and coffee bitterness, vanilla, bourbon, fair amount of alcohol, especially early in the glass.  Mouthfeel is full, but not overly so, feels like there is oatmeal here, does get a tad sticky, low carbonation.  Overall, for a coffee stout, any coffee influence is generally overshadowed by the charred oak and bourbon. Still excellent impression overall, for my first ever KBS. Never thought I'd see this on store shelves in Georgia, and it's quite a treat. Every single Founders beer I've had has blown me away. This one had the most hype, but lives up to it in every way.

A nice dark brown head forms as mostly lace until a swirl livens it up.  The aroma is strong and boozy, with a slight alcoholic burn. Chocolate and vanilla comes through very clearly. A bit of cinnamon rounds out a boozy, dessert like nose. Bourbon is thankfully in the background.  KBS is very thick, so the first thing I thought of was chocolate syrup. Some burnt sugar, bourbon, vanilla, and ice cream round out a thick, boozy tasting beer. The carbonation is really low, accentuating the creamy mouthfeel of this huge beer. It's not something I would like to have very often, and a half bottle was more than enough. I remember having this fresh last year and was not impressed.

Served in a tulip glass the beer is pitch black with a thick dark tan head that sits at two fingers for at least ten minutes with out moving. The lace is unreal. It clings to the glass throughout the entire drinking experiance. Every sip or swirl leaves a thick coating around the edge of the glass.  The aroma is much more chocolate and roast malt then I had expected. It has a light bourbon feel to it but it's just super smooth and mild.  The flavor is absolutely perfect. One third chocolate one third coffee and one third bourbon. It simple doesn't get any better then this. I simply don't think any one aspect wins out in the battle. It's as if they all decided on a tie. I don't kn ow how founders got all three to play so well with eachother.  Full thick and chewy rich body. Super smooth with hardly any carbonation.

I wish the nose was a tad bit stronger though.  T - the taste follows the nose perfectly. Starts of with some chocolatey coffee. Sandwiched in the middle is a bunch of bourbon, with some vanilla and molasses. KBS Finishes with a sweet milk chocolate. The bourbon is very hot when this is fresh - it reminds me of the time I dumped some makers mark in a stout...it is very stouty and bourbony. Lots of vanilla and spicy bourbon on the exhale. This is complex and well-crafted, but it falls short of what I like in my favorite barrel aged beers...too much bourbon and bot enough supporting malts.  M - medium bodied with some low carbonation - silky smooth as it goes down  D - Breakfast stout taken to a whole new level. The base is still there, however the oaky bourbon really lets this go to a new level. Awesome beer, however the 12% abv limits this one. I guess I was expecting something more here. This didn't wow me like I hoped it would.  I am glad I was able to get my hands on this. Between this and Nemesis coming out a couple of weeks ago, Founders is really rolling them out right now. I feel fortunate to have been able to pick up a couple of bottles of each. I must say that I thought this was a fantastic brew, however when it comes to bourbon barrel stouts BCS is still my favorite. ---  6 mo. update. There is a lot of molasses on the nose.

Smell is heavy on coffee, vanilla, and chocolate. The bourbon comes in nicely, not being overpowering. Some oak in there as well. Nice, complex aroma; I'm sure there's much more I'm not picking up. Taste is some bitter coffee up front, with vanilla and rich, dark chocolate following. The oak and bourbon come in near the finish. Again, the bourbon is fairly subdued, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Alcohol is well-hidden. Mouthfeel is velvety and smooth, yet there is a hint of carbonation that makes it just right. Nice warmth from the alcohol. Very, very drinkable. Excellent, well-balanced taste that isn't too rich or too heavy on the bourbon.

1199,19960,Magpie14,4.88,"This is the '09 on tap at the brew pub  A: a glowing and hazed reddish brown hue permeates with traces of faint mocha swirls sitting on top. A large gathering of shiny bubbles sits hard right in my snifter. A very small amount of lacing exists (considering the ABV), speckled and fading. The body just looks righteous and fit for the name, as noted by the mild bourbon colors resting at the edges when I sip. By far one of the better looking stouts. As far as presentation is concerned all the right elements are here  S: the nose is monstrous. Rich coffee, hearty malts, chocolate, and globs of molasses with some vanilla infused bourbon. The smells listed may seem ordinary for some stouts and whiskey based brews of this sort but the '09 KBS is fairly extraordinary in the nose. Even so, things are starting to smell a little moon-shiny as my journey continues  T: luscious cocoa, heavily roasted and darkened malts, pulverized hazelnut coffee beans, some cured vanilla beans, and a thin slice of fudge cake. I might be a little overzealous about this brew but it really is just that darn good! No if's and or buts! It is a great melding of bitter and sweet while being both smooth and rough. Eventually, after numerous small sips, I find that the bitterness plays between coffee and a burnt sucrose character. Even more amazing is the lack of alcohol on the palate. It drinks so flipping smooth with really no ABV intensity at all. The way this beer moves is top notch  M: the mouthfeel is quite sumptuous and close to velvet on the tongue. It also holds a relatively mild feeling while being so smooth. Just great, absolutely great!  D: 5 stars. I might venture to say that the bourbon is rather subdued (the extra year of age no doubt) but this is not a problem for me. All the right ingredients in this one.

Very bourbon-like up front, with hints of vanilla, and then dark roasted coffee and alcohol. Fat note of chocolate fudge as well.  Flavor is woody and oaky, with a pretty substantial coffee presence, much like the standard Breakfast Stout. Finishes extremely warming and full of roasted bitterness. Kind of sweet overall. The bourbon character is more subdued than I expected, but very nice, with those savory, buttery, and maple-like notes reminiscent of a fine bourbon. Mouthfeel is super thick and rich, though quite drying on the back-end. Very smooth for the alcohol content; however, still only realistically drinkable for the style.  This stout is chock full of flavor, but in the end I find it a bit raw and rough. A big beer that just might be too big.

The head dissipates to just a thin coating on top of the beer but leaves some milky lacing  S: big coffee smells with chocolate and vanilla. very robust i must say  T: Yum! Not nearly as powerful as the smell but there sure is a lot of flavors that are going on but then oddly enough the 3rd taste they all meld together. really really smooth milk chocolate with a robust coffee background touch of vanilla and then i get the oak vanilla from the barrel. mighty tasty. the booze is there but in no way hot.  M: Slick mouth with limited carbonation but at least its there.  D: well i just slammed half the glass just trying to figure out how good it is. i keep wanting another sip. its super smooth and doesn't feel like 11% and i can only imagine how nice it will taste in a year,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,JoePat,4.75,"2009 vintage Pours a pitch black with a small brown head that leaves a good amount of lacing as it dissipates. The smell is heaven. The bourbon, coffee and chocolate all combine into one smell that makes you want to dunk your whole face in the glass. I taste a smooth sourness from the bourbon with bitter sweet chocolate that you notice first as that subsides you taste the coffee and a little heat from the alcohol. The mouth feel is thick and creamy but at the same time light on the tongue. This beer is a big, complex, sweet, sour, bitter, hot, and creamy but it is so good it goes down like candy and it is as drinkable as a 11% RIS aged in bourbon barrels gets.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,SirDrinxAlot,4.45,"Poured like dirty, black,sludgy motor oil. Darkest beer I think I've ever poured. Smell was HEAVY roasted coffee, light chocolate, and very slight booze. Taste is black coffee with a hint of bitter chocolate and light booze hitting in the middle. The bitterness and booze linger a bit in the finish. A rich, full bodied brew. Drinks smooth though and the booze never overpowers the beer. Well balanced. Drinkability is a lot higher than I expected for 11.2% ABV. Glad I had the chance to try it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,AlFromBayShore,4.75,"A- Motor oil with nearly no head. Some bubbles hug the edge of my beer goblet. At first glance it looks black but then you notice it to be a REALLY dark brown - like brown shoe polish mixed with black paint.  S - Chocolate and coffee in a fight to see who wins aroma supremacy. A steady aroma of bourbon maintains a constant presence in this struggle. Picking up some vanilla in the background and some slight coconut notes.  T & M - BOURBON! And then is the vanilla before a finish that reminds me of bittersweet chocolate or is it roasted coffee? I cannot tell. In between all that is something I can't figure out to save my life but its very smooth. Its like what you get when drinking a milk stout but more complex. By the fifth sip, I experience a warming in my chest that rises to the back of the throat. Rich taste with a full body. As it warms, I am getting a nice and complex subtle malt flavor.  D - Savory and tasty - very drinkable.  This beer isn't exactly my cup of tea. I cannot see this beer being one of my go to beers but that doesn't mean it isn't a good beer. I got this on the advice of a salesperson at my local beer boutique. I'm glad I got it. Not sure if I'd get it again though.  POSTSCRIPT: As this beer warms, it attains a chocolatey decadence with a boozy backbone. This does warrant a ""Wow!"" Let this stout warm a bit after taking out the fridge.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,BeerGodz,4.75,"Look: Blackest beer I've ever seen! Medium light brown head with little retention, but great lacing  Smell: Dark roast coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, bourbon.  Taste: Up Front: Espresso, chocolate, vanilla. Finish: Sweet malt, bourbon, roasted malt - absolutely decadent!!!  Mouthfeel: Full body, low/medium carbonation, and very creamy  Drinkability: I did not want it to end, but it would be hard to drink more than one of these  Overall Impression: Another beer that lives up to the hype! Simply amazing across the board. I was expecting more bourbon and less coffee. Regardless, it's one of the greatest Stouts ever!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,BarBEERian,4.87,"Pouring the darkest and heavenliest of all jet blacks that I've ever seen, the Kentucky Breakfast Stout had a thick and dark cream head perched atop the beautiful libation. The smell was unbeatable with a dense aroma of seductive bourbon and dreamy cream. The layers of flavor just in the scent were already enough to make me want this beer on my deathbed.  The taste took multiple sips to even begin to separate all the complex and intriguing flavors that radiated throughout. An initial blast of thick cream, toffee, and burnt brown sugar kicks you in the mouth as a whirlwind of dull-sweet chocolate malt and toasted semi-sweet chocolate dances haphazardly on the tongue. The bitterness up front is well-performed and the booze never becomes overbearing or a note worth forgetting. The bourbon, though, is the outstanding element in this beer. The bourbon flavor arrives early to the party, hangs out strong all night, and doesn't leave until the last cigarette is consumed and the last partier is ready for bed. But he never gets obnoxious or annoying; he's the one you never want to go. The only drawback you can even begin to have with this beer is the density and the complexity-it's almost too much at times. Oddly enough, as the beer warmed, I began to like it a little bit less. This really is one to have slightly chilled to catch every last highlight.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,techfed87,5,"Pours a jet black, with a dark mocha head.  Appearance is onyx black, with no light getting through at all.  Smells of roasted coffee mixed with something darker and more sour.  First sip is deeply chocolate, with the smoothest mix of espresso, all of which has a woody boubon-like after-taste, but man, it's just smooth smooth smooth! Everything's just centered and concentrated and organized into a flavor spectrum that feels like it's all meant to be there in exactly the way it is. Hands down, this is the tastiest beer I've had to date.  Mouthful is huge, with new flavors constantly introducing themselves as you drink it.  Drinkability is frighteningly good. At nearly 12%, it balances the mocha sweetness with its bourbon sour attributes to make my favorite beer to date.  Find this beer. Find it and buy it and enjoy it. It really is that good.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,AgentZero,4.1,"A - Black as night with a small tan head. Not sure if there would have been any lacing, head was barely present in this pour so nothing to really leave any on the sides.  S - Can tell this one has been in the barrel. Very oaky. Coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts. Good stuff.  T - I tend to strongly dislike anything that's overly woody, but I loved it on this beer. The oaked influence comes through softly on the front, but you definately taste it. Fades into a nice mix of chocolate and molassas. Mild coffee comes all the way through. This stuff is fantastic.  M - Full bodied, can feel its weight in your mouth.  D - Can really only do one bottle, pretty manly brew, too heavy to do tons of. Fantastic beer though.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A - Pours pitch black with about a half finger of molasses colored head and leaves a very nice thin ring of foam around the class throughout drinking.  S - Smell is just off the charts with dark roasted coffee, bourbon, wood, malts and a bit of vanilla. I wish Founders could make this into a cologne I would buy truckloads of it.  T - It just explodes with coffee, bourbon, wood, malts with a touch of vanilla, this is just top of the line. If I could only drink 1 beer for the rest of my life this would be it.  M - Creamy and full bodied, it just coats my mouth. Perfect!  D - This just never gets old for me, it hides the 11.2% amazingly well. This is just pefection in bottle.  This is my favorite beer of all time. Founders is just making extraordinary beers and this is on the top of the mountain.

1199,19960,Lunch,4.5,"Served on-tap at EBF 2010 in Boston, MA into a tasting glass at the appropriate temperature (02/20/10).  A: Pours a dark, dark brown nearing black with a nice 1 finger creamy light tan head.  S: Wonderful coffee aroma, similar to Breakfast Stout only enhanced with some sweet, sticky bourbon and some rich cocoa and milk chocolate.  T: Coffee hits the palate first and is quickly followed by a surge of chocolate/cocoa engulfed in bourbon. Really full and rich with great complexity.  M: Full-bodied with fairly low and creamy carbonation with a nice warming bourbon that coats the entire palate quite nicely.  D: With a flavor profile such as this along with the fact that the 11.2% abv. is completely masked, this is a dangerously drinkable Imperial Stout.  Overall this beer certainly lived up to its hype for me and is yet another expertly crafted Imperial Stout from Founders. Highly Recommended.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,jcnd9803,5,"A: A motor oil slick look with no head but incredible lacing.  S: A wonderful mix of vanilla, bourbon and coffee.  T: Just an amazing flavor! The taste mirrors the smell. The alcohol is there, but it's really smooth.  M: Three words: thick, chewy and creamy.  D: For such a big beer, it's amazingly drinkable. For it's heat and thickness, I would reach for another one after drinking one, it's that good.  For me, this is the gold standard of beer. I've had at least 35 of the top 100, and I would take this before any other beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The smell is a bit toasty at first, with some nice chocolate flavor that jumps out front. Some nice bourbon flavor kicks at the aroma and really pushes at the nose.  The taste is heavy bourbon stout flavor with some roasty flavor that feels like a nice biscuit flavor that was burnt in the toaster.  The feel of this beer is a bit heavy for a beer I expected to have some mellow flavor but was kicked hard. A bit of a heavy feel going down but a great tasting beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S: Big aroma of bourbon, molasses, brown sugar, bittersweet chocolate, roasted coffee, faint grassy hops, raisiny dark fruit. Very complex and well balanced.  T: I give this beer a perfect 5 on taste because of the balance of the flavors. All the flavors found in the nose but they are all so perfectly balanced and integrated into the flavor profile. So incredibly well rounded, full bodied and delicious!  M: Heavy mouthfeel with wonderful carbonation that lifts the heaviness off the tongue and makes the flavors jump on your palate. Very balanced as I previously stated, adding to the mouthfeel and slightly creamy.  D: Tough to give a high drinkability for an 11.2% beer but this is pretty drinkable. Smooth, creamy and not an ounce of harshness from the booze or bitterness.

Smells of brewed coffee, cocoa, chocolate cake, and alcohol. The flavor is much more rich than the aroma, with loads of cocoa, fresh coffee, chocolate ice cream, chocolate cake batter, cookie dough, an opulent warming spicy finish. Chewy thick and warming with low to moderate carbonation. The nice flavor and fantastic finish make this an easy drink despite its strength. Definitely a great stout and I would lavish it with more praise, but I will reserve that for my love affair with Canadian Breakfast Stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Iceman77,4.72,"I should mention first that this is the '09 KBS, i've had one bottle laying around for a while and realized i never reviewed it. It is probably the most opaque stout i've seen, just a deep rich black with very minimal head despite a vigorous pour (probably due to age). The aromas are as complex as most beers' taste, you get a heavy roasted malt with the sweetness of chocolate, vanilla and coffee, and also a faint hint of the bourbon in the background. All of those flavors come back in the taste, just a wonderful melding of everything a good stout should be. The mouthfeel is very nice as well, there's almost three stages as an upfront, a mouth coating and then an aftertaste, each with a seemingly different effect on the flavor. The only thing that keeps me from rating the drinkability higher is the abv, i've made the mistake of drinking a KBS later in a sesh and it's basically put me to sleep. Definitely worth the hype and praises, this Founders offering stands right at the top of the imperial stout class.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The carbonation is hidden in the blackness but shows up when taking a sip. Smells of big coffee notes and bourbon. Very roasty as well. The coffee just smells fantastic. Would love to know what they used in the beer. One of the best noses on a stout that I've had. Taste is coffee and roasty flavors initially. The bourbon makes its presence known more as it warms up. Slightly sweet with vanilla, bourbon, and oak making their presence known too. Medium to full bodied with good carbonation. Very easy drinking.  Just a great beer to sip over the course of an hour or so and see all the flavors develop and change. I feel it's best a bit fresher when the bourbon presence is felt more.

KBS just sounded like a perfect way to start the cold night off, and it's my first KBS ever as well.  Pours black as can be in the dark, and just as black when held up to the candle light. Not much head to speak of but left a little lacing on the glass as I drank it.  Aroma has bitter coffee, chocolate with a little more subtle wood, vanilla, and Bourbon coming through. Very appealing and complex nose.  The taste is very heavy on the bitterness with a lot of coffee, chocolate, and roasted grains coming through. The bourbon also comes through very well and compliments the other flavors, but isn't overpowering. As in the nose the oak and vanilla are a little more subtle then the other flavors, but add a nice complexity to the beer.  Mouthfeel is thick and carbonation is low, pretty much what I would expect from this style. Very drinkable and delicious, I could use a few more of these tonight to warm me up.  Overall an excellent beer. Breakfast stout is already an amazing beer and the barrel aging really adds to it in this case making it more complex and delicious.

A 2009 bottle poured into my DFH signature glass. This is my second time having this beer, and the first time i was a little disappointed. My feelings this time are much different.  A: Somehow old used motor oil looks very appealing. This definitely looks the part, though with a very very small dark khaki head.  S: Chocolate, coffe, and a caramel/vanilla bourbon scent. This is one of the best smelling beers i can recall. I get those smells in a different order almost every time, they mix really well together.  T: Bourbon hits as soon as it touches my tongue. This is followed by the all so familiar coffee and chocolate mix that makes me love breakfast stout so much. Not much of a surprise here, the taste pretty much follows the smell, which is a good thing. Again the bourbon, coffee, burt malts, chocolate and hints of caramel and vanilla all mix together for an amazing brew.  M: Full bodied, creamy, and still very well carbonated.  D: Goes down very easy, i could drink a few easily. I only have one more left, damn Founders for leaving SC!

The flavor profile is very similar to the aroma. Coffee and bitter chocolate lead the parade. Alcohol presence is strong but bourbon flavor could have been so much more IMHO. Vanilla, licorice and burnt sugar add to the robust flavor. The finish is long and dry and full of roasted coffee.  THe feel falls short of perfection due to the slight lack of body. Lower spectrum of carbonation, very smooth and slicky but unfortunately just a tad too thin.

1199,19960,crossovert,4.78,"THe Amazing Kosmicki's Highly Acclaimed KBS. I'm popping it in celebration of completion of my winter term finals, and appropriately, for breakfast. Served lightly chilled. 09 vintage thanks to scubarex, unfortunately with the twist off, but it is only a year old so im not worried about oxidation. I can smell this one even with the cap on.  Pours into my orange juice glass a dense pitch black with hints of ruby/brown at the extreme edges of the glass. The thick, liquid looks like motor oil as it exits the bottle. The creamy cocoa/tan head is thick and creamy and about a finger thick. It dissipates within a minute leaving behind a frosting of lacing one the sides of the glass and a foamy layer above the beer. Looks tasty.  The smell is bursting with a large hit of coffee with some chocolatey notes and a nice kick of bourbon. The bourbon lends some nice malty scents and a touch of woody vanilla. Unlike the FBS this oen doesn't have any sign of hops on the nose.  This beer is thick and intoxicating. The bourbon takes center stage in the taste, much like a BCS but with a leveling amount of coffee that balances out the beer immensely. The oak and vanilla also make a larger appearance and taste delightful, creating a breakfast stout above the others. THE hops make their presence in the after taste with a tiny hint of citrus, that is one of the main tings that makes this brew so amazing, its subtleties. The coffee, alcohol, and hops linger in the back of the throat while creamy, chocolatey malt lingers in on the tongue and roof of the mouth. The biitterness is perfect and the alcohol and sweetness aren't overt or cloying.  The mouthfeel is right on in my opinion, it is lightly carbonated, but not under carbonated. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy without being over the top.  This is a monster of a stout, though I'm not a coffee fan the flavor in this beer just explode on the palate and mingle with each other perfectly thus creating a highly delectable beer for my palate.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Beerkovich,5,"I really should start reviewing more beers on here....I'm embarrassed that I have not reviewed this one yet. It may not help my credibility when I deal out another A+, but maybe that's my small role on here, to only comment when a beer moves me enough to write about it at 1:26 a.m., months after I last had it. I did take notes on one of my KBS/CBS tastings, but I'm not about to dig for them now.  Who cares--just read the other reviews if you want to hear words like 'vanilla,' 'coffee,' 'chocolate,' or 'bourbon.' You'll find plenty. But the main point I'd like to drive home is that this beer is very much an uncanny result larger than the sum of its parts. Those descriptors just do not quite do it justice.  This beer is right behind Vanilla Bean Oak Aged Dark Lord for my favorite beer of all time. I must give it a perfect 5 score, based on that sentence. This beer goes above and beyond, it raises the bar for american and international brewing, and on top of it all, it has no flaws.  Even the drinkability/mouthfeel. You would THINK that perhaps it might be a bit too rich, or syrupy, or sweet, or bourbony, or alcoholic, since other beers of this style are (Goose Island BCS). But this beer defies reason. When a buddy of mine drove us out to Founders, I drank three of them. Ravenously. It's surprisingly drinkable. I'm not sure if it's the coffee or what, but there is a difficult-to-describe ""mineral"" quality about the beer that ""cools and dries"" all the warm, decadent flavors. Perhaps it's the fact that the beer is supposedly aged in barrels under the earth in some kind of mine? I swear someone from Founders told me this in an email, unless I'm insane. This could be the explanation, as barrels are porous. If so, this is not unlike the way Islay scotch whiskey picks up a briny character from being aged near the sea breeze. Whether I dreamt this or not, maybe it's an idea for brewers to explore. I don't know.  Please try to discover Kentucky Breakfast Stout, no matter what it takes. I think they release the new vintage on or around St. Patrick's Day. Additionally, I think they tap a keg of it once a month, and it probably lasts about a week. Grand Rapids, MI.

It was as dark and rich looking like used motor oil with a visibly viscous texture. The collar of brown foam was thin, the retention rather weak but the lacing quite good. The aroma was of coffee, chocolate, wood, alcohol, molasses and whiskey. The flavors offered all of the above along with tar, pine sap, leather, bourbon (specifically because of the sweetness as opposed to just generic whiskey), hints of dark fruit and burnt coffee and burnt bread. Despite the bourbon influence the alcohol was well blended in. The mouthfeel was rich but not heavy, the body medium/full and the carbonation perfect. Smooth, complex, demanding, gratifying and surprisingly drinkable. One of the finest beers I have ever enjoyed and absolutely deserving of every praise that is heaped upon it.

This was bourbon right off, followed by chocolate and vanilla. Finishes with some more slight bourbon flavor and coffee that fades beautifully.  First thought is how smooth this is across my tongue and the creaminess that fills my mouth. Very little carbonation thought my only real bad thought on this. It's almost like drinking a really nice complex bourbon/scotch.  When I think about drinking this I could see myself sitting back and enjoying a few of these through out the night, sipping at my glass as it slowly disappears.

1199,19960,Walken,4.67,"Founders: Kentucky Breakfast Stout (Vintage: 2009) (Tasted 01/24/10) 12 oz. Bottle, poured into a snifter.  Appearance: Black as sin, the head starts as a one millimeter covering of bubbles and fades down into a perfect reproduction of the cloud cover from Van Goghs ""Starry Night"" on top of the beer with a crown of bubbles around the edges. No lacing, but this puppy does have some nice legs! Odor: The nose is well layered and bursting with aroma. Bourbon and oak on top, layer of nutty, earthy coffee and bittersweet chocolate roast notes way in back. Consistency: Akin to a full bodied coffee, in that there is a distinctive feeling of heftiness to this beer, but it doesn't feel extremely viscous of syrupy. Oak, roast and coffee keep the body in check, offering some astringency, carbonation is low, just enough to lend a creamy feel. Taste: I love it when a beer has a knockout aroma and the flavor exceeds it. The layering hinted at in the aroma is very different. Coffee flavors run a little darker while maintaining the nutty richness, chocolate flavors are on the sweeter side than advertised, like dark chocolate fudge brownies. Bourbon, oak and vanilla are an afterthough, though they flourish in the finish. Either this beer doesn't show it's strength or the bourbon barrel flavors mask it completely. Finish is malt and adjunct driven, flavors fade, last-in, first-out, leaving a nice subtle bourbon flavor on the tongue.

The flavor is rather sweet with lots of coffee and bourbon character. The body is not as full as I had thought it would be, but the mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. The chocolate is more pronounced in the taste than in the smell. Notes of woody bourbon, powdered chocolate, lots of vanilla, oak and roasted malts. Hints of licorice and fudge. Perhaps a note of tar. The finish is bitter and has a nice warming feeling to it.  All in all, surprisingly balanced. Not the big bourbon bomb I thought t would be.

Flavor at cellar temperature was a nice subtle blend of vanilla, bourbon, roasted coffee beans, and a touch of hops. As it warmed the bourbon and vanilla flavors got to be very intense, probably too much. I had a tough time rating this one. At cellar temp, the beer was wonderfully balanced, but once it warmed, the bourbon barrell flavor just overpowered everything else. NOTE: Re rated 8/27/06. Tap.

1199,19960,backfat,4.03,"hello, my name is Dave and I am 24 years old. my beer drinking days began when i was in high school. my first beer was a warm Budweiser on a beach at the outer banks. i decided i hated beer. later that day we drank cold MGD's next to a fire and my opinion started to change. after choking down 4, i was lit.... and hooked i guess. i was a pretty typical drinker on a college budget so i drank my fair share of hamm's and PBR. i even got a keystone light tattoo when i turned 19 on a bet (no joke). i still think it's funny but probably won't a couple years down the road. about four years ago, i was at a local watering hole called chumley's. i was in an adventurous mood, so i decided to jump out of my safe beer bubble and try something called three Floyd's Robert the Bruce. it's a Scottish ale made right in the state i live in, Indiana. 'wow, this doesn't taste like beer' i thought, not realizing the numerous things wrong with that sentence. slowly i began to fall in love with the hop and everything that comes with it. Then it was ambers and browns. Then my obsession with IPA's and stouts and barley wines and then imperial stouts and IPA's. I've come a long way, and i'm sure my beer journey has just begun, but one thing is sure... i love beer, and THIS is the best one i have EVER had.  EDIT: I wrote this review over a year and 1/2 ago, and I would like to adjust it. The 2009-2010 KBS that I have tried were in all actuality, the best beers I have ever had. The way the vanilla and the oakiness of the bourbon barrel merged with the vanilla and almost malted milk ball like flavor was hard to top. Now that I have an opportunity to try the 2011, I must adjust my score. It seems to have a roasted coffee dominance that clashes with the high alcohol presence and over carbonation. Will adjust the score accordingly next year. Not horrible. Toffee just isn't my favorite flavor.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,NCBeerFan,4.97,"I had this for the first time earlier this year and at the time thought it might've been the best beer I'd ever had. I've since had a few that have given it a run for it's money, but thanks to a few excellent trades, I've got my hands a few more bottles and have decided to see how it stands up now.  Poured into a DFH snifter, opaque black with a very thin head which quickly dissipated into small brown bubbles. Smell is outstanding with salient aromas of bourbon, oak, dark chocolate, and vanilla. Taste is well-balanced and follows the aroma closely, although the bourbon isn't quite as noticeable. Has a silky smooth mouthfeel, almost like liquid chocolate. Goes down very smooth, with a noticeable boozy, chocolaty presence, which lingers for awhile.  This is undoubtedly one of my favorite brews and I'm anxiously awaiting it's arrival in a few months. Great job Founders!!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,k3n,4.33,"2008 vintage.  Thick, viscous black. A vigorous pour gives me an inch of dense head, which quickly retreats down to a thin sheet with patchy spots. Minimal lacing. No light intrudes the body, and the color stays evenly black all the way to the edges.  Nose is roasted coffee and booze. Bitter chocolate in the background.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly light. The flavors are intense but the feel of the beer is relatively light. Flavors follow the aromas, roasted coffee beans, bitter chocolate, roasted malts, and some alcohol heat. Finish is moderately long.  Halfway down the glass, I'm continuing to be impressed by the mouthfeel of this beer. There's a definite heft and creaminess to it, but it doesn't get over-bearing. Also, unlike other barrel-aged stouts I've had, the bourbon aspect is quite mellow, and doesn't crowd out the rest of the beer. A+ for drinkability.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,AdmiralDiaz,4.7,"Poured from 12oz.bottle to pint.  A: Pours molasses black with a big brown head with decent retention and some web-like lacing.  S: Smells of strong bourbon, alcohol, roasted malts and some coffee with a very melded chocolate and vanilla note. Smells amazing. What's interesting is that the smell is fairly mild, not in an non-complex way, just a can't smell from a foot away like some beers. Not a bad thing, just not a trait you often see...I mean smell.  T: Strong bourbon with chocolate notes. Coffee kicks in on the finish, however it's complimented by bitter oakiness. This is amazing. It's complex but not as ""extreme"" as GI GCS, which I like because that helps the drinkability factor.  M&D: Good carbonation and a heavy body are great, but what really impressed my is the mouth-drying bitter feeling you get. The mouthfeel blew me away, I've never had anything like it. It's pretty drinkable for the abv content and it's not too heavy. I could probably do a couple bottles.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A-Black with a little little tan head that fades quickly but sticks to the glass  S-Coffee and a hint of bourbon  T-Coffee, lots of chocolate and some bourbon. Not nearly as much bourbon as expected but a very nice balance.  M-Smooth, nice low carbonation.  D-Way too drinkable! Not as much bouron as I was expecting. Could it have faded with the months in the cellar? Probably not.  A good beer and would like another, but probably won't seek it out via trades.

Lacing is fairly light.  S - So much going on here! Notes of black coffee and dark chocolate jump out, accentuated by notes of bourbon and maybe a pinch of anise.  T - Smooth notes of vanilla and roasted malt sweetness quickly give way to sharp bitter notes of chocolate and coffee. Plenty of spicy bourbon notes in the finish. Some alcohol tries to poke through, but ultimately remains hidden for the most part. The bold bitter notes of chocolate, coffee, and bourbon linger on the palate.  M - Full-bodied and very rich. Carbonation is low, the better to bring out the bold flavors.  D - Very easy to drink despite the high abv.

S: Smells very well balanced. Coffee, oatmeal, and oak scents eminate from the glass. Smells delicious!  T: Awesome balance! Just like the smell, the coffee and oak flavors are balanced perfectly! Coffee hits you up from first and almost a caramel type flavor on the backend from the oak and bourbon. Is not one bit hard to drink and very complex flavors! Not many brewers get that right.  M: Fantastic cabonation  D: Despite the complexity of this brew, not one aspect is overpowering so it goes down surprisingly easy.  All in all, this brew is fantastic.

1199,19960,MysterySwirl,2.65,"Opening a 2009 - this beer is opaque black with little head and a strong coffee flavor. Smells charred and bitter as if they burnt the coffee before putting it into the barrel.  This one tastes more chocolate-y and bourbon like. The vanilla notes are much more muted this year than the previous years and I honestly prefer the extra vanilla's presence. Not really complex flavor but decent mouthfeel. Honestly, I enjoyed the aroma more than the taste bc I could pick out the sweet/fruit notes better that way.  This beer isn't that complex. Maybe I've been spoiled - maybe it's not aging well with the bourbon notes mellowing and bringing out the coffee... I just know that it didn't live up to my expectations.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,semihobo,4.39,"Picked up one bottle of KBS in March for $6.49 (I believe this is currently a personal $ per oz record, unfortunately), drinking it now for no particular reason. 12 ozer in a chalice.  Very little head that quickly subsides to nothing. Black, black, black. No ""ruby highlights"" or anything, just black. Cool wild west medicine-style label design.  Smells of cocoa and cold-brewed coffee. Bourbon smell is subdued, beautifully smoky and peaty. No smell of alcohol.  Surprisingly smooth. Chocolate and coffee are understated, nothing too over the top or one-note. More like very strong coffee than the char you see in many imperial stouts. The bourbon emerges toward the finish and is gently smoky. Some vanilla phenols go well with cocoa. These have to be the least-noticed 70 IBUs ever. They provide some bittering but hardly play a dominant role. Alcohol is well-masked, although the fact that the beer has the bourbon flavor helps -- an alcohol burn would feel totally appropriate. Finish is nice and bitter, equal parts hops and coffee.  Very low carbonation, moderately heavy body, both appropriate to style. Slightly oily finish.  An excellent beer, both in general and within the style. Must acquire more...",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S: Bourbon on the first smell. Roasty malts, chocolate and coffee when I go back in for more.  T: A little bourbon on the front end, then the chocolate and roasted malts come in. This one does end with a nice little burn to it. Not too much though. I found this to be pretty well balanced looking at the ABV coupled with the barrel aging.  M: Full bodied and low carb. Not surprising for style.  D: This one is a heavy hitter but surely enjoyable. Has mellowed a little since my last taste in March 2009. Very good I would say great stout overall.

1199,19960,webmanspidey,4.72,"Decided to review this again after having it a few times. This was a 12 oz. bottle of the 2009 ""KBS"" variety poured into a chalice.  Thick, black, creamy, and opaque. In appearance, essentially everything you could expect from a stout.  Smells of bourbon, vanilla, maple syrup, coffee, and dark chocolate.. probably one of the best beer smells I've experienced.  The flavor is very sweet up front, again with that mix of vanilla, bourbon, and coffee. Alcohol makes its presence known, but for 11%+ this is drinkable as hell.  The first time I tried this I didn't quite buy into the hype, but now I am a believer. This is one of the best all-around beers I've tried.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,auroracrisis,4.55,"Had a couple of glasses of this last night at The Chase Tap Room in Lexington. It was great to finally see something this rare go on tap in this town and I am hoping it happens more often.  Pours a smooth, deep black with a one finger head that dissipates after the first sip into a small brown ring around the edges of the snifter.  The smell was absolutely intoxicating. Lots of bourbon and coffee notes blended together in perfect unison. The smell of this beer doesn't get any weaker as you drink either, it just keeps jumping out of the glass and up your nose as you drink down your glass.  The taste is smoothed out bourbon with lightly roasted coffee. There is great balance in the taste which could have been due to the age of the keg (being 8 or so months old) but I am pretty sure it's like this fresh as well (from what I can remember it being like out of the bottle months ago). Absolutely delicious and pretty much the definition of balance in a bourbon stout.  Mouthfeel is excellent. Smooth until the last drop with minimal carbonation which causes the beer to go down much faster than it should at such a high abv.  Drinkability is dangerously good. I had two glasses of it in about an hour and had to tell myself to slow down so I didn't get too intoxicated.  Overall, this is probably one of my favorite beers of all time and I am glad I finally had the chance to try this on tap and have a couple glasses as well. Well done, Founders!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,caskstrength,4.7,"2009 KBS bottle. And a few 2010s too.  Total blackness, just a trace of head. Worried already about carbonation. Newer bottles with more carbonation.  Smell is exactly what I was expecting. Coffee richness with some boozy bourbon.  Taste is as the smell predicts. Thicker, boozier version of breakfast stout with heaps of bourbon mixed in. But not much else. I was hoping for some unexpected complexity, but it didn't really show up. But who cares. This beer is not about unexpected complexity. This beer is about coffee/alcohol/bourbon, and it's about coffee/alcohol/bourbon done right.  Mouthfeel is thick and appopriate enough for the flavors and style and abv.  Met expectations, which were pretty high. Deserves it's ranking. A beer I would always like to have around.

The head is very disappointing as there is none and after finally pouring a medium tan head fizzles for seconds and is gone. There is no lacing.  The aroma is very strong but dominated by mostly roasted coffee. There is not much complexity as you get a little alcohol but that's it.  The taste is like the aroma but stronger. Its all coffee but bad stale and bitter coffee. Its simple without any complex flavors. At the end there is a little bourbon and charred wood.  The feel is ok but the drinkability is really down.  I was very excited to finally get my hands on this, but after I did I came away very disappointed.

Every sniff brings more of that wonderful coffee and bourbon aroma with all the subtle scents you would associate with those smells. Bitter chicory, vanilla, caramel, wine, nuts, oak, and slight amount of black pepper are all in there. I could smell this 24/7 and never get tired of it; they should make a cologne that smells like this.  Taste is slightly sweet and full of smooth coffee and bourbon flavor.

However, it was early afternoon by that point...  Received this one in a trade with brewCzar - thanks for the hook-up!  Poured into a Westvleteren chalice. Very little head with just a hoola-hoop of tan foam. Very dark and viscous with a small amount of nice lace.  The smell of this thing almost knocked me over at first. It took me quite a while to place the specific coffee smell in there but I finally got it. When you've left your pot of coffee on the fire in hunting camp all day, all of the water has evaporated, you just have that ""sludge"" at the bottom...if you've ever stuck your nose in there, then you know what I'm talking about. That deep, strong, coffee sludge smell. There's also a bit of vanilla and some dark cherries in there as well, but the hunting camp sludge is out in front - and it is wonderful!  So much more impressed with the taste of this than I remember! As anticipated, I got smacked with a lot of coffee on the front, but this beer is much more complex than that. The chocolate in the middle was very pronounced as well...almost a milk chocolate as opposed to dark. By the third drink, I was stuck on the bourbon taste - right there on the back of the tongue. This was probably the most impressive part of the beer. The bourbon was very strong, but in a very positive way - it really stuck with me long after I'd finished the drink. If you like bourbon, I have full confidence that you will be impressed with the way it is incorporated in this brew! The beer was not alcoholic either - impressively smooth.  This beer is nearly as thick as it looks. It coats the mouth and lingers around long after the beer is gone. Outstanding.  Overall, I was extremely impressed with the KBS. I have six more sitting in my basement and look forward to keeping those around for a few years. Definitely a beer that I'll always have on hand!

The alcohol is definitely there, but it's not quite as boozy as I was preparing for.  M: This is a great thick, chewy, creamy beer.  D: The drinkability is surprisingly good for such a strong beer.

Not a bit of light shines through this one- and I was really looking for it, too. A small dark brown head doesn't stick around long, leaving spotty lacing. As I swirl it in the glass I can see brown, boozy legs slowly sliding down the sides.  Smell is all bourbon and vanilla up front. As it warms I get lots of caramel and chocolate, and finally after searching long and hard I finally picked out a bit of the coffee. I now understand that this isnt FBS from a bourbon barrel- I am dealing with a completely different animal.  Taste starts off tremendously sweet with chocolate and vanilla, finished off with a slight bitter roasted flavor from the coffee. The coffee really helps to balance this one out, but it is certainly not at the forefront. The bourbon heat gives it a nice kick on the finish. I dig this one a lot.  Nice smooth mouthfeel. Minimal carbonation makes this one slick and oily, and the bourbon warmth coats my palate with each sip. It could use a bit more carbonation, but nonetheless it was still a joy to sip on for an hour or so.

It does cover the sides of the glass with a thick alcoholic residue.  The smell is a mixture of the tastes. Bourbon and alcohol are overwhelming smells. Chocolate and coffee and small hints of vanilla. Dark fruits, sweet plumbs mostly. Bourbon overtakes everything.  The taste is fairly hot. Bourbon just takes the stage and steals the show. Coffee flavors are not as present as I wanted them to, chocolate is also a very large character. The chocolate in this is more sweet bakers chocolate rather than earthy chocolate malt flavor. The bourbon is not smooth like Bourbon County, it is a bit more rough on the palate and interferes with some of the other flavors. When it warms up to room temperature the vanilla character comes out.  The mouthfeel is great because I personally love a bourbon mouthfeel, hot and intense. The drinkability is good, but the ABV can be tasted. I would easily drink 4 of these in a sitting and love it. A great Winter brew.

No fresh date to be found.  Pours like dirty motor oil with a similar viscosity. Creamy dark-tan head sits atop the tar pit.  The beer smells awesome! Best aroma on a beer I had dipped my nose into in quite some time. Tons of chocolate, like the innards of a nestle quick powder container. Tons of wood in there. Some roast, and charred marsh mellow.  The beer is as full bodied as one gets, fluffy, with a slickness that coats the palate.  Lots of chocolatey sweetness up front with a flavor of malted milk balls, black coffee, burnt sugars, some earthy flavors most likely from the oak aging. Finishes with the dryness of a burnt marshmellow and black coffee.  Great Imperial Stout, seriously delicious, seriously potent.

1199,19960,Mistofminn,4.65,"This bottle courtesy of seanpacheffda. Thanks for this awsome extra!  2009 bottle with the ""KBS"" label. Poured into my Suly tulip. Bery dark brown on the pour, but in the glass it looks jet black. About a finger of dark mocha colored head, which fades into a thin layer and leaves some splotches of lacing.  The nose is a complex combination of bourbon, oak, bitter chocolate, coffee, milk chocolate and vanilla, tabacco and a nice roasty character. Very nice nose.  The taste is initially very strong on the coffee and bourbon notes. Vanilla, chocolate and oaky characters come in after the initial bourbon wave. A very nice warming presence. Light bitter taste that sits on your tongue after you swallow. So complex and so tasty, this is very impressive. Another huge upside is that this isn't anywhere near as hot as I thought it was going to be, the alcohol is very well hidden.  Mouthfeel is full and thick, it coates your mouth. Creamy and smooth with an appropriately low carbonation. Very nice. Drinkability is very impressive also. Sip and savor this one.  I'm extremely fortunate and glad to get a chance to try this mammoth of a beer. It completely deserves it's stature among the best in the world. I would really love to try an older bottle to see the differences and changes with this beer. Thanks, Sean for the chance!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,beertooth,4.32,"I decided to crack a 2009 vintage bottle tonight to see how it's aging. 12oz bottle poured into a goblet.  This beer is very dark brown to black with a finger of very silky chocolate milk colored head. The head fades into a thin layer and leaves very spotted lacing.  The nose is full of coffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and baker's chocolate. It smells delicious!  The first sip hits me with coffee and bourbon. I'm actually getting a lot more bourbon in this now than when it was fresh. The vanilla and chocolate come next and are rounded out with some oaky tannins and alcohol. There's a slight bitter finish that lingers in between sips. The alcohol isn't hot, but it is warming.  Mouthfeel is full and creamy with low carbonation, but I wouldn't say it's slick.  One of the best imperial stouts out there and a must try if you haven't already. I can't wait for the next release.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

When I first started pouring I thought it was flat, but some carbonation did show up after all.  S = Vanilla, oak, chocolate powder, some mustiness (not as in an off way) but more of the nice smell of an unused, clean attic, even some hints of dark fruits, plums, dark cherries.  T = Wow! The bourbon tastes are still in there in force, also very strong flavors of chocolate and vanilla, some woody oak, and also still some of those fruits I picked up in the nose but much more subdued given the wealth of flavors up front.  M = A truly exceptional mouthfeel, full bodied, great mouthcoating, frothy, luscious, creamy. Just excellent!  D = A little strong in strength of flavor and burn to rate perfectly in drinkability. You don't just want to quaff this. On the other hand, it is really good, I really want to keep taking each sip and look forward to the next time.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,boostsr20,4.9,"Slightly chilled poured into a snifter.  Appearance: Deep black. The head was roughly an inch thick with a caramel coffee coloration. Left a thick lacing behind as well as a ""stained"" look on the empty glass.  Smell: This beer has an invigorating smell that is remeniscent of espresso beans with a hint of Bourbon.  Taste: A seemingly complex taste for a stout. The beer has a bourbon laced coffee taste. It is malty and sweet with a smooth taste of bourbon/vanilla. The alcohol can easily be sensed from the first drink making it a nice beer to savor. Took me about 35 minutes to finish the first one.  Mouthfeel: It has a nice thick coating feeling which leaves every taste bud tingling and exploring for ever note of the beer. Surprisingly has an alcohol type burn similar to a shot of bourbon.  Drinkability: Like I said, it took me 35 minutes to drink one but this isn't a beer that was meant to be devoured immediately. It seems to mature the longer it sits in your glass so patience is rewarded. Overall drinkability is very good.  Was served out of a bottle. I recently talked with a Founders Rep and he stated they have it on tap currently. I'm going to try and hurry in for some. I guess they also have some great habanero beer.

The beer is black and lets no light through.  Smell: Amazing, so strong I can smell it 2 feet away. Strong delicious coffee, Dark chocolate, deep roasted malt, faint sweet plum, and a small amount of toffee.  Taste: Strong coffee like the smell, nice roasted malt flavor, sweet malt, plum flavor is more prevalent in the taste than smell, some sweet oaky and bourbon flavors, dark bitter chocolate. The flavors are combined so nicely, I can only imagine what a few more months would do to this beer!!  Mouthfeel: Thick body, very smooth with a nice, but small, amount of carbonation, a little sticky sweet, leaves mouth with a nice roasted dry feel and a little bit sticky. Very little alcohol burn, especially considering the ABV on it.  Overall: Amazing drinkability!! So many huge aromas in the smell, it made me think this would be difficult to finish... until I tasted it. Despite the huge coffee flavor and roasted malt this beer is so smooth!! The sweet character combined with the bitter roasted/coffee/chocolate flavors and oaky bourbon keep me very interested. Quite complex and smooth... just what I was hoping for!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,sjccmd,4.7,"Not sure how old this bottle since I randomly came across it...I know it's not fresh...there was the tiniest ""tss"" sound when I opened it which made me think it might have lost it's carbonation...  This beer pours a thick jet black. It gloops nicely into the glass. With a vigorous pour there is initially no head whatsoever, but it eventually erupts briefly into a small dark tan head and recedes relatively quickly. Nice lacing that doesn't seem to budge.  Strong smell of oak and a smokiness that was also present in the regular breakfast stout. Espresso, chocolate, and bourbon combine in a way that's reminiscent of a coffee liqueur. Heat from the alcohol is nice and not overpowering.  Rich...very rich...the taste goes a long with the smell with more bitter chocolate and dark roasted coffee. It sort of expands in the finish with the oak and smoky flavors.  Thick and oily with very little carbonation, smooth and not cloying...the flavor slowly erupts and lingers with a very long finish  For the ABV it's very drinkable, the bourbon is not over the top and it's very rich and thick. Even though I wouldn't guzzle this beer, I don't exactly feel the need to call it a ""sipper""  Founders has really perfected balance with this beer. All of the flavors are pretty evenly represented. Nothing is too much or too little. I think the bourbon flavors could have been easily over the top for me since I'm not really a hard liquor fan, but it's evenly balanced with coffee and chocolate.

1199,19960,Yooperduder,3.83,"Purchased in a 4 pack of bottles.  Beer pours with some viscosity and little head. What head there is dissipates quite quickly.  Smells delicious, caramel, malt, chocolate with a hint of hops.  Initial taste has some bite, but mellows out quickly. Definite biscuit, chocolate with a silky smooth finish. No real strong aftertaste, ends up surprising clean. Feels quite nice, low on the carbonation a bit but not too shabby!  A drinkable beer without a doubt.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Reneejane,4.3,"This was poured on tap into a snifter glass. The beer was black wtih a brown head. The head was big and fabulous. There was a definite chocolate aroma (which is a bit of a surprise). The taste was super chocolately and you could feel the bourbon barrel but not overwhelmingly so. The alcohol was noticeable and had a bit of a bite on the tongue (I imagine before aging it might have had a lot more bite!) Drinkability... I never know how to rate drinkability on a high ABV beer, it's drinkable, yes, only to a point!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,nickd717,4.4,"Bottle shared by Arbitrator, labeled as KBS (I heard this is due to a similar legal problem that caused Kentucky Fried Chicken to be called KFC). If lawyers have their way, we'll be speaking in all acronyms before too long. Anyway, this beer owns something fierce, almost but not quite eqaul to the legendary Canadian Breakfast Stout.  A - Pours a viscous, oily jet black with a small, creamy tan head that leaves a ring around the glass. This has legs like a Swedish bikini model, i.e. they're very good.  S - Aroma is coffee, roast, chocolate, and high-quality Kentucky bourbon.  T - Coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt that adds a little sweetness, vanilla, oak, and of course loads of bourbon. Not too much though. Almost but not quite as good as Goose Island Bourbon County Stout. A little boozy, but certainly not unpleasantly so...or maybe I was just too drunk to notice (and you can't blame me since we had all three Breakfast Stout incarnations at this tasting + other awesome stuff).  M - Palate is smooth, creamy, and oily with low carbonation. Some alcohol warmth.  D - Pretty good for a bourbon barrel imperial stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,DavoleBomb,4.2,"Poured into a pint glass.  4.5 A: Thick syrupy black in color. Two fingers of thick creamy medium brown head. Good rention and plenty of lacing. Very beautiful.  4.5 S: Bourbon and pungent espresso offer a big punch right from the get go. Roasty toasty barley and chocolate top off the aroma.  4.0 T: I am a bit disappointed. The taste is very good and I really enjoy it. However, the bourbon and coffee don't mesh as well as I hoped or expected. Flavors include lots of bourbon, lots of coffee, chocolate and roasted barley.  4.5 M: Full body. Very creamy and smooth. Warming on finish.  4.0 D: Alcohol is less pronounced than I'd expect and that is great. Like I said in the taste section, the coffee and bourbon competes rather than complements. I probably won't be having too many more of these since GI BBS is a much better bourbon barrel brew and the regular FBS is a much better coffee stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,rfgetz,4.84,"Recently sampled on both bottle and draft. The below mirrors most of my thoughts from the draft version, but with a few noted differences. The bottle was approx. a year old or more.  A - Dark brown, minimal head... good lacing. While the tap version stuck to the glass, leaving a sticky film after each sip, there was very little of that from the bottle.  S - dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, slight milky sweetness, wood, subdued burbon and booze. Much more mellow than draft.  T - As the scent goes...complex blend of dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate combined with a delicate blend of burbon, vanilla, wood with a touch of milky sweetness. The bottle version featured a more mellow burbon taste which allowed the other flavors to stand out and blend.  M - Medium bodied. The bottle version is much smoother, slightly lighter and less sticky than the tap.  D - Well the bottle version wins out over the tap version in my book. The extra aging gives the flavors and textures a bit more time to mellow out and blend together. The subdued boozyness increases the drinkability. The only attribute that was less desireable was the appearance due to lack of full head and lack of coating.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,jlindros,4.85,"Acquired this beauty thanks to BEERchitect. I've been dreaming of cracking this open for weeks. I've woken up in a cold sweat a few times dreaming of dancing Founders bottles with KBS letters flying out at me and into my mouth, and rivers of dark tasty liquid showering me in droves of awesomeness. And now its finally time to sample this thing. I feel like that virgin 17year old at prom that finally steps into the hotel room with his date, made of beer.  A: AS it pours it leaves a dark stain on the air. As it rims around the glass it also leaves a dark brown syrup on the sides, it so thick I can't even call it a stain. I can only match the thickness of this to 40W oil after it came out of a 200k mile car and was there almost all 200k miles. I can almost see chunks of grains floating out with it, but I think that's my brain on KBS. A very faint almost detectable head starts to appear, but it's just a tease as it fades from memory and leaves a few small cliques of bubbles  N: Despite being able to smell the roasted malts and chocolate from the stains on the air, I decided to go in deeper. I think I need someone to cover me. The nose is so overwhelming I think my insides just stained a dark coffee brown color. Tons of coffee and roasted malts just come billowing out of the glass on a horse of dark bakers chocolate. It does remind me a lot of regular breakfast stout at this point, but then comes the awesomeness of the bourbon and oak. The remnants of the bourbon and alcohol dance their way into my nostrils burning the edges slightly as my nose both cringes and begs for more like a sadomasochistic kid getting his first taste of the whip. Did I mention there was some coffee and chocolate there?  T: Oooohhhh snap! Here comes the train. The molasses thick oil like liquid slowly spreads out over my tongue. Lots of sweetness and chocolate come spreading out. The coffee instantly wakes my ass up, hence breakfast. The alcohol taste and burn really just lashes out at my mouth with hot pokers almost as if my mouth has just died and gone to hell. The bourbon taste starts to come through once the heavy set chocolate and coffee attempt to die out. And by attempt to die out I mean when your mouth starts to become used to it because this stuff never goes away. More dark sweetness that could only have come from the depths of Candyland hell start to berate my taste buds for attempting a second sip. It leaves a thick coating all around the mouth as if it was secretly made of wax that sticks when warm. It also seems to leave a slightly milky residue bringing me back to 5th grade and dousing my milk with so much chocolate I used to just take the Hersheys plastic container and fill IT with milk rather than the other way around. Some quick oats dash their way into the taste enough to make a horse blush. A touch of oak and vanilla round it off, if you can say that.  M: Really? Have you not figured out by now? Super thick and sticky, a viscosity of some huge number. The alcohol burns the edges of the mouth and any flesh that dares stand in it's way. Could use a slight bit of more carbonation, but that is most likely a product of the aging.  F: Finishes semi sweet, like just chewing on a piece of rubber coffee cake and then biting on some baker's chocolate. The thickness fills all the pours and taste buds so much so that I don't think I'll be able to taste my dinner tomorrow. The coffee's caffeine can't be absorbed anymore as everything is coated with that huge thick substance, more solid than liquid. The slight oak and vanilla, followed by bourbon and more alcohol seem to fade last on the tongue, except the chocolate and coffee which never disappear. With it being so ridiculously thick and strong tasting I can barely continue to sip it.  Final thoughts: While I'm sitting here enjoying this amazing beverage that I have been having wet dream about, I think my house is on fire, my son is probably in the corner chewing on wires or something, and the Patriots are somehow getting their butts kicked by Buffalo, but none of that matters as my world fades into a vertigo feeling as I blissfully attempt to consume and digest this crazy stuff. It's almost as if I'm living vicariously through myself trying to enjoy this, or am I still dreaming. Perhaps its a coma I slipped into when I took my first sip of it. I don't even think there is a word in the English language to describe it, so I'll make one up. This beer, is it still really a beer at this point, anyways this beer is transcendingerompteous. Need I say more? Can't wait till this stuff comes around again.

Thin and short lived brown head. Huge bouquet of chocolate malt, well roasted. No trace of bourbon or even alcohol for that matter. Just incredible depth.  Taste is beyond description, just more going on here than one's taste buds can tell. Ive never had something like this before. Tons of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, some smooth bittersweet malt (presumably from the bourbon), significant bitterness adds depth to the monstrous wall of dark chocolate. Bitterness is well blended in. Nice dry grassy hoppyness. Theres just an insane amount of flavor here, but its organized confusion.  Body is beyond just chewy, its more like a steak.

S: Slightly smokey bourbon which mixes with a scent of oaky dark fruits (prunes/raisins) that cannot be overlooked beyond the everpresent irish/coffee undertone.  T: The coffee overtones complement the everpresent boozy character which allows this to be such a strong stout that is also paired with a dominating aged fruit body.  M: Thick full-body with adequate carbonation. At first it appears that you are sipping an ealry morning mocha which quickly turns into a slightly acidic magic bullet with tones of coffee, roasted malt, and bourbon chocolate that diffuse into a pleasing aged fruit character.

A: Jet black color with a micro thin tan head that disappears almost immediately but leaves a bit of lacing.  S: Bourbon and coffee dominate the nose with chocolate shavings underneath.  T: Starts with a SMOOTH bourbon infused chocolate flavor which is balanced perfectly by an undertone of lightly astringent/ bitter coffee/ hops flavor.  M: Full bodied but extremely smooth with little carbonation. A pretty easy drinker for a beer of this strength.  D: The smoothness of this brew really blew me away, I didn't think a beer of this size could be drunk that easy. Probably the best bourbon barrel aged brew I've had as the bourbon flavor was perfectly balanced with the other flavors. I've been sold on Founders for a while, but this brew is a further testament to their greatness.

Aromas of coffee, whiskey, milk chocolate, and dark roasted malt.  T: The taste mimics the nose but without any whiskey flavor which is pretty disappointing. I was expecting more milk chocolate/vanilla flavors and they are no where to be found. There's a hop/burnt malt bitterness in the finish which really wasn't what I was expecting either.  M: It coats the mouth and feels about like an imperial stout. Very light carbonation at first but it shows up if you swirl it in your mouth.  D: The bitter finish and the disappearing act the whiskey does in the taste plus the high ABV really don't make this very drinkable for me.

1199,19960,NittanyBeerFan,4.82,"On the unofficial last night of summer, I figured that I would cap off an incredible summer of beer consumption with one more special treat from my trip to Pittsburgh one week ago. The trip that brought Yellow Bus, BA Decadence, and BA Yeti continues to give. Picked this bottle up at the Fathead's bottle shop.  A: Just about everything you would expect from a big imperial stout. Thick in the pour like a used 10-W30 motor oil. It almost looks like syrup as it leaves the bottle and deposits itself in my glass with hardly a disturbance to the surface. Black, dark, and creamy. The laces start as thick rings and finish as speckles of foam as the lacing slowly slid back into the beer. The only thing missing here is a bit of head.  S: Where do I even start? Hazelnut coffee and dark roasted malts spring out of the beer into my anxiously waiting nostrils. Bourbon and vanilla find their way with a little more effort, and as I bury my nose in my glass, I can make out some freshly ground coffee beans as well, rounding out a stellar aroma.  T: Complexity out the ass...let's see how I can describe it...It starts with the roasted flavor of dark coffee. As the beer sits on my tongue, maple syrup swarms around my pallet as if I just drowned a stack of pancakes and went in for the first bite. Oakey and vanilla notes fill in as the syrup reluctantly bows out and all of a sudden BAM! There is the bourbon. It really gets you, and if you love bourbon, this is a dream come true. The bourbon, like the rest of the flavors, lingers just long enough to satisfy, then moves on. It gives way back to coffee in the aftertaste, and a slight taste of alcohol in the exhale, bringing the flavor full circle.  M/D: Extremely thick, as I mentioned before. Every bit as thick as the pour indicates. Almost no carbonation at all. The texture is silky, smooth, and creamy. The complexity is the most amazing part of this beer. I have never experienced so many flavors in such even and well- balance proportions. A bit too heavy for more than 2, but an absolutely phenomenal beer. I am so happy that I was able to enjoy this.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,portia99,4.69,"12oz bottle poured into a Portsmouth goblet. Bottled 2/16/09  A - Pours an opaque, pitch black. A vague attempt at forming a head, but it ultimately fails, only creating a short lasting dark tan colored collar and small islands on the surface.  S - Smells heavily of coffee, deep and roasty. Dark chocolates and licorice join in with a faint bourbony aroma and a hint of vanilla too. Very thin alcohol smell contributes as well.  T - Taste closely mirrors the aroma. Lots of coffee and dark chocolate flavors. Heavy roastiness. Vanilla flavors keep things smooth. Bourbon flavor adds nice complexity without lots of alcohol burn...just a nice warmth. Where GI BCS is bourbony and hot, this is smooth, complex, and much more drinkable.  M - Thick and oily feeling. Coats the entire mouth. Alcohol level and bourbon aging provide some warmth that lingers. Vanilla stays well into the aftertaste and gives a rich, smooth finish.  D - Bourbon barrel aged beers take on lots of different characteristics. This is probably my favorite of these beers. The aging gives lots of added flavors making this beer taste great. The big trick is obtaining the complexity without the heat - something this accomplishes very well. I want to feel like I'm drinking a beer (albeit a strong one), not a shot of bourbon. Given the strength of this, it is extremely smooth and drinkable...just great for this style.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,erz316,4.07,"bottled on 02/16/09, poured into pint glass from 12floz bottle  A - bottle pours a pretty thick pitch black liquid, that only forms about a single mm of head after a forced pour. the body is pitch black. head is so incredibly minimal that is is quite a let-down on the visual aspect. what little head there is has a medium-dark brown colour to it.  S - the top note is espresso. smells quite a lot like chocolate covered espresso beans, which is the chocolate aspect mixing into the predominant coffee part. the mid note is dark roasted malts, while the rest of the aroma way down below it all is this slight whiskey flavour, a bit spicy and boozy, but for the most part the nose is completely dominated by this chocolate covered espresso bean aroma. would have liked to see more of the kentucky aspect, and have a much bigger whiskey presence.  T - the taste is like a mirror refleciton of the nose: majority is this distinctive choco-espresso bean flavour, while the malts are in the middle with some slight whiskey taste. the initial taste is the choco-espresso and some slightly sweet malts; bitterness is definite at 70 ibu but there is no real identifiable hoppy bitterness, nothing vegetal; slight alcohol warmth and minimal whiskey taste along with it. the finish has more of a dry alcohol taste than a whiskey burn. the espresso bean flavour also stays with us for the entire finish; slightly more bitter at the far end of the finish than the rest of the process. the aftertaste is like i've had a handful of dark chocolate covered espresso beans. I am throughly unimpressed with the beer; though it is very smooth and tastes pretty good, the redundancy of the taste and distinct lack of whiskey is much to much to ignore.  MF&D - the one real redeeming factor for this brew is that it is very very drinkable despite the high abv. one hardly (sadly) taste the alcohol or whiskey barreling process. aside from that, the body of the beer is too thin for the style. american doubles are supposed to be thicker than an ris, but this is barely cutting it for that. it has a heavy body, but one at the far light side of heavys. not something for which I would dish out the money again, much prefer the regular breakfast stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,wagenvolks,4.67,"Many thanks to rnorgart for the hook-up in his Ghetto Fabulous BIF! 12oz bottle into a Great Divide tulip (bottled on 2/17/09).  According to the label, KBS ""is good for everything a stout ought to be good for"". So I guess if I ever run low on motor oil, this beer just might do the trick. After all, it pours like the stuff--viscous, oily, black. A dark brown head creeps slowly from the depths beneath and eventually settles to a scant ring of foam. A few speckles of lacing cling to the glass. An earthy, musty aroma eminates from the hops amidst a black sea of baker's chocolate, dark roasted coffee beans, and vanilla-rich bourbon. The alcohol is hardly noticeable...quite a feat considering the monster ABV on this thing. Sharp, woody tannins and spice round out the astounding aroma.  Designer dark chocolate bars and booze-soaked bourbon-barrel planks fight for the tastebuds, with the alcohol eventually winning the rights to the back of the tongue and throat. The finish is sticky with a warming booze and bitter with earthy hops, but neither in a harsh way. Few beers completely coat the lips, tongue, and roof of the mouth like KBS. This. stuff. is. THICK. Thankfully, there's enough carbonation to keep this behemoth afloat, as the mouthfeel is equal parts velvety smooth and spiced with booze. Founders manages to both set trends in the American craft brewing industry and simultaneously raise the bar, and as such, KBS deserves its place among the top of the the category that is ""Extreme Brewing"".",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Hot flavor with a little bourbon, wood, and coffee. Medium-full body with some tannic, woody astringency and alcohol burn in the finish. A blast of flavor, with a cool mix of coffee and bourbon that works a little better than in the aroma. The mouthfeel definitely brings it down though, with too much astringency and alcohol.

Somewhat thick mouthfeel, but not chewy. The bourbon burn kind of hits half way through and leaves a little burn on the way down but not so much as to overpower flavor or make undrinkable.

Smells very boozy with coffee and bourbon notes.  Taste is wonderful! This beer is very good. Alot going on with this one! Coffee and roasty flavors followed by slight alcohol burn mixed with the bourbon and oak which balance well with each other! This is the best barrel aged beer i have ever tried. The vanilla taste comes out in the beer in the aftertaste with a bit of boozy taste, but it is not overwhelming at any time! It is done well.  Mouthfeel just adds to this beers appeal! The mouthfeel wonderful. It is like a thick silk on your toungue with flavours that coat your mouth making you want another sip.  The drinkabllity is right where it should be for a beer of this class. After i drank this beer i wanted another, even though i know that one was plenty! At almost 12% this beer goes down easy.

1199,19960,angelmonster,3.87,"Got this beer in trade with SonicDescent  Pours a thin 1 finger chocolate head. Body is pitch black and no light is seen through the beer. Head retention was barely above average and lacing was a little better.  Smell is similar to Breakfast Stout, lots of bitter chocolate and coffee. Smells very sweet like Bourbon County Stout, has that soy sauce aroma mixed with some alcohol. As beer warms up the oak from the barrel comes out nicely.  First taste I'm getting is definitely alcohol, but not really bourbon. This is more like just raw alcohol, maybe vodka. Not getting the vanilla flavor that I love from Bourbon. Bitterness is definitely coming through in this beer also. As the beer warms up the oak is more pronounced. Heat and warming sensation from the alcohol is very present. Unlike Breakfast Stout, the chocolate and coffee flavors are less present, they really take backseat to alcohol, oak and bitter after taste.  Carbonation of the beer is good, not under carbonated by any means. Body is similar to Breakfast Stout, not as rich as I would have hoped and the head was gone pretty fast.  This beer is definitely a sipper. Not very session able but a few of these would go a long way. The barrel aging was apparent, which was nice. Only wish that the alcohol was dialed down a bit.

You can definitely taste the espresso and the oatmeal backbone which holds up well with the heat of the alcohol. The sweetness of the bourbon comes through. This beer is to savored like a finely cooked steak and should be sipped slowly allowing all the favors to cross your palette.  M-The carbonation is there even though its lost in the initial blackness. This beer is thick like a good cup of Joe. It coats the tongue nicely and stays in the mouth allowing you to get through all the levels of flavor.  D - This is one beer session my friends, any more than one is a waste.

1199,19960,MasterSki,4.67,"Review #350 - finally getting around to reviewing this classic brew. Picked up a ton of the '09 vintage at the release party. Served in my Surly pint glass.  A - One finger of dark tan/mocha foam that slowly dissipates to a solid cap and ring and leaves a pretty solid lace. Pitch black brew, with no light anywhere to be found. The only thing lacking is head volume, which is forgivable for a 11.2% brew.  S - Intense smell of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, and roasted malts. Strongly reminds me of a Coffee Crisp chocolate bar soaked in whiskey, which is a great thing as I love both of those things. As it warms up there are more subtle notes of wood and hazelnuts. It's just a wonderfully balanced and well-integrated combination of flavors.  T - The taste is terrific, but not quite as rich as the smell. Very strong onset of chocolate and vanilla flavors, before transitioning into light whiskey and a strong roasty bitterness that lingers well into the aftertaste. Never tastes particularly hot or over-the-top.  M - Very low carbonation, super creamy and soft in texture, with a mediuum-thick body. Leaves behind lots of residual stickiness that complements the roasty aftertaste. There's a nice bit of warming that happens after a while.  D - This is one of the few high ABV barrel-aged stouts where I want more than a single 12oz bottle. The lovely sweet flavors keep the booziness from getting out of hand and the wonderful texture makes it something I just can't stop sipping.  It's exceptional that a beer that is pretty readily available (at least during March) maintains such a high level of quality. One of the few stouts in the top 100 that isn't overrated.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Dark Black, a little foam that looks like a dark brown froth, poured into my tulip glass.  The smell is fantastic, lots of chocolate, roasted coffee, a hint of bourbon which all come together nicely.  I taste a really good chocolate stout, good bitterness on the finish, the bourbon is well integrated, not boozy. I personally like a little more bourbon heat. KBS is so balanced where all the flavors meld well together, and no flavor profile is too dominating.  The mouthfeel is excellent, thick and creamy mouthfeel with the perfect amount of carbonation.

Despite being hot (this is the most recent release and it's still very strong on the alcohol), the flavors are smooth, going down like a fine bourbon should. Vanilla, spice, and a bit of coffee bean. That is all, but that's not to say there isn't complexity. Everything here is so finely layered, while also pulling together to effectively create a delicious imperial stout that demands to be sipped on for dessert! Big body and low carbonation.

1199,19960,zminor,4.35,"Finally sitting down to review this. Got my first bottle in a trade several months ago (thanks duffman!) and immediately fell in love. Thats the short review. Longer version below.  Appearance is gorgeous, but certainly nothing too groundbreaking for a stout. Dark, thick, with a wonderful light colored espresso head that sticks around for a while. Excellent lacing and retention.  Smell is a nice blend of bourbon, coffee, vanilla, and milk chocolate. There isn't one element that really smacks you in the face, but the subtlety sends my heart aflutter.  Taste begins with a hint of chocolate, followed by vanilla and coffee with a beautiful wave of bourbon underneath it all. The bourbon doesn't make it too hot as happens with other stouts, but rather elevates the flavors to another level. Spectacular.  This is a creamy, rich beer that is way too easy to drink. 12 oz is the perfect size for a beer like this.

I chatted up the guy working the desk and asked him if there was any ""Beer Advocate"" beers that he had. He showed me these and I was sold. This is certainly the ""KBS"" vintage version. Poured into my Murphy's Irish Red pint glass.  A Actually medium to dark brown 1.0 cm head over an ink black body that looks awesome. The head dissipated within a minute or two, though.  S You know, the most prominent smell is a cereal like grain along with the dark malt. I think that it is from the Bourbon aging process. Really interesting, inviting.  T ohhhh wwwowww! What a taste explosion! The first sensation I get is a really great, mature Stout with deep, dark malt and chocolate notes. Then comes a wave of bourbon like alcohol that rushes in and then ebbs out and leaves me with a great aftertaste of a finely crafted stout. I have no doubt why this is no highly rated now that I have tasted it. Incredible.  M Thick, syrupy, with a bite of alcohol and yet smooth at the beginning and during the long finish but the middle is like a thunderclap of alcohol. One of the ""biggest"" beers that I have ever had mouthfeel wise. For the style, that is a plus in my book.  D You know, I thought it wasn't that good (it is such a huuuge beer) but I found myself reaching for it over and over until it was gone. I am upgrading my rating!  Notes: What a great experience.

Taste is - wow, starting sweet, maybe with some alcohol hotness, then turning into dark chocolate, bitterness coming out, espresso flavors in the finish.

1199,19960,marvin213,4.5,"Dark as the dickens, there's basically no head even seconds after the pour. I didn't exactly rush this gem into its container, but only the thinnest layer of tan CO2 bubbles capped her off. Lacing leaves its mark as I swirl the liquid, and traces of carbonation do continue to make their way to the surface--both marks of a well-made beer. This ""highly acclaimed"" beverage looks the part, and I actually second-guess the label's claim that this stout ale does not provide relief for various ailments.  It's complex and a bit on the cold side, but the KBS doesn't smell quite exceptional like its Yankee Candle-esque, relatively ordinary counterpart. I do smell the sweet bourbon--oh-so-sweet bourbon. It gives it a sweet, stout aroma--not like the buttery, creamy variety characteristic of milk stouts, but a unique, bourbony one. It's not overwhelming like whiffing a freshly opened Jim Beam handle, and it's not subtle as if I'm doubting its presence. The only thing missing pre-taste is a foamier cap that might take both ratings to ""exceptional status.""  The taste is neat and eerily refreshing. Forced to choose sides, I'd say the bourbon is more on the subtle side of taste. Initially doubtful about the ""stout ale"" style, I now think it's aptly categorized. It's got drinkable qualities reminiscent of ales, but with the heartiness of a stout. Essentially everything about this beer is so well done. I can even appreciate the oak--despite the potentially overpowering stout and bourbon components, the oakiness leaves its mark. It gives the beer a tannin-like quality with post-swallow residuals.  I'm wading into mouthfeel territory now, and it's difficult to separate the two. The beer's complexity gives rise to a tasting experience in which I taste a bourbon stout while I feel an oaky ale. I've yet to perfectly rate a beer, and perhaps it's ridiculous obstinance at this point. Still, as I enjoy this cold beer that I poured (gently) into my Flying Dog pint glass, I wonder if only serving style is what's holding this back. Next time, I'll serve it slightly warmer, in a snifter. Ah, next time....",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,spointon,4.65,"I poured this fine example of a stout-ale from a wee-but-corpulent 12oz brown bottle into a stemmed globe-style glass bearing the strange image of a red bicycle with bulbous tyres.  A= This ale poured as dark as pitch with a shy, elusive head that showed its tawny face and retreated immediately into the murky depths, leaving behind nothing but an uneven skim. Of lace, there was just a few spotty deposits hither and yon on my glass, but nothing to excite even the most easily aroused.  S= I found this stout to be odiferous in the most pleasant sense, with subtle notes of wood, whiskey-spirits, and dark ripened fruit dancing a gavotte behind the larger characteristics of coffee, fire-roasted malts, and alcohol.  T= Startled from their reverie, my tastebuds received immense flavor and pleasure from the first sip of this potent elixir. Dark roasted grains bestow a delicious espresso and bitter chocolate character, made only more sublime by their subtelty and balance against the other contributing flavors of treacle, toffee, and dark cherries. The conclusion of each sip brought out exquisite bits of vanilla, wood, leather, and a beautiful warming alcohol.  MF= Shockingly average body that started off well carbonated but lost a good bit of that to the atmosphere in short order. This felt creamy and smooth despite the roasty bitterness and carbonation.  D= No matter what the epic nature of this fine ale's ABV caused me to believe, the flavors and aroma combined to endear it to me forever.

The bourbon is toward the finish, right before more coffee, but it isnt overpowering at all. In fact none of the flavors here overpower any of the others, rather they all compliment each other nicely. Bitterness is akin to a cup of black coffee.  M- Thinner than I thought based on looks.

A: Inky, pitch black, with a light crown of brown bubbles that surface with an aggressive pour, quickly receded to nothing. A few spots of bubbles towards the outer edges. 95% opacity and quite thick looking. Nice.  S: Bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, smoke, charred wood, roasted coffee, and lots of those things, faint little alcohol hit, but the actual smell of bourbon overpowers the booze related with it. Smoke is really present in there as well. Definitely interesting.  T: Really strong on the whiskey/bourbon flavors, chocolate and coffee lie underneath those, definitely a beer for whiskey drinkers, I'm impressed with that. Has a lot more of the barrel characteristics than other barrel aged beers I've had. Fair amount of alcohol in the end that yields some bitterness. Hops are definitely present, and at 70 IBUS I'm not surprised, kind of hard to place them, but there is a definite hop quality coming through. Smoke is up there as well. Very nice beer.  M: A little thinner than I had expected, and that hurts this beer somewhat, I figured this one would be on the verge of chewy. Alcohol and oak aging make it ridiculously dry though, so that definitely brings it back around. Slight warmth, but wow this definitely dries out the mouth.  D: Fairly easy to drink, if you like bourbon, which I happen to. Yes it is indeed completely different than Founders Breakfast Stout, and IMO much better. This beer is a solid punch to the mouth of malt and bourbon, which adds up to everything that it is claimed to be, it just is a little thinner than I had hoped for. Would pair nicely with a cigar. Nice beer, and I hope to acquire some more somehow. Thanks Ben!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,WVbeergeek,4.57,"Appears pitch black in color not a spectrum of visible light passes through this glass. Head was thick after a vigorous pour but did not hold up very well, due to the barrel aging and high alcohol. Lace does patch rather well with sporadic chunky style lace patterns.  Aroma has a black patent malt that is unrelenting with massive whiskey barrel approaches going on. Vanilla, oak, charred wood, and dark chocolate with a milky softness going on, it's quite incredible the array of flavors this beer hits you with. Whiskey finesses it's way in there with loads of fusel alcohol snaring the nasal passages.  Flavor a wonderful collision of imperial breakfast aka chocolate, coffee, and oatmeal stout aged on whiskey barrels. I can't wait to taste the Canadian Breakfast Stout due to be on tap at Fathead's soon. Pure flavor with charred oak, milk chocolate, and bitter coffee roasts coming together I'm sure there's a ton of hops if the IBUs weigh in at 70, but it's hard to detect with everything going on here. Great stuff.  Mouthfeel is velvety smooth yet viscous in girth if that makes sense. It has the gravity but doesn't weight you down, a bit of alcohol burn does take your senses on but it's really well hidden at the end of the day.  Drinkability is fantastic one of those beers that you buy a four pack and sit on it every 4 months just to enjoy it.

1199,19960,Hojaminbag,4.22,"A pretty vigorous pour produces about one finger of brown head that can be seen forming in the bottom of the beer. The body is completely opaque and is almost completely black, or at least the darkest of browns. The head has some decent retention and leaves some lacing on the side of my glass.  The smell is packed with a ton of coffee that is followed by the weaker odor of whiskey.  The biggest flavors in KBS are the same as in the aroma. A ton of coffee comes up front, tasting a lot like strong coffee beans. A hint of sweet chocolate and caramel malts are in the middle, but they surface only for a second before whiskey and oak take over. A spicy oak flavor and a big blast of whiskey are paired with a good alcohol warming in the finish.  The body is a probably on the light side of medium, and carbonation is a little higher than medium. I would like the feel to be a little fuller, but it's almost there.  Pretty drinkable beer, it really masks the high ABV well. A good one overall.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Buschyfor3,4.94,"Had this on the 4th of July - opened my celebrations that day with this exceptional American Imperial Stout - after all, it's America's birthday, so why hold back? Review from notes.  Served from a chilled 12oz bottle into my Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.  A: A glorious pour, complete with fireworks going off in the yard behind me. Huge, viscious, oily and black - good god almighty this is a viscous looking stout and exactly how I prefer them. A thin, dark khaki head tries to form on the surface for a couple of second, but it is quickly sucked back down into the pitch-black depths of stout goodness. Strong, sticky lacing coats the sides of my glass with a motor oil-like film of brown ""goo."" ""Wow!"" is all I can muster.  S: ""Like getting beaten over the head with a sack of fresh Colombian coffee and then getting a swirly in a bourbon barrel."" Huge notes abound - Kentucky Bourbon, with its sumptuous, sweet aroma and slight sting to the nostrils; vanilla and charred, earthy wood from the oak barrels; fresh, dark coffee; chocolate-covered espresso beans. So many roasted notes - coffee, burnt toast, toasted oats. Oh my this is mouthwatering just taking in this stout's aroma.  T: What a hit. To be honest, everyone in my family was asking for a sip of this after catching a whiff of the nose - ""I wonder what that tastes like?"" ""Go ahead and take a sip,"" I say, offering to share my only bottle with all who are curious. And each time the response was the same: ""Oh wow! This is beer? This tastes too good to be a beer. Really? This is a beer? This tastes like something you should have with dessert!"" I live in a family of bourbon enthusiasts... I should have known to brought another bottle!  Boy was this stout a treat to drink. The flavors began with a creamy wave of sweet vanilla and earthy oak notes. Next, the bourbon comes on, gently at first with sweet caramel and buttery overtones, but then it throttles up and delivers a soothing streak of warmth and boozy alcohol flavor. In the midst of this flurry of flavors charges in a deep, black, roasted coffee flavor along with some burnt toast and rolled oats that moderate any lingering vanilla sweetness from the start. But soon after comes a kiss of melted dark chocolate that balances out another layer of sweetness with just the right bitter edge. Throughout the body there is not much of a hop presence - really just a residual flash of bitterness before the finish, but most is masked by the huge coffee and roastiness that abounds. The finish is all bourbon, slightly medicinal and with a nice, tame burn to round out each sip.  M: Smooth slickness; slightly chewy, creamy goodness that coats on the way down.  D: High ABV but remarkably tamed for a barrel-aged beast. The bourbon is there, but it is pleasant and adds layers of complexity to this stout. Cost may be the only issue hampering drinkability... but does that really matter on a day like today? No.  This is as close to a ""5"" as I think I have ever come to rating a beer, and as it stands, is not only the best stout I've ever had, but the best beer I've ever had. The only downside, if there is one, is its hefty price point and rather spotty availability. Still, this stout is so good that if I were to come across a 4pk at my local bottle shop, I think I would turn a blind eye when it rings up north of $24. In any event, I would definitely suggest you seek out a bottle or two. I can only imagine that cellaring would elevate this beer into the rarefied air of ""sublime.""

1199,19960,srroos,4.62,"Aged approximately one year. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a large wine glass.  A: Opaque dark brown. Little head, perhaps a side effect of aging.  S: Chocolate, coffee, and of course bourbon. Small hint of vanilla from the oak.  T: Like sipping on an espresso with dark chocolate. Finishes with a bitterness like a freshly brewed cup of black coffee.  MF: Thinner than appearances suggest, but a good medium body without the heaviness like many other big stouts.

It is by far the greatest bourbon barrel aged impy stout ever crafted by man (that I've tried so far - can't imagine it getting much better than this though). Brewing is not only science, but an art form and with KBS, Founders has created the Mona Lisa of bourbon impy stouts. This stuff is ridiculously amazing.

1199,19960,Shaon94,2.82,"Founders KBS is a specialty stout, not an american double / imperial, IMO. I love the normal Breakfast Stout which is in the same class as this, but this one is just ok, and really does not taste much like a beer.  Appearance - Outstanding appearance. Jet black with a amber head (very small one with a quick pour) Sticky looking lacing left behind. Think, Breakfast stout without the head.  Smell - Bourbon? Ok, I know that is the type of barrel it was aged in but wow this first bottle is overpowering me. I am sensitive to liquor smells so that is all I am getting out of this one other than maybe a slight woodsy smell some coffee in the back.  Taste - Bourbon, and damned if it is not strong on the bourbon. Maybe this is a bad bottle? I mean it has a hint of the Breakfast stout behind it, but it pales in comparison to the taste of the liquor. I am going to have a second one on another day before I make this my final verdict*, but I am not fond of the taste in the least. It almost tastes like they added bourbon instead of just letting it soak up the flavors naturally from the wood. *Second bottle as strong as the first. They definitely added bourbon here. I think this would be much better if they had not added and just let it natural soak it from the wood.  Mouthfeel - Makes up some ground here! The mouthfeel is good. Slight bite, but it coats well. Smooth going down, and the alcohol kicks in giving it a nice warming feeling from the gut all the way up.  Drinkability - I am not sure you would drink more than one of these in a session unless you just really like the taste of bourbon, or just wanted to get drunk quick. But really if your looking to just get drunk there are a lot of other cheaper beers that will do it for you. I would not go out of my way to get this one again, but it is good for what it is I guess.

Sharing this one actually with my mom, who is a big fan of burbon-infused brews. On the pour, there now is a snifter of 20-50 motor oil in front of me. The beer has a perfect amount of light lacing that adds to the beauty of this monster. I couldn't see through this with a spotlight if I had one.I wish every cup of espresso looked this delicious. Smells like burnt burbony oakiness, vanilla, coffee,bitter cocoa, massive malty goodness, iced coffee, a perfect touch of sweetness keeps the alcohol and burbon in a perfect check. This is exactly what I was hoping for. Hops are buried in the malty sweet goodness. It smells so good its almost hard to drink because then it will be gone. To quote Beerfest "" I want to stick my dick in it"" O..my..god This is fantastic as anticipated. Kahlua like sweetness, followed by a wave of burbony infused chocolate coffee thick goodness. Vanilla, smoky malts, caramelized brown sugar.I get burbon at the start and finish of each sip in differing levels of spiciness and intensity. The sip is perfect, not spicy and burbony overtones, rather restrained and utilized. The finish is thick and spicy, like a well aged burbon. The best burbon-infused brew to have ever passed my lips thusfar is being consumed at an alarmingly fast rate, that is the only sad thing about this great experience. A smoked gouda cheese would work beautifully with this. A madagascar vanilla infused dessert, a burbon sauced venison served rare would marry great into the spicy character of this brew...or a great brunch brew with smoked cheese omelets..or as it serves now A Kentucky Breakfast indeed alone in all its delcious goodness.

Very nice looking beer.  The smell was bourbon, and more bourbon followed by some vanilla and roasted notes.  Taste followed nose closely. I know this is supposed to have coffee and chocolate but I just didn't get a lot of it. I'm sure it was there, but they were faint whispers compared to the bourbon's shouting. Vanilla was also prominent.  Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Light carbonation, but just right for a stout. The alchohol burns going down, but in a good way.  Drinkability certainly takes a hit due to the alchohol. I'll agree with the comments here that say this was like drinking liquor as much as beer in some ways due to the heavy bourbon flavors and the strong alchohol presence.  This was my first BA top 10 beer and I figured it was as good a beer as any to do my first BA review.

Pours a 1/4 finger cocoa brown head. The little head doesn't last long, but the etching brings up some carbonation bubbles. Leaves some lace rings for the little bit of head. Color is a dark dark chocolate brown. The tone of brown is like no other beer I have had.  Aroma: Just amazing. Chocolate. Cocoa. Quality coffee. Hardly, any of the 11.2% abv shows here. A little vanilla. A very robust and complex beer. The blend of chocolate and coffee is just perfect. A nice layer of bourbon and oak go with the other flavors so well. If I could only smell one beer in the world, this would be it (to date that is).  Taste: A little alcohol with the bourbon up front. Strong coffee. Chocolate. (As I am reviewing this, I look at the bottle and realize the side says Malt Beverage brewed with chocolate and coffee. Well at least Founders doesn't lie). Vanilla is definitely doesn't hide here. After I sip on this a bit more, I realize that the alcohol I am tasting is the bourbon. As the beer warms up a bit, the bourbon begins to taste better and better. Very amazing tasting beer.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, rich, and creamy (just like CBS). The bourbon loves to shine through the longer it stays in my mouth. Leaves a very chocolate malty aftertaste. Full bodied. The carbonation level is right on the money for a beer like this (a medium level). Ends a little dry and hot.  Honestly, I don't really know if there is anything wrong with this beer. This big stout is drinking better than a lot of other beers I have had and it is so much darker (not implying that darker means anything). My beer is almost gone already and I want more of it. I am so impressed with Founders for this beer. They managed to make an 11.2% abv beer be so damn drinkable. If I had more I would easily want to crack open another. I will be buying as much of this as I can next year if it makes it to MN. A must try!  Edit: As I just took the last sip, I was so sad that I realized I had no more of this amazing liquid.

Slight coffee and smokey scents, but everything is shot down by the alcoholic smell  T- Starts off like a regular coffee stout then BANG, the alcohol kicks. The alcohol burn is quite strong and masks a lot of the flavors. At the same time the bourbon barrel aging definitely imparts its flavor.

M- mouthfeel is good as it firsts hits the palate then goes somewhat downhill due to the alcohol bite.  D- drinkability on this one could not be higher than a 3. I could not possibly drink two or three of these in one sitting. This is not just due to the ABV, but also how much the alcohol comes through and is not masked superbly.

On top of everything already mentioned, there's a splash of caramel.  Lots of roasted things going on. Extremely powerful flavors, but everything is muted by the intense alcohol.  The alcohol is extreme in this beast. It's the dominant flavor and completely overpowers everything else. Still, you pick up the oak, chocolate and coffee. Despite 70 IBUs, there's little acknowledgement from the hops.  It's thick. It's almost chewy thick. Sweetness early on. Chocolate, coffee and bourbon start to take over. Normally where the hops would say hello is an onslaught of alcohol heat. Chocolate and coffee bitterness in the swallow, followed by a lingering bourbony heat. Um, yeah, full bodied if ever there was a full bodied beer. The alcohol isn't hidden at all. It's front and center. With all that, you can expect a dry finish.  If manly beers are your thing, this is the one for you. As soon as you think you like aggressive beers, try this. I hated it four years ago when I first had it. It was just too much.

I'd be dying to try this beer for years and upon finally scoring some expected an orgasmic experience, and, as usual, my personal over-hype marred my experience somewhat. Guess that's my fault.

1199,19960,m2paulun,4.75,"A - Pours dark black with no light penetrating the glass. A half inch head appeared after a hard pour. The head was a dark mocha color that did not stick around.  S - Roasted coffee beans up front. After that there is a sweet smell of bourbon mixed with vanilla.  T - The taste is where this beer really shines. There is a nice balance between the flavors. First is coffee. After the beer starts to warm up a bit the chocolate really becomes present. At the end you can taste the bourbon, but it is not really strong. I really enjoyed that the bourbon was not overwhelming. Alcohol is present, but hidden well.  M - Smooth and creamy as a milkshake.  D - Would love to drink more than one, but probably should not.  One of my favorite beers since getting into craft.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ritzkiss,4.75,"8oz pour at the brewpub, in a snifter. Arrives a placid jet black, pretty much no bubbles. Little lacing.  Nose is earthy, strong bourbon, roasty goodness, light sweetness.  This is the ultimate sipping beer. The flavors are complex and demanding. Peat, bourbon, vanilla, roasty malts, a dry hop finish. Warming alcohol in the back. Much more demanding than CBS which I had before and more rewarding. The dry finish helps it pair well with more options and it doesn't have that overwhelming sweetness. Smooth carbonation.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Casey10,4.75,"Wow - got this in a trade, fantastic beer.  A - Dark no light will show threw this.  S - Wonderful burnt coffee, dark chocolate, booze.  T - Unbelievable chocolate, hides the 11.2 abv very well  M - Smooth, frothy but at the same time chocolately, numbs the taste buds in a good way.  D - Better than good less than exceptional as if you drank this one it might be very hard to drink another.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,OldSchoolGamer,4.15,"This beer has been all the rage lately. The hype with this beer is reaching Dark Lord status (which I will also be reviewing soon!). Lets see what I think:  A: Pours pitch black. No light will penetrate this beer even when held directly up to the Sun. Head is very small but is a dark brown color. No lacing is left with each sip.  S: Big coffee smell. Some oak. There is an alcohol presence as well.  T: Massive complexity. The first thing you will taste is the big roasted coffee flavors. You can taste the Bourbon as well. Lots of oak. The finish is a mix of vanilla and chocolate. That is the best part of the beer in my opinion. Alcohol is also pretty prominent.  M: Very thick and creamy. Coats the mouth with each sip. Silky smooth. Very nice.  D: This is a big beer. 11.2%ABV is nothing to underestimate. This is a sipper. I doubt anybody could chug this. This is a beer to savor. Very rich and flavorful.  This beer is very very good. Is it worthy of all the hype? Personally, I don't think so. Founders Imperial Stout is superior to this, In my opinion. But you do get a massive complexity, even for an Imperial Stout. If you can find it, pick it up. But, I think there are better Imperial Stouts out there that are much cheaper and more widely available.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Ineedabeerhere,4.49,"I've had this a few times now, thanks to recent distribution in NJ and a great trader named GbVDave- trade with him!  This review is the 2009, released under the name KBS- and it pours black as all hell into a DFH snifter, but with no visible head aside from a late forming film of mocha, leaving oodles of spotty lacing.  Really a beautiful aroma. Just boozy enough, the coffee and chocolate from the regular BS are there backed by roasted malts with tones of bourbon coming through. The slightly sweet vanilla, caramel, toffee, oak are wonderful.  A lot of the same flavors come through in the taste. Alcohol just slightly present- enough to let you know its there. But not intrusive. Such a full, coating mouthfeel of chocolate and roasted coffee beans. As drinkable as could be for a monster of this ABV and style. Overall, I liked this release a lot more fresh than the 2008- the slightly tweaked recipe was definitely an improvement. It will be interesting to see how this one develops with a little age on it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,alcstradamus,4.25,"A--Pours black as night with a dark brown sliver of head that fades very quickly leaving just a tiny ring. Wish there was a little more head, next time I have one I will give it a hard pour straight into the bottom of the glass and see what it does. The color was very nice while it lasted.  S--Holy cow this is big, boozy and complex. Roasted malts, coffee beans, oak, vanilla, trace amounts of whiskey.  T--This is a smack across the jaw with a baseball bat. I'm happy to note that the whiskey flavors here are balanced well with the coffee notes. I was afraid it would be too hot but it definitely is not. Just a nice mix of coffee, oak, and bourbon. Perhaps a bit too much of an acrid coffee bean roastiness, but below that quite superb.  M--Medium to full bodied, a bit more creaminess would put this over the top  D--Definitely a slow drinker here due to the intense flavor, but at over 11% ABV what do you expect really? Definitely a beer for those who adore brashness, although perhaps not quite refined enough to be truly drinkable. 6 oz. served at nearly room temperature would make for the best drinking experience with this brew.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,gameface23,4.54,"Bottle courtesy of a great friend.  A: Pours pitch black with a slight brown halo when held up to the light. The head was non-existent when poured into my snifter and there wasn't a single carbonation bubble to be found.  S: Coffee, vanilla, caramel, a certain ""sawdust"" aroma that isn't as unappealing as it sounds.  T: The booze isn't as well-hidden as I would have liked, but that is the only flaw in this beer. Coffee and chocolate with oak.  M: Perfect. It's thick without being cloying. Silky smooth.  D: This is a sipper. A delicious, delicious sipper. The only negatives are the price and the fact that it is pretty boozy.

The head does not disipitate at all, it just hangs around.  S - Chocolate covered coffee beans, bourbon, caramel.  T - Milk chocolate, bourbon, slight bitterness, coffee beans. I would smack my lips together over and over after every taste, so good!  M - Smooth, creamy, soft, medium-full bodied but not overly so, just right. Very little fizzy carbonation, perfect.

1199,19960,GatorBeerNerd,4.74,"12 oz bottle purchased as part of a case from Green's in Columbia by a friend of mine. Thanks again Dan! Poured into a standard pint glass.  A: Pours a jet black with no hints of any colors even when held up to the light. The head was extremely short lived but was a beautiful chocolate color when it was there. The ring of bubbles that does remain leaves a bit of lacing on the glass.  S: Vanilla, oak, bourbon, coffee, and dark roasted malts all join together to make a wonderful complex and inviting aroma.  T: I hate to do it a bit of an injustice by saying see the smell category and change aroma to taste, but it is perfect for this one. What an incredible tasty and complex brew. The vanilla and bourbon make it a real special treat to me.  M: It is a bit thinner than I would expect for the style. The oak also makes it a bit harsh in the mouth for me even though I like the flavor it gives it causes the mouthfeel to suffer a bit.  D: The ABV is well hidden, but you still naturally want to sip this one to savor it. With that said, it does drink easier than quite a few of its style competitors.  This is a great brew and worth all the accolades and posts it gets. Once again a big thanks to Dan for getting a case for myself and a friend to share. I have traded quite a bit of it away for some other gems to various local buddies. I am pretty sure I am going to keep the rest of it for myself.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,HopHead84,3.9,"Poured into a snifter, the beer appears nearly black with a small brown head that disappears almost instantaneously.  The aroma is brimming with coffee and roasted malt character. Beneath the coffee titan lies some dark chocolate. The hops have absolutely no prayer of being noticed. As the beer warms bourbon notes become apparent.  The flavor is, well, a ton of coffee. To be honest, there's too much coffee in this beer for my taste. The notes of chocolate are understated. The roasted malt profile is very strong. Hop bitterness is present at a moderate level, but the hop flavor is overwhelmed by coffee and roastiness, which is to be expected. Bourbon is more noticeable once the beer warms, but it's still not prominent. The finish is bitter coffee and acrid.  The beer is robust, with low carbonation and a creamy, grainy mouthfeel.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,rpstevens,4.49,"Big thanks to abbddull for sending a 4 pack of this to Portsmouth! Poured from a bottle into a snifter.  The beer is black with a thin mocha head that fades quickly. The lacing is oily and slow moving down the sides of the glass.  The smell is coffee, vanilla and a hot bourbon in that order. The coffee smell is very strong at the start of the nose, a roasty coffee.  The taste is more bourbon forward than the smell, but the coffee and vanilla are definitely still there and it strikes a nice balance.  The alcohol presence is a little too strong to drink more than one of these, but as a sipper this is definitely a very pleasant experience.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Onenote81,3.94,"Finally getting to the KBS. Pours a very thick oily black with absolutely no head, no bubbles, no lace, nothing. This just looks like dirty motor oil in a glass. Nose is full of coffee, vanilla, bourbon, almonds, and bread.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Great viscous mouth that is easy to sip. I waited awhile after pouring to drink this. At first I was tasting huge coffee flavor that finished slightly boozy, but as it warmed and I continued to drink, I was getting more vanilla and a faint nutty finish. Drinkability is low for me as it took about an hour to finish this one, and I could never have another right away.  Very good beer, but I gotta be honest, I prefer the original Breakfast Stout.

1199,19960,ffejherb,4.97,"On tap at Capone's on 5/23/09. Served in a snifter. Thanks to FooFaa for the round!  A - Black body with one-finger creamy mocha-colored head reminiscent of a milkshake, but reduced to a thin film and left some spotty lace around the glass.  S - Lovely, aromatic blend of sweet vanilla notes, bourbon and chocolate, the latter especially as the liquid warmed up. Woody and oaky notes add quite a bit of depth and complexity to the aroma. Wonderfully balanced nose overall.  T - Amazing flavor that combines vanilla, bourbon, woody/oaky notes, sweet and bitter chocolate and earthy hops. Alcohol is virtually buried underneath all of the wonderful flavors of this complex stout.  M - Creamy and luscious mouthfeel with a slick, oily texture providing a bit of chewiness. Softly carbonated. Finishes with moderate bitterness and a subtle alcohol warmth on the palate.  D - Amazingly drinkable for 10% ABV!

T: Wow, it is like Breakfast Stout on steroids. Starts with a strong, bitter flavor of coffee followed by a nice chocolate taste. Almost like a mocha coffee. After the strong coffee and chocolate it gets boozy but nicely accompanied by roasted malt. I also get a tinge of oak which balanced out the alcohol flavor very nice. Very nice alcohol and oaky aftertaste. I didn't get the soy saucy taste I usually get with most stouts, which was a little surprising since I picked some up from the smell.

Almost no head, but leaves faint legs like a wine or whiskey.  S - Lots of rich roasted coffee and chocolate, with a shade of sweet vanilla and bourbon. Heady, aromatic, and lovely.  T - Bitter burnt coffee and chocolate flood the palate, backed up by the heady, floral vanilla and the slightly sweet, slightly boozy bourbon. Finishes with faint hop/coffee bitterness, but otherwise clean.  M - Heavy and smooth, almost oily, with mild carbonation adding a bit of levity to the viscous, chewy mouthfeel. Elegance, thy name is KBS.  D - Definitely a sipper due to its ABV and weight, but the booze is well hidden and actually adds to the experience via the bourbon flavor. Excellent for casual sipping and surprisingly not too hefty in the gut.  overall - A definite winner. It's sharp, bitter chocolate and coffee contrast oh so well with the sweet, heady, smooth vanilla and bourbon. The notes are simple, but so well executed.

S: The smell is phenomenal! Tons of dark roasted coffee blended with warm vanilla and bourbon. The smell is huge, you can smell this from a mile away!  T: The taste is similar to the smell, but the bourbon takes control. The bourbon hits you first, followed by a hint of vanilla, then some coffee. But this is not bitter nor does it really have a bite to it. Pretty light on the palate.  Overall, a very good beer that I would recommend. It was a little thin for me and lacked on the roast, but the bourbon was fantastic!  Second time having this beer it was much, much better. Pitch black sludge with a dark mocha head. Incredibly scent of dark coffee, sweet bourbon and coffee with a deep, robust flavor of the aforementioned. Fantastic.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,AVDeuph,4.7,"Ironically us folk in Michigan have a harder time getting this beer, once it's out, than do most of the other states that Founders distributes to. Therefore...  Thanks to LauraAlberts for this bottle, acquired via trade.  A: Very dark and completely opaque, a one-finger mocha head that dissipated in a few minutes.  S: A thick malty and coffee aroma that welcomes the bourbon aspects very easily and naturally. Clearly balanced.  T: Tastes like espresso, black malts, maybe some dark sugar, and bourbon of course. The bourbon is completely contained within the other flavors, this is a very nice balance akin to the aroma.  M: Low but dainty carbonation; it is just enough to keep the beer from being cloying or too slick. Very coating, definitely a sipper.  D: Well, just because you could drink two or three doesn't mean you will. This beer is meant to be enjoyed slowly and, in my opinion, occasionally. You wouldn't want to spoil the majesty by just throwing a few back.  A fantastic beer by Founders. I'm definitely saving a few for aging.  Edit: I've recently had this beer both on tap and on nitro-tap. Tap is the way to go, nitro-tap is least preferable actually.

1199,19960,mjl21,4.57,"Acquired via trade...thanks Josh! 12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter. No bottling info is given. Comes in at 11.2% and 70 IBUs. The artwork is different than the one pictured here on BA.  A-Black in color and looks thick coming out of the bottle. There really is no head at all and it leaves a miniscule sandy ring. Lots of nice lace streaks are left.  S-When it is first poured, it has a stronger coffee aroma than the FBS. There is some roast malt and dark chocolate. As it warms the bourbon barrel characteristics really come out. Get lots of oak, vanilla, and bourbon. I will say that it is not the strongest bourbon smelling beer that I have tried.  T-Lots of oak and bourbon flavors hit first. Lots of sweet vanilla immediately follows. The coffee flavors come out in the back of the mouth and in the aftertaste. Once this has sat in the glass for about 15 minutes they all come together for a great tasting beer.  M-Thick bodied with a nice carbonation level. The bourbon is definitely detectable going down and leaves a warming feel in the belly.  D-Due to the high abv and the fact that it is not hidden means this is best left as a nightcap.  This is really a great beer that is deserving of all of its praise.

'09: head is much more stable  bourbon aroma more upfront, woody, with coffee and roast.  bourbon and wood more apparent again, but almost no vanilla. trace of chocolate?  everything else is the same.  still a nice beer, though overrated slightly. no change in scores needed, imho.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ORIGINAL REVIEW 07-13-2008  no dating to be found, but vendor is reliable and says it's from earlier in 2008. poured into snifter.  opaque brown, almost black. brownish tan head that very slowly fades to thin layer. decent web of lace all down the glass.  immediate woody bourbon aroma upon opening. espresso-like coffee upon pouring. these dominate the nose. couldn't pick out much else.  flavor is roasted coffee, almost espresso, with some malt and alcohol sweetness peeking through, then hint of wood aging and whiskey, but then the coffee/charred malt/hop bitterness comes in again and carries into the finish, which also gives another hint of bourbon. grassy+coffee aftertase.  tad thinner than expected, but initially smooth before some acidic astringent character comes in later for texture. accompanied by a gentle carbonation.  very good, but not sure if it lives up to the hype.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A ton of flavor from coffee and bourbon and smooth roasted stout notes carrying everything across the palate.  Mouthfeel - Surprisingly thin but still nice.  Drinkability - Surprisingly drinkable for an 11.2% ABV beer. I sipped this one for over an hour. Alcohol becomes more apparent as it warms to room temperature but still quite enjoyable.

College and finals week will take the life out of anyone but now that that's over, I had a chance to open 'er up this afternoon and go through her. This may be the most hyped up beer that I've ever had, as it was nearly impossible to find here in Jersey. It wasn't 5's all across the board for me, but I'm glad I was able to try this out. It's not bad by any means!  Like ""motor oil"" pours? This is a good example of it and brings new meaning to the term ""Irish Breakfast"". Do you like vanilla, caramel, dark chocolate, and roasted coffee? This beer has all of those with a strong bourbon undertone. The alcohol packs a wallop here but you'll enjoy this so much that the bottle will be empty by the time you realize that this is a stout and not something to have at 8 in the morning. I can't say that this is like anything I've ever had before because quite frankly, there's nothing out there like this. Most stouts are too strong, too bitter, or too harsh to go down this easily. It's a bit more than a sipping beer but by no means is this something to chug down on. Like any good bourbon, this has to be savored!  Yes, it's strong but if you don't like that, there are plenty of other brews out there to try. Normally, I get repeated tastings of a beer to see if my first instinct was right but since this was in such short supply, I only got one bottle. No matter, while the aroma and pour were a bit understated, most everything about this was excellent. So good in fact, that this would fit in before, during, and after dinner.

The minimal head looks like a dollop of dark chocolate mousse while the body shimmers with the blackness of a Betty Page costume. The first taste is as shockingly rich as you can imagine. Vanilla beans dance on the tip of the tongue. Exquisite chocolate coats the palate followed by an intense impression of coffee and finishing with the smoky char imparted by the sweet bourbon barrel full of brown sugar and wood tannin. Just picture Ghiradelli fudge brownies by a campfire followed by a sip of your favorite single barrel bourbon. '09 seemed slightly hotter this year, but I am sure with time it will settle in to its world-class self.

1199,19960,everetends,4.52,"12 oz bottle that became mine through the amazing package sent to me by rhinos00. I have heard great things and I am very excited. Poured this every so slowly into my Terrapin Snifter.  A: Pours an ever so slow and thick, extra viscous deep black oil like liquid. Seriously, this looks thick and bit intimidating. The body is a pretty nice glossy black color. No light has a chance to get through this baby. Solid as a rock. About a quarter finger of dark brown head slowly bubbled up but didn't have much staying power. It fizzles out to a thin ring, but it still throws up some nice spotty lace. Swirled on the glass, the body leaves a very noticeable light yellow film on the glass. This beer has something going on.  S: I wish I could fully describe how beautiful this beer smells. I could smell it right when I popped the cap and its impressive. I want to make love to this beer now. Getting a very distinct coffee aroma that is nothing short of the aroma you get when you open up a bag of fresh, high quality, roasted coffee beans. Its rather impressive. Behind that is a really nice combo of some dark, slightly bitter chocolate and some rich vanilla aromas. The friggin oak is oh so nice on the back end. I mean, its damn near perfect and what I always want when I hear oak. Slight bourbon aroma finishes this baby off. Just fantastic and I don't know if it gets any better than this.  T: I wish this was as good as the aroma, but the flavor is damned close. Chocolate starts things off here. Getting some really rich and dark chocolate that is walking hand in hand with that amazing coffee presence. That coffee is so distinct and fine. Incredible really. Then comes that vanilla, not as rich as the nose but its lovely. Oak and that bourbon flavor are very light but still very much in the ball game. Finish is a really nice oatmeal heartiness and tastiness. Damn!!!!  M: The hits just keep on coming for sure. Full bodied brew. This is pretty much the poster child of a full bodied brew. Low carbonation lets this beer remain chewy and thick, which is very nice and appropriate. ABV is actually pretty light considering the size of this beer. With Bourbon in the title, I expect a bit more alcohol but screw it. Aftertaste is some chocolate and oatmeal. Nice.  D: This is a big beer but it is nicely drinkable. You proably don't want to drink too many because of its size and the fact that it is a bit sweet at times. Still, its a pretty damned smooth beer that has amazing qualities. The aroma is amazing, and the flavor is not far behind at all. My only gripe is that I can't get more of this at the store. Founders, bring this beer to a store near me.

1199,19960,BZero007,4.5,"The pour on this particular brew amazed me. Motor oil black poured in to my glass with only a hint of brown showing where the beer was thin while being poured. To see a beer this dark was great. The head was a little hard to form but not bad and came out a very brown foamy head. that disapeard after a couple of mins. The flavor of this Double Stout was complex and not for me. The flavor of dark chocolated and roasted coffe were up front and strong. These two flavors blended and balanced extremely well, so well that I swore there was a new flavor every sip. Behind the major flavors I could swear to have a new taste with each sip. The mouth feel was perfect. The brew was smooth and nothing in the beer killed my taste buds. The drinkability for me has to be about average, as I owuld probably think twice on a secound and pass on a third. The flavors are very intense coffee and I just personally slowly enjoy these brews. This beer will always have a place in my fridge and tummy.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,MrMcGibblets,4.77,"dense black color with a minimal tan head and lacing. love the bottle label. dark dried fruit, chocolate, coffee, vanilla in the nose with just a hint of whisky. fortunately this does not smell boozy despite the barrel aging, no small feat given that and the abv. taste is lots of the above with big sweet dark malts mingling with not-overdone roastiness and just enough bitterness. again just a touch of the whisky character. big and lush mouthfeel and veeery smooth. looong complex finish is semi-sweet but manages not to be cloying. light creamy carbonation is perfect for this style. this was some amazing shit, what i liked the best was that it was not overly whiskyish or boozy. this was like having a decadent chocalatey dessert that managed not to be overly sweet. get you some.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,jgap,4.71,"09 bottle: Hours black into a tulip pint glass with a slightly thin, brown head. Great retention that fades to a patchy lace once halfway through. Smell is strong oak, vanilla, and slightly bitter dark chocolate (this was a surprise to me). Taste it extremely complex particularly for a stout. It begins with a slight hoppyness that is joined quickly by the bourbon. This lingers until the sweet vanilla shows up and a surprise appearance of chocolate. This all fades to a very nice coffee flavor that almost completely hides the alcohol. What is amazing to me (even more so than the complexity) is the crisp, clean after taste. I feel like most stouts that end on a coffee note have a lingering aftertaste. Not KBS- it's very clean and that makes it waaaay too drinkable! Lastly, the 'thicker side of medium' mouthfeel and carbonation level are matched perfectly to the taste. I love thick brews but the rich, creamy texture is what makes this brew exceptional to me- I love it!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,RustyDiamond,4.72,"2009 version...11.2% ABV...70 IBUs  Jet black viscous pour into a Brooklyn snifter. Smallish mocha head with a good amount of bubbles that quickly dissipated.  Nostril tingling bourbon, black cherry, hot French roast Italian, and sultry vanilla bean aroma. Couldn't not stop smelling this brew. Complex and sexy.  Very bright and hoppy up front. Hard to tell the hop arrangement, with everything going on. But the hop flavor was very evident...floral and fruity. Maybe vanilla + hops early on? Somewhat creamy and delicious. This took a nice right turn into big bourbon flavor town with roasty coffee flavor riding shotgun. Sweet vanilla, warm bourbon, roasty finish...very satisfying.  This is the King of the bourbon coffee stouts.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Brad007,4.48,"This is it. Review No.1000.  This beer pours a pitch black color, dark as night with a brown one-finger head into my fancy Piraat glass.  The aroma is rich and creamy with a strong whiff of bourbon from the barrels, chocolate and vanilla in the nose. A bit of roasted coffee peeks out as well.  The taste is nice and creamy upfront with a strong bourbon presence that increases as it warms up. A good hint of both chocolate and coffee are still there but the bourbon and alcohol seem to dominate.  The mouthfeel is full of warm bourbon and lingering bitter coffee and chocolate. Again, the bourbon dominates the palate.  This is a very good example of the style. However, I should have aged it for a while. Still quite drinkable while young and it doesn't take away from the potential that this beer has. The aroma is intact but the taste needs some age.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,surfer4life,4.61,"Thanks to Gorby10826 for this one I got in a trade, poured into a tulip from a 12oz bottle.  A - Pours dark brown like molasses and chocolate. Small head takes a few seconds to form but recedes just as fast to a thin film of foam around the edge of the glass. Nice bits of lacing down the glass.  S - Dark chocolate dominates the nose, perhaps it's to cold, but I don't detect the bourbon smell from the aging process. I do get a good hint at some hops for balance, but mostly this is big on the malty, chocolatey nose. Other than that I get some real good toffee notes. This promises greatness.  T - Wow, amazing. Exactly what I smelled, HUGE chocolate taste, with some roast coffee and toffee. Slight hints at hops to balance. The bourbon comes through, but is not overbearing like the Bourbon County Stout. Amazing oak wood flavor as well.  M - Heavy body, medium to high carbonation. Very good alcohol warming and so very very creamy on the pallet. Leaves the mouth completely coated and helps the taste linger for a long time.  D - At 11.2% alcohol, this is remarkably drinkable. As with most great bottles, I would like to have this on Tap!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,rwdkosak,4.35,"This spent some time on the shelf before I cracked it open pouring motor oil darkness with a forced sheen of dark head barely covering the surface. Nose was full of dark chocolate and coffee, maybe the slightest bit of vanilla and raisin in the background. Taste was just the same with to me much more dark chocolate than coffee, full but not distracting alcohol from middle to end and certainly nice warming effect throughout the finish. Coffee is there as is some vanilla, raisin. Very smooth mouthfeel and the bourbon aging comes through nicely without taking away any of the other notes. Drinkability will always be low at &gt;10% ABV but truly I could have had another if it weren't so bloody hard to find. I rarely give a 5 for taste but this is an exemplar for the style.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Kadonny,4.82,"Poured from a tap at Capones in Norristown at his bourbon event into a snifter glass. This is the 2009 version now known as just ""KBS"".  A: A deep dark thick black with no light filtering through. Full ring lacing that does last on the glass, minimal head on the pour though with a light brown color.  S: So complex. Coffee, chocolate, bourbon, dark fruits and a hint of alcohol.  T: Again, really complex. First flavors of dark coffee and espresso with the dark fruits. Second wave gives you the bourbon flavors and the barrel flavors of dark chocolate and vanilla coupled with some candy sweetness. Finish is a bit bitter with a nice alcohol warming. Just a great, great beer. It just all melds so well together. I will say I think the tap version is a bit smoother and even more so balanced with all the flavors working together.  M: Full and bold with a nice warming alcohol feel, smoother and creamier than the bottle.  D: Really? High, I had one snifter and I could have just gotten started. So drinkable for that high abv that it's insane.  Overall I think this beer is just a bit more drinkable on draft, as it was soooo good. This is a world class beer folks, don't ever pass it up if you get to try it. Wonderful, one you will remember.

1199,19960,khiasmus,4.02,"09.  An oily liquid is dripping down, one in which can be seen the reflection of the dreary day from the picture window. The love of my life lies lifeless in the next room, and the inky blackness reflecting the gloomy, Londonish outdoors seems but fitting. So young. Too young. A quick flash of brown atop the liquid, then nothing but the reflection. I take a sniff and the memories come flooding back... her love for thick espresso, her black, wispy hair, her deep eyes, she looked through me. Every morning. Espresso and bourbon. The log cabin, the smell of the wood, last night's fire, the smell before the rain, almost metallic, tannins... Black chocolate, as she loved it. Black chocolate covered espresso beans. Chase each with another shot of whiskey, it lingers in the throat. I can't bear the thought of the next years. A time machine, I need a time machine. Another shot of espresso, another shot of bourbon. Give me peace. The dying trees in the garden, the black earth below the drooping, lifeless branches. The grey drops plunging earthward, and then shattering. Thick. Oily, viscous, but so warm in the finish, so oily a clean, warm, dry finish. Earthy. Like her, tomorrow. It always comes back. I can't ignore it. The bourbon lingers in my throat, I will see her again. I will see... She knew Him. Now He's all I have.

1199,19960,UGADawgGuy,4.08,"Updated review (now reflects KBS 2010)...  Appearance: Thick, black, and unusual (if not totally unique). KBS is viscous, opaque, and very low on carbonation. An aggressive pours yields only a half-finger of khaki head, which dwindles to a filmy cap throughout drinking. The body of the beer, though, looks heavy and thick enough to warrant high marks. This is a STOUT.  Smell: Coffee is predominant, followed by dark chocolate, burnt toast, and bourbon. I was told to expect a blast of bourbon and vanilla, but I don't find it here. In my view, this smells more like a ""coffee stout"" than a ""bourbon-barrel stout."" As a big bourbon fan, I hope I'm wrong...  Taste: Aw, man, I'm not wrong. Coffee and dark chocolate are foremost in this beer's flavor profile, with a hint of bourbon tagging along for the ride. I pick up a good amount of wet oak, but bourbon and vanilla are afterthoughts relative to that dominant coffee. Still, I don't hate coffee or chocolate, so the beer tastes good to me -- it's just not the bourbon bomb I was hoping for.  Mouthfeel: Not as thick and viscous as the mouthfeel would lead you to believe, but still pretty heavy in the mouth. Low on carbonation (which is fine for the style) and fairly sticky. I like it.  Drinkability: The coffee and dark chocolate flavors may not hide the alcohol entirely, but this year's (2010) edition of KBS does a fine job of distracting the drinker from the relatively high ABV. This is a strong beer, and you'll feel its effects after even a single 12-ounce bottle. It's good stuff, but you've got to exercise caution while drinking it.  I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from trying KBS, but it's not the bourbon-aceous miracle I'd been led to expect. Give it a try, but don't expect a ton of bourbon character -- for that, look to Goose Island Bourbon County Stout or Founders Nemesis 2009.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,WanderingFool,4.35,"Kentucky Breakfast Stout pours a midnight black into the glass with a small, creamy brown head on tap. The foam dissolves quickly to a thin ring around the surface of the beer. A few spots of lace cling to the side of the glass.  The robust aroma has strong notes of chocolate, oak, vanilla, coffee and alcohol. The aroma may best be described as a combination of bourbon and chocolate. Each sip of this full bodied beer is very smooth, silky and slightly chewy. The flavor is much like the aroma. Mainly bourbon and chocolate, but neither dominate. Nice notes of vanilla, oak, and coffee are also present. It finishes dry with an alcohol taste and mild burn. Once gone the chocolate and oak flavor lingers on the palate.  This is definitely an interesting and tasty beer. The flavor is much more balanced than the standard Founders Breakfast Stout, which to me seemed like a pint of cold coffee. The 10% alcohol is hidden pretty well and sneaks up on you before you finish off one bottle. Definitely give this beer a try if you can find it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Domingo,4.35,"Thanks to Beejay for this one. Thick and black, just like the original. It's like pouring spent motor oil. Not much carbonation, but the beer does manage to keep a thin head layer throughout. Bourbon's the first thing that jumps out in the smell, but it's not overpowering like some bourbon aged beers can be. It's there, but you also clearly get some roasted coffee and baker's chocolate, too. The beer does a good job of keeping flavors cycling. At first you'll pick up the bourbon and vanilla from the wood, but then you'll get waves of black coffee, roasted grain, strong hot chocolate, and then everything comes full circle. The bourbon comes on a little strong in the front of your mouth, but you'll pick everything else up quickly. With some sips, it's barely there at all, which can be welcome to keep it from being too much. Just like the normal breakfast stout, the texture on this is amazing. Silky smooth. The only beer that can do it any better than this is BORIS. Goes down easy, but not quite as easy as the normal one. The bourbon brings a potency that makes this more of a sipper. The extra alcohol and whiskey flavors keep this in check a bit more.  I honestly prefer the original just because it's so drinkable, and is almost perfect as is. This is still an absolutely killer beer, but I lean in the direction of the normal BS.  EDIT: A second bottle was even better. Granted I gave this one a pretty stellar score, but my second bottle was on par with the normal Breakfast Stout. The bourbon had mellowed slightly and the flavors had layered more. I'm thinking that holding on to one of these for a long time might be REALLY amazing.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,coldmeat23,4.33,"GLASS: Snifter TEMP: Approx 50 degrees Had on-tap @ Founder's on 4-22-2009  Pours an opaque black color, which was expected. About a one-finger head of mocha colored foam sits on top. Retention is very good. Lacing is spotty and slightly sticky.  Big coffee notes dominate the nose. There is a nice presence of chocolates, both milk and dark. Nice roasted barley malts. The bourbon is fairly understated. It does bring a nice presence to the table. Nice vanilla notes and a certain butteriness. I guess I just expected it to be more pronounced, from all the hype surrounding this one.  Coffee still dominates in the taste, like the nose. Good chocolate taste, also. The bourbon is, thankfully, a little more present here than in the nose. Good floral vanilla quality. Nice, big, brown sugar notes. Hints of oak and toffees. This one is actually quite well balanced. If GI BCS is too over-the-top for you, give this one a try. It's much more subtle.  Nice, upper-end of the scale, medium body. Almost makes it into full bodied. Nice smoothness with a low level of carbonation. Low enough that I think it would benefit from just a little more. Then it could be creamy and delicious.  Yes it is 10%ABV, and you get an indication of that when drinking it. But the flavors are so wonderful and it is so smooth that you tend to want to overlook that part and just drink another.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,kels,4.32,"So I was slightly disappointed in the bottled 09 KBS and heard that the on-tap version was immensely better. When I heard Party Town in Florence, KY was getting a keg and selling growlers, I had to give it a try. Review is from a pour into a snifter.  Appearance: Pours super dark brown with slightly oily-looking residue sitting atop the completely headless liquid. Little specks of cream-colored lacing attempt to cling to the glass, and slide away quickly.  Smell: Delicious aromas of bittersweet chocolate and dark coffee combine with slightest hints of vanilla, chewy malts, sweet oak and very subtle bourbon.  Taste/Mouthfeel: So much milder than the bottle pour! The feel is smooth as silk, with a slight sticky wetness that's heavy enough to hold the flavors on the tongue awhile. The taste is full of delicious bourbon that doesn't overpower the accompanying flavors of dry, charred oak, barely sweet bitter chocolate, dry roasted coffee and subtle bitter hops. Really nice balance that isn't overpowering in any way. Even the alcohol, while present, isn't overwhelming.  Drinkability: Moderate for the style. The warming sensation is really nice and the mouthfeel is very satisfying. I certainly wouldn't drink too many at once, but only because I know better.  I have to say that I'm so much more impressed by the draught version of this beer. The flavors were much more well-blended and balanced and the alcohol was better contained. In the bottle version I really felt like the bourbon came across in the nose and taste waaay too hot and seemed more like rubbing alcohol. I'm hoping the rest of the 4 pack I have aging comes out like this growler did.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The smell is all Bourbon, distinct and alcoholic. The taste was very smooth. Complex, rich, earthy, strong bourbon finish. Wow. This is legit. A sipper to be sure.

Swirled head's a mocha color with seemingly a bit of amber.  Smell: Huge bitter black coffee at first, and as it starts to warm the oak and wood notes come through, along with clean and beautiful vanilla aromas, and the sweeter bourbon aromas. Wonderful and heady and hugely complex.  Taste: What I love about this, in addition to the finish, which seems endless, is the transformation of flavors and complexity going on. Bitter black coffee at first, along with dark fruit, and then it slides into the honey and vanilla and wood flavors, with beautiful oak notes. There's no oak monster here. The barrel notes are complimentary and perfect overall, while the bourbon also doesn't dominate, but adds its own layers of flavor.  Mouthfeel: Big and chewy and creamy with near-perfect carbonation levels letting all the flavors do their thing.  Drinkability: Hell. Yes. What an amazing beer. All of us were blown away.

It was thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a lasting smooth and bitter oak aftertaste. Overall this had a fantastic flavor that was bold and complex, yet delicate and easy to drink.

1199,19960,PerzentRizen,4.57,"Poured into a Duvel glass at cellar temp this beer has a 1 inch dark tan to light brown head that reduces rather quickly. The beer itself is pitch black - it actually sucks the light out of the lightbulbs in the room. I can see my relection perfectly from all sides and the top of the beer. It's like peering into the depths of my soul and discovering a moonshiner.  The smell is of freshly roasted coffee, light bourbon, hints of bittersweet chocolate, and roasted barley. This isn't quite as over the top in the scent department - a little overhyped in this regard. I heard stories of this beer being smelled three states away - I can't smell it from 3 feet away.  The taste is like no other stout I've had. It's not quite as rich and chewy as BCS - which is a good thing. Althought that beer was good it lost points for the over-the-topness. The flavors here are an echo of the original aroma. There is a rich coffee and chocolate flavor that hits you first. Then you get a hop kick that bitters then recedes with the coffee and then you're left with a malty sweetness and a lingering flavor of chocolate nibs and resiny hop oils and coffee finish. This is one long beer. As a side note there really isn't much bourbon taste in the beer - there is the scent of bourbon.  The mouthfeel is lighter than expected but it is perfect for the style. This isn't watery but it's more in line with a coffee stout. It's still much thicker and more chewy than the regular breakfast stout.  Drinkability is over the top here. I could and would drink this more often if it were possible. Between the rarity and cost this is a rare treat for me. I did enjoy it greatly.

Pour was an amazing, thick used-motor oil black (only a beer geek could find that description appetizing). Aroma was dense with caramel, oak and vanilla. First few sips were almost overpowering, with a silky-sweet dark caramel, tinged wiht bourbon. Alcohol hit hard at the end, with an off-putting rubbing alcohol burn. As the beer warmed and I acclimated to the flavor, the sharp pepper of the alchol diminished, but never went away.

1199,19960,thirdeye11,4.26,"Thanks to Ktown67 for this during an in person trade.  Presentation: Poured from 12oz bottle into Duvel tulip.  A: Pours the blackest of blacks, with a semi-vigorous pour it has no head, but the bubbles settle to the top and form a 1/2 finger of dark tan bubbles. No lacing on the glass, and some odd sediment that lingers on the sides of the glass.  S: Smell is awesome. So complex for a stout which are normally one dimensional. Coffee and dark unsweetened cocoa powder, whiskey/bourbon and even some woody notes that are muted. Even some cream in the smell.  T: Having this and the standard breakfast stout from Founders this week have opened my eyes to the style which I generally don't like much. Lots of coffee, some unsweetened hot chocolate powder, maybe some marshmallow creme, whiskey is on the finish as is some bitternes that I wish wasn't. Very complex it isn't lacking anything I want. The bitterness is really not bad at all, and on the very lowest end of the spectrum compared to most stouts I've had. I really like this one, creamy too!  M: Almost perfect. Creamy, coating my mouth, but slightly more carbonation and it WOULD be perfection.  D: Very high for a strong flavor beer. I could have 2 or 3 of these no problem.

The special additions and ingredients really shine. Layers of chocolate and dark roasted coffee with a little cream and infused with subtle but noticeable bourbon. I really really like how the bourbon isn't overpowering like it is in GI BCS. Hints of vanilla hide within the bourbon flavors, but want to be noticed. No hop bitterness. Even the coffee doesn't add much bitterness. Fairly sweet all the way through. Nice warming sensation from the alcohol. Rich, velvety and creamy. My only complaint, not enough roasted malt flavors.

1199,19960,cdViking,4.15,"Consumed in bottle on 4/24. Thanks Tuthill for the trade.  The pour is absolutely amazing, wonderfully dark with a minimal head brown head that slowly rises. Smells very strongly of oak and coffee, and a little bit of dark chocolate. Taste is not quite exceptional but great nonetheless, reflecting the smell with a subtlety of bourbon that adds complexity. Its silky smooth and tastes almost frothy, but the carbonation in my bottle was almost nonexistent. Its a wonderfully tasty beer (moreso than the wonderfully boozy BCS), but I couldn't fathom having more than one of these in a session.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A: Pitch black/ licorice colored, dark ivory/ khaki colored head, which was very minimal and did not last long.  S: Notes of bourbon, chocolate, followed by a sweet malty/ alcohol flavor. There is a hint of bitterness in there as well.  T: STRONG bourbon flavor up front - delicious. this is followed by chocolate and roasted malts, maybe a bit of caramel. There is a subtle bitterness to it, which fits in perfectly for this brew.  M: Medium bodied, very smooth considering the immense bourbon note and high alcohol content. Great carbonation (somewhat light) for the style.  D: I could drink this beer all night.

T- Just the right amount of bourbon blended in. Perfect. The spice and hints from the bourbon highlight a nice underlying heavy black stout. So complex, even some hop bitterness is present at the end.  M- Frothy mouthfeel and very thickly bodied. So smooth. Not dry or sticky. Sweet hints of bourbon are left on the palate. It's perfect.

What? Oh. Wait. Ha. You just had to wait for the bubbles to rise up. There they are! A decent-sized head of tiny dark bubbles. Would be better if they lasted longer.  Smells like Quick. Really - nothing but chocolate milk. Well, and a little smoke...  Tastes like Quick with a little smoke. OK, not quite so sweet. But pretty close.

Smell is strong of roasted coffee, oak, and dark chocolate malts. It also kind of reminds me of a bold cabernet. The taste is strong of the roasted coffee & oak. There's also faint whiskey & dark fruits. The aftertaste is dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is acidic & oily. There's an alcohol warmth that's just like bourbon.  This is a drinkable beer. Very complex.

Lacing is average - lots of small dots and thin lines.  S. Chocolate, coffee and barrel influences such as vanilla, mocha, etc. Very nice but I was expecting a bit more. Some alcohol pokes through as it warms.  T. Initial wave of vanilla and chocolate flavors with a mild and unobtrusive hit of booze. There is a very nice back end hop bitterness to this beer and a long, flavorful finish that hangs around for a few minutes.  M. Full bodied and palate coating but not overly thick or syrupy.  D. Nice sipper - as others have noted, surprisingly drinkable given its ABV but one is enough for me.  This is a well crafted beer. I like it much more than FBS but I am unsure if this beer warrants all the hype, especially given its high tariff.

1199,19960,bhalter8,4.69,"After being such a big fan of the regular breakfast stout I was excited to see what the barrel aging did for it. Aggressive pour into my goblet yields almost zero head, amazing really. A swirl of the glass offers little lacing, as well. The color is oil black. The smell is pure alcohol, the aging really took over the sweet malt and coffee aroma in the original version. This is not to say that aroma completely left the beer, its still there, and makes for greater complexity in the smell. The barrel aging comes through in the taste as well, big bourbon heat upfront followed by the blend of coffee and dark chocolate undertones. A nice hop bitterness even finds a place in the amazingly complex taste. I have to say KBS may have the best consistency for an imperial stout ever, just the right thickness, and silky smooth to boot. This thing is definitely a heater, as easy as it goes down, it later reminds you that you are indeed sipping on a barrel aged stout by leaving heat in your throat and mouth behind. I have a few bottles, so I am glad I will get to revisit this beer, as it was completely unimpressive looking, but such an amazing, great flavor.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,NeroFiddled,4.24,"Put on the spot to order a beer quickly, a quick gander at the cooler revealed a beer I'd never had before with a label that read KBS. OK, I'll have that. DOH!!! Once delivered to me I realized that it was Kentucky Breakfast Stout from Founder's. I'd had it before, but the label was different. So, OK, I was having brunch and coffee and bourbon and stout seemed appropriate, and this is a beer that can stand up to (actually dominate over) a spicy mushroom enchilada. What I was not prepared for was the price... $12!!! Damn, if only I'd known.  Anyway, I'm sure there are a million reviews for this out there, so I'll keep it simple. I prefer the Breakfast Stout. I think that the Bourbon just adds a bit too much to the mix, and it clearly increases the perception of alcohol, whether there's more there or not. It also cuts down on the really nice coffee flavor that the standard Breakfast Stout has, and I think, the malt flavors as well.  What's nice about the Breakfast Stout is that it's really complex, but that's kind of lost in the KBS because the Bourbon characteristic cuts through a lot of it (at least at the end of the glass).  So although this is not a beer I'd throw out of bed (you know what I mean), it's just not quite as good as the beer that spawned it.  Oh, and I kind of have to ding it for points on the appearance as the head drops immediately, and it leaves little lacing, but on the other hand that might have just been the glass so I should give it the benefit of the doubt.

1199,19960,MPLS,4.37,"After reading the somewhat amusing label (at least they tried) I gave this guy a slow pour.  A: Dark swampy brown black, with a thin veil of moss brown goodness. Lacing was nominal, but still somewhat evident. Low carbonation.  S: Big chocolate notes, bourbon, coffee bitterness, nose hair twitching alcohol.  T: Much like the smell, biggest element is authoritarian chocolate. The coffee and bourbon are noticable, the coffee more subdued than the bourbon. They mix well to create a very tasty beer. 11% alcohol is hidden well. I must say that maybe if I would have tried this before other bourbon barreled beers I'd like it more.  M: Quite full bodied, coats the tongue quite well.  D: Enjoyable. A real treat to drink. High ABVs would keep my lightweight ass away from downing more than 3 in a sitting, but a very good sipping brew.

1199,19960,becktone,4.78,"From notes 3-29-09  Here's to 500 reviews! I think I'm going to retire my trusty Guinness pint glass which has proved usefull in about 4/5 of these reviews...it was my first and only glass for quite a long time. Prost!  Eye: Black and opaque...color doesn't get better than this! Is it clear? Who knows? Its too damn dark to tell, awesome! Head is steady at 1/2 finger and is very creamy, almost looks as if it came from a nitrous tap. Color of head is a light muddy brown. Really this is everything that you could expect. I think it would look marvelous next to a steak and some over-easy eggs at about 10:30-11:00 in the morning. It'd definitely look much better than that glass of OJ next to the plate. Lacing is very beautiful, rings and sheets....don't get much better...  Nose: Lots of coffee aromas here, like coffee beans, expressos, and cappuccinos all combined. But the strongest aroma is the coffee bean aroma, smells like you've got you're nose in a pot of Folgers or something....yet its much better quality than that. Under that roasted qualities come out but diminished by the strength of the coffee. Oak is under all that. Hints at bouron and alcohol warmth associated with bourbon, yet still hidden for the most part under the dominant coffee. I'd really like some more vanilla and oak tones that should be associated with bourbon barrel aging...Goose Island BCS has it right. Perhaps some age on this guy would improve its balance of aroma.  Tongue: Alcohol is evident, yet it doesn't get in the way, infact the flavor of the beer overtakes it! Oak is noticeable, but does not yet seem to meld all that well with the beer...so far I'm beginning to think that this one would be much better with some age on it. There is also a warmth to the flavor...yes from alcohol but the flavor of it is more of that associate with spirits-bourbon-than with high abv beer. Bourbon flavors tend to come through more closer to the finish, some oak, tiny hints at vanilla, but moreso a raw bourbon flavor like its been mixed with this beer as opposed to infused with it (BCS). Its different than BCS, more of a raw and less pronounced, yet at the same time more pronounced bourbon flavor. BCS has bourbon hints, oak and vanilla-that obviously come from the bourbon-as an overall flavor. This beer has a more pronounced ""shot of bourbon"" flavor. Its almost like during part of this beer you've added bourbon or taken part of a shot. It comes in right before the finish. Just before the finish bourbon flavor is perceived and the finish is a mix of beer and bourbon finish, a little warm and well...very good...hard to describe. Oakiness is there too, a woodiness. Both beers are good, but I think I'll have to say that this one is crafted better, the bourbon is more a part of the beer, it doesn't stick out. Rather its an integral part of this beer, it doesn't stick out but needs a bit searching for. All in all, this is the best bourbon barrel beer I've had to date, its blended the best and all the flavors work together the best.  Feel and Drinkability: Thick and heavy on the palate. Awesome. Slight warming at the swallow, but not all that much. Low carbonation. Overall the feel of chocolate syrup in melted chocolate ice cream slightly warming being spooned into the mouth...thick. Hahahha! Seriously kinda like that. I feel that this is an easily drinkable beer, so coffee infused that it can become dangerous. It is much easier to drink than BCS. Whereas BCS is a sipper, this one is a much easier beer to drink, not as hot. Its still a sipper, yet it doesn't feel me like I've just taken a shot of bourbon....where if I did-after drinking some beer-I'd need a few minutes to gather myself...(thats how BCS feels sometimes). This beer feels and drinks much better. Altogether awesome, expensive, yet awesome! Would that it were a bit cheaper though.  edit: and with this beer I retire this glass...",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,frothyhead,4.72,"Pours a deep dark black into a snifter with a small brown that quickly fades. No light getting through this one.  Nose is chocolate, coffee, smoke, bourbon, oak/wood and alcohol. Some caramel and even a bit of nuttiness (peanuts?).  Mouthfeel is full bodied, thick and velvety, low carbonation. Slick and viscous. Very smooth with some dryness in the finish.  I was expecting this to be over the top, based on my general feeling toward Founders, but to my surprise the taste is so amazingly well balanced. Sweet vanilla up front, chocolate and coffee bitterness in the middle and fading out with a quick blast of hoppy bitterness as it coats the back of the throat. Some alcohol dryness and bite, but kept in check.  This is sublimely drinkable for what it is. 11.2% ABV just gets lost in the beauty of everything else and you find the glass draining all-too-quickly.  Overall this one lives up to the hype.

1199,19960,jminsc76,4.36,"I enjoyed this courtesy of a wonderful gentleman who brought it when he moved out to California from Illinois. He also brought Three Floyds' Dark Lord Imperial Stout, so we started with that, and then after experiencing complete beer jubilation, moved on to this (and experienced a second wave of jubilation). As I was slightly intoxicated from the Dark Lord I cannot comment too much on the look. All I remember is it pours a dark, oily body with slight head, but nothing too extravagant. It's aged two years, so a lot of the carbonation has subsided.  Strong aromas of rye, sawdust, and even oats. Momentarily felt like I was hanging out in a either honky-tonk bar or Irish Pub, you know, the kind with all the sawdust on the floor. Intriguing aromas, but I was not expecting sawdust.  The taste is similar to the smell: sawdust, oak, and oats, but also strong roasted coffee flavors. Keep in mind that my palate may have been a wee bit blunted as I was still reeling from the rich coffee/chocolate/molasses/whatever-else-is-present aromas and flavors of Dark Lord, so any of the molasses or chocolate that other reviewers are alluding to may have been knocked the *bleep* out of me. Perhaps I should have saved this for another night but what can I say? I was inspired from having two top-rated beers in my presence.  The woody, oak-y, and coffee aromas and flavors are the standouts here, and according to the gentleman who brought this to me, it's among the last of its kind.

S: Soft notes of oak and bourbon mingled with dark chocolate and coffee. Almost like a cold Irish coffee.  T: Taste is dominated by woody bourbon, coffee and semi-sweet chocolate. The three work flawlessly in harmony with one another, creating an almost singular flavor that's hard to pinpoint. Fairly strong roasted malt character. Comes off sweeter than the bottle's claim of 70 IBU's, but I'm not complaining. Alcohol is masked pretty well and serves to warm the throat and belly.  M: Big, oily and slick with a lower level of carbonation. Goes down very smooth for its ABV. Aftertastes are of coffee and bourbon.  D: A sipper to be certain, and opens up beautifully as it warms.  I fancy myself a cynic and a skeptic when it comes to beers as hyped and talked-about as this one, but it won me over in the end. A quite delicious brew that melds its flavors beautifully.

1199,19960,MacDomer,4.32,"I recently (~two weeks ago) had a bottle of 1 yr old '08 KBS and a fresh '09 KBS. Shout out to Andrew the manager at Binny's on North Ave. in Elmwood Park for hooking me up with the aged bottle! I'm having another bottle of the fresh '09 tonight and will attempt to review both...  Overall, I prefer the aged KBS to the fresh, at least this year - bourbon flavor was more forward in the '08, coffee a bit more muted, and flavors were better blended and overall richer. Both of these served in my Duvel tulip at about 58F.  Both pour thick and black in color with minimal head but a nice dark cap. There's dark chocolate aroma in both, a bit of nutiness, but the big difference was that the bourbon and vanilla was a lot bigger in the '08 and the coffee a lot bigger in the '09. The coffee in the '09 is a bit too much, actually, and I'm even a coffee drinker. I may wait another 3-6 months before revisiting this one in order to let the coffee ease a bit.  Both bottles were big a chewy up front and quite tasty. Lots of roast malt and chocoloate flavors. Same comments about the bourbon and coffee in the flavor department as I already said about the nose.  Mouthfeel on both is quite nice, with the '09 being a bit thinner than the '08. Still big and thick though. Carbonation is good.  Drinkability is good for the style, I could have another no problem.  Overall, a great beer.

Of course, I do believe this beer is much better than Guiness, but I as my introduction to the style, I always compare stouts to Guiness. The taste was very complex with that sense of bourbon barrel aging. Not as sweet as most imperial stouts I've had and it makes this beer much more tasty and more drinkable.

A good buddy (and fellow BA member) spotted a few bottles at The Foodery (Center City location) and was good enough to pick one up for me. He is truly a god amongst men.  After leaving it the basement for a couple weeks (in hopes of saving it for a special occasion), I noticed that this bad boy is actually a raging 11.2%, which made me even more excited to try it.  I poured this mythic ale into a brandy snifter, letting it sit for a few minutes before I dove in. It was colored the deepest black I'd ever seen with a creamy brown head and sizzling carbonation. The aroma was quite wonderful, bringing to mind everything from vanilla to after dinner liqueur to heavy cream. From first scent, its profound ABV is evident.  Flavor hits you like a ton of bricks, opening with roasted coffee bean and ending with vanilla and irish cream. I've never had a stout that is so well balanced and as it warms, a transcendent coffee flavor finishes with authority.  The beer coats the tongue with each sip with the sting of whiskey as it sinks. It's an absolutely terrific beer, but let's not kid ourselves. With its potency and big flavor, one or two is definitely enough.

I've been eagerly awaiting KBS' arrival ever since I found out that Founders was coming to NJ, and I surely wasn't disappointed. But just finding this beer alone, was an experience in itself. I traversed for dozens of miles across the state, asked around, begged and I fortunately finally found a retailer where I could purchase an entire 4-pack.  I poured an '09 bottle delicately into a snifter and it yielded a classic, yet subtlety striking, 'midnight mud'-brown typical of a fine Imperial Stout with a razor-thin burnt sienna head, that quickly subsidized.  The aroma was strong, yet complex. I noticed the coffee right away and then the chocolate. Next, mild bourbon danced in the background, followed by just the smallest hint of vanilla.  I knew I was in for a treat, as soon as it touched my lips. I would say the coffee and bourbon are the most distinct and crisp flavors which I noticed right away. The chocolate in the mid-pallete definitely harmonizes those two strikingly different flavors. The aftertaste definitely had the slight oak burn with a bit of smoke, which is soothed over by a gentle, but enjoyable vanilla. Overall, extremely complex and each flavor complimented the other.  In my mouth it felt a bit heavy, but was incredibly silky and not and smooth as it whirled around my palette, but completely lacking an oily characteristic. I savored every second of drinking it, and I did not want it to end, which is remarkable for a beer at this ABV.

Same with the taste, this is a monster of a beer. Dense and chewy, with all those stout flavors amped up to an incredible level. As it warmed the tastes continued to change with coffee, bourbon, and the malts being front and center at different times during the experience. It was a little sweet and I can't imagine having more then one of these. Honestly, to me, I like the Founders Breakfast Stout a little better, just because I find it more drinkable.

I wish they made candles that smelled like this.  T - Bourbon, chocolate and coffee. The coffee is by far the strongest flavor. The oak comes through in the aftertaste followed by a bit of burn. Not too much burn though. The lingering taste is just amazing.  M - Thick. Very Nice.  D - I'm trying not to house this thing. Must... be... strong. The high ABV is definitely not a problem here. Well hidden.  This is a great beer. Well worth the 5 hour drive to get a case.

1199,19960,RblWthACoz,4.5,"Thanks to Brewandbbq for an '08 bottle sent to me quite some time ago. The '09 I sampled directly afterwards is compliments of me.  For sh*ts and giggles sake, we're going to keep up with the tasting of ridonculous beers today. We did the Westys, now let's do the KBS.  Pours totally black with a thin tan head. Nose is whiskey, yes. Vanilla and boozy tones. Flavor is whiskey tones. Heavily influenced by the barrels, yes. I want to say I feel like it is interfering with the original Breakfast Stouts character. Feel is smooth on liquid and carbonation is slightly lower. This is nice and I certainly don't dislike it, but like I was saying: why mess with a damn good recipe?  For comparisons sake, I found the younger bottle of KBS much less ""Kentucky"" than Breakfast Stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Thin sticky lace after an aggressive swirl.  S - The nose is amazing, a powerful smell of dark chocolate up front, followed by espresso and a hint of bourbon. Another swirl and smell gives way to even more bourbon and some smokiness.  T - Chocolate, espresso, but mostly bourbon in the first mouthfull. The finish is an intense roasted bitterness. Alcohol creeps up on you and let's you know it's there. Definitely not too noticeable for 11.2%.  M - Just enough carbonation with an extremely creamy mouthfeel. The roasted bitterness lingers on the tongue for quite some time.  D - I really like this beer, but that's the difference between this and some other top notch imperial stouts I've tried. This beer makes me want another sip, but at the same time leaves me wanting more.

1199,19960,dancinwillie,4.67,"Had to edit this one: Big thanks to madtowndmb1 for helping me acquire this beer, much appreciated man, thanks a million!  Pours black, with an inviting coffee colored topper of foam, about a half an inch high, which drops pretty quickly, leaving a few bubbles here and there.  Vanilla, chocolate, and whisky are prominent in the nose, along with an underlying roasted quality. If the taste can back up the aroma, this should be good.  Wow! So much going on, it's a little overwhelming. Roasted grains, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, a rounded bourbon whisky flavor. I get some brown sugar in there as well. Coffee bitterness comes on strong at the end, and more so as it warms. Pleased to note that I'm not really noticing any apparent alcohol. Also, as I'm sure others have previously noted, my bottle ('09) reads ABV of 11.2%, while BA has it listed above at 10%.  Mouthfeel is full as full can be! Silky smooth, bitingly bitter, and definitely decadent.  I'm not a big fan of hype. I've sought out beer after beer, only to be let down and depressed. This is not the case here. This one is worth it. I'm about 5 ounces in, and I've got a nice warming feeling going on. I can't wait to try one of these in a year or two, although I seriously doubt that I will be able to wait that long.

1199,19960,FickleBeast,4.65,"1st review!  Well, it is about time I started to review beers - why not kick things off with an exceptional beer?  Poured into a Harpoon Winter Warmer Snifter  A: Pitch black, just a thin layer of dark foam after a vigorous pour. Completely opaque.  S: Coffee, oaky,  T: Roasted, charred coffee. Bourbon flavor up front, but quickly fades. Taste of black cherry pokes through the roast flavors. Waming alcohol taste at the end. Extremely complex. Roast bitterness lingers.  M: Viscous, coats your mouth, feels smooth, with some tannins felt at the back of the tongue  D: A sipper for sure, but the high abv goes down very smooth. The complexity makes me want to take another sip to see what other flavors develop as it warms.  Overall, fantastic. I don't care for the roast coffee bitterness that lingers, and there is a little too much alcohol warmth, but those are minor criticisms to an otherwise amazing beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Coats your throat.  d: Surprisingly easy to drink given the ABV.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ryrust5301,4.84,"Appearance - Charcoal black color which is so dense it looks like I just drained my cars oil pan into my glass. After pouring slick and still, it sprang to life just a little bit. A few tiny bubbles shot up in the middle and around the sides, to give it an almost golden ring around the top. Very tiny bit of lacing which is ample for the style. It didn't knock my socks off, but it was right where it needed to be.  Smell - One of the most dense noses you'll find on a beer. It's so hard to cut through everything! First things first, a hefty bourbon smell blended with vanilla and chocolate. The vanilla really helps smooth out the strong bourbon flavor and compliments the coffee notes which linger in the background quite well. Also a wonderful roasted scent in there, almost burnt. Anything but a 5 here would be an injustice!  Taste & Mouthfeel - What a great choice to blend the vanilla in with a bourbon heavy brew. The two flavors marry so well that i'm sure you could have a superb beer with just those two flavors. Of course Founders is going to throw so much more at you, and blow you away with a disgustingly well crafted and drinkable brew. Sweet chocolate seems to gush out around the vanilla, and holds you up as you're about to get hit with a bitter coffee roast. It's amazing how each and every flavor is sooo deep, yet nothing is taken away from any of them. For a beer which seems to be soaked in bourbon the alcohol doesn't really seem all that much, or bothersome to me. It just makes for an excellent sipper, and a beer that is best enjoyed shared. Only complaint is that the mouthfeel is a tad thin.  Drinkability - Such an exquisite beer, but one that could take quite some time to throw back if you were to drink the whole bottle yourself. I shared mine, and it was more than enough. What a beer! I've got four more to drink as well! This one is best enjoyed if you kick back, sip it, and let the whole experience wash over you.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ShrLSU,4.62,"Finally cracking open a bottle of the 2007 vintage I have had cellared for some time.  Appearance: Pours thick and black with a slight tan head that settled out quickly. Lacing is present but light, almost likt oily residue.  Smell: WOW...bourbon to the core! First scent I get is straight up bourbon and oak barrel. There is also a sweet chocolate scent followed by deep roasted malts.  Taste: Very woody as it first enters the mouth. There is a semi sweet chocolate whisp followed by bitterness and roasted malts. There is quite an alcoholic bite to this as it goes down. This has a fair amount of vanilla at the finish as well. This almost has the finishing taste of a strong white russian.  Mouthfeel: A thick and creamy feel over the lips as it settles in your mouth. As it breaks down the alcohol stings the tastebuds and it turns a bit oily as it goes down the throat.  Drinkability: The drinkability is high. This is everything its advertised as. Its definitely packing the bourbon punch. This is not for the casual beer drinker. Actually this beer is way to harsh for most people. It's extremely unique and oh so tasty, but you better split it with a friend. Either that or do not operate heavy machinary after drinking.

Aroma is at first a strong roasted coffee, like a Starbucks in the morning; but that gives way to a more powerful chocolate flavor, bitter and dark like a Russian chocolate bar, also lots of sweetness there, malty like cocoa malt and caramel, some faint hints of vanilla. Taste is thick and meaty, espresso and burnt hot cocoa dominate, nice bit or warming alcohol there that lets you know this is a big brew not to be trifled with. Aftertaste has some of the bourbon characteristics, very woody.  This is a very complex brew, as any RIS, eisbock or barley wine could be.

Took a few home, but had one at the bar. The pour is dark black - not as much of the toffee colored head that the non-barrel version has, but a little nonetheless. The nose has a ton of chocolate, with bourbon and vanilla coming to the forefront as the beer warms and relaxes. A bit of coffee roast in there as well. Taste is chocolate, coffee, and the nice bourbon kick. This is heaven - there are other BB stouts I enjoy a bit more, as I am a bourbon in my beer guy, but this is so balanced and smooth.

1199,19960,bamadog,4.02,"Extra special thanks goes out to Beerman207 for hooking me up with this - a very generous BA indeed! I'm sure someone else has also mentioned this, but the ABV listed on the site is 10% but the 2009 bottles have it listed as 11.2%. Poured from the bottle into a trusty pint glass. Overall, I feel like I was a little tougher on this beer based upon all of the hype about it. I'd like to note that this is definitely an outstanding product, not quite sure it lives up to everything that was being said, but yes, amazing nonethelss.  Appearance: Pours thick and black, pretty viscous but it doesn't seem quite as dense as the standard Breakfast Stout, but it's still thick. No light is coming through at all, exactly what I would expect. Very modest 1 finger dark tan head appears after a pretty hard pour, but it disappears just as quickly as it formed and falls to a thin uneven looking skim floating at the top. A fair amount of lacing, but on the swirl it has a very brief presence, and there is a much more present oily residue that sticks readily to the sides of the glass.  Smell: Deep dark malts, bitter-sweet chocolate and a pretty fair presence of alcohol. I'd like to note that this is an exceptional smell, but again, very reminiscent of the standard Breakfast Stout. Very good, but not making me think anything different or special about this beer yet.  Taste: Very good, and there is a definitely a nice bit of woodiness in the flavor, but still the dominant flavors are same as the scents that I picked up in the nose - strong dark/toasty malt presence and the bittersweet chocolate. The beer is running a little hot as well - alcohol is very present and I've gotta believe that some time in a cellar would do it worlds of good to cool down.  Mouthfeel: A little lighter than I thought it would be, a bit watery even. Overall it's still a pretty chewy beer, but I guess I was expecting something a bit more substantive. Overall, still pretty good in this department. My mouth is coated nicely initially, but the coating is really outdone by a strong drying and warm burn from the alcohol coming from the chest and throat as I exhale.  Drinkability: While it's outstanding, I don't think I'd want to sit through more than one of these in a night. It's a bit heavy (as stouts tend to be, duh...) and the ABV is pretty high. A very nice accompaniment to a desert, or may even just be a great desert on its own.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,nesta,4.01,"After falling in love with a fourpack of this last year, I was anxious to try this year's offering. I finally got my chance at a bar last night after failing to find any at all in the stores this year.  This bar offers a lot of very nice beers, but like most bars I've visited everything is served ice cold. I can't envision drinking this beer at anything much lower than room temperature, but I had to make do. I had it served out of the fridge in a Rochefort glass.  This year's brew is stronger than last, at a whopping 11.5%ABV. Perhaps the temperature interfered with the flavor profile too much, but the coffee flavor was very overwhelming, and made it nearly impossible to discern the flavor acquired by aging the beer in bourbon barrels.  It was a good brew, but seemed a lot less special to me than it did last year in terms of flavor. With no carbonation and such a strong coffee character, it resembled iced coffee more than beer. The one thing that remains the same is the effect of the beer on me. I have had stronger beers than this before, yet Founder's Kentucky Breakfast Stout feels as if it is the single most intoxicating beer I have ever consumed. Before the end of the glass it was taking a strong hold on me (granted, I'd had a glass of Bell's Two Hearted before this) with a boozy and virtually narcotic effect.  All things considered, this is still an amazing, world-class stout, but last year's was better, not to mention less expensive as well.  The appearance was thick, dark black and almost oily. Poured without much caution straight down into the glass rendered no head, and not more than a few tiny bubbles. The crisp coffee flavor made the brew a bit more drinkable and helped to overcome the extremely thick mouthfeel, as did the refrigeration. I would like to try this at room temperature on Friday if they still have some, to see if that makes a difference.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,msolar,4.06,"The concept of this beer is really intriguing - and the oak bourbon barrels really leave their mark. Unfortunately, it's a bit too much. The first 4 ounces were nice - the rest was slow. There's a really strong presence of oak and bourbon which, if you like bourbon, is a really nice change from most beers.  I wouldn't purchase this beer again but I'm really glad I had the opportunity to try it. Founder's remains one of my favorite brewers and this is certainly a very well executed beer... just not the one for me.

Pours bitch black that cannot be seen through even when it is held directly up to a light source. No head to speak of, just a thin dark brown lacing at the top.  Very strong coffee beans up front. I would even say that it smells more along the lines of espresso beans. Dark chocolate, and alcohol phenols stand out significantly as well. I can detect breaded malts of course the bourbon barreled aroma in the undertone. Doesn't stand out as much as I thought it would, but it is still a great smelling brew.  The taste falls right in line with the nose. Pungent coffee bean flavors will attack the pallet right away. Dark chocolate, vanilla, and breaded malts come through as well. The bourbon bourbon barrel flavor makes the alcohol phenols stand out almost as significantly as the coffee bean flavors.  Mouthfeel is full-bodied, smooth and complex. There's a lot going on with this beer, enough so that I couldn't completely figure it out.  An excellent offering by Founders.

Little head retention but some lacing.  Smell: Fairly complex yet I can tell all of these wonderful notes will come together superbly with time. A touch of alcohol, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, etc.  Taste: Vanilla up front, giving way to coffee then chocolate, finished with a touch of hops and alcohol. Not boozy or really hot but a touch warm I'd say.  Mouthfeel: thinner than I expected....medium to med-full bodied.  Drinkability: Good considering its 10% abv and medium to med-heavy body.

I poured the beer into a medium snifter/tulip shaped glass which was the perfect size. The temperature was a bit too cold so I planned on letting it sit and or warming with my hands for a bit. I tried to achieve a modest head but couldn't get anything significant, perhaps by design as this is not intended for this type of beer or particular Imperial Stout (A=4.5).  Not much in the way of aroma, perhaps an actual snifter as opposed to the tulip shaped rim would have concentrated the aroma more acutely (S=4.5).  Taste was incredible. Complex, dynamic and rich. Espresso, bourbon, dark chocolate and oak on the palate. Perfect amount of bite on the finish which was extremely long (T=5.0).  Mouthfeel was perfectly thick and velvety; coated the whole palate (M=5.0).  With such a high ABV (11.2) this beer drank incredibly smooth.

Taste: roasted malts, big vanilla flavor, dark chocolate, prunes, hints of bourbon, and a nice bitterness. Alcohol is mildly noticeable. Superbly balanced flavors here.  Mouthfeel: medium-heavy in body. Smooth and thick feeling throughout. Long aftertaste as the flavors stick to the tongue and last awhile.

Man do I love the taste of this big ass brew. This is what I was looking for when first tasted DarkLord and the Abyss...this one wins hands down.  Big and rich in the mouth, full of body yet spirit like with it's high alcohol. The bitterness lingers and the warmness grows long after the swallow.

Very intense bourbon and sugary sweetness. Alcohol is pretty pronounced toward the end. I think this would flourish under a year's cellaring. A bit rough and raw right now. A year would likely bump this to a 5. My other bottle is going into the cellar for sure.  M = Huge mouthfeel here. Thick and sticky sweet. It gets all over you and never lets go. Very intense.  D = This can't possibly be considered drinkable. Mega sweet and boozy, a slow sipper for sure. More than one of these would put me down for the count and leave my mouth numb.

Nice thick black presentation with a very thin head of cocoa brown. No highlights except for around the rim.  Smell is goood! The bourbon is up front, but not overpowering. One of the subtler bourbon scents I've had in a bourbon-barrel stout. Maple syrup, coffee, chocolate & vanilla -- it's all in there.  The taste is right in hand with the aroma, though I'd say the bourbon is even a little more ""subdued"" (speaking relatively here, folks). The coffee flavors are more prominent, roasty & dark, with an increasing alcohol presence. Lately I'm starting to notice a ""crayon"" taste in coffee stouts, which is definitely showing up here.  Mouthfeel is thick & satisfying, like a drink of boozy brownie. As strong as this is, it's relatively low ABV for a bourbon-barrel stout, & I think I could down two of these in a relaxed, stretched out evening.

This is the kind of stuff people leave their families for. My buddy and I accidently stumbled on it in Weymouth, MA after looking for the stuff for weeks. It did not disappoint. It pours like crude oil and has a very warm and inviting smell. The complexity of this beer is through the roof. The bourbon barrels give it a beautiful vanilla taste that's mixed with coffee and chocolate. Although it's thicker than the regular breakfast stout, somehow it's smoother and has a mellow but lingering aftertaste.

No noticeable head. Sticky, but not particularly viscous.  Nose is interesting - big espresso, brown sugar, light vanilla and bourbon, some baker's chocolate down deep. Espresso is the foundation that everything else seems to wrap around, the rest of the aromas are complementary. Just a bit boozey and rough around the edges. Really nice, like a super dark bourbon-fudge cake soaked in espresso.  Taste also orients itself around the dark espresso note in the center. A bit boozey up front, with notes of bourbon, vanilla, cocoa, and brown sugar wrapping around the espresso core; both the espresso and the bourbon seem to have a rough edge to them. Some alcohol bite at the back of the throat. A nice beer, but definitely feels a bit young and green at this point. Could use a bit of time to mature.  Mouthfeel is thick, very lightly carbonated, and with noticable prickliness from the alcohol.  For what it is, it's nicely drinkable.

The oak, bourbon flavour comes through in the background with a hint of alcohol as well. A chocolate flavour comes through the nose at the end, which is quite pleasing. The nose is simply ace. The colour is black as pitch, with a decent sized brown/tan head, that dissipates fairly quickly. I'd say, the only down fall with this beer and the breakfast stout is the head because I want it to stick around longer.  When drinking this beer, all I can think is, ""wow!"" This is truly and utterly the most tasty beer I've ever had. The coffee bitterness comes through initially, but a huge beautiful dark chocolate flavour shines through at the end. Somewhere in the middle the bourbon flavour mingles, making the two flavours that much better. There is such a great balance to the beer, that all I can do sit back, sip and smile. There is a tad bit of alcohol that comes through, but that is to be expected with an 11% beer.  The mouthfeel on the beer is thick like motor oil, but this adds to the chocolate flavour that lingers in your mouth. This is a beer that can be sipped on all night long, mainly because the flavour is so balanced. Best beer I've had to date.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Pauly2X,4.47,"Thanks to prototypic for this, one hell of an ""extra""  A- Viscous opaque black, thin wispy head went away as fast as it appeared.  S- Lots of chocolate and coffee aromas. Very powerful and assertive.  T- Alot of the harsh aromas in the nose mellow out in the taste. The chocolate and malt flavors are generaly dominate, but coffee is evident as well. The bourbon sneaks in the suprisingly light and smooth finish.  M- Wonderfully thick and viscous.  D- Disspite the strength this goes down without a fight.  A fantastic stout by any measure. It is even more enjoyable if you love coffee. Personally it falls a little short of the hype. Still worth doing what you can to get your hands on some.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,TheBierBand,4.45,"Well, I must say that I got sticker shock when I picked up the 4 pack of this stuff today. Party Source in Bellview, KY: 4 pack of 12 oz bottles: $23.95! OUCH! But, you only go around once in this life so....  I poured the contents into my trusty pint glass. I noticed right away that it would take a rough pour to produce any head.... so I raised the bottle up and was gratified with a healthy inch of tight tan foam. The beer was as black as the night and you couldn't even see through it when held to a bright light source. The head slowly dwindled down to a thick cap over time, but left healthy stickage down the side of the glass as I drank.  The smell was very apparent and nice! Lot's of coffee, bourbon, chocolate all swirling around.... very nice!  The taste: Very surprising.... I could definately pick up on the bourbon barrel aging.... big bourbon taste right up front. But, the taste was quickly tempered by some nice rich coffee and sweet roasted malty taste.  Mouthfeel: Here is where this beer excels. This is a thick, chewey beer.... just like I like it. Gotta give it a ""5"".  Drinkability: This is definately a sipper.... but ya gotta try this stuff.... just bite the bullet and go for it. (Was I ripped off at 6 bucks a bottle?). I at least had to do it once. I probably won't beat a path to the beer store to pay $6 a bottle again.... but I HAD TO TRY IT. I was glad I did.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,goethean,4.5,"Not caramelly. Not hugely bodied. Very strong, stiff bourbon + fresh roasted coffee aroma, which mostly obscures the roasted fruit flavors. Not excessively boozey. Finish is a wonderful bourbon/coffee melange. Very little hop presence.  My guess is that there was some bourbon left in the barrels when the beer was racked into them. Otherwise, I don't see how you get this much bourbon flavor in the beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Big, boozy coffee, chocolate, vanilla nose. Hints of spicy licorice and bitter-sweet roasted malt. Huge. Alcohol dominates and wraps all the intense flavors underneath one blanket.  Big roasty and chocolately sweet up front, followed by bruising alcohol and hop presence. Finishes with a vanilla breath, licorice aftertaste. Big bodied, huge, with nice round feeling  An understatement to call it a sipper, but really nice over a good long session.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,duke1258,5,"Great vanilla aromas up front with a bit more forward hops this year, but still the warm malty end taste. Just as smooth as always, and more complex than the standard Breakfast Stout. There is a depth to this beer beyond just the Barrel aging. Definitely more bold Whiskey than other aged beers and yet very subtle alcohol.  I had this on tap once again at Founders and was offered a sample of the Canadian Breakfast Stout, aged in Maple Syrup Barrels, and found it to be a great twist on the KBS, though a bit sweeter. Still the best beer in the world, KBS is progressively becoming even better.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Gyle41386,4.65,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Love the twist top.  Pours black with a very thin brown chocolate head. ""Motor oil"" and ""ink"" get thrown around too much when describing viscous, black beers, but it's appropriate to do so here.  Ground coffee in the nose. Subtle hints of oak and bourbon. I was worried the nose may be dominated by booze, but it's not even close. Very nice.  Wow, this tastes great. I'm not a coffee guy, and even I love the taste of KBS. Roasted malt, coffee, and bittersweet chocolate take the early lead. I really like the oak underneath the other flavors. The bourbon is delicious, and not at all overpowering. Great finish. No hot boozy feel in the mouth, either.  The only hint of alcohol I really get is the nice warming sensation. Full body. Really coats the mouth nicely. I wrote in another review that a particular beer coated the mouth like a tasty cough syrup. This is the same. Just a great feel.  This is a really fantastic beer. I'm glad I was able to try it. That said, one is enough. It's delicious, but it's definitely a slow sipper, and the ABV will keep me from over-indulging. Hopefully I'm able to buy another single or two to share with friends, because, unfortunately, the $20 price tag on a four pack is almost out of the question after already buying three of them.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I'm not saying this is a terrible beer, but I just don't think its as good as advertised. I tasted the bourbon, vanilla, and coffee. The mixture just tasted a bit off to me.

Recommended to me by a good friend. Poured into my new Stone imperial pint glass. This beer is a very dark brown color. The tan brown head is about 2/3 inch when poured. Settles to a decent surface coating with a nice thick ring lining the inside of the glass. Good lacing. Aromas of vanilla, bourbon, chocolate and coffee are very nice indeed! Flavors of vanilla, caramel and chocolate upfront, followed by roasted malt and bitter coffee, and a bit of bourbon. The sweeter flavors do tend to come about more. Very good! Has a very smooth, creamy, slightly crisp, full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Very easy to drink especially as it starts to warm up. Wow! I have to admit I was quite impressed. Better than I expected as I have thoughts that a lot of Founders beers are overhyped, still good, but overhyped. This one lived up to the hype. One of the smoothest beers I have ever had.

1199,19960,Yetiman420,4.46,"Poured into my trusty Unibroue tulip glass in the low 40's.  Black. Thin chocolate milk head with irregularly sized bubbles - larger ones toward the side of the glass.  Aroma is mostly coffee grinds with a punch from either bourbon or alcohol or perhaps the combination of both.  Follow up sniffing reveals a bit more roasted malt and some chocolate.  First sip. Damn it's good. Thick, full, and chewy and incredibly well balanced. For 10% there is a moderate touch of heat on the finish. Nothing major and a great reason to taste this over time.  Exceptional mouthfeel (5) - in fact, on it's own, this stands as an incredibly noteworthy beer for this aspect.  This is the fourth time I've had this beer in the past year and I'm consistent impressed (including nitro tap at the brewery).",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,PrinceDarren,4.31,"Excited to find a bottle at Brixies!  Due to rarity and hype, I thought KBS would be comparable to FFFs Dark Lord. I was way wrong. This is much more delicate (whereas the latter is brutually massive).  Flashback: On cool winter nights, I like to enjoy a glass of hot chocolate with a couple of shots of Irish Whiskey while watching a bad DVD rental. KBS reminded me a lot of those evenings. The best way to describe it would be as follows: 1) go to Starbucks and buy a mocha latte 2) add an extra shot of espresso 3) add too much extra chocolate syrup 4) put it in the fridge until its cold 5) toss in a shot or two of bourbon. Congratulations, you've just created a glass of Founder's Kentucky Breakfast Stout.  KBS is a little weak on the nose, a light aroma of bourbon is to be expected, but there is not much more than that. It is surprisingly drinkable - no need to share it with a friend - you'll want to hog it all to yourself anyway. It is not so much a ""beer"" as it is a ""dessert drink"". I could sip on this any night of the week, after a full meal, and feel full and content.  Bottom line: KBS is a fine dessert beverage that I, personally, won't soon part with $10 to try again (not in the near future anyway). I do look forward to trying this when it is tapped at Bavarian Lodge.  Now excuse me while I head over to Applebee's and order a mudslide.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,dpuia,4.79,"2009 bottle poured into a Chimay snifter. Pours rich dark color with no head. The smell is full of fresh ground coffee, nice and aromatic. The taste is like no other, best way I can describe it is take a mild IPA, and mix it with an iced coffee, with a smoked wood overtone. This beer is so thick you can nearly chew it. Drinkability is not exceptional for one reason, high ABV and smooth taste, can be a dangerous combination.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,craytonic,3.33,"Bottle from last year's release, so just a little over a year old.  Appearance: Like motor oil, I put it directly next to a light bulb and nothing got through my snifter. Nice coffee foam, almost no lacing.  Smell: Mostly old coffee and lots of dark malts, barely any bourbon, I wish it was the other way around. It is actually more alcohol than bourbon - barely any of the molasses, vanilla, etc I would like to smell.  Taste: Old coffee, lots of licorice, soot, charcoal, dark malts, fudge, blackstrap molasses, and hardly any bourbon. Something burnt. I really don't get the reviews saying the alcohol is concealed - on both the aroma and taste I get raw, pure alcohol smacking my nose and tongue like a 2x4. Let me clarify that is alcohol, not bourbon I taste.  Mouthfeel: A little grainy, I couldn't help but think of sand or used coffee grits.  Drinkability: Definitely a sipper, the coffee and raw alcohol are overpowering.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,AleDrinkToThat,4.97,"I think I can honestly say that this is my favorite stout ever. I've got to give a BIG shout to rockstarnati who traded this to me...as an EXTRA! Thanks a million, dude.  Appearance: Poured into my DFH snifter. After bringing the pour a literal FOOT high from the glass, there was a milk chocolate-brown 1/2 finger head. I swear, this stuff would look like a tiny dark spot against the backdrop of space. Light simply does dot penetrate into this beer.  Smell: I work at a coffee chain and have to smell coffee at its freshest and at its most stale states. I'm not easily impressed by coffee-infused stouts. Really only Peche Mortel has knocked my socks off in that regard. Well, it's been dethroned. There's a sublime aroma of chocolatey coffee beans here, with a nice oak underbelly and the slightest hint of bourbon. I'm salivating.  Taste: The perfection of the balance among the flavors and body is impressive, to say the very least. The roasted malt and coffee notes hit immediately, but very quickly open up to reveal deep, semisweet chocolate and oak flavors. The bourbon is still only a pleasant hint, and it hits closer to the finish and in the aftertaste. I'm in love.  Mouthfeel: Thick and viscous, in the most beautiful way. My mouth almost feels coated with a film from all this mature malt. The carbonation is extremely low but it seems better for that. There's no cloying sweetness, but the semisweet chocolate notes do make my sweet-sensitive taste buds perk up a little. There is very little alcohol fuming in the finish, which is amazing considering the 11.2% ABV and the bourbon remnants.  Drinkability: This is surely a ""sip slowly and savor the hell out of it"" beer. For stout lovers, this is that dusty little wooden cup hidden among all the jeweled chalices. Shamelessly drinkable. Just watch yourself, or you will get sucked into the black hole of intoxication. Which is probably almost as dark as this beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Chocolate, coffee and bourbon flavors are perfectly balanced. Alcohol falls just short of overpowering. I doubt my craving for this beer will ever stop. Reminds me of when I had my ""aha"" moment with an IPA. I went on a hop binge for years.

Smells of bourbon, vanilla, caramel, molasses, chocolate, and coffee. Tastes of caramel and dark chocolate up front then some coffee and roasted malt character. To follow is some vanilla and bourbon warmth then an espresso bean finish. Full in body with low carbonation. Silky smooth with a nice thick chewiness and a soothing bourbon warmth that compliments the other flavors and doesn't become too overpowering. A fantastic brew, but a little too much to want to enjoy often. Definitely worth breaking out for special occasions though.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,PrAndo,4.97,"The best beer I've ever had? Only time will tell. But for today, it might win that honor. The best stout I've ever had? Yup. It does all the things I want a stout to do for me in spades. Lately I'd grown a little stout weary, but I think that it's safe to say that this fine brew has rejuvinated my enthusiasm for the variety.  The appearance won me over at first glance. It didn't just poor like motor oil, it poured like it was the last 1/4 of coffee in the coffee pot that had been left to cook on the burner all day. That black. That thick. There is a bit of a head, but not much and it sure doesn't stick around long. For the time it is present, enjoy it it's mocha brown and a little foamy.  The smell eminating from that glass is intoxicating. It ""had me at hello"". It smells of cocoa and black coffee. Really, it's almost like the smell of the Hershey's chocolate syrup that you put on top of your ice cream.  When it comes to taste, there's not just a little of it and it doesn't last for a short time. It's got taste for days. It taste like it looks and like smells. I first notice a hint of bourbon, followed by the warmth of the alcohol, though it doesn't really taste of alcohol even considering the high ABV. Coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and all the while kind of reminding me of a well stirred glass of Nestle Quick. Even after you've taken a good pull, you taste it in your mouth for a long time.  Mouthfeel: heavy, warm, thick, smooth.  Drinkability: I'd certainly save room for a second (or a third...).

1199,19960,btuthill,4.3,"Pours jet black from stubby 12 oz. bottle. Very small tan head fades immediately to a thin skin of bubbles. Smell is of roasted coffee beans and charred oak with a hint of sweet bourbon. Taste is dominated by coffee up front. Warm and roasty. The coffee is followed by a strong vanilla presence - very smooth and a welcome change from the roasted coffee. There is a hint of oak as it finishes, before returning to a strong vanilla and bourbon aftertaste. The finish is the most enjoyable aspect of the flavor profile. Although I don't think the flavor is perfect, I do appreciate the melding of flavors and general complexity of this beer. The mouthfeel is good - a little thinner than desired with a bit more carbonation than I expected. This is a highly drinkable beer, as long as you can find it and afford it. The complex flavors keep you from drinking too much of this 10% goodness too quickly.  A nice offering from Founder's, but I am frankly a bit disappointed. As a sucker for bourbon-aged stouts, I expected a bit more out of this one. I particularly would have liked the barrels to mellow a bit of the roasted coffee flavor, but it wasn't to be. I don't think it holds a candle to my personal favorite, Goose Island Bourbon County Stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Towards the end, dark forest fruits. Blackberry, currant.  M: Sort of tingly carbonation, the alcohol burns a little. Very dry. Almost characteristic of red wine.  D: It takes a long time to properly drink and enjoy. You wouldn't want more than one at once, but it's not intended like that.

1199,19960,Imperial313,4.65,"This is my first review, I'm glad it's a KBS!  After pouring this black espresso looking beer into a snifter, I noticed a dark brown head that only lingered for a little bit. It's a 11.2% beer so I was not surprised.  The aroma is a very strong coffee mixed with malt and dark chocolate. The bourbon is present with some vanilla lingering at the end. I think the bourbon complemented everything and at the same time over powered.  Your taste buds are hit with coffee mixed with intense malt followed by a high bitterness, at the same time you are always followed by the bourbon. At the finish there is a lingering of warmth and a little vanilla/chocolate barrel.  The mouthfeel is full bodied that gives way to low carbonation but laces your throat with goodness.  Overall, KBS has changed form last year. I think the bourbon comes out more adding a different dimension. However, this is a marvelous beer that I enjoyed till the last drop.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smell has a lot of nice things going for it. All kinds of malts smells, dominated by chocolate coffee malts. There is also a nice bourbon smell, but not the overbearing alcohol smell that I was expecting. Taste is very nice and gets better as the drink gets warmer. The taste is dominated by good chocolate malts and also some smoky roasted malts, too. Good taste of dark plum-like fruits and a tinge of good bourbon also. Mouthfeel is awesome. The feel has a nice thickness and still retains a velvety smoothness in the sip. Drinkability is as good as it gets on this beer. I had heard this was one of the best beers available (or somewhat available), but I had no idea how smooth and drinkable it would be.

Very dark, but slightly creamy looking. Very thin head due to 5 oz. pour. Smells strongly of coffee and has slight bourbon hints. The strongest taste is the coffee/espresso flavor. It's a warm punch in the face. At the back of the taste comes the more pointed bourbon flavor. It's lovely. Some vanilla flavor as well ties this stout up quite well. The mouthfeel is amazing.

Taken out of the DBF and allowed to warm up for about 45 minutes. Poured from a 12 ounce stubby bottle into my Duvel tulip glass. I poured about 3/4 of the bottle, swirled up the yum-yums from the bottom of the bottle, and vigorously poured the remaining few ounces into the snifter. Appears a deep, dark, opaque blackish brown color with a solid two fingers of creamy dark ecru head. The head fades in about two minutes down to a 1/4 inch layer leaving a nice lace on the glass. Smells of bourbon soaked cocoa powder, vanilla beans, molasses, a touch of roasted coffee, and oak/wood. Tastes of bitter baking chocolate squares, smooth bourbon, black coffee, cocoa powder, vanilla, caramelized malts, a bit more bourbon, dark chocolate, and mocha. I'll admit, I was expecting this to be truly full bodied. It didn't seem it to me. It was still rich and satisfying, but just didn't seem as thick as I was hoping for. Medium in carbonation. Alcohol is completely hidden at this point. I prefer ""regular"" Breakfast Stout once or twice a month.

Also some bourbon, burtn malts and some residual sweetness in the smell (bitter chocolate, caramel). A mix of coffee and burnt malts and oak/wood lead to a dryish feeling w/ this beer, but overall it is smooth and creamy with a sweet taste thanks to the chocolate and vanilla in there. Even a hint of hops in the backend, although this beer is about the malts. The 10% ABV is not overpowering but instead compliments the beer as it lets it warm the tongue and prickles the tongue on the backend.

Leaves minimal lacing.  Aroma is pretty heavy on the coffee like the regular breakfast stout, though there is a definite bourbon presence with some substantial vanilla as well. A bit of dark chocolate in the nose as well, plus some alcohol.  The taste starts off with coffee and bourbon right off the bat then come some vanilla and charred oak flavors, with the coffee still lingering on into the finish. The coffee flavor is met by some dark chocolate in the finish as well, then a slight hot bourbony taste that stays on the breath.  Mouthfeel is full but not really thick or oily. Very creamy though and easy drinking considering what it is.  ---  2009 Bottle:  Appearance is pitch black - doesn't get much darker than this. A three-quarter inch dark tan head forms on top after a straight pour.This one just looks thick. Doesn't leave much lacing as a result.  Aroma is a great blast of coffee mostly. I'm thinking Breakfast Stout on steroids. The coffee isn't all though. There's a big dark chocolate component that kind of reminds me of mocha espresso. The bourbon aging almost doesn't come through at all since the coffee is so strong. It's more of a boozy aroma than bourbon in particular. Seems to lack the vanilla that I noted in last years version.  Taste is really heavy on the coffee and chocolate instantly with the bourbon complexity coming in right at the beginning of the swallow. There's definitely some oak and bourbon flavor coming through, and unlike the aroma I'm now picking up some vanilla. Finish brings a bit of alcohol warmth but it's surprisingly drinkable.  Mouthfeel is pretty much perfect. It's full and thick but it has such a great soft and creamy feel it's hard to describe.  I think I like this years version slightly better than last years, but overall they're not as different as some people seem to be claiming. I'm loving the coffee in this one, as the one I had last time was about 9 months old and the coffee had probably faded a bit. I still prefer GI BCS in the barrel aged beer category, but this is certainly one to be reckoned with.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Gigantis,4.18,"And I thought I'd never try it! I found a 4-pack of ""KBS"" (apparently that's what it goes by now) and finally got to have this very very well-regarded beer. Poured it into my snifter glass...  It poured the darkest brown possible. Motor oil in a glass. I poured fairly aggressively and the smallest head bubbled up after every last drop had been transferred to the glass. The only thing I can compare the head to is a tar pit. Imagine if you will a woolly mammoth sinking into the dark pit and then, after sinking, the last we see of the extinct beast are the bubbles rising to the top of the tar pit. That's the head of KBS; blink, and you'll miss it. Small amount of lacing on the glass... just dark, brown bubbles clinging ever so briefly.  The smell is incredible. Hands down one of the most aromatic stouts I've ever had the pleasure of putting my nose to. Chocolate, coffee with a vanilla bourbon/oak back... and even some deep, rich fruit aromas linger.  The taste is also impressive. Big, bold sweet AND bitter dark chocolate (if you don't like chocolate I really can't recommend this). At first, it tastes a little like a coffee liquor but it is certainly more than that. A little too sweet at first but by the time I was on my fourth sip I was getting waves of the smallest hop flavor and faintest hint of booze that served to balance out the cakey richness very well. Definitely one of those journey beers where each sip is a little bit different.  The lack of carbonation (accompanied by the sometimes overly sweet taste) was an itty bitty problem for me. The mouthfeel is actually very good in the sense that it is oh so smooth and oily... it coats your mouth perfectly. Thick - but not too thick.  It's hard to rate KBS' drinkability. On the one hand, this beer is not intended to be a session beer. On the other: is a truly great beer not intended to make you want another one on some level? I can honestly say that, while I enjoyed the KBS I had quite a lot, I did not immediately following its consumption really want another. It was real smooth though, like dark silk gravy.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,padan7,4.29,"This is an update to my 09 review a 5. Not the same beer from 09. The taste is unbalanced and not what it once was. So sad this is not as much of a disapointment as Hopslam( a complete letdown the last three years) Enjoy perfection when you notice.    Big thanks to Howard (wearing the green kilt) for being a beer angel and directly us to where we could buy KBS. Brewery ran out of 150 cases in less than 2 hours.  OK...I am fortunate to have had the 09 KBS on Nitro-tap & on tap at the brewery. Have not cracked the 09 bottles yet.  This review is for the nitro. $6 for 8 ounces. Not a cheap date.  Great looking, black & mysterious, but there are alot of hotties in the craft world these days.  Wonderful aroma and fun to go sniffing for vanilla & bourbon.  Taste of the nitro is relaxed. It goes down so easy it is truly dangerous. Flavors dance. Bourbon flavor seemed somewhat subdued compared to the draft & the 08 bottle.  Mouthfeel is pure velvet with less slick.  Drinkability- I could drink 4 of these easy. Not a cheap date. Would definetly need a taxi or a sleepover.  If you are within a days drive....hope to see you and Howard there in 2010.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

This beer is so smooth and yummy i dont even have the words. And the higher ABV isnt notisable at all.

1199,19960,BierFan,4.3,Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass. No date is given on the bottle but I know that this is from the 2009 release.  Appearance: A hard pour managed to get me a 2 finger brown head. The body is pitch black of course.  Smell: Lots of the oak bourbon barrel in the aroma. Chocolate and coffee have have mellowed and blended with the oaky smell during the aging process.  Taste: I was thinking that so far the appearance and smell have failed to live up to the hype but the taste is really amazing. Even a tiny sip gives way to an explosion of flavor. Oak and bourbon are especially dominant on the finish. Bitter dark chocolate provides a nice sweetness.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ColForbinBC,4.63,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter; 2009 Vintage  Pours a viscous deep, dark brown, almost black. After an aggressive pour, the cocoa brown head rose very little and subsided rather quickly. A thin, bubbly collar forms around the edges and leaves strings and dots of lace in its wake.  Bourbon fills the air. I can smell it from an arms length away. I get coffee off the bat, with vanilla, oak, bourbon and bittersweet chocolate rounding out the nose. Not very deep, or broad, but what it does, it does well.  The bourbon flavors attack you first. Vanilla, oak and booze, but then the booze subsides quickly and the coffee and chocolate take over. The finish is a combination of all of the above. Very enjoyable.  I've had very few beers that can compare with the slickness of this beer. Velvety smooth but not overly thick. Leaves an oil slick coating the mouth. Delicious.  You know, this beer is pretty big and bad, but it plays nice. The vanilla and coffee do an excellent job of keeping the booze at bay. With all that going on, it isn't nearly as thick as I would have thought.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,brianlg,4.75,"After searching all over the place I finally got a 4 pack of this! Pours a coffee black with a one finger fluffy chocolate milk head. It smells much like oak, coffee, and chocolate. The taste is just insane! It starts off with oak barrels and some bitterness. Then you can taste the coffee, bourbon and malts. It finishes with a hint of chocolate and vanilla. The after taste is a mix between chocolate milk and coffee. This is incredible! The mouthfeel is thick and chewy. It laces the throat on the way down. No wonder this is in the top 10 beers in the world. KBS is just.. (near) perfect. Drinkability, I couldn't have too many of these in a row (and wouldn't want to due to the price OUCH), but I wish I had these around all year long.

1199,19960,brokenleadedcask,4.69,"I'm glad I waited until my second experience to review this one, liked it better in the pint glass than the snifter.  A- Pitch black, very minimal head even with a hard pour  S- Caramel, bourbon, vanilla, and espresso  T- Espresso, tastes like un-brewed coffee beans smell. Is just a touch hot and would age exceptional  M- Thick and chewy but nice and smooth at the same time  D- A little high to have more than one at a sitting, amazing sipper. If the hype machine wasn't in full effect it'd be easier to get.  Edit 2010: Drove up to GR for the release, luckily my girlfriend jumped out of the truck & got in line as I got the second to last case. In conscience I couldn't buy the last two cases even though friend was disappointed.

1199,19960,IBUnit63,4.53,"For lunch on a day off I hit Sunset in the hops that KBS would be on tap. Lo and behold...served up in a sniftah...  Pours with a deep dark 2-finger head probably milk chocolate/brown sugar in color. Body is espresso brown/black and opaque as can be. Lacing is prevalent and quite viscous, creating nice trails on the inside of the snifter. The bourbon chocolate/coffee nose has a pleasant dryness to it that works well with the expected copious oak and good piney hop profile. Sure, there's creamy sweetness as well but it's dialed back just a bit to keep the balancing act in check.  Bittersweet is the theme carrying the day - sweet chocolate, vanilla and bourbony oak slithers down the palate with a brick shithouse of a malt backbone to meet a drier texture - not quite slate but well-balanced coffee and more of a baker's version of chocolate. Slight alcohol burn? Maybe just a bit. Quite complex indeed but everyone's in this one together.  I can't complain about any of this too much. While there's a certain dryness to it on one level, I found that the sweetness is still there but more balanced than in the bottle. This is so creamy on the palate it's not funny.  This is like Barry White - wayyy too smooth for its weight class. For such a high-octane ABV wallop it primes the pump very nicely.

1199,19960,raninator84,4.9,"Savored in bottle that I found at Miami Valley Liquor and wine in Huber Heights Ohio, thanks to Sohio for giving me the heads up.  Pours thick and dark, only a very subtle head on this one that fades as quick as it comes. Lacing is smooth and light. Smell is amazingly complicated, hints of coffee bean, vanilla, raisin, orange peel, chocolate, bourbon, hops, and strong alcohol. Breathe it in, for it is heavenly. Taste is the shock of more complexity, hit with a strong coffee and bourbon with a nice and subtle burning, and as it uses every bit of your taste buds, gently rolls through fruits and vanilla, still with a prevalent bourbon flavor. As the nectar slowly falls into slumber a burst of chocolate comes flowing up from the depths like a long lost love. As the moment subsides the taste lingers with hops and then every flavor awakens again, but only for a moment.  Wow, I understand the hype and it has delivered. If you can find it, please buy it. A decision you are unlikely to regret.  Cheers",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,Klgkenny,4.75,"WOW! This is a tasty mothafucka!  If you have ever drained the transfer case on a thirty year old pickup truck, then you know how this one looks. Thick, viscous, 65w oil.  Smells like heaven. Coffee, coffee, bourbon, coffee, dark fruit, coffee, roasted malt, coffe, dark chocolate, vanilla, and a hint of coffee. From the time I cracked the cap on this bottle, the smell hit my nose. Wonderfully pungent and overpowering!  Generally, I am not a fan of the bourbon barrel aged beers. With the KBS, that huge coffee flavor balances the bourbon perfectly. It is oh-so-smooth! Again, I say, ""that's a tasty mothafucka!""  For a beer that poured so thick, it seems just a tiny bit thin. Not thin in comparison with a normal stout, but thin for such a highly touted brew. It's big in the mouth, but I always want just a little more...  As for drinkability, the high abv, price, and availability keep this from being a 5.

1199,19960,twelvsies,3.85,"I hate to knock this beer, but I'm going to. Starts out fine, a good looking stout and smells great - dense malt and overtones of the mentioned coffee and vanilla, as well as the bourbon. The taste is where it goes south, sadly. I found this beer to be cloyingly sweet. I dig the bourbon barrel aged flavor but the vanilla is just too much. It tastes artificial to me, and that I don't like. I love Founders so I was disappointed not to like this beer. It would be better served as a desert beer or even like a beer ice cream float. I love stouts but this one does not hit the mark for me. So if you're getting ready to trade away treasures from your cellar for this one, be warmed - it may be your thing, but it is very very sweet, to a fault in my own opinion.  Note: so after the initial tasting, I sat on a couple 4 packs and tried another last night, wondering if a bit of the vanilla had mellowed out. I'm glad I did. Not nearly as cloying as I remember, and after only a few months of aging, the vanilla has mellowed out and blended with the bourbon. Much more balance and harmony. Still, this is on the sweeter side for a stout but much improved over the super fresh version. My advice would be to stick this right in the cellar when you buy it and age for maybe 6 months or even a year if you are patient before you try it.

Tons bitter chocolate aromas, with some coffee, and bourbon as well. Tastes unbelievable: there's a perfect maltiness to balance heavy coffee bitter, followed by a wonderful bourbon aftertaste. It's thick and velvety as well, with perfect carbonation I could drink so much of this. The only thing that diminishes drinkability in my mind is it's ABV.

Presented lightly chilled and served in the aforementioned pint-sized vessel, Founders KBS is glossy patent leather black in body with a melted chocolate milkshake colored cap of creamy foam atop. The topping fades to a thin skim with large bubbles at the collar, and leaves freckles of lacing scattered about the glass.  Invisible tendrils of Bourbon and vanilla reach out to me from the shimmering blackness, the notes potent even at an arm's length, alerting my nose that something wonderful is about to happen. The edible aromas are etched with cool, crisp notes of oak, potent and winey French roasted coffee beans, and the drink's overall profile of sweetness is augmented further with a sprinkle of warm caramel and a dusty blast of dark chocolate truffles.  The taste is rich and mocha-like with a splash of premium Bourbon, the overall profile reminiscent of dark semisweet chocolate truffles, espresso crema, spicy molasses, fudge brownies with creamy coffee, charred caramel, more vanilla-- all topped off with a hefty drop or two of Wild Turkey in the chaser position. Mild burnt-grain, smoky bitterness and cooling, cleansing alcohol do very well to knock the sugar factor down, allowing the drink to finish at a near-perfect balance of sweet, earthy, tangy, and savory.  KBS is creamy-firm and full-bodied with mild carbonation and plenty of belly-warming booze. It's a wonderful sipper and a truly magnificent beer, but ho-hum-- I'm no longer suprised by anything Founders puts out-- it's all f*cking magnificent and thus it's nearly boring as all hell to keep stroking their egos... stroke, stroke, stroke.... ;)",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I should mention that the beer was served much colder than suggested and I drank slowly and warmed the beer with my hands. Smells of Bourbon, chocolate, vanilla and coffee. A chocolate taste is first to come to prominence which then gives way to the bourbon, vanilla and coffee character. This beer finishes with a very pleasant maple syrup character. Low carbonation which is expected with a slow sipper such as this. A rich creamy thick mouthfeel makes up the body of this beer. A fantastic beer which I wish was easier to get a hold of.

No head at first, but with a vigorous swirl it slowly builds into about a quarter inch, then is gone, leaving just a thin layer floating on top. Bits of lace typical of an 11.2% beer cling to the sides.  The aroma is very interesting. Imagine a cup of black coffee with just a hint of Jim Beam lurking in the background. Some vanilla and a bit of milk chocolate round out the experience. It what I expected, but better. The bourbon notes don't overwhelm the senses, but compliment the other aromas.  The first flavor that hits the palate is a biting alcohol. It quickly gives way to full bodied coffee, then a slightly vanilla flavor. Quite a multi-dimensional feel. Many layers of flavor here. A chocolate flavor appears after swallowing the beer. Interesting how it hid out in the background then snuck up on my palate. This reminds me of a chocolate pecan pie made with bourbon.  The mouthfeel is wonderful. It is silky smooth. The oats give a very soft texture. Thick and chewy, yet light bodied at the same time. It leaves the palate quickly, but a luxurious coffee and chocolate flavor remain. Eventually, a slightly dry sensation takes over.  Overall, this is a fascinating beer. There are so many dimensions to the flavors and smells. Bourbon stouts are not my favorite style, however this is exceptionally done.

Taste: Okay wasn't expecting this at all, the vanilla and smoke hits hard up front. Slightly after is the espresso/chocolate pounding, and finally a blast of straight bourbon. This may just be as complex a brew as Ive ever had. Also as somewhat assumed, this brew is way sweeter than it's not kentucky friend, but bourbon has a knack for doing that.

Label is designed to look like an old medicine bottle and no longer says ""Kentucky"" on it. No freshness date. Neck label lists 70 IBU's and 11.2 ABV.  Appearance: Pours with the thinnest of heads, barely full coverage. This dark brown foam dissipates very quickly, leaving a few randomly disbursed islands of foam and a ring around the glass. The beer itself is black and completely opaque; looks like used motor oil. Some sediment in the bottle.  Smell: Strong notes of coffee and roasted barley. Hints of vanilla. Bourbon smell is noticeably absent.  Taste: Strong bitterness upfront, not of hops, but like coffee and dark roasted barley. Slight milky chocolate in the middle. Very boozy in the finish; mild alcohol sweetness with hints of anise.  Mouthfeel: Lower than average carbonation level, perfect for the style. Enough to deliver the flavors of this thick stout, but not too high. Body is very good.  Drinkability: A complex and tasty stout. The bourbon is very hidden in this one, which is fine by me.

I almost wanted to chew it. Very impressive. Drinkability, in terms of drinking more than one is not good, as this is an ABV monster that quickly went to my head, despite it's deliciousness. This one is best as a nightcap, or with dessert, not as a session drink.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Darius75,4.82,"12 oz. bottle at room temperature, poured into an 8 oz. wine goblet.  A: Black as the devil in the center, lightening to a caramel brown at the edges. Thin, light golden head dissipates fast. I can see the rim of the glass reflected almost perfectly on the surface of the beer. It's like an oil slick on the surface of a magical wishing well. Little islands of foam creep down the sides of the glass.  S: The nose is rich, but not acrid or too insistent. Deep, rich chocolate aromas are the most pronounced, teased forward by hints of coffee and bourbon. This stout smells like a high-class chocolate bar dipped in hard liquor, or a rum-filled truffle dipped in coffee, or a beautiful woman holding a glass of bourbon dipped in high-class melted chocolate. Somewhere between those three.  T: Chewy chocolate and understated coffee flavors predominate for about a second, segueing into a powerful wash of bourbon. The round, tasty bourbon flavor is mellow at first, mediated by the coffee and chocolate. The tail end of the taste proffers hard liquor's delicious sting without numbing the palate, because it's softened by the chocolate warmth that came before. The aftertaste is mostly coffee and bourbon, without the stickiness that makes too-sweet beers difficult to drink. The more I drink, the more I notice the presence of all the flavors throughout each sip.  M: Round, smooth, thick like a dessert liqueur. The pleasant warmth and creaminess linger between sips. The moderate carbonation is not noticeable with all these dapper yet rugged flavors riding into town.  D: This is an incredibly well-balanced brew that goes down easy, unlike flavored stouts (coffee, chocolate, bourbon, or straight-up oak) in which the specialty flavor dominates too fiercely. This is a true gentleman's brew. If only they released it more than once a year.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,trbergman,4.97,"12oz bottle poured into a tulip.  A - Pours an inky black with no head save for a thin cinnamon lace.  S - Smells of roasted grain and dark chocolate. Much more subtle on the coffee than Breakfast Stout. Further sniffs reveal an oaky vanilla note. Bourbon remains pretty well hidden at first, but shows itself as the beer warms.  T - Coffee, chocolate, and vanilla all carry over into the palate, with Bourbon now coming into play as well. The whiskey, although obvious, is very well in balance with the rest of the beer. As the beer warms, the flavors grow more complex, with molasses, raisins, and figs. Hop bitterness builds and really comes through in the long finish.  M - Smooth and viscous, with a warming sensation on the tongue and in the throat.  D - A pleasure from start to finish. I enjoyed this even more than Breakfast Stout - I think the component flavors are much better integrated here. Definitely a beer that lives up to the hype.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Thorpe429,4.47,"G: Oversized snifter.  A: Pours very, very dark and thick with a single-finger caramel-colored head, which has plenty of carbonation and air bubbles. Head recedes quickly; nice lacing.  S: Coffee and dark chocolate. A little bit of hops. Bourbon presence with a little bit of alcohol.  T: Burnt espresso to go with the bourbon; lots of malt and a little bit of hops to go along with the alcohol. Chocolate and creamy flavors linger after the beer goes down. Hints of caramel and vanilla as well. Incredibly complex--each sip brings something new.  M: Incredibly smooth. Unbelievably sooth and medium-bodied in the mouth, with the perfect amount of carbonation and a striking alcohol presence, which is not overpowering. Simply lovely.  D: Very drinkable for the style and ABV.

Quickly dissipating light brown head and leaves very little lacing on the glass.  S - Smells of burnt wood with coffee notes and something sweet that I can't quite put my finger on...I'm guessing vanilla.  T - Outta sight, my man! Lives up to the hype for sure! The coffee punch of the regular breakfast stout almost punches through but is stifled by the sweet woody bourbon flavor with vanilla highlights. The bourbon wood flavor lingers on the tongue long after sipping. I feel the flavor on every inch of my tongue. So. well. balanced.  M - Thick'n creamy. I love this beer in my mouth.  D - There is so much flavor in this beer that you have to drink it slowly and having more than one would be difficult. Definitely burns from the alcohol, but I've always liked that in my booze.

Deep chocolate melds with bourbon creating a real treat on the snoot.  Tastes reminiscent of Breakfast Stout, but with a boozy bourbon background and a dollop of vanilla.

1199,19960,BigMike,4.97,"EDIT:: So when I first reviewed this I don't think my palate was ready for this great of a beer. This current bottle is from 2/15/10 so it's just about 6 months old. IMO this is a perfect time to bust the cap on this one. The burn has mellowed a bit but there's enough there to keep me happy. This is world class. Mouthfeel is smooth as silk. I want to pop another one but I know I'll regret it.  With all the hype surrounding this beer, when i saw it at Capones i figured i better get one or i might not see it again for a while. I'm hoping this lives up to its legendary reputation. It's not often i splurge and spend $9.50 for a 12oz. bottle.  This is from 2009. The bottle is different then the one currently pictured as the newer one says KBS instead of Kentucky Breakfast Stout. Also, its listed at 11.2%abv. as apposed to 10%.  I'm drinking this one a few degrees below room temp.  Pours black as night. Silky, with the texture of used motor oil. A Thin layer of tan head with little to no lacing.  The first scent i get is of rubbing alcohol. After a few more breaths i can smell some chocolate and burnt coffee along with the alcohol smell.  First sip is suprising smooth. After my second and third sip the bouquet of flavors are noticable. Chocolate, coffee, and alcohol.  Mouthfeel is warm. Almost no carbonation is noticable. Finishes smoothly with a nice warmth of alcohol.  This is in fact one of the best stouts i've tasted and i'm glad i got to sample one.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,grayburn,4.88,"The stout pours a reddish black with a mahogony crown. The head fades quickly into a thick ring of bubbles that coats the glass. The mix of brown, black, and red really makes this beer stand a bit above the typical black stouts. The nose is dominated by bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, a little coffee...very strong alcohol presence, but it is blended in very well. The taste is an amazing blend of bourbon and chocolate. The vanilla notes from the barrels stand between the two to keep them from fighting. There is a nice bitter chocolate finish that really sets off the taste buds. I was worried about this beer letting me down, it didn't. The mouthfeel is perfect, just enough bitterness to keep the sweet at bay, with a nice bitter chocolate ending to round it off. This beer is exceptionally drinkable, I am extremely impressed by Founders yet again for their ability to produce such fine examples of ambrosia. This beer definitely lives up to the hype, even when its this young...I can't imagine how well it will age...In a few years, this beer will be nothing short of amazing, but even now it is magnificent.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,eyncognito,4.78,"A strong pour produces a 1-finger head the color of chocolate milk. The beer is dark black with slight tints of brown. The aroma is awesome-it smacks you in the face with coffee, big bold and roasty, followed by bitter chocolate, hints of vanilla before the bourbon comes in-slightly boozy.  Taste isn't surprising, huge notes of coffee and chocolate mingle perfectly with the vanilla coming in along with bourbon, big bold brassy bourbon, just the slightest taste of alcohol and a slightly dry finish for such a sweet beer. Mouthfeel is thick, chewey-viscous with lively carbonation. A pleasure.  This is a one and done beer for me. Whereas with FBS I can knock back two or three in a sitting, this beer is a doozy with such boozy goodness. Highly recommended, unless you don't like bourbon or coffee-then stay away from this beer and perhaps you should consider how it is you live.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,StarlightSeraph,4.27,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my Chimay goblet.  Appearance: Dark, dark brown, almost black. Almost no head, despite a force pour - a thin layer of dark chocolate colored foam that quickly subsided to nothing.  Smell: Sweet chocolate, and strong notes of bourbon in the background. Coffee intermingles with the bourbon. This baby smells strong. Doesn't smell like any beer I've had before, but it smells awesome.  Taste: Incredibly smooth. Bourbon and coffee mixed together, with no one flavor really dominating. Chocolate notes come out as well. Each flavor is highlighted at a different point during the sip, and the taste lingers long after. Doesn't taste nearly as strong as it smells, or as I expected it to be, but there is a very nice warming sensation from the alcohol on the back end of each sip. All of the flavors complement each other perfectly. If I had a complaint, it is that at times the flavors almost seem to separate, instead of blend together. As the beer warms, the bourbon flavor begins to dominate.  Mouthfeel: Incredibly creamy, almost chewy. Perfectly carbonated. *Slightly* thin, but only just.  Drinkability: This beer is dangerous. It tastes very good, and the alcohol is only evident in the aftertaste - not nearly as much of a sipper as I thought it would be. Very glad I had the opportunity to pick up a few bottles of this.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,nicnut45,5,"I will tell you the truth. With all the hype surrounding this beer I was sure this was going to be a HUGE let down. As I was not too impressed with the regular breakfest stout. Now I have this to say, I dont think the Lord our God would let a beer get any better.  Appearance: Thick, as black as the night, not too far from used 5w30. A thin brown head that collects around the sides of the glass. This head looks like a cloudy sattelite photo of the earth.  Smell: Oh man, like those sweet vanilla cigars old men smoke, like a fresh bottle of vanilla, leather, good coffee, a pleasent alcohol sweetness with nothing offensive detected.  Taste: I drank this at room temp. Who could do this beer justice and describe its taste? This is like creamy vanilla ice cream and port wine. Its not too sweet though I would say on a scale of 1-10 its about a 6. But once you get that initial sweetness the hops come in to keep it in check.  Mouthfeel: Its thick. Like vitamin D milk. Subtle carbonation, I love its touch and how it sets my mind at ease. No fizziness.  Drinkability: When it comes to high alcohol beers you expect them to be a bit harsh and kind of tough to get down. This is an exception, its super smooth. I would like to drink this all the time.  This is the best beer I have had thus far. For me it has surpassed the hype. I imagine only the Saints in Heaven are drinking anything better.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Cost me $9, bringing it in at more than $1.12 an oz., but I figured it was a legendary beer so what the hell. My general feeling is that imperial stouts are overrated on BeerAdvocate, and this one seemed to be something of a case in point. It is by all means a wonderful beer though, whether it serves as my imperial stout whipping boy or not.  Appearance: Black as night and smooth like motor oil. Virtually no head.  Smell: Lots of coffee and a little whisky.  Taste: Depth of malt flavors is extreme; coffee above all, whisky, vanilla, dark chocolate, all things dark and dreamy. But not enough of the whisky, I was surprised to find. It and the vanilla notes were kind of buried beneath some of the heavier characteristics.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and viscous, slightly syrupy with smooth and light carbonation.  Drinkability: Highly delicious and a special treat, but I have satisfied my curiosity for the moment.

1199,19960,abaculy,5,"This is for the 2009 release of what is now officially KBS, and 11.2% ABV  After hearing the (deserved) ""hype,"" I decided I must have this beer as soon as possible. I found out it was brewed once per year rather than semi-ann or quarterly, and that the release was going to be over my spring break's ending weekend. Calling! I tried their amazing Breakfast Stout the previous summer and it was nothing short of amazing.. it is the one that I sipped once, and then again, while thinking ""I think I want to learn to like stouts!"" I added the color stout to my palate.  KBS: It is not as think as one might expect, especially compared to the Old Curmudgeon I had at school the following night(sticky! but in foam) It did pour an almost black brown into my glass. The aroma of bourbon was prominent, also containing chocolate and coffee notes.  The taste was sort of 3 parts. It seemed to start with chocolate and a little coffee, then more chocolate and other ingredients(incl. oatmeal). Then you get hit with chocolate, oatmeal, and bourbon. Finally, the finish gives you some chocolate but the bourbon is sort of in your nose, too, providing somewhat stronger noted than before.  This beer was incredible. Just as you are ready to say that it is tied with regular Breakfast Stout, just different, you realise how delicious the bourbon flavor really is, and how much it adds by being obviously present in the aroma and taste, but without the alcohol taste to spoil it. And KBS is ridiculously drinkable. Definitely could creep up on you. Enjoy!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

T - very coffee heavy. coffee, roasted barley, espresso, smoke, tobacco, charred malt. vanilla, oak, and alcohol come into play as the beer warms. there's also some dark chocolate in the finish. Essentially it tastes like sweetened guinness draught that's been bourbon barrel aged, but that's simplifying it too much because it's so much more.  M - thick and viscous. it appeared to leave a film on my glass.  D - very good beer. I'm glad i picked up a few (seven) extra bottles for cellaring.  Additionally: Does it live up to the hype? Yes.

Very limited brown head, a ring sticks around and a swirl leaves a minibubble lace around the glass. Aroma is abundant with roasted malts, espresso, vanilla, woody tones, caramel and molasses. All this does nothing but increase as it warms. Mouthfeel is near creamy, surprisingly a bit lively for the dissapation of the head. Taste is everything in the nose intermingling. Great barrel and vanilla one second, dark chocolate, molasses and espresso the next. Finishes with just a hint of coffee, and molasses. There are no negatives in bitterness/sourness or anything overdone in this. As long as you are ready for what you should expect from this, there is absolutely no dissapointment. This is the best double stout I have had sans aging flat out. There is no need to cellar this to get what you are expecting. I have several to age, but I'm guessing this will be one that does not change much from age.

Ahhh, one of the best noses I've experienced. Simultaneous waves of vanilla, coffee, sweet chocolate, and oaky goodness. I can't think of anything that could improve the aromas carried by the KBS.  Drinks velvety smooth with a thick, rich mouthfeel that coats the mouth. The sweetness of the vanilla and chocolate are balanced wonderfully by the bitterness of the coffee and roasted grains, as well as by the warmth imparted by the bourbon barrel. Finish is medium-to-long, making this a great beer for sipping. Alcohol strength (which is 11.2% on the bottle, but listed as 10% above), comes throughh a little in the end, but for me it's balanced enough.

This one makes my mouth water... always a good sign. I could literally get lost in the aroma ... the best aroma I have ever experienced in a beer  T: Wow, talk about balance for such a big beer. The bourbon and coffee play off of each other flawlessly with undertones of vanilla, dark chocolate, and oak. As the glass warms, different flavors are accented. First it was the bourbon, then the coffee, then the chocolate. All of it comes together with a presence of alcohol at the end, but at 11.2%, this is to be expected.

Poured from a 12oz brown stuby bottle into my Surly tulip. A billowing head slowly dovelops into a fluffy very dark brown 2 finger head. The texture pours like oil, very thickly from the bottle. Forming thin streaks of dark brown lace. Black in color with no light penetration.  Aroma is robust, with lots of dark malty chocolate, coffee, vanilla, very nice amount of boozy bourban aroma with toasted woody notes. Some sweetness at the knose, ahhh the oaky bourban aromas are intoxicating.  Wow, first sip brings a smile and respect to the brewer for making such an awsome taste possible. Upfront carbonation zing is present but only behind a thick creamy curtain. This is up there with some of the creamier RIS's I've had, for mouthfeel.  The taste is a very dark bakers chocolate, with bittering bite through the swallow. Things get warm here, but not solvent like, it mimicks the bourban warmth more so. Its earthy with toastyness and lots of oak. Chocolate fading at the swallow and coffee coming in as well as a balancing smoothness and more laid back flavors, not as overwhelming at the swallow. All of that boozy warmth and huge bitter chocolate woodyness falls away. Lingering with light chocolate, wood and vanilla.  Very interesting brew.

1199,19960,beerman207,4.9,"This is my first time trying KBS and I wasn't disappointed in the least. All in all a phenomenol beer.  Appearance - looks like motor oil - beautiful creamy brown bubbles with little lacing on the glass. While the beer sits the lacing produces some swirling in the glass which is quite beautiful. When I finished pouring this into the glass, it left about 2 fingers worth of tan head  Smell: The bourbon is strong in this brew. Hint of coffee coming through.  Mouthfeel - very creamy mouthfeel  Taste - bitterness was stronger than expected in the finish. That may be why this is listed at 70 IBU vs. the usual 25 IBU. When I bought this from my local beer place, the cashier told me it tastes like chocolate pudding. I taste vanilla, coffee, and a hint of chocolate. Another taste coming through from time to time is the bourbon. The bourbon is definately contributing to the bitterness. This is probably the most complex flavor in a beer I have ever experienced. Fantastic.  Drinkability - the alcohol is definately present in this beer. Then again, it's 11.2% alcohol so it better be present! Even with the high alcohol content of this brew, I believe the drinkability of the beer is quite high. I could definately have 2-3 of these in a sitting.  At $6.00 a beer, I was a little nervous of being let down. Luckily, this beer is as exceptional as everyone on here speaks of.

1199,19960,Beerisheaven,4.82,"In honor of this year's release, I cracked open my last two bottles from last year. A small tear fell as these last two were poured.  Very interesting. Two bottles purchased in the same half case from last year that I was lucky enough to get and two bottles stored in the exact same cellar conditions. One of the bottles had a much sharper bourbon smell while the other one had a less pronounced bourbon smell that seems to have flattened out somewhat over the last year.  A - Beautiful pour into my large snifter glass. A small tan head rises up to greet you after your pour.  S - The one bottle had a very pronounced bourbon smell in addition to some oak, vanilla, and slight coffee smell. The other bottle had a slightly more pronounced coffee and oak smell but not so much of the bourbon.  T - This is probably my favorite beer that I have ever had. Unlike the Breakfast Stout which hammers you with charred coffee, the Kentucky is an intoxicating combination of bourbon, oak, vanilla, and coffee. To me, this is nearly perfection in a glass.  M - Great. You can certainly get a nice warming sensation while this bear rests on your tongue. You want to keep it there, it is that good.  D - You have to be careful with this one. You want more, but you know better.  All in all, just about the perfect beer from my perspective. Hard to imagine that this one can get better. Seek it out and enjoy it. It IS that good.

Huge foamy lacing, draping across the glass.  S: The nitro dulls the smell a little. The smell now is now reminiscent of a chocolate stout, instead of a huge bourbon barrel monster. Dull chocolate, coffee, no noticeable alcohol or hop presence.  M/T: Much lighter then regular KBS, making it a super creamy, medium body. The carbonation much more present then KBS in the bottle or on tap. Second wave is all alcohol, this is a pretty hot beer, followed by roasted malts.  D: With a high APV, couldn't session this one, but the nitro makes it feels much lighter and more manageable then the KBS out of the bottle. I like this version of KBS. A nice twist that might be better than the original? This version does make it more drinkable.

1199,19960,taylorhamrick,4.84,"I was going to hold off reviewing this until I'd had a few of them, but I can't.  It pours out pitch black, with a thin head. It fades a bit, leaving swirls of bubbles and leaves little bits of lace all the way down. Looks about like what I'd expect, but a bigger head would've really made me fall in love. The smell, it can't get any better. First you get wood, just wonderful wood, mixed in with a brilliant bourbon smell, a bit of alcohol. Then there's the coffee, roasted a bit burnt, but very nice. Then you really smell vanilla and chocolate, BIG vanilla sometimes, and really beautiful dark chocolate others. I mean, there's nothing else I could ask for, and the best part, the very best part, is every time I put my face up to the glass, there's something new, and something great. The taste is wonderful, just like the smell. It's totally different from the average stout, but everything is there. First you get a very woody, earth coffee taste, like bourbon mixed with fresh brewed coffee. Then comes the vanilla, and its very nice as it sweetens, and is almost creamy like good vanilla ice cream, and finishes like a very smooth dark chocolate bar, and just a bit of an alcohol after burn. But the alcohol mostly warms. The mouthfeel is just perfect, smooth and creamy, with infinite complexity. I was just fascinated at every sip, and couldn't put it down. I wouldn't put it down under any circumstances, and is possible the greatest drinker at 10% I've ever had. Really incredible. Really, really incredible. You must find it and taste it.

At SPTR they had this and 13 other Founder's beers on tap, I'm glad I got some before they ran out (as they definitely would've even with the 1 per customer limit)  The stout poured an opaque oily black, with a tinge of sandy foam. This is what in a imperial stout should look like.  The smell was fantastic! There was initial nose of roasted coffee, followed by some sweet chocolate, malt, and vanilla. It smelled like brewing coffee at a bakery with hot pastries coming out of the oven  The taste was just as good. I hate imperial stouts that are just sweet, the KBS had creamy malt flavor with the balance of bitterness from the coffee and chocolate and sweetness from the grain. You could taste all the ingredients individually and they blended very well together. Even my friends, who tend to like lighter ales, were impressed.  The mouth feel was full and luxurious with the beer coating my entire mouth and transfering all of its goodness to my whole palate  I rated this beer only as a 4 for drinkability, because with any beer with 10% ABV, this is just not possibly sessionable.

1199,19960,John_M,4.75,"On tap at the South Philly taproom for Philly Beer Week. Just fabulous stuff.  The beer pours the expected black brown color, with good head retention, but with outstanding stickly lacing. On the nose, this is the first inkling that one is in for something special. There is huge aroma of coffee, coffee grounds, touch of licorise and chocolate. As good as this beer is on the nose, on the palate it is simply other worldly. This beer has a huge mouthfeel/presence, with an incredible blast of rich, decadent coffee, chocolate and coffee grounds. What makes the KBS so incredible is not just the coffee flavor, but the feeling that the coffee flavor is extra special as well. The coffee flavor isn't just folgers or hills brothers, oh no. The coffee flavor in this bad boy is from the finest french roast, and is just so thick, rich and viscuous. Mouthfeel is long, rich, smooth and just so luxurious. This beer is just fabulous. Drinkability is just amazing. In the draft version there is a slight booziness, but if anything it enhances the coffee flavor and just adds to the richness. You can tell the alcohol is up there a bit, but it detracts not one wit from this beer's drinkability. One of the finest beers on the planet... what a treat to finally have it on tap. $9 a six ounce pour at the South Philly Taproom, and worth every penny of it.  It just doesn't get much better then this.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A-Obsidion reflectivness with medium brown edge hanging onto the glass. Minimal head but nice to look at.  S-Quad Espresso. This one was a 5 for me, my first in relation to smell. This was tough for me to put into words but; Dirt, nuts, with a little mint. Roasted malt. [crazy time] Granite and stones after a rain. You know that granite that turns one color when it gets wet then goes back when it dries...? This is what I'm talking about.  T-Old coffee, tea and small after heat of bourbon.

1199,19960,berserker256,4.4,I sampled this beer at the 4th annual Michigan Brewer's Guild Beer Festival in Comstock Park at the Fifth/Thirsd Ballpark. This lovely beer was served to me in na a 6 ounce clear plastic cup. It was blackish and retained a head of hickory-colored large bubbles. It was thick and delicious with low carbonation and had motor oil-like qualities... In a good way. It was rich like a heavy burnt oatmeal milkshake. It was semi-sweet like a Hershey's Special Dark chocolate bar but also had bitterness and slightly smokey heavy overtones. It was God Damn delicious. I wish I had more than 6 ounces. Sort of viscous and fatiguing to drink in any kind of quantity.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The beer is dark as night, letting no light through.  S- Lots of bitter roasted aromas. Dark roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Also some good sweetness in there but it is hard to pic out specific aromas over the roasted goodness, maybe molasses. Hint of dark fruit as well cherries and plum.  T- Huge roasted flavors. Lots of coffee and dark chocolate. Some nice sweet notes as well cherries, molasses, brown sugar and roasted nuts. A lot of good spicy notes as well, ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Almost no detectable alcohol.  M- Super thick and very silky mouth feel, much like drinking chocolate milk only way more spice and texture. Very good mouth feel.  Overall- This may be the best stout I have had to date. It is extremely complex with an amazing mouth feel and drinkability that should not be able to be attained by an Imperial Stout.

I am blown away by your generosity! If this is the beginning, then my liver is fearful of the end...  A - Pours an ominous black, occluding the sorcery and dark magic that is undoubtedly present within this opaque shroud. A dark tan head guards the perimeter with an intimidating presence paralyzing all those that gaze upon it with a terrible fear.  S - Characterized by rage and hate, it burns down the lining of the nasal passage showing no mercy. A blitzkrieg of bourbon, vanilla, coffee, ash and smolten ruins left on the side of a mountain are formidable.  T - The taste buds shake with the palate decimating rhythm of warriors marching into battle. Bourban, vanilla and coffee have stormed through all lines of defense and taken the keep. Heat, ash and smoke are all that remain of this raped and pillaged land.  M - Thick with a heaviness akin to bench pressing a blue whale. Carbonation keeps it lively giving the demoralized a false sense of hope.  D - The gods have surely cursed this upon me. Thor's hammer has smashed my taste buds and Odin's ravens have ingrained themselves into my skull with the ruins of this delicious beverage.

1199,19960,BeerStine,4.85,"2008 batch. 12oz bottle poured into a snifter.  Pours opaque - like motor oil. An aggressive pour produces a brown, sticky, fluffy head whose lacing sticks to the glass like foamy caramel. Smells of rich, dark, roasted coffee and chocolate with the perfect lingering smell of alcohol. Taste is just like the smell: coffee and chocolate with the amazing bourbon flavor coming though. Perfect balancing hops help finish the flavor. Mouthfeel is medium/light with little carbonation. Drinkablity is outstanding. By the look, smell and ABV of this beer you would think it would be difficult to drink more than one, but I could drink a four pack of this, no problem.  Founders took an amazing beer and barrel aged it. I'm a whore for barrel ageing - especially if the barrels once housed whiskey.  I have very fond memories of this beer. Several years ago, during my early experiences with craft beer, I had this beer at Founders' old location, on Monroe Street, by the Grand River. I have a very selective memory, in which my brain has the tendency to discard information lacking future use. Clearly, my memory of drinking this beer for the first time has been stored for euphoric purposes.  I can unequivocally credit this beer (with the help of one of my friends) as the catalyst that truly started my craft beer experience. Call me biased, but I love this beer. World class.

Thin tan head with nice lacing.  Smells..uhoh, smells like a while lot of bourbon. Shades of black magick here and that scares me. Swirling the glass releases some of the other scents, making this less one dimensional.  thankfully the taste us not nearly as overly hot and one dimensional as I had feared. Vanilla, smoke, choclatw, coffee.  Pretty full bodied and medium carbonated.  This is good but I still prefer OPS and Homewood Reserve when it comes to barrel aged beers.

1199,19960,jstilwell,4.1,"Thanks to weirdbeer for bringing this to the Kate the Great tapping!. Glad I have a few more coming in another trade!  This bad boy pours an absolutely beautiful jet black motor oil with a thin dark brown head that exhibits intermittent shades of burgundy and purplish tints. Nice lacing on my glass and a fair amount of crabonation bubbles as well. The scent is overwhelming with the bourbon but upon swirling the complexities come out. Although this scent reminds me of my Ol' Grandad/Jack Daniels days, I can also detect deep wood, vanilla, coffee and a hint of black pepper. This is truly spicy but also has a mix of syrup and caramel on the initial sip. This turns to mild bitter chocolate and a serious big ass bourbon blast for the finish! mouthfeel is thick, heavy and smooth though not quite creamy.

Thanks to both of you guys...  Pours with a very think dark tan head that vanishes very quickly. Beer is totally black.. a touch shiny. Around the edges it's deep dark brown.  Aroma is of Vanilla, oak... Bourbon like that's for sure. Slightly sweet smelling.  Well, it is about as good as everyone says.. Founders has clearly perfected the Bourbon Barrel Age routine. This and Backwoods Bastard are both awesome. Starts bright and immediately the smooth vanilla hits. Then a moment of roasted goodness. Some sweetness and then back to vanilla. At this point you taste the bourbon notes, wood and then some alcohol. The alcohol notes work perfectly and are not over powering.. After you swallow the flavors continue. Layers of nice sweetness and vanilla all tagged with some dark roasted malts.. Never too sweet, never far from the bourbon flavor.  Silky smooth very slightly carbonated and two clicks shy of creamy.  Insanely drinkable. I'll be interested to see the drinkability scores after I post this review. Really drinks like candy and seems far from a 10% ABV. A 4 pack of this could cause trouble.  I am so happy to have the opportunity to try this beer. I am hoping that Founders allows some to make it's way to MA in '09... Also glad to have another bottle.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Aroma is intense coffee with bourbon, raisin, and faint fusel notes. Powerful smoke and coffee in flavor, in addition to musty, spicy hops. Chocolate and toffee notes appear in the aroma as the beer warms. No real vanilla, this is more of a charred oak, with ash, cola and espresso beans in the flavor. Appropriately thick mouthfeel, but the slightly hot finish hurts drinkability. The oak and coffee might drop out, but it'd be interesting to see how this one ages.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The taste is of chocolate, coffee, bourbon - wow - this is tasty! (I think I might like the actual coffee and chocolate used in the other Breakfast Stout a bit more, but I'm far from complaining). It has a great bourbon character to it, while allowing the dark complexities and roast to come through. Doesn't get too sweet, as there is roast and a dryness in the finish.  Silky smooth, it has just the right touch of carbonation to keep it full but not too thick or syrupy.  Awesome! Overhyped? Nope.

1199,19960,BARFLYB,4.57,"12oz bottle into a regular pint glass. This bottle is a little under a year old. Found this unexpected on a beer run, i was surprised.  A- Founders Kuntucky Breakfast Stout comes out pitch black with a 1/2 inch dark tan foamy head. Once that dies a few spots of foam can be seen on the surface. A few patches of lace cling to the glass, nothing much. A bit of red comes through on the outer rim of surface.  S- A whole bunch of chocolate and malt up front with hints of sweet vanilla. Dark roasted coffee with dark malts follow. While cold the bourbon isn't much but comes through with warming. The oak is there from the barrel. I could smell this for days if it was possible.  T- The bourbon comes up front with some rich chocolate following. The vanilla is more powerful in taste than smell, while I am getting some licorice also. Coffee is there with espresso qualities also but not as much as regular a regular breakfast. Some sweet sugar with caramel background. The oak qualities come forth with warming and add to the rich flavors.  M- A very heavy mouth feel and quite pleasing. Very viscous while having smoother qualities as it warms. Room temp is the best for this one. Softer than some barrel aged stout's but KBS still coats the palette with goodness. KBS isn't very bitter. Quite warming feeling all around.  D- This is very drinkable for me but one and done. I have to admit that i enjoyed this better fresh rather than this 9 month old bottle, even though founder's website say's KBS has legs for two years. The bourbon was more pronounced fresh and the flavors collided better. Oh well live and learn. Don't drink this one too cold as it only get's better.

S - More coffee that bourbon, but a fair amount of both. Very strong aroma of freshiy roasted coffee beans. Hints of oak and vanilla as well. Wow...amazing aroma.  T - Strong coffee notes initially before the bourbon really kicks in. Tastes very similar to that of the nose. Underlying hints of vanilla, oak, and a nice spiciness. A plethora of flavors that all play off of each other remarkably well. A touch boozy as well.  M/D - Full as can be and incredibly smooth. There is a slight alcohol burn but nothing overwhelming.

S_A deep dark roast of the finest espresso with a bit of burnt tobacco and a hint of dark chocolate. Not overpowering but really well done.  T_A deep rich and dry coffee flavour exude out of the first sip. This is followed by a bit of chicory and dark chocolate. The aftertaste brings a slight acidity like a good espresso would. A very pleasing burnt bitterness lingers in the mouth hinting at a vague but present grassy/medicinal hoppiness. There are undercurrents of vanilla, cream, woody smokiness and a bit of sherry. The alcohol is there but not dominant. The oak is barely detectable but the aging process has left this mellow as can be.  M_Rich and creamy, Oatmeal stout-esque.

Quality in the smell.  T - Strong Alcohol Burn for a 10%. I have had better in which the alcohol was greater but its taste was hidden. I was expecting more from the smell. Also, I wish it was thicker. Hard to get in Minnesota so I am greatful for trying. Some Coffee and chocolate taste but overpowered from the booze taste.  M - Thin but very smooth.  D - Not really. Not found in Minnesota. Also, because of the high alcohol content, a sipper at best. Just not my favorite.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,PittBeerGirl,3.74,"Thanks to Raznug for this!  A- Body is a thick, vicious, motor oil black. An aggressive pour only produces a coffee colored head of &lt;1/2 finger which quickly fades to a thick collar. Collar has perfect retention. No lacing is left behind in the glass.  S-Nose is complex and balanced. Vanilla, oak, and sweet bourbon come through first in the nose with a big roasted chocolate backbone. There is also a slight hint of alcohol.  T-The flavor is somewhat dull upfront but what can be noticed is vanilla, an essence of sweet bourbon, chocolate, oak, and some roasted flavors. Tastes like a roasted coffee upfront. The finish is a huge blast of roasted malt flavors and bourbon heat. Left to linger is alcohol astringency and heat, roasted malt flavors and bitterness, and a hint of vanilla and oak.  M-Medium tingly carbonation and a body that is balanced with thick stout qualities and alcohol. Decent, but a little thinner than I like.  D- This is a decent stout, and one I have been looking for for awhile. It is also only my 2nd bourbon stout. It was an honor to try it and if I see it around I will pick it up and age it, but its a little too hot with alcohol for my tastes.

Appearance: Such a daunting black color with a fairly brown head that sticks around for a while. This is definitely one of the darker beers I've seen.  Smell: Huge dark chocolate smell is what hits me first. Second thing I take out of it is some sort of scotch or whiskey smell. I like it!  Taste: Tastes pretty much exactly like it smells. It reminds me of those chocolate bottle candies that are filled with various spirits (well, the ones filled with scotch at least). I'm also getting a hint of dark fruits right near the end of the sip. Complex, rich, and delicious.  Mouthfeel: Full creamy body with some nice light carbonation. I could actually hold this in my mouth for a while and the alcohol didn't burn very much at all.  Drinkability: The taste really improves as it warms, but I can see how this would really knock me on my ass if I drank too much.

Each sniff is followed by a mild burn in the nostrils. I can't get enough of it. This smell kicks ass!  Taste: Bourbon and black pepper step out first. Butter toffee, distant currants, and sweet oak also join the mix. Overall a mild taste, which reminds me of FW12. More flavors arise as beer warms.  Mouthfeel: Silky smooth with a nice, warm 'pop' at the end. Perfect amount of mouth numbing and warmth.  Drinkability: Warming ABV takes you where you want to be.

1199,19960,rhinos00,4.77,"Received this as a very generous extra from Brent (brentk56). Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter.  A- So dark that it almost looked like I was staring at the black hole. Very thin ring of tan head formed at the top of the glass and dissipated quickly.  S- Simply amazing. Had the strong roasted coffee presence, just like the Breakfast Stout, but was offset by a cornucopia of aromas. Among them was molasses, burned malts and a vanilla-like bourbon sweetness.  T- Exactly like the smell. Really enjoyed how the bourbon flavor was real subtle and had a sweet tinge that cut the harshness of the roasted coffee beans. Capped of by a nice bitterness.  M- Well carbonated, thick and viscous. Not much more to add, just perfect.  D- Extremely drinkable. The amazing taste and smell make this the thickness and high ABV just disappear into the background. Only reminder is the nice, slow burn in the chest.  Overall, this is one hell of a beer.

The aroma is a dense melange of black roasted espresso, dark roasted grain, and a woody drizzle of earthy bourbon. Twinges of chocolate and vanilla back up a warm and overt halo of alcohol.  Upon sipping, and admittedly with great anticipation, the flavor verily explodes with a series of elements, including blackened grain with burnt sugar and molasses, dark caramel, deep espresso, charred oak, down-home bourbon, and licorice. As the alcohol heats up, bitter chocolate and vanilla become lightly apparent, and burnt biscuit joins resurgent coffee and grain sweetness. The bitterness builds toward the close, as the finish crisps up but never totally overwhelms the lingering malty sweetness. The seamless complexity of this beer delivers a flavor to be remembered.  Full bodied, it pours like gear oil, then goes all creamy and soft, coating and caressing as it lulls the palate into a happy enchantment.  Simply put, this is one seriously dangerous beer. It is as earthy as can be, it's a coffee addicts alcoholic dream, and the bourbon and oak component gives it a unique and home style feel. The crafting that goes into this brew is apparent every step of the way. While the ABV is very big and bold, the parts come together to lend an eminent drinkability, and therein lies the danger to the unwary. And I dare anyone who loves this style to have just one. I tried, and failed with a huge smile on my face. I made a beeline to be able to try it the first time. Now I'll make a beeline to get it any time I can in the future.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,bonkers,4.62,"I had this on tap at High Street Grill. The beer was served in a large wine glass, pithc black in appearance with a larger than expected tan head. The beer left wondeful layers of lacing. This is best smelling beer I had ever had. Mild coffee flavorings are the predominat smell. There is also mild undertone of Knob Creek, the combination is like a shot in your morning coffee. The taste is more complex and subtle than the smell. There is coffee, bourbon, chocolate all in perfect balance. The finish is crisp with a wonderfull aftertaste. A full bodied beer that hides its 10% ABV well, making it easy to drink. I will seek this one out again.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,MiScusi,4.2,"Originally received this bottle in a trade with nflmvp in the summer of '07.  A- black with a cocoa colored thin head. I poured this into my spaten optimator dimpled mug which is pretty wide so that might have caused the head to be hard to build up. Looks syrupy.  S- Coffee comes out pretty dominant in combination with dark bittersweet chocolate. The smell is obviously boozy, the bourbon is unmistakeable.  T- the taste somewhat mirrors the smell. The first thing that hits is a roastiness, then the dark bittersweet chocolate finishing with that coffee bitterness. The aftertaste is mildy woody and slightly tart.  M- quite slick. Not Dark Lord slick, but it's still quite viscous.  Overall: There are so many big stouts that just taste awful to me. Often they have a soy flavor or way too much licorice or anise, but Founders has found such a great flavor combination in both this beer and their regular breakfast stout. This is one of few big stouts that I can enjoy. It's good all around. It doesn't make me want to a run out and get as much as I can but a real stout lover might really find this a 4.5+.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Desert-ish, but not sweet.  t - Beautiful expresso/burbon combo. Not as much stout-iness, it's hidden. But its back there. Not much bitterness (thank you!). Lots of vanilla.

A little bit of tan foam. no head.  Nose: Coffee like whoa! A hint, my large, beer-accentuated ass. Coffee is something journalists and goths like, so go figure, I'm excited. Slightest hint of vanilla.  Taste: Vanilla is more prominent. Coffee bitterness. A bit of wood. Sweet in the aftertaste, then the alcohol burn. I feel I let this get a bit too cold, alas. Now I just have to exercise patience (which I lack) and let it warm ...  In the meantime, mouthfeel is not quite as thick as I'd expected, but still very sturdy. A little more carbonation than expected.  ... ok. It's warmed a bit. The vanilla comes out more, lingering in the aftertaste. The coffee is very present at the front. A bit of astringent wood in the middle.  Why, oh why, do I not live somewhere where I can purchase this? I could drink it all winter.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Tdizzle,4.45,"Thanks to OlieIPA for hooking me up with this.  A- Poured from a 12oz bottle into a New Belgium globe glass, this beer pours motor oil-black. An aggressive pour yields about one-finger of head that's solid brown in color as it settles to a patchy layer, leaving behind lots of spotty lacing on the glass.  S- A sharp smell of bitter coffee and roasted, chocolatey malts with some rough edges of charred oak barrel. A trace of bourbon lingers in the background, but you really have to dig for it.  T- Lots of coffee and roasted malts up front, but these flavors gradually subside to a slightly bitter finish that's accompanied by a mildly boozy taste of bourbon. I would have liked the bourbon character to be more prominent in the taste of this beer, but I do appreciate how well-integrated it is. Very drinkable and coffee-like.  M- The mouthfeel is full-bodied and slightly syrupy with gentle carbonation. Maybe just a little on the thin side though.  D- The 10% ABV is very well-hidden, and this beer is pretty light on the stomach for a barrel-aged stout. I felt like I could easily have two of these in a sitting.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Beerzebub,4.67,"Big thanks to both sirhc and Mudpuppet for bottles of this.  Poured in a big wine glass at 55 F/ 13 C.  Black, tinged red at the edges, with a bubbly tan head, and fine rings and speckles of lace.  Smells rich and sweet, with plenty of roast coffee, bourbon, and charred oak, with vanilla, liquorice, and light cookie spices. The bourbon barrel really comes through, and works great. There's also somehow a strong suggestion of Irish cream liqueur. Cohesive and great.  Tastes like sweet smooth dark coffee and whiskey, then after several seconds it gets woodsier, and the wood and building roastiness combine to dry out the sweetness considerably. Next comes a wave of creamy vanilla, and a long long finish of toasty oak and creamy whiskey liqueur.  Rich smooth texture, and highly drinkable, the alcohol isn't a problem at all.  Exceptional stuff.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,HardTarget,4.26,"A) Oil black, opaque even in a thin glass. Thin dark tan collar lasts and leaves tidemarks. An impressive sight.  S) Sniffing a bourbon barrel, strong wood, almost tannin notes. There is a chalk dust edge to this as well. Deep in there are a few hints of west coast, citric hops.  T) Coffee, dark and manly coffee. Molasses sweetness, bourbon, all intense tastes that cover hops and even malt. So much going on, and all of it set at ""11"".  M) Slick, heavy, low carbonation, bits of chew.  O) Wow. Bourbon is a bit heavy handed, but a truck full of flavors that ends up being fairly smooth and drinkable.

1199,19960,HopHead1982,4.57,"I will start by putting this review in context. I have found that I am not that big a fan of beers aged in liquor barrels. To overpowering for me. However:  A - was exceptionally dark. as dark as you will find.  s - you can already smell the bourbon. Great if you like it. Not for me though.  T - same as smell. Truly fantastic with or without the bourbon aging. However, i feel the beer is overpowered by the ""aging"".  M - As good as it gets!  D - If I appreciated the bourbon aging, I could have several. However, I don't enjoy the ""liquor"" taste, and therefore wouldn't be able to handle more than one of these.  In conclusion, this is a fantastic beer. As I said previously, I don't enjoy the bourbon flavor, but aside from that, this deserves its place among the elite on BA.

Aromas of wood, vanilla, smoke, roast, espresso coffee, and some chocolate. Very nice aroma. Tastes of wood, vanilla (strong but not as strong as in the aroma), roast, coffee, chocolate, and a very light bourbon finish.  The barrel aging was done very nicely as it wasn't overpowering.

1199,19960,bainard,4.03,"Inky black-brown with a sepia meniscus. Sand-colored head.  Aromas abound of bourbon, coffee, dark chocolate, wood. If I had synaesthesia, this would smell dark brown, all the aromas point to this color.  A much woodier-tasting beer than I remember in the past, the bourbon isn't quite is prevalent in this one as other bourbon-aged beers I've had (Bourbon County and Backwoods Bastard come to mind), but the coffee is extremely strong in this. A bit of bitter chocolate, lots of roastiness.  Definitely thick, with a bit of carbonation, but nothing that coats the mouth too much, nor dances over the tongue.  It's a 10% beer, and you certainly feel and taste that in the beer. But then again, it's friggin' Kentucky Breakfast, you're not looking for something that you're going to down a 6 of before hitting the sports bar.

The start is almost like a creamy coffee and finishes with the bourbon.

1199,19960,champ103,3.93,"A big thanks to Deuane for the extra.  A: Pours a jet black color. A small tan head forms, but recedes fast. Standard for the style. Some patchy lace. S: Awesome. At first, lots of vanilla comes billowing out. Bourbon and oak aromas. A hint of chocolate. Wonderful. T: Follows the nose, vanilla, bourbon, and oak flavors. Nice roasted malt flavors. Much more chocolate. Actually fairly bitter and sweet chocolate. Alcohol. M/D: A full body that is rich and creamy. Kind of chalky. A very easy beer to sip on. The high alcohol shows with some warming bourbon. Again, a great beer to sip on, but not as easy to drink as the Breakfast Stout IMO.  Founders defiantly makes two would class stouts, and I am glad I got a chance to try them. I need more.  EDIT on March 28 2011---  I do still enjoy this. Though I think there is a lot more bitter, and almost acrid coffee grounds in the nose that detracts for me. Much more bitter coffee flavor as well. All things that were absent from a couple of years ago. Still very good, and worth seeking out if you have the means. Though it has changed a little in the years that I first had it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Bighuge,4.51,"Appearance: Pours with some viscosity. A dense, creamy brown head forms. Retention and lace properties are quite good. Body is thick and black.  Aroma: Chalky dry cocoa, sweet bourbon, vanilla and char.  Flavor: Wow is this smooth. The bourbon properties and the stout properties blend to near perfection. There is really a uniqueness to this beer, even as a Bourbon Bbl beer, that is hard to pinpoint. I'm guessing it has to do with the kind of bourbon and/or barrel aging process used. Smooth kentucky bourbon notes blend with some nice chocolatey and burnt malt tones from the stout. A little of that dry char character is noted as well.  MF: Velvety. Medium to medium-full body. Alcohol is barely detected. This one flows way too effortlessly across the tongue.  DK: This is the closest challenger to the unbelievable barrel aged stouts that Town Hall puts out occasionally. This is damn close. Just not quite there with the Czar Jack and the even more impressive barrel aged oatmeal stout they put out a few years ago.

1199,19960,marcpal,4.64,"Some beers just flat out do not live up to the high and lofty expectations that are made of them because of hype. This one, my friends, is indeed not one of them. Unbelieveable, I wanted to be critical, whiney or let down and was not.  12oz bottle poured into a snifter as directed.  Thanks out to Derek (aka Hoppymeal)  A: Looks like something out of a Penzoil commercial. Fine tan head that was more like a film on top of the liquid. Thick black and patchy lacing which quickly dissapated.  S: As advertised, the coffee, lots of coffee. Sensing plenty of the bourbon and vanilla. Strong fumes of coffee/espresso is backed up by some raisins, alcohol and roasted chocolate. The smoke of a fine cigar builds and fills your nose- tied in with licorice. More sweet than bitter, some zip from the abv.  T: In comparison to the aroma, more bitter than sweetness. Vanilla flavored coffee freshly brewed with a substantial licorice character. The bourbon and espresso are the stars that steal the show, packed in each and every sip. Not as much chocolate but ridiculously complex and well made.  Taste is truly not lacking much of anything. Especially as it warms and the smokiness comes through. Like sipping on melted Ghiradelli at times, flat out intense.  M: Hugely thick viscocity. No bubbly carbonation, just thick and velvetty smooth. The texture is superior and the alcohol is felt.  D: This is a beer to sip and appreciate and I surely am stoked to have had the chance to get this out here. Sure, alcohol is high, but if I were to get my hands on more of this that would not stop me from having on a cold fall night.  Superior accompaniment to just about any dessert.

A quick swirl leaves a thin sheet on the sides of the glass, and allows notes of vanilla, chocolate, fig, and leather to appear. Coffee and bourbon dominate at cellar temp, but warming brings an incredible bouquet of flavors, with more chocolate, vanilla, and tobacco. Thick and full bodied, but not too syrupy or viscous.

1199,19960,RocPorterFanatic,5,"This amazing beer pours opaque brown into the awaiting pint glass. No light penetrates through the inky stout. The initial scent is coffee, no qualms about it. Following the dissolving coffee is an underlying cocoa aroma. The taste is so complex its almost perplexing. Again, coffee is in the forefront. Next, in come the chocolate. Its not hidden, its like a punch in the face, almost syrup-like. The alcohol is well hidden. Its only appearance is at the back of the tongue, just before swallowing. This beer cannot be a session beer by definition, unless your session is one or two drinks. I've been looking for Kentucky Breakfast Stout for quite a while. I am so happy to have found this.

It has a very dark brown head but almost none of it and, as it sits now, looks more like a dark root beer.  Aroma is rich in dark roasted coffee and bourbon.  Flavor is outstanding - not too heavy on the bourbon, nicely flavored with roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate (all of which impart some bitterness) and the sweet cherry character of the bourbon. It's an incredible blend of flavors.  Mouthfeel is nice, smooth, and with just enough burn to remind me it's heavy on the alcohol. The bourbon taste is a good reminder too!

The bourbon is clearly dominant in this beer along with intense coffee and chocolate like flavoring up front. I feel like I'm missing something else when it comes to this beer; very complex flavoring is the best way to put it.  M: Somewhat thick, just about no carbonation, rest on the palate for quite some time, and a chalky like finish. My girlfriend suggested it had an expresso like feel to it...but only better.

Its aroma was that of coffee, vanilla, and a hint of bourbon. I recall remarking on how I hoped that this beer tasted as good as it smelled. And, it did. The taste was also that of coffee and a hint of vanilla. The bourbon was less pronounced than expected and overpowered by the coffee. This ale was exceptionally drinkable, even at 10% ABV. After finishing the beer, I immediately wanted another; however, at $8.50 a bottle (but worth every penny), there was none other to be had.

I think this means the beer was brewed/bottle in or around March?? Anyway, emerges a pitch black color with a perfect looking, mocha chocolate colored head of about two fingers. Generous lacing and nice head retention as well.  Aroma is beautiful. Coffee, bourbon, chocolate, and more fresh ground coffee. Coffee stouts are probably my favorite style and this may be my favorite of the style. The coffee aromas are wonderful and the slight bit of bourbon/oak aromas add to the complexity and make this a great smelling beer.  Coffee, perfect amount of bourbon, slightly alcoholic, touch of hoppiness. Absoutely perfect. Thats all that needs to be said.  A very full bodied beer. So delicious.

It's quite reminiscent of a Coffee Crisp bar (more familiar to the Canadians, I believe, though it can be found in the US, as well). A nice blend of the two.  T + M: Very deep roasted malts and coffee flavours. Some bitterness and a touch of astringency that stings a little. A creamy mouthfeel and light on the carbonation... almost like heavily creamed coffee in some ways.  D: Tasty, and somewhat candy line in some ways.

An incredibly intense bourbon aroma blends with a strong scent of both coffee and vanilla. Good backing of malty sweetness. A moderate amount of alcohol can be detected.  Initial taste on the tongue was a nice roasted coffee flavor. Bourbon quickly becomes apparent as well. A very minor vanilla blends with a nice malt back to show through at end of mouthful. Very tasty balance.  Nice and thick without being to much. A very light carbonation tingles as tastes clings.  An excellent beer. This one is good by itself after a nice meal.

That said, the mouthfeel is great in small doses.  T: The viscosity complements the super strong chocolate, coffee, molasses, and bourbon flavors. Somewhat sweet. Compared to a Goose Island BCS, the bourbon in KBS is relatively restrained.  A: Black with tan head.  Smell: Coffee, bourbon, and chocolate.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,CrellMoset,4.52,"Bottle courtesy of gford217 at a tasting at the home of proteus93. Poured into a Brooklyn-logoed footed pilsner glass.  Appearance: Poured a opaque black with a creamy coffee head with good retention and great lacing for the abv% and style. Creamy and foamy, this is one attractive looking brew.  Aroma: Unbelievably earthy, bitter coffee and oaky, woody bourbon. This is one dark, dark roast! Dark and light fruity esters and hints of vanilla, but this one's definitely all about the hardy roast and the bourbon. Fantastically pungent!  Taste: Coffee liquor basked in a wave of bourbon is the closest I can describe it. This is an incredibly pungently strong coffee-infused beer. There's some saltyness, but in the light of the coffee, it's reminiscent of ham or sausage, which is nice. Some breadyness and tons of oak and bourbon notes, and the vanilla comes through nicely because there's no complimentary chocolate - it's just all coffee.  Mouthfeel: Thick and syrupy, wonderfully even and creamy with a surprisingly modest feeling head - very smooth and mild, which improves the drinkability greatly.  Drinkability: A beer that's not perfect in any way but really damn good in every way. The darkest/best-infused coffee beer I've ever had - the coffee notes do indeed taste both artificial and real at the same time. It's slightly harsh in places, but wonderfully delicate in others. If you like bourbon, if you like coffee, this one's for you. Just a really nice beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ColoradoBobs,4.72,"Twelve ounce bottle as shown, obtained in a fantastic (and I DO mean FANTASTIC) trade with shbobdb.  Moderate pour into a New Belgium goblet yields a large chocolate reverse-cascading head over a completely opaque black-brown body, that is obviously thick and viscous. Looks like oil. Head fades fairly quickly, but as I swirl the liquid, lots of dark coating sticks to the inside of the glass and a smallish head returns.  Initial aroma is intensely and overtly vanilla and bourbon, then the coffee and dark chocolate rise up. Perhaps the strongest aroma of any of the 391 beers I've reviewed: you can literally smell this across the room, as if you poured into a warm sauce-pan a cup of warm bourbon and a cup of vanilla extract and a cup of espresso. As I sit here typing, the glass is two feet from my nose, and this beer is ALL I can smell.  Taste is somewhat in reverse order from the smell: espresso first, then the dark chocolate, then the bourbon, then the vanilla. And it's all excellent, and exceptionally straightforward. There is a bit of hops-bitterness in the finish, which dries things out a little, and balances the intense bourbon-vanilla sweetness. Indeed, I found my lips had a sweet taste on them after each swallow. INTENSE, but enough burned malt bitterness and hops to keep this beast from being cloyingly sweet. Honestly, this beer tastes fantastic, and the taste stays long.  Mouthfeel was a tiny bit thinner than I expected in view of the way the liquid coated the inside of the glass. Still, nice and round.  Obviously this beer is too strong for more than one. But the one is wonderfully drinkable.  Overall, a truly exceptional beer, solidly worthy of its lofty accolades. Thanks again to shbobdb for this terrific beverage. Memorable. Noteworthy.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,paco1029384756,4.79,"Pours black with a small, dark tan head that fades quickly into a thin ring of lacing.  Scent of bourbon and coffee dominate with some chocolate, vanilla and raisins in the background. There is a hint of alcohol, but it does not divert from the awesome scent.  Taste is mostly coffee, with a smooth chocolate and bourbon backbone. Roasted malts, some chocolate and raisins come in finishing dry. Wonderful bourbon flavor, but too much coffee flavor.  Mouthfeel is heavy and smooth, very enjoyable.  Drinkability is good, better than most beers its strength.  After a few months, this mellows into perfection with a strong sweet dark fruit presence in the scent with a nice coffee and bourbon presence still.  The taste is more of the same. Insanely rich with a lot of sweet dark fruit and sugars. The bourbon keeps it lively without being overpowering.  Served at cellar temperature, this beer is among the best I've ever had. I didn't think this beer was worth the hype before, but now I know that it exceeds the hype and then some.

Poured into my New Belgium snifter.  2 finger head took a few minutes to dial back.. looks like a thicker cappuccino.. pretty lacing... brew is completely pitch black.  Aroma is expected chocolate.. French roast.. and subtle bourbon... vanilla with some soft toasty oak.  Flavor is like boutique store fudge.. but spiked with coffee beans.. some coffee liquor.. deep dark dried fruits.. waves of milky chocolate mid palate... bourbon notes don't taste of alcohol, more like just what my mind imagines bourbon to be.. no burn.. just pure flavor from the beginning to the long luscious finish.... some coffee acidity as it hits room temperature. Body is thick and smooth.. velvety.. this is a sipping beer for sure..

The smell is medium on the bourbon with some faint coffee and vanilla tones  The taste is similar to the smell but the bourbon is much more up front and has a very faint smoke note  The mouth feel is very smooth and this goes down very easily, despite the alcohol content being high it is not offensive and does not hinder the drinkability, a sipper but a real treat for sure.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,bashiba,4.35,"Poured a thick dark syrupy black with a thin little dark tan head.  Smell was creamy sweet chocolate with a touch of vanilla and whiskey.  Flavor was bold and strong while still being pleasant. Some great dark black burnt malts and cereal taste along with nice bits of oak, chocolate, and vanilla with just a touch of whiskey. Leaves a long lasting slightly bitter and smokey hop residue.  Mouthfeel is thick and oily and a touch sticky. Has a nice touch of carbonation and plenty of warmth on the tongue.  Fairly easy to drink for a huge stout, I don't think its quite the masterpeace that the original breakfast stout is, or quite on the same level as Goose Island Bourban Stout, but a really great beer none the less.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Pours thick, impenetrable, obsidian black with a creamy lid of deep mocha coloring.  The nose is just as dark. Dark chocolate and dark roasted coffee, with molasseses, prunes, bourbon and pine.  KBS is a full, thick, creamy milkshake. It brings an organized ruckus of the nose in the same order, and in excellent balance.  I don't really have much more to say about this one. It is a great beer and it knows it. Not my favorite imperial stout, but that is no knock on it.

1199,19960,scootny,4.5,"12 oz bottle courtesy of hrking. Into my Brooklyn tulip tumbler. An extra dark brown liquid with a two finger dark tan head. Good lacing and retention as it gradually recedes. This stuff is appears to be clear but is so dark you can't see into it. It could have bubbles rising to the surface but who can tell.  Smell is chocolatey coffee and a whiff of the bourbon barrel. Dark whole grain breads and sweet caramel draw me in closer. I try to sniff out the alcohol but it hides very well.  Taste is soooo smoooth. This is a near perfect bourbon barrel aging. I taste a coffee like roasted malt followed by caramel sweetness. Chocolate follows with a subtle graininess. Then the bourbon shows itself as I swallow, turning a superb stout into a trip to Kentucky. Not just any trip but a first class tour of the finest distillery in the state. Smooth and mellow, long and smokey. I know there is alcohol there but it never calls attention to itself and I can't really separate it from the bourbon. It melts into the palate. A shade of vanilla. Finish is where you get a touch of alcohol blended into a strong but mellow hoppiness. More dark grain breads on the palate. This is so complex you need several to get it all down. Alas, I only have one. For now. I really owe the guy who traded me this one.  Moutfeel is somewhat syrupy as this is a thick brew. A little creaminess. Carbonation scrubs the syrup off the tongue and keeps it from getting too heavy. Nonetheless this is a girthy ale and small sips are best. It's too good to chug and your jaw could collapse from the weight, almost.  Drinkability is dangerous. You can't taste the alcohol but it is there. I still want another one regardless.

1199,19960,ASymon13,4.42,"This one pours a viscous black, with no visible light passing through it. It has almost no head, despite a fairly aggressive pour. The smell is full of black coffee, with some solid bourbon and roastiness. Kinda like a southern version of an irish coffee.  The coffee and bourbon really work magic in the flavor. Neither one is overpowering, and they complement eachother wonderfully. There is some slight hop bitterness that hits you early on, but mellows out very quick. There is a hint of anise, some very slight sweetness to it and a decent spicy alcohol twinge, but this beer really is all about the melding of coffee and bourbon, and the two flavors linger long afterwards. The carbonation is pretty low and the body is lighter than I expected. Overall, this is an excellent brew. A nice blend of southern goodness with some eye-opening coffee.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Looks a dark brown not much of a head for me.  Hops, coffee, bourbon, in that order. The bourbon is too strong for me. Its not a beer anymore. Its a bourbon with brewers yeasts.  Lingering bourbon aftertaste. Warms your cockels.  Great if you love bourbon, I dont like it though. Maybe aged it would be better.

Other secondary smells include dark bitter chocolate, rich bourbon and warming EtOH  It has the appearance of the night as most stouts do, with some amber/brown hughes in the corners in natural light. Little head  The taste is strongest with coffee initially and transitions well into other flavors including those mentioned smells above, as well as vanilla. The high ABV can be felt in the nostrils and on the tongue when sipping and gives an appealing warm sensation as it travels to your stomach.

The Bourbon really comes through even giving me a little of Whiskey shudders. Coffee is the next big flavor with it really coming out in the finish and coating your mouth with an espresso flavor.

I can even feel a little bit of whiskey burn. There is plenty of coffee here but it's like Irish Whiskey or something where you can definately taste the whiskey. And even though the overall character of the beer is really on the for front the bourbon and to a lesser degree the coffee seem to stand on that base and shout.

This is a totally different beer than the regular breakfast stout from Founder's ( one of my favorite craft brewer's). Bourbon is very present both in the nose and taste with a heavy coffee taste mixed in as well. Just go ahead and throw a shot of bourbon in a cup of day old cold coffee and you get the picture!

1199,19960,beachbum1975,4.65,"My 100th review, (FINALLY)!!!  Thanks to ajsdad06 for the trade & newtony for giving me the opportunity to try this beer!  Per ajsdad06, this is an '07 Vintage. 12 oz bottle with no freshness date.  A: Pours a thick, opaque, super dark brown/black beer with a rich and creamy dark tan head when agitated. Average size bubbles with lacing climbing up the walls. Slight ring of brown suds remain after the beer relaxes. This is one serious looking stout.  S: Rich, chocolates and bourbon. Espresso or French roast coffee. Slight sniff of dark, cherry sweets - delightful.  Taste: Rich and flavorful mix of fresh coffees, dark and bitter chocolate swirls, heavily toasted malts, caramel. A Starbucks delivery truck just collided with a Jim Beam truck! Little to no bitterness, likely because of the calming effect (buffering) of the oatmeal, expect what's given off from the heavily roasted coffee beans. Aftertaste of more and more coffee beans. Flavor lingers in my mouth for some time. Just the right amount of bourbon seeping through. Very enjoyable, sip and savor this one.  M: Medium to heavy bodied, creamy and sticks to the back of my throat. Low levels of carbonation. It's like drinking a chilled liqueur.  D: Very nice, extremely well-balanced stout. This is an amazingly-crafted brew, wish it wasn't so hard to get. Frankly, it surprises me this is defined as an imperial stout (and not a Russian Imperial Stout).

Quarter-inch tan-colored head subsided into a slick of foam with a solid ring around the shoulders. Jagged peaks and valleys of lacing, but adherence is somewhat spotty. Smell is decadent. Lots of coffee and molasses up front with a warm bourbon quality in the background. Dark fruit is revealed as the snifter warmed in my hand. Flavors offer a nice and balanced blend of the qualities presented in the nose. Coffee is roasty without tasting burnt or astringent. Cocoa flavors are detected as well. Bourbon character is complementary rather than over-assertive. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and silky up front; not at all viscous. A little chalky, but not unpleasantly so.

1199,19960,biegaman,4.47,"Founders KBS is completely impenetrable by light, even when held directly up to the source. The body is midnight black. Unlike the regular Breakfast Stout, which has a clear brown hue on its edges, this has a distinct maroon tinge. No head and only a slim lining along its outer rim.  The aroma is no one thing; elements of bourbon, chocolate, oak, and coffee are all seamlessly blended together. It smells like charred/roasted wood with accompanying hints of dark chocolate truffles, bitter cocoa, and freshly crushed coffee beans.  The oak is ever present in the mouthfeel - incredibly so - evoking a true sensation of wood on palate. You not only taste, but even more so feel, as much (if not more) oak as you do bourbon. It is quite drying on the palate.  Not to say the bourbon isn't present - oh, it is - and you are reminded with each sip, and also for a long, soothing period after each sip. The bourbon might seem initially faint in taste, but compounds, by the second, until eventually it is resounding through the mouth and crawling through every part of the palate.  With it, of course, comes the taste of bourbon, which lends just a pinch of vanilla to compete alongside flavours of heavily roasted malts, burnt caramel, bitter coffee beans, and dark, dark, (really, really dark) chocolate.  The alcohol in this one is sneaky - you know it's there somewhere but it never lets itself be known. Make no mistake - the drink is strong. But while at times I felt it raising my eyebrows, or opening my nostrils, and certainly, by the end, slowing my blood rate and lightening my head, I never could catch it in the act.  In all honesty, I found this a little raw and certainly a little stiff, but I won't argue about it - this beer is certainly one for the senses!

1199,19960,raiser,4.9,"Poured from bottle into glass beer mug at about 55F. Stouts deserved to be served at around room to cellar temp (55-65) for best effect.  Appearance - Dark Chocolate Brown, nearly black, with light but full carbonation, a creamy 1 finger tan head that lasts several minutes. I want to drink this before the head settles.  Smell - Smokey roasty malts, sweet chocolaty, and caramelly. I want to drink this immediately!  Taste - DARK CHOCOLATE! This is like drinking a candy bar. Not a lot of complexity here, overpowering chocolate with a strong backup of bourbon. can totally taste the 10% ABV, but it's subdued, mellow and not overpowering, probably owing to the bourbon flavoring. A little bit of a smokey finish which is very nice and makes me want to immediately take another swig. I absolutely LOVE dark chocolate, this instantly became one of my favorite beers ever.  Mouthfeel - A nice heavy, but smooth mouthfeel. Carbonation is just right and the immense flavor is intensified with a little time in the mouth. I love stouts and this is right up there with the best of them.  Drinkability - I could drink a 4-pack of these, if the 10% alcohol content didn't knock me unconscious first. This stuff not only tastes great but it packs a wallop. I can see why those who can obtain it not only hoarde it, but are only willing to trade limited quanities. I managed to get four through TWO trades, but I already want more.  Verdict - If you like stout, and/or you like dark chocolate, don't waste any time seeking this out. This is an amazing beer, a classic. I would put this above Abyss, and even above Speedway in my tastings. Though Abyss should age the best and Speedway would be enjoyed more by those who prefer coffee to chocolate.

1199,19960,Wetpaperbag,4.5,"acquired in trade from akorsak, thanks man.  A- Pour was a very thick black stream of goodness. The semi aggressive pour developed a nice two finger head with lacing that seemed to go from light to dark tan the closer it got to the beer. A nice slick of head remained to grace the top of the beer.  S- The smell of bourbon is very there. The sweet vanilla sent as well as nice oaky earthy smell. Almost like a dusty wood shop.  T- The smell is sweet, yet there is a nice bitterness. The aftertaste is a bit on the dry side, which is good it makes me want more. The presence of the 10% abv is there the entire way down. The alcohol seems to play peek-a-boo with the taste buds.  M- Nice smooth and easy to drink. It is very tasty.  D- Easy to drink, almost too easy. I'm getting a nice buzz while drinking it.

1199,19960,dedrinker,3.87,"Big shout out to ""Med"" for sending me this bottle. Blacker than your average imperial stout - barely any light at the edges. There was a minimal tan head, perhaps due to its age (I am uncertain of its age) because I am sure my brandy snifter is ""beer clean."" The aroma is utterly beguiling. An amazing balance of coffee, vanilla, cocoa, milk duds, bourbon and that decades of candy and soda smell from old 7-11's, Highs, or the candy aisle in an old drug store. Also a hint of suburban decaying strip-mall hair/ nail salon with the chocolate/ candy store next door from the 80's. All in balance. I have been sitting here for ten minutes just smelling the damn thing. Flavor is all of the above with the addition of a High's blue Slushie and boozy alcohol. The bourbon/vanilla/ chocolate factor is very forward, and I'm afraid the strong alcohol presence lifts the flavors up a little out of balance and becomes somewhat harsh. Full body with a hot boozy and acidic finish that brings back some bourbon and vanilla notes. Objectively I will say that this is a must have for imperial/ coffee stout fans, though on drinkability I must go low, because I am not going to finish this thing. But damn its good to finally have one.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Gueuzedude,4.2,"Pours into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip with an almost two-finger thick, cocoa stained, dark tan colored head. The beer is a thick black color that shows no light through it. Ample roasted grain notes of black coffee and charcoal are joined by a sort of chalky note that is almost musty (though not quite). Dark chocolate aromas couple with a rich nuttiness and a solid toasted bread crust note are found just behind the huge coffee character that even provides a touch of tartness to the aroma. Despite being such a huge stout, this actually seems to be dominated by the coffee aromatics, though it is offset at times by the nice chocolate aromatics. I don't really get much in the way of Bourbon character in the aroma, which is actually a promising sign for me.  Thick and chewy up front, yet with such a huge roast malt and coffee character that it never becomes overly sweet. The beer finishes with a hit of Bourbon barrel flavors that provide a touch of vanilla and a deep buttery note that lingers for quite some time in the finish. Up front rich chocolate notes are quite noticeable (providing some balance to the roast character), these notes stick around some times through to the finish, where the Bourbon dominates, and are joined by a deep, toasted, nutty flavor. After the first sip, that initial wave of strong Bourbon notes seems to die down some; likely my palate just got used to it, but it becomes much more in balance with the rest of the beer. This definitely has a touch of tartness to it that is a result of both the ample burnt / roast notes (both coffee and grain) as well as some of the Bourbon influence. The finish also has a touch of hot Bourbon alcohol to it that is noticeable more as an aromatic oral nasal thing, but definitely makes me feel like I am exhaling alcohol.  At times a certain fruit character is noticeable that makes me think of sour prunes, figs and raisins; all of which have been left under the broiler to develop a bit of char. As the beer warms up and loses a bit of carbonation it becomes much more creamy textured and smooth, it also becomes much more mocha / chocolate flavored than it was previously, almost richly so.  I am not sure if my nose is not quite working tonight or what, but I am quite surprised how little of the Bourbon barrel influence is noticeable in the aroma. In the end the balance between roast character and smooth chocolate become really nice, the Bourbon barrel seems to meld into the background such that it supplies a nice complexity; so definitely serves this more towards 59°F / 15°C to get the best flavor balance. Much better and much more balanced than I was expecting; definitely a very good, moderate use of Bourbon Barrel character and coffee if drunk on the warm side.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Bourbon, chocolate and vanilla take over the smell of this brew with hints of coffee in the background.  T. From the first sip, your tastebuds are attacked with flavors of chocolate, vanilla, oak bourbon, and coffee. Chocolate and coffee are dominant at the beginning, then as it warms, the bourbon flavor start to take over. vanilla and oak remain the whole way through but never peak as dominant as the other three.  M. mouthfeel is wonderfully full and rich  D. Drinkability is amazingly smooth for a 10%er. not sure the stomach could hang with too many as it's quite filling, but I'd like to find out how many I could put down before the stomach says ""no mas"".

The head faded quickly and left no lacing around the glass. Aromas of bourbon, chocolate, and vanilla, and a slightly burnt smell to it.  Taste is very nice. A nice smooth (but not overpowering) bourbon flavor, as well as coffee, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and oak. Didn't get any coffee in the smell, but it's definitely there in the taste. Chocolate flavors are also much more pronounced. There's also a slight burnt flavor mixed in there, and some alcohol warming. It's quite sweet up front, from the bourbon aging, and very bitter in the finish. The sweetness is almost a bit overpowering, the balance needs just a bit of work.  Feel is pretty nice. Very smooth and creamy for a bourbon stout. Carbonation level is just right, it's not too thick and just a bit sticky. Drinkability is pretty good. The bitter/sweet-ness of it gets to me after awhile. And the alcohol kinda creeps up on me.  A very good bourbon stout, probably the best I've had. Though perhaps a bit more age would balance it out some more. Probably a bit over-hyped, but still very good.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ejquin,4.59,"A: Black with brown/black head that fades relatively quickly and leaves slight lacing on glass.  S: Coffee dominates with nice vanilla oak notes. Milk chocolate and espresso with a little bit of alochol  T/M: It's semi-heavy and smooth with good carbonation. Lots of coffee, though not as much as I would have thought from the nose. Fades to oaky and smoky vanilla fading to espresso bitterness with a touch of fruit in there (bourbon soaked cherries). Some spice comes in at the end along with the alochol in a very bourbouny way. Finish leaves some warmth on your throat and some sting on the tounge. Definitely well balanced. The bourbon aging in some beers tends to dominate the flavor, but while prominent, it fits in nicely here and never throwns the beer out of wack. As it warms the bourbon notes become more pronounced, and come close to overtaking the beer, but it ends up working.  D: For a 10% abv stout that's barrell aged it's quite high on the dinrkinbility.  Ovr: Really good stout. I was expecting a ton, and I don;t know that it lived up to every expectation I had, but all in all it was a really good example of a barell aged stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Poured this into my Duvel tulip at a little bit below cellar temp. A nice aggressive pour gives a thick dark brown 1.5 inch head. This beer is dark and viscous, just pouring it out of the bottle looked and smelled like fresh brewed coffee. It has thick full lacing all over the glass. The smell while its still cool is just completely dominated by great fresh brewed coffee and espresso beans. As it warms up I get lots of chocolate and a hint of bourbon but the coffee just completely dominates for me. The taste is just incredible. Perfect balance of roasted malts, coffee, vanilla oakiness, and chocolate. One of the best tasting imperial stouts I have ever had. The mouthfeel is nice and thick and viscous. I could seriously drink this all night at anytime. I definitely see why they call it a breakfast stout with this much coffee flavor but I love it.

Poured into a brandy snifter just before post time, slightly cooler than room temp. Oozed out of the bottle coffee black with a very thin film of milk-chocolate colored head, which didn't stick around.  First whiff was heaven. Smells like Kahlua, with some barrel wood background and a hint of prune.  Tilted back during the singing of ""My old Kentucky Home"", and what an experience. A delicious and complex brew, with nicely balanced chocolatey/smokey/coffee flavor, notes of prune and bourbon, enhanced by a mild alcohol warmth.  Mouthfeel was thinner than expected (I expected syrupy) but full bodied nonetheless, with practically zero carbonation. Left a tanniny coating on the palate as a nice cabernet wine would.  Alcohol is well masked but packs a whallop.

1199,19960,grandq,4.57,"Tried this one side by side with Founders Breakfast Stout (i know, different beers, etc). A lot of similarities but this one goes the extra mile. Pours pretty much pitch black, getting almost zero head in spite of my best efforts. What's there is a very dark tan. Smells of bourbon (duh), molasses, pear, coffee grounds, maple, and some raisins/dark fruit. A bit more ""twang"" than the FBS, likely the sweet bourbon soaked fruit and slightly more evident alcohol. Taste shows much of the same but in heavier doses: deeper raisin and prune to the profile here, more pronounced hop bite in tandem with peppery alcohol esters, a lot of oak with a kiss of vanilla. Coffee takes more of a background to the oak here and is balanced out by the bourbon sweetness. Overall, in spite of being heavier in the abv department, this seems to address any imbalance issues that show up in FBS. The mouthfeel is thick and coating as one expects from the style, and its overall a really tasty, nicely layered stout - though I'd say there are more complex out there, particularly Abyss. I'd raid the local if this were available here - top notch. Big cheers to autumnaldave for the bottle.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Sweet chocolate malts, faint coffee, and a discernibly oakiness combine with a slight fruitiness to promise a full treat to the tongue to follow. Taking a sip is an explosion of flavor. As mentioned, chocolate, coffee, oak, and fruit, but also a spiciness, vanilla, and bourbon. The mix of flavors is simultaneously infinitely complex and yet amazingly satisfying.

1199,19960,throwitallaway,4.66,"Thanks to saucya for this one! Poured from bottle into snifter. Very dark with absolutely no head at all. Big aromas of coffee, chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla, with some alcohol underneath. Probably the best smelling beer I've had in the short time I've been a beerhead. Big taste of coffee, bourbon, and vanilla, with a bit of chocolate underneath. Alcohol warms the throat, but isn't nearly as noticeable as I thought it would be in such a big beer. Mouthfeel is right in the middle where I like it. Drinkability is surprisingly high considering the style. This beer definitely lives up to its hype, nicely balancing the flavors from the barrel with the flavors from the beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,DHGranstrand,5,"Special thanks to tprokop7 for the KBS!!  Poured aggressively into a pounder produced a great 2"" creamy light brown head.  Incredible nose of milk chocolate, espresso, bourbon and malt.  Tastes of bitter chocolate, strong coffee and licorice followed by bourbon and alcohol.  Velvety liquid with a myriad of complex flavors swirling around.  I had to give this stout the highest ratings possible. There is nothing you could do to improve on this beer short of having more of them! Simply incredible! No hype here, just incredibly well-balanced and full flavored.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Lothore,4.32,"A- Pours a nice black color letting no light pass through with a small, mocha head.  S- Smell has a whole lot going on. Strong coffee, bourbon notes, a sort of syrupy sweetness, roasted malt.  T- Starts off with sweet dark fruit notes and moves into a strong but balanced bourbon taste which lightens into coffee that lasts quite a while.  M- Thick and creamy with appropriate carbonation.  D- This is a sipper but honestly it is the best of the style that I have experienced. I don't put much stock in Imperial stouts but if you are going to try one, this is the one to try.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,jessecarr,5,"On Tap at Andy's Corner with my dudes-- hopflop and JM.  This was the first beer I had on the Founder's tap night at Andy's Corner. I was trying to think of a metaphor for this beer, something to compare the complexity, luxury, and beauty of this beer. It's a true wonder. I told my fellow-Geeks that this was one of the best beers I've ever tasted--not necessarily because it's the ""best"" stout or the ""best"" whatever other category. This beer is it's own genre.  If this sounds like it's a bit gushing, well... it should be. The Kentucky Bourbon Stout has the appearance of other breakfast stouts--a tan-ish head and dark brown body--but the comparisons sort of stop there. The smell is truly wonderful. I kept smelling the glass over and over to catch the prominent bourbon scent. The bourbon is not overly-aggressive, and it fuses with the mocha and caramel scents as well. the head is minimal, the lacing is there, but the taste is what knocks this beer into its own stratosphere.  Upon the first sip, I was blown away--almost surprised. I expected something quite different, and I had to quickly take another sip. It has a prominent bourbon taste at first while the pour was still a bit cold. The hints of bourbon subside, however, once the glass warms. Then the nuances of caramel and stout emerge.  It is extremely balanced. The alcohol is not pungent or off-putting at all. It really is something to try and comprehend.  It takes a while to find the proper way to describe it. I still haven't figured out how. And that's a wonderful thing.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,StonyB,4.3,"In New Jersey! Who'd have thought? From Andy's Corner Bar, on-tap. Here we go...  Appearance - Deep black, just a hint of light. A bubbly cap of cappucino foam. Lacing as thick as rubber cement. A beauty.  Smell - Wow. Coffee, Kahlua, bourbon, roasted malt. A ton of stuff going on. Very complex, yet very aromatic.  Taste - Bourbon, surprisingly strong. Butter, vanilla, cappucino. Big alcohol warmth. Interesting, complex.  Mouthfeel - Slick and oily texture. Medium-bodied. Well-attenuated.  Drinkability - Huge ABV, monster sipper. Complex and tasty, but not a session beer in any way.  A unique beer, the bourbon leading the charge to what may be an unprecedented extent. Enjoyable, thought-provoking. A perfect nightcap. Absolutely recommended.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,DavidSeanNJ,4.7,"On-Tap at Andy's for the Founder's promo night.  Poured into a wine-shaped glass, small, but ample enough to hold a good amount of KBS.  A- Extremely dark black liquid filled the glass. Beautiful creamy brown head lingered on top. Some lace lingered through the entire duration of consumption.  S- The nose is of bourbon and vanilla. I did detect a strong alcohol presence in the nose as well.  T- First sip was sweet and milky like vanilla ice cream. The next couple of sips were robust and heavy with flavors of black coffee, espresso beans, and some oak like flavors. There was a fruit presence in some sips, but not in all. Fruit was faint, but it certainly was there. Finishes up with a HUGE bourbon taste, think the best kentucky bourbon you have ever had.  M- Mouthfeel was creamy and full bodied, but surprisingly smooth.  D- Amazing beer.

He posted a note in the Midwest forum that a Hudson store rec'd a case or two & I promptyly left home for the 25 minute drive that netted me my first Kentucky Breafast Stout. Last ones in Chicone's!  Even a hard pour gets only a bit of head - I think all of the beer's energy is going into its unique weirdness with nothing leftover for show. And as is proper for an Imperial Stout, it's a very dark version of black. The smell's a little disappointing. COFFEE, it screams. As it warms it gets a little more subtle, but there's still nothing else. I think I could slip this into my wife's coffee mug & she'd never notice the difference until it hit her tongue.  Taste is...strange. I think this is the most complex beer I've ever tasted & for that I have to give it props. There's the coffee, the bourbon, & all sorts of other stuff I can't identify. Again, as it warms to its proper temp, the beer gets better.  Mouthfeel is thick & full, stout-like. Drinkability is really good, it's going to take me an hour at least to down this, the only note is there's a touch *too* much coffee to make it perfectly drinkable.  Overall, really good, but there's still two stouts I'd put above it.

1199,19960,bassmantin,5,"I'm drinking the 2008 vintage about a month after its release. I recently had a vertical with the 2007, and in my opinion, this beer does not age well. I think it loses a lot of the great coffee taste. Most stouts age well because they mellow, but the greatness of the KBS is its strong, harsh, coffee malts, and those fade over time. Drink it fresh. Now to the review.  The color is a very dark brown with a nice little tan head. The smell is overpowering. It has that strong coffee flavor of the BS, but the added bourbon aroma is delicious. The taste lives up to everything the smell promises. The bourbon is so delicious... strong oak notes, vanilla, and general bourbon overtones. Oh my, what a unique beer.  The alcohol is also quite well-concealed given that this is a 10% beer. This greatly helps the drinkability.  I swear, I think this beer is perfect. You must try it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The alcohol is well hidden in the beer.  M-Has a nice mouthfeel very thick and creamy...this is how a stout should be.  D-So I've had this beer before on tap and in bottle I love this beer so much I would like to freeze it into ice cubes and skate on it. I could drink it all day/night long.

T-A smooth, sweet chocolate flavor in the front, followed by vanilla and dark fruit, with some caramel on the finish...then some nice alcohol warmth after.  M-Creamy and smooth. The chocolate-caramel taste linger nicely on the tongue.  D-Very drinkable despite the strong bourbon character.  A much hyped beer that lives up to the hype.

Very well balanced smell and not overly bourbony. Taste is equally as well balanced with rich dark chocolate like roasty malt, a touch of vanilla, stong oak flavor, a touch of bourbon, and bold coffee flavors.

Notes of chocolate, vanilla. Hard to make out anything else.  M: My biggest let down of this beer. It felt very thin, and was hoping for something a little 'thicker'. Though the light carbonation works well.  D: Def a sipper. I cracked it almost an hour and half ago, and still working on it. Not a bad thing at all.  Overall, tasty... and I'm enjoying it very much.

1199,19960,quad07,4.73,"I was lucky to get this find. The way I understand it was a hard to find this year. I purchased a four pack at UFS. $16.99 for a four pack of 12oz bottles with twist off caps. No bottled date that I could find. I picked up two four packs but after shopping I decided to put one back out of the four left of six. Hope others had a chance at this one. After all I only needed one. I'm just one of the lucky ones to try it this year.  A little like Founders Oatmeal breakfast stout, KBS has some similar characteristics. When I pored into my glass it had a very dark black motor oil color to it. When I held it up to the light I could barely make out what looked to be a ruby wine Hughes highlights around the outer edge of the glass. The head was small & a rocky mud color that went away very quickly. Very little lacing left behind while drinking it.  It had a very pleasant smell of coffee a little oats bourbon and very little notes of hops. To my surprise I did not find it strong or over powering at all. There was not a strong alcohol smell at all.  I could taste coffee, dry oats and a mild taste of wooden aged bourbon. I thought it would be a lot stronger. The ABV bite got stronger as it warmed up. Not to say that is a bad thing at all.  It felt rich silky and bitter sweet in my mouth with lots of flavor and no noticeable carbonation.  I enjoyed slowly drinking it and I think the four pack was my limit. A very tasty and pleasant treat. I think every one should try it once.

Notes of cream, espresso roast coffee, and sweet alcohol.  Palate is bombarded with a silky-slick bitterness followed by a deep molasses, maltiness. After taste reminds me of a caffeinated Yoohoo which leaves a warm, alcohol finish. Mouth is left a bit tart.  A very nice offering and glad I was fortunate to run across a couple of these gems.

Flavor ended with much of the same but almost became sweeter from chocolate and less of the bitter coffee taste.

A: The beer is a deep black color, with a very thin brown head that fades quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is of roasted coffee, vanilla, creamy chocolate, oats and dark malts.  T: The taste is very malty with strong roasted flavors of coffee, vanilla and chocolate as you would expect. There's a significant alcohol sting and a mild hops presence, but there's also a nice balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet.  M: Crisp and very smooth, medium-to-heavy body, light-to-medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.  D: Tasty, goes down easily for a beer with 10.00% ABV, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is one of those good big stouts that is worth drinking for a while until the ABV catches up to you.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,gmcfarre,4.4,"12 oz bottle poured into snifter Thanks to orbitalr0x for the trade  A - Pours a piercing black that spills out the bottle mouth like oil. Head is small but a very nice latte color. A sheet of lacing slowly falls when tipped, leaving spots of lace on the glass. Incredibly dark and opaque.  S - Scent of crisp toasted/burnt malt and alcohol with a strong vanilla flavor. A touch of coffee that grows more prominent as it warms. Alcohol has a strong oak context that is earthy and interesting.  T - Starts with a mild sweetness and then a quick wallop of strong oak flavor. Vanilla comes on strong, with a hint of coffee bitterness. Roasted and nearly burnt malt. Aftertaste is sharp with alcohol and maybe some drying hop bitterness, as well as some residual sweetness on the tongue.  M - Moderate carbonation with a full and very oily mouthfeel. Very interesting mouthfeel on the tongue, as midsip its many flavors seem to dance on the palate with a tingle. I've never had that sensation in a beer before.  D - Alcohol plays a strong role in this beer, both in flavor and effect. Very different from any other strong stout I've had, although I don't think any of those have been aged in oak barrels for a full year. Lives up to the hype, but not a beer I'd want to have everyday with its very oaky flavor. This is definitely a sipper.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Then it starts to get complicated. Secondary aromas include roasted malt, molasses, vanilla, milk chocolate, cherries, warm alcohol, earthy wood, and the list just keeps going.  T - Taste follows smell and is also complex. Coffee and espresso hit the palate first. Flavors of bourbon really come through strong in the flavor. They are followed by some roasted notes and bittersweet chocolate. Bitter friut and a warming alcohol are on the tail end.  M - Full bodied and creamy. Bittersweet finish that lingers for a long time and ends up being more bitter than sweet.  D - Drinkability is good. This is a strong full bodied beer that is very smooth.

Smell is dominated by sweet coffee. Bourbon is present but not overpowering.  Taste starts with coffee, with bourbon as the second fiddle again. Becomes more prevalent as it warms. A nice change from some BA's that are like taking a shot of Maker's every sip. However, the bourbon adds a sourness that I wasn't expecting. So, a little taken off for that.

1199,19960,deltatauhobbit,4.34,"Thanks to hrking for the chance to try this top ranked brew. Hard to believe Founders uses screw tops for this beer. 2008 release.  Pours a jet black color, even with an aggressive pour there was very little head, what head there was disappeared fairly fast leaving no lacing. The color is perfect for a stout, but the lack of head is quite disappointing.  Wow, all coffee, seriously can't make out much more than an intense coffee aroma with only a slight bourbon scent, makes me almost wonder if I'm smelling a beer at all. Seems a bit one-sided of an aroma and not particularly complex, what's lacking in complexity though is made up by shear strength of what there is.  *As it warms up though, the bourbon aspect becomes more prominent and the coffee aroma takes the backseat, depending on what you prefer, drink it cold for coffee, warm for bourbon.  Taste has an intense coffee presence with the bourbon aspect being more subtle, nice low carbonation level that works quite well, very thick and sticky in the mouth, bitterness in the aftertaste as well as some alcohol notes, but while drinking the alcohol is virtually masked.  *Like the smell department, the taste becomes more affected by the bourbon aging, the alcohol in the beer also is more noticeable as a result of the bourbon taking hold.  *Revised for changes in temperature",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smell - Strong coffee nose leading to a bit of an alcoholic ""ping"". Roasted Malt, roasted malt and more roasted malt providing a strong bridge drawing you into the depths of the darkness below.  Taste - Read a previous review citing a ""chocolate fudge cake"", yep, that does sum it up. A strong roasted malt entry leading to very smooth middle, ending with a mild alcoholic finish.

1199,19960,EliteDigger,4.73,"Where do I begin? I'll start by saying this is the second year I've been fortunate enough to have bottles this wonderful brew after having it for quite a few years at the Great Taste. I have 4 still sitting in my cellar from last year, but upon further reflection after having a fresh '08 vintage this evening, I think in a very close battle, I prefer the fresh to the aged (although the aged was marvelous too, but more subdued.) This review is of the fresh version... A-Black. That's it. Nothing more needed. Black enough, that when I pour it into my glass, I expect a vortex to form and see everything being sucked in. A small dark brown head forms for a short while but disappears quickly. And man, is this stuff viscous. I don't think I could drain motor oil after 7000 hard driving miles into my glass and have it look darker and coat my glass more than this. S-I started to drink it slightly cooler than I should have due to the fact that I could not wait for this to warm up to room temp. Aromas of Coffee, Chocolate, and Bourbon assault my nose, more strongly as it warms. Delicious smelling indeed. T-The smell is amplified in the taste... Flavors of Chocolate, dark and bitter, Coffee, strong and black, hints of oak and leather ride a tide of vanilla and bourbon, like a black wave of some dark forbidden army, assaulting and descending upon my mouth.... Warriors of hops hang in reserve... I know they're there...hidden...waiting... while archers of booziness loose waves of bourbon stained black arrows from all sides. M-Smooth and silky, but carbonated and coating. Actually more carbonated than I would imagine when pouring it into my glass, but a pleasurable blanket covers my tongue, soothing it with warm and intoxicating hints of alcohol. D-The only thing that hurts this is the higher ABV. On taste alone, I could drink this often. Even with the strength, I'd easily love to have 2 or 3 in a sitting. An outstanding brew from Founders and easily one of my top 5 favorite beers to look forward to every year. Pleasure in a bottle.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Goliath,4.5,"This beer pours black and is completely opaque. Two fingers of dark brown head develop on top of this brew with decent retention and some lacing.  The aroma is beautiful. There is huge coffee in the nose, bitter dark chocolate, vanilla, and some caramel sweetness.  Taste is equally as delicious as the aroma. There is a big bitter chocolate note, black coffee, dark roasted malts that are almost burnt. Some vanilla from the oak, and a slight bit of alcohol. I expect this beer will stand up well to some aging.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, very thick and chewy. Carbonation is low, but very appropriate. The mouthfeel on this beer is perfect. It's exactly how I like my stouts.  Drinkability is great. The amazing flavor of this beer makes for an easy consumption, however because the flavor is so strong and the alcohol is high it slows and limits the consumption.  World class. Very happy I finally got some.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ABCJiugui,3.5,"Edit- second bottle No date on bottle, but aged at least 3 months (according to the store I bought it from).  A- same as below- head is minimal, even if the pour is hard, dissipates quickly with no lacing to speak of. Then again, what are you expecting with an RIS of this kind? For what it is, it is pleasant to look at.  S- milder coffee (this is a big difference), vanilla is more present. Bourbon is still a bit lacking (again, my experience is limited). Alcohol tingle is milder upon exhale than a fresh bottle.  T- MUCH milder coffee bitterness. Still present, just not overpoweringly acrid and out of balance as in a fresh bottle. Sweetness is more obvious as a result and flavors are more in balance- not particularly chocolate as some might think, but there is a roasted malt sweetness that comes thru. Bitterness is more reserved due to age (drank with smoked fish and fatty foods).  M- mild carbonation at this point, smooth, full bodied, but not chewy- still a little slick.  Overall, an AGED bottle, even one as few as a couple months, makes a world of difference for me. If you enjoy the coffee flavor, drink it fresh by all means. As for the bourbon/wood flavors, it's still muted, but a bit more pronounced with age as things are more in balance without the coffee overpowering everything. I also drank mine with smoked salmon and eggs, so it was more fitting as a literal ""breakfast"" stout, and the fat perhaps blunted the coffee onslaught. I still don't think this warrants anything near its price, and fresh, I was tempted to toss it outright.  NOTE: I can only recommend a few months of aging- accounts from beer buyers at wine shops I frequent have mentioned the flavor being quite bad when past 1 year or close to it. As I have yet to have this experience, I'd limit my recommendation for aging to a few months.  First review 3/23/08 bottle from a fresh 4 pack, poured into small tulip, no date.  A- opaque dark brown with lighter brown edges against light. head is espresso foam colored, dissipates quickly into thin rim around that leaves surprisingly good initial lace.  S- Coffee outright (not espresso, but black coffee). Oak wood/woody smell is also strong (perhaps this is the bourbon wood smell, I'm not that familiar with bourbon). Vanilla was apparent when I ATE something with vanilla extract in it (in this case, homemade biscotti), otherwise I can't smell it over the coffee and oakiness. Finishes very coffee in the nose upon exhale, and almost smoky (I assume due to the oak aging).  T- Slightly sweet, quickly goes to sharp coffee finish, first sips reveal refreshing hop bitterness- citric in nature, leaving the impression that the beer is drier than it actually is. Both coffee and hops linger to tickle/tingle the mouth a good bit. Really reminds me of a cup of black coffee with a couple sugars in it. I don't know think that's a good thing- more malt and sweetness would have given a better balance, as well as more muted coffee bitterness.  M- Smooth, light but sharp carbonation. Surprisingly light in feel in the mouth- not nearly as viscous as one might expect from 10abv.  Overall, a nice american double imperial stout, but not the greatest. It has its own particular coffee forward character, but for me, it doesn't warrant such high praise- my own taste leans towards sweeter chocolate stouts (I tasted/smelled very little chocolate in this, despite what others wrote). I do feel the coffee and woody flavor is quite overpowering in comparison to other components- again, more malt and sweetness would offer more balance to this beer. I fear labeling this beer overrated, but on a personal subjective basis, this is not an all timer for me. I do have 4 more bottles to try, so perhaps my view will change, as I think my expectation for something thicker and more sweet may have colored my judgment. In the end, a nice (particularly if you love coffee), but not great beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,toolbrew,4.82,"Poured an opaque, dark-brown, almost black, with dark brown head. Thick beer  Smells like chocolate. I can smell the oak too from the bourbon barrels.  Initially you get the chocolate sensation in the taste. That fades away to get a sweet vanilla flavor. Little bit of acidty at the end, but not overwhelming. Slight taste of the alcohol but it is hidden well by the chocolate taste.  It's thick. Light on the front of the tongue but you feel the weight in the back of the mouth. Tingling sensation on the roof and in the throat.  I would restrict myself to one beer at a special occasion, ONLY because of the limited release. And because I don't have to budget to tear through my 4-pack in one sitting.  Love this beer!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,DavidEddie,4.72,"March 2008 release.  Pitch black in appearance. Tan head falls to some moderate lacing. Inviting aromas of sweet bourbon, tons of oak, molasses, and dark roasted coffee. Rich flavors of oak, dark chocolate, black coffee, vanilla, and roasted malt. Then finishes with a bit of bitter hops and some oak seems to linger. The AVB is warming, but hidden well. Mouth feel is creamy and smooth. Good carbonation and slightly sticky. Drinkability is fantastic. Very easy to sip on for such a complex barrel aged Imperial Stout. Highly recommended!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Tilley4,5,"I have to start by giving a big Thanks! to antzman for holding this 4 pack for me. You're awesome!  On a whim, I decided to crack the first of these open tonight and share with the wifey. It oozes out of the bottle deep space black with a very small caramel head. This looks very deep and dark and foreboding...  The heavenly aroma of coffee and chocolate rush my sense of smell as I inhale deeply. I've smelled great stouts before but this one is special...different somehow. Touches of bourbon intermingle with the chocolate and coffee giving this the best aroma of any beer ever..  I can't really expound on the hundreds of descriptions given to this legendary brew and I won't even try. It's fantastic...simply fantastic. Loads of coffee, chocolate, bourbon, and even hints of vanilla assault the tastebuds as this one goes down and the wife and I instantly know we are in rare company.  I was expecting this to be good but not this good. I've heard the hype about this one for a while and couldn't believe that it could be that good. I was wrong. This is, without a doubt, the best Imperial Stout that I've ever had. Not because it's harder to get, not because of the hype. It just tastes, smells, looks, and feels better than the rest. The remaining 3 will be shared by the wife and I and maybe a few close friends as I don't expect to ever have my hands on this brew again. Thanks again, antzman, for making this happen..",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,adams82,5,"Pours black, opaque, with a 2 finger tan head. Smells of dark roasted coffee, bourbon, chocolate and tastes very much the same.  The flavour is intense. Coffee and chocolate dominate, then a kick of bourbon, a little alcohol, vanilla, hazelnut, more bourbon, coffee and chocolate. Heavily roasted flavors dominate this beer with the mellow chocolate and bourbon offering balance while the vanilla and hazelnut round everything out. Very complex, very tasty, very delicious and very, very worthy of a perfect 5.  Easy drinking for such an intense and flavorful beer and this really begs to be made available all year long. The bourbon character is present, but not dominating like most oaked or bourbon beers I have had. It complements the other flavors and helps round everything out, making this quite possibly, the best beer I have ever had in my entire life.  There is no hype surrounding this beer... It has earned it's legendary status.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

You know just from the initial smell this is going to awesome.  Initial taste is a quick hint of vanilla followed immediately by a coffee/chocolate taste then a kick bourbon. Then the tastes seem to reverse in the finish followed by a lingering bourbon roasted malt flavor. Wonderful.  The feel in the mouth is heavy and rich. Very rich.  This thing is highly drinkable.

Coffee. Vanilla. Alcohol. Bourbon. Toffee. The Coffee Beanery. Freshly roasted. More bourbon on the back end.  T - Bliss. Perfectly balanced. I was afraid it wouldn't live up to the hype but it really has. Tastes exactly as it smells but slightly more intense on all flavors. Different nuances with every sip. Bourbon finish is constant and wonderful. Alcohol warms the tummy but doesn't burn my mouth. The warmer it gets the more you taste the actual barrel.  M - Creamy, thick, viscous. Carbonated coffee.

1199,19960,eberkman,4.18,"Pours a completely opaque sludgy black into a big wine glass -- almost oozes from the bottle. Nothing comes through, even when held directly up against the light. Soft, frothy mocha-colored head rises up about a finger and gradually diminishes but keeping its presence on the surface, never totally going away. Memorializes itself well with lacing.  Aromas of strong, bitter, dark-roasted coffee with some hints of molten chocolate cake. A deep inhalation reveals some serious spirits going on there too -- you really sense the bourbon at that stage.  The taste is dominated by vanilla and toffee up front, giving way to dark, 70-percent cacao Belgian chocolate and coffee, coffee and coffee. Some hints of dark ripe fruits -- cherries, prunes, berries -- and a massive bourbon jolt giving way to a bitter re-emergence of the dark-roast coffee in the finish. This is the definition of an absolutely huge beer.  Sticky, thick and oozy on the tongue and in the mouth. Definitely some there there.  This is an enjoyable sipper but the intensity, richness and, well, booziness, would obviously limit this to one beer savored slowly. More than that is too much of a good thing.  As a Michigan native, I'm biased toward our beers. And few beers could live up to the hype that this one engenders. But this one certainly comes close -- it is damn good. And miles ahead of the regular Founder's Breakfast Stout.  I had possession of 2 of these (thanks ghscash for picking up a four pack and sporting me a couple). I held out for a week before drinking the first. I'm looking forward to seeing what the other one tastes like a couple years from now.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Not much complexity here, but that's not a bad thing.  Taste - Coffee, double chocolate brownie, burnt bread and a hint of vanilla. Very dry. Boozy bourbon clings to the roof of the mouth while a sharp, drying bitterness consumes the palate in the finish. This is pretty hot, boozy stuff - the alcohol doesn't hide itself much.  Mouthfeel - Dry and medium-to-full in body, certainly not the fullest imperial stout I've tried, but very rich in flavor.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,bluemoonswoon,4.47,"2009 Version: new bottle design, new glass, my Sam Adams broke earlier this fall unfortunately but replaced by the New Belgium snifter. Now that I've had a number of more massively hyped beers. I am going to keep my original rating intact because it was one of the most amazing beer experiences in my young career. Appearance suffers slightly to my jaded eyes, the head is just as dark as I remember but doesn't last as long, spread out over more surface area. Lacing not as sticky. Aroma is again incredibly good as I remember, maybe even a bit more heavy on the bourbon side that seems to mask some of the past woodiness I remember and the vanilla. Taste is phenomenal again a bit hot but still amazing, lots of bourbony heat, vanilla, oak and cocoa with the smoothest mouthfeel this side of anything. Just about lives up to the hype I remember. I would go and seek more of this stuff out because damn it's good, but I think I've had better. Abyss comes to mind, Ten Fidy holds up pretty well and one of my faves of all time GIBCS, some great shit all around.  2009 rating A: 4 S: 4.5 T: 4.5 MF: 4.5 D: 4.5  12oz bottle poured into one of those new Sam Adams glasses.  A: Pours about the deepest and thickest blacks I've ever seen in a beer, the head is darker than at least 3/4 of all the beers I've ever tried, with a thick milk chocolate colored one inch creamy head that lasts surprisingly long and leaves a decent amount of lacing considering how much alcohol is in this beer.  S: Fresh, just about the freshest ground coffee aroma I've ever come across in a beer, like walking into a tiny corner coffee shop, but along with this comes an incredibly strong dark chocolate aroma backed by a subled bourbon and vanillia that is nearly masked by the first two aromas, but is still able to be dected, for as powerful as the coffee and chocolate flavors are in this beer there is a subtle balance going on between all of these aromas the prevents this from becoming too cloyingly sweet.  T/MF: Super thick and creamy mouthfeel but also stongly bittering as well, this bitterness seems to offset the smoothness and provides an excelent counterpoint to this inital smoothness. The taste is worth the hype I think, the first thing I notice is the woodiness of the beer, slightly smoked flavor with strong coffee and chocolate undertones which give way, as the beer warms a bit in the mouth to the more boozy aspect of this beer when vanilla and bourbon highlights begin to become more of a focal point. This beer just melts in your mouth but there is just enough carbonation to lift every flavor exactly where it needs to be. The oaky wood flavors coupled with a slightly smoky chocolate and coffee all work wonderfully together with the vanilla and bourbon. The beer says it is 10% ABV but it hides it so well that you can only really detect a subtle heat the only works to keep the beer from becoming too sweet. Everything is where it should be nothing is out of place, wonderfully crafted, worth the hype and then some.  D: This beer is damn fine to drink, not a session or easy to drink but why would anyone want to pound this beer anyway. The super long finish almost makes you want to stop drinking and enjoy the lingering flavors but one sniff and you are right back there, begging for more, I am so glad I have more than one of these.  2008 Rating A: 5 S: 5 T: 5 MF: 5 D: 5",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,prototypic,4.7,"Appearance: It pours a very dark brown color (bordering on jet black). Head is a very nice looking chocolaty tan color and about a finger and half deep. Retention was good though lacing was very light.  Smell: Initially it has prominent oak and smoked aromas. Rich chocolate and roasted malt scents emerge. A twist of vanilla and coffee add more depth. Very complex aroma. Light bourbon and alcohol aromas are present though the bourbon aroma is not as strong as I expected. Very faint dark fruit and hops round it out.  Taste: Chocolate and roasted malts are indeed rich and flavorful. Very nice smoked flavor. Oak taste is strong. Bourbon flavor is light and not overly pronounced in taste. Coffee and vanilla flavors are excellent and really bring this beer to life. Very light plum flavor blends well and complements the other flavors well. Hops emerge on the tail and give it a dry, slightly bitter finish.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's thick and a bit chewy. Definitely one to savor. Carbonation is excellent. At 10%, it's strong, but still very drinkable. Though probably not advisable, I finding myself wanting more and more. Overall, this truly is a world class beer. No question the best I've had to date.

1199,19960,clickpush,3.69,"Got this one in a trade. Have to say that it didn't quite live up to the hype. Poured from a 12oz bottle to a pint glass, the beer was thick and blacker than night, looking more like a reduction than a beer. A small mocha colored head appeared briefly and then faded to nothing. Not a good start. The nose was full of oak and bourbon notes, vanilla, fruit, nuts... but no roast malt. The flavor was similar to the aroma, all vanilla and whiskey, cloyingly sweet (caramel), very little roast malt character. I understand why people like this beer - it's extreme, over the top - but I want to taste the roasted malt, the coffee, the burnt toast.

1199,19960,yourefragile,4.87,"2008 bottle poured into a snifter, probably should have saved this for 100th review if I cared about such things, but not like I could wait to try this.  A: Pours an extremely viscous, thick, black liquid. Settles in a pretty much solid black, no light passing through this. Hard pour leaves a big bubbly dark tan head that quickly dissipates to a thin film with some splotchy areas of medium sized bubbles. Leaves behind layers of rings of lacing. S: Geez, as soon as I open the bottle I'm nearly overpowered by the aroma and I love it. Similar to the breakfast stout's smell which reminded me of baskin robbins jamoca almond fudge ice cream. Milk chocolate, rich toasted malt, coffee ground, vanilla extract, all with a boozy undertone asserting the bourbon presence but by no means overpowering in that respect. Amazing blend of all of these flavors. I love just smelling this. T: Starts off with a nice sweet malt/vanilla taste that in the body blends into the roasted coffee flavors and mild chocolate background. Before you realize it happening the bourbon taste has slowly bled into the beer and takes you to the very smooth finish, slightly oak and spicy. This is very boozy, bourbony tasting without being over the top or having any sort of alcohol burn (at least for me). It's really nice how subtle the transition from the malt, coffee taste to the bourbon is. Also a slight hop bitterness throughout providing a nice amount of balance. M: Incredibly thick, creamy and smooth. Finish is pretty amazing for a such a strong, complex beer as it is clean and not very harsh. Despite having a strong bourbon/alcohol taste there is no alcohol burn in this. D: Amazing. I could keep sipping on this for a long time. ICan easily feel the effects of the alcohol but it never gets in the way of enjoying the beer.

Pouring almost pitch black with a light layer of dark brown foam, it's aroma is full of coffee, chocolate, with hints of vanilla and bourbon. The taste yields this array of flavor, with both the vanilla and bourbon having greater interplay with the dominating coffee and chocolate. Some roasted flavor is evident as well. The alcohol provides a bit of warmth, but in a very pleasant way. KBS is delicious, and very drinkable.

Plenty of coffee is rounded by rich luscious malt, along with smooth chocolate and burnt wood. Some bourbon and a very subtle bitterness come out at the finish with nice soft vanilla and oak flavors.  Feel is smooth, with nice texture and soft carbonation.  Taste is great, very satisfying.

1199,19960,jeonseh,4.69,"Poured from a bottle of the 2008 year vintage into my crystal snifter.  A - A dark chocolate brown with only a small mocha colored head that initially formed before fading away to sit slowly on the top with only a light bit of the head that sticks around on the sides throughout the beer and leaves only minimal lacing.  S - Smells initally was a very strong roasted coffee that really seemed to be the main scent that at first hit me. There are also hints of vanilla, toffee and caramel that waft up and add some sweetness to the brew. There is also a bit of bourbon spiciness that seems to be slightly there amongst the bigger roasted scents and gives you that hint of whiskey that you are expecting to taste. Super, super fragrant also as I can smell it from a ways away.  T - initially, there is a light vanilla taste that seems to dominate this brew before fading into a roasted, toasted coffee taste. There is also a bit of a bittersweet chocolate as well. However this taste does not really dominate as much as it does in the nose. The bourbon really comes through in the end as there is a nice spicy, oaky alcoholic bite that just comes in and says he this is what a year does for yah. Oh i like how the spicy, almost cinnamon notes, stick around in the after taste; it is also nice to have the sweetness in there at the beginning as it makes this one nicely balanced. As this gets warmer, the cinnamon, oaky spiciness comes out even more and becomes more like a nice bourbon. On the whole, it is a very balanced beer and it not the least bit overpowering but instead this beer's balance is what really shines through.  MF- There is really no carbonation at all and have to say that this is one super smooth brew. It is nice and creamy and just rolls over the tongue and comes in to bring the taste to you. The body feels just right and the after feeling in the mouth is a light astringent and alcoholic feeling that leaves you mouth feeling a bit tingly at the end.  D - have to say was really surprised by how drinkable this one really was. The alchy was not at all overpowering and didn't even think of this one as being too much of a sipper either. The smooth body makes it easy to get drink a lot of and the taste are pretty balanced so that you don't feel tired of it or want a change. Pretty happy I could get ahold of some of this and think it would even be better after given a little more age to it though it is already pretty mellow.

1199,19960,trumpetego,4.71,"Many thanks to Bauer Wine and Spirits in Boston for having some of this and, more importantly, letting me know about it. Poured a 12oz bottle of the 2008 version into a tulip glass. Consitency of motor oil with only a sliver of head that quickly goes away. No lacing to speak of (this is where it looses some appearance points for me). Smell is extremely complex. Starts out with coffee grounds, then some spicy alchohol, vanilla, chocolate, bourbon sweetness, and the oakiness of the barrels. Taste is a very well balanced mix of all of the above. The coffee is less present than it was in the nose, but the vanilla comes out to take it's place - big, strong vanilla almost like someone poured vanilla extract into my glass. There is a slight hint of alchohol, but this is mixed with the vanilla and oak so that it's more of a warming than anything else. The only thing I miss in the taste is the bourbon, which is a bit hard to pick out. This will probably improve with aging. Mouthfeel is good. It is certainly an imperial stout, so it has some heft but not too much. The carbonation is just present enough to provide a nice feel. Drinkability - I was tempted to have more than one of these, but I resisted. Despite the sweetness and complexity of the flavors, it didn't leave me feeling overwhelmed.

1199,19960,AKBelgianBeast,4.92,"07 bottle Thanks to markgugs for the trade.  Pours a completely pitch impenetrable black. Little tiny tan head, despite a very vigorous high pour. Smell is mostly coffee and bitter chocolate malts. Bourbon shows up more here than in the taste. Taste is coffee, burnt coffee and rich roasted malts. Some bourbon pokes through with tiny vanilla. There is a slightly creamy pinch in the early middle of the taste. bitterness is light through the middle and picks up towards the end but is relatively subtle the entire way through. Coffee defenitely dominates on the aftertaste, but the early finish has sort of a roasty hop bite. Coffee stays on the tongue for quite some time on the aftertaste. mouthfeel is thinner than I would have expected, but quite good. This adds a bit to the drinkability which is quite good. The ABV is GONE!! Nowhere to be found! The are many similarities between this and the FBS, especially the domination of the coffee flavors, but this one is noticeably different. This beer lacks the sometimes unpleasant akward sweetness found in a lot of impy stouts. The thinness is an assisst to this which I find quite pleasant. A very fine stout, and one I will surely trade for again.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,hellcatsjg,4.7,"Thanks to JJ21 for the trade!  Appearance: Dark dark black with the slightest bit of dark tan head. The small head disappears very quickly.  Smell: Oak and alcohol dominate with a good amount of coffee in the background.  Taste: The oak and alcohol are big up front. The first few sips are dominated by those two flavors. Once you get accustomed to those big flavors, the coffee starts to come out and blends very nicely with the other flavors. Very good balance between the flavors and the taste changes quite a bit as it warms. Very nice and very strong.  Mouthfeel: Good thickness and very smooth. The is almost no carbonation at all. There is a nice oak and bourbon aftertaste that hesitates for a moment after you swallow before making itself known. Very good flavor and very balanced.  Drinkability: The only thing that would hinder the drinkability of this beer is the 10% ABV. Other than that, this is a great beer and I would love to get my hands on some each time it comes available. Highly recommended.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,bbothen,4.32,"12oz bottle poured into snifter.  Pours pitch black, sludgy, chunky with rust colored head that lingers & faint sticky lacing on the glass.  Smells of bourbon obviously, along with expresso, leather, tobacco, plum, and wet wood. Delightful.  Tastes like burnt expresso & a shot of bourbon. Very warm, but not hot. Blind, I would think someone gave me chilled expresso with a shot of whiskey. I think that's a good thing.  Feels warm, smooth, & boozy. You can feel the 10% for sure.  Very drinkable for the style & ABV. Probably a good thing I don't have easy access to this.  I enjoyed this much more than the Breakfast Stout. I could have 2+ of these easy, & I can't say that about FBS. More complex and not as chocolatey. This is going to be a staple on my wants list for awhile. If you enjoy imperial stouts or barrel beers, especially stouts, you owe it to yourself to find this one. Get some if you can.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Imstillthegman,4.08,"Motor oil. Plain and simple. Thick, black, almost gooey looking. There are a couple of dark tan bubbles forming an island in the middle of the black sea. Even though there really wasn't a head, there is still some rather nice lacing ringing the glass.  The smell is of burnt cowboy coffee, woody bourbon, and some dark fruit. Slight hint of wet cardboard...uh oh. It's very slight, though, and way in the background.  The flavor is of the same strong coffee and bourbon in the aroma. Fairly strong bitterness. The bourbon flavor is there, behind the coffee, but it does not have the alcohol quality to go along with it (nice). No taste of the hint of oxidation I was smelling, thank goodness.  Mouthfeel is full and heavy. Very slick and oily. Aftertaste is a little bit bitter and the alcohol hits me in the back of my throat after swallowing. Warms the belly nicely on a cold night. I can't seem to remember who sent this one to me, but thanks!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,bgramer,3.17,"A big thanks out to ""WhoKnew"" for throwing in a bonus bottle for me!  It poured a dark black with a minimal wispy tan-colored head that quickly disappeared. Remnants of the head sticks to glass and leaves a trace as I drink it down.  As I swirl it about the carbonation rises and surprises me with more flavor hinting at coffee, chocolate fudge, something burnt/roasted, maybe some vanilla(?) until I finish it off. The flavor continues into the aftertaste which turns into a subtle hint of bourbon that's just the perfect balance.  This is very balanced and extremely smooth. The mouthfeel is very full-bodied yet light and made for an easy drinkability but it's bursting potency commands your respect hence the sippability.

1199,19960,RidiculedDisplay,4.6,"Thanks to RoyMunson for this.  Poured into an Oversized Wine Glass.  Appearance: Pours with a barely-there tan froth. Lacing is impressive - spotty and long-lasting, wtih some arms and calligraphic patterns. Body is an opaque impenetrable dark brown-black.  Smell: Whoo, this is a formidable stout. A smokey hotness dominates the aroma that is part alcohol, part chipotle peppers. General spiciness. Black pepper. ""Dustiness."" Old boot leather. Bourbon barrel wood. Slight cream. Slight brown sugar. Slight molasses. Dark and bittersweet chocolates. Turkish coffee. Undeniably complex, but not subtle.  Taste: Bourbon. Smoke. Deep espresso and turkish coffee - more coffee flavor than the nose hinted to, but reveals itself in a wonderfully nuanced and pleasant way. Mmm. The aftertaste is pure roasted coffee beans. Dark chocolate, very little sweetness. Slight vanilla. Wonderful flavors that have some of the most pronounced lastingness of any I've had in a stout. It smacks your mouth around a bit, but rewards it with a lasting, roasty aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Spicy, but coating, and full.  Drinkability: A sipper.  A fantastic stout. The roastiness and barrel wood flavors are absolutely excellent. Extremely balanced while not being overly subtle. Great.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Lupe,4.97,"Big thanks to metallitone1 for this one  Pours black as night and looks thick - not a tinge of light passing through. Creamy coffee colored head is dense, and settles down to a thin film - leaving behind traces of lace.  Wonderful aroma of bourbon, oak, vanilla, and fudge brownies. Mild charred oak and bright breakfast blend-style coffee round things out. Aroma is strong yet soft. Absolutely mouthwatering.  Flavor delivers what the aroma tells you - rich sweetness with chocolate, caramel, light coffee, and smooth bourbon. Notes of vanilla and charred oak. Finishes with alcohol warmth and lingering dry oak. Incredibly well balanced - no one flavor overwhelms, and the bourbon is super smooth and held in check.  Full bodied, super smooth, a bit chewy, and not heavy or syrupy as you would expect. Too easy to drink - should be a sipper but hard to put down, as it begs for another gulp. Desert, night-cap, or with breakfast, I'd make many excuses for having one. Truly a special beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,emerge077,4.14,"Some days, when it's only 7º outside, you need a stout of this fortitude, there's just no substitute.  Black oily pour into an Arcadia glass. Mocha tinged foam sticks around for a minute, then retreats to the edges. Served around 50-55º, don't drink this straight from the fridge, it will mute some of the smell and taste.  Special aroma of dense fudgy chocolate, and woody vanilla traces from the barrel. A little bit of ashy char is there too, though not over the top. Flavors deliver on what the nose hints at, rich chocolate, minor coffee undertone, vanilla, oak, and trace heat from the 10%. Over time it really develops and builds, a long finish connects between each flavor-packed sip. Some light bitterness that is identical to unsweetened chocolate is there, and lingers in the finish.  Incredibly smooth (oats?), not heavy or syrupy, yet it's a sipper. Thin-bodied. Perfect to sit and contemplate without weighing you down. There's a reason it's ranked so high...it's a very balanced imperial stout, possibly the most balanced i've ever had.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,dave1822,4.87,Wow! This beer is incredible. I had this beer out a bottle and poured it into a normal pint glass. The color and head were exceptional. A rich dark brown head that was the perfect size. The smell was like a cup of freshly brewed coffee with a slight campfire edge.

1199,19960,Bitterbill,4.9,"I got this bottle in a trade with hoppymeal. Thanks Derek!  It pours from 12 oz bottle a near pitch black witha finger tannish head of thick creamy foam.  The smell is very *very* nice. Tons of bourbon, chocolate, coffee, dark fruit and toffee tickle my nose buds.  The taste on first sip gives me loads of chocolate and bourbon followed immediately by coffee and some dark fruit and a nice hot cocoa bitterness. Yum!  More sips in, and that's quite easy to do as this has great drinkablity, I find more of the same but this is anything but boring. I really can't believe how darn tasty yet smooth drinking it is. As for the abv, there's just some slight warming after the swallow and the mouthfeel? Thick and chewy and absolutely superb. One of the best I've had to date.  I'm *trying* to stretch this bottle out for as long as I can but my glass keeps beckoning me to take another sip and I just don't have the will power to say no. ;^) What a drinking experience I'm having here...Founder's really set a high standard for the style when they brewed this puppy.  Btw, the foam retention is *very* good and there's lots of lacing hugging the side of my glass. Another point to mention is the aftertaste. It lingers on for a like forever and I couldn't be happier. Again, Yum!  Bottom line: A world class brew that is worth seeking out again and again.

Poured pitch black and oily from the stubby bottle and left a nice milk chocolate head behind that formed a nice ring. not much lacing, probably due to the 10%  Smell was coffee followed closely like bourbon.  Taste, well. coffee. bourbon. I know it is more complex than that, but for the sake of making it simple, it tastes like someone made me a cup of very, very strong coffee (you know, the kind you can stand a spoon in?) and then spiked it with a shot of whiskey. Plain and simple, thats what this beer it. It goes down warm like whiskey.  Mouthfeel is thick and coating. Heavy and filling.  The 10% is very warming, but i wouldn't say hot by any means. It is a sipper, but i can see how it could replace your morning cup of joe on sunday morning (or any morning you dont have to work). Although, at 10%, and so heavy, one at a time is plenty. IMO this is WAY better than FBS.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,brewandbbq,4.4,"Vintage 2006  Pours opaque black, with dark brown bubbles that struggle to overcome the viscous liquid. A inverted cascade of ulta-fine carbonation swells to a half inch with an exaggerated pour. The whipped batter lasted less than two sips and dissolved to barely a whisp on the surface. Aromatics are pungent with heavily roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, and a small dose of bourbon. The mouthfeel is thick, chewy and slightly grainy. Plenty of gription and cling-power. The pallet is laden with plenty of dry, bitter, dark chocolate, black-roasted coffee grounds, oak char, and burnt malt. Hopping is subdued, and alcohol is slightly warming. Finishes with lingering brownie batter infused with espresso, and spiked with a hint of whiskey.

Mouthfeel is a bit hot but the dry finish takes over and makes you want more. Drinkability is a bit hampered by the bourbon but this is still pretty smooth for 10% abv.

Chocolate and coffee and a bit more roast, with raisin-y/prune-y sweetness. It's just a bit... flat. All really good, but I'm pulling here, doesn't explode. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh... but I wasn't disappointed.  Taste is more of the same, FINALLY a beer where bourbon compliments and mingles but doesn't overwhelm. The coffee is still definitely predominant (how is the FBS I've got floating around in my fridge going to taste if this is how much coffee is going on here?!), malt flavors are rich and full, sweet, but a beautiful balancing dryness. Grainy, though.  As wonderful as this is... difficult to justify lengthy attempts to acquire it on a regular basis. Would love to have this around as a local brew, though.

The taste is strong of coffee with some possible raisin flavors. The mouthfeel if full and the finish is slightly oily - a bit of an alcohol burn is noticed at the end. This is an easy to drink beer. It is almost like an alcoholic coffee, but it goes down smooth.  Edit: I drank another bottle that I had gotten at the same time about a week later.

1199,19960,jmalex,4.77,"I was lucky enough to be one of the few Pennsylvanians to get to try this beer on tap at Teresa's Next Door a few months back. This, however, will be my first taste of it from the bottle. What a great first beer of 2008!  APPEARANCE: Pours into a Unibroue tulip stunningly pitch black and thicker than most any other beer I've ever laid eyes on. A dark tan head forms initially, but is quite small. It quickly drops to a small collar with a few bubbles left floating on top.  SMELL: My God. This is the most wonderfully smelling beer I've ever smelled. Coffee, chocolate, bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark fruits... everything in perfect harmony. On tap, the bourbon seemed more intense than everything else, but this... this is perfect.  TASTE: Man, that's good. Starts out with a pleasant, almost lactic, sweetness, but the huge oak, bourbon, and coffee flavors kick in soon after. The odd thing is that it finishes somewhat empty given this huge flavors that it has. The finish is mostly just a creamy sweetness that only hints at what you've just tasted. Maybe that's how it gets you to take another sip. So why a 4.5? Maybe I just expected the flavors to match the intensity in the aroma. But still, what a phenomenal beer.  MOUTHFEEL: Huge, creamy, with no slickness at all. Just everything a stout should be. Carbonation level is low and where it should be.  DRINKABILITY: Scary good. I almost find myself wishing I could taste the alcohol more. Either way, there's no way this beer should be in a 12 oz bottle. I need more.  Damn. I love Kentucky Breakfast Stout. What a fantastic kick off for 2008. Happy New Year!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Yet again, screw Founders dating system.  A: Pours jet black with average viscosity. 1 1/2 fingers struggle to form after an aggressive pour. Head is deep mocha and very tight.. looks almost nitro'd. Nice retention and an amazing sheet of lacing throughout - surprising since this is bourbon barreled.  S: Deep roasted coffee as strong as espresso. Lots of super bitter dark German chocolate and separate notes of sweet milk chocolate, but not dominating. Just a hint of pleasant whisky.  T/M: Very bitter coffee and more chocolate. A nice sweet molasses. Whisky is much more present than in the nose. This probably needs to be aged awhile. Full bodied with medium carbonation.  D: I'm glad I got some more left to age awhile. I'll try this again in a year or so. Overall, not bad at all.  2nd review: Bottle consumed 1 day after purchase at the store.... completely fresh. I complained about the bourbon being TOO strong in my past review... not so much this time. It actually seems a little mellowed. Did Founder ship an aged bottle? lol. Smell was still pleasant.

Immediately overwhelms the room with a bourbon stench, with a little bit of coffee and cocoa.  Taste is not as strong in the bourbon as the smell would have hinted. Strong roasted malts, dark chocolate and coffee hit up front, but there is the faintest bourbon sensation in the aftertaste. A very pleasant experience through each sip, and you can really appreciate it on a few different levels.  I didn't like the way it felt. Maybe too thick? I'm not really sure.

I had expected a bit more, but perhaps I was a bit timid in pouring.  Aroma first hit me with very strong roasted malts. Then notes of coffee, dark bitter cocoa (not chocolate, but pure cocoa powder) and hints of vanilla and bourbon came through. As it warmed, the alcohol became more noticeable in the nose.  Taste again was initially very strong dark roasted malts. Then coffee flavors flowed in, with a slight fruitiness. Overtones of oak and bourbon wafted around, and the finish was a long one, full of roasted barley flavors.  Mouthfeel was smooth and silky... wonderful.  Drinkability was excellent.

Chocolate and roasted malts with some cofee bean. I think I am picking up some nice licoricy notes and bourbon overtones. This beer absorbed some of the bourbon scent.  Taste is wonderfully complex. Oh man, I am lazy and this will take a long time to review! Upfront is a upfront sugar sweet swetness. This is followed by a tartness from the bourbon barrel again. A little mint and vanilla come out. This is followed by thick chocolate malts and coffee beans Roasted characteristics come out to balance. Hop bitterness is low and isn't all that distinctive. The alcohol hides itself well and this beer isn't boozy at all.  Nice creaminess and slight astringency from the alcohol. Very nice mouthfeel.  Wonderfully complex and a true breakfast stout.

Pours absolutely jet black, no light through this one, with about two fingers of super creamy dark khaki head. Recedes to a pretty thin lace but leaves quite a bit of stick on the sides.  Bourbon is the first thing to hit the nose and is a dominant aroma. It's very pungent, and it mixes with chocolate, roasted malt and espresso beans. Quite complex and pleasing.  Taste is very creamy and full of complex flavors. Bourbon and oak are dominant flavors again, especially up front, but then the complexity of the malt really comes through, with chocolate, caramel, molasses, coffee and roasted flavors. Bourbon flavor is pervasive; it's there from first taste right through the finish. As the bourbon flavor wears away I'm left with a nice roasted malt flavor that lingers longest. There's enough hop bitterness to complement the roasted malts for a nice finish and aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is super creamy, very chewy, and very full-bodied. It's also dangerously drinkable for a beer of its size, although the bourbon would start to get to me after 2 at most.  This is a pretty awesome brew. I like the aroma and flavor characteristics that the bourbon barrels impart in this beer, but they're maybe a weee bit much. This would be all 5's if the bourbon were a bit subtler rather than so dominant. But I'm completely nitpicking. This is a treat for sure.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Floydster,4.5,"12 ounce bottle acquired in a trade with citrusjim, thanks for giving me a chance to try one of the best beers I have ever had  Poured into my new Chimay goblet with a black color, almost as oil-like as Dark Lord but in my opinion better overall, slightly lighter appearance, and 1/4 inch tan head that did not settle for quite some time, left chunky dark lacing, this is another one of those beers that looks as if it is staining your glass because it so dark and sludgy  Smell was predominantly coffee and potent chocolate aromas, could also smell hints of bourbon and boozy hard alcohol flavors, smell was powerful but amazing at the same time  This was the best imperial stout I have ever had, perfect in all aspects, taste was so good that is probably not describable, consisted of vanilla, caramel, lots of sweet and dry coffee, different kinds of cocoa, whiskey, some dark fruits, molasses, a creamy espresso flavor towards the end, as this warmed it got more delicious every sip, blew away another beer I have had like it in the past, this could easily be regarded as one of the world's very best, makes a perfect dessert beer, could probably drink this when I woke up because of its sweetness and balanced hop and malt character, this one is chewy and sludgy and I would not want it any other way, one of the tastiest things I have ever put in my mouth  Thickest body you can imagine with practically no carbonation to disrupt it, great mouthfeel and a taste that lasted for several minutes at a time  Could drink this all night even though it is calorically equivalent to eating a loaf of bread most likely, even though alcohol percentage is high and it is heavy, it goes down real easy and always keeps you coming back for morw  Founders Breakfast Stout will probably be a disappointment to me now that I have tried this first, this belongs in the top five on BA, flawless beer that has so much going on, would pay twenty bucks a four pack if this was available anywhere near me, so far this is Founders best brew, I cannot recommend this one enough, great barrel aged beer that is not too hard to find, need more asap, KBS sets the standard as far as stouts go, maybe even beer in general, congratulations to Founders for brewing this masterpeice",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Overlord,4.2,"Pours a gorgeous black with small bubbles. The carbonation and head have been all over the place with multiple bottles. Some have a livelier mouthfeel, others have the mouthfeel of a cup of coffee. Thick, syrupy mouthfeel.  The smell is heavily bourbon laden with some coffee and chocolate poking through. The flavor is more balanced, but still predominantely bourbon centered. There's also some cocoa, vanilla, and even a touch of fruit in there.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Georgiabeer,4.75,"Pours black and somewhat viscous with a brown head that fades to a thin ring. The overallfeel in the mouth is that it is a smooth beer that is a little lighter than the pour would suggest. The smell is nicely integrated aromas of bourbon, cocoa, vanilla, coffee, and wood. The most noticeable trait of the aroma is how beautifully integrated everything is. The taste possesses that similar seamless integration of flavors, with an herbal bitterness up front and long bourbon and coffee flavors on the midpalate and finish followed by some more bitterness and a final hit of cocoa and vanilla. Quite a bit more finesse and a spot less power than I expected, but still magnificent. Mouthfeel is smooth, lighter than expected given the abv, and amazingly smooth and with flavors that transition easily from one to another. Very enjoyable and absolutely drinkable- no trace of heat at all.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,mikesgroove,4.88,"Well at long last here it is. The fabled and much adorned Kentucky Breakfast Stout. I was finally able to get my hands on this one, and did not waste anytime in getting my review up here. This was one mean beer, I have to say. This one hurt me, mostly because I did not know it was. Poured a very deep dark black, thick like a shake and a full two finger head of caramel brown foam at the top. Nice gradual settle down left behind some very nice side glass lace. The smell was wonderful, full of sweet caramel and lactose sugar with a rich coffee and chocolate undertone, simply to die for as for as RISs go. The taste was so complex and diverse, I did not know what I was trying, this one was nuts to say the least. Full on assault of sweet caramel and chocolate from the very start, as this mellowed some very nice coffee tones. Very full, rich, and robust profile. This was one not to take lightly. The feel was like a dessert shake. Such a warming feeling, with really no hint of alcohol at all. Overall I would have to say this definitely lived up to its hype. It was a fantastic offering and easily one of the best RIS I have ever had. It fully deserves its reputation and its rating on here. A truly top notch beer that everyone should have to try at least once, definitely and whole hearted recommendation from the BA.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,letsgopens,4.77,"I've now had this one from the bottle and on tap. Surprisingly they were not only different, but could be mistaken for a completely different beers. Both were outstanding in there own ways. For now I'll focus on the on-tap version.  Sampled repeatedly on-tap from the brewpub at Founders, this American double imperial pours a deep, unforgiving black with a mocha tan head that recedes to some spotty lace.  The aroma is intense. Some fruity, wine-like tannin qualities are present along with chocolate throughout. A bit of toastiness and some sweet black strap molasses.  A lot more mellow than the bottled version. Much less of the bourbon and smoke aspects, and a lot more decadent and sweet. Very sweet in fact with a lot of dark fruit. Sweet milk chocolate syrup and molasses; caramel, toffee, dark fruit, and a very nice warmth from the booze. Extremely sweet but so much that it takes away from the fabulous, deep complexities of this gem. Certainly something to sip and savor. A treat that I probably won't get another chance to experience for quite some time.  The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. A velvet coating on the tongue with a juicy finish. Low carbonation. Absolutely exquisite. An intense and pleasurable beer experience. Easily worth the drive to Michigan.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,SPLITGRIN,4.97,"The anticipation of trying this beer almost gives me chills. I've been waiting for this grail beer. I've sampled it but this whole bottle is mine.  A short but beautiful rich chocolate brown head creeps to barely half an inch. Body is thick as used motor oil and pours almost syrupy slow. The nose is like griding a fresh batch of high end coffee. Soft but distinct backround notes of coco and bourbon notes also exist. As you take first sip you are amazed by the smoothness of this beer. Coffee is nicely roasted and almost creamy. Bourbon feel is noticeable both on the start and finish of the palate. Very dark chocolate notes are softly presented throughout the palate. Drinks nicely as it warms to room tempature. Mouthfeel is like eating a rich truffle, it just makes you want more. Although the alchol is very well hidden it does warm the belly nicely. Drinkability would only be limited by it's availability. A lovely beer worth the hype.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,cokes,3.38,"Generally ink black, but with translucent burnt magenta edges. A cocoa powder head rises momentarily, then falls back to a narrow rimming. For a beer of this pedigree and production, the nose is weak. Sure, it has fudge, burnt coconut, vanilla nougat, and espresso, and watery bourbon. But they're turned waaaay down so as not to piss off the neighbors. Taste wise, it's a chocolaty fudge bomb, with a trace of vanilla, a dollop of molasses, a brief espresso flourish, and a lesser bourbon-barrel (aka: oak, hazelnut, and further vanilla) finish. It's thoroughly tasty, but honestly, a Snickers bar more complexity....and would taste about the same if one was to dunk a bar in bourbon and cover it in coffee grounds. The body is flaccid and actually sparse. If you're looking for a thick and beefy and coating barreled-imperial/double stout, you're in the wrong place. And this is what screws the whole thing up. There is no body, no mouthfeel, no depth, no weight, no linger, no life. This is plebeian, not imperial. It's drinkable because the flavorings are pleasant, the booze is non-apparent, and I enjoy Bourbon. It's nearest point of reference is Bailey's and coffee, but those fans will still hate it because it seems dilute. Considering the style, the source, the hype, and everything else, this is so fucking overblown it's sick. It actually one of the poorer Bourbon-barrel-aged Stouts I've come across. Fresh or aged- and I've had both, and I love Founders, especially their Breakfast and Imperial Stouts, and I love Bourbon- this simply not very good under any parameters, and incredibly (and succinctly): O...V...E...R...R...A...T...E...D.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,umustdrink,4.5,"Received today from JohnGalt1 as an extra(!) My BA 1 year birthday beer  A - Absolutely jet black used motor oil color, yielding nothing else no matter how close I held it to the light. Dark brown head, one of the darkest I've seen, fades to a patchy eighth inch. Lots of little lacing bubbles. Would have liked a bigger head but still I've never seen a blacker beer.  S - Intense chocolatey roasted malt, creamy, sweet and slightly bitter. Grainy earthy malts like oatmeal or wheat. Very creamy.  T - Starts with a chocolatey creamy taste. Light malts, not extremely toasty but smooth and grainy. Very mild bitterness, nothing like a normal stout. A brief hit of sugary chocolatey sweetness, not much else before the finish: a grainy chocolate pudding flavor with a little bit of toastiness.  M - Creamy, not very thick, and almost no carbonation, a little disappointing for me but it is what it is.  D - Overall very smooth, creamy, chocolatey, rich, luxurious etc. but honestly not enough beer-like characteristics for me to fully enjoy this. Maybe I prefer regular breakfast stout. I'd gladly drink this again though.  Very glad I got a chance to try it though. Thanks Toby.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,seaoflament,4.68,"A big thank you to Jay23 for the trade. I've had these few bottles of KBS for some time and finally decided to open one of them. 2007 bottle.  Very attractive dark color with a short mocha head. Little amount of foam is left after the pour. It pours like a big stout should.  As I was pouring this beer into the glass I could smell vanilla, very strong aromas of vanilla, dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and more chocolate and more coffee and more vanilla! Bourbon and wood aromas are well hidden in the back. Smells like liquid malted milkball candies. Some dry cocoa towards the middle of the bouquet.  Taste is very similar to the aroma. Coffee and chocolate upfront with the roasted malt flavors and a cocoa and slight hint of sweet bourbon in the finish. Some molasses as well. This could make an excellent rib glaze, but I'm not going to try that!. As it warms up a bit I also get some dark fruits and slightly fruity alcohol flavors.  Mouthfeel is of course incredibly silky and thick. A big stout but easy to drink. To be honest I think I prefer the Breakfast Stout just slightly, that one is just a tad more sweet and has more chocolate flavor than the KBS, but both are incredible beers. Hmm, actually I'm not really sure about that last statement and will have to do a side by side comparison with both beers.  **** 4/6/08  Thanks to drewbeerme for this vintage bottle. This bottle is marked 1/06.  Pours jet black with about a half inch of tan foam. A nice ring sustains for the entire time. 4-4.5  As I'm pouring I get a blast of bourbon and then followed by chocolate and vanilla. There are some coffee aromas that are still battling for dominance in this richly malted beer. As the beer settles the mocha becomes more dominant and sends the bourbon to the second layer. After a little more time the coffee aroma seems a little too astringent and reminiscent of old coffee grounds. There are still some rich, strong, Belgian chocolate aromas as well as roasted malts and some malted milk. The beer seems to have mellowed in these two years but it's still holding up pretty well; there's more chocolate and less coffee compared to a fresh bottle. Hints of vanilla peek through the chocolate as it warms up more. While the aroma is more subtle than when fresh it is still very appetizing and dessert-like. 4.5  First sip is intense with chocolate, roasted barley, toast, bourbon, and finishes with vanilla, wood, cocoa and some alcohol heat. Notes of coffee and mocha but it seems that the coffee profile is the one aspect of this beer that has faded the most. The taste continues to be mostly bitter-sweet chocolate, heavily roasted malts, and molasses. 4  Mouth-feel is quite good still. I just detect a slight watery feel as it passes down, but the smoothness is still there. Finish is not as strong either. Well carbonated. 4  Drink- 4  While it ages pretty well, at least for 2 years, I think I prefer this one fresh.  *** Update: 4/21  Thanks to hoppymeal for this great extra:  2008 edition.  Pours an intense black with a dense inch of mocha colored foam. 4.5  Rich aromas of chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, and toast. There's some milk chocolate and a combination of dark and milk chocolate along with vanilla. Chocolate malts, toasted bread and wood notes in the background. Surprisingly well blended for a young bottling of such a big beer. Coffee begins to come through as it warms up as well as cocoa. A brief whiff of alcohol in the finish. Alcohol has a stronger presence once the beer warms up. 4.5  A rush of chocolate, wood, vanilla, and chocolate covered cherries with a slightly warming sensation on the throat from the alcohol. Bitter chocolate with roasted malts in the finish and aftertaste. I'm getting some faint flavors of anise in the aftertaste as well as grain. A little more alcohol as it warms up. 4  A bit thinner than I remember but quite good. 4  Drink: It could be that I'm getting tired of barrel aged stouts but nevertheless, a pint of this beer goes down quite fast considering its abv. 4",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,younger35,4.92,"Received in a trade with tpd975. He went above and beyond on this trade and I cant thank him enough. I was planning on saving this brew for a while longer, maybe review 150 or 200, but I decided while sitting at home by myself, watching football, that today was the day. With Founders cryptic dating method Ive deduced that this beer was brewed in March (of what year is beyond me). Drank from my generic no label snifter while watching LSU (#1) vs. Kentucky (#17).  Appearance- Pours black as oil with the same consistency. Not a lot of head formed but I gave it a very gentle pour. Almost no cap but a fairly decent collar and it leaves a hell of a lot of dirty brown lacing. Smell- Wow, as advertised. Big on the vanilla right from the start. Lots of roasted coffee and cream with gentle whiffs of Kentucky. The bourbon is a lot more mellow than I would have guessed but definitely for the better. Light notes of raw cocoa and bitter bakers chocolate round out the nose. This beer actually smells just like a vanilla Starbucks. Taste- Im not sure how to even begin. This is simply the most delicious brew Ive ever tasted. I was lucky enough to have a Surly Bender last night and was blown away by how good it was. This is 10x better (I know, different styles but when somethings good, its good). Big roasted chocolate and caramel malts give a gentle sweetness to start that slowly gives way to the gentle Kentucky Bourbon. The whiskey is more than present but very subtle. Oaked vanilla and dark cherries are present along with the coffee. The espresso and vanilla are very nice but not as dominate as the nose implied. Finishes bitter with a lightly fruity aftertaste and the slightest flavor of alcohol. Considering the 10% ABV, its amazing how little you can taste. Mouthfeel- Thick and velvety with a very full, creamy feel. Carbonation is very light and absolutely perfect. Drinkability- Simply a wonderful beer. So easy to drink and silky smooth. The only thing Id like to see slightly different would be a bit more of the bourbon. I thought the Abyss had a bit more of a whisky flavor but this is definitely a tastier brew. Do whatever you can to find this beer. Itll be more than worth it. Thanks again to tpd975 for the opportunity to savor this delight!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,WesWes,4.85,"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a warm black and chocolate malt scent along with a beautiful bourban whiskey aroma. It's got a coffee-like aroma that really draws you in. The taste is perfect. This is the best tasting stout I've ever had. It has a very complex palate of flavors ranging from sweet and creamy to earthy and coffee like. The bourban barrel aging really mellows it out and greatly enhances the taste. The mouthfeel is perfect as well. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. I enjoyed this on tap at the brewery. It was the last stop on my roadtrip and was definately worth it. I wish we could get this in NY. This is the best stout I've tried.

1199,19960,sinistrsam,5,"Let me preface this by saying I've never given a 5 before in my life, and a always skeptical about so-called ""perfcet"" or ""unbelievable"" beers. That havign been said, I now, humbly admit that I understand and agree with the comments posted before; this is one of the best beers I have ever tasted. Poured a dark almost ruby-brown with a huge tan head which had excellent retention. The aroma was wonderful and complex; dark and sweet roasted malts, chocolate and hints of wood and charcoal. Vanilla and toffee round out the smell as well as a beautiful, creamy taste that is as perfectly balanced as you can get. I agree with bort about the butterscotch; something I wouldn't have picked up on but a good call. The molasses-type taste isnt overpowering and neither is the bourbon; it is smooth and sweet and just the right ammount of bitter. The feel is full-bodied and goes through several iterations of feel, from sweet to bitter and creamy. I loved this beer and despite the 10%abv, I could drink these until I ran out.

Color is a dark, dark brown, almost pure black. It only registers as slightly brown when held to the light. Smell is a fantastic blend of dark chocolate, vanilla, coffee, brown sugar, molasses, and even some butter-scotch. The bourbon comes off more as a wood smoke aroma. Taste is equal to the smell and then some. More of the bourbon is present, but it isn't very boozy like some bourbon aged beers. Still deliciously sweet. Mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy.

1199,19960,soupyman10,5,"I will start by acknowledging that I might be a touch biased with this review. After buying one of these and hiding it away for a couple months before my big going away party (joining a beerless nation for the Peace Corps), my dad threw it down, not even thinking. After racing all over the state to find another one, I finally had it, with a couple hours to spare. So basically, there was no way I was going to dislike this one. And I didn't. Pours a perfect pitch black color, with two fingers of tan head on top that slowly dissolves down to a delicious looking film. Aroma is crazy strong coffee, alcohol, spiciness, and some breadiness. Tons of roasted malt. Excellent aromas. Flavor is fantastic. Alcohol spice works in perfectly with the roasted malt on the back of the tongue. Definite but subtle bourbon flavors. Nice sweet dried fruit and brown sugar on the tip of the tongue. A nice hint of chocolate as well. As it warms, a nice zap of winey liquor at the end. Truly an incredible flavor. Body is creamy and full, with perfect carbonation. Can't say enough about this one.

1199,19960,Oxymoron,4.56,Good morning. Pours out a very dark to black color with limited brown hues around the corners. A darker tan head color with a mix of tiny bubbles and some bigger ones. Good retention through the whole tasting.  The nose is complex with malt. Noticeable chocolate and roasted malts. Some interesting low notes of premium coffee and a woody almost vanilla touch to it. Lighter notes of some fruity esters and solvent alcohol are there but not too off balance.  The taste is fantastic with a strong malt presence that is smooth with the oat silkiness. Chocolate notes are still noticeable but blend with roasted and coffee flavors. There should be an astringent quality but its hidden so well. I really enjoy how malts blend well with the silky touches from the oats. Some lighter grassy and earthy finishes leaves a off balance flavor.  The body is the star of this beer. A smooth silky finish and really makes this beer cloying to drink. A full body for sure but very deceptive in the ease of drinking. A great beer for sure.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Even on a very hard pour only a thin dark brown cap appeared, then fell quickly to a skim of fine bubbles and a thin ring. The beer itself was black, but with the thinnest of mahogany edges when held up in bright light. Some spotty lace clung to the glass between sips. Assertive roasted coffee aroma, some grounds, toffee and caramel, with wood character in the background. Thick and sweet pretty much sums up the first sip. There was a lot of coffee and roast flavour, but also equal parts dark and milk chocolate along with rich caramel. Oak played a role in the middle, growing into a whiskey barrel, alcoholic finish. Still, it stayed quite mellow for all the powerful flavours. Lots of alcohol warmth, low carbonation and a full, heavy body. Quite viscous and palate coating. Great stuff!

A lot of sweet bourbon notes up front and then finishes with a dry coffee taste that it leaves in your mouth. Alcohol was not very notable to me. This was my first 5 of 5 after 60 beers reviewed.

It does remind me of the breakfast stout with some more chocolate, and a little bourbon and wood added to it. Light bitterness on the tip of tongue from grass hops along with some warmth from alcohol.. It is complex but I think this beer is over rated.

The head is a creamy, dirty tan collar and a little bit of film. This revitalizes to a creamy cinnamon when swirled.  Smells of campfire roasted marshmallows, vanilla taffy all atop the roasted coffee and green sapling twigs of the Breakfast Stout. This is just amazing, delicious and decadent.  Tastes of green sappy wood oozing with vanilla beans that backs off to reveal an underbelly of espresso beans and bourbon. The finish is a powerful, but smooth well blended coffee.  Feels easy but dense with a tiny carbonation that froths it up ever so slightly.  A magnificent beer and a perfect after dinner sipper.

It was a little thick, but as expected for the style.  D- This one is a little overpowering to be considered really drinkable.  Overall- While I can't say this is a bad beer, I think I went into drinking it with some really high expectations. I found the whiskey flavor to be a bit too broad for my taste. It just ended up being a little too sweet (lots of vanilla tones). My lower drinkability score didn't come from the high alcohol, I knew what to expect there. It was more of the overly sweet tones.  I'm looking forward to giving the regular breakfast stout a try in the near future.

A: Jet black body with no head. Even when held to the candle at the table, no light penetrated.  S: The smells emanating from the glass were very strong and delicious. Right up front was a ton of chocolate followed by coffee, dark fruits (dates?), some smokiness and a bit of maple syrup. All in all, it kind of smelled like a burnt mocha, but in a good way if that's possible.  T: The taste is just like the aroma, very chocolaty with coffee and some burnt sugar flavors. The smoothness and creaminess are incredible for a beer of 10% alcohol. This is definitely one of my favorite beers, although I am partial to double stouts.  M: As I said before, the creaminess and smoothness are amazing although the beer is lighter in body than it would seem.

It is very rich, hearty and delicious, but it really is more of a sipper than a session beer, and the high abv also limits sessionbility.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Pours oily thick like motor oil, pitch black and 100% opaque. A very aggressive pour led to a half inch of frothy dark tan head, doesn't leave lacing.  Immediate hit of sweet aroma along with vanilla, coffee and chocolate.  Complex flavor mix of alcohol, chocolate, hops. Coffee and vanilla are very subtle.  Creamy smooth mouthfeel with notable bourbon in the finish. Not as heavy as the thick pour suggested.

1199,19960,ghostwalker,4.62,"Midnight black body with a creamy thick tan head that falls off quickly. Beautiful!  Bourbon nose is noticeable from the cracking of the bottle. Deep dark chocolate scents. Bourbon seems to fall off quickly, but a deep booze note persists. Incredibly complex and rich.  Velvety smooth, less chocolate than the regular, generally more balanced. Bourbon flavor is present, but does not dominate. No real coffee presence, this is noticeably different than the Breakfast Stout. Dark fruitiness present as well. Tasty and intense.  Mouthfeel is liquid velvet, coats the entire palate in sweetness.  Drinkability is very good for the ABV. A sipper for sure, but every sip is a delight.

1199,19960,waughbrew,4.44,"[thanks to JonD for the bottle]  Black with brown cap which stays as a small fuzz and pretty light lace. Aroma is huge coffee with some vodka and vanilla, overall very strong and wonderful. Flavor is again coffee, alcohol, and vanilla. It doesn't develop as much as I would like, but what it is is nice. Really like liquid dessert, reminds me a bit of tiramisu. Smooth as silk. Thankfully the bourbon notes are not over-the-top and actually complement the malt and hop flavors.  Very well done. From the name of this, I did not expect to enjoy it, but it must be a blend and not 100% from the wood. I wouldn't mind having one of these every so often as a nightcap.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,bradford,3.81,"Huge thanks to davide169 for finally helping me track down a bottle of the much acclaimed Kentucky Breakfast stout. One of the darkest black beers I have ever seen. The only one that compares off the top of my head is Dark Lord. Smelled very good. Lots of roasted barley, chocolate, coffee, and bourbon. Taste left a little to be desired. I felt like it didn't quite live up to the hype for me. Mouthfeel seemed a bit thin to me. Perhaps the legend got the best o me and I expected something that was just impossible to live up to. This is a good beer, and I wish I had more. As far as stouts go, this is one of the better ones out there, but I think I was just expecting too much from this one to possibly deliver.

1199,19960,marksto,4.07,"A surprise micro-keg was unveiled at the Indiana Brewer's Guild festival this year - near pandemonium ensued when it was tapped and it lasted all of about 10 minutes.. Thanks to Dave and Founders for making it available.  Pours opaque, jet black, and with a small head with light cocoa-coloring to what is there. Has big oak, coffee, roast, even a little smoke in the nose. Flavor dominates with coffeeish roastiness followed with a little oak and a slight bourbon essence. The bourbon is surprisingly light - just a slight essence. Body and mouthfeel actually seemed kind of light for the style, more in tune with that of a regular stout than an american double.  Overall, a very nice beer but for me not quite worthy of the major status acclaimed here. Perhaps it would be different from the bottle, Maybe I'll get a chance to see sometime, In the meantime glad to have had the opportunity today.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smell: Dark Chocolate is the most predominate aroma along with coffee, caramel, and vanilla.  Taste: Starts with the flavor of dark chocolate and somewhat bitter coffee. There is a alchol flavor in the middle that is replaced with bourbon and vanilla. End with a great roasted malt flavor.  Mouthfeel: Full and smooth mouthfeel. Very appropriate for this beer.

1199,19960,BuckeyeNation,4.63,"Complete... utter... total... Stygian black. Despite a big blast of July sunshine behind the glass, there's no hint of lightening at the edges. I think I said the same about Founders Imperial Stout, but I don't know that I've ever seen a darker dollop of foam. The head is 'coffee with a small splash of cream' brown and is incredibly thick and rich. There's even a huge amount of lace for such a high-ABV ale.  Every ingredient that's said to be present is easily noted in the nose. I'm a little disappointed that coffee is in the foreground and bourbon is in the background. I wanted 'Kentucky' to be emphasized more than 'Breakfast'. That said, this is still an incredible aroma. It smells like a prodigious amount of roasted and black malt has been used, complemented nicely by espresso, vanilla and bourbon whiskey.  Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout is delicous beer. My first few mouthfuls tell me that it doesn't live up to my (probably unrealistic) expectations, but that's the last time in this review that I'll be anything other than positive. I know one thing, I'll buy every bottle that I can get my hands on each and every year.  The flavor profile consists of a monolithic maltiness that is Stonehenge-like in size. Think dark chocolate fudge cake flecked with pulverized coffee beans and swimming in dark caramel and molasses sauce. Of the accessory flavors, vanilla is the most prominent, followed by a burnt sugar, bourbon barrel character that, again, should be more up front. As a bourbon whiskey lover, I wish my favorite liquor saturated every sip.  The most amazing thing about KBS is how completely the alcohol is buried. Other than the beginnings of tongue numbing as I reach the halfway point of the bottle, I have a hard time picking it out. Maybe that because it tastes like bourbon rather than like ethanol. In any case, there's no need to age this beer since there's no alcoholic heat whatsoever. Of course, I'm drinking it almost four months after its release.  I'm tempted to bump the flavor score as the beer warms, but can't quite do it. For all the reasons stated above, I can imagine a better KBS, so this one will have to settle for a less than perfect flavor score. The mouthfeel is luxurious. It's medium-full with a heavy silkiness that promotes gulping rather than sipping. I could get into trouble in a big hurry with this beer.  I don't believe there's a brewery in existence that can match Founders when it comes to big stouts. Breakfast Stout, Imperial Stout, and now Kentucky Breakfast Stout are three of the most incredible beers that I've ever had the pleasure to drink. Never has twelve ounces seemed so much like six. Good thing I have three more bottles to go.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Aroma is big malty coffee nice and smokey with vanilla some oaky wood noted and light bourbon notes as well. Was thinking bourbon would be stronger but its not.  Taste is woo dude big rick malts loaded with coffee, no surprise there, rich caramel or more molasses like. Nice vanilla noted with alcohol and bourbon flavors mixing it up with a lingering coffee presence. Finish as a sharp dry like woody oak flavor that seems to round everything out. This is one big stout like the bourbon flavors but for everyday would prefer the plain Breakfast Stout.  Mouthfeel is fullish but not as big as it looks. Has a light carbonation level as its not dead seems just the right amount for this brew. Feels like a big mocha with some bourbon thrown in.

Tons of lacing is left around the glass. Smell is of coffee grounds, cocoa, fresh espresso beans, roasted nuts, creamy vanilla. Taste is of the mentioned aromas with a huge nod to ground coffee and not enough of the oak, or bourbon going on as anticipated. Mouthfeel is medium/full bodied, rich, huge coffee, sweet, creamy, with a grainy, biscuity feel in the swallow. Personally, I enjoyed the regular Breakfast Stout more. Maybe it was the bottle? I've heard these have differed. --- Edit - 5/4/09 I finally got this on tap at Capone's. Man, this was much better than what I remember it being in the bottle.

Got A 2'' mocha head from a hard pour had decent retention left a thick creamy layer that just would not die.Some beautiful lace curtians decorating the glass on the way down. Just a smigen shy of a 5 on the head  The aroma one word ""Heavenly"" complex to say the least. A strong charred wood smell,bakers chocolate the chocolate aroma reminded me of the ride through the Hershey factory.Very roasty,cappachino,sweet sents of chocolate throughtout. Very earthy,woody a toasty/toffee with a candied carmell and a hint of some vanallia creamer added.  Intense roastyness/bitter chocolate with strong charred/burnt wood tastes. Has a flash of alcohol in the mid taste with a note of vanallia. Great balance with a sharp,crisp,dry/puckering feel get right to the point. Very earthy feel with overtones of burbon throughout. The taste is simply out of this world.  The mouthfeel is extremely light and creamy, ""nitro-like"" with some some slight cloying this beer just seems to melt away in your mouth. The most drinkable 10% stout you will find went down so smooth and easy really wishing I had more.

1199,19960,Metalmonk,4.33,"Careful to let it warm accordingly, it poured into a snifter a glistening oily black, already beautiful, and with that toasted brown head (no tan about it, it's totally brown!)...well, this is an amazing looking beer. Not much head, but that would be expected, considering the style and ABV. If you can see even the smallest bit of light through the blackness, you're inhuman.  Aroma is deep dark chocolate, burnt marshmallows, bourbon, bonfire/smoke/wood...maybe just a little too heavy on the bourbon and the smoke/char, but still quite a nice aroma.  Flavor sticks around in the mouth a long, long time. I took one small, slow sip and it felt like I'd be tasting it throughout the entire evening, on just that one sip. Features a whiskey-like burn, but balanced very well by strong coffee, bitter dark chocolate, charred wood, and a deep, heavy graininess that I can't quote put my finger (tastebuds) on.  That great aftertaste/finish is enhanced by a creamy smooth mouthfeel, less heavy than you might expect, but very present with ample carbonation (ie. on the low side, perfect for the style). The stickiness was perfect for the flavors and not overbearing; probably a large reason why the flavor rides with you for so long.  What to follow this with? How about nothing. This is a slow mover, one that opens up new things every sip. Glad to have finally tried this heavily hyped cult classic. I prefer the regular Founders B'fast stout, I think it's more drinkable overall, but what's not to love here? Thanks once again to the man, aka msubulldog25, aka Brian.

I seem to get an alcohol smell, but it's probably just my association with the bourbon. Rich, super dark malts followed by a distinct hoppiness.  Taste is superb. Huge malt backbone with a big woody bourbon kick right in the middle. Flavors of oak, dark fruits, anise, and vanilla precede a surprising grassy hop balance. The aftertaste is smooth and oaky, with just a hint of booze.  Mouthfeel is fantastic. Ultra-think and super-smooth, it really conveys the bourbon flavor and oak-aged character.  Drinkability is surprisingly good, very strong flavors but all in a masterfully delicate balance.  Overall, one hell of a beer.

S- This beer has a big oak and bourbon note with coffee and black roasted malt in the background.  T- This beer has a big wet oak flavor that starts off followed by a flavor of black roasted malt and some chocolate malt with a vinous finish with notes of bourbon.  M- This beer has a light mouthfeel with an alcohol heat that cleans the finish nicely.  D- This beer is big on wood and bourbon and those flavors increase as the beer warms.

I sat and sniffed it so long I had to actually tell myself, enough drink the damn thing already.  T: Oh my god and baby Jesus, this is it! WOW! This baby is quite possibly the best tasting beverage to ever pass my lips and cross my tongue. A perfect match of coffee. bourbon, cocoa, and vanilla.

Gotta admit that I'm just not a fan of the bourbon/oak barrel aging of beers. Keep trying em hoping that I'll grow into it but I guess I want my beer to taste like beer and not whiskey.

Woke up around 11:00 oclock to day (I dont work until around 4) cracked this immediately after a shower around 11:45 and damn am I happy. Chilled and poured into my Three Floyds nonic, head rose a good inch and a half and lingers now a couple centimeters above the surface. A dark milk chocolate color leaving wonderful foamy lacing like a wave washing on the walls of my glass. The body is as black as black can be like brand new polished black leather. The nose is fabulous tons of dry roast kona coffee, hints of vanilla from oak, rich dark chocolate and a subtle saltiness. I can only smell a small suggestion of bourbon aroma, which is perfect. To me most bourbon aged beers have good aromas, but are a tad too cloying or harsh, however this is so well done it makes me sick. I get no real hop aroma in comparison to the big bold, dare I saw magically malt/ dry roast coffee aromas. Alcohol is not really present in the aroma, it is amazing how well it is hidden. The flavor is equally amazing perfectly well balanced, just enough bitterness to support the superior malt complexities. I can taste coffee, bitter chocolate and hints of vanilla with a great Kona backend. Even after I swallow I can still smell it almost as if it is seeping out. Mouthfeel is not as thick as I thought it was going to be for strength which makes this even better. I feel like their mash temps matched with other proceeders / ingredients are so well chosen and performed, its like magic, great work, I am so blown away.

Coffee, a sweet oak scent, which I'll assume is the vanilla, and toffee and dark raisins fill up my nose  Taste, much smoother than the nose would indicate, big coffee and oak flavors up front, alcohol and bourbon flavors follow. Little bitterness, the bourbon notes take care of that. Vanilla flavors mesh well with the oak, makes this one very smooth and complex.  Overall, not worth the $19 a 4pk I paid at the brewery to drink every day. But don't get me wrong, this stout is very complex, and worth seeking out. Hands down one of the most complex stouts I have every had, and believe me, that is saying something.

1199,19960,Talisker,4.42,"Certainly a must-try beer. The hype is warranted enough for you to get your hands on at least one bottle try for yourself.  I'll skip the usual breakdown in this review, and just say that in general I'm not a fan of barrel-aged beers, especially bourbon barrels. Most brewers overdo it the moment a barrel is involved. And I love bourbon on its own.  But in the case of KBS, bourbon is a beautiful complement to the very rich vanilla and coffee. It definitely works, and isn't even as syrupy as you might expect.  I prefer the Founders Breakfast Stout to the Kentucky Breakfast, but I love both.

It's quite a pungent beer, I noticed the aroma right when I opened the bottle.  Flavors are dominated by bourbon. Very boozy and alcohol flavored. There are subtle hints of coffee, cocoa, and oak. Beer is big flavored, but still quite smooth. Very interesting flavors here.  Mouthfeel seems to lack a bit on this one.

1199,19960,benito,3.76,"Getting ahold of this was a coup. To make a long story short, my mom wheedled the last bottle out of Holiday Market for me. Wow.  A: Absolutely opaque with a thin-though-everlasting head, which is a deep, coffeeish tan in color.  S: Coffee dominates and overpowers most everything else. In some ways, it's a pleasant aroma, yet it is ultimately so much less than it could be.  T: Though coffee dominates here too, it's not in any way overpowering. There's a rich vanila flavor that hits midway through the tongue, and it finishes with a dry and very bitter aftertaste. You can remark a distinct alcohol tinge throughout, also.  M and D: Syrupy and heavy (as one would expect), with an admirable complexity that develops more and more with each sip. The range of flavors across the tongue is remarkable: coffee, vanilla, alcohol, tar, tobacco, leather, cocoa, and brown sugar.  Overall, this is a fine, if not awe-inspiring, brew. I might have liked a little more bourbon flavor and presence, but that's a secondary concern. I would happily pay another $6 for another 12 ounce sample of Kentucky Breakfast.  Drink it, if you can find it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Damian,4.27,"Drank from a 12 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Liquor World, Cambridge, MA  I saved this special treat for review #200. Poured a super thick and viscous pitch black. I have compared other beers' appearances to motor oil but this one much better suits that description than the rest. There was no head on the beer but rather a small amount of coffee-colored, bubbly frothiness. Tiny streaks of lacing clung to the sides of the glass.  The aroma was outrageously rich and beautifully aromatic. (I felt that only giving this beer a ""5"" for smell was doing it a disservice.) As soon as the beer was poured, sweet-smelling, freshly roasted coffee beans smacked me in the face. (The only other beer that had such an intense coffee aroma was Founder's Breakfast Stout.) Fragrant notes of molasses, brown sugar, vanilla and a distinct oakiness rounded out the nose.  The taste was rich and flavorful but not as smooth as the aroma. Deep roasted malts and coffee were apparent up front. The coffee flavor continued along the palate, taking on an almost Bailey's-esque flavor at times. Oaky, woody notes and maple syrup emerged mid-palate. The initial pleasant alcohol warming on the back end turned a bit hot by the drink's end. The finish was bourbon-like, hoppy (a somewhat minty and tingly hop flavor) and dry and it became progressively stronger as the beer warmed. By mid-bottle, the hoppiness emerged considerably and was noticeable from start to finish. The never ending aftertaste was reminiscent of freshly brewed coffee.  Mouthfeel was extremely full-bodied (this may have been the thickest beer I have ever drank), viscous, creamy and rich. It truly felt like a blanket on my tongue.  As for drinkability, this beer was a mixed bag. I enjoyed the initial flavors immensely, but found that both the hops and the alcohol became a bit overwhelming as the beer warmed. The effect of the 10% ABV definitely hit me hard.  Overall, this was a terrificly complex, flavorful, rich and unique beer. At $20 for a four-pack this stuff is pricey, but I am glad I had the opportunity to try it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,the_beerist,4.87,"Grabbed this four pack at Blanchards in Allston. Been looking forward to trying for a long long while. Pours black as night with a golden brown head that quickly fades into the darkness of this beer. Smells of baking chocolate and vanilla rising upward.  First taste is of vanilla giving way to a dry chocolate and hickory barrel before the alcohol hits. Amazingly complex beer. Ends with a bourbony finsh that hangs around in the back of the throat till the next sip. This is a great beer Founders had brewed up. Gonna cellar this for a year to see if the alcohol notes (10%) settle down a bit. One of the best, most unique beers I've had to date.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,jamie2dope,4.72,"Picked this beer up from A-Wines in Inman Square. Lets see how it is compared to the regular Breakfast Stout. Not a shred of light was getting through the blackness of this brew. A small tan head also gave way to a brown lace. In the aroma were traces of smooth chocolate, coffee beans, whiskey, and some earth tones. Taste started off slightly acidic, then turned to burnt coffee and roasty bitterness. All the while there is a big background of fudgy chocolate.Mouthfeel, needless to say, is quite big, although the alcohol is not all that pronounced. This is an incredibly smooth brew; very silky, and big on flavor. At this point in the review, I have been drinking this one too fast, I will definitely be slowing down to let more of the complexities of this beer pull through. Although this beer was really expensive, it is so worth it. Definitely liked this one more than the normal Breakfast Stout. Founders continues to amaze me. This goes in as one of the best beers I have yet to sample. Cheers",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ncvbc,4.4,"This one and the regular BS are pretty equal in my mind. Poured a pitch black with brown/tan head with about a half inch thickness. Smells better than any beer I've put my nose to or at least right with it. Vanilla, bourbon, coffee, hint of chocolate, too much going on here. Taste is just as complex and excellent as the smell. Basically everything I picked up a scent of came through in the flavor here. Tamed bourbon, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, even some dark cherries or some sort of fruit. Alcohol seems to come out a little more as it warms but for the first time I like it! Mouthfeel attempts fullness at first but quickly drops off and seems to absorb on the tongue. Actually, this is pretty much full. It coats my tongue with its greatness and stays there for what feels like an eternity. Overall a damn drinkable brew...not quite as much as the regular BS, regardless of ABV.

1199,19960,Truh,4.45,"Spun a few yarns with some good ole boys with this one on 5/27/2007. 12-oz. bottle poured in a shaker glass.  Very thin camisol of threaded beading hides the core of the pour with a truly nice red-brown hue to the striations. Plentiful, spiderpig webbing of lace throughout. On the nose, mahogany, linseed oil, coca cola, French roast coffee, and chocolate caramel all mix together for a powerful karate chop to the olfactory senses. Enormous coffee jackhammer on the tongue, with a cherry infused chocolate trifle boring like sugary good acid through the tonsils, a smoky applewood trickling down the throat, suffusing every part above the neck in a sea of sublime super stout. Medium-heavy body, very silky.  Wish I had a few more of these; truly excellent.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Erdinger2003,3.8,"2007 vintage.  Pours out black and very thick. The head finally came up after I finished pouring. It grew to about 1/2 inch and then fell into a thin layer on top and almost went away completely. Lacing is strong and very nice. Smell is a slight bourbon with chocolate tones and a light cappacino backround. Taste is bourbon with roastiness and a little aftertaste of chocolate tones. A little warm on the tongue with a harsh carbonation on the palate. Very peppery in the finish and on my palate. Overall, I will let this baby age a little more before opening a new one. I don't even taste any vanilla which I got a nice flavor of from a small sample from MABZ last year.

1199,19960,Mebuzzard,4.37,"Received bottles from grub and Unclejedi...drank one of them, saving the other. This has a tremendous reputation, so I'll try to remain calm. Pours black, silky, some dark burgundy/ruby hints. Head comes to about a 1/2 finger. Medium brown. I think I served it a bit cold, we'll see how it holds up. Wow, the smell is rich coffee grounds, roasted coffee beans, some prune and anise. Chocolate seems to linger, but not a lot. Alcohol? I don't detect it. Man, this coffee is strong. Taste is fantastic. Starts as expected with the coffee. A slight intensity is followed by a move toward more caramel and whisky, hint of alcohol. Then it moves to a slight bite of anise and hops, earth tones. Then it moves on to the chocolate. A rich dark chocolate aftertaste, clean and silky. Which leads me to the feel. Silk, not really heavy, not velvet. A smoothness to it. Real nice. Drinks very well for the style, abv, and for me. What a brew!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,peabody,4.82,"Pours out black as night with dark tan suds and spotty lacing around the pint glass. This is black, as black as any beer I have tried. Burnt coffee and dark chocolate malt and a yeast that burns the nose. A hint of the bourbon is in the back with the sugars. Taste is mellow and fruity and sweet. I taste wood here. There is grape and black cherry with the coffee and chocolate. This is unlike anything I have ever tried. Just fantastic. You can not tell that there is any alcohol here. Masked quiet well. Mouthfeel is very mellow/mild. While there is coffee here there is no bitterness in the aftertaste. The flavor dies out quietly and quickly making the palate ready for the next drink. Too bad I can't get this on a regular basis. They need to make more. Just fantastic. Like no other.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,tempest,4.5,"Wow, I've never had a beer quite like this before. It was pitch black, of course, with a short brown head. The aroma and flavor, to me, were dominated, but wonderfully so, by the coffee. The coffee blended right into the chocolate and roasted malt flavors, which gave way to the whisky. Still, there was a bland spot in the flavor profile just before the bourbon, and because of that, I can't give it a 5 for taste. I found it surprisingly drinkable and hope to find this again sometime.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,malcontent,4.97,"Little to no head although it's a style that doesn't demand it. Lacing is present and the tan bubbles betray only the slightest light shining through the edges of an otherwise ominous black body.  The beauty of this bourbon-barrel bon-bon is that the nose isn't dominated by said spirit. Vanilla, charcoal, chocolate and of course, coffee all waft tantalizingly upward to greet me. I haven't waxed poetic in a review for a while but I haven't had reason to for a while either. This is a great start.  I can't even comment on taste yet because the first thing that strikes me is that this is flat-out the smoothest 10% ABV brew I've ever had. Creamy coffee laced with the gorgeous vanilla notes from the wood. Honey and smoke disappear as quickly as they arrived but aren't gone from my memory. All the flavors come back to the central theme of coffee and finish with a nutty toffee flavor. This is a superlative beer whose flavors work in congress with one another as well as I've ever experienced.  Mouthfeel is luxuriously creamy without ever hinting at syrupy. I don't care that it's a 10%er because I can't taste it and, so far, I can't feel it. This is deadly drinkable and might be my favorite beer to date.

1199,19960,rayjay,3.88,"Thank you, BeerBeing, for sending this one out to me. I love the spiel on the bottle! Poured into a Belgian goblet at 50° F.  Very deep colored stout; it only lets in a tiny bit of light. The smallest little brown head tries desperately to cling onto the sides of the glass. Medium-low carbonation.  Tons of roasted coffee beans and vanilla in the nose. Tons. It's actually difficult to detect any beer in there. Touching the beer leaves a definitive ""old cup of coffee"" smell on your skin. Only as the beer warms does the whiskey come out; sweet bourbon whiskey, almost like a Beam and coke.  On to the taste: lots of bitter coffee. A huge amount of flavors, making them difficult to pick out individually. The coffee beans are by far the most prevalant flavor. It's one big thick beer, although the viscosity is totally under control. The vanilla definately adds another bitter element to the mix; as it warms the notes become more like the vanilla notes in bourbon. There is some alcohol in the finish, and there are higher alcohols present. I detect subtle amounts of noble hops, and lots of black malt, but the beer seems to be the backup band here, and the lead singers are the coffee and whiskey. Probably some roasted barley.  The mouthfeel is very smooth. It is not very carbonated, and the barrel aging gives it a great ""polished"" vibe, smoothing out any harsh tones. The beer isn't overly sweet or sticky, although it certainly is evident that lots of sugars are in it.  Eat your heart out, Starbucks. A very good stout, but I don't believe it deserves quite the high rating on this site. Recommended, though. Cheers!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Nothing but black with this beast that tops off with a bubbly brown head that dies down soon after pour. Swirling leaves spotted lacing and minimal stickiness. Bubbles move so slow, almost like traveling through molasses. Moving on to the smell, so complex, I can't stop putting my nose up to this one. Fresh brewed coffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, dark chocolate, toffee, caramel...everything you can ask for! Honsetly, I hardly smell alcohol at all. I could smell this baby all day long, but my tounge needs to appreciate this one for sure...moving on...starts with a delicious fresh black coffee taste that goes down as a smooth sweet oaky vanilla. The bourbon definitely appears more as it warms up, but I'm lovin' it. So many complex malty flavors of toasted coffee/chocolate/coffee/molasses/coffee/nuts. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light to medium because of the more than expected carbonation. So smooth, so delicious, so true. Drinkability is scary good. Almost makes me wonder if this is alcoholic at all. Gimme more! Luckily I received a second one :) but that one will have to wait.

Malty goodness of dark fruit  plums and raisons in the aroma, chocolate and deep roasted coffee. Thick and chewy as you quaff, the bourbon is there but not overwhelming in the least.

Mouthfeel is medium/full, and it's creamy, smooth and oily. The low carbonation makes the drinkability of this beer excellent.

No much lacing to speak of.  Smell: The aromas are very complex. This has a combination of milk chocolate and a bitter dark chocolate. The vanilla is exploding throughout this dark enigma. The wood from the barrell is very strong as well. Perhaps some cedar notes? Wierd, i'm getting some celery too. The alcohol is definitely strong due to vapors that are almost burning the nostrils.  Taste: Chocolates galores. Bittering cocoa film all throughout my palate. A premium blend of the worlds finest coffee grounds seem to be ground up within. The vanilla is a bit overpowering for me, but then again it is well balanced for a monsterous chocolate thunder of a beer. The alcohol doesnot seem to have the same punch that I was getting in the aroma, but believe me it is present. In the words of Borat,"" Very niiicce!""  Mouthfeel: Not as thick as I had anticipated, but I would say it has a lighter side of thick body with a low to medium amount of carbonation. Alcoholic vapors musters all throughout the session.

1199,19960,taez555,4.1,"This beer pours a pitch black with a mild gray and reddish/purple hued, motor oil thick body with a very small off-white head that died almost immediately.  Nose is an intense grainy rich milk chocolate with a boot leather type wooden bourbon barrel smell. Hints of espresso beans, vanilla beans, chalk, dark chocolate, very faint hints of smoke and mild alcohol. It's a very compact nose with subtle smells that shine through more as it warms.  Taste is very full bodied and almost syrupy thick. Strong woody alcohol rich bourbon flavors dominate and mix with a rich espresso and chocolate flavor. There's a graininess throughout as well as a strong burnt malt bitterness that's mixed with a dominate hop bitterness. Vanilla notes are mixed with a chocolate and bourbon, but since vanilla is such a key characteristic in these to begin with it's a bit overshadowed. Mild chalk touches and some strong charcoal notes.. There really isn't much in the way of hop flavor albeit a few brief citrus notes, but honestly it's hard to tell if it's hops or the dark malt and bourbon flavors you're mis-tasting.  A good beer, but still not my favorite from Founders.

There is a bit of foam around the edges and not much lacing.  Smell is an elegant blend of vanilla, coffee, and alcohol. The best way I can describe it is to say that it smells like Kahlua. Someone should make a scented candle out of this.  Taste is like nothing I've ever experienced. I'm hit with coffee, sweet carmel, and a strong roasted flavor. The alcohol is noticeable but not unwelcome. As this beer warms the flavor of bourbon from the barrel becomes more evident.  Mouthfeel is extremely full and creamy. The alcohol is apparent again and leaves a clean lingering feeling in the mouth. It warms the throat as it goes down. I'd love to have this on a cold winter night.

Coffee, and more coffee, drowning most of the other tastes in there, that include molasses, caramel and bourbon, but those unfortunately, just occasionally reach your palate given the excesssive coffee.

Maybe at the bottom of my glass I can get a hint of red, but not really. The head is thin and flimsy, but it does stay there and it leaves a nice lace as I drink this malt beverage.  It smells like fresh ground coffee with a nice amount of vanilla present. A little bit of the oaky bourbon shows though. It smells like a very nice coffee.  The taste is quite pleasant. The coffee and bourbon play together with the vanilla supporting both and a nice sugary-sweet backbone.  The mouthfeel is a little flat and slick. Coffee with a dash of motor oil.

Smell: Licorice, smoke, roasted malts, woodchips (barrel?), coffee and chocolate dance around the nose.  Taste: Woody and smoky for sure. What's quite interesting is that there's really no notion of alcohol in this at all. It's tremendously well hidden, allowing a lot of the beauty to shine. Roasted malts and coffee round out the palate.  Mouthfeel: Thinner than expected, but that only serves to enhance the drinkability (see below). Low carbonation - I like that in a stout. Slightly sticky.  Drinkability: Holy crow - I could drink this all night. It's got such a complex aroma and flavor profile. I just can't get bored drinking this.

Below the list is where Founders says ""is good for everything a stout ought to be good for."" We'll see about that! To the left of the main label is the Government warning and on the other side is where they keep barcode, refund prices, and web address. Founders dates their bottles with a small notch on the top or bottom of the label. Mine is notched on the top and toward the left. I know it means something, but I'm not too sure right now. Served in a small Great Lakes Christmas Ale Snifter.  Appearance: I don't think the word ""black"" is good enough to describe the color of this beer. If black could get any more blacker, then that would do the job on describing the color of this beer. Motor oil would be good, but only if the motor oil was mixed in with the blackest ink you could find. No light can penetrate the blackness of this beer. No joke, that's how black this beer is. The color was real nice, but the height of the head of foam wasn't so good. It had a quarter of an inch dark tan/mocha colored head of a foam that had OK retention that left behind a small tan film, mocha rings along the edge of the beer, and a small spatter of tan colored spots that acted as the lace. It could have a little better.  Smell: When I first twisted the cap off, this big whiff of dark roasted coffee beans and roasted malt came pouring out of the bottle and into my nose. When poured, the aroma was still strong and dark with roasted coffee beans, roasted bitter dark chocolate, dark roasted malts, dark fruits soaked in alcohol, a pinch of charred oak, a drop of bourbon, and a few roasted hop buds to send this aroma off into the taste. Hope you like the smell because you're going to taste all of those flavors.  Taste: The taste was almost exactly like the aroma, dark and heavy with tons of dark roasted flavors. If you like all those flavors you smelled, then you'll be excited to taste all of them here. That means you'll be able to taste the roasted coffee beans, roasted bitter dark chocolate, dark roasted malt, a drop of bourbon, dark fruits drench in alcohol, charred oak, and roasted hops. Like I said before, the taste was almost like the smell, except that in the taste the roasted hops are a tab bit stronger and the alcohol was a lot stronger. Damn that alcohol is strong! You can feel the alcohol burn the back of your throat all the way down to your stomach. It's that strong! If you can name a dark roasted flavor, it's in the smell and taste. Basically, the taste is just as dark as the color of the beer.  Mouthfeel: If you couldn't tell what the mouthfeel is like by reading all the strong dark flavors that are in this beer, then go drink a shot of bourbon. The amount of alcohol in that shot of bourbon has the same alcohol content this beer's mouthfeel has. That means this beer is extremely full bodied with an aftertaste of roasted malts, roasted dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, and then tops it off with a huge helping of alcohol. If the alcohol could have been roasted, it would have been. This is the type of beer that you can feel go to work on your body. Take your time with it.  Drinkability: I just read on BA that ""This stout is brewed with a hint of coffee and vanilla then aged in oak bourbon barrels for over a year."" Hint of coffee? It would have been more accurate if they said it was brewed with 2 pounds of roasted coffee beans per bottle! Where was the vanilla? If it was there, it was completely covered up with the dark roasted flavors and alcohol. Not the cheapest and most available beer out there, but damn if it isn't hella good! I know it's strong, but I sure could go for another bottle. Not after this one, but in the near future. If you got the money, it's worth a try at least once.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,liquidnoise,2.74,"Allow me to be the (presumably) first to say I didn't enjoy this at all. It tastes like burnt, old coffee with whiskey mixed in. I've had coffee stouts before, Schaffly's comes to mind, that I have enjoyed, and I love coffee by itself, so it's not that I just don't like the style. I made it through two bottles and opened a third just trying to enjoy it (because I paid 20 bucks for it, not because it is highly rated, I'm not that lame) and I gave up on the third one for a Budweiser I had in my fridge. Sorry if your a fanboy and I'm stepping on your toes, and you can flag this review all you want, and if they take it down I really dont care, but the truth is the truth and the truth must be known. I hope I can save others from wasting 20 bucks on this stuff.  Most DEFINATELY doesn't deserve to be the third highest rated on BA.com. And only 200 reviews are putting it up there with those legendary beers. They really need to weight the number of reviews before compiling lists like that.  BTW, if any of you Founder's fanboys live in the Peoria IL area and want the last one, email me. It's yours for free.  Oh, here's the mandatory stuff --  Served from a bottle.  Poured motor oil black, barely any head, the appearance was kind of a turnoff.  Smelled mostly of coffee.  Tasted like old, stale coffee with whiskey mixed in, and alcohol was prevalant. Taste was very disappointing.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,DrainBamage,4.57,"Pours black with a thin brownish head. The smell as almost all coffee with a little bourbon. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and is quite dry. The taste is equally balanced between bourbon and coffee. The bitterness doesn't really kick in until the aftertaste, but it quite strong. Overall this is a great American Double Stout. I've been looking out for this one for a long time and have not been disappointed.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,jsbrendle,4.9,"Oh, my. What a fabulous beer. Small sample pour among friends from a single bottle. Pours a thick, jet-black. Not much in the way of head, but not missing it either. Aroma is amazing... full of aromatic medium-roast coffee, mocha-vanilla and some bourbon-oak. Flavor equally stunning... chocolate, aromatic coffee tending toward dryish/bitter coffee, the sweetish ""creamy"" notes of the vanilla and oak and bourbon like a good ""irish coffee"" perhaps? Feels big and thick, making this a real nice slow sipper of a beer. At $8/12oz this is heresy, but I totally want to do something with this to serve in a dessert dish, perhaps it turns into a ""foam"" to top a creme brulee? or a sauce to moisten a bit of chocolate cake w/ fruit as another guest suggested? I don't know, something. I am having one of those ""god, I gotta use this"" foodie reactions that don't happen all that often, showing my excitement. This was absolute stout heaven.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Phatz,4.95,"Good God I am flipping out with excitement over my new favorite beer. I love it! Capones rules for carrying it and mac300 is absolutely the man. Thanks for hookin me up with this beer. Bill was willing to accept Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout in exchange and I God did I make out. This beer is the most coffee infused beer I could imagine. Péché Mortel, Speedway and Kentucky Breakfast are in a league of there own. This one is so smooth and easy drinking, I don't even know what to say.  Appearance: Pours a elegant pitch, coal black. A thick creamy chocolaty head has good retention and finally leaves behind a heavily laced glass.  Smell: Coffee. It is a chocolate mocha vanilla coffee aroma from the start. A nice touch of earthy barrel aging woody and smoky notes with a suggestion towards boozy bourbon attributes.  Taste: Magnificent. It is rich is flavor and in body from the start. Dark roasted malts and grains and a healthy dose of blackened coffee bean, with a smoky charcoal undertone and a vanilla chocolaty milky center with just the right balance of warming bourbon and alcohol flavors but yet remains incredibly approachable and drinkable. Again I say: Magnificent!  Mouthfeel: Viscous. Thick and chewy mouthfeel. The flavors overrun the feel with a long lasting woody bourbon coffee flavor embedded deep into the cheeks. [after tasting this beer side by side with Dark Lord RIS I determined the one thing DL has on KBS is a slightly more perfect slippery rich mouthfeel that I'd like to see a bit more of in this beer. Still, It is damn near *perfect*!  Drinkability: This is a sipping beer but it is so freaking good that I could go at it day and night for as long as I can stand.  Hope this is helpful.

1199,19960,kajerm,4.25,"Stubby brown bottle with a cool Kentucky-style label; this is review #100 for me, so I thought I'd make it a good one.  Pours like crude oil, black and viscous with a slight garnet hue; the head is probably the darkest one I've ever seen, a thin deep brown with slight lacing.  The nose is bourbon, oak, and loads of coffee. Some super-dark malt character. No alcohol aroma, although everything else about this beer suggests that it'll be there.  Opens up with a split second of chocolatey malty sweetness, followed by a rush of black malt astringency, coffee, and bourbon flavor that hangs on past the finish. Dryness and coffee flavor lasts forever.  The mouthfeel is heavy and slick, and suits the rest of the beer pretty well.  Drinkability isn't even a consideration here, because it's basically nonexistent. This is a barrel-aged 10% double stout, and pretty much demands sipping.  This is one beer that legitimately lives up to its inflated reputation. Next year, with luck, I'll try one with breakfast.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Duster72,4.3,"Pours inky black with a smallish dark brown head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is coffee, chocolate, and alcohol. Taste is dominated by the coffee, but the bourbon/oak flavor gives it a very nice nuance. Chocolates and vanilla also lurk in the background. I am not a coffee person, but this was pretty good. Mouthfeel was creamy and exceptional. I was surprised to be able to drink the whole thing since I am not a fan of coffee at all, but this was a pleasant change of pace for me. Very nice.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,beersabound,4.75,"Got this one in as a bonus beer in a trade w/ mcallister. And what a bonus it was. This was the best dessert I have had in months. It was like a whisky filled dark chocolate.  The beer was jet black with tiny bubbles that formed a beautiful, tight, dark brown head that fell in average time. This was suprising. I thought the head would hang out like a guinness. But no biggie. The aroma was prominently bourbon and coffee with some vanilla and chocolate. The mouthfeel was velvety, full and so nice I did not want to swallow for quite some time. The low CO2 level was very appropriate for this beer. The taste was very simlar to the aroma and is very flavorful with a long, pleasant aftertaste. I found it quite drinkable and a great dessert after some very spicy thai take out. Pairing this with most things would be futile but it would make vanilla ice cream much more interesting.  Nice work Founders. Keep it up.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Cresant,4.77,"Poured this 12 oz. brown bottle into a Samuel Smith tulip glass. No date. The body was a viscous, used, black, motor oil (cliched but true). The tiny brown head faded quickly.  Smell was mild chocolate and woodiness. It reminds me of a fudgesicle --rich chocolate and a wooden stick. Cocoa powder-like. Understated bourbon.  Taste was bittersweet cocoa. Light hops. Drip coffee. Sweet without being cloying. Nice dark chocolate lingering bitter aftertaste. Very well concealed alcohol. All of the elements of this beer work wonderfully together, no one component overpowers the intermingling of the malts, hops, & bourbon. I believe that is one of the reasons this beer is so revered.  Mouthfeel was full with some hops zippiness. This was an easy drinking formidible stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,alohaC,4.47,"Fresh 07 bottle courtesy of hoppymeal - thanks Derek! Pours a deep, dark brown - almost black and a little oily. A light brown head foams up about a half-inch, but diminishes quickly. Some of it clings to the glass and provides a nice lacing effect, though - something I find in most Founders beers. Similar to the regular breakfast stout in aroma with big chocolate malts and dark roasted coffee at the forefront with a faint smokieness of wood and bourbon in the background. Huge coffee flavor still dominates, but is smoothed out and creamier with hints of vanilla. Extremely balanced, smooth and slightly chewy on the palate with just moderate amounts of carbonation. The bourbon really makes more of a presence as the beer warms, but it still maintains its incredible balance and smoothness. Very, very drinkable and some of the coffee bitterness has mellowed. I really like what the wood did for this one. Definitely a beer that lives up to its reputation. Im glad I have more and some in the cellar from last years batch.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,SkinnyElvis,5,"Purchased at Capone's in Norristown. Pours a deep black with a little foam. Huge smell of coffee and chocolate. Taste is amazing: chocolate and coffee dominate with a hint of the bourbon aging plus vanilla. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth. I can't taste the ABV of 10% at all. This is truly an exceptional beer. My first beer rated as ""5's"" across the board. I am glad that I have a few more sitting in the stash.  Cheers.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Blakaeris,4.5,"Pours pitch black with a motor oil thickness. No head to speak of.  Aroma is smokey dark grain and generous coffee. Subdued bourbon notes.  Taste is hearty and complex. Strong espresso coffee flavoring up front with a nice touch of chocolate. Finish is dry and brings vanilla and bourbon with hints of dark fruit.  Mouthfeel is medium-full. Very smooth.  A very nice stout. I'm surprised at the smooth blending of flavor. Very tasty. Although there certainly is alcohol, it is well hidden for an enjoyable stout experience.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Westsidethreat,4.45,"Arooo!  A: Into the oversized Riedel snifter it goes. Pours thick like motor oil, almost as black too. Not a lot of carbonation going ona head conjured quickly but fell just as quick leaving a slick across the top remaining.  S: Fully roasted and choc full of nuts. Copius amounts of freshly ground espresso, bitter bakers chocolate and some oily licorice dominate the nose. In the highs the bourbon can be found, especially as it warms.  T: Begins with strong brewed coffee, totally charred. Chocolate mousse like flavors accompany the coffee and create a quite decadent moment. The more I drink it, the more pronounced and exhilarating the vanilla becomes. Totally creamy, shares a lot of traits with a chocolate milkshake thanks to abundant lactose. They dont try to hide the alcohol here, its present and accounted for. Only faint bourbon tastes, picking up most of the vanilla and not a lot of the astringent off flavors bourbon barrels can give.  M: Full body, creamy and rich. Perfect.  D: First sip I wasnt impressed at all. This is one of those beers that definitely grows on you. In all honesty, I could certainly use some more bourbon characterI think it would have balanced well with the rest of the flavors. Its a great stout but I dont think its the best.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,hammer09,4.63,"This is a very difficult beer to find in Chicago. Many thanks to a buddy of mine for his generosity in providing a bottle of this most excellent brew.  Poured a thick, blackish-brown, but appeared on the syrupy side. Head development was fairly minimal, maybe 1/8 of an inch, but this exhibited a very nice, deep brown color. Smell is malty with a good presence of roasted malt and coffee aromas. Definitely some volatile characteristics owing to the bourbon aging and high abv. Taste is simply exceptional yet complex. Bitter, semi-sweet chocolate and coffee flavors. Hint of vanilla and alcohol. Very good and nicely balanced. While very thick and syrupy, this beer goes down quite smooth. I had to pace myself so that I could savor it fully. Overall, one of the best stouts that I've ever tried and highly recommended.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,mynie,4.65,"Perfect pour. Deep, dark souless blackness with no hint of ruby and gigantic brown head.  Its chocolately nodes can be smelled feet away, but the coffee and bourbon don't hit you until you hold the glass up to your nose. All I can say is that it's smooth as candy. Where BCS burns like the sun, KBS lets the chocolate and whiskey odors dance gently around one another.  Tastes great. Nearly overpowering--stronger even than Bourbon County. Sweet, milky coffee starts things off along with a distinct alcohol burn, like breathing in light, pleasant gas fumes on a nice summer day. This moves into a roasted grain and whiskey middle with the strong overtones of rich milk chocolate staying throughout. The whiskey dies as the chocolate grows stronger, leaving a light, sour grain taste in its wake.  This is a world class beer. Not quite the bittersweet candydance of the regular Breakfast stout (and therefore less suited to a morning meal), but still immensely powerful, complex, smooth, and drinkable.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,BenSammis,4.87,"12 oz bottle poured into a Corsendonk chalice.  A: Pitch black with a small (~1/4 in.) dark brown head, which dissipates quickly with minimal lacing.  S: Huge burst of almost burnt coffee, like a fresh ristretto espresson shot, slightly smoky, hints of vanilla and cocoa.  T: Surprisingly little coffee up front, more molasses, chocolate, and vanilla/oak/bourbon, with the coffee and vanilla becoming more prominent as it traverses the palate. An intriguing little dash of hop bitterness hits the tip of my tongue just as I swallow and fades instantly, leaving the coffee, vanilla, and cocoa to duke it out for dominance on the finish.  M: Heavy, viscous, nearly oily, coats the mouth and lingers.  D: Virtually zero alcohol heat despite it's abv, but perhaps just a tad too much coffee - I could easily have too many of these without realizing it if I didn't know better.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,GbVDave,5,"Poured from a 12oz glasss into a 20oz imperial pint.  A: Pours with the viscosity of old nasty motor oil. Pitch black. A vigorous pour reveals a bubbly and creamy, dark mocha colored, two finger head.  S: Incredible aromas of coffee, bourbon, vanilla, and dark chocolate.  T: See everything above and add to that molassas, cherry, oak, brown sugar, and hops. The finish is an an exercise in flavor balance. One second it's all coffee, then it's all bourbon, then it's bitter dark chocolate, then it's tart cherries, then...  M: Silky smooth and completely satisfying! Creamy and full and thick and rich. Amazing.  D: Drinkability if off the charts. Sure it's packing 10% but with the myriad of things going on in this beer, you soon forget all about the abv and just sip and savor this unbelievable treat.

1199,19960,scott,4.32,"V.07 I was one of the first to taste when it initially arrived in Cleveland, and wasn't impressed with this years batch to buy more than one bottle, which is now the one I'm reviewing. Now, I'm wishing I purchased a couple more when I had the chance. But, not that I believe that this years model is stellar stuff. More for the cellaring aspect. I have a 2006 that I would like to vertical. Dark pour, with thin rimmed head. Pleasant coffee aroma, rich and complex in the nose. You will want to taste it. Taste is an indulgence of more rich coffee & dark chocolate. Clean, creamy, and well balanced. No harsh bourbon/alcohol characteristics to speak of. Now, I must confess, this is a very good beer. Highly anticipated. A very well crated beer. Yet, the $20/4 isn't justified, in my opinion. I have found solice in say, Bell's Expedition or Brooklyn BCS (the latter being highly reasonable and just as satisfying in complexity) so go out and judge for yourself.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Bottled in 2007 and served at just a hair below cellar temp.  Dark, tarry black body with a solid finger of dusky cocoa brown head. Nice lacing. Nose features a healthy dose of dark coffee, accented by vanilla, bourbon, caramel, creme brulee, roasted malts, and campfire. Wow. The complexity coupled with the perfect balance of components is amazing.  Roasted malt bitterness greets the tongue, followed by dark chocolate, and sharp espresso. Bourbon flavors sneak in, along with oaky notes, vanilla, caramel, and dark fruits. Lots to process here. Bourbon notes increase toward the finish. Warming and rich.

S- Probably the best nose of a beer I've tasted. It's so complex and pungent that I wouldn't mind just smelling the beer without a taste. It contains all the notes of the taste which I rarely observe. Dark chocolate, fresh roasted coffee beans, oak, bourbon, cream.  T- Taste is just the same. Strong dark chocolate and coffee bean surrounded with a halo of bourbon notes to add complexity and balance. There is the slightest hint of blueberries and currants. Pretty bitter, which I think might even be a good thing in this case, as it's easy to get overly sweet with an oaked beer.  M- Could be a little creamier, but besides that no complants here. The beer does a good job of coaxing your mouth into wanting more, without being too assertive with the bitterness.  D- Absolutly delicious to smell and taste.

Appearance- Black colored pour with a dirty brown head, approx 1/2 inch. Settles at a very light rim. Lacing is spotty and streaky.  Smell- Kind of a cross between some burnt wet cardboard and wet cigarette ashes. Some chocolate and deep malt is also found underneath.  Taste- Taste is spot on. The first sip is very much reminescent of the scent. A swig of cigarette ashes that only lasts for a split second. Then you get a wonderful thick coating of deep dark chocolate in your mouth. Very mild hops are present. Mostly deep chocolaty goodness with a hint of bourbon.  Mouthfeel- Pretty creamy and very coating. Carbonation level is a bit higher than I would like for a stout.

1199,19960,klewis,3.75,"Thanks to Markgugs for this one.  A: Pours thick and solid black withvery little head or foam. Little lacing.  S: Deep smell of burnt coffee, charred wood, and alcohol.  T: Like the smell, earthy with burnt flavors. Prominent flavors of coffee and anise with noticable alcohol. Quite full-flavored and complex. Unforunately, I find the taste to be quite similar to Founders' other stouts.  M: Thinner in body than expected, although still a bit hefty. Moderate carbonation with a creamy texture.  D: Quite good, but not worth the hype in my opinion. The taste is good, but nothing special, and the alcohol is a bit hot.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,greenbeaner,4.82,"Wow...I was pretty excited to review this beer so here it goes...Poured into a 16oz pint glass, the appearence was thick and opaque black. A somewhat thin head, though it is very dark. There is also slight lacing apparent.  This beer smells phenomenal, nothing quite like it...Smells like an Irish coffee...with espresso, bourbon and vanilla, also a slight sugary sweetness.  Tastes just like it smells! It's really apparent why they call it Kentucky breakfast...It would definitely feel natural to drink this beer with some eggs and bacon first thing in the morning...There is a sharp bitterness towards the finish but only for a second, and I think it's necessary to balance out the smooth coffee flavors. The 10% abv is also masked quite well, with just the slightest hint of alcohol in in the finish. It leaves you feeling like you have coffee breath :)  Mouthfeel is thick, complex, and long lasting  This is one helluva beer...all I can say is coffee coffee coffee...I have one more bottle and you can bet I will be saving it for a special morning.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,beerphan,4.15,"12oz bottle -&gt; nonic following Founders notching system bottled in Feb. Year: 2007  Pours an oily impenatrable black with a small brownish tan head that recedes quickly to dishwater suds. Some pangean clumps of lace.  Nose: Upon popping the cap, my first whiff was unmistakeably BOURBON. After the pour, bourbon, smokey wood, licorice, burnt coffee grinds,  Smooth flavor, bourbon takes a step back and is only a lingering tickle on the back of the tongue, very pleasing and well done while not over doing it. (whew, because i am not a fan of extreme bourbon flavor in a beer). Begins with some dark chocolate and coffee grinds. An ever so slight bit of bittering on the finish, with a lingering smokey coffee grind bourbon flavor. Alcohol warms the body, but doesn't overwhelm the flavor.  Thick and chewy mouthfeel.  Definately meant to be a sipper, though my impatience makes me intuitively reach for the glass hoping to discover another complexity in this immense brew. Drinkability suffers dues to high price, availabilty and heavy coffee grind flavors.

1199,19960,quasimoto,2.24,"So this beer pours a nice deep opaque black, that lets no light though. It also tops off with a nice deep tan head that is very dense, and laces very nicely. So this is where this beer went WAAAY down hill for me. This beer starts off with that obvious deep coffee grain aroma, that has the hint of paper, and some grass to it. not hops, but that old musty grass. Oh the The bourbon barrel comes up from the rear with the hickory aroma as well. Of course there is the standard chocolate, molasses, licorice, and well the standards. But damn, that coffee/musty smell has got to go. Its not balanced, and... it just has to go. The aromas transfer to the flavor unfortunatly and make this beer damn near undrinkable. Leaves a very unpleasant taste of cardboard along with the aforementioned aromas that make up the taste. Man, this is rough. The mouthfeel is nice. it Starts off with a nice smooth creamy feeling. Little bit of carbination. Leaves no residue. Its just nice. Now for the drinkability. I just have to say that this beer is way, WAAAYY over-hyped. It should be in the top, 50, but not the top ten, or thirty for that matter. I am not a fan.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,montageman,4.4,"Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Very thick, almost syrupy pour that is topped off by a little bit of lacing. This is one dark beer - pitch black & beautiful. The smell is dominated by espresso & high quality espresso at that with a bit of vanilla in the background. Complex is the best way to describe the taste - espresso, dark chocolate, vanilla, and a little sugary sweetness. A nice tasting beer, but the taste cannot live up to the smell. Mouthfeel is disappointing - the carbonation adds to the complexity, but I would like more creaminess here. All of that said, this is a highly drinkable stout - perfect for dessert on its own or paired with any number of sweets. Highly recommended.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S: a little bit of chocolate and coffee with that ever present tinge of alcohol  T: Much like the smell, overtones of chocolate and coffee mix with bourbon to create a rich taste.  M: Smoothe, and creamy  D: I am not usually a stout drinker, but this one is very drinkable. It is really thick and intimidating but once you start drinking you can't stop. every sip is an exploration into the subltle flavors bouncing around in this beer  note: I love that the number 4 beer on BA comes from my home city.

1199,19960,MICAMD,4.68,"A- One of the thickest, blackest beers I have ever seen. A very large, surprising amount of carbonation that leaves a beautiful dark brown/ orange head the entire time.  S- Coffee right off the bat, then some chocolate, and then the bourbon kicks in. Some oak and vanilla highlights are there as well.  T- A lot of coffee, chocolate, and vanilla. The charred oak taste is great. The bourbon is a little heavy at first but after drinking this for awhile, it fades to the back a little bit and adds a great amount of complexity to it.  M- This thing is thick. Velvety smooth and heavy. This thing coats your mouth, but its not harsh or overwhelming at all. This is amazing.  D- The richness of this thing was a little much.

As the notes say it's not just a double stout aged in bourbon barrels. It's an entirely different beer  Appearance is black to opaque. Head is minimal.  Aromas of deep rich oak and alcohol. Slight coffe and cream with a big shot of whiskey.  Taste is creamy, chocolatey, oakey, coffee/caramel whiskey.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,SacoDeToro,4.79,"The beer poured a rich coal black with a small brown head.  The aroma was huge. It was bursting with roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, bourbon and vanilla. There was a little alcohol in the nose as well. No hops.  The flavor of the beer was richly malty with a ton of intense coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Vanilla was there to accent things. The bourbon flavor was very pronounced. I'm a big bourbon fan so this was a real treat for me. There was a nice creaminess to the beer and it also had some faint tangy notes. The hops were there to balance things out, but weren't too powerful.  The carbonation was perfect. I can't believe this beer is 10% - it's dangerously drinkable at that level.

1199,19960,objectivemonkey,4.32,"Into a tulip glass, pours an oil thick jet black crazy crazy, no head until the glass is full and only then does a thin quarter inch of dark tan head grow from the abyss, sticks around for a few seconds, then fades away into a swirl of film and some stringy lacing. Pretty nice, but for the small glob of syrupy guppy goo floating on top (fished out, forgotten, on to drinking!!).  Aroma is deep, dark, and nasty, loads of coffee up in there, vanilla hints and dark chocolate, and just barely some licorice and brown sugar, very faint. The bourbon is nicely handled but a bit faintish, I think a good thing, letting everything else come through clean and clear, very satisfying.  Taste is complex, tasty, thick. Taking it slow with this one, potent, the boubon much more expressive up front, playing center stage with fresh coffee grounds, merging into nicely chocolaty toward the end, with coffee grounds faint and lending a bit of lingering strength through the finish, while the bourbon lingers in the background, and lingers, and sits around for a but longer. Adjusts itself, shifts to the other cheek, hangs around some more. Finally, after a few minutes, take another sip, repeat, fantastic.  The mouth is preffy full, could be a little thicker, but beautifully smooth and warm, just enough carbonation, pretty darn nice. Now, let me just say that I am no fan of bourbon, but here it melds perfectly into a stouty perfection that is just fantastic.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,aforbes10,4.73,"I opened this bottle from the 2006 bottling last night as i became worried it might not age very well and decided i didn't want to let it go to waste. Served at cellar temp. Poured perfectly black with a tawnt brown head and great lacing. Clumpy oily foam bits in the head. Odor is slightly oxidized bitter chocolate and copper. Chocolate bourbon odor becomes more prominent as the beer warms. This appears to have been the only part of the beer that has suffered from age. Taste remains fantastic. Can i give this a 6 out of 5 please? The chocolate and slight bitter malt combine smoothly with the warming alcohol to create almost a truffle-like deliciousness. hints of creamy vanilla more prominent on the finish. super thick and almost foamy mouthfeel. To sum up, it's changed slightly with a year's aging...mostly in the nose, but its still sensational and i'll be buying as much as i can when i see it next.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smell: Amazing smell. Strong bourbon, coffee and stout smell. Kinda hits you in the face but at the same time, makes you want more.  Taste: Taste is the same way. Powerful complex flavors coming together perfectly. The bourbon, coffee and vanilla blend together to make an intense but delicious beer.  Mouthfeel: Well carbonated and surprising smooth considering the alcohol and percentage. Makes you wonder how they do it...  Drinkability: This is definately a sipper. Not to taken lightly and I don't think I could have more then two of these in a sitting.  Overall a delicious beer that deserves it's rank as #3 on BA.

Left to warm on the counter for an hour and consumed around 50F.  Pours black as night with a foamy khaki head that settles to 1/2"". Nice lacework.  The scent is dusty and billowing with premium grinded coffee, vanilla, dark unsweetened bitter chocolate and a wonderful whisp of bourbon. You can smell this beer across the table. And I swear I can actually hear this beer singing to me. I think I hear Muddy Waters Im a Maaaannn You think Im lying?!  Wow, everything I just smelled is translated exactly into blossoming, smooth and fresh flavors. There's a perfect balance of the dark and bitter chocolate paired with the acidic and bitey premium coffee punctuated with an ever-so-smooth backdrop of bourbon, oak and vanilla all encompassed in roasted and caramelized glorious malts. Falvors are masterfully balanced, dry, sweet & huge.  Mouthfeel is like cream. Velvety smooth and silky. Full bodied with a long and lush flavorful finish with a nice counterbalance of dryness and warmth.  Drinkability is through the roof considering the enormousness of this ale. A slow and steady course of sipping is what this beer is built for. Slow and steady lad, slow and steady.  This beer has already garnered iconic status, and deservedly so. I'm proud to know it's from a brewery 45 minutes from my house also. As I type this, a roundly balanced resonance of premium bourbon flavor is lining the inside of my cheeks.

The head began as a half finger of reddish brown foam that fell to a thick collar and a wispy cap. The lacing was somewhat spotty, but was still clingy. The smell was sweet roasted malts, strong coffee, ripe dark fruits, molasses, rum, and spicy alcohol. The taste was initially espresso, a strong roasted character with moderate bitterness that got lost in the overt peppery and warming alcohol. There were flashes of sweetness throughout balanced against hop bitterness and a moderate dryness in the finish. The body was thick and heavy, the carbonation was fairly light.  Wow!

1199,19960,froggyfrog,4.97,"A highly anticipated beer for me for sure. A huge thanks to hoppymeal for slipping me this bottle.  12 ounce brown bottle. Beer served in a clean glass snifter.  Liquid lamp black with a feeble sea foam head that etches an unyielding line of hardened foam on the glass. A very black beer, impenetrable to light.  Aroma is sweet Hershey's chocolate syrup and Jack Daniel's. A mouthwatering combination to sat the least. Also comprising the nose is brewed black coffee some toffee, vanilla and dark bittersweet chocolate. Wow!  The flavor: An expertly done smoky liquid bourbon oak and black coffee mix. Toasted oak and grain with a mild vanilla finish.  [Some have complained of the level of bourbon evident in this brew, calling it overpowering, but I dig it just the way it stands. The whiskey barrel brings depth and a strong flavor to this beer and that suits me just fine. I'm not a liquor drinker myself (to much alcohol burn getting in the way of my flavors), but I love the taste of good whiskey, etc. in my beer. That being said: this is not a hot alcohol beer or one overpowered by bourbon flavors. I call it just right. 5.0]  MF: Silky and smooth. Drinks like an oatmeal stout liquor if there was such a monster. Really, it floats across the tongue like so much hand whipped cream.

The beer is nearly black in color.  smell: Espresso beans dripping with warm milk chocolate blended with rich, roasted grain syrups. Thick, sweet cream. Wonderfully woody bourbon fumes and an aged American hop aroma that melds just right with the other smells. Hardwood that has been exposed to sweet, moist pipe tobacco for quite some time. Practically perfect.  mouthfeel: The low, smooth carbonation and full, creamy body combine to create a silky mouthfeel. Almost spot on...just a touch more thickness for me.  taste: Sweet, medium roast coffee bean blended with milk chocolate and cream upfront. The flavor gradually turns from sweet to dry, with the roast taking over. The bourbon doesn't make itself known until after the swallow, when it plays around for a second with the espresso and chocolate. Low American hop flavor. A moderate bitterness comes out in the finish with a hint of ethanol, and lingers for quite awhile with dry coffee and roasted barley flavors. Just a touch more malt depth to the taste and it would be an easy 5  drinkability: a breeze  Shipped to NC by dirtylou sometime late last winter (please send more).

Flavor was upfront bitter charred oak, dark coffee, with light sweet bourbon and bitter sour vegetal soy bean taste, followed by a moderately bitter earth and dark chocolate sweetness on a long oaken finish.

1199,19960,orfeu,5,"Bottle received in trade last summer from nflmvp (big ups, Steve!). Poured into a 17-ounce snifter. Ridiculously black -- pitch, tar, etc. -- with a dark mocha foam cap that fizzles to a dedicated ring and a thin swirled mass in the center of the glass. Simply amazing aroma complex: striking scent of earthy wet hardwood, with unsweetened Mexican chocolate, vanilla, and coffee aromas rounding out the scent. And the taste is just unbelievable. Every sip is a mouthful of sweet dark chocolates filled with incredibly smooth whiskey and white pepper. The 10% alcohol by volume is unmistakably noticeable, but the way in which it has been so deftly melded with the rest of the flavors is beyond belief. There are also dark fruit flavors: dried Bing cherries, prune nectar, currants. The silkiness of the mouthfeel is otherworldly -- no alcoholic slickness, just pure zero-resistance smoothness. An earthy finish gives way to an aftertaste of all the above-mentioned flavors that aboslutely demands repetition of the entire experience.  God. Damn.  I had been sitting on this bottle for a few months now and only opened this one tonight because I recently received another one in trade (maximum respect to hoppymeal for that one!).

Smell- First thing that hits the nose is the bourbon. Bakers chocolate follows. Chocolate-covered cherries, ground coffee, and nuts. Very complex and interesting.  Taste- Bourbon, smooth chocolate, cherries, vanilla, raw coffee, nuts at times, and finally, alcohol.  Mouthfeel- Very much a full-bodied brew as expected. Gets creamier as it warms.

Almost no head and a hint of mocha-colored film. Rich and thick.  S: What is that? Oh my, what an incredibly appealing aroma! Huge espresso/coffee nose. Bittersweet chocolate. Woody smell, smoky and sweet - like the most savory barbeque. Notable bourbon barrel-tinged alcohol, too. What a nose full - could smell this all night...however...  T: ...could it possibly it taste as great as the smell? In a word: yes. Extremely rich and complex. Begins like a mildly sweet & toasty oatmeal stout. Packs a wallop of deeply roasted malts with heavy emphasis on chocolate and coffee. An oaky flavor of vanilla and mildly sweet spice then develops to a pleasantly dry finish, warmed with the 10% alcohol. An incredible taste.  M: Very smooth, the influence of barrel-aging really mellows this beer. Coats the mouth and lingers for quite a while. One to savor.  D: An incredible beer... a sipper in small portions and not for the faint of heart. I'm very glad to have tried this one and recommend to anyone who has a chance to get some.

Aroma - very dark roasted malt, with definite scents of chocolate, espresso, and charred oak.  Taste - an intense play of the oak barrel with the chocolate. At times the char almost tastes peppery like chipotle. Not much else gets through besides the alcohol on the swallow. The burnt, charred flavor is more intense at first and mellows with temperature. It's basically a chocolate and bourbon experience, but it is so over the top that it's a bit of a chore to enjoy. Some intensities of flavor I like, but this bourbon influence tends to take over the profile making it hard to pick out and enjoy any other flavors.  Mouthfeel - not as heavy as I expected but still silky smooth. Good amount of carbonation and still lays down a serious layer on the palate.

Smell was very nice, fresh roasted coffee with a hint of vanilla and some nice wood and bourbon notes as well. Taste was even better. The coffee started out but quickly I noticed a nice wooden and bourbon flavor, paired with vanilla and hints of cocoa.

The first notable thing is the low carbonation, evidenced by almost no pffft sound when I opened the bottle. Also there was no head, just a thin ring of tan bubbles where the beer meets the glass.  But the smell and taste are the most important dimensions, and both were really good. It smelled STRONG, like whiskey and roasted malt. The flavor was heavily malted and had decent currents of chocolate and whiskey. No coffee that I could smell or taste. Or maybe on reflection just a hint of coffee.  The mouthfeel was thick and chewy, really nice.

Taste starts with coffee, adds a dark Hershey kiss, a healthy dollop of vanilla, some oak, and a dash of earthy hops at the finish. Bit of late belly warming as it slides down the throat.

Wonderfully well rounded aroma of fresh roasted coffee with a vanilla mocha twist and a slight tender pull of chocolate chip waffles.  Black breakfast in a glass. Much like the origianl BK stout but with a hearty warming of deep dark earthy roasted stuff. Vanilla, coffee, roast, earth, slight charred edging along some thick Belgian waffles, touch of buttercream, chocolate drizzled, and oh so lovingly warm. Something to wake up for indeed. Like a huge waffle breakfast when your eyes are bigger then your stomach and the coffee is just right and the syrup fills every square just right. The finish is the capper as it rounds around with a chocolatey warming and a perk of roast and fluff lingering. Puffy chocolate remains on the cheeks and floats like hand whipped cream.  Total breakfast feel. Fulfilling & without much effort to do so. Warming, smooth, delicate, sensationable, oozing the form of easy going syrup with enough thickness to soak into the pores of the waffle and drench the buds in flavor as the thickness settles and warms the belly, much like a good breakfast should.  I would love to have this stuff for breakfast every day. Although a few of these first thing at the crack of dawn and I may be napping through lunchtime. Is there a lunch stout?

1199,19960,brentk56,4.21,"Appearance: Pours a jet black color with a bubbly tan head that leaves tracks of lacing around the glass  Smell: Bourbon and coffee dominate the nose with chocolate shavings underneath  Taste: Starts with a boozy Bourbon-influenced chocolate flavor with some bitterness building in the middle; after the swallow, the Bourbon arises and meets the coffee tones, imparting a mellow flavor; the finish is relatively sweet but that bitter coffee flavor persists to the finish  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and smooth; not as thick as I expected and there is very little carbonation despite the foamy head  Drinkability: This is a wonderful stout to contemplate as an after dinner sipper but it is a bit boozy and the mouthfeel is a touch thin",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,trep,4.1,"Dark as night opaque, red glints around the edges.  Delicious aroma of chocolate and vanilla, coffee, and the bourbon is lurking in the background. A bit of chalkiness.  Chalky at first but super smooth as it warms up. Chocolate, coffee and a smooth vanilla round it out. Bourbon not as present as I thought it would be but its there.  Medium bodied and medium carbonation.  Very easy drinking.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,TheBungyo,4.47,"If you change your own oil and don't take the easy way out by going to Jiffylube or something, you'll recognize the pour as dirty motor oil. A nice brown head seals the deal sitting like a crown atop the head of a king. Body is completely black and if you were hoping to catch a glimpse of something from the other side of this opaque liquid you will surely be saddened.  Nose is like a baseball bat to the face of lovely vanilla and sharp alcohol. There's also some roasted coffee bean at the tail end. Very nice.  Taste is huge on the bourbon. Lots of vanilla, chocolate, espresso, roastiness and a dry finish. This is wonderful. A nice mix of the stout I want to taste and the bourbon that should accentuate it.  Mouth is slick and oily. Thick as if something was added to thicken it. It feels as if there are layers to it somehow.  I could see myself buying this again and again. This is a true gem.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The ensuing lace that's left behind is a solid sheet on the sides of my glass.  Smell; the bourbon is definitely present, but it's not overwhelming, and mixes very well with the coffee aromas. There's a bit of chocolate in there, as well a bit of dark fruits that just barely seep through.  Taste; whoa, that bourbon flavor is first to hit, but boy is it really smooth. The bourbon fades nicely into a very rich chocolate espresso topped with cherries. The alcohol is felt with a mild warming in theback of my throat. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy and velvety, and about as good as it gets. Drinkability is really high when you take into consideration such a high abv.  This was very good for this relatively cool rainy evening.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,swhitt,4.31,"Picked this up on August 13, 2006 at the Sunset Grill and Tap, a few minutes after the keg was tapped. Reviewed from notes. I'd been looking forward to tasting this for ages and it finally came my way so I figured I'd check it out.  Poured into a Delerium Tremens snifter, this guy was dark black, completely opaque. The head was brown and extremely foamy - big, big bubbles instead of the small teeny ones I'm used to. Head retention was good.  Smells of coffee and bourbon, leaning towards the bourbon side. Very roasty. Vanilla was also definitely present, although not as present as the other smells.  Taste is dark and roasty, much more so than I'm used to in stouts. This is tasty - notes of bourbon, coffee and vanilla. This is a delicious brew, just not my favorite example of the style.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,tboom29,4.6,"I stopped into the Sunset Tap to sample this brew. I was not disappointed. Served in a snifter, this brew pours a nice deep brown, almost black. A long lasting brown tinged head sits on top of the beer.  The smell is outstanding. Roasted malts, chocolate, dark fruit all play off each other very nicely.  It was at first served a bit too cold, so I let it sit for 10 minutes or so, which was a challenge in itself. Needless to say I was rewarded for my patience. The taste of the roasted malts, chocolate and slight fruitiness were all there, along with a slight bouron background which was outstanding. Not too carbonated. A nice smooth mouthfeel throughout. The beer finished with a slightly bitter coffee finish, which any coffee fanatic would love as well.  Overall, this is an outstanding beer. Try it. My only complaint was that my one beer trip turned into a 2 beer trip at the Sunset as I had to order another KBS.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,MuddyFeet,4.65,"Served on-tap and poured into a scotch snifter with my Sunday brunch today at Sunset Tap & Grill. Liquid velvet. Just so simply, wonderfully smooth.  Poured the color of chocolate milk that had too much Hershey's syrup added. Just a slight shade shy of being really black and more of an extremely dark brown. Slight scuzz of carbonation resting on top of the beer that I just swirled around the snifter. Aroma was chocolate and raisins.  This beer is scary if it is really 10% ABV. The brewers did a masterful job of concealing the alcohol. Drinking it is like drinking liquid velvet. Just smooth, rich, relaxing and warming. All sorts of chocolate tones, coffee flavors, raisins, and prunes. However, what really makes the flavor in this beer is the presence of cream and vanilla. Like drinking a milk shake--but not as cold and with alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth with a texture like licking velvet I would imagine. Just so smooth and rich. I had to drag myself out of the bar without ordering another.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,expatsteve,4.89,"Thanks to battlekow and Golden2wenty1 for the opportunity to try this.  Appearance: Black with the faintest tan hues. Medium viscosity, with just a little head and slight lacing out of the bottle. Impressive, but subdued in appearance.  Aroma: This is the hook for this beer - coffee bitters and acidity, vanilla, and a biscuity snap. Some burnt toffees and just a hint of bourbon in the background - this is more the support for the whole nose rather than the emphasis.  Taste: This is maybe one of the best beers I've ever had. The bourbon enhances the coffee finish, leaving it crisp and peppery alongside the more common roasted flavors. Cocoa, rosted chocolate malts on the front palate. Some cream and vanilla on the middle palate. Bitterness and malt compete in a perfect finish. An amazingly balanced beer that using the barrel aging as a means of boosting all the other flavors, rather than drowning them out.  Mouthfeel: Bourbon thins an otherwise full body, but renders a perfect brew in the process. Dry, crisp finish carried by low carbonation and followed by a rich malt aftertaste.  Drinkability: Awesome - this beer has made me rethink my opinion of barrel aging. I can't wait to try this on-tap tomorrow in the lead up to the Great Taste. One of the smoothest, most drinkable beers I've ever had.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S- Sweet malts and coffee dominate. There is some fruity sweetness and a slight chocolate note too.  T- Cherries, coffee and bitter chocolate. Huge taste with no holes at all. Nice hop balance. On my scale this one tied Speedway and lost by .5 to Dark Lord. I love the huge coffee presence.  M- Creamy and thick with a very mild carbonation.

Sensational nose which combines the characteristics of the original beer (intense coffee, roast and chocolate) and the barrel (vanilla, coconut, oak) to create a smell that is pure bliss, resembling a melting Snickers bar. Flavor, unfortunately, was a bit of a let down. It just didnt seem very concentrated and full, not as intense and gripping as the nose promised.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,feloniousmonk,4.45,"Deepest ebon hue, an impentrable blackness, above which nestles a modest ring of earthy brown, espresso tinges.  Aroma is chocolate first, followed by coffee, then molasses, brown sugar, and licorice.  Taste: Full and thick as it boards the mouth, slipping rich, deliciousness everywhere...this is stoutness of the highest order. Bourbon flavor is here, but feels less sweet than the same stuff straight from the bottle, an impressive blend of flavors. Further in, I can taste the charcoal, even.  So huge, and rich, and very rewarding. Each sip has enough flavor to taste a good 20 minutes, if you're not too thirsty...definitely a sippin' stout! If you don't take your time, you're spoiling a wonderful experience.  I must say, this is a hyperbolic label, but it's all truth in advertising. Gotta wonder how they slip it past the beurocracy, with it's jesting claims of giving relief from all manner of ailments. It is most assuredly ""good for everything a stout ought to be good for.""

1199,19960,SupaCelt,4.55,"Whoops. This might be a little past prime drinking. Yeah, sadly this is only great now and not stupendous. The looks of this beer are enough to get the salivation processes rolling. It is dark. It forms a small cocoa coloured head that fades rapidly, but leaves some decent streamers of lace behind as a reminder. Fine bubbles of carbonation squiggle upwards as a ring holds fast around the perimeter of the glass.  The nose is grainy and full of coffee notes. The bourbon accents seem to be a bit faded out at this point as this thing is not actually a young pup anymore. I feel some peanut shell or butter impressions as well as the vanilla qualities drift across my nares. Beans and smoke. Woody whiskey.  The taste is ashy and coffee and bourbon. There are no off qualities to be found. This tastes great. Great stout flavours improved by the barrel aging process. There is a nice creaminess to the taste as well.  The mouthfeel is the best aspect of this beer. KBS hits the mouth and bathes my palate in flavour and all the while a fluffed and creamy mouthfeel enhances the experience into bliss. This feels whipped and creamy like a fine malt and is matched by no other beer I have consumed.  Drinkability is superb. This is just a lip smacking good stuff. This beer has fallen down a few points from the initial release, which saddens me. I had many a four pack of this in the prime of this beer's life and I am sad to report that it is starting to make a decline. Drink this now if you have it. I am confident that this brew, when fresh off the dock, was at least as good as any beer that ever crossed my lips. I have graded it as such. This is surely worthy of the acclaim it has received. I only hope there are subsequent barrlels of it, and that everyone will be able to enjoy this as fresh as possible. A truly mindblowing experience for lovers of the stout style and your mama.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,RedwoodGeorge,3.79,"This beer is impressive...and yet not. Quite a conundrum we have here.  The beer pours out as a rather uninspiring black mass. Not quite as thick and chunky as many big stouts and no head at all - even with a vigorous finish to the pour. No head, no lacing.  The smell is complex and inviting with lots of dark malts including both caramel and molasses coupled with strong notes of coffee with a touch of vanilla and chocolate. No hops to speak of and (surprisingly at 10% ABV) no sweet alcohol notes.  Flavor is complex but a bit heavy on the coffee. Again the previously mentioned malt flavors with a good dose of coffee adding both a dark note and quite a bit of bitterness. Disappointingly no real oaky notes like I've found in many other barrel aged stouts. There are faint hints of bourbon but it's pretty far in the background.  Mouthfeel is silky and smooth but a but cloying and with no carbonation to speak of there's a pretty persistent sugar coating on the tongue.  You know, this is a good beer but in the end it's a disappointment. There aren't the kind of oaky or bourbon characters I'd have expected in a barrel aged stout. Side by side there may be differences between the Breakfast Stout but it just didn't warrant the fanfare. Either the stout needed more barrel aging, the barrels needed more residual whiskey or perhaps a coffee heavy stout just isn't a good candidate for the process.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smell- Lots of coffee with some milky, creamy notes, smoked and roasted malts, as well as my old friend JACK.  Taste- Starts out with what taste like spent coffee grounds, but develops into something much more creamy and even slightly bitter. The coffee, vanilla, and bourbon barrel aging are very evident. Imgaine having a cup of straight black coffee thats been sitting on the hot plate for an hour with a spalsh of vanillas bean and a shot of JACK.  Mouthfeel- Pretty smooth and some very surprisingly noticeable carbonation. This helped to anhance the blackk coffee bitterness that I like in both my coffee and my beer.

Mouthfeel is oh so buttery smooth and creamy with just a tingle of hops/carbonation. Taste is also unbelievable. Coffee...lots of vanilla....light boubon....chocolate...almost a cream chocolate...more vanilla. WOW. This could be the inside of a cream sees candy...or better a Beligium chocolate..a handmade Belgium chocolate. Aftertaste is again sudden vanilla...chocolate, bourbon vanilla. This is more than a desert...more than a meal....more like a sin. I know that all 5's are not often supposed to happen and I have only given them to one other beer. 5's mean you cannot improve anymore. For this beer, I do not think there could be anything better.

Nothing is dominant over then other aroma, instead everything works in harmony with each everything else. The taste is like the aroma, but a bit more intense.

1199,19960,UnionMade,4.94,"Pitch black, topped with a wimpy tan mist. The head dies out very quickly, leaving the brew naked. Very dark and oily looking. Attractive, besides the lack of head. Big, big french vanilla coffee aroma. Sweetish, not at all what I expected. I was anticipating something brash, bold and american, and instead I get this velvety little gem wrapped covered in milk chocolate. Silky and creamy. Phenomenal. Strangely, the scent gets a bit dusty/musty as the brew near room temperature, like an old closet. Not bad, it's more reminiscent of inspcting old wooden barrels, sticking your head right in there. The flavor opens with sweet, milk chocolate covered coffee beans, drizzled with a bit of caramel and white chocolate. Lightly carbonated, very, very smooth, allowing the malty sweetness to really come forth. The bourbon aging adds a silken, creamy vanilla note. Creamy and full bodied, but leaves off rather dry. Actually, the vanilla is quite pronounced. A hint of smoke, with lighter, restrained hop bitterness in the finish. Very long finish, managed by bittersweet roastiness and an inexplicable milk chocolate flavor. Alcohol is present, but melds perfectly with the other flavors so as to be part of the experience...and what an experience it is. Give me a little bit of head on this beer that lasts for over a minute, and this is pure black gold. Solid gold.

Since then, it has grown on me and become my favorite beer in the whole world, and worthy of all fives. Here's my updated review:  A: Pours out like 10W30, with hardly any head, but what is there is light brown - none of this tan colored head - it was the color of brown sugar.  S: Wonderful! Tons of dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, bourbon, hints of vanilla, maple syrup, and bread. I could catch whiffs of it a foot from the glass - it saturated my nose.  T: It tasted superb, as well: the alcohol was perfectly present, along with the java and dark chocolate flavors, and even a hint of maple syrup. If I had to drink a beer for breakfast, this would be a good choice. There was a lingering dark roasted bourbon flavor.  M: Rich and creamy, with an appropriate measure of carbonation to complement the alcoholic bite to it.  D: No, you couldn't keep pounding these, but it's a lovely, awesome beer to drink.

1199,19960,blitz134,4.36,"Review 200 for me...figured I'd celebrate with what seems to be an amazing beer. It is also the first day of summer and we hit 97 in ATL today, so what better reason...  No sense in describing the color, its pitch black...nothing else. Dark chocolate milk colored head, only about 1/4"" on the pour, reduced to a slick black surface with some bubble ""scum"" sitting on top.  Dark semi-sweet chocolate and dark coffee beans. Bourbon alcohol wafts up and fills the nostrils. The taste comes on strange to me, I get flavor at the beginning and when I swallow it, I don't really get anything and then a huge hit at the end...a bit strange. Dark chocolate and coffee blend form the inital basis for this with a bit of charred malts. The finish is strong with bourbon and wood and the definate effects of alcohol. Alcohol is more of a typical whiskey flavor But I don't find the alcohol to burn at all or to be unpleasant. This version really plays up the bourbon.  This is the creamiest beer I've had to date, it feels extremely viscous on the tongue. It coats every bit of the mouth and the flavor hangs in for a long while. Carbonation is low as would be expected.  Drinkability is good. This is a great beer but its upfront nature limit this to no more than one a night for me. I definately would like more, just not tonight.

Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/4"" dark brown head over an opaque dark brown/black brew. Head fades pretty quick, to an uneven layer of bubbling, with minimal yet present lacing. Aroma is coffee, bourbon and vanilla, just as I expected. Taste is sweet coffee upfront, which immediately is coupled with hearty bourbon, with touches of vanilla and oak.

Hard pour to get a half finger of dark brown head over a pitch liquid. No edgings when held to light. Smells espresso, chocolate, molasses. Not so much oak or whiskey as I was expecting.  Tastes incredible. Potent dark and sweet with some booze. Dry roast and coffee with a smoothing chocolate. Whiskey in underneath, both in flavor and in burn. Molasses and fig. A tough ofblack patent sour. Actually, probably alot of sour, but the other flavors are so intense the sour is buried. Thank goodness for the dry finish with cleansing alcohol, because if the thick mouthfeel was able to set the liquid on the tongue it might come across asoverly sweet. Modestly carbonated and forms a fine carb sting on the flat of my tongue. Wet sweet espresso in the aftertaste keeps my mind on the flavors thathave just graced my palette.

1199,19960,bditty187,4.47,"Its not often a Top 15 Best of BA beer is given to me (or loosely traded for). This beer has stared at me too long. It is time to pop it...  Really dark brown in hue with an infusion of black ink; impressive. I love dark foam; the bubbles were a lovely shade of brunette. At the apex the head was a half finger tall, sadly the bubbles collapsed quickly to a thin, soapy cap. I suppose the lack of head retention can be expected. The subsequent lacing was spotty and not widespread. For some reason I was expecting a dark (thicker looking?) beer. Of course I want better head retention and more lace. What a fucking complainer. Yeah, this beer looks like shit. Christ, how can I really complain about this beers appearance?  The nose is a dead-on match for an iced-mocha espresso with a shot of bourbon! I can clearly detect the regular Breakfast Stout qualities. I looked back at my review for that beer and I noted, The first thing that popped into my mind as I took my first sniff was how much it reminds me of Thunderheads award winning Black Sheep Espresso Stout. I wish I could do a side-by-side sniff test I smell amble roasted coffee notes, dark chocolate, a hint of sweetness and a roasted/acidic finish. That is all true for this version. The bourbon aging is very subtle, especially compared to Goose Islands Bourbon County Stout. Dont get me wrong the bourbon notes are hardly hidden but I was expecting more. Damn you Craft Beer Radio! Moderate-high potency, very complex and chatty I am impressed. It is not the earth shattering event I was expecting but it was awesome nevertheless! It is time I take a sip.  Thunderous palate wow. The bourbon heat is scorching on the throat. Hot. Pain. Pain is good. I think I am getting heartburn. Seriously. It is taking quite a few sips before I can deconstruct any sort of beery aspects. Like the nose I am detecting ample amounts of iced espresso and coffee grounds. Bitter bakers chocolate, some vanilla, a kiss of oak, some dark chocolates, dark berries, chocolate covered cherries, hints of caramel and malted balls. Hell, there is even a slight earthy underbelly. Warm, smoky, alcoholic, sweet finish it is oh so luscious. The palate is very special. However, personally, I think I prefer both the original Breakfast Stout and Goose Island Bourbon County. Can you imagine pouring both those beers into one glass? Holy Shit!  Almost full body, low but natural carbonation, the mouthfeel was almost perfect. It is surely big enough but I found it almost slick and oily. Maybe this is nitpicking. Nevertheless the mouthfeel fits this beer very well. The aftertaste is remarkable, hot and lingering with plenty of maltiness and bourbon. My belly is warm. My brain is soaked. My mouth is worn-out (but in a very good way!).  Powerful. Complex. Alcoholic. And yet it is damn drinkable. This is yet another amazing beer from Founders. Michigan is golden for great beer. While I might prefer Breakfast Stout I am very, very grateful that RedHaze graciously supplied me a bottle of this succulent beer. I hope I can try this again I really like it. But, really, who wouldnt? It is big and beefy but with plenty of complexity and depth. Highly Recommended.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,rajendra82,4.43,"Received from BA orbitalr0x as part of BIF 33, this much anticipated beer came in a stubby bottle with a label design reminiscent of bygone time. When poured, the deep brown opaque body aided by a mocha colored, one finger thick, foamy head was inviting and imposing at the same time. The aroma was heavily laden with dark roasted coffee and freshly hewn oak. I took a half a point off for the smell being a little too acrid, and lacking either the chocolate or dark fruit undertones of other imperial stouts. The taste was naturally coffee driven as well, with the Bourbon barrel aging providing a smoother, and drier feel than was expected in a stout of this strength. The vanilla like oak tannins and the substantial hop and roast grain bitterness came through much clearer towards the end of each sip, before being subdued by the eventual warmth of the peppery ethanol. The mouthfeel was abundantly thick and just a hair short of chewy. The hefty punch of alcoholic strength made this a fine late night digestif, but detracted from the drinkability a little.

1199,19960,deejaydan,3.92,"Pours a midnight black color, minimal head, as expected by the ABV. Aroma is charcoal like, some oaky character there as well. Taste is burnt, with a hint of high alcohol. Taste is good, a touch astringant from the oak, but that's to be expected. Kind of puckering. Charcoal again on the taste. Mouthfeel is good, but thin, probably the bourbon coming through. Drinkability is okay, but this isn't my favorite barrel aged beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Gaisgeil,4.32,"It's been a while since a beer with such hype really lived up to it in my mind, but this one certainly does! I love the bourbon touch to this brew, some beers that try this stray too far from beer territory and are closer to just basically tasting like bourbon themselves, this one balances things nicely. Pours a deep dark black, viscous and marvelous. No real head to speak of but a thin medium brown crown formed a few seconds after finishing the pour. Nose is roast, wood, cocoa, vanilla and of course, bourbon. Taste follows suit but with a nice milky consistancy as well. Impeccible balance, well done! Beautiful!  Slàinte!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,merlin48,4.5,"Served slightly chilled into a Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale snifter. Pours a viscous, ebony body, very opaque. A small cocoa head slowly arises and quickly falls into a garnet hued ring that lasts the distance. Delicate specks of lace compliment the garnet rings. Aroma opens with a profound note of chocolate, followed by earthy oak wood, premium bourbon, and some powerful coffee aromas. The coffee notes are of fresh roasted and unroasted beans like you'd find in a good coffee shop. Very robust! Vanilla and fresh cut sawdust complete the nose. Mouthfeel is medium full, the carbonation soft and subdued. Some alcohol burn is present here. The dark roasted malts make their presence known here, with some assertive bitterness. Taste is complex, like the aroma. Chocolate and coffee dominate the flavors. Chocolate is more prominent than expected, but the coffee beans are the real highlight here. Bourbon is easily noted, but is more muted than expected. A bitter, fresh roasted, coffee bean presence comes to dominate as it reaches room temperature. A hint of figs and smoke adds to the complexity. This one is worthy of its hype, a true masterpiece that is an ultimate sipper.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,GCBrewingCo,4.37,"The beer poured into the glass black with a brownish black low head which formed slowly and fell slowly to lace the glass.  The aroma was coffee with a strong expresso influence. The aroma contained wafts of bourbon, but not overpowering, much more subdued in nature. The alcohol was present and with the roasty character almost led to a spicy conclusion. Coffee and roast still rule the day with some caramel and bourbon thrown in for good measure.  The flavor was complex and smooth with chocolate and coffee melded together with a strong expresso character and bourbon. The bourbon was mellow and smooth with chocolate and caramel and some vanilla. Some dark fruits were present at lower levels, raisins and cherries, but the emphasis was certainly on chocolate, coffee and bourbon. As the beer warmed the bourbon gave the beer a muted smoky character.  The finish was dry with a lasting bit of bourbon, chocolate and coffee well into the aftertaste and beyond. The body was full, but not viscous with a low carbonation level. Alcohol was prevalent all through the aroma, flavor and especially in the warming that occurred after consumption. A luscious and well achieved brew!  12 ounce bottle, thanks AKSmokedPorter (justcas I will get to the bottle you sent me soon enough!)!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Mitchster,4.25,"$4.39 for a single @ Jack's. I had to try a single before deciding if I needed more at this price. This brew literally pours out to a glossy piano black. The stream of beer is so dark, it shines like the CGI ""Black Oil"" from X-files, forming a super thick creamy dark brown head akin to espresso crema. The head is creamy and whipped like meringue, something not easily found in a bottled product, but the mild tempered carbonation helps out in this respect. Retention is excellent as are the solid sheets of lace. The aroma is thick and huge, starting with caramel-sweet bourbon, coffee grounds acidified by modest amounts of green oily hops and a ton of freshly ground vanilla bean. Dark chocolate and the faint suggestion of smoke are evident with swirling. Has a ""cool"" smell, like it actually cools off the nostrils. As it warms, alcohol warms the nostrils and the bourbon flavors really pop out. Cleanly fermented with no off-aromas. The mouthfeel is oh-so-pillowy-soft, like 1/2 & 1/2. Dense, oily huge sticky body. The taste begins with an interesting coffee acidity which is okay, but I would have used a lower acidity coffee in here...it throws the sweetness and balance out of whack. There is a modest woodsy whisky flavor (which I appreciate more that I'm starting to develop a taste for scotch) in the middle, but it's most evident in the super-long finish, imparting a sweetness to the back of the throat like a mild licorice. Anise, dark molasses, and vanilla open up in the middle. Bitterness is mild yet very herbal in nature. Towards the end of the swallow, and particularly as it warms up, the alcohol takes on an isopropyl nature and becomes quite evident. Despite how complex this is, I think it tastes much better cold as it shows some flaws as it warms up.  Despite my recent ability to fully appreciate Scotch, I would rather have the Imperial stout over this (Founder's brews a truly world-class Impy, IMO). One bottle is like an entire meal. If you really want to taste the bourbon in this, let it warm up to ~58F.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,raverjames,4.92,"I have rated this higher than most beers, as it is an exceptional brew that doesn't dissapoint. I have had three bottles so far to enjoy, and have a 4th sitting with my vintage beers. Served in a Brandy Snifter A: I don't know really what to say about the appearance. I would have given it a 5 in this category, but there isnt much to see. It pours thick and black, with a head that looks like frothing coffee. The carbonation is pretty hard to see due to the thickness. S: Coffee and a bit of malt. There is a hint of chocolate as well. And when I say coffee, I mean fresh roasted coffee beans. It is a wonderful aroma. T: Heaven in a bottle. Tastes of coffee, malt, roasted hops, chocolate, maybe even a little smokey. Has a hint of oak and bourbon as well. It is very sweet for being so dark and thick. I will never get tired of that flavor. M: Thick. It isnt too bad if you are used to Porters or Stouts. I dont think a Pilsner lover would enjoy as much. D: Excellent drinkability. As soon as I finish one, I wanted another. It is high in alcohol, but you cant really tell. The thickness may be the only thing that could hurt drinkability, but I dont mind that.  This was purchased for $6 a bottle at Binny's in Glen Ellynn, IL (best store in the world). I would have missed it completely if one of the guys I speak with there all the time hadn't pointed it out. The label didnt stick out to me at first. This is one of my favorite beers, and it is hard to get. Binny's is completely out.

1199,19960,bennetj17,4.47,"Thick black pour, beautiful dark tan crust, with a fair lace. Intense aroma of fresh coffee grounds, much like the original, but with an added hint of the bourbon sweetness and light chocolate in the background. The alcohol is not very detectable. The taste is not as overpowering as I expected. Smokey coffee blended with bourbon ending with a moderate bitter finish. Alcohol appears more strongly now but doesn't detract. The mouthfeel is semi-thick, with nice subtle carbonation. There is an intense smoothness present likely due to the barrel aging. Drinkability is good. I would love to have access to this beer anytime, although I think one per sitting would be recommended.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,skomahon,4.92,"I had this at the Publick House in Brookline earlier this week, and was surprised to see it after hearing about this beer online. What a wonderful surprise--probably my new favorite stout. Served in a large wine glass, dark black in color with a small amount of brown head.  The smell of this beer is the first thing you notice--really wonderful, strong coffee scent. Taste is rich, complex with coffee flavors dominant, but also chocolate and others present. The alcohol flavor is actually quite mild given the high ABV, with a beautiful combination of rich flavor and light mouthfeel. Very highly recommended, and deserving of its place in the Beer advocate top 10. I would only put 1 or 2 other stouts in its camp.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Pours a deep dark black with no light passing thru...a 1/4 finger of cocoa colored head sits there for a few minutes and leaves behind some decent lacing. Huge coffee profile in the nose...like the most freshest Breakfast stout you could possibly imagine. Deep roast espresso, liquor, not much oak hitting me at this point. Yeah...no mistaking this one for the regular Breakfast Stout...immense coffee with a beautiful blend of vanilla, oak, and bourbon...gets better with each sip honestly. The malt sweetness is divine and masks the alcohol very well...it does warm you up quickly though. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy...carbonation low and great for this brew. Definitely a sipper, but I would never get bored of this flavor...simply divine.

Presented from the tap in a big oversized wine glass with about a half pour. The beer was a jet black color with slight ruby near the edges. A thin sliver of tan head sat atop the beer and quickly faded. No signs of carbonation (as expected) and served at a significantly warmer temp. than most beer (as expected).  The nose was full of bourbon aromas and semi-sweet roasted malt. The alcohol came with traces of whiskey in it and chocolate undertone pervaded the nose.  The innitial taste is a slight searing of alcohol mixed with chocolate and roasted malt. Subtle bitterness to each sip and the bourbon flavor is quite pronounced. Robust to the finish with a hearty alcoholic presence throughout the sample.  Medium-heavy body with almost no carbonation. A sipping beer all the way.  KBS is extremely drinkable and perfect to sip and savor from a snifer as one would a fine whiskey. I found the bourbon flavors pronounced, but still not quite as much as they were at the EFB.

1199,19960,karst,4.9,"From my trip to Michigan.  Fine bubbles create a low golden brown head with fine lace from a persistant ring over solid dark body reminescent of Dark Lord. Fine beading from the stem of the Duvel glass creates a small cap not reaching the outer ring after an easy pour.  Outstanding aroma - first of coffee (double crack expresso roasted) At 50°F the bourbon oak barrel aroma and flavor hold back - arriving with the second taste.  Mouthfeel is chewy and a nearly full body with help of good level of carbonation. I sensed a slight lactose flavor at the end ( but only at initial few tastes). Start is tangy with a middle that is full of complex flavors and that excellent mouthfeel with a finish that is clean with help of the alcohol, IBUs which are mostly covered by the dark roasted malt bitterness. Any early hints of lactose are quickly burried in the roasted malt complexity. Dark fruit (dates) reveal their flavors.  Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout is comparable to the finest Russian Imperial Stout with its mouth tingling unique tastes.  After clearing my palate and with further warming in upper 50s and lower 60s:  Aroma is like poking you head inside a Kentucky bourbon barrel with the alcohol strong enough to burn the eyes but miraclously staying mostly hidden to taste! Amazing how this stout evolves with warmth. Bourbon taste is reserved compared to the now dominate bourbon aroma. I would have loved to talked to the brewmaster at Grand Rapids. Michigan is truely blessed!  Flavors softon with the loss of CO2 - no longer show the initial fruity tangyness and the body thins as expected. At 10% abv this is a Kentucky ass kicker typical of a few shots of bourbon. Dark chocolate flavor strengthens. Coffee returns to nose.  The last spoonful sets at the bottom of the Duvel glass - a swirl coats the sides with a used motor oil before sliding back to the bottom as a dark opaque pool that still emits an awesome aroma similar to the first pour.  Only my respect for alcohol prevents my opening a second bottle. Looking forward to seeing how this cellars.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Bumpon10s,4.57,"A - It's black, but hued brown. No head really, and a razors edge of lace.  S - A wonderful smell of coffee and chocolate with just a touch of the bourbon. Sweet and slightly roasty, a sweeter than sometimes normal stout.  T - Opposite of smell, roasty with a small bit of chocolate. I've kept hearing that the bourbon flavor adds to and doesn't dominate, and I do agree. It nestles and back and complements it with the alcohol warming nicely.  M - Again, the nice alcohol warm with the added bourbon. Not too thick at all, in fact, one of the thinner stouts you'll have, especially being a double.  D - Fairly good, but leaves an odd taste in the mouth, a little from the alcohol and a little from the roast. At 10% it isn't a total killer either.

1199,19960,goodbyeohio,4.35,"thanks muchly to don for breaking up his horded supply for little old impoverished me.  this beer moves thin and settles dark with glowing yellow separated edges, like a pool of squid ink on a layer of olive oil. lacing is very serious.. a tilt of the glass leaves a perfect ring stuck to the glass. sticky sweet thickness proves its fluidity deceiving. fizzy top post-pour disappears quick and leaves a brew that looks like, well, breakfast (coffee).  ...and it smells like coffee. like fresh-ground oily bean grits. nasal bitterness of the java is cut by a medium-grade candy vanilla bourbon character.. subtly and carefully imparted into the beer as not to overwhelm. applaudable restraint.  ..until you taste it. stronger bourbon grasps on to a tiramisu coffee sweetness and a sugary black licorice note in the aftertaste. caramel exists too. very deep and complex. not too much of any flavor (maybe bourbon for some who don't dig it) and surprisingly well balanced for a huge barrel-aged stout.  drinkability and mouthfeel suffer a bit with a distinctly separate alcohol ingredient.. the abv is not smoothly integrated into the overall drinking experience. something here reminds me of an irish car bomb.  tasty. translates well into the bottle. a real winner from founders. age might help this one too... we'll see.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,UncleFlip,4.77,"Many thanks to murrayswine for slicing this bottle my way durng the pre-sale par-tay at Dark Lord Day!  Pours like used motor oil. A not-quite-thin dark tan head pops up quickly, and is very even. Retention is not the best. Held to the light, the blackness gives way to a brownish-ruby aura at the edges. This is the right relationship.  The smell is lovely- like very dark roast coffee right up front. Under that, you can find a bit of dark chocolate, dates, black cherry, hops,and of course, a strong bourbon. It's like spendng a day at Starbucks, with a shoulder flask that's not quite closed...while munching on bourbon balls. ;)  The flavour is similar to the smell, but not quite as fruity and round until the very end. Right off the top, it's coffee again, but spicy and woody. The bourbon hits in the middle, and then the fruity notes come in on the finish. The woodiness seems to stay put throughout. VERY nice.  Slightly more active carbonation than I like in an impy...and the liquid is slightly thinnner and oilier on the toungue than expected.  Drinkable? Oh yeah. But if I gave in to this temptation for more than a couple of bottles, I'd have enough bottled stupid for the entire Prussian infantry- whch by morning, may walk across my tongue in its socks...

The mouthfeel is thick and coating... chewy certainly. To call this a ""big beer"" is an understatement. Burnt malt and expresso coffee on the front. The bourbon flavor makes an enormous impact midway. Vanilla and oak follow. Things finish with a linger alchohol and vinous taste. There's no disguising the 10% abv here.  Equally good, in a different way from the regular breakfast stout. The coffee flavor isn't as apparent, but the bourbon really shines in this example.

1199,19960,BEERchitect,4.84,"KBS is as complete of an assault on the tastebuds, as much so as any beer I've had. In many ways, the complexity of roast, espresso, malted milk, and cocoa-rich chocolates is overwhelming, but in others it's beautiful in its simplicity.  The beer opens with a creamy and viscous pour. A mousse-like head forms on at the top of the glass as the opaque black beer settles and cascades while the foam rises. The head reliquishes some over the 11.2% abv. Only nitro-infused beers look better.  Extremely bold aromas of espresso, cocoa beans, and roasted barley take hold of the nose. But their intensity is unmistakable. Strong alcohol scent rises as the beer warms and stimulates the olfactory senses. Simple yet pure.  Flavors take over where the aroma ends. Extreme flavors of espresso, cocoa, and roasted barley set the tone. Malt sweetness takes a far backseat while fully attenuated malt flavor gives just enough of a foundation to support the robust complementary flavors. A subtle grassy, piney hop flavor begins to rise after I become acclimated to the cocoa-coffee attack. Esters and phenolic spice are also left behind, not to muddle the pure Stout flavors. Again, the alcohol flavors are evident and gives a bit more complexity to the taste.  The mouthfeel is stupid-crazy. Creamy, rich, and round while also smooth, velvety, and somewhat powdery. Bitterness arrives from a lot of angles: hops, espersso, cocoa, and alcohol. Never cloying, the beer has attenuated extremely well for a malty-rich texture and no residual sweetness left to the mouth.  Interestingly, this whole review has gone without the mention of the bourbon barrel aging. The barrels have taken the rough edges off of the base beer, as oak aging usually does, but the direct bourbon influence is not that apparent. The added alcohol adds a hint of cherry flavored alcohol (maybe a bit of cough syrup) and only a hint of boozy bourbons. Too light on the caramels, vanillans, and simple oak flavor to mention above the intensity of coffee and cocoa.  The beer is complex in its sheer proportions of relatively few dominant flavors, yet simple in its intent. Coffee- Cocoa- Malt- Hops. And it succeeds at every faucet. It has earned its way onto the worlds greatest beers and rightfully so.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The smell is full of roasted malt and coffee, that's it. Smells like a big ol' pot of joe, fresh roasted. Such a huge aroma! The taste is also full of coffee, actually almost tastes more like a spiked coffee than a beer. If it wasn't for the roasted malt present, I probably wouldn't know the difference.

Aging seems to mellow out the aromas.  T: Coffee flavor floods the tongue and is followed by a wave of dark chocolate and hints of bourbon and oak. Hops sneak around like a thief in the night to balance the beer. Coffee in the finish and aftertaste with sweet memories sticking around.  M: Creamy and thick mouthfeel.  D: Dont taste the alcohol, but can feel it is there. Easy and fun to drink, but it is 10%.  Notes: After a side-by-side tasting, I prefer the regular BS.

1199,19960,mattcrill,3.81,"Thanks go to cmaruschak for the chance to sample this one.  Aroma: Straight up bourbon to start with. Not a good sign. Where is the stout? A touch of wet paper, alcohol, a bit of vanilla oak, and oh yeah...there it is...a touch of chocolate malt peeks through as this warms up. Still, the aroma is a bit intimidating.  Appearance: Dark black fading to chocolate edging. A tight tan cap with nice lacing. The head retention is very impressive.  Flavor: Thankfully, much better than the aroma. Strong on the bourbon but chocolate and roasted malts manage to give a good fight. Warming alcohol presence and a milk chocolate sweetness that gives way through the session.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and low carbonation. Coats the throat on the way down.  Overall impression: By far one of the best barrel-aged stouts out there. That being said, most of them stink. I can't imagine having more than one of these and thankfully, I split the 12oz. bottle. You should definitely give this a try as it's one of the better examples out there. Still, it would be nice to have one that's more balanced between the stout and the bourbon. If Founder's beers aged better, I would say stick this one away for a couple years.

1199,19960,DaPeculierDane,4.35,"I was initially offended that someone had dared to ruin Breakfast Stout by adding bourbon flavors. I am NOT a fan of this wretched trend to put every good beer into a Bourbon Barrel just to be big and bad ass.  As the Kentucky Breakfast warmed from cellar to room temp and as my taste buds adjusted, I stopped minding. I took about an hour and a half to drink my first bottle, which I feel was a wise call because the spectrum of flavors changed drastically over that time period. What was at first strong, harsh, and bourbony became smooth, creamy, and complex. Notes of oak and vanilla became more pronounced and wonderful flavors and aromas of chocolate and coffee appeared and then grew stronger. Finally a bit of chicory, coconut, and maybe sassafras (I dont remember what sassafras tastes like but I feel like its in here) enter into the picture. The bourbon mellows drastically as KBS warms and loses its modest carbonation.  Mouthfeel, once warm, is a splendid rich, full bodied lusciousness. Finish is slightly bitter with a mild alcohol burn. Strength is very apparent. Im buzzed after just one bottle.  Im impressed. A case of this might turn me into a Bourbon Barrel convert. Drinkability isnt all there but the appearance, which I have neglected to touch on is great. Pours like crude with minimal brown, splotchy lacing and cream trails.

Dark tan head rises from nothing to a finger-thin level, then slowly fades. Some lacing of the glass with sticky globules.  Good golly does this smell wonderful! My nose was assualted by a myriad of aromas: freshly ground coffee beans, dark chocolate, initially subdued notes of bourbon and a toffee/char scent. As it warmed, the bourbony notes took center stage.  Up front, the flavors are dominated by a sweet choco-coffee combination. The bourbony notes flare up, especially as it warms, mixing with the chocolate. Near the end, some bitterness creeps in, along with some vanilla extract and a hint of ABV. I should note that I still am not a huge fan of bourbon-aged beers, but this was tame enough in the bourbon department to add a very flavorful and well-balanced component to an already fantastic beer.  Not a full-bodied or thick as the regular breakfast stout. Still, I had no problems finishing this one.

I think Indiana only got like 3 cases of this stuff, so I feel very priveleged to have acquired a 4-pack.  Fitting to form, this beer was consumed outside and before noon...  Oil black in color, KBS' brown-cowhide head slowly reverse cascades nearly as beautifully as the conventional Breakfast Stout.  Nose is full of cold-pressed coffee, traces of bourbon heat, and a gigantic roasted malt / hop interplay. You can smell this one from a yard or two away from the freshly-cracked bottle. Chocolate and vanilla swirl iced cream is also suggested.  Taste is wickedly complex...and odd. I've sampled a few bottles and I have to say that the bourbon-levels vary from bottle to bottle. Taste is initially akin to iced mocha leading towards a harrowing coffee/bourbon crescendo. Vanilla. Oak. Coffee ground flavor gets a little overwhelming at times.  Lingering on the tongue is an odd combination of coffee, bourbon, and creamy-roasted malts.  Comes on so smoothly you are want to forget how strong this is. Goes from nothing to super-intense in no time. I would have liked a few more RIS characteristics to sort of balance things out, but still...this is a one-of-a-kind beer that should be sampled to be believed. Amazing lingering oils stick with you hours after you've finished this beer (or gone back to sleep).  Founder's is one hell of a brewery.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,OStrungT,4.84,"I got this beer from MABZ as part of the 2006 Great Race BIF. I am sure it will be wonderful.  This beer pours jet black with no light making its way through. It has a very small brown head that fades very quick, leaving a surprizingly large amount of laces.  Wow. This beer smells woody. It has a smoky aroma. It also has a strong coffee aroma. I can setect a subtle chocolate scent also. I think I might be smelling an aroma almost like kaluah also.  This beer tastes strongly like coffee. It also has a slight smokey taste. Mild chocolate flavor is also present. As with the aroma, I taste a slight kaluah flavor to it. All I can say about the flavor is wow.  This beer is low in carbonation. It is quite smooth. I leaves a coffee aftertaste on the palate. It is very full bodied.  I think this beer would make an excelent session beer. The only problem is that it is a little high in alcohol. Beware when drinking, or else you might be in over your head.  I cant thank you enough MABZ for parting with such a great beer. I dont know if I would have been able to do the same.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,cameraman,4.62,"Pours really thick into a pint glass. The color is black, almost totally black with hints of light appearing on the edges. A small tan head forms that slowly laces down. The aroma is in a word, WOW! Coffee and chocolate blended with scents of bourbon, lets just say I like it alot. The taste is just as impressive, the coffee and chocolate malt hit the palate, then the boubon comes in with caramel and vanilla flavors. In the mouth it is thick and syrupy, coating the palate, the leaving that warm feeling of in the back of the throat that bourbon has. This is a very impressive beer, drink slowly, these flavors are meant to be enjoyed gradually. It is nice to see a beer getting intense flavor from something other than hops, not that there is anything wrong with that.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,nflmvp,4.38,"Poured very aggressively into a snifter, leaving a thick, one finger dark creamy head. Dispated within a couple of minutes leaving a light creamy foam. It was so dark as to be nearly jet black but just a touch of light shows through the outside edges.  Smell is that of cocoa, coffee, caramel and marshmallow. Taste is sweet but not too sweet. Coffee pokes through in a big way but the finish is lightly alcoholic. Surprisingly light considering the ABV. Mouthfeel is thick and coating and again, it seems VERY creamy. Other than the coffee taste, this has many similarities to cream soda...sweet, smooth and creamy.  Drinkability is VERY good. Very well rounded. I'm happy I splurged for a four pack but I'm afraid I can't afford to drink it as much as I might like to, based on the price of $17.99 a four pack.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Golden2wenty1,4.97,"Picked up one of the last singles at Riley's here in Madison. Glad I decided to stop in.  Pour is absolutely black-hole, petroleum, midnight black with a finger and a half of dark cappuccino, rocky head and thick lacing all the way down. Nose is an aromatic explosion of oak, vanilla, bourbon, caramel and coffee. Taste lives up to the smell with a hearty Kentucky-style bourbon kick flanked by hearty notes of oaky vanilla, rich caramel, and a few shots of espresso. Mouthfeel is gooey, chewy and somehow still smooth and creamy. Breakfast Stout's bigger, badder, unbridled brother from down South.

Pours from the clever labeled bottle with an India ink, jet black thick midnight hue topped with a dense yet thin dark brown head cap. There is zero light escaping fom this shadow in a bottle.  Scents were reaching me before I even tried to get a wiff of this. Deep espresso and black coffee bean. Roasted malts and some charcoal burnt wood aroma. Intense scents of carmel and even a touch of liquorice.  First swigs: Drippy chocolate and coffee ice cream. Some bourbon barrel warmth fronts in the flavor, but was not as vivid in the nose. Complex flavors that really awoke the beer and coffee drinker in me. The coffee and bean aspects are so fully pronounced that it is impressive. Full on flavor of baker's chocolate, dryness is only equal to the bitterness!  This isn't just thick. This is sooo thick (how thick is it?) that is slides into the glass. Feel is a tongue massacre coating with nary a prayer for your palate to recover. If 120 is Yin, this is the Yang.  Last swigs: Yeah...It's good. Remeniscent of Peche Mortel. I wish that I had a fridge full of these!  Beer is good. Happy coffee beer for breakfast beering.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Dogbrick,4.33,"Deep black color with a medium brown head that disappears steadily. Thin spotty lacing. Aroma of espresso, caramel and bourbon. Thick and oily with a strong coffee character, as well as roasted malt, oak and dark chocolate flavors. Bourbon/whiskey is there throughout and adds a nice dimension rather than being a distraction as seems to happen sometimes. The finish is bitter with coffee and a light alcohol burn. Enjoyable for sure, although a bit on the pricey side.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ngandhi,3.73,"This would go good with wet scrambled eggs, if it were solid.  The Chernobyl of beers, KBS' burnt toast and burnt marshmallow flavors are almost too difficult to digest. While I've heard some go so far as to pour this over ice cream, I would only do that if I hated ice cream--and myself.  The bitterness of its chocolate and espresso-like foundation is perhaps the most intense darkness I've yet experienced with beer. There is nothing to mitigate it. No surprise sweetness, no sticky molasses, no fruit, no bright hops. It is darkness. It tastes like the color black would taste if black hated itself.  I'm remiss that Founders--perhaps the most consistently impressive brewery I've had a chance to try--covered up so much of its brewing efforts with the most charred oak on the planet, but I don't blame them for taking this chance. It is likely a beer I will appreciate more in the Midwestern fall, especially after its flavors have mellowed and some more of its cocoa richness comes out. It is dense, challenging, and provocative.  ...maybe if we put the ice cream over pancakes, next to some link pork sausage, and Irish soda bread...

I got it home and poured a glass and thought ... man, I wished I bought a case of this stuff. One of the best beers I will every have. A very dark beer with a tan head that doesn't stick around. Wonderful smell and taste. It comes at you in layers of chocolate, coffee, bourbon, a little oak and a little vanilla. Nothing overpowers anything. A very well made beer, and at 10%, an easy one to drink. If you can get your hands on this beer buy as much as you can. If you don't like it...

At first it comes off like a cold espresso , bitter dark chocolate. The hops linger , giving the bourbon/malty essence some balance. WOW! This might be my first 5 , but it deserves it.  Moutfeel is thick , carbonation is low. This beers flavor sticks around for awhile.  Drinkability is high , I'm considering one for breakfast.

1199,19960,Brian700,4.6,"This beer pours a dark black with a dark brown head that settles down to a nice ring around my glass.  The smell is of coffee, bourban, chocolate, burnt malt. Unbelievable aroma.  The flavor is very complex. First you get a bit of coffee presence in the front but it is fought off with the bourban nose. The middle is a lot of chocolate and roasted malt. The finish is a mixture of Bourban, chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, and then there is some caramel. All of these flavor mingle so perfectly it's insane. The Breakfast Stout being a great beer has been significantly improved. This is one of the best beers I've tasted in a while.  The mouthfeel is full bodied with medium carbonation. Very creamy with fine carbonation bubbles. You might catch yourself trying to chew this beer with all of the flavor going on.  You might not think of this style beer one that is easy to stomach but it is so well balanced and smooth that it goes down nice and easy.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I recently tried the standard breakfast stout, and was surprised when this beer displayed even more coffee aroma. Lots of coffee, a little bitter chocolate, and a touch of vanilla. The flavor has lots of dark roast coffee, vanilla, a little sherry, light milk chocolate. Very delicious. Smooth, rich mouth feel, no alcohol heat. This is scary drinkable. Awesome beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,hoppymeal,4.42,Beer pours jet black with a reddish brown head that quickly dissipates. Strong roasted malt scents mix with a sweet chocolatey aroma. The first taste brings vanilla followed by roasted coffee beans. The beer is not as thick as one might expect from the flavor and aroma. As the beer warms the vanilla aroma is more evident. This beer has a little more sweet flavor to it than their regular breakfast stout which helps to round out the roasted flavors and also helps to accentuate the vanilla flavor. Very well balanced and highly drinkable.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,meathookjones,4.54,"Pitch black body with a small bubbly brown head. Speckles and strings of lace were left stuck to the glass. Big roasted malt notes with a mix of bourbon boozy notes and some dark chocolate come on strong. Taste start off with some sweet chocolate before the big roasty notes kick in. Bourbon and light woody notes blend in well and dont detract from this as in other bourbon barrel aged stouts I have tried. The finishes is quite warming with some booze and big roasty flavors. Slick on the palette and fairly thick but nothing amazing as it could use a bit more body. Good drinkability as well for such a strong brew. An interesting twist on the Breakfast Stout, I am not sure which one I like more. Both are great.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Zorro,4.9,"12 Oz Bottle sampled through the efforts of justcas and BIF across America.  This is a beer that I was curious about but didn't really try to get because it was in such a limited supply, maybe I should try to get a few other beers like that.  Thick syrupy pour reveals a jet-black beer with a shot lasting brown head.  Smell is Bourbon and sharp strong coffee. The overall aroma is sharp like fresh strong lightly roasted coffee. Every sniff brings more of that wonderful coffee and bourbon aroma with all the subtle scents you would associate with those smells. Bitter chicory, vanilla, caramel, wine, nuts, oak, and slight amount of black pepper are all in there. I could smell this 24/7 and never get tired of it; they should make a cologne that smells like this.  Taste is slightly sweet and full of smooth coffee and bourbon flavor. Quite strong and tasty vanilla flavor with a tasty chocolate and bourbon aftertaste. Smooth and never bitter, this is quite close to sex in a bottle.  Mouthfeel is good but not great.  There are few beers I would drive 500 miles to get and this one of them! Along with Three Floyds Dreadnaught and Pliny the Elder this is a beer that is worth going to extreme measures to get. When I think of Kentucky I think of Bourbon. When I think of Kentucky and breakfast I think of red-eye gravy. This beer does not disappoint on either count.

1199,19960,kmpitz2,4.84,"12 oz bottle, split with my wife. My pour is 10-11 oz. The beer departs the bottle an incredible jet black color. A quarter inch tan head forms and falls to a very thin ring over the top immediately. As far as I can see, the beer is still, with no carbonation bubbling from the bottom. Nose brings an explosion of fresh and sweet coffee, mocha, almost like an iced latte. There is a nice creamy vanilla undertone, reminding me a lot of coffee ice cream. Other than the vanilla, I'm not really getting a lot of the bourbon character in the nose. Flavor brings the same intense coffee flavors as before. Holding some beer in my mouth, and swishing it, exchanging air with my sinuses, I get a lot of oaky and vanilla character from the bourbon. The strong coffee start moves to a caramel and chocolate infused sweetness with a moderate bourbony vanilla finish. Aftertaste is very light moderate hop bitterness, with a very solid sweetness carrying through leaving a nice residual sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, slightly syrupy and with just a kiss of carbonation, but nearly still. Very coating, with very good stay on the tongue. Excellent. There is no hint of the 10% ABV at all in the brew. The bourbon is present, but not dominating, blending with the flavor, not dictating. The Breakfast Stout really shines through this one, while marrying with the barrel aging. Founders wins again. I am glad to have a few more of this beauty.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,orbitalr0x,4.82,"After sampling this beer at various festivals, I'm glad to finally sit down to a bottle of it all to myself. Pours from the stubby brown bottle like an oil spill, thick and black as night, producing a half inch of dark tan creamy foam on top of the brew. Spotty sticky lacing is everywhere. Stellar. As my nose reaches the glass I'm assaulted by lush, rich fresh coffee alongside chunks of dark chocolate. Vanilla, caramel and woody tones peek through as well. The bourbon aroma is well integrated and adds a wonderful twist to the already awesome nose on this beer. Just smells so damn good.  First sip brings a wonderfully rich maltiness teeming with fresh brewed coffee and lushious chocolate. The flavor simply explodes when it hits the tongue. Notes of vanilla, caramel and a touch of nuttiness. Midway through each sip the bourbon flavors roll over the palate along with some underlying woody tones. A superb blend of flavors that come together to create one awesome coffee/chocolate/bourbon stout.  Mouthfeel is rich and chewy, but with a medium body and a certain smoothness. Goes down almost too easy with no evidence of the alcohol, except for the slight warming sensation in the belly. Simply an amazing beer that I would love to have on hand constantly if I could! A good evening sit and sip brew and another winner from Founders.

1199,19960,mikeys01,4.79,"Upon first cracking the bottle, I am greeted with a decadent aroma of dark roasted mocha coffee, nutty sweetness, and just enough hint of bourbon to make you almost drool. Kentucky Breakfast glugs into my glass an utmost dark brown color, topped with a thick dark chocolate colored head, which quickly fades into a dirty mahogany rim and lacing. I can already tell this beer doesnt make any pretenses.  The Kentucky Breakfast definitely takes the game to another level, with an extremely well rounded full body, and almost unbeatable smoothness for a big bad stout like this one. Tasting envelops you in a malty morass of dark roastiness, fine cocoa, rich coffee, and oaty goodness, with a subtle undercurrent of bourbon lingering here and there. Mouthfeel is just tremendous, this really is almost a meal, and oh so drinkable. Alcohol is nigh undetectable and the finish is pleasantly sweet, with bourbon and vanilla lingering.

This brew also features a dark espresso coloured head of foam thta lasts and leaves massive legs/sheets of lacing. Aromas are all roasted malts, espresso, green/acidic hops, bourbon and oak! Taste is more of the same. The espresso notes are fantastic on this beer and the bourbon and oak flavors are well meshed and meld this one together into a fantastic drink! One of the best stouts i've had in the past few months, a real knockout. Mouthfeel is thick, and chewy. Drinkability is almost perfect, the abv and intense flavors top this from being an all 5er in my book though. Still on of the top 10, or top 5 imperial stouts on the market today!

1199,19960,CortexBomb,4.85,"Was thrilled to see this on the shelf at my local Hiller's...  KBS pours out much like its relative, standard Breakfast Stout...opaque black, a tan head, pretty good lacing...basic stout. Smell on this one is very similar to BS as well, chocolate, malts...definite bourbon notes present as well on this one though.  The taste is where the beer comes alive though...basically take coffee and malts, and then inject a healthy bourbon and vanilla aspect from the barrel aging, and then make the aftertaste linger even more solidly with an almost rausch like smoke character. This beer is as smooth as any stout I've ever had, and is certainly the best unique barrel aged stout product that I've ever had. Wonderful.  Mouthfeel...creamy, full...it coats your tastebuds...great stuff. The drinkability, impossible to beat, particularly for a beer this big. A lack of hops, a creamy mouthfeel...for 10% this is exceptionally smooth drinking. This is a beer that I literally buy anytime I see it, either on tap at Founders or on a store shelf.  The bottom line is that Kentucky Breakfast hits the ball absolutely out of the park in terms of both flavour and overall quality. Easily one of the best beers I've ever had.

The nose is of bourbon whiskey, chocolate, molasses, and coffee grounds, and it has a smokey/burnt appeal as well.  It tastes magnificent. Its big on molasses, chocolate, and burnt toast. The bourbon flavor really comes through in the finish. I don't think I could be any more impressed.  The mouth feel is HUGE. Nothing minor or easy about it. This is an extreme beer for the ages. The drinkability is good. Obviously, this isnt one to chug, its a ""sit back n sipp'er"". I dont think I'd get tired of drinking these either. One hell of a beer.

Scent is of burnt coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla and sweet dark fruits. As it warms the bourbon aroma comes alive ever so slightly.  Taste is very complex starting with sweet dark roasted malt and a dark fruit. I get a bourbon/vanilla flavor thereafter with a smokey finish that sticks with me for quite sometime. There is the coffee there throughout also.  Mouthfeel is definately full bodied with just the right amount of carbination. It is velvety smooth almost creamy.  Drinkability is above average for this American Double Stout. Compared to their breakfast stout this is much better.

1199,19960,mcallister,4.9,"This is my second review of this monster. I've let this one decant for 1 hour before trying. The nose is now going to a more pronounced fresh ground coffe, cappacino, with a choclate oat vanilla linger. The nose on this brew is really something else, hard to keep my face out of the glass.  I hate to give a beer a perfect score but I just did. My first review of this brew it scored pretty high but wasn't perfect. After decanting for an hour this beer has opened up tremendously.  The mouth feel is like velvet gliding across the palate. The same gargantuan fresh coffee taste dominates the coffee, vanilla, and choclatey oat. The bourbon taste somewhat subdued adds a real genuine complexity helping the finish linger for over 40 seconds.  Luckily I have 5 more bottles of this gem I will be cellaring for the next year or two. Can't wait to reivew it again in about 6 months.  If you can find this beer snag it up; well worth the $17.99 price tag for the four pack. If you're looking for it I may trade a bottle to a fellow BA'er for something I can't get around here.

Smells of chocolate, french roast, dark malts and bourbon... taste is the same, and pretty well balanced really: not too sweet and just a touch of bitterness. Alcohol is apparent but not harsh in the least. All of the ingredients are very well integrated and represented here, and this is a nice, rich stout that goes down smoothly.

Lacing is very minimal.  The smell is awesome. Vanilla bean, bourbon, wood, cocoa, bold black coffee, hops, and ethanol. Awesome stuff.  The taste is just as exceptional. Not too sweet, not too bitter or roasty, not too boozy, not too coffee flavored. Just a perfect balance.  The body is thick and chewey. Also very creamy with the lack of carbonation. Very good.

1199,19960,granger10,4.75,"I think this actually did live up to my expectations. Pours a jet black color with a nice initial cappucino like head. Small traces of lacing and the head dwindles to a skim layer atop the liquid.  Aroma is quite roasty with bitter chocolate notes and woody underlyings. It doesn't come out and grab you like some other beers but it is quite intense. Maybe my nose is a little stuffed. Only hints of the bourbon and vanilla come out during the smell.  Taste begins with a rich dark chocolate flavor wrapped in some fine roasted espresso. Reminiscent of chocolate covered espresso beans. The coffee is not quite as strong as in the Breakfast Stout but the chocolate/coffe interplay might be better, if that was possible. A milk chocolate creaminess comes forth after the dark chocolate dissolves. Slight traces of oak and vanilla lie underneath the whole way. Them along with the bourbon come out quite strongly in the finish cutting out the espresso sensations. Its all much more flavorful than burning though. The finish has almost a candybar (the good ones, not the cheap crap) flavor with the slightest warming effect going down my tummy. Quite amazing.  Somehow this beer, with all the intense flavors and rich complexities, was quite smooth. The flavors had this connection which created a great interplay all around. The moderate carbonation worked beautifully and the body was nice and thick. This might not have been the most complex beer in the world but I think it was just right and stayed concentrated on the flavors in wanted.  This was also quite drinkable. The alcohol was noticeable but did not detract at all from my enjoyment. Much more of a flavor element than a burning one. 3 bottles were consumed over the course of the night with relative ease. I restrained myself from finishing off my 4 pack. I must go get more.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1199,19960,Skidz,4.95,"Pours out deep, light-absorbing brownish-black and sits dead black in the glass with a good sized deep brown head, fading to a faint skim with tiny lacings forming around the glass.  Smells industriously roasted with scads of charred coffee and deep dark chocolate. Dry wooden tones resonate throughout with tinges of bourbon. Alcohol plumes out like it were an Irish coffee.  Flavor is deafeningly roasty, major clots of dark cocoa flakes and the blackest roast of coffee imaginable. Bourbon takes the lead and dishes out burnt caramel and strong wooden tones matched with bits of smokiness. Finishes mild-moderately bitter with clear and distinct charred malt flavors and the ever-present notes of bourbon.  Get past the romantic allures of the aroma and flavor and you'll find yourself in a near-wonderland of thick and smooth motions of this wet and soppy alternative to motor oil. Fine and mild carbonation, big bold body.  A barrel aged improvement of an already outstanding beer.

Strong aromas of roasted dark chocolate, malts, coffee, whisky. Great. Taste is full bodied and powerful; flavors of coffee, malt, unsweetened dark chocolate, a touch of hops, warming alcohol notes likely from the bourbon ageing. Nice. Mouthfeel was thick and dense; liquid flavor-brick as I like to call it. The finish was warm, and the alcohol had the ever-so-light bite. Not wonderful drinkability, but darn good. Another winner from Founders, even if I do prefer the original Breakfast stout. Recommended nonetheless.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Px2GrafX,4.82,"pours a deep dark black with a 1 inch dark tan head in a snifter glass. poured vigourously to get 1 inch. head drops to a ring quickly, (typical of founders stouts) but it still laces well, and you just don't need it to keep the aroma lingering 'til the end. aroma is very pungent from the snifter with huge roasted malt, wood, coffee, chocolate and alcohol. oh, and yes, strong bourbon aromas. wonderful nose. something different dominates with each sniff. first sip goes through a wide array of flavors. burnt malt with earthy hops, coffee and chocolate. sweet tails off to a strong woody oak and bourbon flavored warming alcohol. this is the only way i can enjoy the flavor of bourbon. :) quite nice. dark chocolate tickles the sides of your tongue while a sweet vanilla lingers on the tip. back of the sip is woody like the lingering effects of having a toothpick in your mouth all night. aftertaste is bitter roasted coffee and a cashew-like bourbon alcohol. delish. mouthfeel is a nice medium-heavy body with light carbonation and a tongue tingling alcohol effect. rolls super smoothly and swallows just as smoothly. drinkability is quite good considering the abv. bourbon by itself makes me wrinkle my nose, but there's no stopping me here. easy drinking, but stop and savor this one. overall, this is a very delicious ADS. i've had several founders breakfast stouts, and maybe i had a bad batch, because this is soooo much better. i can taste resemblences, but this is in a league of it's own. it renews my faith in founders' stouts.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,jj21,4.97,"Hate to give a beer all 5's so I'll nit-pick.  Everything about this beer is dark. Pours syrupy black with dark tan head. Head doesn't last too long but aroma is strong enough to hold. Smells very close to regular Breakfast Stout. Side by side I don't think I could tell the two apart. Taste is also similar, but as it lingers in your mouth and warms, the Bourbon flavor comes out. Not overpowering at all but very smooth. Exceptional beer. Worth the hefty pricetag in my opinion.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ypsifly,4.75,"Undated 12oz twist top stubby with a really cool ""snake oil"" looking label. Purchased at Bello Vino in Ann Arbor and poured into a snifter.  Black with a finger of cocoa that slowly falls and leaves fat rings of lace.  The nose is mostly coffee with a little bit of bourbon, roasted nuts, oak, and chocolate. Very nice.  The mouth is as full as it gets without needing a knife and fork, yet it does not stick or get oily in any way. This is one of if not the thickest beers I've ever had, yet its so damn smooth. The perfect mouth.  The taste has a lot of what the nose promises. Tons of malt with roasted coffee splashed with chocolate syrup and a sweet warming bourbon flavor that brings the barrel it was aged in. My tongue also picks up enough bitterness from the hops to add another layer of complexity. Chocolate powder and malt in the finish that stays on the tongue a long time but never wearing out their welcome.  Solid drinkability until that 10% gets on top of you.  The price for a four pack is a bit steep, but if you can get a single for under $5, go for it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,BigDaddyWil,4.79,"My vote for most anticipated beer of the year. After having a sample at the MIchigan Winter Beer Fest, I just couldn't wait to get my hands on it. First time bottled and a limited number of cases, less than 250. I sure hope Founder's will produce more in the future, so everyone has the opportunity to try this beer. And at $18.00 a four pack, make it more affordable. Enough griping, on to the review. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a snifter glass. Kick ass label, no freshness or batch date.   Inky black in color, with a half inch dark tan head. Fades quickly leaving some spotty lacing, and a oily like residue clinging to the glass. Beautiful aromas of coffee, chocolate, bourbon, wood, and vanilla. Every whiff just seems to get better. The taste mimics the smell, very complex, but oh so yummy. The boubon seems to tame some of chocolate and coffee flavors. Perfectly balanced and not heavy at all. Creamy smooth, and just a suttle hint of 10% abv. Very easy too drink, maybe two or three in one sitting. Worth the wait!!! If you like the Breakfast Stout, your gonna love this!!! Fantastic job!!!! Already looking foward to next years batch!!! Consider yourself lucky, if you can find it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,plaztikjezuz,4,"tasted this at the michigan brewers guild winter beer fest. from my notes i wa served a jet black sample with a nice brown head the aroma was rich with coffee, vanillia, and malt the flavor had a great vanillia, good coffee undertone, malt, with a wounderful chocolate in the finish. the mouthfeel is very full. beer is very drinkable.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,tbone69,4.77,"The Founder's Kentucky Breakfast Stout is an excellent mix of coffee, beer, and bourbon. The initial aroma is reminiscent of the regular Founder's Breakfast Stout, but there is something more to this beer. It pours into the glass in a thick, viscous motion, yet it lacks the overwhelming syrup-like quality that many strong stouts possess. At first taste there are strong hints of coffee which is then complimented by a smooth bourbon aftertaste. This is certainly one of the better coffee stouts that I have sampled, well worth the price per bottle. Founder's has produced yet another exceptional brew.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,sopor,4.72,"Deep crude oil black with golden tan edges supports a small mocha head. A very small slick of film spans the interior of the dark brown ring of foam. Smells of whiskey and chocolate with hints of coffee. Flavor start sweet, almost cloyingly so, of molasses with brandy soaked chocolate covered cherries. Falvors of oak and bourbon accompany the malty chocolatey goodness and compliment it very well! Roast malt and coffee comes on after the bourbon leaving an aftertaste of bitter coffee. Awesomely complex. Body is full and oilly, but not too heavy and thick to have a large impact on drinkability. Carbonation is delicate, and almost ""green"". Wow, good uber-stout. If you like the bourbon-barell aging fad, GET SOME! Very very tasty, so I could drink the hell out of it, right up until that 10% abv knocked me on my ass. Strong both in flavor and alcohol, so it can't score pefectly on drinkability.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,murrayswine,5,"I just got comped this from my distributor. HOOOLLLYYY SHHHIIITTT!!! I know thats annoying and cliche, but damn, this is the best damn beer I've had that I can remember. On the pour it's all motor oil, with a limp head that dies early. I figure Whiskey doesnt have a head when you pour it, so this wont have much either. The smell is huge: coffee, whiskey, dark chocalate, english toffee, and sweet molassis. I'm sure I'm missing something but it's just too big. The taste is strong as hell at first. Like a meaner Breakfast stout, but it mellows and molds to a subtle and complex beer (is beer the right word?). It's got a lot of a whiskey/cognac taste in it, but that serves to temper and smooth out the coffee roast. Without becoming repetitive and long winded...this beer is f-in amazing. BUY IT AT ALL COSTS!!!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Wildman,4.2,"This beer poured pitch black with no light getting through the dark mass. It formed a small dark tan bubbly head that faded fast and left only trace lace. The aroma was of malt, coffee/mocha and anise. The flavor was of malt, coffee, chocolate with a definate hint of burbon in the background. The body is rather light for the style and the finish is slightly dry with a warming affect of the alcohol. Another good beer from Founders.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,nlmartin,4.88,The beer was served slightly chilled in a wide mouthed wine goblet.  Appearance: The beer is blacker than black. The head was at least an inch thick creamed coffee coloration. There was a sheet of thick lacing remaining behind on the glass. Once the glass was empty it had a dark brown black stain on it.  Smell: This beer has a great smell consisting of dark roasted espresso Bourbon combined with chocolate and a hint of woodyness. (This beer is dam near a 5 on smell.)  Taste: This beer has a great multi-layered taste. The beer has a definate irish cream bourbon laced coffee mocha taste. The is fantastically malty and sweet. There is a bit of spicyness that could be from the hops but seems to come from straight up bourbon. The alcohol is loud and boisterous in the taste and adds to the beer.  Mouthfeel: The body of the beer is super plus size. There is even an alcohol type burn like from bourbon. The beer is thick and chewy.  Drinkability: This beer is Founders master piece. This is a very drinkable beer bordering on perfection. I drank one then ran out and bought somemore for later.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Derek,4.42,"I had this at the Michigan Brewers Guild Winter Beer Fest, back-to-back with their usual Breakfast stout!  A: Dark black with a tan head (doesn't really look any different, but you can't really get darker than dark black!)  S: Awesome aroma. In addition to the dark roasted notes, this one has a ton of boozy bourbon!  T: Now that's a full flavoured stout! The bourbon actually helps to balance the roasted assault on your tastebuds. The alcohol is assertive, but not overwhelming. Awesome (pushing a '5').  M: I didn't like the mouthfeel as much as the regular breakfast. This one was a little acidic. The carbonation was a little higher as well.  D: Big, bold & beautiful. Obviously not a session brew.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,Smittysguinness,4.79,"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  I just left the Michigant Winter Beer Festival...5 straight hours of consumption...hammered...  Anyway, this beer is incredible. My wife and I showed up about 12:30...a half hour after it started. Poured deep black with a dark brown head. Lacing was light, bu t stuck around.  Smelled of rich dark chocolate with malty sweetness. My wife even commented that that the malt sweetness was all she smelled.  Tastes of massive burbon...vanilla and oaky sweetness mixed with a normal Founders-style stout, replete with vanilla and harsh dark chocolate. The malt sweetness and hop bitterness is expertly mellowed by the year-long burbon aging. This is a beer for the ages.  Thanks again to the MI Brewers Guild for the massive beer offering. Only in MI will you drink beer with a thousand other people at below-freezing and love it. It snowed, it hailed, it blew cold wind, and we drank on.  I love this beer. They said they'd brew another batch starting now, and it'll be ready this time next year. Get this when you can!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,clvand0,4.5,"From the EBF 2006. I'd been waiting a long time to try this one. Pours a very dark color with a brown head that falls fast and doesn't leave too much lacing on the glass. The aroma smacked me with bourbon and chocolate at first, then as it warmed, the bourbon aroma mellowed. Lots of maltiness and alcohol. The flavor was great. Lots of thick dark malts - chocolate with coffee up front then a bourbon character that sticks to the palate. The body is very thick and the drinkability is pretty good. Try this one if you have the chance.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,yoko,4.8,"This is clearly the most amazing Stout I have ever had. Sampled at the January 2005 EBF, it remains in memory with clarity. Wow! The visual, smell and taste were of extraordinary synergy. A short tan head accented the rich, deep blackness. Superb coffee and chocolate malts warmed and woven with Burbon tempered by oak cask character. Smooth, thick, big, present. The texture, dimension were divine. The burbon drip was endless and with comfort as it warmed ceaslessly. It remains on my palate to this day!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1199,19960,ahking,4.52,"Possibly one of the best stouts I have ever had. I first tried this beer at the Michigan Beer Festival in 2003. This is a strong stout aged in oak casks that were once used to age bourbon. The result is a unique, complex beer that is black as night with a slight tan head. It pours quite thick as you might imagine and in addition to the smoky, chocolate flavors of the malt, you get a hint of a vanilla-oak that comes from aging in the barrels. At around 10 percent ABV, you have to wonder if some bourbon is still remaining in the casks used since you can immediately taste and sense the alcohol. The bourbon flavor is quite evident. A great masterpiece in my opinion, though this is clearly a slow sipping beer not meant for mass consumption.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
