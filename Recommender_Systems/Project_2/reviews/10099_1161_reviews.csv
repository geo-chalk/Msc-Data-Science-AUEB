10099,1161,eameslover,4,"First time I had ever seen this style...Really good! No joke, I could taste a stout, an IPA (not a lot but some distinctive hops) and a good brown ale. Mostly the first and last but it wasn't entirely one if the aforementioned styles. I really enjoyed it",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Peach63,3.99,"Pours copper with a 1/2 inch creamy, tan head. Thick lacing, both lasting right to the end. Heavy carbonation.  Aroma is nutty, malty, slight brown sugar.  Tastes of nuts, brown sugar, roast malts, caramel malts, and coffee. Moderate bitterness.  Full bodied, creamy, fizzy mouthfeel.  A nice brown IPA. Great color and carbonation.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,spectru,3.97,"Very dark brown, translucent, not hazy at all, frothy light tan head, good retention, lacy; The aroma is slightly tangy with a hint of sweetness; Rich full bodied smooth flavor, slightly sweet; Mouthfeel is very smooth, almost thick, moderately carbonated; Tasty, pleasant, a good beer off the beaten path.  The label says Indian Brown Dark IPA, but it really doesn't taste like an IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,travolta,3.38,"Appearance: Very very dark brown, but ruby red up to the light. Off-white to cola head with a bit of spotted lacing and average retention.  Nose: Nutty, coffee and toffee. Lightly roasted coffee beans, brown sugar and some chocolate at the end.  Taste: Creamy but a little bit dry upfront. Not as malty as I assumed it would be. It is slightly dry and a bit like sucking on a lightly toasted coffee bean. Astringent throughout. I get an unpleasant bitterness from the hops. So much so that I switched glasses halfway through to make sure it wasn't my glass. My eyes and my nose wanted this to taste a certain way, but my mouth said otherwise. Mouthfeel is nice, but a tad watery.  Notes: I was excited for this one as Dogfish usually hits it out of the park (in my opinion). I think the hops being added to what should be a bit maltier brew throws this one off. It's a great idea, but doesn't know what it wants to be.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Dr_Gonzo,4.25,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Pours a lovely mahogany/ruby-brown color with a finger-thick tan head with decent retention and lacing. Glows faintly when held to the light.  Nutty notes are upfront in the aroma, along with coffee, toffee, molasses, caramel, hazelnuts, barley, roasted grains, brown sugar, toast, and chocolate. Complex dark aromas and sweet notes.  Dark cocoa, roasted nuts, barley, pine, and brown sugar are upfront on the palette. The rest of the notes follow. Medium-light body feel.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,GuyFawkes,4.25,"Brown hue.  Off-white head; frothy lace.  Nice coffee nose.  Creamy medium mouthfeel.  Creamy coffee & hazelnut flavor.  A delicious, flavorful brown ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,deniro,4.03,"A hybrid of 2 of my favorite beers (IPA and Brown Ale) Also has a scotch ale in there as well, so I had to give it a try . I've heard amazing things about it. Head is a dark red color. Smell some chocolate and caramel and a little fruit as well. Taste definitely was good. Right off the bat you taste some cocoa, a little nutty, and some coffee hints. What shines through is you taste some hops, not West Coast IPA strength or even NE IPA strenght , but just enough to give this a little bite, more so than your typical brown ale. Mouthfeel is light, definitely tastes lighter than it's 7.2 ABV. It's definitely a solid beer, a little slightly overrated in my opinion but definitely solid. If you like Brown Ale's and IPA's it's a must try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,RMehrenberg,3.94,"Reddish-brown with a head. Very Coke-like. Smells of caramel and a little cocoa. Taste is similar with a little bit of hops towards the end. Relaitively mellow for an IPA, but appropriate. Mouth feel is smooth but a little thin. 6 pack worthy",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Jeffrey_Moreland,4.08,Brownish red color with a little head. Smells hoppy with a little earthy hint. Mellow citrus. Tastes the same. Very good carbonation with hoppy citrusy bite. Not a harsh bite though. Mouthfeel is full with a little creaminess. Overall a good balance of ipa and ale.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,spiker97,4.65,"One of my friends, who wasn't a Dogfish fan but loves IPA's, said this was one of the best brews she has had in a good while. Since this is a hybrid brew, it's very accessible not only to IPA lovers but to people who like an ale as well. I have always liked the taste and feel of this brew, and it also makes a good holiday beer for this time of year as well as for warm weather - when you can find it. Definitely a keeper.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,mothmanscott,4.21,"From notes 7/24/12: Pours a very deep brown; garnet hues dance at the edges when held to the light. The pour produces 3 fingers of tan, variously bubbled frothy, lasting head that leaves beautiful webs and rings of lace. Aroma is dark bread, toast, dark fruits, brown sugar, dark cocoa with pine, burnt hints and smoke in a light floral and citrus hop background. Taste is brown sugar, raw, bitter chocolate and dark bread malt; not sweet, burnt, smokey and nicely bitter. Hoppy citrus, pine and herbal throughout the sip but intensifying from the middle through the peppery finish and intensely bittersweet aftertaste that rapidly fades to a lasting bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with moderate carbonation; smooth and easy to drink. May be called a brown ale but this stuff is in a style of its own. 4 stars",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,NedFredHead,4.15,"Pours a clear ruby-brown. Smells malty with molasses in the background. Taste is malty, nutty, slighty sweet, with coffee notes at the front and hops near the end. A solid dark ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,penguinsgoboom,4.5,A: Pours a one finger head. Color is a pomegranate wine. Lacing clings nicely.  S: Rich nutty malt. Chocolate is present. Some grassy hops. Luscious and warms the heart.  T: Dark roasted nuts and malt mixes with bitter herbal hops. Honestly tastes like an Porter mixed with an IPA.  O: My first sample from Dogfish Head and it's a hit. A big brew that delivers on the flavor and maintains balance with mastery. One of the better dark ales.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,lastmango,3.97,"Poured a dark ruby brown with a 2 finger milkshake tan head that dissipated to a thin film for the entire session. Moderate lacing throughout. Malt and slight charcoal aroma. Taste of rich malt and brown sugar with piney hops on the end. Well balanced. Moderate body with light carbonation. Overall, this is a great brown ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,HotDogBikeRide,4.25,"Pale/brown amber, translucent, frothy head with webby lacing. Smell kind of reminds me of smoke and charcoal but sweet and malty too. Not much in the way of hops as far as the nose. The taste remains largely the same, peaty, smokey brown ale with sweet and and sticky feel. Semi-dry. Complimented most lightly by the hoppiness, mostly just in the aftertaste in my opinion. The malty taste is sort of carried through by the hops though I guess it could be described as. Overall a solid beer. Found a couple six packs on sale for $5.00 a pop so I got a steal if you ask me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Dlijoi,4,Not as bitter as most ipas. Can really taste the coffee flavor.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,MoreBeer4me,4.5,"This has become one of my favorite beers and something I always have on hand. I could have given this one a 5.0 based on taste AND price, although I'll stay away from factoring in cost with beer quality. In a nutshell, the mix of a brown ale along with Dogs' IPA brewing talents add up to a winner. If you like good beer...you'll like this. Simple as that.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Mike_Benson,4.05,"one of the first Dogfish Head beers I fell in love with, and made me realize that browns and IPAs could play nicely together. very few people try this, less succeed.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Rogerlb,4.18,"Looks like Dogfish's Indian Brown Ale has added the word ""Dark IPA"" for rebranding. With same descriptors and ABV, I'll assume it's the same.  Anyway, this fella pours like a dark Scotch ale, with a deep brown look with clear amber hints at the edges of the glass. Head is minimal and even.  Aroma is like a porter. Malt, slight caramel and barley. Not getting any hops in the smell.  Their site describes this as a cross between a Scotch ale and a brown. Taste is more various. Tastes initially like a brown ale, with a light, lagery body, with a bit of bad coffee shop coffee. No chocolate. Caramel and a slight bite of hops comes in to suggest an IPA. Maybe I'm just looking at the label too hard. A little over cared. Slight hoppy bitter, some anise and hints of citrus and earth, through to the end. Those are the hops, right?  I'm also getting a feel of roasted barley, seems like it's close to a Guinness, no kidding, of the lightest variety.  But it falls short of a porter or a stout. Looks darker than it drinks. 7.5% ABV is pretty hidden. Ever so slight booziness, akin to how a Scotch or an IPA might feel.  Interesting mix of a brown with some added stuff like brown sugar and hops thrown in. Very drinkable, very well balanced. Interesting beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Mintz82,4,"One of my favorite DFH beers. I enjoy this more than 90 min. I'm not generally a huge IPA fan (will not drink more than 1 at any given time) but this is a pleasant mix of styles. Malts and caramel offset the hops just enough that they balance each other perfectly. No one flavor overpowers another, something I think a lot of brewers miss the mark on. You can taste all of the notes described very easily. Lacing on the glass through the entire beer and a great aroma. 4s all around for an above average beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,nicholas2121,4.43,"Indian Brown Dark IPA brewed by Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, with an ABV of 7.20% This American IPA pours out a deep brown color with a nice off white head. This brew has the look of cola,not saying that is a bad thing. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness. Then sweet earthy roasted grains and malts. There is also a nice sweetness to this brew. Between the look and smell this is one inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with Roasted Hoppy Flavors. Reminds me more of a porter, than an IPA. It is also really hard to pick up on the 7.20% ABV in this American IPA, it is just that smooth. The body of Indian Brown Dark IPA is a solid medium. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. The mouth feel is Bold, Rich, Sweet, Roasted, Smooth, Clean and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Indian Brown Dark IPA a 4.50 out I 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, did a super nice job with this brew. If you are a fan of dark brews you should look this one up.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Nass,4.33,"This remains as one of my favorite Dogfish Head beers to this day. This beer has held up over the years unlike many of their new age experimental craft beers that they make. It's not a heavy & roasty type of brown ale, yet it is not an IPA either. This beer is almost like a style on it's own. I have noticed a few breweries on the east coast have tried to copy this beer over the years. I highly recommend this Brown Ale if you have not already had it. Cheers! B",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Beginner2,3.85,"At 50 IBU, this pushes my comfort level...but I think this crafty combination of styles makes me comfortable. If you accept that Dogfish Head combines three styles, Indian Brown is unique... and pleasantly so.  It certainly Looks like a Brown (or a Scots ale). The Smell also could be either style... except even I detect the hops. Tastes cascade starting with the dark malts balanced by the hops sweetened by the brewers sugar and then, inexplicably, finishes dry. I only give a great crafter this many points for their hoppy beer.  This might be a good ale for hop-heads to appreciate sweet browns.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Brutaltruth,4.11,"From a growler via Jungle JIm's Eastgate in a snifter. This fine ale pours a rich ruby tinged brown with a fantastic head of off white foam that settles to a thick ring, thin light pool, and showcases some nice sudsy lacing. Nose of light cocoa, subtle citrus notes of orange zest, light brown sugars, and light piney hops. Flavors exceed the nose with caramel and brown sugar touched with orange zest and light peach notes touched with bread crust and awash in herbal and light pine tinged hop flavors that balance out the malty characteristic of the ale. Nice mouth feel; medium body, medium light carbonation that is perfect and quaffable for the style, and a lightly hop touched malt finish.  The best parts of two styles in one....NICE.  Cheers",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Handwaver,1.4,"To me, it taste a lot like a stout. I hate stouts. If you like them baby this one’s for you.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,EMV,3.77,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip  L: Dark mahogany brown pour. Clear... 1 finger of white head. Solid rim of lacing.  S: Roast grains and piney hops. Mild cocoa.  T/F: Sweet toasted malts... piney hops... bitterness from both the roast and the hops, balanced by sweet caramel, brown sugar, and cocoa. A bit of espresso mixed in. Light bodied. Well carbonated.. the finish is sweet and roasty.  O: A very solid dark IPA. Great flavors and combination of roast and hops. Drinkable and tasty.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Sable,4.99,"Pours with a decent head that dissipates very quickly. The color is very dark ... Coffee brown. The smell is very caramelly, with maybe a hint of maple. Tasting is where it really shows off ... Burnt sugar, caramel, molasses, more molasses, and a bit of dark chocolate. Should be cloyingly sweet, but it isn't. We're saved by the hops, this is an IPA after all, and that jolt of bitterness brings this into balance. I'm told that dry hopping means adding hops after the fermentation has completed to boost the hop flavor and aroma. It's works and it is brilliant!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,megaman85,4.48,"The name of this beer is definitely confusing, so let me get that out of the way first. Being called a ""Dark IPA"" I had no idea what to expect. I'm not sure there's a better name for it, but if your expecting a typical IPA you may not like this. Regardless, this beer is close to perfection for me! It comes across as a toned-down double IPA... like maybe the 90 minute's little brother, but maltier and heavier than the 60 minute. It has that hop bite and finish, but with the feel and taste of a strong brown ale. It also has some hints of dark fruit like what you'd find in an imperial stout. It's not overdone, and extremely well-balanced. I could easily knock out a few of these in one sitting. Great beer!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,jjamadorphd,4.06,"What a surprise - not at all what i was expecting...  From the brewer I think is one of those that know how to put out an IPA, here's thing they advertise as a dark ale, really a brown ale, and has the muted flavor of an IPA. Speaking of muted - the only thing muted about this beer was it's smell. The scent was a muted blend of caramel and malts, with none of the hoppy background you would expect. The look is dark brown, decent head, and very, very good lacing. Mouthfeel was very full-bodied, definitely carbonated, but still a great smoothness across the tongue. The taste was distinctively malty right out of the bottle, but after it settled in the glass, the hoppy character made itself known and it was also distantly sweet. Overall, I found this to be definitely exceptional.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,BenHoppy,3.72,"Didn't taste much like an IPA but had some hop bitterness in the mix. Came more off as a brown ale with some Belgian character of raisins and chocolate flavoring. Not a bad fall/winter beer. But did not feel or taste like an IPA, just a delicious brown beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,OKbrew89,3.65,"On tap. Gorgeous dark brown with a tan head that lingers. Nose of coffee, roasted malt, and toffee. No hops but great start for an english style brown. Taste follows the nose until the finish. Malt, toffee, and some coffee make up the body before a bitter hopped finish. Medium-full body and medium carbonation with a lingering bitterness. The malt backbone was heavily handedly done on the front and the hops at the end were too strong so the beer was too sweet to start and too bitter on the end. It tried to be malty and hoppy simultaneously. For me, it didn't work as well as the beer's reputation lead me to believe it would and should.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,jkblr,3.91,"12oz bottled 9/29/17 poured into a DFH branded teku glass at fridge temp 7.2% ABV. The beer pours very dark brown with only the slightest red hue if held to light. The head is tan colored and short lived. The aroma is dark chocolate and coffee. The taste is mild roast coffee and dark cocoa that ends with a mildly bitter note. Mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, adequately carbonated and almost entirely dry in the finish. The hop presence is there in taste and feel, but it's impossible for me to single out specific flavors over the malt bill. Overall, very good, very balanced example of the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Profundobaso,4.35,"Look - dark amber, nearly brown, but still transparent under light. nice lacey two finger foam. Smell - coffee, malts, and hops, all at the same time! really quite a complex smell. Taste - this is where this beer really excels. has the bold hoppy flavor of an IPA while still preserving the aroma of the brown ale. a slight bite of booze in the very end. really exceptional. Feel - medium body in terms of mouthfeel, but complex in flavor. refreshing, yet full of flavor at the same time. Overall - this really is quite a beer. i can't help but keeping sipping on it, and it sneaks up on you quick. really great in every way.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,Libeertarian,3.82,"From notes taken 05/03/17:  Very deep garnet color, fairly clear, with spongey brown head of desert mud colored foam. Good retention, a ringed berm of lace, and then a wall of it below. Smells more like a Stout or even a Belgian Dark than most Brown Ales I’ve had, with cocoa, menthol, a little dark fruit. Taste is the same but everything is stronger and with the addition of molasses, and then toffee, the latter especially toward the finish. Hops are soily and strongest in the middle, along side a shot or two of ethanol. Good balance, should satisfy a sweet tooth or a hop head. Full-bodied, syrupy, fine-bubbled, tingly, and creamy, with surprising warmth for not only the style but the ABV as well.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,Czequershuus,4.14,"This beer pours a dark clear ruby brown with an average head. The aroma features dark tones of hazelnut, chocolate, pine, orange peel, coffee, and greens. The flavor leans much more to the malt than the hops, with good medium chocolate, mild coffee, hazelnuts, almonds, and some orange peel, evoking a chocolate orange, and pine, with a really solid bitter core. THe mouthfeel is somewhat full with a light mildly carbonated finish. Overall this is really classy beer - unbalanced for the style, but iconically America in sensibility.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,MaximalC,3.71,"Pours a transparent tawny color with a handsome topping of khaki froth. Unremarkable aroma smells of straight caramel with some peanut brittle.  Balanced taste is delightfully nutty, with caramel and brown sugar adding complexity without dominating. Noble hops lend an even keel to tame the sweetness while remaining understated in their own right. Brown sugar comes through more on the back end with warming. A palpable stickiness lingers on the lips between sips. Medium body and fine, fulsome carbonation afford a vibrant, velvety mouthfeel that deftly cuts through the sweetness.  Overall, this is a robust, balanced brown ale with a great feel. One of the better Dogfish offerings, in my estimation.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Savan,3.77,"Indian Brown IPA poured a delectable hue of deep burgundy with thin lacing of almond coloured head :) The aromas are subtle but, of coffee and almond cream.

10099,1161,Everydayoff,4.05,"355ml bottle poured into a pint glass.  Translucent mahogany brown with an amber shade in color, it tops with a finger of frothy brown head that stands for a while before sinking to some bubble sheet atop and leaving some spotty and patchy lace on the glass-side.  Really nice aroma led by caramel, coffee, roasted, powdery, and toasted bread from malt as well as a sweet addition of brown sugar. Hop is herbal, fruity, and citrus.  The taste has a well-rounded balance between the two proportions of malt and hop. Malt provides its caramel, coffee, roasted, powder, and toasted bread as well as the addition of sweet brown sugar while hop lends its citrus and some herbal bitterness. The bitterness comes from both roasted malt and hop actually.  Medium body with quite smooth mouthfeel and moderate carbonation, the feeling is proper and crisp enough to carry all the things well. Finish is pretty dry.  Good Brown Ale with lots of typical caramel malt character and brown sugar in addition, hop also helps to bring some more depths.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,Lone_Freighter,4.29,"The appearance was a nice dark brown color with a decent one finger white foamy head that dissipates within about a minute and left some light semi - thick lacing in its wake. The smell was awesome as it had a super nice allocation of the Scottish peat - like smokey/roasty malts to the engraving bittersweet citrus hops to delightfully entice my nose to partake in more whiffs to get some light roasty caramel nuttiness about it. The taste replicates the smell pretty much exactly the same. On the palate, this one sits about a medium.

I'm a big fan of Dogfish Head, there hasn't been any brew of theirs that I did not only thoroughly enjoy, but also hound my beer loving friends with recommendations.  All the look and smell of a stout but not the overpowering kick. Stouts are sippers, this dark ale is a comfortable medium between my usual IPA and stouts that I don't really prefer to drink. Two fingers of head, with a scent is of a distinct chocolate, and with somewhat toffee accents. The looks is very dark but up to the light it has a red hue deep within it. This brew has a warming quality going down too. I got a lot of lacing on the glass, for this is clearly what I call a glass washer. No aftertaste other than hints of chocolate that go down nicely.

The color is a dark brown with a medium head that lingers in the glass, The initial taste is somewhat heavy with a very roasty, malty, coffee feel and limited nose. I did not care for the aftertaste which is somewhat harsh and chalky. It gets better with food as you lose the finish. I did not notice the hop element even though it clocks in at 50 IBU.

Smells of malts, burnt sugar, cardamom, and floral hops.

It's pleasant but it ain't no IPA, not anywhere close. Tastes like a stout mixed with an ale. Minimal hops. If you're looking for hops, don't look here. I can absolutely understand the high ratings, but my palate has been corrupted by wonderful hops, so this just doesn't do it for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

It looks super dark brown, bubbly over carbonated head, smells great like coffee and caramel. The taste doesn't live up to the smell. The first few sips are bitter and you can taste the alcohol in it. As you continue to drink it, the bitterness settles down and it;s a bit more enjoyable. However, this is not up there with the likes of an Old Brown Dog.

I was amazed to say the least. This beer is definitely BURSTING with flavor, the coffee note is a strong after taste that complements the body of the beer amazingly, definitely has some floral notes and a quick bitter hoppy punch that quickly recedes, the brown sugar and toffee undertones help this one out and by far this is my favorite beer to date and I HIGHLY recommend!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,cjgiant,4.04,"Bottle dated 8/31: Now listed as a ""dark IPA"" - huh? Pours a mahogany brown, though getting past the darkness you can tell it's likely a clear beer (like many of DFH beers). The head builds up a light brown, and remains in a thick rim around the glass throughout the pour, with continents of thin film across the surface.  Nose has a little more roasted nut and even a little darker malt in it. I actually think I get the brown sugar, and a little bitter hops also comes through.  Taste starts off with a little sweetness to a dark bready malt flavor. The bitterness catches up fairly quickly, though, to bring the flavor back into balance. One of the classic brown ale flavors, a light nuttiness comes in to lean this a little more brown than a darker porter, in my opinion. The woodsy hops actually play nicely here, but do seem to add an American hoppiness to this beer (taste and power).  The beer is a little thin rolling over my tongue, but with the bold flavors, this actually helps keep it fairly easy to drink in more than sips.  I expected to rate this beer decently having had it many years ago and enjoying it. But this beer is even better than I recall. The balance of the brown with a little extra hop notes that don't overtake the beer hits the spot.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Aroma is interesting, English brown malt, some hopping, a fractional amount of smoke/roast/charred matter.  Taste hits more of the brown and scotch ale notes than it does ipa. Even though 50ibu it seems less than that with everything else going on malt wise.  A pretty cool beer even though I probably go years at a time between having one. Its one of the more respectable offerings from DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,911CROFT,3.55,"355ml bottle into a glass tankard. Paid £3.50 for a single.  Pours a shiny, dark-mahogany body that when held to the light displays some crimson tones and allows small amounts of fine carbonation to be observed. A thick, foamy, one-finger in height, light-tan coloured head with excellent retention slowly reduces to a thin cap, leaving plenty of sticky, soapy lace.  The nose is led predominantly by a combination of warm toasted malts and a darker, more heavily roasted profile. Burnt sugars and roasted coffee beans are noticeable underneath, along with some citric hop bitterness towards the back end. Taste roughly follows suit, leading initially with a faintly sweet mixture of toasted malts, brown sugar, molasses, and lightly burnt caramel. Mid palate, hints of tart cranberry and dried dark stone fruit join lingering semi-sweet malts, before roasted bitterness begins to build. Burnt grains, roasted barley, charred espresso, cocoa and dark baking chocolate become much more prominent towards the latter half, combining with assertive citric and pine hop profiles to finish with increasing bitterness. In the mouth a medium body paired with moderately lively carbonation give a feel that starts slick and smooth before quickly drying as roast profiles intensify. After the swallow, bitter, oily grapefruit rinds, pith and resinous pine hop profiles linger momentarily on the palate, while hints of alcohol warmth give the only indication of the otherwise well-hidden 7.2% ABV.  Overall this is a decent beer. Sweet and bitter, malty and hoppy, complex but easy drinking, it starts as the label promises: a hybrid between a Scotch Ale, IPA and American Brown. The beers latter half however is dominated by a roast profile that’s a little too dark, intense and burnt, which ultimately detracts from balance and drinkability.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Pours dark brown with a coffee head. The aroma is great: dark malts, caramel, and brown sugar. Sweet caramel notes dominate the taste with hints of chocolate, molasses, complex toasty maltiness, herbal hops and a pleasant bitter aftertaste. The taste is rich, complex, and wonderful.

Look: Deep dark mahogany brown. A creamy head of fine bubbles that persists to the very end. Lacing for everyone. Smell: A lot like a Scotch Ale. Rich, creamy smell of caramelized sugars, pipe tobacco, and a hint of something floral. Taste: A char tang, somewhat astringent at first.

This really does blend it all- a delicious malty chocolate caramel base with a counterpunch of bitter hops. This is, perhaps, DFH's greatest beer. A crazy experiment, not flashy, but well executed, enjoyable, and appealing to many.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,jcantella,4.06,"Why do we always forget about IBA?  This dry-hopped American brown has been around for more than fifteen years and is one of only five beers on DFH’s current year-round slate, where it’s been a long-time standby. Yet ask a casual fan to name the first DFH brew that comes to mind and it’s rather unlikely “IBA” will pass their lips.  Like many DFH fans, I fear I’ve taken IBA for granted. With an open mind and a fresh palette, I revisited the classic by way of a recent batch.  Poured into a tulip glass from a 12-oz bottle with a 12/30/15 bottled-on date. Allowed to warm out of fridge for about 20 minutes before pouring.  Appearance: Dark brown, with about a 1/2 inch of off-white head that mostly dissipated within a few minutes. Lacing was minimal.  Smell: After pouring, the empty bottle gave off notes of bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, pie crust, and roasted nuts. From the full glass, a slightly herbal bitterness from the hops. As it warmed, I got faint notes of raisin and anise seed.  Taste: Things lead off with a light malt sweetness, followed by a rather assertive two-fold bitterness. Some bitter notes come from the herbal, slightly piney hops, others pounce with the bite of black coffee. It finishes slightly sweet, with a bit of burnt brown sugar. The alcohol lingers, but the bitterness lingers longer.  Mouthfeel: There’s more carbonation on the tongue than you can see in the glass, with a solid body that’s again more complex than its appearance. I don’t know what people are talking about when they say they can’t detect the alcohol here—it’s here.  Notes: Dogfish beers always have a lot going on –the question is whether everybody plays well together. In IBA, we have harmony, an enjoyably complex brown that shows you don’t need to pack a 10+ ABV to work as a sipper.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Right away, fuggle and williamette hops jump at out at me. The proper words used to describe them are ""spicy, earthy, woody"". Not my preferred hops but oh well. They use caramelized sugar so I was expecting the aftertaste to be a bit dry but it was not so. Look was dark, almost like a porter. Bitterness was manageable, didn't stick in the mouth like regular IPA's. Mouthfeel was alright, you kind of get a blast of the earthy-woody hops on the way down. Alright beer, neat concept. Much of the malt character unfortunately gets lost in the bitterness of the hops. I got some dark caramel and crystal malts mostly via smell.

Pretty good head extension and some sparse lacing lingers around the edges of the glass.  Smell - big aroma of coarse grain, some dark fruit, a hint of wood and smoke. A little caramel mixed in for good measure. A very aromatic beer for the style.  Taste - grain flavours, followed by some mild bitterness, slightly earthy hops, a smoked or burnt flavor, and a touch of caramel at the end. Complex and nice complementary profile. The roasted and slightly smokey flavor is the star, which may or may not appeal to everyone.  Mouthfeel - smooth, medium bodied with good carbonation and a fairly dry finish.  Overall - one of the best brown ales out there, it's a hybrid in that the significant hop presence and the woodsy aromas and flavours with the smokey elements gives you a different beer than many browns, but it works very well here.

10099,1161,l_volky,4.35,"Dogfish Head is a brewery that puts out a lot of nonsense that I don't care about. However, they do have some great standards. I say this both in the meaning of the level of quality the Dogfish brewers accept and in the sense of a song that has established and lasting popularity. Their 90 minute IPA and their Palo Santo beer are some great examples of this, but the list wouldn't be complete without the Indian Brown Ale. The name suggests an overzealous and directionless blend of styles but on the contrary the beer itself is exemplary. This beer should pique the interest of IPA lovers just as much as those more inclined to amber and browns. I drank it from the conical pint glass that I poured the 12 oz bottle into.  Look: Beautiful dark brown that inspires images of the other fine brown things in life. Think leather bicycle seats, old and well loved copies of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman, and trees.  Smell: Caramel raisin sweetness blended with a hoppy bouquet of leather samples. The type of adult candy that most children just can't seem to understand with their stupid child minds.  Taste: Here's where the fireworks of this beer are at. Each flavor of the beer's concept (IPA, American Brown, and Scotch Ale) gets a spotlight without overshadowing any other. The piney hops compliment the sweeter candy sides of the scotch ale side keeping the beer mellow throughout. There's some chocolate and dark fruit tastes without the unrelenting sweet and boozy characteristics of a full blown, big scotch ale.  Feel: The beer remains effervescent while being smooth and full feeling. It's just another testament to the brewer's masterful standard for this hybrid.  Overall: Most hybrids suck. Fusion food is bad, hybrid crossover fruits like pluots would be better off thinking for themselves, and beer hybrids often seem like ill attempts for non-creative brewers to sound interesting at whatever shitty dinner parties they go to. This beer is a strong exception to this rule. The standard to which it's held sets a high bar for beers of each style it takes from without sacrificing in any way.

The smell started off with cocoa, bread, caramel and a light earthy and semi-citrusy hoppiness rolling in underneath. The taste was basically the same but with a slight bitter floral hoppy quality in underneath. Breadiness comes back in the aftertaste and roams into a dry semi-citric finish. The mouthfeel was moderately light to medium bodied with an okay sessionable dark feel to it.

Nose is lots of cocoa, dark bread, charred caramel ..... wow, this smells like heaven for a brown ale, and I do not get much hop in the nose, and I don't want much hop, despite the warning on the label and the rep of the brewer for super-hopping. Nose wins. Taste is not the same. I taste a florally-hopped black IPA, where all the cocoa and caramel are completely overwhelmed by puckering floral hops. A bready thickness remains beyond the hop dryness and carries into the finish, reminding me however faintly that I'm still drinking a dark ale. Feel is full and heavy (nice), with too much tingly carb and puckering dryness for what I wish was a strong, mellow brown. Can't win 'em all. Overall, great nose, full body shows it's packed with a great blend of dark and amber malts. For my taste (and I lovelovelove me some hoppy pales), this has too much hop infusion for a good brown. I know DFH was and is in front of the curve on many craft-brew ""things"", and in this case, they pre-figured the black IPA by a decade or so. Still a super-quality offering.

Fantastic head retention and medium lacing in the beginning. Definitely a dark beer, but not opaque. There's a very unique crimson red glow when held up to the light, but otherwise it looks close to a typical Scotch ale but with much better head characteristics.  I get a sweet red apple scent with maybe a very light scent of bitter coffee, and straight malt. Lastly, there are faint and sporadic, but definitely present whiffs of molasses every now and then, which pop out of the glass and smack me in the nose.  This beer is amazingly silky smooth. Medium mouth feel with medium carbonation. Just very smooth and it seems like the beer permeates every area of my entire mouth the instant it touches my lips. It is certainly lip smacking good.  The flavors in this beer are delicious and unique, yet blended so well that not much 'sticks out' so-to-speak. The hops are moderately bitter and slightly spicy, but sort of neutral in flavor. The bitterness definitely lingers on the palette. As this beer warms, the caramel is coming out and there's this almost cinnamon candy like spiciness (but not flavor) about it. Think apple pie cinnamon. I can't help but feel like this beer would be amazing with a fried apple pie.  Over all this beer is on a whole other level, as with many other Dogfish Head beers.

10099,1161,hoptheology,3.98,"Ahhh. Made it to Portland. Served in a Nonic Pint.  Appearance : Pours a colossal, bubbly popcorn colored head that fills most of the glass, which leaves great webs and hills of lace behind as it recedes slowly. The body is Chestnut-Mahogany colored and a little bit of light squeezes some cranberry hues out of it. 60% Opaque. Overall a very nice looking beer.  Smell : Quite a sticky aroma, with sap, caramel, prune, burnt pecan, walnut, roasted malts, a touch of anise and a circumvention of polite hop. A little odd for a brown ale, but a pleasant aroma.  Taste : It's liberally hopped but not over hopped, if that makes sense. Lots of caramel on the finish, with plum and roast malts in the middle...and just like the nose, it's circumvented (and cut up the middle) by spicy dried out hop. Slight alcohol surfaces as the beer warms up and the hop also peeks through quite a bit more, realizing some of the IPA inspiration.  Feel : Medium bodied in a text-book fashion. Mild (although buzzing) carbonation which this beer could benefit from a little more of. It ends with an alcoholic dryness and a slight stickiness. A slight dock because more carbonation could really knock the feel out of the park.  Overall : For $2.16 I feel I got a great beer, and although I probably wouldn't purchase again, I won't discourage anybody else from doing so. This was a departure yet still a great representation of the style. I'm assuming ""Indian"" is where the liberal hop comes in, otherwise it's just an American Brown.

10099,1161,jwhancher,4.07,"Picked up a sixer at the brewpub in Rehoboth yesterday. Bottled on date of 8/24/15. Pours clear ruby Amber with nice persistent off white head. Smells of caramel & brown malts, figs, brown sugar and spicy hops. Malts seem to slightly overwhelm the hops but they compliment each other quite nicely. Tastes like a scotch ale with ample bitterness, a lighter mouthfeel, and great drinkability. Super smooth and a great beer to pair with a variety of foods. Nicely done. A very nice change up to today's standard IPAs. This one was def a trendsetter when it first came out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,Marraybay,3.89,"Actually found/tried this at the beach, when looking for something other than an IPA or a shandy to drink! Interesting beer, which DH pushes as a hybrid Scotch-IP-Brown Ale. The taste really seems to follow suit, with some sweetness, hops, and kick. The sweetness tends to come in at the front and linger, with the finish being pretty boozy. The IPA portion tends to present near the middle--once or twice more than I cared for in all honesty:(not a fan of the style)--but all and all, it remains pretty buried in the mix. Color is a darkish brown, with a decent head development and glass lacing. If there's a critique besides the occasional hop rush, it would be the prevalence of the alcohol in the finish, which to me at least, can come off a little ""raw / harsh"" at times.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Honestly, I would have said this is a porter if I was unaware of the brown ale labeling. I bought this on the recommendation of Wine Enthusiast, and other reviews, and like many Dogfish brews, I was not disappointed.

This one was surprisingly clear!  Smell: Chocolate and caramel and some floral hop notes. It also has a slight smoked malt scent.  Taste: Instant bittering hops upfront that fades into a deep roasted malt flavor with hints of coffee and chocolate. After the bittering hops subside, there is a slight sweet and caramel flavor. The sweetness is short lived and it finishes quite dry. There is a slight fruitiness with flavors of plums and figs.  Feel: Full bodied and decent amount of fizz. There is a slight dry pull on the tongue.  Overall: This is a pretty unique IPA (which I was expecting) that was very dark, rich, and malty. This is something that I would buy again.

Woodsy and herbal hops with some minor tropical notes.  T – Brown sugar and mild caramel. Just a minor chocolate note. Hops are woodsy but also fruity, some bitter grapefruit and darker tropical fruits. A moderate oakiness becomes noticeable on the finish.  M – Moderate to medium-high carbonation with a medium body. Some mild sudsiness. Sweet up front from the extra sugar but bitterness increases through the finish, lingering on the aftertaste.

Great aroma with soft darker malts and a sweet sugary quality that moves to caramel. Nicely complex for style. Smallish and dark head with some lacing. Dark brown with reddish highlights. Again complex, esp. for style. Just enough alcohol to taste and add some complexity. It mingles with the hops nicely as it moves towards soft bittering on the finish. Again soft darker malts that are a bit drying but the sugary sweetness contrasts nicely. Moderately light feel for style, even seeming a bit on the thin side. But it's not a distraction or problem.

S: [4.00] I get coffee initially. Then some whole wheat bread smells.  T: [4.25] Sweet upfront then moves into a really nice malt flavor. The roasty malts are fantastic. I am getting little to no hops - but I am not complaining. The rich roasted malt flavor is great.  M: [4.00] Smooth and creamy feeling with a medium body. Low carbonation and low bitterness.  O: [4.25] Blindfolded I would call this a porter. It has the coffee aroma, it has the great roasted malt flavor... The lable talks a lot about how it is liberally hopped. I am getting no hop bite.

Nice balance of hops on what is no doubt a toasty caramel forward beer. Very easy to drink because it's on the lower ABV end at just over 5%, and carbonation lifts the malts so they aren't too heavy.

10099,1161,hopphead31415,3.76,"My eye spotted this one serendipitously as I meandered down the rows of craft brews and was happy to snag a six pack. It was a tough call though between this one and a variety of other excellent beers such as Ommegang, Founders, and New Belgium. I found a small fridge where they had some 6 packs of this already chilled for me so I grabbed one and headed for the checkout counter. It boasts an 7.2% ABV and 50 IBUs, let’s take a gulp!  Look: This one pours a clear dark cola color with plenty of carbonation trails running up to the surface. The head is medium and about one to two fingers thick with a decent pour and has lingering thick lacing on the glass. The blackness gives way to orange copper hues in light, very beautiful and clear.  Smell: The aroma is thick caramel and oak. I get a strong sense of smoky oaks and toasted butter and brown sugar.  Taste: This beer is a rare and amazing mixture of Scotch Ale, an India Pale Ale and an American Brown which is one of the main reasons I wanted to try it. It really does exhibit the subtle hops of an IPA, the caramel backbone and rich smooth flavor of a Scotch Ale, and the color exhibited by an American Brown. Quite the trio here and well worth a try.  Mouthfeel: This beer drinks so smooth and lacy at first and then the fizzle that comes from the plentiful carbonation makes this one mildly reminiscent of a coca-cola.  Overall: I’d say that this is an excellent beer for anyone to try.

Dark brown in color with a ruby tint. Bubbles are scarce. Has mild aromas of roasted malts, sweet chocolate, and molasses with a hint of raisin and bitter hops. Intial taste is of strong molasses, and mild chocolate and bitter, earthy hop flavors. Mild roasted malt flavors along with a hint of raisin sweetness and ginger (that comes from nowhere) are next to enter the palate as all flavors persist into the aftertaste. Light-bodied, mildly carbonated, smooth, with a crisp finish. This is yet another unique tasting brew from DFH. Definitely not what I expected from an American Brown So, but I loved it.

No real hop aroma. The hops must be hidden under the strong roasted nuttiness. I know this is a brown ale with extra hops so I'll be looking for that in the taste.  Taste is fantastic! Solid classic brown ale flavored of nutty malts and molasses with a bright hoppy dryness that lingers a while on the tung.  Overall maybe the best brown I've had.

Surprisingly clean, highly bitter finish. Slight lingering bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Heavier side of mid-weight. High carbonation, higher than typical for the style, I think. Ever so slight slickness.   Overall: Wow; this is not at all what I expected. This does not really taste like a brown ale; but whatever it is, I like. Too malty to be a black IPA, but too hoppy to be a brown ale, and too light to be a stout. If I'm in a mood for a brown ale, this would not be a go-to.

I picked up a piny presence plus a little cedar bark underneath it.  T: Definite roasted hops bitterness present roughly medium to medium high - it's there though. There is a mild sweetness and even some coffee and dark chocolate notes. It is a very subtle and complex flavor, IMO. The bitterness lasts and stays on the tongue but not in a bad way.  F: Medium body, and mild fizz as far as carbonation.  O: The aromas are nice and interesting, especially for me as it has been a lot of IPA's recently. The flavors are very interesting and are very subtle and complex. The balance in the flavors is deep and has layers to it. They took their time with this one and it shows.

Malty beginning, hints of sweet toffee, soon overwhelmed by a more breadish taste of malt going along with a sligthly sweetened chocolate. Hoppy bitterness brings in even more complexity, goes well along with the upcoming coffee flavor. Kicks in late, gives the malt aromas much time to develop. Bitterness adds a floral taste to the beer, which pairs up well with the malty body which dominates throughout. Coffee aftertaste is very present, staying long on the tongue. Surprisingly it isn’t very bitter, but leaving a smooth dry mouthfeel.  This is a very interesting and enjoyable beer, reminds me somehow of the ""Schumacher 1838er"", while being a little more aggressive on the hops.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Maybe a point darker than cola, it is not transparent... but its close.  Aroma is wonderfully hoppy in the beginning. The more that it warms in the glass, the more the malty aromas stick through.  Oh man, its taste is beautiful. Absolute bliss. The perfect blend of malt character followed by hoppy notes. Some sips I get the hops first and the wonderful roasted malts second, other times it seems to taste the other way around. Either way, this is an excellent balance of the two. Very nicely done.  Exactly medium-bodied. If anyone ever asks me what a medium-bodied beer should be iike, I will show them this one, it is spot-on.

Active carb rises from the bottom, and each quaff leaves a nice foamy ring of lace.  Smell - Roasted malt, brown sugar, light molasses, lite soy sauce, lightly toasted wheat bread, and a light grassiness.  Taste - Begins roasted malts and toast with a dusting of brown sugar, even a hint of dark unsweetened bakers chocolate - this is almost immediately followed with a good dose of grassy and herbal hops, with hints of basil, mint and pine on the back of the tongue. The finish is dried lightly burnt toast, some dried fruit stones, bakers chocolate, and dried brown grass. This is probably the most hops I've tasted in a brown ale.  Mouthfeel - Nearly medium and very smooth, with some slight astringency and dryness at the back. Carb is on the lighter side, with a few light edges at the back of the tongue, but no scrub whatsoever - allowing the hops to ""sink in"" and assert during each quaff.  Overall - A very flavorful brown ale, and very interesting to me, not your typical brown ale with the stronger presence of hops here.

10099,1161,superspak,4.2,"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 10/15/2014. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, molasses, light dark fruit, herbal, grass, light pine, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and moderate earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, molasses, light dark fruit, herbal, grass, pine, and roast/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, herbal, grass, light pine, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome hoppy brown ale style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,FullRW,4.43,"Poured from bottle into pint glass.  L- Brown with a bit of red when held to the light. Perfect head came right to the top of the pint glass.  S- Smells kind of like a porter with a bit of a sweeter brown sugar aroma.  T- It taste like a scotch ale (which I admittedly haven't tried very many of). It really reminds me of the taste of Oskar Blues Old Chubb, except this Dogfish Head tastes a little more hoppy, and a little more sweet, but only just a little.  F- Carbonation is just a tad weak. It seems like they wanted to create the illusion that it has more body by slightly under carbonating it, but this beer is a little to thin to pull this off. If it was carbonated just a tiny bit more it would be perfect.  Overall, this is a very solid beer that I will definitely pick up again.

10099,1161,milwaukee512,4.72,"Another fantastically unique beer from Dogfish Head. Like Namaste or Aprihop, Indian Brown Ale makes a strong case for DFH's ""other"" beers that aren't really as well known as their 60 or 90-minute IPAs, at least not in WI. Like the aforementioned ""other"" beers, Indian Brown Ale is a superior and unique take compared to the standard for it's category. Too hoppy to be a true brown ale, but too malty to be even an English-style IPA. The hops take the edge off of the big coffee and caramel flavors, and this beer feels light for its style.

Massive malt bomb up front, giving off flavors of freshly baked dark bread, roasted chestnuts or walnuts, dark chocolate, and brown sugar-like sweetness, all beautifully balanced with some assertive, but not overpowering hops.

S - Rich smell, like an American brown with chocolate, caramel, and malt but then the hops come with a nice herbal tone, and some citrus character.  T - Definitely done well with the same notes as the smell but more of it all and a distinctness that allows you to realize it is both an American brown and an IPA all wrapped into one delicious package. The caramel, chocolate, nut character sits highest but there is a good amount of hops to give it a great bump in flavor. Don't expect this to be super hoppy but it is hoppier than every other brown I've had.  M - Light-medium mouth-feel with nice balanced finish. Fine carbonation for brown. The sweetness on the front is balanced great with the hop bitterness.  Overall, a very good beer that should probably have it's own style and there should be more of these on the shelves. I would really enjoy an ""imperial"" version of this beer since this one is somewhat lighter than other beers in there roster.

Aroma - Strong roasted malt that is sweet, like caramelized brown sugar and molasses. Much like a scotch ale. Also tons of barley. Smells like a fresh mash.  Taste - Wow! Sweet, nutty, dark homemade bread, carmel, brown sugar, chocolate, and a touch of floral hops at the end, but just enough to notice them.  Feel - Insanely smooth and creamy. A solid medium carbonation that provides a little crisp bite at the end in combination with the hops.  Overall - This is hands down the best brown ale I have ever had. (I am not counting Palo Santo, this is more true to style) It is not a popular style, but I think that even people who don't care much for it would enjoy this one. Another feather in the cap for Dogfish Head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,leantom,4.26,"Easily one of the better brown ales out there. Had it on tap. Here goes:  A: Dark brown with a large head that leaves adequate lacing. Looks nice.  S: Actually quite good. Mild NW hops with a strong malt backbone. Loaded with caramel, toffee and raisins.  T; Very good. Initial taste is one of sweet caramel malt, brown sugar, toffee, some chocolate followed by a smattering of piney hops. Overall, this is a very well-made beer.  F: Excellent. Plenty of carbonation and ample thickness.  O: A very good Brown ale. Will enjoy this one again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Hop bitterness is present, but without the citrus bite. Mouthfeel is frothy and creamy. Overall, this is my favorite brown! Not super drinkable, but not a sipping beer either like some scotch ales or IPAs. Indian Brown strikes a wonderful hop/malt balance and is truly an amazing scotch/IPA/brown combo.

A = Dark brown with hints of mahogany and ruby red, tan head is small and creamy  S = Chocolate, coffee, hints of dark fruits, sweet molasses and earthy hops.  T = Taste follows the aroma with big notes of bittersweet chocolate and coffee, molasses, dark fruits and faint citrus, earthy hops and a lingering spiciness on the back end. Alcohol is virtually unnoticeable.  M = Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated, but not spritzy, although there is a tingling on the tongue upon each new sip.  O = A delicious and complex beer, the earthiness of the hops and bitter chocolate/coffee notes really help cut down the sweetness and bring balance.

10099,1161,Blueowl,4.85,Tried a Dogfish Head Brown Ale at a restaurant last evening. Very dark for a brown ale in my experience. Similar to a stout or porter in appearance. Head development was reasonable and depended on how it was poured. Dissipated quickly. Ah the taste! A touch sweet with just the right amount of bitterness. Alcohol content 7.5% was appropriate for this time of year in my humble opinion. Me like for this time of year.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,Qbdoo,4,"So hoppy for a brown that at first it just seemed weird. But as I adjusted my expectations, and as I let it warm, the beer really grew on me. It's astonishingly dark (I could see the brown only by holding it up to the light) but r gorgeous. Looks more like a scotch ale than a brown. The nose mixes caramel and a bit of citrus and pine.

AROMA: wonderfully balanced: hoppy and citric, with raisin and plum, yet toasted with biscuit... the malts predominate, with a hint of roasted nuts and caramel--intense and robust ... PALATE: thick, creamy, and rather soft in ts carbonation--that classic cola mouth feel; slightly bitter at its end ... TASTE: the aroma sets this beer’s flavor, as dense, blanketed hops give way to unsweetened chocolate and toasted rye bread--a wondrously stout yet drinkable brown, that only hints at the alcohol it wields... OVERALL: what a drink with which to welcome crisp fall nights--strong, stern and warming, yet balanced, complex and highly drinkable...another victory for Sam and the guys at DFH...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Citrus like as well.  Taste- Roasted dark chocolate brings about a sweet richness in the pronounced taste. Caramel is evident as well just as it was in the smell. Towards the end the hops shine, as the bitterness lingers.  Mouthfeel- Medium-heavy in body. Good carbonation.  Overall- A beer that is impressive. Full of taste. The chocolate taste played well with the hoppy bitterness. A great brown all and one to try!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Smell is of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and molasses. Really nice smell to it, I really smells world class.  Taste lets the nose tell the story for it. Really nice sweetness to it with the coffee, and chocolate taking center stage. There is some hop bitterness that comes in in the middle to really balance this one out nicely. The end of the taste is really clean for such a sweet caramely taste at the beginning. The hops really clean it up.  Mouthfeel is really nice with it being really velvety smooth but with enough carbonation to make it really drinkable.  They say this is a mixture of a scotch ale and an IPA and to make it a brown ale. That really tells the tale for me. It is really nice and caramely and sweet but it also has the hop bite that really balances it out well. Another really nice beer from Dog Fish.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,logicalparadox,4,"A: They call this a brown ale, but it pours coffee-black. Nice head to start, with OK retention. The initial sight is one to behold. Head looks creamy and caramel-colored atop a dark, brooding abyss beneath. By the bottom half of my beer, the head was gone with little to no lacing.  S: The nose is full of fresh roasted coffee, brown sugar, dried plums, molasses, big malts, and a hint of... pine. Yes, pine. But just a touch.  T: Coffee, caramel, gingerbread cookies. The brown sugar comes through nicely, with a touch of sweetness, but not cloying. The hops are noticeable, but bitterness is low; leaving the piney-herbaceous notes in focus. The finish is a long dance between espresso, and the grassy-piney. Caramel notes come out to play from time to time, as do the warming esters of the alcohol (but not too much, at 7.2% ABV).  M: Lighter-bodied than the color suggests. Fairly fine carbonation makes for a soft, sturdy mouth-feel that still manages to not come off as heavy or domineering. A big beer in a small package. A hefty contender that has a certain amount of style and grace.  Overall: Hmm. This was a surprise. It's a little of a lot of things. I like it. Not my favorite profile, to be sure, but interesting. Challenging enough to induce contemplation, but quite easy to drink. The bitterness is moderate, a culmination of the interplay hops and roast. I like this and already recommended it to someone looking for something different.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,DanielMB,5,"This is a stunning brew. Just like they say, Dogfish Head has managed to combine the flavors of a brown ale and scotch ale with the hoppiness of an IPA. The appearance is a medium, copper brown with a tan head. The taste is very caramel, with the bite of hops alongside, and the earthy toastiness of a brown ale as well.

Limited fine carbonation across the profile. A great finger-thick head pops up and drops to a creamy half-finger with excellent, thick lacing.  Aroma: quite a demure aroma, but what is there is roasted sweet malts and brown sugars.  Taste: roasted malts and nuts up front with some earth, woody resin and a pleasant earth bitterness. Quite nice, and some tartness.  Aftertaste: roasted coffee and bitterness comes through even more strongly in the aftertaste. Very nice.  Mouth feel: quite full in body with a sharp but not over-powering fine carbonation. Fantastic.  Overall: this would have to be hands down one of the best brown ales I have ever had. Dogfish Head has only recently come into my life, but I have to say I am quite taken with them. Very, very likeable, even though it is AU$120 a case of 24 x 355mL bottles.

S - Roast malt comes through in coffee and toasted multigrain bread, with a hint of grass.  T - The start is pretty typical brown ale, following the malts and roast of the nose, suggesting coffee and rich, delicious breads. The middle brings some of the sweetness, but this fades quickly to a slight but notable hop bitterness.  M - Fresh, bright, and lush, with subtle carbonation. There is some drying, but it does not grow too heavy.  O - A brown ale that suggests black IPAs with its hopping, but keeps true enough to its style to satisfy my brown ale itch.

Liquorice comes out strongly along with a slight hint of kirsch. Herbal rosemary-laced hop characters, but mostly it's spicy, sweet notes that makes it up. Malt is on the toasty end of things with a hint of brown sugar. It's certainly interesting.  Taste is lighter, but still rather spicy on the front- and mid-palate. Liquorice is still strong, with a fresher anise character to it, underpinned by some toasty malt. Only towards the back do we get some bitterness. Finish has overtones of molasses.

Comes with a one finger tan head, very good retention, splotches of lacing.  Smell- This honestly smells more like a porter than a typical sweet brown ale. Earthy and sort of herbal, roast malts, dominant caramel and toffee, brown sugar sweetness. Hint of coffee beans. Pretty pungent stuff.  Flavour- Caramel, toffee up front, a bit less brown sugary sweetness than typical browns I've had in the past. Tastes very nutty as well; this nutty aspect is what I love about brown ales. A bit of coffee, and a fair earthy bitterness near the end. No roast malt notes here. This is a very enjoyable flavour profile.  Mouthfeel- Medium bodied. Seems to have the right amount of carbonation for the style. Neither fizzy nor flat. Fairly bitter aftertaste that is more earthy and herbal than anything else. My guess is that Sam is using English-style hops here. Dry, bitter finish.  Overall- Very good brown ale, the amount of hops used here definitely spruces up an otherwise boring style. I also enjoy the roast malt notes in the nose that reminds me a lot of a good porter, which is one of my favorite styles.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,Act25,4.3,"sweet as a scotch ale, hoppy, and as they write - it's a triple hybrid. One of their best beers. Original without being cloying or cute.  A: Porter, with long deep head, long lasting and lacing. S: Caramel spread on burnt toast, roast nuts, coffee, cocoa, dark church wood, salt grass, hay. T: Follows smell, but ironically sweet up front and dry finished. Very enjoyable, roasty arc with plenty of cleansing bitters. Again wood, char, tar, marsh, salt water, sand flats, clams, and salt grass. Complex. MF: also complex: starts creamy, but follows through long and powdery and dry.  Great strong and slow food beer.

But I was wrong  Appearance: Nothing amazing here. Looks like a stout, not quite as dark  Smell: Sweet, caramel, coffee (which was a delightful surprise).  Taste: Coffee, hops, nutty, caramel, chocolate  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, and easy drinking.  Overall: While I was let down that I thought it was WWS at first glance, I was pleasantly surprised.

Lacing is superb! Smell - a mix of dark malts, caramel, chocolate and fruity hops; smells very much like some black ales (black IPA's)! Taste - uh oh...there is a bit of copper in the first few sips. This eventually fades to a fairly interesting blend of brown sugar, caramel candy and some fruity hops.

According to the DFH website, this beer is okay to age. I'm not a beer aging expert, but we'll see how a very old beer scavenged from my roommate's fridge goes. So on with the show.  Twelve ounces poured into a pint glass. A very dark brown color, quite opaque. Gives a 1 finger tan head. Smells of chocolate and malt. Perhaps a few hops too, but they may have died off a year ago.  Taste: This is a unique beer! Mostly quality malt, but with a definite hop presence and bite. Coffee-like aftertaste that is pleasant.  Mouthfeel is not nearly as heavy as it looks. I realize it's not a stout, but color can be deceiving. It's medium at most and pretty crisp. A fair amount of carbonation.  Overall, this beer is a great surprise.

A lingering chocolate bitterness finishes off the taste.  M: Medium/full bodied. Finishes dry.  O:DFH nailed it with this cross of a scotch ale and an IPA.

Taste is biscuity, it has a floral hop brown ale thing going on but its got more going on as well. I get some licorice on the finish, its almost as easy and non-challenging as a brown ale but then it sneaks up, grabs the cap off your head and runs away when you're not looking.

Significant hop bite forward over ripe dark fruit and smoke. Bitterness moderately lingers at the sides of the tongue.  m: Light to moderate, decent body, light enough to drink year round.  o.

10099,1161,BarryMFBurton,4.13,"Dogfish Head doesn’t distribute to us Hoosiers, but I was lucky enough to find some at the Frisky Whisky in Columbus, GA. Cheers!  Bottled 11/20/2013, over two months before the date of this tasting. While not ideal, this was one of the youngest beers in the store.  A: Deep ruby in color, this beer pours dark and thick. It’s not hazy, though: hold it up to the light and you can nearly see right through it. Bubbles rising fast from the nucleation site obscure the view slightly, but they also elevate a soft head of tan foam to an inch in height. Looks just like foamed milk: creamy and light.  S: A mild, nutty nose, but that doesn’t mean it’s not complex: notes of chestnut, peat, and maple oatmeal meld with a stiff, authentic barley tone. It’s like opening a bag of malt – burnt toast, toffee, and grain husk aromas fill the senses.  T&M: What a blend of tastes and textures. The familiar nuttiness and thin, creamy body of a brown ale is apparent, but it’s just the tip of the iceberg: the palate endures, opening up into another layer of earthy, smoky, peaty flavor, with an ever-increasing density you’d find in a foamy milk stout. Supporting tastes of brown sugar, root beer, vanilla, and red velvet cake. As it winds down, there’s a drying espresso tone and a surprisingly bright crackle of grassy hops, leaving this with a crisp, slightly dark aftertaste.  O: I’ve heard rumors that Dogfish Head might be coming back to Indiana soon…if that’s the case, this might just become a staple in my fridge.

Pours with a nice one finger dirty brown head that sticks around for a while, before collapsing into a light layer of bubbles over the top of the beer. No lacing, but it could have been the glass.  Smell: Caramel and toffee notes overlayed with some roastiness. Mild metallic smell, which burned off after a while.  Taste: A lot roastier than I expected. Caramel, sweet malts form the backbone but a nice roasted kick on the back end rounds the flavor. Unimposing, well bodied, well rounded taste. Slightly boozy at times.  Mouthfeel: Not as creamy as a stout but not as carbonated as an amber ale. Good in-between really lends to the body in this one.  Overall: A great offering from DFH. Well rounded beer with plenty of character without being weird. The only improvements would be less of a metallic smell in the nose and better alcohol masking in the taste.

Flavor is intense off the bat with steely, toasty malts, hint of coffee, cocoa, and fairly sharp bitterness. Hops play second fiddle (barely) and work to balance malts with some floral, earthy, peppery notes. Good balance of intense flavors, bitterness is medium/high and lingers for a bit.  Overall - A super flavorful beer; moreso than any brown ale I've had thus far. This is obviously a very well thought out, well crafted brew, but wasn't quite what I was expecting out of a brown.

No detectable hops or other traits you come to get used to regarding an IPA. The bottle kept saying fully hopped, but what I got the most of was malt, lots of malt. Not as big and bold as in a barley wine, but you knew this was all about the malt.  The hops had to balance off the malt, because this wasnt really a heavy beer, not a light one either.

Hints of smoked wood, vanilla, and faint alcohol also fill the nose. This beer hits your mouth with a big roasted nut, smoked meat, and sweet chocolate/toffee taste. Then a subtle but very present bittering hop feel on the finish. The mouthfeel has a nice well balanced sweet, sugary, creamy feel that leaves the mouth craving another sip.

Smell is dark mocha with some brown sugar or molasses aroma. Taste is a quick hit of hop bitterness then a wave of bittersweet that holds on until a medium dry bitter finish. Much more than a brown ale with better hopping and a body closer to a stout. Lightly cloying due to the high sugar levels but very enjoyable. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with just enough carbonation.

Very thick, syrupy. Ok carbonation.  Overall not too excited about this one. Best beer served at my company's holiday party so had to give it a try.

S: Dark, caramely malts, dark fruit, piney hop, brown bread, a bit of smoke, and traces of coffee. Quite complex in the nose.  T: Sweet caramel malt balanced nicely by the arrival of piney hop flavors. A definite smokiness and some dark fruit notes can be found throughout. A somewhat sweet beer overall, but it is balanced and complimented at every turn by the hops and smokey quality. Excellent.

Bottle date is 10/03/13  A: Pours an extremely dark brown, almost black. About an inch of tan head.  S: Roasted malt, bread, and caramel aromas immediately stand out. Not as much hop aroma as I was expecting based on the description. Not the highlight of this beer.  T: Immediate caramel and raisin flavors followed by coffee, piney hop bitterness, and a malty scotch sweetness. It's got a slight hop bite, but I was expecting more from something that has ""a hopping regimen of an India Pale Ale"". Strong finish of roasted malt and chocolate. Amazing taste, and the complexity really reveals itself at a slightly warmer temperature  M: Perfect for a beer of this style. Despite how this beer looks and tastes it's mouthfeel is definitely on the lighter side.  O: A great beer that's dangerously sessionable considering its 7.2% abv. Delicately balanced somewhere between a scotch ale and hoppy brown ale, without much of the intensely hoppy IPA characteristics I was expecting. However I actually really like the subtlety of the IPA qualities, and I would totally recommend picking up a pack! My only complaint is that it's not too readily available in the Bay Area. Because it has complex flavors, is easy to drink, and blurs the line between multiple beer styles, I can totally see this being a ""gateway beer"" for people reluctant to try hoppy or dark beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

An earthy hop aroma at the end as well.  Toasted nuts with toasted malt start off the flavor. A little brown sugar comes in on support, then earthy hops take over and finish off with a mild coffee flavor. *Edit* Caramel becomes more apparent in combination with the brown sugar as it warms.

10099,1161,HookerBrews,4.27,"This is my first beer review, so I will try my best to tackle this brew equitably. I'm a very big fan of Dogfish (as I'm sure most on here are) and have never been disappointed by their offerings. The Indian Brown Ale is no exception.  Appearance: I poured from a cold bottle into a point glass. The beer pours a rich, brown color with a nicely tinted, fizzy head that has good retention, but not a ton of lacing. The beer appears close to black, but reveals an inviting reddish brown color upon being held up to the light. Put simply, it's a pretty beer with no haze whatsoever.  Smell: If you get a nice head on this brew, you really get a good whiff of the huge amount of hops that Dogfish is notorious for. But there's something else at work here as well. There's a note of ginger snaps and caramel once the head goes down and releases more of the aroma. The smell of this beer is rather complex and will keep you smelling the glass as you drink it all the way down.  Taste: When cold, the Indian Brown Ale has a fairly hoppy bite. But the hops are by no means overpowering. The initial sip is hoppy, followed quickly by a rush of the flavors you would expect from an expertly crafted Dogfish. Hops give way to tastes of roasted grain, black coffee, and caramel. As the beer warms up the hops really start to back off and releases more of the complex, multi-dimensional flavors imparted by the addition of caramelized sugar in the brewing process. I swear I taste maple syrup when drinking this. The complexity of this brew is immensely satisfying and keeps you drinking to try to guess what kind of a beer it really is. Is it a black IPA? A Scotch Ale? You may not really figure it out before your glass is empty.  Mouthfeel: The body is somewhere between medium and heavy with a good bit of chewiness. The carbonation is active and fizzy, but not overpowering. It gives the sensation of hop resin evaporating off of your tongue. Delicious.  Overall: I had not tried this beer until fairly recently and after doing so, I'm surprised that this is actually one of Dogfish Head's less popular brews. The entire experience of it is fairly unexpected, yet inviting and strangely familiar. It's a heavy enough brew to be very satisfying, but not so heavy that it could not be a session beer. I would happily spend a night drinking glass after glass of this stuff. The taste and aroma are layered and quite complex, as Dogfish brews are wont to be. Like the 60 minute IPA, the Indian Brown Ale is a refined experiment in craft brewing gone so, so right. Grab a 6-pack and enjoy!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,brurevu,4.4,"The Indian Brown Ale poured a deep dark brown with ruby hints and a decent tan head. There was loads of chocolate syrup in the aroma with some sweet malts as well. The initial taste hit me with straight up chocolate syrup that faded to a slight bitter hop burnt malt on the back end that coated my palate. This was truly a hybrid beer, but more towards the Scotch Ale/Brown Ale spectrum with the IPA notes on the tail end that kept it from being overly sweet. As it warmed I picked up notes of coffee and burnt brown sugar and the bitter hoppiness became more pronounced. It started with the sweet chocolate syrup and ended on the bitter burnt malt & hop profile on every sip.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,IPAdams,3.87,"Appearance-Pours a light brown with a reddish hue. Small off white head that recedes quickly, leaves some lacing.  Smell- Smells much more like a stout than a brown ale.

It has a unique smell and taste that I had never experienced before (I had never had a brown ale) that seemed sweet, but with enough hops to bring in the bitter to balance the taste nicely. It's the type of beer that I would only drink one or two of at a time, but that is because I take the time to enjoy a beer with such flavor, rather than trying to drink it quickly. I would even say that I enjoy this more than their 60 minute IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

It's a great idea I've seen a lot of my home brewing friends explore...  A - 4.25 - Beer is a very dark brown color with a finger of off white head that dissipates down to a thick film of fine bubbles over the beer. Lacing is sparse. Bottle itself is cool - pretty standard Dogfish Head style.  S - 4.25 - Smells like a coffee shop - coffee/ espresso. Some cocoa/chocolate. Piney/citrusy hops balance out the coffee. Like a black IPA with more coffee feel to it.  T - 4.50 - Tastes like good coffee. Has a strong bitter/piney hop presence. You can definitely pick out some citrusy hop flavors (specifically grape fruit) in this beer. There's some roasty burnt marshmallow flavor too. I think what sets this apart from a black IPA is the heavier coffee shop flavors.  M - 4.25 - Good, medium carbonation. Bitter coffee aftertaste. Alcohol well hidden.  O - 4.25 - I really liked this beer. It's like a black IPA only with more coffee-ness to it that makes it almost more hearty and relaxing to drink. I think it'd be cool to taste this along both black IPA s and brown ales, its pretty unique. The color is also SLIGHTLY lighter than a black IPA but not by much.

Heaping handfuls of roasted chestnuts and dark malt with chocolate, caramel and burnt sugar in the nose. Malty and slightly rich up front on the tongue. Pleasant layers of malty sweetness topped with roasted nuts, caramel and mild chocolate. Creamy and smooth on the tongue, finishing slightly warm and sweet.  Evidently, I hadn't tried this beer in a long time, which was a clear oversight on my part. I've largely forgotten about many DFH beers, so this came as a pleasant reprise of a beer I really used to enjoy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,ThisWangsChung,3.23,"12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours a very dark chestnut color. The head is a two finger mocha shade. It has a wonderfully soft texture, and as it fades away, leaves behind plenty of lacing on the glass.  S: I don't really pick up a ton of hops...at first. There's a pleasant wave of brown sugar, nuts, and chocolate at first. Hops build up as it unravels in the glass, revealing both piny and herbal qualities. Maybe even a touch of mint. I must say, the hops are VERY well integrated within the maltier aspects of the aroma.  T: Aye...this is a bit of a letdown next to the nose. Subdued hops open this up - providing notes of grapefruit, mint, and pine - and roll all the way to the back end, being propped up by caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and faint chocolate. This malt backbone builds up on the finish, slowly but gradually. My problem here is that it seems like a cross between a boring IPA and a boring brown ale - it hybridizes the two styles well enough, but comes off blandly. When people rag on 'balanced' brews, this is exactly what they'd rag on. Actually, come to think of it, since it's too sweet, that would make it imbalanced...  M: It finishes rather sweet, and unfortunately, the hops don't really dry it out as much as I'd like. Even worse, it lacks the creaminess I like out of most sweetish brews. For that reason, it's hard to drink. On the plus side, there's no remote hint of harshness in the feel.  O: It's not a bad beer. Nor is it interesting, complex, or subtly executed. Basically this is just another average brown ale, only with a hint of hops. I say it's well worth a try for those who like this style, but I won't be back for this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

The dry hopping put a Black IPA forward taste but was quickly finished off with a combination of the brown sugar sweetness with a touch of what seemed like a Belgian yeast strain. There was some porter coffee flavor in there too with an extreme balance that kept me coming back for more.  M - A bit thick and heavy like a strong porter.  O - Another winning selection from Dog Fish Head. Its nice to be able to find such a complex beer for only 13.50 a six pack.

10099,1161,DeFaz,3.98,"This is a big, unique, interesting beer that manages to be sweet and dry at the same time. The caramelized malt and the hops are both dominant and work together. The nose is all about the alcohol, the sweetness, molasses and the malt, and the taste starts off sweet and finishes dry as the hops show up dressed to kill, with the raison, chocolate, and alcohol noticeable. The mouthfeel is somewhat creamy but also on the thin side. I can't say that this really hides the high ABV, and the sweetness is a bit much for me. This beers works really well, which is an incredible feat considering how bold it is. Personally, I tend to stay away from beers of this magnitude, but I respect the risk taken in making this and the fact that it really is something special.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,brewerburgundy,3.95,"12oz bottle, ceramic mug, bottled 5/23/13.  It's a rich looking beer the transparent deep brown of raisins with a head like light brown sugar.  It's also rich smelling; boozy rum raisins, some toasted whole grain bread, oatmeal with brown sugar, creamy.  Not as sweet as one might expect, dark coffee grounds, earthy hops, and boozy fermented brown sugar make for a decidedly bitter beer set against some raisin.  Creamy, medium-high carbonation, definite fizz on the tongue, gets a bit thin and dry in the finish with obvious alcohol.  This seems to have evolved since I bought the six pack. It was sweeter and it seems to be entering a boozy phase.

Then there is this super sweet molasses smell like that of a sugar daddy candy. A little boozy smell that is masked by the sweet brown sugar.

10099,1161,BeerWizard,4.36,"Poured out of a bottle into a mason jar gently, creating a fairly massive, rocky, tan head that mushroomed over the top of the glass and made its way to the counter eventually.  Smells chocolaty, smoky, a little boozy, and then there is a fresh character to it, I guess from the hops. Flavor is big malt, molasses, cocoa, smoke, and hop bitters giving it a little lift, and a clean, hoppy finish. Tight! This is a big meaty ale, but the sweetness and hop structure make it pretty easy to suck down. And at 7.2 abv, I could see myself getting into trouble with this one. Pretty thick mouthfeel and very satisfying.  At $12 a six pack I can't imagine getting this too often, but for a fall or winter evening there may just be nothing else more perfect than a couple of these.

A little bit of light penetrates through making the beer a deep amber color. Seems very dark for a brown ale. Epic lacing. Could not pick up much from smelling this beer. Maybe a little burnt sugar. Taste is full of burnt sugar, bready malts, and crisp hops to balance things out. Kind of get a metallic, bitter aftertaste on some sips right after the hops come through. Gonna let this one warm a bit. As it warms the aroma gets much stronger. I smell alcohol,plums, brown sugar, molasses. Just smells sweet with dark fruits. As it warms the kind of metallic aftertaste is still there but tastes more like i expect the hops to taste. Hoppier than any brown ales I have ever tried and I like it! The hops give it a crisp finish balancing the malt out but this beer is still definitely a brown ale. Hops are subtle and give you a crisp finish. Mouthfeel is excellent.

10099,1161,teromous,3.61,"A: At first the beer takes on the appearance of cola. It starts out dark black with a fizzy tan head, then the fizz settles down to a creamy fluffy top that leaves some lacing. When held up to light, the body shows very dark hues of brown, but it is very dark for a brown ale.  S: Not a whole lot going on in this department. There's a slightly nutty scent with a faint hint of caramel, and a faint acrid scent like an old piece of wood furniture with varnish. It's not too unpleasant just off-putting.  T: Very faint and mellow bitterness in both the hops and dark grains. It's a nice marriage of both these bitter flavors. Neither overpowers the other. There is a bit of a coffee quality to it, but with a freshness that is brought on by the hops. Not quite tea-like, but like a herb spiced coffee. I want to be clear that it doesn't taste like coffee, it just has that richness to it.  M: The mouthfeel is pretty full but not enough to overtake the palate. Nice pleasant bitterness, good carbonation, easy to drink.  O: I found this beer very easy to drink, with that little zing of hop flavor. I would drink it again.

The brown sugar is lightly apparent, but not too sweet like you'd think. The aftertaste is well settled and lingers long after. Not sure if I could tell a big difference between this and other dark ales without comparing them side by side. There are subtle hints that would probably be more apparent when comparing a similar competitors together.

The body is a dark brown highlighted with maroon and ruby. It glows maroon and ruby when held up to the light. There is some lacing left behind but not as much as I would have expected from the retention.  Nose- At the moment, it's mostly coffee and roasted malts. I got some chocolate when I smelled the bottle but this was underneath the roasted notes. Some chocolate shows itself in the glass as well. Very nice aroma but not very complex. And not what I expected from a brown ale. I may be speaking too soon as I also get a nice whiff of raisin. There is a bit of sourness that becomes evident with a lot of swirling.  Taste- The sourness (from roasted malts) is the first thing that hits me followed by some woody and resin bitterness. Some caramel comes out as well and the brown sugar that was used is quite noticeable. The Scotch ale characteristics of this hybrid are the most evident. It's a little thinner than a wee heavy but that is understandable. Some raisin and even faint hints of tobacco and leather. The hops are definitely the most diminutive aspect of the flavor profile and they try to buttress the sweet malts but they can't. This is not bad; I like the maltiness (much better than I do in a lot of browns). If the palate were a bit thicker and there were spicy hops on the finish, this would a damn fine beer (but would probably have to be reclassified). There is a minimal amount of heat as well that suits the overall taste. While there is a lot of complexity, there is a lack of balance. Still, a pretty good beer.  Mouthfeel- A little less than medium bodied- some syrupy aspects. Perhaps a little over-carbonated.  Drinkability- This a hard one to pin down. Some imbalance but a slight and beneficial heat. A bit messy but still fairly easy to drink. Perhaps not sessionable.  Overall- Pretty good beer. I'm not particularly a fan of brown ales but this one has its charm.

A bitter/spicy combination hits the palette as it makes its way to the back of your mouth.

Taste is very clean for a brown ale having the roastiness of the malt and a hop bite in the end. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation.

10099,1161,BethanyB,4.05,"Appearance: Dark brown, with exceptional clarity that made the ruby red highlights impossible to ignore. The off-white head was airy, yet gargantuan, making it easy to overpour, since it grew quickly in the glass. It settled just as quickly, however, into a soft, creamy topping.  Smell: Roasted mocha was the definite star of the show, backed by a chorus of grainy malt flavors. Altogether, the smell was both prominent and yummy.  Taste: Hop lovers, take note: The bottle states that this beer is ""hopped liberally and often,"" and this promise does not go unfulfilled. Spicy bittering hops are far more abundant than one would expect from a typical American brown ale; they come just close enough to taking priority over the roasted mocha and nutty maltiness that is typical of the style. The latter still dominates in the end, however, making for a balanced twist on tradition.  Overall: Personally, I'm not super big into hops, so it took me a little while to get used to this brew. But after some more open-minded swallows, I couldn't help but give it a solid thumbs-up. It's a strong example of an American brown ale, but with an unexpected punch.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,Jadjunk,4.25,"""A clean, well hopped brown ale brewed with caramelized sugar and hopped liberally and often."" Do you think they put hops in this? Brewed in the style of an American Brown Ale, one of Dogfish Head's year round line up beers.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to my Dogfish Head Signature glass. Served north of 47º Fahrenheit.  (Appearance) Pours a buttery caramel cream head of a crispy cream consistency. Body color is a deep dark brown with ample carbonation and dense mahogany highlights. Retention is slightly above average and lacing is light and thin. Appearance is good for the style. 3.75  (Smell) Aromas of spiced bready grains, a hint of buttery malt and medium roasted malt, a touch of herbal and resinous hop notes, a puff of smoke, and a mild acidity. Altogether it blends nicely and stacks together for a great deal of aromatic complexity. There's a nice pleasant balance to the aroma. Potency is high. 4.25  (Taste) Up front a delicately spiced bready malt blend, light bodied but very flavorful. The malt transitions into toasty grain characters mentioning hints of coffee, toffee, and nuts balanced with resinous mid-ground hops. Yeast characters hint at raisins and figs with a pinch of sugar cinnamon and mellow allspice. Despite a great deal of malt and yeast complexity, the boldness of the hops bitterness carries through. It finishes ever slightly dry with a mildly buttery caramel grain note and herbal, soapy hop finish. This is one complex brown ale to behold. 4.25  (Mouthfeel) Clean, mildly acidic malt with a touch of hop resin for a mellow dryness. Carbonation is very mild, showcasing a smooth, uninterrupted malt and moderately bitter hop profile. Body is medium/heavy for the style, medium overall. Alcohol presence is mild. Wonderful texture and balance makes for high drinkability. 4.5  (Overall) Dogfish Head demonstrates quite vividly with this flavorful and diverse example that Brown Ales don't have to be mundane. Lots of toasted caramel malt flavor, a mild acidity with mysterious fruit and spice notes, and an ever present, if not ""under the radar"" hop blend that blends very well with the flavors to give this beer the winning edge. Another deserved Year Round available by Dogfish Head, stretches the boundaries of what we should expect out of our Brown Ales. 4.25  Dogfish Head Brewery's Indian Brown Ale 4.25/5.00",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,RummyRedbeard,4.08,"[Editor's note] First off I'd like to say that the date on the neck scared me a little at first, but I was just really in the mood for this beer so I had to get it anyway. Also I have allergies right now so my nose is pretty stuffy which prevents me from really telling the aroma of the beer and may also affect my taste.  I had Boulder Beer Co.'s flashback a couple days ago and it really resparked an interest for a solid brown ale. I used to LOVE Terrapin's Hop Karma, it was my favorite beer when I was 21 so when I had BBC's flashback it was like a shark tasting blood, so naturally I went to the next thing that came to mind (and was available in Boston) which was Dogfish Head IBA.  12oz bottle poured into a Guinness pint glass. Brewed on 11/20/2012  Appearance: Pours dark brown with a hint of red, not entirely opaque. Small light brown head that leaves lacing which washes away easily.  Smell: From what I can smell... coffee, chocolate, brown sugar.  Taste: Right off the bat, coffee bitterness with a sugary sweet flavor. Chocolate or roasted malt backbone. It puts some sort of warmness in my belly that reminds me of dark fruits but may just be the 7.2%abv.  Mouthfeel: Thick mouthfeel but easily drinkable. Goes down smooth. The carbonation compliments the consistency nicely.  Overall: This beer is seductive! Not as hoppy as Hop Karma or flashback but still a great representation of the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

A: 4.5 -dark-brown coloration, minimal clarity (can't see or read through), frothy white two finger head dissipates into subtle glass lacing, moderate alcohol legs  S: 4.25 - lots and lots of malt characters - caramel, butterscotch, milk chocolate, shortbread cookies, creme brule...there's really a lot going on here; supposedly ""dry hopped like 60 Minute IPA and 90 Minute IPA,"" but, to be honest, I don't get much hops at all in the nose...definitely characters of a Scotch and traditional Brown though  T: 4.5 - on the front of the tongue, there's a soft bitterness that dissipates quickly into that really rich malt character in the middle of the mouth to match the aroma perfectly, very delicious and leaves you wanting more immediately  M: 4.5 - moderate body, slight booze, moderate carbonation...the richness really carries it though  O: 4.5 - I enjoy typical English brown ales but the American adaptation is true to our style of ""more is better""...the huge malt character really kicks this into a world-class offering and, to be honest, probably hides a lot of the hops from the dry-hopping schedule (might be a waste of money there....I wonder what hops they used?

10099,1161,barczar,4.14,"Pours an opaque brown black that is clear garnet when held to the light. Huge 2 inch frothy, dense khaki head lingers indefinitely.  Chocolate, malted milk balls, and roast malt form the initial aroma. Underlying notes of citrus and pine are more subtle than expected. Resin, caramel sweetness, and floral notes emerge as it warms, along with stronger grapefruit notes.  Coffee grounds and roast malt dominate the initial flavor, with hints of sweet chocolate hitting mid palate accompanied by citrusy grapefruit, becoming slightly resiny and bitter at the finish. Nutty, caramelly flavors add intrigue.  Body is smooth and on the full side, with moderate to slightly high carbonation and slight alcohol warmth.  Minus the sweetness and add more hops, and this would be a black ipa. Pretty much is before black ipas were cool, I guess.

S: The nose is sweet malt, caramel, a bit of vanilla, and some biscuit. The caramel and malts shine the most as the other scents are playing backup.  T: Sweet and inviting to start with a nice helping of caramel and malt. The carbonation and a touch of hops come on in the middle to tighten this beer up. A very nicely balanced beer from start to finish.  M: Medium bodied beer. It's sweet for a flash as it coats the palate, but nothing over saturates the taste buds. The finish is flavorful and clean.

Aroma starts like an English Nut Brown Ale with slight metallic notes, some sweetness, and chocolate. No real hops to speak of. Sweet chocolate and nut start the flavor off, which fades to brushed metal, then an earthy bitterness which is actually quite balanced despite the description on the bottle. The feel is mostly balanced, but tending towards viscous and finish is somewhat sweet.  This might be one of DFH's most drinkable beers.

Very dark brown; almost black. Fluffy, nougat colored head [Full disclosure: I bought this bottle around the beginning of the new year (I think it was New Year's Eve), so it has naturally mellowed].  The aroma is rich with roasted coffee notes and dark, chocolately malts. A medium-heavy body with malts lying a notch above the now mellowed hops which, nonetheless, still carry a flavorful presence.

I was hoping for something in the vein of Brooklyn Brown or Newcastle or even a Nut Brown type of ale but it wasn't. To be fair the packaging did say it was hoppy.

Nice, creamy head with very good lacing. This beer is just such a joy to drink. So smooth and creamy. DFH call this a ""hybrid"" of an IPA and a Brown Ale, but I think this comes closer to a stout than anything else. Coffee is at the forefront while chocolate and caramel notes follow and a malty aftertaste which I love. Hops, although contributing little to the bitterness, are also present in the taste, like those of an IPA (hence why they call it INDIAN Brown Ale.

10099,1161,pkalix,4.42,"very nice dark, dark brown pour with a little bit of the standard medium-sized bubbles on top. smells like a brown ale with distinct subtle hop aroma. smells also a little sweet.... tastes like the standard 'brown ale' but with a twist. the caramelized sugar adds that different dimension and the 'liberal' hops also twist it up a bit. some chocolate, some toffee. smooth feel to the brew, with an almost 'stout-like' earthy taste. it's a very good product, one i could put down in succession for a few. after a few minutes of no sips (and watching the Lakers get their butts kicked against Charlotte) i still have a very pleasant sweet residual on my palate. i like that!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

T: Fresh, sweet lightly toasted grain, toffee, coffee flavor on the way down.  M: Medium body with a medium low carbonation.  O: One of the most unique beers I've ever had. It's pretty complex and I've never quite had anything that tasted so much like fresh grain. It's a great mix of scotch ale and brown ale. I didn't get the hoppy kick that is claimed by Dogfish Head, but that could be because it is balanced out by the huge malt body.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,SerialTicker,3.38,"Bottled 8/02/11 ... poured into a pint glass.  Yes. That long ago. Almost 17 months ago. I wish I had checked the date before buying my beer.  Appearance: Pours a dark, deep brown color with a small, tan head. The lacing's pretty good at the beginning.  Smell: Smells like you'd expect it to after it's been in a bottle for so long. Mild malt notes, but a sour, vinegar-like trunk smell is there as well. Not an overpowering smell... quite muted. I would certainly expect a fresh batch to smell a lot more pleasant.  Taste/feel: Tastes about as good as a 17 month old beer should be able to. It's drinkable, has a very nice and deep malty/coffee aftertaste. The hops seem to be almost completely gone in the taste and aroma, and it just drinks like a heavy brown ale ... almost like a porter or a stout with the super rich aftertaste. The feel's pretty decent. Low carbonation and somewhat creamy. Not bad.  Overall, hard to accurately score this one due to the sheer age of this beer. Regardless of its age, it tastes better than a lot of beers do fresh. I'd definitely try this again either on tap or out of a fresher bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,ColdWaffles,4.4,"Poured into a Samuel Smith's tulip-pint glass from a 12oz bottle.  Appearance: Really, really dark brown color beer with a substantial tan head with solid lacing. This is a mouthwateringly good looking ale.  Smell: Picked up hops first, then a nice darker coffee scent. Some dark fruit maybe too? Hop scent dissipated some time after the pour and gave way to what was almost fruit cake-y. All good.  Taste: Took my first sip cold and it wasn't excellent. Relatively sweet with a hops and alcohol aftertaste. I've had this on draft before and its been better, so I'm letting it sit for a few.  Taste Pt II: Let it sit a few to get warmer and it's much better. Brings out molasses, more alcohol and more fruit. Lesson learned: Don't pull this from the fridge. A nice bitter-sweet, hopped up brown ale.  Mouthfeel: Decent medium body with a nice carbonation level. Fits the taste well.  A great, great beer. Would certainly buy again, and again and again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Easy to drink.  O: This is my first time having this beer, and it's very tasty. It's complex enough to be enjoyed by a beer snob, but drinkable enough to be enjoyed my a wide range of people.

Aroma: Rich coffee, toffee and burnt sugar, a whisper of leafy green hops underneath. Smells wonderful albeit somewhat simple.  Taste: Similar to the nose; burnt sugar, toffee, rich chocolate like malts, light coffee notes and a very faint citrus-y hop presence. Some definite malt complexity to decipher. Great taste and very original. Dry finish with a lingering hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Incredibly drinkable! Medium bodied with moderate to high carbonation. Refreshes the palate.  Overall: I first had this beer on tap in July and I haven't looked back since. Definitely one of my favorite beers.

The beer is nearly opaque, nearly as dark as some porters, but with distinct deep (and I do mean deep) mahogany coloring.  S- This smells eerily similar to delicious raison bread that my grandmother used to make. Quite a hit of dark, fruity sweetness in there, very minimal hop aroma.  T- First thing that comes to mind is sweet molasses with some candied fruit in the background. Alcohol is very well balanced and hidden fairly well. A very lucious and not at all dry finish. Not cloyingly sweet, but there are definitely some residual sugars in there adding to the sweetness. More bitterness on the back end.  M - This beer really covers the entire palate, one of the chunkiest, fullest mouthfeels out there.  O- This beer is amazing. Very strong flavors, great aroma, pretty in a glass, and affordable at 9.99 a sixer.

T- Tastes bout like it smells, hit with the toasted malts first followed by the caramel, can taste a little of the alcohol, then the earthy tastes really come through leaving a slight hint of coffee and wood. (Coming from a non-coffee drinker the coffee flavoring is not too overpowering.)  M- Dry, light to medium carbonation, medium bodied, the late aftertaste is of metal, kind of like sucking on a penny.  O- Good beer. I had the first drink while the glass and beer were still cold. for the better richer flavor allow the beer to warm just a tad. After that I drank it rather quickly due to the odd metallic aftertaste. By no means was the aftertaste enough to turn me off this beer. Would definitely enjoy this beer again.

Tan colored less than a finger thick head that very quickly disappears into a thin surrounding ring. Not much lacing.  Aroma: Caramel of course. Sweet toasty malts. A comparatively moderate aroma strength wise. Hop if present as is said are very suppressed.  Taste: Typical brown ale taste with flavors of toasted malts and caramel. Slight hop presence. Dry finish. No sweetness is observed in the taste. Neither too much of hops to suggest any bitterness.  Mouth feel : A +ve point here. Very smooth with no astringency whatsoever.

Hints of coffee are most prominent, with a slight alcoholic scent, and some hop aroma.  Taste is roasty first and foremost, with a nice balance of bitterness and sweetness. As the beer warms, alcohol warmth shines through, and hints at a barrel-aged flavor.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for such a heavy and flavorful beer. The bitterness complements the flavors well.

S: Malty sweet and a bit sugary, nice aromas of browned caramel and molasses, with hints of vanilla, maple-wood, and even a ghostly flash of oak...faint dark fruit character, figs...light earthy hoppiness.  T: With lots of malty caramel, the taste is right in line with the nose. There is the slightest hint of alcohol, and a coffee-like roasted bitter edge that competes with the sweetness.

This falls into the same category, of beers that combine dark roast flavors along with some hoppiness and importantly, the ability to have one or two as part of a meal. DFH was ahead of the trend; it's not as unique as it once was, but it's still a good one.  Appearance: dark brown, blocks most light.  Smell: much like an IPA: the hop flavors come out more than anything else.  Taste: richer than an average IPA, with more depth to go along with the hops.  Mouthfeel: not too rich, but stays on the palate.  Overall, a very well-balanced beer. Some hops, some malt, some of everything.

Sort of a fermented fruit smell to it maybe from the roasted malt. Background tinge of alcohol.  T: Well balanced mix of a hoppy ipa, nutty brown and sweet scotch ale.

A: Poured a dark, dark, chocolate dipped cherry red color, with a nice 1/2 finger mocha head that retained itself throughout the session.  S: Man, this smelled almost like a stout but not quite. I think the brown sugar bill did that idea in. Also, there is a very unique ""citrus"" component to this beer that I always get buried underneath, particularly on the nose.  T: Lots of cocoa and candy-coated booze filled the palate with yummy goodness. Some brown sugar was presents, but I didn't get as much during this session as I have with this one in the past.  M: I always get a bitter late aftertaste that is very coffee-like, with a slight bit of booze burning that hits the palate just right. The lacing is moderate.  O: I've yet to come across a single brewery that does American Browns like Dogfish Head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,rangerred,3.87,"12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a clear dark brown with a one finger tan head. Awesome head retention but very little in the way of lacing.  Nose immediately reminds me of chocolate milk. Wonderful rich milk chocolate along with some light roast coffee. Some roasted malt along with a hint of dried dark fruits. Also some caramelized sugar.  The roasty characteristics continue into the taste. Some dark chocolate and coffee along with roasted barley. The dark fruit is more predominant with figs and some licorice. There is a little bit of tartness in the mouthfeel along with a breath of alcohol in the finish. Bitterness is light to moderate.  Overall, a good beer that does cross style lines. I really was expecting more bitterness but there is enough there to balance out the sweetness. More like a cross between a porter and a RIS. Good to have occasionally.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Beer_HOPper,3.88,"On tap at 38 degrees, I was looking forward to this as I am a fan of American brown ales.  Appearance: dark chocolate root beer with 1 finger of head and sticky light brown lace.  Smell: nutty, cocoa, malts, was hard a little hard to detect.  Taste and Feel: thin-medium body, syrupy and smooth, caramel, well balanced, wet finish, mild carbonation, lightly bitter, good coffee aftertaste, did not detect alcohol.  Overall: A good American brown ale. However, I was mildly disappointed. Had 2 other beers afterwards that were better, Tropical Thunder - Bootlegger's Brewery and Lava - Ölvisholt Brugghús",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,JamesMN,4.47,"Appearance: Dark brown, basically black. Dark ruby red when held up to the light. Small light brown head. Looks great in the DFH tumbler.  Aroma: Woody with dark roasted grains. Hints of chocolate and coffee with a slight alcohol note.  Taste: Oh yeah. Nice bitterness gets you up front and is followed by roasted malt flavors of bitter chocolate and toffee. There's a good balance here of roastyness and hoppyness. The 7.2% abv is basically spot on for where I'd expect based on the taste. Nice and robust but without the alcohol that usually comes with that. The roasted chocolate gives this almost a porter-like taste and feel.  Mouthfeel: Pretty good drinkability and carbonation. Just above medium bodied. Really coats your whole mouth.  Final Thoughts: Yet another beer from DFH that completely lives up to the hype. If they distributed to MN it'd be a mainstay in my fridge right next to their 60 and 90 Minute. This one is a MUST HAVE for any dark beer lovers. It also doesn't disappoint in the IBU department for a hophead like myself.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,TheBrewo,3.98,"We pour a brew of the richest and deepest maroon. The head stands two and a half fingers tall, and shows the color of a latte. Retention is nice, leaving sheets and splotches of lacing around the glass. Carbonation appears active, and a light haze is noted, without sediment. The aroma is bright with roasty caramel malts, hazelnut, milk chocolate, and char as in a stout. With warmth come light metals and yeast, with the faintest grassy hop character. There is white creaminess and booze on the far back. Our first impression is that there is a nice deep roast to the malts, and that the beer is very tasty. As we sip, Scotch ale malts of deep caramel and drying milk chocolate malts both cool and singe the palate. The middle shows a peak of grassy hops and light syrupy citric flesh sweetness. These blend and cut expertly with the darker malt base. The end shows enhanced sweetness of hazelnut and more milky, creamy chocolates. We also get a spicy, peppery alcohol bite, and more caramel malt roast. The end is very smooth, with more sweetness than bitterness throughout the back half of the swallow. The aftertaste breathes of medicinal phenols, clean raw cocoa and chocolate malts, light tin, and more nut oil slickness. The body is medium, and the carbonation is average. The mouth is initially coated and cooled, but a coffee and chocolate malt dryness takes over, significantly drying the mouth through and through. There is nice froth, cream, slurp, and smack with each sip. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks nicely.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the clean and complex flavoring, and the smooth drinkability. The malts were deep and roasty, and at times approached an almost stouty arena, but there was nice sweetness to cut from multiple points. This is a highly drinkable beer, given the softness of the feel, the easy blend to the flavoring, and the easy glug to each sip.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

I'm not familiar with brown ales, but I'm amazed how dark this is, I know Dogfish Head has a habit of going all out! The smell is delicious, toasty malts are at the forefront of it. Am I about to drink a stout or a brown ale? It tastes just the way it smells, the toasty malts are outstanding with a noticeable carbonation. The mouthfeel is great, medium-heavy and creamy.

Beautiful beer with pretty lacing down the sides of the glass.  S: I'm getting lots of nutty aroma as well as some clean flowery hops. Maybe a little brown sugar or caramel. A little chocolate and dark fruits as well.  T: Beautiful nutty dark fruity flavors hit me first. Some rich chocolate as well as a more molasses flavor than I picked up in the nose. The hops are definitely present in the finish. Nice roasted malt flavor throughout.  M: Medium to light body. Keeps true to the style but not as true to the depth and alcohol in this brew.

Smell - Notes of caramelized sweetness, roasted malt, and some definite floral hoppiness.  Taste - Notes of sweet caramel and hints of toffee up front, with nice, medium roast coffee character throughout. Beautifully counterbalanced by a generous amount of floral hoppiness. Coffee and bitter chocolate notes linger in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with solid carbonation. Silky. Goes down exceptionally smooth.  Overall - Close to a porter/brown hybrid. The flavor and mouthfeel is very reminiscent of the Sierra Nevada stout.

10099,1161,Jugs_McGhee,2.9,"12 fl oz brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into a conical Guinness pint glass in me gaff in low altitude Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Expectations are high given its current ratings. Paired with cheese & crackers and pretzel rods.  Served straight from the refrigerator. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: Pours a 1.5 finger head of khaki colour, nice cream, nice thickness, and good retention considering the 7.2% ABV. Colour is an extremely dark caramel-brown. Appealing for the style. Not particularly predictable, but not unique or special. Nontransparent. No yeast particles are visible. Non-opaque.  Sm: Cream, nice caramelization (very Scotch ale-esque), dark malts, milk, a hint of roast, nuts, and some light toasted malt character. Resembles the crappy American Guinness from the nitro-can. In a way, that's a compliment. A moderate strength aroma.  T: Caramel, cream, milk, roasted barley, dark malts, pleasant almond and nuts notes, and light toasted character. It's surprisingly simple, but I do like it for what it is. A bit of a tea note rounds out the flavour profile. Hop character is a muted floral. Balanced, but underwhelming. Lacks the subtlety it needs to truly be great. No yeast or alcohol comes through. Too bitter on the climax.  Mf: Smooth and wet, suiting the flavours generally well. The creamy quality it has is nice, but needs to be upped. Nice thickness. Good carbonation.  Dr: A nice offering from Dogfish Head for what it is. I like the experimentation but it honestly feels pretty tame. I might try it on draught (or nitro), but I'm not horribly impressed - par for the course for Dogfish Head. Drinkable. Hides its ABV nicely.  C  Probably closest to a Scotch Ale in my book.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

The alcohol is hidden pretty well, although there is a slight warming in the finish.  A nice dry mouthfeel is slight carbonation and alcohol bite.

Smell is dominated by sweet malty characteristics, caramelized sugar/brown sugar, and followed by dry chocolate, roasted oak, alcohol, and a certainly noticeable hop presence, especially relative to other brown ales. The roasted chocolate characteristics are very noticeable in the taste, and the hop profile is very defined, creating a unique brown ale experience. The details of the the hop profile, however, are difficult to pinpoint as they inherently masked by what makes this brew a brown ale by definition. Slick and enjoyable mouthfeel.  Overall, a very exciting hybrid beer-drinking experience. I love brown ales, but often simultaneously desire that hop kick. Then, I love IPAs, but can be overwhelmed by the bitterness as well.

10099,1161,prototypic,4.07,"Indian Brown Ale pours a darker, mahogany brown color. It’s not hazy or opaque. Quite a bit of light cuts through, revealing burgundy highlights throughout. A nice tan head caps it and rises to nearly two fingers in height. It’s extremely slow to dissipate. I’m not sure it will completely! Lacing was thick and quite sticky. Looks really nice.  The nose is good. It definitely has a nice mix of caramel, chocolate, and brown malts. It smells a tad sweet, but caramel and cocoa are the most notable scents. Hops are noted, but don’t come through all that strong. They smell a tad citric and piney. There’s a bit of roasted coffee that resonates throughout. It’s a nice addition. I like it. Alcohol is blended very well and isn’t noticeable at all. Smells excellent! Very interesting and impressive nose for a Brown Ale.  The flavor is very good. No doubt about that. The malt base is very nice. It’s a mix of caramel, roasted, chocolate, and brown malts. Very diverse and flavorful. Caramel and cocoa are the most prominent, but they all come through. There are some light hoppy notes that really work well. I wish they were a tad stronger. They’re a little piney and citric. There’s a touch of bitterness, but not much. Coffee is definitely noted and adds a nice twist to the flavor. This is a complex American Brown Ale. Alcohol is masked well and is barely noticeable. Finishes malty with a light hop flavor.  Indian Brown Ale has a light medium body. Carbonation is active, but feels soft. It feels just a tad thin, but isn’t bad. It’s definitely easy drinking. I could handle a couple of these in a sitting easily.  Indian Brown Ale is certainly a nice take on the American Brown Ale style. I like that it incorporates elements of the Scotch Ale and IPA styles. It’s an interesting mix that succeeds! If you haven’t tried it by now, find a bottle.

The taste has some hops right up at the front (I guess this is where it gets the name ""Indian"" brown ale from.) After the hops I taste some sweet brown sugar, molasses, and nuts. It has a medium body and maybe slightly too much carbonation for my taste, but it still feels pretty nice.  I like what Dogfish Head has done here.

S - Not getting many of the hops here (since it is advertised as such!). I sense a playful combination of dark malts and dark fruits. There is a bit of bitter cocoa and just a pinch of coffee.  T - Complex is the best word that describes this one. There is chocolate, but not sweet. The taste would better be noted as bitter, yet does not dominate the beer due to a hoppy progression, finishing with a malty/creamy finish. Very unique, and an interesting brown for sure!  M - Very creamy with just a bit of hops to keep it from conforming to some norm. This does not take away from the beer though! It is smooth, medium bodied and overall enjoyable.  O - This is a great brown. I enjoy how the complexity keeps my palette guessing while remaining in a nice balance throughout.

The rich malt presence may be too much to register the hop profile. Moderate bitterness up front fades away as a creamy finish takes over.  O: Fan of the hybrid styles. Would love some pungent, floral hops to add complexity for a ""IBA"". No complaints on the body, full flavored, smooth and simply complex.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,ChrisPratz,4.17,"A: Deep black pours to a finger worth of light brown colored head that dissipates to a thin veil of lace across the top that clings all the way down.  S: Lots of dark chocolate and roasted malts with a light hint of alcohol. Very deep and rich.  T: Interesting combination here. I can't help but taste a crunch sourdough pretzel here. Chocolate flavors coming thru with some grain and malt but there is absolutely no sweetness here. Floral hop flavor comes thru towards the end and bitterness is non-existant. Alcohol esters are noticeable but are not overpowering. Everything is smooth and balanced and all the flavors go well together.  M: Medium carbonation allows for smooth and creamy finish on the palette, alcohol is noticeable and provides a dry feeling which goes with the pretzel taste I was talking about earlier.  O: Very impressed with the meshing of the different styles of brew here. Everything balances well, nothing is really over powering and you can get all ends of the beer spectrum with hoppy flavors and malt. And I really cant get over how it mimics the flavor profiles of a sourdough pretzel.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,thecheapies,4.05,"Very dark brown with two fingers of head that laced snags down to a dense capper. Great look for a brown ale. 4.0  Malted barley + deep roast, toffee-coffee sweetness, black cherry, and cocoa. 4.0  Rich and malty. Crossover between bitter cocoa and dark berries. Some coffee in the roastiness that keeps getting uncovered as it warms. Smooth black grain without the char. Not smoky, but fruity. Not bitter, but earthy. A peck on the cheeks from humulus. I swear, by taste alone, this is a mini-World Wide Stout. Only better. 4.0  Hefty body with a notched carbonation. In full effect. But, the drinkability is only SO high. A brown ale to savor, anyway. 3.5  Upper-eschelon of American Browns. Upper-eschelon of Dogfish Head brews. Do. You. Get. My.

Thick and tall amount of head from bottle poured into glass. Head was dark goldish amber in color, almost mirroring the beer. Light amount of lacing left behind. I found nothing that really stood out to look at in this brew.  S: Very similar to a brown ale. Smell was fruity, sugary and sweet, with a light sent of alcohol.  T: Strange but in a good way. A mix between Amber, Brown Ale and IPA. Very sweet, goes down easy, no bitter after taste. Leaves a taste of candied nuts, toffee with a hint of malt and alcohol.  M: Light and Bubbly, significant carbonation. Sweet. Feels like a higher carbonation brown ale.  O: Very unique taste but enjoyable. Light taste for a brown ale with a medium ABV. A true hybrid of beers capturing traits from an Amber, Brown Ale, and IPA with higher carbonation. Brown sugar definitely stands out in the flavor of the brew. Serving was good in a slightly wetted glass at around 50 degrees. I enjoyed this beer because it was something different, and very well brewed.

I also smell a touch of floral hops. The taste starts with a nice sweetness, almost like a fruit sweetness, but smooth and malty. Ad the beer glides across the tongue I get a tickle of carbonation followed by a citric hop bitterness and a rich roasty flavor. As the beer warms i notice that the emphasis shifts from the roasted malts to the caramel malt. This is a rather complex beer, drawing together a number of different tastes and styles.

Scent is of rich malts, a light nutty background and citrus and floral hops. Seductive and complex.  Citrus and floral hops at the start. Then the malts take over in the middle. Molasses, nuts, and cookies. Wet malty finish.  Medium bodied and mildly carbonated. An easy drinker but watch out or the ABV will sneak up on you.  A very unique and interesting take.

10099,1161,datalager,4.75,"I ran out of my DFH IBA a few months ago. It has been a staple on my cellar shelf since first discovering it almost one year to date. In an attempt to abstain from familiar ales, I have been on the hunt for all things new and unusual. Meanwhile, the Indian Brown has become but a ghost of a memory to my palate.  Yesterday, after noting a diminutive stock of brew in said cellar, I concluded that me and my taste buds yearned for DFH's classic hybrid brown once more. As I sit here typing this I am yet again, like Romeo to Juliette, discovering my love affair for this incredible...no...prodigious dark ale.  There is simply so much to love, here. The handsome frothy, dark pour. The full bodied aroma of vanilla, toffee, and roasted grains. Flavors swimming with sweetness, and a dry hoppy finish. This beer does it all...and it does it all WELL.  This is, in my most humble opinion, DFH's greatest accomplishment.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

S: This beer has fairly strong aromas of dark roasted malts with tons of sweetness - there is caramel, molasses, and brown sugar. Very light hints of alcohol.  T: The taste follows the smell quite closely and has quite a bit of complexity. There is a strong presence of dark roasted malts along with quite a bit of sweetness - caramel, brown sugar, nuttiness, and toffee. There is some light amount of bitterness in the finish.

T - Starts off with sweet brown sugar, caramelized malts, and some citrus hops and light bitterness.

Aroma: strong, malty, brown  Taste: strong in the malts, weak in the hops, hints of coffee. a sweet malty, brown taste that leaves a strong coffee finish that is too bitter for me. I can also feel the alcohol pretty soon; I guess that's the 7.2% ABV.  Mouthfeel: smooth, a little heavy, mild carbonation  A well-crafted beer, and a unique blend of Scotch, brown and IPA, though I sensed more of the Scotch and brown aspects and did not quite get the connection to IPA that was mentioned. I expect nothing less from Dogfish Head, the brewer of my all-time fav - 90-minute IPA.  While I enjoy the appearance, aroma, initial taste and mouth feel, my only hold-back is the strong coffee flavor. I am not a huge fan of coffee or chocolate in my beer, and the coffee after taste was a bit too bitter for me. This is the only reason I am on the fence about buying again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Goblinmunkey7,4,"Appearance: Deep reddish brown. Head is off white and relatively small. Clear and clean.  Smell: Nose has caramel, biscuit, and some smoked malts. I swear it’s smoked malts. The hops are there, but not really kicking much. Maybe a touch of pine and some citrus rind, but nothing too aggressive. Nice lingering sweetness. Roasted.  Taste: over the map in good way. A slight alcohol bite thrown over a pronounced hoppiness leaning on the citrus rind. Touches of smoked malt play through cocoa and caramel malts. Lots of cocoa on the aftertaste. Something akin to roasted vegetables in the mix. It’s earthy, veggie, and malty all at the same time. A nicely balanced, if almost too complexly flavored beer.  Mouthfeel: Nice bright carbonation on a medium body. A touch dry on the back. Smooth and a touch creamy.  Overall: A surprising thumbs up from DFH. Might be one of the best beers in their lineup.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,tobelerone,4.2,"While Brown Ales are not usually very high on the excitement scale, Indian Brown is an exception to this rule, it’s delicious, different, interesting, complex, and very satisfying. Wish I hadn’t waited so long to try it and am already anticipating my next one!  It’s good looking; rich dark brown with a fluffy tanned head that has good retention; lacing is also strong. Almost looks like a stout without the viscosity. You can see that it’s medium-bodied, with visible carbonation. Nose is quite chocolatey and malty; very faint trace of floral hoppiness, well integrated within the overall aroma. Sweet caramel and coffee also make an appearance.  As I said earlier it’s one of the tastier browns I’ve encountered; falling on the sweet side, with prominent chocolate and, to a lesser extent, coffee and cream flavors; big chewy malt, and a hint of floral hop notes; overall low on the bitterness scale and drinking only semi-dry. There’s a bit of mouth-coating brown sugar and molasses that sticks around a little, and a faint booziness in the end that emerges as the beer warms slightly.  Medium bodied and carbonated. Not exactly an easy-drinking brown, with the higher sweetness and ABV than is usual for the style, but very appealing.

Nose: Smells like a scotch ale, with notes of dark chocolate, toffee, maple, raisin, and slight hops. Nose is weaker than expected, but pleasant.  Taste: A balanced sweetness up front. Noticeable burnt caramel, toasted malts, and coffee, with a lingering, pleasantly bitter hop finish; more hops in the taste than the nose.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, moderate bodied mouthfeel, mild carbonation. Thicker and heavier may have been better in this case.  Overall: A balanced, well-crafted brown ale with a nice look and taste.

It has a malty roast aroma, like a … lightly hopped brown ale (which is what it is, no?). There’s a malty, sweet flavor but the malt doesn’t come across as overly sweet or syrupy. Not much roast and not a strong hop profile. It holds up as it warms with a noticeable bittering present.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

S: Chocolate, roast malt, bitter hops that are pine in nature, slightly strong but definitely not overpowering.  T: Chocolate and dark toffee up front, followed quickly by the piney hops. The hops come through more in the taste than they did in the aroma. Still, the beer is balanced. Some sweetness right at the end, but it's a pretty brief finish. Brief alcohol burn near the end as well. Tasty.  M: Medium mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Not too heavy, not too light. I wouldn't mind if it was just a tad heavier.  O: Really solid brown ale, maybe a bit more caramel malt and a little less hops and it would be perfect, but there's not much in the way of complaints here, you won't find a much better brown ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,Agent1,4.28,"I have been saving this bottle for almost two years, ever since Dogfish Head stopped distributing to Canada. I would say this bottle has got to be nearing three years in age. I am very excited for this ale, to say the least!  Appearance - Thick, creamy beige head. Bubbles dissipate to form a whip-creamy layer. I have let this sit and warm for almost twenty minutes now. The retention is very, very impressive. After settling for almost a minute or two, twenty minutes later and the head on this has hardly changed. Impressive! Very dark. So dark that you cannot see through this, even when held up to the light. Almost black, versus brown. (DISCLAIMER: This bottle has been aged)  Smell - Coffee, brown sugar, peppercorn, strong yeasts, dark fig, licorice, roasted almonds, molasses, wood and a wee bit of smokiness. Nice and sweet on the nose. Definitely much more of a stout aroma, compared to a brown ale, in my opinion.  Taste - Dark, ripe cherries, dark baker's chocolate and peat moss/ smoke. A nice, woody oak flavor. Also, coffee, brown sugar, cashews and almonds, strong, bold barley malts, with a faint hint of licorice. Ranging from light to medium as far as carbonation goes. The hops are very similar to that of your typical American IPA, although the IBUs are tamed down a bit. The alcohol is certainly present, cutting though everything, but not necessarily a bad thing. Leaves your tongue buzzing.  Mouthfeel - Stimulates the upper-front of the mouth the most. Also, the tip of the tongue. The alcohol is hidden well, but perhaps a little too noticeable (especially during the aftertaste).  Overall - I would say that this shares more similarities to a Scotch Ale than it would a Brown Ale or American IPA. The peat moss really cuts through from the Scotch barrels, which isn't a bad thing, but for some, might throw them off if expecting a standard brown. I love this beer. It really flaunts all sorts of interesting characteristics. Lots of smoke, baker's chocolate, brown sugar and American hops are present. A beautifully complex beer and arguably, yet another classic from Dogfish Head. Sam certainly knows his shit.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Review based on a bottle served at Hawkeye's Restaurant in Perkasie, PA  Enjoyed from a standard bar-issued pint glass (Coors Light written on the side...Duh)  A - Pours a very dark, totally opaque deep brown/black color. A foamy, tan colored, two finger head on the initial pour. During the review the head faded to a light skim. Nice rings and sticky lacing left on the side of the glass.  M - A welcoming aroma of roasted malts and a slight coffee smell as well.  T - The initial sip greats you with a very roasted malt taste with some bite from the slightly bitter hops. After it sits for a bit, I get some hints of sweetness (almost like chocolate) and even more of a mocha taste. Very creamy. The alcohol is barely noticeable.  M - A medium consistency with medium carbonation.  O - I really like this beer. For a while I was buying this by the case. It is a bit heavy for a session beer (although I had three while playing Trivia Night at the bar). DFH, in my opinion, puts out some of the most consistently well made beers out there.

S- Surprisingly faint, but good notes of sweet brown sugar and hops aroma. Tough to pull anymore out than that because of the faintness.  T- Very complex. Starts off with a slight hop bitterness, then gives way to brown sugar sweetness. From there you can pick up some malt backbone that is slightly peaty. Ends with a little hop bite.

Taste: This is what I have come to expect out of DFH a rather humdrum style that the try and ramp up and make more interesting and boy did they ever do a good job. They have quite a complex group of flavors with roasted malt and a sweetness that I am guessing comes from the caramelized sugars, the hops dominate the back of the palate.

The finish was a lemony chocolate with a tinge of bitterness.  A different beer as it warmed up coupled with a chicken meal and a salad mixed with cheese. The smell became a radiant molasses-chocolate. The finish deepened now into molasses-chocolate with the slight bitterness remaining.

10099,1161,hagbergl,4.24,"Finally, finally doing a proper review of one of my favorite beers of all time, Dogfish Head's Indian Brown Ale. Served in my Beer Geek Nation (watch the YouTube reviews!) tulip. The bottles are quite fresh, so these pack a nicely hoppy bite.  Appearance (4/5): Classic brown ale look. Billowy creamy head of tan foam. Three fingers. I really like the look of this one. Appearance tells me this one has adequate carbonation.  Smell (4.25/5): The IBA smells a bit roasty and caramelly. It has plenty of hop character to it and has some dark bready notes as well. It has depth to it without any alcoholic notes.  Taste (4.25/5): Classic brown ale notes with a nice hoppy punch greet the tongue straight off the bat. Lightly toasty, some black coffee notes, dark chocolate, dark bready malts, nice bitterness and dryness on the finish. This beer does an exceptional job of letting the brown ale character play off of the hops. . Pretty simple, which I love, since–when considering the alcohol content–it makes this one is a good beer to drink several of.  Mouthfeel (4.25/5): Very creamy, more body than your average brown ale. Good carbonation. Medium. Like the label says, this beer has a nice ""clean"" feel to it and exhibits only the slightest bit of heat.  Overall (4.25/5): Dogfish Head's Indian Brown Ale is a class act: it has the roastiness and nuttiness that I love in a traditional brown while packing a robust hop punch that really adds some nice complexity, all without muddling the flavor profile.

10099,1161,TwinCreator,4.88,"I first tried this beer several years ago and have since turned many people on to it. I was looking for a good flavorful beer that wasn't too dark, too bitter, etc - this brown was just perfect. It's one of those beers where the hops/malt ratio is just right. There's definitely a sweet caramel flavor - maybe molasses sort of - but not too strong. It's a dark amber but not overly heavy. It's one of my favorite beers - it's sweet but not overdone and you're left with a great flavor. I can't say enough about what a great job Dogfish Head did on this Ale. Bravo!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,OWSLEY069,4.42,"Pours a deep amber to brown with a tan head. In the aroma, pine hops and a small caramel. In the taste, just like the aroma, pine hops and a caramel roasty sweetness. A hop bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry pine hop. Hops stand out more than expected with nice brown ale notes.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,jokemon,4.07,"Smell is sweet!! with a caramel and brown sugar notes to it.  Taste is impressive. There is a distinct hop presence which i don't expect from a brown ale but it is pleasant since it is very faint.  I want to drink this beer faster for some reason but the taste is powerful enough to stop me, there is a thickness to it.  Overall a very nice beer!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,TempeBeerMan,4.37,"Poured from a bottle into a dimpled mug.  A – Pours a clear very dark brown, with a nice fluffy two-finger head with great retention. Outstanding lacing.  S – Powerful aroma of roasted grain, bourbon, maple, peat moss, and molasses.  T – Taste follows the nose, with more roasted grain, and hints of black coffee, and bitter chocolate. Sweetness hinted at in the nose present as a balancing effect in the form of caramel and burnt marshmellow, but only faintly at first becoming more robust as it warms. Bitter piney hops present in the underbody from front-to-back. Nice balance overall. Tasty.  M – Thin, but also has a nice creamy quality. Medium to high carbonation. Finishes bone dry. The mouth feel works well with the style.  O – I found the whole package of this beer to be exceptional. Make no mistake – this is one dry and bitter beer! One of the finest “roasted grain” forward beers I have had, and surely one of the best balanced. I’ll be buying this again and again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,ummswimmin,4.32,"I picked up this bottle toward my goal of reviewing all 100 beers of fame. Hopefully this is a good offering, rather than the weird/crazy concoctions that DFH is known to make.  I poured this into a pint glass, and I immediately pick up coffee from the bottle. On top of the beer I smell more coffee, a little sweetness, and a touch of hops.  The flavor is more coffee, but it is not overwhelming. The sweetness does a good job to offset the bitterness. There is the slightest bit of hopping in the background.  This beer has really good balance. It was an interesting experience. I recommend picking up a six pack of this relatively easy to get beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,MichPaul,4.33,"I really like this beer! I was tipped off to this beer when I heard it suggested as a ""Coffee beer"". Then when I noticed the ""Brown"" in the name I started getting scared. I didn't like the other ""Brown"" that I tried, so I was worried this would be the same experience. It was not. Instead this tasted more like a Breakfast Stout to me. Typical dark brown, if not black color that pored very thin. This beer was high on carbonation which I didn't especially care for, but the taste really made up for it in the long run. This really reminds me of an Oatmeal stout which have become my favorites! First beer to review from Dogfish Head and I am happy so far!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,CPDalton,4.03,"Appearance: Dark brown with a small head and dissipates quickly, looks almost black.  Smell: A good wiff of malt and some light hops. The smell isn't too strong.  Taste: Starts off malty, then you get a little bit of the hop bite, and finishes with a dry, alcohol like flavor.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, not too thick or syrupy. Goes down pretty clean.  Overall: I'm a complete hophead and not a huge fan of brown ales, but their description inspired me to give it a try. Definitely one of my favorite browns so far, but the hop addict in me would like to see a little more bite and the end (like Sweetwater's Imperial Stout, Happy Ending). Good beer though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,ehammond1,4.24,"Bottle (2011)  Acquired via trade Thanks, MrHirschybar!  A very dark brown with no clarity throughout along with a surprisingly small dark brown head. This leaves thin ribbons of lace down the glass.  Roasted malt, chocolate malt, a bit of honey-like sweetness, and some bright hoppy character combine for a complete, balanced, enjoyable aroma.  The flavor is very nice--both well balanced and bold in flavor all at once. There's lots of chocolate and roasted malt character, a bit of biscuit, and some earthy and piney hop character. A complete, well-balanced, flavorful brown ale.  Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. No matter their other misgivings, Dogfish Head makes some damn good brown ales.  A really wonderful example of an oftentimes boring style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

S- Roasted Malt aroma with some hops shining through as well. Hints of coffee and caramel. A hint of booze.  T- Taste is not as roasty as the smell, but the roasted malt/coffee flavor is still present. It's a little sweeter on the mouth than the nose, well balanced. Finishes dry which is an interesting compliment to the flavor.  M- Solid medium mouthfeel and carbonation.

The hops also are present in the taste.  M – Decent level of carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. This beer is very drinkable.

It never fails to disappoint.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,ZSimon,3.96,"Pours a deep (rich?) mahogany with a thick, uneven, khaki head. This is the rare DFH where the smell is not a strength. Mostly deep chocolaty malt, not much charisma coming from slightly grassy-scented hops. Despite the uninspired nose, the taste delivers. Chocolate and barley sweetness strike first, followed by some raisins, and a lasting bitterness on the back end. Alcohol doesn't overwhelm, but it does let you know it's there.  ABAs and IBAs span a wide range of characteristics, and among the higher-abv offerings, this one falls towards the muted end of the range. If your scotch ales are too sweet or your ABAs are too thin, this may be your jam.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,denver10,2.9,"Dark brown with some ruby hues and a decent enough beige head that was a thumbs width. A roasty and earthy aroma, definitely get the IPA inflluence in this. That influence is quite prevalent in the flavor too, this is like no other brown I have ever had. To me this tastes like an IPA that a brown ale fell into. Very earthy and floral flavor with the roasted malt mixed in there as well as some coffee. Mouthfeel was very carbonated and active. Personally, not a fan of what is going on here. Executed well, I think, but I just did not like it. To me, I like my brown ales to be creamy, on the rich, sweeter side of things and this beer offer none of that.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,NoLeafClover44,4.2,"12 oz. bottle poured into a shaped dogfish pint.  A - Very dark mahogany, almost black, with ruby highlights when held up to the light. Creamy off-white head with mediocre retention. Nice lacing.  S - I get some coffee and burnt malts. There are some hops and a slight fruity character.  T - The toasty malts and coffee are powerful up front with a touch of nuttiness. Finishes a bit tart with mild lingering hops. Very complex blend of flavors, delicious.  M - Good carbonation with medium, velvety smooth body. A bit tingly on the tongue, but leaves a slick feeling after I swallow.  O - A great beer by Dogfish Head. I think their experimental brews are hit or miss, but this beer is an excellent staple to their lineup. The unique blend of flavors really works well, and I especially like the tartness on the back end. I avoided getting this beer for a while because something else always caught my attention, but I will definitely be adding this into my regular rotation.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,RyanLigeia,3.97,A very dark brown that is clear when held to the light adorning a small off white head.  Nice sweet smell. Smells like chocolate/caramel/toffee/coffee.  Has a sugary roasty coffee flavor. Sweet and malty with some hop bitterness at the end maybe? Has a unique lingering aftertaste that I cant put my finger on.  Body is on the heavier side but I wish it was a little thicker.  Overall this is a good beer and scores more points for its availability.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Darkmagus82,4.2,"Poured from bottle into pint glass.  Appearance – Pours a deep-brown color. Upon pouring there is a billowy tan head which forms which slowly fades over time to produce some nice lacing and a very thin persistent foam film on the top of the brew.  Smell – A huge caramel aroma meets the nose. While overwhelming at first, it gives away a bit, revealing aromas of roasty malt and a bit of nuttiness and some alcohol.  Taste – A semi-sweet malt flavor first hits, which seems to sweeten over time giving way to a very caramely flavor and some brown sugar. A roasted malt flavor with nice toasted nut and a little bit of of coffee flavors round out the taste, leaving a rather satisfying taste in the mouth.  Mouthfeel – The thicker body suits this beer quite nice. Mixed with the slightly liger carbonation it allows the brew to linger on the tongue; creating a very nice mouthfeel.  Overall – This is one very nice beer. While not the most potent, the sweet maltiness mixed with the thicker mouthfeel and roasty flavor make this a great brew to sit and sip slowly over a relaxing evening.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

A strong two finger tan head that fades rather quickly and leaves some drips and spots of lacing.  S- Bakers cocoa, burnt sugar, toasted marshmallow, spices and lite citrus notes. Hints of orange and grapefruit match so well with the roasted chocolate maltiness. Touches of roasted nuts. Pecans, walnuts, and almonds.  T- Bitter cocoa, roasted nuts, brulee'd sugar, and a piney/citrusy hop punch. Toasted marshmallow and wood smoke. A touch sweet, with a nice bitter punch to balance it out.  M- Creamy and dry at the same time. Decent carbonation. I love the blend of chocolate, roasted nuts and citrus.  O- Fantastic! Really nice blend of sweet, citrus, chocolate, and bitter. Nice nuttiness. No sence at all of the alcohol. This is a really easy drinker.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Sweet brown sugar up front with some caramel and burnt malts. Touch of smoke somewhere in the middle. Medium in body that thins out slightly on the finish. Finish balances the beer out though rather well. Some alcohol presence on the throat but not much. Flavors are all pretty subtle. Some maple syrup like sweetness upon licking the lips. Subtle notes of dark fruit with a certain citrus brightness somewhere in the middle.  Pretty complex brew with lots of flavors yet none of them over power. Something that could be pondered upon forever. A nice roastiness paired with good flavors makes this beer pretty unique. However I strive for a thicker body.

T - Really upfront with the maltiness, which is delicious. Mixture of sweet notes like chocolate, molasses, and caramel. Also a hint of coffee. Fresh hop notes at the finish, although not bitter in the slightest.  M - Full-bodied, although not fillingly so. I can say from experience this is an easy one to drink a few of. Alcohol is present, suprising considering this isn't a terribly boozy beer (7.2)  O - I really like this one. A unique mixture of things you don't typically find together in a beer, but I think this one is better off for it.

10099,1161,bcostner1,4.5,"A: Mahogany brown with a moderate tan head that leaves faint remnants atop the beer after it initially dissipates.  S: Brown sugar, maple, crisp hops, faint chocolate, faint maltiness.  T: Truly outstanding. Follows the nose with a strong presence of burnt brown sugar, some maple syrup. Definite presence of nuts as well. Faint chocolate and rich maltiness. There is definitely some coffee in there too. Hops come in at the end; they are not overdone but are present in just the perfect ratio to balance out the sweeter elements of the beer. This is really the most perfectly balanced brown ale I think I have ever had and, honestly, one of the most well balanced beers overall that I have tried.  M: Aggressive enough to present itself boldly on the palate yet easy drinking as well. This beer could easily be sessionable . The ABV is well hidden.  Overall, this is definitely one of my ""go to"" beers that I always try to have in the fridge. I hate that DFH pulled out of TN and that I can no longer get this locally.

10099,1161,angrybabboon,4.38,"Review adapted from notes taken 8/15/11  Appearance: Pours a nice, dark brown with a little beige head that lasts and lasts - nice lacing, too  Smell: Very roasted, with hops - malts reminiscent of roasted coffee, decidedly not burnt, with some chocolate - some lighter malts underneath, and some brown sugar - this works very well with the floral, leafy hops  Taste: Unique and very interesting - roasted, dry coffee, with dark chocolate - malts are nicely cooked, caramelized, with a perfect amount of sweetness - hops balance this with some citrus rind and floral notes - what's remarkable here is how well all of these flavors work together  Mouthfeel: Medium body, great amount of carbonation, crisp  Overall: Well-rounded and good in every aspect  Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for telling me to try this beer. I was skeptical, but after buying a 6-pack I became a believer. This is like a really good American Black Ale, but with a completely different (and really good) malt profile. And the hops hold up over time, too. I would probably have this in my fridge most of the time if Dogfish Head still distributed to RI (or if I weren't too lazy to drive north).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Dope,4.07,"Bottled 10/25/12, around 4 months old.  A: Pours a nice deep brown/red with a good sized and frothy light brown head. Head fades nice and slow with great retention. Substantial tufts of lacing on the glass.  S: Really nice toasty and nutty aroma. Some sweet caramel mixes in to balance it out. When swirled I get some citrus hop aroma as well.  T: Definitely some hop presence up front. Grapefruit mainly I'd say. Some sort of fruity element anyway. Nice caramel with toast and brown sugar. A little nutty too but mainly it's toast. Sweetness fades away into the finish, leave a bitter, almost burnt toast flavor with some bitter cocoa powder. A little resin in there too making it even more bitter. Almost feel like you have to scrape the burnt toast off of your tongue between sips.  M: Medium bodied, smooth but quite dry and bitter in the finish.  O: A very tasty hybrid style. I like hoppy beers, I like brown ales, and I like scotch ales and this all melds quite well.

Almost more like a porter, really. A hint of sweetness, caramel. Bitter coffee balances the sweetness out. Underneath all this, I could get maybe the slightest trace of grassy hops.

Slightly solvent and a touch astringent.  Overall Drinkability - A little too solvent/astringent at first. After a couple of beers though, those factors stopped playing a factor and later actually became a good point for the beer. Hops are suprising and unexpected at first, but become a bit more enjoyable when you find the balance of this offcentered beer. After initially rating this beer, I had a few more bottles from the 6pack and it started to grow on me so I bumped up the mouthfeel and overall by half a point each.

10099,1161,y2jrock60,4.39,"A- Extremely dark brown with an off white head. The head head retention and lazing is amazing.  S- Very rich roasted malt aroma with hints of dark chocolate and sugar.  T- Very well balanced, this beer has a lot going on. Sweet upfront followed by light roasted malt in the middle which leads into a mild bittersweet hop finish.  M- Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.  D- Highly drinkable, I think I found my new favorite American Brown Ale.  This beer definitely surprised me. I've only had DFH IPAs so I wasn't sure how their take on a brown ale was going to be. This is definitely delicious.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,TheDinger,3.87,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Being a big ABA fan, I had to try this brew. Beautiful deep, rich brown with a generous finger of tan head. Spottly lacing with minimal retention. Smell is of coffee, figs, raisins with some toffee/carmel notes on the end. Taste follows the nose with a pretty large kick of hops on the back end which I was not expecting. Lots of flavor and a little booze taste, but not overpowering. Coffee and fig notes dominate early and give way to bitter chocolate. Feel is that of a thick cream with some dry carbonation. A good balance on the tongue. Overall- More of a hybrid than a true ABA. Strong hops and a full body made it an interesting brown. Typically, not a hop head so it was a little bit of a distraction. Kind of a brown IPA. Wouldn't turn one down and merits a try for anyone. Interesting, unique and pretty tasty-",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,SideOrder,4.95,"Sam Calagione, owner of DFH Brewery, called this beer the ""unsung hero"" of the DFH lineup. At a brewery widely known for its justly-celebrated IPAs, this is the beer most often chosen by the DFH staff when it comes time for them to grab their monthly free cases.  This beer has something for everyone, without sinking to the lowest common denominator in any category. Very accessible, and like SN Pale Ale a great beer with which to introduce your BMC-swilling friends to craft beers. I've got it in my kegerator at the moment and have yet to offer it to anyone that, upon drinking it, hasn't uttered some version of ""Holy crap!""  A: A beautiful dark brown, almost black with ruby highlights. A finger of tan head subsides to a lacy covering that sticks to the glass and follows the beer all the way to the bottom.  S: Lots of freshly roasted coffee, hops, dark fruit and toffee. Wonderful, probably the greatest strength of this beer. I'm not sure whether to drink it or just keep smelling it.  T: Follows the nose to a T, but even more so.  M: Pretty crisp for a brown ale, in a good way. Coats the mouth nicely and sticks around for a bit without being obnoxious.  O: Amazingly well-rounded; definitely my desert island beer. As arguably the king of the American Browns, this is New England autumn in a glass, while being enjoyable year-round. Are there more earth-shakingly complex beers out there? Of course, but one wouldn't want to drink a big-ass quad or bourbon barrel-ed double stout every day, much less more than one or two in a sitting. This, on the other hand, is very drinkable (although its 7.2% ABV warrants a bit of caution) and, again, has something for nearly everyone.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,TheMultiYeast,4.35,"Pours a very dark brown with some rustic ruby sheen with a light behind it and a medium sized tan head.  Smell is sort of between a stout, IPA and brown ale. Rich blend of bittersweet chocolate and coffee with figs upfront. Plenty of toasted grain, raw honey, and an herbal fruitiness  Taste follows the nose into robust caramelized malt, mocha, and an outstanding bittersweet wave of hoppy resin...fades into a burnt aftertaste with some dryness.  Well bodied and thick, turning into an irony dryness.  Very tasty brown ale-hybrid. Highly accessible representation of DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,seanwhite,3.53,"A: Pours clear deep ruby with light brown head and great retention.  S: Aroma is coffee, nuts, raisin, chcolate, caramel.  T: Reminiscent of a nutty brown ale as well as a malt-rich scotch ale. Notes of dark caramel, molasses, wood, chocolate, coffee, and dried fruit dance across the palate and leave a warming boozy aftertaste. Body is medium, oily/creamy, low carbonation, roasty bittersweet finish.  Overall, a great beer that I have not had in years. Just proves that when DFH sticks to ""conventional"" beers, they can hit a home run every time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,pburland23,4.12,"Reviewed from notes.  Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a dimpled mug.  Pours a dark mahogany with two fingers of creamy, off-white head. Great head retention and decent lacing.  Smell is sweet and malty. Chocolate notes with some hints of smoky peat and dark candied sugar. There was also an unexpected and well received punch of citrusy hops. Great smelling beer.  Taste is malty. Not too sweet though. The Dogfish description of a brown ale/IPA/scotch ale hybrid is apt. It's a really nice blend of malty sweetness and hops bitterness.  Mouthfeel is middling. Sharp carbonation adds a creaminess to the beer. ABV is high for a brown ale, but particularly noticeable.  Overall, not a traditional American brown ale by definition, but when does Dogfish head stick to definition? Still, a very tasty pint. Proves that beer does not need to be exceedingly hoppy to be very flavorful.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,KickInTheChalice,4.33,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a DFH signature tulip.  Appearance: Indian Brown pours an almost black mahogany color with a few ruby highlights. A full tan head bubbles up initially into a sea foam froth consistency, but a small foamy film maintains for the entire glass. Specks of lace dot the glass.  Smell: There are a few different things going on in the nose. Sweet brown sugar and caramel malt notes are fairly sweet, roasted malt provides some cocoa flavors as well, and there are some bitter earthy notes to close it out.  Taste: The flavor also tilts toward the malty end of the spectrum. Some caramel sweetness mixed with toasted grains, some light cocoa, and a bit of peat start out. Although there is a sweetness present, it does not dominate. The flavor turns to a bit of burnt brown sugar, peat, cofffe, and some earthy notes in the middle. Toward the end, the earthy notes turn bitter and pick up a bit of citrus for some further bitterness.  Mouthfeel: For the style, this definitely has a nice, rich, full body. Creamy and smooth carbonation enhance the pleasant taste experience.  Overall: When I compare this to other American Brown Ales I have had in the past, a comparison is almost unfair. This is bigger, bolder, and more complex than what I have seen in the category.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

O: Just a remarkable dark beer in every way.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,droomyster,4.45,"Quite possibly the best brown ale on the market. An ale whose complexity and concentration levels break the mold and signal what the brown ale style could become, rather than echoing what it has been for the past several years. Pours a very dark brown with a rich and foamy tan head with excellent retention and lacing properties. Aromas are big on cocoa powder (the kind you stirred into glasses of milk as a child), with a woody, lightly roasted character that is reminiscent of a smore stick after performing its nightly duty. The taste consists of an indulgent but harmonious blend of a milk chocolate/ganache front palate with a burnt toast middle that gives way to a more aggressive, roasty beast-like finish of espresso and wood char. For those out there doubting the terminology of beer descriptions, this is a beer that displays some of nature's most basic flavors with crystal clarity.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

T- The roasted malt flavor dominate but not in a bad way. Chocolate and coffee notes come through. Hops leave some bitterness at the end but aren't too noticeable otherwise.

It looks pretty carbonation. Fizzy (sounds like rice crispies) tan colored head the pours a little over a finger and dies quickly. Specks of lacing left in the wake. Molasses semi-clear colored beer (reminds my gf of coke-cola).  T & M: Let me start off my saying I really enjoyed the take on the American Brown Ale style, I’m a huge fan of hopping these beers and Dogfish head pulled this one off pretty darn well. Similar to the nose, your getting a lot of the caramel, dark chocolate, nutty tastes which slowly bitter during the drink. The hops are at a perfect level of presence (there but not overtaking the main brown ale flavors). Carbonation is a bit high for my liking, almost at a tongue stinging level (its kind of a distraction to the beer). The carbonation dies down a bit, and the bodied is in the medium spectrum. Pretty drinkable  O: Overall I’m really happy with this beer! I can picture myself enjoying one of these mid-fall outside looking into a woods.

The beer pours a hearty brown color with some nice lacing left on the glass once a sip has been taken. A head dies to a tannish ring.  The smell is pretty decent, with some really nice dark malt with a touch of smokiness or roast, lots of fresh water scents as well which is interesting in beer. Some doughy malts as well, maybe just a flutter of hops.  The taste explodes with great grainy malt flavors and some nice resiny hops accenting a bittersweet finish. Some coffee and cocoa in there is really nice to undertone the malts as well. Just a nice overall balanced taste that is very interesting and complex in the malt profile compared to many brown ales, this thing almost reminds me of an american stout or porter in some ways with the roast and bitter sweet.

Appearance  While pouring I thought it was just gonna be a really dark brown. When it's in the glass it almost looks like a stout. Bright red highlights are around the edges and that's what makes it look like less of a stout. My head was practically nothing though. Carbonation is rising to top, but it doesn't really add to it's head.  Smell  The smell is mostly roasted malts and also possibly a dark chocolate smell as well. Dark fruits are present, raisins and figs. A pretty strong alcohol smell is in here as well.  Taste  Roasted malts and also a molasses caramel taste. It ends with a weird bitter taste though, it's like an odd Italian Roast style coffee.  Mouthfeel  It feels really smooth and slightly creamy. Mild body and mild carbonation.  Overall  The only other American Brown Ale I've had was Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar, but this brew feels nothing like it. This beast has so much more to offer. Maybe this just isn't my style of coffee that I enjoy. I like a French Roast, but this is just an Italian Roast to me. They are both coffee, but the style is just different.

Like a brown that wants to be a stout. Not sweet like you would expect from a beer made with caramelized sugar. Just a malt bomb with a bit of hops.

Citrus, a little pine, as well as a rich roasted malt profile (with hints of dark chocolate, caramel, bread) and a bit of dark fruits.  T - De-li-cious. The ""well hopped"" part really shines in this beer. I felt a pretty strong earthy hop punch at the first sip, then the roasted malts treated me to some sweet, slightly bitter, even burnt flavours. Hints of chocolate and caramel were present at all times. The finish is slightly dry and bitter, both from the hops and the roasted malts. Lingering chocolate and caramelised sugar notes. So much for a brown ale...  M - Medium body to it. Just enough carbonation to make it smooth yet not flat.

Easy to drink considering the 7.2% ABV and perfect for the cooler nights that are on the horizon. Cheers!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Slow forming tan head that organizes into a tiny head and then scatters, leaving traces of foam and some lacing.  A: Lots of sweet caramel candy aromas. Figs and milk chocolate. Light hop notes, mostly floral. Hazelnuts.  T: Sweet at first, like a hazelnut with a caramel drizzle and then dipped in chocolate. Subtle coffee tones. Over ripe fig flavors mid palate. The hops start to make the prescence known on the backend, with a creeping bitterness, again mostly floral. The bitterness is bolstered a bit by more coffee tones. Warming alcohols wraps it all up in a nice package.  A pretty good brown ale.

10099,1161,kemoarps,3.89,"pours a deep dark somewhere between black dark brown and like mahogany. No head to speak of  I don't really get much of anything off the nose, to be honest. The little I get is a fresh dark chocolate, with almost a rosy underpinning, and a subtle biscuit hint.  Luckily, the flavour does not follow in the footsteps of the smell. There is flavour there, and I'm glad for that, because it tastes damn good. It has a burnt character, with hints of bakers chocolate and raw espresso. The malt is expertly balanced by a not-overwhelming amount of hoppy bitterness. This is a complex, and very well made beer.  This beer belies it's 7% abv, and is not overly... well overly anything really. it's a well balanced brew that you can sip on easily (I wouldn't want to pound this one, for multiple reasons). The carbonation compliments the hop bite well, and it ultimately goes down well. Dogfish Head has a reputation of crafting exceptionally well made brews (one I feel they have absolutely earned), and this IBA is no exception. If they have this in your local area, pick it up.

Aroma is a malt upfront and slight hop in the background. The aroma is very subtle and my first nose gave me very little ... I had to work to get something.  Taste is a well balanced brown with some Scottish tones to it. I get some booziness to it which is just fine with me.  Mouth is full of carbonation and on the heavy body side.

The smell of this beer has a good amount of citrusy hops on the nose, with a more subtle aroma of chocolate malt. The taste of this beer is very hoppy, It's along the lines of some Black IPA's that are available these days. The flavors are sweet and bitter all at the same time. Pretty interesting stuff really.

10099,1161,cbarrett4,4.1,"Poured from bottle into Dogfish head rounded pint glass.  Lovely brown/amber hue with lots of persistent white head fading to a very pretty white lace. Very pretty beer.  The nose is complex and fun with noticeable hops framed by brown sugar, iced cafe au lait, wood, spice, and caramel. The nose displays all of this without coming off as being too sweet or cloying.  On the palate you definitely get the hop oil with some caramel, wood, and spice. A little less complex taste than the palate suggests.  Mouthfeel is rather odd but enjoyable. Aggressively hoppy but with a hint of sweetness. It's good but slightly disjointed. Finishes long but the hops seem to kick out the brown ale notes.

Sweet milk coffee up front along with lightly toasted malts. Some burnt caramel in the middle. Raisins as well make an appearance. Not as much hops pulling through as advertised. Very coffee like. Sweet brown sugar with bitter hop balance through the middle. Sweet dark fruits give it some depth. Ends with a burnt coffee finish and a alcohol warmth that lingers for awhile. Feels creamy.

A strong pour yields a 2-finger creamy tan colored head that fades after a good few minutes to a thick dusting and thick foam ring. The body is a deep mahogany brown with traces of blood red when held to light. Light lacing can be seen clinging to the glass sides, but is a little heavy for good amounts to cling indefinitely.  The nose is absolutely delicious. Bold and rich, it has aromas of dark roasted malts, molasses, caramel, espresso, and toasted nuts. Undoubtedly, there is more in there, but I can't just sit here smelling this beer all day.  Dark roasted malts give a slight creamy sweetness to the beer. Notes of Columbian coffee, milk chocolate, and roasted nuts give a very rich and dark flavor. A slight alcohol warmth develops in the far reaches of the throat though it is almost unnoticeable.  Full bodied with great carbonation, this beer has an almost creamy quality. The body is a bit thick and sticky for the style, but is fitting for the bold flavors.

10099,1161,jondeelee,4.62,"Has a nutty, brown sugary aroma, with hazelnut and deeply-toasted grain notes, as well as a promise of hops.  On the tongue, there's a simultaneous assault of hops and malts, with waves of bitterness and sugary goodness coming at you from all fronts. On the bitter side, there's the pronounced grapefruity buzz of hops, which come in with the strength of a lighter IPA, as well as the more subtle rosewater tastes that come with addition of the whole leaf. On the malty side, there are definite caramelized brown sugar threads in the tapestry, along with caramels, vanilla, fruit esters, and deeply-toasted (almost chocolate) grains. The sugariness of the brew lasts for quite a while, dropping off precipitously near the end to reveal a deep belly of almost-burnt malts. Then, right at the end of the aftertaste, the sugars kick back in for one more sweet blat of the trumpet.  Overall, this is a fantastic ale, and it's obvious that the brewers have put in far more time and care--as well as ingredients--than most other breweries would dream of.

10099,1161,Groomsy,4.23,"12 oz. bottle with bottling date of 04/05/11, poured into a nonic. Single for $2.49 bought at Ozzy's in Waverly, OH.  Appearance: Dude, this almost looks like a porter! Incredibly dark brown body with hints of garnet and ruby barely coming through, topped by a sticky, long-lasting head of khaki foam, which never totally fades away. Some carbonation was evident, though hard to see. Gobs and webs of sticky lacing all over the glass. A great looking brew.  Smell: Ohh, momma. A high class brown ale. The smell only gets better as the beer warms. I first pick up the roasted malt, which is then followed by big notes of bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and lingering in the back, ever so slight, some smokiness and caramel/sugar smells. There is some hop presence detectable in the form of some grassy/herbal notes, just enough to balance the sweetness and malt in the nose.  Taste: I pick up some herbal/piney hops on the forefront of the tongue, which quickly gives way to roasty malt flavors, followed by dark chocolate, and just a hint of nutty caramel (from the brown sugar, I guess?), coffee, and dry smoke. Some roasted flavors and more grassy bitterness lingers into the clean finish. There's just enough hops to balance the ridiculous amount of flavor from the malt, and this comes off as a very complex but balanced beer. Great stuff, very complex.  Mouthfeel: For an ale of this complexity and flavor, this beer is actually medium bodied with some crisp carbonation, especially in the finish. Fairly dry finish from the hops, but done very cleanly.  Overall: Probably one of the best - if not the best - American brown ale I've had so far. The hop schedule and malt profile builds an incredible amount of complexity and enjoyable flavors into this beer. Definitely try it out - Sam Calagione said that this beer was sort of the ""underdog"" of DFH's year-round offerings, and I agree; this is just as much worth trying as 60 Minute or 90 Minute.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

This is one of my favorite craft beers I’ve had so far and can’t wait to try more from Dogfish Head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

The flavor has a lot of coffee in it as well as some nice bitterness from the piney hops. I also get some roasted malt and some chocolate in the flavor. Overall, the mouthfeel is a little bit creamy and the carbonation is low to medium. A great brown ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Some smoke, and a little bit of herby hops.  T: Similar to the nose. The malt is in the forefront here. Some licorice and caramel. There's some dark fruit coming though, something like fig. A little bit of coffee and hop bitterness at the end.  m: Smooth with a good amount of carbonation.  O: I picked this up as a single bottle for just 1.70. It was definitely worth it.

T: Roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, with a nice smokiness. Even a tad bit of a coffee flavor.  M: Medium body with moderate carbonation. Smooth and creamy.

Pours a big dark deep cola color nearly black into a pint glass. When held to light becomes transluscent & thin dark brown. I poured aggressively - so big coffee khaki head fine bubbles comes up but dies down in a matter of seconds.  The nose on this one is rather mild. I get a roasted coffee grounds & caramel scent - but it is a very shy one.  Roasted nuts, roasted coffee, caramel malts, and mild milk chocolate come through in the front to mid palate. The back end is where those liberally & often hops comes through nicely. Its not overbittering, but rather earthy oily touch at the back of the throat that compliments the roasted character of the beer very well. A finesse of an exclamation point at the end here. Love it. Hides the 7.2% abv very well.  Body is moderate to heavy (7/10) & well carbonated. Any less carbonation wouldnt do the hoppy finish any good & any more carbonation would take away from the roast characters here.  Served in pint glass.  12oz bottle at $1.99, or a 6pak at $10.49 - worth every penny.

Smells wow.. perfect sweet roasty malt goodness and the brown sugar definitely comes out. Taste follows all the way, it is smooth and perfect feeling. This is a beer that I had in the past but I didn't like it in the past.

Light floral hops in the background.  This is highly balanced, with hops shining through on the end. A feint taste of dark fruit comes through, which was missed in the nose.  This is a smooth, well carbonated beer. The 7% ABV is hardly detectable.  I really enjoy this beer, as it deviates quite a bit from the typical brown ale with its hopiness and higher ABV.

Lots of obvious carbonation in the glass. Really looks tasty!  S - fresh bready malt on the nose with just a hint of sweet caramel.  T - hint of initial bitterness makes way for a delightful caramel and licorice malt. Really well balanced with just enough bitterness to offset the sweet malts. Taste lingers for ages on the back of the tongue.  M - slightly thick with lots of velvety carbonation. The alcohol is hidden well.  D - super drinkable and simply deliciious. Deadly!

10099,1161,VncentLIFE,4.2,"Thanks twaddlac for the case! Per his recommendation I tried it both cold and warm, and I'm reviewing it about 50 degrees.  Appearance - very dark brown just slightly lighter than guiness. Thin white head.  Smell - Dark fruits and slight caramel sugars as well as mild hops and slight alcohol smell.  Taste - complex flavor that mixes well. At first the roasted malt battles for the win. Next comes the dark prunes and figgy flavor that are taken over by alcohol and the slight hops kill the sweeter flavors.  Mouthfeel - oily texture gives way to an aftertaste of a nutty roasty malt that sticks around begging for you to drink more.  Overall - the best warm beer I've ever had. Highly drinkable for the 7 percent ABV. Too bad I can't find it in Ohio! I shall enjoy the rest of the 6 I have left!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,MouthFullOBeer,4.5,"Poured from a refrigerated bottle into a room temperature pint glass.  Pours a dark brown color that appears to be a deep, rich red when held to the light. The head is a uniform tan or beige foam.  A roasted nut or coffee aroma is very dominant, with very subtle hints of citrus hops. The aroma is powerful enough to fill the air as soon as the beer is poured.  The first thing that came to mind when I took my first sip (which took a while since I was enjoying the smell so much) was that it tasted a lot like a porter. Roasted coffee and nut flavors follow the aroma on the front of the tongue, accompanied by a very light caramel taste and faint buttery hints. The porter quality subsides slightly and it starts feeling and tasting more like a brown. As the beer glides down your throat, the roasted flavors slowly give way to a pronounced citrus hop aftertaste at the back of the tongue. This citrus dominance is brief, however, as the roasted flavor returns, coming out through the aftertaste and quickly overpowering the citrus.  It has a mouth feel that somehow manages to be both creamy and spicy. It warms up your mouth and feels as if it is expanding as it sits on your tongue, looking for a way out. This makes it feel very lively and vibrant.  As the beer approaches room temperature, the coffee flavor subsides slightly and the roasted nut flavor takes over.  On a more subjective note, I've had some very good experiences with Dogfish Head, as well as some less pleasant ones. But this beer is absolutely delicious. I'm already upset that I don't have any more in the house. I'm looking forward to getting some more tomorrow. I would definitely recommend this beer to anyone, whether they are just remotely interested in trying brown ales for the first time or if they drink browns more exclusively.  Pairs exceptionally well with very thinly sliced extra sharp cheddar cheese. I'm looking forward to trying it with some smoked Gouda.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Monkey962,3.82,"Appearance: An inky black brew. Light that shines through is a lovely Merlot red. The head is creamy, light brown, and is about one finger high. It doesn't stick around for long, but leaves thick bands of lacing on the glass.  Smell: Was this bottle labeled wrong? Smells very similarly to a stout, with strong notes of roasted coffee beans, though definitely smells sweeter than a stout, as a result of the brown sugar notes throughout. I get an occasional metallic whiff, that I imagine stems from the yeast.  Taste: Initial refreshing grassy notes that soon settle down. Mild brown sugar that balances well with the slight hop bitterness. In fact I was surprised how well-balanced this beer is, as I usually figure DFH brews to be on the hoppier side. A slightly metallic taste comes up after you've been holding it in your mouth for a bit. A very pleasant sweet aftertaste that sits well on the palate, as some beers with more pronounced sweetness tend to have sickly sweet aftertaste. Tastes of more of the brown sugar, a slight 'crinkly' coffee flavor, and dry, bready crackers.  Feel: Carbonation is minimal and recedes quickly. Silky smooth.  Overall: This is the first American Brown Ale I've had, so I have little to compare it to. However, on its own, it's an extremely tasty brew while the smell and taste aren't hugely spectacular, they're well-balanced. The aftertaste however, is lovely and invites back for another sip or swig.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Smell: It carries floral / earthy hop aromas transfused with a chocolate, caramel malt sweetness. Unique balance presented here.  Taste: The hops give way to earthy elements carried within a bready, sugary burnt quality that also incorporates a nutty / oily characteristic. Complexly put together.

Good initial lacing.  S: Nutty milk chocolate. Faint coffee beans. Not strong, but oh-so-enticing.  T/M: Sweet, smooth, and creamy. The maintaste is, as the smell suggested, full of nutty malts. Brief and sweetish. The relative mediocrity of the main flavour is redeemed by an aftertaste with a distinctive coffee bitterness, almost like a stout.  O: Not my favourite Dogfish Head, but it's a darn good brown ale. Very drinkable for the ABV, and increasingly drinkable as time and beer passes.

There was an intermittent floral hop aroma coming through in between the dominant caramel aroma. Smooth, surprisingly very smooth. Silky mouthfeel, coats the palate beautifully.

I was having a ben & jerry's, ""maple blondie"" ice-cream, and surprisingly it paired really well with this ale. In spite of being 7.2% ABV, the alcohol is masked really well, and is easy to drink.

It's been sometime since I had this brew and reflected on it, but this just feels like great things are coming.  Simple straight forward coffee and roast. Aromatics all come through in the palate, but more so a taste of roasted coffee on the finish with a lingering bitter.

Fantastic retention. A thin film stayed around until the beer was nearly finished. Large drippy blocks of thick lacing stuck all down the glass.  Lots of sweet caramel malts came through in the nose. Some brown bread too. A bit of coffee. Possibly some brown sugar. Semi-sweet for the style. Slightly fruity. As the beer warmed, the aroma became even more robust. The coffee presence really came forth.  The flavor profile was crisper and drier than the aroma. Malty up front. The malts had a very European (possibly German) sort of taste to them. Nutty and slightly fruity in the center. Coffee was again noticeable. Lots of earthy, herbal hops came through in the surprisingly bitter finish. The quantity of hops seemed very American but the style of hops seemed very European. A touch of smoke was detectible as well. As for drinkability, the 7.2% ABV was incredibly well hidden.  As much as I enjoyed this beer, I was disappointed by the mouthfeel. It was thinner than I anticipated with a prickly, large bubbled effervescence.

Has a really foamy head that devolves to a half-finger layer with lovely lacing on the edges of my pint glass.  I'm slow to get to Dogfish Head beers for some reason. They're ubiquitous here in Atlanta. I love their take on IPAs that's for sure, with the 60 and 90 minute hopped IPAs being favorites. This one may be a little bit of a challenge for my newbie palate as it seems to draw from several types of ale. I mean challenging in a very positive sense.  Semi-sweet chocolate and caramel aroma hit me immediately. The hops are less accessible (but are present). Roasted malt, brown sugar and hops (as advertised) are the primary flavors. The hops aren't the ones I'm used to drinking so it's really a great, unique drinking experience. You could call this a hoppy brown ale, a stout, a porter or even a black IPA if you wanted to. Why get caught up on genres, though? This is a delicious ale that should appeal to almost everyone. I can see it being a great change of pace ale, but possibly not one you'd easily find in a traditional British pub. It's definitely got an American influence.  The mouth feel is slightly heavier than most brown ales, but less so than a stout or porter. It's ABV is slightly higher than normal for even an American brown ale.

Some nut and barley even comes out.  Taste - Hoppy, bitter, sugary with carmal and toffee flavors. What a mess this is. This needs to be one style not many into one. The bitterness really throws off the sweetness caramal brown ale taste. The scotch/oak flavor comes in at the end cause all the other flavors overpower it.  Mouthfeel - The beer is thin but the flavors are overboard. Too much going on to enjoy. The sweet/bitter/oaked/ boldness is too much. Mouth is worked out, palette is coated with a mess.  Overall - I dont get it. I respect dogfish in making unique flavored beers but most of these beers are highly flavored unbalanced bombs. This beer has so much going on, you cant enjoy just the style it is, rather you get a monster overly sweet flavor crushing you each drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,3dudesbeerblog,4.45,"Using a Snifter, this lady poured out tall and dark, boasting a one finger head of light amber foam.  The nose is overwhelmed my malts and light notes of hops and woodiness. But as the first drink comes in you realize this lady isn't as sweet as she seems.  Hops flood the palate. They are then flanked by a malts creating a smooth sweet flavor displaying a hoppy finish, lingering as if you were sipping an IPA.  The Indian Brown Ale's medium body and mild carbonation worked well with its malty essence leaving a pleasant feeling across your palate.  Indian Brown Ale is a cross between a scotch ale, american brown, and an IPA. This beer distinguishes great qualities from each style of beer. The aroma of a scotch ale blended with the crisp hoppyness of an IPA followed by the smooth malt character of a brown ale.  I want another.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,thebrood1987,4.78,"I've already reviewed this in the bottle but since my local Spirits had this on tap I decided to fill my 64oz growler with it. On the smell I get chocolate, some dark fruits, a touch of alcohol, a bit of molasses and some earthy hops on the back of the smell. The taste is very rich and creamy with a very nice roasted chocolate taste that turns into a slight coffee caramel taste towards the middle and then ending with the bitterness from the roasted malts and hops they use. The main difference from the on tap version and bottle version is that it seems more rich and has a bit more of a hop bite.  What a delicious beer on tap or in the bottle. Definitely an underrated Dogfish Head beer. This is easily the best brown ale I've ever had in my life and that's pretty much because its so rich and creamy and has that nice hop bite and some of that IPA bitterness on the aftertaste that you get in no Brown Ales. This is pretty close to a Black IPA and actually tastes better than most I've had. The only other brown ale I've had that comes close to this is their Palo Santo Marron but I like this better because it reminds me more of an IPA on the finish and is more drinkable.  This beer is the best of both worlds very creamy rich chocolate caramel malts with the bitterness from the hops and roasted malts rounding off the beer. Also, the alcohol is more noticeable on the smell then the taste which I was happy about.

Overall: Why did it take me so long to try this one? I know they advertise this as part ipa, but the hops are minimal. Indian Brown is right up there with the best in the style.

I poured the 12oz bottle into a snifter to find a deep, dark brown body with an one inch tan head. The aroma has roasted malts, hints of chocolate and hints of caramel.  The taste is very good, it has the bitterness you would expect upfront, but it is very well balanced with the chocolate and sweetness from the caramel.  The mouthfeel is a bit on the sticky side, you notice the carbination but the alcohol is masked very well.  Overall a good beer, another solid beer from Dogfish Head.

10099,1161,diabecktic,4.42,"Appearance: This dark brownish-ruby ale pours with ~2 fingers of light brown head which retains fairly well. When held to a light, there is plenty of rising carbonation which is just barely visible. Lacing is quite good.  Smell: I detect a rich, dark, sugary malt with some nutty undertones. This complex aroma also features floral notes and plum. I can't smell too much with respect to spices, but I can pick up a hint of butter and hops.  Taste: The sensation largely mirrors the nose, but I am able to pick out more attributes in the malt. I think that the malt resembles brown sugar, caramel, and plum with a hint of dark chocolate. Notes of butter and nut are present towards the end of a sip. Both alcohol and hops are well-hidden.  Mouthfeel: I would rate the body as medium. The malty sugars add some density to the beer, but I don't feel as if I'm drinking something akin to a Russian Imperial Stout. Hops become more apparent in the aftertaste, as there is just a tinge of dry bitterness which leaves me wanting more.  Overall: This is yet another excellent release from Dogfish Head. I feel that this beer both represents the style well and features an excellent assortment of complex flavors that ultimately yield a well-balanced product with a great deal of character. If you don't particularly like the style, then you should try this for the sheer composition of flavors because it seems as if there's a bit of everything except citrus!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,mjpolzin,3.71,"I have had this beer before and really liked it but had never reviewed so I figured I would have one again and make a point to note some of the things I liked about this beer. Since I last had this beer, I have had DFH's Palo Santo Marron and when I took my first drink of the Brown Ale, I noticed that it tasted a lot like PSM but with a lot less alcohol. That makes this one a lot more drinkable as you can have a couple as opposed to the Palo which has a pretty high abv.  Beyond that initial impression, the color is a nice dark brown. The taste is just the right amount of hoppiness for a brown ale and you get just the right amount of bite from the alcohol for a 7ish abv beer. I almost get some smokiness and possibly a little bitter chocolate taste.  With Dogfish Head pulling out of Wisconsin, I need to pick myself up one more six pack of this before I can't find it here anymore.  EDIT-I still have a six pack of this beer that I stashed away once DFH brews weren't available in Wisconsin anymore. After cracking one open the other night, the thing that struck me the most was how complex this beer was. I got so many different tastes, it was interesting to take more sips and see what I could taste. That said, once Dogfish Head pulled out of Wisconsin, I was ""forced"" to find new beers to drink and I found that DFH isn't all I thought it was cracked up to be.

Very, very rich (slightly toasted) toffee and caramel malt flavor providing a canvas upon which cinnamon and milk chocolate tones dance, creating a cascade of spice and sweetness. No detectable alcoholic presence. Smells like a stout...very, very nice.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Beer is rich and creamy as it enters the palate. Malt perfection lays down a foundation, and chocolate love builds a home on top of that. Mild carbonation carries slight plum/nutmeg/nutty characteristics through a river of sweet, sweet malt.

Other aspects are fine though.  Overall - This is a very well made, flavored and balanced brown ale. Seems to be more in the British Ale style than American Brown (just my opinion) 7.2% alchohol is strong for this style but its well disguised in taste (but you definitely feel it after 1 beer).

The hops was there in the middle. The finish was a burnt offering. The aftertaste was so so.  M) I'd have to say clean and crisp. Perhaps a little heavier on the palate than other brown ales.

10099,1161,StoutHunter,4.12,"I picked up a single of this for $1.75 at the Lager Mill. I have always overlooked Dogfish Head, but recently I tried the 90 minute IPA and I liked so I figured I should see what else they have to offer. No visible bottling date. Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a imperial pint glass.  A- The label is rather simplistic with a small description of the beer and a grain background. This beer poured a very deep dark brown that is bordering on black. It had a fingers worth of off white head that died down to a thin ring that stayed the rest of the time and left some spotty lacing.  S- I Pick up lots of dark roasted malts at the start followed by some dark fruits. There is a sweetness in the aroma that reminds me of molasses and works well with the robust roasted malts. I pick up a little grassy and citrus hops, but not as much as I expected. The smell is way toastier then I thought, I was thinking this was a cross between a scotch ale and an IPA but it smells more like a hybrid of a stout, scotch ale and pale ale.  T- Wow... this tastes pretty good. At first I get hit with the roasted malts that impart a nice chocolate and coffee flavor. In the middle I am hit with that signature sweet dark fruit taste that is reminiscent of a scotch ale. I was expecting this to be somewhat hoppy, and it really wasn't, there was just a mild presence of grassy hops at the end and it didn't finish bitter at all.  M- Full bodied, creamy, and it had mediocre carbonation.  Overall this was a pretty damn good brew and I enjoyed it. BA claims this an American Brown ale, but after tasting it I really don't see many similarity's. I really don't know what to classify this as, its like a cross between a porter and a scotch ale. Whatever the hell this beer is really doesn't matter too much cause in the end it tastes damn good. The flavors were complex and balanced very well, I was expecting this to be pretty hoppy and it wasn't and I liked that. I feel if it had more hops then there would be too much going on and it would make it a mess. I would for sure buy this again and I would recommend it to anyone who likes dark, roasty, and full bodied beers.

A bit of peat smokiness comes by at the start of the finish, which is paired with some bitter hops. Tastes good for sure, but nothing to wow me.  This brew's weak point is the mouthfeel. It's very smooth, but feels a bit unsubstantial for the flavors presented beforehand. The drinkability is quite good though, and the ABV is completely hidden. Overall, this was a pretty alright brew. Not my favourite, I feel that everything never quite comes together like it should, but it's still a pretty good brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,woodychandler,4.65,"I found this last night in the singles cooler at my local bottle shop and since the stamp on the neck read ""Bottled on 12/08/10"", it did not set off any flags and so I decided to shoot the works. I am awaiting the arrival of my local trader and this may help me to pass the time.  My pour initially created a finger of deep-tan head with limited retention. Nose was heavy with chocolate, like putting my sniffer into a can of Hershey's Cocoa Powder as I did when I was a kid. Color was a deep brown with ruby highlights. Beautiful! Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a melange of cocoa, coffee, charcoal roastiness and some alcohol heat. Zounds! This was like a jolt of coffee to restart my evening accompanied with enough alcohol to send me to slumberland. Mymymy. Finish reminded me of my morning coffee, personally blended by yours truly to mimic the coffee I was weaned on in the Navy. My students often remark on how its odor fills the room. This was filling me nicely. I am really glad that I stumbled on this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,dmfrench,4.27,"Creamy, hoppy, spicy, dry, cocoa... almost Porter ___  A: Very dark ruby, in low light appears black, with a somewhat persistent two finger creamy taupe head.  S: Loads of highly roasted malt with coffee and cocoa notes, brown sugar, and vibrant earthy spicy hops. If it weren't for a certain nutty fruitiness, I'd swear I was smelling a Porter. Warming brings out more hops and makes thing a bit more brown-like.  T: Again, I'd swear I was drinking a Porter except for the slight toasted nut flavor... earthy, spicy and dry hops dominate the palate, with roasty cocoa and coffee in the background. Sugar is another big component, and there's a slight metallic taste. Reminds me of a fulller bodied but not as great tasting Edmund Fitzgerald Porter. Quite a stretch for the Brown style, but that's DFH.  M: Creamy and full with pleasantly high carbonation and a good grainy texture that sticks to the tongue well.  O: Not neceesarily what I'd reach for when looking for a Thanksgiving Dinner Brown or something, but still, an interesting if not stretched interpretation... tickles my Porter bone much more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,ChugginOil,4.45,"When poured, deep mahogany welcoming liquid shows off and settles black. An ample amount of off white head fluffs atop the dark brew.  Within the noseI pick up on subtle sweet and toasty malt blended with chocolate, oak, and a bit of vanilla.  Chocolate, molasses, oak, and vanilla up to bat first with some nice sweet malts on deck. I like the balance between these flavors. As it warms, these flavors become bolder and bolder.  The mouthfeel is pretty creamy but isn't ""sludge"" at all. It is smooth and works my palate very gently.

The aroma begins with a roasted malt smell and finishes with brown sugar. In between I get a touch of toffee and chocolate.  Very interesting mix of flavors for an Indian Brown and they are very well blended. Roasted malt, molasses, slighlty bitter hops, chocolate, coffee, caramel. Complex and very tasty.  Thin to medium mouthfeel and fairly high carbonation. A very good brew that is the best brown ale I've had.

10099,1161,Beergeeknut,4.35,Appearance: From a twelve ounce bottle then into a pint glass. On top is a solid one and a half fingers of head that is beige in color. Underneath is a dark brown nearly black beer.  Aroma: Roasted malts out of the gate. A little bit of cocao or even some bakers chocolate. Caramelized sugar with burnt notes. The hops are roasted quite dark giving off a floral as well as citrus hop notes.  Taste: There is a bit of a hop bite at the start but it mellows out to a smoother more chocolaty mouthfeel it does this well. Citrus hops are in the front in the middle is a roasted maltiness with a cocoa flavour to it. At the end is a smooth finish with a nice hint of dryness.  Notes: This one has a robustness to it that sets it apart from alot of other American brown ales. Very tasty. Cheers.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,rawfish,3.65,"Pours mahogany with a sand colored head as tall as you want it. Frothy bubbles with good retention, leaves spots of lacing in the glass.  Aroma is of earthy and herbal hops backed by molasses and candied dark fruit. Deep roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate and slight coffee. Rather strong.  Taste backs the nose, herbal hops throughout the drink, drying and bitter with a lactic sourness on the finish from the roasted malts. Rather sweet with caramelized brown sugar and more deep cocoa richness. Reminds me more of a hoppy porter than that of a typical brown ale, roasted malt character is very strong. Smooth on the drink but burning alcohol after.  Creamy smooth mouthfeel, though the hops aren't so much crisp as they are balanced. Rather heavy slightly syrupy sweet with decent carbonation.  This beer has DFH trademark stamp of bringing out the ABVs but with all the flavor that comes with it. Tries to act as a hybrid scotch ale, IPA and American Brown and does it well enough but lets call it a hoppy porter and drop the act.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

S: Smells of chocolate at first, then heavy maltiness, scotch, and coffee beans.  T: Malty like a scotch ale with sweet nuttiness like a brown. Strong grassy hops underneath with a chocolatey backbone. This is amazing.  M: Creamy but not thick. Lightly coats the mouth.  D: It's more of a hoppy scotch ale than a brown but either way its great.

S: This is a good smelling beer. Brown sugar and raisins dominate the nose. Also present are some malty scents and a slight alcohol smell.  T: The sip begins with the sweetness of caramelized brown sugar. Hearty malt and some hop flavor overtake the sweetness in the middle enveloped by a thin plume of smokey flavor. The sip ends with slight alcohol.  M: The beer feel is thick, almost a little syrupy in the mouth accompanied by prickly carbonation.  Overall, this is a good beer. I believe Dogfish Head accomplishes what they set out to do with this beer, as the first though after the initial sip is ""interesting"". But, with this beer it is a good interesting.

Smell wise, I pick up on some molasses and earthy notes and a little bit of malt and finishes with a hoppy smell. Not too much going on here I am actually pretty surprised at how bland this smells.  Flavor wise it really starts to pick up, you get the thick, viscous and creamy character from the malts and then there is some hops bite that comes in at the end. A very well blended brew, the hoppy bite at the end makes for a nice finish, otherwise this would be much more like a stout.

It tasted mildly sweet, malty and slightly bitter with just a hint of caramel and coffee at first and finished with a nice dark bitter coffee flavor that lasted a nice long time.

Taste: Tastes like a malty, boozy porter to me. I do not get much in the way of hops from this ""well-hopped"" brown ale. Definitely taste the caramel and dark malts. A bit of a spicy coffee flavor.

I might be able to smell hops if my sinuses were clearer.  t: this is where the similarities to a stout are a bit less pronounced. the malt isn't nearly as strong as the appearance or smell would suggest, although that is the first taste recognizable on a sip. in all honesty I was expecting a wider extreme of flavors, but I think the subtlety of tones was a wise decision. the 7.2% ABV is very well masked - tastes like 5% or less. flavors detectable are nuts/malt and chocolate/hops in that order.  m: medium-low carbonation, creamy, and even milky if it lingers for a while. mouthfeel is similar to a stout though slightly more carbonated from what I've tasted.  d: pleasantly surprised by how easy this was going down.

It's just a nice balance of the two from start to finish.  M: I'm gonna say it tends to have a medium body and as I stated before, nicely balanced on the bitterness and malt.

One finger of tan head dissipates quickly. Leaves a light to moderate amount of lacing on the glass, more than typical of a brown ale. Smell is an initial blast of dark malts evolved into an oatmeal-raisin cookie and finished with a bitter bite at the end.  Taste is complex and well rounded. Sweet upfront flavors of brown bread with a hint of candy dates and prunes. Followed by a bitter, citrus hop kick that dries the palate and readies you for another sip. Mouthfeel is slightly sticky and viscous. An easy drinker for such a high ABV within the style. My glass went empty rather quickly, but not something I would want to drink back to back.  One of the most complex brown ales I've ever had and my favorite in an extremely underrated style. My favorite beer for a fall BBQ, pairs exceptionally well with a wide variety of foods. Aged it takes on the qualities of a porter. A well crafted beer and tremendous value at $7.99 a sixer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Smells include coffee, chocolate, sugar  The taste is of toffee, lightly roasted nuts, and is very well balanced. A nice amount of bitterness at the beginning present alongside a rather sweet finish, giving way to more bitterness in the aftertaste. The taste is reminiscent of dark chocolate.  Mouthfeel is great. Very well carbonated and a much heavier than I would expect a brown ale to be. The excellent mouthfeel combined with a very nice taste make for one very drinkable beer.

Poured a small, creamy looking dark tan head which dissipated quickly.  Smell- Coffee jumps out at me in a big way and overshadows everything else. Little bit of hop aroma and a hint of something sweet too.  Taste- Again, first impression for me is coffee. But here you get to pick up on some things that the smell only hints at: some hops, molasses, and brown sugar going on. It starts dark and strong and sweetens a bit as you go.  Mouthfeel- Medium thickness, pretty steady carbonation that lasts.  Drinkability- A very solid beer, and one you'll probably be able to drink a couple if you want.

I poured it into an Imperial pint glass and here's what I found:  Pours a deep reddish-brown with a coffee and cream-colored head which starts frothy and retreats to a thin layer with lacing. An inviting-looking pint.  The burnt sugar is easily noticed in the initial aroma -- some caramel, maybe toffee, sort of like a Tootsie Roll? (it's been a long time since I ate one of those.) But the dominant aroma that follows is coffee -- not espresso or really dark coffee, more like a really good automatic brew.  Mouthfeel is smooth, but not overly so, with a decent amount of fizz at the back end. The hops doing their work. An interesting ride.  Taste -- the aroma doesn't lie one bit. The sugars are there. So's the coffee -- so much so that this could easily be a dessert pairing. While there's a heaping helping of hops in here, it's balanced more towards the sweetness.  Drinkability: Very. I had this beer with dinner -- a few slices of pork roast, vegetables and a home-baked bread. Not the precise pairing I'd imagine, but I could see downing a few of these all by their lonesomes, too. I'd like to try it again with some dessrt and see if my hunch is correct.  Overall: Deserves the high grades that it gets, like most of DH's offerings.

10099,1161,zoso493,4.23,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle from 12/07/10 into a Guiness tuliped pint glass.  Appearance: India Brown Ale pours a deep but not at all opaque cola brown color. When held up the light, some brilliant ruby shades emerge. A mild pour can only generate a half-finger head that dissipates quickly, leaving just a few tinges of lacing on the glass.  Smell: Maybe it's the lack of a head, but I'm struggling to get a good grasp of the scents in this one. There some to be some typical light malts but also the nice scent of coffee that some brewers choose to put in the brown ales.  Taste: One sip lets me know that this is a very nice example of an American brown ale, and definitely a unique one. The lighter malts are there, but the coffee and hops take center stage. This is kind of an odd combination on paper but they work together very well in this brew. Despite all the bitterness by the mostly grassy hops and coffee, this brew remains pretty nicely balanced as well.  Mouthfeel: IBA is a creamy medium-bodied brown ale that is definitely right on in terms of thickness. The bittering hops at the end serve to wick away enough residual flavor to make this very drinkable, but also allow just enough of the taste to linger around for a little while.  Drinkability: This is a really nice drinking beer. I would have guessed from drinking it that it was around 5-5.5% in ABV, but see now that it is deceptively high in alcohol content at 7.2%. Still, though might not be a true session beer, IBA is one you could enjoy a few of for sure.  Overall, I am really impressed by this beer. I shouldn't expect anything less from the good folks at DFH. This is a tasty and highly individualized version of a style that I don't particularly enjoy. On this account, however, I am savoring every drop, as this is a very good beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,suspect,3.73,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a shaped pint glass.  Pour was very dark with creamy white head that laced nicely and stuck around for the entire drink.  Very prominent malt smell backed by hops and some caramel undertones. Not all that powerful smelling but at the same time, does not smell weak.  Tastes very nice. As with the smell, the malt hits you first, backed by the bitterness of the hops - the aftertaste is very smooth and not bitter. It continually makes me want to go back for another taste in order to explore the complexities.  Very creamy mouthfeel. Carbonated nicely, little bubbles that tend to die off quickly in your mouth.  Extremely drinkable beer. I really like it...could knock off a six-pack if I wasn't careful but at 7.20%, I really need to make a conscious effort to tread lightly.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

It also has a mild earthy and citric hop presence towards the middle. Aftertaste is mildly bitter with a lingering toasted malt flavor. Body is medium to heavy with moderate carbonation.

Nearly white head (if it can be called that, I get no head retention from this foam)  S // Roasted barley and chocolate and coffee like roasted flavors strongly present, and a malty sweetness joined with caramel and maybe brown sugar or maple. A bit of citrus hops present, counterbalancing an otherwise malty nose.  T // Barley and maple syrup provide an adequate sweetness with a drier, roasted and burnt flavor. High dose of hops, and alcohol is very hot, along with some solvent flavor.  M // Syrup seems to be a trend with this beer, because this feels rather viscous going down.

There is a low amount of carbonation showing and there is some average lacing. The head lasted for only a few minutes before it was gone.  Smell - malts, hops, roasted/toasted nuts, coffee, chocolate  Taste & Mouth - The beer actually has quite a bit of carbonation which is surprising considering its appearance. The beer has a very sweet taste made up of lots of brown sugar and malts. There are also notes of coffee and chocolate mixed with light hops. The beer finishes with a burnt and bittersweet aftertaste.  Drink - This is a fairly decent brew that really got better as I drank it. The flavour seemed to peak when it hit room temperature. It has a very full bodied taste and it makes a terrific winter warmer.

Almost like chocolate milk. Vague hints of coffee also. No real nuttiness to speak of, but no problem with me there. This beer smells wonderful.  Taste - This brew has a toffee/caramel/chocolate type of flavor followed by the bits of coffee. Some alcohol warmth comes forth, but in a stifled kind of way and it makes me want another sip.

T - Has a sweet taste (of brown sugar) at first but the lingering taste is of a dark, burnt, malty taste. A lot like a brown ale but more of a malty taste.  M - For such a dark beer the carbonation is moderate and you can taste the strong ABV, but the maltiness along with the brown sugar makes it go down fast.  D - It is a thick beer but one that has a great taste that lingers.  Overall I'd prefer this over the Dogfish Head IPA.

Lot's of chocolate and coffee in the flavour as well, considering I like both I see this as a good thing. Bit on the boozy side, I seemed to really notice the ABV here and felt it took away rather than added to the overall experience. Finishes dry and slightly chalky with an interesting spiciness.

10099,1161,ThePorterSorter,4.2,"Thank you mother for calling me while you were at Wegmans just to see what kind of beer I wanted!! I am always excited by new (to me) dogfish head product and in this instance, I'm also hoppy (a little play on words) to be putting a true classic to the test, one which I have brewed myself.  Appearance: Dark beer with a centimeter tan head that formed, foamed and fizzled out (the little guy just didn't have it in him to stick around for the ride). I am seeing a ruby Robitussin red when held against the light and constant bubble flow along the sides. Lacing is minimal (if any) and I submit to you that the beer is in every way a distinctive brown ale.  Smell: Sweetness resembling a typical DFH profile and an earthy maltiness. Considering the ""caramelized brown sugar and aromatic barely,"" I can rightfully delegate these findings as being consistent with my expectations. Unfortunately, I do not sense the hops, they are perhaps overwhelmed by the beer's inherent sweetness.  Taste: The beer tastes like I knew it should, would, and could. It has a relatively mild, pleasant, almost floral aftertaste and goes down very easily. I almost get a milky smoothness to complement the chocolaty richness of the malt. I would vouch for a description labeled as ""after-dinner beer sweetness,"" because the beer is definitely leaning on the dessert side. However, once the beer is allowed to warm, more of the bitter can bite through the surface. Very balanced, which is why this beer gets the extra 0.5 points for this category. I too often find brown ales that are like molasses in my mouth.  Mouthfeel: Simply refreshing and a nice reward after a long days working. I choose to drink this after reading hours of post-studies relating to the APPROVe and VIGOR Vioxx trials. Hopefully this beer will go to work replenishing my faith in the idea that not every company being based around profits before customers (or patients). I know this is a complete soapbox and literally has nothing to do with mouthfeel, but predisposition to beer's intent has definite effects on how well my tastebuds will receive flavors. The beer is surprisingly crisp, typically I find brown ales to be weighed down by their sweetness. I prefer a beer with ample hop addition. If you were looking for a beer that bubbled over the glass, this my friend, is not the brew for you.  Drinkability: Gone. Cheers. The beer was smooth, supple, and all the other words you would associate with a fine piece of ass. I will continue to support DFH, even though they have gone 200% mainstream market, because they continue to make damn good beer. I would recommend this beer to others as well as purchase again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

A: Pours a dark mahogany with a billowing thick light brown head that took forever to slowly fade into an oily film that left and network of chunky sticky lacing down the glass. S: Good dose of floral hops mix well with notes of sweet brown sugar and grainy malt. I pick up light notes of milk chocolate and dark fruits as well. Smells more similar to a darker beer (porter or stout) than an American brown. T: Brown sugar and crackery grain mingle with lightly bitter herbal and floral hops. I like this beer because it's not overly sweet, not super caramelly, and actually has a touch of dryness to the finish. And because I've had porters worse than this. Very rich and creamy. M: Smooth and creamy without a trace of alcohol. This goes down too smoothly. Mouthfeel is rich and soft over the medium-full body with tingly but delicate carbonation. D: Brown ales are certainly not my favorite style, but this beer isn't your average ABA. This tastes very similar to a porter or light stout actually. Smells just like a porter the more I sniff it.

Caramel malt / burnt sugar sweetness, some woody/earthy notes, bitter finish, booze well hidden. I always find myself picking up a few six packs of this stuff right around this time of year.

A touch of caramel and a hint of charcoal. Some good bready malt and earth with a mild yeasty fruitiness. Taste is like a perfect mocha latte. Rich chocolate and coffee in the front. The charcoal from the nose is larger here. A sweet dinner roll and dough middle with a clean, long, dry finish that highlights the excellent hop blend. Hops are moving from dry and earthy to astringent and grapefruit. Feel is finely carbonated with a decent amount of weight to it. A touch of syrup and yet it never comes off as heavy. Drinkability is superb. It goes down so nicely and gets better and better with each glass.

10099,1161,jbertsch,3.82,"This beer is a conundrum for me. I like it, but not as tradtional brown. So do I rate it related to the traditional brown style, or treat it as its own animal? Tough call.  Super dark brown. Virtually black, with a tan head that's not very large.  Smells of burnt brown sugar, molasses, cinnamon, faint milk chocolate.  Tastes earthy yet sweet. Chocolate infused with smoke and chicory. There's a slight lactose undertone.  Mouthfeel is creamy and sticky.  Not a traditional brown - drinks almost like a milk stout. When I want a real brown, I'll reach for something else, but this is a fun brew on its own",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Tastes like caramelized brown sugar, slightly burnt. Malty, slick and almost oily. A little background hoppiness, but far from dominant. Very smooth mouthfeel with only light carbonation and a long finish. Complex sugary flavors linger for a while. A bit too sweet to session, at least for me, but a solid offering for moderate quantities nonetheless.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Charred malt, some smoky notes, some malti-sweetness, brown bread toast and some maple syrup.  Nice blend here, with the hops not the dominant factor. Mal is pleasant and mildly sweet at start, some light caramel and burnt sugar present. Then it dries out, with some toasted grain, bread and bitterness. Then it gets earthy and dirty, with a long bitter finish.  Full bodied, with just the right amount of carbonation and mouth-coating goodness.  Very easy to drink.

Lacing is sticky, but overall minimal.  S: Very balanced nose. Aromas of chocolate, toast, and caramel mesh with some grassy, floral hop undertones.  T: Much like the aroma, only more complex. Slight bittersweet chocolate notes, toast, raisin, and caramel make up the malt backbone, while hops give a grassy, bitter finish to the brew. Incredibly balanced concoction.  Notes: Indian Brown Ale is medium bodied, and very flavorful. Malt gives the beer some sweetness, while hops lend a dry counterpart. The 7.2% ABV is hardly noticeable.

10099,1161,zoso1967,4.18,"IBA pours a pretty serious deep rust hued brown color with a medium tan head. If you are in a dark room you could easily mistake this beer for a stout. My usual pour yields a decent sized head that has good staying power and leaves plenty of splashy lace.  The aroma is quite nice with a surprising amount of coffee roastyness mixed in with the chocolate and sweet rich toffee and caramel notes. A decent amount of floral and earthy hop character is also present, though I would say the malt flavors rule the nose.  The flavor has a much bigger hop component with a nice British character to it. The hops mingle well with a malt profile that runs the gamut from coffee and dark chocolate, toffee, caramel, molasses and raisin. This might seem like an awful lot to be going on in a beer, but somehow they all come together to create flavors that are very enjoyable.  What really gives away that this beer is not a stout or porter is the mouthfeel. It is medium bodied, and is much less viscous than your usual porter or stout. It has a nice smoothness to it and the carbonation seems dead on. The finish is long and enjoyable with both hops and burnt dark malts lingering long on the palate.  This beer is super drinkable and I am so glad I came back to it after not trying it for quite awhile. I am not sure if I would really even consider this a brown ale, but whatever it is, it is darn good and a beer that I am sure I will buy from time to time when I am in the mood for something dark and satisfying, but also a little different.

Smell: Strong roasted malts, molasses, bittersweet dark chocolate, coffee, and some aromatic hops all in there. Maybe even a little boozy. Outstanding!  Taste: Rich flavor profile. Deep roasted malts with bittersweet chocolate and coffee flavors up front, then some caramel and more rich malt merging in with some pine-like hops. The finish is part bitter hops, part bitter coffee, and part roasted/burnt grain. Quite enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: Good carbonation on the tongue, with a nice thickness. Not creamy thick, but maybe a bit chewy.  Drinkability: Really a great stand alone beer that I feel in love with the first time I had it and I keep coming back to it as a treat.

A bit more clarity than blackness of stouts, and no cloudiness.  Smell is a little more of hops than barley, barely noticeable and not disagreeable.  Taste is good, but due to the relatively higher percentage of hops in the mash, a bit sharper and more pungent than a sweet stout and a less creamy mouthfeel, with the character of a flavorful IPA with more toasted barley bittnerness, but not overly complex and not unduly sweet. Straightforward, balanced barley with hops tang. Slightly higher ABV than the avg IPA though.  Mouthfeel is medium smooth, more creamy than a lager, definitely, but not as thick or creamy as barleywine or oatmeal stout. A bit of carbonated tingling remaining well into the session.  Drinkability is good, although due to the ABV one is enough, and slower imbibing merited. A bit of hops aftertaste counteracting a little barley bitterness.

Some earthy hops appear in the middle with a hint of pine with cola and more molasses malt thickness. The beer finishes with a more strongly roasted grain character, caramel and molasses are pushed aside by chocolate covered coffee beans with moderate bitterness and some pine and grapefruit hop flavor.  M - Medium-thick body, moderate carbonation, and a slightly sweet finish.  D - There is a lot of potential here, but the hop character seems to be a bit weak. The brown malt character seems to lean more towards sugary flavors of cola, brown sugar, and molasses than malty caramel or toffee; the sugar characteristics give the beer some depth, but they become cloying much more easily than the alternative character would. The hops are much more apparent in the flavor profile than in the aroma and they work well with the roast character, though the dark malt effects them in such a way that they remind me more of a barley wine or aggressively hopped stout than anything that should have ""India"" in the name.

Why must we continue to suffer 60 Minute IPA instead? To me this makes Indian Brown a highly under-rated beer which doesn't get enough attention.  This brew has a strong coffee impression which I don't see mentioned on this site much - it has too much roasty malt flavor to come across as an IPA or Scotch Ale derivative. Feels more like a porter or stout. I have confirmed this with both beer fans and casual drinkers alike - give a sip to a random girl at a party and she'll probably anounce ""weird, it tastes like starbucks!""  That brings me to my only criticism though - that this brew is inconsistent. I used to drink it weekly, and sometimes it would taste sweet and malty, other times more hoppy and rough. That would explain for the varying accounts of this beer across different reviews.  It is also something of a gateway - as good as it is, once you have access to better brews with the same characteristics (i.e. Old Rasputin Stout) there's not a whole lot of reason to go back to the Indian Brown.

10099,1161,Bonis,4.2,"A - Darker than expected, along the lines of a porter but not quite as dark as a stout. Half inch of head which has good retention and lacing.  S - Lots of burnt sugars.. Brown sugar, caramel and molasses. Lots of roasty malt flavors and a nice touch of hops. Smells almost like a hoppy porter or stout. Pretty nice!  T - Very complex for a brown ale. Tastes more like a sweet hoppy porter to me. Lots of rich roasted flavors going on, very much like a stout on the back end in terms of roastiness left on the palate. A touch of bitter chocolate is there, as well as a nice hop bite. Little to no alcohol is present. Impressive overall.  M - Medium to full bodied with a perfect amount of carbonation for me. Feels a little like a hoppy borderline imperial stout, but very smooth.  D - Pretty good for the ABV. Can't wait to pick up a sixer of these. Definitely another solid brew from DFH!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,jbphoto88,4,"Clear yet a deep, rich amber color. The head is khaki, thick and laces the glass after each tip. It's a pretty beer.  The nose is outstanding. Deep roasted grain with molasses and fine touches of hops. There is also a light coffee all of which blend together to a very palatable scent.  The taste is equally as good. The molasses in the nose is a prominent flavor. Brown sugar coated cereal that is then baked until bubbly mixed with a light coffee and touches of hoppy bitterness. After tasting this I bet the dogfish brewery is the best smelling place on earth.  Mouthfeel has a sweet coating feeling not unlike eating a piece of chocolate. It isn't nearly as thick as chocolate but in the neighborhood. Soft bubbles and a firm, pleasing bitterness round out this drinking experience and makes it a positive one. Great beer I can't believe I've never tried before.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Really nice aromas of coffee grinds, coffee and some hop bitterness. There is a nice chocolate and toffee flavor that come through but the hops do not make this work for me. A little disjointed and maybe this isn't a great example of the style. Mouthfeel is off as it's got a bite to it and I really was looking for a silky smooth brown ale. Worth a shot and probably great on draft.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Maybe some hop presence but that may be more of a mind trick since youknow it's an ale of some sort.  T - This is where Mr. hop introduces himself to you. Mild yet floavorful hop taste with a heavy, heavy caramel malt taste as well.  M - not really any different in feel as any other DFH beer. Silky, heavy, mid to low carbonation, not too much discernible aftertaste.  D - I usually drink something with more hops or something darker, but I'll tell you what - This is my ""indecisive"" beer of choice.

Tastes similiar to the smell with the barley coming through the most. Great medium mouthfeel; not too watery or chewy. Surprised how well the 7.2% is hidden amoung the malt and hop undertones.

The head is not much to speak of. The smell is great with brown sugar and maybe some maple in there. Honestly the smell reminds me more of a porter than a brown ale. That taste is great. Just a little fizz with a molasses taste and a hint of chocolate. The added amount of hops shines through to give it a great bitter after taste. Dogfish Head does it again for me.

The nose conprises maple syrup, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, walnuts, and a touch of flowery oak. The taste brings in an additional bit of mandarin orange syrup, while also maintaining a decently powerful nuttiness. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a very smooth feel.

There isn't much to speak of as far as the head is concerned the ecru foam quickly fades away to a micro film on the surface. The smell is out of this world. It reminds me of some nice creamy milk chocolate with rich caramel notes. There are hints of rich fruit and char to go along with it. The taste is most akin to a nice mocha (sweet coffee and chocolate). There is a nice brown sugar and char flavor that goes along with what might be the bitterness from the hops which are rather nice. The mouthfeel is a tad watery for my liking, but that doesn't mean it's unpleasant.

No visible carbonation. Smell is surprisingly bland, there's just not much there. A little mustiness, a little maltiness, and not much else. Perhaps I have a poor sense of smell.  Taste is bitter and dry, not hoppy -- like a cocoa powder bitterness. My first thought was, ""It's like a brown ale concentrate."" Which is actually pretty good.  Mouthfeel is fairly light and definitely dry, also pretty pleasant. Drinkable, good beer, but not fantastic.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

I had this from a bottle, and when poured has a nice dark and mellow color, and the head is of a bone color which recedes rather quickly. The scent is amazing, full of molasses and burnt brown sugars. The taste is uncommon and unique. While matching the burnt sugar smell with taste, the roasted malt also comes through and it finishes with what might be describes as a charcoal flavor. Mouthfeel can be a bit syrupy and because of that and the high ABV, drinkability can come into question. I only enjoy this beer if I limit myself to two or three. Still, its a great beer and one of my favorite from Dogfish. It is sometimes hard to acquire, so when i see it I buy a lot.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,weizenbob,4.27,"Presentation: 12 ounce bottle, poured into a pint glass  Appearance: Deep, DEEP auburn hue with a small amount of tan foam forming after the pour but dissipating quickly.  Smell: Strong scent of chocolate up front, with a hint of hops lingering beneath.  Taste: This is definitely hopped up, though not as much as I had anticipated from other testimonials. Make no mistake, this is first and foremost a brown ale, albeit a complex one. Cocoa flavor hits first but is broken up by moderate carbonation revealing a hoppy finish. Some alcohol warmth lingers in the back of the throat which is not surprising considering 7.2% abv. However, the alcohol content never overtakes the flavor of the brew. Lingering sweetness slowly disappears revealing a bitter aftertaste. I wish I was eating something to scrub the aftertaste away; in all other respects this is a delicious ale.  Notes: This is my first experience with any of the Dogfish Head brews as they are unavailable in my neck of the woods. I was excited to find this during my travels, and look forward to passing this way again.

A - Pours a a dark mahogany colour with a bloody mary reddish hue, thin finger of beige head, with decent retention which settles to a thin film with some fine sporatic lacing.  S - Scent is dominated by chocolate and espresso malts, a bit on the bready side, but it finishes with a nice leafy green hop.  T - Much like the scent, the bitter coffee and some dark cocoa dominate, but there is a pleasant bitter hop on the finish. It's definitely overpowered by the malts, but does add a nice tweak to the classic brown ale. Higher ABV is hardly noticeable and well hidden.  M - A little thicker and chewy than I had expected, but nicely carbonated and it finishes quite smooth. No complaints here.  D - This stuff is quite nice and I'm glad we're able to get it in Alberta.

Two fingers of creamy beige head that slowly settles.  Rich toasted and cocoa notes on the nose, clean leafy hops in the background.  Flavour starts out with an espresso-like bite that evolves to a bitter dark cocoa in the middle, while that bittersweetness blends with leafy herbal hops on the finish and lingering long into the aftertaste. Toasty, roasty, woody notes come out the more it warms. Strikes me more as a Robust Porter than anything else.  Full-bodied mouthfeel, rich thick velvety texture, chewy much of the time, somewhat oily along the finish.  This ale is certainly something all right, big and bold, and a decent homage to the Texas Brown style. I think the labelling is a bit hazy, this could double as one of the many incarnations of the Porter style over the last 300 years, but it seems to have worked well this far, why change it. There's also a lot of stouts out there that could take a lesson from the mouthfeel of this Indian Brown Ale.

To this day, this is the darkest brown ale I have ever had. The smell is more like a porter to me than a brown ale. It smells like chocolate malts predominately, some faint alcohol, and some hop presence. Tastes like some bitter dark roasted malts, hops go back and forth in the mix, but overall, the beer smacks of fresh roasted malts. The hops are also bolstering the dark bitterness. I gotta say, the IBU's might not be that high, but this is one bitter dark beer! I am sorta shocked cause it seems to come from the roasted malts, not hops, but that could be deceiving. Hmm, this is an interesting beer, nonetheless. To me, this beer has far more in common with a Porter style than an Indian Brown, but has me intrigued what the heck their Wordwide Stout will taste like, let alone their porter. Mouthfeel seems very rich for a brown ale. I won't be holding any of this against them, although this certainly is an in-between sorta beer.

Appearance 5/5 Pours clear and deep brown, that gives an appearance of black in a glass. Tan colored creamy head that starts huge, sticks around, and leaves an excellent lacing.  Aroma 3.5/5 The initial aroma is sweet, but hops overpower it. The hop aroma is very fresh and herbal: grassy, citrus. I could not detect any of the sweetness from the first impression over the course of the beer; it was a hop-fest.  Taste 4/5 There is some malty sweetness, and a good backbone from start to finish, but it's always in the background. It never gets sweet and remains bitter all along, sometimes because of flavorful hops, and because of the roast at other times. The roast can be very well felt and once in a while it tastes like over roasted coffee, not meant in a bad way. But, where's the caramel? It seems like a hoppy porter or a Black IPA: a generously hopped ale brewed with dark malts, and a pretty good one at it. But, not a malt forward beer as it claims to be. Clean and bitter finish.  Mouthfeel 4/5 Seems alright. Carbonation is medium, so is the body. Never cloying.  Drinkability 4/5 Good. Overly bitter at times, even though the IBUs are low for the body.

Thick, roasted malts last into the finish, where they are met with the English hops, which provide a moderate bitterness, but it's definitely noticeable and provides balance. A little bit of the coffee and bitter chocolate hangs around after the swallow.

A: Pours a very dark ruby/garnet red/brown, nice thick tan head that sticks around, leaves lace everywhere, and stays at about 1/8 of an inch cap all the way around. BEAUTIFUL garnet red highlights when held up to light. This beer looks wonderful.  S: Man, this smells far too much like a porter/stout than I'm wanting. Mostly chocolate, caramel malt, a little bit of an oily/floral hop, and some nice biscuit malts, but this one smells like something else, and since I'm not reviewing a porter or stout, I'll knock it for that reason.  T: Oh my God. First words out of my mouth, after swallowing it, of course. This is fantastic. Nice sweetness from the caramel malt and brown sugar, nice almost smokey note up front as well. The hops slide up, and take a hold, a slight bitterness, with a little spice and oily/resiny flavor, with a nice balance to the malt, not overpowering, but remaining assertive enough to remind you it has hops in it. Chocolate, biscuits, dark bread, small yeast, a little bit of alcohol, hops, caramel, coffee, slightly smokey and peaty, almost like a Scotch Ale like Dirty Bastard. Jeez, this has everything but the kitchen sink, and does so without any one flavor taking over the beer. Speechless.  M: Slightly creamy, a little bit heavy body, smooth, decent carbonation. Good, but nothing special to make me rate it higher.  D: Very easy, and it's quite high ABV for the style. I could drink this all the time, but I don't have the money to keep fresh in my fridge all the time. Which is a shame.  This is one of the better beers I've had in a while.

10099,1161,SnowGoon99,3.91,"Serving type: bottle into Stella Artois glass  Appearance is a very dark brown with some red hues. Aroma is somewhat lacking which was surprising for a hoppy brown ale. I caught a little bit of a coffee note but not much else. (It's possible my allergies were acting up at the time so i wouldn't read too much into that.)  The taste of pine needles hits you immediately on first taste. With some background notes of chocolate. Also hints of caramel and dark fruit (fig, plum, etc.) Was leading more towards a hoppy Scotch ale.  Overall i think this beer is in the wrong category. It's more of a Scotch ale that's been overly hopped. It still made for a drinkable beer though and was pleased with it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,stakem,4.39,"Standard 12oz brown bottle with a bottle on date of 8/12/10.  Poured into a pint, IBA appears a clear brownish-amber color. A finger of tan head appears and receeds fairly fast leaving spotty amounts of lace on the glassware.  The aroma of this brew is very enticing and is quite perplexing as it encompasses a broad array of different styles of beer. Initially it smells of dark toasty grains that come across with notes of chocolate and dark sugar like caramel or molasses that also has a note of coffee about it as well in the background. However, once it opens up there is a bright citrus hop character to it that smells both herbal and piney. Also included is a bit of dark fruitiness and a bit of alcohol is evident as well.  The taste of this brew is enjoyable and equally as complex as the aroma. If I was given this brew to consume without a label on it, I have no idea what category I would place it in. There is a solid malt profile throughout the experience tasting of roasty malt with some dark sugars that smelled more like caramel or molasses but taste like a dark belgian sugar candy and coffee before the flavor of the herbal and tangy citrus hops come into play. There is a flavor of estery alcohol evident that also provides a bit of warmth in the back of the throat.  A flavor of toasty grain mingled with hops resides in the mouth long after each sip. This is a medium bodied and modestly carbonated brew. Very high on the drinkability scale despite the 7+% abv.  This is a brew that I have previously not given much respect to. I guess it took a weekend getaway secluded with not many options to pick this fresh six pack up and thoroughly enjoy it. This is really a well balanced and well rounded brew. There is so much going on it in that it could easily be an all inclusive selection for pairing with a broad array of foods. Well done.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,sellmeagod,2.63,"A decent brown ale that doesn't quite do enough uniquely to recommend from a usually exceptional brewery.  A brown river look from a standard Dogfish bottle. Nice enough.  A nutty, roasted smell hits the nose, and you get a fairly intense nutty taste along with the alcohol.

Appearance: black in color with Ruby hues at the bottom of my tulip and dark orange shades at the top by accompanied by a thick creamy coffee colored head. Simply beautiful  Smell: dark roasted charachter on the nose giving molasses and dark chocolate with a slight hop character. Pretty nice aroma overall.  Taste: right off the bat is a roasted malt character that gives you the flavor of dark chocolate, molasses, coffee, and licorice. Good hop finish giving you a grassy and grapefruit flavor. As it warms up it gives off more of a sweeter brown sugar characteristic. Quite tasty overall.  Mouthfeel: thick smooth and crisp, wonderful combination of styles here with a stout like robustness and the wonderful clean crisp finish from the hop character.  Drinkability: goes down well but can also be enjoyed as a sipper, not perfect but pretty darn good.

Brown soda bread malts with a musty vinous quality hinted at, then orange Angostura bitters hops at the end. Mocha finish.Tight linger. Medium to full, viscous, slight burn, lively.  Does it get high taste ratings for being interesting as much as good? This is impressive just because it manages to keep the balls in the air for so many styles and flavors.

The head is off white, fine carbonation, dissipates slowly to a film and retains there.  The smell is of mild pine hops and dark sugar malts. There's a bit of fig sweetness.  The taste has a very mild hop bitterness, but less piney and more dry at that point. There's a nut flavor as well. The malts are more subdued and less sweet in the taste.  Feel is moderate and on the fuller side, and the carbonation is consistent but soft and mild, creating a very smooth and borderline creamy texture.  The beer is slightly stronger than average, but it goes down very easy and it would be easy to drink two or three. Very tasty and enjoyable, with a subdued hop character than keep hop heads interested while still pleasing fans of milder beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

A - Pours a very dark brown with red lighting on the side, clear with a few carbonation bubbles, an inch of creamy head with very good lacing.  S - Roasted malt and dark/bitter chocolate comes up on the forefront, then a sweet smell of molasses.  T - Just as the smell, the hops bitterness and roasted coffee flavor strikes the taste buds first. The malt molasses-like sweetness then creeps in just as it finishes. Carbonation is just right.  M - Medium to near full bodied. This beer is almost too creamy to be a brown ale.  D - Though the hop bitterness strikes a bit at first, it ends up being a pretty amazingly balanced beer.

S: The first smell that I immediately picked up on was coffee. Which was that promptly followed by the hops and its piny aroma. A great smell that I won't soon forget, it was very unique to me.  T: Upon the first swallow I tasted the roasted malts with hints of coffee, which was reminiscent of most stouts that I have tried. The hop taste lingers after it has gone down the throat.

Flavor is roasted and toasted malts, brown sugar, molasses, fairly harsh coffee bitterness, a little chocolate, some citrus, pine and floral hops still present themself enough which I am extremely impressed by.

This is a medium bodied beer with complex layers of well-balanced flavors that make it very drinkable.

Certainly one hell of a roasted malty brew that gets teamed up with chocolate and caramel with some aggressive bitterness to follow.  M - Well-bodied with easy mobility  The Dogfish strikes again.

Smells like a sweet dark stout that has spent a good chunk of time being dry-hopped. Chocolate malt and sweet citrus dominate.  The taste is wonderful. This ""brown"" tastes like a stout, but as it warms you get more and more hops, and it becomes very bitter. Very malty, this is a beer I'll be coming back to often.  Mouthfeel is on the heavy end of being medium-bodied. It's got a nice creamy bitter quality to it.  Drinkability is not bad, again I'll never turn down a chance at this beer, but the heavy bitterness can get overpowering so one or two are my max in a sitting. Once I taste this I realize that either I really just wanted a stout or would rather have a lighter brown ale.

The head never fails, taking forever to fall, globbing on the side of the glass as it does, leaving the most wonderful lacing.  The aroma is a sort of burnt chocolate and coffee, blended with fresh hops and a caramel-like sweetness.  The taste is fairly complex. The various flavors go through stages with each sip. The toasted, bready flavors coming first, moving into a sweet honey/caramel type of thing. After that, moving right into a slight, but crisp, hops bite with a little coffee aftertaste.  The carbonation breaks up the thickness of this beer and helps bring out all of the flavors. There is a nice warmth to each sip and yet a light, well-balanced aspect.

A - This beer is much darker than I expected it ranges from dark amber, when the light catches it, to very dark brown. It looks like molasses in a glass but more viscous. The head was short but frothy, a dark tan color and it subsided pretty quickly. The lacing was hardly detectable, which surprised me with such a dark beer that boasts caramelized brown sugar as a major ingredient.  S - The smell is very roasty, probably from a darkly roasted malt. It also smells very sweet, like caramel or toffee flavored coffee. There is also a nice hop smell but it blends some well with the rest of the scents that it is hard to decipher its origin.  T - The taste is definitely a molasses like richness with a bitter edge. Again, I detect a roasty, sweet combo like toffee candy and coffee. I think the blend of hops to sweet makes for what I can only describe as ""sickly sweet"", which is a term I am sure very few will adopt, but the only other way to describe it is medicinal. This is particularly prevalent in the aftertaste.  B - The mouth feel is about what you would expect from the look of the beer, between medium and heavy. It coats the inside of your mouth leaving a resiny feel to your mouth.  O - This beer is very complex, I think most of the flavors mix well, but the medicinal flavor keeps it from being a sweet treat. I also don't think that the richness lends itself to drinkability.

Aroma is nice caramely-roasted malts with some earthy/herbal hop notes. The beer is warm so I'll come back to this... some dark fruit emerges.  Taste is thick, coats the mouth with roasted, almost sharp caramel and slightly restrained sweetness. There are some faint dark fruit flavors and a moderate hop bitterness.

10099,1161,kingcrowing,3.68,"12oz bottle poured into a DFH snifter, bottled on 06/09/10.  Pours a nice deep dark brown with a solid one finger light brown thick and creamy head that starts clinging to the glass from first pour. Nice light bubble trails up the side of the glass. Nose is sweet malts, caramel, toffee, roasted malts, and a bit of maple/brown sugar.  Taste is quite interesting, there's a bit of the scotch ale influence in the form of a nice rich smokiness as well as a fairly sharp bitterness as well. Not over the top hopped but it holds up well with the big malt profile. The brown sugar adds a nice little kick to it. The finish is a bit roasty and sweet with a subtle hint of alcohol in the back of your throat. Mouthfeel is fairly rich and creamy with good carbonation, but it's not overly sweet.  In general I'm not a big of the American Brown style, but this is a very decent example.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

One of the things I like about Dogfish Head is that they don't really pay too much attention to style; they just make great beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Jfraser,4.22,"On first pour, this ale is dark brown to black with a quickly receding coffee tinted head. Smell is appealing with malt and burnt caramel undertones. Taste is slightly spicy with a good balance of hops against the toffee/caramel sweetness. Notes of coffee aftertaste, very pleasant. Mouthfeel is slightly thick, but well balanced by the alcohol content. Drinkability is good, I can see this pairing well with any type of savory dish such as curry or red meats.  Overall a pleasant brew by the guys over at Dogfish Head Brewery.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,grittybrews,4.37,"Poured dark with only a hint of brown into a Duvel tulip. Around a finger of coffee-colored head that receded to a thin film.  Syrupy aroma of brown sugar, chocolate, coffee, and alcohol. Mouthfeel starts a little thick, but the moderately high carbonation lightens things up. Initial caramel flavor is followed by some toasty coffee and chocolate malts. Molasses on the finish with a hint of hoppy bitterness. For a relatively tame 7.2%, the ABV really makes itself known and adds a pleasant warmth that complements this brew's sweetness. Very tasty.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,chemidtown,4.47,"Bought at Belmont Beverage right outside the Notre Dame campus in South Bend, Indiana.  A - Black, not brown with light head that dissipates quickly.  S- Sweet Carmel and brown sugar smell, no hops in aroma though.  T - Slightly sweet with a balance of hops that come out in the aftertaste. Tastes like a better Bridgeport Ebenezer which makes me think of this more as a winter warmer than brown ale.  M - Heavy at first but immediately levels off to a perfect feel.  D - If I could get it in Oklahoma I would drink it every night, I could only find one in the single section.  This is another home run from the innovators at Dogfish Head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

It smells like a gourmet dessert.  T: Outstanding. Absolutely amazing. This beer is big and rich. All sorts of stuff going on. I could list them all but I will keep it simple and call it great.  M: Only reason I gave this a 4 is that there is a little heat from the alcohol content coming through at the end.  D: Because it is so rich and has a higher ABV, I couldn't have more than 2 or 3, however, this beer is amazing and worth your time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Shakesbeere,3.97,"Pours dark amber brown. Smells of barley, molasses malt, and hops. Flavor comes in stages. Upon first sip, there is a brief hit of sweet brown sugar that foreshadows a later stage. Becomes immediately bitter with notes of barley grain and ginger. Morphs into a boozy caramel flavor. Then develops distinct notes of brown sugar as the boozy character subsides. At some points, there are small hints of coffee amid the molasses (a bit in the aftertaste as well). The finish is a return to the bitter. A solid beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,OttoBomb,4.35,"12 oz. bottle poured (appropriately) into Dogfish Head signature glass (July 3, 2010). ""Bottled on 06/09/2010 B"" is printed on the neck of the bottle.  Eyes: Pours a very dark brown that only lets through minimal light when held up to the light, zero haze. A full three fingers of dirty khaki head forms, lingers and laces well. At first blush this appears to be a stout.  Nose: It smells a bit like a stout also, or maybe a heavy porter. It's not as hoppy as I expected from some advertised as ""well hopped."" Tons of rich, complex maltiness comes through here.  Tongue: There are loads of toasty, roasty malts, some chocolate, a touch of coffee, and some of those hopps too. Quite savory and complex.  Mouth: Satisfyingly rich, smooth, and adequate carbonation.  Libation: This has the very savory, satisfying, richness of a good stout offering without the usual heaviness of a stouts. Very smooth, very complex, very good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,legatovibrato24,4.82,"This brew poured a dark brown/amber and developed a creamy tan head that stuck around for a respectable period of time. Its dissipation was only caused by my desire to taste this great concoction. After smelling the roasty, caramelly, chocolately, coffee like aroma, I couldn't help but to turn it up.  On the front of the tongue, you catch the barley and roasted bitter, and on the backslide, the sweetness, caramel and brown sugar come in to play.  Even though it comes in at 7.2% ABV, there is no alcohol taste present and the balance of flavors, carbonation and body come together to create an incredible mouthfeel.  I can't say enough good about this beer, even the price was reasonable, at $10.19 for a six pack. I will gladly pay this for an ale I can enjoy, and feel good about drinking, knowing that I'm supporting a brewery that knows how to and cares about getting things right.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

S: There is a moderate aroma of dark roasted malts in the nose along with notes of caramel and some hints of brown sugar. T: The taste is rather complex and has notes of brown sugar, caramel, nuts, roasted malts and toffee. A mild amount of bitterness is present from the hops. M: It feels medium-bodied on the palate; there is a little bit of warming from the alcohol. D: The beer is very easy to drink and the smell or taste of alcohol isn't perceptible.

The aroma is comprised of malt, sugar, chocolate, and fruit. The flavor is of coffee, chocolate, malt, and caramel. It was heavy on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a surprisingly good brew. It was very complex in both the flavor and aroma which was very nice. I am just glad that DFH is distributing in my area now so these are readily available.

Well executed mutation of the 3 styles.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Bouleboubier,4.2,"Have had this on tap and de la bottle many a time, and it's always been a solid, righteous brown.  From the long neck, it pours (into a pint glass) with a half-inch, dirty khaki-colored head that settles down quickly into a swampy swirl, slowly dying away til the end. Dark and lovely straight on - deep crimson highlights held up to the light.  Smells more like a porter than a brown. Roasty, bitter, licorice.  They claim it's a cross between a Scotch ale, IPA, and American brown. I certainly get the Scotch ale with the caramelized, malty notes. A nod to the American brown with the extra bittering. The IPA factor is a little harder to nail down, as it appears to be in the aroma. And that's buried down under the acidic roast punch in the nose.  A lot going on in the taste. First things that hit are bitter roast and coffee, immediately transitioning to molasses and cocoa, and finally finishing off with black candy licorice and a hint of dried, slightly burnt fruit. The parts are subtle and the sum is well-balanced. Greeted with alcohol halfway through each sip, but it's darn mellow considering the ABV.  A bit caustic on the tongue at first. With enough swirling of the liquid, the carbonation tones down, revealing the richer, sweeter elements. Improves as it warms.  I'll probably consider readjusting my drinkability rating because this beer has always given me joy. Consistent, complex, and ahead of the pack for American browns.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Anaz,4.32,"This is my first review, so bear with me if I don't get very in depth.  This beer is darker than I would have though anything called a brown ale would be, and throughout the session, it seemed more like a porter with a nice hop balance than anything else.  The aroma is full, with roasted malt, burnt sugar, and light coffee overtones, more like an central american than a dark espresso roast.  The mouthfeel is full and lightly warm from the alcohol, but not at all unpleasanly hot. The flavors of coffee, anise, dark fruit, and chocolate go on, but lifted up by a nice hop bitterness. There is a faint citrusy, resinous quality that weaves in and out of the background that keeps this beer from being boring.  The alcohol is too high to make this beer sessionable, but it tastes great, and if I forgot about the abv, I'd no doubt plow through a few bottles of this before I noticed how much trouble I'd be in for. Overall, I like this beer a lot and will definitely have it again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,MetalHopHead6,4.03,"DFH Indian Brown ale is sweet, sticky, and bitter.  It poured dark brown, with a dark reddish tint, and a thick, tall, sticky tan head. It left thick fat rings of lace. The smell and flavor began with a mild hint of chocolate quickly dominated by molasses and brown sugar. The feel was thick, bready, and very bitter, with a higher hop profile than typical brown ales. It left a sticky sweet presence on the tongue.  Indian Brown Ale is a very good after dinner, cool day experience, but it's kind of a tweener. It's not as smooth, creamy, or flavorful as the good stouts or porters, and it's not as mouth popping or refreshing as the good pale ales or IPAs. I prefer beers at one extreme or another, but Indian Brown Ale is a darn good best-of-both-worlds.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,uustal,4.33,"Dark chocolate flavors start this beer off. A hint of dark fruits as well. Turns into a sweet malt before finishing a bit dry and bitter, but goes well with the beer.

Has a beautiful dark head that accompanies you the whole journey  S- A nice malty, chocolate, molasses, coffee, and kind of caramel smell. Makes me drool.

Smell is roasted malt. Nice roasty nutty aroma. Maybe even a hint chocolate and coffee. Beyond what a brown ale would smell like.  T. Taste is beyond a brown ale as well. Taste of roasted malt is predominant. Has a little hop bite in the background. I get the brown sugar taste. Not really picking up a well hopped flavor. Tastes more like a porter than a brown ale.  M. Medium bodied. Medium carbonation.  D. Drinkable. This is a good beer, I just don't think it tastes anything like its name or the description on the bottle. I think there is too much roasted malt flavor going on. The one thing it is definitely not for me is well hopped. Hops were about the weakest smell and flavor I got out of this beer.

So this time, I waited until I had BA open on the computer before cracking it open!  Pours a beautiful deep mahogany, with creamy tan head that slooowly reduces. Nice lacing on the sides as I swirl the beer around.  Has a roasted nutty malt smell with hints of vanilla and caramel. Very tasty smelling!  Has a complex roasted malt and hops taste. There are grassy undertones,coated with molasses and tanin tastes. Like many good beers, this one opens as it warms. I've paired it well with a medium-rare strip steak, and highly recommend this beer with spicy food as well.  The beer leaves a slight bitter aftertaste that slowly fades. Highly drinkable; I've got to work to ensure I don't drink this tasty brew too quickly.

It makes me happy when I open up a bottle, and I get that anticipation feeling when I pour it into a glass.  A: Opaque brown with a little red shining in the wings, it pours with a thick clean tan head that does not dissipate quickly. S: Warm, complex, chocolate, malty, and what's that? Ah, yes, the piney goodness of a heavily hopped APA or IPA but in a brown. Oh, where have you been hiding, you beautiful thing you? T: Does not disappoint after the enticing smell: the taste is even more layered and complex than the promise of the pour. M: Molasses-like thickness without being gloppy or too thick. It's substantial, and needs chewing to bring out all the layers of flavor. D: A session-ender, methinks, and one of the few that can come after an APA, IPA, or Double IPA at a tasting.

Poured from the bottle a deep brown, just shy of black, with amber hues and tan head that sits well on top while clinging lightly to the glass.  Smell is mainly malt, tough to pick out the hops, with caramel, coffee, chocolate, oatmeal and bready combining to create a nice thick scent.  Taste is a great mix of malty sweetness on the front followed by a nice finish of hops. THe malt comes through as caramel and sweet, with hints of coffee and chocolate. The hops finish slightly bitter and piney, but play well with the malt flavors.  Mouthfeel is very well balanced, nice carbonation that helps flavors linger throughout the mouth.

Beautiful dark brown ale, tawny tan head, and lacing that sticks arounddd.  Smells roasty and floral. Hops are definitely there. Delicate chocolate and brown sugar notes.  There's an interesting hop bitterness that blends well with the bitterness of the roasted malt, over a relatively faint spicy sweetness. The first few times I had this beer, I tasted the brown sugar a lot more, but I think over time the molasses flavor mellows out. Still exceptional, just a bit dryer than I remember.  Mouthfeel? Er, it doesn't feel like I'm drinking seltzer water, but the carbonation is there? To me it almost feels like cold root beer.  Drinkability: BE careful, two of these is like having 3 or so 'regular' beers (regular, to me, being between 4.5 and 5 abv).

There is a hint of molasses and some dark fruits, possibly black cherry.  T: The hops play a bigger role on the taste than in the aroma. The toasted aroma comes through nicely on the taste. In some ways tastes more like a stout/porter than a brown. It is creamy upfront with the chocolate and then transitions into a more bitter finish with notes of roasted malt. You can taste a little bit of the alcohol on the back end, but not really in a bad way.  M/D: Medium to full bodied, very creamy. Leaves a nice aftertaste on the tongue.

I always look forward to anything DFH puts out because 9/10 times I know I'm in for a treat and 10/10 times I'm in for a unique experience.  This is a very aesthetically pleasing beer, it pours a dark amber brown with a medium caramel toned head and some nice lacing.  the aroma provides earthy, woody, nutty, coffee type notes and ever so slight hoppyness kinda hides itself in there. there may even be a little rootbeer scent in there  The taste is very complex and wonderful. The nutty coffee bean aromas come to the forefront of this beer and make it extremely smooth and aromatic all the way down. at 7.2% there is no burn at all from booze and it definitely leaves a roasted coffee taste in your mouth after the fact.  the mouthfeel is a nice smooth light-mid level carbonated feel. not much tingle and its thick and heavy enough comparable to a porter, but not syrupy like a heavy stout.

10099,1161,belgiumbud,2.7,"I purchased this particular brew at a beer store in Bend, OR. in the bottle. After getting it to my place of consumption I allowed it to stay out at room temperature for about an hour. Then upon pouring my first bottle into a room temperature pint glass I was greeted with citrusy-floral nodes, a pleasant tobacco fragrance and considerable alcohol scents. As I collected my thoughts, I soaked in the color and noticed the head disappeared so quickly that I did not have time to mentally record what I saw. The color of the beer was medium-dark chocolate to dark brown. My interest was peaking, so I took the first sip. First thing I noticed was that the warm alcohol mouth feel defenitly overshadowed any flavor complexities that might exist. As the beer settles longer on the palate I noticed subtle caramel and roasted espresso bean, while the dry hop finish rounds everything out. While I do appreciate a beer that finishes dry, I also appreciate a beer that allows my senses to appreciate all the complexities the brew has to offer. I was not given that opportunity here. Being that I purchased a six-pack I looked forward to trying another one to see if I was wrong in my first assessment. I was not. I did find, as with many beers, that when I allowed the brew warm up, my palate were able to pick up on some small complexties. The hop character was appealing. Flavor profile was masked by the alcohol mouth-feel and over-carbonation.

Flavor is dark roasted malt, nutty and roasty. Burnt meat and slightly smokey flavors come out. Sourness comes in the middle with a punch of sweetness.

The hops peak up through the malts to really make their presence known but don't overwhelm the palette, it's a nice mingly balance.  Mouthfeel-Full, thick and a tad smokey; I can see why Dogfish Head said this was part scotch-ale in its description.  Drinkability-A six pack of this is easy enough to go through; I'd say this is about average in drinkability, maybe a bit more.  Notes-I'm a big fan of Dogfish Head and this is one of my favorie beers by them; it's a nice blend of various styles and gives a unique flavor. I like this beer, I recommend it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,chickenflea,4.35,"12-oz bottle.  A: The ale is a dark mahogany color, so deep red that appears black from afar. A very tall rocky and persistent tan head. Excellent lacing.  S: Highly aromatic. The nose is malty, thick with a smoky undertone that drips with peat and alcohol-soaked cherries. Caramel malts add further heft to the body.  T: A balanced smoky brown beer. Darker malts, toasted with chocolate, coffee and caramel, lead the way. They are followed almost immediately with a palpable smoky flavor. The result is thick and almost coarse brew. Hop flavor manages to peak through the malts and smoke but just barely. A very enjoyable drink.  M: The mouthfeel is full, smoky and thick, but not so heavy that it is burdensome. I was edxpecting a run of the mill brown ale but, knowing DFH, I should have known otherwise. Finish is fairly dry.  D: They label is a brown ale, but it sure tastes like a scotch ale. The finish is not heavy so you go right back for another drink. Excellent balance overall.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Aroma is strong coffee and almost burnt toast, along with molasses, brown sugar, chocolate, malty, some pine and floral hops, a bit yeasty and a bit funky.  Flavor is roasted & toasted malts, brown sugar, molasses, coffee bitterness, a little chocolate, some citrus, pine and floral hops.  Medium body, medium carbonation, tad sticky toward the end.

The head disappeared after a couple sips but still left loose lacing on the glass as it went down.  2. Smells like coffe, cocoa, and roasted barley. Very appealing smell.  3. Taste pretty much like it smells. A little coffee a little chocolate from the malt, a little roasted flavor and a small bit off hops at the end.  4. Mouthfeel is a little thick, not bad though.

Dark roasted malt and a little dark fruit, coupled with the bitter, earthy hops from the nose. Chocolate and a touch of coffee are notable. ABV is only apparent in the form of a pleasant warming. Tons of flavor yet refreshing and quaffable, well crafted. Love it!  M: Thick and full, just big enough to add character but not affect drinkability.  This is one of my favorite beers overall.

I pick up on a bit of caramel and maybe honey as well.

T: Hoppy at first with the malts coming on heavily afterward. Sweet, roasty finish. Tasty.  M; Fairly light body with moderate, prickly carbonation.  D: Quite good for the ABV.

I do notice some nice ruby color around the edges of the glass and decent carbonation rising up from the bottom. Head is about one-finger, tan, creamy, and hangs on in perpetuity.  Smell: Nice toasted malt aroma here. Picking up some coffee, caramel, and a touch of alcohol. There is also a sweet scent under the surface, with chocolate, molasses, and dark fruits among the players.  Taste: Very creamy flavor, but with a nice bitterness to round out the tasting experience. Picking up a lot of the same toasted characteristics found in the smell, as well as the chocolate, dark fruit, and molasses notes. I detect a little more hops than in the nose of this one, and the alcohol is a bit more pronounced as well.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full-bodied and very creamy.

Strong aromas of dark coffee and roasted malt mix nicely with some sweet chocolate.  T: Good amounts of sweetness upfront: caramel, a little molasses, and some nutiness (hazelnut). Dark chocolate flavor provides some additional sweetness and also a touch of bitterness in the finish. Some coffee flavor also adds a touch of bitterness at the finish.  M: On the lighter side of medium - would have liked a little more body here.  D: A unique brew that I enjoy having from time to time.

The color is a dark, beautiful garnet.  The smell is subtle and the malt and hops compete for attention. From my first whiff I thought this beer would be short on flavor.  I was wrong and so happy to be so! The malt and the hops are well-balanced. An earthiness comes through and there is some caramel tones (probably from the brown sugar they use in brewing).

Your mouth is immediately attacked by this beer and the flavors explode on your tongue and your palate.

The smell and head are promising as you would expect from this brewery. Consistency is medium for most brown ales. however there is an overpowering taste of alcohol in the front on the tongue- in my estimation. to me it is somewhere between the initial taste of a bad barley wine and a homemade brandy. i really can't get paste the taste of alcohol to judge the taste of the beer much past that.

The relatively high alcohol content is hidden by the perfect balance of malt and hops. Nutty, chocolaty, bready all combined. Definitely warrants a 5.0, it may be the best Brown I've ever tasted.  Mouthfeel is super smooth, finely balanced with the carbonation and a very slight tingle from the 7.2% alcohol. It honestly has one of the better mouthfeels of any Brown Ale I've tasted.

While smooth, the taste is almost too strong; I can't physically taste any amount of hop or malt. Probably a ""take it or leave it"" situation. Personally, I dig it.

Coffee and fruitiness makes an appearance as well. Nice creamy mouthfeel.  This unique brown ale was fantastic, so many flavors.

D: Pretty heavy and higher abv; could probably only finish a few of these, yet still good flavor.  Additional Notes: DFH says this is a mix between a brown ale, scotch ale, and IPA, but I do not taste the hop bitterness from the IPA at all.

Tastes I can pick up are caramel, brown sugar, dark bread, maple, hops. A little bit of smoke. The sweetness is a tad overpowering I think but it's good. Booze pops up now and then. Definitely Scotch Ale-esqe. Mouthfeel is pretty great here, very smooth, a little bit creamy, and a good amount of carbonation, fits the style and the flavors here very well.

Faint caramel scent as well.  T: Malty sweet at the forefront, with a mild burnt wood finish. Little hops are detected. But from what I've been drinking lately, (DIPA's) it could be hoppier than I perceive.  M: Slick and crisp with ample carbonation. Mild chalky malt feel as well.  D: Pretty decent and interesting dark brew. It sort of reminds me of a porter/sweet stout hybrid. Sweeter than your run of the mill porter, but not as filling as a stout. Overall, based on it's style - which I haven't had many of - a pretty good interpretation.

S - Bitterness dominates, which was surprising due to the name and color, and description on the bottle, though it does say it is well hopped. Caramel roast comes through, as well as earthy barley scents. T - Mild tastes of honey, smokey malt, and a mushroomy earthiness hide behind the ""well hopped"" bitterness. The overall combination reminds me of a ""dry"" Russian or Imperial stout. There is a definite caramel malt delivering a sweetness that is combated by dry roasted bitterness. The finish really brings out the brown sugar, and a lingering alcohol flavor as well. Well balanced and complex. M - The appearance gave it away. Very creamy, velvety, thick beer. There is a minor amount of carbonation that seems to grab on to the tongue to help pop the flavors, but the rest of the mouth doesn't really detect it. The beer coats the rest of your mouth, helping to bring on a long, flavorful finish. Wonderful mouthfeel. D - At 7.2ABV, its not severely alcoholic, but not light either. However, even the alcohol flavor that comes through is mild, and the beer is very easy drinking. The creaminess gives the impression that it is filling. Probably not a session beer here, due to the alcohol content, but I could easily sip on these for a whole night.

The aroma was deep, dark and mysterious. Floral hops, chocolates, roasted malt, toasty and nutty aromas, and caramelized sugars and dark candied fruits. The taste was similar to the nose. A meld of roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolates, figs, burnt sugars, and finished by a robust hop bitterness. There is a nice roasty aftertaste. The feel of the beer is slick and full. Nice carbonation. This is an excellent offering from DFH. I could drink this all day long. I probably wouldn't be much use to anyone if I did, but I'd be a happy camper.

Great lacing that just sticks to the glass and never leaves.  Tastes of roasted coffee, sweet toasted malt, caramel, light hops, vanilla, chocolate, dark fruits, cocoa and burnt/smoked wood. Creamy slick mouthfeel, with a heavy overall feel that has zero carbonation and an oak barrel aging aroma and taste. Very easy flowing and drinkable, with a stout-like chewy feel and a dry smoky finish. Heavier than most brown ales, but quite delicious. The alcohol peeks through, but the chocolate, burnt/smoked wood and roasted malts cover it up well like a stout would.

The retention was good and the lacing was mostly concentrated at the top 2/3's of the glass. The aroma was nice, roasted malts, nice chocolate notes come out. Slight coffee and brown sugar seems to be present as well. The flavor of this brew is excellent, the roasted and chocolate malt flavors are so crisp and to the point- they make the beer IMO. Has the perfect hop backing to go along with the malts, great flavor here. This is such a smooth beer that the 7.2 ABV is a complete surprise as there was no hint of alcohol in this brew.

M: Very dense with light carbonation, some slickness.  D: Outstanding drinkability despite a relatively high ABV. The alcohol is buried beneath loads of delicious roasted malt.  This beer feels incomplete in some respects. Perhaps with a marginally more robust, roasted character, this would have been one of my favorite porters of all time. As a brown ale, though, I feel like they should have scaled back some of the more robust qualities, because they leave the drinker wanting more (i.e., it is a tease.)

Roasted barley and a myriad of malt character abound. Leaves a nice light alcohol aftertaste that is slightly dry, but fits perfectly with this brew.  M- By no means light, with a very solid body.

A great first impression, particularly served in a simple pint glass.  S: I initially get quite a bit of dry coffee, with light chocolate and heavy nuttiness.  T: A good amount going on here - chocolate, coffee, nuts, light bitter malts. This tastes like a roasted beer, but without anything so aggressive as to be off-putting. Easily I could see how an over-developed bitterness could develop, but it never materialized, making this more enjoyable.  M/D: Dry initially, lingers, but disapates nicely.

Flavor: Robust and roasty dark malt bursting with black coffee and bittersweet chocolate notes takes center stage. On the edges there's a lightly bitter hop component and a hint of smokiness. Big and rich like an American Stout. Chocolaty malt, citrusy hops, and a little bit of booze in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and a little creamy with medium carbonation and light alcohol warmth. Dries just a hint in the finish.

BA's description says it's a cross between a scotch ale, an IPA and an American brown ale...I couldn't agree more. The bottle says the hop bill is comprised of whole leaf Liberty and Golding. DFH demonstrates its mastery by introducing these hop varieties into the Indian Brown Ale.  A: This brew looks fantastic. Amazingly dark brown (if not black), completely opaque body. The size of the head is respectable, light brown and creamy. Lacing is great out of the gates but not much sticks around till the end.  S: Boasting a heavy malt backbone, the contributing aromas are a roasted caramelly, chocately fudge (think Hershey's syrup) and cappuccino. There is an underlying burnt sugary sweetness. Sizable hop aromatics of pine mixed with a faint spruciness. The yeast contribution is earthy and has aromas of new car leather. Very enticing and perfectly complex.  T: The flavor duration is long, appropriately sweet and the hops provide just the right amount of bitterness. Nearly burnt brown sugar, maple syrup and ground black pepper are the supporting flavors. There is a hardly notcieable hint of dark, hard alcohol which is completely intriguing and far from off-putting. Everything has a purpose and stays in check at the same time.  M: More than a medium mouthfeel, this thick and sticky brew leaves little to be desired in the mouthfeel. Lively and fizzy, the level of effervescence needs no tweaking. The Indian Brown Ale tastes slightly sweet, but the finish is dry and chalky in a perfectly acceptable way.  D: More of an 'end your night with' than a 'begin your night with' kind of beer for me, but nonetheless very palatable and definitely worth trying.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,primo26xx,4.17,"I thought long and hard about which beer would have the honors of being the subject of my very first review here on this wonderful site which I've been a member of for over seven years now. Although I'm a dedicated hophead (Pacific northwest-style PAs and IPAs my preferred styles) through-and-through, I couldn't think of a better choice (and more of a challenge for a first-time reviewer) than the rich and wonderfully complex Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale.  Purchased at Premier Beverage House, Sierra Vista's best selection of fine brews, which includes the widest variety of Dogfish Head offerings this side of Tucson - 90 minutes (pardon the pun) northwest of here.  An agressive pour out of the bottle into my favorite pint glass resulted in a 3/4"" creamy, textured, slightly tan head, falling away to yield a lacing which I do not recall seeing from other brown ales. Dark mahogany, what a striking color. I'll try to exercise some amount of brevity in describing the smell and taste of this brew, as each are as equally complex.  Smell is of burnt molasses, roasted coffee, plums - if blindfolded I could swear this were a porter. There's a subdued hop profile going on here, but not too evident at all. Some alcohol, but as with the hops, it's subdued - pretty good for an ABV of 7.2%.  Taste is every bit as complex, and similar, to the aroma. Sweet malts, brown sugar, dark fruit. The bittersweet chocolate is in there, but not as evident to me as it apparently is with many other reviewers. There are my beautiful hops, content with playing a supporting role this time around, but there just enough to get the attention of the taste buds on the backside of the swallow.  Wonderful drinkability and mouth feel. I'm stumped here, as I'm not sure I can say anything that already hasn't been said about this great beer. I will say that while I do find it fairly smooth, it's also on the acidic side, which suits me just fine here anyways. Good level of carbonation on the tounge.  This isn't your average brown ale. But then again, Dogfish Head doesn't do ""average."" At 7.2% ABV, I actually find this beer to be somewhat sessionable, as I can easily (and eagerly) put half a sixer down this afternoon. This beer does deserve respect, though, and I'll do my best to exercise some restraint and reserve the rest for the upcoming work week. I hope that I have done as good with my first-ever review with this brew as this brew has done good by me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Chocolate and hops in the smell as well as the taste. A lot of chocolate/cocoa, with some sweet malt, and earthy hops. Fresher bottles of this beer have more of an emphasis on hops but I actually enjoyed this one quite a bit.

Mild aroma overall.  Appearance: Very dark brown color. Tall, thick, light coffee color head with good retention and a heavy trail. Very clear (can see through it when held to light) with tiny bubble visible.  Flavor: Deep roasted malty flavor with slight hop bitterness. Somewhat dry at the finish (that lingers a bit). Balance is toward maltiness.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with fairly high carbonation that produces some bite. Slightly creamy on the palate. Faint warmth present.

An awesome blending of flavors overwhelm the senses and take ya back a few steps.  Mouthfeel: Roasted (maybe smokey?) aftertaste with a very creamy taste for the most part.

A - Looks like Coca-Cola, thin mocha head, little to no lacing, overall a nice brown ale appearance.  S - Not too heavy on the smell, light smell of chocolate and some earth notes come through.  T - When I first poured this bottle it was in my opinion too chilled for its style, the first tastes were dark, carbonated, bitter, somehow olive tasting. As the beer warmed to room temperature the smoothness and taste definately became better, and by the end of the glass I was thirsty for more!  M - I want this taste on my tongue at all times. Bitter and dark chocolate aftertaste.  D - For me I could drink this everyday, very drinkable and very filling.

Head is off whiteish brown with tiny bubbles and creamy.  Smells like a scotch ale. Rich, dark caramel malts dominate. Hmm, maybe this is too cold. I was expecting more hops in the smell.  On first sip I can feel the hops in my mouth, there they are! The hops dominate the mouth presence of the beer but are not overt. It's a balanced taste. After swallowing, you get the aftertaste of caramel malts and sugars one would associate with this style.  Mouthfeel is pretty freakin' good. Creamy with moderate carbonation. True to the style one might say, but since this is a cross over or hybrid beer style I would say that it works well for a hopped up brown ale.  Drinkability is rather high.

10099,1161,OldSchoolGamer,4,"One of Dogfish Head's year-round offerings. Surprisingly, one of their more traditional offerings as well. Here is my review:  A: Pours a dark brown, almost black color. Almost a dark ruby red when held up to the light. Head is rather limited and lacing is very minimal.  S/T: The aroma is very sweet and roasty. Maybe some coffee and dark fruit in there as well. Taste is quite complex and satisfying. I get brown sugar, raisin, and coffee upfront. Those flavors lead way to a nice roasted malt finish. A little bit on the sweet side overall. Besides 90 Minute, this is the best year-rounder from Dogfish Head, and easily one of the best Brown Ales.  M/D: Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Good carbonation. Somewhat creamy. Drinks rather easily. The sweetness is the main deterrent.  This is quite a pleasant surprise. Considering how flavorful and complex this beer is, this might make it into the beer fridge more often. Not big into Brown Ales, this has just about everything I want from the style. If you are a fan of Dogfish Head, chances are you had this one before. If not, give this one a try.

10099,1161,scuppers,2.34,"Served from my heavy souvenir Oldenberg mug.  Appearance: very dark brown, tan head with some lacing.  Smell: I can smell some restrained hops, but mostly malt and dark flavoring grains. Hints of brown sugar, maple syrup or engine coolant. After the pour, I can detect a little alcohol in the nose. The smell reminds me of a less-forward version of Russian imperial stout or a winter warmer without spices.  Taste: Overwhelming with the malt and dark grains. I should state that I'm not a big fan of brown ales or fruity esters, residual sweetness, or restrained English hops. This one's not hoppy or clean enough for me. As another reviewer mentioned, it reminds me of soy sauce (maybe Chinese food would be a good pairing?) I drank a couple of these very cold yesterday, and today I drank one a little warmer and not as bad as I remember; but for the same price as 6 of these, I could buy 12 pretty reasonable beers. It's not a drainpour, but it's not far off for me. Too much flavoring grains and sweetness (and not enough American hop forwardness) for my taste. It reminds me an awful lot of a sweet stout that I brewed last month. I think they worked hard to get the bittering hops dialed in, and that shows, but for me there is a lack of clean hop flavor or aroma.  Mouthfeel: smooth at first, but as the bubbles come it leaves this dry feeling that's hot and kind of unpleasant. I would say this is the opposite of refreshing unless you've been out in the snow.

Scents of toffee, toasted bread, almonds, and light alcohol waft out. This smells very inviting.  The mouth is a tad thin. I've had this a few times and have noticed this same characteristic. Could stand a bit more carbonation zip. Sweet flavors of toffee, caramel, toasted nuts, and brown sugar are present.

The aroma is somewhat mild, but there's suggestions of chocolate, sticky hops, and roasted grains.  The taste is very flavorful for a brown ale. Molasses, caramel, and chocolate flavors blend well with the hop character.  Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is right on target...not too much, not too little.  I could drink a couple of these, but it's nothing that I'd sit around and drink all night.  Morey's Bottom Line: I like this beer much more than I used to.

The mild sweetness complements the roast, the toffee and the pine character quite beautifully. The flavors are equally good, if not better. Opening with a mild pine bitterness that's quickly overtaken by a melange of malt flavors with brown sugar, coffee, chocolate and some roast. Pine character is perceived on the back as well. Again, the balance is exceptional. Medium bodied with a soft, smooth carbonation and a long lasting complex finish with a blend of burnt caramel, pine and mild sweetness, this is definitely my favorite regularly released DFH brew. Two pints later, I could have gone back for more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,dasenebler,4.3,"Pours very dark mahogany, ruby tints. Modest off-white head, good lacing. Aroma is pleasant-- lots of sweet malt, bit of maple syrup and a touch of alcohol.  Flavor is excellent. This is one of the best, most well-balanced beers DFH makes. Initial medium sweetness and brown sugar flavor gives way to a dark maltiness, and solid bitterness to the tune of 50 IBU. Touch of medium roast coffee. Mildly citric hops. Medium-heavy mouthfeel; syrupy and creamy. A nice kick at 7.2 percent, but not too detectable. Really easy to drink for such a malty and strong brown ale.  Like Palo Santo Marron, the Indian Brown is a strong, unorthodox Brown ale. DFH fills that niche of near-porter/stout hoppy dark ales pretty damn well. Great stuff here.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,climax,4.33,"This was a real good lookin brew. It was deep brown, red around the glowing edges, a biblical foamy head that didn't feel like sinking too badly.  Nose was roasted coffee, a bit bitter with the right amount of slightly sweet dark chocolate and brown sugar. The brown sugar became more and more dominant as the beer warmed.  Yea, this one tasted pretty damn good as well. Real smooth buttery dark sugars, chocolate and coffee. The warmth of alcohol sneaks itself in. Slight hop profile slipped through the dark malt barricade to finish it off.  Feel was very smooth, carbonation just right. Finish was roasty and dry egging for another sip....or chug. This is an excellent beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Beejay,4.5,"A: Nice brownish red. Beautiful color, with nice tan head.  S: Hoppy, but with a very sweet malt scent as well. Like a scotch ale with extra hops. A molasses or brown sugar scent coming though.  T: Malty and sweet, with enough hops to add in a kick. Ends with a nice roasty flavor. Quite a delicious beer.  M: Medium bodied, slightly sticky, but appropriate carbonation. Smooth, and creamy finish.  D: Very nice. Rich, but with just enough hops to balance it out. Very nice, something I will look for again. Well balanced, and a great creamy mouth feel.

The dark fruits (rasins, dates) are there, but also this interesting spice kick. Bitter finish. The ""cross between scotch, IPA and brown ales"" is dead on. Quite different (as expected from DH). Superior quality, but I'm not sure if I like it enough to get it again. Definitely worth the first purchase though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,jeffthecheff,4.5,"Served in a DFH regular pint glass. The color is a dark, wood like brown with some light shining through the edges. The head is a tan, kind of milkshake color. The retention is excellent and the lacing is good.  The first thing that came to mind from the aroma was chocolate milk. As it warmed up, some sweet, scotch ale maltiness comes through. Sweet, dark fruits. I'm also getting some molasses. It smells like someone is baking something real nice.  The flavor is a nice mixture of a brown and scotch ale. It has the subtle, fruity, chocolaty and nutty flavors of a brown, with more of a big, sweet malt depth to it. Brown sugar presense is there, and there is also a hint of rum. I'm not sure if there is supposed to be much hop presence in this beer (INDIA brown ale?) but if there is, it's getting hidden by the other flavors. This is a very unique tasting beer, and it pulls off a lot of flavors at once.  The mouthfeel of this beer is great. Since I'm not a fan of rich, malty scotch ales, but enjoy a sweet beer, the body is just where I want it. It's rich, full bodied, but not cloying. Carbonation is good.

T - Chocolate initially, followed up by a bit of sweet candy toffee, and then finishes with an aggressive hop bite. Unique and big but not overdone.  M/D - Full body, easily drinkable. The smell and taste indicate this is a big beer but there is no indication it's as strong as the label suggests.

Nice off-white head that lingers with some great lace. S- I smell dark malts and coffee. Just the smell tells you this is not going to be a usual brown. T- This beer is full of flavor. Starts off with heavy malts, sugars and hop flavors. Those fade into the more heavy coffee and ester flavors. Finishes with a slight bitterness that is not really noticed unless you look for it. M- Has a very malty character that is not my favorite. But with every good thing comes at least on bad. Right?

10099,1161,infi,4.2,"Poured into a nonic pint.  Pours a nice rustic dark brown color that's almost opaque, with a fat frothy off-white/tanish head that dissipates after a while and leaves a good amount of lacing throughout the drink duration. The smell is rich with toasted and roasted characteristics of the malt and barley. You can definitely smell the caramelized sugar, along with some hints of coffee and the hops. The taste is equally incredible; it's so akin to drinking a cup of coffee. The roasted flavor of the malt and caramelized sugar come into play first - so smooth. Then there is some sort of fruitiness that overlaps the initial flavors and coats the tongue very well. Then towards the end, there is a slight bitterness from the hops, alongside the warmth of the alcohol. The ale carries a light to medium body with not a lot of bubbling action going on. Also, the drinkability is very high - a sixer of these could disappear within a night's session.  A great gem from Dogfish Head - definitely worth a taste.  *Originally reviewed July 23, 2009.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,homebrew311,4.3,"A: Pours a dark brownish mahogany with a pillowy layer of head, about two fingers thick. The bubbles are thick and has a creamy appearance.  S: An initial wallop of roasted grains, similar to the grain profile of a stout/porter/brown. Notes of caramel, chocolate, and coffee. The hops are not that detectable on the nose. Not sure if that has to do with this bottle being from February.  T: The malts are a little more subdued in the tongue as compared to the smell. The flavor profile is robust but mellow at the same time. I know this sounds odd as the two are opposite, but there is a lot of flavor that is mellowed out by the silky texture. Very nice flavor. A lot of things going on here... I taste the hops that I did not initially smell. This is a true hybrid of styles.  M: this beer is very nice on the mouthfeel. As mentioned earlier, it is silky and goes down smoothly. The carbonation is low which suits the beer nicely.  D: This is probably my favorite DFH offering.

10099,1161,yemenmocha,3.8,"Pours a slightly hazy dark brown with tan head that retains well and laces well. Nose has a fresh bread & nougat aroma. On the palate the hops dominate far more than expected, almost leaving the roasty flavors too far behind in the background. It's not a traditional brown ale and it's a struggle to appreciate it for what it is.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,biegaman,4.32,"Just one look at it tells you that this is no faint-hearted brown ale - only when held right up into the light is any sort of gleam visible and even then transparency is still denied. The center of the beer is a stygian mass of dark brown. Auburn can be observed but only a thin sliver of it and only along the very edges. A bed of suds form a crescent moon shape atop the beer; it's not entirely thorough but it is enduring.  The aroma is resoundingly malty but isn't without an appreciable earthiness, likely contributed by the whole-leaf Liberty and Goldings hops. It's a wonder their presence can be noted despite the strength of its (more porter-like) notes of dark chocolate and heavily roasted coffee beans. The nuttiness is enticing and the caramelized brown sugar seeps into your nasal passage causing its sweetness to flutter about your senses.  You could drink this thing from a shoe and it would taste pretty good to me. Indian Brown Ale is bursting with flavour. A fresher sample might yield a little more tanginess from the hops but I'm surprised the maltiness in this bottle didn't cause it to rupture! This plunges the depths of the style: chocolate-covered hazelnut, roast pecans, coffee macerated gingerbread and caramel crunch cake make for the quintessential tasting brown ale.  But if there's anywhere this beer deserves credit it very well might be its mouthfeel. There is constantly a light but lingering graininess to remind us of the malts. It comes replete with roast and an ounce of smokiness. The flavour is deliciously savory with a sort of winter-warmer type warming sensation. The caramelized brown sugar, for its part, contributes the perfect level of sweetness to compliment the bitter tastes of chocolate and coffee.  This is definitely a new world depiction of the style - and unarguably one of the most prolific. I can see how drinkers in the UK might find this interpretation of their beloved ale ""extreme for the style"" or ""too strong for its own good"" (to cite a couple quotes from a well publicized British magazine on beer). But for us on the other side of the Atlantic, this has exactly the temperament we like - I guess we're just off-centered people?!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Great head on the initial ""down the middle"" pour which dissipates after a minute or so (in an imperial glass). Dark brown or burned carmel color with moderate carbonation.  Smell:The aromatics are strong, yet sweet. Reminiscent of a traditional scotch ale. The malt is noticeable at first with some hops but, the alcohol smell lingers faintly. Not bad at all  Taste: Spicy, malty, sweet with mild hop notes. This is very challenging to analyze because of it's complexity. It is sweet up front with a mild alcohol flavor which slowly fades to a dark chocolate then hop finish.  Mouthfeel: I love the mouthfeel! It's thick and creamy but not super filling. The creaminess allows for the drinker to pick up all of the flavors.  Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable despite it's high ABV.

A- Dark, dark, chestnut/rum/coffee brown with an attractive, thick, creamy, tan head. Fantastic lacing right off the bat. The foam is incredibly dense, millions of microscopic bubbles.  S- Malt bomb, for sure. Hops are there, too, but damn, that's a bready, malty, rich aroma. Like a whole-grain bread dipped in coffee. Very inviting. Miles beyond any traditional brown ale... but this is DFH we're talking about!  T- A richness that is almost unparalleled. Supreme dark fruit, mild bitter coffee, and a roasty, toasty malt base provide enough of a platform for the slightly peppery hops to come through. I remember fresher bottles being more hoppy, but this beer with a year on it is sublime. Actually, I may prefer it this way. Hmm. Amazing depth and character, by far the best American Brown Ale I've ever had, outside the Palo Santo.. which is more of an Imp. Brown/Strong Ale anyways.  M- Thick, like pancake batter, with enough carbonation to keep things moving along. Imparts an amazing flavor... which lingers until well after the beer is gone.  D- Moderately high. Rich, full-flavored, and a bit heavy... but oh-so-tasty. Although at 7% its at the low end of the DFH beers, this one more than holds its own. I am in love with this beer, and heartily recommend it to anyone who has access to it. I remember seeing an interview with Sam Caligione (spelling?) and hearing him say that this is the beer that most employees choose as their free monthly cases. I can see why.

Good 1 inch head of tan foam with some really outstanding lacing throughout the entire beer.  Smell truly is caramelized brown sugar with some roasted malt and a little hop citrus.  Taste is really far superior to what I remember. Caramelized brown sugar comes right through and is followed by a slight hop bitterness with a roasty, earthy flavor.  Mouthfeel is quite enjoyable, carbonation is lively and the body is a thin to medium wash that lasts just the right amount.  Drinkability is the key here.

Its sweet with a pleasant blend of spices, the hazelnut coffee taste really stands out, but even if you don't like that flavor there is enough supporting cast of flavors to allow you an enjoyment of this wonderfully complex brew.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation on the tongue is perfect for this beer; the beer is in the middle as far as the body goes; aftertaste is minimal and not even bad.  Drinkability: Its enjoyable, it's a sipping beer, but mostly because it is so complex and awesome that you just want to slow down and enjoy the beer. Now that its gone I want more.

10099,1161,craftaholic,4.34,Appearance: Pours a very deep red-brown thats only transparent up to light with visible carbonation much like a pint of pepsi and has a head that begs to grow but never gets past a half finger length.  Smell: Quite complex with a dominant molasses note for sure. There is definitely some caramelized malt and hints of chocolate and hazelnut that combine with a scent of freshly brewed java.  Taste: Super smooth and insanely complex. There is really a touch of everything here from intricate malty sugars and roasted grains to chocolatey coffee hints that unfold to a wash of hop bitterness that are mixed back in with a bit of fruit and finishes like a stout.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and syrupy slick with just the right pinch of carbonation but the alcohol is noted. Doesn't drink as heavy as the color suggests.  Drinkability: Session your heart out but have someone handy to hold you back or this sixer will find itself empty and will do you in for sure.  Overall: This is like a prius of the brew world. A hybrid of the IPA and brown ale equals an experiment gone incredibly right in my honest opinion.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,aristeros,4.45,"Poured into my Bodum pint glass. Leaves around half a finger of off-white head that settles rather quickly. It's a dark red-brown, like a cola. Great clarity, visible carbonation. Looks good.  Strong roasted malt presence in the nose, but also sweeter malts. Light chocolate and coffee. Similar to a porter.  Sweet malts yield to big roasted coffee flavors. Some nuts, maybe a few earthy notes. A little dark fruit and a good hop presence in the end, enough to add character. Medium- to full-bodied with moderate carbonation that feels appropriate. Alcohol is pretty well masked, but if they could've masked it just a little better it would help it as a session beer.  I am kicking myself that I got just two for the review-and-try and didn't get a six pack, because this is really an exceptional beer. Easily joins my favorite brown ales and is likely to become a go-to brew for me in the future because it's able to sort of straddle several beer categories at once while still being a superior brown ale and not seeming weird.

Leaves beautiful layers of lacing after every sip.  S: Smells sweet and of toasted malt. Some earthy hops as well.  T: Toasted/roasted malt provides a nutty coffee like character, but overall well balanced by the big hop bitterness. Tastes like an over-hopped stout, and definitely finishes like a stout.

10099,1161,MaxBrews,4.22,"Presentation: 12oz bottle poured into pint glass  Appearance: With my pour I only generated a small half finger width head. I know this beer has more to offer. Color depending on what light your in ranges from Black, dark brown, Cola brown and can have a bit of brownish purple hue. Transparent only when held up to light.  Smell: Caramelized malt smells like sweet caramel and chocolate melting into coffee. Hops aren't very present in the aroma but a dry floral aroma does nip at the nose occasionally. The malt really takes over in the aroma.  Taste: from the first sip you get a great picture that this is an excellent all rounder. This beer combines caramel and coffee flavors with herbal hops creating this great earthy but yet sweet palate. Hop flavors are always present and are more of the herbal and floral variety in their flavor characteristics.  Moutfeel: Quaffable would be an understatement. There is a lot of body but it doesn't taste heavy like its color would suggest. My only real complaint with this beer is that the finish is really dry leaving you thirsty.  Drinkability: So you like stouts, porters, brown ales and IPAs? Well heres the beer for you. Really the best of 4 or maybe 5 worlds, its dark but it drinks like a lighter beer. You should drink hardily from you glass cos this begs you to. Warning if you get a six pack of this you will be drunk.

The head is off-white to light tan and though it dissipates rather quickly it does manage to stick nicely to the side of the glass and shows some moderate lace. An alluring aroma of roasted malt characteristics like coffee and bittersweet chocolate. The flavor is quite deep with chocolate, caramel and coffee along with some subtle herbal notes and a hint of a dark cherry fruitiness. The hop flavor is nicely integrated and is neither overpowered by or overpowering the malt. It has a sticky feeling to it that I found pleasant and not at all cloying, almost like a piece of dark chocolate. Highly drinkable though the high ABV can sneak up on you. The depth of flavor seems to carry the alcohol quite nicely. I can see this beer doing wonders with a decent steak or some BBQ ribs.

Shared the vessel on Thursday Sept. 3 to kick off a ridiculous tasting at my house.  Pours a dark brown, clearish fluid with reddish hues. Smallish head but it could have seeped some carbonation between Rehoboth and Northern Virginia. Head is a very light tan color consisting of mostly tiny bubbles.  The smell is complex and excellent. The dominant smell is a molasses sweetness that has a slight zip or tang to it. There are also hints of toasted grains and a slight noticeable hint of peated malt smell. Maybe there is even a bit of chocolate in there.  The taste has that DFH signature tangy sweetness that to DFH virgins comes as a shock and usually either converts them to disciples of the book of Calagione or haters! Extreme flavor isn't for everyone, but I love DFH. The malty sweetness happens up front and but gives way to the toastiness, smoky peated flavor in the finish.  Mouthfeel is really nice with a medium full body and light carbonation (maybe due to loss of CO2 over the course of a few days in a less than perfect vessel). Nonetheless, I actually really like the low level of carbonation this thing has right now.  Drinkability is great. There is a slight residual aftertaste of smokiness that not all will enjoy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

T: Up front is a toasty sweet malt flavor, hops clean that away pretty quickly, and it rounds out with a great roast finish.  M: Nothing wrong here. Might be a little sweet, but both the hop and roast bitterness balance this on the tongue.  D: Very high, even at this abv. The sugar likely lightens it enough to be this drinkable.

S: A nutty, almost hazelnut-like chocolate smell with some espresso and a cacao-like bitterness floating in the background.  T: Nutty, roasted malt flavor leads to a whole host of other tastes: coffee, caramel, cacao, toffee, pralines. Then a gorgeous dark roasted malt taste takes over and ends on bitterly sharp note.  M: Slightly watery at first, then becomes strong, heavy, and full-bodied. The aftertaste lasts forever.  D: Very nice to sip; somewhat like a toned-down version of the Palo Santo Marron.

The toffee and plum flavors are strong and distinct with a nice hoppy bitterness and flavor, However, to me these two flavors were both present but not married together to create a unified taste experience.  M: Rich, luxurious mouthfeel. Nice carbonation and nice lingering smack of hop bitterness that persists.  D: My ultimate test here is how badly I want more after drinking some, and frankly I'm satisfied but not so excited about more. It was nice, just not all I was expecting.

So, I had to go to Durango to get it. My buddy G.I. Joe wasn't up for an IPA, so we opted for this Indian Brown Ale as a compromise. From what I knew about the 90 Minute IPA, this would be a potent beer.  And it was.... There is a very malty, tart alcohol flavor to the beer, and it offers up a strong aftertaste to boot. You can really taste the roasted, nutty oat flavor. And it was surprisingly hoppy, but not so much you'd assume you accidently poured a dirty IPA. I should have figured an IBA would have some hop in it. With a 7.2% ABV, it had a kick to it....  Beer Score version 2.0 is going to kick in with this beer, so any comments - very welcome. This will be a similar scoring system to Beer Advocate (so I can double post), but also will feature some other aspects of the beer that my lovely wife thought would be helpful.  Look - 4.0/5.0 - A really nice brown color for the beer, with an almond-esqe creamy head Smell - 4.0/5.0 - You can really smell the oats and malt, but the alcohol aroma is a bit more than I would have liked. Taste - 4.5/5.0 - A wonderful blend of hop with a brown ale that created a very unique taste Feel - 4.0/5.0 - Robust flavor and strong aftertaste. Drinkability - 4.0/5.0 - Would have this one again - the hybrid of the brown ale and IPA makes for an interesting flavor.  Light (1) - Dark (10) - 7...This is a brown ale, so it's not as bitch black as a stout or porter, but it's a pretty dark beer. Clear (1) - Cloudy (10) - 3...while this beer is not transparent (b/c it's dark), it isn't cloudy/unfiltered. Sweet (1) - Bitter (10) - 7....due to the hybrid nature of this beer, the brew is higher than you'd expect in a brown, but still not as bitter as you'd expect in an IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

The aroma wasn't very strong, has a smell more like a porter than any type of ale. Has the smell of some chocolate malts, then some hops which are not as strong as the malts. I found the taste interesting. Much like the smell, but seems to have a bit more, maybe some dark fruit and/or barley. Extremely full bodied beer, not much of a carbonation bite to it, left my mouth feeling a bit dry though, found the beer fairly drinkable.

10099,1161,dreamgazer,4.5,"It's hard to beat Dogfish Head's Indian Brown ale when you're venturing into the darker ranges of craft brews, as this higher-BAC, affordable porter / stout mishmash certainly offers one of the more complex, delectable experiences around. Poured into a stemless snifter from a 12 oz bottle, purchased at Green's on Ponce in Atlanta.  Dogfish Head's Indian Brown pours a deep, rich brown, barely translucent at certain angles to reveal a thick brown amber shade. The scent leans surprisingly to both floral and fruity notes, hinting at a crisp alcohol-laced naturalness that makes the brew feel very earth to the nostril. It sticks with you, especially the hop-infused bite at the end of each quaff. With an aggressive pour, it'll render a ½ inch cream-colored head that lingers for only a minute or so. That creaminess causes a bit of lacing as the beer level falls lower and lower in the glass.  With each taste, Dogfish Head's flagship dark ale will enchant with each sip. It'll grasp your tastebuds a bit, as the alcohol content is a bit higher than other porters and brown ales of its ilk. But the slightly sweet, floral essence from the quaffs translates over to each sip, all while keeping a nutty flavor at the core of its flavor. What's especially impressive is the hop-styled bubbly punch that hits the mouth with each taste, something that stays memorable after the bottle has been finished. Each mouthful is moderately thick with a hint of sweetness, masking the alcohol flavor well. There's complexity present in this brew, a level of layered flavoring that's both rich and pleasant.  Though labeled as a style of ""brown ale"", Dogfish Head's Indian Brown consistently reminds one more of a porter-like brew infused with a bouquet of impressive, complex hops and earthy notes that impresses with each bottle. It's a personal favorite, and easily one of Dogfish Head's best brews - which, conveniently, happens to be one of their least expensive as well.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

'Discovered' it on a recent visit to Hank's Oyster Bar in DC, so I had to grab one once I returned home. 12 oz. bottle, poured to a pint.  Laser printed on the neck: ""Bottled on 03/18/09 C""  A: Looks 'brown' after the pour, but shines with a brilliant ruby-mahogany clarity when held to light. Few bubbles wriggle upward, lazily. Head is a pile of dusty tan cream, cresting right at two-fingers. Cream dies down over a couple minutes, becoming a thinner blanket of suds, leaving coating drapes up the sides of the glass.  S: Baked cookies, chocolate and caramel. Traces of vanilla and coffee beans. Malts don't win entirely, but are more predominant than the balancing grassy hops. A faint solvent alcohol whiff.  T: Very heavy roast builds as the seconds pass post-sip. A bold mix of sugared espresso, dark chocolate (slight lemon tang), caramel chews, black tea, and adequate hop spicing/bittering (Liberty & Goldings used, so says the label). Picks up a trace of smoke and a little of that sugary 'liquour' booziness.  M: Coating feel, zesty carbonation, oddly leaves me salivating/seeking the next taste. Body is considerably heavier than the 'typical', but most brown ales aren't 7+%...most brown ales also aren't hybrids, combining such big malt roast and ample hop bittering...both last for many minutes after.  D: Very good brew, interesting to the point of being unique (perhaps?).

S- Nice roasty nose... a bit nutty... and some hints of metal in there (I get copper and iron every few whiffs). The nose also seems to allude to a sweeter taste on the way...  T- I am getting some nice roasty flavors here (not overpowering) and a prominent flavor of candied nuts... specifically candied cashews and almonds. Beautiful. There's some low-alpha hops here in the middle, adding a touch of bitterness to the brew- just enough to balance the chewy malt. Finishes clean with the sweet malt, nuts and hops... none of which overpowers the other in the finish.  M- Creamy and full bodied... I wouldn't call it ""silky""... just creamy. Lots of unattenuated sugar here and a good amount of carbonation keep this sugar from feeling to sticky.  D- VERY VERY drinkable. Could drink this all day.  Notes: Had this beer along with a chocolate and pralines torte. Absolutely exquisite pairing!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,DeeMented,4.2,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a glass beer mug.  The beer poured a very deep, dark, and clear brown that looked like a red crystal around the edges of the glass. It was topped with a thick, creamy, off-white head that left moderate amounts of lacing on the glass.  The smell is a complex aroma. I picked out sweet caramel, a toasted, malty aroma, and a hint of coffee. As it warmed, I also got an earthy, woody smell.  The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy. I'd go so far as to call it velvety.  The taste was as complex as the smell. It started sweet and malty, with a bit of chocolate. The finish had a nice hops bite, followed by a lingering coffee taste. And yet, after the coffee flavor started to fade off the tongue, it left a sweet chocolaty flavor.  As it warmed, the hops bitterness and the coffee finish became more pronounced, and seemed to take over the beer. That's just my opinion, of course. It was still very good, but it just seemed to lose its balance as it got warmer.  At 7.20 % ABV, this is a dangerously drinkable beer. Very enjoyable, I found it went down way too fast, and left me wanting another.  I'm not sure how sessionable this is. Call me a lightweight, but I was starting to feel a buzz after just one of these.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,wl0307,4,"Purchased from the BSF bar, GBBF 2008; BB 12/08, served faintly-chilled to cool in Hapkin's bulb-shaped bowl sniffer.  A: super dark brown in colour, coming with restrained carbonation and a light tan frothy head, settling slowly to a thin blanket to last throughout the drink. S: the aroma is as deeply malty as lively hoppy, showing an assertive presence of chocolaty brown malts, sweet walnuts, treacle-ish sweet notes and dried red dates, while the hops are pronounced on the flowery and lightly longan-fruity sides. Not much fruitiness is detected even after a swirl, apart from random notes of raisin-like sour-sweetness. Overall, attractive, but not quite complex as I'd imagined from Dogfish Head. T: like the aroma, the flavour is immediately sweet pecan-nutty, with random touches of coffee-flavoured milk and toffee, rather light semi-sour cold filtered coffee and date-ish fruitiness, while the whole weight is lifted skilfully by the hop presence that turns more expressed in the latter half of the tasting. The aftertaste continues with the lightly sour yet also bitter-sweet flavour, with an interesting bite of herbal hops where the flowery bouquet also mixes well with everything else lingering in the finish. M&D: the flavour is not that different from a porter ale, if you ask me, but the body is much lighter and focused on nutty malts like a brown ale, truly. The finishing touch is slightly more sour/lactic than my palate prefers, though. I'd rate it higher if the carbonation was softer and the hoppiness could somehow outshine the present balance for the flavour profile. But, all in all, this ale is not bad at all.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,FstrungUCoutT,4.4,"I was fortunate enough to have this beer at the DFH brewery while in Rehoboth Beach, DE. I was even more fortunate to be there when they broke open a cask of it on a Thursday night. So obviously, this review is a little different from having it from a bottle.  A - nice dark brown color, almost opaque. With having it on cask there was very little head but more of a slight cascade of very small bubbles down the sides of the glass.  S - smelled slightly of caramel and coffee but not at all over powering. The roasted barley was definitely evident in the smell.  M - this is the other section that is greatly different due to the fact that I had it from a cask. It was smooth and creamy and perfect. After tasting this beer on cask, its tough to want to try it any other way. Very little carbonation and it just coated your entire mouth with a warm, smokey feel.  T - I loved this beer. Slight hints of chocolate, coffee, and caramel with a slight little hopiness that is just noticeable enough. Nicely complex flavors. I just couldn't stop drinking it and could've easily spent the entire night there having this cask conditioned ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,bwd110,3.89,"12oz bottle poured into a tumbler.  A: Deep, dark brown that refuses to let through even a sliver of light. Decent, tan head -- more sticky than fluffy. Looks like a good porter or stout from here.  S: Quite aromatic. I can see where the scotch ale comparison comes in, but it is quite roasty with hints of coffee, reminiscent of the chicory stout? Some underlying hop presence as well.  T: Very hearty and complex flavor profile. This one is all about the roasted and caramel malts. Great roasted coffee and bittersweet dark chocolate tones. Hops are present, but generally add to the overall taste instead of dominating it... Nice smoky finish!  M: Very rich, full body. Makes for a nice smooth brew that lingers, but still leaves the tongue wanting more. Nice.  D: Here's where this beer takes a little hit for me. One or two is great. But after that, I need a switch up. A lot going on here, and it needs to be consumed in neat little bursts.  Overall, another hit for me from DFH.

Nose of cocoa nibs, chicory,molasses, anise, milk chocolate, dark fruits. The flavour profile is sweet pit fruits with milk chocolate, some coffee, molasses, a bit of hoisin, leafy greens, and fresh bitter hops. Nice finish, but perhaps a bit sweet for me to have any more than one. Thanks Chris!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,flagmantho,4.65,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: a nicely dark, brown amber with a very thick, foamy head with a nice persistence. As I drink it, much of the foam sticks to the glass in a nice, thick lace.  Smell: a delicious nutty aroma with coffee and caramel. This smells awesome; I'm dizzy with anticipation.  Taste: deliciously complex. The bitterness is just perfectly present and there is a nice chocolate finish. There are some light fruity notes and a little alcohol flavor, but these are outshined by the great malt flavors.  Mouthfeel: a medium-thick body which sort of coats the tongue and spreads around the deliciousness.  Drinkability: while I submit that it is too hot here to really appreciate a dark, high-alcohol beer, this thing is so tasty that I would gladly have another (and another, and another).  It's so rare that I randomly try a beer and have it instantly rank among my favorites. Or possibly be my favorite of all time. This thing is more like a porter than a brown ale in my opinion, but for a beer this good I really don't care what style you want to call it. A+.  ----  Edited ratings on 5/16/2010. This was one of my first reviews; I wanted to review again now that I have a lot more beer-tasting experience.  Body remains translucent and extremely dark; very nice. Aroma is mostly coffee and light earthy, vegetabley hops; again, quite nice. Flavor is big gobs of nice roasty malt flavor; mostly coffee and a little caramel toward the end. Bitterness is high for a dark beer. Medium to medium-thick body with great carbonation; this is wonderfully creamy and silky. This beer remains extremely tasty and drinkable compared to when I first had it.  I actually reduced some of the ratings from the all-5s I originally gave it to really score it like I would today; however, this beer still rates as one of my all-time favorites.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

T- A pretty good brown ale... a big coffee flavor followed by some piney/leafy hops... a bit one dimensional I guess, but I like it. Robust flavor that lingers. Slight bitter finish. A bit woody/smokey at times as well. Some alcohol comes through too, giving it a sweet kick too.  M- Creamy and coating. Medium carbonation that works well.

Smells of barley, hops, brown sugar, possible spices and even vanilla; this beer has a very lively nose.  The brown sugar and spice aromas are mirrored in the palate. In addition, the flavor also has a nice caramel malt presence that blends well with the earthy hops at the finish and additional coffee notes as it warms.  Very smooth with a medium body and medium to moderate carbonation, and just a hint of alcohol warmth at the end.  What an excellent beer.

A nice full foam head, even in the bottle after a pour.  Smell: First smell is the malt, then comes the coffee- even burnt coffee, and after that the hops come into play. Aromatic. Enchanting. A whole mysterious fantasy lies within the bottle, waitiing to be discovered. This just might be a grand experience.  Taste: After some really fine Abbey Brown Ale's this one is different. This is.. different. Deep tasting. Lots of Malt-Hops-Coffee flavour. Wow! Another swallow, another taste. Wow. There's chocolate now, and raisins. Perhaps the coffee bitterness is balanced by a berry or currant taste leading to sweet. Its at the tail end. Try to see if you can taste the currant. Its there- right there at the end. Very nice. Very full.  General overall: I am an IPA fan, yet not always a lover of brown ales, yet this very nicely combines the two. One damn fine beer. And at 7.2 % it is truly top shelf. So full tasting.

Taste: Major malt explosion upfront - strong caramel, fruit and roasted notes, maybe even a slight smokiness. Bitter at the end, much more so than other Browns, with a persistent bitter aftertaste.

This is a malt whirpool in your mouth, eye-crossing siren of a creation that you should work yourself up to, armed with a stomach lined by a beer and pretzels with hot mustard. It's recommended that you take it sitting down.  The beer poured out of the bottle nice and dark with a significant fine foamy head, and I had to let it sit for a little while and warm up to room temperature because I'd opened it straight from the liquor store. Do not drink this beer when it is in any way too cold or it will taste like you are noshing on maple syrup for a dare. Even when warm, there isn't much of a noticeable aroma. This beer holds its secrets close.  The first sip fills the entire mouth with a dark molasses-like boof of an explosion, like a Hawaiian basaltic lava that's inevitably going to cover your house and your dog and your ex-wife and your sandals but is taking its sweet, gentle time about it. The flavor reaches up into your nose, and that's where the hop flavor can be detected as a hovering will-o-the-wisp atop a bog of delicious despair.  It took me a really long time to finish the first one. Then I took a break involving an IPA and a sandwich with corned beef in it.

Taste is malty and nutty, there is a nice bitterness as well, overall I'm not impressed with the taste too much. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Drinkability is just above average.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,SuperSpy,4.45,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  The beer is a crystal clear brown with rich amber highlights when held to the light. There is a dark tan, one finger head. As the foam dies down it leaves a thick lace along the sides of the glass and creamy film over the top of the beer.  The aroma is full of chocolate, roasted grains, a touch of vanilla, light roasted coffee and even a very faint hint of licorice. In short this smells incredibly yummy.  The flavor is immediately chocolaty upfront and followed with sweet caramel and roasted malt. The flavor as the last drops leave the the tongue and the carbonation hits the back of the throat is a mixture of the caramel and vanilla followed by a well sweetened light roast coffee. What hops are there balance the sweetness just enough to keep this beer from becoming too sweet. This flavor is complex, harmonic and absolutely delicious.  With a medium-light body and a nice crisp amount of carbonation this beer is a little lighter than I had anticipated. With that being said I think this beer goes down very easily but making it a little heavier wouldn't hurt.  With the complexity of flavor in this beer, you should sit down and drink it slowly and you may want to have more than one just so you can go back to when it was first poured and relive every moment of that initial glass.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,COBeerBuff,4.07,"Appearance: Pours a chocolaty translucent brown color with tons of reddish light coming through the sides. An off-white finger of head doesn't stick around very long. There is some great lacing around the edges of the glass as the beer disappears.  Smell: Chocolate, roasted grains, some notes of barley, a sprinkling of vanilla, and peek or two of coffee. This is a yummy smelling brown ale.  Taste: In a surprising reflection of the nose, the taste bears hints of chocolate, roasted grains, coffee, and vanilla.  Mouthfeel: This is a very light and crisp American Brown ale. The hops provide a nice bite, but the finish is smooth and very unsticky.  Drinkability: At 7.2% ABV, this American Brown might be on the high edge of the sessionable beers, but the smoothness and variety of flavors definitely make me want to sample a few of these.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,oldirtycaffrey,3.85,"Christened my new Sam Adams 'Turbulator' pint glass with this excellent brew. Pours a dark brown/near black color with a small, foamy tan head. The smell is pretty amazing -- deep, dark, sweet, roasted chocolate with hints of toffee. It really is more like a porter/stout, in my opinion. The taste is also sweet, a little bitter, with a nice coffee aftertaste. Its bitterness coupled with a potent 7.20 % ABV makes it perhaps a difficult beer to have more than one or two, but it really is a beautiful beer to sit back and enjoy slowly.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,hedgiewan,4.77,"A- heavy light-brown head becomes a thin film. Beer is a clear reddish-brown.  S- Caramel, tobacco, light grass with a bit of brush-smoke (not wood-smoke).  T- Grass and greenery on the front, solid brown malt flavor, mid-hop finish. Relatively low bitterness.  M- Midrange, slightly sharp but consistent.  F- Lingering smokey hop flavor. Clean, not sweet or muddy.  Overall: I could drink this every day. This is a brown ale that transitions well to summer heat with a strong hop presence, but without the acrid taste of many IPA's. The day I first had this beer the outside temp was hovering around 90F and it was brilliant, but I can see it carrying over well into the cooler months with its heavier-than-average (for a brown) body and slightly smoked character.

10099,1161,damienblack,3.97,"Pours a medium-thick dark brown, like a lighter stout. Not much in the way of head or lacing. Smells pretty hoppy at first, so I think, uh oh. But then I get a whiff of a sweet brown sugar, and all is well. Taste is just like a hoppy but well balanced brown. Maybe a little less burnt malt and a little more caramelized instead. Got a bit of a sweet kick buried in there. But all of the sweet is balanced out by some healthy hopping. Maybe a little low in carbonation, but not that big of an issue. After a bit, is pretty easy drinking. Definitely a different beer, and one worth checking out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

A touch of floral hops is present as well.  T- Lots of malts make the backbone of this one. Ranging from toasted bread to burn sugars as well as some chocolate flavors. Some floral hops stand up nicely to the malts; there bitterness is in check but definitely present. The roasted/burnt flavors linger on the palate creating a dry finish.

M: Sturdy and full-bodied. Ever-so-slightly sticky mouthfeel and a sweet, clean finish.  D: Addictive taste and superb balance make for a very drinkable brew.  I really like this beer.

Smells like chocolate, and caramel also a slight aroma of hops.  Taste has a very gritty brown sugar,and chocolate taste. With a nice big malty finish to it.  Mouth is very crisp,clean and a sting on the tongue. Full bodied,with great carbonation and a stickiness is left behind on the lips.  Drink is very good for 7% ABV.

I did everything backwards this time I set the beer on it's side in a drawer in my fridge. I then analyzed it when it was damn near frozen. So now I adjusted my ratings.  The appearence was spectacular. I actually took pictures afterwards it left micro-tiny bubbles,(all thick and creamy looking) that left rings after every gulp I took.( I have never seen this before ). The Taste didn't leave that grittiness I talked about it was much smoother,a more roasted flavoring as well. The smell dumbed down a little bit not much came through.

Caramel and cold black coffee. Grassiness and nuttiness and sweet citrus fruits and brown sugar. There's almost a smoky booziness in the background. The alcohol is apparent and nicely warming. A very complex contrast of complimentary flavors. Kind of an odd duck for the style, sort of like a bitter scotch ale mixed with a baltic porter and a good handful of c-hops thrown in for good measure. But that just makes it an interesting and enjoyable drinking experience.  Has a creamy and medium mouthfeel while being slightly crisp.

It pours a very deep brown with a tight foamy head that persists well into the glass and smells like herbal hops, some molasses, and dark alcoholic fruits.  The taste packs a lot of different malts--brown sugar, roasted nuts, a dark bread (?)--with some chocolate/coffee and a bit of hops to round it off, with a lingering thought of smoky caramelized sugar.  The mouthfeel is maybe a bit oily but leavened by carbonation and the warm alcohol which seems to bring everything out more. I can see this pairing nicely with a lot of different foods--right now I really want a burger with caramelized onions.

A: Almost completely opaque, it's a dark, dark brown, almost like stained wood. Settled in my glass with a generous 2.5 inch head. Very frothy.  S: The hops, bitters, and caramelized malts float up from the head. It also smells slightly smoky.  T: Wow. I can taste the hops, bitters, caramelized malts, and roasted malts which gives it the smoky smell. The smoky taste is even better. It has a sweet side to it as well.

10099,1161,superdedooperboy,4.32,"Picked up a couple sixers of this brew at a local Kroger grocery store, marked down to an absolutely amazing $4.95 a piece. Less than five dollars for one of my favorite brews? How could I resist?  12 oz. brown bottle with Bottled On date of 06/18/2008 clearly visible. Poured into a pub glass.  A beautiful clear, deep mahogany beer supports a thick two fingers of mocha-colored foam. The head recedes somewhat quickly to a well-sustained cap that sticks around but fails to leave more than a few patches behind on the walls of the glass.  Aroma is a wonderful and inviting mix of earthy, citric hop notes and sweet, caramel-chocolate malt, with just a hint of nuttiness.  Body is nice and medium-full, with a welcome middling level of tingly carbonation. The initial greetings come from sweet, chocolatey and nutty malt flavors, with a full spectrum of bitter, grassy, fruity and citric hops rounding out the middle, with a rather dry and lingering semi-sweet, semi-bitter finish.  Amazingly drinkable for a beer of its caliber, with every sip calling for another, but by the time the whole bottle's gone, the 7.2% ABV begins to make itself known.  All-around, this one is extremely tough to pinpoint stylistically. A hopped-up brown? The nuttiness suggests it, but perhaps a cone-infused Doppelbock fits the bill. It's tough to say, but either way, this is one world-class brew, even if (or perhaps because) it defies worldly standards.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Keeps a mostly full lace and leaves some rings of stick on the sides.  Smells of sweet brown sugar, caramel and nuts, along with a bit of earth and some citrus hops. Has a bit of chocolate and coffee in it, as well, and the hops are mainly complementary to a very nice malty nose.  Taste has a bit more hop flavor than the smell and a bit less robustness from the malt. Hops are citrusy and play nicely on a still very nice malt base of caramel, chocolate, coffee and brown sugar. It has a slight nuttiness to it, as well, and overall has very nice flavor and balance. Some hop bitterness lingers in the finish along with some bitter coffee grind flavor.  Mouthfeel is on the plus side of a medium body. Carbonation is maybe a tad more aggressive than I'd like, although it's still pretty smooth with a nice creaminess.

This is fun beer to drink, taste and enjoy as it doesn't match any particular style. I am in wonder to where the hops were hid. For a 50 IBU beer I would expect the hops to be more prominent.

S - I had a difficult time smelling this one. I definitely get carrob and dark chocolate notes. Slight alcohol and more so when it warms. Relatively sweet in the nose but the dark malts keep it from becoming overly sweet.  T&M - My first impression is lightly burnt dark brown sugar and then chased with dark chocolate and rum-soaked prunes. A nice nutty flavor that kind of reminds me of a deep hazelnut. Malty and sweet and some spice from the alcohol. I enjoyed the flavors more and more as it warmed. Alcohol played a nice role all the way through.

10099,1161,IMincedTheKing,2.57,"Pours an opaque dark brown with cranberry-red at the edges and a short, tawny head.  The aroma is dark and sweet, maybe too sweet, like burnt sugar and dried fruits. Caramel malts dominate, with hops lurking in the background.  Sweetness galore! Syrupy and cloying, it tastes of toasted grains and burnt sugar. Though the label says ""well-hopped"", I don't find anything here to balance out the flavor. It kind of reminds me of eating a icing with a spoon--yeah, it's that sweet.  I'll probably keep trying, but Dogfish Head keeps letting me down.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Our taste is malted with a very smoked flavor. Some nutty toffee, maybe a roast flavor. The smoked flavor stays around with a medium lasting flavor.

The taste is complicated and has a slightly smokey aftertaste. A thoroughly pleasant beer to drink. Disturbingly high alcohol content for how easily the beer drinks.

10099,1161,Gosox8787,3.96,"Poured from the bottle into a glass with a minimal beige head. Appearance is dark brown with reddish hues when held up to the light. Aroma is primarily of roasted malts. The taste hits upfront with a sweet, malty flavor. The flavor from the caramelized brown sugar, as indicated on the bottle, does lend a new sweetness. Chocolate and coffee notes hit next. The flavor finishes with the Liberty and Goldings. I can see how this is noted as a combination of a brown ale, scotch ale, and an IPA. The flavor certainly melds together nicely. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation, although I'm not sure it's necessary. Drinkability is not that high as the flavor is heavy, although pleasant. The alcohol is not that noticable in the beer however.  Overall, this is an enjoyable brew, unlike any I have had before. The balance of the sweetness and bitterness is great. Definitely an interesting combination of styles. Worth trying.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Rich toasted malts with a hit of hop waft up from the brew. Deep toasted malt flavors flow through the entire drink from start to finish. The alcohol burn appears at the front end, but gets washed away. The flavor hangs around far after your last sip. The carbonation is lively in the mouth as you drink this full bodied beer. Goes down smooth and leaves the desire for more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Head was smooth about one finger and dissipated shortly leaving beautiful tan lacing.  S - Dark chocolate malt, reminiscent of stout. Alcohol was not prevalent in the initial nose but as it warmed up it was there.  T - Roasted chocolate malt molasses almost stout like, but with bitterness from the hops, the flavoring hops are there but their character cannot be discerned from the malt that this brew is dominated by.  M - Has a lot of body to it light on carbonation. Thick makes me want to drink slow and really enjoy the taste.  D - Thick and hearty, good to sip on, pretty heavy for an brown ale. But it fits the style, one that dogfish created and calls a cross between an IPA, Scotch Ale, and Brown Ale.

No lacing that I recall and the head falls quickly.  S: Smell is of brown sugar, hops, and caramel roasted malt. An unholy combination to be sure, but interesting and mildly pleasing to my nose.  T: The taste confirms everything I just smelled. It's way too bitter, way too roasty, and the brown sugar and caramel malt play second fiddle in the background. Extremely disappointing. I was really looking forward to this one too.  M: Nicely carbonated and feels good.  D: I drank 2 but only because I was at a party and it was the only beer I brought.

10099,1161,marvin213,4.17,"This beer, like all DFH productions, looks good. Even poured into a seashell-embossed (enjoying this one at the beach) Pilsner-type glass, this brew looks appealing like dark, rich chocolate. A 1/4"" head turns into a thin, patchy layer of bubbles with lacing apparent on the glass sides even before the first sip. Interestingly, the very bottom 1/4"" of this pour is a much lighter brown--almost like a caramel glaze (but on the bottom).  The aroma is sugary hops, and I like it! I can smell the hops with a tinge of alcohol, and the malty ""aromatic"" barley prompts me to expand my nostrils so as to engulf this waft of beer aroma. A very neat, unique, and enjoyable smell--something I've come to expect from the brewmasters at Dogfish Head.  The taste, quite simply, is good. Unlike other beers, I think I smell more than I taste. The barley definitely offers a malted milkball-like quality that is (obviously) very pleasant. I taste the caramelized sugar most in the aftertaste, after I've swallowed and I collect remnants of the sip from my teeth and inner cheeks. I'm not sure why, but this beer experience continually conjures up images of caramelized onions on a big, Waffle House-style flat grill/griddle. In line with this thinking, this liquid is fulfilling like an order of hash browns scattered, covered, and chunked--there's lots of interesting components to the serving that all assemble to form a simple yet tasteful delight. Looking for a potential negative, I think the barley may be a tad overwhelming. The hops provide a nice balance, though I must say I can't distinguish Liberty from Goldings. The caramelized sugar really contributes to a nice effect on the palate.  The mouthfeel is really good. The hop combo offers a bit of that enamel-pulling characteristic while the barley contributes some of that aforementioned milkball yumminess. I think it's the sugar that really makes the feel better than good--it's why, after each sip, I suck my teeth like a teenager given a directive he/she doesn't like. For me and this beer, however, there's no dissension.  The drinkability is good--yet another mass-produced but still unique beverage from DFH Brewery. It's beers like this--hardly mentioned even in discussions specifically about DFH, that solidify in my mind that this brewery really is on top of this game. Though I won't follow this one with another of it's kind, I'd like to keep this one around so as to always be able to enjoy it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,JBogan,3.83,"Nice looking dark brown with ruby tint. Tall pour delievered a one finger tan head which soon turned into a thin film and left a good amount of lacing.  The aroma was of coffee and chocolate, although I also picked up what smelled like laundry detergent.  Tasted along the same lines, but without the detergent. Not especially complex but pleasant nonetheless. I liked the fact that it wasn't over the top with the coffee. No sign of alcohol.  Mouthfeel was medium and smooth.  This is a pretty drinkable brew. Nicely balanced and one I'll probably revisit again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Very clean and smooth and then along comes a strong coffee flavor. No noticeable alcohol flavor. Nice hoppy bitter finish.  M- Medium body. Rather smooth with a dry more resiny finish. Moderate carbonation. Slight alcohol warmth.  D- Wonderful brown ale. Almost a mixture of an IPA and a brown ale, but not overly hopped. With a smooth malty coffee taste of a brown ale.

S - Big malts up front bring forth a caramel, with notes reminding me of waking up to coffee brewing a few rooms away. I'm bummed I read the description at the top of the page because all I'm smelling is a scotch ale now. Good smelling brew tho.  T - It's a big brown at 7.2%, and it's not the cleanest 7.2% I've ever ran into.... However, the bitterness is nice and not very expected with the style. Bold malts and a nice hop-profile make this a stand out, but it could be toned down a bit to lend towards drinkability.  M - Fizzy at first but once it mellows it rounds itself out a little more. Good body, but the carbonation... not so much.  D - ABV hinders an otherwise pretty drinkable beer. If this were a little more subdued I'd be all over it. I like the hop profile a lot but there are a few browns I'd pick over this.  Notes: I don't know what I should review this as. It's hardly a brown.

Head retention was excellent and left good lacing. This brew is a clear ruby red/brown color.  Smell - Smells of caramelized malts with a hint of cocoa. There is also a slight odor of alcoholic esters...smells slightly boozy.  Taste - There is some complexity here. Definitely a bitter hoppy finish. Starts malty with a bitter chocolate background. I'm also getting the nuttiness of the brown. All of the flavors frolic together in a brown meadow of deliciousness. Complex and tasty!  Mouthfeel and drinkability - Smooth as velvet. Creamy with a medium body. Carbonation is light in this one. Overall this is one tasty little brew. The ABV is a little high for what I would consider a session brew.

In fact, I thought I was having a Porter. Which it would be a nice porter, but it's a fantastic brown.

The Indian Brown Ale pours smooth, with a dark brown that shines a deep ruby red in the sun. A slight head with little lacing shown a nice tan.  The smell was the highlight of the drink. A sweet, malty caramel that was reminiscent of a chocolate stout; little hop was noted.  The Ale tasted much like the smell, sweet like candy, that permeates the mouth and wakes up all the senses. I didn't note any significant note of hops, though a bit of bitterness is present in the aftertaste.

T - Heavy maltiness with a bittersweet chocolate. Instantly the Brown Ale flows across the palate and is quickly followed by the taste of the Scotch Ale and a bitter finish from the IPA.  M - Crisp, bitter, and dry sums up the mouthfeel of this beer. Its a little on the harsh side.  D - Because of its experimental nature and flavors, its drinkability is affected.

Toasty goodness of coffee, vanilla, and barley. The malted barely character is extremely pronounced and exceptional. It is the star of this one. Nice bitterness on the finish contrasts with the malt sweetness.  This beer is somewhat well cabonated but has a silky milk feel quality to it that is pretty unusual but nice. It would be wrong to do other than sip this one, it is one where you could spend a long time enjoying it.  I love barley and this brew puts it out there in a strong and complex way.

I don't know if this beer was stale or what, but I found it just didn't have any ""pop"" as far as flavor...considering the reviews. Not bad, but not particularly noteworthy for me. Didn't really increase flavors as it warmed up either.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,DoubleJ,4.51,"12 ounce bottle with a pork chop and Santa Fe rice dinner, on to the beer:  Leather brown color in the glass, it has a persistent head and a wonderday display of lacing clinging to the glass. Mild aroma, mostly toffee, and some Goldings hops. The taste is a superb blend of Brown Ale and IPA. First it's the brown, then it's the IPA. Neither one gets too cloying. Starts sweet, with toffee and burned sugar. The hops begin to kick in with a squirt of orange flavor. Strangely, this feels lighter than the listed ABV, and it goes down the hatch without a hinch.  I'm not normally overly fond of hoppy browns, but DFH Indian Brown has the balance down on this one. One bottle with dinner was not enough for me, and I currently feel stupid for not buying more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Three fingers of light brown foam rest on top. Retention is very good. Lacing is minimal.  Big, deep, nose of toasted malts. Hints of dark chocolate and lightly roasted coffee notes (???). Nice smokey presence.  Okay, that's not like any brown ale that I've ever had before. Otherwise, I'd be a much bigger fan of them. This much darker and more flavorful than I expected. Big toasted malts come shining through. Nice level of coffee flavor. Bittersweet chocolate notes. Slight traces of vanilla and caramel. Great presence of smokiness. Good hops spiciness provides a nice kick. A nicely, and surprisingly, complex brew.  On the higher end of medium thickness. The carbonation is just slightly too sharp, IMO. Otherwise, it's fairly creamy and smooth. Enjoyable.  Yes, I could drink this one on a regular basis. Totally enjoyable, tastewise. I can't even find the alcohol in this one.

Appearance: Tan head approximately ¼"" goes quickly leaving behind hardly any lacing. Rim of foam and some islands of foam around edges of liquid. Clear but very dark brown. Sipping leaves speckled lacing on the side of the glass.  Smell: Molasses and dark chocolate with hops spicing up the aroma.  Taste: The flavor is complex with dark bittersweet chocolate malt and strong undertone of hops.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with light carbonation and a long finish that starts out with malt turning to bitterness and then ending with mild bittersweet malt that just disappears.

A: The ale is a dark maroon color, so deep red that appears black from afar. Let's call it a black cherry color.  S: The nose is malty, thick with a smoky undertone that drips with peat. Caramel malts add further heft to the body.  T: A smoky brown hop bomb, all rolled into one. Darker malts, toasted with chocolate, coffee and caramel, lead the way. They are followed almost immediately with a palpable smoky flavor. The result is thick and almost as full as an honest-to-goodness wee heavy. A citrusy hop flavor manages to peak through the malts and smoke but just barely. A very enjoyable drink.  M: The mouthfeel is full, smoky and thick, but not so heavy that it is burdensome. I was edxpecting a run of the mill brown ale but, knowing DFH, I should have known otherwise.  D: I'd disappointed that I never tapped into this one before.

Cream colored head with great retention and good lacing.  S - Sweet chocolate, almond, quite assertive. Sweetness balanced by raosted malts. Hops are present, but don't overwhelm the malt. Great balance.  T - Smooth nutty and custard like entry, with building chocolate sweetness. Hops add some grassy flavors and a slight tang. The finish shows the hops building to a grapefruit bitterness that somehow blends with the semi-bitter chocolate malts very well. The finish is quite clean considering, and left me wanting to drink deeply.  M - Good body for style, not fantastic, but good. Soft and fluffy mouthfeel.  D - Great little twist on a classic style.

Very well balanced.  Mouthfeel and drinkability is where this beer excels. The alcohol is not noticeable at all. It feels like drinking their 5% chicory stout. Very easy to down a few very quickly.

A quarter inch tan/mocha head was seen leaving before it got to say hi. A ring around the glass and a skim of foam are at the surface.  S- IBA has aromas of roasted malts, standard chocolate, slight coffee and hops(goldings) in the background. A bit of caramel from the malts and some nuttiness. Very impressive for a brown.  T- Almost drinks like a porter/stout but has the brown ale qualities with the dogfish twist. Some burnt sugar and roasted malt & caramel sweetness. The chocolate is faint and not overly sweet. The hops hold this one together with a twinge of bitterness. Maybe some dark fruit in the way back.  M- Rich smooth and medium to full bodied % one of the finest browns to grace my mouth. Just a touch of alcohol on the tounge with nice carbonation. A very lively brown ale.  D- Not sessionable, but i would go for a few as the taste is impressive.

Taste starts off with a dry, roasty bready note, hints of molasses and even cola sweetness, with dark fruit and molasses coming out more around mid-palate, hints of cocoa. Roasty coffee note starts to take over right before the finish, with just a hint of floral hops, and the finish is very dry and lingers fairly lightly on the palate.

10099,1161,Bootscraper,4.56,"Served at about 50 degrees F in pint Glass listening to Urfaust- ""Drei Rituale Jeseits"" This beer is pretty much opaque, and a shade of very very deep brownish red. The red highlights that radiated at certain angles was a deep shade that of cranberry juice. The head was light tan and very uniform, but only got as big as about 1 cm, and slowly started disappearing to nothing. There was, however, very even lacing that fell like snow. I am in the throes of a head cold as I review this beer, so my sense of smell may be inaccurate. The mild scents that did get through though were very full, and smelled of earthy caramel malt, and just a nod of browning butter. The taste is dominated by tangy hops, charred bitter and leaning towards a dark coffee flavor (In bigger gulps, this aspect gained slight momentum in the middle, towards the finish). This is balanced by rich sweet brown sugar, which is in it's prime form initially on the lips for a fraction of a second, and then left solo at the cap of the finish, along with a little smoke flavor, for an after-taste. I'm also under the impression that different components of the above-mentioned sip were both accentuated and dampened as the beer warmed. Quite complex, but with seemless transitions. In the mouth this beer was silky smooth, which I should probably now come to expect from any Dogfish beer. It was also medium-bodied, and subtly sticky.

It's a Brown ale, but it seems to have such a vast profile that it tastes similar to some porters and some scotch ales I've had. Plus a great boost of full hoppy-ness like an IPA. Almost hard to place the style. A great quote on their site ""It can't be a brown ale, there is too much going on. All this, dark fruit, caramelized brown sugar... Maybe this is a triple brown? It's so delicious, you just have to drink it and forget about style."" Agreed...  A - nice mohogany red/brown. Dark. Foamy light tan head.  S - Toasty, roasty and Rich! Slightly sweet. The faintest hint of hop aroma. Oak. Chocolate.  T - Very very full toasty and roasty, but not bitter as some toasty-ness can be. Probably more roasty than toasty. A little bit of hop , both bittering and flavor. Treacle like tartness in the sweet. Finish of chocolate and wheat sourdough bread. Surprisingly smooth for how much is going on. Coating and delicious.  M - nice and coating. The flavor lasts and is enjoyable. Slight dryness.  D - Great, it's very flavorful but not excessive in any way.

10099,1161,farrago,3.46,"Very dark brown in color but not black, an orange tinge at the rims underscores the clarity of the liquid, average to thin depth of head yet leaves a full, attractive lacing behind. Brown sugar, toffee, black raisin, plum, licorice, chocolate in the nose, obviously more malts than hops, fat enough to settle in fully and stay until closing time. Full-bodied, all roasty and toasty with sweet malt segueing into dark chocolate powder, coffee, brown sugar. Offers golden and black raisins, figs and dates more than any fresh fruit flavors, however, not saccharine. Carbonation and hops ride in just in time to lead into a cleaner finish than expected. Arguably trying to do too much, still, tasty enough.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,MrHurmateeowish,4.3,"12oz bottle purchased at the local Hannaford. Pours a translucent dark brown body with a thin film of light tan head. Aroma consists equally of caramel and chocolate malts and citrussy hops. Tastes like chocolate and caramel, with a good portion of citrussy hops to balance it out better than many browns. No alcohol flavor, but a hint of viscosity and warming, along with moderate carbonation. Somewhat of a sipper, though goes down easier than some beers with this abv and flavor... Wow, this is a lot better than I remember it being. A new favorite American brown!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,BBThunderbolt,4.3,"Poured into bubble pint glass. Poured with almost no head. What head there was had very good retention. Below average lacing for a brew this type. A rich, deep mahogany that allows just a little light to poke through. A very sweet aroma greets you immediately. Not just the usual malt sweetness that would be expected, but a sugary blast that caught me off-guard. The flavor was not as sweet as the aroma led me to expect. Very nice roasty flavors, although the slight coffee flavor put me off a little. The flavors stick to the tongue but fade before becoming annoying, thus letting you be ready for the next sip. The body is a little thin, a fuller, more well-rounded mouthfeel would be welcome. Very drinkable, although a bit much for a session. A very nice take on the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Riccymon,3.94,"Poured a deep, lifeless brown from the bottle with just barely enough coffee-colored head to cover the surface of the beer. I found the smell to be this brew's low point--the slightly malty, nutty brown ale aromas accompanied by a strange mustiness. The taste and mouthfeel, however, especially as the beer warmed, was everything I've been seeking in a brown ale. Again, the typical brown ale flavors of malt and nuttiness were up-front, while a solid hoppiness came through alongside a little brown sugar in the back-end to create a delicious balance. Immediately following was this beer's other high point, its silky-smooth mouthfeel. At last, a brown ale that doesn't finish disappointingly thin. Given the balance and great mouthfeel, drinkability was quite good. Overall, this is a tremendous take on the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,TheDoorman,3.6,"Deep brown with a big dose of carbonation creating a large tan head. Aroma of caramel, cofee, brown sugar and a hint of hops. Rich candy sugar and molases dominate the palate. Creamy mouthfeel. This is probably an excellent example of a style of which I am just not a big fan. Very rich, sweet and filling. No amount of hops can make it through the sugary body. This could probably be matched very with with certain specific foods, but this isn't a beer I would consider drinking with much frequency.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,dolemite77,4.23,"This is always a hit with me... complex, yet drinkable, dark, yet light enough to have a couple of them. Pours a rich brown, with a thin, cappuccino-like head that lingers and laces throughout. Aroma is sweet and fruity, with a hint of coffee. I taste a lot of coffee in this, and blind tasted it might be guessed to contain a bit of coffee. Burnt sugar and lightly roasted malt. Interesting for a brown ale, because it is not overly roasted, and the added sugars for the higher alcohol stand out a bit more. The hops here are more character hops, rather than up front type.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

I get lots of coffee out of this, very malty sweet beer but surprisingly hopped. Bitterness comes from both roasted malts and hops.

10099,1161,ncstateplaya,4.02,"Appearance: A great looking dark brown with garnet like fringes. The head poured about a finger thick and had a soothing tannish color. Its too dark to fully see through at the widest portion of the glass. Lacing was subtle, and a little disappointing after seeing the head.  Smell: The nose of this ale is pretty complex, full of dark brown sugars and a nutty aroma accentuate the malts. There are plenty of hops to be smelled and somewhat spicy.  Taste: The bitterness from the hops blend very well with the malts. A semisweet almost caramel taste initially follows the swallow. As the beer warms, a creamy nuttiness develops.  Mouthfeel: The body of this beer is thin and crispy. The carbonation has been contained very well - can take several swallows without blowing up like a balloon (+1 drinkability). The hops can defintely be felt in the cheeks.  Drinkability: Drinks much easier than the 7.2% would suggest. The tiniest bite from the hops totally adds to the character of this brew. This is one of my favored brown ales, its not as sweet as some of the others I have tried.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Aroma has a nice mixture of hoppiness and some brown sugar mixed with some sweet toasty malts. Flavor is very lovely mix of coffee and bitter hops. Coffee is the most prominent flavor, light chocolate in the middle, and a nice bitter hoppiness at the finish. Very nicely balanced, medium bodied, average carbonation. I really enjoyed this beer.

Good level of hops to match the maltiness. Its very appealing.  The caramel malt & hops are combined so well in this brew. The flavor is strong but in a very good way. The alcohol is there but its very acceptable. Delicious.  It has a good body to go along with the flavors. Carbonation is right on.  I really like this beer.

I always loved the flavor of brown ales but found them a little boring and too little CO2 action going on. DFH fixes that by hopping it up and making it more carbonated making for a delicious beer.

Aroma is hoppy and roasty with more hops than any other brown ale I can remember.  Flavor is well balanced with lots of hops to counter the abundant dark malts. The hops are earthy, the malts are roasty, and the whole thing works (unsurprisingly) well.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, well-carbonated, and smooth. Sweet upon first sip but finishing dry.  Nicely done and it makes me think it's surprising more breweries don't do similar styles. It has the feel of a hybid between two popular styles: IPA and imperial stout.

S: Burnt caramel malt and brown sugar is prevalent, with herbal and earthy hops in the background. Some molasses, oak, and alcohol also detectable.  T: A smooth burnt caramel sweetness is dominant, with a nice kiss of earthy hops to go with the roasted flavors. Again, some woody/oaken notes and perhaps some bittersweet chocolate. Alcohol as well.  M: This is incredibly velvety smooth - wonderful. Medium to slightly heavy body for the style. Carbonation is somewhat muted. Finish is a bit dry and sticks awhile.

A great looking beer overall.  S: Heavy doses of caramelized sugars and burnt oak great the nose. There is a slight citrus aroma in the background.  T; Starts out with a burnt sugar sweetness that's followed by a pleasant earthy and burnt bitterness. Finishes a bit tart and dry.  M: Medium body is a little slick and has the right amount of fizz.  D: I wasn't that impressed with this right out of the gate. But it grew on me as I drank it. The end result for me was an very nice experience.

The longer I have the beer, the more roasty smells come out. Alcohol smell increases as it warms. I picked up caramel hints near the end of the beer.  T: Coffee and chocolate malts up front. The hops hit as I swallow. It seems to sweeten the more I drink it. Alcohol taste gradually increases.  M: A little chewy with some hop bitterness. Carbonation coats the tongue to keep each of the different flavors around. Very nice.  D: Pretty heavy and robust.

The chocolate is dominant with bittersweet mollasses undertones. Alcohol scent is present throughout.  T: Sweet chocolate favor along with sweet malts start this beer off. Finishes with a bitterness that is a result of a combonation of the coffee notes and the hops. Can easily detect alcohol.  M: Nice amount of carbonation which does not stand out and hide the complex favors. Coats the tongue. Alcohol hits you in the back of the throat, but is not overpowering.  D: Not a beer for everyone.

Lots of roasty aromas, with some chocolate and coffee coming out of it, as well as a decent dose of leafy hops. Lots of really nice dark roasted flavour, with some bitter chocolate, strong coffee and smoky malts. Great bitter leafy hops come through in spades, making this the most hopped brown ale I've come across. All of this culminates in a nice warm finish, which packs a wonderful reminder of the great flavours you've experienced.

The most obvious distinction between this beer on tap and this beer in bottle was its color and substance. The maltiness, richness, and complexity of the beer vastly out-does the carbonated, bottled version.  The hoppiness and fruitiness was drowned out by a rye, raisiny beer with a fantastic brown color and a rich, malty taste.  Clearly best on tap, this beer is almost incomparable in any other respect.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Tons of lacing sticks to the side of the glass after each sip. S- The first thing I thought when I smelled this was that the smell reminds me of red wine. I'm not sure where this came from, and after a few more smells that idea left my head. I get lots of roasted malts, coffee and chocolate, and a light hoppy bitterness. Smells boozier than 7.2% abv. T- Tastes very much like it smells. Roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. There is a really nice bitterness from the hops at the end that lingers as an aftertaste. Not too sweet either. Like in the aroma, I'm surprised the alcohol content is only 7.2%, I would think it was up closer to 9% probably if I didn't know before hand. M- Medium/full bodied with a good amount of carbonation. While the alcohol was noticeable in the taste, I don't get much alcohol warmth in the mouthfeel. D- Pretty good considering how big the flavors are, and it won't put you under the table to quickly.  Another interesting beer from DFH, definitely worth a try. They blur the lines between styles in a good way again with this one.

Slight roasted malt flavors up front that mellow out as the beer warms, and I can taste just a tiny bit of citrus flavors at the end of the beer.  Mouthfeel is good.

Mouthfeel: substantial, good tingle, a little alcohol lingers in the palate-which is fine in my book.  Drinkability: Do you like robust and delicous brown ales that are full flavored? If you do this is a beer for you. This is one of my all time favorites in the brown ale category and overall. I really think this is the unsung hero of the Dogfish line.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,mnj21655,4.3,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Bottled on:10/07/08 - doesn't get too much fresher than that!  Pours a very dark mahogany, darn near black, in color with ruby hints at the edges and maybe a finger of khaki colored head. When held to the light this beer is quite clear and a dark reddish-brown. Looks great but too dark for the style. Aroma is quiet nice, malty and sweet. At first it seems to be fairly roasty but this soon gives way to more chocolate and caramel aromas with a touch of fruityness and maybe just a hint of hops. Taste is very good, I again find some roasted notes that seem out of place in a brown ale. More chocolate and caramel as well as a bit of toast. Medium+ hop bitterness and a pleasant hop flavor, not American hops as one would expect here but more of a noble-esque hop flavor (the bottle states that Liberty and Goldings hops are an ingredient and if I recall correctly Liberty is a US grown Hallertau derivative). Mouthfeel is pretty good, medium+ body with moderate+ carbonation and a relatively dry finish with some mere indications at the respectable 7.2% ABV. Drinkability is excellent. This beer seemed to be more of a porter at times but was immensely enjoyable. If I rated strictly to style it wouldn't have fared quite as well but given DFH's penchant for innovation I drank this with an open mind. The ABV is too high to be a session beer but I think this makes a pretty good everyday drinker.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,twiggamortis420,4.5,"Very dark brown in color, nearly black. Has a fine bubbled tan head that has great retention.  What a great smelling brown ale! Nearly stout like. Heavy chocolate malts and roasty earth tones. Fresh and crisp hops are detectable, but ride along in the backseat.  Roasty, toasty bitter grainy flavor. Sweet chocolate then takes over in mid-palate. Finishes off with a nice, dry hop shot. Well balanced and perfectly carbonated.  This is a full flavored, full bodied, great tasting beer. Takes the brown ale to a new level. Easy and quite fun to drink. This is pretty close to BR Tribute Brown as my favorite brown ales of all time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,jcwenzel1,4.87,"This beer blew me away from the first site of it. The name Indian Brown Ale lead me to believe I was going to enjoy a solid original Brown Ale, yet I should have known different coming from Dogfish Head. This brew pours beautifully with a decent, reasonably long lasting, thick, cream coloured, head. The head lingers slightly along the sides giving a minor cascading effect. The initial colour is deep, deep, brown then as more is added it becomes an almost black colour.  The aroma is tantalizing... roasted malts with a large hint of chocolate, and small hints of coffee. (I felt like I had walked into a coffee/chocolate shop in France.) The aroma is not sweet however. It is more thick and robust.  The taste is exceptional. This is by far my favorite Dogfish Head Brew. Grabbing the font tastebuds with a burst of rustic nuts, then hitting the back of my mouth with lingering malt, slight alcohol taste. The taste is exceptional for a beer with a decent kick to it. Never would have guessed the alcohol level of this one.  It is thick and packs a bit of a punch which takes away a little from it's drinkability, but for me I could easily find room for one more! This is a must have!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Great, very malty backbone. Coffee, burnt sugar, malt and finishes with the Goldings hop taste. Nothing short of impressive.  M: Perfect carbonation, never had a problem with DFH.

10099,1161,Domingo,4.32,"This is pretty much a go-to beer for me that I have in my fridge almost all of the time. Pours a very dark brown that reminds me more of a stout than a brown ale. It has a little bit of head with a normal pour and a bit more with an aggressive one, but it does manage to lace your glassware more than you might expect. The main flavors are of milk and dark chocolate, roasted nuts and coffee beans, molasses, caramel, and a sharp (but pleasant) floral bitterness in the finish due to the hops. This stuff doesn't drink like something over 7% abv. It feels stronger and more potent than a typical brown ale, but there's no real booziness to it at all. This reminds me of a few regional craft ales that don't seem to have a category, but they're kind of like strong brown ales. There aren't many bottled, but this one carries that torch with no problem. It might be my favorite of the genre anyway. This makes a great pairing with hearty foods or even desserts.

Leaves nice lacing on the side of the glass.  Aroma is brown sugary sweet up front with some light spicy tones and a bit of molasses.  Taste begins with some sweetness and a bit of dark fruit, raisins seem to stick out. It finishes with some spicy hop flavors and a very slight residual sweetness.  Mouthfeel is medium, easy drinking for the relatively high ABV.  Well at this age it is still pretty damn good. Wish I had a fresh one to compare but I haven't seen it around in ages.

It was hard to get a reading on the color of the head, as it disappeared pretty darn quick, leaving behind a faint ring that displayed a bit of lacing.  You know those Mary Jane chewy candies? I guess I'd describe the aroma of this as a darker, more roasted version of what you smell from those candies (which are, supposedly, made of peanuts and molasses). Jeez, I haven't had those in a long time. The aroma is also perked up by alcohol and hops.  Tastes of roasted nuts and grains, with come chocolate entering. Dark chocolate is left on the palate, with the bitterness of it contributed by some crisp hops. Not sweet (and I mean that as a positive), this is a good and complex brown ale.

The lacing is decent but the real appeal to me is the head that settles from 2.5 fingers down to .5 and lasts the entire length of your experience with this ale.  Smells of roasted malts and bitter hops. The smell definately helps to create anticipation for the flavors to come, it represents them well.  Tastes of caramelized sugars and roasted malts at first and then finishes with an enjoyable strong hoppy flavor.  This is a very thick and powerful beer and yet it still is smooth on the palate.  Despite the high alcohol percentage, one hardly notices such characteristics in this beer. Not a session beer, but one to be enjoyed and savored.  Overall, this is a very flavorful beer that I highly recommend to anyone. Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale is my idea of a quality brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,daliandragon,4.13,Exceptional off the pour: copper brown color and impressive off white head with visible lace remnants once bubbles retreat. Sweet caramel malt is held in check by medium hopping and a pleasant sour note. As it warms acquires a definite roasted coffee bean flavor. Nice.  This is definitely my favorite Dogfish Head beer. This beer features a solid balance of roasted malt and full flavored hops with serious coffee and dark fruit tones. This went down smooth and surprisingly refreshing.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,kuykendall,4.25,"A= Dark almost black with a creamy head  S= A heavy sweet malt tastiness right up front with a slight current of hops behind it.  T= It rolls over the tongue igniting different tastes there is a slight alcohol after taste but it only comes after barley and sugar have waltzed through.  M= Chewy, almost nugety (is that an authorized beer word?)  D= this is my first time with this particular beer, but it reminds me why I picked brown ale for my first home brewing recipe. It's like looking at an old photo album with you grandparents when all the photos have turned with sepia. Every page is some exciting story you didn't know existed until you heard them. This brown ale is a return to a simpler time, but finding that something you thought you knew complete had a whole nother side you could have even contemplated.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,ommegoose,4.08,"Bottled 4/24/08.  Pours a dark brown color that lets little light though. Cherry wood color when held to the light. A quarter inch of frothy tan head stays after the pour, and most of the way down the glass. Leaves medium spiderweb lacing. The rare beer where the head outlasts the liquid beverage at the end.  Dark caramel and spicy hop aroma. Brown sugar. A lot richer than what the style usually offers.  I can sum this beer up in two words: brown sugar. There's more going on than that, but it's the dominant characteristic. In addition to the caramelized brown sugar, the sweetness is almost root beer-like. Hoppy, but not bitter. Liberty and Golding hops give a spicy back end and a very mild bitterness. They lend a strong presence but are not overpowering. Perhaps they are a bit more bitter when this beer is fresh, but at around three months they take a definite backseat to the malt. I get a little cocoa powder and smoke. Any nuttiness is subdued at most. Finishes with a touch of molasses and earthy, spicy hops. The big flavor is the only thing that suggests 7.2% abv.  In typical DFH fashion, mouthfeel is creamy and full. This is lightly carbonated.  This is a great brown ale, one that I will probably revisit. Quite different from the nut brown ale style, and far more interesting than those typically. The hefty malt is needed to keep the hops from getting out of hand. This is hardly sessionable; I would top out at two. The alcohol plays a role in this, but I felt it more than tasted it. The brown sugar starts to get cloying after a while too. Still, an impressive beer worth trying at least once, and probably more. A very strong effort by DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

This was my last bottle from a 6-pack that I had for a while because, well, this isn't my cup of tea due to the high level of hop bite.  That said, it made a great caboose on this malt train I was on, and by the time I got to this one the impact from the prior beers made the hops more palatable.  In fact, it worked well for me in this scenario and I played it right by doing this one last.  Still not my cup of tea, but I can readily see how this beer can be the hop head's Brown Ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Also hints of chocolate and coffee. Alcohol smell is surprisngly strong given the relatively low ABV.  T - Tastes somewhere between stout and porter. Strong nutty chocolate taste with light hints of alcohol. Hops provide a nice spicy and earthy backing but the roasted malts are the star of this beer.

Slight earthy hop aroma. Some pleasant smokiness as well.  Roasted malt and burnt brown sugar/molasses flavors up front. Definite nutty flavor. Hops do more to compliment the other flavors then stand out. Slight chocolately flavor, after taste is however sticking to the malt and burnt sugar.  Definite full mouth feel but incredibly smooth almost creamy.  Super drinkable and super enjoyable. Dangerously so.  The taste is very close to a scotch ale while still staying near the brown ale label.

The flavor is very nice, with a bit of smokiness on the palate and a rather bold finish, but without being too heavy. It drinks a bit like a Scottish brown ale. The nose is a bit weak, but has a subtle maltiness. But sitting in the sunlight, the color is a bit dull, it is too dark to show off its effervescent carbonation, and there is practically no head.

After a couple tastes I kept thinking of burnt sugar. It wasn't a turnoff but I didn't really enjoy the flavor. It has good texture. It is on the heavy side, but if I enjoyed the flavor I could see drinking a six pack with no problem.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,timbro81,4.07,"Pours a dark blackish brown with hues of amber on the edges. Standard 1/4 off white head that settles to a fine layer within a minute. Smells of rich malty carmelly hoppy goodness, that's the easiest way for me to put it. Nice roasted caramel malts greet the tongue. Upon swallowing the taste transitions to an earthy, piney hoppiness. Medium to light bodied with a silky mouth feel. The ""burntness"" of the grains mingles well with the tingling of the hops. A very well structured beer. I approve.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,FtownThrowDown,3.98,"Pours a dark brown in color with ruby highlights around the edges. No head on the pour, only a slight froth around the perimeter of the glass. Smell is dark, roasted malts and a hint of piney hops. Wow, there is a lot more coffee in this brown than I was ever expecting. Caught me off guard. This is a very good brown ale. Full and roasty on the mouthfeel. There's just a bit of a harsh roasted coffee aftertaste.

10099,1161,mynie,4.22,"Odd that I never ran across this brew until just the other day. Eagle River Liquors in Fulton, Illinois (the best beer store in the area) had some sixers at a very reasonable price.  Pours very, very dark for a brown. Darker than most American stouts, actually. Opaque when sitting in the glass but ruby translucent near the bottom when you hold it up to light. Maybe it'd be brown in daylight. Who knows. Anyhow I don't typically judge a pour on the color so we can thankfully avoid any controversy over whether or not this looks appropriate for a brown. There's not much of a head, though, and it's kind of sitting in my glass like soup.  Smells like a regular old brown ale with just a bit more hops than I'm used to. The malt is biscuity and nutty and very strong, and then you got a little burst of west coast hops along with everything. Solid, but not the kind of mad rush I was hoping for.  Tastes better than it smells. Actually, now that I've sipped it I don't know what I was really expecting from the aroma. The hops can't be overwhelming, here, unless they were to drown out the brownaleiness of the malt. Anyhow, the brownaleiness is a lot stronger than you get in your average brown. It's like a goddamn hazelnut explosion. And that smooth intensity is backed up very well by a nearly perfect blend of hops. Nice nice nice.  Browns are usually one of my least favorite styles. Usually the problem is that the malt profile is off, for one, and then it's also usually not balanced in the least. Well, Dogfish have gone and made a strong, supremely drinkable brown that's almost perfectly balanced. Kudos.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Reagan1984,4.27,"I had this beer on tap at the Falls Church, VA Ale house.  The beer came with a fairly thin off white head that did dissipate over time. The beer was dark brown/amber in color with some reddish qualities. Also fairly clear, yet dark.  Aroma was wonderful and had lots of components. Chocolate, Brown Sugar, roasted malt, brown bread.  The flavor followed suit and was very nice. Nice balance and wonderful roasted malt flavor combines with chocolate, brown sugar and deep sweet flavors.  Mouth feel is medium bodied and very smooth, velvety. The beer has a very smooth finish.  I enjoy this beer and its drinkability.

Color is a dark brown with a redish glow and hardly any transparency, only when held to light do I get that glow.  Big coffee smell with some mild chocolate oder. This smells like a roasty Belgian. Decent roasted caramel aroma too with a charred tone.  Taste is a burnt toast, caremal, with a toasted nuttiness and some earthy hop quality at the swallow. Dry hop linger with more charred woody tones. Its almost a porter in its smokey overtones and charred caramel like character.  Watery mouthfeel with a bit of overcarbonation. Drinkable, but not what I was expecting. Very much overly malty with more coffee flavor and aroma then I wanted.

S: a light roasted character, chocolate and a noticeable strong hop bitterness.  T: For flavor there was a burnt molasses and caramelize sugars that was soon offset by a strong hop bitterness tying things together. Some dry chocolate, breadiness and a light vanilla bean is detected as well before finishing with a moderate dry hop bitterness. Was at times a tad to bitter which distracted from the ""brown"" nature of the beer.  M: a nice fullness, creamy, with a noticeable carbonation presence and dry nuttienss and malting.  D: A good attempt but really didn't care to much for this on a personal level. A moderately good drink none the less but combining the two only diminished and muddled a potentially good brown.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Not as dark or thick as a stout, but with many similarities. Taste is robust with loads of caramelized brown sugar and smoke. Good solid hops backbone (they use Liberty and Goldings). Some floral accents, but no butteriness...mouthfeel is mostly oily, but not in a bad way. Just nicely coats the tongue.  This would be a nice one to have on hand for the full flavor of a stout, but in a little smoother, more drinkable brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,boralyl,4.37,"A - It pours 1 and 1/2 fingers of tan(almost brown) head. The beer itself is a very dark brown with ruby red highlights when held to the light. It is slightly opaque. The head sticks around for a little bit and leaves some decent lacing.  S - A very powerful smell. As soon as it's poured into the glass you can get a waft from several feet away. It has a very sweet, heavy malt aroma. I can make out brown sugar, caramel, coffee and some other roasted malts. I can't make out any hops whatsoever.  M - A medium-full bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation and a slight smooth feeling to it.  T - Up front come the sweet roasted malts and a smoked flavor in the middle. It finishes slightly sour and bitter with the hops. A very good combination of flavors.  This is a great beer. Dogfish Head continues to impress. It's on the heavy side and has a higher alcohol content which brings down it's drink-ability. It's pretty well rounded, looks great, smells amazing and the taste matches the aroma.

10099,1161,BrewerB,3.72,"Aroma includes prominent caramel sweetness, honey, toast, and some grapefruity hop. Good variety on the malt side but if you call this an ""Indian"" something, I should be noting more hop aroma. Great brown ale aromas, missing the hops for India-status.  Appearance is spot on - deep amber brown, clear, with a light tan head which holds up well.  Upfront caramelly sweetness with a toasty malt character. This maltiness lingers into the semi-dry finish. There's a presence of citrusy hop character and a small amount of lingering bitterness. Like aroma, I expect more of the ""India"" character in this beer. Otherwise, nicely balanced and great flavor.  Medium to medium-full bodied, slightly creamy. Moderate carbonation. Light warming sensation.  Very drinkable and well-balanced. Could be a little drier.

Head retention is great, as is size, color, and texture. You can't get any better than this. Dogfish Head does it again....  Nose: Strong, fills the room....no doubt about it, this has one strong aroma, can't deny its power. I'm not even near the open and poured beer and I can smell it. Very nice, what I like to see. When up to the nose Strong notes of chocolate and heavily roasted malts. Pretty black smelling. Burnt and smokey aromas present. No hop notes, they are completely overcome by the malt.  Tongue: Lots of the malt character that was in the aroma is present. Huge roasted/burnt flavor. After having a few beers today, alcohol is noticeable. However, the alcohol also is part of the balancing act of this brew. The beer is not balanced, it does, however, come in waves. First, a huge roasted malt( along with some dark fruit hints as well as chocolate) hits the palate. This is a great beer that incorporates both dark malt flavors and bitterness with hop bitterness an flavor. Quite unique...  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Medium on the palate...lower levels of carbonation. Definitely a drying sensation in the finsih. This is a beer that I wouldn't be able to drink more than three of in a single sitting. Great beer, however...well I guess I could easily relax and drink more than three of these in a sitting...that is considering that I'm not trying to get drunk and am enjoying them over a prolonged amount of time.

Light malts up front, then a slight rush of cocoa undertones finished by a perfect hop bite that leaves you thristy for more. In my opinion this beer tastes the way Newcastle should taste.

10099,1161,fishtownhxc,3.56,"i think this can be a rather confusing beer as dogfish is definitely trying to bring together the best of two worlds (that being an IPA and nut brown ale). by default you may be tempted to judge it against other brown ales because of the color and head when you pour it, but since that wasn't the brewery's intention that'd be a bit foolish. my instinct is that the beer itself is a bit too hoppy for for a brown ale, but for intents and purposes, they did a fine job of bringing that aspect of the IPA together well with complexity of the malts of a brown ale. the hops aren't overwhelming by any stretch, and you get a healthy dose of almost coffee like maltness in the aftertaste. a good beer, but definitely not one that i'd try drinking more than one or two in one sitting. probably would go really well with a huge chunk of chocolate cake too.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Smell is sweet and brown, with malty molasses taking center stage, and spicy herbal hops.  Taste is rich and roasty, dark malts, light malts, malts all around--engaged by fruity bitter hops, rounded with a whiff of caramelized brown sugar and an aftertaste of dark mocha.

10099,1161,JEdmund,4,"Appearance Nearly black it's such a dark brown; small, fairly hard to pour head, but it hangs around as a creamy top for a long time. Definitely the darkest brown ale I've had; looks more like a porter.  Smell Nothing slapping me in the face, but I'm picking up porter and stout qualities that's throwing me off a bit. I like what I'm smelling, and the familiar sweet brown ale scents start appearing around the toasted/roasted malt traits. In addition, I'm getting a good dose of those Liberty and Goldings hops.  Taste & Mouthfeel A full flavored--or imperial/indian--brown for sure. First few sips reveal sweet malt, a heavy amounts of toasted malt, maybe some roasted malts as well, and all topped off by generous portions of hops. Initially I wasn't sold on all those hops, as I want sweet malt to take center stage in a brown ale, but as the ale warms, more brown sugar becomes evident, ramping up the sweetness and balancing out all the bitterness. The body is on the low-medium but has a lovely, creamy texture.  Overall Indian Brown Ale grew on me as I drank more of it and as it warmed up. I kept thinking of it as just a brown ale, but as an IBA, then I think that denotes this beer will be considerably bigger and hoppier--not your trypical session brown--and it's certainly every bit of that. It's fairly robust, so I'd say drinkability is low; I wouldn't want more than two in an evening.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

A mix of hops with a drying sensation and caramel and other sweet malts, plus some sweetness derived from something like bubblegum or cotton candy.

10099,1161,Ben4881,4.3,"Indian Brown Ale Dogfish Head Craft Brewery  Appearance: Indian Brown Ale pours a clear dark chocolate brown with reddish hues. The foamy head is just slightly off white, almost cream. The head dissipates nice and slowly, leaving outstanding lacing.  Smell: It smells nutty and chocolaty with a roasted toasty malt aroma. Bread-like yeast notes creep in at the very end to add complexity.  Taste: This is a spicy one. The front end is very smooth, nutty, and toasty. Then the taste morphs into a coffee and alcohol concoction, similar to a Bailey's and coffee. The coffee taste persists and is accompanied by subtle hop flavored notes. The pairing of the coffee and hop bitterness is in perfect balance and dries out very nicely. Some of the alcohol flavor lingers, but dries out as well.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly, this beer is thicker than I expected, which is a nice surprise. Carbonation is minimal, leaving the body a little heavier.  Drinkability: 7.2% ABV is at the higher end of the scale for a brown ale. The bitter finish and heavier body give this brown ale complexities found in IPA's and stouts. Since it's not as bitter as most IPA's and not as thick as most stouts, this beer is certainly drinkable for me. This is another outstanding effort from the folks in Milton, DE.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,AChamberlain,4.16,"This beer is suppper drinkable. A smooth and luscious mouthfeel combined with good flavor make it an essential brown ale. I poured it from a 12oz bottle from Central Market. I took a big drag looking for an aroma. Not much. Hops, which I guess is expected from a hopped brown. The flavor is pretty dope. A bit of hop bite with a sweet malt finish. A tad roasted flavor, not as much as I would like in a brown. A must try for sure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,wiseguy142,4.25,"Picked up a 6-pack of this after being very impressed with it on tap. Reviewing as I'm drinking to see how it lives up.  Pours a rosy, deep brown with a thin film of tangy yellow head on top. Smells immediately of chocolate malt, oranges, even a sort of ""soy sauce"" character (don't ask me why, it's just what it smells like- appealing nonetheless). Head quickly dissipates within a minute of pouring.  Tastes a little stronger and more medicinal than I remember it. It has the alcohol and dark malt kick of a RIS, but subdued by its significantly lighter body. Is leaving a great lacing around the glass. The taste isn't quite as shockingly amazing as I remember it the first time- possibly because I'm serving it colder, but it's definitely near flawless. As it warms more earthy roasted malts come out to trump the alcohol. Hops are nicely present in the background to steer the beer away from the otherwise chocolate-malt dominated flavor. The bittering hops are fairly strong as well- they enhance the alcohol taste of the beer by being the only other slightly acidic flavor in the beer that balances the otherwise heartily ""brown"" taste of the beer. The finish has an addicting quality to it where you're simultaneously intrigued and slightly unnerved by its strength.  The mouthfeel seems appropriate for a British style beer with a Dogfish Head touch- low carbonation, with the rest of the beer predominately shaped by the specialty malts, and then Dogfish throws in the extra 3 or 4 % alcohol to make it interesting.  If anything, I regard this as slightly less drinkable just because I realize now that it's a fairly strong beer, both alcohol and flavor-wise. Either way, if I were to walk into a random bar and see this I'd be excited that they had it on tap.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Definately a nice full mouth-feel, a bit creamy, and a good carbonation level. The aftertaste is of burnt wood and not at all unpleasant.

This stuff poured into my large 23oz beer glass a dark muddy brown color with a modest light brown head. The carbonation was ok. It had dark amber or copper highlights around the edges of the glass when held up to the light.  It smelled of dark malts, coffee and a hint of molasses. Not a real good hop smell to it but that may be intentional.  I could taste a strong malt flavor and a hint of burnt coffee grounds. Some vanilla and raison. Kind of a musty hop taste. You could taste the nip of alcohol but not too strong.  It was a dirty heavy thick feel in my mouth with just enough carbonation to leave your mouth feeling clean.

Flavors: roasted caramel malts, brown sugar, coffee, toffee, cocoa powder. There is definitely hop presence throughout; and it blends magnificently. The beer finishes bittersweet from the hops and brown sugar. I have to keep reminding myself this beer has a 7% ABV.... the alcohol is masked completely by the flavor. Delicious.  M- I would say this is a full bodied beer. Very creamy, medium t low carbonation.  D- Goes down with the best of 'em.

S: Earthy smells, peat & wood chips combine with dark rich malts.  T: Coffee flavors are the foremost in the malt but there is also some nice chocolate and caramel undertones, and some nut flavors as well. Not sure what the bittering is coming from but it brings the brew just shy of balance, leaving way for some of the complex malt sweetness to come through. The finish relatively long and malty.

Aroma of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate and light caramel. Taste is quite roasty and pleasant. Moderate bittering is the only sense of hops I get from this, most of it is in the malt despite the label. Mouthfell is bubblier than expected from the pour.

Flavor is more bitter than any brown ale I have had before, but that's by design, of course. Some nut flavor, traces of raisin and sweet caramel malt are apparent, but oily pine hop flavor and accompanying moderate-to-heavy bitterness follow soon after. A touch of alcohol burn is present as well. Carbonation is present and balanced. Slight tingle on tongue at the end of each sip.  As beer warms, bitterness becomes less noticeable.

Caramel, molasses and mild mocha hang around in the finish and accompany a faint warmth. Nutty and sweet with a good balance of bitter roast and hops. Progressive, full flavored, and thoroughly American in style while still maintaining balance and that traditional English charm (i.e. - subtle roast characters and Golding Hops). Extremely tasty and well crafted; as to be expected from DFH.  More lively and bright than first expected with bright carbonation and a slight twang in the finish.

Also think it taste like sucking on a big toffee candy. Gives a nice sweet taste to the brew that comes on strong and big. There is also a light brazil nut and coffee roastiness that comes on later and is a nice contrast to the sweet. There is also a nice hop bite that comes on strong as well but everything is well balanced. The aftertaste is a light coffee roasted taste that I would expect more from a stout than an Indian Brown Ale.  MF - Has a medium syrupy body that gives this one a bit of ummph and heft to it. it goes well with the sweet caramel flavors and it even leaves a bit of a sticky feeling on the mouth. Very lightly carbonated as the main feeling is the sticky body and the after feeling is a nice warm alcohol tingling feeling sitting in the mouth. Actually wish it was just a bit thicker in the mouth.  D - overall this is a very good beer from DFH and restores my faith in them. After Raison D'etre and Golden Era, I didn't see what all the hoopla was about regarding this brewery but this beer changes that. This is one delicious beer that I would definitely pick up whenever I saw it and would have at any time. It has so much flavor and hides its alcohol so well that this would be one dangerous brew that could sneak up on you. Good job to DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,beerphilosopher,4.47,"Pours a very dark brown color with subtle red hues in the light. The head is tight, yet thin and presents itself a pale choclate color. A vigorous swirl of the large snifter brings the head to life for a brief moment and then it settles down again into a thin layer on the surface of the beer. The nose is rich and inviting, with dominant chocolate and roasted coffee notes intermingling with a slightly sweet caramel character. Aromatic and floral hop notes balance the richness of this beer making for a very complex array of aromas in the nose. The palate is also dominated by dark semi-sweet chocolate, espresso, and a very subdued dark caramel malt sweetness that balances the beer well against the bittering chocolate notes and the mildly acidic hop profile. I'm pleasantly surprised by a terrific ""butterscotch-like"" characteristic that makes this beer all the more interesting to me. The mouth feel is smooth, rich and never cloying. Adequate, but not aggressively carbonated, this beer is a study in the balance of sweet and dry flavors without leaning too heavily on either in my opinion. At 7.2% ABV, you might expect the alcohol to assert itself, but really never does except for the finish, which is pleasantly warm and smooth without being boozy. Otherwise the finish is quite dry with lingering notes of espresso in the mouth. A very, very complex brown ale in every regard. Once again, Dogfish Head had managed to take what I typically think of as a rather mundane beer style and kick it up several notches. This is not your father's brown ale. Incredibly rich, complex and challenging ... I'd be hard pressed to think of a brown ale I've ever had that I enjoyed nearly as much. I'm a fan. Possibly too high in alcohol to be considered a sessionable beer, but I could drink this one often and be thrilled about it. Dogfish Head - changing one man's opinion of brown ale, one beer at a time. I'll need more than one six-pack of this one.

Thick creamy off-white froth that ain't going anywhere.  Smell of chocolate powder and herbal hops with light brown sugar and figs.  Burnt sugar, molasses, and bitter chocolate with an earthy and herbal hop character. Smooth and creamy and eventually warming from the alcohol involved. Faint licorice aftertaste.

10099,1161,CrellMoset,4.42,"On tap at Falls Church DFH Alehouse.  Appearance: Deep mahogany-brown, with a thin head with quite a bit of staying power and full lacing. It looks like a thick beer.  Smell: Toasted sugars and chocolate are strong here, and alcohol and esters play alongside the sweet, fruity, and mild hop notes.  Taste: Toasted sugars again, caramel and molasses sweetness, as well as bitter chocolate/espresso flavors. In fact, most everything present in the nose is present here - citrus and floral hops and alcohol (whew!) round it out. They all play very well off each other - I know I'm starting to sound like a broken record, but nothing really overpowers here, and it's all balanced well.  Mouthfeel: Omigaw, it's so creamy. So very, very creamy. ""Luscious"" is the word that comes to mind.  Drinkability: A little too alcoholic and BIG to be eminently drinkable, and it is pretty sweet, but still, it's a pretty damn enjoyable beer.  A big, nutty, toasty brown ale with a strong profile.

S: Not overly aromatic with some sweet roasted malt smells and woody, grassy hops with a metallic overtone. Very little aroma one the head recedes.  T: Big and bold flavors of grassy, earthy hops and sweet toasted malt. The bitterness is attention-getting and flavorful. Nice cocoa and licorice notes are there as well. A whiff of acrid taste which is just enough for me.  M: Gritty and more astringent than any brown ale I've ever tasted, very porterish feel. Aftertaste is distinctly grassy, woody hops and lasts.  D: Very drinkable brown ale with many unique qualites which, while they aren't my favorite, do show why so many BAs love this brown ale. It is a very big brown ale -- but bigger isn't always better. I liked this beer but would like it more if it was a little more easy-going and less like a porter.

I haven't had a ton of brown ales in the past, but the ones I had were leaning more towards the clear brown side. I didn't take great notes on this beer but what I do remember was how caramel and nutty it was. Just a perfect combination of flavors, bringing all that richness of a porter but leaving out the roastiness. The mouthfeel was a little fuller that I thought it would be. If it were just a tad lighter I would have given it a 4.5 or so because I would prefer less full of a mouthfeel for a brown ale, with just a touch more carbonation in it, but this is splitting hairs with this beer.

Taste is molassas and chocolate/coffee. Deep flavors and strong body. Nutty. There is a hop note too, which is strong for a Brown.  The Finish has a nice bite to it, with a mild hop presence and slight coffee bean bitterness.  Good job Dogfishead. Really nice Brown. It's got a big strong body, but is smooth and very drinkable.

T - Strong roasted malt flavor with a bit of sweetness and some hops mixed in. But I didn't get as much hop flavor as I expected after reading the bottle. Maybe I've been drinking too many west coast double IPAs.  M - Coats the mouth well.  D - Very enjoyable. I was sorry to see it go.  I enjoyed this.

A: It poured a reddish brown with a tan head that left a thin film of lacing along the side of the glass.  S: It emitted smells of roasted malts, brown sugar, caramel and floral hops.  T: This beer benefits from a few minutes of rest in the glass after the pour. My initial sips were donminated by bitter hops and rich dark malts. However, after a bit of rest the hoppy bitterness receded and the creamy rich malts and dark sugars began to dominate.  M: It was creamy and smooth with a medium body, modest crabonation and clean finish.

The appearance was nice, good dark brown with light brown foam. Nose is lots of coffee malt, but the chocolate flavors that come through so well in the bottle are incredibly muted. Taste is similar. Tons of roasted malt, but the chocolate and fruitiness seem to have disappeared.

Thick, creamy head that yields to a little pale surface fizz with some loose lacing left on the sides of the glass. Opaque, dark brown...a bit like a porter. Darker than, say, a Newcastle. Smells like, well, a brown ale--very straightforward--but sweeter, more biscuity. Much richer than the aforementioned Newcastle--brown sugar, molasses-like. Fairly chewy mouthfeel. Bitter afterburn. Not so sure I am too inclined for a second one in one sitting.

This is the beer i would love to have with a nice big dinner. Its 7.2%, but is still fairly drinkable. It would compliment a lot of meals very nicely. Its smooth and hearty at the same time.

With aromas that bring licorice and dark chocolate to mind, the Indian Brown packs an imposing flavor, melding all of the aforementioned smells with Arabica bean coffee for a taste that lingers on the tongue and coats the taste buds. With a nice dollop of Hershey's syrup sweetness and a touch of alcoholic bite, this tasty little number would make for a nice aperitif... or a meal all its own for that matter. Highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

T- Rich, malty and very sweet taste- the brown sugar dominates the pallet but the sweetness is very welcome and well balanced by the hops. This is a delicious session beer that goes great with a meal or by itself.  M- Smooth, creamy and almost syrupy and slightly sticky from the sweet malts and brown sugar.  D- This one is great in that it works well as both a slow sipper and an ordinairy session beer. It goes down very easy and leaves one in the mood to have another, though the slightly above average ABV can sneak up on you after a few if you are not careful.

Smoke flavor, cinder, malt, chocolate, and bittering hops, yummy. Dry finish.  M - A bit harsh on the palate. Carbonation was too high and slightly sharp. Medium body, no residues.

Hops do not hide in this brew, but share in an equally balanced portion of the aroma. Definitely the most hops in a brown ale that I have ever had.  The taste even surpasses the smell. Bittersweet chocolaty nuttiness leads along with roasted malts. Hops show up in full force, and a mild bitterness of the aforementioned flavors carries through to the finish where coffee greets them.  Medium bodied with a fairly fresh amount of carbonation keeps this one quite drinkable despite the moderately high alcohol content.  Definitely one of the best brown's I have ever had.

I cannot have been more happy. You can taste the caramelized sugar in the beer. It is great.  M- Perfect. For a dark beer it feels nice and light on the tongue. It is a good complex beer.

Label reads, ""A clean, well-hopped brown ale with aromatic barley, caramelized brown sugar, and whole-leaf Liberty and Goldings hops.""  Pours a very, very dark brown. Very thick looking. Forms an off-white head with good retention and leaves some nice lacing. A nice looking brew.  Smells of hop aroma with a very mild spiciness to it, flowery hops, hints of molasses, maybe some hints of roasted malts. Some alcohol undertones but it doesn't get in the way of the other characterisitcs.  Taste of caramelized sugar, some mild sweetness characteristics from the malts, hints of dark chocolate and molasses. Wonderfully balanced with the hops which come in as an earthy/floral boquet. Some mild roasted characteristics. Maybe some hints of dull fruit, if that makes any sense. The alcohol is well hidden and comes in mostly as a complementary warming effect. Aftertaste is slightly bitter with some roastness from the malts. Very nice.  A medium-bodied brew that coats the palate with flavor and complexity that's a little less than thick. A good level of carbonation gives it just the right feel. The higher alcohol percentage doesn't really get in the way of wanting to drink this delicious brew. It's a little dense, so you'd probably get full before you got tired of the taste.  Notes: They say it's a cross between a scotch ale, an IPA, and a brown ale, and as complex as it is, they're about right. It's different than most brown ales out there, that's for sure. The flavors blend great and are nice and balanced. Easy to drink mainly because it's so darned delicious.

Taste is as the smell promises, a very well balanced blend of nutty, smoky and earthy flavors with a slight sweetness that, while detectable, is very well understated. A very slight hoppy bitterness, but its there and gone, enough to let you know but quick enough that you wont concentrate on it.  Good carbonation, in the lower end of the heavy body range. Fine aftertaste, not too dry or sticky.  A very good example of Brown Ale, very much drinkable on a non-session basis. A good warming feel from the alcohol content, and a great winter time beer to pair with cheese and crackers while relaxing. Overall, from the smell to the balance to the batch-to-batch consistency, a great example of what a craft beer should be. Flavorful, intriguing yet with an ability to appeal to more than just hop heads, big beer fans and other craft brew fanatics, I think this, along with the 90 Minute, are Dogfishs best contributions to trying to broaden taste profiles of non-craft beer drinkers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

I can identify the hops and yeast as they mingle with the myriad of sweet notes. A quick smell of fertile dirt. Images of fields of perfectly roasted malts come to mind.  Taste is nutty, wonderfully sweet and full bodied. Toffee, caramelized sugar. Followed by a respectable, balancing hop bitterness that knows its role and takes a back seat to all the beautiful sugary and toasted notes. Wonderfully alcoholic. A quickly vanishing grassy taste when I swallow as the beer warms. I want roasted pecans, toasted almonds, a wheel of baked brie with honey and toasted crackers. This is a dessert in and of itself. Pure hedonism.  This beer pleasantly coats my mouth with a succulent chewy feel, absolutely begging me to feed myself more. Smooth, buttery, and well rounded. Rolling the brew around my mouth, the carbonation tickles only the very tip of my tongue.  At 7.2 percent ABV this beer is beautifully drinkable. Settles maybe a tad heavy in the stomach, but theres no reason to try and drink any more than a few of these, and its certainly not unpleasant. A feeling of contentness resonates through out me.

Pours a nice dark amber, almost dark brown with a one finger head that dissolved into a pleasant lace that went down along with the beer nicely.  Smelled great right from the pour of what I would expect from this style-malty, a bit sugary, and some chocolate/coffee hints.  The taste follows right through from the smell and it was well balanced with malt, chocolate, sugar, coffee, and hops (of course!) flavors all of the way through.  Not too heavy, but definitely a full beer. I was a little weary of the 7.2% ABV, but I didnt really detect too much alcohol-that can be a bit dangerous as it went down pretty smooth. I could drink these things all day if I wasnt sure that they I would have a problem standing later!

Full of flavor unlike most other brown ales that I've had. Good and dark as well. I enjoyed this quite a bit. Well done, DFH!  EDIT: I had to re-visit this one as I didn't do it justice the first time... Having had it again fresh, this is the best DFH brew I've ever had and without a doubt the best brown ale I've ever had...

10099,1161,younger35,3.94,"My buddy from Colorado sent me this brew along with a four pack of Ten Fidy. Dogfish head has been hit or miss with me but I really love Brown Ales. Drank from my Squatters nonic pint glass while watching UCF vs. Mississippi State.  Appearance- Pours fairly thick and dark brown with amber highlights and a small tan head. Leaves a lingering thick collar but almost no cap or lacing. Smell- Big roasty toasty malts that lend a rather sweet scent with hints of chocolate, burnt sugar, molasses and maybe even a hint of smokiness. A light fruity hoppiness is detectable but hidden pretty well by the malts. Taste- Not as sweet as I was expecting from the nose which is a big plus. Starts with a slightly burnt malt sweetness that is nutty and deceitfully chocolaty. A bit of over roasted French roast sweetened with brown sugar also joins the party. The hops borderline on being citrusy but more realistically are lightly floral and add a bit of lingering bitterness. Finishes with a swift kick of alcohol and a bitter nuttiness. Mouthfeel- Medium smooth body with an oily finish and medium prickly carbonation. Drinkability- This is definitely the best brew Ive had by Dogfish Head (maybe tied with 90 minute).

Held up to the light, it's a deep russet color. The smell is very woody, none too strong. Taste is where this one gets me: perhaps a tad on the sweet side, it has undertones of the burnt caramel they put into it, again with those woody, now almost piney notes, which give way to a very mild and earthy taste of malt. Hops come up high in the aftertaste, with mellow and pleasant bitterness; the alcohol really kicks in at the end, too. Mouthfeel is chewy, but not excessively so; it's a lot of fun to sip away at it. Its drinkability is a bit above average for a beer so dark, but I can't see putting away more than a few in a session.  All in all, a very nice beer.

The taste presents the maltyness of the 2-row english barley, used for the 90 minute, followed by a strongly toasted, roasted flavor with a hop bitterness and nutty ale finish. The mouthfeel is medium to heavy, but delightful with crispness from the brown sugar, the toasty maltyness and a medium to sharp carbonation. This beer is definately drinkable but the intense toastyness is overpowering at times. Good beer.

S: Nice full smell of caramel malt, with a distinct French roast coffee smell, and a bit of floral hops, interesting.  T: Caramel malt and brown sugar/Rapadura hit the tongue first, which is then balanced by a spicy hop character, leaving a sense of grass on the tongue.

Plenty of lace left on the sides of the glass...one very good-looking beer.  Aroma brings up toffee, brown sugar, coffee grounds and sweet baking chocolate. As with most browns, it's too faint to wildly shake the nostrils. Just...kinda...decent.  Flavors are rich and round, animating what the nose picks up, also offering big dark fruits for even more flavor. As it warms, a light anise and burnt grain nuttiness arrive, sitting in the back but politely raising their hands for attention. Letting it warm a little also reveals a flare of alcohol warmth. Juicy hold in the mouth and a clean finish with more sweet baking chocolate coming through.  This comes real close to a porter in feel and flavor...whatever you call it, it's really good, superbly balanced on all fronts.

Smells of molasses and caramel with some roasted notes.  Taste is altogether good for a brown ale. While often a very boring style in the US, this helps provide some substance to the style. Molasses and some breadiness in the flavor with a nice dose of hops after the initial sweetness. Roasted qualities. The flavors don't linger that long. I'm liking the use of hops here.  Mouthfeel has medium to full carbonation, ending pretty cleanly. Drinkability is good on this - despite being an over 7% brown.  Recommended.

10099,1161,ksbrainard,4.17,"Appearance: Deep ruby red and caramel brown. It is clear as can be. The head is very thin, and exists only at the sides of the glass as the glass empties.  Smell: Immediately chocolate and caramel aromas hit me. Then my nose is flooded and I can't smell anything. As it warms, a more direct dark roasted malted grain smell is in there, like a bag of crushed specialty grains. I can't smell any hops.  Taste: The first impression is an assault of hops, alcohol, and dark malt. There are dark fruit-like flavors in there, but it is not overdone. I suspect a relatively restrained fermentation temperature, which is to its advantage. There is a nice balance of roast, fruit, alcohol, and hops. Even though this is not a Belgian, it is Belgian-esque in its sublime balance in all directions coupled with deep complexity. And it just gets more full and delicious as it warms up throughout the glass. The alcohol edge even softens as it warms. A bit of a smoked quality even emerges in the middle of the glass.  Mouthfeel: Full and rich all around, but not too sticky. It ends bitter from hops and alcohol, which dries it out a little, but not too much. Again, as it warms it gets softer, fuller, and more satisfying.  Drinkability: This is very enjoyable, but not a session beer.

S: Heavy roasted malt --very strong, almost like burnt sugar on a Creme Brulee. I would have mistaken this for a porter or Imperial Stout if someone had handed me a pint. There also seems to be a slight cherry smell behind the malt but it's buried so deep beneath the malt that it's hard to appreciate it. Unlike other reviewers, I did not detect any hops aroma to balance out the malt at all.  T: Very dominant bitter, coffee flavor, with some carmel sneaking in upon taking a second, deeper sip. Some hint of the alcohol content but not so strong as to overwhelm the flavor.  M; I suggest letting this one sit and warm a little. It seemed overly carbonated and heavy on the mouth at first sip. A little more time in the glass and it took on a nice smoothness, with a bit of a dry finish.  D: Overall, a difficult beer for me to decide on. A bit harsh at first, almost like old coffee. But it improved nicely with some time in the glass as I drank it. Or maybe that was the alcohol content.

Chestnut brown body with reddish highlights, capped with a massive off-white head. Looks great.  A surprisingly (or maybe not so much, considering the source) hop-laden nose. The bottle advertises ""whole-leaf Liberty and (Kent) Goldings"" hops, but I'm only picking up the former. Smells nice but off for the style.  Mild roasted flavors and brown sugar are almost completely overwhelmed by the hops. This IS Dogfish Head, so I shouldn't be surprised. Caramel aftertaste lingers, redeeming the beer a good deal.  Mouthfeel is full, bordering on creamy. All-in-all, it's a typical ""let's see if this works"" approach by the boys from Milton. It's actually a pretty good beer, but when trying to fit it into the brown ale category it fails somewhat...perhaps it's just over-ambition. Hell, I'll take that over the alternative any day.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Slatetank,3.73,"Thanks to tenderbranson69 for this bottle. poured cool into a nonic. A - Cola brown w/ a light tan head of approx 3 fingers. Rings of lace halo the glass.  S - Malty, nutty caramel and wooday aromas w/ sugary scents and a slightly boozy hoppy odor.  M - Dry gently roasty w/ a bit of boozy brown malted feel. A residually sweet biscuity toasted texture in the sweet finish.  T - Rich nutty sweet malt w/ roasted barley flavors an a taste of light brown sugar w/ gentle fig like flavors. A boozy sugary rum quality is apparent w/ a slight tinge of belgian yeast in the taste. The hops are there but not obtrusive, very mild and slightly spicy.  D - A fine brown ale w/ candy sugar and rich maltiness w/ a nice touch of alcohol int the flavor. A nice hop accent adds a bit of spice. I consider this to be a nice brown, but not highly drinkable w/ the noticeable abv and sweetness.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,burnstar,4.25,Pours a dark brown with a light tan head. Aroma is dark roasted malt and floral hops. Some caramel and coffee notes. Taste is assertive roasted malt. Burnt malt and coffee flavors. Plenty of hops provide balance to the underlying sweetness. Some bitterness from roasted malt and hops. Somewhat imperial stout like. Full bodied. Pretty drinkable. Really nice beer overall.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,smurphy77,4.5,"Pours a mocha colored beer with sprightly bubbles and a medium-sized tan head. Smells of sweet, caramelized sugar. Flavors of roasted coffee and roasted malt are most prominent. The body and carbonation give this beer a very light feel despite it's darker, bold flavors. Equally enjoyable paired with a juicy burger, a bit of chocolate for dessert or as a standalone beer. Great case to keep on hand.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Alcohol was also present as it warmed.  T: Much more alcohol and hop presence than any other brown I've tasted (although to date that's a fairly short list). Notes of coffee & chocolate (both milk & dark) too.  M: Medium bodied and quite smooth. Bitter finish with an alcohol burn.  D: Big flavor. A beer I'll gladly return to, but the alcohol presence cuts into the drinkability.  Edit: Found two sets of old notes on this one. Averaged the scores. The notes themselves were similar, except the 2nd (higher rated) review made no mention of noticeable alcohol.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,mnstorm99,3.4,"Nice dark brown color with a small tan head that laces well throughout. Aroma's of spicy hops stand behind a very sweet malty touch of carmel. Taste is first and foremost of the brown sugar (I know it says it on the bottle) which is tough to get past, not a flavor I am very fond of. There is a tinge of the hops, but this beer has a great mouthfeel and I enjoyed the aroma, so I will definately be cellering a couple of bottles to see how it does.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Folderol,3.43,"I remember this beer being better when I sampled it a year and a half ago. Now it seems somehow off-balance, like there's nothing in it but dark malt and hops. It's not as sweet as I remember, and the taste is just a constant battle between roasted, charred astringency and dry hop bitterness. Reminded me of porter that's missing some ingredients. Maybe this batch was just too young.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,praufs01,3.23,"Appearance - Dark Brown with a clear deep red ruby glow when held to the light. Small tan colored head with light lacing.  Aroma - Light hop aroma that was overpowered by a burnt sugar and molasses smell with faint hints of alcohol.  Palate - Medium carbonation with a sticky up front feel followed by a dry chalky finish.  Flavor - Moderate bitterness with a burnt sugar taste. There are some noticeable alcohol notes here with an almost bourbon like quality.  Final thoughts - I can appreciate what the brewer was trying to achieve. However, although the brew is unique it is not great. To me its not session beer but I am glad I tried it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,biggmike,4.2,Poured an attractive brown color with slight off-white head that begs to be drank. Aroma is of caramel and chocolate with a maltiness to it.

Good drinkability.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,brantadid,3.83,"Poured a nut brown color intoa pint glass. Nice off white head which diminished very quick. No lacing.  Had a very fizzy mouthfeel. Flavor was very balanced. The malt and hops blend perfectly. Has an insanely long, sweet finish. Actually got a slightly sour tast on the mid to back palate before transitioning to a sweetness. This presented as the beer warmed.  I wish this beer was less carbonated. The amount of carbonation takes away from the complexity of the beer.  Alcohol was mostly masked. Some heat was detected from the alcohol.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Very well made and thought out brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Deus1138,4.6,"Poured into a pint glass. Dark, golden brown color. Head starts off a quarter inch thick. Also a beautiful golden color.  Smells of toffee and caramel.  Taste is exceptional. Nice, smooth, chocolate, coffee and caramal malts. I don't detect much in terms of hops. This isn't a complaint, just an observation.  Leaves a nice aftertaste. It's like I just drank some hot cocoa and coffee.  I classify some beers as ""sipping beers"" because they are so strong in terms of sweetness, bitterness or alcohol content. I would only classify this as a sipping beer because the flavor deserves your attention for a very long time. Let this one sit on your tongue for a while!  Dogfish Head has impressed me once again. I'm glad so many of their brews are available in my area.

10099,1161,dankman38,4.03,If you like to visit Starbucks you will love this beer; the taste of coffee is very heavy with light accents of chocolate and burnt hops. The finish isnt as strong as some of the other beers Dogfish Head has produced (some are almost overwhelming) but it is just strong enough. Very interesting beer from a very interesting brewery.  Please note: I would have given this beer a higher score but I dont really care for coffee.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

The nutty flavor comes forward more as you go on.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and easy to drink. Not much in the way of carbonation. Good thickness as well.  Drinkability: High drinkability.

So I thought to myself its an ale how so bad could it be, so I bought it. So heres the rating on first glance it looked great but that inch of foam in my glass dissapered pretty quickly but it did leave a lacing on my glass. The smell to me was great with a taste of coffee and hops. Yet again to me the taste was similar to a stout but less harsh and alittle hoppy but not too strong and smooth. In my mouth it was very smooth not much carbonation and easy going. The abv in this brew is higher than most beers but its still very drinkable, so I would recomend this with a good meaty meal like a steak or something of that nature.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Visible surface pools of effervescence and a sheet of lacing that's along the full length of the glass. The smell is really rich; a creamy smoked roast malt and sweet chocolate aroma. Medium-full bodied, the mouth feel is creamy yet adequately carbonated with a nice hop tingle. The flavor is quite good, but its not a big full flavor, like Empire Downtown Brown. The nose is bigger than the flavor. I'm enjoying that the roasted characteristic is 'in the zone', meaning that its not not 'burnt' or overwhelming. This is a really nice drinker.

Goes down smooth with a bit of an alcohol bite in the aftertaste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,tapman,4,"A- A dark, dark brown in appearance with a creamy, tan head. Really dark for an Indian, Brown, or Indian Brown Ale. Shows a lot of promise.  S- Sweet caramel and chocolate barley malts dominate to nose on this brew. Tangy hops compliment the malts well as they are not grassy , but bitter. Musty, dusty aroma that makes one nostalgic for old chicago museums.  T- Caramel and toffee malts. There's a hint of chocolatey smoothness though not quite chocolate, just a bland mixing agent to tie everything together. Hops are a little lost in the alcohol, but when it warms up a little they are quite sour and bitter. The mix of sweet and sour are a staple of the DFH IPAs.  M- I want to say that the mouthfeel, thanks to all of the sugar from the light/medium malts is chewier than most. With the alcohol in the back the finish has a sharp bite to it that one gets used to and begins to happily anticipate after every sip.  D- While not as high for me as with the 60 minute IPA, which is very surprising since I love American Brown Ales and their ilk, the extra alohol hurts drinkability. Its more of a sipper, though not so strong that it isnt refreshing and enoyable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

T- Taste was very pleasing. Roasted nuts, coffee beans, dark chocolate, malts, molasses, some cinnamon.  M- Mouthfeel was thick but sleek and smooth.

Great beer- excellent flavors.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Taste nutty first with some good tasted/caramel flavor. The hops is there but not prominently. There was a bit of a bitter/burnt aftertaste which detracted some from the overall taste.  The beer had good medium body and carbonation. It felt good on the palet and was fairly drinkable. Another good quality beer.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Molasses dominates the nose for me, with caramel, cocoa, and a hint of the heat that is to come... Taste sweet molasses and chocolate up front, followed by a not so subtle hop profile and warming heat from the fairly high ABV... Definitely leaves the mouth something to think about for a while after it's gone. Smooth and silky contrasted by abrasiveness of the hops and alcholic heat...

The head is pretty beige and is pretty thin, but it does maintain itself as a thin covering.  S- Definitely some chocolate, molasses, and a little nutty. Coffee on the tail end.  T- Just like the smell, but with a little more kick. Really pretty smooth- flavor wise. Just a tad bid of warming from the 7.2% alcohol, but nothing that really bothers me. Quite a long lasting tasting beer.  M- Smooth overall with the carbonation adding the extra lightness at the end to enhance the flavor.  D- For the ABV, I found this to be a surprisingly tasty and easy to drink beverage.

Aroma is milk chocolatey, roasted malts, cocoa and molasses. Taste is nice and sweet before the hops show up  a bit more bitter than this style is typically, but it is not too the detriment of the brew. Nice spicy kick from the hops.  A great beer, taste-wise for this style I would rank it behind only Sam Smiths Nut Brown. A great beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Gambrinus1184,3.87,"Poured from a 12-ounce bottle into my Dogfish Head pint glass.  A: Pours a nice root beer color that turns ruby when held to the light. A generous two finger head formed, which turned to a lovely tan lace within moments.  S: I can smell the brown sugar on this thing a mile away. Smells of a generous amount of sweet, roasted coffee malts too, with an earthy, fruit/raisin backbone. No real hops detected, though there's something herbaceous about this brew. Not a lot of alcohol in the nose either for an ABV of 7.2%  T: There are those bitter hops mentioned on the label. The hops wash down pretty quickly, but leave a burn in the back of my throat. In its wake are sweet malts and an earthy, coffee finish. Really complex and enjoyable, although a bit unbalanced. (or off-centered, as they would say)  M: Mouthfeel is lighter than the taste or smell. It enters on the light side, but finished sort of heavy. I think that's a plus for me; I like some hearty substance from an American Brown.  D: It's easy to drink one or two, but I wouldn't recommend too many more than that. The flavor will overpower your palate after a few brews, so take it for what it is, or enjoy one or two on a cool evening.  I'm a sucker for most things Dogfish Head, and their mad scientist brown ale is no exception. The whole-leaf hop flavor may deter some, but for IPA fans dabbling in American Browns, you'll feel right at home.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

The smell is strongly of malt with a roasted smokiness reminiscent of a Scottish ale and hints of coffee  The taste follows closely with a roasted nutty sweetness followed by a slight hopiness and distinct coffee flavors in the finish. The aftertaste may be the best aspect after some initial alcohol and excess sweetness.  The mouthfeel is fairly clean.  I think more than one might be too sweet for me but in terms of weight and bitterness it's fine just a little unbalanced.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Woody and earthy fragerance as well; almost an espresso with half n half. Can also make out a grassy, earthy tone as well.  Pallette is hit with a roasty, brown sugary flavor followed with a nice round of hops and chocolate finish. Chewy mouthfeel that ends with a tart finish on the roof and back off the mouth.

Smell: Clean - almost lagery so at first - but as it warms all kinds of aromas start coming out: nuts, sweet caramel malt - vaguely cola-y, and roast coffee.  Taste: Much more than I was expecting. Nuts and caramel quickly give way to a clean bitterness and roasty aftertaste. Hops are more than enough to compensate for the sweet malts here - I appreciate that I can actually taste the hops, unlike some other brown ales. Finishes clean and dry. Flavorful, but still light enough on the palate to be quaffable.  Mouthfeel is light-medium, carbonation just right, drinkability is high, despite the alcohol content (which is well-masked, anyway).

Deep, rich brown color, a bit of hops in the nose and a rich, smooth mouthfeel. Taste is rich brown malt with just enough hops (and a bit of astringent alcohol taste) to keep you wanting more.

Smells of sweet malt, toasted nuts and a breath of fresh hops. Starts off tasting of some toasted malt, some coffee and a beautiful hop finish. Mouthfeel is nice and full, some carbonation and a tasty bite from the hops that lingers on the toungue. For a stout this is good, for a brown ale this is fantastic.

Tastes hot, with rummy caramel note and subtle coffee note. Excellent strong bitterness on the front with a somewhat dull finish lingering.  Drinkability is pretty good, worth trying, but I'd grab something else for the next round. This might be their tweaked rendition of Tony Simmons' recipe for Poor Richard's Ale created for the Brewer's Association to commemorate Ben Franklin's 300th birthday.

A few big chunks of lace by the end.  Smell is toasted German bread and bittersweet chocolate. Molasses at first and then something vaguely herby riding on booze. More like a stout than I expected.  Taste is at first much sweeter than expected, but fades to a bitterness that carries the darky, toasty malts' chocolate and charcoal flavours very well. Hopping is more obvious with some alphas on the tongue. Less herbal and more oily, but not piney or soapy in either case.  Feels a little heavy on the palate after each sip. Drinks like I'd expect a winter warmer to - upfront and pushy, sedating and full.

The smell is denser and more complex than is typical for the style. Part of that is the hops, but even the chocolaty, roasted malt base invokes a porter or even a stout more than a brown. There's a lot going on in the taste as well, which is malty (per the nose) and sweet (sugars and dark fruit) up front before parting for the hops. The alcohol is evident but by no means overwhelming. Smooth, medium-bodied mouthfeel gets dryer in the finish. A really interesting brown ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,hustlesworth,3.98,"first IBA (or ABA?) i've ever had (i think). bought on a vacation to NC, i was VERY surprised when i poured it into my pint glass...  A- i expected brown, but i didn't expect this deep dark reddish brown with about 2 1/2in of dense sticky tan head that looked strikingly similar to quick-set foam insulation. over all it looked like coca-cola until i held it up to the light letting rays of red shine through. the foam settled slowly to about 1/2in leaving almost no lace on my pint glass.  S- as soon as i opened the bottle i got dark chocolate, but when i stuck my nose in the glass there was fine dairymart-style arabica coffee, more bittersweet chocolate, burnt toast, burnt grains and something in the background that was fruity and floral at the same time, maybe the liberty hops?  T- coffee, more like cappuccino with a lil cream and an effervescent glob of dark chocolate dropped in. roasty caramelized malts followed by unripe plum and dried fig with a bitter coffee aftertaste. when i burp it's plum and fig all the way baby.  MF- smooth and creamy, i'd like a lil bit more carbonation so i know that i'm drinkin beer, not some fancy alcoholic caramel-mocha-chino.  D- i'm not one that goes for coffee or dark chocolate flavors, but i know now what to expect from a quality organic brown ale. it's complex and aromatic and it reminds me of sitting by the fire with a pretty girl in the dead of winter. right now, in the heat of summer, not so much. despite my prejudices, i can't seem to put the glass down.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Poured a deep dark brown with a huge tan head, lots of lace left over on the sides. Smell was lots of hops, pine, with some sweetness mixed in. A touch of some earthy, grassy flavors as well. The taste was great, good malt back that was hoped to all hell. Very fresh taste, and a sstrong biting finish. Alot of similarity to the Terrapin Brown. Great smooth feel, lots of carbonation made it go down smooth with a nice dry finish. I could easily see myself drinking this on a regular basis. It was really just that good.

10099,1161,BretSikkink,4.08,"Mahogany brown, with tiny-bubbled foam that forms a very tight and strong head that lasts throughout. Lacing is maximal, and a tan brown color.  Baker's chocolate is all over the nose, as what sweetness is there seems to belong to caramel malting..dark fruit esters, a latent lactic scent, and present but minimal herbal hops round out the profile. Solid.  Almost but not quite roasted flavor mirrors the chocolate of the nose, deep and luscious flavor that is at once nutty and also almost milky sweet. Carob flavored body is balanced by restrained hops, a little oily, but there must be big quantities to match the big malt body.  Smooth, with good complexity pulled from a medium sized body. The Indian brown is more drinkable than a stout or porter, with many flavors matched. At 7.2%, it gives up little in size as well. Big ass ale, and very tasty.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,fank2788,4.15,"12oz bottle, with a bottled on date of 4/11/07 served in one of my brand new Sam Adams pint glasses Indian brown looks pretty nice in the glass a deep dark brown almost black with at ton of ruby highlights with a tight head comprised of tiny bubbles. The smell is caramel malts, brown sugar, alcohol, oak and vanilla with a touch of grassy hoppiness. The taste starts out all dark sweet malts and sugars. You can pick up everything from lighter caramels to roasted chocolates in there, the alcohol is also fairly noticeable especially at warmer temps but stays under the control of malts. A touch of oily grassy hops adds just enough bitterness to make the finish really interesting. The mouthfeel is very thick yet so smooth and very satisfying. Drinkability is good too, considering your mood. Don't grab one of these if your looking for a classic brown ale. Indian brown definitely falls close to the line between brown ale and porter but whatever you want to call it this is one serious beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Not overwhelmingly malty, but strong. has a nice finish M- Light carbonation with a medium/light body D- pretty good, a solid brown ale, however not exceptional,",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,pmcadamis,4.23,"A - Caramelized brown hue with a ruby cast. The brew is pretty clear when held to the light, and topped with a solid one finger light brown head. Lots of really thick and sticky lace is left on the glass. A good swirl brings the one finger head back in full force, and the everlasting head seems to become a deeper shade of brown as it warms.  S - Peanut butter and coffee grounds with a whiff of malted milk chocolate add up to a very nice and malty brew. Autumn leaves, toasted nuts, and charred wood remind me of the fall.  T - Toasted grains, loads of bitter black coffee, some dark bitter chocolate towards the sweet finish. Burnt, charred wood and burning leaves again. The alcohol becomes noticeable as it approaches room temp, but it never detracts form the flavor, but rather adds to it. This could fool me into thinking that it's a stout in a blind taste test (reminds me of Guinness Extra Stout in a way)...the extreme nuttiness is the only thing giving it away as a brown.  M - Velvety mild carbonation and a full body. Delicate in the mouth before a solid WHAP! of bitterness takes it to a bitter but only slightly dry finish. Seems to dry up more as the long aftertaste fades away. Nice.  D - This is my first American brown, although I've had many English versions of the brown ale. I definitely see the difference now...where the English browns are malty, sweet, mild, and easy-drinking session brews, this American version is a nutty, toasty, relatively highly hopped slap in the mouth! I like it, but one is enough....for now.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,albern,4.07,"What can I add to the previous 600+ reviews ... this beer is a bit of a surprise in that it is clearly a porter and borderline imperial russian stout. A nut brown ale this one is not. One delicious whiff and you know where this one is headed. The beer is reasonably carbonated, full bodied, thick, with a decent head and minimal lacing. The taste is chocolate, burnt caramel, and a bit of coffeeish flavor as well. It's the burnt almost charcoal flavors that are most characteristic. I'm drinking this on a hot summer day and I need this one like I need a hole in the head. If I only knew, I would have saved it for a chilly January instead. The malts, hops, and burnt flavors are all dancing about and are well balanced in that they all equally hit you over the head. There is nothing subtle about this beer. This is a very good beer, not a nut brown, and definitely not a summer beer. Save it for the winter months and it will be even more greatly appreciated. The ABV is high, but the alcohol flavors are subdued, and this is appreciated. L'Chaim",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,TuckerCarlson,4.42,"A moderately aggressive pour into an imperial pint glass yields a solid finger of creamy, dark tan foam on top of a coffee-colored, slightly translucent brew. Head dissipates slowly, leaving a ring that doesn't want to go away.  Nice chocolate smell with some coffee and grassy, herbal notes from the relatively high hop content. Some sweet citrus rounds it out.  Definite chocolate and coffee flavors without too much sweetness; not a dessert brown ale like some. Ends up crisp and dry with grassy and herbal flavors and leaves a nutty finish that lasts and lasts. The coffee flavors are better than most coffee, even most good coffee.  Shockingly smooth (especially considering the ABV) and bewitchingly complex; I could drink this every day.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

S: This beer has a hearty malt aroma with a good chocolate blast. I don't get any hop aroma off of this.  T: This is a very full flavored beer and I like it a lot...definitely more than last time I had it. It has malt, caramel, and a bit of chocolate in it and finishes with some bitterness, but not overwhelmingly so. It's been a while since I had this and I think my IBU tolerance has gone up by a factor of 10 since then, and now this barely even registers.  M: This is one hell of a creamy beer. It is decently heavy bodied for a brown, but not Double Stout thick.  D: I am usually impressed with DFH and this is no exception.

They call this beer an American Brown Ale but you could almost put this in the Imperial Stout catagory. Looks great, almost black. Smells potent but inviting. Taste is is like wang dang sweet p... well you know. Actually hints of coffee and chocolate. Dogfish head needs to tone it down everything is tooo over the top (7.2 abv why?).

Light aroma of malt - not off to a great start yet. Ah, but the taste is better than the smell. Heavy on the malts and a lot of flavour overall. I'm getting some roasted coffee flavours.

Roasty, coffee, and chocolate flavors are all present. There is some brown sugar,hazelnut, caramel, and toffee flavors in the background. I was expecting to have an uber sweet beer since every DFH beer I have had to date has a candy like start and finish, but this beer has a dry quality to it. Nice understated biterness with some sour twang in the finish.  Medium body with light and creamy carbonation.  This beer is tasty, complex, and drinkable.

10099,1161,Atlas1,3.93,"Purchased a sixtel of the DFH Indian Brown at my beer store today. Brought it home, hooked it up, and voila! Here I am. According to the DFH website, the Indian Brown is a cross between a scotch ale, an IPA, and an American brown ale. So THIS is what that combination tastes like! Leave it up to Sam C. and company at Dogfish Head to come up with this one. And then thank them for it.  Pours a deep rich dark brown with a nasty brownish-white foam on top (a good thing, mind you). Shines a bright orange at the sides when held up to the light. Leaves some lace too, but not much. The aroma is subdued here. I'm not sure what I'm missing, but I can't seem to detect much of any one thing. Some malt, some coffee, some bitter chocolate, some molasses, but not much any of them. Nice, but not terribly convincing. The taste is where everything begins to come together in my opinion. Rich roasty coffee flavors, mixed with hoppy bitterness, sweet vanilla, bakers chocolate, and woody spices. Very complex. A bit too big for its own britches, to be honest, because it's so damn ambitious, but it's tasty nonetheless. Just like a cross between a scotch ale, an IPA, and an American brown ale should be. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. At 7.2% ABV, I'd hardly call this a session beer, but it's still a solidly drinkable brown. Might go best with some chocolates by the fire in the winter with a loved one by your side. Then again, I'm sippin' on this puppy in the middle of June, and still enjoying it.

Beautiful Frothy head that left some of the best lacing I've seen on my .5 liter HB glass. with a deep, deep dark red color that you need some light to see.  Smell was very malty with a hint of alcohol and my favorite Hop: Golding.  Again the taste was a light Barley Wine , with plenty of malt, a bit of sweetness and some alcohol. Right at the limit for me as far as the alcohol taste is concerned.  I did enjoy the beer, but at 7.2% decided to only have a couple.

In the mouth, hops make a strong showing initially, bringing lots of spice and piney notes, some dark-fruit-like sweetness, caramel, brown sugar, lots of woody/leafy notes. Medium-light mouthfeel, a little slick, with pretty limited, light carbonation.

This is no boring old brown ale- I've tasted a few porters and even stouts with less depth and flavor than this brew. The mouthfeel is round, yet fairly light and clean as well.

The nose has an English malty profile. A sweeter almost molasses like aroma with a lighter chocolate undertones. Some astringency but limited overall. Also some toffee touches but not much on the hops side.  The taste has the malty and smooth presence of an English brown. A nice complexity on the malt side with noticeable chocolate flavors. Some bready and astringent notes but some off higher alcohol tastes that act as a deterrent. The hops are more noticeable with some earthy and citrus but still remain second to the malt bill.

I knew it was an ""indian"" brown ale but that was a surprise. Caramel and maybe some coffee in the smell.  T. This is a good brown ale that just is over whelmed by hops. The caramel and coffee are faint but they are there. Maybe some chocolate but not sweet enough to really pick it up.  It's warming up and it's actually getting a bit sweeter which is working well for me. The hops actually balance once warmer and as a few others mentioned it's starting to remind me more of a stout, or just a really rich brown ale.  M. A bit thicker than most ales, but what you'd expect from a brown ale. A good bit of carbonation. It sticks to your mouth a bit on the way down.  D. This style of beer is one you'd drink slowly imo. I'd like it to be a bit easier to drink.  This is a very enjoyable beer, but perhaps it's just not for me. I really respect what they're doing and they did a good job. I enjoy the flavor but it's too much of a mix between a great dark beer and a refreshing IPA and it leaves my mouth confused.

10099,1161,eberkman,4.05,"Pours a dark mahogany brown producing a one-finger off-white head that reduces pretty quickly, leaving a ring with some lacing. A more aggressive pour would have probably produced more of a head. We'll see. I've got 5 more of these.  The smell is a pretty good balance of hops and malt. The malts seem dark-roasted, nutty and coffee-like with hints of bittersweet chocolate.  It's a very nice-tasting beer -- a great balance between malty sweetness and hoppiness, though the malt dominates. Stoutlike espresso and chocolate qualities come to the fore, with a real molasses or brown sugar sweetness as well. It's nicely alanced by a hoppy bite, but not to the point of bitterness I find do find that with DFH, even their hoppier stuff like the 60 and 90 Minute IPAs are more characterized by sweetness than anything else -- which I generally find a little bit offputting -- so I wasn't surprised. This one -- like all of their offerings I've had -- finishes very smoothly.  Feels thick and full-bodied in the mouth. A little heavy and sweet to have more than one or two at a clip, but definitely enjoyable and goes down nicely. Of course the alcohol can really sneak up on you at more than 7 ABV.  Overall, a very good offering from DFH -- definitely my favorite after the 90-Minute IPA. I agree with others that say it seems more like a stout than an IPA (in my opinion, it seems like a breakfast stout).

M: Smooth, cream - looks heavy, but doesn't feel it. D: Great. I will enjoy this more in the future.

10099,1161,Patrick999,4.65,"Let me first say that I really like this beer. This is the unsung workhorse of the DFH lineup....not as well known as 60/90 minute or Raison D'Etre, and not as sexy as 120 min or the rest of the big beers. It doesn't scream out at you on the shelves, but it gets the job done every time. Not just another ho-hum brown ale. This baby is jam-packed with flavor.  Looks great....opaque like a porter or even a stout. Fluffy head sticks around the whole time, nice lacing.  Smell is roasted coffee with hints of chocolate and caramel, and....what's that, some earthy-smelling hops in there too. Love those Goldings.  Taste finishes with coffee and vaguely sticky-sweet toffee and caramel, but before you get there, there's a surprising degree of earthy hop bitterness. Awesome.  Well carbonated and sticky, but doesn't really cross into the realm of being too sticky. Pleasant aftertaste lingers for a long time with this one.  Drinkability...this beer is deceptive. This makes you *think* you want to session it. It tastes great. Goes down easy. However, this ale is far more substantial than you think it is. You can become pretty full, if you try to pound these. Also, the 7.2% ABV is up there, for a brown ale....it'll catch up with you in a hurry. Not *really* a session beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,goochpunch,4.2,"Pours out a dark, leathery cherrywood with a creamy khaki head that clings to the glass and leaves spiderweb lace. In the nose there is chocolate, some roasted barley, and a wonderful underlying presence of the goldings. Flavor errs more towards robust porter territory, and I'm fine with that. Good bit of chocolate with a punch of roast. Hops don't add much bitterness to this, which I think any bitterness perceived in this would partly come from the roasted malt, rather the hops give this an earthy and herbal flavor in the finish. Finish is somewhat drying but there is still some residual sweetness there. Mouthfeel is moderate and the tiny bubbles get a little annoying on the tongue. Very drinkable, but the sweetness and the high abv doesn't make this an ideal session. I really love that this is an American-brewed brown/porter/whatever that doesn't get all muddled up with citric hops. Nice earthy hops accompany the earthy malts well. This is one of, if not the best made beer in DFH's line-up.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Monkeyknife,4.07,"Poured from the bottle a very deep red-brown. Thin cream-colored head with very light lacing.  The aroma of malts and fresh coffee abound.  Taste of roasted malt, caramel, and a molasses sweetness. Finishes with a hoppy bitter edge.  Medium mouthfeel, smooth, with a mild carbonation to it.  A very drinkable beer with a lot of personality to it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,penguinjive7,4.12,"Pours a very deep dark dark brown with a nice tan head. There is a bit of lacing throughout.  Smell is of burnt malts mostly with a bit of hops.  Taste is initially burnt malt followed by hop bitterness. After the bitterness fades away the caramelized sugar speaks through and further develops in the finish.  The mouthfeel is full, more so than I expected an a bit much for a brown. Not necessarily a bad thing though.  This is a mighty brown ale. If I could name it I would call it an Imperial Brown Ale. The stronger alcohol and hop presence makes this a truly unique brew. Not typical of the style, but very flavorful and rather complex. Definitely recomended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,athensbeermaster,4.25,"I don't understand why this site doesn't except the new styles that are out there? Indian brown ale to me is much more hoppier than a american brown ale. Any way this beer kicks some serious tale. The color: dark brown, smell: roasted grain and fresh ground coffee. The taste start off with roasted grains then a huge blast of hops drives a hop spike righ thru the mid palate. Then the smooth coffee taste balances this surprising dry beer. Most of dogfish head beers tend to be on the sweet side. The mouthfeel is med.lt. The drinkabilty is very above average with its huge hop surprise and tasty coffee flavor I'll be back for more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,beeragent,3.92,"Poured into a pint glass, from a 12oz. bottle. The beer pours a deep brown, forming a 1/2 inch head, leaving light rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is of sweet malts. The taste is malts, a sweet nutty flavor, along with a hint of brown sugar. Maybe some caramel flavor as well. The mouthfeel is thick, maybe a little thicker than expected, but smooth. Overall, this is a great brown ale. However, I have to say for the price, I have tasted other brown ales that match this, and can be had for cheaper. Definitely worth a try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,jwc215,3.82,"Pours brown with ruby hues and a thin, lasting, white head. Some lacing sticks to the glass.  Brown sugar dominates the aroma at first. But, caramel, sweet grains, earthy and nutty notes soon back it up. A touch of alcohol is mixed in. Very complex and inviting.  Unfortunately, I wasn't as impressed with the taste as I was with the aroma. It seems to pull in different directions, giving it sensory overload. Brown sugar and caramel with plenty of hops. Earthy hops control the sweetness, almost too much. I don't know if they add much to the flavor as they do as balancers. They do do a fine job with the aroma. Can I appreciate the complexities of it? Sure, and for this I give it a decent rating on the taste. Is it my thing? Well, to try it. But this just seems too all-over-the-place for me. Alcohol present, though never overwhelming.  Thick while staying in a medium body. Medium carbonation. Drying.  An experimental brew that is certainly worth trying, and they do combine IPA with Brown Ale. There is something about it that I can't quite put my finger on that holds me back from liking it even more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Rudgers73,4.38,"Poured roughly from the bottle into a pint glass. Big fluffy tan head that retains very well leaving sticky lacing around the top of the glass. The beer is a very saturated hue of brown and if you hold it up to light you can see the moderate carbonation. The smell is rich roasted malts that almost have a coffee twist transitioning into a brief pineapple-ish whiff of hops. The flavor is extremely complex. It's like someone took a really caramel/roasted malt brown ale like rogue and mixed with about 5% of an american strong ale like oaked arrogant bastard to come up with this really cool brew. It doesn't have any hop bite, but you can certainly taste them. The aftertaste is also pleasant with a fresh ground coffee feel. I like it a lot.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,notoriousdav,4,"A very nice brown ale. Pours a deep reddish brown, with a light tan head. Smells of yeast, and old wood. Very well balanced, with just the right amount of carbonation.

10099,1161,sethmeister,4.4,"12oz bottle into pint glass  Pours a chestnut brown that looks near black in the glass. The fuzzy light tan colored head leaves no lace.  Scent is caramel, chocolate malt sweetness and floral hops.  Taste is sweet burnt brown sugar and dark fruit followed by a smooth long chocolately sensation and finishing with spicey hop bitterness and a hint of warming. I took my first sip anticipating a mild sweet nutty English brown ale. This is clearly an American Brown Ale: much bolder, spicier and more hopped than the English brown ales I am accustomed to. Oh brave new world!  Finely carbonated medium mouthfeel.  Drinkability is very good and I'm rueing the fact that I only have one bottle. It tastes better and better as I near the bottom of the glass.  A delicious brew. Time to go back and buy more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,udubdawg,4.27,"12 oz bottle  pours a nice cola-colored dark reddish brown, with a light tan head that quickly diminishes to a small cap. The foamy remnants aren't in any hurry to go anywhere though, sticking to the side but not leaving much lace.  Nose is full of carmelized sugar, with earthy and flowery hop notes and cocoa behind it. No alcohol initially, but quite noticeable by mid-glass, along with a fruitiness I didn't notice earlier.  This beer can't decide whether it is sweet or bitter. Caramel sweetness and darkly roasted grains abounds at first, with a bitter kick and a sweet aftertaste. Now that I'm noticing alcohol in the nose I'm still not getting much in the flavor.  Quite smooth and relatively creamy. Not particularly filling - I find I want another. Appropriate carbonation on the light side. Overall a nice mouthfeel, and quite drinkable.

10099,1161,CanaanBob,3.98,"After having imbibed this brand's IPA 90, had to give this ale a shot. I was not disappointed. Its very dark amber appearance initially made me think I was going to experience a porter-like taste, but it was, in fact, a hefty brown ale, true to its moniker. The olfactory senses were enamored by the subtle, yet powerful odor of a medium gravity alcohol aura. It hit the taste buds with alternating tones of java and chocolate, with a faint taste of brown sugar that cleansed the palate. It did not cling to the mouth, but went down clean and easy. Its drinkability quotient is high, because while it is filling, it leaves the beer aficionado wanting just one more. Not too heavy -- just right! Goes well with minestrone and a veggie sandwich.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,WAP,4.2,"I have always wanted to try this one and finally picked up a 6-pack today:  Pours a clear ruby-brown with a nice, sticky foam head. Smell is an interesting combination of brown-sugar sweetness and hops. Tastes much as the name suggests -- a nice dark-roasted sweetness reminiscent of a brown ale backed with an interesting hop punch on the back end. The sweetness reminds me of the brown sugar listed as an ingredient and combined with the roasted malt conjures images of sweetened coffee. The hops provide a nice bittering and act almost as a palate cleanser here. Overall I think they did an interesting job of combining the flavors and achieve a very nice balance. This will be a regular in the rotation.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,BWH3,2.5,"12 oz bottle from a Goblet at 50 F  Appearance: Very impressive. Gorgeous dark brown with a subtle red hue if held to light. Contrasted nicely by the off white head that tops the brew. If poured fairly vigorously, a terrific head will develop. The surface tension of the head allows it to cling to the glass and lace out perfectly atop the beer. The carbonation is just enough to promote lacing without disturbing the beautiful islands of foam. Too bad the rest of the beer is not as divine.  Smell: The dry hopping obviously dominates the aroma. The only malt I detect reminds me of the bitterness of black patent. I wish there were more malt complexity with some sort of nutty, caramel, chocolate, or coffee aroma to balance out the hops.  Taste: A simplistic aroma is forgivable, but such as simplistic taste in the face of the extravagant list of ingredients on the bottle is intolerable. The taste is basically the same as the smell  hop bitterness and an ashy quality from roasted malt. The hop bitterness lasts quite long.  Mouthfeel: Very good. Appropriate for style but does not make up for the lack of complexity in taste and aroma.  Drinkability: If you are looking for big IBUs and hop aroma in a brown this is your beer. One could easily kick back several with little trouble. But why when you could enjoy something else.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Cyberkedi,4.21,"The rich, opaque, chocolaty color demands at least a taste. Aroma is hoppy and gets the lips smacking. Taste is rich, dark and hoppy.

Definitely worth trying.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

S: Huge roasted scents up front and throughout with some brown sugary and slight bitter burnt coffee scents in there too. The quaff ends with some sweet bread scents. T: Huge roasted smack in the face. After I collect myself from the roasted flavor bomb I pick up flavors of dark caramel and stone hearth rustic wheat bread crust as well as some tart hops coming out at middle end. Finishes with some slightly sweet toffee and sweet bread flavors. Every once in a while I pick up some slight bitter coffee beans and some brown sugar undertones. MF: Medium and slightly dry on the finish. Overall: A solid brown with a HUGE roasted flavor profile. A notch above, but let's not get too carried away.

S: An herbaly hop-tinged aroma combined with a deep caramel and sugary malt scent.  T: Interesting java undertones and sweet malts in the intro to middle. A minimal hop presence opens up in the aftertaste as the heavier malt profile fades.  M: Creamy carbonation and full-bodied. Well done on the mouthfeel.

The smell is of roasted malt and some citrus hops.  The taste has huge roasted malt up front that smacks you in the face...just as I remember it. ;^) As I take more sips, there's a more than ample infusion of hop bitterness and some dark fruit notes. Man, this is great stuff! So much roastiness and there's some toffee also hitting my taste buds. And just a little bit of warming in the back of my throat that reminds me to sip and take my time with this gem. What a Brown Ale!

Taste is rich with roasted malt flavors mixed with hints of acrid dark chocolate, coffee, and nut. Mouthfeel is dry and crisp, with a good aftertaste.

10099,1161,86sportster883,4.08,"At 7.2% abv, Dogfish Head's Indian Brown Ale is anything but your typical American Brown. For a person who enjoys darker, bitter, stronger ales, this beer is a winner.  The IBA pours clear dark caramel brown with reddish hues when held to the light. A reasonably sized light tan head forms then settles to a densely packed ring of bubbles.  Right out of the bottle, this beer has very mellow aromas of roasted caramel malt with hints of chocolate and coffee.  The taste is dominated by roasted malt and coffee flavors with some nutty (and as it warms some alcoholic) flavors as well. This beer is medium bodied with a very fine carbonation that seems to amplify the taste. The finish is dry, roasty and bitter, all at the same time, with a great lingering aftertaste.  Is this your typical American brown ale? No way. More like an imperial brown, if there were such a style. What make this beer a standout is its drinkability.

Taste: A mild chocolate maltiness with tastes of nuts and alcohol twang. I've had this beer for about 5 months, so I hope it hasn't changed its qualities.

10099,1161,foureyedgeek,3.88,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  Pours a dark brown, almost like a porter, but more opaque. Some red/mahogany highlighting. Tan head, two fingers tall falls to a nice cap of foam. Good lacing, too.  Smells of a hint of coffee, dark fruits and a prominent nuttiness, backed by a decent hoppiness. Not a huge aroma though.  Taste is a somewhat astringent combination of dark malts, a little coffee, brown sugar sweetness and piney hops. Only hints of the alcohol presence. Definitely a twist on the brown ale.  Mouthfeel is medium in body, with a slightly astringent character, slight warming.  Drinkability is good, this is no session brown, but its a taste take on the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Okay lacing.  S - Pungent darker raisin grape-y fruit smells with a nice bready roasted coffee bean background.  T - Malts and hops in harmony. Everything nicely complimented by a dark roast coffee. Hints of green raisins and cherries.  M - Consistency is chewy and the hops or carbonation, I don't know which, provides a good bite.  D - Nicely crafted beer with a good dark taste to it.

Smell was sweet fruits. Nice grainy malts flavor. Brown sugar aroma came on later.  Taste was ripe stone-fruits. Caramel sweetness and bright hops. Drying finish.

Taste is really good though, a nice coffe/ toasted taste with pleasant bitterness afterwards. This is not the worlds most complex brew but I seem to buy it a lot. Very pleasant just about anytime and easy to find here.

Not as well hopped as the bottle states, but it does have some nice hop flavor. Notes of berries, black cherry, apple peal, slightly smokey. Well balanced and medium bodied. Deceivingly high 7.2% ABV....",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Absumaster,3.85,"Got this from a trade with dogfooddog.  A dark brown beer, which is hard to look through and with a thin head. Looks like a stout. After pouring some more into the glass, suddenly there is a big head, that disappears very quickly.  Smell is 'dark', molasses, slightly smokey and has a very dextrinous smell. It all smells pretty full and especially the molasses are a bit too much.  Taste of molasses, slightly roasted and pretty mild, so no sharp burn-taste. The dark malts give the beer a good maltbitterness and it reminds me of dark, unsweetened chocolate. There is also an earthy taste to it, probably the combination of the hops and dark malts. Body is medium and alcohol is not noticable. Aftertaste is roasted and dry and leaves a lingering (malt)bitterness.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Really luscious aromatic mix of piney hops and roasted malt. Delicious to inhale.  This is a really successful uniquely American effort--an aggressively hopped dark roasted ale. Floral, pine, bitter tea notes in the beginning and lingering finish, with a warm, rich, roasted coffee, chocolate malty sweetness in the middle...but the beer is dry, not sweet. This makes it very drinkable. Great winter beer, hopheads should enjoy it too. Brought bottles home---don't serve them ice cold, the beer tastes metallic at first but mellows with some warming and is nearly as good as on tap.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,ClassicBrad,3.25,"After an impressive line of brew at the Great American Brews of America festival, I decided it was time to pick up a case from this brewery. From what I hear, taking a trip to one of their brewpub/restaurant in the Maryland/Delaware beach area is a very worthwhile trip. When it comes to choices, there was hardly a shortage and far from a regrettable one. I opted for the Indian Brown Ale.  Appearance consists of a cola brown body and a healthy finger and a half head that is reluctant to dissipate. Minutes later, the darker tan, frothy head lingers over the entire top of the beverage.  Smell of this beer is overridden by a blast of coffee reminiscent of a coffee cola by scent.  Taste follows the lead of the smell. Very coffee flavored maybe too coffee flavored. The taste resides within the back of your throat for a good while. With the right drinker in the right mood, this drink could really find an audience some may find it a little overpowering.  Mouthfeel is average and, again, reminiscent of a cola or soda pop. Does not lack in body or carbonation or a reasonable balance of the two.  Drinkability is one of very few downfalls for this brew. I could probably drink one or two in a sitting. After that, I would find it hard to desire another one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Porter? Brown? Who cares, it smells good!  Dark malts and sweet sugar dominate the nose on this one. Not overly sweet and not too sublte either, it is what it is and it is good.  The first sip had me floored, so many flavors hit me. Slight roasted malt, some coffee, sweet brown sugar and a light hop finish. Wow. It got better as I made my way towards the bottom of the glass. Exceptional flavors!  Full bodied, nicely carbonated and easy to drink. For such a bold beer, it has a plesent mouthfeel.  I was slightly shocked to see this was a 7.2% offering! I didn't notice much of an alcoholic note to this and it was sooo easy to consume.  I am very happy with this blind buy and I can certianly state that this is a solid offering from DFH.

Roasted coffee and toffee and sweet molasses. Taste is very smooth and bold. It fills the pallet and rolls back down the tongue. More brown sugar and a mild bitter hops finish. Very full mouthfeel, much more than I expected for a brown ale. This is very good. My wife kept trying to steal it from me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Gatch,4.18,"My favorite Brown Ale so far. It was dark like a porter until held up to light, where it was a deep blood red.  A nice light roasted scent as well as taste. The brown sugar comes through a little on the palate and so does some coffee.  The alcohol is a little present but it's very quick and the malt takes over. It's pretty sweet all the way through and finish very smooth. The drinkability is great and I would recommend this to anyone.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Sweetness of molasses and malt are more present. I sense some hops as well, more earthy than pine/citrus. Hints of raisin and doughy yeast. Not quite sure this fits in the ABA, a little too dry. It is good, yet I thought the finish was a bit weak.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

A slight tan head dissolves to a ring around the glass after a few minutes. This is an attractive looking beer. The smell has a pleasant roasted and caramel aroma. The taste is delicious. The brown sugar is evident in the sweetness but there is also roasted malt, caramel and some hops bitterness. Nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with some noticeable carbonation. This is very drinkable for a 7.2% ABV. Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer.

I was suprised to see it there since he's a consistent BMC drinker, maybe he's starting to listen a little. Anyway... This beer poors a nice dark amber color with a beautiful head. Smell is wonderful with hints of caramel, molasses and a nice roasted(almost smokey) malt smell. Plenty of hops are in this one thus the ""Indian"" designation on the bottle. They really go well with the darker malt in this one. Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is excellent. Goes well with a sharp cheese or even chocolate. I really like this effort from DFH.

The beer poured a dark color with an abundant fluffy tan head. It definitely resembled a porter more to me than a brown ale, but was still a handsome thing to behold.  Odor was of caramel with some coffee notes, with just a whiff more hops than I would expect from a stout or porter.  Flavor mirrored aroma, as the product tasted very good with abundant caramel malt character and coffee taste notes, with some hops evident at the finish.  Mouthfeel was pleasant. Drinkability was not hugely high...I had a several beers prior to this one, and after this one my evening was over.  This product was very good, however given my previous experience with Dogfish Head beers, I expected something different, bolder, or more unusual.

The nose has a huge chocolate flavors with lots of sweet malt, carmel, and a pronounced toffee aroma. Freshly baked bread and dough come through nicely and some traces of brown sugar and molassess.  The innitial taste is semi-sweet malt with a stronge milk chocolate like flavors and a carmal sweetness in the finish. A toasted malt flavors adds some depth and body to the beer that is at first very malt dominated. Toasted bread and toffee and brown sugar flavors are all prominant. The hop character sneaks into the taste slightly and does not linging. A quick zip of bitterness on the back of the tounge and the taste finishes as malty as it began. A rounded creamy finish and hits of alcohol.  Medium body with moderate carbonation. Slightly creamy in the finish and slightly heavier as it warms.  A very enjoyable and drinkable beer. A unique malt, hop, malt sandwich of flavors. Very complex and slightly robust as the beer sits for a bit.

Always found them to be so middle of the road I would always think ""why did I bother ordering this"", chug it down and order something else. Not DFH Indian Brown Ale brother. Poured from a tap, dark brown (my wife looked at it and said ""I don't like stout""). Deep malt smell, no hops anywhere I can tell. Rich and smooth with just a bit of a bite. The thing that amazes me the most is the mouthfeel. which is present like I've rarely seen.

Smells a nice warm ale. Alcohol, malt maybe a little spice. I think I can smell the 7.2abv. I am not getting any hops.  Taste is a lot smoother than the smell predicts. Nice and warm with malt, maybe clove. Still no hops, maybe im just missing them.  Feels pretty good. Above average for the style, ill go as far as a 4 since the carbonation seems to mask the alcohol a bit.  Very drinkable. Nice and warm to the tummy.

A complex combination of roasted nuts, coffee, unsweetened chocolate, with a caramel malt backbone, and a distinctive hop bitter kick at the end.

The lacing is like a wall on the edge of the glass. Interesting look for a brown ale.  Nose: Sweet carmalized roasted barley hits the nose first with brown sugar, oak and mocha-style coffee underneath it all.  Taste: A roasted, mildly bitter coffee like malted barley flavor with some burnt sugar and a hearty, earthy, slightly spicey and leafy hop finish. I would call this the most complex brown Ale I've ever had.  MF: Full body, thick and very heavy for a brown ale. Sticky on the lips and very heady on the palate and does not lack a decent bite.  DA: Very nice for the style, this is certainly the most extreme version of a Brown Ale I've had...the 7.2%ABV will keep this one limited to no more than four though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Hops are there but not overpowering, there is just enough to balance, and there is almost a berry like flavor that comes from the hops and malt together. Full bodied, but not as much as the 7.2% ABV might lead you to believe. Pretty easy to drink.

Head was a finger of tight almond hued foam that faded quickly, but did not disappear over the course of tasting. Lacing was faint at best.  The nose was one of the better ones I have experienced in a while. Caramel, sweet brown sugar resonates, hops, wisps of pine & resin, the sharp hint of alcohol rose as the beer warmed.  On the tongue its syrupy, sweet, thick, even in richness, very malted, some mild toffee is there, perhaps caramel. The hops rise on the pallete, some bitterness, a peak, then a slide into a muted finish....wait....hmm...interesting. Not many beers ""echo"", but well after the swallow a nice, warming, teeth tickling resonence of alcohol & hops, leaving a bittersweet taste....nice.  I like dark ales, and this one was surprising. I really enjoyed all aspects of this, and would definitely recommend it, especially if you like the various genres of darker ales. Its great for a autumnal beer, and would pair well with a good, strong cheese or something hearty and peppery. Would make for an interesting choice during a beer dinner.

This fell pretty quickly to just the barest of coatings. Beer is clear, a rich dark brown/red color. Almost opaque. Almost.  Smell: Very strong malty flavor. Full of caramel and nutty smells. A little bit of hop bitterness on the nose, but not a lot of citrus hop flavors.  Taste: Malty sweet with a bitter finish. This reminds me of a Scotch ale, like it went through an extremely long boil. Lots of caramel, raisins, and mediciney flavors.  Mouthfeel: Incredibly thick and syrupy. Decent CO2 bite at first.  Drinkability: Not what I would expect from a ""typical"" brown ale. But, given that it is from DFH, I guess I shouldn't expect anything typical. Interesting beer, but I won't revisit this one.

Taste - not nearly as flavorful as the smell promises. Mostly just the malt bread with spicy hops and medicinal alcohol and sweet cherries on the aftertaste.

Served in a DFH pint glass at several degrees over fridge temperature.  Appearance- Pours a clear reddish chestnut, the light tan soapy head evolves to about two fingers and settles tightly to a thick cap. The lacing's sticky character is a nice surprise... it's a good looking beer.  Smell- Wonderfully bright, fresh hops ring out of the glass... not at all citrusy or piney, they're ""sticky"" smelling... I don't know how else to explain it. Resiny.  Taste- Complex and really interesting... there's a lot going on. Where many DFH brews use their hops as a big part of the flavor, namely 60/90/120 IPA and even Shelter, this beer is all about barley malt and caramelized brown sugar for taste... the hops are more for aroma and the very end after the swallow. The flavor is huge and mouth-encompassing, it's actually a bit too overpowering to session. It feels like a 500 calorie beer with its heavy, syrupy weight... delicious but a bit fat. Fantastic A+ hop burps.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The most perfect transition of mild prickliness to sublime seafoam... this beer's texture is divine. Smooth and slippery during the swallow, it simply can't be improved. With all of the accolades and overall balance, it just sits a bit too heavily in the stomach and therefore drinkability must be addressed and scored as such. No regrets here.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Very attractive deep brown pour and even better aroma- mix of floral hops and caramel. The taste is amazing- the character of the IPA is present as advertised but it is perfectly balanced by the burnt sugar and nuttiness of the brown ale.

Nice amount of laceing can also be found.  Smell: The aromas are very nice! Wafts of a sweet bready malts, with some floral notes, hoppy goodness to go around for all. Even a hint of cherry licorice can be detected.  Taste: Wow! This may be, the best brown ale I have ever had. This doesnt even taste like a brown ale. Tastes more like a blend of IPA, a sweet amber, and a porter all rolled into one. This beer has the perfect amount of hops, not too bitter,but just enough to let you know they are there. Some caramel malts,almost chocolately, with some bread notes. The cherries are still present but only in the aftertaste. Just enough alcohol to make this just right.  Mouthfeel: Goes down very easily. Sweet upfront with a slight bittering chocolate hops in the middle, and in the finish you can find the alcoholic cherry aftertaste. Thin side of thick bodied with a medium amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: I am very impressed with this brew. My new favorite brown ale for sure. This is truely a damn good beer, a must try!

10099,1161,goodbyeohio,4.47,"this beer underwent a major re-formulation in may of 2006. previous to this, i thought it was just ok. now, i think it deserves a thoughtful moment of my time, so here we go:  this beer pours a solid dark mass into the non-traditional dogfish head tulipint. the bottom of the glass shows deep ruby lights, and the top is pure solid darkness. the head is sticky, tan, and hangs around. the lacing is solid, in waves, down the glass as i sip from it. this beer is one of substance, and the sticky walls of goo left behind reinforce that fact.  this beer smells great, like a beer candy bar. the first thing that comes to mind is peanut butter, followed by a roasted, charred malt that evokes toffee. caramel and milk chocolate poke through the peep hole, and slight hints of hops and coffee grounds waft up as well. i could honestly sniff this beer all day.  smooth beer going down, with an explosion of carbonation and a hop-sting in the finish. from beginning to end, this beer provides a plethora of sensory stimulation. initially, i get a big dose of chocolate malt over my palate. this makes way, eventually, for a fizzy caramel aftertaste to prevail. down it goes, with fresh hop oils guiding the beer down the throat, leaving a grassy, orange chocolate apertif essence to savour in my spit-flavor. sips are gone and the lace continues to dot and surf down the glass.  this beer is a real testament to dogfish head. they took a good recipe, and despite their growing success, tailored it even more towards the more seasoned palate. iba has climbed into the upper echelon of american microbrews, and sits happily among the best. cheers, dfh, and thanks for the fine elixirs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Deep, roasted barley notes lead off a very attractive smelling beer. Clean, malty aromas provide a very balanced brown sugar sweetness. Some noticeable dark chocolate smells before a very subdued hop presence. Very nice.  The flavors are started by a strong, almost over-toasted barley presence. The dark malt flavors are almost on track with a the flavors of a porter. Malt complexity provides a deep chocolate and coffee flavor. Very light and crisp hop presence provides some bitter relief from the potent malts. Long, toffee laden finish. A finely crafted ale.  Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and very creamy. Very porter-like on the tongue.  Drinkability is excellent considering the powerful toasted malt presence of this beer. Very well balanced and delicious.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,mpyle,3.75,"A deep brownish red color with a relatively thin but long lasting light cream colored head.  Smell is interesting - a bit roasty and smells somewhat like an American porter. As would expect from Dogfish, this beer has big flavor and isn't a delicate little flower. Very much on the malty side of brown ale, with the darker malts contributing to the flavor profile. Hoppy aroma/flavor is not evident to my taste buds.  Mouthfeel is robust and pleasant, but perhaps a bit too heavy for me to down a bunch of them in a row.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,auntfloyd,3.88,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a very dark, almost opaque mahogany, with half a finger of light brown tan head.  The nose is very sweet, full of caramel and sweet malts.  The taste is also very sweet, with caramel and brown sugar hitting you upfront. After an alcohol finish, there is a very brief flirtation with a hoppy bitterness, but that will definitely be erased by your next sip.  The mouthfeel is rather good for this style. I find most brown ales to be a bit on the dry and unpalatable side, a trend which this beer completely reverses.  This is definitely the sweetest, and most ""Belgian"" American brown ale I have tasted. If you are a fan of the more traditional, laid-back brown ale (as done by Brooklyn or Sierra Nevada, for example), this ale will surprise you. If you are a fan of sweet-ish Belgian-style ales, then this beer may also surprise you, especially since you won't expect this flavor from a brown ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Thorough lacing along the glass.  Very sweet molasses like flavors emerge along with sweet brown sugar. Bits of dark malts and hops make their way through. A touch of warming alcohol makes its way through.  Deep roasted flavors with a touch of hops in the ack of the mouth. Sweet caramel flavors are mixed in coming from the caramelized brown sugar. Some hidden alcohol comes in toward the end.  Close to full bodied with a small amount of carbonation. Dry alcoholish finish along with the bitterness of the malts.

But I'm glad that I finally did. This is one of the more well-balanced hopped (of which I'm not a very big fan of) and malted (though the bottle says carmelized it tastes malty) beers that I've had. A little smoky, a little brown, a little hoppy, and a little stouty ale-ish with big flavor and a breathy alcohol finish. The first sip was especially smokey and chocolatey but after that I was gulping it down like a pirannha eating this meaty cocoa ale though it became a little watered down from the original coma of hearty stoutness.

Then hops take over, very fruity, flowery, citrusy. Also some yeasty, estery fruitiness, banana-like.  Flavor has a strong malty sweetness as a backbone, but hops dominate. Quite bitter for the style. Also too much citrusy American hop flavor for the style, detracts from what should be a roasty/toasty maltiness. There's also too much roasted barley flavor for my taste, almost stout-like and out of place here.  This is very full-bodied, with medium carbonation. Perhaps a hint of alcohol warmth.  While this beer is not unpleasant, I don't think it's very successful. I get the idea of an IPA crossed with a brown ale. But in the end I don't think the combo works. There's none of the refreshing crisp bitterness of an IPA because of the sweet maltiness, and little of the comforting richness of toasted malt since it's overwhelmed by the hops. Also, the roasted barley flavors are out of place in either style, and detract from this beer.

Has a hint of maple buried within a very heavy brown sugar aroma. This is one sweet-smelling beer.  T: Brown sugar is up front, along with some indeterminate fruitiness. Finish is slightly bitter, but is really another place for the malt to hang out. Malt in the finish is coffee-like, sweet, and roasty.  M: Medium-bodied.

Very balanced and smooth and I think it has just the right amount of carbonation.  I drank three of these and didn't want more, only because of the high alcohol.

The aroma is a bit earthy, a bit berry-like, with some sweet yet rugged chocolate in the mix as well.  The flavour is basically more of the same, however, there's a bit of tartness that comes through here that is not present in the aroma. There's also a touch of alcohol thrown into the mix that doesn't blend perfectly with everything else. It's not bad, it just kicks the flavour down a touch from what was hoped for from the aroma.

10099,1161,Kendo,3.98,"Poured dark brown with crimson hues underneath. A foamy tan 1-finger head lingered for awhile, giving way eventually but leaving good lacing clinging to the side of the glass.  Smelled of roasted malt, sweet burnt sugar, alcohol and a faint hint of something fruity -- perhaps figs, prunes or raisins.  Tasted somewhat port-like, with raisins and burnt sugar up front. Hops bitterness finishes it somewhat dry and chalky. Alcohol taste was noticeable on the sides of the back of the tongue and the warmth stayed with me as it traveled down my throat. As it warms, the flavors become a little more mellow and balanced.  Mouthfeel was slightly chalky and fairly fizzy and the body on this one is substantially heavier than your average Brown Ale.  Drinkability? This is not a session Brown Ale a la Newcastle, but it's an interesting take on the style and is full of flavor. I could have a couple in a row, but probably wouldn't want to drink it all night.  All in all this beer is a bit of a conundrum. I think it pushes the Brown Ale style about as far as it can go. To me the biggest weakness was the lack of melding of the flavors; there was a lack of balance and a bit of harshness from that burnt sugar taste, and the hops, instead of balancing the taste, seemed to end up entering the picture separately. In the end, I guess what it comes down to is this brew isn't ""smooth"" -- though like I said above, it does seem to mellow and improve in that regard as it warms.  **Note: I see this morning on the beer forum that DFH has come out with a new recipe for their Indian Brown.

Slightly thin body that had a lot of bubbles popping on your tounge. Also there was the tingle of hop oils in the mouth feel.

Lingering molasses and alcohol notes.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and sticky.  A rich full flavored brown ale. Excellent complexity. Dogfish has another winner.

10099,1161,bashiba,3.72,"Poured a nice clear brown with dark ruby highlights. A small ring of head.  Had a strong sweet alcohol smell with a woody mustyness to it.  Taste is very smooth, hints of black malts, oak, a slight sweet alcohol taste, along with a strong musty hop punch.  Mouthfeel is creamy and warming.  Nice drinkability, more of a sipper brown ale, than a session, but tasty.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,rustymoore,4.18,Pours dark brown with minimal head and decent lacing. Much like a brown such as Newcastle with a hoppy twist that really spices it up. Smells of roasted nuts and dried fruits filled the aroma such raisens dates etc. Very tasty and highly drinkable. Goes down very smooth for such a hop-filled ale.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,ChainGangGuy,4.5,"There I was, last weekend, talking about beer, and bemoaning the fact that I can't find a decent brown ale back home in Atlanta.  And BAM, what shows up in the cooler at Once Upon a Vine during my roadtrip to Richmond, but Dogfish Head's Indian Brown Ale!  Appearance: Poured out a crystal clear dark-reddish brown color with a khaki-colored head recedes to a thin band around the glass.  Smell: Chockablock scent full of sweet satisfaction - hazlenut coffee, brown sugar, and candied dark fruits.  Taste: The flavor of this brown ale is so far superior that it barely warrants mentioning, but I'll do my best. A rich, assertive malt base charges the tongue. Fiendishly sweet flavor suggesting coffee, toasted nuts, and cooked caramel (which carries with it a delicate smokiness). A restrained herbal hop bitterness allows the malts to really shine through. Finishes with a lasting roastiness.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Light on the carbonation, keeping this brew singularly smooth and creamy.  Drinkability: Yeah, to sum up: Dogfish Head's Indian Brown Ale is strikingly drinkable and incredibly tasty! For me, that was enough, but the beer is unique and clever and well done enough that any fans of the style should check it out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,bjohnson,4.35,"A: Pours a dark brown with a ruby tint if you hold it up to the light. Nice initial caramel colored one finger head. Dissipates quickly, no lace. S: Aromas of sweet chocolate, caramel, and roasted malt. Actually quite refreshing smelling also. A tad woody also. T/M: Sweet caramel and chocolate taste with a dark fruityness that nudges its way into the mix. Hop profile softly comes to life, but not overly powerful. Fast paced carbonation blast continues for awhile, but doesn't take anything away from the flavors. Extra smooth and silky through the mouth. Flavors become more pronounced and excited as it warms. Great tasting brown ale. D: Highly drinkable and enjoyable. Slightly high abv on this one gives me the willys as I could drink them all day. I would recommend this any day of the week. Find it on tap if you can!  Notes: For those Providence, RI folk. It's in bottles at the Taco Truck, AS220.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,bluejacket74,4.38,"The beer poured dark brown, with some orange tints when holding it up to the light. There was about a half inch off-white head. A good amount of lacing remained on the glass as I finished the beer. It smells like roasted malt, coffee and chocolate. It tastes like coffee, caramel, malt and some hops too. There's a nice mix of sweetness and bitterness to this beer. It's medium/full bodied and very well balanced. It's very drinkable, and surprisingly so considering the 7.2 ABV which isn't too noticable. The Indian Brown Ale is another fine Dogfish Head beer, I'll have to pick some more up the next time I see it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Tastes more like caramel and malt...the coffee aroma dissipates once you take a sip. It goes down fairly well..the first one I had was still too cold, but I sampled another for the review around 55 degrees, and it made all the difference.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,blitz134,4.07,"Clear dark caramel with highlights of amber. Basically no head on the pour, only a light tan ring around the glass.  Aroma is interesting. Chocolatey, light toasted malts hinting to some nuttiness, alcohol is evident as well. Some of the aromas remind me of a wee heavy.  Toasted notes come through again, chocolate is evident towards the finish. Alcohol is again noted but it really works well with this and isn't overpowering. Definately the most alcoholic brown I've had to date.  Crisp on the tongue initially. Thinnish mouthfeel, I'd like to see it a bit thicker. Somewhat limited drinkability. Alcohol is evident and warms the stomach on the way down, even though it does work well with the flavor, its hard to have more than one. Good stuff though, and pushes the limit of a brown ale...what I expect from DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,EPICAC,4.84,"I let this one warm slightly and served it in my NERAX pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a lightly hazy dark brown with ruby hints. A one-finger, beige head tops the beer and thins to a persistent quarter-inch layer leaving patchy lace.  Smell: Deep roasted coffee and chocolate. Just a hint of fruit and alcohol.  Taste: Sweet chocolate, fruit and caramel upfront. The finish is full of roasted coffee and chocolate bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Low carbonation, full-bodied, smooth.  Drinkability: Incredibly flavorful and delicious.  Overall: This is probably the best American Brown Ale that I've tried. The roasted flavors are bold, but are superbly well balanced by fruity and chocolatey sweetness.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,coldchill,3.94,Pours a beautifully clear brown with a thin off-white head. Nice full maltiness with an adequate level of hoppiness.

10099,1161,SwillBilly,3.85,"12 oz bottle  Appearance: Pours a deep rich mahogany with little to almost to head. A small ring of lacing lines the glass. Streams of bubbles make their way to the top.  Smell: Strong smell rubbing alcohol, not sure if this is a bad bottle or not. Also, aromas of caramel and brown sugar and coffee.  Taste: Taste better than it smells. The beginning starts with a hoppy bitterness that transitions to a sweet, roasted malt middle with hints of brown sugar. Finishes with another dose of hops and roasted malt. Very coffee like on the finish as it lingers long on the tongue. Interesting that the 7.2% abv is not noticeable in the flavor profile though its very pronounced in the smell.  Mouthfeel. Medium to thick mouthfeel and somewhat slick. Carbonation is ok.  Drinkability: Glad DFH Indian Brown Ale tastes better than it smells. I was somewhat skeptical after inhaling what seemed to be rubbing alcohol. Anyway, IBA is a hoppy brown ale with plenty roasted malt and brown sugar sweetness. Fairly well balanced with the 7.2% abv not getting in the way.. Not what I would consider a session beer but one I would try again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Good looking beer  S - Cherries, a bit of chocolate, and some roasted malts. Smells a lot like a porter.  T - Sweet fruits and smokey grain dominate. Also, there is a nice hop presense, but not enough to push this beer out of it's style. Bits of caramel and toffee are also present, making this a complex Brown that gets a little different with every taste.  M - Medium bodied, yet nearly chewy. And yes, I know that is an oxymoron.

Sweet caramel in the front, moving toward some roasted malts and chocolate through the middle and towards the back. Some coffee notes come through in the finish, along with a bit of alcohol.

The head is short but persistant - still there by the time I reach the bottom of the glass.  Its smell is its weakest point in my opinion. Definitely smells a little like chocolate and molasses and a little bit of alcohol. Don't get me wrong - it still makes my mouth water. I'd still choose its smell as its weakpoint.  Taste is very... brown. Roasted and malty with a little bit of hops. A little bitter but just perfectly so. Definitely some chocolate in there too. This one's tasty. The alcohol's a little high at 7.2% abv but this was surprising given its taste. I could session with this but I'd probably end up on the floor.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Nice looking tan head creamy and foamy, a little small as a result of the professional pour. It fades leaving just a little lace.  Smell is fantastic, coffee and chocolate coming out over rich malt base.  Taste is way better then I expected or remember for a bottle. Fresh beer is great! This beer had the kinds of flavors I would expect from a chocolate stout. Lots of chocolate & coffee flavor notes of some dark fruit and toasted bread. The finish was superb, bitter semi sweet chocolate. This brew seems to be over looked at times, as it is quite outstanding in its flavor profile.  Mouth feel also way over the top, better then most porters done right. It has a smooth and creamy full body, with a perfect amount of carbonation. This is the kind of beer you just want to hold a mouth full and work it around.  Drinkability is outstanding I would have a had more if I could but they were closing.. Too Bad. Dang they close early.

Round brown sugar malt sweetness begins the sip, then yields to a piney hop bite and a bitter, clean composted earth finish, almost medicinal -- like dandelion root. Sweet, fruity and bitter pine sap burps. Smooth yet lively mouthfeel, moderate carbonation and a medium body. 7.2% abv is hidden well enough with bitterness of the hops at the finish.

10099,1161,dreadnatty08,3.92,"Pours a highly bubbly dark caramel amber color. Lucious off white head appears quickly and sticks around a bit. Aromas are floral hoppy, brown sugar, some tobacco, and a bit of Belgianness. Flavors are well balanced. A rich chocolatey flavor blends well with the spicy, fruity hops. Slightly more bitter for a brown, but a good stab at a different style. Body is light, alcohol warming and carbonation right on. A slick coating of caramel laced with resin sticks around in the mouth. Brown ales seem to be a dying breed in the craft beer world, but this one goes to show you can make one intesting and rather tasty.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,arguemaniac,4.2,"Pours a nearly opaque dark brown with a brief but robust head which leaves a slight but sustaining lace. The rich, roasty flavor features a heavy, but rounded note of coffee (not too bitter, not too mellow) along with some brown sugar sweetness, caramel, and tasty hints of molasses. Hop flavor is there but I always having trouble separating it from the bitter burnt flavors in these kinds of beers. The lingering finish is dominated by a mellow burnt coffee bitterness. A fairly thick mouthfeel with moderately active carbonation.  A rich, satisfying and fairly distinctive American brown ale. Its heavier and roastier than most of its kind. However, I remember it being even richer and a lot hoppier when I first tried it a few years back. Has Dogfish Head slipping!? Nah, probably not, or at least not a whole lot, seeing as this beer is still fantastic. Highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

T: Taste was very malty at first and then moves toward chocolate bitterness, and nuts. All flavors stand up to each other and finish together. Well balanced.  M&D: Moderate body with full flavors.

Spicey, bready and dark malt. Great mix of flavors coming through. Had a nice mix that several other browns I've had have been showing. Not even close to several boring brew pub browns dotting the country. This one is interesting and useful. Doesn't have the obnoxious hops or overwhelming ETOH/sugar one could get with a DFH brew.

10099,1161,oolite,3.34,"I always get the 6 packs of Dogfish Head when I can, because they do not seem to be too consistent among each. It is hard to be too objective here, because I myself am not a constant, but the fact that this only seems to happen with Dogfish Head seems to indicate it isn't just me. Still, this should not be taken as an insult or even a negative by default; Kraft cheese is very consistent but that certainly doesn't help it. Craft brews, I imagine, are much less likely to be consistent than mass produced beers.  Dark reddish brown, transparent, with a short light brown head, and some lacing. The overall appearance is one of strong richness. Not a bad looking brown ale.  The initial scent is a bit of a burnt bread crust, which I also got from their Raison D'Etre. I am not sure if this is from the way it's bottled, an ingredient shared, or something else. It is much stronger in this bottle than others.  A variety of spices come through, but that burnt bread crust is really at the forefront for me. Not so much for the previous bottles I've had (from previous nights, I assure you!). I don't sense anything really exciting here.  Drinkability is nice. Enough flavor to be worthwhile, but not too rich in flavor or strong in strength to limit you to a mere bottle a night (unlike some of their other beers - again, not necessarily a complaint).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

The dark manila head fell to a thin film around the edges of my pint in no time.  The smell is faint, but what I do get reminds me of caramel and coffee with a light touch of pear.  Tastes light and smooth with some charred caramel that releases a hint of smoke. Theres also a light sweet prune and green grape sweetness floating behind the dryer elements. Finishes with a bit of coffee from the smoke and a touch of dry hops.  The mouth feel is light to medium bodied with a small swarm of little bubbles.  Every once in a while, I would get a shock of alcohol both in the nose and flavor.

I've had this beer a few times before, but never really took the time to explore the aromas, which may be the beer's strongest point. On the palate, dark, roasty malts take the fore, with mild coffee flavors. Bitterness slowly rises, cresting mid-palate before receding into the finish. The hops and roasty malt provide bitterness and astringency that hang out on the tongue, along with a sub-viscous malt presence and a latent moderate tartness. This beer requires some time and several sips to unfold. It starts off average but finishes well above-average.

Very toasted malt and sugary aroma.  Taste: It is not quite as sweet as the aroma would suggest. Nice and malty and pleasantly caramel sweet, but not cloyingly sweet. The alcohol shows through slightly and serves as a balancing agent, along with a bit of spiciness; and then there is also a hop presence in the finish and the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Very nice and smooth. It is not quite sticky but it is thick and almost chewy. I like that aspect of sweet brown ales.  Drinkability: As a fan of the style I was expecting to be pleased. DFH rarely lets me down and this is no exception. It is a very decent sweet Brown Ale that I found quite easy to drink. I would not however consider it sessionable as it would end up being too sweet after a few.  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

I'm not a hop head by any stretch of the imagination, but I bought it thinking it would be a brown IPA, you know, because they call it Indian Brown Ale and all.

10099,1161,KyleVick4,2.57,"12 oz  A: A very nice deep dark ruby color with good head. Not enough lacing though. But, nonetheless, is a very good looking beer  S: Wow there is a lot of coffee in this one. Reeks of coffee. Cant get past this overpowering aroma to distinguish any others. Maybe? a hint of spicy hops? Maybe? My opinion I want complexity, and I dont think a heavy coffee aroma should be present in a typical brown ale...  T: Coffee. Tastes to me what a mild russian impy stout would taste like. Does have some chocolate tastes from Im assuming chocolate malt. Not that impressed here especially that its supposed to be a blend of brown ale and IPA. Seems like the hop presence is lacking, or overpowered by the coffee/roast/chocolate malt. The sweetness found in the taste is kinda bittersweetness due to the amounts of coffee/roastedness in the grain. Oh well.  M: Nicely carbonated. I am a fan of the smoothness of the body. Its medium bodied but carries a good taste (just one that doesnt suit me). But not syrupy and the high alcohol is very nicely blended to the point where you dont know it packs a 7.2% punch.  D: I am an advocate of sweet tasting brown ales, so I didnt much approve of this type of style. But it was a tasty brew. I did find myself repeatedly sipping the coffee/chocolateness of this brew. Couldnt see my self having another tonight though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Zorro,4.7,"Sampled through dnrobert24 and 2MBBIF.  Pours a clear dark brown ale with a nice light brown head. Nice red highlights to this one when held up to the light.  Sweet and fruity smelling ale with a good amount of chocolate aroma. Pleasant toasted grain scents along with caramelized sugars. Some aromas of figs and fainter coffee smell. Quite nutty in aroma this is one ale that is not one dimensional or basic.  Taste is sweet and fruity at the start with a wonderful toasted grain flavor to start. Chocolate and coffee and smoky flavors kick in next and they compliment the other flavors nicely. Nuttiness shows up after a bit and is similar to toasted wheat berries in flavor. Bitterness is very subdued here for the style and that is a good thing, the dark roasted malts bring a fair amount of it that doesn't need a lot of hops. Damn tasty beer here.  Mouthfeel is very good.  What we have here is a really great beer that I have avoided for a long time just because I don't like badly executed versions of the style. A super drinkable beer that you must try even if you don't normally care that much for Brown Ales. The only thing that excludes this from being a session ale is the alcohol hit it provides. This is the only Brown Ale that I really LOVE. Very very close to perfect.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,oelergud,4.17,"Deep ruby clear body with plenty of carbonation. Creamy light brown head that could use more retention and lace. Smell is strong caramel and molasses with a spicy hop kick. Very inviting. Concentrated roasted coffee, dark chocolate beans, caramel and toasted malts make up the flavor. Aftertaste is very much like the initial flavor with added hop notes and nuts. Subtle and somewhat lenghty. Slightly dry and good coating. Good drinkability and not a hint of alcohol.  -Oelergud",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,mrasskicktastic,2.54,"A - A slight auburn brown with very little head that dissipates very quickly, moderate carbonation and a tiny bit of lacing will stick if you work hard to force it there. A paltry showing at best.  S - Very nutty odor with a bit of coffee and a lot of earthy undertones all around. Pilsner-esque grassy hops aromas strike too.  T - Alcohol is rather prominent. Granted it is a strong brown, but I don't like this much. Some nuts, grass and lighter coffee with a hint of legume blandness and a touch of commercial solvent. The aftertaste is a mild bitterness and a bit of chemical twinge.  M - Thick, creamy, gummy, and drying.  D - Not too good here. It's mouthfeel really kills it for drinkability. A bit strong to session. The taste is nothing great on top of that. I never know what to expect from a DFH beer, but it is almost always more than I end up getting. This is easily among the most disappointing of their beers I have come across. Even the more bizzarre ones at least leave me confused. This isn't a terrible beer, but it isn't one that I would expect a quality brewery to release. Edit: I had some medium cheddar with the second half of my glass. The pairing was fantastic. So if drank with a medium cheddar, The drinkability rises.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Wish they would note a bottling date!  Very rich and tangy, this could be a nice session brew, but the abv is just a tad big (7.2%), so 2 or 3 bottles might be a better choice. Overall, a very satisfying brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,akahn,3.82,"Pours a very dark ruby color with a rocky brown sugar-colored head. This head recedes to slight skim and leaves some lace here and there inside the glass.  Pleasantly sweet aroma, strongly roasted and chocolatey. Reminds me more of a stout or a porter than a typical brown ale.  Flavor is mellow. Mildly sweet, with definite chocolate notes. Dark malt flavor, and maybe a bit of a roasted flavor. Once again, this is more reminiscent of a porter than a brown ale to me! As it warms up it really comes together and the flavor and body become fuller and sweeter, with brown sugar notes appearing. The use of hops here are extremely subtle, only showing up late in the finish and as a slight dryness in the exhale. Perhaps fresher (this was bottled in November 05) there was more hop flavor. Maybe that would be tasty, but it doesn't seem to be lacking.  This beer at first seemed somewhat watery, until it warmed up. Now it is a solid medium body. Very smooth. Mild carbonation makes sure not to get in the way of the flavor.  This beer is fairly heavy and fairly sweet, so it isn't especially drinkable.

A yeasty smell as well.  T - A fruity taste initially then gives way to big time smoky flavors. Has some nice alcohol melded into the taste, as well as the aftertaste.  M - A nice smooth warming feel in the mouth. Medium bodied and a fair amount of carbonation.  D - Quite drinkable, a very interesting mix of flavors.

10099,1161,RedwoodGeorge,3.3,"An interesting approach to a brown ale that departs from the standards in some creative ways...  The pour is a deep brown with a plentiful, thick tan head. Lots of clumping and lacing as the glass is drawn down. So deep brown that it looks more like a porter and borders on opaque.  Smell is all malt with strong notes of molasses and caramel. A light hop boquet of flowers and herbs creates an interesting invitation to a sip.  The flavor is sweet - overly so with strong notes of brown sugar, prune and caramel. Only the slightest toasted grain notes and none of the yeasty characteristics you'd find in an English Brown. Some hop bittering at the end of the sip but the sugar overpowers it for the most part. This tastes almost like a Russian Imperial that didn't completely cycle rather than a brown ale. (Thankfully, no diacetyl - a pleasant surprise)  Mouthfeel is heavy and oily which is within the style. Again, more like a sweet porter than an English Brown. Plentiful carbonation and some hop bitterness keeps it from being completely cloying but it's still pretty damn cloying.  I'm rather mixed on this beer... It's interesting and tasty in many ways but I can think of many other beers that could take its place. If I enjoyed the porter like qualities I could have chosen a real porter. If I wanted a brown ale there are many better. The added hops makes it interesting but a Red Seal Amber would have been much more satisfying for that ""fruity but hoppy"" bite.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

10099,1161,benito,4.41,"Garrett Oliver, in The Brewmaster's Table, calls this a brown IPA. From my seat, this may be a bit of an exaggeration, but not by much. This hybrid brew combines some of the best elements of a sweet brown ale with a just-so hop bitterness at the end.  This pours a deep garnet with a small head and little carbonation. The bouquet is chock full of cinnamon toffee, rum, and licorice and immediately reminds me (probably for the nuttiness) of Anchor's 2005 OSA. I would give this a five if the bouquet were slightly stronger--as it is, it is a light whiff of the wonders hidden in the rest of this beer.  The other element that this shares with OSA is a beguiling flavor profile--again, the toffee is distinct as is the distinct gingerbread flavor. The hops pull through at the back of the tongue and leave a slightly off-sweet bitterness to linger in anticipation of the the next swig.  The medium-body, combined with the unique flavor profile, is just right and announces a complex and challenging beer. Kudos the DH for bottling up such a tremendous brew as one of their flagship products. I could drink this all day--again, a top notch offering.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

I was recently very impressed with the 60m ipa from this brewery and thus am trying some of their others tonight. This beer has a pronounced hoppy smell with some sense of underlying roasted malt, reminds me of the smell of a red ale (american, not flemish).  The taste reminds me some of a porter, pronounced burnt notes, the front of the taste is a strong bitter hoppy flavor but it fades quickly.  Further into the bottle my palate or the beer adjusts and there is more hoppy sour notes in the taste and the roast element doesn't appear until finish and aftertaste. frustrating as I enjoy the roast more, but when does the palate listen?  The aftertaste is somewhat burnt with a hoppy bitter element that isn't too intense. Very pleasant. The 7.2% is invisible.  I am very impressed with the general quality of product produced by this brewery and look forward to trying some other products of their's in tonight's scheduled tasting.

Smells chocolately, full, and distinctly alcoholic -- the glorious aroma filled my senses as soon as I opened the bottle. Thick brown sugar sweetness that holds on but morphs into a notable burnt-malt porter-like flavor. Hops are muted in this pour due to extended storage but are still full and citrusy, and only more so when fresher. Much like their 90 Minute IPA, the hops could dominate here and wash all else away, but the malt is so intense that it is some how both ""extreme"" and ""balanced."" Carbonation is lively -- on par for a brown ale but more than ususal for the porter this brew suggests at moments. Complexities of flavor beyond description -- nothing straight ahead or booring about this delicious brew. Alcohol is noticable but well hidden and serves only to add another layer to the complexity of other flavors.

Small, off-white head forms quickly but goes away just as fast. No lacing.  S - wow, interesting aroma. Malty sweetness, sugar up front. Little bit of hop aroma in there, but malt leads. What hop aroma there is consists of pine, citrus, grass. Lots of big, sweet, malty, bready aromas.  T - initial malt sweetness is quickly replaced by sharp hop bitterness. The aroma leads you to think this will be a very malty tasting beer. It is at first sip, but hops kick in shortly after and balance this beer out very nicely. Still, it's rather odd - the malt/hops line in this beer is very clear, the flavors don't really seem to come together that well. Instead, it goes from toffee malt sweetness, straight to big hop bitterness - sharp, spicy pine, citrus.  M - medium to medium light bodied. Low carbonation, it seems.

10099,1161,RJLarse,3.79,"I went to a local craft beer shop and picked up two of these for tasting. I wanted to taste some beers from the Eastern U.S. and Dogfish Head Brewery is frequently mentioned on BA. Seems like a good place to start. I poured this beer in to a pint tumbler.  A very dark brown color in the glass, with a minimal white head, that dissipates quickly. The head produces virtually no lacing on the side of the glass while drinking.  The smell is robust and smoky. There is a strong aroma of roasted grains, charcoal and malt. The scent is very nice.  The taste is also dark roasted and smoky, with hints of sweetness like caramel or dark chocolate. There is a very mild and mellow hop finish on the taste, and in the after taste. Its a very pleasant, but rich tasting ale.  The mouth feel of this beer is a rich, thick and a little syrupy, but not in a bad way. It is not a particularly effervescent brew, but not what I would call flat either. Its a little like a stout or a winter warmer actually, but no indication on the bottle that it is a seasonal offering.  This is a very drinkable beer. The roast flavor might be just a bit too rich and powerful to drink very many of these in a sitting, but it is a very nice brown ale. I like it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,SkeeterHawk,3.68,"Appearance: Pours a mostly clear deep garnet brown color with a quarter inch of active off white foam. The head fell within about 30 seconds to end up as a small ring around the top of the beer maintained by quite a few bubbles rising. There is a good bit of lacing on the glass after drinking.  Aroma: Quite a bit of roast along with some noticeably assertive hops. The beer leans toward a toasty aroma after a little while. As the beer warms even further, the aroma profile changes quite a bit...it starts to go a lot more fruity with apples and pears the most notable at this point  Taste: Lots of roast and fruitiness that get you up front. As you get deeper into the flavor, you can get a lot of toasty notes from what I believe is Munich malt. There is a slight caramel flavor that is separated from the rest of the mix, but still doesn't detract. The finish is pretty dry and ends with the hops and roast fighting for dominance of the final hours of the beer. Though the hopping is assertive, I believe that the roast is in charge when the beer gets done.  Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. This style has a lot of leniency, so no matter what, you can apply the guidelines to just about any brownish beer. I don't really care for the dominating roasty component. It is slanted toward the bitter too hard here for my taste. The hopping with respect to the bitterness is about right, but the roast pushes it over the edge.

10099,1161,Frozensoul327,4.12,"Wow. It's amazing what Dogfish Head can do. Pours out to a dark cherrywood color with a nice 1/4 inch head of calm foam. Masses of lacing on the interior of the glass. Medium low level of carbonation. Aromas of roasted nuts and malts, mixed with cocoa fill the nose. Taste is quite good; flavors of wood, smoked malt, hearty grain, and an array of sweet nuttiness makes this brew very complex yet not overpowering. Mouthfeel was medium-full bodied, with a wad of consistancy; far from other ABA's that are watery and weak. Good drinkability. Another winner from DFH. Recommended.  THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: The hounds approve of this joyus treat and salivate for more. Another proof that sometimes dogs are more intelligent than the drunk drinking Corona on the stool next to you...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,barknee,3.71,"With a deep color of burnt toast, this ale has good head retention and a healthy roasted-chocolate nose with caramel and just a hint of hops in the mix. Dominant flavors of dark chocolate and roasted malt sweetness are in the forefront, with a very round mouthfeel. Although well constructed qualitatively, this brew is quite one dimensional and a bit flabby but nonetheless enjoyable. Not a major DFH accomplishment, but this brew will serve mainstream brown ale aficionados with a well-deserved sense of happiness and pleasure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,geetlord,3.87,"This beer poured a dark amber with a thin light head. the aroma is very malty with a touch of hops.

10099,1161,hgrong,3.83,"Unfortunately Dogfish Head is not available here in Minnesota, so I am forced to drive to Wisconsin to get this.  Beer pours a murky brown with a small, dense, wet head. It looks like a typical brown ale, only slightly darker and with a small amount of sediment. Upon first pour the nose is negligent, revealing only a slight twinge of alcohol. As the beer warms the bouquet opens up and the malts show through. There are notes of caramel and nuts. Very little hops in the nose. The palate is smooth and sweet. The dark brown malts are predominant with flavors of caramel, nuts and brown sugar. There is a good hop bitterness in the finish to balance the sweetness of the malts. The individual characteristics of the hops do not come though, but that is to be expected with this style. The palate finishes fairly boozy. As the other flavors of the beer dissipated I was left with nothing but an alcohol aftertaste. The mouth-feel is thick but not dense or syrupy. The carbonation is appropriate but fades quickly leaving the beer flat by the time I finished the bottle.  I am a huge fan of the beers of Dogfish Head, but this is not one of my favorites. It is good, but not overly impressive. My main complaint is that the alcohol takes over and makes the beer difficult to drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,JudgeRoughneck,4.49,"This is deep, dark, molasses colored beer with a short, spongy head, about the same color as the inside of a malted milkball. he head doesn't last but keeps a thin and blotchy surface layer. Nose is alcohol, rich caramel, dark cherry, fresh grains.  Hoestly, this must be the 10th time I've had this and I still don't really have this beer figured out but it's damn tasty. Taste starts out fruity and yes, nutty. Seamlessly morphs over to the bitter side and though there are definately hops here, they really are behind the scenes, pushing more of cane syrup sort of bitter. With great ease, it all settles into a meekly flavored or light roast coffee taste as the beer goes flat in the mouth. Alcohol peeks out here and there but on many sips is undetectable. Hops finally show themselves for the finish/ aftertaste.  Lovely mouthfeel is mid-bodied with little carbonation and is so right-on for a brown. This is one of the best beers I've ever had seriously.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Boozy caramel, sweet cherries, vanilla, and a nutty touch in the nose.  Slick on the palate, medium in body with a mellow carbonation. Alcohol comes out agressive at the top, flowing into raisin, caramel, and vanilla notes. A tint of roastiness, then a peppery booze finish. Hops are pretty much MIA.  I would guess this brew was past its prime considering the lack of hops in the nose and flavor, but it's hard to tell since the damn freshness notches weren't notched. Still pretty all right.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,barleywinebrewer,4.41,"I bought this beer for a football party, hadn't tried it before. generally I find brown ales to be a wide ranging crowd pleaser, but not usually worth recommending. The color and head where more or less what I'd expect in a non-bottle conditioned craft beer. It sticks to the style but probably a bit more reddish than some.  What really stood out to me was the wonderful malty mouthfeel. From initial sip through to aftertaste, this beer brings a surprising richness to the experience. I sampled one at a low fridge temp and one more at a more reasonable 55 degree cellar temp. the flavors and enjoyment level really stepped up at a cellar temp rather than fridge temp.  It's been said nicely already - ""Very nice beer when you want something nutty and rich and brown and a bit strong!"" Definitely recommended!

Poured a nice brownish red rosewood color with a tiny head that left no stains on the side of the glass, yet stuck around with a tiny lace. Smell was rather bland, as all I could really pick up was toasty malt, semi sweet sugar and a chestnut character as well. Taste was slightly better then the smell. There are a fair amount of complexities in this beer. The malt hits you up front, but if you let it roam around the palate for a minute, you can really start to appreciate why they call it an indian brown ale when the very decent hop amount pulls through. Started off rather sweet, but ended quite bitter and a little sour. Mouthfeel and drinkability were about on the same track...pretty drinkable. I originally bought this beer because I'm a big fan of IPA's and not so much of a fan of brown ales. Having said that, I think it is time that I give more brown ales a try.

Smells like malt, hops, brown sugar, coffee and autumn. I can't describe it better than that...there's definitely something intriguing going on here, but I'm not sure what it is.  The taste reminds me of cross between an imperial stout and a hoppy ale. A strong alcohol ""bite"" plus mild chocolate, hops, and a toothy, nutty flavor burst across my tongue. This is a fairly sweet beer, and warms the mouth nicely. Flavor fades quicker than I would have liked, leaving a dry feeling in my mouth. Hints of mocha and grapes? in the finish.  Mouthfeel is warm and dry. Real dry, actually.  Not sure how to rate the drinkability on this one.

The alcohol was very present in the nose. Aroma also offered a hint of roasted malts? I do not think this Brown Ale advertises a roasted barley or malt but I tasted it. The alcohol was present in the mouthfeel but blended wonderfully with the malt. The hops provided an equally potent bitterness to match the alcohol. A small hint of toffee surfaces but diminshes quickly This almost reminded me of a winter warmer minus the spices or adjuncts, although this brew uses some caramelized sugars.

Taste was also much more than I would expect from a brown ale. Very complex with light porterlike coffeetones followed by a sweetness presumably from the caramelized brown sugar but balanced with a bitter bite and aftertaste that sticks around nicely.

The flavor is wonderfully complex and the flavors you pick out differ greatly with what else youve eaten lately I think my perception of it even changes with my mood. Thats complexity for you! While the aroma was more malt dominant, the hops have a much more noticeable presence on the palate. It has a sweetness thats balanced out by an herbal bitterness.

Alcohol, anise, and a light floral quality round out the nose.  Taste: Roasty with a bold maltiness. There's no escaping the intense sweetness to this beer. It is cloying with flavors of brown sugar, figs, cherries, and toffee. Because the beer is incredibly sweet the ending is drier than I expected.

Taste: Opens with a hint of molasses and smokiness, giving way to bitter chocolate and coffee. A nutty characteristic is present throughout. Spicy, floral hop notes are present, but are fairly restrained. Finishes with a lingering burnt roastiness and a mild metallic bitterness.

It is a bit thicker than I was expecting, but I like it that way. There are hints of toasted coffee and brown sugar. My biggest complaint about this beer is the elevated amount of carbonation.

I am currently halfway through it and the head is still present, laced around the sides of the glass. A rich nutty flavor throughout with a very subtle hint of sweetness from, I guess, brown sugar. A true ale based on the level of hops, but the hops are not overpowering the beer at all, like some beers. There is a very nice balance between the hops and toasted feel of the beer, creating a very enjoyable beer in itself. I would definitely buy this one again.

THANK YOU. Bought a 6 pack of 12 oz bottles @7.99 pricey but worth it. The ale poured a dark rubyish brown, with nice carbonation but not much of a head. The flavor was malty sweet w/ choc. molasses , and some coffee overtones. Very smooth mouthfeel...almost too smooth... I didn't taste the relatively high alcohol content..but started to feel it on my 3rd glass. Goes down so smooth you could easily lose track during a session. It tastes an awful lot like my favorite porters but not as thick and filling. The hops balance the malts nicely especially as the beer warms a little.

The first taste to hit me was the somewhat syrupy sweetness that I have found in every Dogfish Head beer. This was wonderfully thick and the brown sugar came out very strongly as it sat in my mouth. It went down very smoothly with a nice smooth hops flavor and a bit of alcohol becoming noticeable as it went down my throat; leaving a mixture of sweetness, a very mild hop bitterness, and the alcohol behind. The alcohol is very much present in this beer, but it is very well blended with the other flavors.  Definitely an awesome brown ale.

A lot going on in there. Aftertaste is lightly earthy and bitter.  When the beer warms, the alcohol is more noticeable in the taste. Especially in the aftertaste.

Modest, off white head that dropped fairly quickly, yet a foam ring was retained. Modest, spotty lace.  Smell was interesting for a brown ale. Mildly spicy hoppiness, with a slightly roasty maltiness, along with the usual caramel swetness and a beguiling nutty scent.  Taste was like the scent - much more complex than a typical brown ale, though no individual component of that complexity was terribly dominant. As the sweet caramel & mildly roasty malts hit the taste buds, they are acompanied by a mildly spicy, slightly dry hoppiness that makes a nice contrast. There is a kind of hazelnut taste that lingers in the background. If more brown ales tasted like this, I'd probably drink them more often, and be less bored by them!  Like most brown ales of my acquaintence, this occupies the lighter end of the medium bodied ale spectrum. Carbonation is about normal for the style.  This would make an excellent session beer.

Leafy hops in the finish and aftertaste.  A bit chewy and certainly smooth. Crisp and a bit creamy at the same time. Very nice.  I didn't expect to like this beer as much as I do!

The flavour has a slight tang with an underlying smokiness and spice. There's a woodiness that creeps in near the end. Very nice.

Smells like a brown ale with a note of flavorful hops; hints of balance. Smells include walnuts, something like chocolate but not quite, and smokey tones on the malty side, then some general apricot/hoppy flower stuff on the other. Intriguing.  Tastes like a light porter with a smooth hop undertone. The front is more brown, the back more indian pale...the malt gives it seriously smooth and solid foundation to kick some nice hop FLAVOR, as opposed to bite, into the brew.  Lacing is low, but head retention good. Has bitter, roasted flavors when large gulps are taken, which also brings out a softly lingering roasted malt aftertaste which I enjoy. Reminiscent of Guinness in that regard.  I definitely like it. The approach seems to be opposite of Stone's general kick-you-in-the-face-and-stomp-your-gonads approach to flavor (which I also enjoy immensely) in that this aims for the middle flavor, a gentle balance of malt and hops.

Very strong malt flavors, very dark toffee with coffee aroma. I don't really smell the hops or taste them, but they must be rather strong to offset the strong malt flavor that I typically dislike.

The nose finishes with a light roast note that evokes thoughts of toasted bread and milk chocolate. The taste is sweet up front, and is followed quickly by very fruity notes that are reminiscent of cherries, perhaps even a bit like cough-syrup (though only lightly so). The finish is long, though not heavy handed and has an astringent roast malt character to it. This beer is quite smooth up front, but finishes with a prickle of carbonation that helps to balance the overall sweetness of the malt. The body of this is fairly light, this beer is quite quaffable.

10099,1161,kaszeta,4.8,"Sampled at the 2005 Vermont Brewers Festival  Pours with a very pleasing deep red body and a thick off-white head and light lacing, looking just like a good brown ale. The aroma is primarily caramel and grain, but with noticeably more floral notes from hops than a typical brown.  I was pleasantly pleased by the taste, since like most of the Dogfish products this has a solid (and well rounded) hops kick, but there's still a nice roasted malt flavor, rounded out with some nuttiness. I usually don't expect much from unusual combination beers like this, but they really make this work: the hops combine with the softer malt notes without overwhelming them. Is this one continuously hopped like their IPAs? Seriously, this is one of the best, broadest-spectrum brown ales I've had, it hits all the major tastes (hops, grains, sugars, fruit notes) without any of them overpowering the whole. Mouthfeel also is spot-on, spreading the flavor around, being heavy enough to give the flavor some backing, but light enough to be pleasantly drinkable.

10099,1161,BEERchitect,4.2,"High praise is had all around as Dogfish Head celebrates all of what's brown with a unique dry toasty beer with a heavy hop influence.  With an appearance that looks austerely like porter, the beer lands in that dark bark-brown realm with onyx-like refelection and firm head formation and retention. The medium sand-tan foam laces extremely well and forms the final impressions of a well made ale.  Heavy toast, roasted nuts, rich cold-press coffee, cocoa, and starchy malt begin the aromatic dialogue as the balance of pine, citrus, and grass emit in their hoppy form to counter the dry malt influence.  Burnt molasses, bold roast coffee, bittersweet chocolate, walnuts and malted milkshakes start to form the taste just as the citrusy build up from hops begin. Soon, the sweetness is supplanted by dry bitterness both from char and hops and seem like saw dust, grapefruit, and burnt embers carry the beer into its semi-dry bitter finish.  Medium bodies, the beer's early creaminess is quickly shed and makes way for the lighter mid palate of toast, powder, hops to easily develop with an even fade into dryness, warmth, and quickly closing dark malts.  The American influence on this beer is undeniable- it's much more toasty (almost roasty), it's drier, and much more hoppy (American citrus hops)- all making it easily agreeable for a pairing of medium-well cheeseburgers with sharp cheddar!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Moderately high bitterness but not as much as I'd expect from a Dogfishhead beer with ""Indian"" in the name. Hop flavor is somewhat resinous. Finishes malty and nutty.

Taste is roasted malts, nuts, chocolate, dark fruit and a nice hop kick. The layering is so seamless that I have a hard time isolating flavors before another one shows up.

D- This doesn't really have the hop qualities I would expect and the depth of malt is not that interesting by itself.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,kpantz,3.78,"Executive Summary: Brown Ales aren't really my favorite, but I just might come back to this one.  Appearance: Clean but DARK  almost stout-like. Slight deep-orange hue. Thick head (3 fingers thick) thats not too quick to quit.  Smell: Slightly sweet, but malty.  Taste: Good balance of malt and hops. Can kinda catch the caramelized brown sugar. Slightly bitter finish (in a good way, of course), but nothing like a pale ale.  Mouthfeel: Very smoothnot too much carbonation (which is surprising given the head appearance). Feels great on the back taste buds!  Drinkability: Took a test chug and found that while it tastes great, this one goes down much better when consumed slowly. Not a session brew; rather, a great one to sit back with and watch the tube. 7.2% ABV doesnt really show through  a couple of these and youll feel it!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,battlekow,4.3,"Appearance: Pours a deep, rich brown, pretty much opaque. Head is thick and persistent.  Smell: Smells old and venerable, something to be respected. All the right roasty/toasty aromas are there.  Taste: The first couple sips I swear I got an aftertaste of blood (so strong that I thought I bit my lip). Aside from that, though, this beer is wonderful. A little sweeter than I expected to go along with the roasted nuttiness, with some lingering bitterness that's just perfect.  Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy. Carbonation is perfect.  Drinkability: Exceedingly high. The other five of his friends won't last long.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,santoslhalper,4.22,"Appearence: Pours a nice dark brown with a creamy beige head.  Smell: The smell is a strong mix of coffee, nuts and strong sugar. The roasted notes are brilliant, and the hops add nice complexity.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The flavor is incredible roasted tasting, with extreme porter notes. It's almost like they took a tame Brown Ale and mixed it with a ridiculously robust Porter. The burned chocolate and nut notes are really extreme and almost confusing for a brown ale. It just taste so strong and creamy.  Drinkability and Overall: What a crazy beer!! I don't know if I'd call this a Brown Ale, but whatever the hell you call it, it's quite tasty. The complexity is out of this world, but makes it one hell of a drinkable beer. Definitly a DFH to try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,palma,3.77,"Dark rich looking brown with an amber hue. Not much of a head but a good lace does develop. Wonderful aroma consisting of black malt, coffee and molasses. A smooth nutty flavor at the start. Roasted malt flavor. Though not as rich as the aroma would lead you to believe. Coffee notes and a slight grassiness can be found. A good solid bitterness in the end. A slightly astringent mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good brown ale sporting a hefty ABV.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,TripelJ,3.43,"Now Quaffing: DFH Indian Brown  I remembered really enjoying this beer the first time that I had it, but now that I revisit it, I find it to be a little less memorable. Pours an unclouded ruddy brown with a minimal white head. As the head settles it looks like a glass of cola sitting on my desk. The smell is sweet and slightly grassy. The taste was full compared to other american brown ales, bigger hop presence and more of a burnt roasted bitterness which was nice, but the mouthfeel was a little too thin which made the whole thing seem unbalanced. Worth a try, and something I will revisit every once in a while, but not when there are other, better browns available.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,lackenhauser,3.76,"Poured a deep,coppery red color. No real head to speak of. Low aroma-sweet malt for the most part. Malty flavor upfront. Fair amount of hoppiness to it. Caramel and raisen like sweetness in the finish. Velvety smooth. Nice body to it. A very drinkable brew-another fine product from DFH. Well worth enjoying on a regular basis.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,fizzyfred,4.17,"The color is a rich, dark brown. Looks more like a porter than a brown ale. Little to no head. The aroma is dominated by smell of roasted malt, seems to be a slight floral hop aroma as well. It tastes pretty balanced and heavy. It could almost use some more hop bitterness to take the edge off. It's medium high carbonation is too much, but it is from a bottle. The carbonation may be contributing to the perceived heaviness. Slight alcohol warmness reminds me of a robust porter or imperial stout.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Brian700,4,"This one pours a dark brown color and has a brown head that sticks around for the whole session. It smells of roasty malts, bread, and coffee. It tastes of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate with a little bitter to it. It has a good mouthfeel with medium carbonation. I think this is a great beer. I can't wait to try another one from Dogfish Head. I've been impressed with every one of there brews so far.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,GClarkage,4.31,"04/18/05- Received via trade from connecticuitpoet and steinlifter.  Presentation- 12oz bottle with a bottled in November 2004 on the side label. Poured into my Dead Guy pint glass.  Appearance- Dark brown pour (almost black) with an inch head that partially hangs around until the end of the brew. Great lacing along the sides of my glass.  Smell- Heavy on the roasted malt and a tad sniff of coffee beans.  Taste- This is one heavy bown ale! Massive burnt malt flavor, coffee on the back of my tongue. A bit bitter on the finish.  Mouthfeel- This one is almost thick and sryupy. Very sweet and sticks to the roof of your mouth. Medium carbonation.  Drinkability- This dude is pretty potent. I think I'm happy with one of these at a time. Maybe because of the sweetness and extreme dark flavor. Very good though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Sammy,3.55,"Great colour and lace and promising mollasses and alcohol aroma, but taste was initially sour and then more malty after inducing some spicy food. For the latter, its a quencher. Some burnt carmel, appropriate carbonation. Maybe it works on tap or another day, another meal.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Vipsanius,2.48,"Pours a dark reddish brown with a one inch tan head that dissipates quickly and leaves decent lacing.  The aroma smells like a sweet loaf of whole grain bread.  The initial taste is rather shocking, and not in a pleasant way. There's a distinct burnt coffee-like taste then a wretched, almost fishy, bitterness taste. The finish has an unsweetened chocolate flavor to it. The malts and sweetness are overpowered by these other tastes. Overall, pretty unbalanced.  This one is hard to drink. I'll revisit it later and hope I just got a bad batch (there was no notch on the ""packaged in"" section of the label). Otherwise, I'll be marking this off my list.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,beermanbrian,4.03,Crimson brown color with a thin head. Left some lacing on the glass as the head disipated. Definate aroma of hops mixed with alcohol due to the high ABV. Taste is very smooth for such a high alcohol beer. Has a toasted flavor and is a little sweet. Overall a very nice beer. Will have to make a trip to the brewery soon.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Shaw,4,"Pours a lovely deep ruby color with a thin head. It smells of roasted malt: coffee, chocolate and toasted bread. The taste similarly emphasizes roasted flavors. I think this beer -- happily -- is a bit more bitter than others of the style. There is also a slight sharp flavor in the back end.  The body is smooth and substantial.  Overall this is a good American Brown Ale. My favorite is still Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,whartontallboy,4.1,"Dark brown pour, fairly decent light-brown head that leaves some lace in a pint glass. Smell is roasty malt with lots of chocolate overtones and maybe a little bit of a smoky burnt smell, too. For its ABV, the taste is really, really smooth and malty. Lots of sweetness, but it's not cloying, and the roasty character really shines through; there's a bit of nuttiness to the flavor as well. The hops aren't entirely lost, but there's a pretty solid wall of malt over them. A very drinkable and smooth, not to mention strong, brown ale. One of my favorite DFH brews.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,ecoboy,4.32,"The kind of brew that reminds me that I like it when a brewer has to step up with some unique ways to mask a high alcohol. I found this a wonderful effort from the folks in DE.  The head of a stout on a brew the color of a porter; we're not messing around here: no pussyfooting.  Malty sweet aroma makes the sprightly mouthfeel completely unexpected. Other ways this ain't your average brown: that high abv (which is more a number than anything found in the flavor,) an unusual vinous quality, a dynamite hop presence that makes sure the malty notes have to fight for dominance.  Not a regular brown ale drinker, and I loved it. Highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,twelvsies,4.2,"Not surprised at all by how good this offering from Dogfish Head is. Mostly I go for their IPAs and other stuff but I had this a few times at the Moan and Dove and thought it was great but for some reason never picked up a sixer. Well, tonight was the night, and I'm glad I finally decided to go for the maltier side of Dogfish Head. Appears more ruby red than most standard brown ales, mixed with the traditonal drab brown of course. A bit of white head tops the beer. Smell is creamy and milky, with a touch of bitterness to it. The creamyness comes through in the taste and mouthfeel as well, but the overall taste is much more complex. It has a nice fruityness to it. Dark cherries, ripeness, in addition to the milky creamy flavor. Also, it reminds me of a dark Belgian ale with it's sweet candied sugar taste, which isn't as overwhelming to me as it seems some people have noted. Nice hoppy backbone as well. All of the many tastes in this beer are very well defined and stand out among each other, but also compliment each other. Like I said, I'm not surprised that this beer is as good as it is, coming from one of my fav breweries, but I think I'll be getting it more often now.

Mild malt aromas rise from the glass. The nose has a mixture of malt sweetness and delicate roast malt character. There is a subtle grapefruit rind backing. The taste is neutral. Not too bitter, not too sweet. It is what you would expect. Its dead between a pale ale and a stout having a darker roast character of the latter, and a mild citrus hop bite. The mouth feel is wonderfully smooth, and it has a good drinakbility.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Beertracker,4.02,"Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale pours up big & lacy with an outstanding thick, long lasting lace. Best served cool at cellar temperatures (45-55F) from a logo house pint. Big aromatic and fruity (carmelized pears, Bananas Foster, lemon zest, etc...) nose with lots a candy sweet, nougat-like maltiness. Light hoppiness follows with just a hint of zesty spiciness. The gorgeous ruby-brown body is topped-off nicely by a thick, lacy tannish-white head. Lots of sugary, caramel sweetness upfront fades ever-so slowly to an marked bitterness that helps dry the generous maltiness. The rich caramel/toffee maltiness dominates along with a light unobtrusive toastiness that interplays well with the dried fruit character (e.g. apricots, dates, raisins) and alcohol all the way until the bold, albeit slightly roasty finish. Medium-full body with a very good-excellent creaminess. A really nice strongish ale to enjoy paired with some salty mixed nuts or a good dried fruit trail-mix. Fantastic after a long day's ride!

A sweet brown sugar aroma swirls with dark fruity undertones and lots of alcohol.  Taste: Smooth and sweet roasty malt backbone, but not cloyingly sweet, very balanced hop bitterness comes through midway, with a dry coffee finish. Definitely is warming and very tasty.  Mouthfeel: Full and creamy mouthfeel with a slighty acidic and astringent finish.  Notes: This one is strong, 7.2% ABV is hidden fairly well. Very detectable in the nose, but no solventy or hot fusel alcohol taste.

Crisp nose with roasted grain, sweet burnt brown sugar, nuts and some piney hop tones. Both unique and appealing with sticky patchy lacing.  Big first sip brings a healthy dose of roasty, toasty caramel/brown sugar maltiness...smooth with a nice sweetness. A nice clean hop bitterness hits on the back of the palate and accentuates the flavor nicely. Dark molasses with a hint of fresh baked bread.  Good, full bodied brew that makes itself known on the palate. A tasty brown ale that I could easily have a few of. Another quality DFH brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,krberg,3.25,"Cream head with a deep brown body. Looks very nice.  Smells like freshly milled malt and leather. A little creme brulee? No hops to speak of.  Suprisingly sweet. Molasses and burned sugar. A little hop kick to balance out the malt. Just a hair overboard in my opinion; I like creme brulee. Very boozy for 7.2.  The body feels both thin and thick at different times during the act of swallowing. Thin in the mouth, but thick at the throat. Interesting. I wish it was more full-bodied.  Good for a few, but too boozy tasting for a session.  Overall: A decent beer that is worth trying, but it doesn't satisfy my need for a brown ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Hibernator,4,"I picked up a single of the Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale. Packaged date is clearly notched for August. This beer might be a little past its prime, but should be okay considering its 7.2% ABV and an IPA.  Pours a healthy looking dark brown with chestnut highlights. Thick head that turned into a sticky lacing around the glass.  Aroma of bready and sweet malts with a clean hop background.  A very smooth brown ale that supplies a juicy caramel sweetness. Some sips taste like brown sugar. This is pretty robust and nutty for the the style. There is a solid hop snap presence on the finish that works well in this beer.  An interesting take on a brown ale that shouldn't disappoint.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

The smell is dark chocolate, floral, brown sugar, coffee, light alcohol, malt. Plainly stated its a smooth beer with caramel, a good note of alcohol, roasted malt and nut passing to a crisp, slightly bitter snap at the back and sides of the tongue as a closer. The 7.2 ABV is certainly in the neighborhood and it calls out but it doesnt need a restraining order. The Goldings and the Liberty hops roll right into the aftertaste and they are tempered by a light caramel sweetness. As the beer warmed slightly during consumption it did become a bit sweeter.

I can smell a blend of coffee and vanilla...smells sweet. The taste is a rush of flavor w/ hops up front. This beer is not bitter at all and is extremely refreshing. I would prefer a bit less carbonation...would love to try this one on tap. I can taste roasted malts, coffee, caramel and fig with a slight alcohol taste. The mouthfeel is real nice.

It poured mud brown in color with a finger-width head. The malts were rich and earthy. Very smooth and like milk chocolate, but not overly sweet. I'm thinking more of a coffee ice cream. I could not even notice the alcohol. The hops were present but not overwhelmingly so. Also hints of caramel and hazelnut came through the beer and were present in the aroma.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Complex flavor that contains some coffee, chocolate, nuts, and currant. The alcohol in this beer is extremely noticable, especially towards the end of the beer. It is very smooth drinking, but can be hard to finish near the end of the beer at times. Overall, this is a nice beer, but not shy by any means.

Roasty malt aromas, mix with the big American hop notes, and the brown sugar palyfully darts around in the background.  Truly a big tasting beer.

The taste starts off very good with a nice blast of malt goodness that lets you know its a brown ale. However, unlike others, I noticed the alcohol on the swallow. It had a warming effect, much like a barleywine, but unexpected in a brown ale. Granted, at 7%+ ABV, its not a low ABV beer by any stretch, but I've had 12% beers that masked that alcohol better.

Not much hop activity that I can detect. Taste starts off with soapy clean, brown sugar sweetness, and caramel. Notes of tobacco come through in the middle, and then gets bitter. Its a sharp bitterness thats much needed due to the sweet, opening malts. Finish is bitter with some roasty syrup as well. Big-bodied, almost cloyingly thick in the finish.

The taste is solid; nice mix of unique spices and a grea tmalt taste with a sweet tone as well, I found it hard to grasp what exactly was in here but it was dispersed throughout very well. The mouthfeel is very gentle in my mouth, and the aftertaste is incredible. The drinkability is way up there, could be a session beer, but I would disclaimer it b/c of it's 7.2% abv. which I didn't even slightly notice.

Taste is also complex, a new flavor every sip as it warms. At first, you think it is an English style porter, then it backs off to a flavor all its own. The flavor is chocolate, malt, fruit, and no alcohol, which will sneak up on you, as there is no warning of the high content.

Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale has a rich, almost nutty flavor, and it's more ""substantial"" or ""hefty"" than most beers. Also, with an alcohol content of 7.2%, it will kick your butt if you're not careful! Two 12-ounce bottles will definitely give you a buzz!

10099,1161,nbanman,3.43,"This is my first review, so take with a grain of salt.  Beer served at cellar temp into a pint glass. Beer pours a very dark amber, creating a vigorous head, but not unmanagable. Poured into the glass without too much babying. Head of tiny, pure white bubbles. First whiff has slight hints of raisins and grass. Tastes of raisins, coffee and molasses. It's a spicy beer, though not overly so. Tastes quite alcoholic for 7.2% ABV; I would guess it was more around 8-9%. Initially, other tastes obscured the hops but after a few sips they make themselves apparent. Carbonation is on the high side; I would have preferred it a little less so.  Despite its relatively modest ABV, it's definitely not a session beer. I wouldn't want more than one in a particular evening. Still a pretty good beer. Dogfishhead is one of my favorite breweries, but I've never had this beer before. I'll certainly have it again, though it's not one of my favorites.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,trumick,4.13,"Poured a light brown with a thin head that dissapated slowly. Scent is lightly roasted malt, hops and burned coffee. Taste is of sweet roasted malts, burned coffee and hops. Finishes with a very nice slight hop and burned coffee bitterness and leaves palate dry. Mouthfeel is light with appropriate carbination. Drinkability is good. I could sit and drink a lot of these.  Brown ales are one of my favorite styles. I like the roasted sweetness as long as it is balanced. This one has a nice hop bite to it that I really enjoy. I would put this one at the top of my list of brown ales. I like goose islands, but this one is better.

10099,1161,kmpitz2,4.33,"This beer pours a nice rich brown color that lets enough light through to let you know its not black, but still dark enough to keep me from seeing much more than shapes through it. The head is a finger and a half and light tan that falls to just cover the beer. The nose is caramel and a bit of light mocha. Smells very good. This is a nice tasting beer. There is a good balance between the sweet caramel and chocolate notes in the flavor and the hop that sticks on my tongue. This is immediately my favorite brown ale to date. The beer is thick with just a small carb that makes it drink very easy.

I can't wait to try this beer. Bittersweet chocolate, caramel malt, and overwhelmingly roasted coffee, almost burnt. There is a bitterness, but it's not clear whether it is bitter hops or bitter burnt malt; I think both. Major roasted malt. Strong smell, unlike most beers. Tastes much like it smells. Roasted coffee is up front; malt sweetness takes over and is almost too much. Caramel, chocolate as before. I love it. Hops certainly come in at the finish. Finish is hoppy but not mouth puckering; rather dry and comes to an end, leaving your mouth happy but asking for more. Very light bodied. I wish it were just a little heavier.

Ruby brown in color and very clear with a small but thick, light tan head that remained in some capacity to the end of the glass. The aroma up front was sweet and spicy, with a solid candy-like brown sugar thing happening. I also detected a mild coffee and chocolate thing every now and then. The taste was really interesting... it was very sweet and spicy up front, with a sour fruit tang in the middle and a nice, bitter coffee finish. With a medium to heavy mouthfeel, it was really smooth and almost creamy (whatever that means) with lots of nice carbonation.

The pour had a burnt copper color to it with a small brown head that faded a little quickly. This one is darker than most brown ales I have seen. The complexity of this beer is unreal. Chocolate on the nose with some estery hoppiness. The flavor is caramel upfront with roasted coffee beans around the edges. Earthy hops counteract the caramel sweetness. Chocolatyness and floral hops mix with one another the further I go. Strong fruity alcohol bite in the end. The finish is almost acidic like a coffee finish. Alcohol lingers.

10099,1161,danadeny,3.93,"had this at the Union Bar and Grill in Newton, MA. This is my favorite brown to date. First off, this brown is a little different from other browns in that it has more character, more flavors going on. It does keep some brown characteristics though, mainly it smooth drinkability, and a little of the burntness, but that is covered by the alcohol at the end. It looks black rather than brown, and has a brown head, which faded, but hung around in a thin layer until the end. I couldnt detect anything in particular about the smell, it was quite faint. The first taste sensations are of woody, mustiness. Followed by flowery hops, and then a sweet alcohol finish. I would like to say this is a blend between an IPA in its hop character (floral not bitter) and a brown for it overall character. Very good. I think Todd Alstrom said it best with ""A big yet somewhat humble brown ale, all the flavors and complexities are there but none really want to be dominant....

On the palate it is roasty and coffee bean-like with the telltale coffee fruits of reduced raspberries and blueberries along with black, soily earth. Creamy, steady mousse drives this immensely flavorful beer but it is scarcely medium-bodied.

10099,1161,BuckeyeNation,4.47,"Non-opaque dark brown that becomes dark reddish copper when backlit. The largish head is toasted cocoa in color and looks dense enough and tacky enough to result in better than average lace. And it does; I see a near contiguous sheet on the glass opposite as I drink.  Indian Brown smells like a porter to me, maybe even a light stout. It's redolent of chocolate with a generous smattering of hops and perhaps a whiff of coffee. Without a doubt, the best brown ale nose that I've run across yet.  Massive flavor profile for a brown ale. There's plenty of dark, roasted malt that results in a bittersweet chocolate flavor, hops that do not want to be assigned a supporting role and a pleasant underlying smokiness. Coffee percolates through each mouthful as well. Thanks to the full body and the soft, smooth mouthfeel, the finish is long and satisfying. Amazingly complex and hearty for the style.  Dogfish Head and I did not get off to a great start (Immort Ale), but I have since been extremely impressed with the brewery. I had a very good brown ale a while back (Bell's Best Brown), but Indian Brown noses it out of the top spot. The DFH website describes it as a cross between a Scotch Ale, an IPA and an APA. I'm not too sure about that, but however one chooses to categorize it, this is one well-crafted, delicious beer. Highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Has a nice creamy white head and leaves a nice coating of froth around the pint glass. The malt in this beer is balanced out nicely with the other flavors. Almost has hints of fruit or roasted nuts. The first sip sends your mouth on a ride enjoyable taste of that roasted malt followed by a nice clean feeling with a nice hopped finish. Very pleasent to drink. Has a rather high ABV although not a strong alcohol taste like some stronger beers I have had. No way does this compair to a New Castle. It is far superior to the mass production of that brown ale. I was very pleased with my purchase although the Dogfish head sixers run around $8.00 in CT. Good beer but many others are good and cheaper. Well micro brews at that. I would certainly drink this beer again. My girlfriend really enjoyed it as well. I look forward to the Vermont Brew Festival this weekend. Dogfish head Brewery has joined the event this year.

Im guessing this is due to some decent hopping. The alcohol presence in this beer hovers just below the surface and will occasionally pushes through into the forefront. Hard to pick-up assertive hop characteristic, but they are present as a lightly fruity background taste.

At 7.2% abv there is a warming alcohol presence in the aftertaste, along with the sweet, malted toffee flavors.  An incredibly smooth brown ale considering the abv.

Upon tasting this beer, I noticed a big malt present, and the hops came through really nice. Nice roasted chocolate flavors with an even bitterness throughout. This is a nice beer to just hold in your mouth and let roll araound on your tongue. Actually reminded me more of a porter than a nut brown. Definately a great beer that I will be enjoying more of. At 7.2, this one has the potential to sneak up on you, however.  Note: I'm not really a big fan of Brown Ales. Too many times I am disappointed by the lack of complexity and the often ""watered-down"" taste I get. For intstance, Red Hook and Wild Goose make lousy Brown's, in my opinion.

Taste is a fight between malt and hops that don't seem to get along. Like most DFH, this could use some polishing, but the malt/sugar flavors are what I really love about this beer. There is the light caramel in there pretty strong, along with some roastiness and a hint of peat smoke. Molasses and brown sugar add layers to this and leave it on the sweet side. The hops are very present and could definitely be toned down some, as they detract from the nice malt. No real yeast or fermentation flavors left after the hop vs. malt war.

Initially the beer had a lot of carbonation streamers which died down shortly taking the head with them. There was quite a bit of lace around the glass. The aroma was very Porter-ish, with tones of dark roasted malt, coffee, and alcohol. The taste was nuttier, sweeter, and drier than a Porter with lots of hop bitterness. There was also a good deal of complexity mid palette with hints of licorice, raisins, rum, and caramel. The aftertaste was very dominated by alcohol.

It creates an interesting character, but it keeps it from being a beer that's ""easy"" to enjoy.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is spot on. Good balance, not too syrupy or too light.  Overall: Its character keeps it from being something I could enjoy more than one of at a time.

10099,1161,Mitchster,3.96,"7.2% ABV, 50 IBU. Made with caramelized brown sugar, Liberty and Goldings hops. Described by DFH as ""A cross between a Scotch Ale, an I.P.A, and an American Pale""  Pours out to a clear, very dark ruby-brown, forming a very large whipped light-tan head atop small bubbles. Retention is superior, and lacing is clumping. The head is peaking and carbonation is very firm, giving a solid ""Psssht"" upon releasing the cap. Aroma is inviting with strong notes of brown sugar and milk chocolate, vanilla, toffee and caramel. There is a suggestion of alcohol in the nose. Mouthfeel is syrupy, yet bright with carbonation, and has a medium-dense body. Tasting more like an Abbey Double than a brown ale (in part due to the judicious use of brown sugar), the flavor echoes the aroma with a discrete hop presence (which is overshadowed by the syrupy malts). The subtle bitterness becomes noteable in the toasty, yet woodsy finish. Thankfully, I'm not upset by the small amount of diacetyl present, unlike the Shelter Pale Ale which was disturbing. No smoke or peat, though I'm picking up on some subtle bilious sourness. The alcohol esters are easily perceptable in flavor, and unfortunately increase as it warms, giving it an amateur homebrew twang that I'm not partial to. As the beer breathes, the toast in the finish evolves, and the spritzy mouthfeel softens. The bitterness interweaves perfectly with the toast, leaving a satisfying composure.  Rough around the edges, yet still a quite interesting brew which seems to cross boundries of style. The funky alcohol esters don't ruin the beer for me, but they do limit it's likability.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,farHillsBrewer,4.25,"Satisfying in all categories. Pours a deep brown with a slight reddish hue. A creamy off-white head that laced the glass well, signifying the ample hop content. Rich caramel and hazelnut flavor notes underlying a smooth malty profile. Tasted sweet with a chewy mouthfeel that transforms into a tangy, nutty hoppiness at the finish. The alchohol is up there but is sneaks right by. A nice compliment to corn beef and cabbage on St Patty's day.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,CBFanWish,4.15,"Dogfish Head has never let me down. The Indian Brown Ale is almost as good as any beer out there. It pours what looks to be dark brown, but in the light, it's a deep blood red. The head, a thick creamy, frothy cloud. Beautiful. The aroma is sweet with hints of chocolate and carmelized brown sugar. The taste is of caramel with a nice dose of hops mixed in. This is a great beer. I will be back to the store this weeken to buy some more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,PSUDREW,3.82,"Pours a very dark ruby/ brown. It has a nice balanced feel to it, little head and very little lace. Highly quaffable, and very drinkable for a Scottish Ale. There is a definite hop presence through and through this Ale, and it mixes very nicely with the malt background. It has a smokey carmel/coffe flavor throughout the drink, which mixes with both the hop and malt aspects of this beer. While it may seem very heavy upon the first couple of samplings, it comes out balanced and highly drinkable. DFH boys have constructed a mighty fine brew here and this may have possibly been one of the better conversion brews available on the market today.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,FormatKid,4.3,"Picked this up in a 12oz bottle from Bacchus in Chattanooga. It was a nice suprise to find out he carried something from my home state when I feel so far from home sometimes.  Pours a deep, dark brown. Immediately a thick, bubbly, tan head erupts about three fingers high. The head reminds me of a bowl of oatmeal in its consistency. Lacing slides lazily down the sides of the glass and clumps up sporadically about the glass. Upon holding it up to the light a more amberish brown shines through, but it holds its darkness well.  The smell is great. The malts are immediately present, I pick up toasted coffee, and caramel. The bitter edge of hops sits there faintly as well.  The first thing I notice as I imbibe is just how creamy the mouthfeel is. It feels awesome going down, and works perfectly with the taste. The taste leads in bitter and then to sweet and caramel coated, bitter chocolate flirting at the edges. Slightly toasty background and just the absolutely faintest alcohol after-taste is present. This beer hides its ABV well, I have a bigger case of the warm and fuzzies than I would expect after just one. Then again it is the middle of the day and I have an empty stomach.  I have to say I really look forward to trying this one again, and would absolutely LOVE to find it on tap somewhere. To be honest if I had one or two more laying around I'd probably have another. As this is both my first beer from both Dogfish Head and my first of the Brown Ale style I have to say it made a great impression.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,silenius,3.72,"I had this at the Real Ale fest in Chicago.  This beer pours a translucent reddish brown with head that looks odd with large bubbles.  It smells like chocolate covered coffee beans with a hint of root beer in the way back.  The taste is very similar to the nose, except the root beer note is now front and center. I enjoyed this change of pace for the night, but I do not think this style is for me over the long haul. I could have more than one, but I might end up choosing an alternate beer for my next if given a choice.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,TheJudge,3.06,"This brown ale poured a nice rich color, with a very thin head which did not last past the first sip or two. The first thing I noticed as I went to drink it was a sourish smell, something that you sometimes get with barleywines, and something that I wasn't ready for in a brown ale. Probably due to the relatively high alcohol content. This taste carried into the mouth as well. It didn't help it. Thinking that perhaps it was a bad bottle, I poured another. Although this one seemed slightly smoother, it was basically the same. If I see it on tap somewhere, I will have it again, just to be sure it wasn't me. But this is not beer that you can sit and have 5 or 6 of.  I thought that I would like this more. Maybe I just didn't get a good batch.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Bierguy5,3.82,"Pours a medium to dark brown liquid with a beige foamy head. Try as I might, I could not even manage 1 finger of head. The small amount head that was present, disappeared rather quickly. There is very little lace on the sides of the glass. Ok, not impressive so far. Smells of toasted, almost a roasted malt. Taste is very nice, slightly buttery but a nice toasted malt flavor, with a dry subtle amount of hops. This is a good tasting brew. Mouthfeel was medium, which is nice. A bit higher in alcohol which is slightly noticable. I could drink several of these. Another solid brew from DFH. It can sometimes be hard to get excited about a brown ale, but this is one worth trying.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,jahred,3.23,"Tried this at the Feb. Goose Island ""Beer Academy.""  Pours a dark brownish red color with a small-sized white head. There's an odd, bitter vinegary scent that I can't quite place. The taste initially is bitter, chalky and stout-like. I definitely couldn't find any sweetness in this beer. There's also a very slight hint of coffee and/or espresso flavors.  The alcohol makes its presence known right away, but otherwise there are no dominating or exciting flavors in this beer, which was kind of disappointing (I was expecting more from DFH).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,BierReise,3.4,Finally DFH is available in Florida! This one poured a deep mahogany brown with a fairly good size head that has some staying power. Aroma is a nutty malty one with a slight roastiness and a bit of yeast as well. Body is medium and very smooth. Flavor is lacking a bit. Some roasted malt but no sign of brown sugar detected. Alcohol is well masked. A tad too bitter also. Overall a fair brew yet not something I'd drink on a regular basis.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Rastacouere,3.33,"Here's a brown ale that doesn't particularly impress me. Appearance is medium with a sticky head that is thin as a film from the beginning, not quite what I look for in a beer of this type. Aroma is hops and chocolate. The taste is very malty, quite chocolate and toffee sweet, but plenty of balancing hop character keeps it off being cloying. 7.2% ABV is to be found nowhere. The medium body is pretty good and fitting as well. Still, I must say I'd have prefered a more intense aroma. I also found it less and less interesting after each sip, perhaps the balance is not so good after all. It remains stylish and original like any Dogfish, but it's definitely not one of their best. Thank you Egajdzis",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,UnionMade,4.23,"The beer is a deep, dark, nutty brown, topped with a thick bone white froth. Great head retention, keeping more or less steady through the entire 23oz mug, leaving a think film of belgian lace all the way through. Very impressive. Good clarity, with just a touch of a chill haze. Some bubbles meander their way up, slow and lazy-like. The aroma is very odd. I'm not sure if I've smelled anything like this before. Perhaps Ipswich's Dark Ale comes close. Smoothly blended aromas, with moderate biscuit and chocolatey malt balanced by an impressively aggressive hopping. Earthy, with a slightly citric aroma. Some british varieties? A bit of apple and pear fruitiness wafts up, along with a vague brown ale nuttiness, adding to the complexity. Distinctly british feeling, with an american twist. Brown ale for hop heads? The flavor starts with a pleasant chocolate malt, mildly roasty with some caramel sweetness. A hint of coffee flavor, with light floral and apple esters settling on the top of the tongue, adding a pleasant fruity sweetness. Bold hopping takes up the finish, slightly oily and grapefruity, with plenty of citric and herbal flavor. A bit of earthy hopping is accentuated by malty brown ale nuttiness. The chocolate malt flavor continues through, standing up against the hops to present some malt in the finish. Some grapefruity hops and a bit of roasty malt washes into the aftertaste. Impressively smooth, despite the strong hopping. Definitely easy drinking, with no alcohol presence that I could perceive. Medium bodied, with mellow carbonation and a pleasantly smooth mouthfeel. I had no idea what I was getting into when I ordered this, and it certainly snuck up on me after 46 ounces. A mix of brown ale and IPA? Who'da thunk.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Well anyway, this beer poured out a deep brown color with a nice head that went away quickly. In a way, it almost looks like a light porter. Smell consists of hops at first and some bitter chocolate. Taste is really nice. Some hops hit you at first then some caramel and bitter chocolate finishes the brew. Even some roasted flavors filter in the aftertaste. Gotta becareful with this brew, 7.2% is to laugh at and could probably down a few of these, but it might get to you. A very solid brew from Dogfish Head.

10099,1161,ngandhi,3.85,"This one's a tear-jerker. The 50 IBUs come off as more intense than they actually are and I don't know if that's because they are or because you wouldn't expect so much bitterness in a brown ale. The Liberty and Goldings contribute an aggressive but very clean bittering that goes well with the malt and added sugars.  This is a pale ale with dark malts added to it (instead of a hoppy dark beer) on the palette, a robust brown ale on the mouthfeel, and a clean British mild on the nose. Though quite complex, the alcohol shines through a little too loudly on this beer and lends a metallic note to the nose and palette. The flavors fail to develop into anything past the alcohols, but the rich cocoa, molasses, and British hops up front are gorgeous. Muted yeast on the finish.  Characteristically a brown ale and a pale at the same time, Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale leaves me with but one recurring thought in my head:  ""Damn it feels good to be a gangsta . . .""

A very different, and tasty brown ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,GreatPondBrewer,3.63,"$5 pitchers at MacGregor's. Poured a deep brown hue with garnet splashes towards the bottom. There were huge notes of bannana and clove which was a very odd surprise. The taste had more subdued notes of this with a more smokey, oaky notes and dry fruits and a more substantial espresso profile. The hops could be detected only in the good burp afterwards. The alcohol was easier to detect in the nose than in the taste. Except for the more complex profile of an ale yeast this beer reminded me of a decent doppelbock. Very odd, but it gets high drinkability ratings because it is so cheap.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,GreenWBush,3.35,"12 oz bottle, $1.79. Singled out at #1 Big Red Liquors in Bloomington, Indiana.  This beer pours out a classic English brown-ale brown and has a small 1/8"" dirty white head. There is a mildly hoppy nose here, but more than hops I am encountered by maple syrup, carmel, and roasted malts.  This beer tastes like a well-balanced brown ale taken up in scale about 25%. It isn't overwhelmingly hoppy or malty, but has an ""averagely large"" profile. I am amazed by the magically-hidden ABV. Still, it isn't anything impressinging coming from the shockers at Dogfish Head.  I also couldn't shake a strange garbage-water flavor somewhere in there. This beer also has a watery mouthfeel that left me bummed.  This one is decent but unspectacular. If you love brown ales, it is a must try. If you are a huge-beer fan, or love Dogfish Head's over-the-top nature, you'll probably like this one. But it ain't world-shaking.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

The malts are most noticeable in the aroma, but I can smell the hops lurking around back there. I swear they tossed in some coffee and chocolate for good measure. Let me taste. They did. This is like a light porter, with a touch of smoky nuts and some espresso. It takes a while for the hops to become evident; they are definately in the background. Very balanced mouthfeel. A good choice.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Indian Brown Ale had a clear, dark chocolate brown color and a frothy ¾ beige head that quickly dwindled to a bubbly skim and left virtually no lace. This brew has a hefty malt nose, with a touch of caramelized sugar, some aromatic hops and a hint of alcohol. It started with a big malt presence; lots of roasted malt. Backing the malts were flavors of dark fruit and brown sugar. As it hit the back of the tongue, a spicy hops bite rose up and a light alcohol taste coated the palate as the beer went down. The hops were nicely assertive and complemented the robust malt taste. The feel was medium-bodied, smooth and dry. Indian Brown Ale certainly packs a strong and diverse flavor profile, each doing its part to blend well with the other. Theres no animosity between the malt and hops here, just a nice balance as Ive come to expect from DFH. Worth a try if you can get it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Bitter hops, burnt spice, and a grain huskiness dries the finish. A brown on the sweeter side, not to mention a nice alcohol glow. Mouthfeel: Full bodied (almost chewy for a brown), lightly carbonated and warming. Drinkability: A nice brown with the characteristic DFH ABV kick.

This big 7.2 ABV Brown Ale left a film on the inside of my glass, too.  Smell  This smells like a stout. The big coffee and chocolate aroma is laced with brown sugar, roasted malts, and a bit of caramel.  Taste  Again, the giant coffee and chocolate tastes dominate. Theres a nice hop balance in there as well.  Mouthfeel  Quite creamy and smooth for such a big ale. Its on the fuller side of medium-bodied and hides the high ABV well.

One heluva brown ale here. I can only take so much of the sweet malts though, so drinkability limits this to a ""one or two"" type of beer.

Flavor is a sandy and dusty brown malt followed by a sharp hop hop bite that rises as the malt fades into the background.

Aroma starts out surprisingly floral but evolves into a caramelized sugar and toasted malt scent. Hits the tongue with a wash of sweet malt, brown sugar, molasses, and chocolate. Delicate hops join in to keep them in check. Tastes warm into a more roasted malt flavor and leave you with a fantastic toasted bread and slightly fruity aftertaste.

Begins roasty and nearly stout-like with its dry coffee expressions. Begins to sweeten, especially as it warms. The brown sugar DFH uses is very evident. Huge swells of it, in fact. Not overly sweet, however, as this maintains enough of a roasty, toasty parchedness to keep things on the even keel. The liberal Golding herbal bitterness helps too. More chocolate later on, with some dulce de leche flavorings to boot. Ends with the aforementioned Golding burst, with a minor grape/brandy alcohol flourish. Full and feathered through the mouth and through the pipe. This is a brown ale taken to the next level.

This highly drinkable brown ale is maybe the best of the best, and I am a huge fan of brown ales.  This past May my girlfriend and I visited DFH in DE, and, after sampling just about everthing on tap, I left with a growler of the Indian Brown Ale (and a bottle of 120 Minute).

But one thing you can usually count on from DFH is a big-tasting beer. Well, this beer was a surprise. It ain't wimpy, mind you. But it's not the mammoth, over-the-top flavor that I'm used to from the guys at DFH. Pours very dark brown, just this side of opaque, with a very thin top. The first scent to hit you is a roasty, just slightly nutty malt aroma, but as the beer warms this quickly develops into an herbal, leafy hop boquet. The flavor is very well-rounded -- sweet and malty, a bit reminiscent of hazelnut in the main body, with a assertively hopped finish that lends a nice balance to the beer and leaves a tingly aftertaste on your tongue.

10099,1161,aracauna,4.16,"I was surprised at the reserved nature of this beer. Don't get me wrong, it's an excellent brown ale, but I was expecting something over the top from Dogfish Head. Actually, I guess a 7.2% brown ale is over the top, but you can't taste it. Alcohol is nowhere to be found in the aroma or flavor. The body is a nice clear rubied leather. The cream-colored head is thick and slow to subside. Nice texture. The aroma has a bit of chocolate and toffee, really malty with a slight hop bite underneath. The flavor is the same way, smooth creamy malts, a bit sweet, but the hops are present just enough to cut through the sweetness and leave this a very drinkable but still flavorful brown. The body is surprisingly thin given the alcohol content and huge maltiness of the flavor. Must be the brown sugar.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Hop notes and alcohol become more apparent towards mid-glass and the finish is lingering and a bit astringent. Medium-full body and tingling carbonation make for a nice combonation.

Aromas are of fresh roasted coffee bean and some bittersweet chocolate. Ditto in the mouth. Reminds me of visiting the Valhrona chocolate factory. Lot's of dusty dark chocolate undertones-nicely bittersweet, with espresso notes on the finish. This is really an enjoyable beer with nice richess, yet not a highly ""drinkable"" brew.

Indian Brown ale refuses to be transparent, rather absorbing light from every angle, like a black hole. What it loses in head it makes up for in ominous crimson darkeness.

The smell is weak. Nutty with a slight chocolate. A weak coffee scent as well. I swirled many times to try to get some scent it just was not forthcoming.  The flavors are big burnt toast at first. Heavy nuts and a mild fruit finish. I would give the flavor more points if they flavor took me somewhere. It is just all over the place.  The mouthfeel is oily. It goes down as if to say where have I been? Nothing wants to stand out. It is just peaking through.

10099,1161,taez555,4.1,"This beer poured a very small tan head with a dark reddish/brown body.  The nose was a sweet malty smell, with very light hints of smoke. Hinting almost at a very subdued scotch ale.  The taste was pure brown sugar, caramel and even some molases. Firm up front malt flavor. Chewy and medium bodied. Slight hints of smoke lingered in the background.  The hops are present in this beer but deffiantly take a back seat to the malt. Very even bitterness and a very interesting use of the hops as flavoring. They never once step on any of the other flavors. It's as if they put a filter on all the bitterness and just left the hop flavor. Very interesting indeed.  Overall it's a very interesting hybrid of styles. Not quite a Brown Ale, not quite a scotch ale, and only hinting at an IPA. But deffinatly a unique beer worth trying.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Pleasant and inviting nose, there is plenty of depth with the chocolate malts and milky sweetness. An initial big alcohol bite crushes the palate the chocolate malts follow quickly then in the wake comes a minor flash of milky sweetness and herbal hops as the finish nears the smoothness of the carbonation eases the malts back into play. Just bitter enough. Overall the flavor profile is big, complex, well-constructed and very drinkable the high abv is thoroughly in play. Tasty! The aftertaste is largely sweet and tacky with faint hints of chalkiness. Medium-bodied (and smooth). This is one hell of a robust brown ale I suppose it was foolish of me to think DFH would make a typical brown ale Id recommend you trying one!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91

Most noted difference was the appearance, in my opinion it was significantly darker. In fact when I saw it I initially thought it was a stout or porter.

Finish - Bitter, sharp and quite dry. Mouthfeel - Medium dense, slick and a bit creamy, with medium tight carbonation.  This is a very ""large"" brown ale, filling nicely a starting position in DFH's lineup of big beers. This bad boy is practically bursting with heaps of dark flavors (brown breads, figs, etc). Pretty well hopped (English variety) as well, which adds to the flavor assault and quite roasted, more so then a lot of browns. Has a real warming quality as well as the alcohol creeps into the overall taste.. This is the kind of beer a lot of Non BA's wouldn't like a little bit, and that is not a knock on this beer.

It had a good dark brown color that was a little darker than I wanted with a large amount of head the died slowly as the drinking went on. It was nicley hopped with a crisp aroma to it that didn't quite match the flavor (I can't explain it but when I drank it, I got a completely different flavor than I was expecting based on the smell).

I have a feeling it is not brand new; hops are muted, barely noticeable which goes against the beer's description of itself as well as other reviewers. Still tasty, and perhaps more of a traditional brown ale as a result. Sweet and sugary, with some tartness from the brown sugar. Much darker than an average brown ale, looking more like a porter with some faint reddish-brown mud at the edges. Head virtually disappears. Mouthfeel thick and sticky. A nice beer to have after being out in the rain, but mostly I am grumbling about how tough it is to find fresh beer around here. (I settled for this beer of indeterminate age after negging my 1st choice, Brooklyn Brown, of which the freshest sample had a drink by date of 2/02!!!

Taste is of bitter burnt malt, hops bitter, and hints of sweet molasses. Flavor is almost a porter flavor. The hop and burnt malt bitter lingers in the mouth.

It produced a medium tan colored head that was fairly thin about ½ thick, but seemed somewhat sticky. It lasted a good way through the glass and produced a sheety lace a good way down then started to separate into patches near the end. The aromas that came from the glass were of roasted malt, brown sugar, roasted barley grains, some chocolate, dark fruit and some alcohol. More roasted malt and barley as it warmed. The tastes that rolled across my tongue were of roasted barley grains, floral hops, dark malt (slight roast), earth tones, chocolate, nuts, baked brown sugar, light dark fruits, and a bit of alcohol. The flavors seemed to be pretty stable as it warmed, no real flavor took over. It left a roasted grain/hop taste behind on the tongue. Medium bodied. To me, this beer seemed to have sweet notes that wanted to come out but were quickly masked by the roasted flavors. This is a clean beer and well crafted. It is an all around smooth taste.

Taste - snappy, malty flavor, primary coffee presence. A moderate carbonation level sets up a most pleasing hop taste which lingers and blends well with a charcoal and coffee aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - very smooth and silky thanks to high alcohol and the chocolate malts.  Drinkability - this is a wonderful ale with lots of complexity.

Slightly creamy mouthfeel, round and clean, clear-tasting and refreshing, with an aftertaste of slightly sour hops, edged with sweet malt.

Taste was lightly sour, light roasted malt, and a tasty moderate strength hops  not too salty, bitter, or oily, just verdant. Altogether a very clean tasting brew, though came across as a little watery too. Mouthfeel was thin and watery, yet the finish was long and left a soft dry cover over my whole palate.  A decent brown. The dry hopping gave a great clean & fresh whole-hop smell and taste. Couldnt tell what cask did, since no oakiness or other cask-imparted characteristics popped up.

As the bottle describes there are some aromatic barley coming to play here along with the caramalized brown sugar really smells great in the background of the aroma. Taste is very complex, the Liberty and Goldings are pulling their weight in the bittering department. While each sip the dark roasts, hops, and nice warming bite of alcohol blend together smoother and smoother. Very good beer and getting even better as it warms up a little. Leaves the tongue with a comforting dryness making me yearn for the next sip to let all of the flavors splash over my palate once more. A medium body with nice full mouthfeel to it, carries all of the flavor going on here very well.

This ale was dark brown in the glass, with hints of red coloring along the sides. Thin head, with average retention, dwindling to very little by the end. The smell had roasted qualities with a caramel-like odor. Subtle hops and some spices were also present. A fruity odor also complemented the overall smell. I tasted the strong bitterness at first, but the caramel flavor came through with the roasted qualities. A nice hop presence was overcome by the sweetness of the brown sugar. This was a little too sweet for my taste, and it stuck in my mouth long after the swallow. The medium body had a somewhat creamy mouthfeel...more of what I expected from the brown ale.

If has a wonderfully full mouthfeel and good drinkability for a beer of its alcohol content.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,maxpower,4,"Deep brown color, small light brown head, has a sweet malty roasted nutty aroma, sweet malty caremel and nutty flavor, some hops noticable in the finish. I don't care for brown ale, medium body and mouthfeel, I really bon't care for the brown ales,but I love this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,aaronh,4.16,"This chestnut brown beer pours with a medium tan head that displays excellent retention. As it slowly fades, it leaves behind a layer of film that hints at maltiness in the beer. It also leaves more of a sheeting than a lace on the glass sides. The aroma is nutty, with a quality I can't quite pinpoint. Almost like a chocolate malted milkshake. Very little hops going on there. The flavor is strong on roasted malt, with some very evident chocolate notes. A bit of english walnut slides in as well. Alcohol is very apparent on the finish, as is strong roasted coffee notes. Very flavorful and powerful for a brown. A bit of bitterness is also there, but it seems more like coffee bitterness than hops. The sweetness seems to come from the alcohol, but there is a big malt background to back this beer. It feels very full on the tongue, but not a smooth as some browns. The alcohol notes in the aftertaste detract from the drinkability, but otherwise it is truly enjoyable. A very nice, robust brown ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,ElGuapo,4.2,"a dark brown with an off white head. sticky lace will be all over your glass in the end. smells of caramel, coffee, and sweet malts come out at you.  the beer is very roasty. i did not expect this at all out of a brown, but it was very welcomed. lots of coffee flavors, and the caramel and brown sugar that was put in is definitely noticeable as you get a nice sweet taste toward the end right before the hint of alcohol. the alcohol was not too powerful at all which was very good. i also found a nice hop mix in this beer. it has a lot of complexity, and it is very enjoyable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,TheLongBeachBum,4.15,"A tan-brown head forms quickly as the dark brown beer is poured from the Bottle, eventually culminating into a 2 deep head that laces the Glass walls as it rescinds slowly. The body of the beer is a very clear, dark brown color with a fantastic deep red mahogany tint when backlit. It looks great. Aromas are strong, roast malt, burnt caramalized brown sugars mixed with the hops. The tastes at the start reinforced the signals my brain received from my eyes which were staring at the label. Yes this is definitely 7.2% ABV. Alcohol is prevalent at the beginning and in the mouthfeel though not to any warming extent. The roast malt soon comes through which takes the edge off of the initial alcoholic tones, this is slowly drenched in burnt brown sugar caramel tastes reminiscent of dark toffee sold around Bonfire Night in England. Slow dry bitterness that increases in strength, as the finish lingers with a burnt taste on the tongue. The hop bitterness in the end is high for such a dark beer. A very clever interpretation of what happens when you mix an IPA and a Brown Ale  something different, quite unusual, but that is of undoubtedly high quality. Quite drinkable despite its strength. Probably best drunk after a meal, or late on a cold night.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,IrishRedRock,4,"Deep brown with a nice aroma of caramel and coffee. Excellent hoppy flavor with hints of sweetness, burnt toffee, and a mild alcohol effect towards the back. Slick and smooth mouthfeel. Definitely the best of the 4 in the sampler pack. A tasty brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,ADR,4.02,"Clear deep brown color, slight chill haze. Smallish 1/4 inch head of medium duration, leaves simple laces. Intense malty aroma with some distinct hoppy notes, as well. Nice medium mouthfeel, enhanced by moderate carbonation. Good sense of caramel and toasted bread to the flavor, with a sense of spicy sass. The hop balance is outstanding, not overt but present as a stand out feature compared to many Brown Ales that lie rather flat. Not a seminal beer but a very good and more interesting Brown from Dogfish, lots of uncharacteristic aftertaste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,MJR,4.07,"Appearance: Pours a clear, medium brown with garnet highlights. A creamy, light tan head sits on top, but doesn't last too long.  Smell: Caramel and brown sugar are the strongest scents. There's a fair amount of hop aroma too. A touch of floral spiciness to a lesser extent.  Taste: Again, caramel and brown sugar take over. A bit of molasses too. A lot of sweet malt flavor here. I'm not picking up on as much hop flavor as I expected. Finishes with hop bitterness and an alcohol note. Very tasty!  Mouthfeel: Has a nice, medium mouthfeel that is a touch more to the oily side, rather than dry.  Drinkability: While this is quite the kick-a*s brew, I can't see myself putting more than a few of these away, with the high alcohol and cloying sweetness. This would make a great dessert beer...maybe alongside a slice of pecan pie!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,MaineBeerMan,4.23,"This beer poured a very dark brown with a thick tan head that makes it look more like a stout or porter than a brown ale. Very hoppy aroma, rather floral, with a good amount of toasted and caramel malt smell to it as well. Medium to full bodied, and full of complex malt flavors, dark bread, some coffee and bitter chocolate flavors are present, with a good amount of burnt character seeming to be dominant. Surprisingly little floral and fruity hop flavors considering how much they stick out in the aroma. Very tasty and drinkable beer, though it seems more like a porter than a brown. Definitely well worth drinking again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,OatmattStout,3.68,"This is a different style brown ale to me. Not your mellow normal, malty, semi sweet, but a much more hopped sharp version. The beer poured well with a nice rocky head. It has and tart hoppy smell. The flavor is good but a little to hoppy for me, but good though. It has a great mouthfeel, very rich to tounge but not heavy, like they used real good ingredients. As the beer warmed in glass it got better and hop's seemed to mellow and blend in better so don't drink to cold.  All in all a good beer if you like a ""well-hoped"" as described on bottle, brown ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,QXSTER1,4.15,I've tried a few Dogfish brews lately and this one stands out. Mine was dark brown with a bit of a chill haze that didn't detract from the appearance. Head was adequate with some nice lacing. Strong point was the great mouthfeel due to the spot on carbonation and the residual sugar caramel notes. Big malt with some noble hop bitterness made for a really tasty brew. Finish was long with the sweetness lingering and then dried out by the hops. Very nice.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,purplehops,4.35,A very nice surprise for a brown ale. The caramelized sugars and malts give a nice body and mouthfeel to this ale as well as a deep brown/red color. The Liberty hops come through in the finish to compliment the warmth of the alcohol.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,kunzbrew,3.85,A nice brown to dark copper color with white creamy head that sticks around for a while. Leaves a lace that is rather sexy. The carmalized malt and barley with a strong bittering hops taste that sticks around as an aftertaste.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,NeroFiddled,4.32,"Very dark reddish brown with a lightly creamy head that has fair retention and keeps a light surface covering throughout the serving. The aroma is bold, with dark chocolatey malt and bright Goldings hops. The body is medium with a very fine, restrained carbonation that leaves the mouthfeel lightly creamy and smooth. The flavor is quite rich with a lightly acidic and fruity bittersweet chocolate maltiness, and sharp, hoppy flavors. The bitterness plays a supporting role to the dark, sugary maltiness. The alcohol is somewhat noticeable, but not intrusive. It finishes semi-dry with a lingering sweet malt and bitterness. Although it builds upon the palate, which limits it's drinkability, it's still quite enjoyable. Interesting and somewhat complex.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,marc77,4.47,"Dark brown in hue, topped by a light tan sticky head that leaves attractive lace. The highly appetizing aroma is of sweet milk chocolate, smooth roasted malt, dark caramel and a light floral Goldings hop nose. The taste follows the aroma wonderfully-- chocolate flavors abound, while the roasted sharpness of black patent is held to minimum. Carob and butterscotch become noticeable as the beer warms. Hop bitterness supports malt adequately but is not centerstage in this brown ale. The carbonation is perfect, and when coupled w/ the full body, the mouthfeel is smooth, dextrinous and highly enjoyable. Finishes with a simple extension of the chocolately malt flavors. Smooth from start to finish and very tasty. The best brown ale I've had. The depth of chocolate malt flavor is striking. Tremendously drinkable for a relatively high ABV brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,beernut7,4,This is one of the most unique beers available in these here parts. Nice deep brown color with a sweet malty aroma. Good amount of bitterness to balance out the malts with a new and special flavor combination that is its own style. Alcohol content apparent in the finish. Great BBQ brew.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,frank4sail,4.23,"A very American Brown Ale in style ... Dark ruby color with light brown head. The head is lasting with beige lace. Sweet nose with lots of malt and hints of fruit. This is hands down the best looking brown I have had. Very complex sweet/hoppy flavor followed by a clean dry alcohol finish. But, you are not overwhelmed by the 7.2% ABV.. this does effect drinkability a little ... Dogfish Head just brews good beer, period! April 2002 Batch.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,John,4.28,"Deep ruby-brown color. Thick tan head, impressive Brussels lace. Sweet rolls, molasses and dark chocolate aroma. Taste is sweet, typical of a brown. Malt is substantial. This is a hearty ale. Starts hoppy, finishes full bodied and sweet. A fine brown ale. 12oz. bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,mophie,4.16,"Dark brown, ruby appearance, with a rather nice foamy off-white head. When cold, the aroma is a bit metallic and floral, but after warming up a bit the smells become quite a bit more complex (chocolate, spiced apples). The taste is trademark Dogfish Head hop tang, balanced with a bit of malty sweetness. Strong alcohol in the nose, but not so much in the taste. Definitely different, and complex; unlike any other brown ale out there!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Brent,4,"As other BA's before me have noted, this is a brown ale that marches to the beat of a different drummer. Malty with caramel notes, yet rather surprisingly not sweet. More hops than one normally encounters in a brown ale. This beer seems to occupy a category all its own - ""robust brown ale""",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,inebrius,4.12,"Brown ale? Perhaps, but unlike any brown I've had. Serious chocolate caramel nose with wisps of currant and well subdued hop. Alcohol is more perceptible in your head than on your tongue. Sugary malt start ends hop bitter and fruity. Well crafted fireside brew.  Cheers to frank4sail for the sample.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Murph,4.7,"Pours a nice brown color with a thick, creamy off white head that fades too quickly. The smell is of caramel malt, light hop bitterness and slight alcohol. This is by far the most flavorful and complex brown I have ever had. The first tastes to arrive on the scene are the caramel and chocolate sweetness which are quickly subdued into perfect balance by earthy hop flavors. The beer is incredibly smooth and goes down exceptionally easy, especially when you consider that it is 7.2 %. There is only the slightest hint of alcohol in the taste of this beer. Not so much even a taste as just feeling the warming effects. Yet another amazing brew from Dogfish Head. This would be the perfect beer for a cool autumn night.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,beerluvr,4.47,"This one's a little off-beat. It pours a nice average tan head, not too foamy, attractive reddish-brown color. Nose is slightly malty-roasty-sweet...first taste is a little vague, what exactly is it? Brown ale-ish? Or a hoppy Porter-like beer? Well after 4 I still dunno! I'll tell you this though, I love it! Dryness from the hops definately makes it's presence known, doesn't taste like a 7.2% beer. I enjoy just about every beer they make, this is no exception.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Bighuge,4.3,"Dark Ruby color. As dark as many stouts and porters. Thin laced off-white head. Nice roasted, chocolate aroma. Taste is really nice. Subtle roast tones and bittersweet chocolate mix. Almost like a stout. I would never guess this beer was 7.2% a/v. No sign of alcohol here. Creamy mouthfeel. Nice hop accents that don't overwhelm. Like Chinook maybe (just a guess). This is really an interesting Brown. At times it tastes like stout and at times it tastes like porter. It doesn't taste like many brown ales that I have had, but that is not a bad point being that I find Brown Ales are usually pretty bland. This is a quality brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,ZAP,4,"Dark brown in color...big fruity aroma....pretty interesting taste, starting with heavy chocolate syrup, with some maple undertones...some fruitiness....some caramel...for a brown ale this one is packed with flavor...and pretty balanced too...I do get some alcohol on the buds but it is over 7% which is pretty high for a brown ale I think...  Changed the review on a second tasting...the moutfeel is better than I originally wrote..plus I'm really digging this taste..getting a little brown sugar now...very tasty..",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Jason,4.25,"Presentation: 12 oz brown long neck bottle with &#8220;Packaged In&#8221; date on the side of the label.  Appearance: Deep brown bordering black, tiny bubbled but foamy head that stays strong and does not want to go anywhere.  Smell: Herbal and floral hop aroma on top of an unsweetened chocolate and caramelized sugar that some close to a light molasses. Touch of alcoholic esters and dark fruity undertones are detected.  Taste: Fiercely smooth with a layer and complex mouth feel of the medium body. Intricate within the malt flavours ranging from burnt sugar to light roasted malt, nutty almost chocolate to dark bread. Hops are well within the threshold and wield an oily bitterness, flavours tag right along with herbal and floral to the point of being nearly sweet. Mild alcoholic esters with a light mix berry and currant fruitiness. Unsweetened chocolate flavour unfolds slowly on to the taste buds middle to end, close to a carob flavour. Veggie hop finish with remnants of the toasted and roasted malts in the after taste.  Notes: A big yet somewhat humble brown ale, all the flavours and complexities are there but none really want to be dominant. This could be considered a stock or strong ale due to its 7.2% abv, look at it as a sizeable brown ale. An impressive brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,jermar,3.39,"Very little tan head that didn't stick around for me (from bottle). Dark russet-brown, yet still translucent. Smell, unfortunely, is reminiscent of garbage. I began sneezing and my nose began running after my first sip - most likely a testament to its hopping and my allergies. All garbage tones disappear with a well-balanced maltness, hopiness, sweetness and alcohol flavors. 7.2% abv alcohol does not hide in this one. I didn't care for the aftertaste which leaves itself all over your mouth with lingering bitterness and alcohol numbness, but I can imagine some people enjoy that sort of thing...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
10099,1161,Bierman9,3.91,"On tap, I was a bit dissappointed. Recent reviews higher than what I experienced. Does have a lovely dark brown hue, with a nice creamy head. Nose was malty with some chocolate, but on the mild side. Medium body and tongue-smoothness. Flavor starts with nice chocolate maltiness, balanced by a good hop twang at the end. Still pretty good!  overall: 4 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4  72",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",American Brown Ale,91
