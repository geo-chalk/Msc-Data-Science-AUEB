72,224,JZH1000,4.14,"500mL bottle with the new nonsense date code.  On the pour 2 fingers of off white to tan head that became rocky and a bit foamy over a few minutes, until finally settling at a decent tan cap. Body is a dark amber to copper, with a bit of haze, but light still comes through.  Aroma carries sweet fig and toffee/caramel, but there is a slight savory oxidation thing going on. Alcohol isnoticeable, but not boozy.  Taste follows the sweet malty notes, but loses the off notes. I'm going to blame the aroma on bottle age, which for now is unfortunately uncontrollable. Traditional banana hefeweizen flavor comes through with a sweet caramelized flavor coming from the malts. Honestly very easy to drink and comes off as a Dunkelweizen to my untrained American palate. Still there is some light figgy fruit going on but this is mostly a very enjoyable dark, strong, traditional tasting hefeweizen. Nice balancing hop bitterness, but no hop aromas.   Feel is smooth and easy drinking. This beer hides its ABV well once it's on your palate. Slight astringency, but this isn't a dry beer. At the same time this beer doesn't come off as huge and thick. The astringency balances the malt well leading to the easy drinking feel of this. Medium long finish, but it's subtle. Soft subtle, but present, carbonation.  Overall there are flaws, but this is one of my favorite general doppelbock style beers I've ever had, although, it is the only weizen-doppelbock I've tried. Nice traditional hefeweizen flavor merged with delicious caramel sweet malts, as well as a nice balancing bitterness. Smells a bit funny when it gets old though.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,GuyFawkes,4.56,"2015 vintage; drank 2/11/13 @ the Yarchives.  Semi-opaque purple/orange appearance.  An even pour yielded a nice, noisy khaki head; almost no lace.  Plum, banana, candle wax & faint granola notes in the nose. Unique!  Creamy medium mouthfeel.  Plum, cognac, mild raspberry & faint clove flavors.  A complex, unique, delicious beer.

72,224,Bitterbill,4.45,"I accidentally deleted my review.  From Nov 2005 Poured from the bottle with a huge head that settled down after a few minutes...gorgeous deep brown colour. For me, the smell was fruit and cloves...nice. The taste is very complex. Chocolate, fruit and a strong clove flavour all operating in wonderful harmony...I don't even notice that it's sitting at 8%abv and that's a testament to how well made this is. I highly recommend this delicious wheat dobblebock!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Flavor: Strong and rich flavors of orange citrus, overripe bananas, banana bread, bubblegum. German yeast. Some hints of apricot, raisin, plum. Smooth caramel off the end.  Feel: Medium-bodied, strong carbonation. Bready, smooth mouthfeel. Booze shows a bit. (4.00)  Compared to Ayinger Weizenbock 2/2023: Pours darker. Stronger banana, bread, rich orange citrus spice.

Less alcohol, phenols, and sweetness. Lighter and dryer.  Overall: Fantastic and dark Weizenbock here. A little darker than some other version with a little bit more sweetness. Overripe bananas and bubblegum. Some milder authentic flavors of the darker stonefruit, plum, raisin notes. Leans darker, but still spot on for the style. (Rating: 4.24)",Schneider Weisse G.

You get hints of molasses, Carmel as well as hints of fig and dried fruit.  MF: The beer has a nice full body.  O: Overall this is a great cross between a doppelbock and a hefeweizen.

Very nice taste. Molasses and licorice. A very slight hint of smoke. A fruity dry finish. Medium body and carbonation. Very smooth and drinkable. A top shelf weizenbock!

Smell: Getting huge notes of caramel, raisins, prunes, fruity aroma with bananas maybe some cherry in there. It smells very promising! Taste: Wow!! The banana flavoring is very predominant followed by a bit of breading maybe, tasting caramel maybe toffee. Jeez you can’t taste the alcohol at all here. Feel: Medium bodied to heavy, rich, not to heavy on the carbonation. Overall: Gotta say, for only $5 picking up a pint was one of the best decisions I made tonight. I’m usually a stout guy but decided to adventure into different beers and have to say this is definitely worth trying.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,BitteNochEinWeissbier,5,"0.5 L bottle Glass: .5L Weizenbock Vase Bottle Date: 19.308 => 161019 => 16-Oct-2019 Serving Temp: 51.6 F   Look: Cloudy and murky medium brown that is opaque from the yeast. I can't see my fingers at all through the glass, not even at the narrow point. 3-finger creamy beige head dissipates slowly to a 1-finger creamy cover. Great lacing (This last bottle saw the ale starting to foam out of the bottle a few seconds after I opened it).  Smell: Absolutely wonderful. Spiced plums and pears. Rum-soaked dried fruits such as raisins and currants. Rich brown sugar. Overripe bananas. Bread dough.  Taste: As good as it smells, if not better. Cloves bite at the front, but not all that hard. Rich toffee and toasted caramel joion in quickly, along with plums, those rum-soaked dried fruits and the overripe banana. There are notes of whole wheat bread and even banana bread. Some pepper and maybe a dash of cinnamon. Finishes with a lingering combination of rich dark fruits and cloves which somehow comes across as ever-so-slightly dry and spicy.  Feel: Rich and creamy with a body that is on the heavier side of medium.  Overall: What a joy to drink. A phenomenal beer. This earns it's World Class reputation. Although one can smell and taste rum-soaked fruit, the alcohol is actually quite well hidden. Very easy to drink. Dangerously so. Goes down smooth as silk but will hit you like a sledgehammer if you aren't careful. Great stuff. This is one of my favorite beers, and has been for well over a decade, if not 2. Absolutely worth trying.    Last Update: 18-June-2022  Previous Ratings: look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 overall: 4.97",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,AlexandraDen,4.36,"Poured into a tulip, a large three finger head manifests. Tiny bubbles at the bottom, thick ones at the top, it slowly coalesces into a permanent, two finger thick dense, rocky, creamy foamy head that lasts the entire time. A slightly hazy, deep red-brown colour, this looks absolutely phenomenal in the glass. An absolute triumph. It collapses into one of the densest foam heads I’ve ever seen on any beer — not sure what some of the other reviews below are about, but maybe their cans weren’t as fresh as mine.  Very strong aromas of wheat and malt make up the base of the smell, slightly toasty. A little bit of boozy rum, and dried fruits like crispy sugared banana rings or raisins. Some spices and cloves of course!  Taste follows the nose but there are some new flavours here, such as banana bread, some nutty flavours like almond, and maybe even a little bit of orange? Spicy cloves, toasty wheats, chewy malts, the works! Fig, raisin, rum flavours as well. Complex, and even a bit subtle at times. Except for those wheaty, malty, banana spice flavours, those are always up front.  Smooth delicious mouthfeel, good carbonation that prickles your tongue without being too excessive as to wash away the flavours. Medium bodied I’d say, and it coalesces into a creamy gulp at the end of each sip. A nice long finish that is mildly sweet and keeps the general malts and candied fruits and banana on the tongue.  My oh my, what can you really say about this except for how good it is? I had to eisbock first and wanted to see how it compared. The Eisbock definitely concentrates some of the flavour, especially the malt and the darker flavours such as raisin and figs. So what is the difference? Other than the lower abv% here, the weizenbock keeps more of its dried and candied fruit flavours, and the orange/citrus fruit peel flavours as well. This one definitely has more banana in there as well. Both are champions of their respective styles, and in my opinion, the absolute top tier benchmark.  The Aventinus line is bold, beautiful, complex, and easy drinking. Absolutely phenomenal stuff. I’m overjoyed I grabbed the last 6 Eisbocks in all of Canada from the LCBO and always keep my fridge stocked with a couple of the regular Aventinus as well. 100% an absolute must try if you like German beers, or honestly, if you like beer in general.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,Rug,4.45,"It's pretty funny to me how I've only had 1 Weizenbock before and now I'm jumping to the top rated one of the style. IT was absolutely intentional as I'm on my journey to reviewing the top beer of every style. When I saw Julian's in Providence had it I just had to grab a can with my lunch takeout last week. Let's see what this one's all about  Pours a murky reddish brown with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing  The nose on here is just exceptional, much like a stronger and aggressive Dunkelweizen. I'm picking up on aromas of overripe banana, sweet raisin, rich toffee, brown bread, earthy wheat, clove, and doughy malt  It's equally rich in taste, with some more bite up front to keep things from getting overly sweet, which it borders on in the finish. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting banana, chewy toffee, orange rind, herbal hops, lightly spicy wheat, and light plum. The swallow brings notes of overripe banana, brown bread, lemon rind, white pepper, clove, and raisin  A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a creamy beer. Finishes semi dry with a lingering sweetness  I really enjoyed this beer. It's super easy drinking for the abv and just straight up delicious",Schneider Weisse G.

S: Wheat barley and hops. The cooler this came from doesn't have UV protection in the glass, and it's been shelved for 2-4 weeks, so it's a bit skunkier than intended. The ones in the back of the column and of course the back stock will fare better.  T: Fresh hops. Roasted wheat and barley. Organic no doubt. It's a league above your average ordinary every day weizenbock.  L: Not heavy. The dark color comes from the roast. Now, I do remember them being heavier and more syrupy in days past, but this current batch I'm handling, not so.  O: Smooth, clean, light, and look at them bubbles. Having a gander, they're sparkling. They're small bubbles, they're a heaping helping, and they're active. Not to mention, it hits hard and the bottle is huge.",Schneider Weisse G.

The banana bread flavor is up front on the taste, and the clove has decided to amp up its game, taking a more prominent role on the taste. The stone fruit and caramel flavors are also present, making this a true hefe Doppelbock, with all the flavors complementing each other and making this 8.2% ABV beer dangerously drinkable.  The mouthfeel is very full, yet a bit “spritzy,” that perfectly balanced hefe/Doppelbock dance these weizenbock’s work toward. This one succeeds at a world-class level, IMHO.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,BPVandenbroek,4.34,"Schneider Aventinus is slightly hazy, and a light sort of leathery brown color with rusty highlights. The head is rocky, cream colored, and lasting. At first blush, Aventinus does not smell like your average beer. The first word to come to mind is barnyard. It smells of dark bread, bananas and cloves as a German wheat beer would. But then it also smells of leather and good quality tobacco, coupled with ripe plum. Hints of horse blanket as well. All this is held together by a rich, dark sweetness that somehow makes the whole thing enticing. On the tongue, Schneider Aventinus is smooth and not as full bodied as you'd expect. Medium bodied to be sure, just not as thick as one might expect. The flavors are very well balanced. As with the nose I taste banana, clove, leather, and good quality tobacco. An overall barnyard quality carries through in its flavors of leather and hints of horse blanket. As with the nose, dark sugary notes tie the flavors together in a way that is pleasing. The finish is dry and lasting. It's smooth, balanced, and more amazingly delicious than a beer with these flavor descriptors deserves to be.",Schneider Weisse G.

Taste is nice caramel malts with banana bread notes, molasses/ sugar, tasty good. Mouth is medium and creamy, with a medium/ medium-high carbonation feel. Lingering molasses and spice at the end.

A load of bready malt is joined by dough, light banana, and clove notes. Some bubblegum sneaks in in the middle as well as light wafts of ethanol and closes with more sweet wheat bread and dough Mouthfeel: Full – bordering on chewy but never gets there, medium-high carbonation, and very soft, almost creamy throughout, especially on the finish. Very minimal alcohol heat detected as well Overall: This is an outstanding weizenbock. I hadn’t had this in probably over five years and damn, it is delicious and very well made. A ridiculous amount of dough and bread flavors/aromas with a nice dose of banana and clove that never dominate the bread as the main component.

Smallest hint of smoke on the back end as it tapers off. Feel: Medium to light bodied, surprisingly light and sparkly for the ABV. Very nice Christmas time beer. This reminded me of what some of my favourite Belgium quads might taste like in a light beer version. It earns an A.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Overall: This sample was not super fresh; but it was still great. It's easy to tell this would be even better fresh. Perfect looking dark wheat. Produces a fantastic, long lasting head. Aromas & flavors are typical of wheat ale with the added warmth of a higher alcohol presence. Mouth feel is full bodied & creamy.

72,224,kevanb,4.02,"500ml bottle, date stamp of 11022020 on the reverse, poured into a stemless wine glass.  The beer pours a very dark amber color, brown and copper hues with a thick bone-colored head, about a finger tall with good retention and spotted lacing. The aroma is very nice, lots of banana, clove, brown bread, a bit of alcohol, dark berries, a bit of vanilla and caramel. The flavors are good, vanilla, brown sugar and caramel leap out with a more fruit forward character than the nose while the more dominating and lingering flavor is fresh banana bread. The mouthfeel is good, coating and lively with a hearty medium body that finishes super smoothly.  Verdict: A very nice weizenbock. Flavorful, balanced, not too heavy though the 8.2% abv does come across assertively at times but at the end of the day, this is just a really fine beer.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,SierraNevallagash,3.92,"500ml bottle - dated 261119 - poured into a Stella Artois chalice at 38°F.  Pours a cloudy mahogany brown with four fingers of light tan foam quickly building up, and holding place. Had to manually reduce the head, but it appeared to have great retention. Zero lacing though. Lots of effervescence in a nucleated glass.  Nose: Lots of wheat and estery notes typical of a weizen. Soft malted wheat, a bit of toasted brown bread, and a round nutty note. The yeast lends some pink bubblegum, unripe banana, a hint of allspice, white pepper, some earthy, spicy hop notes, and even just the slightest whisper of funk. A hint of dark fruit wafting in and out. Smells very typical of the style.  Palate: The beer greets the palate with sweet malted wheat and a big bloom of esters, very much in line with the aroma. The esters deliver big bubblegum, unripe banana, and spice notes. The alcohol also has nowhere to hide, so even though it's only 8.2% ABV, there is a defined boozy note. There isn't exactly a chocolate note, but the slight toastiness wants to go in that direction. Almost like white chocolate with just a kiss of cocoa. The malty sweetness quickly falls back, upping the drier roasty character a little bit, which also reveals some mild spicy hops. Together, this forms a restrained bitterness, and in addition to the yeast esters, some more phenolic notes show up, lending a bit of spiciness. All of these traits work together to give this beer a finish that isn't too dissimilar from a Belgian quadruple, minus the sweetness and much of the complexity. Ultimately finishes dry.  Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is essentially medium-bodied, but there's a fullness to it that seems to increase in heft as it progresses, bringing this closer to medium-full in body. It definitely has a creaminess to it, and it's quite soft. It isn't particularly sticky or sappy, but between the wheat base, the ABV, and the soft effervescence, it takes on a full, creamy softness, much like a stout of the same ABV would be.  Overall: I've heard that this is one of the msot respected examples of the style. It's certainly authentic, and there's something about these traditional German ""bock"" beers that are nearly impossible for American breweries to accurately replicate. For that it is, it ticks all the boxes, and seems to have everything going for it. Now, with that said, I have two primary knocks. First, the yeast esters are a bit overbearing in my opinion. The pink bubblegum note becomes a bit one-dimensional after a while, and I wish that were toned down a notch. Second, is the boozy note. While this isn't as distracting as the bubblegum note, while drinking this, I am constantly aware of the alcohol flavour. Perhaps the style just doesn't lend itself to hiding ABV that well, in which case a lower ABV format might suit it better, but then you'd lose that wonderful body. It is a bit boozy, but I guess the trade off is that it's delightfully silky smooth. Either way, still a great example, and despite the bubblegum-heavy yeast profile, it's a good authentic German Doppelbock.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,jrc1093,4.31,"Can reads 'L19226' (presumably canned on 8/14/19)  Pours a foggy, muddled maroon-mahogany body topped with a cascading multiple fingers of thick, creamy off-white head; excellent retention results in ¾ of a finger of creamy cap/collar and sprawling splotches of dense, webby lacing.  Aroma presents a beautiful harmony of banana and clove upfront, redolent of fresh banana bread, and accented with dark fruit esters (blackberry, raspberry); caramel is soft in the backdrop, leveled by a properly interwoven booziness.  Taste offers banana and rounded clove notes grazed with a touch of yeasty spice; an inherent brown breadiness begins to reveal itself over time alongside wheat and smoked cacao nibs, with touches of fire-roasted almond and walnut adding additional depth past the swallow.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and brings a full, airy carbonation, remaining soft and developing a vague semi-oily texture into the mid-palate; a creamy peak presents on the back of the palate into a dry, fluffy spritz through the finish; minimal booze and subtle warmth lingers.  A weizenbock of steady decadence and understated abundance, there's a casual attention to detail that keeps the profile intriguing yet approachable, rich yet never cloying; this is a beer-dessert in the most classical sense.",Schneider Weisse G.

Small quickly disappearing tan head over a dark brownish copper clear body. Smell is of dark fruit, caramel and sherry. Taste is very sherry forward with other sweet caramel/vanilla flavors hidden. Any wheat banana and clove tastes are long gone. Mouthfeel is still very refreshing.  By itself this is very fine but I have a feeling that this is well past the time for maximum complexity. Next time I'll try a younger one or do a vertical.  7/27/2019  2012 vintage bought at same bottle shop and poured into same DFH tulip. Body and head are essentially the same as the 2008 but the smell is much more complex with spice notes overlaying the sherry aroma. The taste confirms the smell as cloves and still a faint banana taste exist in conjunction with the dark fruits and sherry flavor. Mouthfeel is very clean and refreshing.

Smell is rich caramel and grain, raisins, toffee.  Taste is right along with the aroma.  Mouthfeel is light on the tongue, but builds up thickness as you drink it. Unfortunately, I think what appears as murky brownness is some kind of a chalky suspension, which is noticeable on the tongue as a fine grittiness, which I don't particularly like and I doubt is intentional. I wonder if it's a product of age or what (although the label says you can cellar it) -- it was sitting still in my fridge for 48+ hours before I drank it, so if it was sediment, it should have settled out.

Murky amber, regular foam for a weizen, perhaps fading a bit quicker than usual. As always, pointless details.  Nose is classic hefe what comes to elements (banana, cloves, a bit of juicy fruit). There is alcohol as the beer warms, and some yeast-derived esters in this young version. Appetizing.  Taste matches aroma but the key impression is supreme drinkability. Sweet but not cloying banana mixing with nice maltiness (Munich malts?), a bit of toffee type caramel, makes you want to take another sip. So simple and so perfect. Subtleness and avoidance of tiring sweetness or spiciness is I would guess the reason this is so addictive.  In summary, an example of a weizen to provide as a challenge to those who claim to hate the style.

72,224,Zet,4.18,"It looks a bit tame, with its hazel brown colour without much carbonation and a modest head. It smells very exciting however: a big cloud of clove, malt, ripe banana and orange fills the nostrils. It is so clovy and fruity, it actually smells a bit like a malty Glühwein. Taste follows suit, with lots of clove, banana, orange, liquorice, lemon zest, cinnamon and caramel. Lots of intense flavours in this brew. 0,5 liter might be a bit too much though: it gets a bit boring near the bottom. The mouth feel is full-bodied, soft and smooth and the alcoholic afterglow is very satisfying. I don't want to promote alcohol consumption too much here, but this beer did make me happy.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,SLeffler27,4.32,"Pours clear, dark copper (SRM 30) with dark red garnet highlights. The think almond head is creamy, but dissipates quickly to a veil in an Aventinus weizen glass.  The aroma is sweet, with cloves and malt up front. Overripe pears and bananas are followed by Juicy Fruit gum.  The flavor is sweet and closely follows the nose. A short, mild finish adds prunes and dates.  With a full body and soft, smooth texture, light carbonation conceals the alcohol.  This is a great beer. One which I have overlooked for many years. It is dangerously easy to consume. It would pair with any occasion, but tastes like Autumn in a glass.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Light tan head, two fingers settles slowly to thick creamy cap. Lacing slides back into beer. Aroma of sugared caramel, dates, figs, banana, and cloves. Some wafting of alcohol. Taste is sweet caramel malt, slight wheat twang, banana, cloves. Sweet caramelized sugar and dark fruits. Biscuit and a little dark chocolate. Medium, creamy mouth feel. Medium tongue numbing.

72,224,Snowcrash000,3.93,"Pours a murky brown coloration with a medium, foamy head. Smell is quite boozy, dominated by caramel malt and estery banana, with just a hint of dark fruits, clove and yeast. Taste is malt-forward, with strong estery fruit notes, spice and just a hint of wheaty yeast. Caramel, bready malt, with notes of banana and red/dark fruits: redcurrant, fig, plum, and cloves/pepper. Quite a bit of boozyness present as well. Finishes with a light bitterness and stronger, sweet, fruity notes in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and low/medium carbonation. This is probably the most boozy Doppelbock I've ever had, which kinda ruins it for me despite a good complexity and rich body/mouthfeel.  I just had a chance to sample a 4 1/2-year old ""Vintage Edition"" bottle of this beer and I have to say that drinking it next to a fresh bottle was a fascinating experience. First off, the pour is clearer, with a much smaller head and very poor retention. Lots of floaters during final pour as well. Smell is a lot richer and maltier. Somewhat sweeter with a much more pronounced dark fruit note that almost lends this a sherry-like quality. Still a little spice coming through, but the estery yeast notes have almost completely disappeared. A little chocolate coming through as well. Taste is a lot deeper and more complex, following a similar pattern to the nose. Maltier, slightly sweeter, with much richer dark fruit notes and added notes of toffee and chocolate, while the estery yeast/banana and wheat notes are very muted, but not quite as much as in the nose. Still a good deal of spiciness coming through as well. Also feels somewhat more boozy. This definitely becomes a lot more of a sipper with age, gaining an impressive amount of richness and complexity, but really losing a lot of drinkability as well.",Schneider Weisse G.

Complex and diverse array of aromas include dark fruit; prune, plum and raisin. There is also banana, as well as light clove and bubblegum. This brew is a real treat in the mouthfeel and flavor! Soft and smooth, a product of the wheat. Medium bodied and gently carbonated. Sweet flavors from the banana, caramelized malt and marmalade jam like malt texture. The yeast produces fruity eaters in the form of dark fruit; raisin, plum, prune, and grape. Light clove provides the balance. Some dryness in the finish, as well as light tartness. Towards the end, a nice bready and toasty quality comes through in the aroma and flavor, as well as a hint of chocolate. Wonderful brew and just about the best example of the style!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Upon smelling i caught wiffs of fig, raisin, cinnamon and grape. The vintage smelled of caramelized candy. Taste was exquisite. I tasted medium carbonation. Sweet notes of fruit and dried raisin. Slightly spicey. Slight alcohol flavor. Vintage had a lot less spice, more mellow flavor. Enjoyed the fresh taste better. Vintage smelled better. Just love this beer. I have bought cases of it and could drink it everyday. My absolute favorite.  Update Jun 2019: Still one of the best beers I have ever tried in the world. Wow!",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,PolishHurricane,4.39,"S: Smells of light alcohol, toasted malts and caramel notes, with accent of smokey clove, maybe even banana in strong doses. Perhaps similar to coca-cola caramel. T: Initially hit with lightly sweet caramel, toasted wheat and light smoke. Followed by more smoke, banana peel with prominent raisin (with light fruity bitterness) and candied fruit characters at finish. Some mineral water / clove at times. Alcohol perfectly matched with the taste and is barely noticable. F: Carbonation right away, light wheat, malt mouth feel, finishes with a sharp carbonation. Not thick, leaves mild tongue feel.  Probably the best of the few Doppelbock's I've had, not too sweet thankfully. A 4.25 doesn't give it justice, 4.5 in it's class, about 10th in my list of German Imports.",Schneider Weisse G.

A toasted wheat aroma mingles with banana peel and spices. with a touch of alcohol. The taste is of deep toasted wheat, dates, a slight bitterness of weak coffee and baker's chocolate, a rounded and muted clove...all coming together like a slightly over baked Stollen. Full bodied for the style, creamy but with good carbonation, enough to keep it from being heavy.  Minor points deducted for the chunky yeast.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,Thomas_Wikman,4.26,"This is an extremely good wheat beer. I liked it very much. However, it was brewed five years ago, so I wonder if it is passed its prime. I don't know, it was still delicious.  Look: brown coca-cola like hue with a half inch off-white head  Aroma: toasted malts, yeasty dough, sweet  Taste: The flavor is moderately yeasty dough/wheat and caramel with primarily dark fruits, banana, figs, raisins, and the alcohol is not noticeable.  Feel: light to medium body, easy drinking",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,AventinusLover,5,"To me this is perfect. I have tried all the Trappists. While some of those are very good, nothing that I have had beats Aventinus. Well maybe the Eisbock version, but I have not seen that one here for awhile. Incredible.

Head retention is nice S: Nice smell, toasted malt, cola, hints of dark fruits and alcohol. Sweet and aromatic/spicy T: Hot damn. Complex as hell, up front I get lots of esters and phenol, slightly spicy. Get that banana/clove type thing common in these beers. Once this fades malts shine through stronger. Tons of dark fruit, think fig or dried apricot, even raisins. Caramelized sugars come through as well, molasses, caramel, toffee. Finishes with a touch of dryness, earthy hops. Nothing is out of balance or assertive here, present but not in your face. F: Certainly a touch heavy, but not more than you'd think. Still really easy to drink, mouthfeel is remarkably smooth. Silky, carbonation is soft. This beer coats your mouth but you don't hate it for it, and it is in no way astringent, its quite freshing. O: Big fan of this, perfectly brewed.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,m_hall,4.47,"2012 bottling, poured into a tulip glass. Pours a hazy deep reddish-brown, with substantial bits of trub from the extended bottle fermentation. The head is tan and falls away rather quickly, which is no surprise given the substantial age on this bottle.  Aromas are dominated by candied fruits, caramel, and light spicy notes (cinnamon, clove.)  Flavors are rich and fruity... banana, apricots ,figs, raisins and prunes jump out along with a with a light caramel malt sweetness. There's a light bit of woodiness in the mid-palate (from oxidation, probably) but it actually works well within the flavor profile. Toasted nuts, light spice and yeast notes lead in to a slightly dry and earthy finish contrasts nicely with the sweet front end.  Mouth-feel is medium and smooth, with light carbonation (again, bear age in mind here.) It's rich enough in the mouth to make you want to take your time with each sip and fully appreciate the flavors, but still light enough to be quite drinkable. Alcohol is 8.2% but very well masked.  I have limited experience with Weizenbocks, but Unser Aventinus is a wonderful beer. There's a tremendous amount of craft here to balance everything out so well while creating a beer that takes to extended aging the way this does. Each sip seems to bring out more and more characteristics to enjoy. If I can keep finding this with regularity, this is one I'll definitely try to have a bottle of ready to go at all times.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,DaverCS,4.72,"Pours a hazy and almost even turbid light-brown color with ample sediment.  Aroma is super complex. Classic hefe characteristics start the sip, like clove and banana. This pairs with a sweet honey-like malt. Dark fruits then overtake the nose: raisins, figs, and prunes. Delicious!  Taste is super pleasant. Very drinkable but each sip is still worth savoring and analyzing. This is thicker and sweeter in mouthfeel than a Trappist Rochefort, but many base flavors are similar. Despite the ABV being lower, this is more full-bodied and more robust in almost all regards (compared to Rochefort). Clove, banana, prune, raisin, orange-blossom honey, and light citrus notes all battle for attention. This is cleansed with a moderate carbonation level.  For classic beers, this is up there! Near perfection in my opinion. Would definitely buy again. This screams for a bratwurst with some homemade mustard, sauerkraut, and beer cheese. It gets an easy 94.5/100.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,Kazmodaeus,4.99,"The first time I experienced this beer was in a pizza parlor in Joplin Missouri. A waiter had brought a bottle to the table next to ours and I could smell the beer the minute the cap was popped. What kind of beer smells like bubble gum? I asked. Anyway I ordered one and when it came I poured it to a tall pils. The head supported a soda straw upright for, well, longer than I had the patience to wait for it to fall. First taste was mostly affected by nose, confusing and lots going on. As my mind wrapped around this beer, I realized that I had found my first personal A-list beer not driven by 'sentimental value'. Certainly there were favorite beers, but nothing like this.  L: Dark, opaque, rich with occasional deep brown reflections. Rich, taupe thick head like whipped cream.  S: Combined wheat and spice notes give bubble-gum first impression, then settle into expected banana and clove and malt. Cracked wheat and vanilla on closer inspection. Big nose - you can smell it from the table next to you  T: All malt and fruit, no hops. Big, strong, something for every part of the tongue except bitter. Wheat bread soaked in small beer, all the expectations of a true wheat ale, esters from higher temp ferment, slight straight alcohol just to remind you that it is there.  F: Rich, full heavy mouthfeel. Long lasting aftertaste same as actual taste, it just lingers. More bubbly than you would expect from something this rich and malty. Matches smell and taste perfectly - not over the top, but big and satisfying.  O: Easily my favorite production beer. I have found many beers near and dear to me since I discovered this one, but it is not hard to rate this #1 on my list of commercial brews. Everyone has a different palette and different expectation, but this beer matches mine perfectly, and even if it is not a perfect match for yours, I am certain you will find it worth the time and money to try it.",Schneider Weisse G.

Look: The beer pours a cloudy brown with 6cm of tan, dense, mousse-like head that settles into a thick cap in 4+ minutes. Decent lacing and persistent overall head.  Smell: Strong and sweet. Bold fruity esters (banana) and phenolic spice (clove). Further notes include dark fruit, faint alcohol, vanilla, and wheat.  Taste: Follows the aroma seamlessly. Strong, sweet, and malty-rich. Prominent fruity esters with banana and clove at the front. Dark fruit and bready, wheaty malts, faint alcohol as well as vanilla. No apparent hops.  Feel: Medium body with moderate carbonation. Creamy and on the smoother side with restrained alcohol warming. Effervescent.  Overall: A very good, malty-rich, and sweet brew. Not a world-class or even outstanding beer for me. I'm surprised of the high ratings. Still, a solid example of the marriage between a weissbier and doppelbock. Give it a go.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

(quick side note: when I buy dark schneider weisse, I typically buy the eisbock as I like it better and I have much more experience with it). Immediately the warm, sweet spices come through followed by the phenols, along with hints of orange (sorry, they're there), and a slight vienna lager-esque toastiness, along with some notes of syrupy cherry.

S: The smell is strong on the malt and breadiness. There is definitely some hay on the nose, but the toasty caramels and toffees dominate, and wonderfully so.  T: The taste is malt forward as a bock should be, with a small amount of pleasant wheat characteristics. I swear there is still a smidgeon of banana present amid lovely malt and dark fruit notes. The crystal malts dominate with a strong sweetness that at no point becomes cloying.  F: Wonderful and refreshing. The beer has a medium carbonation that keeps every taste fresh (quite the feat with the strong flavors at play). The mouthfeel itself is rich and silky, and absolute pleasure to sip on.  O: This is a lovely weizenbock. A go to for paring with cold cut sandwiches or savory pastries.

Apricot marmalade, a slight fringe of caramelized brown sugar, and some oaky orchards of golden apples. A high level of carbonation lightens and brightens the flavor, which would otherwise be much darker than the scent would have one believe. Brown sugar, plums, and dark cherries are balanced by sweet green pears and golden apples. Some lightly smoked cloves weave their way through the layers, rounding out the beer's signature refined complexity. The medium-light mouthfeel defies the higher ABV, and alcohol warming is undetectable. Not mind-blowing, perhaps, but a solid, traditional take on this fine, age-old style.",Schneider Weisse G.

I'm getting star anise, toffee, fudge, mild light roast coffee and plums. Notes of vanilla, bananas and cloves.  Taste: Sweet notes of candied apples, chocolate covered raisins and red figs upfront. A gentle caramel and crème brûlée flavor unfolds midpalate, followed by spicy yet restrained notes of rye bread, banana pudding, saltwater taffy and cloves. The entire tasting experience is blanketed by a dry, floral, woody, and slightly alcoholic taste akin to rosewater.  Feel: Light and crisp. Lager like but with noticeably more alcohol. Leans towards the sweet side of the beer spectrum, while still maintaining some balance.  Overall: I don't know what to say about this one besides that it's extremely delicious and well crafted.

Fig, cherry and prune are strong here, with presence of banana in the background. Licorice. Very pleasant dark fruit notes linger heavily on the tongue, pairing very nicely with the moderately high alcohol.  Medium bodied.

72,224,Bierliebhaber3,4.68,"This wheat dopplebock, or weizenbock, pours a dark brown opaque color with a thick foamy tan head that quickly dissipates. The scent is very malty and of wheat. The taste is very much of biscuity malts, with some caramel notes, and also there is a strong wheat flavor that I’m more used to experiencing with a much lighter beer. There is hardly any hop character to speak of. The alcohol flavor is amazingly mild also considering that this is a 8.2% beer, though as it warms up you taste it more. There is a full, creamy body, but the finish is very nice and crisp, which is very surprising considering the style and the darkness of this beer. This is a really different than a traditional dopplebock at least compared to what I’ve tried, but it’s really amazing. It has more in common with a dunkelweizen, but is heartier.

72,224,CraftySir22,4.92,"This is not the first time I've dabbled in traditional German beers and will not be the last. Essentially, if you (random bar in east bum(sex) O(some state that will be offended the least) decided to put this on tap-- I would (hypothetically) order it every single time I walked through your roughshod threshold. This is beer crafted in its most perfect form -- anything we do now is merely a perversion of what was previously established.Wheat Dopplebock... American craft brewmanship has not been allowed to delve into this realm of brewing to any substancial degree because the American consumer craft beer palate has barely left high ABV citrus bomb IPAs which are, to my palate, brash and unilateral... and I mean if that's what you're going for then by all means do not drink this beer.  However, upon buying this beer voluntarily you already know how wonderful it is (probably -- unless you made an impulse buy, in which case you hit the jackpot) . On top of that, you already know that it has hundreds of years of lineage to rely on, so, you already know how good this elixir is.  That being said, this amazing beverage has a dark amber hue, and the clarity is akin to a looking glass in a hurricane. (I'm not sure where that came from). If you were to try to look through this beer you wouldn't be able to because it is dark amber and is hazy to point of obscurity.  When you smell the Aventius Tap 6, you are immediately reminded of your lack of cicerone credentials. However, as soon as you have recovered from that sensory onslaught of amazing dark fruit and sweet syrup. The nose is of a simple saison-like quality but definitely tart and funky.  That being said, tasting this beer is like tasting soda for the first time as a deprived Amish 12 year old. But really, the Look, I've already described and I wont do that again. The smell is of sweet Bavarian yeast.. The taste is sweet, (words like nectar come to mind) and very carbonated (yet perfectly balanced), when this beer journeys down your esophagus it rides on a river on infinitesimally small bubbles that were perfectly crafted through hundreds of years of practice. When it comes to the feel, try it for yourself, it is a wild ride for your taste buds and they will love every minute of it. Cheers! I bet Bavarian Kings drank this stuff.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,HappyGuy12345,5,"Drank from a 0.5 liter glass in Munich, Germany (and re-sampled from a hefeweizen glass after poured from a bottle) Appearance: Dark caramel/brown. Good amount of head, measuring approximately three-fingers. Smell: Very faint amount of banana, coffee, and various spices Taste: In a word: Delicious. The taste combines the classic weissbier flavor with strong hints of caramel and coffee, raisin, and sugar. There are also some hints of flavors that I cannot even describe (in a good way). This is a truly unique beer in regards to flavor. Mouthfeel: Light-moderate carbonation. Incredibly smooth going down. Does not overwhelm the palate at all. Certainly a full-bodied beer, especially compared to other beers of the small class. Overall: Maybe it's because I initially tried this beer in the USA, found it delicious, and then was able to drink it on on tap in the Schneider Weisse Brewhouse in Munich, that I simply fell in love with this beer. There are many amazing German beers, but this is my favorite thus far.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

But there is something here that is unlike a Hefe. Lots of pepper. Black pepper and a really nice grassy smell. Oddly, the first thing I thought of was rootbeer when I first smelled it....I chalk it up to being very cold, lol. TASTE: Banana bread, pepper, lots of cloves, freshly cut grass. Leans more to the sweeter side on the finish, but not cloying. Dry finish. FEEL: Nice, big carbonation. Soft on the palate. Medium body.

There are enough hops to balance the bready malts. Honey and ginger show up, with sweet banana puree.

Not heavy or overpowering. This brew is aged for three years and there are multiple years available. This is the 2010 vintage. Overall - I really like this beer. It comes wrapped in a labeled bag with its vintage tag expressing the brew itself. This process by the brewery began in 1999. Only 240 cases are bottled a year. A great option if you are looking for something unique and limited. I was introduced to this by a friend and I am looking forward to find other years to try (certain availability from 2004 - 2010 currently).",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,utopiajane,4.33,"Today I have a dreamy dopplebock made with wheat. This style is called weizenbock. It has no hop scents or flavors and is cloudy. The malts in this beer are wheat & munich and or vienna. In the progression up through the light colored lagers that began with seasonal styles that I am following, this is the first dark beer that will show me strong phenols and that is from the yeast character. When I think of German beer I always think of the admiration they have for it. In the weizenbock their admiration for hops turns out to be a captivating moment of attention as there really aren't any hop flavors in this beer.   Here is Aventinus-  Unfiltered the pour is a dark honey brown with a tan head that lasted well. Subtle hues of orange play in the soft glow of the beer.  First scent is big pumpernickel bread. Then it softens to a bock like sweetness with lots of vibrant fruit presence. No hops. Wheat is breaddy. As the beer warms the spice comes forward and generous notes from clove and a graceful banana. No diacetyl, no dms, No trace of the alcohol on the nose.   Body is light for it's strength and creamy. It glides with all it's flavor to the finish that shows the hops for the first time. They provide just enough bitterness to balance the beer without showing any flavor at all. Clean bitterness. The alcohol also helps to balance the finish in this beer and as you notice there is not much bitterness you also notice some warmth from the abv. Carbonation is high and even though the bubbles are tiny they give a tingle and a crispness to the finish. The head refreshes with each tip so that is highly carbonated.   As you drink you will notice the earthy malts give you glimpses of chocolate. A touch of sweet warmth and a soft silken breaddiness to linger. Heartier than some I have tried with a good light body . As lightly as it drinks the breaddiness in this beer never wanes, never falls victim to too much sweetness or sugar in the finish.  This beer is the benchmark for the style.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Meyers1023,4.38,"Pours a dark brown color with half a glass worth of off white head that seems to never go away. It smells of banana, yeast, clove, and malt. Very good nose. The taste follows the nose with a bit more sweetness. You get caramel, banana, some fruit, and a hint of clove. The feel is medium with good carbonation but something making it very smooth. This is a world class beer!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,breadwinner,4.19,"Sad it took me so long to get around to this classic. Weizenbock is such an interesting style, with both dark versions (like this and Mahrs, for example) and lighter ones (like Weihenstephaner, Ayinger, etc.) What's even more interesting is that, at least to my palate, not all of the dark versions taste, well, dark. So it is with Aventinus, which tastes like an amped up hefe/dunkel mix, some inescapable banana notes, to be sure, plus a sort of spiced apple flavor. I don't get much chocolate or roast, as you get with Mahrs. Perhaps the lightest touch of dark fruit. Really, though, this is banana + spiced apple to me. Smooth feel, as you'd expect from a master German brewer. Overall, a fine brew, though the aforementioned Mahrs remains my weizenbock of choice for the darker iterations.",Schneider Weisse G.

Nice aroma of yeast, cloves, banana, citrus, and tobacco. The taste is a little sweeter than the nose and includes some nice caramel and plum. There is also hint of hops but it's not bitter at all. The feel of this beer is delightful: it's nicely carbonated and very drinkable at 8% ABV. Overall, this is a truly great beer! It has a tasty, complex flavor profile but it is so easy to drink.

The lacing that came about after the dissipation was nice and streamy thick, making a decent effort to spider web and cling but that ends up sliding a bit. The smell has a thick rich sweet cake-like malt sliding into some bananas, raisins, and a light amount of cocoa. Clove-like spices ride in for the balance. The taste was sweet through all of the previously mentioned flavors with a light lingering cake-like aftertaste and finish. Clove hits in subtle notes. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a decent sessionably sweet feel. Carbonation felt right as even that hit just enough to allow the sweet part to slide over my tongue.

72,224,SaltofOH,4.53,"Bottle dated 15-184 (July 3rd). 130515. Hefeweizen glass.  Appearance: Holy head Batman! The whole hefeweizen glass was full of a light tan foam on a gentle pour down the side. Initially a crystal clear dark amber/reddish brown, but I can see there is sediment in the bottle, which I will be pouring in a soon as the crazy four fingers of head subsides. As I pour more in, the head extends a full 1, almost 2 fingers above the glass and just stands there, jiggling. Chunks of yeast sediment dropping down into the glass now (I did swirl it when 1/4 full, but obviously not enough). While it was clear I observed tremendous carbonation. Retains a 1.5 finger tan head. Lacing is excellent. A hazy slightly translucent light brown.  Smell: Bananas! Yeast esters like crazy. Red grapes, prunes. Bready malt smells not as pronounced as I would expect, this was at 40 deg. F. As it warms, breadiness increases; something smells almost like cocoa butter/sunscreen.  Taste: Remarkably dry arrival, complex maltiness with unmistakable wheat, yeast ester fruitiness: plums, grapes, and alcohol. Exceptionally refreshing for an 8.2% ABV beer. Not ""malty"" in the traditional sense, but truly like eating a very unsweetened German sprouted whole wheat bread with no-sugar added grape preserves.  Mouthfeel: Notable, but not excessive carbonation. Remarkably clean-finishing for the complexity of the wheat/malt bill and the high alcohol. Not really much of the banana on the palate as on the nose; the bready character is really there on the taste. Although you can taste the alcohol, you can't feel it on the palate.  Overall: This is a really refreshing fall beer with complex maltiness, clove and fruit aromas, and not a bit of sweetness. Very high carbonation, which is just fine by me. The only detraction is that the alcohol is absolutely detectable on the palate. I love it. But it is not a beer for hanging out on the patio on a Sunday afternoon; it is a bold experience. Could be a great winter wheat. Only other weizenbock I've ever had was Victory's moonglow; this has less pronounced alcohol, lighter body and cleaner finish.

Banana esters are present as well as molasses, toffee/caramel and fruity light grains. There is a spicy finish that catches the nostrils ever so slightly....very nice overall!  T- Beautiful flavors that combine rich dark fruits, with sweet toffee/caramel malt! Banana, black molasses, mildly oaked vanilla, and bread yeast comprise the basis of the flavors with a slightly citrusy backbone. I also get hints of milky chocolate and rum cake spiciness. The finish lingers with sticky flavors on the palate and as this warms, the alcoholic tinge smooths out. There is virtually no hop bitterness either on the finish.  M/O- The mouthfeel of this one is medium/full bodied, and the carbonation is creamy smooth....perhaps the best way to describe this is dessert like....almost banana bread in character! The alcohol is so well hidden for a high percentage and is so well balanced between sweet, dried fruit, alcohol and spice that one forgets that this is beer really! I can see why this is so highly regarded and I would absolutely love to enjoy this beer all evening, but I'm sure it would catch up with me very quickly. This is the essence of excellence for this style and I will most definitely get this one again if given the chance!

72,224,ajm5108,3.88,"2009 vintage. Pretty dark pour, not too much head, looks almost like a trendy hard root beer. Tons of alcohol esters coming from the nose, very sweet with a black grape must aroma as well as moist fig and cola. A lot of that carries over to the taste profile, with the cola flavor being surpringly noticeable. Dark fruit (date, raisin) weaving around with the alcohol esthers gives it a high booze taste. Very little perceptible hops or malt but thats not surprising given the style and age, though there are some caramel malt flavors in it. Thin mouthfeel, almost watery. I havent had too many weizenbocks so I was taken aback that it wasn't as malty and hefty as some German beer, but it definitely is a good beer and should be tried once.",Schneider Weisse G.

Nice levels of carbonation and a good mouth feel. Note that despite the high alcohol level, there is no really feel of booziness in this one. Super smooth and a wonderful beer to drink.

F) Smooth, not as fizzy as a standard weizen. Pleasant warmth from the alcohol a moment after the swallow.

72,224,doktorhops,4.72,"Time for some Tap 6, Schneider Weisse style! And this is the beer I promised to review over 4 years ago when I did my review of Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen, even though Schneider Weisse Tap 6 Unser Aventinus is a Weizenbock, which would natürlich have to be compared to Weihenstephaner’s own Weizenbock: their Vitus. Anyway, let’s not dwell on how much of a beer-geek rookie I was back then, let us dwell on how beer-wise I have become. Oh, and let’s enjoy this tasty Weizenbock or “wheat billy goat” in the direct German translation [I kid you not. Ooo, that was an unexpected goat related pun right there!].  Poured from a 500ml bottle into a Weizen glass.  A: A nice deep hazy Doppelbock caramel brown body with a khaki cappuccino froth 1 inch head that soon settles down to a centimetre. So far so great. 9/10.  S: Ironically the aroma for Tap 6 is more bananary than their Tap 7 (aka their Hefeweizen). Following the bold banana note are hints of caramel and dark fruits, but they’re really sitting back and letting the banana do its thing, and I applaud them for it, go banana go! 10/10.  T: DA-AMN! This is why I was comparing this brew to Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen - it’s all that I love about that brew and more, more everything! Bananas with caramel-sticky-date-molasses. It’s big, bold chewy and sugary with a dry finish that has a hint of cola - yes you heard me - cola as in the biggest ™ in the world. There is a minor distraction in a hint of metal lurking about in the aftertaste but otherwise this is Weizenbock that beats all other Weizenbocks. 9/10.  M: Mid to heavy body with some cloying from the sugar (to be expected with an 8.2% ABV heavyweight) and a soft but creamy carbonation. Suits this brew to a T. 9/10.  D: Oh how the mighty have risen with Schneider Weisse! After reviewing their Tap 7 and being a tad disappointed by my memory, which I believe had betrayed me, it turns out my memory of Tap 6 and subsequent now drinking has totally redeemed Schneider Weisse to me as the brutal heavy-hitting awesome Bavarian brewer they are, and a young impudent upstart against die älteste Brauerei der Welt, aka Weihenste... you-know-who-the-hell-I’m-talking-about! If you love puppies and don’t want them killed (by someone named ‘Cletus’ in my employ) drink this beer, YHBW. 10/10.

Perfect blend of light wheat and some darker toasted malt. Banana, raisin, toffee, mild clove, sweetness all blend in near-perfect harmony. I can't imagine what this could be like on tap (#6).

After much searching and coming up empty handed, I found it at a Whole Foods and settled for their premium pricing. $5/500ml  Amber colored. Enjoyed warm ~60F, so it poured nice and frothy. A head about 2 fingers thick formed. First impression of this beer was its intense estery aroma. Very sweet and bread-like. Some quite nice yeasty flavors. Very smooth and nicely sticky.

This beer is brown and cloudy, which makes for a stark, intriguing look in the glass -- dark, but not the typical of dark ales (or stouts/porters). Small dark tan head which falls quickly. Aroma is of uncooked bread dough. Flavor is distinctly Aventinus. Fantastic spicy clove and grain flavors from the yeast. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light, with fine carbonation. Finish is neutral. This beer is fantastically drinkable, which is especially impressive when you consider it's essentially a Doppelbock that happens to be brewed with wheat (I often find Doppelbocks chalky and quickly tiring to my palate). What really gets me though is the depth of flavor that carries over the tongue. It's just a series of fantastic wheat and barley flavors complemented by German style hops, impeccably balanced. This beer is perfection and I hope they never change it.  One of my favorite beers ever since I first tried it over 10 years ago.

A lot going on in the nose: some banana, a little clove, a little bubblegum, some dark candy and apple. Tastes like it smells, with a wheat bite. Esters everywhere.  Mouthfeel is great, creamy but still a little sharp on the tongue, due to the wheat.  I love this beer, it's like a cross between a dubbel (some dark sugar taste), a tripel (banana), and a wheat.

I'm assuming its a combination of the darker malts mixed with the wheat  T: fruity fig, dates ... darker dried fruits, some raisin bread ... sweet ... very sweet, in fact; candy ... very Belgian abbey-ale like, almost tastes like a dubbel or quad  F: fantastic solid carbonated feel, easy to drink for such a big brew  O: I love this style ... I don't know much about it, but this brew in particular is very sweet, strong in ABV but easy to drink with all the alcohol hidden, lots of darker fruit tastes; only the slight sourness in the nose tips off the wheat, otherwise it comes off like a really good Belgian dubbel ... fantastic beer",Schneider Weisse G.

The smell is of toasted whole wheat bread, banana and clove.  The taste is of roasted grain, banana, clove, molasses and faint coffee.  The texture is heavy bodied with medium carbonation.  Delicious toasted bread, banana and faint spice goodness.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,NeilSilber1,4.64,"Pours dark caramel chocolate color with khaki foamy head. Sweat malty notes with beautiful malty quad taste. Maybe the best “dopplebock” brew in its class. Thank you Patrick M at Rulon for the introduction!  “ With flavors of bready malt and dark fruits like plum, raisin, and grape, this style is low on bitterness and high on carbonation. Balanced clove-like phenols and fruity, banana-like esters produce a well-rounded aroma.”",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,TCJ0100,4.5,"The beer is a rich dark tan color. It's so good I decided to write a review which is rare for me. It pours a delightful head, and it just looks plain delectable.  The smell is phenomenal: I get banana, clove, peppermint, a touch of booze culminating in a fresh lemongrass aroma. It smells like a hefeweizen with some extra alcohol and earthy flavors. In the taste I get candy sugar, wheat, honey, clove, banana, and a little booze. It tastes like that clove gum with some alcohol added.  This is a great beer. I have to drink these occasionally to remind myself that there is more to beers than hops and coffee stouts. It is almost sad to realize that no American brewery could replicate this taste. I rate this among some of the best beers created. Its not barrel-aged or hop forward, but it's delicious and subtle, which I have yet to find in American beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,REVZEB,4.58,"One of the best weizenbocks I have ever had. The pour is gorgeous and alluring with a deep amber and plenty of inviting white foam. The smell was wonderful to breathe in, dark fruits, wheat, malt bradiness, some subtle spices, and hints of mushroom. The taste had everything going through the spicey wheat and it was well balanced. Great weizenbock",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,The_Mad_Capper,4.55,"The aroma is characterized by spicy clove and a hint of alcohol along with a banana-like sweetness and a faint undertone of dark fruit or molasses. The body is cloudy and dark brown with a creamy, off-white head; creamy lacing clings to the glass. The predominant flavor is sweet and tangy, which is oddly reminiscent of baked beans. There is a good twang of clove-like spiciness with just a touch of banana-like sweetness (not as prominent as in the nose) and fairly noticeable alcohol. Over time, the flavor evens out, and becomes darkly fruity, earthy/woody, and dry. The considerable alcohol adds some dryness and warmth; it is somewhat creamy and medium-full in body with soft and frothy carbonation and a good carbonic bite.  Overall, very flavorful and expressive, strong but not overwhelming. Instead of being merely a weizen with more alcohol, the typically sweet bubblegum and banana flavors are subdued while the spiciness, dark fruitiness, and rich malt take center stage, making it reminiscent of a Belgian dark strong with more clove and frothier carbonation.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,LeeryLeprechaun,4.25,"Beer pours murky brown with a tan head that is rocky and likes to stick to the glass.  Aroma of dark baked bread, some banana, a touch of alcohol.

72,224,UrbanCaveman,4.77,"1 pint bottle, poured into a bell glass at approximately 45 degrees F.  A: Pours the color of weak coffee or strong tea, pooling into the glass as a lovely shade of burnished copper, cloudy and murky with a red-copper sheen where light shines through along the sides of the glass. The head is a pale, faint tan, and lingers a while as a cap which leaves some sheet lacing that slowly slips back down to the surface.  S: Toffee-sprinkled wheat bread dipped in caramel, slathered in some banana and grape preserves.  T: A malt explosion, all toffee-caramel bread. Hints of banana and cloves swim through the sweetness, alongside some faint grape-raisin-black cherry echoes. There's a touch of herbaceous bitterness to the finish, and oddly, I get more alcohol heat from the Aventinus than the Aventinus Eisbock.  M: A tad on the thin side, towards watery, but still somewhat sticky, with lively carbonation.  O: A phenomenal weizenbock, managing to keep the focus on sweetness, malt, and fruit flavors, without much of a noticeable hop presence. In a straight comparison, I'd choose the eisbock version every time, but that is an entirely different category of beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,aleigator,3.8,"Big white, slightly beige head, with a nut brown, earthy color. Leaves a decent lacing.  Banana, warm malts, honey, plums, molasse and ripe pear.  Excellent, refreshing beginning, supported by banana, malts and a fitting, high carbonation. Decent complexity, malt gives this a medium-body, with a spicy, warm, slightly alcoholic addition and a long honeyed finish with hints of metallic carbonation. Slick, oily and pleasantly smooth mouthfeel. Aftertaste is sweet with toffee and bready malts, convert to a warming feeling in the stomach. Yeast does a lot of work here, without creating the usual ""Weizen"" impression. This is a warming and refreshing beer at the same time, with a great fruity body, completed by spices and a pleasant sweet finish.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

S - Floral notes, spice (cloves and allspice, cardamom) and mild fruit hints, mostly banana and dark fruits, raisin and plums.  T - Tea and banana, a subtle grain, raisin and other dark fruits. Close is lightly bitter, carbonic.  M - Crisp, clean and smart. Carbonation keeps it so easy to drink, and the ABV is utterly hidden.  O - This is a great beer that keeps its bigness well managed and controlled. Another example of how German beers deliver.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,DenverHopHead,4.33,"Poured from a bottle dated ""bottled on 8/2/2013"" into a weizen glass. Appearance - pours a dark brown, but a dark sunset orange hue is present when against the light; a huge, fluffy white head that dissipates into a thin layer that sticks around. Nice layered lacing! Smell - cloves, some coriander, brown sugar, banana bread, spice and a hint of the alcohol. Taste - sweet and refreshing like a hefeweizen, but the balance of the malts and dark fruit make this work so well! Feel - this ultimately hides the alcohol exceptionally well, considering the presence in the nose.

72,224,Fear4Beer,4.4,"Good brew! Smooth, low IBU, dark fruits, wheat, banana, spices. This was different than the Ayinger weizenbock that I've had. Beeradvocate lists this as a ""weizenbock"" but they take different approaches to the style. Excuse my memory, but the Ayinger version seemed more what I would imagine a weizenbock to taste like. This reminded me much more of a dopplebock. While I will certainly drink a dopplebock, it isn't my favorite German style (although my second highest reviewed beer is a dopplebock... go figure). If I were to compare this to Ayinger's dopplebock: ""Celebrator"" I'd have to rate this one below that beer. Celebrator is at the top of the charts. This Schneider seems like a hybrid weizenbock and dopplebock together. I can respect that. It's tough for me because I'm not sure what I should review this as. A Weizenbock, a dopplebock, or just the pure enjoyment of the beer. The thing that this beer has going for it is that it seems like a dopplebock you can enjoy all year round. Celebrator is one of those beers you enjoy during the cold months. Its meant to be drank at a warmer temperature. This one seems like it would work even during warm days because its like it is asking to be drank at a cooler temperature. idk, just my take on this beer. Good stuff!",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,louisianajones,4.25,"Poured this one into a pint glass. Thick, off white head that dissipates quickly, medium lacing. Color is somewhere between copper and brown on the opaque side. Banana bread and malt on the nose. Taste is of citrus, banana, dried fruit, malt, and a little booze with an ever so slightly sour finish. Very smooth carbonation. Catching a very faint spiciness in my sinuses after the finish. Interesting.  Very easy drinking for this level of ABV. No afterburn at all. This one half-threatens to be cloying, but the sweetness stops short of being overbearing. I do like this one. I've had some other beers from this brewery, and I have yet to be truly disappointed by one of their offerings. I'd grab another one of these for sure.",Schneider Weisse G.

Delicious.  Feel/Taste - Creamy smooth medium-full body yet crisp and drinkable, plenty of gentle carb to keep things moving. Taste is like nose but more profound: Big, fruity, sweet, and yeasty up front with ripe banana, feint spiciness of clove, fresh baked bread maltiness, some wheaty twang with hints of lemon keep the sweetness in check, a hint of grassy hay. Flavor finishes long with a very slight alcohol warmth, though alcohol is integrated perfectly with no perceived flavor/astringency.  Overall - This beer is an absolutely masterpiece. It is practically liquid spiced banana bread! It's a marvel that the 8.2% ABV is so well integrated, and this beer comes off as so crisp, refreshing, and drinkable still - dangerously drinkable. Truly a world class beer that I very much enjoyed.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

S - Strong with dark fruits (fig), yeast, and clove. Slight grassy notes, milk chocolate, and maybe leather. Intense and wonderful.  M - Fully-bodied with a slightly heavy finish, but not too sticky (trace of stickiness on the tongue after each sip).  T - Lost of sweet, dark fruits. Coffee grounds and caramel.

Big, sudsy head of small bubbles initially. Thins out pretty quickly. Not much lacing to speak of.  S-baking spices, banana, orange peel, toasted malt.  T-More of the banana comes through here with some malt sweetness to finish things out. Spice is still present, more so when yeast was poured. Sour/tartness appeared as it warmed.  M-Nice carbonation to keep it from getting too sweet, but still some almost candy sweetness at the finish. Some alcohol in the back.  O-I don't have many points of comparison here. However, I used to call this my favorite before switching to craft hop bombs. It's nice to come back around.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,WesMantooth,4.6,"Very dark orange, almost brown. Cloudy/ non transparent, with a big off white head that hangs on throughout.  Smells like sweet yeast, banana, cloves, wheat, malty mash- like a homemade bread.  The taste is sweet, but not overly so. Balanced by some slight sourness. The banana is also more subtle, does not match the aroma, (which I love), baking spices (cloves and either ginger or pumpernickel ?),wheat, and a little raisin. I also get what seems like an oak flavor. Alcohol is more noticeable closer to room temp, but not hot.  The consistency is nice. A little syrupy, but does not come across as heavy at all. Excellent beer.  Probably the best I have had in the style.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Opened with a substantial hiss, poured a deep red copper color with a nice khaki head of uniform medium sized bubbles. Some sediment in the bottle. Very clear beer.  Nose: raisins, dates, prunes, fruitcake, sherry wine, faint clove and banana. Super malty, over ripe fruit, leather and tobacco.  Taste: follows the nose but adds a good amount of carbonation. Over ripe fruit, prune juice, raisins, crazy malty. Thin mouthfeel but that's to be expected. Tobacco and leather, sherry wine.  Overall: this has held up very well over the last 6 years.

The finish is wheaty. Not bitter at all.  M - Medium heavy to thick in body. Alcohol and carbonation burn are minor.  O - Really like the taste of this one. I like the maltiness and sweetness.

Pours a light brown body the color of light cola; head starts thick but disappears in the blink of an eye. Dark plums and molasses are in the aroma.

Nice color, much like my initial review, yet the head is way thinner; still lasting. The smell also offers the same qualities, but much more subdued. The taste has some nice roasted grain and estery spiciness; some alcohol notes; tannins. Medium body; rather fizzy yet also full feeling.  What a difference some time makes. I don't know if I'm reading the date code correctly, but it's probably safe to assume that this beer is easily 9-10 months old, and perhaps that is why this experience is so different from my July 01, 2014 review. It's by no means a bad beer, but hardly meets the same ratings standard. More re-visits appear to be necessary! -------------------- The pour produced a tawny brown body with a thick, chunky head. Spicy, estery aroma; banana and rye; clove-like. Big caramel and ripe dark fruit flavors; fruitcake rich; prunes and figs. Heavy body; thick and rich mouthfeel.  A decent look, but it's the very unique and powerful aroma that immediately draws you into this beer at first. And then the rich, powerful flavors grab a hold of you and won't let you go. The flavors are deep and complex, very intriguing with wild zig-zags of sugary sweet surprises all tempered with a tempered boozy edge and and most sublime bit of hop bitterness to temper the sweet peaks. The wheat really adds a nice fruity character to things. A nice hyper-hefeweizen/doppelbock synthesis.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

This resides quickly leaving the slightly hazy, coppery brownish-ruby beer beneath.  Smells strongly of bananas, cherries, and yeast. Apples and raisins also betray subtle hints. Some caramel or toffee as well.  The first flavors are tart apples and sweet cherries. Then there'a a little bit of caramel and some dark fruits. The aftertaste is thoroughly yeasty and bready, but still retains traces of the varied fruitiness.  The body is medium to full, with fairly high carbonation that feels just right and not excessive.

No alcohol, no hops, no diacetyl. Ends quickly with a lingering sweetness. Palate medium, watery, carbonation very soft.  On the initial pour a very large fizzy head was observed (&gt; 10 cm) which rapidly fizzed itself down to 4 cm. After that the head was stable. The pour can be scary – medium brown with tons of sediment flowing by – the yeast no doubt. A decent beer but not worth the price.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Appearance: Cloudy as one would except from a wheat beer, but a brownish-purple color. 1-finger head quickly dissolved to nothing, maybe due to it's age? No lacing to speak of.  Smell: Wheat berry bread, raisins, malt, plums.  Taste: Heavy wheat and fruit up front with a slight sour citrus / peppery finish. Not a bad mix.  Mouthfeel: deceptively thin for the color and taste, very faint alcohol finish. Not too dry, still a refreshing quaff.  Overall: Not my first and probably not my last time trying this one.

72,224,Roguer,4.03,"Enormous, light tan head (not surprising for the style), with excellent retention. Brew is a dirty, muddy brown. Gorgeous form, although the opaque brew seems to be hiding something.  Massive banana nose from several feet, but accentuated by a sweet milk chocolate, thick wheat malt, cream, yeast, and a hint of alcohol. Much like a hefe, but dare I state the obvious: darker.  Dark pumpernickel wheat and sweet banana yeast dominate the flavors, with just the tiniest touch of pepper, and a major hint of slightly sour, overripe dark fruit.  Light initial mouthful, yet it quickly announces the full flavor and chewiness as it fills your mouth. Just thick enough to make you think it's chewy, but thin enough to vanish before you try.  A tasty brew, but just not light enough to fill the classic Summer role of a Hefe, and not thick or roasty enough to fill the nightcap role of a regular doppelbock.

The clove is still present at 4 years, as well as some honey sweetness. Banana notes come out as it warms.  The carbonation is spot on; light and refreshing.  An easy sipper that I must now have in my collection at home.  2007 Vintage found today at Sam's Bottle Shop in Durham. They had vints 07-10 available!  Sooo...Tons of white, foamy head up front that quickly dissapated. Quite a bit of yeast floaties.  Getting lots of raisin notes in nose and taste. Slight sweetness of honey, too.  Not a single bit of oxidation!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,porter_collie,4.6,"Poured from bottle into pilsner glass  A - Rich hazelnut body. A ivory head fizzes to the top and lingers for some time.  S - Fruity nose, particularly bananas and ripe pears. Hints of clove, raisins, hearty bread, and an earthy funk.  T - Very fruity taste initially. Like the smell, lots of pear and banana, with just a hint of cantaloupe. The malty body cascades over the tongue, reminding me of dark artisan European breads. The finish has spicy notes from the hops and yeast.  M - Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Just right.  O - Fantastic weizenbock. The darker malts give an interesting edge to a German wheat beer. Drinks surprisingly easy for the ABV. The moderate sweetness makes it equally appropriate for enjoying on your deck on a summer afternoon or sipping by a fire during on a winter eve.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,cjgiant,4.22,"Having a bottle touted as brewed in 2005, aged for 8-9 years. Having not rated in the style before, I wasn't sure I'd like it, to begin with, let alone an aged version (or maybe ill like it better).  Upon pour and what little scent I got, it reminded me of some barleywines or some Belgian dark ales. Raisin notes win out emanating from the muddy-auburn brown liquid. The taste is also of dark fruit-fig and dark brown sugar, a touch of banana and a slight tang of alcohol bite. The feel has a surprising effervescence to it, considering there was so little head or obvious carbonation in the look.  A very smooth, dark-style beer. The bitterness I normally enjoy in a beer is nicely replaced with a bite of alcohol and presumably carbonation. I expected a well-balanced beer when I saw the rating, and I wasn't disappointed.  Revisit (3/2016, bottle brewed in 2012): So this revisit is on a younger beer by about half. Ruby brown, pretty clear except for color until I throw the dregs of the bottle in. Head is a fuzzy, tight bubbled red-tinged tan that forms a thick rim around the glass. Light lacing.  Nose is a wonderful dark fruit, raisin to plum, and a little grape wine like notes. Somehow both deep and light at the same time. There's also a light wine-barrel like note as well (and maybe even the slightest hit of campfire smoke).  Taste follows the nose mostly, the raisin really standing out early. An ever so lightly singed wood note comes in next. Not as sweet as I mentioned originally, actually a little more woody to earthy spice-like.  This beer doesn't seem as rich as I mentioned above with the more aged beer. Also, my palate may be a little tired for this tasting. Carbonation is tight but tickling.  Revisit a bottle dated 16 203, 1606016, guessing June of 2016, tasted April, 2017 - so a newer version: Pours on the dark side of the classic color - an auburn beer that I didn't decant well, so it has a cloudiness to it. Head was amazing, though. There are a few clouds of lacing.  The nose fits what I thought originally - brown sugar, raisin and fig - I might even through in a hint of sweet wine grape, and just the barest hint of wheat.  Taste is similar, but adds a little banana note to it. Feel is still smooth, with a nice low-level tickling carbonation.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Flounder57,4.35,"500 ml bottle was poured into a hefeweizen glass.  Appearance: A two finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer. It is a slightly murky amber brown color with some vision of bubbles coming up through the glass. Spotty lacing down the glass as the best was drank.  Smell: Bananas, cloves, spices, caramel, loaf of bread, sweetness, raisins, grassy hops, and a little chocolate.  Taste: Hey bro, that's one loaf of bread with banana, clove, spices, grass, caramel, chocolate, and a little bitterness. Very tasty brew.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, chewy loaf of delicious bread, medium carbonation, and smooth. So enjoyable and delicious.  Overall: What an awesome blend of a dunkelweizen and doppelbock.

This is my first weizenbock. Poured from the bottle into a glass stein, this brew's got a creamy,light tan head that reminds me of nitrocanned beers with a murky,clear dark brown body. The lovely head and lacing get the majority of points here.  Kind of smells like clove&spices. I can dig it.  I taste the clove&spices, along with raisins and a hint of dark chocolate. This is kind of like an alcoholic birch or root beer in all of the very best ways. Its got a subtle cracked black pepper element about it that gives the aftertaste a small bit of oomph to Tap 6, according to my palate.  Mouthfeel is nice for this dark a brew. Not too light,and certainly not syrupy or chewy; just right.  Overall an outstanding 4 for my first weizenbock. I really the fact I couldn't much pick up the higher ABV when it came to the literal act of drinking this. But this is sure a creeper type of beer& a keeper too. I will certainly buy this brew again!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Flavors of banana, clove, raisins, light chocolate, a malty sweetness, the high abv is well masked.  Medium high carbonation, smooth and full bodied. A pleasure to drink.

72,224,Andrew041180,4.15,"A - Honestly? This is the ugliest beer I have ever poured. Like, by a long shot. It's a murky, cloudy brown. There is no lacing. The only redeeming characteristic is streaming carbonation that doesn't quit and that keeps replenishing a thin, bubbly head.  S - Really nice. Not worried about this beer anymore, despite the appearance. Nice yeasty aroma. Banana and clove. Some sweetness.  T - Follows the nose. It really covers up the strong 8.2% alcohol. Barely noticeable. Little bit of funkiness lingers on the aftertaste, but it's pleasant. I could pound a liter of this stuff, stand up, and wonder why the world was spinning.  M - Soft, with a bit of tingle. Medium-bodied and sumptuous.  O - I definitely picked the right beer. It's a great sipper and/or gulper. Lasts a long time without any kind of degrading. Refreshing, but with a little tang. Leaves me wanting more.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Forms a thin white head over low visible carbonation. Not particularly attractive.  S: Cloves, banana, and fruity yeast esters. Sweet malts, wheat graininess, yeasty and some brown sugar.  T: Follows the nose well. Sweet maltiness with fruity (banana, pear) yeast esters, cloves, wheat malts and a touch of brown sugar Fruity ester sweetness in the hang but still dry on the tongue with moderate alcohol sweetness.  M: Medium body, low carbonation sensation, moderate alcohol presence - but you can feel like you can taste every bit of the 8.2% ABV.  O: A very good beer. One that I've found strange - lots of Belgian dubbel characteristics, but the wheat malts definitely show up in the flavor. But quite enjoyable.",Schneider Weisse G.

S- Excellent. Clove, coriander, cinnamon and yeast through out.  T- Definitely a wheat beer. Slightly sour and bitter. Not the best wheat example out there. Alcohol is very well hidden for 8.2%  M- Not bad. Bit grainy  O- Pretty good. Not worth a second try really.  Food Pairing  This unusual wheat beer paired well with... Grilled cheese sandwiches!

72,224,Ryanm1,4.13,Poured from a 1 pint .9 oz bottle into a a tulip glass. Now the most interesting part is not what came out if the bottle but what stayed in it. At some point I had stored the bottle on its side in a wine fridge (for 3 months after buying it) and found an exorbitant amount of yeast stuck to the side of the bottle. Now to me this is a good thing keeping natural unfiltered flavor with the brew especially the Bavarian style. Unlike any other beer this was a cloudy chocolate brown color. There was large amount of white head when poured violently from the bottle. Hints of chocolate malt taste similar to the color. Has the sweetness that accompanies bocks but also the breast wheat vibe. Has a good balance between wheat and malt with an elevated abv of 8.2% which is barely noticeable to the pAlate.  Don't think I've had a beer of this style before. It seems like American craft brewers would have their work cut out for them with this style.,Schneider Weisse G.

Cloudy chocolate brown pour with a two finger off-white head with decent retention and great lacing.

The taste is rich and bold with tons of malty sweet brown bread. banana, plums, caramel, cloves, tobacco, chocolate, anise, apple skin, and some nice subtle citrus hop notes. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy with prickly carbonation and a creamy and slightly oily finish. Overall, another great offering from Schneider Weisse.

72,224,KFBR392,4.29,"Appearance: Head of about three fingers on the pour which was certainly present while drinking. Dark brown color. Above average active carbonation in the glass while drinking.  Smell: Medium to darker fruits explode on the front. Semi-sweet malt body. Undertones of cloves and peppery spices add extra levels of complexity. Buttery doughy malt presence really makes this a bright, breathable aroma.  Taste: Huge fruity front of plums, bananas, and purple grapes. Bright buttery bread character warms up in the body with a potent undertone of exotic spices. Waves and waves of fruit continue to wash over the palate long after drinking.  Mouthfeel: Plums and bright malt character leave a mouth watering sweetness behind on the palate. So incredibly easy drinking for a brew coming in at 8.2% abv. Carbonation plays along perfectly with this brew by bringing out some of the brighter tones.  Overall: tough to put this one down even for a second. Mouth watering fruits and rounded malt character are the highlights. The spices are present but very subtle in a complimentary role.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

A very fruity smell, bananas and raisins. Somewhat spicy and sweet, obvious alcohol in the nose. Somewhat caramelized sugary.  Sweet toward the beginning, like the fruity smell, bananas and some warming alcohol. Becomes a little spiced with a small bit of hop characteristic.

Some light breadiness. Sweet toffee, caramel, and ripe banana and a good amount of clove and spice.  The flavor follows of raisin bread and fruit cake. Super sweet ripe banana and caramel sweetness. There's lots of spice with pepper, clove, star anise.. Sweet juicy plum. The beer finishes off clean and gentle with tons of the carbonation. Quite dry on the finish.  My favorite German beer as its filled with flavor. Somehow, that makes me want to analogize this beer as a ""German DIPA.""

72,224,ONovoMexicano,4.28,"Poured from the bottle into a Weihenstephaner hefe glass.  I'm biased towards German beers s they were the first eye-openers for me as far as what greatness could be, but I like to revisit these brews I had abroad to take notes and enjoy in a more thoughtful manner. And almost without fail, all have been as good as I remember as well as beers with the quality and craft of America's more recent artisan offerings.  Without having tasted this beer yet, I was able to marvel at the way it looked in the glass. The pour produced a massive foamy head that took its sweet time to fade away and settled into a plateau shape above the beer. There's so much carbonation rising in this beer that it looks alive and the color, milk chocolate with bright golden hues at the base, is accentuated by its muddy and thick-looking texture. It looks like I'm in for a meal.  One whiff of this beer and my nose gets a huge blast of banana and clove. These two smells dominate and leave little else to detect, but I do get some nutty hints.  The front end on this is malty, spiced and clove-heavy. The banana notes make an appearance about mid-palate and then give way to a yeasty finish that seems to combine all the flavors. There's some bread notes in there too on the finish. It's not a beer that's got incredible dimensions of flavor and complexity, but it does a superb job of offering a balanced blend of delicious flavors.  I'm a fan and always will be. The beer is smooth, completely free of any hints of alcohol and offers a thick, creamy mouthfeel. It does drink like a meal. I'd skip plenty of meals to drink this with that in mind.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Many people get far more out of this beer, but this is in a class of bad-savory-tasting beers in a class I otherwise prefer. It's bizarre--I'd very much like to hear from someone who's had this or other similar beers and can clarify whether I keep somehow getting bad bottles or whether I'm especially sensitive to this flavor.  500mL / Weizen Glass",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,BlakeAJurgens,4.14,"A - Definitely not what you'd expect from a doppelbock or starkbier; poured an almost burnt orange color with an eggshell-colored head; have not yet encountered a bock with this coloring yet. The head was really nice and thick and there is a considerable amount of carbonation.  S - Beautiful wheat aroma; quite strong. citrus, banana, and raisin soon follow; the Weizenmalz and Gerstenmalz mix well and you can even get a little hop bitterness if you try.  T - The beginning starts a little light, a mix of banana, light citrus, and a nutty taste, but the wheat and malt get considerably stronger. The middle gives you a little hoppy bitterness which ends with a sweet kick of banana and clove.  M - this is arguably one of the more pleasurable doppelbocks / starkbiers in the mouthfeel department; nice carbonation, a really pleasurable consistency and thickness, with a sweet ending and a little big of sugar residue.  O - fantastic beer; the perfect balance of a refreshing hefeweizen and a strong starkbier. A beautiful beer",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,kbrokhoff,4.17,"Note: This is my first Weizenbock.  Personal Drunkenness: 0%; this is my second beer of the day, but my first was a Notch Session during an extremely large meal three hours prior.  No. of Tasting: As noted, this is my first Weizenbock, hence my first Aventinus, and first Schneider Weisse overall.  Coldness: I had purchased this refrigerated at a Whole Foods over an hour ago; it had a chance to chill next to some milk and yogurts, then sat out on the counter for approximately 10 minutes, however its coldness seems appropriate for this style of beer.  Pour: Medium, give or take.  Glassware: 14.75 oz. Porter/Stout glass (similar to a Stella glass); I realize now a Weizen glass would have been more appropriate, but as soon as I uncapped the bottle it started foaming over and the Stout glass was my instinctive choice.  Filtering: Unfiltered; murky and cloudy.  Coloring: A chocolate/coffee brown, like unpasteurized cider; it comes across more as muddy swamp water than a mouth watering brew, hence my low appearance score; not sure if this is what a Weizenbock is supposed to look like, and for all I know this is as attractive as they get.  Head: About half a centimeter after pouring a little over half the bottle; when I poured out the rest, I created a good half-to-three quarters of an inch of toasted almond colored head up to the rim of the glass, which dissipated quickly.  Summary: This beer packs a flavor punch. It can almost be described as rich. Yet you cannot taste a bit of the alcohol. There's a definite sweetness. Again, not the most attractive looking of brews, but its drinkability makes that easy to forgive. Its smell is not strong, but very pleasant with sort of combination of raisins, cloves and bananas? (I am just terrible at describing beer odors.) The glass I am using could be withholding some of its aromas. I may be writing sacrilegious nonsense, but this reminds me of the Rochefort 8 and I like this better. I recently had a Spencer Trappist Ale (see my review from yesterday) and I can draw comparisons between that beer's smell and taste to this Aventinus. There is an excellent finish with a very nice aftertaste. This is a great beer, but it is probably even better in the right glass with a slower pour and a more educated beer drinker.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

T: Again, really pronounced banana flavor mixed with wet walnuts, a flash of a dark fruit in the middle, followed by a nutty, bread, banana after taste.  M: Medium body with high carbonation that provides a consistent bite, and finishes with a syrupy exit.  O: Wow. Perfect appearance, excellent mouthfeel, and I really enjoyed the ripe banana and syrupy wet walnut tandem. If not my new favorite, it is among the top tier.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,abeeronthebeach,4.4,"Had this beer tens of times before, but this is my first time reviewing it.  A – Pours a dark, ruddy brown with a furiously effervescent head which recedes to bald batches and then baldness within a couple of minutes. Not typical of this beer, so I’ll tack this down to this beer having travelled thousands of miles.  S – Smells sweet and fruity. Perfumed-malt. Clear phenolic character. Some booze. Soreen loaf.  T – Not as sweet or fruity as the nose. Wheat, boozy malt and a semi-sweet yeast flavour predominate.  M – Fairly high carbonation makes this remarkably refreshing for a fairly strong and dark beer. Mouthfeel is bang on; it would be cloying if it were much heavier, and would fail to carry the abv., and strong malty-wheat flavours if it were lighter.  O – I’ve drunk this beer at least an order of magnitude more than any other beer on the planet. At university I’d routinely drink 2-3 of these bad boys when I’d sit down to write an essay. This beer made a significant contribution towards my graduating from that institution. Tap 6 Aventinus will always be a special beer for me and as such it’s hard for me to separate my assessment of this beer as a beer from the many happy memories it has provided me with and long nights it has accompanied me on. Funnily enough I started drinking it for purely pragmatic reasons; it provided the best balance between affordability, flavour and high abv., but over time I really started to appreciate it for the classic brew that it is.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,dcmchew,4.58,"Review for the 2008 vintage, when it was called just Aventinus. Nice head (not huge), good retention. Smells great: roasted malts, juicy plums, cherries, chocolate, banana, marzipan and vanilla. Wheat-banana-clove combo in the front, but with a richer malt character, roasted and chocolatey. Lots of dark fruit, with plum, date, fig, grapes (with a bit of the red wine feel found in the eisbock), mildly sour cherries and some acidic red apple. Aside from the caramel and some citrus peel, spices are very ""Austrian"", with nice hints of marzipan, licorice and vanilla. Low hop presence in the finish, mildly bitter. The aging really worked on this one, the warm alcohol elevating the spices to a nice port wine feel, and the malts to cognac-sherry. Expected it to be more creamy, instead it pours down a bit too easily, and has a tiny bit of unwanted carbonation. Certainly better than the usual TAP 6, but, for me, it doesn't surpass the eisbock.

Pours the same beautiful dark red/brown as the non-aged Aventinus. Smell: amazing what 6 years in a cave does to this beer. Gone is the big banana/ester/dark fruit smell that dominates the non-aged version. Now there are more malts, bread, but also a different fruity aroma more like a good wine. Taste: Wow. Just the best German beer I've ever had. More like a doppelback than a wheat beer. Whereas the non-aged version of this reminds me of a deluxe hefe, this beer reminds more of, say, Ayinger Celebrator, but so much better and more complex. Mouthfeel is smooth. No other word for it.

Pours a dark hazy 'ice tea' in color with a good 1-finger+ foamy off-white head that lasts a long time. Lots of lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is of sweet grains, dark fruit and wheat toast. The taste is even better! Wow! What a fantastic brew! Super smooth and goes down easy with NO harsh or bitter aftertaste at all! Perfect carbonation as well. Love this one!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Radome,4.73,"Served from a 500 ml bottle into a goblet.  A - Very dark brown color. It lets some light through, but this shows some cloudiness, as could be expected for a wheat beer. Head is persistent, light tan in color and appears smooth and creamy. Tiny bubbles rise continuously to the surface. Sheets of lace form on the glass when moved, but they quickly drop back into the head.  S - Wonderful aromas of earthy hops, gingerbread, molasses, raisins, plums, whole wheat toast. The alcohol is there as a sweet brandy-like note. Wow! This is extremely complex and appealing. Maybe some light cloves, but no banana note.  T - The flavors mirror the aromas. A delicious mix of wheat, warm malt, molasses, dried fruits, mild, earthy hops. There is sweet alcohol and then a medium dry finish.  M - Medium body. Smooth, creamy carbonation. Medium hops bitterness and light alcohol presence.  O - Every aspect f this beer is spot-on. A true world classic.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,bskrtz,4.45,"1 Pint/9 Ounce bottle served cold in glass beer challis.  A) Pours frothy chestnut brown mash, unfiltered and full of suspended fine bubbles. Very cloudy, short off white head dissipates quickly to leave a lacy 1/4 inch trail  S) Sweet and complex. Bananas, stewed fruit, mild spice. Classic Weisse  T) Truly delicious and very mild for such a strong beer. At 8.2% alcohol, this brew packs a punch. Raisons and dates, baked sour dough bread, banana and clove.  M) Fine bottle conditioned carbonation gives this magnificent beer a Champaign like feel. Thick, smooth and sticky, the carbonation lasts until the last drop  O) Truly a masterpiece, a fine example of its category",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,archyquaffer,4.39,"Poured from a euro-brown, 16.9 ounce bottle into a sampler. A moderate pour produces about an inch of a creamy tan head that sticks around for the duration. The beer is a murky brown with tons of carbonation. The murkiness clears up after a while, and it has a very appealing appearance despite the initial murk.  Plenty of spicy sourness wafting from the glass, including some cidery notes. Even my poor olfactory nerves continue to stand up and take notice of the yeasty aroma. I detect caramel notes at the base, with lots of effervescent spice and dark cherry-like tang, and just a touch of citrusy bitterness in the aftertaste. The tang is somewhat reminiscent of hard cider. The more I sip, the more I taste, so that eventually chocolate and nutty tones become more noticeable, along with a strong undercurrent of a Kirsch-like flavor. A bit of alcohol warming as the beer progresses. The mouthfeel is tingly and creamy.  An excellent wheat beer and very much worth a try if you want to explore the style. Wheat beers are harder for me to like sometimes, but this one is a winner. I bought the bottle for approximately 3.75, which strikes me as very reasonable. Only one store in my town of approximately 30,000 people stocks this beer. I wish Albertsons would get rid of a display case of AB product and substitute some decent imports and craft brews.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BeerFMAndy,4.96,"500 ml bottle poured into a weizen glass 8.2% ABV, 13.177 on label.  A - Dark brown in the more volumetric parts of the beer, tan-ish brown highlights parts for a nice color with a lovely gradient but, overcome with tons of cloudines, it looks like pond water. The tight, off-white tan colored foam is packed with dense bubbles, which lower slowly leaving little lace beyond one giant finger of foam behind.  S - Aventinus smells like a loaf of fresh banana bread littered with nuts and chocolate chips topped with a drizzle of caramel for subtle sweetness. Sprinkled with clove and cocoa and finished with malt-driven nuances of cherry skin and raisin, this beer has it going on with nary a trace of alcohol!  T - Doughy bread is the perfect incorporation of ""doppelbock"" into this wheat beer, and boy does it have some wheat! Thick but soft wheat maintains course through the whole beer before banana and clove yeast characteristics come through and finish with a touch of dark fruitiness, trailing off with just a subtle hint of alcohol spice.  M - Smooth and rich, Aventinus has a quick way of coating the throat with it's super-soft and creamy texture. The carbonation bubbles are small enough, it seems, to give a touch of crispness as a subtle hint of warming alcohol finishes up to complete the most perfectly drinking weizenbock.  O - Aventinus is the original weizenbock, brewed in 1907 and still king of the style to this day. It's robust German hefe aroma is perfectly paired with the bready malt profile of a doppelbock for a hybrid style that is a blissful marriage of soft and drinkable wheat with filling and complex maltiness. Like a dense loaf of Banana bread made with nuts and chocolate chips, Aventinus is soft and smooth but rich and filling with a fantastic silky, creamy finish!",Schneider Weisse G.

Smell: Dark fruits, raisins, figs. Then comes roasted, caramel, molasses wheatines. There are some spice and yeast notes. Pleasant, balanced and inviting.  Taste: Again dark fruit at start, goes to sweet, caramel middle and closes with banana esters, cloves. Hard to find any hops but there is some woody bitterness. Sweetness stays with you for a while. Alcohol well hidden. Smooth and balanced ride.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full body, almost syrupy (but in a good way). Leaves coating. Carbonation is smooth.

M- Smooth, and medium bodied. Lasting tang and spice in the finish.  O- Very flavorful. I like the added roast characteristics of this one. Alcohol is apparent, though.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,PhillyStyle,4.77,"I have to say right off the bat that this is possibly one of the best beers that I have ever had. I poured the bottle into a weizen glass and it appeared a nice dark brown color that produced an off-white/tan-ish colored, rocky, dense head that was very well retained. Loads of carbonation. The aroma was a wheat and some other spice or aroma that I could not pin down, but whatever it was really made the beer. The taste followed the nose perfectly and was followed by a nice sweet finish. If there is a better tasting beer for this style, I would be shocked. The beer had a medium body to it, it was extremely smooth, and had excellent carbonation. The only downside was that I did not have another bottle. As I said before, this may be one of the best beers that I have had, of any style. Outstanding and a must try for any BA.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,bareju,4.85,"Poured out of 500mL bottle into an oversized wine glass.  A- Pours amber-brown with white finger head that lasts a few minutes before receding to the outside of the glass.  S- Sweet banana notes - not a whole lot of smell to this one.  T- Dark fruit up front, sweet malts kick in with just the slightest bit of alcohol, banana lingers. A little bit of cloves in the middle as well. Sweet throughout.  M- Quite syrupy, coated my mouth pretty thoroughly, but not in an unpleasant way. Medium carbonation, overall pretty full-bodied, but accompanies the sweetness well.  O- An excellent beer that I will definitely be coming back to. Much heavier than the Hefe-weiss beers I've had of late. Reminds me of a bit of a strong Belgian ale, especially the dark fruit notes. Very drinkable, and a good value at 8%. Probably wouldn't want more than a 500mL bottle in one go due to the sweetness.  Edit - Had this on draft last night, was absolutely incredible. Poured a cloudy, light amber brown into a tulip glass. The mouthfeel was vastly improved, and there were some nice estery notes at the end. Much less sweet than I remembered, incredibly balanced, very little alcohol taste. I'll be hard pressed to not order this every time I see it on draft.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,CalgaryFMC,4.59,"Enjoyed a half-liter bottle on a cold winter's night. Why do I drink so much wheat beer in the winter? Denial? Anyhow, this particular selection fits the bill nicely. Pours up a beautiful reddish brown murk with ample light tan foam. Aroma grabs you by the olfactory bulbs with sweet brown apple, poached pears, molasses, caramelized bananas, and ample spice. The aroma is just a prelude. Palate is rich, full, sweet, and complex, with a ton of clove and cassia spice phenolics like its lighter Schneider weisse cousins (albeit on steroids), rich toffee, the aforementioned caramelized bananas, dates and plums, and a little wood or dry cacao powder to provide some bitterness. Chewy syrupy body stands out but the spicy punch prevents things from being overbearingly saccharine and I can certainly understand the comparisons to a Belgian dark ale. After a while all the spicy notes get earthy and bitter. Nevertheless, still has that wheaty refreshing character that you get from the best weizens. Another great ""dessert beer"", like Christmas cake in a bottle except infinitely better than the brick-hard shit that hides in your grandma's deep freeze. A world-class brew and I don't think the high ratings I have provided are too generous. If you are interested in more background info about this beer, read ""Brewing With Wheat"" by Stan Hieronymus. There are tech specs in there for this beer and Tap 7. Old school stuff.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

T- Similar to aroma, sweet banana, little clove, some malty sweetness.  F- Medium to light mouthfeel, very easy drinking for such a full flavored beer.  O- One of the best wheat beers around, lots of flavor, like liquid banana bread, yet drinkable enough to have on a summer's day.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Resilient lacing leaves a thick, melty ring behind.  S- Bright banana notes combined with some Candi sugar and rich yeast. Slight trace of booze.  T- The malty sweetness provides a nice counterbalance to the alcohol with dark fruit notes and more banana from the yeast. There's also some spice and caramel.  M- Slightly syrupy but has that refined, somewhat crisp lager feel with medium carbonation and a fullish body.

The ruby red color and little head was different. This smelled so fruity I was surprised. Had Belgium all over it which is great. It is a yeasty malty wheat beer with the perfect blend of fruit.

Very Belgian for a German beer.  m: Light to moderate. Considerable carbonation adds more bite.  o: Described as a wheat dopplebock, this is more dark fruit-yeast dominated than I had expected. Won't buy it again because dark fruit (prunes, plums and such) is not a personal favorite flavor in beer, and this was not cheap at $6 a pint. Nonetheless it was nice to try to get an idea of why it is #101 on the BA top 250.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,mdcrouser,4.38,"Had this one thrown in by the beer shopkeeper after filling a box with other selections. Muddy brown and hazy, with a solid tan head.  Ripe banana, clove, dark fruits – not unique for its smells, but rather for their breadth and depth.  Beers that ring of similar esters are often too over-powering for me, but this one is more delicate and subtle. Deeper and richer too with allusions to roastiness.  Ruminates on the tongue, waiting for you to think it’s going to explode into something more pushy. Instead, it almost creeps up on you, delivering something awesome, but almost understated.  Not my favorite style by any means, but that’s still an incredibly good beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Some wheat bitterness, but some medicinal sweetness as well from the yeast and alcohol, toasted malts, and bubblegum. Some dark fruits as well.

72,224,Slamms,4.94,"I was drinking this out of the bottle, so guessing on the appearance rank. Everything else pretty much perfect. In retrospect, I'm thinking distinct fruity floral elements? But really, the most phenomenal aspect of this beer is that it just tasted better and better the warmer it got. Its 8.2 % alcohol, so was just kind of sipping it to begin with, and it was kind of sitting there warming up a little. The initial impression is a little severe, in terms of alcohol taste, bitterness, and drinkability, but with each additional sip, it just gets better and better and better and better. The dregs was maybe the best experience of the entire bottle.  I've recently drank Piraat and Trappiste Rochefort 8 and 10, all world-class beers, and I generally prefer Belgian beers.

It tastes like spring or fall, not something for a hot day nor for a cold winter night just perfect for the shoulders  mouthfeel: stays there just long enough to be appreciated. But something I don't know what is there, like the kiss of particularly good lover. Some spices come out and say, ""Remember me?""  overall: Worth the hype. They changed the bottle that I got.

T - this beer is very nice and has a great number of tastes coming through (much more than i expected from the smell). its surprisingly refreshing off the bat (at least for me) for a darker beer and there is very little if any of the 8.2% of alcohol coming through. you can taste the typical clove and banana which is why i love these beers so much, along with a nice caramel malty flavour as it sits in your mouth. you can defintiely taste some of the dark fruit that i could smell after the pour. i wouldn't call this a summer beer but im definitely enjoying it on a nice summer day with a baguette. more refreshing than your average dark beer.  M - a very creamy taste which goes down extra smooth. medium carbonation which seems a perfect balance to the taste of this bad boy. not too much of a lingering aftertaste but my mouth is defintiely wanting more after each sip.

72,224,Misanthropy_Sipping,5,"In the world of weizenbocks, this is the behemoth of greatness...  Gave a bit of a vigorous pour and gave up a big tan head but retained a firm amount of carbonation. A deep amber brown to almost purple hue. Great dopplebock appearance.  Has an intense German wheat scent, with a hint of that bock deal going on. A bit of dried plums and a dash of spicy yeast. There is a perfect, extra ripe banana tone to this as well. A lightly sweet aroma that is rich and earthy.  Taste is fantastic. This breaks some boundaries and sets a solid ground for this style of beer. Aventinus is for dopple-weizenbocks as St. Bernardus Abt 12 is for Belgian quadruples. It's got a rich sweet wheat ale taste with plums and malty dopple-bock tones. Ripe, spicy bananas with a great clove and sharp German yeast kick. Has some hop to it that dries it up and balances with sweetness with just a tad earthy bitterness. Very rich and full flavored. The booze is slightly there but is complimented very well by the hops and bitter dryness toward the end of the beer.  Mouthfeel is fantastic as well. Creamy, medium body that is so drinkable and pillowy... Man, how can you not love this beer as a whole. Even with a vigorous pour, the carbonation maintains well into the end. Great sign of quality for me.  Overall, as stated right off. This fine weizenbock is a cornerstone. It is a beast, it is great. If you have been skeptical of German beers, if you think they are predictable and ho-hum, if you just haven't had it... Buy it if you see it, you won't be sorry.

Massive 3 finger head on top receeds quickly and leaves a massive of tan colored cap. Beer is highly efferevescent and looks incredibly rich and delicious. Head seems to last for a lifetime.  Smell - Dark fruit aromas dominate such as cherries and plums, baked goods and spices used in baked goods thrown in for good measure. Slight spiciness in there as well. Also rich malty, bready scents are huge of front and linger for the second and third whiffs.  Taste- Bready notes and dark fruits dominate again, namely cherries and plums, but also getting a little bit of pear in there. Combines for something akin to a booze infused, Christmas cake that is elevated way beyond anything tasted outside of the guidance of a professional baker. Quite a bit of sweetness (but not cloying) is apparent but blends well with the booze. I wouldn't say the booze is overwhelming, but is definitely noticeable.  Mouthfeel - Smooth, rich, creamy. Definitely not a light beer my any stretch of the imagination, but given the massive flavor, the carbonation and the overall decadence, it's not super heavy either. Decidedly quaffable if you were thirsty enough.  Overall - I think this beer might be the epitome of decadence and is probably about the tastiest beer I could imagine while enjoying desserts at Christmas time. One of my favorite beers of all time and my only complaint is that the glass seems to be empty too quickly. Wow!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

T: Once again Banana and clove is most dominant which is typical of German wheat or ""weiss"" beers. Nothing overly medicinal or fake tasting which was good. Some sweet caramel like malt was also present and provided a nice cushion for the other flavors to rest on. I found that alcohol was a bit to noticeable for my liking.  M: Carbonation is high making the beer a good palate refresher and cleanser. Body is medium and not overly thick.  O: I'm somewhat disappointed I couldn't seem to like this beer as much as other people seem too but none the less it was a good beer. It was my first wiezenbock it was just okay but nothing astounding in my opinion. I probably will revisit it again in the future to see if my tastes for it have changed.

S-The smell is lightly chocolatey with a decent bit of banana-like sweetness and barely-noticeable alcohol. The clove-forward wheat spice is well integrated with the other scents and there is a bit of lemony fruit, too.

M-The feel is soft and medium in body with a pleasant touch on the palate. Very drinkable for the ABV.  O-This is a great beer that I wish I could find more often.

72,224,magictacosinus,4.71,"Poured on tap at the Albany Taproom, served in a Delirium Tremens tulip glass. Review is from my notes.  Pours a murky, cloudy, and quite yeasty looking brownish, yet lightly tanned, caramel filled residue. Honestly, that's the best way I can describe this thing, because it's by far one of the most notoriously ugly beers I've ever seen from Germany. At the same time, it wins me over with its rustic appearance, and while this didn't produce any major or significant head here (other than about a finger, which fades away eventually), it is viscous and thick unlike any weizenbock - or, hell, any *wheat* beer - I've ever had. Alcohol legs are massive. Carbonation looks decent at best. The inner glowing amber hue in between the darkened murkiness is definitely unique. Not the cutest kid on the block, but definitely the toughest in its realm.  The aroma is by far one of a kind here, bringing forward all of the greatest aspects of both weizenbocks and doppelbocks, with some new additions to the table. Right at the front, I get juicy, booze-soaked notes of raisins, bananas, plums, apricots, grapes, and also awash with a variety of fresh, earthy, pungent spices ranging from the obvious clove notes, to rosemary, and definitely a hint of pepper at the finish. Everything then melds quite beautifully into an array of toasted, succulent, and fresh wheat malts and toasted grains to create a hearty smell indeed. No noticeable alcohol on the nose, and no significant bitterness. Very pleasant to whiff on, as these aromas all come in spades, only to be coated by the wheat and yeasty feel. Pretty much transcends the style at hand here... Absolutely one of a kind.  Yes, as expected at the aroma, this is very delicious. Huge notes of caramelized bananas, accompanied by raisins, a dried plum finish, and coated with fresh, dank clove, faint ginger, nutmeg, toffee, and toasted breadiness. Again, this being pretty much a hybrid of two styles known for big recipes, I expected to get the best of both worlds here. However, this does drink far more like weizenbock than a doppelbock overall, as is not nearly as spicy or filled with that faint smoky malty flavor that can make them more challenging to drink. Rather, it is presented with a juicy, thickened, yet crisp body of a hefeweizen, yet packed with all kinds of flavors that breeze by, rather than assault the palate. Carbonation is not as present as desired, but this is thick enough to make up for it. I'd imagine if this went flat that it'd become a syrupy, sweetened conundrum, but at that point, I'd say to use it for a cooking recipe. For a beer this strong and varied in flavors, I drank this way too fast due to the near perfection in balancing it all out and presenting it in a silky manner - but it was completely worth it.  This is definitely one of the most complex, mass-produced recipes out of Germany, and it's clear where it gets its praise from. Tons of well balanced, juicy flavors, and delicious bready and yeasty characteristics that further enhance them. Absolutely an easy beer to drink with its crisp, smoothened body, and at 8.2%, a dangerous choice at that. This is definitely something I'll treat myself more often to from time to time. Fantastic stuff.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Beric,4.76,"Serving: On-tap at the original Weisses Bräuhaus in downtown Munich. 500 mL pour. Served: June 2012  Appearance: Dark brown and hazy, actually not the prettiest beer. Sometimes you get hints of a ruby or grey depending on the lighting. Like wheat beers, this one has a nice, two finger head on it that sticks around for quite a while.  Smell: Smells fruity and sweet- hints of raisins, dates, molasses, and other syrupy smells. Definitely seems complex and invites a taste.  Taste: Absolutely incredible. Tastes a lot like it smells- raisins and dates, maybe some plum notes to up the sweetness. The beer does taste sweet- it is definitely not 'dry' in the wine sense, or like how some lighter beers or hoppy beers finish bitter. This one, after swallowing, really hits you with all these dark fruity, syrupy notes. The alcohol is masterfully hidden in this one.  Mouthfeel: The wheat and yeast make this one smooth and creamy. Feels a lot like a Hefeweizen, which makes it feel lighter than it really is.  Overall: One of the best beers I had during my stay in Germany, and one I have returned to many times since.

72,224,Jugs_McGhee,3.89,"Picked up this purported best Weizenbock in the world tonight for a cool $4.39. I'm sure it's half that price or less in Germany. 8.2% ABV confirmed. 1 pint .9 fl oz brown glass bottle with sophisticated label art and white branded pressure cap served into a conical Samuel Smith's pint glass in Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Expectations are high given its country of origin, traditional brewing methods, the style (coupled with the country of origin), and its current ratings. Bottle fermented. When I acquired it earlier tonight, it was in the store's refrigerated section - which makes me feel at ease even if there isn't a best before date. Besides, I doubt a fairly old weizenbock would drink poorly.  Served cold, straight from the fridge. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: Pours a massive head - 90% of the glass and about 8 fingers in thickness. Appearance is beautiful with a soft frothy complexion - gorgeously smooth and seemingly refined. One of the best heads I've seen in ages. Lacing is perfect, coating the sides of the glass evenly and consistently as the head slowly recedes. Retention is incredible for the ABV - about 10+ minutes. I won't be waiting that long to sip it given how inviting it appears.  The body colour is less exciting than the head. It's a dark nontransparent caramel-brown. Slight translucence, but it largely blocks out light. Solid. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show.  Carbonation seems perfect; the bottle conditioning seems to be a success. Hugely excited to try this.  Sm: Lovely nutty notes. Intoxicating bready malts. An amazing rustic wheat backbone. Fresh alive biscuity yeast redolent of vitamins and fermented grains. Fuck that wheat is lovely. Extremely subtle hints of vague dark fruit; not prune or date or most of the dark fruits you'd expect from something like a good quadrupel - more bright cherry, ripe plum, and dark apple skin. The plum in particular comes through more as it warms. Clove spice. A magnificent aroma for the style. Moderate in strength, with impressive subtlety. I can't wait to try it. Any hopping is minimal in strength and floral in character. No alcohol is detectable.  T/Mf: Shocked the plum comes through as much - and as well - as it does. The clove note is majestic here, very evocative and fresh. There's no artifice here; this beer tastes as natural as can be. Carbonation is downright perfect. The wheat foundation at the core of the flavour profile is refreshing and perfectly guides the central focus of the beer - refreshing qualities meeting deep diverse flavour - whilst holding everything in balance and lending it a natural sense of cohesion. Hints of biscuity malts lend it a bit more body and accentuate the spicy clove. Lightly nutty. No alcohol is detectable.  The mouthfeel features delightful smoothness and wetness which keeps the beer refreshing in spite of its high alcohol - which isn't at all noticeable - and its ""dark"" character - which is flavorful but never overbearing. Presentation on the palate is excellent. Body is excellent. Thickness is excellent. There's just enough dryness to coax out the flavours more, but I would like more coarseness to complement. Shockingly light and pleasant on the palate for the style/ABV.  I do get some nice biscuity yeast notes, which also add a dash of spice (and are probably the source of the clove notes to boot)  Dr: Incredibly drinkable for the high ABV and style. I'd definitely get this again, preferably a litre's worth fresh on-draught in classic German fashion. For my money, it's certainly one of the - if not the - best beers in the style. Pretty well priced as an import. Special in my mind; I don't have many traditional German beers that evoke notes of plum - or dark fruit at all. I'd recommend it to friends. Makes me more interested in this brewery.  All of the above said, it may be the best beer I've had in the style, but it still doesn't hit the upper echelons of wow-dom. It's a damn good beer, but it's not blowing my mind. As such, it doesn't quite cross into my upper ratings; an A- or higher has to be truly great and I don't give such ratings out lightly. There's room for improvement here in spite of its high quality. I remain optimistic that there's an even better weizenbock out there, but this will be stiff competition. Incredibly well-executed stuff.  B+",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,rickyleepotts,3.35,"I see this beer all the time at Total Wine, but never knew the history behind it. There is one guy that RAVES about this beer, calling it, ""the best beer ever"". Not sure it is the best beer in the world, but I am excited to try it. I like the label, too… it's purple. I bet Sheryl likes that. It's her favorite color. I also really like the name. Look for the next few bottles to be from the other side of the aisle. You need to visit a Total Wine to know what I mean, but at Total Wine, the beers from the United States are on one side, and then all other countries on the other. I will be spending more time on the other side for a while. Just to make things interesting!  In the Glass: After hearing Sheryl explain it, I am not sure I can do this beer justice. She basically said someone took a ""dump"" in the glass. Her words, not mine. I wouldn't say that, but the beer is quite dark. It also has a large head that just sits there for 5 minutes. Granted, I did a hard pour, but the head was impressive. The lace isn't very impressive considering the head, but I am not too worried about that.  It says on the bottle that this is ""Germany's original wheat-doppelbock ale"". Not a typical style for us, so let's dig in.  Nose: This smells like a spicy wheat beer. The aroma isn't all that impressive. I am impressed with the ABV on this one. 8.2 for a beer that is only $3.99 a bottle is a pretty good deal. I am also seeing, ""TAP 6"" on the label. It is on the label and on the neck of the bottle. I don't know what that means. Maybe I should Google it.  A second whiff has me smelling more dark fruits leaving with a very earthy finish. I hope it tastes better than it smells!  Flavor: The flavor is quite complex, and I am getting a lot of different flavors throughout. I am not sure where to start. At first I get typical wheat beer flavors; think Blue Moon. Then it mellows out as I swallow, and some subtle sweetness kicks in. Then plums take over. Maybe that is why the label is purple. The plums are really obvious for a few minutes, then a nice drying takes over. The finish only lasts for a few seconds, but it is a very enjoyable drink. Again, not blown away with the flavor profile here, but I am impressed with the complexity this bottle offers.  Mouthfeel: Considering the head on this, I expected more bubbles. The mouthfeel is quite nice, and slides down smooth. It is VERY easy to drink. There are some bubbles at the end of the drink, but nothing to write home about. On that drink I started to swish the beer around in my mouth a little. I plan on doing that for all beer reviews going forward so I can comment on my additional experience. When doing that here, the bubbles overwhelm the palate, but the plums really come through. If I didn't know any better, I would think they used plums in the brewing process on this one.  Aftertaste: The sweetness from the plums sticks around for a few minutes, and it slowly becomes dry. The finish doesn't last very long, but it is long enough to make me want another sip. I am drinking this right out of the fridge, and with this one, I am not sure it warming up will do much for the beer. The best part of this beer are those fruity flavors I am getting.  The guy that calls this beer, ""the best beer ever"" must not have a very refined palate. It's good, but it is by no means the best beer in the world. Actually, the best beer in the world, according to RateBeer, isn't even that good. Cool story, but quads are just not my style. They did a good job with this bottle, and I am going to look at where those plum flavors are coming from. Best part of this offering. Cheers!",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,mverity,4.93,"This beer is a long time favorite. Recently re-tried for reviewing purposes. The appearance is wonderful; nice dark caramel in color, with a retentive whiteish/cream head. Smell is wonderful, clean, earthy, lightly spiced with clove. Taste is delicious! I get clove, sweet malt, a slight licorice flavor, and a sweet yeasty type note as well. The feel of the beer in my mouth is what I remember liking most about this beer. It's very creamy and light, and leaves a smooth silty finish. The aftertaste is of ripe banana, yum.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,JonnoWillsteed,4.16,"A - Looks like a Long Island Iced Tea - chestnut-brown dark, but greyer still, and very cloudy. Most unusual.  S - Caramel and banana. Fresh made banana-loaf cake.  T - Fruits and spices the whole way through. Really fantastic. If you can have 'pudding wines', I think this might be a 'pudding beer'. Would compliment cheese and crackers very well.  O - I've been in Germany 3 years now, and this is the first time I've even heard of such a dark wheat-beer. Check it out is my advice, it's something really quite special.  p.s. As I swallow each mouth-full of this beer, I get pungent mouth-fulls of 'Christmas spicy flavours' running over the palette... This really is something special! One week left in Germany before I return to Asia: Note to Self - Must go to beer-shop tomorrow and get a few more of these in!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,trxxpaxxs,3.99,"2012 bottle, poured into a snifter...  A: Pours a super deep and dark red. It's basically a brown/black. There is a thin ring of tiny light beige bubbles along the edges of the glass that seem to stick around for a bit. Decent lacing as it drinks.  S: The nose is a mix of sweet caramel malt, dark cherries, and a touch of smoke. It's actually kind of difficult to pick out the exact scents in this beer. I get a touch of sour and some alcohol heat.  T: Hmmm. This is going to be a tough one. It starts out with a mix of malty sweet, a touch of tart, and followed by some underlying smoke. I get caramel and black sherries to start, as soon as it hits my palate. After it sits for a second, the smoke begins to turn up. It starts out small and builds until the palate it pure smoke. And yet, as soon as that happens, the sour cherries and sweet malt come right back. It finishes with a mix of all of those flavors and a good helping of booze.  M: Full bodied beer. It's sweet and coating to start, effervesces and gets stinging, but softens out in the back end. It's sticky and syrupy in the finish/ My mouth is completely coated by this beer even after it is gone. The mix of tart, smoke, and alcohol are destroying my tastebuds.  O: Wow. This is quite a beer. It seems so incredibly complicated. Flavors showing and then disappearing a second later. Flavors that shine, fade, and then shine again. Sweet, tart, smokey, and intense. I kinda like it, but I don't know if I'm fully enjoying this beer. I might not drink this beer again, but it's quite an experience.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The look is off putting (muddy water), however, that could be to my poor handling, there is a huge amount of trub in the bottom of the bottle.

Long-lasting lattice, too  The smell is also strong. It's fresh with a hint of spring fruit.  Taste: as stated above, it tastes like a Belgian. I also like the slightly acidic hoppiness to this.

72,224,deadonhisfeet,4.38,"Poured from a bottle into an Erdinger weissbier glass. The pour is a murky brown with a huge crown of dense foam that lasts longer than styrofoam. On the nose I get sweet, bready notes, banana-like esters and spicy clove-like phenols.  The beer has a medium body and a nice, complex flavor. I get nice, sweet bready malty notes up front. They are accompanied by a slightly grainy, yeasty, wheat flavor as well as some bananas, pears, lemon, vanilla, and some dark fruit notes at mid-palate. The spicy clove-like notes promised by the nose arrive near the back of the throat and contribute to a tasty, satisfying finish. Unlike the eisbock, this one seems to let the malty notes play second fiddle to the fruit and spice.  What a wonderfully complex beer. My only complaint is that it's a bit sweet and could use a bit more tartness. Nevertheless, I feel as if I could spend hours sipping on it and writing down all the different flavors I encounter. If all you drink are stouts and IPAs, you need to start exploring classic beers like this one. Pick up a bottle, close your eyes, tune out the noise, and just sip and enjoy.",Schneider Weisse G.

Opened up with a very slow gush over.  A - Pours a faintly hazy dark brown/purple color. Tons of light tan foam forms but settles down quickly. Sticky lacing. Some floating bits of yeast.  S - Huge fruit notes of cherries and raisins, brown sugar, caramel, doughy bread, and a strong banana yeast aroma. Really amazing aroma, smells like a rich and decadent dessert.  T - Follows the nose with sweet raisins and a bit of tart cherry juice balanced out by a hearty bread and caramel back bone. A bit of that banana yeast thing on the end with a quick fading bitterness. Crazy smooth and way too drinkable given the levels of flavors and the abv. Mouth feel is medium to light bodied and creamy.  O - This is a world class beer, I can't imagine a better weizenbock. Just so rich, sweet, and creamy but somehow its beyond drinkable.

Appearance: pours a dark golden brown with a head fluffing up to three fingers. The off-white head settles to one-and-a-half finger with good retention and decent lacing.  Aroma: a strong, thick wheaten malt aroma along with the usual banana and cloves. A hint of dark fruits and spices.  Taste: pretty much follows the aroma, with quite strong wheat and spice flavours. Those dark fruits and a touch of chocolate hang about too.  Aftertaste: a touch of bitterness, but the majority of the flavour is a carry-through of the wheaten malts.  Mouth feel: a moderate body with a medium- to-high carbonation that bites nicely.  Overall: a decent, strong flavoured wheat beer. A good combination of wheat malts, spices, banana and cloves and dark fruits. Quite expensive, but certainly worth it every now and then.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,StonedTrippin,4.03,"you know, because of the ratings I had higher hopes for this. its good, but it isn't standout to me from other big wheaty bocks. the pour is the best asset. its dark caramel in color with a lavish off white head thick as whipped cream and lasting forever, way above the rim, pure sex. the nose is real fruity, like apples and pears and grapes, and of course dark malted wheat and german ale yeast. flavor sees a lot less fruit than the nose, it has an almost rotting fruit taste, composty, with a lot of alcohol for the style. the alcohol is long lasting and in fact dramatic when it warms, a detractor in this context. the yeast imparts a lot of nice flavor, a little banana, a touch of peppery spice, and plenty of body. fuller, with excited carbonation and a long fruitcake finish. overall a tasty beer, and a good step in my new german beer interest, but I think its a touch out of balance, not least because of the robust booze vibe. well made but not my personal first choice.  edit: i always think this one is better on tap than in a bottle for whatever reason. the difference is dramatic at times. softer and brighter, with less of the alcohol presenting itself. still not necessarily obviously a lager with all the fruity notes swirling around, but a better overall experience i reckon...",Schneider Weisse G.

Some mild fruity esters, primarily raisin. Mouthfeel is fairly light with a smooth carbonation, but fades to flatness a bit too quickly.

72,224,tectactoe,4.09,"Thanks to Kevin for this one. Apparently this is the ""go-to"" weizenbock, much like Weihenstephan owns the title for ""go-to hefe"". Haven't had much weizenbock experience in my life, so I'll have to see how this plays out. Brown and swampy looking from the pour, hazy and cloudy all the way through with a puffy, off-white head showing nice retention and solid lacing as the beer shrinks in the glass.  Bubblegum. Yeast. Banana. Clove. Apple skins. Mild dark fruits. Sound familiar? Smells almost like a hefeweisen on acid - only with less wheat and a stronger alcohol presence. Yes, yes, the alcohol is noticeable on the nose, but doesn't really hinder at all - it only adds a bit of phenol presence. As this one warms up, I start picking up some more unique notes; mild tartness, cherries, dry wheat, spices, and light caramel. Overall, very pleasing to my nostrils, and it smells much like I expected. The wheat definitely picks up the pace a bit more during the latter half, too.  Well, well, well. Whatever bit of wheat was missing in the aroma is more than compensated for in the taste. The first sip coats the palate with a heavy blanket of wheat; subtly sweet, dry, and refined. The bubblegum-banana combo follows closely behind, and the banana almost takes on a ""rotten"" or ""overripe"" flavor profile. I know that sounds gross, but trust me - it works well. Yeasty and hefe-like all around with spices coming at you left and right. Clove, coriander, orange zest, pith, and peel, with a light sprinkling of mild white pepper covering everything. In the end, some light fruitiness surfaces; mild banana and mixed berries. Medium bodied with lots of carbonation, giving a floaty kind of mouth feel.  Hm, I still think I prefer Weihenstephaner Vitus to this beer, but there's no denying that this is still some good stuff. I don't know if I'm well-versed enough in weizenbocks to accurately rank this one among the rest, but it was definitely tasty, and dangerously drinkable for being 8.2% ABV.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,Sam21,4.21,"500ml bottle. Bottled January 3rd, 2013. Poured into Weiss vase.   A- After a careful proper pour, I am left with an opaque brown body. I don't see any sediment suspended, only murky brown. With the slightly off-white head capping things off, this is a nice looking beer. The retention is up there with the best Belgian bigs and the lacing is thick.   S- It carries a very pungent aroma of cloves, bubblegum, juicy fruit, and plenty of spiced cake notes. The banana notes are there as well, but not as forward. It's held together and balanced.   T- The flavors are very soft, balanced, and light. This is not a knock your teeth out beer, which is wonderful. It sticks close to the style. Soft fruit notes begin leading into a full fledged rye bread spiciness. It's not necessarily a rye beer flavor, but a thick chewy loaf of spelt rye bread. There are clove spice notes, yeasty bubblegum, and that underlying sweet note that carries right through. The banana notes are there within the sweetness and are overripe in nature, like that banana that almost tastes fermented and has an alcoholic sting to it. Bready, spicy, sweet, and very balanced. Dry in the finish with lingering sweet spice notes. Perhaps a touch of prune in there as well.   MF- Very soft fluffy carbonation carries a medium body that is filling AND light. It's full yet doesn't carry that syrupy feel.   O- This is a wonderful wheat beer. It's very big, yet carries all the grace of a beer half it's ABV. It's smooth, spicy, integrated, sweet, and very easy to drink. I'm drinking this beer on the couch next to my wife in front of the TV, but I can only imagine that my enjoyment of it would be even higher in front of a fire with friends and family (and of course my wife!).

A: Both are a hazy, almost muddy light brown; the flute has a 1/2-finger cream colored head, the weizen glass 1.5 fingers; both settle to a thin lacing S: Bready & fruity; more pronounced on the weizen glass. Raisin, banana, coriander/clove, and toffee all make an appearance. T: Wow. Talk about complex and balanced, right from the get-go and through the finish. Imagine crossing the best homemade raisin bread with the best homemade banana bread and adding a bit of toffee. That's this beer. It's got all of the malt from the bread, all of the spices & fruits that go into those breads, with the toffee note to round it out. Delicious. M: Medium-bodied, balanced, smooth. O: The taste and mouthfeel were similar our of both glasses; overall I would recommend the weizen glass over the flute just because the wider mouth allows for more aromatics and the larger volume allowed for more of a pour to get a bigger head.

72,224,WilliamAlbrecht,5,"Let me start this review off by saying that I am a HUGE and I mean a HUGE fan of doppelbocks. That being said, this doppelbock is rather unique. We have here a WHEAT DOPPELBOCK and a DELICIOUS one at that. I have nicknamed this beer the BANANA DOPPELBOCK BIER. I have had this beer at room temperature and cold and ICE cold. I always seem to enjoy it at room temperature more than the other methods. This beer is simply said, great. Period. I cannot say it better. It's not good, it's GREAT. It's a TRUE bock and it's heavy on the alcohol but not too heavy on the stomach!  A: Pours a solid dark brown. A very good sized head with lacing all over!  S: Smells of banana! Yes! That's the FIRST thing that hits my nose. Is that a bad thing? You say you don't like fruity beers? Well trust me, this is a DELICIOUS doppelbock! The smell is of ROASTED banana..if you can pinpoint that--and if you can't, then you have GOT to try this beer. It's fantastic.  T: Sweet caramel taste, not too overpowering and not underwhelming at all. Taste is of roasted malts and roasted banana! Wow. Roasted banana. This German doppelbock is awesome.  M: Creamy and crisp! Crisp? Yes, the water used for this brew is simply awesome. If you love beer you MUST try this bock bier!  D: Very drinkable, but be careful. The alcohol content on Schneider's Aventinus is HIGH at over 8 percent. The roasted taste will leave you wanting more. I can guarantee that. This is a beer that I always have stocked and have preserved. You should always have one in your fridge waiting for you!  This is quite possibly THE best Weizenbock you are going to encounter. As a doppelbock, I'd definitely put it in my top 5..perhaps even my top 3. Great brew  Served from a bottle...I'd love to try it on tap when I visit Germany this year",Schneider Weisse G.

An opaque light brown brew, sepia when held to the light. Patches of orange round the edges. Left about an inch of head after proper pouring, which has survived as a thin, but noticeable layer throughout. Sheets of lacing after sipping, some flecks survive. Not the most attractive brew ever crafted, but that is neither here nor there.  Nose is a fine blend of typical hefe notes (banana, cloves, coriander) with some tripel and bock notes (dark fruit, chocolate, caramel).  A wonderful blend of bock and weizenbier flavours that dance across the tongue. Chocolate and banana, wheat, malt, a touch of hops and alcohol to the finish. Like the holy offspring of a dunkelweizen and a tripel. Banana and nuts linger as the brew warms up a touch. Very tasty indeed.  Carbonation is high, but surprisingly it works. Medium bodied.

72,224,StoutHunter,4.57,"I picked up a bottle of Schneider Weisse's Tap 6 Unser Aventinus last month for $5.39 at The Lager Mill. I haven't had a Weizenbock in a while and I really like this style so I'm excited to try an authentic German Weizenbock, so lets see how it goes. I can't decode the bottling date, but I don't think it's too old. Poured from a brown 500ml bottle into an snifter.  A- The label has a nice clean look to it and the purple color is a little attention grabbing. It poured a nice dark brown caramel color that had four fingers worth of tan head that died down to a thick ring that stayed till the end and it left lots of lacing behind. This is a very good looking beer, the color was really nice and the head and lacing were perfect.  S- The aroma starts off with loads of malts that have a higher amount of sweetness to them and impart some nice bready, caramel and dark wheat aromas along with a slight bit of brown sugar. After that comes spicy yeast with cloves sticking out the most followed by a good amount of dark fruits with raisins sticking out the most along with a light banana aroma and a slight hint of alcohol. This beer had a very good aroma, it's got all the aromas that I look for in the style and I really like it.  T- That taste seems to be pretty similar to the aroma and it starts off the same with a higher amount of medium sweetness that takes on a slight brown sugar flavor followed by loads of malts that impart some bready and dark wheat flavors. Up next comes the yeast that imparts a medium amount of spices with cloves sticking out the most along with a slight bubblegum flavor. After that comes the fruits, there's some nice dark fruits with some raisins showing up, but it's the banana that sticks out the most and I like that. On the finish there's hardly any noticeable alcohol and a lower amount of bitterness with some sweetness taking it's place and it had a wheaty and spicy aftertaste.  M- Smooth, a little creamy, slightly warming, medium bodied, with a slightly higher amount of medium carbonation. The mouthfeel was very good and it was pretty true to style, I really liked it.  Overall I thought this was a very good beer and a very good example of the style, this is by far the best German Weizenbock I have had so far, it's very good. This beer had good drinkability to it, it was smooth, with lots of nice flavors to hold my attention, but it's a little on the sweet side so I think one 500ml bottle is the perfect amount. What I liked the most about this beer was everything, all aspects of this beer were right were they should be and done very well. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, I can't think of single thing that I didn't like about this beer. I would for sure buy this beer again when in the mood for a really good Weizenbock and I highly recommend this beer to everyone. All in all I was very happy and impressed with this beer, it's the German Weizenbock I've been searching for and I'm glad I finally found it. I still think I like Black Forests Weizenbock just a little more, but for being available year round and I'm sure this will be my go to Weizenbock. I can't say enough good things about this beer, it was very good and everybody should try it, enough said.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Must get more.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Ciocanelu,4.15,"Murky dark amber color with beige head. Aroma has toasted malt, overripe mushy banana, sweet wheat, soft candy and fruity yeast esters. Taste follows with the toasted malt and banana, bittersweet with a light astringency, slightly boozy. Medium plus body, medium carbonation, quite smooth feel. Overall it's a nice beer with a lot of flavor but the alcohol warmth takes a bit away from the drinkability.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,ElCommodoro,4.02,"I got this one on tap as soon as I heard the local Flying Saucer had it in stock. And it was a very good beer. But the reason I wanted it so bad was to try the original German version of Texas's Live Oak Primus. Don't get me wrong. Aventinus was good, but not nearly as good as Primus. It had a staleness to it. It didn't taste as alive and primal as Primus. It was therefore more boring. It had a good mustiness to it, but not much accompanying banana flavour that I liked so much about Live Oak's weizenbock. Still a very decent beer, though. I'll probably have it again one day. But I'm in no rush.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,wattoclone,4.68,"Exceptionally smooth, very dark brown and intensely malty with a sweetness and fruitiness that makes it seem almost like a Belgian Doppelbock. Actually, it is a weizendoppelbock rather than simply a weizenbock. Abundant apples, pears and banana in aroma and taste. Slight acidic twang mixed with the sweet roasted malt finishes it off perfectly. Cloudy and complex yet very drinkable and goes well with food. One of the best Bavarian beers available in bottles in the US it is a must try.  Bought a case of the 2015 version and found it to be boozy with less of the fruity character that was so great. I cannot be sure it is my palate or the beer, but I did find that if I cut it with about 25% of a good Bavarian dunkelweizen it was near perfect.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BMMillsy,4.08,"Pours cloudy brownish with small white head. Smells of banana, yeast funk, pears. Taste is like pear juice and cinnamon spice. Sweet but subdued. Nice wheat flavor in this with a bit of spice. The spice and fruit allow this to finish with a smooth sweetness on the palate, and crisp enough to make very drinkable. Very nice beer, and my first of the style.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,AmitC,4.53,"Bought a 4-pack of 500 ml bottles.  Appearance: Dark brown in color. Very nice brown visuals. A lot of haze makes it look almost opaque. Super thick tan colored fluffy head that overflows the Weienstephan glass the beer is poured in. A lot of suspended yeast is left at the bottom of the bottle, i would be more careful with next bottles. It needs to be stirred and then poured. A good amount of bubbles are seen rising up. Looks magical in the traditional weizen glass.  Aroma: A good amount of bready and caramel malt. Huge on fruity esters. Good amount of clove phenols. Some dark fruits and raisins may be. No hops. Very subtle hint of alcohol. Sweet wheat like aroma is very apparent.  Flavor: Very complex. Good mix of sweet wheat, some banana and clove phenols. Yeast is apparent. Unfiltered. No alcohol felt while drinking. Very slight chocolate and coffee flavor. Slightly sweet and dry in finish. Absolutely rounded and grounded taste.  Mouthfeel: Medium-full to slightly full body. Somewhat creamy and a little warming. Moderate carbonation. No observable astringency as such. No apparent hotness due to alcohol.  An excellent brew. Drinks really well. Makes you love wheat beer.

72,224,teromous,4.26,"The bottle says 120515 I suppose this means May 15th, 2012 is the bottle date.  A: Medium to dark brown depending on where you see it in the glass. Very hazy and looks a lot like black tea. White fluffy full head which looks great, accompanied by great lacing. Really wonderful looking beer.  S: I get some spicy scents like coriander and pepper. A wood lacquer smell to it, with some fruit like a date.  T: Very sweet tasting without tasting like syrup. Each sip gives different flavors with different complexities which is nice. Sometimes I get some grain flavor, some fruity fig flavor floats back there, and a bit of alcohol flavor mixed in with clove. Some plum flavors on the side of my mouth. A little bit of cardboard flavor so perhaps some oxidation? Lots of mellow phenols. I feel that it is important to note that this is a very clean tasting and clean feeling beer. It's not muddled with flavors.  M: Fantastic mouthfeel. It fills the mouth up in all corners, and fits like a glove. It is very easy to drink, and in no way feels like a &gt;8% beer. Very mellow in the mouth without any bitterness bite, carbonation bite, alcohol burn or bite...just a very smooth drinking beer.  O: Overall I really enjoyed the beer. I thought it was nice and mellow with a lot of flavor. It's one of the few beers I've had from Schneider Weisse that still tastes very good when imported...if not the only.

Nice two finger head with an dirty offwhite coloring and smaller crisp looking bubbles. Full sticky lacing.  S - A lot to take in. Uncooked sourdough, banana, toffee, dill, citrus champagne, and some mixed spice.  T - Sweet malts up front giving a slight brown sugar taste. Settle with a spiciness like clove bubblegum. Washes clean with a slight citrus bitter that leaves the palate clean.  M - An extra medium body with full carbonation that tickles the tongue. Leaves the mouth feeling refreshed. The strongest aspect of the beer for me.  O - A true standard bearer for the style, and very enjoyable. It's complex in nature but balanced perfectly. Way too easy too drink for the ABV. It could be dangerous!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,barczar,4.3,"Pours a murky deep caramel brown with a solid 1 and a half inch khaki head that lingers indefinitely.  Aroma is comprised of fruity yeast esters, wheat, and caramel malt. Apple, pear, and banana are complemented by brown sugar, coriander, and clove. There's also a citrus presence.  Yeast esters and alcohol dominate the flavor profile, which is slightly oxidized and phenolic. Pear, green apple, bubblegum, clove, and banana accompany a bready wheat and malt backbone, fairly tart, leading to a slightly peppery dry finish.  Body is slightly full, with fairly high carbonation. There's significant alcohol warmth.  A delicious brew, warming and flavorful.

It fits the description of a weizenbock perfectly. The only flaw i can think of is strictly personal preference and no fault of the brewer (though the label say banana so maybe it is) this has more of a bubblegum aroma/flavor and i love a banana aroma/flavor. Either way its awesome and i highly recommend it.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,TappaKeggaBrew,4.22,"A: Cloudy, orange-brown, with the tallest head of caramel-colored head I've seen on a beer; it lingered well, and lacing was decent.  S: Complex aromas: sweet & citrusy fruit, banana & alcohol esters, cloves, pepper, and a couple of herbs I couldn't quite place.  T: Sweet, fruity malts up front, and they dominate for a long moment. Spicy notes of pepper are there, and then mild bitterness from the hops that fades rather quickly.  M: Moist at first, with good carbonation. Slightly chewy in the middle. Just a hint of dryness in the finish.  O: Not an every-day beer; this is one for special occasions. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Although it married well with a plate of Currywurst & Spaetzle, I enjoyed it more after the meal, when I could focus on its flavors without distraction.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,Makkara,4.4,"Ah, amazing brew. One of my most often bought products of the beerworld.  The appearance is a orange-brown body, with a medium head, around 2 fingers. Aroma of banana and yeast definitely, something else too that I can't quite put a finger on. Very tempting.  Taste is strong, very strong, banana and a slight alcohol (definitely not too much, just right) and some clove.  Mouthfeel is light, soft carbonation and this stuff goes down easy. Maybe too easy, you get hooked on this stuff.  Overall, one of the best beers I've ever tried. I recommend this to anyone, fan of weizen or not.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Raven3464,4.35,"Appearance: It pours a hazy brown body with a foamy two finger head.  Smell: Clove and wheat aromas are powerful during the initial pour. Banana and darker fruits like plum are noticed more as the beer settles and warms.  Taste: Ripe bananas, sweet malts, cereal, and clove are noticed right away. There is a grassy taste not evident in the smell which shows up nicely with the plum notes a few seconds after the sip. This is very well balanced and the alcohol is well hidden.  Mouth feel: It is medium to full bodied with a good carbonation punch. The beer is very refreshing and incredibly easy to drink for a brew with an ABV over eight percent.  Overall: I do not drink this style often to be honest but this was a great experience. The complexity and balance of this beer is incredible and I hope to have it again.",Schneider Weisse G.

Wonderful smells, superb mouth, excellent balance. You know you've had a big beer after drinking it, but while it's going down, the alcohol is not over-powering at all. As good in the bottle as it is on tap. Prost!  EDIT: Had 2003 vintage on 1/16/2013. Smooth, much lighter than fresh. Good with food. Not nearly as banana-y :) new vintage, but still good.

72,224,IPA35,4.44,"Being a fan of the Eisbock I now finally get to try this. Half a liter bottle, cold cellar temperature.  A hazy brown beer with a rather big foamy off-white head. Good visible carbonation.  A fruity beer, you can smell this is a wheat beer ofcourse with big banana aroma's and some clove. But it is also a dark brew with caramel malts and darker fruits (figs indeed).  Yes, this tastes similar to the Eisbock. It is less intense in flavour, it has more easy to drink, less alcoholic (in the taste) and less syrupy. A combination of delicious dark, fruity maltiness with the spicy banana characteristics of a fine Weizen. Alcohol is still noticable.  The mouthfeel is full. My judgement is clouded as I am comparing this to the delicious Eisbock too much, prehaps, and it not nearly as full as that one or other high ABV beers like RIS's but this is full bodied. Quite heavily carbonated actually, but hey this is a Weizen remember, that's good!  Overal a fine Weizenbock. The Weihenstephaner Vitus dissapointed me last year and since I have been a little afraid to try the style but since this is the basis for the Eisbock I had to try it. I was not dissapointed. A damn fine brew.  Recommended, almost as much as the Eisbock.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Some lacing.  S: fruity malts (fig, very ripe banana) and yeasts  T: wheat cereal and again, like the nose, super-ripe banana, fig; some spice, like you'd taste in Christmas/Thanksgiving meals - clove, coriander, allspice; hints of dry cocoa and vanilla extract  M: super creamy and smooth; carbonation felt more subtle than it looked - extremely easy-drinking  O: Wow.

Poured a dark red brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount very quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, banana, spices, milk chocolate, and sweet fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, dark fruit, milk chocolate, spices, banana, fruit, grain, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The age really did a lot of good stuff for this one if I am honest. The flavors were quite complex and the aroma had really developed into something special. The alcohol aspect was completely gone and made this one really easy drinking for something with this ABV. I suggest setting a few of these aside to age in your cellar if you have the patience as this one was awesome at 6 years old.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,Darkmagus82,4.3,"Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass  Appearance – The beer was served as a hazy medium brown color with a thin off white head. The head had a moderate persistence fading to leave a nice level of lacing.  Smell – The aroma is heaviest of a brown bread smell with tons of darker fruit notes. For the fruit, raisin, plum, and a lighter cherry flavor are all there. With these aromas is a good hint of booze and a light amount of yeast and banana.  Taste – The taste begins heaviest of the darker fruit flavors of raisin and plum with a more subdued brown bread taste mixed within. As the taste advances some light banana flavors as well as a wheat and yeasty flavor coming to the tongue. Toward the end, a pleasant warming alcohol flavor comes to the tongue, leaving a nice sweet warming taste to linger on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the thicker and fuller side with a lighter carbonation level. The overall mouthfeel very nicely compliments all the dark fruit and yeasty and light boozy flavors very well.  Overall – This is one tasty and very drinkable brew. It is renowned for a reason. Very well done. Tons of great flavor and an overall joy to drink.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

T: Bananas, cloves, some malt and hops, good spiciness coming through, quite sweet with some hints of a light chocolate.  M: Smooth, with well balanced flavors that really get into the mouth. Refreshing character not typical of a higher ABV beer.  O: A well balanced, tasty, uncharacteristically refreshing beer that's comparable to Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier but with a bigger alcohol kick. Looks dark, tastes light. Nice. Definitely can't beat the price.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Serious complexity in the nose. Smokey, grape, raisin, red apple, alcohol and port wine. It's a mess of stuff, but it all works.  Whereas the scents were fairly acute, the tastes are more subtle. The dark ripe fruits are present and accounted for, and the alcohol follows suit. There's a slight wheaty twang in the finish that leaves me licking my lips a little.  It's got a fruity sweetness, a bit of wheat tartness for balance, and some alcohol heat to clean up the leftovers in the finish, along with that wheaty twang to make the lips smack. Full bodied, lots of ABV, but still very easy to drink.  Overall it's a damned good beer. I'm warming up to the Germans. Fairly inexpensive and packs a good punch, along with a lot of flavor.

Decent carbonation. It looks like a gummy coke bottle.  Smell: Chewy banana bread and bubblegum. So much bubblegum. Big biscuity malts. Sweetness is bready and sweet. Caramel. Nice snap of wheat. Distinctly estery with a cooked banana backing. Clove is a nice backing aroma. Incredibly fruity. Some lightly roasted malts. Vague chocolate hints as well. Decidedly yeast heavy and fruity.  Taste: Big yeast hit up front. Clove and ripe banana. Nice backing malts. Sweet caramel and bready as can be. Bubblegum topping. Wheat, chocolate covered whole-grain crackers. Vaguely grassy. Some lingering spiciness. Slight bite of alcohol with a building estery thing. Nutty and slightly roasted. Lots of great malt flavor. Some big fruitiness leans toward raisins and red apple. As it warms the yeast and alcohol begin to dominate and complexity falls off a touch.  Mouthfeel: Pretty close to full with a sharp, snappy carbonation. Dry and lively. Coats the tongue, but not in a syrupy way.  Overall: I kept picturing a wheat cracker covered in caramel and chocolate. That is this beer.  Lots of flavor.

Get a nice twang from the wheat, also some red fruit character. This sucker can hide alcohol very well.  M - Medium-Full body, Semi-sweet, Light carbonation.  O - The appearance of this beer let me down, a gentle pour left me with no head whatsoever, but this style should be billowing with carbonation. The smell definitely showed off a nice ester profile and left room for some malt to shine through. There was nice layering to the taste; I could taste malt, phenols, and wheat at different times which is a great and elongated flavor. Had the correct body and sweetness but did lack on carbonation.

Some underlying caramel as well that I imagine will become more pronounced as this warms up. I’m also getting something reminiscent of root beer.  T: Mmm...nice. Starts watery and light then brings on a full wave of flavor mid-palate and in the finish. More flavor than a standard hefeweizen. You get all the bubble gum, bread and clove plus sweet caramel notes. There’s also a vinous quality I’m having a hard time defining.  M: Watery at first, then some alcohol when the flavor kicks in.

Appearance – Pours a dark brandy-like clear brown color with a thick creamy head, which slowly fades to a thin layer that stays with the beer, and a medium lacing that slowly drips back into the beer.  Smell – The smell is heavenly. A wonderful spice (maybe clove), vanilla, honey, and a sweet sherry-like booziness that all goes well with a heavy wheat beer base.  Taste – Taste is similar to the smell, but the honey is replaced with smokiness.  Mouthfeel – Smooth and dry; slightly less carbonated than I would have preferred. Alcohol is very well hidden.

On the pour its strong with wheat and fruity tones. The appearance is a cidery cloudy brown with a small head and carbonation. However, the taste is really where this beer jumps out. Initially I had a strong fruity and alcohol like flavor, but it finishes with a sweet molasses taste. I would recommend forming an opinion as you get deeper into the beer because after sitting for a bit the flavors seem to come out stronger. Overall, you can certainly taste the alcohol bite, but it adds to the three different tones to this. fruity, alchohol bite and molasses finish. Its a must have for variety, however, I don't see it as a beer you can spend the night putting down.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

I don't want to say plums or raisins because then you'll think of prunes and old people who take a lot of laxitives. It's a mature fruit smell. There. Brown bananas about a day before tossing into the trash. Sweet.  It's malty, yes. But not in a way that upsets me. I abhor malty beers. This latest spate of wheat beers has been a unique kind of malty though. A dancing tingling across the mouth. There's a lot of body here. The alcohol makes its presence known. Not with a shout or scream, but more with a firm handshake. It has the expected clove flavors, but much more muted than a lighter beer.  The first few sips I was quite overwhelmed. It's a proper complex beer. 10 minutes later the glass was empty though, and I couldn't believe it. Keep an eye on this one. It'll have you pounding the glass without even realizing it.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

S: Banana, clove, fig, wheat, caramel.  T: Warm, toasted wheat, caramel, banana, plum, and light fig.  M: Medium, creamy, and not clean.

72,224,mick303,4.48,"Poured into a flute glass. Nice pillowy/puffy head of light tan foam, which has a highly impressive retention. Beer is a dark chestnut brown to it. Active carbonation.  Nose is quite light. Achieves a nice balance of the fruity and wheaty notes. Just a light spiciness to add a refreshing edge, enticing.  Very big on the palate. Taste is of dark fruit, cherries, mango, with a syrupy edge. Bready, sourdough, grainy flavours come though, touch of chocolate also. This has an incredible depth and complexity, while maintaining a nice harmony. Has just a slight harshness but is very drinkable.  Very big mouthfeel, dominated by the boozy wheaty fruit. Quite thick. A bit syrupy and very full. Finish is pleasant and allows the bigger flavours to pass, leaving a yeasty, husky feel.  Certainly an experience, and a worthwhile one at that. A great beer and solid style. Dynamic and interesting, certainly quite a big beer, but was happy to spot this one in the LCBO and would pick it up again.",Schneider Weisse G.

A: Pours with a large, billowing tan head over a cloudy chestnut liquid. The head has good duration but leaves little lacing.  S - Plenty of banana and yeast, but nicely rich and complex. Other components include prunes, raisins, dates and other dark fruits and spices. Although the beer was not real cold to start, the aroma still improved with warming.  T: Similar to what the nose implied, this beer is a rich concoction of dark fruits and spices. The banana and clove are more prominent in tasting, but dates, figs, raisins, and prunes still make an appearance. Finishes with nicely balanced mix of spices, yeast, caramel, banana, and bready malt.  M: Creamy smooth with a body that is closer to full than medium. Medium carbonation.  O: not my style of beer, but easy to see why this is considered a world-class weizenbock. It is in fact the best I've had. The fruitiness and complexity make this one seem somewhat similar to a dark Belgian brew.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Wheat and caramel malt flavor up front with a caramel finish that is slightly dry and a hint of hops. Very nicely integrated and tasty. A wonderful wheat beer. Edited 9/12/2012 Review of a special bottling of 2008 Aventinus weizenbock, bottled after 4 years of cellaring by the brewer. Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a dark reddish-orange amber with a half finger light tan head and lacing. Same appealing aroma of caramel malt with some spicy herbal elements. Flavor is nicely integrated wheat and sweet caramel malt with malty, somewhat dry finish with light hops. This bottle has a silky smooth, creamy body with excellent mouth feel. I increased the mouthfeel rating on this from 3.5 to 4. Since this aged version was bottled at the brewery, it probably should have a separate listing (I see other 2008 reviews here that are probably from this bottling), but will review it here for now. A great ale that obviously improves with age.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

This beer is very bready, has a lot of dark fruits and a caramelized taste and feel. This beer has a rather smooth feel but is still a rather massive beer. There is a slight sour bitterness to this beer that seems a bit out of place but doesn't hurt the beer, rather then set it apart from the others.

Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Converge,4.26,"500ml bottle poured into a 23oz weizen glass.  A - Pours with a massive, billowing head of light tan bubbles. Deep chestnut hue with ruby highlights. The head doesn't last long and within a few minutes disappears entirely, leaving no lacing whatsoever. Definitely a letdown in this department.  S - Immediately complex. A barrage of dark fruits, spices, and earthy aromas. Dried plums, figs, medjool dates, dark raisins and pumpernickel upfront. Bits of banana, molasses, and clove are present as well. Rich boozy sweetness, with bready malt, candi sugar and a Belgian-esque yeast strain. Deep and inviting caramel presence permeates the whole aroma; sort of the kind you taste in dates. Subtle notes of dark chocolate, almonds, and a mild fennel/licorice linger nicely.  T - Much as the nose implied, this beer is a rich concoction of dark fruits and spices. Dates, figs, raisins, and dried plums. Lots of bready malt, tasty yeast and wheat in here, maybe even some rye malt (pumpernickel?). Finishes with a kick of spice along with boozy sweetness, caramel, dark chocolate, banana, fennel and cherry. A touch less complex than the nose had me thinking, but this brew is still well deserving of the reputation that precedes it. Finishes dryer than expected, with a subtle bitterness and long-lasting aftertaste. This really reminds me of a flavor profile for a Belgian dubbel, with the dark fruits and residual sweetness.  M - Mouth-filling from the first sip. The body is quite thick, with low carbonation throughout. While the alcohol is detectable in taste, it leaves zero warmth in the finish. Doesn't take long for this one to coat the mouth and become rather sticky, which I love with a big, dark brew. My only gripe is that the carbonation feels a little too low.  D - It's easy to see why this is considered a classic brew by many. Just an all around well crafted, and deceptively drinkable German beer. Although, as mentioned before, this is fairly similar to a Belgian dark ale or dubbel. While this brew brings to the table what most other darker German beers do, it has a greater depth to the profile, increased complexity, and unique subtleties that really separate it from the pack. This definitely won't be my last Aventinus.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Lots of banana kick off the aroma with some clove and pepper, backed with a caramely malt with a little tinge of copper. Surprisingly Belgian Double-ish. Very smooth flavor. Caramel is the backbone with sweet chocolate and estery lightness. Banana and spices are there, but a bit muted from the aroma. Feel is a lot lighter than I expected. This ends lighter than it starts, which is something I've never experienced. Dry finish.  Very interesting. I'd like to try this aged a few years.

Roasty malt and hints of vanilla as well. Alcohol is almost unnoticeable.  M: Creamy and full mouth with ample carbonation. Very easy drinking. Great yeasty finish.

Nice bottle presentation too with the strong purple and gold label.  Smell: Banana and clove, some caramel and sweet almond (like a slight hit of almond extract). A little vanilla, like in a good bourbon.  Taste: Chocolate, banana and sweet caramel are the prominent flavours on the first sip. Those can be really heavy flavours, but the beer remains very clean (more like a wheat beer and less like something heavy like a stout that might share those flavours). There are lots of little notes of things (some rum butteriness? some bourbon vanilla?) which take some time to unravel and require several, several sips. It's a very understated beer, but it's got a lot to offer. It's one of those beers that you could spend the whole time looking for different flavour combinations and have a good time doing it - but, it's also the kind of beer that offers a great easy set of flavours to match with food or relaxation.  Mouthfeel: Crisp carbonation the second it hits your tongue, but after that it's very smooth and creamy. The burn from the alcohol is a little out of balance, slightly too strong, but aside from that it's great. As you drink the alcohol burn feels less out of balance.  Overall: A beer with a lot to offer. Its a classic for a reason. There is no reason not to try this beer if you can easily find it. It's even something to look for if it's not in your area.

Pours a brown, mahogany color with over an inch of fluffy, light khaki head; moderate retention and a small amount of lacing.  The aroma is of clove, wheat, banana, light lemon and orange citrus, some caramel, date, raisin, and even a bit of toasted sugar. Regardless, the more traditional wheat and clove aromas dominate the nose.  The flavor brings out similar notes, with more emphasis on the caramel and darker fruits. A bit of apple pulls through, and there’s still the noticeable lemon and orange citruses. Banana, clove, wheat, straw, and a bit of earthen grass are all present as well.  Mouthfeel is relatively light bodied and very lively from the carbonation. A refreshingly clean finish keeps one coming back, and the absence of alcohol from the flavor or finish is also commendable.

S: Plenty of banana, cloves, and bubblegum with an additional twist of caramel/toffee and some dark fruit. Unique, to say the least.  T: Aside from the typical weizen-esque ester flavors (banana, clove, green apple), this blends in a darker malt note, giving it a more savory feel and taste over a hefe or even a dunkel. The finish is crisp and very fruity, without being exceedingly sweet or tart. Decent complexity and balance, with excellent drinkability and no palpable alcohol taste.  M: Very well carbonated. The yeast gives the body some heft but never weighs the tongue down with excessive astringency, which is exactly what this kind of beer should do. Slight finishing dryness.

Taste begins with strong clove and banana changing to some dark fruit; plums and a pretty strong cherry flavor. A little bit of pipe tobacco comes towards the end finishing up with a passing taste of alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth and a little sticky at the end.  Wow, this is an amazing beer. It really surprised me in that the alcohol is very well hidden and it is a truly refreshing beer. Wonderful combination of flavors going on. I'll have to pick up another bottle very soon.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BerkeleyBeerMan,4.7,"Appearance: Deep unfiltered reddish brown. The body has a nice sheen. Long lasting khaki head.  Smell: Yeast is the major player in this bottle fermented bock. Clove, vanilla and big fruity esters come to play. Plum and pear. Bouquet of Candied sugar, light caramel and bread from delicately roasted malts. I also pick up aromas of scotch and rum.  Taste: Sweet and soothing. Cola-like. Tart fruitiness. , orange and cherry. Finishes dry and grainy with notes of cocoa. Spicy.  Mouthfeel: This feels great in my mouth. It is much finer than other weizenbocks. It is almost liquer like. Silky and and smooth. Touch of grain and long finish. Spicy and tingly, slight touch of alcohol.

T - What the hell is this! I have never ever tasted something like this before. This is different. All kind of flavors are coming directly after each-other, similar like a jawbreaker.

Sharp and yeasty aromas. There is a strong base of roasted malt, but a sourdough yeast on top of it. Sweet and sour contrast is very striking. Sitting with it a bit longer gives me some ripe banannas, and some spice rack elements. I could just sit here and smell this all day!  First sip enters relatively sweet. Bananna flavors to match the aromas at entry. Sweetness holds up through the swallow, but still exits pretty dry. Medium carbonation. Thinner mouthfeel than I expected... this is medium bodied. Not much of a tipoff to the high alcohol. Sour yeast from the nose isn't as prominent in the flavor. Instead, it is balanced in among the maltiness.  Overall: A! will be back...",Schneider Weisse G.

Sweet malts with a hint of dark fruit (cherries, fig, and plum) and yeast.  M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly thin...

Body ranges from a darker red/brown towards the top of the glass to a lighter orange/golden color at the bottom. Lots of carb working its way through the glass. Spice, a fruit aroma reminiscent of Belgian brews, banana, caramel, chocolate. Fruit and spice hit big. Slightest hop bitterness. Malty sweetness. Detectable alcohol but it is very minimal. As I drink all these different fruits pop in my head. You could prob write quite the list if you think about every sip. The flavor complexity on this thing is mindblowing. Med-full body. Slight tingle from the carb. Easily my favorite German beer.

72,224,Hopdaemon39,4.12,"Poured from a .5 liter bottle into a pilsener- pours a dark brown, slightly hazy, with a a one finger head, quick dissipation, and a ring of foam around the edge.  The smell is wonderfully inviting- rounded alcohol note, dark fruit (dark cherry?), and a nose-full of sweet, dark malt. Yeast comes through as well.  Very sweet- the malt really dominates this one (as it well should). A little cherry, a little red grape, just think sweet, fruity, and dark. The yeast comes through much less in the taste than the smell, so it's almost unnoticeable.  I don't think I've ever said this before but maybe it's too carbonated? Pretty prickly for a doppelbock. However, that subsides to a mild prickly-ness after ten minutes. Medium to full bodied. Great beer- if I feel like a dark German lager though I""ll turn to Korbinian.",Schneider Weisse G.

S: Onscenely fruity and spicey, with banana, raisin, honey, baking spices and rum-like alcohol.  T: Mirrors the nose, but with more complexity. Big dark fruit flavors lead into banana and clove, with some brown sugar and carob. A little herbal-ness just before the dry, spicy alcoholic finish with residual banana, brown sugar and rum flavors. Coats the mouth with it's deliciousness.  M: Medium-heavy body with a persistent, tight carbonation which lends it a creamy mouthfeel. Malt flavors coat the mouth as I said before, and leave great residual flavors along with some dryness.  O: What a beer. Been dying to try this for a long time and it certainly did not disappoint. Although I'm not sure if this is better than Vitus... it's damn close! Either way a terrific weizenbock. I've had the eisbock version but I think I like this better.",Schneider Weisse G.

T: Toasted wheat, cloves, pear, waffle cones. Finishes with a banana chocolate flavor that lingers on the palate.  M: Deliciously smooth. The light fruitiness lends itself to a creaminess that blends well with the warmness of the ABV.

Aroma- A dominant malt aroma starts this one off. Has a clean feel all the way through and a light but noticeable grape note. Nice!  Appearance- Pours a 2 finger head that is frothy and stays for a solid amount of time. Has a layered looking, caramel color body with semi-clarity. Leaves tons of lacing behind.  Flavor- Tons of rich malts and a light toasty background makes up this tasting. A ton of prunes and plums come up on the palate afterwards (more of a mouthfeel attribute but still enjoyed it in the flavor). Has a light bitterness level, light hops, and a sweet finish.  Mouthfeel- Medium Bodied, Medium Carbonation, Smooth, and leaves TONS of plums and prune character on the palate. Malts also stay around for a while.

Mid-range lacing.  S: Lots of fruit up front. Banana, pineapple, pear, cloves, figs, raisins, prunes and maybe even some melon? Some brown sugar and caramel rounds it out. Almost smells like rum.  T: Again, boatloads of fruit. Strong yeasty bread combines with lots of dark fruit from the nose. I'm getting banana, raisins, cherries and cloves mainly. Touch of brown sugar in the finish.

I poured the bottle into a weizen glass.  A: Pours a nice dark brown. Under a light it shows a reddish/orange hue around the edges. Head dissipated very quickly but maintains a lace around the rim.  S: Very Malty with a dark fruity nose to it with a hint of banana  T: The 2004 has a much maltier taste than the 2006 I recently enjoyed. I am going to attribute this mostly to the fact that there is very little carbonation at this point. The lack of carbonation seems to really bring out the caramel in the malt.  M: Very little carbonation at this point in its life. This is both a blessing and a curse. While i believe the mouthfeel suffers because it becomes extremely smooth almost to the point where it is syrupy... However, it does bring out other aspects of the flavor (the malt) that I never have picked up in this oft-enjoyed beer.  O: Definitely a great beer. One of the best Weizens around. Very (dangerously) drinkable at upwards of 8%. However, I would say that the 2006 definitely is a better vintage to be enjoyed at this point in time (2012).",Schneider Weisse G.

As the beer lingers there is a nice amount of grain too.  M: This is a very smooth beer with a nice amount of crispness on the back of the throat and tongue.  O: This is just an awesome beer.

Amazing armoa from the second i opened bottle.  Taste - Huge grape/apple and yeast kick this off. Caramel, sweet malts, almost wine-like in mouthfeel and sharp grape bite.

Mild malt flavor, then plummy dark fruit kick, then straw, then a hot hint of alcohol. A little sticky sweetness to the finish.  It warmed a little as I drank it, and I liked the cooler version more.

Possibly the first true german beer I've ever reviewed (waited &gt;200 reviews to finally do one)  Appearance: A dull reddish-brown with a tight, foamy head of approximately 2 inches. The head dies down, but leaves a consistent blanketing and laces nicely. There appears to be a nice layer of sediment at the bottom as promised by advertised ""original bottle fermentation"" on the label.  Smell: Huge notes of clove and banana...wait, is that overused to describe german beers? There's also notes of dates, fig, raisins, bubblegum, acetone, and tobacco. Yummy.  Taste: This beer kind of tastes like root beer? There's incredibly strong yeast character, malty sweetness, and an undeniable cherry. The hops are tame and secondary to the yeast and malt. This is definitely a beer you can drink easily and the alcohol is almost completely hidden.  Mouthfeel: Big carbonation + medium body + well masked 8.2% abv = gulps not sip...then regretting your actions later. The flavors are ripe and dark, but leave no gross aftertastes. I'm really digging the clean simplicity of this beer.  Overall: Very easily obtainable (in fact there are even wrapped 2006 bottles sitting on the shelf I could try) and affordable beer.

Pours a root beer or cola brown with a fluffy white head of about 3 fingers in depth. Pours somewhat cloudy. Beer coats the sides of the glass nicely.  Smell consists of banana and clove drizzled with caramel. I can also smell some vanilla and nutmeg.  Taste is an avalanche of malt up front with requisite banana and clove flavors and some caramel and slight chocolate flavor mixed in. Produces some rum-like flavors. Some other ripe fruits seem to be in there as well--figs and or apricot? Definitely some warming alcohol flavors on the tongue. Strong and nourishing. Finishes with some touches of vanilla, and light chocolate from the malts. As the label suggests, a nice balance of ripe fruity spiciness and notes of chocolate. A wheat beer and a bock beer blended together and given steroids.  Mouthfeel is very smooth and packs some heat. Almost a bit like syrup. Substantial body to this weizenbock. Finishes clean.  Overall, a great choice for getting you through a cold, dark winter day. I have not had too many of this style. Probably this one and Victory's offering.

Head is much tamer than your average weizen and slightly off-white, within minutes the head is more or less gone reducing to a ring. Smell is weizen yeast, spices, ripe fruit (or even dried fruit, with a dark malt in the background and a good amount of sweetness. As it warms a bit of alcohol becomes the initial smell. Taste is fairly boozy and yeasty with a good amount of sweetness, spices, some dark dried fruits emerge (thing raisins or prunes). Mouthfeel is medium-light, heavier than a weizen and medium carb, some mouth tingling and an ever so slight burn from the alcohol. Also a bit dry.  I'm a big fan of hefeweizens but not too crazy about this one, the alcohol is very apparent in the beer and takes away from the delicious fruitiness of the complex yeast. Drinkability is lower than weissbier due to the high alcohol. On the plus the darker beer brings out some interesting smells and tastes of dark dried fruit that you don't get in the lighter hefeweizen. Despite the aforementioned negatives, I do like the beer, just not something I would get very often, just too boozy. A weizen for the colder months.",Schneider Weisse G.

Edit: OK the above review was from an on-tap experience two days ago. Now I'm having it out of a bottle and it tastes much more like its own animal than like a dark Hoegaarden. Still some of that wheaty taste, but not nearly as pungently Hoegaarden-y. Tastes more like its own thing, almost like they aged it and it became more mature and some more sweet notes developed.

No lacing and after a bit it looks rather dead.  Smell - A combination I've never smelled. Hefeweizen fruitiness balanced with doppelbock deep caramel. Lots of banana and clove and a smell I can pinpoint. Some reviews say bubble gum, but I'm not convince that's entirely accurate.  Taste - A more accentuated combination than the aromas forebode. The flavors blend more cohesively. Banana, clove, that undefined sweetness, and chocolatey caramel all in one flavor. Really a great flavor. It doesn't really transform into anything, but the flavor is great.  Mouthfeel - So it's not light, but it isn't heavy. The flavors make it feel extremely drinkable, but the body is substantial enough to prevent me from really downing it. Remarkably easy to drink, though.  Overall - I am really surprised by how good this is. I didn't know what to expect from a style I've never had, but it's quite tasty. I look forward to trying the Eisbock.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,flyingpig,4.3,"Light brown colour with a large, three -finger sized head that is a brownish white in appearance, foamy in texture and has very good retention.  This one is much like a traditional hefeweizen in smell to begin with, there is a lot of clove and banana along with some nice spice and a hint of bubblegum. In addition to this there is also a light caramel aroma.  Banana & clove flavours with some bubblegum. There is a bit of grain and alcohol in the taste too as a result of the 8.2% abv. but this doesn't negatively affect the beer too much. There is a hint of caramel and a mild bitter end.  Smooth and well carbonated with a creamy, sweet feel to the drink and that it went down rather well.  This one had a good wheat taste with the caramel complimenting the banana, clove and bubblegum flavours very well in both taste and smell. It was a great beer and the huge 8.2% abv. was mostly very well hidden.  1001 Beers to try before you die: http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,zeledonia,4.85,"Bottled January 2011, I believe. Enjoyed 2 December 2011, reviewed from notes.  Pours a deep dark brown, much darker than I expected. Clear at the edges, and light reveals a chocolate brown color with reddish highlights. Massive creamy yellow-tan head, very slowly relaxes to a nice cap. Little lacing  Smell is deep, smooth, and delicious. It starts out powerfully yeasty and bready, but as the head relaxes, the sweeter malts come through. Brown sugar, figs, and a touch of cocoa. So much going on, and all in perfect balance.  Waves of flavor flooding through one after another. Starts out rather light and wheaty, then a load of sugary fruity malts come pouring in. A pinch of clove comes through late, adding yet another layer to the already complex flavor.  This has one of the most unique mouthfeels I've ever encountered, and it's exquisite. It's surprisingly light for such a strong beer, and the carbonation is incredibly buoyant. The beer feels like it fluffs up in the mouth, becoming spongy and foamy, carrying the flavors away. Magnificent. I'd give it a 6 if I could.  The key word for this beer is depth. It has so much, in the appearance, the smell, and the taste. And despite all that, it has a refreshingly light mouthfeel that keeps it from being burdensome or weighty. A very impressive beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,JohnnyHopps,4.75,"The bottle in question was cellared for about two years. It may be handy when shopping for a bottle to know many currently on the shelves of stores are already somewhat aged.  The beer pours a murky shade of brown that makes one think of staring into a muddy pond. It gave an off-white head that had some staying power and left some lacing.  A smooth and sweet malty aroma tickled the sense of smell on initial observation. It is only a gateway to the sweet malty flavor to come. Though this is very warming, one must also note that the beer it smooth, thick, and even chewy. The after effect is a warming sensation that charts the path to your belly.  Clearly, this is a sipper to be enjoyed with friends. If you drink too much on your own, you risk losing appreciation of the beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Beer is a dark brown, but when held up to te light has a really pleasant garnet/dark copper look. Clear but hazy. A round and inviting looking beer with many tiny bubbles rising from the bottom. Head retention is decent and the bubbles slowly work their way down the inside of the glass into the beer. If head ever disappears it only takes another swig to bring it back. Nice looking beer.  S - pleasant biscuity yeast aroma with hints of clove and dried fruit. Some bubblegum as it warms. Aroma is not a wow, but it is good.  T - starts and evolves like the aroma, but more intense. Cloves and dried fruit into bubble gum. Very enjoyable. I'm preferring the flavor after it warms up a little. Even warmer and some apple cider makes an appearance.  M - nice and creamy at first. Little watery as you swallow, but overall this is a nice pillowy beer.  O - a great beer that must be tried at least once. I have had this a few times before and this is the 2nd best I've had it. Best was on tap at Wurstkuche in LA in the proper glass. Worst was from the bottle into the wrong glass at home. The glass makes a big difference apparently. Try this beer.

Big aroma of bread, chocolate, and caramel as well as fruity notes of light banana, and of course some spicy clove mixed in for good measure.  Alcohol is noticable and warming at first sip. As in the aroma, stong flavors wheat and caramel dominate, with a light chocolate zip to it. Banana flavors are there from the yeast but a more complex fruitiness is apparent much like plums and a hint of apricot. A persistant spicy clove flavor really helps balance out any harshness from the alcohol but without taking center stage. Definitely a full bodied beer.  Overall one of the best beers I have tried in a long time. Its hard to find a flaw in this one. Complex yet very approachable...and delicious.",Schneider Weisse G.

The aroma is full and rich, no need to get all that close to it to catalog it, but you'll want to anyway.  The flavor is wonderful. Bold, rich weizen flavors with some sweetness that's countered very effectively by just enough bitterness. Just a little roastiness adds another dimension.  The mouthfeel is just a little thinner than I'd like in a 'dopplebock' type beer but the carbonation is very nice - not too prickly but with enough fizz to cut through a pretty potent flavor profile to get the mouth ready for more.

72,224,claspada,4.39,"2004 Bottle. Apparently Schneider had been recently releasing cellared versions of this beer which is awesome. More room in my basement... I found it at the store for a reasonable $6.99. They also had the '05 and '06.  Poured it carefully as there was a boat ton of yeast at the bottom which has settled over the last 7+ years apparently, still some made it in. Color is a clear dark amber/light brown with nice dark amber hues along the edges. Very very small off white head that quickly recedes.  Aromas begin with rich notes of toasted wheat bread, caramelized banana and light clove. As it warms you get some light spice, fig and orange. There is a nice ""aged"" malt character made up of complex dark fruit smells that you can get with some cellared beers or certain old ales. Notes of sherry and red vinous notes emerge as well.  The tastes begin with toasted wheat bread, vanilla and light spice. As it warms you get more complex flavors of banana, clove, cinnamon, and the figgy/raisiny dark fruitiness. The flavor profile is subtly sweet highlighted by the dark caramelized malt flavors, no hop flavor to balance but it is nowhere near cloying, which I attribute to the lager yeast helping to dry out the flavors.  Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with medium to low carbonation, but given the age of this beer, I cannot complain and it works here. Drinks like a nice light wine almost. Finish is nice and malty yet crisp from the lager yeast and cellar aging.  Overall, this is another example of why properly cellaring bottle-conditioned beers is a great idea. When this beer is fresh I find the yeast flavors to be too dominant with way too much clove, banana and spice, but here they play a lesser role to the dark fruitiness and the caramelized toasted malts. Really well worth the $7 outlay and I will definitely be purchasing this again (in bulk) next time I see it.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

There is the taste of dates, citrus, and something herby that I cannot identify. The taste is very strong.  M: Slightly viscous and extremely carbonated.

A good bit of banana, some dark fruit, toffee, and caramel. Dark fruits include fig and a little raisin.  M: Medium bodied, smooth, and on the crisp side. Finish is slightly sticky.

The dark fruits and cloves dominate but are all slightly rounded and nothing seems to overpower the rest, great depth with a slight sweetness and a dry finish - all this without tiring the palate. The mouthfeel is creamy and very nice. This is a great beer! The alcohol is hidden and no doubt this is a well made beer overall. Add to that the fact it's widely available and reasonable priced make me think this will be added to the lineup often.

72,224,thehyperduck,4.41,"500 mL purple-and-gold-labelled bottle. I've never had a Schneider & Sohn beer I didn't like, so I've been anticipating this one for a while.  Pours a muddy brown colour with some amber-copper highlights. Solid two fingers of creamy off-white head on top, retaining quite a while and leaving behind copious quantities of lacing on the sides as it gradually dies down to a half-finger cap. Lots of banana in the aroma, probably more than any wheat beer I've had previously. Plenty of yeast, wheat malt and clove in the nose, as well as some raisins and plums.  I honestly wasn't sure what to think when I took a sip of this; I knew I liked it but there was just too many different things on the palate to pinpoint anything specific. Giving it a little more thought, the usual sweet-ish wheat malt, yeast and banana flavours are pretty dominant, but there is a lot of dark fruit character as well (raisins, plums, figs and dark cherry come to mind). Some chocolate and molasses underneath this, with plenty of spicy clove goodness. Earthy toward the finish, where the ethanol heat becomes noticeable, but works with rather than against the other flavours to give it a drying finish. Not particularly heavy for a beer of its abv; I'd call it medium-bodied. Reasonably mild carbonation gives it a light bite, with a silky-smooth mouthfeel much like their flagship hefe.  [Updated Aug 3 2016]  Another bottle, cellared for over a year (dated from Mar 2015) and served at cellar temp. Banana candy and plum pudding on the nose. Intense banana flavour, with raisin, fig and a pleasant, almost rum-like booziness on the back end. I love this beer - it has been one of my favourite German beers since the first day I tried it, and I really wish the LCBO would make it a year-round offering (like their Tap 7 Hefe). One of the premier examples of this style, and highly recommended.  Final Grade: 4.41, an A grade.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BedetheVenerable,3.7,"Presentation: 500ml slimline brown pop top Euro bottle...nice, classy label...some kind of dating code which I can't quite decipher.  Appearance: Hazy sienna beer, with high levels of carbonation and an ivory cap which shows good retention.  Smell: Lots of banana, but not sharp or over-the-top, as in some weizen beers. Hints of dark wheat bread, and a wonderfully soft, sugary sweetness in the background. Just a hint of the alcohol on the nose, and a light spicy note.  Taste: My first thought is that there's definitely more alcohol on the palate than is suggested by the aromas. It's not hot, but this beer's strength is clearly present. Soft flavors of banana and wheat, a bit of sweetness as well.  Mouthfeel: Soft and luscious  Overall: It's tasty, but the booze is a bit more present than it would need to be, strictly speaking. Also, while the flavors here are nice, there's not a ton of depth. Not a bad brew by any means, just not what I expected, based on the reviews.

T - The taste is complex and hard to describe, but the initial taste can be broken down into the following flavors: plum, apple, pear, cinnamon, allspice, orange, banana. From there the flavor progresses into a malty, bready flavor that's actually quite nice on the back of the tongue.  M - Smooth with medium carbonation. Tingles only slightly and is not overpowering.

Aroma-Toasty bread and light chocolate, bananas, clove spice, and plum. Big melaniodin notes up front with chocolate chips, prunes, and perfumy alcohol on the backend.  Flavor-Sweet bread with a dab of caramel, followed by toasty melanoidins and a hint of cocoa powder. The mid-palate sports clove and slight pepper spice notes, with a faint banana character and some dark fruits to boot. The finish is quite dry, with a healthy dollop of perfumy, yet spicy alcohol. The aftertaste blends the dry alcohol with that sweet toasty malt, and a hint of dried fruit adds a subtle point of complexity.  Mouthfeel-Medium to medium full body, with soft, nearly effervescent carbonation on the palate. Feels almost creamy/smooth, very nice. Moderate alcohol warmth on the back of the tongue and throat.  Delicious, hefty, and yet somehow refreshing, even at 8.2% alcohol. A better weizenbock than this, you will not find.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,jtierney89,2.65,"Very dark in color, pours thick, and has an oddly bright white head for such a thick beer. Smells of dark fruits, plums, and sugar.  Up front it tastes of barley, and dates but the swallow finishes with a wheats taste which clears up the sweetness that would normally persist from such flavors, a very nice balance. Goes very well with sushi!  Nice beer overall, id definatinely give it another go  After finishing the bottle, I noticed the upfront sweetness of the beer starts to build and kit gets sweeter as you sip, not something I enjoyed",Schneider Weisse G.

Poured from bottle into Aventinus tall glass a wonderful caramel color with a good amount of dense tightly condensed head of effervescent bubbles. Taste of malt and a very floral and carbonated burst of flavors all at once with a smack of warmth from the alcohol, but remarkably smooth and totally drinkable which can be a dangerous combo as I have had more then one or two in a sitting and found myself feeling no pain.

It's a dark brown, cloudy beer with thin lacing, decent head. Smell is all ripe fruits, malty notes, and spices, with a whiff of booze in there too.  Spicy, dark flavor, nicely malty, somewhat sweet. Booze is noticeable but not overpowering. Nicely yeasty, the banana/clove taste of lighter wheat beers is in here as well.  Good carbonation. Full mouthfeel, somewhat creamy, very pleasing. Booze in the finish gives some warmth.  Like I said, this is the best and most complex example of this style that I have tried and the one that measure all others against.

72,224,draheim,4.45,"500mL bottle (code10.207 2 / 0393 2823) poured into a weizen glass. Pours a beautiful hazy copper-brown color with a ridiculous off-white head and cascading carbonation. Head condenses to a thick rocky pillow of foam that recedes slowly. Big pockets of air develop within the massive head around the sides of the glass; frothy lacing forms in its wake. There's a bright amber glow where the light reflects up from the bottom of the glass, then the beer gets darker as you reach the top. Just a gorgeous beer to behold.  Aroma is overripe bananas, sweet malt, clove and other spices. Nice fruity, floral aroma with a hint of yeast.  Taste is a mouthful of spotty brown bananas, sweet bready malt, raisins, yeast, and spice. This is the definition of mellow. Nice clean mouthfeel that leaves a pleasant sweet aftertaste. The high ABV is hidden extremely well.  Overall this is just a wonderful, special beer. I would love to get this fresh on tap some day.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

A single finger remained for the duration of my pint. The beer itself is a deep brick red with raspberry notes, kept alive by gentle but plentiful body carbonation.  S - Banana and clove, oddly enough, hint this dark-looking doppelbock. It also hints to lighter fruits, such as peach, as well as deeper, wine-associated fruits, like plum or blackberry. Soft vanilla notes come in with the yeast.  T - A lot of wine flavors - dark fruit, tannins, boxwood - ride in with a cascade of dark malts, full of fig, raisin, and sharp, toasty wheat. Not burnt, but certainly caramelized. This one, for me, is a standout example of the “big beer.” It does nothing to hide its higher ABV, its assortment of malts, and its minimal, neutral hopping. A very traditional, from-the-earth type of beer.  M - Round, tangy, with a sudsy sort of carbonation. Boozy without being aggressive or undrinkable, but certainly a sipper.  O - I wish there were more doppelbocks like this. Very true to style, and very true to its composition. I find many doppelbocks too heavy, lacking finesse. Or, on the other hand, too far crafted into a malty wheat that it becomes a bad spinoff. This is a pinnacle of style that reminds us of the spectrum big beers have to offer.",Schneider Weisse G.

The nose is overwhelmed by a vertiable fruit basket filled with apple, pear and banana; all of which is shoved up the nose. Meanwhile, the unsuspecting palate is being seduced with the comely welcome of toasty malt assisted ably by its' short and stocky friend, the innocent plum, who has, in return. brougt along his honey - that is the sweet nectar that is manufactured by horny bees.  The balance is magnificent; well crafted with some random shots of sugar and malt thrown in for good use.

Smell: Slight booziness through sweet banana, clove and yeasty esters. I also get a moderate amount of prunes, figs, along with unfiltered apple cider type breadiness.  Taste: Again, short lived mild booziness followed by banana, clove spiciness, Belgian yeast, bready, unfiltered apple cider, raisins and prunes, finishing with a mild booziness that you barely notice due to the abundance of flavors.  Mouthfeel: This beer had a very appealing soft and creamy texture on the tongue with the perfect level of carbonation to blend all of the flavors to perfection. Extremely smooth finish.  Overall: You really can’t tell it’s an 8.5%’er. I staring at my empty glass, which happened quicker than I originally thought it would. Here I sit wishing I would have bought a second bottle. I figured being an 8.5%'er, this would take me longer to finish, but I couldn’t wait until the next sip so it went down with ease. This is an outstanding Weizenbock beer. Too bad I can’t find it around in a 1/6 keg. I would easily invest the money in this one. For now, the 16.9 oz. bottle will have to do, which for around $4.00 a bottle, it's money well spent.

Really, the spice and the sour tinge dominate. It's unimaginable that this beer is 8% alc. It's wet and leaves no burn. Easy drinking, but in that light I'd really rather a fresh Hefeweizen.

The kind of beer you don't mind smelling for a while before you finally dive in.  Lively and prickly with carbonation, yet silky smooth at the same time. Bubblegum transitions to juicy citrus, which ushers in assorted baked fruits. Add a dash of cloves and the mix brings to mind a nice cobbler. Banana bread, rumcake, warming alcohol in the finish.

72,224,SubpoenaDeuces,4.05,"Schnieder Aventinus, Weizenbock/Doppelbock, 8.2% abv  A: It has a deep brown amber almost brown ale color with a certain muddiness to it. The bottle conditioning yields tiny bubbles with almost no lacing.  S: Sweet figs, brown sugars, roasted oats, and some dark fruits similar to a Belgian tripel.  T: There is an almost tart sweetness at the forefront. The bubbles are tingly and almost sour with the dark fruits coming through like a deep burnt wheat finish. It is strange how many genres this covers without being a strange cuvee of some sort. The dark fruits are still present but its is almost more blackberry or a sweet pecan syrup taste to it.  M: The mouthfeel has some good coating but with a strange tingliness to it. This is not a light wheat beer finish but it is not heavy similar to a dunkelweisen or a thin porter, it has a strange distinct nature to it. It is likely perfect for the style, but essentially I am not a huge fan of this style I suppose or perhaps I am just uneducated with regards to the variety of examples of this type of beer. That being said, this is still a delicious beer but I would have a hard time pairing this effectively given its strange hybrid of sweetness and tartness.  D: This is exceptionally drinkable but seems more suited for fall weather than long sessions in any form of hot weather. The sugars aren’t overly filling like a Belgian tripel but the strange crispness doesn’t make it bothersome. I couldn’t take on more than a pint of this but it was an enjoyable fleeting experience.  Narrative: Gretchen Dulceberg’s candy business was in dire straights. For starters, opening a confectionary boutique in rural Utah was bound to cause some problems with the Mormon populace. Second, the recession hit the gourmet fusion sweets market especially hard. The average blonde haired blue eyes Utahite would saunter in with a sweet tooth for a simple Snickers or a Chic-O-Stick and be welcomed with Truffled Cocoa with dried ahi tuna or muddled marshmellow foam imbued with beef stock marrow. The price of Gretchen’s goods would leave a sour taste in the mouth of the most proper Latter Day Saint. Ultimately, Ms. Dulceberg’s sweet tooth was too obtuse for the average Mormon, but in Dresden, this place would have been a dunklesmash.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,UCLABrewN84,4.17,"Pours a murky iced tea color with a 2 inch light bone head that fades to a small cap. Small swatches of lace drip back down into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, dark fruits, and spices. Taste is of clove/spices, wheat, and dark fruits. There are some slight vanilla and chocolate flavors too. This beer has a high level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer and the first of the style I have had. I would get this one again.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,BeerForMuscle,4.22,"Reserve bottle 2007  A - Dark maple syrup brown body, with a big styrofoam head leveling down to meet the beer. No settling needed in this low turbidity pour. Lots of rising bubbles.  S - Sugar sweet brown raisins, brown sugar, maple syrup and molasses. Sweet rum like alcohol and pure sticky fig sweetness in the nose. Rubbing alcohol and warm caramel.  T - Complex and delicious as always, this beer has seemed to mellow out over the years. Noticably less rich and flavorful. The beer is still great, but it seems to have lost some bite. The alcohol has calmed down alot, and the flavor profile has died down some, leaving this beer more human. More bitter and wet tasting, with the bananna, toffee, and malt sweetness muted. Watered down compared to a fresh one.  M - Wet up front, with a slight touch of alcohol. Faintly semi dry finish, but a pretty whistle-wetting brew here. Smooth and clean as always.  O - Ok so still an awesome beer, BUT not the bite you get from a fresh one. Thoughts of mild Belgian dubbels and dark ales coming to mind.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Well, now, I have a finger of light-tan head with decent retention in light of the heat and humidity. Color was a slightly hazy deep amber. Nose smelled heavily of red grapes, like a preparation for wine and now I was shaking! Mouthfeel was smooth and the nose had nothing to do with it. This was a semi-sweet beer with an alcohol content that would put any of us on the road to perdition. Finish was deadly smooth and all of a sudden, I felt the urge to operate heavy machinery. This may be the devil's work!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Some numbers on the back of the bottle, but nothing clearly noting a date.  A - deep brown and cloudy - looks thick! Fluffy light tan head of a couple fingers lasts a few minutes that leaves patching lacing.  S - heavy yeast odor with just a hint of smoke and dark fruits. Slight nutty elements as well as it warms.  T - very smooth with initial bitterness balanced by delightful malts. Lots of dark fruit at the end, but never really becomes overly sweet. Hint of spiciness at the end.  M - medium thickness with small amount of carbonation but an effervescent finish. Alcohol is really well hidden.  D - this is a great, classic beer. Many could go down easily in a night.  One of the most famous Weizenbocks doesn't disappoint. Complex, but super-drinkable. A must have beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Knapp85,4.35,"This beer poured out as a really muddy looking brown color with a big fluffy tan colored head. The lacing looked promising and stuck around for most of the beer. The smell of this beer was really nice, had some soft wheat aromas mixed with some dark fruits and some spice. The taste of the beer was really great too, the flavors of clove and banana, sweet dried dark fruits and a nice wheat backbone. The beer is pretty light feeling despite the color. Overall I wasn't expecting to enjoy this beer as much as I did! What a nice surprise here. Can't wait to drink it again.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,zac16125,4.02,"500ml bottle poured into a chalice Lots of numbers on the back but none that I can correlate to a born on/freshness date  A: Pours a cola colored brown, with a huge 3+ fingers width of bubbly off white colored head, which dissipates down to nothing pretty quickly considering how large it is, and leaves no appreciable lacing. Lots of carbonation bubbles rising to the top throughout the entire drink.  S: A nice, complex balance of sweet and spice. The sweetness is mainly of the ripe dark fruit variety, specifically fig, along with some mild caramel malts. The spice is present with heavy clove characters, and a peppery aroma as well. There is also some bready yeast, subtle citrus, and a mild alcohol presence on the nose. Nice.  T: There is a malty sweetness throughout, but not of the dark fruits that were present on the nose. Some caramel malt flavors are noted, but mostly it’s a non specific sweet character. The flavors are just too subtle for much to really stand out. I do pick up some banana and bready yeast on the back end, but the flavors are just so much lighter than the aroma implies. The taste is not nearly as complex or enjoyable as the nose.  M/D: Tons of carbonation and a very light mouth feel make for a bad combination. But its certainly easy to drink I guess, and there’s no hint of an alcohol.  O: Overall I was pretty disappointed. It certainly wasn’t bad, but it didn’t live up to the hype. I did, however, make the mistake of trying the Aventinus Eisbock before I had this. The Eisbock is fantastic, and this just seems like a version that was way too watered down (which I guess technically speaking it is a watered down Eisbock) and overly carbonated. I don’t see myself trying this again, its just too light for my palate. The Eisbock, however, now there’s a beer I can’t wait to have again.",Schneider Weisse G.

Spices, banana, sweet grains, and breadiness. Has a bit of that banana bread flavor. Boozey taste is present but not too overwhelming. This one reaches a nice balance of flavor while not having too much spice flavor to it. Overall, its not a style I often have but this is certainly one of the better Weizenbocks out there. Worth grabbing for sure.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,mmva321,4.94,"Pured into a pint glass.  A: Pours a dark brown/copper color that is very dynamic. Reds, yellows and browns make up the body. There is also lasting and foamy off-white head that leaves a dissipating lacing.  S: The aroma is a pleasant surprise from such a dark, harsh looking beer. It's sweet in a way. Clove touches the nose first and malts make up most of the aroma. There is a heavy earthiness to it all but the smell is weightless in a way with notes of banana and citrus punctuating it. There is also just a perfect hint of alcohol completing one of the most well-rounded but unique smells I've ever experienced.  T: Complex and transcendent. Immediately contradictory but upon reflection, complimentary. Dark and heavy with alcohol notes, but also fruity and light with malts and banana giving this beer a robust sweetness that isn't sugary or overbearing at all. A little funk, a little hops complete it all.  M: Rich, smooth, light, carbonated, it's really just perfect. There's a little bit of alcohol burn that I want to take points off for, but it is really fine and maybe even beneficial to the feel. I'm usually more harsh on feel, but this leaves me with no room to complain.  O: There are no complaints here. Aventinus is complex but immediately enjoyable.

Carbonation is shooting up like champagne. The appearance of it just sitting in the glass told me it would be a great beer.  The smell was amazing. I smell cloves, banana, alcohol, and vanilla. The flavors really balance out.  The taste is just like how it smells. I taste the bananas, cloves, some raisins, and a little bit of alcohol but not much.  The mouthfeel was full and creamy, but in a good way.  Overall this might be one of the best beers I've ever had. There are so many flavors and the spices really balance each other out.

And then the cloves, followed by the smoked ham and all the correct esters and phenols in a weizenbock. A little alcohol comes through, though.  The initial taste resembles a strong dark belgian ale, with phenols and solvents no brewer in the lowlands would be ashamed of. Then arrives the wheaty tastes and reminds me this thing comes from Bavaria. Cloves strike again. Maltiness arrives last and confirms the dark color of the beer. Bitterness virtually nonexistant - just as it should be.  Body is firm, with wheat proteins and esters building it up, and carbonation, although slightly lower than the average weissbier, lightening it up.

72,224,jamescain,4.42,"Poured into a weizen glass  Appearance: Dark brown with light brown to yellow hues around the edges. The beer is topped off with a white fluffy head that remains throughout the entire beer drinking experience.  Aroma: Banana, clove, vanilla, bready, earthy esters, but banana and clove dominate. A lot of malty sweetness with a hint of citrus.  Taste: Sweet, yet still balanced, bready with a lot of banana and clove again. The 8.2%ABV is not detectable, which makes this beer easy to drink.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with more carbonation than you would expect from a higher ABV beer. The extra carbonation makes the beer more refreshing and easier to drink.  Overall: Very good beer. The balance of flavors and aromas are perfection for the style. It was surprisingly refreshing, but the ABV reminds you at the end that this is not a summer easy quaffing drink. Pinnacle of the style in my opinion.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Hopfenpeter,4.7,"I feel like back in Germany! The beer pours a beautiful cloudy brown with a tan creamy head building up, about 4 fingers thick. Of course you have to use an original Weizenglas in order to achieve the right environment. Smelling the beer, the banana, clove and vanille flavors invite you for the first taste. Tasting this beer, the doors open to a very vast complexity of flavors. Up front a fruit ensemble of banana, peach ,orange , raisin and apple will sweeten your palette, to be balanced with the perfect amount of a variety of malts and yeast. At the end you finish with a bittersweet lingering of wheat, citrus, hop combination. Someone really could go much deeper into this rich, but perfectly balanced variety of flavors. Very drinkable beer. What a great job and a must try beer!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Taste is very fruity, picked up bananas, raisins and orange. Picked up various spices as well as malt, wheat and vanilla. Very flavorful beer. Surprisingly light-medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Aftertaste is spicy with a lingering taste of the various fruits above.  One excellent wheat beer. Not only is it flavorful but it's smooth and easy to drink. Can be rare, so don't pass up an opportunity to try this.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

S- Dried banana, cloves, crushed black pepper, vanilla and honey. Nice sweet maltiness. Really nice subdued citrus nose.  T- Tasty, bright wheat. Banana bread, spicy clove and pepper. Little bursts of citrus, vanilla, star anise and cinnamon... but it always comes back to the Banana/walnut bread!!!  M- Nice carbonation, layers and layers of flavor! Sweet, spicy, citrusy, bready!

S - The sweet aroma of bananas, clove, and a hint of raisin fill the nose. The smell was sweet, but not overwhelming in the glass. Great balance in the aroma that really added to the anticipation before the first taste.  T - The taste was even better than the aroma. Sweet banana, clove and caramel came together in a perfect balance. Never did the sweetness, clove or alcohol overpower each other. I would never have guessed this was 8.2%.  M - More carbonation than it appears with a medium body as expected of this style of beer. Remarkably smooth mouthfeel and a moment of fleeting bitterness gives way to a lingering sweet and smooth aftertaste.  O - The balance of this beer is really impressive. This beer has a rich taste with dark fruits, bananas and clove that all play gracefully over your palate just long enough to keep you wanting more without overstaying their welcome and overpowering you. This beer is excellent and dangerously drinkable at 8.2%.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

T: Sweet apple, pear, and peach on the front end. The wheat is mellow, but not tame. Big and flavorful, but smooth - that's what I love in a bock. The booze is sour at times - I'm not sure I like that. The wheat picks up for the aftertaste, showing signs of banana and raisin.  M: Carbonation is there, but doesn't overwhelm the feel. Smooth, like a bock should be.  O: A very well-crafted beer. I never thought I'd be fond of really yeasty brew, but this is a thing of beauty.",Schneider Weisse G.

Getting some cinnamon and spice along with some raisons. The flavors are all very distinct but mix harmoniously  A little more than medium with ample amount of carbonation that tickles the taste buds with each sip. Very warming and leaves a distinct aftertaste with each sip that keeps you wanting more.  This is a fantastic beer. I'm sitting on my patio with the grill lit and enjoying the weather.

The taste is very pleasant and it's interesting how the clove & fruit linger in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is medium, dry and well-carbonated.

I could certainly use a little more ""zing"" to liven this up a bit more and subdue those strong spice notes.  Moderately high carbonation, rich velvety medium body.

72,224,JohnnyS17,4.84,"Well, here I am stuck in my apartment on a Friday so I can pack up for a move. I made sure to buy a new beer to try to give myself a moment of procrastination zen. Enter Aventinus.  I do not have the crazy Aventinus glass, but I do have a tall Weizen glass that has a bigger than normal bubble at the top. Close enough, right? Right. So I poured the beer and it produced about an inch of creamy, slightly tan head that subsided to a centimeter or so thick for the rest of the tasting. The color is an attractive deep reddish brown, like a dark cherry oak wood floor. There is some cloudiness that prevents much light from getting through.  The smell is really enjoyable. It reminds me of some of the stouts I have had recently. It has a nice sweet oak smell. Hints of nut and roast mixed in with fruit (grape/raisins). Some very slight hints of spearmint the further I got down the glass. I was so intoxicated by the smell that I almost forgot to drink some. Anyway, the taste is very parallel to the nut and grape smell. It has a unique roasty oak taste backed by subtle sweetness. This is an exceptionally crafted and balanced beer.  The body of the beer is light to maybe medium light. There is a moderate amount of carbonation which leads to a crisp bite and a slightly dry finish.  Overall, I am extremely pleased I bought this beer. It was kind of like a blind date, because I knew nothing about the beer before purchasing it and I was nervous about the possibility of choosing a bad beer on a otherwise crappy night. Put this on my list of favorite beers. Check! Well, back to packing my junk up for now. Cheers!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Some tiny carbonation rises to the surface. Some clumps of yeast sink to the bottom of the glass.  Aroma is a combination of some sweetness, a touch of vanilla and some wheat notes. Not as much banana as expected. A touch of yeasty spice.  A sweet caramel, touch of white pepper, light banana, moment of yeast, hint of clove, nice deep malt flavor that is very smooth.  Very fine carbonation, silky smooth in your mouth.  Pretty nice. Frankly, I like the Eisbock version a lot more. We hear a lot about this one and it’s very good. But that’s the gem of the line.

Alcohol hit me strong on the firs couple of hints. Not a bunring alcohol, but you can definitely taste it. Seems like there are some caramel malts trying to emerge, but not quite succeeding. Perhaps it's too cold. I will update if it tastes better when warmed up. Halfway through, still tasting alcohol and just a hint of dark fruits.  Honestly a spot too carbonated for my tastes. I haven't had many weizenbocks, but I feel the carbonation is taking away from some of what the beer could be.  Overall a good beer. How it garnered such a high rating on here is beyond me. I drank a simple hefe before this, and it was much better. I can't get past the alcohol character.

I really don’t know how to describe what I’m tasting here. There’s a sweet malt flavor here, some dark roasted fruits, some rum. I am not really noticing the spices mentioned on the bottle and in other reviews. Perhaps in the rum flavors.  8.2% can be nothing, but here it dominates this beer. Ever sip bites with alcohol. There isn’t anything else to help mellow this either.  I’m completely disappointed in this one. The body is thin, lacks carbonation, the taste is a touch sour, and frankly nothing here is done well. Considering the reviews I may have simply had my expectations too high but I’ve simply had much better doppelbocks and it isn’t a style I seek out. That said this comes off like say a dark imperial hef.  I really want to score this higher, but I can't think of a reason to do so.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,output01x,4.27,"Poured from a 500 ml. bottle into a pint glass.  An explosively growing 3-finger head forces me to stop what I thought was a gentle pour. While I wait for the head to settle, I rethink my choice of glassware (a Weizen glass would have probably been better). However, the cream-colored head diminishes quickly, leaving a disappointing lack of lacing. The body itself is a dark, hazy brown close to mahogany.  Banana and clove dominate the nose with a touch of roasted malt in the background. This beer certainly smells delicious.  And the flavor certainly is as well. Citrusy orange tickles the tip of the tongue while banana and clove cover the rest of the bases. But just as those flavors start to subside, nutty malt and the slightest hint of alcohol pour from the back of the mouth.  Surprisingly creamy, Aventinus has strong carbonation with a medium-heavy body creating an interestingly light texture. It expands to every corner of your mouth with each sip but vanishes in mere seconds.  The fluffy mouthfeel of this beer certainly makes it very drinkable but I would have preferred less carbonation to allow the great flavors to stick to my tongue a little better.",Schneider Weisse G.

The palate is pillowy and full bodied, beginning with a vast, spreading blast of carbonation which settles into the caramel and apricot flavors with a touch of floral bitterness. The long finish starts sweet and rich with cooked fruit notes before turning mouthwateringly tart. I absolutely loved the whole lip-smacking delivery on this. By using wheat, this managed to stay incredibly elegant too, instead of succumbing to a bogged-down syrupy malt character. Probably my fav reviewed beer at the moment.",Schneider Weisse G.

Extremely mellowed. Not a lot of cloves or bananas are left. 4  MF: Light, low carbonation.

The sweetness of the malts rounds it out. some chocolate might be coming through from these darker malts. M/D: mouthfeel is moderate and the carbonation that created such a huge head is gentle and smooth throughout. Alcohol is almost not apparent at all. There is a reason this beer has such good ratings.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,DrStiffington,3.58,"Wow, am I off the average BA review on this one! It looks good: cloudy, hazy, dark brown. It smells like clove, bananas, malt. The taste is ok, but this is not my favorite style of beer. I'm disappointed because the bottle says that there should be some chocolate notes, but all I'm getting is the spicy clove and banana. Now, I like bananas, but this is not my favorite taste for a beer. I like the other offering from this brewery MUCH better. Oh well, at least it gave me a pleasant buzz.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Gambrinus1184,4.22,"Served from a 500 ml bottle in a Schneider Wiezen glass at Billy O's English Tavern in Southington, Conn.  A: Dark, ruby amber in color with a bright tinge and slightly chilled haze beneath a huge, frothy head of white foam which settles to a thin cap, leaving behind a good deal of lacing.  S: Loads of complex, fruity aromatics and earthy malt aromas. Dark berries, raisin, peaches and dried citrus blend with slightly smoky, sweet caramel roasted malt and yeast scents.  T: Smooth, complex balance of chewy, fruity malts and sweet, caramel spiciness. Bits of funky, chewy wheat and yeast slide across the palate, leaving behind a warm, complex blend of plum, raisin, banana, mint and spices. Slight alcohol burn leads into a warming, clingy sweet and spicy finish.  M: Full bodied and robust bock filled with chewy yeast and wheat, but so smooth and spicy clean in the finish.  D: Dangerously drinkable at over 8% ABV, the complex flavor and aroma will beckon for further sipping and I'm almost certain Aventinus would make a fine pairing with many roast pork or cheese plates. Excellent flavors and craftsmanship make it a no-brainer when in the market for complex German brews.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,capeannbass36,4.23,"A-Poured into an Aventinus glass. Rich brown color. Large off white head. Worthy of an artwork quality picture of a glass of beer. S- Clove, spice. T-Rich, sweet, fruity.

72,224,KajII,3.9,"[Best served in a Weizen glass]  Poured a medium hazy brown with a very large off-white fizzy head that dissapated rapidly and had no poor lacing. The aroma was complex with a dark chocolate malt and a sweet earthy yeast that had notes of clove, banana, vanilla and a mild alcohol scent. It tasted sweet and acidic with a mild hint of banana and chocolate in the begining and the become mildly sweet with a yeasty-sour flavor that had a nice spiciness at the finish with the flavor lasting only a short time. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and watery in texture with a lively carbonation. Overall an awesome wheat/bock beer, in fact I think I will just have to drink another.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,pants678,3.78,"Pours a mahogany brown with a slight, bubbly beige head.  Smells of sweet figs, apples and a clear note of alcohol.  A real treat for the tip of the tongue. An almost sour start, raisins and raspberry pervade with a welcomed base of brown sugar. Are there hops in here? Alcohol is well hidden, especially for 8%.  Could maybe up the bubbles. Not flat but could use a little kick up.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,evanlarkin,4.45,"Thanks to DoctorB2B for this one!  Appearance: Pours a hazy brown that you can't quite see through. About a finger of head that dissipates like soda foam, into a few thin white islands sitting around the top.  Smell: Very very wheaty, basically exactly what I imagine an unfiltered wheat to taste like. Strong banana notes come through the initial scent, with just a touch of lemony zest in the background.  Taste: Semi-sweet, wheaty, and boozy. The banana scent is present in the flavor, as well as some very subtle chocolate notes under the immediate flavors. Little to no notable bitterness. Not quite like anything else I've ever tasted.  Mouthfeel: Full and thick. This almost feels heavier than a normal liquid on my tongue. Low carbonation and very smooth.  Drinkability: After just a few mouthfuls I can feel the alcohol bearing down on me, which is fair enough at 8.2%, though I feel like it's still hitting me very fast. That being said, I'd have another. The fact is this is a delicious beer that I wouldn't possibly pass up at a liquor store if I could get it in my area. It exemplifies great beer that toes the line of the ""dark beer"" category.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,knm,3.43,"This brew has an insane amount of frothy light head. Color is a chalky dark amber that lets no light through. Smell is of very strong oak and yeast. The taste is extremely rich. It has dark malts and fruity after thoughts. An interesting combo, and a nice sipper.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,ElGordo,4.45,"Poured from the 500ml bottle into a weizen glass. Body is a pretty chestnut brown with some dark orange highlights, topped by a big, creamy, light tan head that takes its time working it's way down to a manageable level. Wonderful aroma of sweet caramel malt, wheat, and dark fruit, with notes of plum, white grapes, and some exotic spices (coriander and mace). Palate is rich and sweet up front, lots of fruity notes mixing with the mild, sugary sweetness of lots of caramel malt and wheat. Plums, grapes, apples, raisins, and orange peel lend the feel of something almost like a holiday fruitcake, and are accented by some mild spices. A slight hint of husky bitterness makes a brief appearance before the swallow before yielding again to the malty sweetness. A lingering apple-y sweetness remains ling after the swallow. Body is rich and velvety, but not creamy or thick. This is just perfect for the complexity of the flavors here, and better than any other beer I've had of this style. The high alcohol content make it something that I wouldn't be able to handle every day, but it's a very nice slow sipper.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BirdsandHops,4.15,"A: Pours a murky brown with about 3 fingers of off-white head which recede into a nice cap with a little lacing.  S: Bananas and dark fruit such as plums greet the nose up front. There is also an aroma of hearty wheat bread with a touch of hop bitterness.  T: Similar to the aroma, there are some banana and dark fruit flavors up front. Then follows a nice, hearty and yeasty bread flavor that finishes sweet and dry.  M: Medium-thick body with high carbonation that tingles the taste buds and goes well with the yeast and bread flavors. Crisp and dry.  D: Very drinkable and delicious beer that is both refreshing and filling.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Satchboogie,4.67,"500ml bottle poured into a wheat beer glass  A: Pours dark caramel brown, hazy, massive 3+ finger light brown bubbly and frothy head that dissipated fairly quickly.  S: Clove/banana, ripe pear, a little caramel, esters almost resembling a belgian.  T: First thing that comes to mind is balanced, complex, and delicious! You get the sweet and savory combination of banana and caramel, there's some more ripe fruit that adds more brightness. All this combine with the clove/vanilla spice notes and big malt character to lend it a rum cake like flavor. Has nutty qualities, maybe raisins, borderline dark fruits as well. There's somewhat of a milk chocolate quality in the middle and finish. The alcohol esters are massive, but the alcohol taste itself is completely hidden. The dark, bold flavor and complexity is akin to huge Belgian Dark ale. It's that good!  M: Carbonation is actually a little lighter than I was expecting, that said, it's pretty much at my ideal level for the style. The body is probably the fullest and richest I've had for the style, it's a little viscous and surprisingly creamy and smooth. Luscious is the best descriptive.  D: This is probably the best wheat beer and/or doppelbock I've had. It's nearly perfect, despite the amazingly full/complex flavor and luscious mouthfeel, it still has a light and airy quality to it that makes it extremely drinkable and I completely don't sense the 8.2% alcohol.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Avagadro,4.85,"A: Aventinus boasts a beautiful mahogany body, which is accentuated by the brew's haziness. The head formation is abrupt, forming a rocky head that climbs right out of the glass without falling out of it. If at any point your head fades below your liking (a rare scenario,) simply give the glass a good swirl to summon a new one. The only aesthetic quality that could be improved here is a more lively lacing.  S: The bouquet is bold and upfront, with rum, bananas, and clove, all balanced well.  T: Absolutely amazing. Rum, raisins, bananas Foster, and earthy yeast intermingle, producing a piquant harmony of flavors. These yeasty flavors are all present, but not in an overpowering manner. They are just powerful enough to balance out another major flavor, alcohol. Yes, it is perceptible, but in a pleasing manner.  M: Full bodied with a chewy texture, the brew sticks to the palate with such tenacity that even the obscene amount of effervescence is unable to completely wash away the flavor. This, in turn, results in a beautiful lingering aftertaste in which the web of flavors unravels in to single threads.  D: This is THE weizenbock in my book. There are plenty of tasty examples out there, but they hardly compare to the Aventinus. This is a must try.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,321jeff,4.24,"500ml bottle into a weizen glass. Date coded 10.295. Had my first weizenbock a few weeks back and loved it, so I figured I had to try the ""gold standard"" of the style. Here we go...  Pours a murky river-water brown with a couple fingers of rocky off-white head. It turns into a much prettier, hazy mahogany when held up to light.  Aroma is pleasant yet complex. The wheat makes itself apparent and there is some banana, caramel and some hints of dark fruits in the background.  Taste is sweet with some banana and cloves as well as some dark fruits. The finish is somewhat dry and spicy.  It's medium in body with lots of carbonation and a sort of grainy mouthfeel. I am liking the Aventinus and I think this will age well. Much more interesting than a normal bock but it's definitely feeling like more of a wintertime beer. I can't wait to try the Eisbock version.",Schneider Weisse G.

A large billowy head crowns the drink with an off-white color. Some lacing keeps things interesting as I view this drink.  The smell is very rich with wonderful flavors of brown sugar, wheat, spicy cherry, and clove. The balance is good and fun to smell.  Lovely dark flavors of plums and cherries meet some burnt wheat. The dark malts add a nice balance with just a bit of mild bitter hops for the finish.  The mouthfeel is medium with some heat and carbonation. The overall presence of the brew is satisfying on the tongue.  I would describe this as drinkable and it is a very good offering for the style. You can't go wrong with this one.",Schneider Weisse G.

The aroma is pumpernickel bread, little banana bread, and yeast. The taste is the aromas with a touch of alcohol and cloyiness. The body is filling and after one bottle I am done for the night. A great example of the style.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Cozzatoad,4.33,"Had this on bottle several times and this is were the notes come from. Also tried it on-tap, and it was maybe slightly better  A- Murky/cloudy brown. Head goes up very quickly if poured in a Weizen glass, you actually need to pour it very slowly if you don't want to have just the head. Once you have finished the head is about one third of the glass, and stays there almost until the end  S- Not very strong but sure very good: roasted malts match with liquorice, banana, caramel and clove  T- A bread-like taste from the malts obviously takes the main stage, but raisin, banana, chocolate and clove also play their part. A complex but yet very gentle flavour  M- This is the best part. The beer is soft and gentle on your mouth and still so strong and warming. No alcohol taste is to be found and a hint of crispness (perfect carbonation) gives the mouthfeel a little more life  D- Sure an incredibly easy drink for 8%ABV. The perfect combination between complexity and drinkability  A wonderful beer, the bottle version was maybe a bit 'lifeless' if compared with the on-tap version, but i'm not sure wheter ratings would actually change",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,jsprain1,4.29,"A- Pours a tea brown with an initially huge head but it disappated down to a quarter finger. Virtually no lacing either. S- Smell is definitely wheat malt forward, with notes of banana, slight bit of spice, and a bit of fig and/or raisen in there. Can't decide which dark fruit is a better explanation. T- Big wheat flavor, some banana and cocoa notes, a vague bit of spice, and a bit of that dark fruit again. M- the mouthfeel is interesting in that the finish is simultanesouly fizzy yet leaves a slick mouthfeel. The body is just on the light side of what I'd like, and the carbonation is just a touch high, but overall the mouthfeel is thoroughly enjoyable. D- I liked this beer. Good flavors and good mouthfeel. Could definitely use work on head retention and lacing though. That was a bit disappointing.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BeerNinja007,4.59,"Picked up this 500mL bottle a few months ago at Manchester Wine and Liquors, Manchester CT, for $4.40. Code 10.141 0259 2822. I've had this many times and have always loved it; it is one of the first ""fancy"" beers I remember trying all those years ago when I was just budding as a beer geek. Served @ 47F in a large weizen glass of the same temperature.  A: Brew is a dark umber or root beer color, brown with an orange tint, completely clear, with abundant carbonation. 1"" of ivory head settles quickly to nothing. The yeast was settled firmly at the bottom of the bottle, but a good swirl of the last bit brought it to my glass (at which point the brew became obviously cloudy).  S: Firstly brown sugar, dried figs, yeast, nutmeg and ginger. Then secondary notes of fresh plums, vanilla, muted lemon, banana.  T: Warm rich balance between malt and wheat in the backbone. Big gingerbread presence, warm ginger and nutmeg, tons of sweat spicy bready goodness up front and lasts straight through the finish. Mild lemon balm hop appears mid sip and also lingers in the finish.  M: Rich and delectable, alcohol entirely hidden, but only medium-bodied, not filling, and eminently quaffable. Excellent balance.  D: All the warmth and spice I like in a typical dunkel, but the lighter mouthfeel (despite it being stronger), brightness, and a TON of diversity make this truly exceptional. Awesome.  My only gripe is the appearance... can't get any sort of head out of it. A minor shortcoming.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Smell - smells of banana, clovey, also can tell it has more alcohol than the norm, no hoppy smell whatsoever  T - deep, suddenly sweet that disappears leaving a uniquely indescribably pleasant taste - is this beer? Tastes like something in its own class. Expected a stronger alcohol taste, but that wasn't there.  M - wow - great feel  D - very drinkable, however I think 2 would be the maximum. If you define drinkable as hey I want one again it's a 5. If you define it as I want to pull a 5 beer session, that this is not that kind of beer...unless you are in southern germany, it is on tap, served by a beautiful teutonic waitress, and your friends can carry you out.",Schneider Weisse G.

The beer pours with a thick head that somewhat resembles a marshmallow cream. Damn, that's thick and creamy. One of the more impressive coatings down a glass I've seen, too. The body itself is a dark and rich orange, but not quite up to perfect.  The nose is dominated by ripe bananas and has caramel and clove undertones. Really reminds me of a trappist beer. Interesting.  The experience in my mouth really reminds me of a trappist beer. I wasn't expecting this when I bought the bottle. This has the heavenly carbonation that I've only seen in beers like Westy 8. I don't get much of the banana anymore... just a caramelly, smooth, rich flavor. There's a wonderfully snooty clove note in there. Just... wow. More than I was expecting.

It pours a hazy sienna topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises wheat, Belgian yeast, clove, red apple skin, and toffee. The taste brings more of the same to the table (well, cup, anyway), with some additions of black pepper, banana, nutmeg, and rye bread. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mildly grainy feel.

Big time wheat, banana/clove, candied fruits (like dark fruits covered in brown sugar), and some slight booziness. Kind of reminds me of Banana's Foster.  T.  Like a typical weizen beer but with a little sweet dark fruits in it. This beer seems like a hybrid of a Belgian strong ale and german weizen. Just like nose, it is kinda boozy tasting.  M.  A little thin but not too light bodied. Loads of carbonation, which is expected. A slight dryness in this beer as well.  D.  A pretty good beer that's complex and relatively easy to find.

Aroma is yeasty and malty, similar to a Belgian strong ale. Bread and fruit. Very complex aroma.  Yeast is present in the taste as well. Rich and deep malt flavor. Wheat sweetness is definitely present but it's balanced by drier malts similar to oak and toast. Caramel and earthy flavors are there too. Pretty sharply carbonated.

I first picked up hints of cloves, cardamom, orange and some cinnamon  I wasnt sure what to expect based on the aroma. The taste was malty and bit heavy. It was a bit on the thin side and did not leave any distinctive aftertaste.  This may just not be the type of beer that really suits me.

Great dark fruit aromas, mostly raisins and super sweet malts. Not getting much yeast aromas at all, just dark fruits and that sticky sweet malt.  T - Very similar to the nose. Theres that nice sweet malts upfront with those delicious dark fruit tastes, dominated by a raisin flavour. The alcohol is still present in this, which is fine. That sweetness is almost cloy, but not there yet.  M - Nice mouthfeel, low carbonation thanks to the lengthy aging process of this. Its almost syrupy due to how sweet it is.

The pour is a plum / brown color, with resplendent carbonation rising, presumably throughout the glass, but only visible right at the edges. These bubbles nobly rejuvenate the eggshell foam cap. Originally enormous, the head becomes manageable after a few minutes, and a sheet of lace is left down the side of the glass.  Smell: The smell is toffee, brown sugar, raisins, apple cider, and a bit of vinegar.  Taste: I get some more spice elements as this warms, which helps it out. It starts with a brown sugar sweetness, bringing some raisins with it. A spice variety comes up next, with the cloves coming through more as it warms. It turns almost cidery toward the end, with fermented apple dominating. The finish is spiced apple, a touch of vinegar, and a dash of brown sugar.  Mouthfeel: Crisp, tingly carbonation is obvious. It gets creamier as it warms up a little bit. It starts a bit dry then gets slightly acidic, finally finishing fully dry. Above average carbonation and a medium to full body.  Drinkability: Maybe I need to give this another try, but it really just is not as good as I was expecting. The aroma is interesting, but the flavor just comes up a bit short.",Schneider Weisse G.

Weizenbock can be tought of as (Doppel)bock whose grist bill includes some wheat malt therefore its organoleptic qualities should be a mixture of (Doppel)bock and German wheat beer. So,...the aroma is bock-like melanoidins, bready malt, ripened plum, clove phenolics, banana esters and evident alcohol. The palate is on the sweet side with bock-like melanoidins, dark fruits (plums and raisins), wheat flavor, clove and spicy alcohol that helps to balance the malt and brings warming sensation.

S: Vivacious aromas of tangy wheat malt and telltale weizen yeast. Banana, clove, and spicy esters are very prominent. Lightly lemony as well. Some soft caramel, along with mild dark fruit.  T: Soft caramel sweetness along with a big, crisp and tangy wheat malt presence. Clove, banana, and spice are all present from the yeast. A bit of bubblegum as well. Some light notes of other fruits are also detectable. A light herbal hop kiss provides subtle bitterness. Alcohol is noted into the finish but isn't distracting.  M: Medium-full body. Carbonation is essentially perfect - tingly and active without contributing too much dryness. For 8.2% alcohol, this manages to be surprisingly crisp and refreshing.  D: An excellent, highly refined weizenbock. Great balance of wheat malt, spunky weizen yeast character, and delicate mouthfeel. Easily, easily drinkable and more refreshing than any beer this big has a right to be.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

S-smells initially like bananas but then quickly fades in to smelling like freshly burnt wheat. there's a bit of spice to it as well. its a very high strength!  T-comes in with a nice dark roasted wheat flavor that has hints of banana. it then transforms in to a more spicy wheat flavor. after that the after-taste is of burnt caramel wheats that lasts for quite a long time. this is a really complex beer with every sub-taste having a really good strength to it. this might be the be best german wheat beer i've ever had. there is so much flavor and potency in this.  M-fairly thick, a good creamy carbonation but with a fairly dry finish  D-the complexity seems to diminish but the after-taste becomes almost stronger through out the bottle. its a very heavy beer and it doesn't seem to go down too quickly, tho it does go down enjoyably.",Schneider Weisse G.

A: Pours a full three finger head, the light tan holds a very wispy froth. the body is a hazy light brown that seems deeper in color in the middle of the glass. Nice light wheat character.  S: A deep classic wizen nose, that has caramel hints or a dopplebock. Subtle smoky hints, with a medium intensity.  T/M: An upfront bold note of clove, that moves into a lingering, sweet body. The layers of tastes make this a truly complex beer. A spice on the mouthfeel and holds on for a creamy lingering body. Burnt lingering finish.

Finishes with a faint wisp of booziness and just enough bitterness to prime the palate for another drink.  M -- Rich and full bodied, but almost a little too crisp in the carbonation.

There is banana, light clove, definit vanilla, and some light peppering as well. Delicious beer.  Mouthfeel- Medium body and carbonation, incredibly smooth. ABVs are hid nice, but you can still tell its a big one.  Overall- This really is the best weizenbock out there! Back to back with weihenstephan, that was good, this was excellent.

Especially after reading the reviews on here, and seeing it somehow managed to receive an ""A"".  Poured into a mug from the bottle I noticed the carbonation almost as soon as I was done pouring. This beer had a mouth feel of a soda, very bubbily and not very beer like. Very wheat taste, and as I would expect from a bock there should have been some sort of maltiness, sadly this was not the case.  on another note there were some nice fruity hints in the smell, but the bitter finish ruined any pleasantness I had with this beer.",Schneider Weisse G.

Classic weizen wheat mixed with cerealish sweet malt flavors, some bananas mix with berry, theres some confectionary qualities to it as well. A very complex and pleasing aroma.  The taste has mostly the same weizen, sugary malt, and banana qualities as the smell. Other dark fruits chime in and there is a licorice-ness to it. Some vanilla like it had some time on oak. Awesome.  Medium good carbonation yet very smooth.  An excellent beer and a standard. Do not pass this one up on tap!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

I can pick up the banana, slightly and the spices and vanilla. Nothing comes fwd as dominant.  Mouthfeel - Very bland, nothing came through on this more than normal. little more bitterness, but not much else.  Drinkability - I gotta say, i think this was a bad beer bottle. there was nothing that stood out, even when it warmed to room temp.

72,224,generallee,4.42,"Presentation: (Part of a 5 pack gift set with glass.) It was poured from a brown 500ml bottle into the Aventinus glass that came with the beer. The label on the bottle has the abv (8.2%) and a description of the beer on the back. There is no freshness date but there seems to be a batch number or bottle code on the back label.  Appearance: It produces a thick and tall head which is light tan in color and settles out quickly. This makes for just a little slick lacing on the glass. The body has a rich mahogany color and hazy flat look.  Smell: The aroma is fruity and yeasty. There are some big banana and bready yeast like notes with mild clove and sweet booze. There is only a faint trace of hops.  Taste/Palate: The flavor has a sweet and fruity, medium to full bodied character with all the wonderful notes picked up in the nose. Red banana, bready yeast, some caramel and light clove mingle with a touch of sweet booze and very mild hop bitterness. The feel is smooth and lightly carbonated. It drinks well and never gets too sweet or cloying despite its sweet overall character.  Notes: What else can I say? It's a great beer!!! The only thing I would like to have had with this beer is a little more head retention.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

A - Fluffy chunky two finger head that doesn't quit (I've always wanted to say that in a review). Head has a creamy color to it. Dark brown colors with a slight orange hue. Head sticks around til the end with lots of lacing. An absolutely magnificent looking beer.  S - Banana, bubble gum. Spicy, yeasty.  T - Bready, banana, bubble gum, spicy. Alcohol shows slightly at the end. Finishes with grains, wheat, bock and caramel flavors. So frigging delicious.  M - Very balanced with a medium body (its almost thick and creamy in someways). Watch yourself with this one though. The alcohol is so perfectly masked so imbibe slowly! Carbonation is perfect. Goes down so easily.  D - Could have this anytime, be it the dead of winter or on a warm sunny day. Just watch yourself though. Aesthetically beautiful with a world class flavor and balance. Enjoy!",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,deapokid,4.38,"Liquid is a black grape in color with bubbly carbonation and a full finger of head. Retention is really nice and lacing sticks to the glass like glue. Visually stunning, especially in the way the lighter fruit colors peak out when held to light.  Aroma is sweet and malty with a whiff of booze and a heavy dose of banana. It's nice to see an aromatic balance between the wheat notes and the heaviness of the lager fermentation.  Flavor boasts a candied sweetness and nice burst of banana up front. Ending is dry and roasty, which stops the wheat notes from being cloying and allows the fruit flavors (plum, nectarine, pineapple) to mingle well with the dark maltiness.  Mouth opens smoothly, followed by a lively conclusion that mingles a bubbly carbonation with the deeper flavors.  This is so easy to take down and, despite the booze in the nose, this drinks like a more complex Dunkelweizen.  One of the best lagers in the world.",Schneider Weisse G.

M: Ever so slightly oily, but more or less clean.  D: This is a spicy, warming beer that is great on a cold night in front of a fireplace.

Once again, balance is the special thing here. Some alcohol strength but for the most part I would've never guessed 8%. Some sweetness with nice wheat finish.

72,224,BryanRex,4.27,"What more can I say that hasn't already been mentioned. This is a world class beer, and once normalized for size (16.9 oz) and ABV (8.2%) it is extremely affordable compared to its competition. One bottle gives you nearly three standard drinks, and at only $4.50 per bottle it's about half the cost of most other good Belgian ales or doppelbocks of similar style.  The beer pours a medium brown with red hints and leaves a nice three-finger head with lacing that persists throughout the entire drink. Great (not excessive) carbonation  The beer smells of banana, dark fruits, clove, yeast and lemon. It has an excellent complex blend of aromas and spices.  The beer tastes pretty much the same way it smells, although the banana and yeast sweetness outweighs the hops and carbonation, although excellently balanced.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, malty, creamy and very smooth.  I could drink this all night, but at 8% ABV you have to be very careful. Each bottle has the alcohol content of about 3 regular beers which is why most people are ""one and done.""",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,Schwoopty,4.43,"This is one of the first doppelbocks I have had in a while. I normally dont go out of my way to drink this style but it was recommended to me which means I had to taste it.  The pour is crystal clear with a nice white head lingering throughout my session. The aromas are bold. Caramelized fruit, bananas, clove, and spice are immediately present. My first taste is more of the caramelized fruit. The spices come through more in the taste and remind me of a bananas foster desert. The caramel sweetness cuts down the spices and the hops battle back the sweetness to lend a dryer finish. The medium carbonation and 8.2 ABV help out the hops in the dry finish.  I think you would be hard pressed to find another beer in this style that can beat this on out on aroma and flavor. It may be a personal preference but this is one of the best in my opinion. Huzzah to German brewing!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,stakem,4.4,"Review from notes taken on 12/30/10. Shared with some friends.  This was a paper-wrapped cave-aged bottle from 2006. Poured into a couple of snifters. It appears as a clear dark amber color that borders brown that looks like a watered-down concoction of molasses. A tan cap forms across the top and holds tight around the edges of the brew.  The aroma of this brew is fruity with a scent of cloves, toasty malt that cones across quite bready and raisins. There are light suggestions of chocolate and spice with a mild molasses sweetness.  The taste is fruity with a candied flavor that picks up more deep sweetness akin to molasses spiced with clove and chocolate. There is a long drawn out flavor of toasty grain, spices and molasses left lingering on the tongue.  This is a medium to full bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. Excessively drinkable for more than 8%. The alcohol is mastectomy hidden, I never once got any sensation of alcohol flavor or warmth. Additional pours produce an increased amount of sediment in the glass which brings out more bready and banana-like flavors.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Big snap of soda bubbles, huge sounding you can hear these bubbles SNAP, tan colored head is big but also goes away at a very fast pace. Very dark brown with faint red hues to go with it similar to a doppelbock. Lot of carbonation and elevator music from the bottom. Minimal retention with some pock marking on the head circle. Yeast residue in the bottom of the glass... ROCK THAT!  The Bouquet is alright yeah man... dig that. Estery, like a trippel, but got malt and carbonation that is pleasant. Simple yeast on the nose and faint bread. Wonderful combination of smells and character even some Coca Cola.  The taste however is very carbonated but in an enjoyable way that doesn't take away from the beer's great feel. Fruit berry subtle component in mid palate, slight chew like a Witbier, taste of Coke as well along with faint malt.  I would have this again at the drop of a hat.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,axeman9182,4.43,"500mL bottle, I believe with a Julian code giving a bottle date of 10/2/2009, poured into my Duvel tulip.  Aventinus pours a very dark purple, threatening to cross into brown. There are noticeable light red highlights around the edge of the glass. The bone colored head is dominating the glass, five fingers plus right after the pour, and it doesn't look like it's going anywhere anytime soon. Only downside is that lacing is a bit weak. The nose to me is like a clove forward hefe on steroids. A ton of clove, some banana, and a fair amount of vanilla-esque sweetness that I always get from wheat. No real hint of the darker malts used in this one though, which is a bit of a letdown. The flavor makes up for it though, as in addition to the aforementioned hefe notes there's a generous dollop of caramel and a dash of fruitiness (almost straight plum). The final piece that elevates Aventinus to true greatness is the slight, pleasant warming sensation from the alcohol. The body is great, nice and full without spilling over into a stout-like richness. Carbonation is similarly top notch, a bit on the low side but very sharp nonetheless. There's just something keeping it from perfection, I think maybe the body could stand to be just a touch bigger. This beer is just another reason (along with the eisbock, hefe, and Brooklyn collab) that Schneider is my favorite German brewery. A true classic.",Schneider Weisse G.

Taste: A thick malt syrup flavor up front and followed by a heavy dose of yeast; inturn, concludes with slight bitternes and alcohol. All the flavors are layered on top of eachother like a cake.

Clings well, with small clumps following the whole way down.  Banana ester notes are dominated by a strong chocolate malt background. There are also notes of vanilla, though you get a much stronger presence of the fruit esters. The yeast body adds a bit of spiciness in the end, and the alcohol well hidden in the background. All compliment well together, created a very inviting and wholesome presentation.  The aromas are not deceiving in the least. Strong flavors, with rich banana sweetness, with a backbone of vanilla are played against the rich, chocolate malt body. Delicious. Alcohol is nonexistent. A crisp finish leaves you yearning for the next one.  Rich, creamy, luscious mouthfeel.  A bit high in the ABV, but the 500ml is perfect, because anymore would be just too rich.

72,224,AJacob81,4.32,"2003 Vintage, consumed at Bavarian Lodge with my wife in observance of our seventh anniversary.  A - Pours hazy, dark straw in color. Good carbonation after seven years in the bottle. Outstanding lacing and retention of an initial 2-finger rocky off-white head.  S - Lovely aroma of toffee, rum-soaked raisins, and a hint of freshly baked sourdough bread, some clove and anise as well. The bouquet is strong, and very inviting.  T - Very mellow, smooth wheat malt carries, with strong supporting turns from the toffee, rum, and dark fruits present in the nose. I wonder how this all balances when fresh. This is a prime advertisement for aging beer, however.  M and D - Again smooth is the operative term here, medium body with just enough carbonation, finishes dry and a little sweet. Just a great beer to drink, the alcohol is well hidden, but still warms nicely.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,bucklemyshoe,4.23,"Notes from 12/04/10:  500 mL bottle at 42* into a Franziskaner Weizen glass.  A: This pours a hazy reddish-brown color with intense carbonation, great lace, and a two-finger head of foam that turns rocky prior to the first sip.  S: The nose features notes of banana, clove, lemon, and bold spicy earthiness.  T: The taste shows sweet berries, a mild hoppiness, bold banana flavors, and a linger spicy earthiness.  M: This is much too carbonated early but it flattens out too much by the end.  D: This is terrific but the carbonation is overdone.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,nataku00,4.18,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Beer is a dark brown with the edges of the glass being light brown/orange when you hold it up to a light. Initial half finger of foamy off white colored head that quickly dissipated, leaving a sheet of head clinging to the edge of the glass. Well carbonated with plenty of small bubbles floating up from the bottom of the glass. Beer had a bit of sediment left at the bottom of the bottle, which I didn't agitate too much of.  Nose is dark malts, dark fruits like dried cherries and raisins, and an aroma I can only describe as dark soy sauce. Somewhat sweet and savory but complex.  Taking a sip, dark fruits are still there, though not as strong as in the nose. Raisins and plums, with a bit of biscuit malt sweetness. Some of the wheat characteristics come through in the banana and anise like flavors as well. Finishes dry with a slight floral hop note lingering with some of the fruit on the tongue.  Gentle but plentiful carbonation tickles the tongue lightly for a medium bodied beer. The fairly dry and clean finish with only a hint of an aftertaste combined with a well hidden alcohol content makes Aventinus much too drinkable.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,TheBrewo,4.24,"This brew pours a dark golden brown color. It is somewhat hazy, with vigorous carbonation visible. It supports a foamy, two finger head that looks very clean. It remains for some time and recedes to about half its original height before refusing to go away any further. The aroma is wrought with wheat and ripe esters, giving the impression that a slice of cooled banana bread is sitting in the glass instead of beer. There is also spiciness, with clove and sassafras, some nuttiness that could be walnut, and a nose of yeast on the back. The taste is introduced with wheat and malts. Spice invades the middle, with a generous helping of warming alcohol, which stays for the remainder. The finish is then estery sweet, with darker spices, like black pepper, and hints of bitter orange rind hidden far back on the palate. The aftertaste, too, is cool and sweet, with a soft breath of alcohol to liven things up. The body is medium, with the carbonation high and prickly on the tongue. The mouth is left satiated and slightly coated. The nice abv leads to a generous inclusion of alcohol, with the effect of, as was stated earlier, warming the drinker. Despite the beer's attractive taste profile, it is drunk more slowly, due to its physical characteristics.  Overall, what was most impressive about this brew was its aroma. It is bold, complex, and has every little scent a weizenbock should. The flavors in the taste were delicious, to say the least, but were not as robust as suggested from their smells. One curious note was how present the alcohol was, for a beer of 8.2%. While this is, admittedly higher than some, for the style there are many that meet and exceed that, while masking it a bit better. This is not to say that it was unpleasant, but rather, unexpected.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,spinrsx,4.25,"500ml Bottle  As I approach my 300th review, I'm breaking out some good beers to celebrate!  Appearance - The beer pours a hazy light brown colour with a very large frothy and fizzy beige coloured head. I can't see much carbonation due the darkness/haziness of the beer and there is some very nice lacing running in stages down the sides of the glass. The head lasted for a very long before it began to dissipate and I could hear it popping like a bowl of rice crispies.  Smell - banana/bubblegum, cloves, wheat, dark fruits (raisins?)  Taste & Mouth - The beer has quite a bit of carbonation but it still feels very creamy yet light on the tongue. Most of the flavour is made up of bananas and cloves mixed with some malts and wheat. There are also notes of chocolate and some dark fruits. The beer finishes with a sweet banana and malt aftertaste.  Drink - Another beer that is among the best I've ever had. It has a fantastic appearance and the alcohol is extremely well hidden. This beer tastes delicious and is well worth seeking out.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

S: Banana and clove, just what would be expected in a hefeweizen. T: Banana and clove spices supported by a dark malt backbone. M: Light to medium body. Prickly carbonation. D: Goes down incredibly easily. I would never have guessed that this beer is 8.2% abv. Very refreshing.  Wow. One of the things I would have liked to have had in Scheidner Weiss's original hefe was a stronger flavor and this beer delivers just that. This beer is outstanding. All of the flavors you want and expect in a hefeweizen plus the added malt taste puts this as one of my favorite beers.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The head settles nicely over the body.  Great aroma of clove, yeast, sweet spices, banana. Very inviting.  Tasty. Very tasty. Some dark fruit flavors add to the flavors that follow the aroma. Almost no alcohol present, even with the reasonably high abv.  Dangerously drinkable for the abv. This is a top shelf offering. Highly recommend.",Schneider Weisse G.

But as a reminder make sure you drink it relatively quickly ensuring it is not served straight from a refrigerator.  To summarise, my last bottle of this was very disappointing and very atypical. It just didn't sing. In contrast this was Ferdinand Frantz as Hans Sachs. Bravo.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,gueuzeonhigh,4.35,"Pours with a look that reminds me of apple cider-- you know that stuff served during late October... Creates a small head layer that eventually dissipates and forms a ring in the glass.  The nose produces wafts of wheat and bucolic yeast commingled with hits of alcohol.  The flavor produces indeed almost a yeast like apple cider-- not sweet but hops, yeast, wheat, green apples, with a zest of lemon rind.  A nice clean and long finish as if the flavors from the start play their flavor instruments but don't know the show is over.  Very cordial mouthfeel with a coating that's like a blanket enveloping my palate.  The drinkability is above average-- I could put down a quart of this stuff! Glorious!  I wonder what it's like on tap!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The smell, well this is where we get off to a bad start. It's got a musky, mildewy smell like you get from a poorly kept men's locker room. At best it tastes like rotten prunes spiked with acetone. Let's just call this stuff, ""Rotten Prune Punch"", for lack of a better term. I lived in Germany for 2 years many years ago, drank many a dopplebock and this junk wouldn't make it past first base. I'm highly disappointed, but that's the chances you take in this ""hobby"".",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,clasher,4.8,"This is among my favorite of beers, both dark and complex this weizenbock is an absolute treat because of its depth and sweet finish. The first few sips each bring different notes and it takes finishing a pint to fully appreciate all of the elements that bring together this fantastic find.  While I've tried it from a bottle, my first recommendation would be to make your first attempt from the tap to really grasp it at its best. This is an exceptionably drinkable beer and of the highest quality and standard. No matter if you get the best or worst bartender of the lot, the pour is nearly always respectable. To me it starts with a dry roasted flavor and subtly the sweet notes take hold.  The banana note that previous reviewers have referenced first hit me as a sort of bubblegum finish. This is most certainly the combination of clove and banana coming through.  A note on food pairing, if you're ever in the hunt for a good breakfast food beer pairing I would highly recommend the way this compliments buttery breakfast items like french toast and Belgian waffles, or sage sausages.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,PittBeerGirl,4.25,"Actually-this is my first experience with this beer.  A- Body is a uniformly translucent rich chestnut brown hue. Pours with a 1-2 finger foamy slightly off-white head which eventually fades to a thick collar-very little lacing is left behind in the glass.  S- I understand that this is a weizenbock- but the nose is very BSDA in nature- dark fruit-plum, raisin- come out the most initially in the nose. There is a mild banana bread essence in the background.  T- Taste upfront is mild and offers dark fruit (as discribed above) with an accent of banana and clove- and a nice bready yeast backbone. The finish is a bit spicier and more typical for the style as the banana bread essence really comes through and the dark fruit disappears. What is left to linger is bready yeast and a bit of spice.  M- Medium to high carbonation and a smooth yeasty body.  D- This is a great, well put together Weizenbock. I'm surprised that this is the first time I have tried it as it is clearly top notch for the style- and I like this style (despite its huge variation). A reminder why I love German beers so much-although I tend to overlook them.  I found this 500ml bottle for $4!! Its also always refreshing to see this brew in the top 100 (deviating form the IPA, stout, barrel aged, sour dominated list). Fantastic, classic example of the style to measure others to.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,tubacharlie,4.5,"A good two-finger off-white head tops this muddy and dense light brown brew. The head recedes to a light skim, constantly replenished by the bottle conditioned fermentation. Little lacing or sticking, probably due to the high alcohol content.  The scent of bananas and a bit of cloves is detected within a floral envelope. A large gulp brings vanilla flavors to the front, with a generous roasted malt base and a depth of flavor more associated with barley than the wheat with which this was brewed. Well integrated carbonation rounds out the mouthfeel, with just a touch of bittering hops to balance the slightly sweet vanilla and lingering chocolate notes.  A classic wheat doppelbock (""Germany's original"" according to the label), this has long been a favorite. Many tastings over the years have confirmed its consistency and suitability for pairing with strong or rich foods. Pickled herring and smoked whitefish had no quarrel with this.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,EwaldEichstaett,4.48,"Pours a cloudy brown color with massive tan head.  The smell is dominated by bread, bruised banana, nut, caramel and yeast smells.  The beer is really tasty, mostly the roasted, slightly sweet malts. It tastes rather fruity (date, fig, banana) and full. It actually reminds me of eating Mehrkornbrot with sunflower seeds. The alcohol bit once or twice, but it was rather pleasant.  While the flavour is full force, the mouthfeel is manageable. (Some Weißbiers can be to full. Almost like some type of expanding thick foam from outer space is in your mouth. This is not like that.)  Overall, a excellent beer. Quite drinkable for the ABV as well.

72,224,jbertsch,4.83,"Poured this 1 pint plus .9 fl. oz. bottle into my tall Schöfferhofer Weizen glass and, man, I haven't seen a better looking beer in a long time. HUGE, rocky tan head capped off the glass like a royal staff. Amazing bubbling action. Bubbles vigorously shot up the entire length of the glass and built up so much speed that they were forcing other bubbles to some to shoot down a little and then wiggle back up. It was cool to watch and I'm probably not explaining it well.  Aroma of ripe banana, brown sugar, and wonderfully historic musty-smelling malts.  The banana is front and center in the taste. There's faint apple, and caramel malts laced with burnt brown sugar.  Mouthfeel was velvety, yet carbonated enough. Perfect.  This one really speaks to me, It's a classic. So flavorful and delicious. I need to seek out the aged versions. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Review of 2006 vintage, on 5/13/2011.  Appears a deep mahogany in color. Sudsy head dissipates to a film quick, thought the film stays around. No lace. Huge difference in the head between the aged version and the ""off-the-boat"" version which was frothy and billowy.  The aroma gives off a single profile that has the original flavors I remember from the ""fresh"" version folded into each other. But I can make out banana, dark fruit (plum & apple) and notes of chocolate.  The taste is also a combination of so many flavors into one massive layered profile. It's harder to dissect the flavor profile on the aged version as everything is blended so much. But I can taste cherry, caramel, banana, plum, and apple, all layered with a kiss of chocolate. Overall, it's similar fig, but sweeter. And it gets even sweeter in the last 3rd of the glass.  Meadium-heavy body that has a creamy core with crisp edges.  Drinkability isn't bad. Good at first, but diminishes as you get further along.  I was really looking forward to the vintage. I enjoyed it, but realized in the end that I prefer the fresher version. I still recommend trying to the aged version.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

No lacing at first but does stick the edges towards the end of the tasting.  Smell is mostly of extremely sweet caramel malts, with a heavy dosage of banana. Some apple comes behind that with a slight twang of bubblegum.  Taste is pretty much the same. A heavy sweet maltiness mostly caramel with a tremendous darker fruit-wheat mix. A little touch of spice to bind thing's together.  Mouth is medium bodied with a amazing carbonation. The slight touch of spice does linger for a little bit and does a great job of hiding the higher alcohol.  This one caught me by surprise.

Dark malt with some dark fruit as well. Powerful brown sugar scent, especially as it warms.  T: Wow. Outstanding. Let's see here. We've got a bit of banana, though nowhere near as overpowering as you often have in the style. That yeast is really popping, with a bunch of funk and spice. The sweet malt certainly dominates, but there's a bitterness in there too that reminds me of wine. Tannins? Whatever's going on in there, I want to join the party. It's complex and excellent.  M: Pretty light. High carbonation with small bubbles.  D: The taste is so complicated that every sip is like a taste adventure.

Do detect a little bit of a malty/fruity combination. Some yeast and clove, but very faint.  T- Flavors are quite intresting.

Felt very similar to drinking other weizenbocks, is that a normal mouthfeel?  D- Nothing overly special about this beer. Best aspect may be how well the alcohol is hidden, which does contribute to some good drinkability. Smooth enough to go down easy, would not drink too many of these as you might end up in trouble.

Surprisingly clear, brilliantly burnt brown colored, with a light tan colored huge, dense head that dissipated with soda like fizzing into a rather modest one and, surprisingly, didn't leave any lacing. At first I thought that this was going to be a great looking beer, but as it turned out, not quite.  Aroma is, simply put, magnificent: very sweet with dark caramely sweetness and fruity banana sweetness. It does remind of a doppelbock and a hefeweizen at the same time and has all the toasty-caramel notes with the banana-clove-tart hints. Brilliant.  Although not as strong as aroma, the taste is equally complex: dominated by banana-caramel flavor, with slightly tannic and slightly bitter finish. Very good until the finish that is excruciatingly sweet and cloying, making it hard to take another sip. Some alcohol helps, but still, the overly sweet aftertaste kills almost all the pleasure derived from drinking this one.  Thin body, but still somehow manages to stay around on the palate as if I drank LME. I don't get it!  If you chugged it you won't know but as it is, very tough to drink.",Schneider Weisse G.

Big caramel malt flavors with hints of butterscotch kick things off. Joining in shortly thereafter are large amounts of banana flavors. Midway through the sip the banana flavors fade a bit and are replaced with clove and brown sugar flavors. The spices and thick malt flavors carry through to a mildly bitter ending.

My Lord is there ever a lot going on in the nose. Dark raisins, toffee and brown sugar are at the forefront. A more subtle yet noticeable spiciness is sett just behind. Clove and cinnamon with a strong dry cocoa scent develop more as the beer warms. This is the type of beer that if you try to smell everything you will never drink it. To me honest the intensity of the nose almost gives off a slight smokiness.  The flavor is a bit more simplified than the nose, that is not to say the flavor is not complex. Brown sugar, raisins and cloves roll across the palate before transitioning to a deeper cocoa flavor midpalate. Dark fruit and spice flavors linger on the back of the palate.  The flavor is very heavy but the body is fairly light in comparison. Overall, medium bodied with carbonation which is a bit high for the style. The texture is smooth and the finish is long.  Glad to have finally tried this beer. It was an experience matched by no other. While I may not enjoy the flavors as much as other I do appreciate the quality of this brew. One bottle is enough for me. Definitely one to pick up at some point in your beer journey.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Evocatus,4.23,"Pours a dark brown with a white head. Hoppy, hints of clove, and coffee smells dominated armoa. Some spice and hops going down, but really dominated by the malts. Very smooth and balanced in body. Very drinkable as it goes down real smooth and has great taste, but it's very pricey. More of a once with a fancy meal than anythingelse.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,Sachsenfreude,4.6,"A really cloudy, dark brown, with a creamy head that leaves respectable lacing. The smell is something special, sweet fruity and clove spice like a Weissbier but more intense, plus an additional alcohol burn.  The taste is just like a Weissbier but stronger of alcohol and malt. Sweetness is present but not too strong and also some bitters in the aftertaste. This is a very thick and chewy brew and is just what the style should be. One is enough but session drinking could be possible if taken slow. Highly recommended and an asset to the style.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Pours a dark brown in my pint glass with a thick, rocky head with fair staying power.  Taste is such a sweet and delicious one. Tons of banana here...bubblegum....sweet fruit....and some definite clove presence as well. This is the predominant taste of the beer and it's oh so drinkable. Alcohol at 8.2 percent?? Couldn't tell at all. The sweetness and cloves go all the way through the finish. No hops to be detected. Small incidence of wheat on the back.  One of the few beers that nears absolute perfection to me. It'd be hard to believe they get much better than this.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,DrewZ926,4.48,"A - Pours a cloudy dark brown with a slight white head. Settles nicely and remains opaque throughout.  S - Very full smell similar to other bocks, rich in hops and sweet malty goodness. Picking up distinct notes of toffee, caramel, coffee, and a faint hint of clove  T - Very full malt profile which is complemented very well by the hoppy finish, which leaves a nice spiciness on your palate. Bold flavors throughout with a sweetness I was not expecting from a dopplebock  M - Very smooth, perhaps the finest quality of this beer, very rich and balanced  D - Could drink this all day, preferably at a bier garten in deutschland.

72,224,SolomonGrundy,4.12,"Go Giants!! Pours a cloudy but beautiful deep amber. Huge, three to four fingers of marshmallowy head that settles into a persistent finger of creamy goodness. Wonderful lacing. So far this is elite...Huge aromas of fig, licorice, sweet maltiness, maybe even some tart cherry in the background. This is already clearly a world class beer. Flavor doesn't quite match up to all this, however. Upfront, the flavor is awesome. Lots of fig, malt and licorice immediately assaults you. However, the middle and finish thin out a tad too much for me. Alcoholo of 8.2% ABV completely masked in this brew. I could see people sessioning this and getting greatly ill. Trying to like it more, but the finish is too thin. It's wonderful for about 80% of the drink, then not so perfect. This is, however, an excellent and elite beer, and powerfully drinkable.  What I like most: The color, nose and ABV.  What I like least: The finish is too thin.  Verdict: An elite beer worth tracking down, having only a minor fault here and there.",Schneider Weisse G.

S - What a big scent here! smell is of banana, clove, wheat, cinnamon, molasses, and caramel.  T - Wow. Taste is like one serious, super-hef, with a greater degree of flavor complexity. Big, wheaty, and malty. Banana and clove flavors throughout, with a medley of other spices, like cinnamon. Molasses/brown sugar notes. Even some vanilla & cocoa notes can be found. Dare I say it's the most flavorful wheat beer out there? it's certainly one of them!  M - Super smooth, and full bodied. Thick and creamy. Almost like a milkshake as it foams up.  D - The 8.2% isn't even remotely detectable. It's amazingly drinkable for it's strength.  Overall - After one taste, it's easy to see why this one is often considered the archetype of Weizenbocks.

S - Cloves and cinnamon, toffee malts, apple and citrus scents and a bit of raisins on the finish.  T - Very fruity with cherries, apple and plums. The raisin flavour is also quite noticeable with some nice spices coming through on the finish with cinnamon and nutmeg. The higher ABV goes completely undetected.  M - The heavy carbonation is a bit of a drawback, making it a little too light for my liking. Would've preferred if it were a bit thicker and chewy.  D - Overall a very tasty offering.

A: I unwrapped the paper (stamped with '2004' every few inches) to reveal the bottle (which looking like a normal Aventinus bottle). It poured wonderfully, with a bright white, but short-lived head. The beer has a beautiful, almost unnatural, glow, the colour a light mahogany-red.  S: Strange smell, but nice. Fruity sweet...apple juice comes to mind. In fact, now that I've thought it, I can't get it out of my mind. Fresh-pressed apples. That's all I can smell.  T: Except for an initial wheatiness, this tastes remarkably like apple cider. This isn't bad, just an interesting flavour. The beer was served near room temperature; perhaps it would taste differently if more chilled? I doubt it. The aftertaste is vaguely drying, fruity (with another burst of wheat), and lingering. Overall, decent.  M: Fruity-smooth. Pleasing, but unremarkable.  D: If you like apple cider and don't mind wheat beer, you will enjoy this. All the same, I think I prefer the regular Aventinus.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

A big strong taste with a mix of wheat followed by an unexpected citrus at the middle backed up with chocalate malts at end. Like any dopplebock, packs an alcohol wallop at 8%.

Some addition floral notes as well  Mouth - Not overly bubbly, very nicely carbonated. Smooth, sweet, slightly thicker than other German beers I've had  Drinkability - Extremely well balanced. A true wheat beer with a nice light amount of fruity sweetness. Unlike most German beers I've had (and I've been to Germany), but very enjoyable.  A friend of mine recommended this beer as being one of his absolute favorites and I can absolutely understand why. A truly fantastic beer",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Pours a clear dark amber color with a small amount of white colored head. Very active. There is a lot of alcohol on the nose followed by sweet banana and yeast aromas. The first thing I taste is a little heat, the alcohol definitely comes through a bit. Lots of banana, cherry, apple, and brandy followed by a nice spicy finish. This one is actually pretty light on the mouth, with just the right amount of carbonation. For 8.2% you can taste the alcohol a bit but it's still very drinkable. Overall I'm glad I tried it finally and would definitely buy again.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Of the fruits listed on the bottle, I can smell the banana and vanilla.  Taste - Lots of complexity to this one. Fuzzy fruitiness adds a tingle through the mouth and palate. Definitely malty, with a thicker caramel-like quality, but at the same time not as thick as it might seem by the taste. Bit of a smoked flavor in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Just slightly on the creamier side, but even still, good balance.  Drinkability - With the not-too-lingering aftertaste and higher complexity, this is a great beer to have around in the fridge and share with friends. Maybe a little too much to go back to too often though.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Tastes matches smell almost exactly. I get bananas, brown sugar, some raisins, spicy wheat, rye bread and cloves. A hint of leafy/earthy hops clean out the back end. A residual sweet banana and rye bread flavor lingers.  The mouthfeel is on the high end of medium bodied with lots of carbonation that makes it feel lighter and also adds to the perception of spiciness in the flavor. Pretty dry finish.  This does not seem like an 8.2% alcohol beer. Sweet, spicy and dry makes for an interesting and quaffable beer that defines the style.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Malt profile added a nice sweetness.  M/F: prickly carbonation.  D: The ABV was hardly noticeable - very drinkable. I had one, but I could have easily drank this all night.  Final Thoughts: for a widely available import, this was a very solid wheat doppelbock. While I greatly enjoyed this beer I don't think I'll be going back to it time and again.

The nose is big with bananas. Some spices and cloves blend with sweet and spicy wheat notes to create a bouquet of light, bright, vibrant notes that seem to belie the dark brooding color of the beer. The taste falls right in line with the nose... A sweetness up front leads to a spiced wheat note and a yeasty/estery banana and clove note. Finish is relatively crisp and clean-- only a slight lingering feel of banana sweetness.  Nice medium body with good carbonation. Beer is smooth and easy-drinking.

Heard alot of good word about it;  Pours a dark amber, lots of carbonation and a thriving head. Deep cloudy appearance assuming part of the wheat style.  Smell yields a pine flavor and a tinge of citrus. Slight scent of yeast adding a touch of flowers.  Very big taste upfront, relative to scent. Definately see where the strong beer classification come from. The alcohol tase is noticeable, as is the wheat-dobblebock upfront. This is a brave beer, it knows exactly what it does well and sticks to it. Fairly heavy mouthfeel, slightly chewy, again, wheat..  Overall i think the Aventinus doesn't quite live up to what i expected, having said that, it is great for it's style: the Doppelbock. At 8.5% the 500 ml bottle serves well on its own.

Some clove and bready yeast mix in there, with the slightest hint of alcohol. Very inviting  T: Starts with a sweetness, which I'll guess is more candied malts. There is a blend of spice, clove, some fruit and wheat that follows. Leaves me wanting more as soon as I swallow  M: Medium bodied. Carbonation dances on the tongue, leaving a slight tingle. Bit of a dry, spicey finish  D: I had no issues with finishing this; in fact, I wish I had another.

Taste- Taste is bready, with lots caramel malts, and lots of spiciness (clove, nutmeg). Also, there are some dark fruits and a little bit of alcohol; the alchohol is very well hidden though. Awesome flavour overall. Also, banana flavour is present, but it does not stand over and above the other flavours, rather it is a part of the broader sweet bready profile that dominates the beer.

M - Smooth and creamy, with a medium-heavy body and a surprisingly crisp and refreshing level of carbonation that really scrubs the tongue.  D - Quite drinkable, the ABV is completely hidden.

Beautiful.  Aroma-Deep cloves and spicy banana-bread upfront mingle with an almost candy-like sweetness reminiscent of bubblegum followed by the faintest tinges of alcohol. Smells delightful.  Taste-The same clove flavors found in the aroma comes forth forward on the palette, followed again by the spicy banana-bread. It's not quite as intense or as sweet as the aroma but it's still very nice. Just the slightest tinge of alcohol on the finish.

Smelled like... caramelized bananas. Never had em, but I guarantee they smell like this. A bit of coffee action too.  Light feel without being watery, could go down as quicky as water though.  Taste is sweet malt heaven. Dominant flavor is carmel. Picking out the rest would lower my drinking enjoyment, would rather let them all party in my mouth. Some warmth from the alcohol, but no bite. I guess there's hops in here otherwise this would taste like a runny alcoholic milkshake.  Aftertaste is the lightest of alcohol burn and sticky sweetness.

When poured, only the tube at the base showed liquid as the ball on top was completely filled by a cream-colored billowy foam. This settled down a little to reveal the dark amber fluid and enough light could pass through near the base that you could see the carbonation. From a visual perspective they did a nice job designing this glass for this beer as it shows off all its strong points.  The banana of German weizen yeast is the first thing to tickle your olfactories. Then there's a grassiness arising from the wheat and some caramel as well. Noble hops make their presence known with some background floral notes. Yep, the glass works well to concentrate the aromas.  Caramelized bananas, like a hefeweizen dunkel, only smoother in body. There are also dark fruits and a touch of spice, maybe black pepper or cloves. The grassiness of the wheat is also present, but it's more through the nose than the palate. This glass does a nice job of melding all the flavors and aromas into a wonderful beer-drinking experience. I wonder if I'd like this just as much from a weizen glass.  There is no bitterness from the hops apparent. This beer finishes sweet and smooth with little aftertaste to deal with. All it leaves is you wanting more...and I could drink three or four of these and sleep well...on the floor...in a corner...fully dressed...or not.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,Nibbley,4.45,"Drank a bunch of these in Helen,Ga over Thanksgiving weekend last year. Pours a cloudy brown with ruby highlights. Aroma of warm banana bread, raisins and pumpkin pie. Huge thick and malty mouthfeel, nice tight carbonation. Smooth and warming finish. Probably the best Bock I've Had.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,zaphodchak,4.38,"2004 vintage, from a .5L bottle into a snifter, room temperature. 1 finger head, white lacing. Heavy apple nose and present in the taste; interseting, and only revealed by aging. Curiously transparent ruby body, mucho sediment. Quite sweet, almost like a cider (Unibroue's Ephemere comes to mind), apple and honey are dominant. Wheat is curiously absent, considering the style (and the flavor of a young Aventinus). Mouthfeel not exceptional, some prickling from coarse carbonation. Taste is incredibly drinkable, but the price for a vintage is prohibitive. For those capable of cellaring their own, that might be an option. Drinkability is high unless you cloy at sweeter beers.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,kwjd,4.33,"Pours a hazy ruby brown colour with thick white head and nice lacing. Smells of banana and cloves like a hefe, but then has a nice chocolate and cherry smell too. Flavour has a lot of sweetness, but not too much. Really balanced flavours. Alcohol is high in this beer, but I can barely notice it at all. Wonderfully drinkable.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,Reaper16,4.4,"500mL bottle - cave-aged 2005 vintage - served into a weissbier glass. I put on-tap because I've already reviewed the bottled version. I feel that the cave-aged version is different enough to warrant another review.  Pours a shade of brown just past amber. Burnt sienna, mayhaps. Like iced tea. Surprisingly not as purple as a fresh bottle. There's just enough translucency to see the carbonation streams (and if you couldn't see them then you could certainly HEAR them; this is a loud beer). The creme head sits at 2+ fingers, with less lace that I'm accustomed from a bottle of Aventinus. Might be an inadequately cleaned glass; I won't dock the beer points for that. Pretty lovely looking.  There is a whole lot going on in the nose. When you see a five year old bottle that has been aged in a damn cave for at least three years then you expect complexity -- cave-aged Aventinus delivers it. Lots of wheat, some of it having turned a bit sharp (though not quite sour) in age. The hefe-like scents have been muted or cannibalized in the years developing in the bottle; this is more like a traditional dopplebock than a fresh Aventinus. Those splendid Aventinus dark fruits are more harmoniously blended in with the rest of the beer than on a fresher example. Some fig sticks out on some smells but mostly it gets quickly drizzled with honey/chocolate malt aromas and joins the rest of the beer. Some crusty, toasted sourdough bread backs out the aroma. This is a fine example of all a beer's components working as a cohesive unit.  To wit: plum, fig, cocoa powder, wheat, overripe banana, sourdough bread, wild honey, black cherry, English toffee, a tiny bit of sherry-like oxidation flavor. Everything works together so very, very well. Again, this is more reminiscent of a dopplebock than a fresh Aventinus. If not for the wheat piquancy (and slight weizen yeast flavors) then this would be a stright-up dopplebock. Regardless, this is straight-up good.  This rendition of Aventinus has a lightness to its body that surprises me. Lots of heavy malt and tons of ester but the body feels medium-light in size. It will gain a lot of thickness if you swish the beer around in your mouth (because of the active carbonation), so you get the best of all worlds. Drinkability is good too. A respectable ABV% of 8.2 meets lots of complex flavors. The bottle size is just about perfect for one person.  I don't think I like this as much as a fresher version of Aventinus. But I still think it's a remarkable beer. Dazzlingly complex; a superb beer and testament to the lasting legacy of the German brewer's craft.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,DefenCorps,4.47,"Another remarkable oversight on my part. This is another excellent beer that I haven't revisited in about 2-2.5 years.  Pouring a moderately muddy reddish brown with red highlights, this beer has a dense, off-white head with excellent retention. Lacing isn't much, but none is really expected here.  The nose is wonderful. Rich, bready with a wonderful yeasty phenolic character, some chocolate, dark fruit (specifically plums and raisins) a mild clove character, a little bubblegum... this really is complex and wonderfully balanced. Caramel, a little vanilla and brown sugar are also present. The palate is just as remarkably balanced. Banana bread with chocolate chips drizzled with warm caramel and brown sugar come to mind, and despite plenty of sweet flavors, this never gets tiring on the palate. The wheat is noticeable, but never distracting, presenting a freshly baked dark wheat bread-like character. Clove, a little nutmeg and some cinnamon sugar are also present, particularly on the mid-palate. Raisins and plums also appear closer to the finish. The yeasty flavors aren't as prominent as the nose would suggest, though some phenolic character is present. Mildly sweet on the finish with a touch of alcohol, caramel and brown sugar, this is fabulous stuff. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this feels almost exceptional on the palate. This beer is just fantastic, and I'm ashamed to admit I've drunk as little of it as I have.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,StephenRich,4.53,"When I was first beginning to plunge into the world of real beer the Schneider Weisse Aventinus was among the first beers that proved to me that this would be a worthwhile adventure. George Schneider first brewed the Aventinus in 1907 in Germany as a wheat-doppelbock, and since then, it has achieved the highest accolades amongst its strong beer brethren.  First, let's take a moment to define this unique style of beer. A wheat beer is typically brewed with a large proportion of wheat to malted barley. In the German case, as we are discussing, they are always top-fermented, and hence are always ales. Wheat beers generally are very effervescent, refreshing, lively, and show flavors of clove, spice, vanilla, banana, and light fruit. A doppelbock is a classic German Starkbier (""strong beer""). A doppelbock is a lager (bottom-fermented) brewed with a large amount of rich, and usually dark malted barley. They emerged in the late eighteenth century as a variation on the old monastic strong beer brewed by monks to help them get through theLenten season. Doppelbocks are generally very rich in malt sweetness, dark fruit, chocolate, and are rarely if ever bitter.  What Schneider Weisse has done is created a top-fermented and bottle conditioned Wheat-Doppelbock! I know, big mouthful. But consider the light and refreshing characteristics of a wheat beer matched with the rich powerful flavors of a doppelbock. They have created a beer with amazing spice, excitement, complexity, and a hugely quenching body.  The original Aventinus comes in a classic German 500ml dark bottle with a rich gold and purple logo which bears G. Schneider & Sohn's original portrait logo and is 8.2% abv. Luckily, I have an Aventinus glasses, which really is my favorite beer glass, and is only are graced by the Aventinus itself.  Because of its wheat beer roots the Aventinus pour should be smooth and gentle but very lively. A lot of excitement brews immediately in the beer as a white airy and pillowy head begins to develop and peak just above the rim of the glass forming a perfect two and a half inch head. Still now there are a lot of bubbles pouring up from the beer hinting at its vibrant mouthfeel; however they do not help the head retain its life, and it will slowly fade to a mere film on the surface of the beer.  The color is a deep, opaque mahogany purple - very close to a reddish brown, ruby like, and very hazy. The nose is so excellent! It's filled with cloves, spice, bananas, rich plums, deep malt, bubblegum, dark chocolate, prunes and brown sugar. The nose on the Aventinus makes me want to dive right into the beer. I swear, no beer smells as appetizing as this - my mouth is watering right now!  And truthfully, as the nose promised, the flavor is so enticing: immediately you are hit with the richness of over ripe plums and dried fruit; spices like clove and coriander come at you from every angle; roasted malts and bittersweet chocolate float over your tongue; bubblegum and bananas mix with vanilla across the top of your palate creating a balance of smoothness at the perfect instance. The whole while, the crisp and quenching mouthfeel of the beer, which I can only describe as effervescent, makes the richness and caramel undertones of the beer just tingle on your palate. The carbonation opens you up for every sip! There's no bitter in the beer, and as it warms it really open up the floodgates and more rich malt and fruit comes out.  It's very satisfying, very quenching, uniquely complex, and an incredible treat to enjoy. I can't say enough good things about this beer - every time I have it I am reminded of why I love real beer so much. The combination of flavors in the beer also makes it a terrific pairing with so many foods. Almost anything rich that has been grilled or seared is going to be great, rich tomato pastas and lasagna, hearty cheeses and thick soups work brilliantly too. The best may be desert though; flourless chocolate cake with a plum and raisin reduction sauce is the ultimate pairing for this game-changing beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,CHickman,4.32,"Pours cloudy dark brown/orange in color with a small creamy off white head that stayed a long time; pretty good lacing that stuck to the glass.  Smells malty with hints of yeast, bread and banana; the malt is the strongest scent.  Tastes of sweet malt, yeast, light spices, roasted grains, fruit, clove, banana, caramel and faint floral hops. Not a typical wheat beer as it's dark, rich, roasted and sweet, and not zesty like most wheat beers; an excellent surprise that was very complex and tasty.  Mouthfeel is very crisp and smooth with a medium body and an overall sweet malty taste in the finish.  Very tasty and light, it goes down smooth and overall was a very good beer that breaks the mold of a Weisse beer! I highly recommend trying this beer.",Schneider Weisse G.

Smell: Smells delicious, bananas and cloves, yeast, sweet malt.  Taste: Spicy clove right away, bananas, sweet malt, clove helps to balance the malt sweetness nicely and become even more apparent as the brew warms further. Lots of layers of flavor.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, matches the taste profile perfectly.  Drinkability: It's very flavorful, many layers, and quite smooth. ABV lends a slight warming on the finish.

Minimal lace.  Smells strong of banana and caramel. This may be the best aroma ive ever had the privalidge of expieriencing.  Fruity and malty tasting, wonderful, bit of an off aftertaste that just makes my want to drink more.  Feels very smooth with minimal carbonation, creamy.  Very very drinkable. I realy cant belive its 8.2%. Hardly any alchohol taste to me at all. Very pleasent to drink and the longer beetween sips the more the aftertaste makes you need another.

Brew smells very yeasty; sweet chocolate malts, dark fruits, caramel, vanilla, bananas, spice. Wow great smell.  Tremendous stuff; so creamy and tasty - yeasts, spice, banana, chocolate in the finish. Can taste so many different flavors really is tremendous mouthwatering stuff. the balance is perfect. Extremely smooth, and only a slightly dry finish. Has a slight warming effect in the aftertaste as you drink. Wow this is one helluva brew.  I haven't had a lot of this type of brew, but I cant imagine it being outdone. This is one of those big unfiltered flavored brews that make you love beer all over again.

T: A really awesome beer. Perhaps the benchmark for this style. It's wonderfully easy to consume. It starts off similar to a dunkel weizen, but the bock character asserts itself, making this beer a very different animal. Earthy and bready, this brew has a fair amount of complexity. Banana flavors are prominent throughout.  M: Smooth, creamy feel. This beer goes down so easily. There's a nice, very slight hint of heat in the finish.  D: My favorite weizenbock.

Light banana, smoky clove, rye bread, toasted malt, faint toffee notes and a sprinkle of cocoa round out the perfectly balanced flavor profile. A full and creamy wheat-based mouthfeel complements the beer's profile nicely.  Perhaps not the very best tasting of this beer since I'm fairly certain this bottle has quite a bit of age on it. It's in good shape in terms of just holding up to age and oxidation but the flavors are much less punchy. It's none the less still the best example I've had of the style by a mile.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The bock part of this provides sweetness and breadiness. Smells..fresh and wet.  Sweet taste, very malty, but the spicy-cloveness keeps this from becoming a malt bomb. Brown sugar sprinkled over red overripe pear with a chunk of rye bread on the side. And still some herbal spice.  Feels a bit flat, though. Carbonation was lost a bit I think. Very drinkable. Good beer.  Update: Got a better bottle methinks. Carb was better and flavors more pronounced.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Aroma is some great plum and spice, along with a strong molasses and caramel.  Taste is similar to the smell with some rich dark fruit, but a ton of slightly burnt caramel leaving a little roasted bitter finish.  Very full bodied, but still super drinkable, as I have put down liters at a time. Fantastic brew.  Great example of the style, but I would say that 3-5 years is far too long to age this beer.

Sweet smell of wheat, fruit (primarily banana), and cloves. There are also hints of yeast and caramel.  Strong tastes of fruits, spices, and wheat. There are some hints of yeast, citrus and chocolate in there, but also a slight hoppiness that was rather surprising. The aftertaste has just the slightest bit of alcohol - this beer hides it pretty well.  Lower medium in body. Great carbonation level. Feels smooth and crisp, but leaves the mouth feeling a bit dry.

Three fingers of dense, off-white head developed and dissipated slowly to leave a creamy cap that lasted throughout the glass.  Smell: Very aromatic and awesome. Immediate sweet fruit overdose -- banana and apple -- and a lot of clove spice to tickle the nostril hairs. Woooo. It also has that sinister doppelbock edge with caramel and a hint of alcohol.  Taste: A perfect balance between doppelbock and weissbier. The flavor follows the lead of the aroma. Smooth and refreshing wheat, bananas, apples, and cloves; after that comes the toasty caramel malts and alcohol warmth of doppelbock.  Drinkability: Smooth. Creamy. Thirst quenching. Orgasmic. Numbing. I don't know what else to write. My first few sips almost drove me to tears. If there is a heaven, this is no doubt on tap.

After that, I get a pruny sensation, then a very light lemon and grassy note. I'm pretty sure I like it more than I thought I would, There's a bit going on, but it all works well together.  Mouthfeel is good - it's light- to medium-bodied, with reasonable carbonation and a slightly malty finish.

Schneider promo, I was served Aventinus in it's own glass, which I got to keep. It's pours a deep, cloudy, leather-brown with red hues. Even though it's dim in Toronado, no light passes through this ale. Lots of carbonation and a two-finger head. Lots of immediate lacing which seems to collapse under its own weight and doesn't stick  S: The Bavarian yeasts are very noticeable with banana and clove as the most prominent scents. Some citrus is also in there.  T: This tastes exactly like it smells with banana and clove washing over your tongue. The hops nicely balance the malty sweetness with citrus notes, leaving a perfectly clean finish. The 8% alcohol is completely hidden, even as the beer warms, but a bready, chocolaty undertone becomes noticeable. These flavors work perfect together and are remarkably balanced.  M: One of the more viscous and creamy wheat ales I've had (I've avoided wheat ales because of my dissatisfaction with a lot of the popular American varieties) Definitely the consistency of a 'big' beer.  D: With the amazing balance it's hard to stop drinking this. I could easily drink 4 or 5 more but I have to drive home. There are enough layers of flavors to keep any beer geek interested, but I can't imagine anyone who likes beer not liking this.  Notes: Well, I think this is going to be my gateway drug to German beer. I've had a few here and there, but I find many of the American beers that call themselves 'Hefeweizens' complete boring, which led me to avoid 'real' hefeweizens, and I haven't had a wheat ale in a long time. Not to mention, when I moved to San Diego, I found Karl Strauss (which used to specialize in German-style beer) to be the weaker of the amazing local breweries (not so much anymore, Karl Strauss has really stepped up their game). Schneider Aventinus just completely converted me, thank god Toronado SD sent out their promo email.

Pours with a creamy off white head. Lacing all the way down as I drink.  Smell - I can get all the smells of a german wheat. The wheat, clove and even a tiny bit of banana. What I can also find is a nice sweetness, a bit of roastiness and maybe even a little chocolate. As it warms some dark fruits can be found.  Taste - The wheat is right there, tons of wheat. The clove, banana, chocolate and fruits all come out, as the nose indicated. This is an awesome beer. There is some great wheaty sweetness and a bit of yeasty and bready malt. The fruit seems to be plum or something similar. The taste that lingers is almost caramel like.  Mouthfeel - Very smooth, carbonation is where it should be, body is thick but not chewy. Not as heavy as I thought it would be but it works well. The taste lasts awhile due to a bit of a syrupy texture.  Drinkability - You wouldn't be able to tell this was over 8% Drinks like a 5% hefe.

72,224,Lars3,5,"I generally try to refrain from reviewing beers that I know I love, beers that make me salivate at the mere mention of them, but sometimes I make an exception and post a completely biased and unscientific review of a beer I think is perfect. This is one of those beers.  A: A beautiful dark mahogany (I've seen Mercedes-Benz this color) that lets almost no light through. In an Aventinus glass this beer is a piece of artwork. The head comes up and over the rim of the glass and just hovers there before settling down and leaving a constant white outline on the top of the beer. I love the way the yeast creates mini-clouds inside of the beer after the initial pour before dispersing evenly throughout the beer.  S: Aventinus as the banana and clove that you'd find in a lesser weizen, but it also has hints of chocolate and dark fruits that are not only surprising to find in a weizen, but also exceptional for more traditional bocks and doppelbocks.  T: So good. I need to have a few of these on hand at all times, but I never have more than one or two a month. It is a beer that is too good to be consumed everyday. It needs to be savored and reserved for special occasions. The same dark fruit and chocolate flavors melt over the malty yeastyness that would be found in other weizens. There is a sweetness that comes out as the beer warms, but it is perfectly balanced by the hops.  M: I actually prefer the mouthfeel of Hefeweizens and Dunkelweizens to this, but it is still a wonderful thing to hold in my mouth. There is a subtle sting at the back of my throat, but otherwise this beer goes down perfectly. This is dessert in a glass.  D: Oh God does this beer go down smooth. If it wasn't for the 8%+ abv and the $4+ price tag I'd probably find more ""special occasions"" to enjoy this beer.

72,224,Chizoad,4.15,"First time having this style.  Poured into a glass probably better suited to porter. As such, the impressive tan head with fizzy carbonation throughout faded away to nothingness. No lace, no film. The beer itself is a cloudy brown that is actually quite pretty if you hold it up to the light. The edges almost look like a hefeweizen, but with a slight purplish tint. Very nice.  Smells like roasted malts, molasses, and suggestive of flowers. Like a slightly deeper hefeweizen without the frills.  The taste is the same as the nose, to a t. There's bitterness and even some sourness up front that fades to a lingering sweetness. The sweetness enhances the roasted malt. The floral wheat flavors come and go.  Low carbonation. Probably all was gone in that head. Surprisingly light body. Would be really perfect on an early fall day when there's a little crispness in the air, because there's enough alcohol in it to provide a little warmth.

Pours a nice mud brown with dense cloudiness. Four finger head of off white bubbles form and leaves great lacing. Excellent head retention and carb. As a weizen lover, I'm enamored!  Smells like a strong dunkel weizen, rich banana with a nice raisin and some sweet dark fruits. A slight brown sugar sneaks in.  Taste similar, but wow! This has an excellent potent flavor. The banana, raisin and fruit are all there, with a nice sweet caramel in the middle. As the beer warms the spices come out to frolick, cloves with some pepper. Bready malts mixed in. Delectable.  The mouthfeel is a little smoother than a normal dunkel, it's pretty sticky with only a slight carbonation tingle.  All 8.6% ABV are completely... Absent. This is extremely and dangerously drinkable.

My first review of this beer was far below the average reviewer, and I suspected it was due to a badly handled bottle. I picked up a second bottle and was impressed.  I still like the way the beer looks, but this bottle produced a much more controlled head than the previous batch. The taste was much better than I remembered. Complex and rich, its a mixture of chocolates, grains, and dark fruits. Sneaky drinkability with none of the harshness I previously noticed.

Menu lacks any information. Served in a commemorative Aventinus tall glass.  A - Amber brown haze with visible carbonation climbing up. Shows a large wheat foamy head with good retention, surface memory, and lacing.  S - Wheat and yeasty smell, with a nicer tone of spices and dark fruits, clove, and sweetness. Not as rich as the bottled form, this might be a bit too cold...  T - Rich wheat taste with a long range of spices and a bitter-sweet citrus balance. Again nice, but lacks a touch of the depth of the bottled form.  M - Medium-high body with similar carbonation and a thickness in texture that gently makes it stand apart from its lighter cousins.

72,224,jpkoch1962,4.88,"One of the outstanding beers of its kind. Thie Dopplebock (with a large dose of Wheat in the mash bill) is a near perfection of the brewing process.  It pours a deep auburn brown. The dextrins of this beer force the cabronation bubbles to the top in one long glorious chain to form thick, long lasting creamy head. Aroma of cloves, choclate and bubble gum fill ones senses.  The taste is truly complex. This beer has the character of a dunkles weizen and a dunkles bock. But this beer has a crisp clean taste that one doesn't expect from a Weizenbock. The body is full of dextrins -it is full with a smooth carbonation that keeps it from being cloying. Yet, both the front end and the middle of this beer have all of the flavor of a Wiezenbock. Spicy cloves, bannana, and bubble gum can be detected. Yet, the phenols are by no means over powering. This beer finishes with a clean, dry, crisp ending that is quite refreshing. Alcohol cannot be detected until the finish, but it doesn't overpower. Which makes this beer quite deceptive. It""s 8.2% ABV demands respect. It is not meant to be guzzled.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The smell is good, but I had only seconds to smell the beer before my hand grabbed the glass and put it to my lips.  This beer tastes better than it looks. It's surprisingly complex but never confusing. Its taste is unique, but devoid of gimmicks. On the whole, it is masterfully balanced wheat beer with a taste you'd be hard pressed to find replicated anywhere else.  The level of carbonation is good and Aventinus is a pleasure on the mouth. It's a little on the viscous side, but it's hard to imagine it any other way.  This is one of my all-time favorite beers and I always get excited to drink one.

Taste: Sweet cloves and malts at the beginning, with a strong yeast finish that has hints of sweet alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Rather full-bodied with balanced carbonation and a warm finish  Drinkability: This is an excellent beer- very much like a Belgian beer that also has characteristics of a hefeweizen.

The main fruit notes I got were banana and raisins.  T: The taste is very similar to the taste, not much at all in the way of hops, although there was a tad of bitterness at the end. This is mostly a sweeter/grainer beer.  M: Medium bodied, but still pretty crisp due to it being on the higher end of the carbonation scale.  D: I don't really know what it was about this beer, but for some reason I really enjoyed the first half, but was much less excited about the second half.

Strong scents of banana and clove permeate as soon as the beer is poured; very vibrant with pepper, nutmeg, and yeast scents as well. Mouth whetting and very pleasant on the nose.  Three large fingers of light brown to dark tan dense, and fluffy head rest upon a dark chestnut hued body; excellent head retention.  Tastes of banana up front with honey-like sweet grain. Raisins, a dash of nutty flavor, and hints of clove are thrown into the mix. Is that bubblegum as well? I believe it is. Finish is medium in length (I confess that I am not sure what a medium length is, but the flavors don't linger very long). Bitterness hits very early on but never rises above a mild/moderate level. Helps to balance the substantial malt profile. I believe the length of the finish does a great job of increasing drinkability because the flavors just work so well together its near impossible to not have another sip  Highly carbonated with a medium body and a light mouthfeel that coats the tongue  Overall a deliciously malty Weizenbock with great balance; complex, drinkable, and utterly enjoyable.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,Walken,4.5,"Schneider & Sohn: Aventinus, Weizenbock (2008) (Tasted 06/03/10) 16.9 oz. bottle into a cervoise goblet.  Appearance: Hazy, dark brown beer with ruby highlights capped by a teeny off-white head of tight bubbles, good retention, minimal lacing. Odor: Dried banana and currant, whiffs of clove, powdered sugar and burnt caramel. Consistency: High end of light bodied with a surprisingly assertive level of carbonation for an 8.2% bock that has been sitting in the fridge for two years. Taste: Flavors of powdered sugar, dried banana and a distinct yeast-derived ripe, red fruitiness that is amplified by the tangy wheat and slight oxidation, contributing a slightly tart edge to this beer. Sweetness is prevalent, but there is a semi-bitter roasted character to this beer that promotes some semblance of balance, even after the initially minimal bitterness has faded. Finish shows a shift in direction, roasted chocolate flavors become more intense and leave a nice combo of dry chocolate and tart, fruity, wheat tang on the tongue.  I was hesitant to post tasting notes on a two year old beer, but this one really shined after aging, on par, scorewise, with a fresh bottle. Drink it.",Schneider Weisse G.

Very complex with lots of wonderful fruit tastes. This paired with the wheat makes a sweet and fruity pair.  Drinkability: Take it slow with this one. But for how much flavor it has -- it's very doable. With how much comes in one bottle (500mL ?), you'll only need one.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

I get the top-fermented estery banana of a Belgian ale along with a yeasty slice of white bread.  Taste: This beer calls itself a top-fermented dopplebock ale. Thats what you get in the taste. There is a fruitiness belying a dopplebock. This is, I imagine, indicative of a weizenbock, but it is an unusual blend given the German origins of this beer. Additionally, I found that it left a sour aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: It is a little slick, but the carbonation is pleasant.  Drinkability: Not really a fan. I found the pint bottle more than enough.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,charlesbyrd,4.65,"Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a weizen glass.  A: Pours a hazy rust brown with glimmers of orange at the edges of the glass. There's a noticeable amount of carbonation crawling up the edge of the glass, very aggressive. A thick tan head sits atop the brew and continues to regenerate with this heavy supply of bubbles. There didn't seem to be a terrible amount of sediment in this bottle, even though it is unfiltered and bottle conditioned.  S: Very sweet at first, I initially get the aroma of chocolate covered fruit. There's also a definite clove scent, and maybe even some caramel (there's alot going on here!). I gives off that unique Belgian-y aroma, even though it's not. Once I let the beer warm up a little, the chocolate aroma makes more of a prominent impression.  T: Like no other beer I've ever tried, the Aventinus changed immensely over the course of my tasting. At first, I got mostly a sugary sweetness paired with mild spice. I can definitely see where other reviewers get that ""stewed fruit"" taste from. There's really no bitterness at all to this beer, just a nice vanilla end at the back of the throat. Again, I must recommend that you pace yourself with this one. As the beer warms up, the flavors start to mellow out as the sweetness gives way to the dark chocolate malt and clove. All the while, it still maintains its characteristic wheat base.  M: At first, I thought I might need a spoon for this one. It's not creamy like a stout, but it has a definite oily texture that allows the flavors to linger on the tongue for a while. The alcohol is mildly pleasant and adds a subtle warming effect through the whole event.  D: This is a wonderful beer and one of my favorite tasting experiences. It was so much fun to sit with this beer and sort out all the flavors as they moved in and out of the spotlight. I will admit that the sheer complexity of the Aventinus makes it far from sessionable, but I would love to pair it with a tart dessert, maybe a cheesecake, to play against the sweet and spicy character.  My roommate picked up a Schneider Weisse the other day and I'm looking forward to comparing it to this, its ""massive twin,"" as the brewer calls it. High hopes!",Schneider Weisse G.

Lots of Belgianesque malts and spice on the nose. Cloves, possibly nutmeg, a little bit of banana and a hint of grapes.  Tipping back the glass reveals lots of rich wheat flavor, spice (but not as strong as the nose) and sweet malts. Caramel, candy sugar and a hint of banana. A little bit of estery fruitness. Ends with a touch of bitterness and vanilla bean.  Mouthfeel is prickly, a bit spicy and well carbonated. Somewhat chewy with a hint of warming alcohol.  Drinkability is good. Flavorful and the ABV is slightly noticeable, but not in the way. A good example of the style. Probably wouldn't want more than one bottle.  All in all, this is a pretty tasty beer.

Tastes sun-kissed and decently sweet, with a strong nutty, wheaty presence and a lot of Belgian-like esters and spice. Body is light, but carbonation adds a nice crisp crunch to its otherwise watery texture. The alcohol is well-integrated and comes through as a pleasant warmth after a few sips.

Said head receded almost immediately, which was surprising considering how dense it was. Lacing is present but uninspiring.  S: A vast array of aromas reside in this beer. I smell some vanilla and caramel sweetness along with banana and plum fruit notes. In addition, there is a good amount of spicy aroma in the form of salt, clove, and paprika.  T: A somewhat hot spiciness greets my mouth in the flavor of cayenne pepper (I know, weird) and clove. This rolls over into a fruity, sweet character, with banana, vanilla, and some light chocolate flavors emerging as the beer warms.  M: In a word, exciting. The beginning of each sip brings a blast of sharp, biting, spicy acidity to my tongue. This is followed by a light to medium spritzing of carbonation. For sheer originality, I rate this mouthfeel high.  D: For the style, I think this is quite drinkable. Bock beers are not my favorite, but this brew has a lot to offer in terms of complexity and think-ability.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Malts give off some caramel and toffee. Really complex.  T: The flavor profile for this style is the bees knees. Absolutely complex. Yeast, again, dominates the flavor; lots of banana (not too much), some clove, band-aids, coriander, orange peel, cardamom, and cinnamon? Spicy flavor, but balanced well. The malts give caramel, and lots of toffee. Dark fruit is apparent but less pronounced than in the nose; slight fig, apricot, overripe red and granny-smith apples. Alcohol is slightly noticeable, but hidden enough- giving you that warming feeling in the chest.  MF/D: Viscous, creamy feel to it. Carbonation is medium, with a slight tingle. This stuff is highly drinkable despite the ABV.  Notes: Very delicious brew, well worthy of the #1 Weizenbock. I imagine that this would pair well with apple pie or baked apricot Brie",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,AgentZero,3.75,"A - Dark brown, reddish on the edges with a decently looking good tannish head.  S - Sweet candied malts with a lot of dark fruit in there. Actually get a solid amount of alcohol on the nose, not surprising for the ABV considering this style.  T - Very fruity, mostly dark, with a carmel malt backbone and it runs a little bit hot with the alcohol. Good, I actually think the alcohol helps cut down an overpowering sweetness in this beer.  M - High carbonation, but I like it on this beer, helps once again to cut into the sweet malty backbone of this.  D - Pretty drinkable, but a high ABV on the style keeps it slightly less drinkable than you would expect.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,StJamesGate,4.05,"Pours cloudy nut brown with a tall tan cola head that fades to nothing. Typical waxy yeast, weizen sourness, spice and a phenol band-aid pong on the nose. Irish brown soda bread malts, a stewed apple ester middle and plum pudding spice ending. Lingering chocolate, medium, some chew, definite burn.  Not much at a glance, but steps it up with some complex flavor. One to linger over.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,dwilson01,4.4,"Poured from a 500ml into my arrogant bastard pint glass, Huge fluffy barely off white head, super creamy. The body is a dark caramel maple syrup in color, like mahogany wood, or just dark brown if you prefer the simple explanation.  Head dissipates at medium speed, leaves a clean glass but releases a ton of great scent. Very fruity, I get mango and banana swirling with some alcohol esters. More distinct sweetness comes through as well, chocolate malt, caramel and some spicing as well though mainly fruity and sweetness come through but it's thick.  The flavor is awesome, Tons of banana, strawberry, apricot, and mango, like an amalgam of fruit. The extra wheat malt makes itself known, smooths out the flavor and enhances the sweet character of it, not a sugary caramel though. I get a nectary clover honey combined with a thicker more chocolatey syrup.  The mouthfeel and drinkability go hand in hand, this brew is smooth as silk, I mean it feels almost like a stout but definitely has a lot more lightening flavor characteristics and it's not super thick. The smoothness makes it go down dangerously easy.  If you like wheat beers you will love it, if you like doppelbock and fruit you will love it, if you like all those then you'll love it. I recommend for sure.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,jpittman80,4.1,"A - Deep brown, reddish-brown when held up to light. Good head at first, but this soon dissipates to the edge of the glass. Some slight lacing.  S - Bananas, sweet and chocolate malts blend very nicely. This almost produces a bacon/salty quality, or something like it. But hey, when is bacon ever not appropriate? Also, a wheat malt presence  T - Bananas and sweet malt, mainly, with wheat characteristics. Very, very small hops flavor in the finish. What prevents this from being overly sweet is the full carbonation. Which brings us to...  M - Almost too carbonated. But as stated above, this is required for taste balancing. But it does give the impression of a thin body, which I don't think is the case.  D - Very refreshing, excellent flavor make this one of the best tasting weizenbocks around.

Leaves a pretty sticky and creamy lacing around the glass.  Aroma is very sweet and pleasant. Tons of fruits, spices...caramel, and booze. This surprises me, I thought German beers were only brewed with the 4 main ingrediants of beer. Overall, this beer smells awesome and my mouth is watering!  Medium-semi complex body...WOW! This beer has really impressed me, I didn't see this coming. Clean and crisp, yet ever so creamy and smooth! Carbonation is just right, on the higher side. Beer really reminds me of a great Belgian tripel, rather than a Doppelbock. Tons of fruit flavors, Belgian like-yeasts, malty. Either way, it's very, very good! For 8% ABV, it actually feels like more...but at the same time, extremely drinkable! A little bit of a nut flavor as it warms up. Overall-GREAT beer! A must try!",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,Bouleboubier,4.74,"One of my all-time favorites, bar none. The taste has become my ideal for a doppelbock - a taste by which I measure all rivals. Schneider just makes damn fine beer. Malty, yeasty, strong, and bold. Goes great with grilled meats and flatbreads and it's flavor is never compromised. Very impressive.  I had a 2 liter (2-story) mug of this about 3-4 weeks ago at Brauhaus Schmitz in Philly - the most of it I had in one sitting. It was just about too much. I wouldn't suggest drinking even that much of it at once. You don't have to. One bottle alone will make a man out of you. One bottle and you're hooked for life. I've been to a couple places that serve it in a pint glass. I got no problem with that.  The eisbock version of this is still pretty good, but the balance of flavor, body and alcohol are so perfect on the original that the extra kick on the stronger issue delicately destroys the dream.",Schneider Weisse G.

The alcohol is present in the scent, with a good bit of sweetness, most likely caramel. There is also a fruitiness to it that reminds me of banana. The taste follows the scent almost to a T where the combination of the flavors linger in the aftertaste. It isn't too sweet so I can enjoy it.",Schneider Weisse G.

Constant stream of fuzzy bubbles rise from the start.  S: Woah. Alot here. Dark fruits like raisins, some clove, and a smidgin of alcohol. There's so much here, it's hard to differentiate.  T: I don't know how anyone reviews this, there's so many flavors attacking the pallette at once. Raisin is heavily present, with hints of other dark fruit. Spices to are also present, tho I have no idea what.  M : On the easier end of heavy bodied, and very rolly. Smooth, like most wheat beers.  D : I don't think I could handle more than the 500ml bottle I had of this. It just too much going on. But it's incredibly unique and delicious. I've never had anything with so many flavors.  I admit, this isn't my type of beer. It's so complex and active that for some reason my feeble mind & palette can't focus. They were utterly blown away.

Pours an initially clear and tepid dark mahogany brown color before giving the end of the bottle a swirl and pouring the remaining yeast into the glass. Settles in a murky deep brown, reddish color with plenty of sediment. A large, light tan head slowly fades to a finger thickness and streaks of lacing. Aroma is yeasty, dark fruits, cloves and bananas, but fairly mild and restrained. Flavor is as expected for the style and the most balanced representation I've tried. Strong weiss flavors of banana and clove with rich malt complexity like a bock. Very smooth, full body with light, but sharp carbonation. Finish is mildly sweet, fruity and clean. Alcohol is warming, but never really presents itself in the flavor.

If you like rich complex malty wheat beers this is it.  Mouth feel: Very good carbonation, very smooth on the palate.  Drinkability: Very Drinkable, so smooth and the alcohol is well masked, that may be a bit dangerous in that regard.

Clove is present as well as plums and the slightest hint of chocolate. It's an earthy aroma. The chocolate makes itself more present in the taste. There's also a dark fruit mixture (figs, plums, raisins, and cherries) going on. Clove and nutmeg also make an appearance. It's got quite a bit of carbonation, but feels creamy and of some viscosity. The hefe-weiss aspect of this beer really helps with the drinkability. I tend to find most doppelbocks too sweet, but this didn't have that effect at all. In fact, drinkability is downright scary. No doubt I will be having this one again.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Rich fruits greet you up front, with plenty of sweet spices, and even a hint of some Old Bay seasoning.  Flavors start with banana, and are quickly followed by prune, apples, and over-ripened cherry. Some of the sweet clove-like spice maintains its appearance in the background.  Creamy for a wheat, but just enough carbonation to keep this high ABV beer from being cloying. Little thin, but acceptable for the style.  As with most heavy wheats, it's a sipper (and a burper)... thoroughly enjoyed, but could not have put down more than two.",Schneider Weisse G.

S - Big candy and dark fruit notes, noticeable alcohol characteristics, burnt sugars, caramel, bananas, nice roasted notes.  T - Bananas, burnt sugars, dark fruits, boozy alcohol, sweet caramel finish.  M - Light to medium bodied, fizzy carbonation, semi-dry finish.  D - The alcohol needs to settle down a bit for me to really enjoy this one. That said, it's 12.5% and it sure doesn't taste like that.

S- Sweet, over ripe banana, moist bread, nuts, clove and some faint dark fruits and a wheaty/alcohol twinge. Very nice.  T- More of that really nice, sweet, over ripe banana and nuts and moist bread. Its just like banana nut bread. Lots more dark fruits and sugars. Plums and raisins and cherries on the finish.  M- The body is on the lower end of full but very fluffy and smooth.

Upon my first taste, I was wondering if this was a joke - I didn't think it possible to taste so many things at once. But it's not busy - it's just rich, mature and full. Not really filling in a bad way, either - more like a contentedness, the way you should feel after a meal hits the spot. Clearly, this beer has impacted me - probably the most delicious beer I've had in the last 5 years - which includes a few pints of 2010 Pliny the Younger (totally different thing; fine, fine beer) but this Aventinus Doppel is like nothing else.  Mouthfeel: this is a medium body beer that offers hints of what full bodied brews do to the palate; why not just enjoy the hints and not bother with feeling so full? It feels like it might have some decent alcohol in it but you don't feel like you're getting your ass kicked  Drinkability: it's easy to want to drink two pints of these - with the right drinking partner, a friend and I could put away three of these. It might be 8.2 abv but that doesn't make it any less appealing. 8.2 feels sneaky - nothing cloying or soaking about this brew.  Serving size: 16.9ozs",Schneider Weisse G.

Muddy scat brown with a HUGE head. Head looks great, beer looks like something that came out the rear end of a dog that ate a box of laxatives. But if it tastes good, I don't really care if it doesn't look so appealing.  Smell is awesome!! Baked bread malt, crusty and fresh. Banana, clove from the 4 vinyl guaiacol. Chocolate traces and wheat.  Taste is simply legendary. Perfect 5. This is the quintessential Weizenbock. Tastes like a sweet banana clove liquor. Chocolate and vanilla add to the depth. This is just perfect.  Mouthfeel was really good as well. Perfect body provides enough of a reminder that this is a 8.2% with its significance. Carb adds just enough tingle to keep it vibrant and refreshing.  Drinkability was amazing. This went down so easy, I could drink lots and lots.

God, thank you for making this beer. Indirectly. But thank you. Chocolate covered bananas, vanilla, clove, spice cake, chocolate drizzled tangerines, yeast dryness on the finish. Such a dark beer, yet so powerfully bright and consuming of all the senses. Finishes pretty clean leaving just a bit of tanginess from the wheat.  Body is quite heavy, but broken apart quickly with a dancing and zippy carbonation. Never settles in one area, but instead chooses to run about through the mouth as quickly as possible.  I think this is possibly the easiest drinking beer in the 8% category. It just goes down so absurdly easy, and then it's all gone.

The taste is a toxic, vibrant, fizzy mix of the aforementioned aromas, a little too sweet in my opinion with the vanilla and banana flavours coming through the most. Add a large hunk of treacle toffee into the taste arena and you've got the right amount of sweetness I found.

Then comes those typical weizen notes of banana/clove etc. The rich sweetness comes back after that but interestingly the wheat contributes a beautiful tartness to the finish that I really enjoy. That being said, it doesnt clean it up totally, the sweetness lingers long after you finish the mouthfull, as well as the wheat notes. Mmmmm.  Really nice in the mouth.

Upon more smelling roasted grains and chocolate malts show up, some apricots as well. This is a full, beautiful nose.  T: The initial flavor is platter of dark fruits and nuts dripping with sweet nectar and honey. Apricot, dates, very ripe bananas, something like pecans (maybe even hazelnuts?) and light cloves grace the palate up front. Move back through the taste experience and you will find rich yeast-laced wheat and malt, the essence of a lighter body red wine, sweet chocolate and cherries. Sweet when it needs to be, but not fake or syrupy. A slight metallic aftertaste is this fine brew's only (and slight) blemish. This might be due to the age of this bottle as well.  M: Literally sticky in my mouth and the back of the throat. Otherwise not a heavy bodied beer, which is interesting to me, I have never felt that combination before. Still very carbonated and maybe even a bit to much so, surprising to me after 3 years.  D: Beautifully drinkable. Nothing more to say!

72,224,jjanega08,4.36,"A= pours a hazy light brown color. Sort of a ""muddy"" homebrew color with a nice three finger head on it that is just off white color and holds nice retention and lacing in the glass. The color just isn't that great on this one though.  S= Nice wheat smell as well as nice sweet candy smell to it! Caramel and toffee like character in it. Delicious smelling! I can't keep my nose out of it it smells so sweet and candy like. I find that bocks as a style are a little too one dimensional with the sweetness but the wheat in this really balances out the bock character. Nice doughyness to it and maybe a little heat?  T= Just like the smell. Starts out just like candy on the tip of the tongue. Nice sweet caramel and toffee flavors in it that sort of mellow out in the middle of the tongue before giving way to a nice wheat finish. Doughy finish almost. Tastes to me like eating some sort of doughnut of other sweet dessert cake sort of thing. Really nice and impressive.  M= Smooth and creamy. Nice crisp wheat finish that doesn't linger around too long.  D= Nice beer. Really like they style (this is my first dabble). The sweetness from a bock works perfectly with the smooth crispness of wheat. excellent.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Schmaltzy,4.12,"A- Murky light brown amber/ruby color with 1/2 finger head that releases to a light ring of foam around the edges of my glass.  S- Right away get a interesting soy sauce scent with cloves and baking spices and bannana. Very interesting smell, waiting to see if they match the taste.  T- Nice, very similar to the scent profile. Nice malt taste with bananna covered with cloves, baking spices, and yes a touch of soy sauce.  M- Medium body with good amounts of carbonation throughout.  D- Very easy to drink beer even with 8%+, still a session beer if you are looking for a malt fix.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,VTaler,4.55,"A - Dark And cloudy - nice head with a a tan color S - old BBQ sauce with cloves and bananas T - Tastes kinda like BBQ sauce. Bananas and Cloves with little chocolate notes. It tastes like a beer but it has the reminisce of spices, molasses, and dark dried fruit like figs or dates. Overall a very soothing/complex flavor but not to intense M - Nice Low Fizz and thick mouthfeel D - Very good",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Fnerk,4.73,"This Schneider weizen bock pours a dark ruby, though the head was a bit thin which I attribute to sneaking a half pint before opening the growler for the session proper. Probably lost a bit of gas to the air space thus created--my bad, but with stuff like this it's hard to wait!  Appearance - dark ruby, with a cloudiness appropriate for the style. Again, a half-finger head due to the growler mishandling, but no big deal, reduced to a fine cap with good lacing in a few minutes.  Aroma - typical banana/coves, but the sweet thing here is it's not overdone as is so common with regular weizens. The dark malt cuts through to balance things out, quite nice.  Taste - Yummy. Perfect malty profile, and just the right touch of bittering hops.Banana, cloves, currants...perfect.  Mouthfeel - lovely. no too much carbonation, and medium-bodied for what could have been a malt/wheat bomb. Not syrupy, just a perfect viscosity.  Drinkability - could be quite the session brew if it weren't for the 8.2% alcohol content.  Schneider never fails to deliver. What a great brewery and it's great that Garret Oliver is involved with creating beers at this brewery. :)",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BeanBone,4.16,"Appearance: An amazingly hazy brown body capped by a simply massive fluffy off-white head that measures over four fingers. I'm glad I was a little cautious with the pour, otherwise this would have probably taken 20 minutes to get into the glass. The head fades slowly and leaves the barest patches of lacing.  Aroma: A mix of golden and dark fruits, lots of bubblegum, and rich spice over a sweet caramel-like malt body.  Flavor: Very similar to the nose, it's a mix of bubblegum yeast, apples, raisins, pepper and cloves on top of a grainy and biscuity malt backbone. It's well-balanced and reminiscent of Belgian beers. The alcohol is masked well, leaving nary a trace of its medium-high potency in the flavor. Biscuity malt.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and creamy with medium-high carbonation and a drying finish. Just a hint of warmth from the alcohol.  Drinkability: This drinks incredibly smoothly, so keep in mind the over eight percent alcohol content here.  Verdict: Thoroughly enjoyable from the crack of the cap to the bottom of the glass, it's easy to see why this classic garnishes so much praise. Complex yet highly drinkable, this is the best place to start if you're looking to explore the Weizenbock style.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,WeimtimeBier,4.69,"A- Nice off white pillowy head. Muddy caramel body body. Does not look incredibly inviting.  S- Awesome sweet bready smell, very yeasty aroma with some complex esters.  T- This is the king of the wheatbock. Very evident bread and yeast. A sweet alcohol is barely evident. There is also the most complex blend of esters. I get some banana like most weizen, and a predominent dark fruit. Figs I would say.  M- Very sweet thick malt. Heavy body and a bright tickly carbonation on the tongue.  D- Dangerously easy to drink. Very refreshing and although its thick, aventinus goes down smooth and easy. very enjoyable.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,exparte,4.32,Powerful aroma that's typical of a strong wheat: banana and clove esters with a substantial alcohol presence. Appearance is a cloudy reddish brown that's almost orange on the edges. Carbonation is light overall with a thin white head and virtually no lacing. Taste is primarily sweet with a significant bitter kick at the end. Very full bodied with a lingering sweet banana and clove finish. This is a fantastic beer. If you're a big fan of wheat beers then you owe it to yourself to try this one.,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,NittanyBeerFan,4.32,"Split a bottle of this one with my buddy, and poured it into a tulip glass.  A: The pour is one beautiful sight to behold. As the beer falls into my glass, the garnet colored liquid shines through with ruby colored hues. Not even a sign of head, even as I pour more aggressively. Light shines through, significantly diffused by the big body of the beer.  S: Caramel malts, a strong batch of cloves, and some nutty aromas pour forth from the mouth of the glass. They nearly cover up a spicy German hop presence, but I am able to discern it as I dig for other contributing elements in this beer.  T: Hoppy spices and cloves are very evident in the front. The flavor evolves to produce nutty and malty flavors that come through with some bittering elements that the hops evidently left behind at the beginning of the sip. The finish is slightly sour, adding more intrigue to an already compelling flavor profile.  M/D: Incredibly smooth. That lack of head was that way for a reason. I can't even feel a little tingle of carbonation, but somehow, Aventinus doesn't feel flat either. While there is no taste of alcohol, I do feel some warmth in the finish that detracts from the drinkability somewhat, but you could age one of these to deal with that if you really wanted to...",Schneider Weisse G.

Sweet smelling with plenty of wheat and some bready aroma as well. Taste is banana and bread up front with a clove spiciness. Some caramel sweetness with good biting carbonation. Deep and complex, yet clean and refreshing flavor.  Body is light with a smooth, clean feel making it an incredibly drinkable beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,beersteak,4.65,"One of the best beers I have ever had.  Nose is ripe with fruit and spices. Apples and cloves dominate but hints of allspice and bready yeast highlight.  Taste is a powerful experience of sharp but welcoming flavors. Follows the nose with the apples and cloves, but certainly with a nice bit of malt and yeast.  Mouthfeel is superb. Bubbly - effervescing with flavor and charm.  This is one of my favorites beers ever. I think it's a little more bready than the Ayinger Weizen Bock, and not quite as spicy sweet, but it's close.  If there is a beer equivalent of ""comfort food"" this is it.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,punkrkr27,4.02,"Reddish-brown pour with a small quickly fading off-white head. Sweet caramel aroma, with clove and bannana. Similar flavor with a dry wheat aftertaste. Medium body with moderate carbonation.

Light but fluffy head that recedes to a nice pitted cap & collar.  Noticeable soild dark compacted sediment toward the end of the bottle. Possible candidate for homebrew yeast harvest???  Plenty of aromas as the brew settles. Caramelized bananas foster, maybe some rum and mild raisan/grapes. Noticeable clove spicy aromas. Tastes as it smells on a solid wheat malt base. Caramel/toffee and wheat malt flavors on palate appropriattely supported by the yeast character as noted/listed in the aromas. Mouthfeel is appropriatte as a medium body, semi slick feel with medium+ carbonation with a dash of rum/booze warming.  Drinkability is exceptional for a 8.2% abv brew. This Weizenbock is a solid example of the style IMHO, it meets all the objectives I would look for in this style. Yeast character is not overdone, and equally supported by darker malts and caramel/toffee notes. A solid ""Imperial Dunkel"" instead of an ""Imperial Hefe"" like Vitus suggests.

A little banana and bread. A slightly sour flavor on the finish. Minimal bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Lots of carbonation makes for a tingly and foamy mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Really tasty. 8.2%?

Some of the sweetness can be attributed to the appleish cider like tastes. Theres a bunch of sugar in there. This beer had some sort of resemblance to the St Bernardus abt 12, but not quite as complex, and danked with sugar.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,FreshHawk,4.82,"A - Deep brown with a large foamy ivory head. Very good retention and a good amount of lacing left over.  S - Dark malt and chocolate along with a good amount of fruit (both dark fruit and banana). Faint spices too.  T - Dark malt flavors provide a base, which includes, chocolate and caramel along with some wheat flavors. On top of this is a good amount of sweetness from fruits. Fruits include dark fruits (plums, dates, figs, raisins, and cherries) as well as banana. Also has a bit of a bubblegum flavor and some spices (clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg being the major ones). A bit of a warming alcohol taste finishes the sip.  M - Medium to full body with a fairly high level of carbonation. Creamy and sticky feel make it feel even more full bodied.  D - Probably a bit too sweet and a bit too heavy (as well as too high an ABV) to have multiple ones of this in one sitting, at least consecutively. However, a sipper that I would gladly sip on again.  Notes: Really good beer. Good Hefe flavors mixed with the big, dark maltier flavors of a Doppelbock/BSDA. A bit like liquid candy/sweet juice and a bit like rum. Lots of good flavors, definitely a nice sipper.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Smell was intensely banana and clove yeast aromas, with a caramel sweetness and a slight fruitiness.  Taste was crisp clean and refreshing. Great spicy clove and banana flavor right off the bat, transitioned into toasty malt and caramel flavors. Crisp alcohol bite in the finish.  Mouthfeel was crisp and refreshing. Not quite medium-bodied but not too thin. Drinkability is good.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,wahhmaster,4.43,"Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a Schneider Weisse weizen glass.  Appearance: Pours a dark brown color (like a doppelbock or dunkelweizen) with a medium-sized tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves considerable lacing.  Smell: Smells strongly of chocolate, caramel, and dark fruits like cherries or grapes. Has a rich roasted malt smell to it as well. It kind of reminds me of a doppelbock with a little more fruit character to it.  Taste: Starts bitter and yeasty like most unfiltered wheat beers. Develops into a sweet, malty flavor that finishes with dark fruit notes. Has noticeable flavors of chocolate, caramel, vanilla, banana, and a little spiciness. Very complex and very tasty.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied yet still crisp and refreshing.  Drinkability: A truly superior brew. I've waited a long time to try this one and the wait has paid off.

Aroma of clove, banana, brown sugar and plum. Taste is sweet with plenty of caramel and brown sugar, as well as fruity notes of dried fruits like raisin and plum. Clove and banana dominate. One of the more clove heavy brews I have had. Wheat really only comes through in the very finish, but adds a great smoothness. Medium to full body, but with a great smooth texture that is all weizen, with none of the cloying stickiness that I take issue with when drinking bocks. In fact, the finish is actually interestingly dry. Pretty drinkable, especially for this abv. I could see someone getting in trouble if they spent a night downing these.",Schneider Weisse G.

Finish: Banana, raisin, prune, clove, sweet & roasted malt  Mouthfeel: Medium body, smooth & thick with low/medium carbonation  Drinkability: Oh My ME, that was easy to drink! So smooth and decadent!  Overall Impression: This Weizenbock from Germany is hands down, the best one I've had to date. Very complex from start to finish.

72,224,damndirtyape,4.25,"Bottle (ID 09.233 1-2 0425 1809) poured into a Hefeweizen glass. No matter how much I swirled there was still a fair bit of sediment which would not come out.  Appearance: Hazy brown with gold highlights. Huge foam upon pouring, but it died down to 1/8"" thick. Some lacing at first, but it wasn't persistent. Towards the end practically no foam at all.  Smell: Cloves, hints of banana, with something spicy and sweet towards the end with a deep inhale.  Taste: Rich spicy flavor. Cloves dominate, but balanced with some sweetness (vanilla is more noticeable as the beer warms up). Quite enjoyable overall.  Mouthfeel: What seems like spicy carbonation on the tongue I think is the beer and is not carbonation since I'm not seeing anything bubbling up in the glass. Just right in thickness and smoothness.  Drinkability: This is probably the 4th time I've had this, and the first time and this time I enjoyed it as the middle two were not as good. I was going to give up on it but after having it tonight with a meal it's spot-on good and I'll definitely pick it up again. It's a beer for a meal (bacon and chicken schnitzel in this case) or over a long movie. Not a routine beer; more like a special occasion beer.",Schneider Weisse G.

Huge initial light mocha head, but it's so carbonated (much like soda) I hear the bubbles pop and the head dissipates into a ring around the glass within minutes. Good lacing is left behind though.  S: Sweet dark fruits, yeast and notably plums. Very pleasant smell, nothing overpowering and not alcohol notes.  T: Much like the aromas, but plumbs and yeast are the most dominant here. That dark plum sweetness and yeast funk make this great. Sweet malts are also evident.  M: Medium-heavy bodied with high carbonation. Makes for a very foamy texture and leaves a sweet fruitiness after each drink. It so carbonated it reminds me of a soda. Not that it's a bad thing though.  D: This is fantastic.

Raisins, dark fruits, and also a bit of the typical wheat beer smells- banana bunches etc. They really come together wonderfully. The beer actually reminds me a fair bit of Chimay blue in terms of the yeast smell and the dark fruits. There's sweet milkiness and also some herbs there. Really rich smell, seems Belgian to me. 4.5  T: sweet maltiness. Wheat. Chocolatey umaminess. The sweetness is very prominent though. To its credit the alcohol is completely concealed. One thing I can say is that it is a great food beer. The spiced chicken with vegetables I am eating really brings out the plummy notes in the beer, which actually makes it resemble Chimay blue even more. The food also brings out some smokiness to me. 4  M: nice and creamy and well carbonated. 4  D: It's too sweet to drink a lot of and personally it's not my favourite style.

Nice malty base to this one with a decent alcohol presence. Every piece of this brew is balanced... M: Surprisingly light mouthfeel, carbonation just about right. D: A masterpiece in a bottle.

The head is a this a this cream that crowns the cup into it's brown abyss.  Smell - Very similar to a bourbon with light alcohol level, the yeast provides a very pleasant aroma to the nose.  Taste - Begins very light and sweet. As the experience progresses, the yeast flavor hugs your throat lightly as it goes deeper in your mouth.  Mouthfeel - Begins as a moderate body, but as it progresses down, it gains some weight with the carbonation. Upon completion, it leaves a sweetness that makes this Beer unique.  Drinkability - It's deceptive: while light at first, it gets heavy as the experience progresses. Enjoyable, no doubt, but prefer less carbonation sting.",Schneider Weisse G.

Yeast notes build through the midstream, attempting to balance the sweetness. Still quite malt forward. Some graininess is present. No hopping. Finishes with the smooth sweet note, more of the caramel note.  M - Moderate to strong body, carbonation sting is coming through strongly as well. Leaves behind a clinging sugar sweet resin.

Nice wheaty aftertaste.  Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Minor carbonation, but a bit of sting on the finish. Alcohol warms in the mouth. Syrupy thick mouthfeel.

Head was thin and did not even last the first couple sips. No lacing.  Smells of caramel and sugary candy. There is a smell I can't put my finger on but it tastes like that smell as well.  Deep caramel and roasted sugar taste. It's almost as if it's like the toasted sugar on top of creme brule. Ever so slight toasty flavor in the malt.  Mouthfeel is good.

The beer pours an ice tea brown color with very good head retention and OK lacing. On the nose, this is just lovely stuff. The beer has a sweet ice tea aroma, but with chocolate, cinnamon, and light clove. The blend of aromas is wonderful. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this fairly sweet beer, but the extended aging has imparted a lightness and delicacy that is remarkable. The sweet malt shines through beautifully in this beer, but with just enough underlying spice to counter the sweetness (which age has dialed down anyway). Mouthfeel is light, rich and long lasting... this truly is just an incredible beer. Drinkability is so good, that this beer is dangerous. What age has done to this beer is truly astonishing.... just excellent. I wonder if Casey will let me buy the rest. Yes, it truly is that good.",Schneider Weisse G.

Also a nice malt backbone with a firm wheat flavor and a nice additional raisin/green apple fruitiness. Some added spices are noticeable as well like a bit of nutmeg. Hops are minimal and seem to act only to keep the beer from cloying. The fruity and spicy yeast-derived flavors are the real stars here.

Absolutely picture perfect.  S- Smells of candy malt and huge wheat aromas dominate the nose like a fresh loaf of artisanal bread. There's some mild spiciness kicking around in here- clove? along with some yeast aromatics.  T- Sweet malt hits the palate first followed by some huge wheat in the middle, which contributes a very faint tartness. Rich flavors of caramel and clove linger throughout. The clove just seems to echo on the finish.  M- Creamy and wonderfully textured with wheat. The carbonation is aggressive but soft. The firm body is almost a bit chewy in the mouth.

S - Banana and clove are dominant. Whiffs of clove and spice are present as well. Intoxicating.  T - Ripe banana, almost too ripe but not quite. Dark fruits and malts. Sweet and spiced with clove with a slight bitterness on the end that brings it back into balance. Yeasty. Warming alcohol. Absolutely delicious.  M - Medium bodied and smooth, with just enough bubbles and carbonation that you'd expect from a wheat beer.  D - Nice. A bit alcoholic, but oh so delicious.  Notes: Not much else to be said. Truly a great beer, especially if you're a fan of wheat beers or dopplebocks. Luckily I love both.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Bisho,4.84,"This is the Doppelbock (not really a Weizebock to my tastebuds) that all others should be judged against. Quite simply, there is no other that comes close to Aventinus. A true gift from the gods. Schneider hit the jackpot with this one and it's hard for me to forsee it ever being beaten.  Yes it's that good! Try it, you won't be disappointed!  I could drink this along side Weinstephan VITUS and KORBINIAN for the rest of my days and die a happy man! The only 3 Weiz beers you ever need drink again!",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,obywan59,3.97,"500ml bottle pours somewhat thickly into my weizen glass, giving me a 2 1/2 finger, slowly receding, barely off-white head with nice lace retention.  Smell of banana nutmeg, and cloves. Whiff of chocolate and citrus.  Sweet roasted malt. More banana and spice. Citrus twang on first few swallows, but settled down to just a hint.  Smooth, but a bit too thick for the sweetness, for my taste (or is it too sweet for the thickness???) Almost cloying.  I would drink it again on occasion, but it's a little too syrupy for me.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,MtAiryMike,4.6,"500 ml bottle, served in a pint glass. Purchased in a case at Shangy's the Beer Authority in Emmaus, PA, Oct. 2009. Bottle code 09.205 1-1 0330 2822 (not sure that is meaningful).  A: pours a deep red-brown with a half-inch head, tan and creamy. The heads settles quickly.  S: has a sweetly distinct, fruity and slightly spicy aroma - definitely some banana. Very unique.  T: terrific flavor, full of rum hints and raisins.  M: smooth, well-carbonated, and solid in the mouth. Did I say smooth already?  D: excellent overall, especially drinkable for a dark beer. One of the best.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,dpodratsky3,4.35,"500 ml bottle poured into chalice Wrapped in paper that says brewed in 2003  A: Super fizzy head, very soda like, doesn't look as dark as cola, but a true brown color, almost like a tootsie roll, not much real head  S: Nice and complex without being too heavy, definite chocolate aroma, adds a good base sweetness to it, bananas make an appearance on top of that, mild spice notes, definitely has settled down from the age, not super spicy and bold, but very nice  T: Has that sweet background malt note again that is similar to smell but not distinctly chocolate here, almost like a dark sugary/molassesy fruit, way more acidity than smell, spices are much more evident, still not super strong though, banana also, clove is there, still retains fruitiness of a weizen, just darker  M: Very light, carbonation is fairly high, I like that it is not heavy  D: High, easy to drink just like a hefeweizen, but has the deliciousness of a darker beer, complex, but still easy  Notes: I have only had a couple of weizenbocks before and I wasn't overly impressed. I'm glad that I finally tried a beer that does this style justice. It is great to see such good flavor profiles. It has all those light characteristics that you expect from a wheat beer, but nice, dark, and complex. Highly recommended.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Groenebeor,4.85,"Poured from the euro-brown bottle into a weizen glass.  Appeared pretty typical for a dark wheat beer. In appearance it was a dark brown, not completely opaque with a cream colored head. The head dissipated quickly, but this may have been due to the beer's age.  Aventinus has a smell of banana and strong smells of wheat. There was a good amount of yeast at the bottom of the bottle. beautiful figs, sugar, clove, alcohol, and malt. Wonderful beer.  In the delicious taste department, this beer takes the cake. It's like cake in that it's sweet, bready, some rye, figs, plums, a little rum or chicory, banana, clove, coriander, and caramel. It's incredible. It's my favorite beer. I'd love to see an even bigger, americanized version.  The mouthfeel was perfect, and the drinkability was amazing. Super creamy, super thick, so moist and delicious. Most drinkable dark beer I've ever had.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Chico1985,4.45,"500 ml bottle. Pours a hazy dark brown, off-white head is massive at first, but turns into a small layer covering the beer, tiny brown flecks sit on top from the yeast, really cool looking. Smell is great, big bread scent with many fruits as well. Taste is great, definitely leans more towards hefeweizen. Various light + dark fruits, clove, banana bread, dark malts. The doppelbock smoothness works great here with all these tastes. Very drinkable. Wow, I think I found a favorite German style. I'd love to try more of them.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,jzeilinger,4.25,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my Adventinus glass, this wreaks with coolness factor to have the actual glass designed by Schneider for this beer. I haven't had this in awhile so it's nice to pull this glass out of the cabinet again.  Pours a translucent deep mahagoney brown in color, a small tan colored creamy head and the foam sticks to the sides of the glass.  Has smells of clove, carmel bananas, prunes, slight hints of tobacco and some alcohol, brown malts. Taste has some chocolate presence, rum, nuts, bready. Finished mildly sticky, sweet, and a very mild hop finish that's present, but barely detectable.  Feels creamy on the tongue, heavy body, syrupy. Very drinkable and is one of my more favorite German beers. I had the opportunity to have this fresh off the tap on two different occassions at the Schneider Brew Haus in Munich. Having it from the bottle is pretty good but fresh off the tap in Munich is an absolute amazing experience.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,brewerburgundy,4.22,"500ml, weizen glass, an undecipherable code on the back label.  Woody brown pour builds a bright red-brown body and a pillow of soft tan head of at least an inch and a half. This fades to a solid cap with no holes, leaving no lace. Glowing once the yeast goes in. Streaming carbonation. I thought this would lace beautifully but it seems to have failed, utterly in that department.  Sweet multigrain bread, wheat, lemon, cherry, banana esters.  Cherry, plum, wheat bread, rye, twang, banana, cracked wheat, caramel, dry crackers, and the verge of roasted malts. This is a gorgeous beer. German weizen yeastiness. An alcohol presence that is very rounded and not warming or harsh in the least. Not too sweet at all.  Still gorgeous as the light syrup, full body fills the mouth and the carbonation leaves the palate clean.  We'll see, but the 8.2% is packaged as perfectly as possible it seems. This 500ml of a delicious, meaty, full, German beer is about as satisfying as I've encountered.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,fjordhook,4.12,"Poured into a pint glass, it has a dark amberish color. Aromas of bananas and other fruits dominate the smell. Very smooth smelling beer, not a lot of bite to it. The taste matched the smell, very easy to drink. Wish it had more of a bite, but I liked it. I could see my fiance really liking this beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,squaremile,3.79,"Banana, clove, and yeast just about sums it up. Pours a dark hazy orange, the smell is banana clove and yeast and the taste follows suit. The most incredible part of the beer is the mouthfeel which is INCREDIBLY smooth. Those flavors wear me out, but a great example of the style.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,dgilks,4.2,"Very sweet aroma with some banana esters. A touch of breadiness and alcoholic spiciness comes through too. Reasonably complex even if it strikes me as too sweet.  A nice deep brown colour with garnet highlights. A bit of haze too. A big, light tan head dissipates to a half finger layer.  Man, that's tasty. Rich, bready with banana esters, raisins and dark fruits. I get hints of darker malts, some alcohol and a touch of spiciness. The barest hint of bitterness is present. Nice, complex and very good.  Rich, silky and creamy. Medium-full body with moderate carbonation. Very good.  A great beer with lots of complexity. It goes down very well for a beer at 8.2%.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,ktrillionaire,4.65,"I really love this beer; it iis amazingly complex, versatile, and packs a wallop.  A &#8211; Pours in a strange manner, clumpy, like kombucha, but instantly fizzes into a normal doppelbock. Deep mahogany brown, translucent, good creamy tan head.  S &#8211; Smells great, like dark fruits such as plums, prunes and raisins, as well as spicy cloves and other mulled aromas.  T &#8211; Hugely complex flavor: dark dried fruits like prunes, raisins, and papayas, spicy yeastiness, and a richly sweet dark malt to back it all up.  M &#8211; Disturbing, and yet very intriguing. It could be described like a glass of carbonated, curdled milk, except delicious instead of disgusting.  D &#8211; This is always a winner.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Beerandraiderfan,2.3,"Dark brown pour, not particularly thick. Smell, a wallop of alcohol, and a bunch of dark fruit.  Taste, geez, this is not my thing. Tastes like a high alcohol brown ale, with all kinds of fig, raisin, dates type of flavor, throw in some tobacco and rubbing alcohol too.  Can't appreciate the mouthfeel or drinkability of a beer that is so disagreeable. Strong, sure, but good? No. This tastes like a big hodgepodge of contradictory flavors.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,fartkowski,4.4,"Serving type: 500ml bottle, bought at the LCBO Poured a Dark brown with about a 2"" creamy looking foam head. For me it was very bold tasting, but went down nice. It has a pretty good kick to it. It left my mouth tingling, almost rum like. I do have to say, it is one of the best beers I've tasted so far. I would highly recommend getting some. I will be buying some every time I make a trip to the LCBO. I also got the Aventinus Eisbock. Can't wait to compare the two.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Pahn,4.44,"500ml bottle into Duvel tulip.  Appearance: Moderate pour yields a 1 inch off-white, frothy and fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. Color is a deep, semi-opaque amber, with some bubbles rising in the middle. No lacing at all.  Smell: Grape, clove, banana, and typical weissbier aroma. As it warms, notes of plum and bread come out. Very stimulating.  Taste: The first sip is dominated by a musty, fruity, clove-infused flavor that reminds me of some trappist beer. Notes of other spices, plum, grape, and raisin, with some soapiness in the finish. The taste is very bright; the carbonation is perfect for punching up the already spicy flavor. That dark fruity clove mustiness is beautiful and never lets up. A malty sweetness comes out as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel: Mildly creamy, neither full-bodied nor watery. As noted above, the carbonation works perfectly with the refreshing, spicy flavor.  Drinkability: Excellent. Refreshing with a complex and stimulating flavor, which is exactly what I want from this kind of beer.  Aventinus is a very impressive weizenbock. It tastes kind of like the love child of a really refreshing hefeweizen and a dark trappist quad.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,MrHassellYaHurd,4.64,"Poured from bottle to weizen glass a beautiful hazy brown, just a couple tints lighter than milk chocolate. The luxuriously tight and smooth foam billows past the top of the glass, eventually settling to a thin cap.  The beer's nose reminds me of a Belgian strong dark ale. Very fruity apples, a grainy smell, and some yeast. A little alcoholic sweetness as well.  The taste is the nose tenfold, the malty characteristic gives the brew a hefty body as well as a delicious sweetness. Banana breads as well as apples and cherries are what I can taste the most. I do not sense much of the citrus or clove tastes I associate with the other Weizens that I have drank within the past week.  As I said, the beer as significantly heavy body, though not quite syrupy to me. Because of that (not to mention the stout ABV), I see this as more of a sipping beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,WeezyBoPeep,4.11,"Poured into a big crystal mug.  A: Dark brown with a slight amber hue. Floaties in the bottom. One finger of head disappeared too quickly, leaving no lacing at all. Super sediment.  S: Bananas, cloves, flowers, wheat and miscellaneous pears/apples/melons.  T: A slightly watery body displays alcohol on the front, dark fruit and hints of toast and red wine or some sort of cider.  D: I could see having two or three max.  Value: Good deal for a fine German brew.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,flagmantho,4.3,"Poured from 500mL bottle into a tulip.  Appearance: rich, hazy, cidery brown with a large, foamy tan head. It reminds me a lot of a quadrupel. Very appealing.  Smell: rich aroma of pears, plums and chalk. Well-balanced and delicious smelling.  Taste: surprisingly light in initial taste; it seems like the bulk of the flavor appears in aftertaste. Quite interesting. Flavors are of apple, pear and plum, with what seems like a hint of citrus.  Mouthfeel: medium body with huge bottle-conditioned carbonation which creates a delicious and intense creaminess. Just great.  Drinkability: quite drinkable, especially for its ABV. I would not hesitate to drink plenty of this again.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,runningjoke,4.3,"Poured into a pilsner gass. Nice foamy head that slowly fell to a thin cap. Jasper brown, and cloudy, letting only a little light through. Smells of spiced pears, apples, and bananas. Clove and allspice, sourdough notes. Taste and aroma are much of the same, but wheatbread presents itself more prominently. The beer hits all parts of the tongue at once, and the flavors meld nicely. It moves through the mouth quickly and smoothly. I can and have drink many of these one after another. I really like drinking this beer. I have ordered and purchased this beer many times but have never given much thought to why this is. It all comes together well.",Schneider Weisse G.

Very murky almost orangish brown...  Nice aromas of spices and banana and yeast... Smells like a spicy banana bread loaded with cinnamon or something Christmasy...  Taste pretty much follows suit with the aroma.. Nice and spicy and loaded with flavor... Quite the sipper, this would be a good dessert beer...the wheatiness is more evident in the taste than the aroma...  Overall, I like this beer... Is it something I would drink everyday? No but there is a time and place for it.. I enjoyed it...",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,jeffthecheff,3.99,"Pours a murky brown color that seems to have a slight purple tint to it. The color isn't great but the head is impressive. It's off white and very foamy. After a while it leaves a good cap at the top of my celebrator glass.  The aroma has the typical weizen characters of bananas and spice, but with more kick to it. I'm picking up some vanilla and cinnamon. There is a big, bready, bakery smell in the background, either from the dark malts or just the large amount of malt in this beer. It actually smells a lot like raisin bread.  This beer is a wheat beer first and a malty dopplebock second. It is fruity, spicy, and has a highly carbonated, smooth mouthfeel, all typical of a good wheat beer. The big maltiness of this beer adds another new dimension of rum raisin bread, and a huge caramel sweetness. It's like a really good dark bread.  The body of this beer is big, creamy, and very smooth up front with a big lingering sweetness in the back. The high carbonation blunts the impact on the finish, but the caramel/plum sweetness lingers big time. The beer carries a decent buzz and is rich because of the lingering sweetness. I'll get this beer again when the situation is right.  Aging notes from this beer: Don't age it. I had a 2003 and it tasted awful. Oxidation notes don't work in this beer and at that point it was terribly oxidized. The fresh wheat and yeast notes make this beer work.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

S - Spicy cloves and plumbs  T - you taste the dark malts at first followed by a barrage of sweet fruits (plumb, banana, and cherry) that do not overpower the mouth.

The foam settled after a minute of so and clung to the sides of the glass. not much lacing on the glass.  Aroma is strong with wheat, banana, cloves with a slight alcohol spiciness. Taste starts out similar with wheat, banana, and clove but the dark malt adds a very interesting and delicious chocolate flavor.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

72,224,mullenite,3.73,"This review is for a bottle that is a bit more than one year old now.  Pours a very deep red in color, very hazy with some floaties in it... (I'm thinking some protein coagulated as the beer got older as it wasn't part of the dregs.) Tall off white head that settled in to a thin cap across the top.  Smell is sweet chocolate, alcohol and dark fruits. Very sweet smell overall and quite a bit stronger than fresh Aventinus. It's almost too much of a good thing, like a chocolate covered cherry almost.  Taste is sweet, bready with that same dark fruit character. I've had this beer many times and don't ever recall it being quite this sweet. It's good, but I much prefer it fresh. Too sweet and unbalanced.  Nice thick body with plenty of carbonation but if there is one thing the age did to this beer is hurt it's drinkability.

Delightful and I swear it changes every sniff its so complex. Sometimes its bright, sometimes its spicy or estery  Taste: Complex and balanced. Chocolate is prevalent at first, then apple cider and more typical hefeweisen flavors. Delightfully caramelly and wheaty. Finish is sweet and yeasty and starts to get a hint of vanilla as the beer warms. A little bit of alcohol, but it just adds to the complexity and is a plus. Mouthfeel and carbonation are both mild and suit perfectly.  Notes: One of the best examples of the common heard phrase that you can buy a world-class beer for a very reasonable price. Everyone should try this.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,crossovert,4.63,"Ahhh Aventinus, oe of my favorites, here's a proper review. 500ml bottle, with the old label (purple one, apparently it's white now).  Pours with a nice active head, thank you bottle conditioning, the head is slightly darker than off-white and recedes pretty quickly leaving splotches of lace. The beer is one of my favorite looking ones of all time, especially with the tall creamy head. It is a vibrant amber/brown/rad, darker than your typical Weizenbock, of course its a Doppelweizenbock or Weizenstarkbier, but apparently it's not distinct enough to BA to make it a style.  The smell is an intensified version of the normal weizen bock, thick dark fruits and banana are the main parts with the great yeast twang and alcoholic kiss following. There is also hints of apple skin, clove, and brown sugar.  THis is one bold tasting monster, the flavors smack you in the face, with heavy yeast in the flavor, banana, dark fruits, some spiciness, a faint kiss of hop, and the alcohol. The carbonation is a great tool to permeate your tongue with amazing flavor.  This beer kicks major, major ass.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,eat,4.55,"The last few beers I've tried have produced some unimpressive head, so I mistakenly poured way too hard on this one and ended up with more than half a glass of foam. Translucent orange-brown with amber highlights where light shines through. Solid covering of a thick, off-white head. Good retention, no lacing.  Yeast, cloves, nutmeg, coriander, banana, citrus, brown sugar, bread and some astringency. Beautiful smell.  This beer is packed with flavour. It's so well-balanced that it's difficult to pick anything out specifically, all the flavours come together to form a whole. Dark maltiness, nutmeg, cinnamon, astringent and sweet, hints of banana and chocolate, fairly present but balanced alcohol. Short finish with almost no bitterness.  Awesome feel. Creamy medium body with perfect carbonation. There aren't many beers with a feel as good as this.  Since I first tried Aventinus a couple months ago, it's been one of my favorite beers. I prefer drinking strong beers and at 8.2% this one is perfect. It's surprisingly refreshing at such a high ABV.

Cinnamon and cloves come off the nose with sweet rum and roasted malt smells. A touch of alcohol in the smell, but in general a rather Doppelbock style smell. Really yummy smell.  Rich full bodied beer. A touch of caramel and spiced rum against a toasted wheat flavor. Cloves, cinnamon, and Chinese 5 spice. A very yummy beer to enjoy.

72,224,Cs1987,4.67,"Appearance - Dark reddish brown, almost opaque. 2 fingers of head with decent retention.  Smell - Sweet with banana and chocolatey malt. Quite addictive.  Taste - Not quite up with the Weizen Eisbock in terms of strength, but still very enjoyable and complex, with banana, spices and a great dark malt backbone.  Mouthfeel - A classic medium bodied wheat beer texture. Quite lively.  Drinkability - It is too easy to forget this is 8.2 % ABV.  Overall - Simply outstanding.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,sweemzander,3.81,"5oomL bottle poured into an imperial pint. No bottled date found.  (A)- Pours a clear dark brown amber that produced a good off-white head that dissipated quickly.  (S)- A bizarre minerality & smokiness to the beer. Bits of malty richness. A little vanilla in there.  (T)- Malty & rich. Bits of lemon & wheat with roasted bread and caramel-like sweetness.  (M)- Great carbonation level & balance. Very smooth going down. Sweet & rich but is balanced with nice lemon citrus plus a nice wheat-like neutrality.  (D)- A good brew with a confusing smell. It might be a tad old perhaps? Very malty & filling though. One of these really sticks to you. I dont know how fresh or old this one actually is, but I would definitely have it again.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,MasterSki,2.87,"This is the 2002 brewery-aged version. Apparently Jimmy Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize, the Bucs won the Super Bowl, and the Euro was adopted in this fine year. Served in a weizen glass.  A - Two fingers of quick-dissolving foam, over top of an attractive transparent orange-brown liquid with lots of bubbles and suspended sediment. No lace, cap, collar, nada - looks like sparkling juice or something.  S - Very vinous, but also some date, caramel, and figgy malt character. There's a touch of booziness - kind of in a rum-soaked banana way - and maybe some spice as well. It's a little reminiscent of some Kuhnhenn beers (Winter Wonder, Fourth Dementia), but not as good.  T - Yikes! Taste is incredibly bland - there's a little bit of oxidized wet cardboard character, and only the faintest bit of sweet dark fruit malt. If I had aged this on my own and it had gone downhill like this I wouldn't bother reviewing it, but because Schneider actually packages these vintages and markets them as such I have no choice but to be hard on this brew.  M - Medium body, low carbonation, kind of watery. Not offensive, but not particularly interesting either.  D - If I wanted to get drunk I could finish this, as it's actually quite bland. However, since I actually want beer that tastes good, or at least tastes like SOMETHING, my drain will be savoring this brew instead.  I will review a fresh bottle at some point in the future, but for the time being people need to be warned that the ""vintage"" Aventinus is pretty bad.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,Ineedabeerhere,4.42,"Had this on 10/23 at a tasting, from notes. Alongside a 2003 vintage, which sucked.  Pours a ruddy brownish-ruby color with a light brown/tan head fading to a film quickly but is easily revived by a few swirls of the tulip. Nice lacing.  Smells of yeasty spiciness, bananas. Wheat twang, raisins and dates. Rich malts and molasses. A hint of maple maybe? Sourdough bread.  Very nicely balanced brew, lively yeast character. It has a candied sweetness to it, which is well tempered by the yeast spiciness.  Carbonation is felt on your tongue, not over-carbonated but noticeable. Drinkability is outstanding, I would love to pair this bottle with a hearty dinner.  The 2003 alongside the fresh bottle was atrocious. Too oxidized, sherry notes but not enjoyable. Overly candied honey sweetness. Don't age this beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,KickbacksSteve,4.92,"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into an Aventinus glass. White froth rises up and spits forth a beautiful aroma from the tiny, tiny bubbles comprising the head. Aroma is of banana/plantain?, dates, raisins, spices? and other sweet nectars. Amazing. Beautiful. Taste is of dark fruits, wheat, sweet malts and some peppery spice, I believe. Amazing that somehow 8.2% ABV is packed into this beer. Aventinus is just amazing in every way. Only one word can summarize this beer, delicious.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,dasenebler,4.39,"Poured into a snifter: hazy medium brown, grayish, almost purple hue. Minimal off-white head. Small amount of lacing.  Aroma is outstanding. Bright, fruity flavors come through backed by hints of clove and ripe bananas. Can only imagine how good an aged bottle of this stuff would smell.  Flavor is very nice, but not as impressive as the aroma in my opinion. Initially sweet, with a spicy and tangy finish. Residual flavor of yeasty funk. Wheaty, bready flavors emerge as well. Mouthfeel is creamy, yet surprisingly medium-light for a stronger, darker beer. Perfect amount of soft carbonation. Eminently drinkable even at 8+ percent.  Aventinus is one of those truly worldly beers. There's nothing quite like it. I've had it several times, including on-tap, and it's consistent and solid in every way.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Pecorasc,4.49,"Poured about two-thirds of the 500 ml bottle into a Sam Adams glass. The yeast stayed in the bottle for this review.  Cream colored, irregularly shaped head with large bubbles on the bottom and thin foamy bubbles on top. Thick at first and slowly shrinking to a 1/4 inch. The beer itself is a hazy brown-purple, much more interesting in the thinner sections of the glass. Fairly strong carbonation, although difficult to see due to the haziness of the beer.  The aroma is where this beer begins to really score well. Prune, wheat, black pepper and cloves dominate the nose. Very little alcohol.  Taste: Carmel complements the cloves that were so dominate in the aroma. This beer's relation to Schneider Weisse is pretty evident. The alcohol comes through more and increases steadily as the beer becomes warmer.  Combines the smoothness of a bock and the high carbonation of a weizen. An incredibly drinkable beer for 8.2%. Several liters would not be very difficult.  Overall a great beer. Just wish I was drinking it in Germany.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,bamadog,4.64,"Can't really believe I didn't try this one sooner as it's very tasty. Pour is from the bottle to a pint glass.  Appearance: Looks like a cloudy and murky dark glass of iced tea; lots of sediment; 2 1/2 finger light tan head that is thick and full and has solid retention and eventually fades to a thick and full skim; strong carbonation bubbles up near the sides; no lacing to speak of.  Smell: Tons of spicey and fruity notes (cloves and banana especially); a bit of a tart apple or pear note is in there as well; very faint hints of wheat in the back.  Taste: Simply put, absolutely delicious. Strong sweet banana combines with spicey cloves; the citric apple or pear flavors are in the back but provide a nice balance to the sweet and smooth banana; a sweet vanilla maltiness lingers in teh back as well; warm vapors of alcohol sneak into the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Body is full and creamy; carbonation is soft but very present; mouth is left a little sticky and just a tad dry; belly is left quite warm and fulfilled.  Drinkability: Pretty high, actually. Amazing smells and flavors, perfect for a cool evening or desert; price was even reasonable at $4.20 a bottle; ABV is a bit high so it may prevent me from drinking more than one bottle, but it's too good to not drink. Easily understandable why this is a top 100 beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,ritzkiss,4.25,"500ml bottle from the LCBO, pours a murky dark russet brown, a finger of fizzy head rises to the top but quickly dissipates into spots of head.  Nose is banana, rum drenched raisins, cloves, earth, and a bit of booze in the back.  Bubblegum and banana strike first but are backed with a nice complexity of flavors. Raisins, earth, cocoa, toffee, rum, slight metallic note, cloves, biscuits, light sweetness throughout to balance the drying bitterness that is noticeable in the finish. Balanced and drinkable, just the lightest hint of the booze in the finish. I would probably tone down the banana/bubblegum but that's just a personal preference. Bubbly carb that gives a bit of an edge but never crosses the line of overdone.  Terrific bock that I would gladly pour again on a cold winter night as it warms the soul (and the body!). Complex and delicious, a good combo.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

A: milk-chocolate brown and cloudy, with a slightly-off white head that fades to minimal, but laces continues. not much left on the glass though, so not as sticky as I like to see.  S: dark fruits come through very strongly, plum and pomegranite, with some wheat very present and some almost-burnt caramel. smell a little bit of heat, but not really a bad alocohol bite .. more of an appetizing heat melding with fruity orange-strawberry. lots of dark caramel on the exhale. loving it.  T: what i'm looking for in a weizenbock and what I compare others to - strong dark fruit again and wheat, sweet but well balanced and with what seems like a quick end - but the after-after taste lingers with sweetness and light fruit. some earthiness. some orange, apple, apple skin notes present  M: medium-thick, not quite as much as I would like, but very smooth, wheat evident.

It's a nice brown, hazy color with strong carbonation rising up, supporting a dense, fluffy head. Definitely smell some booze in there. The flavor is pretty representative of the smell: Loads of the classic phenolics, like banana, clove, vanilla and such. The malts are sweet, but somewhat subdued. The color made me expect more maltiness. Nice deep fruit flavors from the yeast as well. Mouth feel is full and creamy at first, then the carbonation bites through it nicely.

I have enjoyed this dozens of times and the magic never seems to fade.  (Did you know that bock beers are actually a style of lager?)  Stunning color, rich, deep and lovely dark brown-red-black with a great 2 finger head.  Smells of all the nutty, cocoa-ey, molasses-ey, and espresso-ey goodness of all that is doppelbock.  Tastes of the heavens. This is heavy without being weighty, rich without being overpowering, and supremely balanced.  The texture is the best I have had from bottle and pretty much draft (with the exception of the great nitro-tap stouts).  So drinkable it is with the great balance and smooth finish.  Honestly, superb!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Loads of bubblegum and banana, classic wheat flavour up front. Rummy booze provides a good spine. Understated spice, cloves on the periphery, not as forward as I would have expected. All the while some nice malt flavours, leaning to the dark fruit side.  Lively carbonation, chewy malt body.

S: Amazing, strong banana, bubble gum smell. Classic wheat smell that leaps out at you assertively.  T: Strong smell translates to a similar strong taste. Not a subtle wheat taste, but bold banana and bubble gum flavors. Sweet taste really sinks in at the end as the liquid leaves the mouth.  M: Mouthfeel is thick and sticky which helps keep the taste on the tongue. Some slight carbonation.  D: I'm not much of a wheat beer fan, but I love this beer. Classic wheat flavors with a nice assertion. Heavy, high powered beer without drowning in sweetness. Could quaff one of these just about any time of the year.  Served: in a Weizen glass.

Some carbonation can be found towards the bottom end of the glass. No lacing at all. Smell is very fruity in esters - all banana. There's some bready and wheat characteristics and clove oriented in spice alongside the banana quality.  Taste is initially full of a nice wheat breadiness. The banana flavor is incredibly potent here which eases into the nice hints of clove spiciness - all typical of a weizen. There's some caramel amongst all the breadiness and fruit also. Makes for a nice flavor combination. Towards the end is a nice alcoholic kick and short bitterness.  Mouthfeel is nice and creamy with moderate carbonation. There's a substantial feel of the mini bubbles on the palate. Drinkability is dangerously drinkable. Absolutely delicious and smooth with no immediate taste of the 8.2% ABV.

The bartender was giving me samples from various tap handles as I wanted to try out new German beers I've never had. When he gave me this one, I knew it was a winner.  Although I'm going to have to try this beer again (and again) to give a more thorough review, my first impressions include a nice copper brown color, a wheaty yet tempting yeast smell, and very good overall drinkability. Complimented the german pretzel I had quite nicely. Both the smell & taste were quite complex, so I won't mind sampling some more of these!  12/8/09: Tried this one again in a 500ml botttle. Poured dark copper with great carbonation & thick head. Smells of banana, vanilla/chocolate, & clove stuck out. Tasted like banana and cloves as well as dark & wheat malts.

I suspended the yeast in the bottom and poured this into the chalice, and a beautiful hefe haze worked it's way throughout. The head was beige, loose and bubbly, and it faded away rapidly. The nose is big on banana, yeasty tones, and malts. Little to no hops on the nose. There is a touch of clove and alcohol. There is a real rum like quality to it. Taste leads with a clove-like quality, malt and wheat, rum, minor banana, yeast, little to no hop flavor, and minute bitterness. This bock is thick and creamy, filling and almost shake like. This is a very filling and comforting brew. This is a world class beer. The price is good.

Taste was pretty delicious, even though I am not a big fan of clove, estery tastes, this was a pleasant beer to have. It almost tasted of banana bread, with the banana, spices, and wheat and yeast combining to give it a bready feel. It has a nice body, a bit syrupy as it warms. Citrusy finish that stays in the mouth for a while. Overall I did enjoy this beer, perhaps the size of the bottle was too much, a 12 0z size might be more enjoyable. I would recommend this to any beer enthusiast, no matter what your style of preference.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Similar to a Hefe but with a touch of alcohol in the mix.  Taste is very similar to a dunkelweizen but with a higher abv. For 8% the alcohol isnt too strong but does leave a warming feeling down your throat. Pretty sweet with lots of banana and some spice.  Mouth feel is slightly denser than a typical wheat beer. Carbonation is lively but not too high. Wish the head was a bit more dense but oh well.  Drink ability was good. Went through the bomber rather easily. For such a high abv beer it will definitely sneak up on you. Wish more breweries would brew this style of beer,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Flavors include include these fruits along with spices - especially cloves - with the dark malt adding a chocolate component to the body. Mouthfeel is somewhere between medium and thick with the kind of minute bubble carbonation that results in a very smooth feel.

Carbonation steady and moderate.  Strong banana aroma (really strong). Malt and wheat character in the aroma as well. A very pleasing and inviting beer.  This is one of my favorite beers. The flavor is sweet, there is no hop bitterness. You can pick up a little bit of sweetness from alcohol on the front end, but its not warming. Malt character makes the beer full bodied, thick, and hits the midpalate nicely. Drinkability is high, but due to high alcohol and overall heaviness of the beer, a slight deduction.

One and half finger head that slowly dissipates to a thin cover of the surface.  Smell: Mmm..what you'd expect from a wheat beer. Bananas, malts and spicy hops are the first things that jump out. Has a bit of a sweet smell.  Taste: Malts upfront, with a typically wheat-y taste and then some spicy bitterness at the end. Not too bad.  Mouthfeel: Medium but feels a just a tad thin due to the high carbonation.  Drinkability: Honestly, this goes down pretty easily, and you wouldn't guess it was 8.2% ABV from the taste.

The beer pours a medium-brown color with a light brown colored head, that changed into a nice stable lacing.  Smell: very promising, strong sweet fruits (clear banana and some dark fruits), clear malted barley, yeast and some spicy hops. There is something else in it, sweet caramel maybe (or is it butterscotch as mentioned by PapaEugene...).  Taste: Roasted malts and wheats are immediately there, dark fruits (plum??), citrus fruits (orange zest), bit semi spicy hops (much less spicy than in the nose) and not as sweet as expected based on the smell. Fresh wheat taste as well, with some alcohol in the mostly bitter finish  Mouthfeel: High carbonation, I think this beer would be even better with a little bit less.... Medium-bodied.

A - copper brown. small head forms but quickly dissipates. no lacing. after 5 minutes all head is gone. yeasty floaters as you get towards the bottom of the bottle.  S - great. rum, figs, raisins, eugenol, sugary roasted malts, chocolate, wheat. occasional whiff of bbq sauce, even.  T - exactly what you'd think if you saw the words 'wheat-doppelbock'. an accurate mix of doppelbock dark, sugary fig flavors with the effervescent, bright wheat component. alcohol, though 'only' at 8.2% is surprisingly prevalent, esp in the aftertaste, accompanied by a bitterness, which is exactly the same as Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock. just like a fine aged rum. I can feel the alcohol and sugars on my teeth, almost like pepsi, or coke.  M - a bit thinner than I'd expect.  D - not bad, better with something to eat. alone this beer is too much to have more than one (I'm having enough trouble finishing the pint). it's hard to be a big, complex beer while remaining drinkable. this is the top beer of this style as I write.",Schneider Weisse G.

A - Poured from bottle into glass pours a dark brown with a thick 1 and 1/2 inch head that quickly disappears.  S - Clove, banana, and some raison.  T - reminds me of a Belgian ale with the candy sugars that which has that banana like taste along with raisan with additonal rum flavor.  M - Leaves a nice feel of the clover and banana feel once consumed.  D - Nice smooth easy drink would definately have more as this is really nice.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,TLove,4.02,"(From Notes)  This is an excellent Doppelbock. Certainly one of the better ones I've ever had. It is smooth and balanced.  Beautiful maroon color with a creamy, 1 finger head. Strong clove and raisin smell with a strong alcohol body and fruity nose. A substantive yeastiness with dark fruits on the back end that carry though. Plum, raisin and grapefruit that balance the grain and yeast structure.  A slight hoppiness and a rich, caramel malt structure really come out in the mouth. Finishes well, with a thin carbonation, great balance and a great creaminess.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,drtth,4.7,"Served in a 0.5 L weizen glass. A glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. This beer was bottled in 2003 and so has about 6 years of bottle age. Normally I'd have sampled a fresher one first, but this one was too tempting to pass up.  Appearance: As poured the beer is a medium golden brownish color, slightly hazy with a few small floaties in the bottom of the glass. The 1"" light tan head is fed by steady persistent carbonation. Initially, sipping leaves rings and legs of foam but by about half way through there is a minimal ring of foam and sipping leaves no lacing at all. By the end of the beer there was no carbonation left but that didn't surprise since it took about 45 minutes to drink this one.  Smell: The aroma is soft and gentle but also complex, lightly sweet and yeasty. There is some light presence of brown sugar here, some clove and ripe dark fruit, mostly plum. There also seems to be hints of chocolate and vanilla.  Taste: The flavor here is very mellow and complex with some sweet dark brown sugar flavor, some dark fruits, mostly raisin and plum with no real trace of hops or alcohol. Not surprisingly as the beer warms the flavor opens up more, hints of some faint banana and chocolate and vanilla appear late in the beer  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium-bodied with a soft, silky feel, persistent fine prickly carbonation that eventually becomes just the faintest feeling on tongue and in the mouth. Finish is long and eventually goes dry but has a slight yeasty character as well, both of which prevent the beer from cloying  Drinkability: At this ABV this is definitely a sipping beer that goes down quite easily. The rich complex flavor also dictates that this is a one a night beer for slow sipping. While, at the moment I suspect that 6 years of bottle age may have just put this one a bit past its peak, I'll know better after I try the 2005 and a newer one.  30 September 09, Comments on the 2005 Aventinus  The 03 definitely has a more subtle and complex flavor and aroma. The 05 has a banana, clove aroma and character that has receded a bit more by the 03, making for a more integrated flavor profile with the chocolate and vanilla coming out earlier. If rating this one first I think the overall score would have been slightly lower than it was for the 03.  14 Oct 09, Further comments on the 2003 Aventinus  I've now had at least 3 of these and wonder how I could have thought this one might be past its peak. Each of them has seemed more complex with more well integrated flavors than the one before it. The fresh is good, the 2005 is nice, but the 2003 is truely wonderful.  7 Mar 12, Revisiting the 2003 Aventinus  This tastes both as subtle and as complex as I remembered it to be. The additional months in the cooler have been kind to the beer and the flavors are still holding well.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,FernMaster,4.61,"I once went to a bar, Flying saucer to be precise. Where all the skirts are Short, which is nice. I desired a Matilda, never had it on tap And I was told that Matilda was all out. I sighed and said crap, And disappointed I began to pout. What beer would I drink? What's new under bocks I thought? I looked at the list and began to think, And this new name caught My eye. Its name was Aventinus. So I said to the pretty waitress Bring me an Aventinus and you should have seen us My friends I and I with our noses press To the pint glass Catching a whiff of the wheat And I, not shamed to admit, a peek at her ass. What can I say? It's a nice treat. We smelled the beer for three minutes, Before I allowed a taste, Which gave our minds all time to computes The craziness of a wheat dopplebock. Then in haste I took a sip of this dopplebock, With the wheat and I simply declared fock As I took a stand And declared this was rivaled by noother. The look and head Which may appear like manyother Are not all that's here. The slight smell of bread, And the wheat, oh! the wheat, Why in a dopplebock, why not? I wish my nose could take a weekend retreat With this beer on a yacht. Remembering Aventinus gives me a chubby, Maybe it was the girl and her rear?

S- Clovey, spicy, licorice, bubblegum, and a hint of banana. Subtle but complex.  T- Root beer cola, yeasty. Opposite the nose, it's a bit sweeter and less spicy. Sweet malt as it warms, hides the alcohol well.  M&D- Medium-full bodied, slightly filmy and almost syrupy. Tasty and drinkable, the alcohol could sneak up on you if you aren't careful.

72,224,MaxBrews,4.26,"Presentation: 500ml bottle poured into a modified pilsner glass.  Appearance: Depending a large 3-4 finger fizzy head that dissipates quickly into ring around the glass. Appearance is a dark reddish brown that resembles mahogany.  Smell: lots of fruity phenols of banana, bubblegum, cloves and oranges. Yeast smell is a cross between a belgium and general hefeweizen. It smells almost identical to a heffeweizen only with an added rusticness from the malt. Dark malt smells like bread with a combination of wood, dark chocolate and molasses.  Taste: Drinks pretty much like a hefeweizen (see smell) but with a darker chocolate malt. Other then the general heffe stuff theres dark chocolate, a bit of caramel and molasses mixed with a alcoholic bite; this provides very bourbon-esque flavor. This beer starts on fruity phenols, hits you in the middle with its chocolate malt and alcohol and leaves with fruity phenols. After taste is very wooden with dark chocolate as well as having a lot of clove spice from the yeast.  Mouthfeel: A high level of carbonation however for the type of beer the body is some what light. There is a big alcoholic warmth in this beer.  Drinkability: A very interesting beer. Extremely complex. All the fruity and spicy characteristics you would want out of a classic heffe but with the firm alcoholic robustness of a dopplebock, without tasting extremely angular and lager-like. A heavy beer though with a high ABV.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

T: this is a heavenly beer. very complex, highly fruity and savoury. plum, bannana, pear and red apple. a wonderfull yeast strain in here. this is a living beer.  M: medium bodied with ample carbonation. not sticky despite the sweetness.  D: for a beer of this heft, id say this is a good one to have around.

72,224,Beergeeknut,4.63,Appearance: Poured from a 500ml bottle into a Weizen glass is a stunning and dark and deep mahogany with deep amber brown hues. The head is about three fingers thick that thins out quick but it looks like frothed milk on top of a cappucino.  Aroma: Off the bat it has a brown bread aroma with hints of molasses. Notes of black currants and sweetness from the malted barley that was treated with lots of love. The hops float around way in the back and bathe themselves.  Taste: A silky smooth mouthfeel that coates the pallate so gracefully. Subtle hints of carob and big notes of black currants. This one has quite a malty backbone. The notes of mollases are like notes ringing out from an orchestra.  Notes: Wow this is a remarkable Weizenbock. It is absolutely stunning. Prost.,Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,woosterbill,4.1,"500ml bottle into a Duvel tulip.  A: Hazy deep amber body topped with a huge, billowing tan head - over three inches on the initial pour. This settles out eventually, leaving smooth lumps of denser foam scattered around the glass; surprisingly little lacing, however.  S: I have a feeling I'm going to like this beer. Straightforward aroma of sweet, fruity wheat, with some yeast spiciness in there as well. It's a fabulous aroma, but maybe not quite as complex and multi-layered as I was hoping for.  T: Not nearly as spicy as the nose indicated, here is where the beer's depth really asserts itself. Initial flavors are of deep, dark fruits (raisins and plums), followed by a bit of prickly wheat freshness, and finished with a blast of alcohol and candi sugar sweetness - the aftertaste reminds me more of St. Bernardus ABT 12 than any other beer I can think of. Sweet and delicious.  M: Exactly what I look for in a beer: full-bodied and creamy with abundant soft carbonation.  D: This is the only downside of this beer: it's so sweet, and does so little to mask its substantial ABV, that I can't really imagine having another one - at least not right away. Not bad for what it is, though.  Notes: This one definitely deserves its spot in the top 100, and its abundant availability makes things even better. I'll definitely be picking this one up in the future - I'm sure it will make a great winter beer.  Cheers!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,wesbrownyeah,4.5,"Aventinus Weizenbock nice 8.2% abv.  A- Very stern pour produces a hazy dark brown fluid with fluffy quickly falling head. Head falls to a ring with small amounts of middle froth. Little to none lacing but for a wheat doppelbock expected. Beautiful hue in the sunlight.  S- Rigid smells of raisins, dark fruit, alcohol esters, and fresh yeasty zest dominate the nose. Excellent scents of a Doppelbock wheat.  T-M- Smooth yeasty start with light flavors of prunes, raisins, and figs. Secondly followed by rich alcohol esters and wheat bite. Very light on the tongue with little to deter you from drinking alot of this heavily strong beer. Thin layer of malty feel lays on the mouth after a gulp making this a excellent experience for the taste buds.

T - Sweet caramel malt, bananas foster, raisin, and mild alcohol. Some spiced notes to it: nutmeg and clove.  M - Smooth yet lively on the palate. Medium body.

Yeast is there, dark fruits although I can't really define since the banana and butterscotch smell are masking it with there strong presence.  T: Roasted malts, hints of lemon and orange, banana and rather surprising little sweetness. Yeasty, little hops, a bit bitter and some alcohol.  M: High carbonation and a medium body.

Like a craft bread from the olden days. Thought the ball and chain was a-bakin'.  T Outstanding from beginning to end. Malty goodness predominates.  M Substantial and weighty.  D I hope to partake of this beer throughout my time of treading the earth. I must say though, that the Draught House in Austin, TX makes a superior version.

72,224,mdwalsh,2.98,"A: Pours a great, huge head that starts to disipate pretty quickly in my 22 oz. Wiezen Glass. It is a solid brown, and when held up to light shows amber, copper and orange. The head is just of white and looks rather creamy on top with bubbles of varying size underneath. There is decent active carbonation, but not too much.  S: Smells super wheaty, and it's confusing my brain being so brown and smelling like that. I also get a malty sweetness and a sort of funk I usually associate with Belgians. There is also a candi sweetness, perhaps that's what it is, and it's just confusing me. The more I smell it, the more I get just the candi sugar.  T: I really wanted to like this beer, I really did. I just can't seem to get into it though. Perhaps it's a bad bottle? The taste is mildly malty sweet, but tastes more like candi sugar to me than real malt. And the wheat is just a whisp at the end, more of an after taste. I get no hops whatsoever.  M: Ok, very plain. Thin but heavy, mild or little carbonation.  D: I could see where I certain set of people would like this. Must be a bad bottle?",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BierFan,4.17,"Poured from a 500ml bottle into a weizen glass.  Appearance: The head never amounted to anything but that's probably due to my bad poor. Beer is brown with good carbonation.  Smell: Lots of bananas, little bit of bubblegum. Pretty much what you would expect from a good dunelweizen, but with a little bit of alcohol.  Taste: Bananas, cloves, and dark fruits. Bit of a spicy aftertaste. If I had to make a beer analogy I would say it's like a theoretical blend between a German weissbier and a Belgian dubbel.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,morebeergood,4.23,"Ordered a bottle with dinner while at Craigie on Main in Cambridge. Presented by the bartender with an upside down pour into an Aventinus glass. When done right, this beer is quite a sight. The glass itself is quite a vessel to drink from. Huge white foamy head graced the top of the glass. Dark cloudy brown colored body. Has a spicy, dark fruit smell, almost like an aged rum. Very complex taste. Had all of the classic hefe flavors: banana, clove, bubble gum. Plus, the bock aspect of this beer really added a second layer of flavor - dark and malty. As one complete beer, it formed a champion of the style. Smooth on the palate, and very easy to drink despite its 8.20%. A wonderful beer by itself, or a perfect beer to pair with a nice meal.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

A dirty wheaty taste. Some mustiness, raisin and clove. Banana and some nuttiness. Banana nut breadish. Booze comes up through the nose at the finish.  Tingling on the tongue. Has a chewy texture. Pretty full bodied. Finishes really clean.  My first of this style and I like it. Not a big wheat fan, but I like the darkness and richness of this. Really easy and satisfying to drink. I would have this again.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,HitokiriNate85,4.75,"Poured from a half liter bottle dated 09.089  A - Poured a murky brown into my weizen glass. Two-finger, thick, frothy head. Lots of big bubbles in the head that create a semi-rocky head. Fair amount of carbonation that cascades nicely up the glass. The head diminishes into a thin but tight creamy cap.  S - Big whiff of clove and banana. A bit of alcohol. Every time I take the glass away for a few seconds and bring it back there's a big, bready malt note that really cements the nose.  T - When something is good enough, it's hard to describe it with words. The dark malt works incredibly well with the wheat. They meld to create an incredibly smooth flavor that doesn't have the tang of a regular weizen(which I love, but it works well without it here). Milk chocolate, a bit of cherry, and a definite, very recognizable brandy note. The finish ends with a nice, big wheat note. Just phenomenal.  MF - Honestly, it might be the single 'smoothest' tasting beer I've had. The feel is incredibly full. The carbonation provides some lively feel, but in staying modest really lends to the smooth, silky feel.  D - Fantastic. I could have more than one. I'd love to have more than one with a meal. This could pair really well with a variety of food, from entrees to dessert. And to wax philosophical for a moment, this is an example of why beer is great. This isn't a beer that's based on hype. It doesn't need hype. Food is timeless, and this is an example of why. And to note, my 4.5 is based on the fact that I've had more drinkable beers, including weizenbocks.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,gearkraft,4.97,"Purchased from Kroger, I usually only buy these for special occasions.  Appearance: Deep and rich browns, with considerable cloudiness. Resembles a heavy tea like color. Gorgeous lacing with fluffy head.  Smell: A complex plume of fruit, mainly raisins and perhaps apricots. Has that familiar wheat beer smell, a sweet tickling sensation that reminds me of lemons.  Taste: Dear God, this is one of the greatest beers ever made. A slightly sweet, and malted beginning smoothly peaks into a exceptionally strong raisin like flavor. A citrus like sparkle finishes.  Mouthfeel: First and foremost, there is little carbonation. It makes the finish strong and clean, with little effervescence. Drinks smooth... maybe too smooth?  Drinkability: This beer is easily poundable, but that would be a sin, wouldn't it? It goes down smooth, tastes balanced and good. The high abv can put some people under the table, so be careful. I actually prefer this in the bottle to on tap. Ive had many discussions with fellow beer tasters and we all agree as well. Something about a little time in the bottle makes this brew truly shine. My favorite beer. Bar none.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Sweet clean malt underneath with notes of caramel. Pretty damn good! Crystal and possibly chocolate malt combine with the lighter wheat to create a very interesting mix of flavours. Dark fruit is once again evident, along with more caramel and some alcohol, which lingers in a very pleasant finish, much like a belgian strong ale. Mouthfeel is a balancing act between the refreshing light body of a weizen the fullness of a rich, malty brew. I wouldn't have thought of it, but it's amazing how the light wheat combines with the smooth malt of a doppelbock.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Smells of dark fruit, banana, spice, with hints of vanilla and caramel. The aroma is a little bit boozy. Deep banana flavour. Rich dark fruits in the finish, like sour plums. Spice. Sweet but not overwhelmingly so, with a tangy finish. Solvent character comes forward in the nose as the beer warms, but remains muted in the taste. It's like I can sit here and come out, sip after sip, with something different each mouthful. A hint of raisin? Medium bodied and finely carbonated. Smooth, creamy, and a little bit syrupy.

Another reviewer notes a black cherry flavor and I have to agree. Chocolate notes are revealed slowly. Fresh bread and caramel. Very complex yet very easy to drink.  Mouth is hard to nail down.

72,224,auroracrisis,4.33,"Poured properly from the bottle into a 22oz Blue Moon weizen glass.  Has a one inch, off-white head until it dies down into a film on the top. The appearance of the beer is actually a ruby brown color with lots of bubbles. LOTS of 'em. Some sediment floating around in it too. A great looking beer.  Smells sweet and malty with a bit of yeast. Has some fruity aromas but not super bananay like some weis beers. More like bananas and plums, or bananas and cherries even.  The taste is pretty complex. It's most forward taste is the malts. It's pretty sweet for my palate, like rich dark candies. Then it fades into the creamy wheat taste which adds a fruity taste to it. The German yeasts are present as you swallow and nick the back of the throat on the way down. Exceptional is a good way to put it. This beer is often overlooked by myself but now I might have to start picking this one up more often.  Mouthfeel is good. A little on the light side with lots of bubbles. I like my beers a bit thicker than this but it is definitely true to the style. I think describing it as good is a fair way to put it.  Drinkability is relatively high due to the light body but the ABV kind of takes away from it. I could drink a couple more of these but then I could be intoxicated (which isn't a bad thing but would result in me not wanting too much more of this one.)  Overall, I'd say this beer deserves it's reputation. It's great!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

An easy three fingers of head, though that probably had a lot to do with my pour.  S - Mmmm, dark wheaty goodness. Lots of banana, yeast, and spice.  T - Sweet malt hits the tongue first, understated banana, german yeast, hints of spice, and a rich black cherry note on the aftertaste.  M/D - Could easily drink this continuously in summer or winter, the mouthfeel is rich, but not overbearing and it is dangerously drinkable for 8.2%!

72,224,HalfFull,4.37,"500 ml. bottle poured into a weizen glass. Pours the murky brown of the Bunratty River, and with an inch of off white head atop. Offers decent retention and keeps a surface cap until the finish.  Yeast on the nose, and complex for a weizen, with banana and some dark malt. A bit of cinnamon like spice and a lightly wafting alcohol sense. Opens up to enhance the yeast notes even further.  Taste is quite clean given the color and smell. A bit of caramel/red malt on the finish combine with notes of banana that are deep yet not sweet in a simple sense. A nice carbonation carries everything through well. A bit of chocolate cherry/dried fruit wraps it all up. Smooth on the feel given the carbonation and a tingle of sweetness that masks the ABV on the tongue. The beer seems to morph as it settles, offering an array of scents and flavors. Ever changing, yet always positive, this beer shares genes with many a style, including Weizens, Bocks and Belgian Darks.  Had on tap previously and found to be overly malty and nondescript. Notably superior from the bottle.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,flexabull,4.25,"This classic finally appeared in town, so it's time to review it.  Pours a deep dark amber / brown color with a very nice off white head.  Aromas are of apples, kind of cider like, with some creamy malts, some mixed spices, and bread dough.  Taste is surprisingly smooth and mellow, much more so than what I thought this would be like. There are lots of malt flavors, some creamy, slightly sweet malts, light chocolate, a general apple like flavor, and a light spice note. Finish is crisp, fairly dry, and with a light mineral note.  Mouthfeel is good, pretty full, and with nice carbonation.  Drinkability is excellent. This beer goes down really easy for an 8+% ABV beer. Very tasty, but also really smooth.

72,224,BeerCoffeeWater,3.97,"Pours a flocculent dark amber. Half inch bubbly head that stays around. Smells of cloves, hefeweizen yeast, and other spiciness. A nice tight carbonation dances on the tongue and leaves flavor but finishes clean. Tastes like the perfect marriage of a hefeweizen and a dopplebock, subtly sweet and very spicy.  I love dopplebocks, I don't really care for hefeweizens, yet it is all the the hefeweizen characteristics that make this one a winner for me. A fantastic beer, but I find drinkability to bit low. Wouldn't want more than one, it starts to get a little too hefeweizen-y for my tastes towards the end (it is a 500ml bottle). Great beer though, and one I will seek out again.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,twiggamortis420,4.72,"Pours a medium brown color with a very large light tan foam that fades loudly to a nice collar. Very pretty beer, might be the darkest weizenbock I have seen.  The smell is a heavenly blend of chocolate, banana, cloves and to a lesser extent bubblegum. Perfect smelling beer, I could sniff it all day.  Taste is just as fantastic with more emphasis on chocolate than most of the style. Alcohol is displayed at a noticeable, but not overpowering level and accentuates the damp wheat flavors. Yeasty esters are there aplenty as well, with the banana coming through a bit more than the cloves. Mouthfeel is lively and effervescent, falling somewhere around medium. Vitus comes close, but this is the king of weizenbocks for me. Super delicious beer, cant wait till the next one.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Notable aromas include banana, dark currants, vanilla bean, and a bit of wheat.  T- Big rush of clove and wheat initially. Definitely some standard wheat flavors as well as banana, fig, tobacco, vanilla, tart fruits, apples, and some mild tannins. Alcohol is pretty well masked but it is still noticeable.

Initial taste is a sweet, dry, coffee and banana bread blend. Spicy and quite complex. The sweetness seems to come on strong on the tip of the tongue then just before it dominates the taste buds it gets balanced out nicely with the spice and dryness of the brew. The mouthfeel hangs on well between sips and the finish is dry with just a bit of the malty chewiness that you would expect from a doppelbock. A nicely done brew and worth picking up.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

A fat three finger head jumps to the top of my duvel glass. It has big light tan swiss cheese like bubbles that fade slowly and leave no lace. Body is a deep brown tone that has tones of burgundy when held to light. Nose is a beautiful mix of abrupt wheat and yeast with a balance of sweet malt and rich dark fruits. This beer brings a lot to the plate with the flavor profile. The wheat feel is big and rustic while being crisp. Yeasty maltyness carries with it graham cracker sweetness and an array of dark bold fruits including some raisin and fig notes. Mouthfeel is very full and much like sweet bread, overall very nice.

A bit too much cloves for my tastes, personally. Your mileage my vary.  M: Like a heavy hefeweizen.  D: I keep going back and forth on this beer. Sometimes, it's one of my favorite beers of all time.

Has a thick off white head rise very quickly and fall to a good size ring that leaves a moderate amount of lacing.  Smell is of sweet malts, dark fruits, and some chocolaty and slight roasted aromas. There is also a note of spice that adds to the complexity.  Tastes if the dark fruit esters first with some phenolic clove flavors coming through. The spice flavor is complimentary and adds to the overall experience. The chocolate taste comes through as well, but is more evident when the beer warms.

72,224,MeisterBurger,4.28,"Pours a rich, deep, dark reddy brown topped by an ample moussey head.  The aroma is dried bread, clove, and dark fruit, mostly perfectly ripe banana.  The taste is mild red cherries, raisins, chocolate, prunes and creamy banana all intermingled in a wonderfully crisp melange of flavors. The alcohol is mildly warming, but it jibes well with everything else. There's a nice tartness in the finish that goes well with the clove spiciness that lingers in the aftertaste. There's a lot going on here, and it all works together in perfect harmony.  The mouthfeel is medium but with a creaminess that works wonderfully with the banana in the taste, and it is this combination, with the wonderful lingering clove, for me anyway, that really sets this beer apart and makes it such a top-notch drinker.  It's a joy to drink, a truly delicious beer, and at 8.2% ABV you could feel joyous all too quickly. This is definitely a beer to savour over the course of an hour.",Schneider Weisse G.

It's overwhelmingly fruity, along with a combination of spices that I can't quite pick out.  T - Not a very strong alcohol taste, which is not a bad thing. I do taste banana and clove mainly, along with the multitude of spices that are too complex for me to seperate. Very good tasting beer.  M - The beer is on the sweet side, and you can tell here.  D - Very easy to drink, not too heavy, but it can be deceiving. I could have a couple of these in one sitting, but nothing more than that. Overall, a very good Weizenbock.

S: Smells like banana, clove, caramel, malt, grains, dried fruits, raisins  T: Very similar to the smell - bananas, clove, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, fruity, raisins  M: Nicely carbonated, thin enough to make this easy to drink while still filling up the palate  D: The flavor is solid, there is very little alcohol flavor...the only thing is that i'm not crazy about the style, but this beer does a pretty good job of trying to alter my opinion",Schneider Weisse G.

It's color reminded me of slightly dirty copper with a very impressive cream white head.  S. The smell reminded me of a classic German beer. Banana, cloves, and an almost chocolatey aroma hits you pretty hard.  T. Considering my username it is pretty easy to guess this is probably my favorite beer of all time. It is very deep and intense. The alcohol is certainly there and it warms you while you taste the spices and banana. It almost has the quality of dried fruits like raisins and apricots.  M. As I said before, very warming. Leaves a nice but not overwhelming sweetness in your mouth.  D. The drinkability is good and that is dangerous for a beer like this. Luckily I doubt I could handle more than three in a sitting. Very filling beer.  Notes: I hope I did this beer justice.

S - The malts are clear on the aroma, but not overpowering. Mild spice, possible cinnamon.  T - Strong complex spiciness, could be clove, with cinnamon; definitely more to the spices but it's too complex for my taste buds. There are dark fruits in the background, figs standing out, and maybe raisins and cherries?  M - The carbonation is noticeable, which is something that I wasn't expecting in this. It tastes like it should sit heavy but it doesn't.  D - Decidedly complex beer, that offers up more spice than most. It is definitely unique in the flavours, in a positive way. This is not a beer that you can knock back one after another, it has to be savoured, and the entangled mosaic of flavours truly appreciated.",Schneider Weisse G.

T- Very tasty. Malty, sweet rasin bread. Chocolate and clove afternotes.  M- Pure awesomeness. Doesn't get better than this. Heavy carbonation that rolls all the flavors all over your tongue.

72,224,superdedooperboy,4.32,"Poured from a half-liter bottle into a weizen glass. The code 08.057 is printed on the back of the label. Served at cellar temperature, between 48 and 50 F.  Initially pours a nicely clear, gorgeous deep mahogany with a finger-and-a-half of rocky tan foam. After swirling the yeast in the bottle and pouring into the glass, clarity obviously diminishes somewhat. Head retention is rather poor, as the head fades away pretty quickly and leaves behind virtually naught in terms of lace on the glass.  The nose is wonderful, with nice fruity esters reminiscent of plums, prunes, raisins and just a bit of fig; while present and discernible, though, these notes are not powerful and only play a supporting role in the overall Spiel of spicy nutmeg and clove aromas and a rich, chocolate-caramel maltiness. As things warm, a spicy alcohol presence shows itself as well.  Full-bodied and moderately carbonated, with a thick, slick mouthfeel. A rich, sweet caramel malt base holds throughout and supports a spiciness with notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove dominating. Dark fruits come through again on the palate, but overall the rich maltiness takes the front seat, with some toasty melanoidins kissing the tongue and a boozy alcoholic character showing up as the beer warms a touch, helping somewhat in drying the otherwise long, malty-sweet finish.  Absolutely delicious and wonderfully delightful, a wonderful mélange of rich maltiness with spicy Weizen yeast characteristics and a bit of boozy alcohol, which is never overpowering on the palate but plays with the head, leaving that mellow swimmy nature that comes with it. The classic Weizenbock simply doesn't disappoint, and only gets better with freeze-distillation. I'd like to see how this one changes with age.",Schneider Weisse G.

Plums, dried fruits, and very red wine like.  Taste: Huge malt taste. Very little booze to show. Plums, grapes, prunes. A lot of dark dried fruits going on here. A lot like the aroma, but not as big.  Mouthfeel: Rich and creamy. Perfect amount of carbonation. Full bodied. Leaves a slight hazy/dark fruit aftertaste. A little dry, not to bad.

Mouthfeel is full of clove with even a hint of raisin and a bit of alcohol warmth. Otherwise, alcohol is well-hidden. Beer goes down very well.  This is marvelous.

72,224,biegaman,4.25,"Pry off the cap and we're off to the races (will I get the beer into the glass or will the foam beat me and end up on the floor?) Even at 3 years of age, this sample showed its Aventinus-like characteristic of over-anxiously climbing up the bottle neck the very second it was exposed to air. The head has become more subdued with age but still the beer remains tightly tucked under a white, feathery, finger high blanket of foam.  The beer is a lovely colour: lacquered cherry wood with earthy accenting tones of cedar and mahogany (certainly the Aventinus table set would look great in my dinning room). It is clear but deep and concealing. Nevertheless, transparency is awarded, one need only look beyond the effulgent glints that twinkle from the beer when held into the light.  The aroma is... quite interesting, to put it modestly. I remember a potent and powerful bouquet of yeast brimming with fresh potpourri like esters and phenols. Its fragrant clove and spicy pepper were too much for my nose when I first tried the beer. With age, however, those have faded and in their place arises a sickly sweet, seething scent of melted caramel and fermenting fruits.  I'm beginning to see a likeness to barleywines and old ales. There is an abundance of dark caramel, a definite brandy-ish influence and the unmistakable flavour of figs. Each sip I think of Turkey, North Africa, the Middle East - but not Germany; if ever there were a beer version of Boukha surely this is it. Speaking of spirits, I taste a few others too: Calvados, Poire Williams, Kirsch, and certainly Mirabelle.  Along with the apples, pear, cherry and plum I'm also noting cocoa (so you might as well add Creme de Cocoa). It's interesting that I'm listing the fruit liqueurs rather than the fruits themselves. Trying it fresh I remarked on the unmissable amount of alcohol. Now that's it has matured the booze is not detectable outright although it has obviously blended in with the flavours (hence fruit liqueurs not fruits). There's a lot of complexity, that's for sure.  Yes, I definitely remember this being warming (in an 'Indian Sunburn' sense) but it's obviously ripe for the drinking now. Despite both its strength in flavour and in alcohol content, this is being consumed with heaping, crammed mouthfuls. A pint does not seem overkill, it seems the bare minimum. The texture is sappy and sticky yet at one point I was literally distracted by the sound of crackling carbonation.  Aventinus has earned its reputation as a unique, world-class beer. Still, I was not swept away the first time I tried it, nor the second, nor the third. I had heard and read about people aging it; the claims that it evolves and matures into an even higher beer and so I thought I'd give it a shot. Three years later I could not be any happier I did. It really does become a different beer, stock the cellar and find out for yourself. Trust me!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,biboergosum,4.3,"500ml bottle, old-world staid presentation, and yet attractively approachable at the same rate.  This beer pours a dark, cloudy orange-brown colour, with two fingers of puffy, foamy pale beige head, which falls away a bit more quickly than expected, leaving very little in the way of persistent lace - and there are definitely some minor floaties swirling about, as things slowly settle out.  It smells of sweet, fruity wheat grain, banana esters, cloves, a bit of ripe dark fruit, and light caramel malt. The taste is of course quite malty - prune, raisins, overripe banana - with some thinned out caramel, an unusually hefty touch of wheatiness, and a very light herbal yeastiness, one which seems so integrated that it's like it's been baked in from the start. Nothing in the way of alcohol dares to poke its head out yet, it would seem.  The carbonation is moderate, and seemingly just not worth parsing - it is what it is - the body a solid medium weight, and a tad chewy in its smoothness. It finishes drier than expected, the malt petering out in the face of the lingering fruitiness and circling alcohol warming.  A lovely, evenly balanced, and yet still largely wheaty doppelbock. Simple and complex, all at the same time, which translates as just good, good stuff. The hefty ABV does well to keep its normally intrusive head down, which is another example of the old-school brewers knowing their way around the different aspects that make up their beer. Yeah, they get it.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,ClevoPiwo,4.6,"poured from a .5 liter bottle into a schneider & sohn hefeweizen glass.  this beer looks gorgeous! a very nice looking beer that pours a very rich brown color; perhaps the shade of cherry wood - like a dark oak or dark chestnut. the head is very nice, an off-white color vaguely taking on some of the color characteristics of the beer itself. upon pouring the head was large and billowing but was eventually dissipated by the carbonation but remained responsive to agitation.  the aroma is complex and pleasing to the nose, with an array of flavors including wheat, a hint of banana, clove, caramel and a slight suggestion of alcohol ester. i had this beer once before out of a snifter and thought that the banana was very prevalent but upon a second tasting and smelling in a hefe glass, the banana seems much more balanced with the wheat smell and a hint of spices and ripe fruit - maybe plum - than i had though the first time.  a fair amount of carbonation gives way to an array of flavors that coat the palate. there are hints of banana, other ripe fruit, clove and of course wheat along with some suggestion of a yeast flavor vaguely reminiscent of rum as the beer warmed up. the aftertaste is of wheat and a vague hint of banana. the flavors in this beer are very deep, but balanced enough to make sense and not seem like tastes are competing for the attention of your palate. in fact, they blend and compliment each other so well that one has a difficult time describing the separate elements that combine so well to please the palate.  the mouth feel is full and a bit syrupy. however, the beer is carbonated just enough to retain a very crisp and drinkable character that blends nicely with the full mouth feel to make it extremely satisfying after every sip. as the beer warmed up and the carbonation lessened, the alcohol became more prevalent, but only slightly - overall the change in temperature led to only subtle differences.  this is what every dunkelweiss or weizenbock beer should strive to be.",Schneider Weisse G.

Substantial lacing is pulled back down by the clear viscous legs.  Aroma is of wheat, brown bread, nuts, clove, caramelized bananas, malt, and yeast.  Dates, cherry pits, orange peel, and tart yeast on the palate, with a well balanced finish, which refuses to relinquish the impression of fresh brown bread. Delicious.  Velvety rich mouthfeel, though lighter-bodied than I expected; then again, this increases the drinkability. Alcohol is present, but not especially warming. Carbonation is substantial and thick.

The head pours well and sits for a while, though eventually it does dissipate to a thick film. Lacing is surprisingly minimal. Dark fruits and molasses notes are first on the notes, with some caramelized sugars and an underlying nipping spice note. Alcohol is present though not overbearing. Everything on the nose is in this brew's flavor and more. It's big and bold with a huge malt back and underlying complimentary notes of banana and cloves. There's a definite characteristic of spirits, as this possesses an underlying rum or bourbon-like flavor and is surprisingly heady. Hops are fairly minimal and all the character is from the malts. This one's as big and rich as any I've had. Big, bold mouthfeel is supremely thick with a full body. Carbonation adds a little tingle, though not much bite. Great if you like thick beers. If you think it's not thick, that's probably motor oil you're drinking. The alcohol is pretty expertly masked given the ABV, though it's certainly there and will kick your face in if you're not expecting it. Very drinkable otherwise.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,grayburn,4.65,"This was a brewery cave-aged bottle, brewed in 2003, released in late 2008, and purchased a couple weeks ago. I wish I would have picked up a regular Aventinus for a side by side comparison...but oh well, this was freaking delicious.  Pours a ruddy dark brown, some reddish edging, smallish head, still bigger than I was expecting at 6 years old...fades pretty quick and doesn't lace, but instead leaves some vinous legs all around.  The smell and taste are both dominated by a wonderfully blended mix of sweet bread, bannana, and some light clove...delicious.  The mouthfeel is thick and chewy, without being at all cloying...carbonation is there, but it's light enough to not really take a front-seat...it fits perfectly in the back...excellence.  I could drink this and drink this and drink this...amazing beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Not bitter, even though the percentage is 8.2. Very flavorful and smooth to drink. The beer is thick, similar to guinness, but has a completely different taste.

72,224,laituegonflable,4.19,"Pours a dark cherry colour with espresso tinge, produces a little bit of ochre head when poured, but quickly dissipates to nothing. Little adhesive bubbles clings to the bottom when tilted though, kind of puffs out from under the crown. Quite a lot of carbonation as well; lacing is minimal. Not fantastic but I've come to expect this sort of thing from anything calling itself a bock.  Nose is very estery, with a good deal of ""banilla"" (to borrow the bros' term), sour cherry, and a whisper of coconut. Good spicy phenols round it out with nothing too intense, but a slight hint of cloves and a peppery edge. Pleasant nose indeed, very sweet and complex, promises a lot for the flavour.  Taste is toasty and tart, with a strong toasted grain character like burnt sesame, a lot of sour fruit notes as well; raisin, cherries and figs, in fact a lot of cherry, with a long finish full of delicious spicy phenols, certainly a nutmeg edge to it and a little warming heat from the 8.2%. Slightly nutty edge, may just be nutmug, but methinks a touch of walnut towards the back.  Mouthfeel is a bit tart, puckers the mouth a bit and makes me feel like an English mild to cleanse it. This is a great beer no doubt, very tasty with a rich bouquet of enjoyable flavours, but I have to say, having reviewed this second to the weizen-eisbock, I prefer the bazooka-tipped ramrod flavours of the latter.  This is more drinkable I think, but it's mild in flavour, maybe even simple, for all the many flavours it encompasses. It just never reaches the high, it stays sweet and spicy without ever reaching down my throat and yelling ""OI! DICKHEAD! SWEET AND SPICY BEER HERE!""  I'm not disappointed though, of course. I've tried a delicious beer and puckering though it be, I could drink this all night.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The apple is there in the flavor as well. A hint of light chocolate. Spices with clove standing out. A decent does of booze in the finish with rum coming through in the aftertaste.

S - Bananas, cloves, rum, vanilla, raisins, figs, sweet bread, mulling spices, caramelized apples, and a whiff of ripe sweet melon. The sweet notes come forth most prominently, but the spicy notes help hold it all together. Full, rich, balanced, and enticing.  T - The bready wheat structure is perfectly upheld by the complex dynamic of fruit, spice, and chocolate. This brew has a long, bracing finish that is at once sweet and savory.  M - The mouthfeel is at once thick and substantial while also heady and refreshing.  D - Supremely enjoyable - perfect for any time of the year. Such a versatile brew to pair with food - it could go equally well with dessert, chocolate, less spicy Mexican food, roast duck breast, or even with pancakes and breakfast sausage.

A - big fluffy head, retaining well; has a nice bumpy surface like a cloud, in a light brown maybe tan colour. the body is a muddy brown with some hints of orange and red-- looks much more like a regular doppelbock. the head settles down to a fairly sized layer.  S - smell is fainter than expected: malts are the biggest scent along with some apple notes in the background; almost like apples and honey.  T - taste is almost hindered by the intense amount of small-scale carbonation, no large bubbles here: just a lot of small ones. initial taste is difficult to get: it is difficult to comprehend because I had already taken a swig and the after taste is not irreplaceable. with a fresh palate I note a lot of cloves, a lot! as the brew sit in my mouth the alcohol begins to come out, and burn. the finish is where the flavours blossom to maturity: carbonation is an impediment here and blocks out most of the flavours; the cloves do get more intense and some sweeter elements come out, mingling with the subtle alcohol. the aftertaste holds the flavour for which we've all been waiting. clove, orange peel, and some sweet banana all come into the playing field. delectable if you like clove flavoured beer, that is.  MF&D - aforesaid, the taste of the beer is great once you get to it. but the carbonation muddles everything up! the flavours are good and some times too sweet, but the carbonation has to click it down...way down so that I can taste the beer in all stages of drinking.",Schneider Weisse G.

The aroma was a bit fruity with caramel and a bit of a cinnamon/nutmeg. The taste was similar with the banana more prominent. The weight was in the heavy-medium area. SUPER SMOOTH !

72,224,postulanTrappist,4.73,"Sampled from a 500ml bottle.  A - This massive beer looks monolithic in my Weihenstephan 0.5l weisen glass (thanks to dustinwilliams). Murky and walnut-brown in color (tawny-amber when held up to a light). Medium to high carbonation, and a 3-finger tan, creamy head with good retention.  S - Mildly peppery cloves, dates, banana, and some alcohol in the background that comes across a bit like vanilla. A hint of muskiness.  T - A delightful explosion of tastes to be sure and more or less what the aroma lets on. Very sweet date-like fruit up front that hangs on through mid-palate, followed by peppery cloves. A big complex ending here with a bit of alcohol burn, some banana, mild chocolate, and a hint of bubblegum coming through in the long and slightly dry finish. Towards the end I thought I caught perhaps a hint of hop presence as well, but it might simply be my imagination.  M - Medium-bodied, substantial, and somewhat slick. Carbonation is palpable when swallowing.  D - I would love to have another if only I hadn't imbibed the first one so quickly.  This is the first wheat-doppelbock I've come across, but it seems to do a great job of balancing out the hefeweizen and doppelbock traits. It's fruity and sweet, but not cloyingly so. Banana and cloves are present, but not dominant. It even has some similarities to the tripel style, which earns it brownie points in my book. A truly amazing beer to be sure, and one that will call me back time and again.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,SFBeerGuy,4.57,"Poured form the bottle into a wheat beer glass  A- Poured a relatively clear dark maple brown at first. After swirling the last bit of beer in the bottle and pouring the yeast into the glass the clarity diminished and the traditional wheat cloudiness was present. Magical process! Opaque, solid brown with ample 1.5"" light tan head leaving trace lacing (not much). Minimal, but present, layer of foam lasts the entire drink.  S- Even in the bottle the incredible aroma is evident. The obvious banana, clove traits from the yeast hit the nose first. They are accompanied by an incredibly intense and complicated bouquet of aromas. I get spice of cinnamon, mild black pepper, and nutmeg. Fruits consisting of ripe raisins, dates, and currants.  T- Bittersweet caramel and toast (crust). Complex yeasty spice with some alcohol presence. Noble hop bitterness wiggles through at the end but is beautifully mellowed by the yeast.* The yeast spice dances with the hops and lingers wonderfully on the pallet.  M- Medium carbonation, smooth and filling. 8.2%ABV is evident after the first sip but, once again, balances well with the spice  D- Very! Each sip begs for another. The lingering spice opens for new flavors as the brew warms and the malt become even more present.  *Try a sip of this beer before you add the yeast from the bottom of the bottle to experience more of the hop flavor. It is a different brew!!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Crack1Open,4.2,"A- Amberish deep brown transparent. First pour was a little aggressive thus creating a fluffy head that sticks around but leaves no lacing. Second creates little to no head and appears murky due to sediment.  S- Smell varies. Banana, cloves, roast malts, and wheat in varying orders. Also a bit of alcohol.  T- Starts with banana to a hefe/wheat with spices. Then yeasty spice to roasted malt (though a basic malt flavor seems to be present through this beautiful flavor train). Definitely some dark fruit notes in there. Sometimes finishes with banana to accompany the slight alcohol burn at times. Taste seems to vary in general and especially as it warmed up.  M- Starts with a some what medium body but quickly becomes thin and watery. Very light carbonation. Finishes quite pleasant.  D- While one of my favorites, the drinkability is decent but not extremely high out of the bottle. I don't know why but, when it's on tap the drinkability is definitely higher. Definitely a sipper meant to enjoy when having it out the bottle.  This is a great beer. It's somewhat simple and quite complex at times. Better when it's cool to warm.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,GatorBeerNerd,4.27,"500 ml bottle purchased at Green's on Ponce and poured into the 100 year Anniversary Aventinus glass.  A: The glass makes it appear almost like a half and half. The beer in the ""neck"" at the bottom of the glass is quite a bit lighter looking than what is in the large bowl at the top of the glass. The color is a nice brown with a bit of haze. The head was huge and I had to pause to let it settle a bit to be able to finish off the pour. The head disappears over the course of a few minutes down to a nice covering that retains well. There are big sheets of lace that just can't quite stick with each swallow.  S: It has quite a malty sweet aroma with spice characteristics mixed in. I am picking up quite a bit of banana in the aroma along with some other dark fruit notes.  T: Quite a bit of banana and clove mix in with the huge caramel malty sweetness. I really like the flavor of this brew.  M: The in mouth carbonation and spicing makes this one a bit aggressive in the mouth. It is a relatively thin beer.  D: There is a bit of alcohol warming that happens from this one that makes you slow down a bit. However, there are many weizenbocks that are more aggressive than this one.",Schneider Weisse G.

Looks great! Pours brown in color. There's about three to four inches of off white head sitting atop the beer. Looks amazing in the glass. Smell is some wheat and caramel. Taste is more of the caramel and toffee notes. There is just a hint of roastiness coming in at the end of each sip. This is super smooth and incredibly easy drinking.

72,224,Spacegrass,4.35,"Poured in a Moose Drool glass, which is fairly similar to the Aventinus glass they serve these in at Weisse's Brauhaus in Munich.  A- Dark brown in the thicker part of the glass, burgundy/dark amber in the thinner part. Carbonation coming up the glass like in a Hefeweizen, with a giant fluffy head. Bits of lacing stay behind.  S- Pungent sweet banana freshness. Very balanced. Easy on the nose. Slight alcohol bite.  T- Similar to a Hefeweizen in many ways, but of course darker and with hints of alcohol. Leaves a lingering sweet banana aftertaste that keeps you happy for long time.  M- Carbonation throughout but not overwhelming. Smooth. Sits well on the tongue. I would say the high alcohol and sweetness detract slightly as you finish the sip, but then it finishes calm.

72,224,photomike,4.35,"A minimal head dies quickly (and very loudly) down to almost nothing, which eventually disappears to absolutely nothing, leaving me with a murky, brown, muddy looking beer. Clarifies as it warms. Not the best looking, I have to say. Though I haven't had too many Weizenbocks, I have to say that Vitus (its closest competitor in my mind and the BA ratings) is a much better looking beer.  I must say that Aventinus wins on smell between those two, however. Intoxicatingly sweet malt with heavy clove background. Lots of spice here. A little bit of banana, tangerine sweetness and maybe some mango. Alcohol detectable if you really get deep down in there. A beautiful array of smells.  An outstanding flavor. Sweet and tart, with abundant spices and fleshy citrus fruits. Tropical bananas and fresh mangoes as well. You know how fresh mango can have that kind of peppery, spicy taste? I get a bit of that. A very slight roastiness and alcohol at the finish as the beer approaches room temperature.  The mouthfeel on this is similar to Vitus as well. It starts out a bit too carbonated for my liking, but as it sits, the carbonation develops into a pleasant effervescence. A nice burn when you hold it in your mouth. Creamy slickness, and a nice full body.  I love the 500ml size for this one. Just the right amount to give me a good buzz without going overboard.  Overall, this is an excellent beer, and is just about even with Vitus in my book. My ratings for the two show Vitus to be the clear preference, but its not as clear cut. The appearance is where this brew really suffers, and kinda drags down my rating.  I quite enjoy this, but since Vitus is cheaper and more readily available, I will pick it up more often. I think I prefer it slightly anyway.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

It's hard to see, but there is a lively carbonation going on. Head shrinks to a small pillow in a couple minutes. Little lacing apparent.  The aroma is like a malty hefeweizen. I'm getting sweet malts, and caramel. Also spices and citrus. Just the slightest warming hint.  I see why this is considered one of the best in the world. So creamy and smooth, I get lots of caramel, and it goes nicely with the citrus and spice. I'm getting this sort of caramalized apple taste here as well. What an impressive blend. I had no idea what to expect going into this one but I'm very pleased. There is no sign of the 8.2% ABV. Very well hidden.  Creamy and smooth. Goes down with ease. A little more bite from the carbonation than I would have liked, but thats pretty much my only knock on drinkability. Alcohol is all but non-existent. I really like this brew.

Body is somewhat translucent, but has an underlying haze.  Sweet malty aroma of warm caramel, apples, plums, cloves and some brown sugar.  The flavors really come through as this beer warms. Initially, the flavors were fruity and sugary. But as time went on, it tastes more like clove infused fermented apples.  Perhaps a little too carbonated, for the body is light and disappears quickly.

Faint coffee detected on the aftertaste, which actually works really well here. Finishes clean.  M - The rich flavors are not supported completely by the medium-thin body and active carbonation, but it's not a deal breaker.  D - Very drinkable for an 8% ABV, and it's not even that strong.

Like if nerds made a side with dark fruit nerds.  Tastes ok. a little to sweet. but thin aftertaste. Like those dots you would eat off the paper roll. The dots were sweet but you'd always bite off some of the paper.  This beer overall is like the cola flavored Fizz candies.

A - Hazy reddish copper-colored body with royal purple highlights and half a finger of bubbly off-white head that diminished into a patchy film and eventually disappeared completely, leaving no noticeable lacing on the glass.  S - Aroma ark fruits reminiscent of ripe plums, raisins and red grapes backed by a wheat malt character. The back of the aroma almost resembles a table wine, with hints of semi-sweet grapes and mild spices.  T - Dark fruits dominate the flavor with tangy notes suggesting plum, as well as hints of grape and berry sweetness, while a substantial wheat malt presence serves as the foundation of this Weizenbock. Subtle spicy clove notes work well with the dark fruit character and mask the alcohol presence, as subtle as it is.  M - Medium bodied with a round, chewy texture and moderate carbonation. Sweet and slightly sour on the palate with a very subtle bitter finish. Alcohol is virtually undetectable for such a hefty brew.

It is very hazy when put up to the light. Off a very delicate pour, it has a massive 3.5 finger off-white head that slowly goes to two fingers before finally resting at a one finger layer. Tons of bubbles rise up from the bottom.  S-Clove, wheat, and banana are definitely noticeable, but dark stone fruits lead the way in the aroma category.  T-The sweet dark stone fruits hit first. The clove really makes itself present as it goes down. Various afterstates arise including some bubblegum as well as a peppery, spicy bite. As it warms the banana flavors really jump out.  M-Medium to heavy bodied. The massive head results in a creamy texture and the carbonation results in a nice prickly feel on the tongue.  D-Deceptively drinkable. Knowing the higher abv on this one limits its drinkability, but if I was not told how strong it was, I could easily knock back a few.  A great beer that frequently is an impulse buy when I go beer shopping. One of these days I need to go and pick up the official Aventinus glass to give this beer its proper due.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,bulletrain76,3.82,"50cl bottle. Hazy deep brown with a big head that dies and leaves some thin foam. Tried to go for the massive head in the pic, but apparently I wasn't anal enough about cleaning my glass... oh well, it happens. Aroma of caramelized bananas, like bananas fried until a dark brown color. Add a little bubble-gum, nut liquer, and clove spice, and you have a pretty sweet aroma happening. The flavor has a rich caramel quality, with bubble-gum sweetness, bread, and a hint of alcohol. Banana and clove are their, but don't manifest as assertively as in the aroma. full bodied with the same effervescent carbonation that you would find in a regular hef. Something about this just doesn't quite work for me. It's OK, but more subtle bubbles would work better for me. I like how smoothly the wheat character blends in with the rich caramel components. Good stuff.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,azorie,4.35,"A: Drinking this in the sun light it looks like caramel candy in the glass. I poured it at 45 degrees and I did not get much foam head. I left some yeast in the bottle. which when i poured directly in gave me a 1/2 head of lace.  S: intensely wheat malt hits my nose first, and a strong alcohol presence. no hops detected at all. I smell cloves mainly.  T: Big time malty wheat up front taste, with a clove and liquorish back bite. Very nice a hint of alcohol. Very warming on the tongue. I myself do not detect any hops but they could be hiding behind the alcohol.  M: Medium-bodied, with strong carbonation  D: works for me I reviewed on the 2nd one good stuff",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Arbitrator,3.37,"Chilled bottle into glass.  A: Pours a translucent mahogany color with ruby and amber highlights when held to a lamp. The one-inch off-white head recedes over a few minutes into a donut around the glass. Substantial lacing when I take a swig, but nothing that sticks to the sides as I drink.  S: Dark fruit, spices, wheat, bubble gum, and banana.  T: Wow, a lot of bubble gum and banana up front. The two flavors segue into a dark fruit medley, mostly raisins and plums, that lay on the sweetness. The taste ends with a combination of wheat, cloves, and coriander. Tastes a lot like a dark Belgian ale, more than a bock.  M: Medium-bodied, with strong carbonation that gives it a spicy kick but detracts from the flavor a bit. The ABV has a very slight sting and singes the nose hairs on the exhale, but it is very manageable otherwise.  D: It feels almost like this beer isn't sure what it wants to be. Very heavy tastes, but a medium body and high carbonation. The flavors blend very well, but it's heavy enough on the tongue that a single one of these is enough to induce palate fatigue. I enjoyed the first 1/3 of this but was progressively less enthused on the rest.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,AlcahueteJ,4.33,"A - Began to pour this with the weizen glass tilted at 45 degrees, and the entire glass began to fill up with foam. Gave it some time to settle then SLOWLY poured the rest. Now it's a beautiful dark cloudy chestnut body with a rocky four-fingered off-white head that doesn't want to go away.  S - Wreaks of malty sweetness with a strong nose that's loaded with yeasty goodness. Hints of raisins and other dark fruits that I can't pin down.  M - Medium mouthfeel that's sticky with a moderate level of carbonation.  T - Spices up front followed with more hints of dark fruits, yeast in the middle, and then you get hit with the alcohol. Hops take a backseat to this malty brew.  D - Drinkability is off the charts for 8.2%. What a refreshing beer, and on this hot night it's perfect. The alcohol is noticeable, but the beer is so crisp and sweet I'm struggling to sip, with a strong urge to chug.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Hoagie1973,4.23,"I popped the cap on this one and turned away to get my weizen glass. When I turned back it was foaming out the mouth of the bottle and down the side in a thick sticky mass. Never had that happen before. After I cleaned up the mess, I poured. Nice mahogany color with a course cream-colored head. Reduced to a cap rather quick, but stayed there throughout. Aroma of dark fruit, wheat malt and spicy yeast. Almost a red wine-like character to the nose with surprisingly noticeable alcohol that perks up the nose hairs. Flavor is incredibly fruity and sweet. Black cherries are at the forefront, with some brown sugar, mild spice and warming alcohol in the finish (fairly well blended, more prominant in the nose). Hops are not detectable, but there maintains a tenuous balance; sweetness is barely held in check. Crisp and full bodied. A bit creamy, but short of syrupy. Awesome. A bit sweet, but complex, refreshing, and very unique. There's nothing I've had to date that I could compare this to.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Bierfreund,4.43,"Found it in our local beer store, what a surpise! We had seen this beer before elsewhere, but there it had been offered in a case only, and if I remember it right, the asked price had been around 80$. We can't afford to spend that kind of money on a beer we have never even tried, so we had to let that go.  But now!!! Sold in single bottles for 4.50$. Yay! That's more like it!  It poured hazlebrown (!) into our glasses (german wife and I share all beers), the head was very thick and dark beige (even a bit brownish). And that thick head stayed!  Fruity nose gave a slight hint of lemon. Wife even thought of pineapples.  I am trying it - wow! The alcohol (8.2% Vol.) hits me in the face immediately. I am thinking of Brandy while sipping this fine bavarian beer.  Nice tingeling with every sip, yet a very smooth mouthfeel.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BZero007,4.58,"I have had this beer on tap and bottle, most recently on Tap at the Bier Garden in Portsmouth, VA.  Brew was brought to me in a Aventinus glass and was poured pefectly. With the head just below the rim of the glass and with an off white to brown color. Aroma was of Dark fruits with a malty background. The Weizenbock it self looked like Cola brown with copper accents swirling threw it. Taste will have you take a step back abit. The dark fruit flavors and Complex Malts are made dominant due to the carbonation and Alcohol. The taste is just amazing and it does not feel like brew that would weigh you down and allows you to keep drinking. Carbonation is not over done but the Alcohol level may sneak up on you. Great beer and will have to keep a few in the beer fridge.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,SingleCell,4.72,"Poured into my Weizen glass from a 500mL bottle after going into the fridge for 20 mins because my cellar is running warmer then the recommended serving temp.  A: Very lively looking beer. Blood orange to copper coloured murky beer with a three inch rocky off white head which subsides very quickly into a thin 1/8 inch head which is maintained due to the strong carbonation.  S: Wow did I just open a beer or a package of bubble gum? Big bubble gum presence right off the bat with banana notes in the background. Also some very sweet orange chocolate in the background. There is also alot of yeast in the nose.  T: Again the bubble gum is right there upfront. Actually, all of the scents I mentioned above are present in the taste. There is also some more estery flavours there as well as spiciness.  M: Medium to heavy carbonation with medium body. Although the carbonation is heavy the beer is surprisingly and pleasantly quite smooth.  D: Some alcohol makes its way through in the taste which slightly hurt the drinkability of this beer. Also at 8.2% I'm probably only going to have one. However, the beer has a great smell, an equally great taste and an excellent mouthfeel.  Overall an excellent beer. Still a little bit of heat present after one year of cellaring. I've got a few more in the cellar which will be tasted a few years from now. Cheers everyone!",Schneider Weisse G.

Wow the smells pop out at you-the aroma is big and it's powerful like you would expect from a wheat beer. Red grapes, plums, dates and yeast. Smell is outstanding and welcoming.  Taste is like a fruity belgian dark ale but with the consistency and mouthfeel of a Bock. Very fruity-light and dark with spices like cloves and coriander. Reminds me of a Unibroue 17 but with an emphasis on dark fruits and less spiciness. Apricots, raisin and plum truffles.  Mouthfeel is incredible. Very quenching, very tasty. The beer is dark and the abv is high but the body is light and fluffy .  This beer is well balanced and world class. I can drink it at any occasion and it is worth the buy in any environment, any season.  A+++.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

S: Crisp yeast with banana, bubblegum, and clove. Some sweet/tart fruit as well--perhaps green apple. Various dried fruits.  T: Dried fruits and a little bit of that green apple taste. Not as much of the bubblegum/banana as in the nose. Some dried fruits, as well as some slight spices.  M: Creamy and tart. Medium bodied with a pretty hefty dose of carbonation. The alcohol lets its presence be known, even though this is only 8.2abv.

S - Ooerripened bananas, clove, toasted malt, raisins a lot going on here  T - more of the same from the nose, much dryer than expected though. a bit of warmth from the alcohol is nice. mmm what a tasty brew!  MF - perfect amount of lively and crisp carb upfront, but then rolls down the throat with delicious smoothness.  D - Alcohol is pretty well hidden till the beer gets relatively warm. WIth a taste this exceptional, the drinkability is pretty high, with the only drawback the high abv.  Notes - this was a perfect partner of this colder spring evening in colorado. i was actually expecting a lot from this beer seeing as though it is spoke of so highly, and fortunately for me i did not set the bar too high, as those expectations were greatly surpased.",Schneider Weisse G.

The head is pretty dense and bright white.  S- Nice smell, great wheat smell. Not burnt not to sweet like many american wheat beers. But the flavor is perfect. Probably as good as it gets in this style. Hints of chocolate and other dark fruits. The hops are not totally gone either. The taste has a sort of bite to it, a bitterness that stricks in the begining but fades to the malt sweetness.  M- So smooth, more smooth than almost anyother beer I can recollect. It's pretty amazing actually really enjoyable. The carbonation is so well done. The beer isn't too thick and not so thin it's like water.

Plenty of frothy head that won't quit and leaves lots of lacing.  4.0 S: Tons of banana followed by a spicy clove torrent.  3.5 T: Much, much more earthy than I was expecting. Esters in the nose are for the most part MIA. There's still a bit of spiciness to it though. Crystal malt flavor apparent, but lacking the sweetness I usually get from a weizenbock.  4.0 M: Medium body. Bubbly carbonation with an otherwise creamy backbone.  4.5 D: Very drinkable for a weizenbock due to the low level of sweetness.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Smell: Dark, sweet-scented wheat malt aroma full of notes of cocoa, caramel, banana chips, dark fruit, and with a particularly fragrant spiciness and minor whiff of peppery alcohol.  Taste: Deeply toasted wheat malt flavor with tastes of spiced chocolate powder and a bit of dark caramel candy. Heavy-handed dose of cracked cloves and cinnamon. Raisin-flavored bubblegum and banana fruitiness. Spicy, slightly herbaceous hops with a subdued bitterness. Sourish yeast quality. Dovetail of spicy phenolics and sweet malted wheat in the final tastes. Finishes malty and warming with a lingering spiciness.  Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-high, lively carbonation.

Smells like a Dunkelweizen on the nose, not overly pungent with malt and banana aroma, and in the mouth...it's much the same, only more intense and malty, with maybe a little too much alcohol taste.  This beer is the originator of its style, and, as such, is a standard in a small but exceptional selection of beers, but I'll get into raving about the characteristics I find in this beer when I have time to write a review on the Schneider Weisse.",Schneider Weisse G.

Taste was fruity and malty with a slight hint of vinegar after the swallow. Hops were minimal, which is to my taste. Mine was a 2007 for what it's worth.  Good mouth feel and body.

72,224,ludachris,4.03,"Decided to give this one a try after having the Schneider weisse original. Pours a murky burnt caramel with three fingers of a solid tan cloud like head. Nice thick lacing. Sings of some lively carbonation. Very, very inviting. Banana, clove and some light citrus up front in the nose followed by a touch of sweet malts and some caramel. Bananas and clove mixed with some chocolate, caramel and some dark fruits in the taste. Finishes off dry and with a hint of alcohol. No hop presence. Mouthfeel very well balanced between the fruits and the sweetness. Smooth, smooth, smooth. 8% ABV is well hidden, making this an easily quaffable brew.  Overall, an excellent weizenbock. I don't know how much that means, with Aventinus being my first one, but man was this tasty. I thought the appearance was the highlight of this brew. Found the sweet malts a little bit too sweet, but nothing offending. I will probably be buying another one of these down the road after I sample a few other weizenbocks. Maybe then will I truly appreciate how good this weizenbock is compared to others.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Both years poured a dark amber, with a generous white head with small bubbles. The older beer was clear, while the newer one was cloudy.  The fresh beer had the distinct wheat beer aroma and flavor, which was noticably absent from the aged bottle. The aged was more of a straght, hard dopplebock, while the fresh bottle had a solid weissbier flavor that was also very pleasing on a somewhat warm evening out by the barbeque.  Both bottles were wonderful. Highly recommended.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,sourdoughsteve,4.38,"Stumbled upon this while shopping for some Ayinger Celebrator. The clerk suggested that I might like this as well, so I invested in a bottle.  Poured into a pint glass.  A: Nice dark amber to chocolate, with a two-finger beige head. Not as hazy as one would expect from a non-filtered wheat.  S: First impression was fruity, and even perhaps grassy. Once the head deteriorated, I could detect more of the clove & banana notes.  F: Mmmmm. Really well balanced. Had a wee bit of alcohol coming through, but you'd expect that in a doppel.  M: Not overly thick. Carbonation was nice, and not flat or fizzy.  D: An impressive hybrid in my opinion. I'll buy more of it. Not a good session beer at 8.2% ABV, but good for a nice one-off now and again. Serious stuff!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,NightINgale,4.24,"A: Aventinus has a cloudy mahogany body, with plenty of light-tan head.  S: The aroma is very enticing! A robust scent that includes cloves, citrus, bananas, caramel, and a touch of chocolate malts.  T: The taste is a bit disappointing after such an outstanding aroma. The finish is very faint, which kind of ruins the overall impression. Despite that, this beer is very well-balanced and has enough complexity to it. It tastes more like a dunkel-weissbier than a doppelbock, though. Has a nice banana/cloves profile, combined with some chocolaty notes and a touch of caramel.  M: Medium-bodied, very smooth and satisfying overall.  D: Very drinkable for a 8.2% beer. I'd say this is more drinkable than most doppelbocks out there.",Schneider Weisse G.

A: Two fingers of off-white head over a delicious dark brew of hazy chocolate and caramel-colored hues; yeast particles both in the head and settling at the bottom. Lovely! S: Heavy, refreshing wheat aroma complete with bananas, light clove and some spices, and eventually an enchilada/mole sauce smell. Not sure where this came from, but it made me want to eat some Mexican! T: Refreshing wheat and damp grains (not quite ""wet"", but not completely ""grainy""). Great flavors that imitate the aromas, particularly the cloves and spices. Hints of caramel and light chocolate malts. Sweet fruits, as well. A sour kick meets up with my mouth at the end of the sip. M: Light on the mouthfeel, but the carbonation is great! D: Did I mention this is incredibly refreshing? Each sip throws out new and different characteristics.

A: The beer is a bright reddish brown color, with a short off-white head that fades quickly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is of wheat, caramelized malts, some fruit, some spice and a touch of hops.  T: The taste is very well-balanced with bready flavors of wheat and yeast up front. Then there are sweet flavors of bananas, caramel and dark fruit that quickly follow. The malt character is hearty and the hops presence is mild but both seem to work very well in this beer. The after-taste is slightly sweet.  M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.  D: Tasty and very flavorful, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, excellent representation of style, this is a style that is difficult for me to figure out because I find such diversity in the beers that I've had in it, but this beer is definitely one of the best Weizenbocks I've had.

Smells like something I'd want to drink.  Tastes like spicy caramel with yeasty, clove saturated rum raisins. Creamy mouthfeel with no yeasty snap, though at times syrupy. Seems like something sugar plum fairies would drink.  I'm usually skeptical about beers on the top 100 due to the fact that I believe most are just considered great because no one can get them.

A moderate head that looks rather creamy with uniform cous-cous sized bubbles. The head then fades within a minute to thick lacing rings. Smell- Sweet fruity notes of spotted bananas and sour apple and chocolate malt. Major yeast bottle conditioning notes as well over powering toward the end of the beer. Taste- Very strong bottle conditioning, it a new experience for me, once past that flavors really emerge and its amazing with the smell just as the taste, bitterness from the malt and sourness for the BC. This beer is really complex and very few minutes it seems to change character, very pleasant. Mouthfeel- Very big and bold present in each sip. The limited carbonation was just what was needed. The alcohol was somewhat in the background, but ever present. Drinkability- Its like being on a rollercoaster, the experience is overwhelming but everytime you find yourself waiting back in line.  Outstanding its worth the experience to track it down.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

T-Sweet creamy bannana bread with raisins and a yeasty opener, with a mild bitterness mid palate, and, unusually, a dry sweet finish. Huge complexity here, and the flavors totally mask the ABV.  M-Mouthfeel on the heavier side, with some amped up carbonation, but the density can handle it. Syrupy, but actually lighter than I expected.  D-This one hit the exact spot I was looking for tonight. Another, hell yes, probably not back to back as this is a singular experience, but a definate buy again beer.  This was a really nice surprise. I'm not at all familiar with this style so forgive me if I say it reminds me a bit of Chimay Blue.

72,224,callmescraps,3.95,"Don't know a whole lot about this one, but decided I'd try it.  Appearance - Very deep amber/red. Almost looks chocolate brown. A nice inch of head that lingers.  Smell - Spicy banana bread. Some clove. Plenty of banana. Some lemon. Some funky hefe yeast action. Orange peel. Some spice, almost Belgian like.  Taste - A spicy tang up front. Definite citrus, balanced with the spice. More maltiness than with a hefe, that's for sure. A sweet lingering taste. Some toasted malt, a little of that banana, and some earthier, prune like fruitiness. A slight hint of alcohol warmness. Also, the slightest chocolate is evident.  Mouthfeel - Excellent. Good carbonation. It coats the tongue beautifully. Not too heavy. Crisp. Just great.  Drinkability - Hmmm. Probably the lowlight. That spicy banana thing, especially with the sweet follow, makes this one hard to put away. One will be enough, thanks.  A very good, interesting, and complex beer. It's got a lot going on. It does have a sweetness, stickiness of the banana that just hangs around too much to make me really love it. Still, an excellent beer, and a great style.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,TexIndy,4.92,"Poured from a 500ml bottle into a weizen glass. Back label had some bottling codes but couldn't translate into a date. It was ruby brown color. Massive amount of carbonation. Sliding initial lace that doesn't stick.  The aroma was amazing. Over-ripe banana, clove, vanilla in front with chocolate malt in back. I love the smell of wheats and this one was outstanding. I find most weizenbocks to be overly dominated by dark fruits and less enjoyable but this one nailed it. The taste was exceptional. Awesome from start to finish. Great wheat beer taste. Since the aroma was very sweet, I was worried that the taste might be too sweet but it wasn't. Great balance to keep it from becoming cloying. A pleasure to drink. Only complaint on the mouthfeel was a tad too much carbonation.  Overall, an world class beer. Most highly recommend. I had one of these for the first time several years back and it was awful. At the time, it was my first weizenbock so I assumed it was the style. I'd have several weizenbocks since then that were good but had been avoiding this one till now. So glad that I finally gave it another shot. My last try must have been a seriously bad bottle. I still remember the horrid aroma and bitter taste. Now that I've had the real thing, it will be a major player in the rotation.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Kromes,4.57,"Pours a deep dark brown with a thick head that kind of died out. Lots of carbonation bubbles going on inside the glass. Yeasty sweet aromas with some floral notes. OK smell, but not great. Yeast, sweet alcohol, fruity banana and toasted malt flavors. There is a clove spiciness to this beer in the finish. Good mouthfeel, not too watery and good carbonation that tingles the tongue and adds to the spice. No off flavors, everything in the beer blends extremely well and doesn't step on one another, good balance. The good thing about this beer is after the initial alcohol shock on the first taste, it mellows out and gets better and better as you drink more and more. The beer changes and different flavors start to come out as the alcohol flavors fade to nothing. I can still taste the clove five minutes after the last sip. Very nice.  --- Vintage 2004...  Poured into a goblet. A clear dark amber color with no head, just a little fountain of bubbles coming up through the middle of the glass.  There is a strong apple juice, plum, cherry, and port aroma coming off the beer. Very nice.  The yeast has settled out of the beer and now there is no apparent clove or banana spice. The flavor mimics the aroma very closely. An apple, cherry, plum, and sherry-like flavor with a touch of caramel in the background. It is a very balanced and smooth flavor. No apparent alcohol flavor, just a tiny burn in the finish.  The smooth mouthfeel is still there, but maybe a little more watery due to the yeast and proteins settling out of the beer. Still has a good body and a nice warm spicy carbonation.  Whether it's fresh or aged 8 years, this beer is still great. One of my all-time favorite beers. It's amazing how different the beer is when it matures and the yeast settles out.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,johnmichael712,4.35,"First, let me warn you: this is one super carbonated beer. As soon as I popped off the bottle cap the head began to rise inside the bottle and I quickly had to grab my glass to save myself from a mess. So, consider yourself warned.  Appearance: Poured out of a 500 ml (16.9 ounces my calculator tells me) bottle into a Paulaner weizen glass. This beer pours a very dark golden brown color with an enormous off-white head. Once I swirl the remainder of the beer inside the bottle and add it to my glass a heavy amount of yeast sediment can be seen floating in the beer. Holding this beer up to a light reveals an absolutely insane amount of carbonation bubble rising from the bottom of the glass, and it reminds me of those thermal vents on the ocean floor you see videos of. The head looks very soft and pillowy and lingers for a long time, but surprisingly leaves no lace on the glass.  Smell: The nose of this beer showcases its very strong phenol aroma with bananas and apples being the most prominent. There is also a strong clove presence, along with hints of crystal malts and light brown sugar. The nose is fairly reminiscent of spiced apple cider, but with a much stronger malt presence.  Taste: This beer starts off with a strong amount of sweetness and yeasty, bready, malty flavors; moves to a complex fruitiness and spiciness; then fades to a rich, syrupy sweetness at the end intertwined with a moderate amount of alcohol flavor. Along the way there are notes of banana, clove, and vanilla, along with a slight hint of chocolate from the malts. The finish brings the clove phenols to the forefront, along with a pleasant warming effect from the alcohol. The spiciness and warmth of the finish would make this a good winter beer for when you're sitting in front of a fire.  Mouthfeel: This beer is medium bodied with a good amount of creaminess and carbonation. Unlike some of the other reviews, however, I don't think this beer is too carbonated for the style or too carbonated to adversely affect the mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Despite the fact that the alcohol is faintly present in the finish it is in no way overpowering, and this is one highly drinkable beer. This beer has all the drinkability of a good Dunkleweisse but a much stronger malt flavor. All of this adds up to make for one great beer.  Notes: BJCP history for this style tells me that ""Aventinus, the world's oldest top-fermented wheat doppelbock, was created in 1907 at the Weisse Brauhaus in Munich using the 'Méthode Champenoise' with fresh yeast sediment on the bottom. It was Schneider's creative response to bottom-fermenting doppelbocks that developed a strong following during these times"", and I feel blessed to be able to drink ""the original"". Whether or not that means this is the best is up for debate, but only time (and me drinking more Weizenbocks) will tell. If you're a big fan of wheat beers or of any of the similar styles, be sure to give this one a try.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Lightly toasty, just a bit of dark fruit, some spicy alcohol in there as well.  Taste is sweet - caramelized brown sugar, some banana and clove, some lightly tart cherry and fig presence without over-asserting, crisp and fairly light from the wheat, which pokes its head out towards the finish just a bit. Some spicy alcohol, and a noticeable earthy bitterness towards the finish.  Mouthfeel is crisp, light, effervescent, with a bit of warmth from the alcohol.  Drinkability is good. Lighter in body because of the wheat, but with just a bit of warming alcohol.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,ThirdLap,4.03,"Just realized that this will be the first Weizenbock I think I've ever had. Picked this bottle up at Bottle Barn in Santa Rosa, CA for $3.49.  Pours a medium-dark copper with a two-finger thick off-white head. Big chunky foam dissipates after a minute or two, leaving a resilient halo around the rim. Nearly opaque at first glance, Aventinus is revealed to be much clearer when held to the light.  Nose is dominated by dark fruits and banana, with a solid caramel and spice presence. A distinct yeasty breadiness starts the first taste off, with banana, vanilla, and roast malt rounding things out. Finish is spicy at first, leaving the mouth both bitter and banana-filled.  Mouthfeel is somewhat light and smooth, but the depth of flavor and weight on my tongue has me calling this a medium-bodied beer. The 8.0% abv is well-masked, and carbonation is medium to high. Despite not being very noticeable on the nose or tongue, the higher abv is evident in its warming effect after each swallow.  While I definitely enjoyed my first Aventinus, I have to admit that I was expecting something a bit different after reading all the rave reviews. It's an excellent beer (one that I will almost certainly seek out and review again) but not one of my favorites at the moment.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Rayek,4.24,"A: Imposing orange tinged spiced cider with active carbonation, and a swirling tornado of yeast. The eggshell head; unfortunately, doesn't stick around long and only leaves patches of lace.  S: An excellent mix of bananas, cloves, walnuts, and baking chocolate, plus a whiff of alcohol.  T: The aromas from the nose transition seamlessly into the flavor. A nutty banana-bread flavor starts things out. A heavy clove bitterness is held up by a mild alcohol burn. Goes down somewhat warm, with a lingering clove aftertaste. Finishes tart and dry with a strong lemon snap.  M: Medium body is grainy. It doesn't have quite the level carbonation I was expecting.  D: It's snowing outside, and I'm home from work watching flakes swirl through the air and rain down upon the ground. My beer and I are safe and warm inside the house. I'm thoroughly enjoying its company.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Some dark fruits and citrus present as well.  M--The carbonation becomes very apparent once it hits the tongue, its almost as if this beer is exploding in your mouth.

The carbonation level looked fairly high at first glance when pouring the yeast. I enjoyed watching everything bounce around in the glass. Made me thirsty!  The traditional banana and yeast scents were very present.. an overall sweet smell. very pleasant.  This is a very good tasting beer. I got the sweet, over-ripe banana flavors mixed with just a hint of bitterness in the dry finish.  The feel of this beer is very nice.

There's a nice malty backbone, with strong caramel, spice and dark fruit flavors. The more recognizable hefe flavors are present, but they're very muted and and mix into the background. A touch of alcohol warmth is present at the finish, but it's hidden very well considering the 8% ABV.  M - Medium body with more carbonation than I expected. It's actually quite lively on the tongue, which is a nice contrast to the deep flavor.  D - I'm not a huge fan of hefeweizens, and I had my doubts about how much I would like this beer.

At first it was like banana cream pie. But once I got my nose up close I smelled clove, banana, wheat, and some other spice I can't identify. Smells sweet. Bread, and a bit of alcohol.  Taste is like nose. Slightly sweeter than a hefe and you can taste more malt than in a hefe. But much more banana and clove than malt in the taste, as opposed to a doppelbock. No hop flavors.

Aroma of brown bread, clove, banana, apple butter, some hot green chile, and mild solvent. Deep, complex, and very nice.  Tastes malty up front, like toasted sweet brown bread with a bit of molasses, then big waves of warm spice and ripe banana hit, with ripe apple and solvent following close behind. Some tealike astringency comes in after several seconds, balancing the fruity solventy sweetness. Long finish, spicy, fruity and astringent, becoming almost dry.  Nice little bubbles.

Very smooth, nary a hint of alcohol, tastes of banana and only a mild acidic on the finish.  M: Carbonation and mouthfeel are almost perfect. If it was only slightly thicker I think it would be.

Sweet toasted wheat, yeast, and sour cherry notes.  Layer upon layer of flavor here. The alcohol is there, but always in the background. Sweet grain, tart cherry, tons of juicy pear, a little yeasty bread, and a slight bitterness as your palate clears.  Enough carbonation in this one to keep the palate clean.

The flavors were just plain outstanding and shocking in how balanced they were compared to the sour aroma. I tasted rich malts, wheat, alcohol heat, nuts, caramel, toffee, dark fruits in the esters, hints of chocolate malt and spices. Outstanding complexity and drinkability for 8%.

Heady fades too quickly for the style, popping and fizzing its way down to a thin cap. Colour is deep auburn or sepia brown and is opaque. Medium-low carbonation with tiny bubbles evident. Head disappears totally and no lacing evident.  SMELL: Wheat malt with cloves, bananas and lemon undertones as well. Sweet caramel malt and some hints of dark fruits like dates and grapes in the distance. A nice strong scent with a underlying ""coolness"" to it.  TASTE: Wheat malt, but not bready like their normal hefeweizen, with cloves, bananas and lemon in the background, much like the nose advertises. Dark fruits, dates and grapes, show up again in the taste. A bit of spicy alcohol is there too, but it is well hidden. A mild aftertaste of wheat malt and dark fruits, with a little dose of alcohol spice at the end. Very complex and pleasant for sure.  PALATE: Medium-thick body with medium to low end carbonation. Creamy smooth on the palate, does down smooth with a bit of a bite at the end form the alcohol. Finishes with just the right amount of stickiness. Nice.  OVERALL: Very drinkable and very enjoyable for sure. This is definitely loads better and more interesting than their original hefeweizen. Only the look kept it from being a massive smash.

Oh my, the beautiful aroma hit seconds after the cap came off and before I even tipped the bottle. The chocolate vanilla, banana, clove and rich malts danced in my head. The taste does not disappoint. One can easily pick up the malts, creamy chocolate and wheat. She is properly carbonated for the style and the ingredients God supplied.

Also a bit yeasty on the nose. The taste follows the nose, but with a bit more bitterness. The dominant flavours remain the banana and yeast, some cloves and the aforementioned bitterness. Reminds me in some ways of the New Belgium Abbey, but only in some nuances. It's gentle on the palate, the carbonation is not overwhelming, and it goes down quite smooth. For an above average alcohol content beer, it is not particularly noticeable, which in this case is kind of nice. It's also a beer I could see myself drinking several of if that happened to be what I had, as there are no aspects that really limit it's repeatability. I bought this on recommendation from one of my residents, who had overflowing praise. I came in a little bit skeptical, because that's just the way I take other people's recommendations.

S: Big time banana and clove flavor, much more pronounced than a regular hefe, faint hints of chocolate, has a distinct yeast smell, somewhat plastic, but not out of place. Light burnt smell as well.  T: Follows the nose exactly, banana, a little more chocolate in the mouth than the nose though, a little bit of tangy wheat in there too. Booze is really well hidden for 8.2% (as stated on bottle) strong yeast presence. All the flavors of a solid hefeweizen but amped up. Excellent. I'm really digging this tonight, as opposed to other times I've tried it. Great beer.  M: Thick and creamy, faint carbonation, slight booze warmth.  D: Dangerously drinkable for such a high abv.

Ethanol and spice (cinnamon, star anise) come out with the banana and rich clove flavour to finish the beer.  M: Medium/full bodied, moderately high carbonation, very smooth, rich, a bit of an ethanol slickness.  D: A good beer and certainly regarded as the classic of the style.

72,224,eruckart,4.88,Purchased at a local liquor store out of sheer curiosity and was pleasantly surprised with this beer. I unknowingly had a glass from the brewery from a previous trip to Bruisin' Ales that just happened to be the only glass large enough to hold the beer. I have not had any Weizenbocks before this so I did not know what to expect. It had a sweet taste and quite a bit of head which left some nice lacing on the glass as I drank it down. During my last trip to Bruisin' Ales I picked up a 2004 bottle of the Aventinus to try side by side against a regular bottle of it to see how it changes as it is aged.,Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,droomyster,4.6,"For those who have not tried it and are skeptical about its universal round of applause: yes, Aventinus really is all that! It pours an extremely cloudy spectrum that ranges from a hazy yellow at the thinnest points in the glass to an impenetrable brown at its deepest, with a big, frumpy, tan head standing on top of it all. Its aromas span the spectrum of straightforward wheatiness at one end to complex dark fruits and spices at the other. Yeastiness also comes through loud and clear on the nose, as it does on the palate. Dark fruits including prunes, raisins, and berries, along with a nice toastiness and yeasty softness all blend on together in perfect harmony. For the past 5 years I've been having perhaps two or three of these per year. No matter how many beers in the same or approximate categories that I try, Aventinus remains one of my all-time favorites.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Vigorous carbonation is easily seen even though the brew is an opaquely cloudy mahaogany. That is before I make an effort to swirl the yeast in. A light touch of lacing in spite of the abv and low hop content.  Smell is massively fruity. Big banana, clove, raisins. Hints of anise and a spicy pepperiness. Sweet wheat malt adds a sour lemony twang.  Taste is beyond words but I'll try... Large banana yeastiness with a sweet wheat malty backbone. Clove in abundance with a subtle lemon presence, a gentle twang. Yeast dark fruit esters. A melon like juiciness. Alcoholic sweetness in the finish. A mild hop bittering and a lingering fusel note as well as graham flavored breadiness. Feel is velvety, carbonation is creamy.  Drinkability is better that it has a right to be. While just a touch hot it nevertheless encourages you to go for it. The abv does not call out and the taste and feel is seems lighter than it is.  The paradigm for the style. It has all the attributes of a hefe and a bock in the same glass. At the same time it takes each to a new level in brewing.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,biggred1,4.7,"Turbid, brown body with a fizzy off white head that subsides quickly, minimal lace. Smell is very savory, vanilla, apple, clove, cocoa and banana. Tastes much bigger than the aroma with a nice bubblegum/banana-clove-vanilla quality up front, followed by gingerbread and an almost vinuous chalky smooth, dry finish. Medium mouthfeel with a ton of carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden. One of the finest beers out there. Outstanding.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Amalak,3.51,"The beer pours a cloudy brown, mostly opaque. Thick, foamy head. It has a mild wheat and vanilla smell to it.  Very intense taste. The wheat jumps out at first, but the banana and vanilla sit in the back of the throat. The aftertaste is too much, but I respect the uniqueness of this beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Vengeance526,4.03,"Pours a hazy brown color with a thick, frothy, 3-4 finger white head and moderate amounts of lacing.  Smells of wheat and fruit. Banana, citrus and some grapes all come through. Mildly sweet.  Taste also imparts a mild sweetness with notes of banana and grape. Wheat and cloves also evident.  Mouthfeel is fairly smooth. Alcohol is mostly hidden but does start to come through near the end. I probably wouldn't want more than one of these in a sitting, but this might be worth picking up again some other day.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,DeusExChronica,4.3,"Oh, I'm so glad I came across this beer. Wheat beer fans rejoice, this is an excellent find.  Appearance - The beer pours out as a cloudy brown/dark amber color. Although the murky color may not seem the most appealing, the dark wheat color is still inviting. The head builds up quickly and fades away fast; no lacing on the glass.  Smell - Initially heavy wheat and malt. Citrus came through nicely as I continued. Seemed to pick almost a smokey scent but not sure; there were other scents that I couldn't put my finger on (I'll need to try the beer again).  Taste - Wonderful rich malty taste. Banana bread and small clove flavors come through well without being overpowering. With each sip there was a great transition going from a slight sour to a sweet malt flavor at the end. The taste of the alcohol is strong but all the flavors are so well balanced it doesn't stand out.  Mouthfeel - A little carbonation at the start; very smooth on the tongue  Drinkability - Overall this is a beer that I can and will drink again. Even if you're not a huge wheat or malt fan like myself you will enjoy this beer. While the alcohol strength is masked well by the complex flavors, it is still a strong beer, and one that I would rarely have more than one bottle of in a sitting. As much as I want to say this is a perfect beer, I want to see if Schneider and Sohn can improve anything on it.  As a fan of hefeweizens and good malt beers, Aventinus should not be overlooked. It is well priced and worth the money.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The beer pours with a light amber base that gets progressively darker as it reaches it's perfect white head.  Smells like a bastard child of la folie and ayinger doppelbock absolutley heaven  The taste has less sour tones than the smell would lead you to beleive however the over powering sweetness that is present in some doppelbocks is much more controlled here.  The mouthfeel has some initial carbonation but is very smooth overall not ten fidy smooth but this isnt exactly ten fidy now is it.  Drinks very well for the abv and the style probably couldnt do more than a few bombers without being on my ass but amazing never the less,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,Stimack,4.22,"Brew poured into a Weihenstephan weizen glass. Has a nice deep brown color with a fair sized light tan head that had fair retention which left nice lacing. The aroma is very nice, fresh fruit (highlighting Lemon), clearly banana (guess that would be a fruit but it is a different aroma than the fruit that I pick up), whole wheat bread and cloves. The flavors are clear and simply excellent. Rich sweet malt flavor with a slight chocolate and vanilla hint (upfront), clearer clove and banana flavors mixed with an inviting alcohol taste at the tail end. Spiciness sticks around at the back of the mouth for a bit. Nice amount of carbonation plays well with the flavors. This is a very tasty brew but IMO dangerous as it goes down very easily but I am already feeling (empty stomach) it. Very nice brew and for the price you can not beat it.",Schneider Weisse G.

Very much colat like in head, with much snap crackly pop like noises. Thin spotty lace. The color on this beer is quite dark, almost black. A glowing unfiltered pale brown when held to light.  It smeels like a wheat wine, mollases, dark brown candy sugar, cloves, and many other spices. Its somwhat sweet with a bitter root kick at the knose.  Aromas transfering to flavor, with a root beer like taste. Spice kicks in and cloves and root dominate. Carbonations tickes the pallet all the way through. Somwhat sweet, bordering on semi-sweet root beer beer.  Interesting, not somthing I'll seek out again, but definatly good to try.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The flavors of a great smooth wheat beer  Mouthfeel- soft and delicate yet extremely complex  Drinkability- Very delicious with a 8.2 which is completely masked by its good flavor  I will tell you first off all that I am not even a fan of wheat beer but this is good.

Splendid cream colored head.  Smell- smells for all the world like a Belgian Strong Brown or Abby. Cloves, orange peel, spice and malt are all very noticeable.  Taste- *very* strong, sweet malt flavors, backed firmly with cloves and spices, and a more subtle orange flavor. Swallow is yeasty and malty, and eventually an aftertaste of oranges malt and yeast shows up.  Moutheel- briskly carbonated, this beer is heavily malted, yet fairly light in the mouth. Goes down well, but isn't as smooth on the swallow as on the mouth, and actually makes its weight felt once it hits the belly. None of this is bad, but after less than half a glass, it is giving me a full feeling.  Drinkability- I will definitely consider getting this beer again, it is a very good beer. Though it isn't a great after dinner beer, so don't make my mistake.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

I could smell the yeast, and possible some flour, but that could be a reaction to the yeast smell.  Sweet cinnamon flavor, but still tasting the yeast. It almost had the taste of a belgian yeast.  Mouthfeel was alive and crisp. It was certainly the most interesting.  Still very drinkable, but not as much as Weihenstephaner.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Sweet spice laden nose emphasizing clove and nutmeg, malty in a dry way with more carob than chocolate, nice orange citrus reduction notes, dried apple and pear fruit scents, cherry too. Medium-bodied with a great deal of agility, never once feels as if it has soaked into your palate until it has. More of that clove and anise spice, good deal of carbonation keeps any given flavor from achieving dominance. The fruit lowered in favor of wheat, half-baked bread although more banana here. Almost banana bread. The maltiness is not outsized, more textural than flavor oriented. Admirable persistence through the finish.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Hints of raisins and cocoa.  MF: Light, and very easy to drink.  D: I was going a bit faster than I should have, given the hour, but the beer lent itself to that.

72,224,BARFLYB,4.31,"500ml bottle into a sam adams imperial pint glass. Not sure of the date on this one. 1st time trying this beer.  A- A very dark red to brown color comes out of the bottle with an apparent cloudiness from being unfiltered. A huge head arises towards the top of the glass leaving a almost two finger light tan head exploding with bubbles, a very active brew no doubt. The head eventually dies down but the bubbles don't. good lacing.  S- Very powerful scents of wheat and yeast up front. Along with that some dark malts and a huge whiff of fruits.Not getting much hops from the smell Maybe some chocolate? Some spice and a bit of alcohol rounds this weizenbock out.  T- On the first few sips the wheat is ever present with a whole bunch of those dark malts. then the fruits come on including a lot of clove with some banana and vanilla. The small smell of chocolate led to an even smaller taste of it, not this beers strong quality, but if there was any more presence it would distract from this beers better qualities. The alcohol is there and grows as the temperature rises, quite warming. All of this combines into an a nice sweet weizenbock, or dopplebock, take your pick.  M- This brew has a great mf with a good amount of carbonation. Drinking this when it's just poured out of the bottle i got alot of fizz and it was present on the mouth, quite different from a lot of beers around. As the beer warms it resembles a more creamy character with the fruity characteristics sticking around.  D- Although i would like to see these in bombers i believe the 500ml is the perfect size for this beer, i could drink two. A great price for a great dopple/weizen bock. after finishing i concluded that this was in the top three for this style for sure and one of my favorites from Germany",Schneider Weisse G.

T--Delicious and complicated. Definitely a wheat beer up front, but complexities follow immediately and resonate. Exceptionally mild. Lightly spiced. Mildly floral and chocolatey. 8+ ABV doesn't translate at all...amazing.  M--Medium-bodied and creamy. Smooth and freaking delicious.  D--Again, ABV shocks me.

T: Wheat and yeast is prominent. Pungent flavor of Italian spices, with a hint of sweetness (maybe nutmeg).  M: Light and thin, but concentrated flavor. The yeast really slaps you in the face first, the pungent aftertaste remains. But a smooth consistent wheat grounds the whole thing. Finishes a bit dry.  D: Good drinkability, but this is one to sip.  Good brew. Complex flavor and nose, does have a bit of a strong alcohol taste. Really distinctive feel. This is one to sit down and enjoy.

72,224,mnj21655,4.32,"500mL bottle  Pours a murky dark ruby brown in color (though it can be as light as a dark amber depending upon the point in the glass) with about two fingers of moussy, long-lasting light tan head. Aroma is quite complex and very intriguing. There is lots of bready malt, spicy clove and vanilla phenols, lots of dark fruit esters, some banana-like esters and a touch of perfume-like (roses) alcohol. Taste is much like the aroma. Lots of bready malt, some melanoidins, and a soft wheat undertone. There may be a good bit of malt character here (both wheat and barley) but the focus is the yeast character. The dark fruit esters (think plums, prunes and maybe raisins) are a bit more restrained in the flavor than the aroma but still present. The phenols range from clove to indistinct spicyness to hints of vanilla. The esters that are a bit more prominent are those classic to weissbiers: banana with just a mere hint of bubblegum. Alcohol is again present but it again lends a pleasant flavor component without being overwhelming. Mouthfeel is pretty good, body is a bit on the light side at only medium and carbonation is moderate. Alcohol is noticeable but its presence adds to the depth of flavor and isn't at all hot or solventy. Drinkability is pretty darn good. This brew is complex but nicely balanced and fairly nuanced.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

I poured my Aventinus into a German long neck, bulb top, wheat glass. The sight is amazing. The beer actually glows in the light! Aventinus has about ten different colors and the cloudiness lets me know that this is going to be extremely flavorful.  The aroma is hard to describe. I can smell the typical double bock / weizenbock aromas but they are much more expansive in this beer. My mouth is actually watering as I smell this beer.  The flavors go from deep malt, to strong banana, to bread, and then to chocolate with a twangy wheat finish. This is a really long beer with a great look, aroma, flavor, and name. I will definately seek this one out again.  The mouthfeel is decent and fairly light considering the action packed flavor.

The lace is a little sticky on the glass, leaving spots of white foam as the glass is emptied.  A very nice smell, dominated by sweet and tart fruits - red apples. There are notes of caramel with a grainy base.  The red apples are on the flavor as well. Less sweet than the aroma. Actually quite interesting and balanced. An especially whole-wheat bready finish which cleans up the tart flavors and the gentle hop profile.  The palate is a bit thick and heavy on this beer. The carbonation is present, but the beer is chewy.  I found this to be an interesting, fairly easy to drink beer. When I poured it, I didn't really feel like drinking a whole pint, but I wanted to try this beer. After getting into it, my attitude was turned around. The heavy palate, however, made it a bit tougher to get through.  A good change of pace beer. It is a bit difficult to find where this beer will fit in. It's not a session beer, and with 0.5l bottles it's not an apéritif or an interest beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The smell is an aggressive combination of sweet malty caramel and spices that suggest a full bodied beverage is on its way. Well carbonated and spicy, the medium-full bodied mouth feel is creamy and complex...in a way that compliments the flavors nicely. The taste is a mirror of the nose and an element of cloves adds a minty complexity that lingers nicely. The 8% ABV warms gently...a real nice drinker. Recommended.",Schneider Weisse G.

A nice spiciness with semi-sweet caramel backed by some fruity esters from the yeast.  T: The initial flavor was sweet caramelized malt and wheat with ripe fruit of plums and raisins. Some fresh chocolate, bananas, and bubblegum esters are detected as well. A slight alcohol warming is felt rounding things out.  M: creamy and smooth, strongly carbonated with some alcohol warming.  D: The abv is very well hidden making this very drinkable, just don't let it catch up to you. A full spectrum of flavor, well rounded and a very nice drink all around.

T - sweet malty tones with very prominent wheat tones. This is followed by juicy esters, a small touch of hops and finishes long and acidic with an alcoholic kick.  M - full bodied, moderately carbonated. Very smooth  D - decently drinkable. High alcohol is detected but I did not find it to hinder the drinkability.  Overall - So this is the original wheat doppelbock? A very good beer made by an excellent brewery. Although I do like the eisbock more, this is definitely a must try beer.

72,224,damienblack,4.33,"Pours a dark reddish-brown, kind of like a black cherry. Billowy, pillowy head that makes sort of a plateau in the middle. Lacing is nice and bubbly, and slides right down the glass. Nose is a little weaker than I anticipated, a nose full of sweet malt and citrus fruit, as well as a hint of clove. I get a banana-ey smell, and maybe cherry or pear.  Tastes as wonderful as it looks, less sweet than I would have thought, but still full of the great citrus tastes I smelled. Slightly sweet malt on the forward pallet, and then on the second sensation, the fruit sweetness kicks in. Banana, cherry, what might be plum, all accompanied by a slick, coating mouthfeel. A little bit sticky, though. No bitterness to speak of at any stage, nor any hint of the alcohol content. There is seriously no alcohol burn at all. This is incredibly drinkable, dangerously drinkable even.

72,224,JBogan,4.13,"Pours a rather nondescript looking murky dark brown with no head or lacing to be found. Not much to look at really. After the initial pour it just looks like a flat Coca Cola.  Smells of dark fruits and a small hint of banana along with a yeastiness.  Tasted ... well let's just say I can't recall a beer ever changing character so much as it warmed. It went from prunes and figs to raisins, banana, cloves, grapes, plums, even some cinnamon...you name it. As it warmed it just sort of presented itself into a number of different flavors. Truly a schitzophrenic brew. But in a good way.  Mouthfeel was very nice. Creamier and smoother as it warmed, but with a perfect amount of stinging carbonation.  A very enjoyable, and to me, different beer. I can't really see drinking these as a session beer, it's more of a sipper and two bottles would be plenty. If you're looking for something different, give this a try. Just make sure to give it a chance to warm a bit as you go.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The smell to me was immediately of cloves and banana. I really nursed this and agree with one of the previous reviewers that the banana taste intensified as the beer warmed. The mouthfeel was smooth especially considering the high abv. For the 8.00% it was highly drinkable and would of loved to have a couple more.

It has a smooth medium body with a slick, delicate finish. It's bubbly on the tongue. The flavor fills my whole head! It is deep, syrupy, resiny and wooden. It's a touch sweet, sour and bitter.

A nice head developed on this one, tan, about 3 fingers - with pretty solid retention. Nose on this was very much noticeable, but never potent. Hints of clove, caramel malts, and spiced rum.  The flavor notes on this again were quite apparent, but not overwhelming. Brew was very creamy, lending itself to a great feel both during and after consumption. Bready malts bring in some brown sugar, slight rum soaked fruits, and some spice. Finish has some extremely slight bitterness, but nicely keep it in check.  Lovely brew, that really hits the nail on the head in many fronts. The there but not overwhelming characteristics are really a pleasure to drink.

Tons and tons of tiny bubbles keep the head going for quite some time. Lacing is spotty.  Smells like a beautiful Bavarian dream. Spicy, fruity wonder in a glass.  The flavor is top-notch, too. It's not a huge departure from basic hefes if you ask me, there's just a hint of roasted malt on top of the usual spicyness and fruity notes. A little boozy, though. But that's a good thing.

Many strands of carbonation bubbles attach to the glass at the bottom. A few yeast particles float around. Big, fluffy, off-white head that has solid staying power. Spotty lacing.  Smells mostly like a heffeweizen. Notes of bannana and a little spicy clove. Just a hint of chocolately malt in the background.  The first thing I notice in the flavor is the last thing I picked up in the smell, which is not normally the case. A sweet chocolately flavor followed immediately by notes of bannana. Following the bannana comes some more rich, mellow chocolate notes. Some sweetness and clove flavors come through at this point, alog with some bubble gum. Aftertaste is a litle bit boozy.

Hops are more spicy than bitter in the taste. Some citrus flavours and grains, again raisins, dried prunes and other dried fruit. Apricot. This beer is fruity and spicey.

The aroma was wheaty with some fruit esters. The taste had a bite up front that left a tingling at the back of the throat. It was wheat filled all the way through. It had a sweetness that turned to a slightly bitter taste. I got some bananas on the back end of the drink. It was well carbonated and was an enjoyable and tasty beverage.,Schneider Weisse G.

Smell was banana, spice, cloves, chocolate cake. Big alcohol matched by big taste and mouthfeel, substantial body, a bit of citrus wanting to come through, overall refreshing impression. The alcohol was quite well integrated to begin with but; with warming, it took on a sherry-like warmth and texture. Nice malty impressions, some bitter chocolate, all in all well balanced for a big beer. This beer is probably not for novices, I recall having it for the first time a bit over a year ago and I was a little swept away by it. This time, I appreciated the unravelling of different layers of spice, chocolate, malt and wheat that made it well worth drinking slowly, which I suppose is warranted with the large alcohol presence. I could do with another of these, highly recommended provided you don't rush it along too much.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Pours a hazy brownish amber with a fluffy white head that dissipates to a ring but with tons of carbonation drifting up from the bottom.  Aroma is very complex and sweet. There is the sweet banana sweetness of the wheat in addition to caramel malts and dark fruits and even some spices.  The taste is an even bigger version of the aroma with the caramel malts really melding well with the sweetness of the wheat - cloves and bananas especially. The alcohol burn comes through slightly in the finish.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation and sticky sweet.  This is the best weizenbock I've ever had and one of the best German beers I've tasted. Highly recommended!,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Floral hop, clove, yeast, and dried fruit are also prominent. The aromas remind me of Schneider Weisse.  Taste: tangy spice, banana, and sweet malts followed by a light hop bitterness. The spicy wheat, yeast, and fruit flavours intensify with each sip.  Mouthfeel: body is smooth and full bodied. Bittersweet middle, clean drying finish.  Drinkability: a very well-crafted beer, more enjoyable than the Original Weisse. Also a good hybrid for those who aren't over the moon about bocks.

72,224,mikeyv35,2.22,"This beer was tasted on 11/24/08, a 500ml. bottle out of a Duvel tulip glass. The beer was bottled on the 109th day of 2008. Initial appearance was a beauiful reddish-brown amber colour with a mouth watering 2 finger cream head. Unfortunately the smell and taste did not compare to the look. All I could smell was active yeast which overwhelmed any other flavours the beer might have had. The taste was the same yeast, yeast, and more yeast. I would say at least for me the beer is not very drinkable considering it was the first beer that I have poured in a long time. Not a big fan of German beer styles though, more of a Belgian guy, so I hope this brew will improve with more age.

72,224,popery,4.45,"Aventinus is great beer. It's one of my favorite German beers, although I will readily admit that I've tried way too few good German beers. However, I think that the weizenbock style is criminally under-explored. The only other weizenbock that I've had the pleasure of trying was the longshot from Sam Adams, which was delightful but is probably mostly gone at this point. With so many crappy American Oktoberfests, you would think that a few more breweries might try their hand at this largers and more interesting German style. Right now, it's almost like Aventinus is single-handedly scaring everyone else off the market. Ok, ok, I don't get Victory, High Point, Brooklyn or Clipper City beers in my neck of the woods, but you would think that a brewery West of the original thirteen colonies would make a serious go at a weizenbock. Sometimes, I wonder if California breweries have something against Germany. But I digress and this is delicious beer.  Aventinus pours with a big bubbly head, justifying the champagne glass-shape of the prescribed glassware. The settled beer is a rich amber-brown with excellent lacing. The smell is just superb. It's a spiced fruit cocktail, cinnamon sticks and nutmeg stewed with pears, apples and ripe bananas. It's close to a spiced mead without the syrupy sweetness. I appreciate the taste more than the related eisbock. The eisbock is great, but the taste of wheat wine tends to drown things out. This beer showcases a range of flavors and is, in my opinion, an extremely easy beer to like. It is a great beer to spring on the wine crowd because there is a lot of fruitiness with a superb wheat backdrop and a touch of the wine-ish qualities of the eisbock. It packs complexity and steadiness into an incredible wheat ale. Schneider must have sold his soul for the recipe to this bit of alchemy. It is a unique flavor of beer, at least to my palate, and a marvelous bit of respite from the unrelenting onslaught of pale ales and stouts. This is one of those few beers that I could drink for the rest of my life and be happy. I love Belgians and gigantic American styles, but the Germans really know how to make a beer that you could drink at any reasonable time, and, even at 8.2%, I wish I had an entire three liter stein of it. You give me three liters of Aventinus and I'm willing to be fairly lax on the issue of the propriety of the glassware. Great, great beer. Thank heaven, it's widely available these days.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,sprucetip,4.5,"From bottle into Aventinus glass.  Thick, off white head with some retention, lacing. Deep amber/medium brown with lots of bubbles rising from the bottom. Hazy with plenty of suspended yeast.  Sweet and spicy, clovey, and vaguely fruity esters. NOt overly strong at first. AS the foam settles the sweet malty base shines through more clearly. Later in the sample the alcohol is more prominent.  Sweet malt and characteristic Bavarian yeast strain hit first and in balance. Clovey spiciness, mile alcohol, bubble gum and vague fruity flavors and complexity. Not really getting banana specifically. Some dryness in the finish becomes more notable as the sample warms.  Well carbonated, full bodied with slight warming sensation. Creamy texture on the inside of the mouth is pleasing. Some dryness in the finish later in the sample.  Drinkable? Are you kidding? For a big boy of 8.2%, it is extremely drinkable. Not that it isn't filling.  I love this beer. It is one of the world's greats.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

M- Has an almost syrupy consistency that kind of coats the toung.  D- Not a beer that I would drink too many of. One, maybe two.

M-Syrupy, which coats the tongue...  D-If not for the relatively high ABV, it would be highly drinkable...  Great beer, which met if not surpassed my expectations.

It tasted like prune malt and sour wild yeast with lemon and salty hops. It was watery with lots of carbonation, and had a sour aftertaste. Overall this was much more Belgian and less dark (lacking malt) than I expected. It was clean and drinkable, but didn't have a flavor that I particularly enjoy.

72,224,CrellMoset,4.42,"On tap at Beer Run, Charlottesville, VA. Served in a 10 oz. snifter.  Appearance: A dark, hazy, muddy beer with slow-moving but ample carbonation that creeps up around the edges of the glass to contribute initially to the one-finger of white, frothy head and then to the ring of puffy lace left in its wake. Lacing is glittery, runny, slick, likely slightly alcohol retarded,  Aroma: Deep, roasted maltiness - sweet, with flourishes of brown sugar and honey - and lots of fruity notes that run the gamut from pear, dates all the way to dark raisins, figs. As things warm, a sharp alcohol note emerges, lending that definite rum raisin edge to things.  Taste: Similar to the nose, and that's a good thing. A definite banana/spice edge added by the yeast, which themselves also impart a few other earthy, funky flavors, but all in a wonderful balance with the fruity notes and malt overtones mentioned above. There's also a few light, fluffy wheat notes that actually help lighten the mouthfeel a little. A warming, lightly-spicy alcohol in the finish rounds things off.  Mouthfeel: Big and fluffy, but wonderfully even and smooth. A little crisp carbonation adds a wonderful element.  Drinkability: Better out of the bottle, I think. The flavors just seemed a little less vibrant here. Nonetheless, it's still a fantastic beer, flavorful, aromatic, attractive, creamy, and a definite winner.",Schneider Weisse G.

Some spices, the dark fruits, the wheat, everything comes into play creating a complex, but not too strong or overpowering beer.

Drinkability: I don't know if its a great idea to have a few of these..it has a relatively high ABV, along with a body and taste that doesn't reflect that. Its easy to have a couple.

Firm pour yielded one finger of pure brilliant white head, that contrasts dramatically with the Starbucks brown body. Head fades quickly and leaves minimal lace.  Nose- slightly burnt nuttiness, caramel, notes of coffee.  Palate- Interesting, not what I was expecting. Almost porter-esque. Some dark fruit, dates, raisins, plums. As it warms it really develops. Chewy raisin. Some elements of a Belgian Quad. Dates, Alcohol. Very smooth and clean. I enjoy how some elements of a heffe come through initially, and are followed by light caramels and brooding dark fruits. Complex, each sip seems a little different.  Mouthfeel- Slick, smooth and clean.  Drinkability- Very good. Probably could not have more then 2.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,WYVYRN527,4.58,"I've never been a huge fan of wheat beers until I Tried this one. The Aventinus pours a rich, syrupy brown with an aggresive head that rapidly dissapates. The aroma is all malt. Sweet with hints of toffee and carmel. This beer coats the palate upon the first sip. Flavors of carmel, dates, and malt are first noticed, followed by a slight dry finish. I found it to be quite easy to drink, despite it's ABV and viscosity. Aventinus is the best wheat beer I have ever had, and one of the best German brews I have tasted in my life.",Schneider Weisse G.

Tasted of vanilla, cocoa beans, spices and some alcohol, very complex. The mouthfeels was pleasant, pretty smooth, creamy and a little carbonation on the tongue.

72,224,Offa,4.82,"This is a very interesting, very enjoyable beer which I loved, although I was not sure what to expect.  Deep, murky brown with a little reddish-ochre hue to it, this has a big, dense, light tan head that slowly shrinks to a foamy ring and leaves a little weak lace.  The aroms is fruit - banana and stewed and spiced plums and pears, with a hint of burnt/caramelized pumpkin, bubblegum, whole wheat bread. It's very aromatic yet light and complex, with a definite hefeweizen element but also a stronger, bock-like quality, which seems logical.  The taste is highly interesting, lively and complex, which was what hit me before any specific flavours did. It is light, yet strongly flavoured, zesty, lively. It has a lto of fruit, spice, apple, 7-up, whole wheat bread, a hint root beer and a hint of rum - with alcohol evident but restrained and smooth. SUpposedly it's has some choclate, but I did not really get that. It does not taste its strength. it is highly drinkable and engaging.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BirdFlu,4.47,"Served on top at the Blind Tiger, NYC  The draught board at BT listed this as a doppelbock, so being that I was unfamiliar with the drink (and that I am particularly keen on doppelbocks) I was fairly surprised when I recieved it at the lightness in color as well as the somewhat-subdued flavor. I knew then that this was probably not a doppelbock and I checked BA to confirm it was a weizen... ANYWAY, once I'd adjusted to the beer's true identity I was ready for it and enjoyed it quite a lot. It smells like rootbeer and looks like it too.. Tastes sweet and a bit like caramel but very smooth, the sweetness is subdues and not so upfront. Mouth is on the lighter side of moderate. Highly carbonated. Very easy to drink and delicious as well.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,TheycallmeTim,4.54,"Poured from a 500 ml Euro bottle into an Aventinus glass.  A--Pours a deep raisiny brown body with plenty of fizzy white head, about two and a half fingers. Cap dissipated quickly and didn't leave much behind, but the bottom of the glass funnelled bubbles to the surface for the entire tasting.  S--Oh dear God does this smell heavenly. Real sock of old tropical fruit, real deep brown banana, mellowed by a touch of vanilla. I detected less clove and more sweet maraschino cherry and yeast, with an almost palpable wheat and banana aroma.  T--Follows the nose faithfully with some added complexity, especially on the back end, which has a raisin and malt character to it that I really enjoy. This thickens and creeps into the middle of the palate as the beer warms and the esters recede a bit. A full, satisfying taste spectrum that I could actually see pairing well with brown sauces and heavier, winter meat dishes. Anyone down for braising pork jowls for six hours with me?  M&D--More bread-like than any other wheat beer I've had, and so pretty chewy, which I actually like. Carbonation is active without stinging, and the ABV doesn't really come through until the end and the beer has warmed considerably. This is kind of a sock to the jaw after one, so not the most drinkable. More worth savoring than swigging.  One of my favorite beers, hands down. I like this beer the first time I tasted it so damn much I immediately went out and bought the attendant glass to it. Superior product--masterful!",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,Bobo77,4.82,"""Germany's original Wheat-Doppelbock Ale"" on the label. I used to think that bock implied lager, but now I know otherwise. I have heard wonderful things about this beer and so I am curious; it's supposed to be the ultimate in wheat beers. We shall see if it lives up to this claim.  Look - Poured into a weizen glass a cloudy brown, maple syrup like color. Thick off white head as is typical for wheat beers.  Nose - The scent of clove is very intense. Bananna goodness is there as well. Deep chocolate sweetness...alcohol is their but doesn't completely dominate the situation.  Taste - This is the clove and bananna bomb to end all clove and bananna bombs! Next I'm blasted by a rich maltiness that I have not noticed in wheat beers before. Chocolate is here but it is balanced by bitterness of hops, alcohol, and clove spiciness. I can see also why some say that this tastes like bubblegum; there is a definite bubblegum flavor there but it is not bad at all. I like to think of it as chocolate covered bananna. To sum this all up it as though there is a war being waged between wheat, malt, and yeast that created a symphony of complex goodness that rivals Wagner's Flight of the Valkyries. If I haven't sung the praises of this enough I will say that this beer has done the unthinkable and combined my two favorite types of beer: wheat and doppelbock. Very nice tasting and something that I will be returning to.  All of this being said I can see why some beer drinker's might not care for it much. If there is a beer spectrum that stretches from hoppy on end (IPA) to malty on the other, Aventinus would be representative of the malty side...so hopheads beware.  As I sip further I am starting to feel the warming effects of the relatively high, 8.2%, alcohol. This will be a nice beer to bring to my family's Xmas gathering to keep warm and to endure their idiotic banter.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Cloves, raisons, and other spices all come together to make one rocking party!  Mouth Feel: Gave that baby a swirl and it's nice and creamy. Medium viscosity.  Smell: Cloves and Banana are defiantly right there. It just smells nice and starchy, obviously from the wheat.  Look: Popped this baby into the one and only Aventinus glass. Seriously its my favorite glass in the world! Pretty looking beer but the color was not what I was expecting. More apple cider looking then I expected.  Drink: For such a unique style this brew is DRINK-A-BLE, friendly and inviting. Have one of your friends taste one of these and watch them enter a new beer dimension; especially those who don't drink dark beers.  Notes: I forgot how special this beer is. Bored of all the wheats - the hefeweizens the wits - as well as the bocks, but pop the two together, SYMPHONY! Really this is the best blend of two styles I've ever had. Lately there seems to be an attempt to do the same with barlywines, called wheatwines, not as high caliber as this baby.

A - Pours a dark and cloudy brownish-red with an impressive off-white head that gradually dissipates into a thin layer of suds. Lacing is moderate.  S - Banana, clove, orange, dark fruit, and just a hint of alcohol.  T - Unbelievably complex. Dark fruit comes out the strongest, with some banana and spice coming through as well. The phenolic tones I caught in the nose are completely absent on the palate, which is fine by me.  M - Medium bodied, semi-dry finish. A hint of fruity sweetness lingers on the palate for just a moment, begging you to take another sip.  D - This one is as drinkable as any good dunkelweizen, despite the higher alcohol content. A finer wheat beer could not be asked for.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Finkel,4.32,"At first glance, it can be said that it has the exact tone of apple cider. The head is extremely uniform, sticking together to create a thin but consistent layer on the surface. Also, it has to be noted that there is a coat of yeast on the bottom as well as very tiny chunks floating around in the beer, something typical for a bottle fermenting beer.  The smell is good and has an array of flavors; it's obvious that this is a very complex drink. A starchy plantain scent is identifiable but everything else is as hazy as the color of the beer to me.  The creamy texture held my tongue a prisoner - and I had no issues with that. Caramel, fruits (citrus and a hint of grapes), cloves, and the wheat found in Belgian styles turned slid into my stomach with glee. And to top it off, although it's not that heavy, it's weighted and it definitely hits you where you want it to.  Overall, this beer was really good. The taste is extremely unwavering, which makes this a very approachable drink for almost anyone. Most importantly, it's not extreme in any sense of the word.",Schneider Weisse G.

S- Smell of wheat and fruit were the first thing that came to mind.  T- The taste was a little to variable for me. At first the fruit and wheat were prevalent, but just when you thought the sweetness would settle on your tongue, the carbonation killed it. The fruit taste really came out mid-drink when the carbonation settled.  M- Medium-bodied and almost tasted like soda at first with all the carbonation.  D- At 8.2% abv, this beer is extremely drinkable, the alcohol is very well hidden.  Overall, a very nice beer that I wish had a little less carbonation. As I said before, the more you let the carbonation settle, the more the fruit and flavor are prolonged when consumed.

Some fruity tartness is there; perhaps cranberries or cherries.  The flavor is complex and hard to pin down, seeming to change subtly between sips. The advertised cloves and banana did not arise until mid drink, but the whole time there was tart fruit; some times cranberry, other times raspberry. A welcome malty sweetness appeared here and there.  The beer is somewhat thick but very wet, and carbonated almost like a soda. Very refreshing and highly drinkable.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,koopa,4.2,"Limited Edition Brewed in 2003, bottled in 2004, and consumed today. Bottle wrapped in white tissue paper with ""brewed in 2003"" print all over it.  Appearance: Dark brown, borderline black body with a good 2 finger head that is the slightest shade of almond. Decent head retention and some lacing which is impressive for a 5 year old brew.  Smell: Wheat, Clove, Dark Roasted Malts  Taste: Your standard wheat / clove / toasted malt Aventinus with an additional slightly vinous note. The vinous quality is quite minimal at this point and perfect in my opinion. Its also counterbalanced by a taste of chocolate.  Mouthfeel: full bodied yet thin. Ample carbonation.  Drinkability: Much more drinkable than a fresh Aventinus in my humble opinion. The wine/chocolate flavors that become more pronounced with age are creating a playful complexity that the fresh Aventinus lacks.  I'm thinking that 5 years of aging this brew is ideal for my tastes.

The balance between soft and sour is perfect.  D: It doesn't get much better than this. At 8%abv, it may be tricky as a session brew- guess it depends on the person. This is one smooth doppel that will seriously grow on you.  Also, this beer greatly benefits from its official glassware (pilsner with a rounded top).

Handsome, purple-and-gold labeled 500 ml bottle swaddled in purple-printed white paper and a purple cordon, poured into a weizen glass yields a hazy brown-copper body alive with rivulets of active carbonation supporting a fat three-finger crown of dense pale tan foam with big rocky bubbles on top. There is quite a bit of chunky sediment in suspension, and the head settles very slowly, leaving short-lived webby lacing on the glass.  From the get-go, this beer smells great! Toasty wheat, banana and clove, as one might expect, lead the way, but the nice surprise is a rich winey chocolate element that really stands out.  The taste is very similar to the smell, with rich layers of caramel and chocolate, ripe red apple sweetness and a somewhat nutty finish. A bit of earthy dryness goes to work in the aftertaste, trying to get a handle on the sticky banana-infused malty syrup that clings to the palate.

This looks like the muck that baby alligators slither through as they grow into subterranean monsters beneath the city. Head retention is disappointing, but expected due to the high ABV. Swirling whips up some thick creamy lace that slides back down into the small pillowy head.  S - Chocolate cake, tootsie rolls, prune juice, ripe plums, dates, and raisins. Damn that's complex! I'm smelling something new every time I stick my nose in the glass. Initially the aromas are dark fruit and sweet chocolate, then a citrus and tropical fruit freshness from the wheat really livens things up! Melon and fruity chewing gum (tropical fruit Bubba Yum) notes are there too.  T - Rich dark fruit and dried tropical fruits. Dates, raisins, and prunes make up the dark side of the beer (the Mr Hyde, if you will) and the dried apricots and tropical mango flavors bring out something sunny and entirely new (the nice friendly Dr. Jekyll). Outstanding balance and depth of flavor, with a hearty alcohol kick at the end. Wow.  M - Full bodied with very silky and understated carbonation. Some sugar is left on the palate, but is quickly bitch-slapped by a wall of booze that leaves the mouth slightly dry and warm. The finish goes on for days, with lingering dark fruit again...transitioning from dark-to light- to dark again at the finish.  D - Ridiculously good beer.

72,224,captnamerca,3.9,"Sept. 9, 2008. Poured from bottle into glass.  Appearance - Very cloudy reddish-brown. Small head, disappears almost immediately. Lots of activity beneath the surface.  Smell - Strong wheat-beer smell. Fruity aroma. Alcohol detected.  Taste - Smooth. No strong alcohol taste up front, slightly heavy on the finish. Definitely tasting the ""Bock"". Not a light refreshment like a Hefeweizen. Very enjoyable though.  Mouthfeel - Coats the tongue. Lasting alcohol on the breath. Not unpleasant yet.  Drinkability - Very enjoyable as a sipping beer. Not unlike a stout in that way. I can really feel it though. The 8.2% is immediately evident.  Overall - I like it. I have enjoyed a lot of Schneider beers before. Would drink again. I would really consider aging this a bit to see if that would take the edge off the alcohol.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,phantomwyse,4.1,A: Pours a more red than amber reddish amber. Head reminds me of hydrogen peroxide -- its builds fast and furious and then recedes quickly with lots of popping sounds.  S: Clean wheat smell followed by a banana esters and a buttery sugary sweetness.  T: Alcohol crispness at first with a bitter banana not too far behind. Some phenolic characters with a dry hay taste at the end.  M: Thinish. Crisp and clean.  D: Not an everyday beer.,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,DavidSeanNJ,4.7,"This has already become my favorite weizenbock to date. Finally decided to review it.  Oh yeah, at $3.50 per bottle, how could you go wrong. This is a world class beer.  A- Beautiful deep mahogony. Looks like the color of a black cherry soda, but a little darker. Tan head. Lacing? Yeah sure, there is some.  S- Spices. Mainly cloves, cinnamon, and corriander.  T- That classic wheat taste is there for sure. Banana and orange peel flavors are strong. Cloves are abundant. Fruity at times and spicy at others. Alcohol is evident with every sip.  M- This is a really chewy weizenbock. Syrupy but not in a bad way. Went down rather smoothly.  D- A most enjoyable here too. I can taste the history as I drink it. Nothing sessionable at all about this beer but man it is tasty. A real gem.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Zadok,4.37,"Poured a deep oak brown with slight amber highlights. One finger slightly off white head that dissipated rather quickly.  Smells like a hefe, coriander, banana, clove. A little sweet malt also present.  Initial flavor reminds me of a banana milkshake. Has spices of a wide variety, clove, pepper, and coriander. Slight alcohol presence but nothing overpowering.  Very smooth mouthfeel with light carbonation. A small bite of pepper in the aftertaste.  Quite surprised I have never tried this one, have to say its delicious. Definitely deserving of all the praise. Will be looking forward to the next offering.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Wetpaperbag,3.95,"A- Brown with a touch of red, with a thick foamy head. This is definitely a wheat beer.  S- Dark fruits, cherry, dates, figs, etc. come though in the smell. I'm also smelling some dark leaf tobacco. The smell reminded me of Red Man Honey chew. Very unique.  T- Cherry and clove are very present. That tobacco smell didn't transfer into the taste, I'm kinda glad. This is a very sweet beer. Much sweeter then other Weizenbocks I've had. This has some nice malt character. Not too bad.  M- Thick and oily. Plus the carbination can be a bit much if you move the beer around in your mouth too much. That can lead to a mouth full of foam.  D- Easy to drink, but is on the sweeter side of things.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,PatronWizard,4.06,"A wheat doppelbock, huh? Never had one'a dem before. 500ml to me glass...  Dark but lighter than other doppels I've had. Burgandy brown. Big bubbled head wells up and dies rather quickly.  Great scent. Really fruity. Cloves.  Plums. I taste plums. Delightfully fruity. I've had fruit taste ruin a beer for me before but this is a very pleasant fruit taste. Nicely done.  Thick, almost syrupy, but the carbonation counteracts the thickness in a good way. I like.  Aside from all else - Daddy loves 8.2%, he does.  Overall: all around good stuff, worth a try",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,SIRIUS2,4.21,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a very dark brown with the slightest tint of red in the light. A fantastic 3 fingers worth of rocky white head that has some real staying power, but eventually settles down to about half the original depth. Decent lacing.  Aromas are interesting; complex and a little hard to pin down. Deep caramel malts, a little bit of fresh bread, a bit of that bubble gum typical of wheat, and something just a touch spicy. Nothing really stands out on its own though, it is all just a nicely played olfactory symphony. Very nice.  Flavors are just about as complex and even as the aromas, but not quite the same. The malty sweetness comes through nicely but is relatively balanced, just hinting toward that sweetness. The wheat is present but doesn't take over the palate, rather it blends nicely with the other complexities. For a darker brew I expected more of a coffee or mocha flavor but didn't really experience that. The finish begins malty but quickly evaporates, with a slight warmth that lingers.  Textures are wonderful. Slightly creamy, moderate fine carbonation, smooth drinking. If it wasn't for that slight alcohol flavor coming through I would have given it a perfect score.  Fantastic drinkability, just a bit heavy on the warmth. I love the ABV I just don't like the raw taste of alcohol. This isn't bad at all, but there is enough there that it wasn't perfect for my taste. However, it was still very good and I highly recommend it for the style.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,marcpal,4.52,"This style is tremendous and seems a crime that I havent yet tasted this one.  500 ml poured into a thick pint glass.  A: Mahogany oaken brown with a thin root beer head. Consistent bubbling and beautiful.  N: Yeasty and banana flavors. Right on point for the style. Wheat, cloves and dried fruit.  T: Resoundingly sweet, some alcohol burn and caramel/maple syrup. Hints of butterscotch with tons of raisins and dates. Sweeter as it warmed with the figs coming through- expected to have fig seeds in my teeth. As do the malts in general.  M: Thick, creamy and textbook for the word 'chewy'. Such a full body loaded with character.  D: Loved each and every sip of the half liter. After really enjoying this style, I see this one being perfect in all descriptors but still like the Brooklyn version a bit more solely on the basis of my hop favoritism.  This one is a must try for a weizenbock fan. Well made. Those freaking Germans. Danke.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,ThreeWiseMen,3.98,"Appearance: Hazy mahogany with super-creamy head. Looks chunky.  Smell: Figs, raisin bread, alcohol, bananas, and some spicy notes.  Taste: Dark fruits (figs, raisins, plums too?), big malt, banana, alcohol, cinnamon and other spices. Alcohol is quite apparent, but melds well with the other flavors. Overall taste is complex yet smooth.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, chewy, and pretty smooth. A much lighter body than expected upon pouring. A little bite results from the spiciness.  Drinkability: Complexity and ease give this one a high drinkability. Watch out for the ABV, but other than that, drink up!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,terryeckmeier,3.5,"I picked this one up with a bunch of Weissbier. I admit it was my fault for not reading the lable and I assumed it was going to be like the other but I was wrong. To be honest I didn't really enjoy this beer all that much the flavours were just to intense for me and I found that each drink of the glass was just to much information for my taste buds to process. Also I think the higher alcohol content may be why I didn't enjoy it as much.  Pour into a glass. Really interesting dark colour, found that it had a thicker feeling in the mouth but not creamy. I wouldn't buy again for a few years until I can train my self on Dopplebock.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,GilGarp,4.52,"The 5th person to review this one today, I somehow feel connected to these people in a deep and unfamiliar way.  Poured from a 500ml bottle into a curvy sam adams glass. It has the color of tea - medium dark brown, great clarity, frothy white head. The head is gone quickly and leaves no lace behind.  Aroma is sweet and fruity. It reminds me of a belgian dubbel as there seems to be bananas and brown sugar.  Flavor is outstanding and complex. At first it continues down the dubbel trail until intense spiciness kicks in. There's clove, cinnamon, and orange peel in there. Very stong flavors but all getting along with each other. Very unique.  Mouthfeel is fine and only let down by high carbonation and alcohol. The same could be said for drinkability.  This beer has a lot going on. It's like nothing else I've ever tasted.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,SaucyA,4.13,"A - Pours a dark caramel brown into an Aventinus glass. 2 finger, khaki head. Quite a good looking brew.  S - Banana's! Yeasty, wheaty. Nothing too descript but conversely, nothing out of place.  T - Alcohol heat, banana, caramel/molassesy malt... utterly tasty. I'm admittedly not the biggest Weizenbock fan, but this one is a keeper.  M - Creamy, big, bold... not a ton of carbonation, but just enough to keep this in check. Could be construed as chewy.  D - One is fine for me, but I could see how a fan of the style would really love it. I'm not terribly into Weizenbocks and this is fantastic.  Notes: For the price, and the flavor, this is a homerun. A good beer all around, and no fridge is complete without one. More than worth a taste... worth two tastes :)",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,TKempe,4.32,"Dark brown to ruby red in color, with a tremendous size head like I have never seen in previous encounters with this beer, and carbonation that is extremely lively and noisy.  A thick and sweet (almost sugar-like) smell, accomponied by some hops and yeast, a well placed, slightly sour and grainy accent on the wheat and some dryish, salty malt presence. Great!  The taste accentuates the sweetnes just a little more, almost to the extent that is becomes cloying and sticky, but also elaborates on it, to the extent that is becomes fruity (rose hip). Wheat is present throughout the whole taste. Finish is slightly bitter and gives exposure to some chocolate or maybe liquorice notes. This bottle tastes sweeter than other (probably older) ones I have had, but it is still great without a doubt.  Body is thick and chewy, carbonation level medium. Alcohol very apparent to both body and mind.  If you like the Hefeweisse by Schneider and can appreciate a sipping beer, you will like Aventinus for sure.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,TheMistler,4.15,"A bottle poured into a weizen glass. My goodness, there is all sorts of carbonation springing up along the sides of this hazy mocha brown concoction. A bit off white, there is a lot of springy, barely lacy head. Oh, and - best part! - the head has a clear Rice Crispies, ""Snap Crackle Pop"" quality to it, with lots o' pleasant noise.  Oh, whew, what a nose. Caramelly banana, but surprisingly light in the aroma department. I wouldn't say crisp... but certainly not too heavy. Some grains and dark fruits intermingle in the nose as well.  This is beer. That statement is ridiculously obvious, but with the assortment of aftertastes to be had with crafts, it is somewhat nice to have an ale that just has a clear ""beer"" component to its finish. (And I realize that this is only to my suiting, but c'est la vie.) A touch of hops - and a bit of a tang of alcohol from the ABV - follow a classic weizen-bock taste of banana and molasses and a hint of clove.  A very drinkable ale for those that can handle a bit of flavor and spice, although it is certainly not a session beer.  Definitely the most substantive of weizen-bocks I have had, including the Clipper City Hang Ten (a personal favorite). I don't think I like it as much as its BeerAdvocate rating might say I ""should,"" but it is very good.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,PiecefulToker,4.57,"500mL bottle.  A: Pours a dark hazy mahogany/chestnut brown with a thick frothy head that sticks around. I got some decent sized floaties, but not a big deal.  S: Sweet caramel, wheat, almost like cream of wheat with molasses or brown sugar. Nice subtle banana aromas.  T&M: Very smooth across my tongue with perfect carbonation that slightly nips my tongue. Nice caramel and almost burnt sugar flavors with a slight sweetness. Some dried fruit and raisin flavors, figs. Significant amounts of banana, but not too much. Finishes with a great texture and some diacetyl butter on the back of my tongue and some alcohol. Thirst quenching, but hearty, full-bodied, creamy and smooth. This beer is perfect.  D: Pretty high. I could drink at least 3 of these on a sitting.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Thunderball,3.68,"Poured into a pilsner glass. The amber brown liquid produced a nice tight head. The smell of malt and mature fruit is the first introduction to this brew. Smells sweeter than the taste which has some spice and yeast/malt bread like quality. Now the strange part, I detect a char grill on the finish. I'm not so sure I'm crazy about this one.

Pours a dark amber color with a nice beige/white head.  The smell is really nice of peppercakes, spices, some hops and a light tone of matured bananas.  The taste is pretty similar to the smell, but it tastes even more than it smells. Very sweet, but a bitterness that balances it, feels warming in the stomach.  Great beer, I will surely have a few of these this autumn/winter!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Hazy color of dark honey. Nice!  S - Definitely a wheat beer in aroma. Tons of dark fruits I can't put my finger on. Banana and clove present, and yeastiness as well. Complex and just great.  T - Very sweet taste. Esters, clove, and light caramel. Stings the tongue a bit. Sweet, long lasting aftertaste. Really enjoyable. I wish I could say more, but I can't pick out all the nuances of this beer.  M - Medium to full body with medium carbonation. Tingly sensations, and the mouthfeel of light syrup.  D - Definitely a sipper. One to be enjoyed.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,ryrust5301,4.45,"Appearance - Dark brown and somewhat similar to a doppelbock. Transparent when held up to light. What makes this beer is the enormous head, which came to the size of a fist and is off white in color. At the top the head even muffined over the lip of the glass and ran down the side a bit.  Smell - Sweet fruits and caramel notes. Extremely smooth but spicy as well.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Creamy and full bodied, with a mild carbonation. Very smooth and sweet taste lays down the base for this beer. Plenty of dark fruit and caramel malt to match the nose, as well as a spicy bread taste. The thing that steals the show in this one is the back end. The creaminess in the back seems to last forever and really gives it a signature.  Drinkability - It's been a while since i've had one of these, and it's just as good as I remember. As said before, the alcohol is invisible for an 8%.",Schneider Weisse G.

The appearance, something I don't often spend a lot of time on, is a gorgeous, dark, cloudy ruby-brown. Unbelievable.  The smell... what can I say? The long-tweaked work of some brilliant brewmasters. These people should be really proud of what they have accomplished.  Taste? I don't need to say anything here. It's absolutely superb.  Mouthfeel - smooth as silk. Makes you giddy it's so smooth.  Drink - This could be dangerous, given the ABV. The alcohol is superbly masked.

There's also some raisins, caramel and malts in there. It's big, bold and beautiful.

72,224,UGADawgGuy,5,"Before you try Aventinus, you must know that there are BIG differences between fresh Aventinus and vintage bottles from the brewery. I'm reviewing both here, but my ratings pertain to vintage Aventinus. In my experience, a 4- to 5-year-old bottle is among the top 2 or 3 beers available today, while a fresh bottle is in the top 10. As such, a 5-year-old bottle gets a perfect 5.0, while a fresh bottle is about a 4.7 or a 4.8.  AFTER 5 years, Aventinus starts to break down. A 6-year-old bottle might rate a 4.0 or worse, so bear that in mind and aim for 4 or 5 years of age.  Appearance -- (Recent vintage) After a solid ""weissbier pour"" from a 500-mL bottle into my Aventinus glass (which is quite distinctive), I examine the beer from head to foot. This stuff serves up a whopping four-plus fingers of creamy, firm, off-white head, which lingers for over two minutes before settling into a quarter-inch cap for the remainder of my drink. Solid lacing leaves evidence of each sip. The body of the beer -- and this may be partly due to the glass -- fades from a deep, rich blackish-purplish-brown at the top to a deep amber at the bottom. Even from a ""fresh"" bottle, there are visible chunks of sediment floating in the beer.  (Five-year-old vintage) Similar pour, same glass. Two to three fingers of off-white head, which recede within about a minute and leave only a filmy cap. Lacing is minimal. Vintage Aventinus is marginally more brown than the fresh stuff, but man, it still looks great in the glass. Of considerable note, the yeast becomes much less chunky with age, blending with the body of the beer much as the flavors coalesce over time.  Smell -- (Recent vintage) Well, this is a wheat beer, but it smells like something altogether unique. Then again, if you don't like wheat beers, you may not like this one, either. I smell dried fruits (e.g., raisins, dates), honey, and the faintest metallic twinge. Oddly, this is somehow compelling, rather than off-putting.  (Five-year-old vintage) With age, the aroma sweetens and warms, and the metallic note disappears. Dried-fruit odors still dominate, but a wholesome wheatiness ties it all together. Scents of toffee and burnt caramel are also apparent...there's a lot going on here, but it all makes sense after a few whiffs. Stunning.  Taste -- (Recent vintage) Truly hard to describe. This is the ""biggest"" wheat beer out there, in my experience -- with the noted exception of Aventinus Eisbock. Sure, you'll detect some of that signature weissbier breadiness, but this beer is about more than that. I pick up brown sugar, dates, raisins, burnt caramel, and a heavy dose of malt. There's also a toasted-grain quality to this beer that I've never tasted elsewhere. Again, totally unique.  (Five-year-old vintage) Still huge, and still completely unique. The appearance/smell/taste/mouthfeel experience is the most integrated beer-drinking experience you're likely to find. The flavors listed above are the main attraction, but with age, they merge to form a strikingly unusual whole. Sweet, savory, fruity, malty, and earthy all at once. A masterpiece.  Mouthfeel -- (Recent vintage) As an avid wheat beer drinker, I find this one to be heavier and thicker in the mouth than most. The sediment in this one really is chunkier than that of a standard hefeweizen, and you'll feel it going down. Honestly, this is a mild drawback for me; I'd prefer the yeast to distribute itself more evenly throughout the glass. The sediment in a glass of fresh Aventinus is akin to what you might find in a particularly ""dirty"" Belgian abbey ale.  (Five-year-old vintage) The formerly chunky sediment is now an integral component of the beer's body. This elevates the mouthfeel to something uniquely sublime...think ""thick chocolate milk,"" but with malty, yeasty, mildly carbonated alcohol. Coats the throat, to great effect.  Drinkability -- (Recent vintage) This is where the vintage stuff really shines, by comparison. A fresh bottle of Aventinus is some appreciably potent stuff, especially for a wheat beer. Between the the big taste, the big mouthfeel, the chunky sediment, and the relatively high ABV (by wheat beer standards), one bottle of this is probably enough for one sitting. But it does leave you wanting more -- this is a beer you'll think about for days after you drink it, identifying subtleties you couldn't quite place while drinking it.  (Five-year-old vintage) Whatever alcohol heat you feel in a fresh bottle has faded into the background with a few years of aging. I still don't think I could put away more than a half-liter of this in one sitting, simply because it's so rich. Drinking more than one bottle would be like eating half a cheesecake -- albeit a delicious, potentially life-altering cheesecake.  Aventinus is a truly unique beer, and required drinking for any fan of wheat beers. In fact, it's strongly recommended for ANY beer drinker.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,sevopie,4.28,"Appearance - Coffee-like color, and you can see the sediment inside, only adding to the coffee appearance. Toffee-colored head.  Smell - Wheat smell dominates with a heavy sugary fruit smell to it; plums, apples, and figs.  Taste - Wheat again dominates with fruits laced with alcohol taste. Raisins seems to come out more in the taste, with a hint of apple. Also has a subtle brown sugar flavor.  Mouthfeel - Sediment adds another interesting level to the mouthfeel. Lighter for a weizen, with a heavy dose of carbonation.  Drinkability - Goes down easy, but doesn't hide the 8% as well as I might have hoped. Still a delicious brew.",Schneider Weisse G.

The Aventinus pours with little carbonation and a very slight head. It has a beautiful cloudy mahogany coloring. I would say it looks ""dirty-red""  A yeasty smell rises up from this beer with aromas of cherry, honey and apple cider.  There are major flavors of apple and honey in this beer. Also, a slighly bitter aftertaste arises, yet is is nice, like a licorice almost.  It feels fizzy and frothy. Definately a heady drink, full of body. Packs almost too much of a punch.  I love the angle here, but there is something going on with the aftertaste.

Again, no diacetyl, or DMS. No perceived bitterness. Very clean. No significant lingering flavors.  Mouthfeel - light to medium body. Medium to heavy carbonation. The alcohol is subdued. No perceived bitterness.  Overall Impression - This is a good beer, and a wonderful example of the Weizenbock style. This is a very drinkable beer, but is complex enough that you can drink it slowly, and enjoy its aromas and flavor. This makes it a good choice for many different situations.

It poured a dark but brilliant mahogany color into a weizen glass. Lots of head with great staying power. Aroma is clovey with a significant malt presence and quite pleasant. Flavor is clovey, fruity, with some bock-like maltiness. It is a substantial beer, but is not heavy and hides its ABV quite well. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. If you're looking for a 8.2% ABV that will go down great on a hot day, this is it.  Seriously, I don't know where Cafe Brucke gets their import beers, but they always look to be in mint condition. If I bought this beer from Discount Liquor across town, it would be old, stale, and the bottle/label would be dust-covered and beat to hell.  I would highly recommend this beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,JRed,4.15,"An appearance of a bubbling, shadowy sea of dark amber topped by marshmallow head. An aroma of caramelized plums, spice, and strangely...ketchup. A delicacy indeed! Initial grape tag team with dark malt (but no roast) slight booze, banana, vanilla extract, and mild spice. And this is a handicapped match; they are kicking my ass. Medium bodied with a slick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This brew has character and flavor worthy of defining a genre. Another beer of the gods with flavor that hits every area of the tongue making it hard to place which taste you like most. I'll take em all with a big grin that I can't wipe off my face.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,MrMonkey,4.17,"On tap @ Jacob Wirths in Boston before the Redsox game.  Pours a murky, icetea looking brown with a two-finger off-white head that fades slowly, but leaves no lacing.  Smells like bubblegum, clove, banana, and wheat bread.  Taste starts off with some well-carbonated cola and bubblegum flavors before some wheat and clove. Finishes semi-sweet with some banana notes and more spice.  Medium-bodied, and very smooth.  Good drinkability, but the ABV limits it just a bit, especially on a hot day. Otherwise, very enjoyable! A great beer!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The nose contains some yet unidentifiable spice notes with a hint of red grapes and toasted malt  Starts with a light, somewhat fruitiness and the feel is quite remarkable. Fuller than I expected with the carbonation lingering on the tongue for an extended period.  The finish is much richer with toasted malt, spice and fruit notes.  I am not really familiar with Wiezenbock but I may have just had one of the best of the style I am likely to have. Try it if you get the chance.",Schneider Weisse G.

The body is a nice brown with ample yeast sediment.  S- Very nice clove banana maltiness with just a suggestion of light alcohol leading me to believe that this is going to be a large beer. Deep down I detect a fresh green apple with a light pepperiness. Nice.  T- Initial thought is that the alcohol is well hidden but does have a nice warming on the way down. I get notes of banana, clove, a touch of cocoa, with a finish on the sweet side. Banana split kind of comes to mind here. After a very long.. sweet finish I gather some very intense pepper which I enjoy thoroughly.  M- Mouthfeel is big warming with just a nice scrubbing bubbles of light carbonation. The finish is nice.  D- Other than the warming, the alcohol is hidden well. I wouldn't call it sessionable but I could see this linking up very well with some German food. I will revisit this is the future as I don't think it really lived up to what it can be.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Apples, peaches banana's and dark fruits. Alcohol from the start. T: Again, lots of fruit, sweet caramel malt, and spicy. A bit chocolaty. The fruit character rangers from banana's, apples, figs, plums, raisins and a lot more. Warming alcohol, that is very welcoming.. M/D: A snap on the tongue from the carbonation, but is also soft and creamy. The alcohol shows (as mentioned above), but it has a welcome warming effect. A great beer to sip on.  A classic that is the template for many/most American examples of the style, thats all that needs to be said. Excellent all around.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Plainsfield, NJ; beautiful dark blackish red with just a trace of light sneaking through. Decent two finger head that dissipated quickly.  Smell: Toasty wheat bread peppery cloves and sweet dark fruits. Deepy and darkly malty.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with low carbonation, moderately syrupy, just a little hoppy on the back of the tongue... a malty paradise on the tongue.  Taste: Sweet bananas drizzled with caramel and spiced with cloves and cinnamon. Just a little yeasty nuttiness sneaking in throughout. Peppery warmth on the finishing exhale.

A: Poured a murky dark brown with crimson accents, a one finger head, excellent lacing and fine retention. Head retianed a full cap for half of the glass.  S: Sweet malts and estery accents(cherrys and prunes and then bananas). A mature aging aroma which sublte wheat/grass undertones. If I'm not mistaken, there could have been a coco element.  T: Yeasty wheat, a fully bready persona. Fruits(pear/apples) came in second that added to mild spice swirling around. I deteted some fresh grapes within that adds to the sea of flavors(honey/vanilla) for this complex masterpiece.  M: Thick, chewy, creamy and full of well balanced carbonation.  D: A true delight after some disappointing tasting prior. The ABV comes in during the second and third tastes, which I fould very impessive and enjoyable.",Schneider Weisse G.

S - Fruity aroma of dark fruits with a hint of some spice. Maybe some over ripe apple? Almost a spicey smelling hefe in the nose.  T - Malty goodness with taste of apple and a roasted caramel sweetness. Also can pick up a hint of the graininess from the wheat. Great tasting beer. A sour tartness as well.  M/D - Light to medium bodied and somewhat chewy. Very drinkable but a little heavy on the carbonation.,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The smell was all banana and cloves, which seemed to mask the wheat but it was quite a pleasant aroma. The flavor was much like the smell, but without any one flavor being too overwhelming. It's medium-heavy body was smooth and delicious all the way down. Definitely recommended.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Tingly hop and carbonation, nice moderate smooth mouthfeel, bready malt and yeast, creamy, fairly spicy, pepper/clove... slightly medicinal/phenolic, fruit sweetness and banana... this is definitely more reminiscent of a hefeweizen than a doppelbock. Not in-your-face heavy malts, but it does have the ""restorative"" effect of a doppelbock. Suggested. Would have rated the taste a bit higher, but the spice was a little too predominant",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,everetends,4.45,"Bottle I purchased at Green's off Ponce in ATL. Poured into a weizen glass.  A: Pours a beautiful dark amber with some nice active carbonation. The beer is hazy and resembles homemade apple cider. Poured a huge white head the receded down to a white ring that left some decent lacing.  S: Smell is of malt, apple, banana, alcohol, grains. Banana dominates but all are present.  T: Banana is not the dominant taste here. The malt and bready taste comes through first and foremost. Apples come next with a touch of banana. The is sweetness to this brew but the alcohol cuts the sweetness perfectly.  M: Creamy but still has some carbonation. Coats the mouth and has just enough alcohol burn to let you know it is there. Aftertaste is of the present fruits.  D: Absolutely drinkable. My revisiting of my German brews is making me need to go back to Germany soon. These beers are amazing.",Schneider Weisse G.

S - There's the upfront smell of apple and possibly grape with background notes of cloves and definitely some alcohol thrown in.  T - Upfront this beer strikes me as a dark malty delight. There's definitely a lot of fruit going on in this beer and I'd still have to go with apple as the predominant. I can see this going really well with a medium-rare steak. What strikes me most about this one is how much the flavor really opens up as the beer warms to room temperature.  M - Mouthfeel is good. Nothing particularly special, but a nice soft carbonation nonetheless.  D - This beer is definitely has a high degree of drinkability.

72,224,ghostmech007,4.52,"500ml euro bottle poured into a weirdly shaped Weizen glass. I like the label on it though. Purple with like a golden filigree label. No fresh date but my girlfriends father said that he has been cellaring this brew for a year. Well... here goes.  Very very deep shade of brown. The coloring is just beautiful and the perfect crown of an off white head is just amazing.  Smells like the produce section of your grocer. Every form of fruit notes is in this brew. There is some notes of caramel, cloves, and a nice whiff of alcohol. Very enticing.  The taste. Oh my God the taste. Very creamy,thick and full bodied. The spicy punch you get from the cloves is just amazing. And the sweetness you get from brew is just perfectly balance to counter the cloves and hops. As for hops you don't get much bitterness but just enough so you aren't overpowered by syrupy sweetness. I was able to get some notes of chocolate and nuts. Even a bit of a coffee note at the brew went on. Very clean finish. Fantastic. Full marks on taste and mouthful.  I have to say that I was completely blown away by this brew. I mean to be cellared and cared for a full year to be enjoyed by two fellows in armchairs watching the Nationals being swept by the Reds it was a pleasant experience but I just don't know if it would be good one after another. As we didn't have anymore because we only had the two bottles I couldn't tell you. But for drinkablity I had to give it off for a few points because I think this would make a horrible session beer. For something you want to enjoy while watching the worst team in baseball get pummeled it really takes the edge off. Fantastic to drink but every once in a while.",Schneider Weisse G.

Quite nice.  T - Front is nicely fruity (apple?), quite dry. Mid is slightly candy, almost bubblegum like flavor. Back quite tart and slight alcohol warmth coming through, more fruit. Nice and smooth. Also quite dry.  M - Nothing spectacular. More fullness than many beers I've had. Carbonation is soft.  D - Oh boy.

Nose is all over the place, hugely wheaty, with dried fruit, yeast, a ton of spices, roasted malt, raisins. Flavor is totally similar, and amazing. A ton of mixing flavors and fruit, citrus, prunes, raisins, yeast, wheat, caramel and roasted malt. Man is this a delicious brew. Feel is fairly full bodied and perfect for the style.

Aroma is very clean...almost like a powerful Hefe, but with a bit more residual sugar and alcohol. Thick and sweet with carmelized ginger and esters of yeast and coriander.  Exceedingly refreshing for style. Clean, pure wheat notes with powerful molasses and rye bread backbone. Sort of like drinking a ginger snap (is that where that cookie thing came from?!). Tingle from carbonation works wonders to keep this from being heavy. Powerful yet balanced.  Mouthfeel is very powerful. Well-balanced with a full-bodied start and finish that brings out the wheat in spades. No style drift here. Still, very crisp and clean considering the huge flavor profile.  This packs a wallop with such bountiful taste but still is quite drinkable. Awesome, maybe quintessential style example - very clean.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Theres more that my barbaric senses just can't place. Absolutely amazing. I'm looking forward to this.  T: Mind boggling. Any brew dork can make a beer with tons of flavors but it takes a master to balance them and make them all work. A wheat foundation with strong fruits, bananas in particular dominate with spices, clove and others (I think I detect cinnamon but that can't be right, can it?) Sweet dark malts with an unidentified hop bring a complexity and balance that you don't see everyday in a beer. I am truly impressed and a little in awe.  M: Very wet with a medium to thick mouthfeel. It lets you know your effing around with something that has teeth.  D: Jesus, it's 8.2% alcohol but doesn't quite act it. A clear sign of a well balanced, masterful brew.  Overall a stunning brew worthy of your attention. My only disappointment is the lack of a bottling or expiration date.

I really kept turning the bottle hoping more would fall into me glass. Mouth feel - Big foamy head is reminiscent of sweet frothy milk.

It is extremely creamy and delicious. A nice fruitiness full of plum and banana open it up, followed by some nice phenols and cloves backed with some nice alcohol, which really works to enhance everything.

Dark fruits complement the malts. 8.2% abv, but I can't taste any hints of alcohol - maybe a slight warming affect during the finish, but that's all. A full body mouthfeel with lots of flavors that simply last. Smooth with appropriate carbonation.

Huge clove and banana aromas, with a little toasty malt.  In the mouth, this beer shines. Cloves, bananas, sweet malt and plenty of dark fruit on the finish make this beer absolutely delicious. No alcohol present, with the exception of a tiny bit on the finish. I'm hesitant to put it in Duvel territory (ie 5 for flavor), but it butts up against it without doubt.  Overall, it's pretty good in the mouth. A little overcarbonated, but that was remedied by a vigorous second pour. Still, creamy isn't an adjective that comes to mind here. The complete lack of noticeable alcohol, combined with that indefinable drinkability that comes only with wheatbeers, makes this a real guzzler.

S - Lots of brown sugar, with some sour wheat pulling through. A bit of chocolate and/or vanilla hiding as well, and the alcohol is quite noticable.  T - Slightly roasted malt hits initially followed by the brown sugar/vanilla wave from the nose. Raisins, overripe banana, and bitter bread take hold before giving way to sour wheat, phenols, and alcohol in that order. I dare say some hops are hiding out in the late palate emergence of alcohol.  M - Too thin to showcase its best flavors. Heavier body is in order, and dropping the carbonation a notch would help even more.  D - Good stuff, but overall it's too dry, too thin, and too high in alcohol for me to completely enjoy.

Sherry-like, with some tobacco and honey scent. Chocolatey malt. The german wheat fruitiness is pretty much nonpresent, substituted by cherry and prune. The flavor opens with sweet, honey glazed wheat malt, nice and chocolatey up front. With some years on it, this has become very much like a strong belgian dark. Full bodied, with a dry, powdery feel. All the carbonation is still there. Sherry-like, and very vintage. Lots of dark fruit, though black cherry comes forward most. Aged, dry wheaty sourness in the finish, balancing and wrapping things up neatly. Some of the complexity seems to have dropped out in favor of the typical aged beer flavors.

72,224,indiapaleale,4.62,"2008 Vintage 5.26.08 ~ Pours dark ruby red and very cloudy/murky. It reminds me of fresh, unfiltered apple cider. The head is huge, white and very, very fluffy. It takes awhile for it to settle to a level in which I can take a sip without getting foam on my forehead.  Smell reminds me of canned bartlett pears. That is the first thing that comes to mind. There is a lot of fresh, ripe fruit in the nose of this beer. Its very sweet and rich and some of the clove and banana from the yeast is also present. Very, very inviting.  Taste is juicy. Very juicy. LOTS of ripe apple, pear and figs. As the glass drains a bit I can get hints of alcohol that weren't apparent at first. Its an easy drinking and quite thirst quenching. It really is amazing that this beverage is made from such simple ingredients since there is quite a bit of complexity going on with all of the tastes you get. Aventinus is the type of beer that once you have a glass its unlikely that you'll ever forget it. You'll keep going back to that familiar purple-labeled bottle to get your deep, dark fix.  2002 Vintage 6.17.08 ~  Pours a murky, muddy ruby red to brown color. Carbonation levels are surprisingly active and the head fluffs up to a few fingers in thickness before slinking away.  The smell is prunes, raisins, some alcohol and a bit of chocolate and caramel. There are also hints of raspberry, burnt sugars and some sour notes. There are so many smells to try and sort out. Every time you stick your face in the glass you'll get a different smell.  Taste is very smooth and more mellowed out. The fresh apple juiciness that the fresh Aventinus has is not anywhere near as apparent with this aged bottle. Its more subdued and like caramel coated granny smith apples. Lots of sweet sugar, some bitter fruits, raisins and dates. Its a very complex beer with lots of layers of taste that seem to have developed with age. As this glass warms the adjectives start to pile up.  The complexity (and tastiness) of this aged bottle is outstanding. Another reason why I love beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,jamie2dope,4.23,"This is one of the first Weizenbocks I ever tried, and so it has always held a special place for me. Pours a somewhat murky light amber color, darker towards the top, and gets lighter as you go down. A big cloud like poof of head shows itself early, fades a bit, but holds up very well mostly. Smell has some spicy clove, strawberry, prune, wheat, cinnamon and much more I am sure. Taste is extremely juicy, and busting at the seams with fruit flavors, spice and wheat that mirrors some of the smells mentioned above. Body of the beer is medium, and has a certain degree of heat, but not to the point of being offensive. The tastes do a good job of masking the higher ABV. Although many have called this one a sipper, I could gulp this stuff down easily. I will agree that this is one of the best for the style. Cheers",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,Jwale73,4,"Served in my Oberon weizen glass. Poured a cloudy plum color with a rocky off-white head that took up half the glass. Excellent retention and a fair amount of lacing that adhered to the sidewalls of the glass during the tasting. Scent of dark fruit and bubblegum. A slight medicinal quality, not at all unpleasant, and clove present upfront in the flavor profile. Dark fruit is again revealed somewhere in the middle (seems to be raisins and prunes) followed by a tart and spicy finish. Lots of effervescence with quite a bit of burn throughout the mouth. Alcohol is well hidden, but complexity of flavor limits drinkability to one bottle tops, but quite enjoyable nonetheless.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,PBBC,4.64,"Pours a cloudy-brown... the head does not linger very long... not nearly as dark as I expected.  Aroma... very nice, smell is reminiscent of apple juice? but very strong wheat and yeast aroma... almost a caramel-banana smell.  Taste... complex, begins sweet, with raisin-like flavors, rounding off with a little bit of a bourbon-like oakiness, the alcohol warms the palate... very present yeast... but not unpleasant  The carbonation level is a little on the high-side, preventing this beer from becoming too heavy... the wheat lends a crisp, tartness to the brew...  A very drinkable, rich, flavorful beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,CHADMC3,4.45,"Aventinus  Pours a walnut brown throughout the body with hints of a lighter brown towards the bottom. A substantial, fluffy white head appears and gives way to little to no lacing.  Rich scent of fresh banana and clove spice as advertised. The dark yeast is also apparent as well as faint wheat or grass.  Sweet banana and other dark fruits with hints of chocolate and dry grassy notes highlight the taste, which is capped by a friendly spice aftertaste.  The generous carbonation and slight bite aftertaste do not interfere with the inviting mouthfeel, this beer is easy on the palate.  The balance of sweet flavor character, gentle spice and balanced mouthfeel make this easy to enjoy. Excellent beer!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,JudgeRoughneck,3.92,"Aroma -bannana, bright plum, alcohol, berries, clove, - basically smells like hefe with great added complexity, little sugary  App - opaque plum color with loud, lively carbonation, head retention is not awesome but nontheless impressive for the strength of the beer  Taste - Wonderfully deep malt flavor is kept levitating on the palate by the wheat. Hefe yeast's signature banana/ clove combo runs through the whole thing with a nice raisin character. Stone fruits appear every now and then. Wheat dries out the finish. Alcohol is there but you've really gotta look for it.  MF- Wheat and carbonation really seem to play a key role in keeping this strong, full-bodied beeer from coating the palate.  What a magical beer style. Complex but humble and, knowing the Germans, probably a realatively simple grain bill. This is maybe the most drinkable beer upward of 7% ABV I've ever had. Could get into some real trouble with this one flowing on tap.  REVISITED 2-21-2020  APPEARANCE - Deep ruby bronze with a dull haze, but far from turbid. Large head dies immediately, no lace no legs. AROMA - blackcurrant, caramel malt, fresh wheat, low clove, cherry/berry, vapory alcohol, molasses, no banana really, wisp of vanilla, a little citrus, slight bubblegum,  FLAVOR - fresh wheat, deep clove, malty caramel brightens into brown sugar and is not sweet or cloying and it drys out into bread crust. Berry/bubblegum esters are very subdued, but there, vanilla and clove linger in finish, comes off medicinal but pleasantly liquer -like. Still no real banana ester. AN almond note comes out with warmth.  MF- medium-full body with mouth-filling carbonation, some oily texture, a little stinging acidity and a long alcoholic finish that's just a little on the hot side.  OVERALL - Not as enamored with this as the first time I reviewed it, but still a great beer. Probably had a fresher bottle that first time.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The tap ran dry the last time I was here, so I jumped on it this time. $9 for a drop into the official half liter glass. My lunch in comparison, was only $7.50. :o  Big frothy head spilling all over the bar, but it settles just on the line. Nice recovery. Served a little cold & fidgety, it tossed around for a little while & settled on just being plain old brown & cloudy.  Big yeasty caramel nose, with very pungent clove & bread crust right in the center of things. Almost like someone making bread pudding for the first time. :P Big splash of alcohol concentrating at the end.  Taste was a little disappointing. Very, very bready, lazy & abusive banana/clove esters & a karate throat chop full of alcohol. Positives were the peppery spiciness, some caramel, & the pruny & acidic end that gets soaked up on a toasted finish.  Flour-like texture(though strong carbonation), but really too messy with the alcohol. I enjoyed the taste, but didn't really enjoy swallowing it.  Nine dollars can buy me a really mean LI iced tea. Just saying. :D",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Really nice overall flavor. Everything is pretty subtle.  M: Good carbonation, a bit thin, but not too disappointing.  D: Surprisingly gentle on the palate, even after awhile.  This is a very good beer, and amazingly drinkable for 8%.  Edit: Just wanted to add some notes about a 2005 version, aged in their brewery...  Poured into a weizen glass from a 16oz bottle. Cap is a little rusty, bottle comes covered in paper with the year on it.  A: Brown hazy body, there are chunks floating in this one, maybe I poured too aggressively. After 5 years the yeast probably fell out and clumped like this. Head is large and off white.  S: The smell is mostly of hefe, but there is alot of fruit in the nose, and maybe a slight bit of cream, maybe dark peach aromas. Slightly meaty?  T: Easily drinkable, not as much flavor as the nose might suggest though.  M: Higher carbonation than my last review suggests, better mouthfeel than before.  D: Highly drinkable, still. Maybe I expect something big here due to the gravity, but this beer somehow ends up light and drinkable.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,brushtachio,4.33,"A - the dark coffee color seemed almost totally opaque until I held my glass up to a strong light revealing the slightest glint of amber. The bubbles streaming up the surface tossed around the ample supply of yeast. It produced a thin head nonetheless held up for a while.  S - smell was subtle (full disclosure: I was a little stuffed up with spring allergies) but complex with traces of ripe fruit, dates, and maybe even a little leather.  T- there is so much going on here. The fruit and date hinted at in the nose are here with some cloves and a balanced but unmistakable alcohol warming that lingers. Delicious.  M- this criterion is the toughest for me to evaluate (in general-not just with this beer) but I know what I like... And this feels great in my mouth.  D- doubt this was intended as a session beer but I could (and have) drink 3 or 4 of these in a row before the ABV caught up with me.

There is a lot going on here and I enjoy the many layers the brew has to offer.  Notes: When I can not find any Sam Adams Double bock I find this is not a replacement,but an upgrade. Obviously they are different styles yet it seems they are cut from the same cloth. The Aventinus is lighter and slightly less in ABV,but when you have an Aventinus one can not tell it is so high in ABV.

Alcohol hits the back of the nose, and as the beer warms, becomes more noticeable.  M - Good carbonation is the first thing you notice. Not overly sticky. Has medium heaviness.

Dark fruit notes and alcohol.  T: Wheat, spiciness, a warming alcohol. Again, a tea quality, along with some fruit notes and just the slightest bit of a caramelized sugars  M: Assertive carbonation, a bit of stickiness, just shy of being a dry finish (or semidry finish). A good, medium-heavy body.  D: A nice finish to a dinner of 8 day old, homemade sauerbraten! A little on the bigger side... A sipper, but an easy sipper.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,MrHungryMonkey,4.1,"Sweet, creamy malt coupled with a zesty, citric spice - classic Weizen aroma.  Brown cola color, remarkable hue. Pretty good clarity, aside from yeasts getting in there on second pour. Moderate head.  Citric attack quells to a turbulent sea of malty goodness. Saccharine sweetness provides the dominate flavor; the rest of the balance comes from some serious roasted malt, vanilla hints, and alcohol heat in the back. Sour wheat flavors creep in bringing a wild side to the equation. Vanilla element, along with the mouthfeel, make me feel that I'm drinking a milk shake. Finish is strong with vanilla and that alcohol heat, along with more of that zesty, citric spice as well as tannic hop bitterness. Good bit of creamy mouthfeel.  Mmm... this is really quite good. There's just enough alcohol to taste a hint of (and feel just more than a hint of) and plenty of rich, complex malt to play with - a balance of intense flavors rare to find and easy to overlook. Kudos.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,prototypic,4.35,"Appearance: It's very cloudy and a dark, toasted brown color. There's an orange hue at the edges and just the slightest bit of light getting through. The head is foamy white and only about a finger and a half deep. Retention was relatively short, but a better than average coat of lace lined the glass.  Smell: Caramel/toffee malts are heavy and sweet up front. Spicy aromas (light clove and pepper) follow. It's a bit fruity and features pleasant apple and pear fragrances. Hops are very light and provide a little balance. Ultimately, it's malty and sweet. Alcohol is not noticeable in the least. That's a positive considering it is a relatively sizeable beer. Light yeasty scent toward the end.  Taste: It's sweet and fruity intially. Apple and pear flavors mix with light dark fruit flavors (light raisin and plum) very well. Caramel/toffee malts add more sweetness and an excellent base. It's more spicy than I anticipated. Clove is the primary spice, but pepper and perhaps ancillary spices are present. Hops are light and provide just enough bitterness and balance. It is slightly yeasty. Alcohol is masked very well as it's not noticeable in taste. This is very tasty and complex.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied, creeping toward medium. Carbonation is very good. It's smooth and drinkable. Considering it's 8% abv, that's a huge compliment. It's very drinkable and I'm certain to pick up more next time around.  To be honest, I've had limited experiences with this style. To date, they've been good. But, this has truly been a great experience. I'm very pleased Aventinus and have no reservations recommending it. It's worthy of all the accolades it's received.

The aromas were molasses, celery, bubblegum, and banana.  The mouthfeel had medium carbonation. Perfect feel on the tongue.  The taste was very sweet--that bubblegum flavour, I suppose--chased by cloves (which went undetected in the aroma for me). The bitterness was all unsweetened cocoa, and there was a barely-noticeable warming from the higher alcohol content.  All in all, an excellent brew that I'm glad to have sampled.

Finish is sweet, but with a hop zing.  Mouthfeel is very good, carbonation is present, but light too keep things thick but not too heavy.

I can smell cooking fruitcake, stewed apple, cinnamon and cloves.  Taste - 5.0 Beautifully smooth thanks to the hybrid style.

Drinkability - 4.0 Almost too rich, one 500mL at a time is enough, but very tasty and memorable.  OVERALL Wow, this is a big, tasty beer!

This is one of the most complex beers I've ever had, with each sip bringing a different combination of flavors. Finishes extremely smooth, gently rolling into a light bitterness. My favorite German beer, maybe my favorite beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Atron67,4.62,"Thanks to bdchung52077 for the trade bottle comes ina pretty sweet pint bottle that i wish more people would use because it would be great for homebrewing  drank from a snifter at just below room temp  A- poured a surprisingly dark brown that was pretty reminiscent of an extra special bitter or best brown beer. has a light almost white head on top that fizzed up and lowered pretty quick as well. so low retention, i shook it up a little before serving so it was nice an foggy with wheat and yeast as ide hoped  S- yeast on top is the biggest scents i can smell, a little overpowering but prolly due to my shaking and swirling before chilling, lots of wheat on top, banana and cloves pretty strong as well. low hops on the back end but its not sweet and is well balanced for maltiness  T- awesome huge wheat flavors all over the place. banana's cloves all over the place letting you know this is a real bavarian wheat beer. the phenols esters and diacetyl really take hold. if it werent for my new glarus availability i would say this is by far the best wheat ive ever had but dancing man and imperial weizen are both up there with it. I drank an ipa before this and the flavors still shine through over that.  M- was originally too carbonated but as i let it settle it came down to a more appropriate carbonation and really let it shine, and ide much rather have it over carbonated than under  d- i love wheat beer. ide be a happy man with this available",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,drumrboy22,3.7,"Poured from bottle into a Magic Hat Hocus Pocus glass, which was probably the closest thing I have to an Aventinus glass. If anybody reading this has an extra Aventinus glass, drop me a BM and we'll work something out. Beer was a dark, brown color with a large, rocky head that quickly died down to a thin layer. Heavy carbonation.  Aroma was toffee, nuts, alcohol, raisins, apple, caramel and yeast.  Taste was sweet, spices, yeast, alcohol, a tad medicinal. Reminds me a little of the chicory coffee I get when I go to New Orleans.  Smooth mouthfeel that left a slick coating on my tongue.  This was a unique beer. I enjoyed it, but I'd like to see what some age would do to it.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Goliath,4.13,"Pours a dark brown with some ruby hues. Two fingers of off-white head sit on top receeding with no real lacing to speak of.  The aroma is spicey, due to the clove. A hint of the banana comes through.  Taste is quite nice. Flavors of banana and clove are dominant, a slight hint of vanilla and caramel.  Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with fairly low carbonation. Very appropriate for the style.  Drinkability is fairly high. Definitely smooth and easy to drink due to good flavors, but at 8.2% it's a decent sized beer calling for slower consumption.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

World class.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,nocheinsbitte,4.53,"Appearance: Poured out of a 0.5 liter dark bottle. Poured well, a dark chocolate color that had highlights of amber as it was poured into the glass. when in the glass, the bottom is fairly clear, allowing sunlight through. As you go higher, the color is almost opaque revealing a very complex, well made bier. Smell: The smell is refreshing, which is funny due to the high alcohol content. Sweet, rustic, and almost screaming for you to drink it. Taste: Full-bodied, sweet nectar of the gods that is a pleasure to drink. A fruity taste mixed with a slight alcohol smell/taste mixed with almost a woodsy feel that together makes one of the best biers in the world. Mouthfeel: no bitterness or after taste. Drinkability: This is not a bier you drink with your friends on an afternoon watching football; this is something you drink when conversing with your dad about life or politics or literature. It is a bier that is meant to be savored and appreciated for the rare find it is. Treat this bier with respect and admiration.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,hyland24,4.67,"Poured from a 500ml amber bottle with purple and gold label into a flute glass. The bottle states the ABV is actually 8.2% not a big difference from the 8.00% the site lists.  It poured beautiful. A cloudy amber that showed a light almost golden hue at the bottom of the glass and gradually grew darker towards the top where it was topped off by a perfect off white inch thick foam head. The head did not last long and the speckled lacing also faded rather quickly. There was a steady line of carbonation flowing from the bottom center, straight to the top without touching the sides all the way until the final sip.  The smell was phenomenal. Strong scents of fruit, sweet smelling with a slight alcohol finish. Probably the best smelling beer I have sampled to date. I could actually smell it from the bottle almost 3 feet from where i was sitting even before it was poured.  The taste was impressive as well. Fruity with tastes of raisin, pear, and apricot finishing with a fairly strong alcohol presence. although not overpowering.  The mouthfeel was refreshing. Full bodied, and highly carbonated but not to the point where it effects the taste of the beer.  This is an excellent example of this beer style. I normally dont write this long a review but this beer blew me away. I actually am upset because I am down to my last few sips and I only have this one bottle in the house. I would go out of my way to find this beer again and highly recommend to anyone interested in this beer style or any beer style for that matter. I actually just swirled the last bit left in the bottle to pick up the remaining yeast and poured it into the glass which created a cascade similar to a fresh poured guinness with tiny clumps of yeast that settled in the bottom of the glass. The 8.2% ABV prevents this from being considered a session beer but I would drink these till last call and then sleep on the curb outside the bar. Its that good.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,ElGrecoVerde,4.33,"Poured a fairly clear amber brown color.  The smell was similar to a caramel apple. Some spicy apple aromas, caramel, and a tiny bit nutty.  Flavors start with some cider and clove, adequately smoothed out by rich caramel for those who don't prefer spicy beers. A little bit of banana makes a cameo to please the beer drinking gorillas out there.  Very smooth beer, and easy to drink considering the 8+% abv. There's just enough carbonation to ease it down without making you sick.  Definitely something I would get again.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

A good amount of foamy lace left down the sides of the glass.  Smell is of dark brandy soaked fruits. Carmel malts, fruity esters and cloves. Taste is similar with dark fruits and roasted malts predominating up front. Spicy cloves and vanilla in the mid palate and a mild biting hops bitterness in the aftertaste. There is a definite sweetness without being syrupy or sticky. Alcohol not detectable at all.  Mouthfeel is fairly light. Feel is very crisp and dry. I was expecting a heavier beer, but was presently surprised by the light, uplifting body. Carbonation is quite high with persistent fine active carbonation.

There are subtle hints of fruits in the beer too. Damn tasty.  M: Carbonation and with a light a medium mouthful  D: German beer is almost always drinkable, and the flavour of the fruits is damn addicting.  EDIT: I find this beer fucking solid in all regards.

72,224,Antilochus,4.35,"Purchased at a Kingston, Ontario LCBO in September of 2007 and cellared since then (four months, roughly). I can't decipher the freshness stamp. Aventinus was one of the first quality beers I've ever had and I'm surprised it has taken me this long to review it.  500mL bottle, 8.20% abv.  Poured into a nosing glass. Appearance is nut brown, nice copper accents, moderate haze, with a substantial offwhite-tan head. Head dissipates except for around the edge of the glass and a slight film in the centre. Looks beautiful.  Aromas: raisins, carrots, apples, german yeast, cooked pears, pie crust and caramelized sugar. Very grapey and a little medicinal (cough syrup). Don't worry, I'm going to let this one warm up and evolve for a long time. Extremely complex and delicious. Spices (cinnamon, like a cinnamon bun, raisins and all), dark fruits (as expected), a little musty.  Mouthfeel is definitely carbonated and substantial body. Lots of sweetness on the palate with some sharp alcohol, bolstered by the carbonation. Bubble gum, banana, yeast (typical wheat) lots of maltiness here. Finish is medium long and has some bitterness to it that helps improve the drinkability. Warming and soothing on a cold day.  In every category I find small faults - weak head retention, some medicinal aromas, etc. Hence the 4.5s and 4s. This is fantastic beer, one of the best I've had, and definitely a classic.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Upon opening, I immediately poured it into a glass and noticed how nice of a head came out of it. As I began to drink it, I noticed aromas of fruit, a heavy but not-to-sweet taste with an incredible champagne-like carbonation.  I bought this beer at a time when I was strictly drinking IPA's and assorted Pale's, and I could argue that this beer helped change my taste. I highly recommend this beer to anyone who likes a variety of beers.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Aromas are huge with lots of clove, caramel, banana, and wheat, and a slight bit of cocoa. On the palate, the chocolate becomes more evident along with dark fruits, raisins, a little vanilla, some cinnamon in the finish, ginger, along with an astringency.

72,224,manleyphoto,4.22,"Aventinus from G.Schneider and Sohns brewery in Kelheim, Germany (cq brewery name and location) is a hefeweizen doppelbock, which sounds like a mouthful but is is essentially a fancy German way of saying that it's a strong, dark, unfiltered wheat beer. Dopplebocks are usually associated with cooler weather, but honestly, I could drink Aventinus any time of the year. The beer pours a hazy dark brown color with a stark white head of foam, that can crest up and over the rim of the glass. The smell is faintly spicy with a pronounced banana aroma from the yeast. The beer itself is rich and malty with a solid banana flavor, mixed with raisin, and vaguely of bubblegum. The beer is pleasantly carbonated which makes it an easy drinker, but at 8% alcohol by volume, it shout not be underestimated. Although it claims a German pedigree, Aventinus has a strong local tie.

No lace and no retention.  S: Smells of sweet and sour dark fruit. Cherries, some grape, a bit of toasted malt and bread.  T: Upfront, much like the nose, but a less sour character. Sweet malt mixed in as well, a little bit of earthy yeast, splash of wheat and some caramel and breadiness in between. Finish is sweet, but just when you think it is just going to be sweet, it shows some chocolate and slightly roasted malt character. Alcohol is silent on the palate, but warms the chest slightly on the way down. A hint of smoke and tobacco seem to poke their heads in, a little bit of bitterness that pops up in the back end serves well to balance the sweetness. The roasted and chocolate character meld a little to give a hint coffee. A very tasty brew.  M/D: Smooth, slightly sticky on the tongue, carbonation is very smooth as well.

There is some banana and maybe caramel to the aroma.  The fruity taste would complement strong cheese, I think. Although there is a rounded maltiness to this, it is not dripping with sweetnees as the other weizenbock I have tried. The alcohol is noticeable and may be cutting the sweetness, but I suspect the local boys used more caramel malts, too.

This is only my second Weizenbock ever in my life, so I've not much to go off on in the way of comparison, but let's see how this one goes.  The brew pours quite nicely. With a vigorous pour into the supplied glass that comes with the beer, it produces much nice light and tan head. It dissipates quickly, but retains a nice lacing. The body is a purplish brown color, and is quite hazy from the left over hefe.  The aromas are sweet, something in the way of raspberries.  The taste is berry like and a bit tart. This is a complex beer and definetly a sipper.  I suppose with the moderately high alcohol content, one would expect a warm feeling to this brew, and this is certainly the case; however, this is very drinkable. Just enjoy this beer!

72,224,PhageLab,4.16,"Served in a massive (18oz?) Aventinus glass. Wow.  A - Beautiful brownish red brew, cloudy from the swirls and currents of yeast circling around it's massive glass. Produced a three tip head of froth that stuck around a while. Nice lacing. Can't ask for more here.  S - Citrus and fruit smells are right up front, with yeast and some sort of spice aroma finishing it up. Not too potent, but very pleasant.  T - Very yeasty, but the abv is absolutely invisible. Slight bitterness, and something like nutmeg or clove sneaks in. Finishes with some banana like characteristics. Very tasty and fairly complex.  M - Creamy medium body, great carbonation level. Can get chewy near the end.  D - Pretty good, but the overall yeastiness causes a big hit here, I doubt I could do more than 2 in a night, especially in a large serving like this. Excellent brew overall, however. Recommended.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

This is carried through in the flavour, which reminded me a bit of some of the Chimays. Good hint of chocolate present also. The alcohol is slightly apparent, but well enough integrated and provides a very pleasant warming feel. The body is full.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Easy 3 fingers of off white head rises and falls slowly. No lacing.  S: Lol, I already know I'm not gonna like this much. Huge weizen yeastiness. Plenty of banana bread and clove. Fresh sour green apples. A touch of that 'soupiness' I get from weizens.  T/M: Big yeasty notes. More banana bread and clove. A white peppery spicy and a touch of cardamom(sp?). A more pronounced maltiness than in normal weizens. Body is beefed up as well with a nice creaminess.  D: This brew goes to show what frequent tastings and exploration will do to your palate. I'm still not a big fan of weizens but this was much better than I had anticipated.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,SMark,4.42,"This beer was poured from a 500ml bottle at 47° into a .5l wheat glass. The beer was dark red, mahogany not quite brown or black with about 3 fingers of an off white foam head and hard to see carbonation. There was very little lacing.  There was caramel, chocolate and coffee malt aroma with spiciness.  The taste was sweet and very smooth. Went down so smooth I had to taste again and make an effort to discern the banana notes along with chocolate. This is nectar.  There is no off taste or lingering on the palate which could cause you to consume too quickly. Swishing around in the mouth produced very pleasant esters in the nose with no prickly sensation. As I said before, very smooth and velvet like.  What a nice pleasure for my 100th beer review. Well made and a definite enjoyment to drink.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The taste is fantastic, great hefe flavors; banana, clove, medicinal, and a nice earthy yeast. A bit of alcohol and light dark fruit shows up in the end. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation. The finish is fantastic, it is sweet but not sugary or syrupy, perfect. Damn this is a mighty fine brew. All of the great hefe flavors without the hard wheat bite. Extremely smooth and extraordinarily drinkable. Definitely a must try and try and try again.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Smell was yeasty and weiss-like with a fruity component. Tastes was sweet up front, great maltiness with a fruity tang. No real hop presence to speak of. I was sure the ABV listed on the menu was incorrect because this beer does not taste like it is as high as it is, the alcohol is very well balanced.

Aroma is big and sweet, some alcohol with barleywine-like notes. Some caramel and tart apple. Phenols and alcohol are present. Nice. Taste is fronted by fruit: raisins, tart apple, roasted fig, nuts and caramel. Middle is warmed by alcohol and finishes smooth with lingering taste of raisins and roasted malt. Very nice again.

72,224,emerge077,4.02,"Not your typical Aventinus review, these reviews are from a recent tasting of vintage 2002-2003 cave-aged bottles. Wrapped in paper and tied with a purple cord.  2003 bottle: This one looks much better than the 2002, a high clarity reddish brown with a ton of carbonation streamers. Carefully decanted into a weizen glass. An initial skim of foam is fed by the rapid, continuous carbonation.  Interesting aroma...sherry sweetness, attic must, clay, leather, slight alcohol, and black currants. Also very different from a fresh bottle, and unique in it's own right.  Flavors of dry earthy malts, candlewax smoke, very meaty feel similar to savory almonds or walnuts. Full and well-carbonated, drying out the palate a bit. Body is slightly lighter without the yeast poured in, but it's completely dead at this point, so why bother? The yeast has imparted many complex flavors into this cave-aged edition. I'd recommend drinking at 2-3 years, if this edition is released again.  2002 bottle: Somewhat thin, moderate oxidation. Clay & musty caramel malt in the aroma. Almond and cidery tasting. Likely past it's prime. Foam rose to the mouth of the bottle before pouring, visible carbonation even after 1/2 hour of sitting in the glass. A muted sweetness and intial metallic note that blew off after breathing for awhile. Excessive sediment after a careful pour hinders the appearance, mouthfeel, and drinkability.  Much diminished in quality from a fresh sample, but still garners interest. I'll be drinking the 2003 vintage soon, don't wait too long on these. $4 from Lukas Liquors, KCMO.  Scores averaged to reflect a combination of the 2002-2003 vintages.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Smell is fruity with apples and pears coming through. Some grapes, and a decent amount of german malt and a dash of Hallertauer hops in the background. Taste is thick and delicious. I imagine this is what monks would be drinking centuries ago (I'm reading The Pillars of the Earth now). Taste is of fruity, with a malty sweetness and plenty of a thick taste behind it. I can sense a bit of a meaty broth taste that makes me want to sip this one. Highly carbonated for having such a big alcohol presence.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

I feel like I am smelling the inside of a thoroughly wet barrel. Flavor is extremely sweet with a tart kick in the back of the mouth on the first swig. Sweet brandy and port tones permeate. Very sugary sweet on the flavor overall though. Feel is standard. Borders on slightly syrupy. Drinkable. Sure. But for me this is an experience drink, not one to go back to again.

Everything goes into everything else. Totally complex and enjoyable.  M: Just about perfect. Slightly syrupy but the carbonation takes care of that.  D: I could drink this all day.

A: Very dark cloudy and purplely brown with a two inch creamy and tightly packed sandy white head. Not much carbonation can be seen and there is just a bit of soft lacing. Very bueatiful cascading effect as it is first poured into the glass.  S: Pretty nice and mellow but hides a very sugary sweet dark fruit and candy beneath a creamy exterior, like raisins rolled in yeast and sugar.  T/MF: Quite a highly carbonated brew as it ballons in the mouth and at first imparts a good dusty yeast character but as it warms the beer becomes less funky and a good deal sweeter with fresh cut apple and raisins being the highlight of the beer which is less evident in the middle and finish where a nice spice and herbal tinge not unlike licorice greets the tongue in a long finish. This beer is also quite hoopy but really hides this well among the malty sweet goodness, the only way to tell is that drying sensation that sticks to the center of the tongue long after the beer is gone and that vicicious attack to the roof of the mouth.

Nice amber brown with sedement still floating around.  S - Sweet, fruity bliss. You can smell the wheat slightly under the massive fruit scents.  T - Oh My GOD! Can I post that? Immediately the carbonation hits the roof of your mouth and the sweet fruity flavor of the beer attacks your tongue. While it washes back to your throat for the swallow and finish your mouth won't allow you to stop, it wants more, keep it flowing. It's heavenly.  M - I don't know what to say that I haven't already. You finally pull it away and it stays, lingers, and tingles in your mouth. The sweet fruit slowly fades away.  D - Don't buy just one. Pick up a few. Age them if you can. In April of 2006 I did a sample of these from 1999, 2000 and 2001. Those I had aged for a couple of years after I bought them. They were amazing. The 2000 was my favorite. With age everything got more powerful and had more bite. The other thing I will suggest is to have the Aventinus glassware.

Couldn't stand it. Funny how things change over time... First things first, this is a gorgeous beer. Large frothy just off-tan head. Great retention. Started out about 3 fingers and eventually faded to a nice covering of the beer. Eventually the head became a scale model picture of the Milky Way. Just swirls of miniature beer foam planets floating on top of my glass of beer. Very clear, light amber color. Immediate huge nose of clove, anise, caramelized bananas. This is what fruitcake should smell like. A bit of smokeyness, fresh baked shortbread cookies. The taste is just as complex. Malty clove induced bananas foster, minimal hops presence. Getting some grain (wheat, duh). Quite sweet, almost bubblegummy. Definitely not the drain pour it once was. Nice full mouthfeel. Lingers nicely from sip to sip. Not overly carbonated. Very drinkable, even for 8.2%. Definitely one of my go to beers for the cooler months.  Damn, I wish I never poured that first one out...",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Smell: Sweet fruits, wheat, bananna, and a bit of clove are all present in the nose. Not a very powerful aroma though, have to get in close to get the scent.  Taste: Dark fruits and a bit of sweet cherry flavor as well. Additionally, you get a nice wheat flavor along with the clove that was present in the nose. Very nice flavor here.

Murky, rusty brown brew without a finger of coarse off-white head that stuck around for a little while, but persisted in a thin layer throughout the drinking privelege/experience. The smell is ripe fruit, mild alcohol, a bit of yeast, ripe fruit, and ripe fruit. The flavor unfolds in the mouth in a delightful way, starting with the obvious ripe fruit up front, then opening up to subtle yeast notes, followed by the warmth of alcohol. The wheat provides a great balance to the other bold flavors in this wonderful beer. The mouthfeel is damned nice: pretty smooth, maybe just a touch over-carbonated, but still very nice. The yeasty residue in the mouth is great, and is complimented by the warmth of the alcohol. It's easy to drink, particularly for something so big and bold.

This is one of those beers that I see on the shelf but always end up reaching for something else but I grabbed it today.  Appearance: This beer poured a cloudy bronze with a vigorous three finger head. The head is soapy and quickly disappears with no lacing. Please pour it slowly as there is some yeast sediment is in the bottle.  Smell: Dark fruits, bready yeast and a mild banana jump into my nose. The smell is sweet and potent but in a wonderful way. There's a hint of mild caramel and some malt. It has the smell of a Belgian tripel.  Taste: The dark fruits of the smell follow into the taste. Sweet cherries and dates...pretty damn tasty! Mild yeast, though I'm struggling to taste the clovelike finish that the bottle pronounces. There is no hint of the 8.2% ABV though I am starting to feel it in my head. That's okay though.  Mouthfeel: Nice...just enough carbonation and viscosity to cover the tongue and accent the taste.  Drinkability: I had to double check the bottle because I didn't believe the ABV...it's barely in the taste but finds it's way to my head nicely. I'm drinking this one far faster than planned. I wish I had another bottle to split with a friend.  Overall: I would try this out if you've walked past it. Awesome smell and flavor...enjoy this one with one with a calzone.

72,224,brdc,4.8,"Pured this one into my Aventinus glass, unskillfully producing an enormous amount of a foamy/airy head. It quickly drops down, revealing a beautiful mahogany brew, with a light tan head that is now creamy, leaves a nice lacing and keeps a collar for a very long time. Small pieces of what I hope are yeasts drop slowly to the bottom. Aroma is tamed, but quite nice; dark fruits, clove, other spices, and even some chocolate. Creamy and velvety on the mouth, medium to full bodied with little carbonation adding to the velvety feel, it delicate yet bold, spiced up front, evolving into a sweetish chocolate, turning into dark fruits, and then clove, matching the aroma perfectly. At this ABV is ridiculously easy to take down. First time I review, but my third or fourth, on my way to many more. Exquisite!  Addendum: Had one bottled in 2001, served in 2010. Aged three years in their caves, longer in my cellar. The aroma improves remarkably, with a lot of sherry and chocolate notes. Taste seems a bit sweeter, but mouthfeel for some reason feels slightly watered down. Impressive after 9 years.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,dnichols,4.7,"I poured a 500 ml capped bottle into a traditional hefe wiezen glass.  A: It poured a murky, cloudy brown body. A moderately aggressive pour generated a massive three finger dark caramel head. The head lingered for a time then receded to a light cover over the liquid. It supported a thick curtain of lacing that did not last very long into the xperience.  S: It had the strong aroma of yeast from the dough of a dark nutty bread and sweet medium roast malts. The sweet aromas were complex and included brown sugar, ripe dark fruits and rich cream maple syrup.  T: It is a smooth and creamy malty brew that has a nice even but pronounced sweetness that coats the mouth. There is no bite to this brew, its all about the balance of malts and yeasts. Its sweetness is not overpowering at all...just a nice balanced bundle of joy.  M: It is a creamy and full bodied brew that is deceptively light on the palate. Its sweet without being syrupy, has a balanced carbonation and strong enough ABV to clean the palate but sufficiently hidden to provide a nice warm glow that lingers long after the swig is gone.  D: It is a wonder of balance...sweet but not too much so, hidden but high ABV, and nice even carbonation. It is full bodied by light on the palate. A wonderful drink that I could drink several of in a session.  Comment: I am becoming a real fan of Weizenbock...and this is the head of the class (so far).",Schneider Weisse G.

A respectable off white/vanilla colored head that dissipates rather quickly.  Smell: Carmel and malt with a light smell of fruit. Overall the smell is light but very good.  Taste: a subdued hop bite. Malt and coffee and cola--the carbonation gives it an almost soda-like quality, in a good way. 8.2% alcohol is barely perceptible until you feel the warmth come up from your belly.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation tickle nicely complements the hop sizzle. Smooth, slightly creamy.  Drinkability: Excellent for a normal beer, outstanding for an 8.2% alcohol beer.

72,224,Gehrig,4.38,"Positively outstanding in flavor, this beer is an unusual amalgam of wheat and dopplebock rife with complexity. When I first saw it, I was concerned that the diverse malts and styles would tug the beer in opposite directions. Not so. The smooth texture and rich, fruity, caramel flavors adhere very nicely, allowing the fruity caramel of the dopplebock to interact well with the wheat hop side. Two great tastes that taste great together! The presentation is sterling, with three full fingers of frothy goodness resting atop a slightly cloudy walnut brown body. The scents and flavors are rich and variegated, with berries, caramel, a little coffee and chocolate, and a hint of bananas combining with good wheat hops. There is a slightly syrupy taste that arrives in the middle, but the dense flavoring outweighs that.  Really worth trying, and a surprisingly pleasant admixture of styles that work well.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

I'm really glad I didn't write the review that night -- something told me to wait.  Pours a dark red-brown, cloudy from all the yeast, big off-white head that faded quickly with little lacing. Heavy raisiny malts in the nose with some funky yeast spice and fruity wheat tartness (like sour bananas). Don't know that I've ever smelled a beer quite like it (well, this might be the only weizenbock I've ever tried). Tastes so good -- I'm getting roasted malts (chocolate, coffee, roasted nuts), that tart wheat flavor, the spicy phenols, the stewed fruits, and the warming alcohol. Big mouthfeel -- sticky and syrupy, but that feels right, and it finishes decently dry for the size of the body. I could sip this every night for the rest of my life. I need to invest in a case.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

S - sweet complex blend of spices, fruits and yeast in the aroma.  T - flavor is also very complex, slight bitterness on the finish.  M - medium bodied, not heavy at all, light carbonation feel.  D - a good brew to drink slow and savour.  Final Note: I have to get one of those Aventinus glasses!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,redmagik99,4.47,"Pours a dark brown with a slight orange tint. Biggish head that recedes rather quickly. General banana/clove smell of german wheat beers, with a significant extra something spicy. The taste never fails to baffle me with its complexity and deliciousness. Very malty and sweet for sure, but what it is that makes it so amazing, I do not know. Is there some black cherry in there? Maybe some toffee..Moderate to high carbination. Hops help to balance with a bit of bitterness but no noticable hop flavor, which doesn't take away from it at all. You would guess it had an above average abv based on the thickness alone, but its so tasty that it doesn't take away from the drinkability. I'm just thankful that one of the best german beers is one of the easiest to find as well.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,CharlieMopps,4.62,"Vintage 2003  A: From the moment the liquid hit the glass, a noisy head began to rise, that was actually larger than I had expected from a four year old beer. Eventually, the off-white bubbles settled down to a mere whisp on top. When held to light, the beer itself displayed a transparent, Brazilian cherry wood brown, hints of garnet present giving it a rather unique appearance.  S: Lots of clove and spice in the nose, with the phenolic bubblegum and banana notes playing a more subdued role. The scent of alcohol is a lot more assertive than I recall when drinking it fresh. The bouquet piques my interest as to how the beer has aged and hints at what flavors have come forth over time.  T: Definitely a lot more of the spiciness and clove features on the palate, while, as the bouquet indicated, the alcohol was also more pronounced. However, it wasn't overbearing, but rather complemented the spicy notes and crescendoed toward the finish. Aftertaste is a residue of malt and somewhat of an echo of spice, hard to explain, but it comes back in a faint way after the peppery finish has subsided.  M: Due to the aging, the mouthfeel has lost its crisper edge of course, but this is not such a bad thing. Any weizen normally will have a rather light body and thin quality to its texture, and this one is merely a more relaxed version of the original. Carbonation is still more than I had expected from the head formation.  D: Quite drinkable, as much as it ever was, but flavors drop off a bit, which is to be expected. On a side note, swirling the yeast at the bottom and adding just a bit brought out some more phenolic character that was rather interesting. Overall, I found this aged version to be enjoyable, but it may have been even better after only a year or so, rather than four. Still, an interesting experiment with tasty results.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,smurphy77,4.7,"Great beer. Was poured a sample from draft on the recommendation of the bartender (I asked for something bold and/or extreme).  Poured a light caramel color with a big foamy head. One sip and I was blown away. The big head gives way to a blast of banana aroma and flavor. The fruitiness is complemented by a distinctive toffee/caramel sweetness. This beer melts in your mouth. The finish is sweet with a trace of alcohol, just enough to let you know you're drinking a beer and not a dessert from iron chef.  Fantastic beer.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,InsolublePancake,4.02,"A- Pours an attractive hazy copper with a nice off-white head. The head mostly dissipates but about a quarter inch sticks around for the duration.  S- Most prominent are the banana and clove aromas that are typical for the style. Bready malt lies underneath, which indeed gives this beer a banana bread-like smell. As the beer warms, more aromas come into play, such as caramel and an unmistakable wheat twang. Quite a lot going on in the aroma.  T- More banana and clove along with a nice malt backing. Some chocolate joins the other flavors, adding some nice complexity. A touch of earthy hop bitterness appears at the finish.  M- Decent medium body, not overly carbonated. Smooth and kind of creamy.  D- This is a fairly rich beer and is kind of high in alcohol, so I think I'll have to stop at one.  What can I say, it's a classic. Although the style is not my favorite, I can appreciate a good beer when I taste one, and this is a good beer. It's even a favorite of one of my macro-drinking friends.

Smell is some caramel malts...and maybe my nose is all screwed up, but do I smell freshly cut grass? I could swear that I do, but maybe my nose is having an off-day. All in all, muted, but nice-smelling.  Taste is of lightly burnt caramel and a grassy hop; some good banana esters make their presence known. A little creamy in feel. Really sits quite light on the palate, which I view as a major feat considering this beer's strength. Indeed, the mouthfeel is nearly unrivaled.  This shouldn't be sessionable at all at this strength, but it damn well feels that way. File under ""Dangerous Beer."" This one's a winner.  Edit: I have to amend my review.

Again, alcohol is present (almost a little too much) however there is a slightly sweet chocolate taste, its very subtle, but there. Overall good balance and leaves a bread/grainy aftertaste as with many wheat beers. Moderate carbonation leaves more of a crisp feel to the drink which I felt was enjoyable.

Label stated the element of chocolate in the taste but I couldn't find it.  Mouthfeel - Medium body; the carbonation expands greatly while tasting the beer. Interesting feeling afterwards.

Did I mention malt? Dont really smell the abv, though there is something crisp about the smell. Is crisp a smell?  Smells much more malty than the taste. Initial is a bit uninspiring. Was expecting something more pungent considering the envigorating smell. Ending is nice. A bit malty, but nothing that catches me. Maybe Im missing something. Its a bock, yes. I guess I dont understand the style difference from other bocks.  A bit smooth, better than the carbonation looks. Like most other bocks.  I gotta go average here.

More sweet spiciness than intense spiciness- somewhat peppery but mostly cinnemon. Hops? I'm not really sure but I can taste bitterness which rounds out the sweet spice.

72,224,hustlesworth,4.14,"the purple label makes this look like a fruit beer rather than a weizenbock. in fact, the overall character of this beer was more like a belgian dark ale. very fruity and full of subtle nuances, not the malt flavor only bock i expected.  A- fizzy active beige head makes lots of noise then becomes cloud-like and puffy for a minute before settling down to nothing. after 10 minutes it looks like a glass of flat cola, but it's not flat, it's not even close. the bubbles are still rising. brew was transparant until i swirled in some of that yeast in the bottom. it was dark like drips of melted chocolate and it gave the mahogany beer a gentle haze with amber highlights.  S- dark fruit (prune, raisin) fortified wine, berry, tea-like malt, alcohol warmth, VERY mild coffee, wheat bread, and a floral nectar sweetness that lingers in the nose.  T- initially mild and sweet then when you swallow there's a rush of flavor on the back of your tongue like a raisin bran muffin on PCP. the malt stands out here with the fruity esters of the yeast, barley taste gets toasty as it finishes mingling with a grainy hop and burnt raisin cookie aftertaste, also accompanied with some clove/nutmeg spiciness as the label suggested.  MF- juicy and highly carbonated. velvety body with a powdery yeast feel, leaves the mouth feeling somewhat medicated, which isn't a bad thing.

The appearance is lovely, very dark with a ruby tint to it, and a big, fluffy, off-white head much like many other german wheat beers. The carbonation is very evident when you look at the beer.  It smells wonderful, big, malty, fruity, and full of yeast. Similarly the taste is malty and yeasty, with heavily fruity and clovelike flavors in addition to the yeast and malt. There is little hop presence, but that is not a drawback in this case.  The mouthfeel is good, but a tad overcarbonated at times, and rather viscous in spite of that fact. Likewise the drinkability is less than that of some beers, due largely to the thick, sweet, malty character of this brew as well as the higher than average alcohol content.  Excellent for a cool-weather wheat beer, a celebratory treat, or just whenever for lovers of big malty beers, this is one of my all time favorite German beers and one I often share with friends just beginning to discover the world of fine beers.

S: Chocolate, smoky hickory, sweet but not overly so. Undertones of butter and cream, and a hint of what seems to be nutmeg and clove. On second inspection, I can smell something citrus like tangerine. A hint of alcohol shows through, but not in an offensive way. Overall a very pleasant smell. I'm practically drooling waiting to try it.  T: Initially surprisingly mild, but the taste builds up very quickly to a sweet and chocolaty roast. Reminds me slightly of chocolate roasted coffee. The flavors blend extremely well, to the point where it's hard to separate them. The rich smokiness is on top of everything, but hides nothing. Surprisingly light for how pungent and rich it is. Spicy carbonation and slight bitterness linger for a while after swallowing. I think I detect a hint of banana and tangerine again in the aftertaste somewhere.

Anybody jaded by the proliferation of insipid wheat beers lately is in for a real surprise with this ale- it definately hits above it's weight. Go get some. NOW.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,Poser,4.45,Pours a deep brown with good lacing from the creamy top. Fruity and spicy aroma with a clear alcohol presence. The alcohol is covered better in the taste and is more dry fruit and carbonation. Also a tad bit of caramel flavor that goes down smooth and creamy. Remarkably drinkable and smooth for the ABV.  This one just may have made it to my top 10 list. (It's a short list overall -- I live in Alabama).,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Temporary lacing spiderwebs down the glass, and halfway thought he head has vanished. The aroma is lovely, dark caramels, the yeast is delicious, cloves, spices, some apple cider on the brown sugar side, some chocolate, and a faint hint of banana.  The taste is equally scrumptious, a handful of flavors rolling around each other in perfect balance. There are spices of pepper and clove, faint apple and banana through the finish, faint chocolate, some brown sugar and raisin. Its hard to pick out, because they are so well infused. The body is pretty full, warming (8%? really?), just enough carbonation.

Very filling and better for a nice autumn refresher.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Smell is classic and very aromatic with lots of ""banana nut bread"" hints of spice and fruit from yeast not exactly fermentation temps? Hops are not very present in the aroma, the yeast backed by malt are really the showcase of this beer. Flavor is very rich and malt forward hops are are not very present in the flavor other than a contribution of bitterness. Yeast has played quit a large role in shaping the taste of this beer which is very nice. As mentioned in the smell clover banana nut bread with a touch of sourness toward the finish.

Almost seams to glow. Amazing.  Fruity and spicy. Deep plum and cherry, clove and cinnamon. It's hard not just to stick your face in this one.  Goes down with the smoothness of a classic bock (like say Celebrator), but has the deep spicy character of your favorite dunkel-weise. Almost chocolatey, but never syrupy or too sweet. Alcohol is amazingly well-hidden. I would have guessed this was ridding around 4% ABV.  Feels great in the mouth, like a classic german weisen. Usually the mouth feel is my favorite part of the wheat beer experience, but this one lacks the rich coat your mouth feeling of a straight weise.  A bit hearty to drink this one all night, and eventually you want to switch to something different. But to it's credit you can start or finish your night with this one and be equally satisfied.

Good retenetion, thin but steady lace. Spicy, yeast aroma with a bit of malt sweetness. First taste is peppery and spicey like a hefe, with a bit of citrus.

Smell - A bit of an astringent aroma. The esters are quite pronounced and provide the alcoholic nose. A bit of a fruity presence as well, along with some underlying caramel.  Taste - So very smooth. This brew has a very mild in taste but has a good bit of complexity. A good spicy clove body with a clean dry finish.  Mouthfeel - The carbonation is suprisingly light. This keeps the density in the mild realm.  Drinkability - The ease that this went down is both it's strength and it's weakness. I could very easily down another of these with great ease.

Smell is thick with the wheat yeast and a great aroma of plums, chocolate and a hint of grapes. Taste is unbelievable, like the best hefes. Plums, pears and other dark fruit hit your moth hard and the yeast follows up with a welcome peppery bite before a wheaty-oat bread aftertaste leaves you with a nice dry finish. Alcohol isn't overly noticeable but does a nice job of warming as it goes down.

Luckily the taste is stronger than the aroma is. Mouthfeel is medium/full with a lot of carbonation, but the carbonation works in this beer very well. Drinkability is pretty good, the beer goes down smooth and is easy to drink. The alcohol is pretty well hidden considering it's 8.2% ABV. I think this is a very good beer, I'm impressed with it.

I must say with all the hype around it, it definatly lived up to my expectations. This is a supremely great beer in a class all its own.  A - Pour was extremely energetic and full of live. Great dark brown cloudy, hazelnut color. Huge off white, tannish color head billowed over the top creating a pillow like cloud over the glass. Superior retention, as the head stayed for what seemed like forever. Great lace throughout the entire session dripped down the glass. Look was pretty much perfect.  S - Aroma was intense, but had alot of subtleness as it warmed an was able to let itself go. Lots of fruitness was evident in the predominant wheat and yeast smell. Peaches, bananas and perhaps some plum were picked up. Lots of spiceness and hints at a fall or winter type aroma. Smell was light, nothing heavy at all.  M & T - First impression was simply wow. Great feel, soo silky smooth and light, and full of carbonation. Nothing overpowering at all, slight bit of warming from the alcohol, but nothing extreme or even distracting. The major flavor here was of course the wheat flavors, however there was a very complex mix of fruits and spices that played around on the palate. The just felt right, great glass.  D - Overall this was fantastic, drinkability superb and definatly one of the best beers I have ever had. I would put this up against and Belgian, any day. Really just a pleasure to drink.

It is yeasty and gives off sugary flavors. I also detect a bit of vanilla, but it's fading.  M- The body of the beer is thick without being offensive. It has a smoothness to it.  D- This is a wonderful beer. The only thing that didn't agree with me so much is the very apparent alcohol smell.

I'm rating this one based on the bottle, but I've also had it on draft in the States and Germany, and there's not a big difference between any of them...they are all world-class when fresh! This would easily be one of my ""five desert island"" brews. I used to enjoy many other German-style hefeweizens, but Aventinus has killed my enjoyment of most other ""regular"" hefes. I've had the Aventinus Eisbock on several occasions as well, but I enjoy this version the most. This has an incredible mixture of the classic German wheat beer flavors, while condensing them, yet not over-doing them. The spicy, clovey phenolics are in perfect harmony here.

72,224,trevorwideman,4.3,"500ml bottle from demcorhip, thanks so much Gavin! Poured into an Erdinger Weiss glass.  Vigorous pour produces a massive 2 inch yellow head, feisty carbonation, and a mruky brown-coloured brew with some copper and red highlights when held up to the light. Aroma is extremely bready and malty with lots of spices. Caramel/Vanilla/banana sweetness plays second fiddle to coriander, peppercorns, a bit of cardamom. Meatier spices such as rosemary and sage are quite evident as well.  Taste is full of the typical weiss flavours, only taken to the next level of intensity. Banana, pear, clove, nuts, caramel, vanilla, coriander, all combined in a liquid bread experience. Wow is the word here... Body is good and thick and heavy but a little more carbonated than I might like, a mild quibble. This is so drinkable for the strength, but a little dangerous because of it. I love this style, even though I've only had two examples in my life, a wonderful spring brew.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Boppar,4,"I poured a bottle into a Schneider und Sohn weizen glass.  At first, I poured it with the glass cocked at a 45 degree angle. When this truly spectacular head began to burst forth, I quickly tilted the glass further over, until it was damn near parallel to the floor. Eventually, I had to cease pouring, and completely dumbstruck, counted a whopping 8 fingers of fizzy, quickly fading head. I was able to fill the rest of the glass, which again, produced a legendary head, that sadly, did not stay. I had expected better head retention from a wheat beer.  Smells sweet, with fruity esters, bananas, maybe a little clove. Faint alcohol aroma. Not bad for eight points...  The taste is very sweet and rich. I was weirded out at first that it tasted almost exactly like a Hefeweizen, although it looked nothing like one. The standard Hefeweizen tastes are there: bananas, cloves, fruity esters, but there are also more subtle notes of caramel, and the banana-clove combo has the amp turned up to 11.  I wasn't a huge fan of the mouthfeel, to be honest. It was a bit too thin, and far too fizzy. it felt almost like a soda, and the 8% ABV combined with that amount of carbonation really made it almost uncomfortable to hold in my mouth for too long.  I imagine the drinkability is pretty good for this style (this is my first), although I personally would not want another one. I found the overall sweetness of this beer, and the intensity of the banana-clove taste to be just too much.  Based on what I have read about this style, this beer sounds like a great style example, but as I found, this is not my style.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Maerzen,4.2,"I really enjoyed this beer. Aggressive pour yielded lots of head -creamy but noticeable carbonation. Took longer than I expected for it to settle leaving light lace. Dark amber and cloudy in appearance. Sweet aroma in the nose. Familiar yeast taste of a wheat beer but with more sweet malt accompanying it. Hops and alcohol are present at the back. Yeast forward -Malt middle - slight Alcohol at the end. Very drinkable, especially at 8%. Will definitely have this again.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,BretSikkink,4.38,"Dark mahogany in color, pours the entire pint and nine ounces into Aventinus weizen glass with about two fingers of creamy head and great cascading lacing. Good volume on the lace, retention is good not perfect.  Sweet, dark ripe fruit countered with big caramel malt. Herbs and clove aroma as well, with a hint toward dextrin sweetness that also betrays a hint of pepper and alcohol.  Creamy full mouthfeel with the great lace buffer and good carbonation, easy to put down without being overwhelemed but complex enough to contemplate. There's a flash of yeasty German weissbier that contributes strong alcohol, clove and herbal flavors along with some fruit characters. Banana and dextrin lightness mix in with figgy darkness.  So tasty and easy to drink. The alcohol is very apparent for which I dropped drinkability and flavor from a five, but only half a point since it remains so flavorful.  Couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this yet, it's widely available at better beer stores and I've loved it since the first one. Huge wheat beer, no lack of flavor.

The flavour...Wow, just look up the word complex in the dictionary and you will see some Aventinus being decanted. This Beer has flavours of cloves, raisins, bananas, dates, and prunes. There isn't much hop influence. The high gravity of this Beer is given away in its flavour.  The mouthfeel is as smooth as silk, and I was surprised that it wasn't very gassy.

Nose deep in the head, fruits and banana and clove. Some alcohol noticable, but not much for 8.0% T: Spectacular weizenbock, creamy and nice carbonation. Spicy, cloves dominant. Clean finish to me, great lingering flavors, fruits. M: Very creamy, very smooth. Little bite as you first take it in. D: Stunned its %8. Goes down very easily, very smooth.

72,224,BWH3,4.69,"Aventinus 750mL Bottle served at 40-45 F from Goblet  Appearance: Pours a dark, fairly clear brown. Golden brown at the edges when held to light. Effervescent carbonation that destroys the head fairly quickly for a wheat beer.  Smell: Banana, spicy phenols, cocoa, toffee/burnt caramel sweetness, earthy hops. Fruity esters typical of weisse beers is quite prominent. No alcohol. The carbonation just leads the complex aroma to the nose with intensity.  Taste: Roasted malts giving a raisin like sweetness accompanied by banana esters and cocoa or toffee notes. Wheat sharpness present but not dominating. Noble, and spicy hops finish nicely. Hops prevelant compared to doppelbock or weisse beers. A spicy yeast phenols sting the throat at the end letting you know this one is bottle conditioned.  Mouthfeel: Richer and heavier than anticipated given appearance and carbonation. Still light enough to make the beer quite drinkable.  Drinkability: Either way -- one nice and slow or a massive stein to quench your thirst, appetite, and mind -- this beer is a true gem. I think reguardless of personal preference everyone will enjoy a bottle of this beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

T- Very fruity, lots of banana, clove, citrus, bread&gt;very nice  M- medium bodied, carbonation is persistent but not over the top, very well done.  D- Very enjoyable. Could definately have a few of these with a nice turkey dinner and not feel stuffed after.  Overall i recommend this. The flavor is very distinct&gt;awsome",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,kajerm,4.4,"Bottle with a dignfied, Teutonic-looking label. Pours dark brown and cloudy with a golden ring of haze at the edges. It's a beautiful beer, and it'd have an easy five for appearance if it could retain a head without a forced pour-- maybe the high ABV kills the weizen head?  There is a powerful aroma of banana custard esters, malts, and spices. Alcohol is almost if not entirely undetectable Smells like a hefeweizen with all the knobs turned up to 11.  Opens up with roasted malts that grow mid-palate, along with heavy esters and malted wheat. Malty and estery flavors give way to crisp noble hops on the finish. Pretty hoppy for a german wheat beer, but it suits the flavor profile perfectly. Spicy phenols (and maybe alcohol) are also show up at various times. Definitely more weizen than bock, and that's not a bad thing.  The mouthfeel is heavy, laden with yeast and some crisp carbonation. Even at 8% ABV, it's as poundable as any wheat beer on Earth.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,MusicmanSD,3.88,"Love the purple label, makes the bottle stick out on a shelf. This pours a dark ruby color with slightly off white head that just billows in my hefe glass. Just from the 16.9 oz. bottle it felt like I had to do a Guinness pour just to get the whole damn bottle in the glass. Good off the bat. The smell has a whisk of alcohol to it already and this is dead ""bock"" cold, and it shows in the taste right after the immediate sip is taken. Has alot of character to it underneath though, its just the alcohol masks it fairly heavily unfortunately... ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE WHEAT INFLUENCE!!! The mouthfeel is quite good, and makes for an interesting mix of wheat ale character and bock sweetness. A very interesting beer, however not my style. Well...not yet at least. I recommend it as something every BA should try.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BlueHammer,4.58,"This beer has a deep brown opaque color. It has strong fruit smell, particular bananas and some slight prune overtones. The beer is moderately carbonated but that is balanced with the strong banana flavor. It was served on-tap with a slight head that left moderate lacing that did not stay long. The taste is sweet through and through, giving it a balanced flavor. It has a smooth taste and finish. An excellent on-tap selection.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,nathanho,4.6,"A - 500 ml serving pours muskeg (Alaskan for peat bog) water brown with a lot of fizzy cream soda head that all but disappears; if you let it sit and warm awhile it takes on a bit of a 'brandy in a snifter' quality. Second pour produces an opaque fog.  S - Banana bread, wheat and pleasant pure alcoholic nose...raisins & big cloves; doughier on second, swirled pour.  T - More bananas, more bread, malt, roasted grain, raisins, dominating cloves...walnuts; mild, waltzing alcohol. To say that this is a beer with flavor would be to say that the Marianas Trench is deep. Swirling bottom contents on second pour infuses yeast and dough.  M - Smooth but not too viscous, carbonation persistent, slightly astringent; if left to sit and warm it takes on a bit of a 'brandy in a snifter' quality; second cloudy pour is more viscous, less astringent than 'slightly astringent'.  D - Worth a few numbers around the dance floor until you need to take a cab home; this girl can dance.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,montageman,4.77,"Poured into a Weizen glass. The color is a nice deep, dark amber that has about 1 finger worth of head to start, but that disappears quickly leaving no lacing; lots of carbonation bubbles as well. The smell is dominated by clove and banana with a slight roasted character as well. The taste is huge on banana & the spicy clove character as well and the finish is dry and slightly citrusy - a perfect dessert beer. This is a well carbonated beer, but a little more creaminess and this would be better off. This beer is absolutely delicious & a wonderful example of what this style (and beer in general) should strive to be. Highest recommendation.",Schneider Weisse G.

T- Strong Banana-Clove, very sweet, but finishes dry and spicy.  M- Very fizzy, as the style dictates. Some alcohol warming, but no burn.  D- For a higher alcohol beer, I enjoy this beer very much. It will taste good, long after I should have stopped.  I have enjoyed this beer over the years, both in the US and in Germany. It is the epitome of the style, weizenbock, in my humble opinion. There is none better!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Banana from the wheat, bread from the malt: literally smells exactly like banana bread.  T: The taste follows the smell but carries some spiciness and a hint of maple syrup. The 8.2% alcohol becomes apparent as the beer warms.  M: This beer strikes a balance between the warmth of the alcohol and the refreshingness that comes with any good weissbier. Leaves the mouth a bit sticky though.  D: Less drinkable than a hefeweizen, more drinkable than a doppelbock, imagine that! Wish there was a 4.25 for this category, but gave it the benefit of the doubt.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,mpyle,3.88,"Very nice appearance with a clear amber color capped with a huge creamy white head.  The typical weizen clove phenolic is evident in the aroma, but competes for attention with a fruity/candy kind of sweetness.  Bubble-gum sweet flavor with some alcohol undertones. No discernible hop, and settles gently into a sweet, slightly spicy finish.  Brutally carbonated, but that is in the style. Medium to med-full body, with minimal alcohol warming - alcohol character very well controlled for an 8% ABV beer. No astringency, and very nice on the tongue in general.  I personally wouldn't throw back a bunch of these (too sweet, and too much alcohol), but a pleasant to drink, big wheat beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,jettjon,4,"Poured from a 500ml bottle stamped 06-310-1-1 into a pint glass. Dark red-brown color with a slight haze and moderate fine carbonation. Two-finger whitish-tan head fades slowly to a thick cap, leaving minor lacing. Nose is moderately malty, very sweet and fruity, with a hint of grapefruit and a powerful clove presence. Tasting the beer, the cloves are right up front and in-you-face; fortunately, the nose prepares you for this. Sweet malt follows, fading to a more mellow malt toward the middle, along with warming, crisp alcohol, more spice and a bit of caramel, finally ending on a dry, wheaty note. Pretty complex flavor hereId rate it higher but I feel that cold or warm, the cloves dominate a bit too much. Mouth is heavily carbonated which nicely complements the clove flavor, though the carbonation smooths out and the malt asserts itself. Still, its nicely ful and bubbly throughout, with middle viscosity; overall, its very smooth and creamy. Drinkability is excellent overall, though you wont be chugging this due to the heavy carbonation. Theres only hints of the 8.2% ABV, so watch that; otherwise, its a very well balanced and drinkable brew.  Overall: A dunkel-weizen bock? First Ive tried, and its damned good. A good example of a sort of off-the-wall style, and a must-try for even the mildly obsessive completist.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,udubdawg,4.29,"500 ml bottle  pours hazed dark amber/brown. Managed to keep the sediment in the bottle this time. Pretty thick creamy-looking very light tan head without too much retention and leaves little lace. Quite a few lines of carbonation steadily rising from the bottom of the glass.  Nose is big on fruit, clove, and alcohol. A nice overall spiciness. Which fruit? - I'd say apple and banana with conviction, and maybe plum and raisin, not sure - I was having little trouble at first, but as it warms I'm noticing more and more alcohol.  Tasty to say the least. Quite sweet. Caramel malts present, and some wheat and clove as well. Note that for all the alcohol strength in the aroma it was barely noticeable in the flavor. If not for a bit of too much sweetness (but thankfully short of cloying) in the aftertaste, I might rate this a 5 on taste.  interesting - this enters my mouth creamy soft smooth...but I swallow, and the carbonation explodes into the finish and seems to drive the flavors into my palate - I'll be tasting this for a while. Overall, a very pleasant experience.  Drinkability is limited only by availability, bank account balance, and alcohol tolerance. Strange that the Eisbock is available in Kansas but not this better original. This is one of the first beers I grab when visiting KC to bring back here. Not my favorite, but still among the must-haves.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The head takes FOREVER to drop to a 1/4"", and there is some nice lacing thanks to the wheat.  Smell is more towards clove and spice, but a bit of banana and other fruit is in there too.  Taste is yummy sweet malt, like candy, but nicely balanced by the prickly carbonation, spice and touch of hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is full, and there is a soothing alcohol warmth, but the carbonation keeps things refreshing.  Drinkability is above average, but the alcohol and sweetness hold it back from getting a higher rating.  A treat to say the least - the clove and spice is just right for me.

72,224,Georgiabeer,4.55,"Pours dark chestnut with a thin head that fades pretty quickly. The smell is of wheat that is reminiscent of wasa crackers with a sweet rounded malt and a nice yeastiness. Beautifully balanced flavor of alcohol, malt, prunes, figs, cereal grain, and a touch of cellared apples. Very creamy and with a medium body that is just right to support the alcohol and flavors.

It reminds me of everything I love about the big, dark belgians, but with a German twist.  Here's my thoughts on it: After a proper pour with a thick head, Aventinus has an aroma of dried fruit like raisins and dates backed by the malted wheat. The flavor expands on those fruit flavors, adding a bit of clove spice and banana, the hallmark flavors of German wheat beers. At 8.2% abv, theres no doubt this is a heavy drink. But the fine bubbles and velvety mouthfeel make Aventinus a tough brew to put down.  I've tasted more complex beers, but this one is still pretty good and pretty drinkable. I have to wonder what some aging would do.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The smell definitely gives away its wheat nature. The taste has more roast than the smell, with an almost charcoal-like bit up front. But not in a bad way. If that makes sense. The sweetness comes through next, with a bit of fruit but then a surprisingly dry finish. The mouthfeel includes a healthy carbonation followed by a viscous oily feel. Very nice indeed.

Minimal but pleasant aftertaste. M: Very smooth and thick, though the carbonation level lightens the feel up a bit. D: Drinkable anyday at anytime. But session? I took three of these down during my fantasy football draft and nearly ended up drafting Don Mattingly....perhaps not.  I was introduced to this beer back in 1998 and have never looked back.

Deep wheat malt burst with spicy clove undertones. A almost chocolate, caramel malt quilty in the wheat. A bananna and pear like fruityness joins in and blends very nicely with the spice. A very subtle alcohol note joins the party. Mouthfeel- A little more carbonated than I would have liked but not terrible. A medium body, maybe a little more feel than I'm used to for wheats.

Appearance Pours a deep, clear, colour, almost as dark as mahogony. A one finger pale tan head formed on the pour. The mildly carbonated brew produced a very thin collar of lacings.  Aroma Rich aromas of wheat and barley malts. Nutty whole wheat, hints of banana, toffee, and the rich aromas of dark fruits, dates prunes, raisins, all overtop of a hint of cocao. A mild grassiness from the hops is also evident.  Taste Much like the nose, a rich whole wheat, nutty, banana bread with dark fruits incuded as above, with a touch of cocao powder thrown in for even more richness and complexity. The mild hops add an additional layer of flavour to this rich brew with their mild, understated grassy and decaying leaf character.  Mouthfeel A rich, smooth, almost creamy brew, loaded with wheat and barley malt. Well balanced according to style, with a pleasing hop accent at the finish. This medium to full bodied brew gave some alcohol warmth as it was savoured.  Drinkabilty An excellent, decadent sipper. Great for a winter night, or to sustain onself throughout lent. Also a truely great example of a wheat beer, and how wheat beers can be as rich and full in flavour as any all barley brews. Best wheat beer I've had the pleasure of enjoying yet.

I get a decent amount of sweet grape, like a candy flavor, and apples. There is also a distinct yeast aroma.  Taste. Great flavors, more fruits, but is heavier and darker flavor. apples, little bit of peaches, and just the slightest touch of prunes. Cloves have a nice appearance. The bottle says it will have a little chocolate taste in it, and i suppose i taste that as well.

Mouthfeel. carbonation is high and lively. though at 8% alc, this one is still relatively light and refreshing. the bubbles really attack the tongue.

72,224,mithrascruor,4.65,"500 mL bottle poured into a mug.  Appearance: Pours a nice glowing and slightly hazy dark brown/red color. The thick off-white head seems to constantly bubble, and it just looks really tasty.  Smell: Fruity, spicy, malty, and yeasty. Ripe bananas are the predominant fruit, but apples and raisins are there too. Spices seem to be cloves and brown sugar.  Taste: Great malty flavor that's a bit sweet. Bold, yet by no means overbearing. The fruits and spices come out mostly towards and in the aftertaste, and are the same as those in the smell.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and smooth, with a nice crispness and carbonation feel.  Drinkability: Tastes great, but the flavor can get tedious if consumed quickly, so take it easy. The strong alcohol isn't noticable at all in the taste.  Though it was an obvious guess, I didn't believe it before I tried it: it really tastes and smells like something of a cross between a weissbier and a doppelbock! Very unique and I really enjoy it.

Tan off colored head that receeds quickly to leaves a small amount around the ring of the glass...no lacing noted.  A definite fruity malty odor to this one that was pleasing to say the least  tastes of sweet raisins on the initial swig followed by that 8% ABV kick and then some very balanced malts.

Malt is dominant, however the warming alcohol seems to balance quite nicely. Complex and exceptional.  M: Full bodied. Slick and syrupy on the tongue. However, there is a pleasant softness due to the wheat; and a crispness due to the considerable carbonation.  D: Drinkability overall is good. Soft yet crisp mouthfeel makes this feel almost like a session brew. However, the high ABV limits it. I almost wish it felt more like a sipping beer. Either way it's damn good.

72,224,jmalex,3.91,"I was fortunate enough to be able to purchase a sweet Aventinus glass recently, so immediately I needed something to put inside it. Not surprisingly, I opted for the logical choice.  APPEARANCE: Poured into aforementioned glass a golden brown with slight rusted-colored tones, on top of which sat a huge, pillowy off-white head. A layer of foam lasts until the very end, and it leaves a few small patches of lace down my glass.  SMELL: Very yeasty and very banana-y! Whew, it smells like someone put some banana flavored candy in my beer. Some spice is also present (clove?). The whole aroma is very complex and flavorful, but very up front and in your face.  TASTE: Much more rounded out than the smell. Clove is much more pronounced, now outshining the banana. The taste is quite yeasty, with the banana and clove entering as the beer crosses my palette. The finish is fruity and sweet, if not a bit dry.  MOUTHFEEL: Smooth and easy. Perhaps a little undercarbonated for my liking.  DRINKABILITY: The alcohol hits you a bit, but despite that, I only have half my beer left. It certainly goes down easy enough, but I don't know if I'd have another.  This is a great beer and worthy of being at the top of its style, but it leaves me wishing for a bit more. Perhaps I'm spoiled having such access to a beer like this, or perhaps it's just has qualities that are inherent to the style that I wish it didn't. Probably a combination of both. I really like this beer, though. I just don't love it.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,travelfrog,4.92,"One of my favorite beers of all time. I've tried this many times, both in the bottle (and years later on tap) at the Schneider Brewery's flagship restaurant in Munich. As you would expect, it was served in the distinctive narrow bottomed, wide-mouthed Aventinus glass.  Appearance is very dark brown, with a purplish tinge. Excellent, long-lasting head.  The thought of the aroma still brings a smile to my face. Chocolate-molasses with a bit of wheat thrown in for good measure.  The flavor is outstanding, sweet and malty with strains of more traditional weizen beer. (UPDATE: I should have said, Bavarian dunkeles weizen, i.e., ""yes, we have no bananas..."" ;o) Smooth, sweet finish.  Mouthfeel is very nice, with the excellent texture and carbonation tickling the roof of your mouth. Maybe the slightest bit sticky.  This brew is dangerously drinkable, as it's difficult to notice you're drinking a high-alcohol content beverage unless you've read the label. Use caution. ;)",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,MrHurmateeowish,4.28,"Brown bottle from Florian's. Hazy/murky brown body with a couple inches of more of light tan amazingly creamy-looking head. Pretty agressive carbonation in this one. Banana dominates the aroma with hints of smoke, spice, citrus and yeast. Banana, spice, and hints of smoke and nut comprise the flavor. Fairly clean finish with just a hint of cloves on the tounge. Creamy mouthfeel that isn't sticky or syrupy at all IMO. Alcohol is also barely noticeable, best as I can tell. This beer is great - like a Hef, only more complex, tasty, and satisfying. Superb. I can see this beer having a regular place in my DBF.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Jwaks,4.15,"Serving : 500ml bottle  Pours with hazy dark murky brown color with a very fine, dense glowing white head that's half a finger thick. Strangely no lacing is left behind and little carbonation can be noted through the murky body.  Loads of bubblegum, banana, wheat, and a hint of clove and sour apple come through on the nose.  Banana, wheat and clove flavors hit the palate upon entry leading to a solid malty bubblegum flavored mid palate wrapped up with a semi-sweet finish featuring sour apple, clove and a touch of wheat. The generous dose of alcohol is well hidden by other more interesting flavors.  This medium bodied brew's mouthfeel is tight and slick, with adequate grip on the finish. An overall sweet and sour wheat character with little to balance keeps drinkability closer to average.  A great traditional weizenbock!  Cheers!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Absumaster,4,"This beer is brown, red with a thick, creamy head that is very stablile.  Smell is defenitally wheat with fenols from the yeast. Some caramel and vanilla, great ripe banana smell.  Taste is fenolic and dry, with some exotic fruits, ripe bananas most of all. The wheat is very apparent and makes the beer very mild and gives a very soft mouthfeel. Body is full, but very drinkable. A good, decent Weizenbock with a good balance.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,kenito799,4.17,"16.9 oz bottle, poured into a tall pilsener glass.  Pours a massive, rocky off-white head that recededs very slowly, no lacing. Hazy deep dark golden brown brew.  Aroma is chock full of banana-weizen, very yeasty scents, a touch of cinnamon spiciness in the nose. Possibly a bit more malt on the nose than a hefeweizen but I am not sure. As it warms even more birch beer notes come in.  Mouthfeel, very fizzy carbonation, lots of bubbles, some tart dryness in the finish. Taste is very much hefeweizen crisp and refreshing, with more caramelized roasty maltedness on the midpalate and the finish, when the tart tannins come in. Some dry cocoa and plum flavors next. Cloves (lots of long-lasting cloves) and cinnamon-sugar toast are the really nice flavors in the finish. To me, that palate-smacking tannic finish detracts from the drinkability just a bit--it's just very very, dry. I can easily believe that this is a perfect example of this style. Very happy to try it, and I will jump at the chance to order this on tap if the opportunity ever presents itself. Really complex brew with a lot going on.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,strangefate,4.35,"500ml bottle.  Pours a dark cloudy brown with a hint of amber. Has a huge tan head that dissipates rather quickly, but leaves great lacing. Aroma and taste are both sweet, wheaty, and almost spicy. Hints of banana are present in the taste as well. Medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. The sweetness of this may be too much to drink a six pack of, but it's something you'll want to sip and savior anyway.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Torchiest,4.77,"Poured a 500ml bottle into 20oz oktoberfest glass.  Dark ruddy brown with a decent beige head that faded quickly.  Smells sweet, fruity, clove notes, chocolatey, unique yeast aroma.  Very sweet front, melts into this indescribable mix of immense depth. Currant, chocolate, slight banana flavor, clove, more fruit, nice mellow bitterness, fades into a glorious and long lasting port wine finish.  Fantastic creaminess mixed with solid bite from carbonation which balances quite well. Lots of warmth throughout that is just right.  I could guzzle this all night long, and I have in fact gotten into trouble with it a few times because it is so easy to drink. I want to savor it, and yet I can't get enough. Definitely one of the best beers on Earth.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,bluegrassbrew,3.7,"This was my first weizenbock. Had it a Pazzo's in Lexington. Pours a nice looking dark brown color with a slight head. Smells much like a hefe but one that was injected with alcohol. Normal bannanas and citric sweetness. Taste much the same, but lots of heat on this one! Mild chocolate as it warms. Overall very interesting but I thought the alcohol over powered this brew a bit much for me.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,umustdrink,4.42,"A - Dark brown color, slightly orange around the corners of the weizen glass. Head recedes rather quickly to a quarter inch.  S - Smell is slightly malty, pretty sweet with very fragrant grape notes.  T - Sweet wheat flavor with a caramel-y malt aftertaste. Dark fruit notes. Faint alcohol sensation.  M - Somewhat thick consistency, a little syrupy. Otherwise smooth.  D - Very tasty beer, could be a benchmark for the style.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,treedoctor5002,3.63,The head on this puppy is huge! It took me a few pours to get it all into my hefewiezen glass. It's pretty cool to see all of these tiny bubbles screaming from the bottom to the top of my glass. Color is a dark brown. This bottle went flat pretty quickly. Not sure if that is normal or not. Smell is like bubble gum and then almost earthy. This is definitely a German brew. Taste is bananas and bubble gum without much hoppiness to it. Overall pretty sweet. A really distinctive beer. Different from anything I've ever had. Not sure if this is my style though. The 8% alcohol is hard to find here. Extremely drinkable. One 500ml bottle caught up to me quickly. I would recommend you try this beer.,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,GooberMcNutly,3.32,"Dark, rich and sweet. The wheat base to the bock gives it a tall, white rockey head and removed all astringency from the mouthfeel. Aromas of cloves and very, very slight banana and vanilla aspects. The malty bock backbone and lager fermentation suppress most of the yeasty/bready fresh aspects and give it some legs in the bottle.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Westsidethreat,4.18,"A: This will take two pours, as the head is out of control. Made up of sudsy, medium sized beige bubbles, I don't expect it to remain this large for much longer but it should last the entire brew in a smaller form. Body is quite an intriguing color; perhaps what a weiss beer with a brown crayon melted into it would look like with lots of unfiltered qualities to it.  S: I get campfire smoke thats been in clothes for a day. You know that smell? That and some banana, caramel, cloves and more spices.  T: Tangy banana liquor comes first with some lemon highlights along with it. Good base of brown sugary malt with hazelnuts and almonds. Very spicy, almost hints of pine or spruce which is imparted by the glorius yeast. As it warms, dark fruits prevail with rum raisin bringing a lick of alcohol. Finishes sweet with some wood tones and more banana esters.  M: Full mouthfeel, thick body with a fuzzy mouthfeel from the overcarbonation. But this is easilly solved with a few swirls of the glass.  D: Mighty fine brew, one that grows on you as the beer drains down the gullet. Great balance between banana and caramel. Inspired me to drink another German beer after this one.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,Greenfloyd,4.8,"Holy Goodnight what a beer...  Ahhemmm..I mean....Pours into a hefe-glass with a shaded redwood color, the stable and very present cloud of toasted ivory foam, hovers overhead. Warm banana spice cake tones find their way into your mind via the incredible nose of this Weizenbock. Malt and sweet plum flavors give way to a perfectly balanced, slightly tart, dark fruit finish. The mouth feel of this beer puts it over the top, giving it all the qualities of a incredibly crafted brew. The wheaty, medium bodied fresh finish lingers favorably until the next sip.

A - A light brown (maybe dark orange?) color with a HUGE head full of tiny bubbles. I've heard alot about this one, and it's lookin pretty serious.  S - Caramel, cloves, some toasted malts and tons of highly sweetened fruits.  T - I've had tons of wheat beers, tons of weizens, and quite a few doppel bocks. I've never had anything like this. Put it this way - take every thing you like about your favorite wheat beer, add in everything you like about your favorite dunkel or doppel, and kick it all up to 8.2% abv - it's amazing.  M - Lightly carbonated, but sooo smooth and rewarding. It seems to melt on your tongue like a perfectly cooked steak. It then leaves you with sweet sugary aftertastes. You really can't even tell how hot (alcohol wise) this beer really is. Simply fantastic.  D - I'm getting close to the end of the bottle, and I don't really know how many more of these I could tangle with. I feel like I could really enjoy this bottle in a quick manner - but no matter how great it tastes, you don't want to drink more than one.  I'd almost compare this to a desert wine - it's something that tastes extremely good, has some sweetness, but not something you're really want to ""over do it"" with.  Again, I simply can't stress how fine of an effort this beer is. Has to be the best German beer I've ever tasted, and I can't imagine anything in the future tasting any better than this.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,fank2788,4.08,"500ml bottle poured into a weizen glass It took about 5 minutes to get this poured, this beer was very foamy, but it was worth the wait and the effort. The color is dark chestnutty brown with a near white head that has amazing retention, the beer is fairly clear except for the bits of yeast floating around. The smell was at first dominated by wheat beer yeast, cloves and slight fruit notes. Once the head settles a bit some wheat, alcohol and dark malt begins to come through. The taste was much like the smell with the yeast flavors dominating to begin with, especially in the head, with everything blending together a bit after some time. There is a strong wheat beer aftertaste with this as well some alcoholic hotness with very little in the way of hop flavor. Mouthfeel is good highly carbonated with full body. This is a beer to be reckoned with, I doubt that there are many weizenbocks that resemble this one.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,weeare138,4.79,"Vintage 2001 bottle... Appears a dark chestnut brown with traces of red and a 2 finger, foamy tan head that slowly fades out. Little remnants of lace are left around the glass. Small chunks of spent yeast sit at the bottom like artifacts of shrapnel from a battle at sea. Smell is slightly oxidized but very acceptable for the age, along with mineral water, dusty, aged antiques, notes of port wine, rich brown sugar, raisins, prunes, and very phenolic with hints of cocoa & cloves. It holds it's own against any of the Belgian heavy hitters that you've been sitting on. Taste is of raisins, cloves, caramel, brown sugar...no trace of any wet cardboard with this 5+ year old bottle. Nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, mildly sweet, phenolic, and herbal. Seek this one out. It seems like the 2001 year is ripe and ready now. I recently had a vintage '99 bottle that hadn't held up nearly as nice as this one.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,sstackho,4.5,"Funny - my review will be right after the guy from Calgary with the Toronto FC avatar, and I have my season tickets all ready for their inaugural season!  500ml bottle purchased from LCBO in Toronto. Pours a slightly cloudy brown with a fair amount of carbonation. Very nice wheaty aroma. Taste is rich, complex and lovely and full of wheat and malt and a bit of spice. Great lingering aftertaste. I'm not one that is able to pick out a bunch of distinct tastes within the beer, so I won't even try... All I know is that this beer is wonderful!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,vanrassel,4.33,"This beer is a feast for the senses the moment your pour it. It filled my weizen glass to the top with a towering white head over a beautiful mahogany body. Lively carbonation zoomed from the bottom, adding compact white bubbles to the resilient head, which capped each sip with an attractive white ring.  Floral aromas mingled with banana, subtle roasted malt, and to a lesser extent, whiffs of chocolate and spice. The taste was sweet and malty and briefly interrupted by some alcoholic heat before a smooth end. This is a full-bodied  but not sticky  brew, and it finished crisp on the palate.  This is an easy-drinking beer despite the 8 per cent ABV, but is best enjoyed when it's sipped. Go slow and appreciate its greatness.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Gish,4.35,"Pours with a moderate head with very good retention. Looks dark but when held up to the light it is a cloudy amber color. Fairly intense carbonation that invites you to drink more. The smell is a strong spicy fruitiness. Very malty taste with bits of pepper, cloves, and banana showing through. The aftertaste is bitter but not overwhelmingly so. I could have a few of these, but the high alcohol level might limit that. Very enjoyable beer that I plan on getting again.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,bjoyce12,4.55,"I don't know what writing a review after 729 others will add, but why not. Aventinus is worth trying for the appearance and aroma alone. 500 ml bottle serving. Poured a deep, dark, opaque brown, almost black. Rich think foam head that lasted and reformed with each re-pour. Aroma is nothing short of a bouquet. Sensed flowers, dried fruit, especially figs and date. Light undertones of wheat and chocolate.  It tastes as it looks; no false advertising here. It's the closest to a St. Bernardus I have tried. Similar to a Dogfish 90, but heavier and richer. This is not one to have when you're having more than one.  It's taste and depth give it a hefty mouthfeel. Really want to take it slow to appreciate.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Metalmonk,4.32,"Maybe it's because I've been craving malty, high gravity beers lately, but this one hit the spot like never before. So freaking delicious.  It's difficult to try and pour this beer and not get a huge head. The head sizzled for a good while, made of tight, compact, small bubbles, and it retained extremely well after thinning a bit. The color is a bronzed rusty dark brown.  Smell reminds me of a Belgian tripel or dark ale in some ways: raisins, plums, other dark fruits, while having a few spices and lots of banana and bubble gum aromas wafting around. Slight yeast tweak and even a little nostril heat from the alcohol. Dive in:  Maltiness is high, but the sweetness never overwhelms. A little bit like a chocolate brownie, definitely banana, warming from the alcohol, tootsie roll, and raisins. Mouthfeel is tricky: very fizzy, sizzles about in the mouth, but also attains a creaminess that helps give the beer another layer of depth.  This is so utterly delicious, but it's a little ""hot"" for an 8-percenter, and maybe just a little far over on the desserty side to make it an everyday indulgence. Or, screw it, indulge. You only live once. Chalk another one up for the Germans.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,doubleipa,4.12,"About a three quarter inch head that was very frothy. I was suprised as to how murky the appearance was. Dark bread and hay aroma with some dough and moderate yeast.

72,224,Finite,4.25,"Looks great, little bit of light shining through but other than that its a healthy, dark ruby/brown.  Smell is of dark fruits and rasins, spices and some roast malt with a little floral hops.  Taste is wonderfull deep and thoughfull, dark fruits cover the palate and leave room for a little hop profile but not long before the alcohol hit comes in.  Smooth down the troat with a nice alcohol warmth.  A wonderful complex brew with a moderate alcohol hit. Beautiful",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Estarrio,4.28,"Poured dark, opaque copper with a three finger head. The fine, silky head retained quite well, including the grainy lacings.  Lots of fruity esters and spicy notes in the aroma, along with a bit of sweet malt and a touch of bubble gum. The spice profile includes pepper, clove, and coriander, while the esters include pear, plum and grapes.  The flavor is sweet malt up front that transitions into an earthy, wheat and yeast body. Banana, pear and apple esters, subtle bubble gum, spicy clove, pepper and anise make for a complex brew. The alcohol is nowhere to be found in the flavor.  The aggressive carbonation imparts a fizzy, almost creamy mouthfeel that is blissful on the palate.  The wonderful mouthfeel, balance, complexities and well-masked alcohol make this a very drinkable beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,86sportster883,4,The initially massive head has a sweet malty smell that is fruity (banana) and lightly spicy with hints of chocolate and some alcoholic aromas. The pour is crystal clear and a caramel color with red hues. The taste is primarily that of toasted malt with some toffee notes. The Aventinus is medium bodied with medium low carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. The finish remains malty but dries out nicely with a lingering hint of hop bitterness.

I love wheat beers, but sometimes I'm in the mood for something heavier....this is the best of both worlds. Smooth yeast aroma. Complex flavors...spice, cloves, banana. Not too fruity. And surprisingly creamy for a wheat beer, but still finishes crisp. Very full and chewy in the mouth...slightly malty. The only problem is a slight ethanol bite I get every few sips. Not an everyday beer, but amazing for special occasions.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The nose is what I'd expect from a Weizenbock ... wheat, sweet malt, and a hint or two of mollasses. The pronounced yeast character almost smells Belgian to me. Palate is a nice agressive up front with good yeast and malted grain notes. Strong carbonation. Some slight spiciness, but mostly the sweet malts and a little banana bread suggestion. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated, but well balanced with the sweetness finishing pleasingly dry. Medium mouthfeel over all. I like this ... I can't say it quite lives up to the expectations I had for it, based on reputation, but this is a solid, Weizenbock all the way. If you're one for the style, it's a must try.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,Onibubba,3.77,"Revisited the Aventinus last night. My first experience with this beer was outstanding, my last, decidedly less so. Poured into a tulip with the color of a cola. Nice frothy head did not last long. Smelled of sweet clovey spice - a bit like a dunkel, but less banana bread. Taste was somewhat smokey, not overly spicey, not overly sweet. Some bitterness present. Light carob/caramel taste.  Moderate to light carbonation, which subsided as the beer warmed, leaving a nice full mouthfeel. Definately went down better at about the halfway point. Alcohol is not really too noticeable.  Don't know what went wrong last time, but this was very agreeable.

72,224,robertmitchum,4.8,"Warning: first weizenbock review  Appearance: Poured into an Ayinger hefeweizen glass. Good fluffy, 4 finger head. No lacing, but the faintest head is retained throughout the beer. Very nice light brown, amber color.  Aroma: With the smell of something like a fruit cobbler, I know this is gonna be good. Bananas, apples, faint spices. Very nice  Taste: I had heard people say this before, so maybe I was somewhat expecting it, but this really does taste like a Trappist, or at least Belgian dark ale. Complex, yet perfectly balanced. Some baked fruits. The wheat is not omnipresent like in hefeweizens (the only other wheat style I am somewhat familiar with), but there are hints of the same spices such as clove. It is very sweet, but not overpowering, like some chocolate stouts. There is kind of a slight butterscotch taste. The faint (but tasty) hops kick in at just the right time to override the sweetness, and then quickly fade. But the balance is key here. Not the flavors as individuals, but how the brewers have managed to bring all of the flavors into a flavor of their own. I continue to be amazed as I look at the bottle and see the 8.2% ABV, as the alcohol is almost completely not present (vs. the Aventinus Eisbock).  Mouthfeel: Smooth, pillowy. The head at the beginning blends perfectlt with the beer. Enough head retains to keep this balance up.  Drinkability: Holy #*%&($($($*@%!!! I figured that this would just be another beer that got rave reviews but just wouldn't be my thing. If I had the money I would just throw massive keg parties with nothing but Aventinus. At 8.2% ABV, this is nothing to scoff at, but I can barely taste it. Actually I can see myself getting in trouble with this brew. As the alcohol really does sneak up on you, it shouldn't be sessionable, but it just tastes so good!!!! Nonetheless, I hope to have this in my fridge more often in the future.

I don't think I've ever had this style, and I'm not familiar with German beers at all, so this will be something new for me. So with the fact that I'm a total novice in mind, off we go...  Pours a dark mahogany cola-brown, with a huge tan head. The aroma is strongly spicy, with malts and fruits as well. The taste is malty and full at first, with definite banana flavors, before brining on the clove notes... this in turn introduces the wheat and yeast characteristics. The flavor finishes on a citrus-y, wheaty, almost astringent note. The mouthfeel is fairly light, like hefewiezen, but it is well-carbonated. If you enjoy this style, I could definitely see enjoying a glass or two of this.  Overall, tough for me to judge. To be honest, I'm not a fan of wheat beers, but this one is obviously well beyond most other brews. If you're a fan of the style, you don't need me to tell you to try it.",Schneider Weisse G.

Begins innocently enough, then overtakes the palate and especially the nasopharynx with a sledgehammer of cocoa-accented clove flavor. Hint of alcohol is also apparent. Significant carbonation combined with fairly full body make for a chewy mouthfeel. Finishes impeccably smooth, making this beer tremendously drinkable despite its undeniable power.  I love the intensity of character here without a terrible amount of sweetness. It really makes this beer satisfying and drinkable.

As it did so, small clumps of this frothy head were left behind. Oddly, the head consisted of large bubbles toward its base, and the top of the head was almost like whipped egg whites. Real nice smelling beer, sweet malts, caramel, and a grape like fruitiness that I was not expecting. It is the same in taste. Terrific. Very smooth, the well measured carbonation lends a creamy mouthfeel. A nice spice twang that seems to eminate from the alcoholic warm in the back. I might sense a slight hop hint as well.

One of the best I've had in a long time. But is it worth being one of the few 90+ brewskis on BA? Lower eighties would be insulting. Upper eighties, I'll give it that. But is this what an ""A"" is supposed to be?  While pouring it a thick head consumed my glass, leaving me with a glass that was 3/4 head and 1/4 beer. I thought, ""Oh no, I'm gonna have to wait 5 minutes for this head to go down,"" but to my surprise it went away fairly quickly. The head was not what I was used to, and the awkwardness took away from the experience.  It had a creamy texture, sort of like Guinness, and tasted like a mix of fruit and chocolate. And seeing as it was up around 8% ABV I was surprised I couldn't taste a hint of alcohol.  A pleasing, but only slightly above average aftertaste also left this beer below perfection in my opinion.  Definately a high quality beer, no doubt, no question about it. If I gave it a rating though, I'd probably give it an 88.

72,224,pbr85,3.94,"Poured into a Guinness pint glass A: Brown color with a large brownish-tan head that diminishes quickly. S: Caramalized malts and cherry. T: Very fruity. Sweet cherries and burnt wheat. Subtle alcohol hints at the end. Pleasant. Finishes clean with cherry and grapefruit flavors. M: Disappointed with the mouthfeel. It feels thin, but maybe I was expecting it to live up to Celebrator(I know its a different style), one of my all time favorites. D: Don't get me wrong, its really good. But I don't think it is $5 a pint at a liquor store good. I'd much rather go and spend $12 on a four pack of Celebrator if I'm in a mood for something along these lines. Definitely worth a try, because I could see someone who thinks this beer is great.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Gasp100,4.37,"A - Deep, dark forboding mahogany and very cloudy with a wispy off white head that leaves minimal lacing after dissipating from a huge white plume of foam. S - Ripe dark fruit, dark cherry, alcohol, plum, citrus... wait, is this a Belgian Dubbel or Quad? T - Dark fruity malt meets Hefe wheat.... no other style of beer tastes like this and this is the perfect example of what a Weizenbock should be. Toffee, chocolate, dates, figs, slight acidic and astringent citrus notes as well. M - Big, full, smooth and very light at the same time. D - At 8.2% the alcohol is warming but extremely well-hidden and this just begs to be enjoyed over and over... dangerous. This is my favorite Weizenbock hands down with only Victory Moonglow even coming remotely close to this in flavor and body. This is on my top 10 (maybe 5) all time best brews ever. Timeless.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Lots of aromas that all meld perfectly and make this one of those beers you just love to swirl around and smell.  T: Initially tasted the wheat bread mentioned in the smell. Then more vanilla, cloves and alcohol became apparent. Bananna and caramel round out the flavors after warming in your mouth. Medium body and creamy.  D: Could drink this one all the time. Very pleasant that is enjoyable thru and thru. Easy drinking for a complex beer. Almost anyone could drink this one, even the beer haters.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,mschenk,3.68,I bought a .5L bottle and poured into a pint galss. Beer poured a cloudy brown as would be expected with bottle fermentation.  Got a large head (3 fingers) creamy. but did not last long. Did not leave a lace as others have noted.  Slightly fruity smell but not overwhelming. I expected a stronger smell. Taste is also fruity with hints of chocoate and carmel. Very nice mouthfeel. Pretty good amount of carbonation.  I liked the drinkability. The after taste is very nice and. Leaves a nice fruity taste which kinda hides the 8% alcohol congtent although I can see that drinking a lot of this beer could be dangerous if you want to drive a car or operate heavy machinery.,Schneider Weisse G.

Heavy and creamy... though there is a crispness to the beer as well.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Grundle20,4.4,"Appearance: Pours a dark amber in color. There is an excellent head to this beer, the best I've seen in so long. Big and beefy and would hang on to the end if you didn't drink it. Very pleasing.  Smell: Rich scents of banana bread blast up from the glass. Very sweet with just the right alcohol uppercut.  Taste and Mouthfeel: It's nice and smooth and paints your mouth with the banana bread taste I smelled from the pour. There's a weird and welcomed tropical fruit note that kind of undulates amongst the banana bread flavors. The alcohol sting has disappeared for the most part but there's still a little kick in the fore.  Drinkability: I was expecting this to drink a little heavier but I was pleasantly shocked. The beer is very tasty and pretty refreshing, but with an 8% ABV this could easily become a danger beer.  Bottom Line: A very interesting and delicious beer. A fine addition to any German beer fans repetoir.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,xoqx,4.32,"This is massive beer by every measure, especially taste, smell, mouthfeel, alcohol content. The color is deep brown, almost beginning to redden with sparkling carbonation. The offwhite head was small and dissipated quickly and no lace ever formed. The smell is smoky and clove-spicy with dark fruity aromas. The higher than average alcohol is detectable in the nose. The taste is complex and multilayered with deep wheaty malts and bready notes followed by sharp spicy phenols with significant tart character. The mouthfeel is warming from the alcohol to be sure and very carbonated and crisp, almost sharp. The finish is long and not solventy, but a bit hot. This is very drinkable, in spite of its high alcohol content. A superb beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Dizzy,4.21,"Pours a hazy brown with a 1 inch layer of creamy off white head on top. This beer has the best head retention I've ever seen. Aroma is yeasty, smells like a wheat beer, masking most of the malts. Carmel like malts and maybe chocolate are evident in the flavor along with the yeasty flavor. There is a faint alcohol burn in the finish, but overall it hides the high alcohol volume well. Full bodied. Drinkability is great, it would be easy to drink more than one (but it might not be a good idea).",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,hunteraw,4.15,"Split a bottle of this one with my dad last night.  Appearance: Nice head, tawny in color with purple highlights. Little in the way of lacing, however.  Smell: Smells like a maltier, darker hefeweizen. Bubblegum aromas in particular stood out, along with caramel malt and a bit of tanginess.  Taste: Lots of weizen-like phenolics, but enough malt character to keep them in check. Hops balance, but don't play much of a flavor role themselves. Alcohol is obviously higher than average.  Mouthfeel: Body is rather thick, along with the bubble gum flavors makes it seem a bit medicinal.  Drinkability: Good, but not exceptional.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,McStagger,4.12,"This is my first experience with any kind of non-american wheat beer. I probably should have started with a traditional hefe, but a buddy bought this for me at the bar one night.  Appearance: Pours out a thick, brown head. Head was much darker than I expected. However, with the consistency of the beer, I was surprised at how quickly the head dissipated. Dissapointing... The beer itself was an extremely hazy brown. Under the dim light of the Electro Lounge, it almost looked as if there were bits of sediment floating around.  Smell: Heaven. Rich chocolate and carmel with a touch of vanilla. Little bit of dark fruit, almost like raspberries. Delightful.  Taste: Much more of the subtle layers of chocolate. Still got a lot of carmel, as well. Layers of vanilla were intermingled . As the beer got warmer, (was served at about 40 degrees F), I began noticing the presence of the yeast more. Lingering notes of banana bread and soft mocha replaced what was previously chocolate and carmel. Incredible taste.  Mouthfeel: Incredibly full bodied beer. Some may argue viscosity and an almost ""syrupy"" mouth feel, but I believe this beer is pure velvet. Slides across the tongue depositing lingering pockets of taste to delight the palate. Very nice.  Drinkability: The only thing about this beer that I had any issue with. Not that it's necessarily hard to drink, but that it is something that should not be consumed in any sort of excess due to it's overall sweetness, amount of yeast and alcohol content. Not a beer to trifle with, which is sad, because it's so delicious.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,dbalsock,3.87,"Appearance: Rich brown with a very tan head... tons of very tan head. The beer itself is a little hazy, with no lacing and weak head retention, but it's still pretty on the intial pour.  Smell: A mix of blackberry cheesecake, molasses, chocolate and banana... quite the nasal experience.  Taste: Dark chocolat runs the show with supporting characters of molasses, banana, fudge, breadiness. The aftershow is lead by a strawberry character that allows the brew to clear the palate nicely.  Mouthfeel: Alcohol is the major presence here, and really makes the brew enjoyable to the palate.  Drinkability: This beer stays interesting through the whole session which is helped by its full flavored nature. The one draw back is how rich it is.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,jmbranum,4.95,"I've reviewed this on several occasions. Ratings above are of my most recent tasting....  Review of 10-28-06:  AP: 4.5, SM: 4.5, T: 4.5, MF: 4.5, D: 4.0  Dark muddy hazy brown brew with a giant head that lingers for awhile and slight glow when held up to the light  Refreshing mouthfeel. Kinda tingly. The aroma is warm and inviting.  Dark spicy wheat bread, lots of cloves, a bit of cinanum and nut meg, a tiny tinge of bananas, a strange mix of citrus (maybe sorta a tiny bit of orange)  The hops I know are there but they seem to only lend a tiny bitter note to the otherwise fruity/spicy mix.  Lots of alcoholic warmth  The best part is at the end, as this beer is best enjoyed by leaving a little beer in the bottle, then swirling it (or rolling the bottle horizontally on the bar) and then pouring the remainder into your glass so you get all of the yeast. The extra yeast adds a very pleasant spiciness to the end.  This bottle is not as good as some I've had (maybe it is too cold). I thought it improved as it warmed up, but still wasn't quite to the level of past Aventinus bottles. I also wonder if it could be the age of the bottle (Aventinus to me really improves with several months or more of aging). The aroma is still superb in this bottle, but the flavor is slightly less complex than normal.  Also another difference to note, is that the label now says it is 8.2% ABV, while it used to be 8.0% ABV. I wonder if the recipe has changed or what?  Review of 1-1-10: One of the great beers. My all time favorite over the years, so take this with a grain of salt. Enjoyed tonight after midnight on New Year's day 2010.  Massive richness. Magnificent aroma. The aroma is full of nice rich honey wheat bread. A bit of banana and citrus. Tons and tons of spices. Cloves for sure. Maybe a a little bit of cinnamon. A little of prckliness from maybe some hops and carbonation.  Thinking of all of the dear friends I've enjoyed this beer with over the years, as I drink it again tonight. Happy New Years to all!  2-23-10 - Changed the taste rating from 1-1-10 from 4.5 to 5.0. Have no idea why I said this was only a 4.5 that night. Must have enjoyed ""too much alcoholic warmth""  5-11-12 - Changed the overall rating. This is 5.0 beer if there ever was one.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,SudNut,4.09,"Pours to a plum colored amber with a finger thick head that dissipates quickly. Smells of wheat and hmmm grapes, plums or prunes, not sure.  Taste definitely was prunes I think, with wheat and a bit of alcohol in the background. Finish was a chocolate covered clove leaf.  Swishing about the mouth brings out the suds and alcohol taste, a light and frothy feel.  Drinkability is good but the alcohol content is a bit high for a session beer.",Schneider Weisse G.

This beer has a bubblegum like aroma. It also smells slightly spicy. Some caramel malt aroma is also present. It has a very subtle yeasty aroma also.  From the aroma, I was worried about what this beer would taste like. However, I was wrong. It tastes good. It is spicy, with some yeasty flavor.It has a caramel malty sweet flavor also.  This beer goes down smooth, leaving a malty sweet aftertaste. It is decently carbonated for the style.  I doubt this beer would kae the best session beer. It is a little high in alcohol. Also, although the flavor is decent, it might be a bit much after a few.  Overall: I didnt particularly like this one. I dont know what is was, but I just didnt like it. Sorry.",Schneider Weisse G.

After the pour subsided, a small white ring remained.  S: The beer has an unmistakable clove aroma, estery with hints of banana.  T: The first flavors to hit are light wheat notes. They soon give way to the weizen esters. They are fruity but reserved, not fully taking control of the beer. As the beer warms on the palate, a slight alcohol burn emerges but it is not that astringent.  M: The hefe weizen aromas combined with the stronger wheat body make this a good tasting beer.

With all the raving, I just had to try it. Man, what a beer!  A gentle pour gave me a huge white head. The color is deep brownish red, cloudy from unfiltered bottle conditioning. Very attractive.  Big bannana and clove on the nose. Lots of pungent sweet fruit character.  Taste of heavy clove and some bannana lingers along with caramel and some rum.

72,224,BarrelBrother,4.57,"Thanks to many positive recommendations on Beer Advocate I sought out this incredible beer. I've never had a doppelbock than grabbed my attention like this one! We were at a German bier stubbe in the Chicagoland area enjoying various schnitzel dishes, when I saw Aventinus on their beer menu. Remembering my Beer Advocate recommendation on this beer, I suggested we order a round. WOW, we weren't dissapointed!  A: Dark ruby, cloudy when held to the light. The vision is that of a deep robust beer. The head is outstanding, thick & creamy full of frothy goodness. S: The variety of aromas coming from the glass made me ponder for minutes all that assailed my senses. Raisin, clove, oatmeal with many overtones as the carbonation tickled my nose. T: Smooth and flavorful with many different tastes on my palate. Sheer enjoyment as I savored each sip. Carmel and raisin were predominate, but there was a toasty aftertaste that I really enjoyed. Just a wonderfully complex beer that treats your senses on every level. M: Silky smooth, creamy, with a wonderful afterglow of warm alcohol tingling your palate. Not overbearing mind you, but you know it's there. D: At 8% I'm sure a couple of these would have you mellowed out in a hurry. Very drinkable, not heavy, but this is a potent brew and after 2 pints I could feel the kick. But I loved it.  If you like doppelbocks or hearty brews with big chartacter, give Aventinus a try.

Served in a 1 pint plus .9 fl. oz. bottle, no freshness date marked.  A: Pours a nice, deep brown. Good sized tan head with nice lacing. Pretty much clear, with some slight clouding.  S: Has an undoubtedly alcoholic scent, along with notes of clove, fruit and banana.  T: Wow. I've heard more than one reviewer call Aventinus ""The Nectar of the Gods"" and I couldn't agree more. Starts off sweet with a little bit of fruity tang, plus some slight caramel flavors. Finishes more with clove and an alcoholic taste.  M: For the most part, heavy and creamy... though there is paradoxally a crispness to the beer as well. Incredibly pleasant warming alcohol feel as well.  D: I would only suggest one or two of these in a night, but that doesn't mean that the beer has low drinkability. Rather, I could happily have Aventinus every night.

A spicy, cinnamon aroma, along with a peculiar sweetness I associate with canned corn dominate the nose and taste. The relatively high alcohol content also contributes to the flavor; I definitely welcomed those esters for adding an additional dimension to the otherwise clobbering maltyness. To that end, I found that a few bites of dark chocolate brought out a crispness that I might have otherwise overlooked.

The brew itself is crystal clear, medium brown, with a hint of red/orange. Constant streams of bubbles coming up.  Smell: Like a wheat beer on steroids. Many of the same sweet banana and clove smells, but significantly magnified. The smell is so strong and well-defined that it seems like a liquid, filling up your nose.  Taste: Initial bite of CO2, followed by strong banana and clove flavors. The whole thing is tied together with an underlying malty/wheat sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Average to above average level of carbonation, especially considering the amount of head it put up. Nice mouthfeel, lots of body.

The nose is strong and clovey, with lots of banana bread, along with a lot of sweet berry odor, and alcohol. Taste is sweet, alcoholic, and banana bready. Finishes on a bready note.

Earthy yeast aromas raging with bananas, and a smooth creamy smell. Hints of clove. Slight alcohol can be detected in the aromas.  Strong wheat malt flavors along with plenty of yeasty fruit flavors. Light hoppiness at the end the balance the malts. The 8.2% ABV alcohol is hidden very well. Only gets creamier as it warms.  Medium bodied with considerable carbonation.

This could be a case of sensory overload, however, as I can tell there's a lot going on in this bock's aroma and tastes, but it's hard to decifer exactly what it is. Upon pouring there was a nice firm tan head, and a murky, turbid, brown body that reminded me of swamp water...unreal. Then poof, the heads gone, not a trace, not even a whisper of head or lace for much of the drink. Aromas were thick with a yeasty, fruity, clovelike smell, that was very hard to decern.

The drink ability it great, this is a top world class beer, Nothing bad and almost everything over and above, Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,IntriqKen,3.45,Pours a cloudy dark amber with a half finger off white head that melts to fine lacing. Aroma is surprisingly belgium in nature with dark fruits and moderate alcohol. Taste is initially cinnamon..cinnamon then dark fruits like aprocots and plums and follows with a slight wheat drying and alcohol burn. Aftertaste of wheat and alcohol. Mouthfeel is very substantial.,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,DragYourBone,4.3,"Caveat - green rater with a preferance for strong ales (especially Belgian) who is tasting his first weizen.  Whoa! watch that pour! A thick head billows atop an amber carbonated ale. Swirl the glass and the foam beautifully lingers on the side in a fantastic lace pattern.  The scent of the ale has a sweet pungence. I can't quite grasp all the fragrances - bananas, clove...I can't decipher the rest, but the melange is such that invites one in to take another sip.  The mouthfeel is quite nice...a medium fullness on the tongue with sweet hops spikes and then a lingering malty taste in the back.  Drinkability - I wasn't sure at first bite - the hop spikes had me wondering at first, but I settled into the style and it settled on me quite nicely. Definitely a thirst quencher and a sipping ale at the same time.  I will have to try some others from the same style to really compare this ale.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Doomcifer,4.47,"Aventinus! Poured a dark ""cow brown"" color with a beatiful two-fingered head which settled down rather quickly to a thin head that lingered around for the remainder of the glass. Beautiful looking beer which has good lacing while drinking but nothing that sticks to the glass. Smells of bready, yeasty, bananas, clove, coriander. The taste is just...WOW. Coming through the palate is Yeast, breadiness, coriander, honeydew, some cherries, a little anise, bananas, and an unbelievable clove finish with some alcohol warmth. Extremely complex brew here and ridiculously YUMMY. One of the better tasting beers I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, velvety, and moderate-high carbonation. I could drink these everyday to start off a session. Absolutely amazing beer. A true masterpiece of the style. Hats off.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,RedChrome,4.2,"Pour resulted in a nice deeb brown color with red hints in the light. A nice fluffy inch high white head retains for quite a while. Only a handful of carbonation bubbles can be seen. Small clumps of watery lacing.  Th main scent of this beer is a nice malty aroma. The malt blends nicely with an almost equally as strong scent of banana nut bread. A slight after odor of alcohol to open the nose at end.  A very nice blend of spice flavors includes pepper, anise, and clove. A light malt flavor helps the beer go down smooth. A second taste brings a flavor of raisins and prunes. There is a very faint hit of banana flavor. A light alcohol finish helps to balance the sweetness of the fruits, and the boldness of the spice flavors.  A very nice thick body. A very nice linguering effect of the main spices in the body. Decent carbonation kick.  Overall, great quality. This would be a very nice strong beer to pair with a nice german meal of wursts and sauerkraut. If you like the style of beer this is a definte must try.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,dblinkhorn,4.5,"Poured from 500 ml bottle into my weizen glass, no lemon or orange wedge added!  Appearance - Pours a dark nutty brown color that is quite hazy. THe head is very large, and somewhat soapy, (although still very smooth). It dissipates at a fairly fast pace and settles at a nice cap floating on the brew. The lacing is decent. There are some nice carbonation columns rising energentically from the bottom of the glass.  Smell - Sweet cooked bananas on the nose. The malt is quite rich and almost tastes slightly roasted (similar malt character to a porter). The hops are very crips, with nice floral and citrus notes, which work together well. There are obvious notes of clove and possibly some cinnamon. There is a background alcohol warmth that is very soothing.  Taste - Again sweet cooked banans from the start. I can also taste some molasses and fresh sugar cane in the mix. The spices and hops really come alive in the taste. Obvious notes of clove and cinnamon again, and some floral and a bit citrusy in the hop department...which are also quite crisp and clean tasting. The malt is very bready, and have somewhat of a buscuity flavor. The roasted flavor of the malt does not show itself in the taste nearly as much as I could smell it. There are some earthy notes from the wheat and yeast, but very slight and far in the background of the rest of the medly. A very great taste, one of the best weizens I've ever had.  Mouthfeel - This beer has a light- to medium-body and is quite smooth (smoother than I had anticipated). The carbonation has no uncomfortable bitiness to it, and it's very smooth and frothy (but the beer does not ""vaporize"" in your mouth!). The alcohol is barely noticeable in the taste but still gives a slight warming sensation.  Drinkability - There is absolutely nothing harsh or unpleasant about this weizen. It is very, very easy to drink, especially with an 8.2% ABV (which I couldn't really even notice).  Overall, the best (or very close to the best) weizen I have ever had. It has lots of complexity (which most weizens I've had lacked severely). The carbonation is very smooth and refreshing, and the alcohol is deviously hidden. A MUST have (repeatedly) weizenbock!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Drew966,4.63,"Aventinus pours a caramel brown, darker and murkier toward the top of the glass into an Aventinus glass from a brown .5 liter bottle. It smells like clove, banana, and more clove. Definitely an intese smelling beer. The mouthfeel is thick and full. Loads of banana and clove flavor. Some alcohol warming This really is an excellent beer, it has the flavors of a weiss beer on steroids. Almost the equivalent, perhaps, of what Americans have done to the IPA, pimp it out to the max. Highly recommended.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,goochpunch,4.67,"Pours a murky brown with carbonation running up the sides of the glass forming a thin ring of bubbles around the liquid's surface. Smells strongly of bananas and light rum booziness with slight chocolate from the dark malts. The best way to describe the flavor of this beer is chocolate drizzled and lightly clove spiced banana bread. Tastes like a pumped up dunkelweizen all around. Just a hint of alcohol. Additional flavors of raisins, dates, and other dried fruits. There is also a very bright tart and sweet combination in the finish that prevents this from becoming to tiring on the palate. Mouthfeel is of sturdy body with pleasant viscosity combined with lively bubbles. With excelent body and flavor makes this a great drinker.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Phatz,4.79,"Presentation: This beer is an eye-catching 500 ml German style bottle. It was actually not on my list when I walked past it in State College and it grabbed my eye.  Appearance: Pours a rusty brown color into my Hefe Weizen Glass with a large tan head.  Smell: It has a strong yeast aroma that provides a distinct twang followed by caramel malts dark fruits and spices; and then there is a bit of apple cider and pumpkin pie aroma rising up through the center to make a statement of presence in the nose.  Taste: What a truly unique treat. I am hooked. It is every thing I like in a Dunkel with more booze and the deep rum raisin flavors I love in a DoubleBock. The yeast the wheat the spicy cloves in the stinging aftertaste all keep this beer remarkably interesting. From the top. It starts out with a gentle alcohol warming sensation and is immediately followed by fruity yeasty twang with spices of clove and nutmeg sweet malts and hint of banana drizzled in caramel and a hint of chocolate, following. The aftertaste may be the best feature. Wow, I can't stop wanting more. There is a residual spiciness that keep beckoning for the next sip.  Mouthfeel: This is a full body beer with plenty of carbonation.  Drinkability: Wow. I can't even explain how easily this beer drinks. I am thinking we should defiantly buy stock in it though. Private Weissbierbrauerei G. Schneider & Sohn GmbH. I wonder if they are a publicly held stock? ;-) It is that freaking good. I suggest buying a case.  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,DaveFL1976,3.74,"Pours a dark oak/caramel color, slightly hazy with a foamy tan head that unfortunately didn't stick around too long. Smell is nice. Sweet caramel/toffee with a hint of candy sugar sweetness. Some alcohol comes through on the nose. Taste was caramel, sweet, a little smokey and dry yet still smooth. Alcohol is a bit too noticable. There is a bit of acidity or tartness at the end of the swallow. A light mouthfeel with light carbonation, but the aftertaste and harshness makes for a pretty good, but not great drinkability.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,expatsteve,4.8,"Appearance: Chocolate brown suspended in golden orange--totally unique and compelling. Cloudy, pours with a big head that subsides to light suds. Low viscosity.  Aroma: Banana, chocolate, cloves, orange and some lactose sour notes. Sour wheat finish combines with peppery hops and a little booze. Phenomenal.  Taste: Great. Full weizen flavor, with banana esters, orange, cloves. Chocolate and toffee background from the bock malts and hops and chalk in the finish. Great blend of sweet bock tendencies and some of the sour wheat notes. Fruity in a way that many bocks aren't.  Mouthfeel: Great doppelbock body--slightly lighter, with good malts and subtle cleansing hops--combines with the finish of a wheat beer. More aggressive carbonation that is typical of weizens.  Drinkability: Definitely the standard and the standard-killer for weizenbocks. Simply superb combination of wheat and bock tendencies, resulting in a ridiculously drinkable beer. I enjoyed this bottle as much as I enjoyed my first encounter with this in the Schneiderbrau restaurant in Munich.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,grub,4.33,"pours a murky brown colour with a big fluffy head. 10 min later there's still about a quarter inch of head. no real lace, but it maintains that head pretty much the whole way down the glass.  aroma is nice. spicy, with a bit of clove. some sweetness.  taste is great. fruit and spice, with a nice lingering sweetness. clove and pepper. orange peel and a bit of grape. really dry finish. slightly warming going down. a little bitterness.  mouthfeel is odd. it's dry, but has fairly high carbonation.  drinkability is good. the alcohol isn't noticeable in the taste, but you feel its warmth once it's gone. dry and easy to drink.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,AmorousAngel,3.8,"Poured into a tall Weizen Glass from a 500 ml bottle. A nice, clear reddish brown with a small fluffy head. The head quickly died down to a small ring around the glass. Any lacing that you see as you take a drink quickly slides down the side of the glass; it does not adhere. Tiny bubbles can be seen rising throughout the life of the drink.  Lacks the heavy roasted malt aroma that I have come to associate with the darker dopplebocks, but has an excellent wheat and fruit aroma.  Definite wheat beer flavor, with a little bit of raisin. Nicely balanced hops and malt.  Smooth and medium bodied. A bit of a tingle of carbonation.  This may be a bit TOO drinkable at 8% alcohol; it could get you into trouble if you aren't careful. I will definitely have this one again. Very well done.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Graebner,4.67,"Pours a ruby brown with a finger of creamy head that dies down to just a layer of froth. Lots of bubble column activity. The beer is unfiltered and bottle fermented, so it's translucent, though clearer than most similar beers.  Smells of fruit and freshly baked bread, with noticable esters and a barely-burnt popcorn aroma sneaking in. The above-average smell belies the incredible taste.  Taste is very sweet cake with rum, cloves, and nutmeg, some dried dark fruit (raisins, maybe dates, and prunes), lush caramel and toffee flavors, and a crisp and nutty finish. Wow. This one is really a complex and powerful brew, worthy of kings.  Mouthfeel is balanced extremes. The up front taste is syrupy sweet, but the finish is equally extreme with crisp, biting carbonation and a touch of hops and alcohol. The two titans balance each other perfectly, like yin and yang, or Laurel and Hardy, or the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. It's like having a Mac truck on either end of a see-saw. It's amazing. Few indeed are the places one can find such tremendous expressions of a particular trait, yet also find them in balance and not overpowering. The beer finishes cleanly, no cloying. A slight alcohol taste remains, but it's *very* slight and mixed with malty goodness and traces of hops. This is GOOD brew.  Overall, a beer I could drink all night long. This one will do your stomach right, I think. At $3.59 for 500ml (~17oz), it will do your wallet right as well. This is a winner, simply an astounding presentation of the style. This makes two excellent beers by Schneider & Sohn, and I expect the weissen-eisbocks I have downstairs will be a third. Get this stuff.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,peabody,4.3,"Wow, you can taste the wheat! Anyways, pours out like dark tea with a slight hint of orange. Two fingers of slightly tan foam that doesn't lace much but it hangs around for quite some time. Wheat Clove and Banana are here in abundance. Wonderful mix and none are overpowering. Sweet and hot are the two words I would use to describe this concoction. There is a bitterness at the back of the mouth followed by an alcoholic warmth in the back of the throat. I could drink 2 or 3 of these at a sitting.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,GolgiIPAratus,4.57,"Sampled: 7.22.06  The beer is dark golden brown, like rich mulled cider. A nice big bubbled 1 inch head rests on top and fades gracefully like the foam from soda, leaving no lacing on the glass.  The aroma is complex. Rich dark fruits up front. The wheat malt banana smell is darker, like cooked & caramalized bananas. Spices like clove and nutmeg reside in the heady air trapped below the lip of my thick, wide mouthed brandy snifter. The nose warming alcohol mingles nicely with that spiciness.  The flavor sticks to the dark fruit motif of the nose. Fig and raisin and more over ripened banana swirl gently with the cloves and other spices. These spices are not as prevalent in the mouth as, say, a regular Hefe (the cloves in particular), but are certainly a nice touch. It is no doubt similar, but much richer and malty than a Hefe. An overall sweetness prevails throughout each sip. Theres a tangy finish and you dont sense the 8% ABV until its swallowed and warming your belly. Despite all this going on, the brew is STILL light in the mouth and its high carbonation keeps the beer lively. Fantastic beer all around.  Drinkabilty? For 8% its off the charts, but I like savoring a bottle, personally. Great beer, one of my favorites for sure. It will eternally astound me that these German beers have just 4 ingredients in them. Stellar.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,atigerlife,4,"Pours a dark cloudy brown with a off-white thick head. Good lasting power of the head and decent lacing.  Aroma is of wheat, some caramel sweetness and some banana.  Taste is quite interesting. Definitely the alcohol comes through and some clove, wheat and sweetness.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and quite cleansing.  Overall, quite drinkable but the ABV tends to limit my intake. Very unique and well worth trying. I'm looking forward to my next one.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,chaps77,4.65,"Purchased this in the bottle from a local establishment. Pours a nice deep brown color. The nose is incredible. Just when I thought that the nose was going to be the best part, I took my first sip and WOW!!! The finish was so smooth and continued for upwards of 30 seconds. Highly recommended! This is a beer that I will continue to come back to time and again.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,unclederby,4.57,"Sits a dark, murkey brown in my Aventinus glass. Tiny streams of carbonation work their way from bottom to the foamy three finger cap. The head quickly disappears to leave just a thin whisp, and lacing is nonexistent. The nose is a spicy montage of chocolate, clove, banana and a bit of black pepper. The flavors pull out much of the same, with some plum and perhaps a touch of citrus and noticeable tastes of bubblegum. The alcohol becomes a bit more detectable as it warms. Fine, almost champagne-like carbonation is revealed in the mouth, which is creamy and medium/full. This a satisfying beer that could leave you feeling full and a bit heady (the alcohol sneaks up on you) after one 16.9oz. bottle... two might be my limit on this one.  A unique brew which stands in a class by itself and is sets the standard for a weizenbock. A must try and highly recommended.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Byeast,4.29,"Poured a dark mahgany/brown. The head formed quickly to a creamy white inch. Aromas from this unique brew are yeasty , ripe darker fruit , not quite ripe banana , and some nice mellow caramel. The taste is very complex and good. It starts off with the dark fruit flavors like raisin and plum , rich malt throughout , some tart wheat, well hidden alchohol, and a slightly spicy finish with a bit of clove and hint of cinnamon. Mouthfeel is fairly effervecent. This weizenbock is an exellent and different beer. Tastes good!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BAbaracus,4.39,"Packaged in paper wrapper dated 2000  Pours a ruddy, milky brown with deep orange highlights. Minimal head with large carb bubbles  Raisins, apple, assorted citrus, molasses, a bit of brown sugar on the nose, buoyed by undercurrents of wheat, yeast and alcohol.  Thick and foamy on the tongue, goes down like cream  Fermented apple kick precedes sugary malt awash in mild alcohol substratum. Six years of age apparently suits this bad boy pretty well. Assertive dichotomy between the soured fruit and candied malt blends well without dissipating into bland inoffensive.  I can't really imagine tiring of this one too quickly, although that abv is liable to creep up on you.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,shivtim,4.05,"What an interesting beer. It's a deep brown/amber color, with maybe the slightest hint of red. Head is small and dissapears. You can smell the alcohol, as well as wheatiness and sour cherries. The taste is a great balance of yeasty wheat and malts, with a mild alcohol finish. The alcohol becomes more pronounced upon warming. Mouthfeel is excellent, it goes down great and has quite a bit of carbonation.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,JerzDevl2000,3.88,"Picked this up a few weeks ago from a local liquor store. Never tried it before, was told it was good, and the 25 oz. bottle is always nice to split with someone for a 2nd opinion. I've only had the Ramstein Winter Wheat, in terms of other weizenbocks, and I thought this was just a tad below it ratingswise.  Nice, dark pour to this beer, with a wonderfully thick head, and minimal lacing. I could easily taste the chocolate and cloves to this, but I thought it had too much tartness up front, and behind, and if I was given this blindfolded, I would have sworn that there was way more alcohol in it than the 8.0% listed. For me, I don't mind a beer having an alcohol/heavy taste to it, but I prefer it to be more subdued, unless it's been aged, heavily hopped, or just high in ABV content. It didnt' defer from my enjoyment of this - I thought it was smooth for the most part, but it didn't help either. The spiciness could be tasted here too, but it wasn't as apparent as the spices in an Octoberfest. On that aspect, this beer pretty much got it right on the nose.  This would be great for the summer, since it's easy on the flavors, but has a nice warming aspect to it that makes it great for cold-weather enjoyment as well. Certainly worth a shot - just don't drive home after having one of these!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

S - Smell is sweet malts, toffee, and caramel.  T&M - Taste up front has a nice malty sweet chocolate backbone. Cloves and spice are also thrown in the mix. Wheat and hops attribute to the aftertaste, slighty bitter, yet full creamy and dry.  D - Drinkability is average, as this beer is quite filling.  Wondeful example of the style, and definitely a world class brew.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,smcolw,3.98,"What is a wheat doppelbock? I love the creativity. Pours a dark brown--light passes through...barely. From what I can tell, it's slightly cloudy. The initial head is impressive, but it dies quickly, leaving a mild lace.  Strong wheat smell, some sourness, some metal (although very mild). Attractive.  Imagine a double bock with at least 30% wheat. Fairly dry flavor and slight hop at the end. I like the balance. Still, this is very much a dark, wheat beer. Thinner than a doppelbock, but thicker than a wheat beer. High carbonation. Long lasting, but light sourness in the aftertaste.  I like this beer. It has a wonderful flavor that is unmatched by any other beer I've ever had. It's easy to drink. Frankly, it could be unnoticed unless you take time to realize that it is unique and special. It is that subtle. Try this one without prejudice and enjoy.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

S - Raisins, a bit of chocolate, some alcohol and breadiness. Dark ripe fruits are also in abundance.  T - Interesting. Like the smell, this has a lot of Belgian characteristics that lend to a very good flavored beer. Beer starts a bit tart, but then very quickly moves into a period of fruity sweetness and finishes with a nutmeg and clove kick.  M - Ok, but it's a tad on the thin side and a little over carbonated.  D - Excellent again. Very nice beer that has earned its high praise.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

It smells rich and creamy, and the smell displays more of the German wheat beer characteristics than the taste actually does. Smells distinctly of bananas and cloves. The taste is mild and somewhat constricted, but really very good and it tastes like a classic, which I suppose it is. Definitely a good beer to watch out for and to try, at least once, on a warm summer night on the patio of your favorite beer bar.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

A truly wonderful smelling beer T: As good as the smell - lots of spice including perhaps nutmeg or cinammon, malt & wheat predominantly, some fruitiness, a hint of alcohol but very nicely balanced.

As beer sits, a dark-copper body appears. Lots of carbonation rises through the clear brew. Head settles nicely and leaves minimal lacing.  S: Smells like a double-wheat. Sweet. Bready. Caramel hints. Slightly fruity. Whispers of bitter hops.  T: Smooth and sweet on the palate. Fruity and dark flavors. Chocolate becomes a big part as it warms. Hops are clean and slightly nutty? in the finish.  M: Creamy. Enough carbonation to be crisp, but not bubbly. Smooth and just light enough in the mouth. Doesn't finish clean enough.  D: Doesn't feel/taste anywhere near 8% (more like 5-6%). Easy to drink, but not particularly refreshing.

A bouquet of fruit, raisins, cloves, wheat, a hint of bubblegum and a little bit of alcohol very impressive. The bubblegum flavor is present, not quite a hefe weissen taste, its labeled as a Wheat DoppleBock and thats really what it tastes like a wheat beer crossed with a dopplebock.

Slight clove flavors go with the wheat sweetness that is held back with the alcohol and natrual roasted bitterness. Good body a little thinner than I would have liked it to be at room temp, but it seems to have a better body in the 2nd bottle that was closer to 60F.

T-not what I was expecting from the style, tastes like a hefe with a stiffer backbone. Not as crisp, but in a good way. The flavor lingers on the palate and brew warms the chest as it slides down. Very floral and delicious.  M-a bit more carbonation than I needed, but after a while it becomes pretty creamy and nice.  DrA.- Wow, this thing is a gulper. I have to hold myself back from downing it. I like how its a high alch. content dunkel yet it goes down so easily.  Overall- Just awesome. As a huge hefe fan I am in heaven.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,3Vandoo,4,"I am not a fan of Weizen neither of Bocks, so imagine when you mix the both of these worlds. But, I like it anyway.  Very dark golden beer with a foamy and present beige head.  Smell is alcoholic and wheats are present, with big notes of bananas and apples.  Taste is quite sweet, first the hops come in, with their fruity kick such as banana and apples followed by an earthy malty presence which ends with a cereal but shy flavors.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Weizenmensch,3.69,"I've had this beer several times before, and all of them were memorable occasions. Since you can't buy this in my home town, I bought a few when I was interstate and I saved this one until now, a cold winter's night, when you really want a weizenbock. But there's something wrong with this bottle - maybe because I've been storing it horizontally in the fridge for the past month or so, rather than vertically in a cool, dark place, the yeast kind of tastes funny. Best before 24.10.06 - I bought it about three months ago.  So here's my review - I'll edit it if a later bottle inspires me enough to do so.  Appearance: The head kind of died away quickly. Dark mahogany with not much red to it. Fairly effervescent, but not enough to keep the head going.  Smell: This is the part that tells me something's wrong with this bottle. Instead of christmas pudding, this tastes more like some amateur's home brew. Upsetting.  Taste: Despite the unusual smell, the taste is rounded, developed and satisfying. Sweet, chocolatey, rich like berries and stone fruit, and a brandy-like alcoholic nature to it. Tastes like a special occasion.  Mouthfeel: Sharp and fizzy, but this spreads the flavour around your mouth and makes the beer more exciting.  Drinkability: I remember one night I had the luxury of a few of these in a row. If I could afford it, I might drink these all night. Depends if you're in the mood for a nice weizenbock. Tonight I am, and if I had more, I'd definitely choose them over a thinner pilsener or pale ale.  Not the worst review, but I think with a good specimen bottle of this beer, it would get a better rating. Aventinus is renowned for good reason.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,jwc215,4.43,"Poured cloudy brown with a thick, well-retained head. Smell - robust and complex - pronounced wheat, yeast, and alcohol with underlying caramel and various spices (esp. clove). Taste - Very full-flavored - wheat, yeast and alcohol all intermingled with enough spices to put a ""kick"" in it. Hints of citrus are noticeable - moreso in the aftertaste - which is lingering. Despite the touch of bitterness, it is still fairly smooth and drinkable. Its complexities and spices make this a great sipping treat.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,PBRstreetgang,3.78,"Pours a very cloudy mahogany with the yeast pour. Soapy off-white head fills the glass then settles to three fingers. Good retention and a few sticky spots of lace. Belgian phenols like plastic and banana in the nose, and a plum ester as it warms. Sweet toasted wheat malt flavor with loads of Phenols and raisin-like ester. Weak noble hops in the aftertaste, semi-dry with a hint of cocoa. Medium carbonation and medium full body, lots of texture from wheat and yeast but also crisp. Tart and dry finish with no ester- phenols mellow out- but get in the way of the wheat flavor and seem out of place where you would normally find a residual sweet finish. Interesting, but not what I reach for when I want a wheat doppelbock.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,kpwill07,4.19,"Brewed in 2001. I was very excited to give this a shot after hearing such good things....  It's dark in appearance, like apple cider, but even darker. Cloudy. Very cloudy. A decent tan head, retained well.  Initial smell was somewhat complex, raisins and bananas are right up front. The taste itself was similar, full bodied but not overpowering by any means. I really really enjoyed it, and would recommend to anyone who likes similar beers.  The only knock I'd have on this beer, if you could even call it that, is that I'm not sure if I'd want to drink more than one bottle in a sitting. One alone works just fine though.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,arguemaniac,4.33,"Pours a hazy chestnut color featuring a rich, well-retained head. The fruity, slightly sour aroma includes some nice clovey hints. The rich, complex palate offers clove, banana, some distinct cinnamon (as well as an overall spiciness along those lines), a mild acidity and some definite dark fruit flavors. The finish is fruity with some graininess. The mouthfeel is slightly thicker than medium-bodied with an active carbonation tang.  What a classic, but unusual beer (though I guess the weizenbocks are certainly becoming more common). But like many such beers, you either love or you hate it; I, for one, love it. Complex and deceptively drinkable. Highly recommended.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,rtratzlaff,4.82,"My first review, so take with a grain of salt. This is just what my young palate was able to pick up.  Poured a dark ruby color with a beautiful off-white inch thick head.  Nose was slightly chocolate, fruity banana-like esters.  I drank some without the yeast, and some with: w/out: crisp carbonation up front leading to pleasant sweetness in the middle with tons of flavor and complexity I cannot even begin to describe (maybe one day). I did pick up on the spicy clove finish that the bottle describes, and finally an alcoholic warming of the tongue. with: raisney fruitiness giving way to yeasty flavor. Flavors similar to w/out but even more complex and pleasing.  The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth--about what I expected.  I drank this slightly hungry just to make sure I could get it all down, but I ended up still getting quite full from this beer. I'm sure experience BAs could handle it with no problem, but I got quite full and surely felt that 8.2%. It's very deceptive. Make sure you take you time with this one. I imagine this would go well with grilled pork chops.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,RedHaze,4.5,"Best by 0508.  Pours a cloudy dark brown with a thick two finger head that slowly settles to a solid cap that never entirely fades, leaving behind a thin tattered lace.  Smell; lots of wheat and lemons, some hints of bananas. There's sweet caramel, bread and dark malts. The mix of wheat beer and dopplebock aromas go together better than I thought they would.  Taste; lemons, bananas and cloves are all present, along with a definite wheat profile. The sweet malts, caramel and dark fruits make their presence known on the back end. This is a great combination a wheat and dopplebock flavors. Mouthfeel is medium to full, and so drinkable I have to make myself slow down a bit with the big abv.  I will definitely be revisiting this one in the near future.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,soulgrowl,3.75,"Appearance: Clear, cherry-brown, tea-like body. Incredibly massive, ivory, marshmallowy head with great retention.  Smell: Malted milk balls hit me first. Whoa. Then come bowlfuls of ripe bananas and bright, schnapps-like alcohol. Beneath that, fruit such as red grapes and cherries accompany sweet Hawaiian bread and mild chocolate aromas.  Taste: Everything from the nose, especially bananas, plus clove, apple cider, and a little musty yeast. A tidal wave of acerbic, up-front alcohol threatens to destroy the beer's complexities (along with my tastebuds), but it is still good.  Mouthfeel: The alcohol is just too fiery. Otherwise, it's fairly pleasant, light-bodied and slightly chewy.  Drinkability: Well, it's a fine beer but not one I want to have every night. The overly extroverted alcohol betrays the other flavors and makes this beer not as drinkable as it could be.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,brushpig,3.15,"Huge head, with a cloudy red amber look to it. Malty, fruity in the nose. You can definitely feel the carbination that leaves your tongue tingly. The taste of chocalate,spices, coffee ,and what seems to be bananas, that for me left a unpleasant after taste. You can taste the sweetness of the fruits, and sense the high alcohol content. Still a good experience, but not sure how many more I'll have of this beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Vancer,4.25,"Great brew, but the cost could keep it from being in the fridge often. At the beginning, a clear mahogany brown pour, with a solid ivory topping. At the end, with I mixed the sediment, of course it turned ruddy brown, thick and chewy, yum.  Sweet malts and clove in the aroma and tasting, also noting some caramel undertones. A very sweet brew (making more than a couple bottles questionable), I would suggest this one for anybody - a fine solid brew. Very full bodied and carbonated.  Aventinus can stand alone with hard-core craft drinkers, or would make a good cross-over brew for beginners.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Domingo,4.57,"EDIT: This is even better when fresh. Pick some up at the Weisses Brauhaus in Munich for a REAL treat.  (You know after 2 years of wondering why the brew sometimes kicks me in the teeth, I noticed that my local Old Chicago often mislabels the Aventinus Eisbock. This brew is wonderful, but that one just doesn't do it for me!)  Pours a cloudy brown color. You won't notice much difference between this an a dunkel weisen, although this might be slightly darker.  Smells are potent, but wonderful. Everything from chocolate, to banana, clove, dates, and sweet bread. Reminds me a little of ultra-potent banana bread.  Flavors change as this one warms. While this one starts out very bread-y, the chocolate flavor starts to come out more as time passes. The banana smell hold strong, but the flavor focuses more on cloves and sweet yeast. Alcohol's definitely there, but it's not too strong.  Mouthfeel is actually just right. It's just like drinking a dunkel weizen. No thicker or thinner.  Drinkability is solid. After being scared of this beer for so long...it's funny that I was drinking a different beer 1/2 the time. When drinking the Weizenbock, I have no issues in drinking a full bottle or even a second.  This is a definite world-class beer. My best advice is just to make sure you're drinking the Weizenbock and not the Weizen-Eisbock. The bottles look the same, so ask to look at the bottle before your server pours it!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Poured a cloudy, rust-brown color with a bubble-laiden, soft, cream colored head that dissipated quickly and left just a touch of lacing. High level of carbonation with very tiny bubbles gracing the surface; seemed like I was dreaming. An incredible number of aromas seemed to come out including honey, grains, earth, sweet fruit, and alcohol. The taste was dominated by that of dark fruit and wheat. Subtle earth (mud) and smoked flavors added character and depth. The texture was slightly chewy with a medium-finish that seemed to involve figs and dates. The beer starts off smooth and semi-sweet, but finishes bitter. Start to finish this is one of the most incredible and flavorful brews I've ever had.",Schneider Weisse G.

The taste is a mosaic of savory deliciousness. Luscious malts, tart fruits, soft spices, wheat, even a hint of chocolate - the flavors just wash over the tongue. Medium-full body with a slight creaminess and just a trace of alcohol.  Damn that's good beer. Outstanding.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Wholesome malts with banana bread, honey, spice, apple, and some faint caramel or toffee sweetness. Mmmmm for taste. Various flavors of sweet malts and fruits weave around in your mouth. Banana and some sort of dark fruits, cloves and spice, and wheat and yeast. Delectable. Great mouthfeel. Gritty and grainy with a velvet like smoothness. Cabonation is just right and adds to the mouthfeel. For 8% very drinkable. Too good to be hard to drink.

The smell is primarily of belgian yeast but also has hints of sweet wine like aromas. The taste is very Belgian like which is probably due to the yeast. The beer is also very sweet with dark fruit taste but maintains its its bock like characteristics. The beer is nicely thick with some decent dryness.

72,224,czechsaaz,4.67,"Aroma is slightly sweet but is distinctly ""Wheaty."" There's also a lot of estery fermentation aroma and some phenols as is common with Bavarian Wheat beers. Not as powerful phenolic as a bavarian weiss, but some of the character is there in a light banana nose.  Deep reddish brown colored with a huge off white head. Lots of rising carbonation. Great balance of sweet flavors and light hops and wheat dryness. Everything plays together well.  Flavor is initially sweet and malty. But there's definitely the dry tartness from high % of wheat in the grain bill. Very fruity and caramel flavors on the back end.  Full bodied and creamy on the palate. A little bit warming halfway through the glass. Body is not so big that it seems thick.  Very smooth and easy driking for an 8% beer. A benchmark beer for the style. Not necessarily the best (there's a czech brewery that makes a better one IMO) but if you want to know what a Weizen DoppelBock is all about, this is where to start.",Schneider Weisse G.

Poured into my snifter a dark brown, opaque and had a HUGE foamy tan head that I had to let die down for several minutes. The retention was some of the best I've ever seen. Reminiscent of a tripel. Good lacing. Sour fruits, wheat, chocolate and sweet malts, alcohol, bubblegum, candy sugars, over-ripe bananas. SO much going on here, its hard for a novice like me to get it all straight! Needless to say its extremely complex. The taste was sour cherries, wheat, alcohol, spices and malts. Once agian, so much its hard to tell. Though the mouthfeel was fizzy and bitter at first, later fading into a smooth sweetness, it was well balanced and very enjoyable. Quite drinkable, but the higher ABV might not allow you to enjoy the complexity after a few glasses. Try it.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,Zorro,4.5,"Cave aged bottle, bottled 2001.  Pours the standard Aventinus look at first and then I decided to swirl in the yeast. Adding cave aged yeast might not be the best way to enjoy it, I succeeded in adding brown yeast chips to the head. The head on the cave-aged version dissipates very much quicker than the fresh version. Color is a slightly paler shade of brown and is somewhat clearer. Carbonation level is at least the same as the non-aged version and seems to me to be a bit higher.  Smell is sweet and extremely nutty in aroma much like good dry sherry. There is a strong scent of heavy molasses now that makes this beer distinctly candy like. The trademark Aventinus spiciness has diminished to this point to smell much like a spiced wine and reminds me a great deal of Gluwein.  Taste is less sweet with a fairly strong molasses flavor and a good nutty flavor. Flavor seems to have morphed in to something like a Belgian Brown ale as the fruity and spicy flavors have melded with the molasses flavors. What is left is smooth Christmas spiced strong brown ale. The yeast chunks that I disturbed have mostly settled to the bottom of the Weizen glass by now.  Mouthfeel has diminished a bit, seems to be expected, as it does seem that lots of wheat protein solids have fallen out of suspension.  Drinkability remains good and there really arent any signs of oxidation, the high carbonation level and the cap seal were in perfect condition when this was opened 5 years after bottling. Possibly the aged version of Aventinus deserves a separate entry in the BA database?  500 ml bottle received from LuckySevens82 and BIF33 - Team Spring.",Schneider Weisse G.

Smell is spicy banana, the traditional wheat nose. Taste is a luscious banana bread with a soda like spritz following. Spiciness on the edges that mixes with a reasonable sweetness at the finish. Mouthfeel is nice and full at the start and thins out considerably in the finish probably due to that fine bubble carbonation. Oh so easy to quaff.

Slowly dissipates and leaves very nice lacing. Beer is hazy but light penetrates. Burnt orange in color.  Aroma is sweet and yeasty and alcoholic and coriander. Very pleasant aroma. Smells wheaty but looks bocky. Sweet aroma seems to dominate the overall smell. Spicy corriander and pepper are prominant as well.  Sweet tasting. Not quite as refreshing as a wheat beer. Alcoholic flavors as well as orange and lemon peel. Spiciness abounds which is great. Yeast rears its head and that Belgian candi sugar flavor as well.  A wonderful beer overall.

Poured it into a pilsner glass, and got a several inch tall head, which settled fairly quickly and left little lacing on the glass. It was a cloudy, medium amber color. Lots of champagne-like, tiny bubbles.  This smelled very much like a malty Belgian ale. Definite yeasty aromas with some sweet malt and banana aromas in the background. I wasn't expecting this much yeastiness.  The taste reminded me of a Belgian as well. Bubblegum, overripe bananas, yeast. I'm a little dissappointed in this. I was expecting it to be more like the doppelbocks I've had with rich maltiness, rather than like a Belgian ale. I wouldn't say it tastes bad, but it is not what I was looking for.  You can feel the carbonation all over the mouth, and it leaves a fairly dry palate in its wake. Not overly thick or chewy.  Overall, I'm disappointed in this beer, especially with its high ranking on the ""Best of"" list. It was rather expensive compared to other doppelbocks, but I don't think it was worth the extra $$. I probably won't buy this one again.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,EPseja,4.42,"Served from a 500ml. bottle at just below cellar temperature in a flute.  A - Pours a slightly murky, tawny brown color with orange highlights and a big, dense, creamy head that defies gravity. Lots of activity in the glass as bubbles rise from many points. Lacing is huge and curtainy while taking a sip, but slowly falls back without leaving much on the walls of the glass.  S - Big, overripe banana pervades the smell of this beer, mingling with other notes of organic yeast, light malts, spicy cloves and millipedes. Yes, millipedes. Shaking your head in disbelief? Google it. You'll see what I mean. Sort of a cross between wet, decaying wood and a strange chemical sweetness. Nevertheless, it's quite an excellent bouquet.  T - Right up front you'll find the refreshing character of a Weissbier. Yeasty with lemony hints. In the middle, the big malts shine through, giving a spicy sweetness that really balances the tartness. The swallow brings out a tinge of the alcohol, but that is quickly replaced by a lingering brown sugar taste in the aftertaste. Excellent depth and character. Big body without lack of refreshment.  M - Enters the mouth with commanding presence, slowly growing to a wonderful, mouth filling consistency. Slight tingle on the tongue, and a satisfying throat coating swallow.  D - I could drink this one all afternoon, but at 8% ABV, my common sense steers me clear. This beer is one of the most defining brands for the style. Superb.",Schneider Weisse G.

Accordind to the label this bottle was brewed in 2001. I let this warm to around 45º F and served in my UFO Weizen glass.  Appearance: Pours a hazy brown with thick beige head that thins at a moderate pace and eventually disappears completely. Large chucks of yeast settle at the bottom.  Smell: I detect a malty, caramel sweetness, with notes of dark fruit (raisins, upon thinking back). I get very light banana, something I could have missed had I not been looking for it, and light alcohol.  Taste: I get spicy clove flavors upfront, as well as fruity and caramel flavors in the center. The finish is lightly bitter, with warming alcohol.  Mouthfeel: This beer is moderately carbonated, and pleasantly tingly. It's medium-bodied and silky smooth.  Drinkability: Delicious, and easy to drink.

I am especially atuned to the aroma. Lots of cloves and yeast esters. They are in the taste as well. Aroma is very strong.  Good bit of depth with this beer. The esters remind me of cloves and other typical weizer esters.  Very much deserves its reputation.,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Orrshow,4.65,"Appearance - Pours a very deep color that appears to be a reddish brown. Its quite clouded. There is a good amount of thick head that is light is color. It dissipates to a cap and stays that way until the end.  Smell - Cloves and dark fruits such as currants and raisins stick out. There is that strong wheaty aroma with some yeast making its way to the nose. This smell makes me anxious to take a sip.  Taste - Amazing. Rich malty sweetness, dark fruits, and spice are all there. The wheat is definitely present along with the flavor of cloves. The alcohol is also very prominent and brings warmth to the beer.  Mouthfeel - The consistency of this beer is a little thicker...and I love that. The carbonation is nice and the alcohol presence does not make this beer at all overpowering.  Drinkablility - Perfect. This beer has everything I love in a good ale; complexity, robust flavors, and an eerie easiness to drink. Its scary how fast I emptied that bottle.  Aventinus will always have a reserved slot in my fridge. A world class ale.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

At first I get sweet perfume, then you get chocolate malts with plenty of good spices and some bubble gum. Has a smooth palate with easy drinking flavor. Light on carbination and lacks some finish but has a nice duration. Has a medium body. The alcohol is very well hidden. The flavors really come out, even taste some cherry. Very easy drinking, sips extremely well.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,VoodooBrew,4.12,"The nose opens up big and fruity, with hints of bubble gum. This beer's wheat origins are evident on the palate, with cloves, fruit, spice, and a healthy dose of malt. Balance comes in the form of a subtle bitterness that finishes things off. Aventinus is pleasantly spritzy although not at all overcarbonated. This is a very solid beer; however I think I prefer its cousin the Eisbock a little more.  Big ups to xeryuspool for sharing this with me.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,lpayette,3.81,"Poured into a weizen glass, this brew is a very interesting color and one that I've never seen before. Kind of like a grade B maple syrup with more clarity and a creamy white head.  Smells are fruity and floral. Banana dominates, mixed with alcohol, and perhaps some bubblegum notes.  Tastes- hard to pick a dominant flavor, but the there is banana, clove, a fruity strong alcohol aspect.  The carbonation creates ""honey combs"" at the top of the brew. Small bubbles around the outside. The beer mellows out to become more drinkable as it warms, but I still found it to be less drinkable than most beers.

This beer pours very nicely and looks almost chocolatey with it's dark amber color. It smells very nice, too, hints of cherry and citrus. The taste is a bit heavier than my favorite hefe weiss, but it is very, very clean... no aftertaste (I don't like aftertaste) and great flavor. The mouthfeel is probably one of the best I've tasted. This beer is as smooth as velvet. Drinkability is also good. This is a good beer. It's definitely worth all the ""hype"" my fellow BAs have created on the site.

Heavy wheat aroma at first; underlying clove scents with faint presence of fruity esters (overripe banana, spiced cider). Sweet banana and clove character immediately come to the fore in the first sip. Malty wheat on the followthrough. Something of a sourish vegetable aftertaste. Mouthcoating elixir, this one is. Full-bodied and slick. Banana burps. Not my favorite style, but this beer is so well-made, I can't help but find it extremely drinkable. Deserving of all accolades it receives.",Schneider Weisse G.

Appearance- The beer pours a light raisiny cognac, with the gorgeous head that has earned its place in beer publications everywhere... four tall fingers of soapy, persistent head that performs with vigor and grace inside the glass. After settling for several minutes, it is stalwart and sexy. Medium, chunky lacing is left behind.  Smell- Huge banana esters and clove leap out of my glass, landing somewhere behind me. Full and obese. The alcohol is completely hidden amongst the gigantic wheat character, but the aroma is unmistakably Weizenbock.  Taste- A full, generous dose of wheat and bananas coat the tongue, conceding to the malty, spicy environment that surrounds it. Complete and round.

Aroma is incredible, banana, clove, malty sweetness, wheat, solvent, and tons of yeast. Super complex nose that only gets better as the glass gets emptier.  Flavor again is incredible. A perfect blend of a thick german hefe and a thick dopplebock. Bananas, wheat, cloves, sweet without being cloying. Perfectly refreshing on a hot summer day, or nice and warming in the dead of winter. No matter how many times I drink this, I'm always amazed bby how good it is.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy, while light carbonation dances on the tip of your tongue. Drinkability is also high, as this beer hides it's alcohol well, and each sip begs for another.

Head slowly receded and left only a ring around the glass and no lacing. Much more of a caramel and chocolate aroma, with subdued spices and hints of banana. I find more molasses, chocolate, caramel, bread, with only a little bit of banana. Taste is definately much more mellowed after nearly 6 years, but it is pretty nicely blended.

72,224,supernaut,4.31,"What a great looking beer. Extremely rough and unfiltered. You get the sense that this beer looks just like those consumed hundreds of years back. Pours a very murky and muddly brown. Not overly dark but a bit cloudy. Loads of sediment only add to the allure There's a pretty nice head and a bit of lacing to match The truly great aspect of this beer's appearance however, lies in the rawness. Very intense.  The smell is one of complex sweetness and spice. Nothing mindblowing, but pleasant if not intrigueing nonetheless.  Tasting this organic brew was not the slightest bit disappointing. Incredibly smooth, presenting some mild fruit (pear, banana, non-citrus) initially, and providing an almost cinammon/milmint-like spice toward the end (the bottle claims clove). Finishes extremely cleanly with a very pleasant and balanced yeastiness. The alcohol never interferes with the smoothness, yet does manage to add a pleasant ""glow"" toward the end (hence the 8.00% abv).  You just want to deliberately sip this brew over and over again to extract out all the greatness. Precisely what a German bier should be. Makes me want to move back.

I poured the entire contents of the bottle into my glass, including the yeast at the bottom, so it was nice and cloudy. The aroma was heavenly with whiffs of bubblegum, spices and malt in the nose. Taste was equally impressive with notes of clove, spices, chocolate and malt in the palate.

I do what I can to add all of the yeast, but it is well compacted and some remains in the bottle.  Cotton candy, bubble gum. What an unusual scent. It's like a fruity Belgian to the tenth power! Very one sided and powerful, but not unpleasant.  Fruity, fruity, bananas, just a tiny bit of orange peel zest, marshmallow sugar - oak, mahogany, wood chips - spicy, clove/coriander yeast and hops. Holy smokes, there are a TON of VERY distinct flavors in here. It's like a car running up through the gears. I can taste each one of them individually and in turn. Extremely full-flavored. This is a sipper, for sure. It's damn near a Belgian. Try to drink quickly and fusel alcohols really stand out.  A bit spritzy / seltzery on the tongue, unfortunately, which is a bit of a drawback. It's not bad, but being a bit smoother and less carbonated would complement the full flavors better than the carbonation does as is.  Very nice! This deserves to be rated so highly.

It was very cidery in scent with tons of floral notes. The only deduction I had was that an alcohol quality was sensed during wafting. It tastes of malty richness as wheat fills the mouth. It is exceptional for the style but a tinge too sweet for my taste buds. The mouthfeel was creamy and rich but not too thick- fantastic.

I guess it would be a caramelized malt, but it does not have nearly the impact that color would make me guess it would have. The other thing is that the alcohol is extremely well masked.

72,224,geexploitation,3.58,"This is a review for the Aventinus 2001 vintage, consumed in 2006. Basically this is the regular Aventinus, but brewed in 2001 and aged by the brewery -- which is an interesting idea, as it gives people who don't have appropriate aging spaces (such as myself) a chance to taste this beer in a more ""mature"" state. I tasted this beer side-by-side with a bottle of ""regular"" Aventinus purchased at the same time.  Pours almost the color of polished cherry wood -- quite dark and much more dark than regular Aventinus. The aroma is quite distinctive -- in this beer, the typical clove/banana/spice combo is pushed to the back of the nose, and up in front is a very sweet, candi/beet sugar type of smell. Something you'd expect more in a very dark Belgian winter ale than in a German bock. This sweetness is also present in the flavor, the complexity of which has been diminished to something cloying. I keep thinking this is what concentrated date syrup would be like. Not terribly appetizing or interesting. Mouthfeel is a bit surprising: it's a bit thinner than regular Aventinus, perhaps just a bit watery.  Overall, sad to say, I don't think aging is the best thing to do with a bottle of Aventinus. Aging has reduced the complexity of this beer, in aroma, flavor and even mouthfeel, with the only recompense being more candi-sugar-like sweetness. Not a good tradeoff. As an interesting experiment, I recommend trying this (especially alongside a bottle of regular Aventinus), but I, personally, can't imagine drinking this vintage beer without pairing it with very specific food items (the most sugary roasted sweet meats, some desserts). Worth a try but not a revelation by any means.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Appearance: The beer has a very cloudy murky dark copper coloration. There is a minimal head. No lacing is apparent in the glass.  Smell: The beer has a massive sweet maltyness. There is a biscuity quality that when combined with the spicy cinnoman and apples creates a faux apple pie smell.  Taste: The beer really delivers on the smell. The hops have mellowed out. The malty sweetness combines with an apple pie kind of taste. There is the wierd prescence of bannanas in the beer.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is medium bodied. Carbonation is low. The beer is a very smooth drinking beer overall. I have had this one alot fresher and I seem to recall it being better fresh.

I'm excited to try an aged Aventinus and wonder what the differences are between the 5 to 6 year aged and the original. I don't know if it's because of the aging process, but there is a little white powderof some sort around the rim underneath the cap.  The beer pours out a little less head than a fresh hefeweizen, but I can only guess that that is due to the aging process. The lacing is a little less pronounced. The same dark brown color is present, but looks more inviting.  Smell is very spicy and very fruity and flavorful. It's excellent! It has so many flavors like raspberry. It's very mellow with a little more coffee tone.  The taste is familiar, but with slightly different tones. I taste a dark fruit that is light. I also taste clove with a hint of nutmeg.

72,224,falloutsnow,4.3,"2012 review (has it really been six years since my review of this)  Bottle from Hyvee in West Omaha, NE, USA Poured into a Weihenstephaner weizen glass 11.340 stamped on label.  Pours a big, fluffy, hefeweizen-style off-white head that bubbles down to a centimeter-thick layer of tiny bubbles for the duration of the drinking session. As the foam descends, it leads to modest lacing on the sides of glass, giving one a clear view of beer’s deep mahogany color under normal lighting and light amber or garnet colors when held up to the bulb. Smoky and hazy in appearance due to the yeast, allowing just enough light through to see shadow imprints of my hand on the glass. Nearly perfect.  Aroma opens with musty yeastiness, bananas, and mild wheat malt. This is followed by a solid brown sugar scent, concluding with dark, dried fruit aromas, such as prunes, with added mild alcohol.  Taste opens with strong, dark wheat malt joined closely to flavors of vanilla, brown sugar, and prunes or figs. General pie spice spiciness is present, a bit of nutmeg joined to the heat of cloves. Closes with slightly tart wheat malt and caramelized sugar sweetness joined to modestly detectable ethanol. Aftertaste is of wheat malt twang with caramelized sugar and mild yeast.  Medium to medium-heavy body with modest carbonation that leads to a pillowy, comfortingly smooth mouthfeel. Mildly bitter, dry aftertaste that leaves one wanting more.  A: Pours a big, fluffy, hefeweizen-style off-white head that bubbles down to a centimeter-thick layer of tiny bubbles for the duration of the drinking session. As the foam descends, it leads no lacing on the sides of glass, giving one a clear view of beer's deep brown color under normal lighting and light amber or garnet colors when held up to the bulb. Smoky and hazy in appearance due to the yeast, but by no means impenetrably dark or thick. S: Following the wheat style, the expected yeast smells lead into a strong burnt sugariness and ends with a deep sensation of sticking one's nose into a pile of prunes with an added mild alcohol aroma. All scent seems to diminish as the beer warms, with seemingly no new or fresh emphasis arising from the temperature change; strange. I would have liked to see a moderately constant or temperature-dimensional nose. T: What first hits the tongue is a spicy clove aspect that starts out strong and weakens throughout the entire drinking experience. Alongside this there is a sweet, caramelized brown sugar taste that coalesces with the traditional banana flavor of other hefeweizens. Essences of slightly sour plum arise in the finish, with a slight hop presence for bittering effect. M: Medium to heavy body with light, barely noticeable carbonation that leads to quite a smooth mouthfeel. Mildly bitter, dry aftertaste that leaves one wanting more. D: Used a standard weizen glass for pouring this one, which worked out perfectly with its typical weiss head and rich color spectrum. I enjoyed the beer less as it warmed, however, for the deeper aspects of the taste and smell, the appealing parts of the beer to me, began to fade as this happened. That lessens my overall scoring in the smell and taste category, as well as this one. When I first started sampling the beer it was quite good, and remained above average throughout, but the decrease in its otherwise great attributes led me to conclude it as ""above average"" instead of purely excellent. I could, however, drink this relatively often on its positive aspects alone.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,petemoss14,4.77,"750 ml bottle into Aventinus tulip glass.  This beer will always be special for me. I guess you could say it was the first beer that I fell in love with. Back in summer 2001, before my senior year in college, I was down in the DC/Baltimore area with a couple friends. We were at a bar near the harbour area in Baltimore that I can't remember the name of. But it had a great beer selection. Aventinus, which even then I loosely considered my favorite beer, was on the menu, and I had to have it. It was served in the classic Aventinus tulip glass -- the first time I had seen this glass. The bouquet the beer released in its proper glass solidified my love of beer forever.  Which brings me to tonight's tasting, in my own Aventinus tulip.  Pours a hazy, medium-deep brown, with a big, frothy head that sticks around for awhile.  The wonderful bouquet explodes from the glass and hits me from a foot away before I'm even done pouring, sending me into premature beergasm. Tons of fruit -- plums, figs, rum-raisin, caremelized bananas, Juicy Fruit gum, cloves, anise, alcohol esters. Incredible.  It tastes of banana bread, spiced rum, and dark ripe fruits -- dates, raisins, figs.  Silky smooth on the palate, thanks to fine carbonation. Finishes dry and warming. I could drink this all night.  I can't say enough about this beer. I have had many, many great beers since that day in Baltimore nearly five years ago, but I keep coming back to Aventinus, my first love.",Schneider Weisse G.

Slight alcohol notes.  Taste is similiar to the nose. This brew has a strong dark fruit presence with the plum flavor taking the lead. Sweet malt with hints of nut and caramel. A touch of hops in the finish with spices such as pepper and clove. The high ABV is well hidden.  Mouthfeel is medium and highly carbonated.

72,224,Sycodrummer,4.5,"Poured from the bottle into the Aventinus Weizen glass the beer was a mohogany brown color with three fingers of white fuffy head. The head was very blossoming and needed a carefull pour so as not to allow it to spill over the glass. The finished pour had the head crown the glass like an ice cream cone. Lots of carbonation bubbles streamed up the glass and continued to do so throughout the sample. Some lacing, but not as much as I expected. Still one of the best looking beers I've seen.  The smell was floral and fruitty. Raisin and banana aromas with malt, slight chocolate, caramel, freshly buttered toast.  The tast has so many flavors and so well balanced that it's hard to pick them out. A definite floral fruitty palate is the dominant taste. Chocolate covered raisons, bananas, some spicy clove, figs, and plums. Malty in the finish and very smooth to drink. Alcohol is well masked until the beers warms at which time you can tell this is of bock strength.  Mouthfeel is creamy in consistancy with a firm medium body, and well carbonated.  Supremely drinkable and enjoyable. So many flavors might lead to sensory overlaod, but the beer is well balanced with the fruit and spice and slight chocolate all complimenting each other.

Flavor leans toward malty with a slight citrus, slight sour edge. Perfect like that. Caramelish malts are evident is balance the sour. Something very very nice, but unexplainable in the finish. Uber satisfying to drink. Very little hop presence. I am a hop head but would not mess with this beer and add more. Top beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Contains a mix of raisin-like fruit scents, clove spice, and alcohol. Slightly nutty.  Taste- Sublime & chewy. Sweet and tangy up front, with notes of dark fruits and carmelized malt. Clove flavors hit the taste buds later on, and the alcohol lends an estery, fruity taste to the finish. Overall hop bitterness is low. Alcohol is present, but well-concealed.  Verdict- Sweet, sweet nectar! This is loaded with flavor, but it's not raucous or overbearing. It's complex and mysterious; a wonderful, delicious beer.",Schneider Weisse G.

Light smell, malty with hints of bananas, but a deeper roasted aroma that is inviting and altogether delicious.  The taste. Jesus, what can I say about the taste? It's got the prominent malty characteristics of a doppelbock. It has the crisp, clean taste of a hefeweizen plus the over-the-top banana and wheat-taste of a dunkel. There's a huge yeast presence in the aftertaste. Vinous and grape flavors are abounding. Seriously? One of the best beers I've ever had.

Just go here to see what I'm talking about: http://home.earthlink.net/~omniron/pictures_glasses/aventinus.jpg  Getting back on topic here, the appearance is brownish orange with an off-white head. The aroma is slightly spicy like cloves or cinnamon, but not as pungent as either of those. The taste brings out a bit more fruitiness, much like a wheat beer, and the spice is still evident. Medium bodied and easy on the palate for an 8% ABV beer. I didn't know the ABV until I wrote this review and I would have guessed that this was less than 8%. Drinkability was good, but I was ready to try something else after this beer. Actually, I was ready to put my head down on my pillow and go to sleep after this beer since it was preceded by a DFH World Wide Stout, haha.

Taste was complex, with malts (no hop flavour), some rust with a hint of tangy blackcurrant. Quite superb. Alcohol in the background.  Nice smooth mouthfeel.

Smell -- Like a hefe weizen with caramel, brown sugar and raisins. Or like some type of homemade fruit bread. It's complex and very enjoyable.  Taste -- My only benchmark here is a hefe weizen. It tastes like a hefe weizen with burnt or caramelized characteristics. Reminds me of bakery in a way.  Mouthfeel -- Medium, but on the heavier side.

A deeply layered smell, very delectable.  Taste is quite vinous and wine-like also, with an astringent dry finish. rich fruits prevail with hints of dark alcohol, like rum. Taste is layered and complex. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, but a little less velvety than I would have liked. If it was a little more filling and caressing it would be great.

This is sort of a hefe meets dunkel, meets doppelbock. Fans of many different styles will thoroughly enjoy this master work by our German friends.  This a medium to heavy bodied beer. Easy drinking.

Beautiful dark amber color with a rich, tan head...didn't last long , but looked great when it arrived. Smelled spicy with a prunish, malt character...sweet bread dough smell...very inviting. Tasted fantastic...rich fruit, caramel, malt; the right amount of alcohol just about coming through, and a spice very much like cardamon .... and maybe clove..not overpowering...a great, complex brew. Nice amount of sweet... barely a bitter hint, and a very smooth medium/full body finish. Carbonation was low , which was fine for this. With the 8% alcohol, heaviness of the beer and German food, one of these was enough...but will definitely be looking for this one again.   Update..had a bottle at home..here's some differences from the above review: Head much better and it lasted for the whole drink. Carbonation..medium..doesn't quit. Clove smell and taste more pronounced...still going with the cardamon taste. A great beer !

There are tons of carbonation streams charging to the top through a beautiful burnt amber, copper-highlighted liquid. Smells fruity and rich with cloves, bananas, and raisins. Distinctly wheat. The first taste is initially bracing with alcohol, but this immediately disappears and the rich malty sweetness with the cloves and bananas appear. There are lingering alcohol notes which are warming. Medium bodied with vibrant carbonation. Slightly slick, but relatively light on the tongue. Absolutely drinkable, perhaps dangerously so. This was fantastic and worth tracking down.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

I think I was correct, however the big difference I noticed this time was the lack of carbonation in the bottle. This really detracted from the brew, in my opinion.  Pours a translucent brown with a decently thick head. Smells of caramel, figs, almonds, maybe some vanilla. Tastes very strong of dried fruit and caramel. The lack of carbonation really made it have a robitussin-like mouthfeel. Drinkability wasn't so high. Tastes great, but towards the end I was a bit overwhelmed.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,marcobrau,3.75,"I've heard that dunkel weizen and bocks are German Christmas favorites, so I decided that I would get a bottle of Aventinus and celebrate Christmas while watching the new Bavarian Pope.  This beer poured with a lot of carbonation, which is good for a wheat beer, but then the monstrous head eventually drops to nothing (which I think is typical for most of the German weiss bier that I'vd had.) The Aventinus has a certain lightly spiced caramel apple fruitiness to it, (which surfaces in the aroma, too) that is rather tasty, and hides the alcohol content of this brew pretty well. I seem to remember the spiciness being more assertive, but perhaps my palate has changed, and not the beer. I found lots of yeast in the bottle and I tried to rouse it so it would fall into my glass to add more flavor. I did appreciate the soft mouthfeel of this beer and it's surprising drinkability, but for all the hype I think it could be a bit more complex. I will drink this beer again, despite my criticism.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Tastes of tangy prunes, sour plumbs and a musky root beer with a nice, unobtrusive sweetness. The flavors are marvelously blended together. I have a bit of trouble picking apart whats bitter from the hops and what is spicy from the yeast. Very well done.  The mouth feel changes with temperature. As it is cold, the carbonation is very light, but it peaks as it warms up to a full mouth of foamy bubbles and dies down again as it approaches room temperature.

Smell is alcohol, rotting banana, and rum-soaked raisin bread. It all has a shimmering, magical quality to it. Flavor is not roasty like one might expect from the color. There is a little coffee, but it is subtle compared to the candyish caramel, cracked poppyseed, and a little citrus in the finish. Alcohol bites a bit and warms the lips. Malty, with a bitterness smoothly taking over after a second. Medium body, high carbonation. A bit too sizzly for a while after pouring.  Great beer. Only the banana really differentiates this from a BSD to my palate. Morphing dark flavors reminds me of Maudite a bit, but this is heavier and sweeter. Great to have on occasion.",Schneider Weisse G.

Thick head on top that receded down to a not insignificant coating. Fairly heavy carbonation. Nose is full of a cacaphony of subtle smells of wheat, banana and cloves.  Cannot find any sense of the alochol in the flavor. The taste just knocked me off the couch. The wheat provides a nice sweet base but is extremely pronounced by strong banana and cloves. The cloves pick up a bit to a slight hop presence that creates a wonderful balance.

Yeast and wheat notes are also present. Some hints of spice add to the complexity, along with some banana bread. Slight ethanol is noticeable as the beer warms and the malty flavors become more complex.  mouthfeel: The carbonation is on the lower end of the high range, and the body a lighter medium.  taste: A mixture of dark and light fruits, slightly sweet, teases my tastebuds. The spice is less noticeable on the palate than it was on the nose, but is still there. I notice some dates and similar dark sugars.

72,224,mrasskicktastic,4.8,"A - Pours an espresso brown with a two finger head that lingers for minutes and leaves nice little patches of lacing. Sadly with time that find their way down the sides of the glass. Even though this beer is very dark, I can see carbonation bubbling to replace the head. It keeps a small head almost indefinitely (certainly longer than the life expectancy of the beer!)  S - Smells strongly of the sweet malt. Esters from bananas, dates and faint cherries entice me to drink. These three are accompanied by cloves and allspice to further the cause. The odor is amazing. It is a shame it isn't stronger.  T - Delicious. It is moderately sweet from a strong malt presence. Bananas, dates, tart cherries and figs make a presence, while some cloves, allspice, faint nutmeg and a bit of white pepper spice it up. There is a very strong toast presence - and it is well toasted at that. Abv is in the flavor. Even so, the alcohol taste works - it is simply a character trait. This weizenbock is almost everything that I hoped to find in a wheat beer. Banana bread beer. Mmmm.  M - Not quite as thick as I expected. It is thick and quite frothy, but I expected a more chewy texture from this beer. Although, I must say the texture is still excellent. The beer is very refreshing and smooth.  D - Well at the price, 8% abv and .5L bottles, this isn't the ideal session beer. Although any session with this beer would be a wonderful session indeed! It is sweet, but well rounded enough to be an excellent compliment to a meal. I will definitely drink this again. It is my favorite beer to date (I do have a Rochefort 10 in the fridge though).

Hints of vanilla and bubblegum are in the background. A very soft bready aroma smoothes over the other flavors and the finish has a very delicate hop bitterness.  T- The soft taste of wheat is complimented with some caramel and bready notes. The finishes with a bit of a carbonic taste but no real hop flavor. The soft taste of banana is very faint and a bit more pronounced as it warms. The slight tartness in the malt comes through as it warms also.  M- This beer has a medium-full mouthfeel with some creamy texture to it. No alcohol warmth but a hint of fizz on the tongue.  D- This is a great wheat beer that has increased its complexity with all the dark malt.

An orangish brown on bottom that lets a litle light through leading up to a deep purple tinted brown at the thicker part of the glass. Lots of carbonation feeds a decent sized foamy head at the top.  S - Huge smell of tart cherries/berries on the initial whiff. Alcohol is definitely pushing through here. Got a nice spicy kick in the nose that hits the nostrils hard. A very nice smell.  T - Basically indescribable on the first sip. Simply different than most beers I've ever tried. I'm definitely tasting some of the flavor described on the 2001 vintage tag. A bit of chocolate under the spicy flavor. Some fruity alcoholic kick mixed in there. Balanced nicely with a nutty flavor.  M - A nice amount of carbonation with a fairly thick texture in the mouth.  D - Keeps me coming back for more. I definitely can sip on this one till the last drop.

This beer is so nicely balanced that it just shows you an astringent taste and quickly dissolves to at citrus taste and a rich mouthfeel.

The aroma is sweet grapes, kind of winelike accompanied by dark roasted malt. It really jumps out at you after opening the bottle.

72,224,andjusticeforale,4.37,"Out of a pint + purple bottle; poured a dark hazy black-brown with a head with poor retention.  The aroma took a minute or two to settle into a smell of a typical dunkel weizen; wheat smells of banana and well just very traditional, some clove and residual sweetness. No yeast detectible to me, no sediment that I could appreciate.  The initial taste was a toasted wheat and banana and clove, some dried fruit and raisin/plums. The mouthfeel was medium to full, and the big chunky fruity meatiness of the wheat was then offset by two things; first, the alcohol, warming, present, not-unwelcome, finishing like a sip from a snifter of brandy. This coupled with the mouthfeel, a more than-normal carbonation for a wheat beer, with a small bite, made this feel classy. This was simply the thing that distinguished this from just being a big, flat apple juice tasting dunkel.  I read another review and saw a comparison to Victory Moonglow, they are very similar beers in flavor and taste, but the Aventinus has a more refined mineral quality to the water, and more brandy-alcohol-medicinal phenols in the finish. Otherwise, it is true, they are the same animal. This is worth a try, if for nothing else, to taste a classic and elegant portrayal of the strong dark wheat style.",Schneider Weisse G.

Taste is very sweet -- raisins and other fruits again, very little actual alcohol flavour, unlike the smell. Low carbonation as well.

72,224,daliandragon,4.18,"You don't see many deep purple beer labels but this beer is revered in many circles so I guess we'll let it slide. Pours a thick, sediment filled dark brown color with a thick head that dissipates quickly and not much lacing. The scent is fruity, with the requisite cloves and banana. Alcohol is also easily detectable in the nose. A flavorful but mellow taste with a silky texture and almost no carbonation. The prime active agents in the flavor are roasted malt, caramel and chocolate. The alcohol is present but nicely understated. A smooth , creamy aftertaste is also a plus. This was first go with this beer for me but it's a clear winner; a complex, well sculpted beer that reminds me of a Belgian in its artistic interpretation of a style. Go get one and drink it.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

I guess a weizenbock is like making love to a beatiful women; you can't always score but when you do it makes it all worthwhile. drinkability: high. yeah i wouldn't as to me this is just a doubledunklewiezen. which is cool but a regular dunkles are a damn underrated style.",Schneider Weisse G.

Deep reddish brown color with thick head which quickly disappears to a thin ring around the glass.  I'm trying to increase my exposure to German beers, and this one proves that the Germans know what they're doing. Aroma is extremely inviting, bready and fruity.

72,224,Cwrw,4.62,"Aventinus is one of those beers I have always consumed and almost take for granted. Recently I ordered a batch from my local store though--it had been a while and I felt like rediscovering it. In its absence I found a new appreciation for this phenomenal beer. Just seeing the attractive purple-labelled bottle is enough to make me salivate. I want it at my local store for good, because this is truly a world class German beer. It always pours into my weizen glass nicely, if done slowly and carefully. The head can be as enormous as you see fit. Ultra-creamy, off-white bubbles form and give off the wonderful aroma very intensely after pouring. Sheets of lace cover the sides, sticking tenaciously, or sometimes running down the glass. The beer is full of colour: purples and burgundy, caramel or murky brown, ruby, maple and amber. Always impermeable too: the beer looks thick and hazy. The beer's appearance literally induces drinking. The first big, chunky aroma from this beast is the banana. Fresh, strong, almost rotten banana smells. Dried banana. The intense banana is not artificial smelling at all, as some unfiltered wheat beers smell as though they have had banana extract dumped into them. This is refreshing, natural and extremely appetising. Behind the fruitiness is the strong sweet maltiness with a little of the warming, port-like alcohol. The yeastiness is delicious, reminding me of the very first German hefeweizens I ever tried. Dates, prunes, light licorice, plums, and red wine. The malts add some saltiness, some meatiness. This is one beer very easy to over-sniff: the aroma is massively complex, yet very powerful. Sometimes you can smell it too much and it numbs your nose for a few minutes. The aroma is intense and can be overpowering, but only if you let it. The aroma is like a very good hefeweizen, with the addition of more alcohol and more maltiness, which begs the question: Why are there not more weizenbocks in this world? Again, I could go on and on about the smells in this beer's aroma, but we must move on to the taste. The taste could inevitably be compared to rich red wine. There literally is a very strong red grape taste in the beer. Even the tannic dryness is present. The finish clearly evinces that this is a beer though--strong banana yeastiness, perfumy hops and rich malting. The alcohol does come through quite strongly in the middle, but it is never overpowering--instead it reminds me of the taste one might get from warm brandy. Delectable dark fruits and mouth-filling maltiness. There are enough strong tastes here to deter the second sip of a beer-neophyte, but once this beer hacks its way to your beer-heart, this is at once both one of the most refreshing and complex strong beers you could ingest. Think the revitalising characteristics of a cold hefe with the arcane complexity of an aged barleywine. The carbonation on this beer is medium, the mouthfeel definitely full. A beer equally satisfying on a cold night or a warm one. I have tried Aventinus with a variety of different cheeses, and they all complement it very well. Try aged cheddar or gorgonzola--they were particularly good with this beer. This is one of those beers that truly does make Germany the preeminent beer producer; and it is one of those beers that we should feel privileged to experience every time we take a sip.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,SwillBilly,4.35,"Appearance: Pours a dark amber, the color of Coke of Pepsi. Nice, tightly bubbled 2"" off-white head, dissipates leaving little lacing on the glass.  Smell: Sweet and fruity malts, plum like, hints of caramel.  Taste: Beginning is sweet malt, hints of dark berry fruits, caramel. Very clean finish.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, velvety, almost creamy. Perfect carbonation level.  Drinkability: Extremely drinkable. Typically not my style of beer BUT, I'm really starting to like Weizenbocks. Super easy to drink, alcohol well hidden. Malty and sweet.

Taste- watery and thin with nothing more than clove and pepper. Mouthfeel- watery. Slight bubbly carbonation.  Overall- The first sip gives you all this clove and pepper, and just when you think the beers about to kick it up a notch... it doesn't. A beer I could drink a few of, but not worthy of the price.

72,224,edmundfitzoil,4.7,"I bought this bottle up in Portland at a Whole Foods Market.  The color was a unique color that can be called a hazy, almost purple hued amber color. The beer poured with a big, beautiful head that retained very well. Lacing hung out around the top half of the glass. The nose was sweet banana and with some yeasty, spicy elements to it as well. The taste was spectacular, and no beer that I've encountered compares. The taste ranges from both bananas and also darker fruites to bready and doughy. This beer is complex, and my girlfriend commented about it's favorable comparison to wine. An excellent brew. Warmed nicely and allowed more flavors to slowly peak out. This is a medium to full bodied beer that retains it's high drinkability because of the complex taste. I didn't want to put this down, and I am already considering driving up to Portland to pick up a few more bottles. One truly great brew.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Poured into my big ole' weizen glass, the head took up half the height at first. The bubbles swirled around like living organisms until they settled into sweet beer. Once I tasted this, the malts and banana flavors were brilliant--sweet, rich, beautiful...poifect. This is unique. I don't know of any other beers that taste like this...or look like it. It's dark purple, dear heavens. You have to try this just to say you did, or because it's one of the best brews out there. Great. Bold. Innovative. Try it, my friend.",Schneider Weisse G.

Pours a cloudy(yeast) orange-tinted brown with about an inch head that dissipates quickly to a standard collar. Smell is rich and full of banana bread, clove and loads of yeast spice--malty and sweet. Taste upfront is deep caramelized banana wheatiness. The hefe characteristic is magnified to epic proportions. Very round flavor. Then there's a slow progression into a warming clove finish. Hops are nominally present for bittering only. Delicious. Delicious banana burps. Mouthfeel is low medium but the carbonation is strong, working to create a very creamy mouthfeel, not unlike some belgian strong ales. Utterly drinkable at 8%, but one is more than enough for my tastes. I still prefer standards doppels.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Flavor is a very rich blend of sharp wheat flavors blended with fruity and spicy flavors contributed by the yeast. Alcohol wafts into the nasal passage as it dries out upon swallowing. Some spicy hop notes are noticable. This weizenbock is balanced, flavorful, potent and technically flawless.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

A look that is prototypical of a dark wheat (dark mohogany and clearly hazy!?), but after that, it's nearly perfect. Aromas are that of a light barleywine with bubblegum (juicy fruit) and esters (banannas and cloves). The flavors are intensely similar. Bigger and bolder sweetness than expected in wheat beers but complex and bold nonetheless. More akin to and Urbock. So is the body, texture, and mouthfeel. Wheat-like malty/bready flavors show nicely from nose to finish. Sweet and malty in the finish and with a fruity, warming aftertaste. One of the best beers out there.",Schneider Weisse G.

There is a richness to the smell, a tone of quality and solidity. Also a strong bite of clove and malt to the odor... excellent smelling brew.  Incredible tasting beer. Fruity, zesty, and rich. Lots of banana, with the addition of dark fruit. I cannot taste too much of the chocolate that the brew says is in the taste, but a small hint of toffee is certainly there. As the beer warms, this becomes more evident. There is a brevity and tightness to the finish that is common in many high-quality hefe's.  The mouthfeel is rich, creamy, yet lively. A delight as soon as it hits your tongue.  All in all, what an incredible beer... a beautiful example of how hefe's and bocks can be combined to create an outstanding brew.

72,224,danielharper,3.88,"Purchased from Strong Bros. Liquor Store, Fayetteville, TN.  An excellent pour from a 16.9 oz bottle leaves a thick foamy head atop a deep roasted brown body. Looks thick and inviting, very high marks for appearance here. Topping off the glass from the bottle only increases the overall head and thus, the overall experience.  Interesting aroma, full of malty presence and smelling very much like a dopplebock. It has that ""roasted"" flavor that I associate strongly with memories of the crock-pot growing up, beneath which it has a greater complexity of citrus and a hint of banana. I've never had a weizenbock before, but I imagine it's supposed to smell something like a hefeweizen mixed with a dopplebock. High marks.  Very interesting flavor. Kind of tangy up front with the citrus taste, with more of a coffee, almost stoutish backend. Fascinating in the way the two flavors mix together -- it almost seems like flavors this disparate would get in each other's way, but here I think it works pretty well. Slight astringent flavor due to the high alcohol.  Mouthfeel is thick and prominent as anticipated, but it goes down smoothly and easily. Not the highlight of the beer, but enjoyable nonetheless.  Overall drinkability is decent -- I like this beer just fine, and will buy it again, but it's not one of my favorites, and at nearly five dollars a bottle, these are a bit steep on the price for regular consumption.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,asabreed,4.84,"For all the hype, all the great reviews, and the fact that I can get this at my nearby Kroger in Richmond, I'm now even more ridiculously impressed at how good this is. 1 pt 9 oz bottle.  Appearance: Lacing isn't crazy, but the head stays put on top of the beer, dissipating slowly with each pour. Unfiltered wheat haze with amber and brown undertones.  Smell: A fantastic mesh of clove, banana, slight cream, and malt at the forefront. Some slight dark fruit and chocolate undetones. This is absolutely ridiculous it's so good, and I'm having trouble getting my nose out of it.  Taste: As I'm tasting this, I'm thinking to myself, ""Is this for real?"" Beautiful malt sweetness, banana, clove, and cream. The aftertaste lingers for long on the tongue, and it should be savored. I have to say, the complexity here is NOT the point; it's that what's here is balanced so smoothly, so beautifully, and so tastefully, that it certainly, to me, warrants an exceptional rating. So goddamn good.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, medium to full-bodied, medium carbonation that fits the creamy and fuller body of the beer. Wonderful.  Drinkability: I had no clue what I was in for. This may be the beer that I expected worlds from and finally got them in return. I can't wait to get more of this, and that it's so readily available to me makes it almost laughable.  I wish I hadn't had Aventinus as my first Weizenbock, but either way I'm certainly getting some more.

Kind of light head that fizzes for a while and then settles down to a remaining thin head that stays for the duration. Right away you can smell that sweet malty fruit aroma as well as some grainy wheat aroma on further inspection.  Nice medium creamy mouthfeel with a bit of alchohol warmth. Flavor is clove and prune with a hint of banana and vanilla surrounded by a malty grainy wheat body, a hint of salt on the tip of the tongue.Taste is classic dunkleweissen with a heavy dose of malty bock. Just like you would expect but amazing how smooth they are together. A fair amount of tartness if you let it linger in you mouth a bit. This is an awesome beer with tons of complexity, taste even changes a bit as it warms and as you get into more yeast toward the bottom it becomes more bready.

A: in a (dry) 300ml weissbier glass, it pours a hazy, dark-caramel colour, coming with an effervescent, off-white thick beer head, so creamy and frothy even when the lively carbonation settles down it stays there without any trouble--looking everlasting, incredibly decent and elegant... S: upfront is deeply fruity aroma of hefe-weizen, mixed of ripe bananas+banana skin+green guava, plus a refreshingly spicy note of clove, and profoundly sour-sweet wheatish grainy aroma. If ""blind-sniffing"" this beer, one might be tricked to believe it's just another pale-coloured hefe-weizen with a stronger, assertive malt and sugary presence~~ Very balanced as well as very delicious. T: upfront on the palate comes a profoundly fruity (mainly banana-skin and the classic mixed-tropical fruity taste of hefe-weizen) flavour, followed immediately by creamy, deeply brown-sugary (close to caramel) palate of dark malts, on top of an underlyingly rich yeasty+sugary+intriguingly-spicy flavour common to Belgian dark ale. With an assertive alcoholic mouthfeel sitting firmly underneath, the refreshingly wheatish flavour adds to the otherwise profoundly rich and sugary palate a pleasantly tart-fruity kick to reach a nice balance in terms of both texture and flavour. Quite warmish alcoholic touch at first proves a bit too powerful for my taste, but expectable and thankfully short-lived. M&D: the mouthfeel is a bit sharp upfront, turning more and more creamy and rounded towards the end as the alcoholic texture turns softer in strength and thinner/cleaner on the palate/between the teeth. A remarkable beer it is, much much more flavoursome than its cousin Schneider Weisse Original. I'd go for single bottle each time, as it's very powerful and hard to digest if consumed too much.

It's probably a coincidence but this fine beer gives a pleasant alco-kick. More likely, the name is taken from the Roman hillock Mons Aventinus. It was orginally a workers residential area but was quickly gentrified and filled with villas, baths, and temples (the most famous being the one devoted to Diana, the godess of nature).In the middle ages the hill was apppropriated by monastic establishments, and they are still there.

Taste is heavy-duty on bananas, with that strong wheat character and spiciness. I also detect some raisins, prunes and a very light finish with mild toasting. I can't even hint at the alchohol, very well hidden. I can detect a very similar character in Hoegaarden, another wheat beer, of course.

I would say this is cut down the middle all the goodness from a wheat beer and all the malty sweetness from a great doppelbock. Poured a dark brown almost soda looking. Very gassy like most German wheat beers. Very malty slightly sweet. tasting. Finish comes off cool and refreshing but with a little more heaviness that I found not too overpowering for the summer.

72,224,swid,4.17,"Aventinus pours a slightly hazy, dark brown color into my pint glass...this beer looks incredibly soda-like, right down to the fizzy light brown head. Unfortunately, the head is only about 1/2"" and dies down nearly instantly. Moderate carbonation, no lacing. This is one malty beer, and the smell confirms that fact. The smell is bready, caramely, fruity (like raisins in particular), and slightly sweet from the alcohol. Not surpringly, the hops aroma is nonexistant in this beer.  The initial taste is quite sweet and malty, which is reinforced almost immediately by the alcohol (at a perfectly complimentory level). Other flavors present are raisin, caramel, a bit of chocolate, and a tiny amount of spiciness from the hops. The flavor balance in a beer of this ABV is outstanding, hiding the alcohol present nearly too well; it's delightfully understated. However, the mouthfeel is where Aventinus really shines. It's full without being syrupy, slightly slick, incredibly smooth, and goes down with a very pleasant sweet yet mildly spicy aftertaste.  This is an insanely easy-drinking beer (esp. considering its ABV). I've never had a weizenbock before, and I'm kicking myself for waiting this long to try one.

There was a head of loose bubbles that retained throughout the pour, but fell to a smaller one sustained by the bubbles rising.  Aroma: Oh there are lots of aromas to be found in this beer! Plum is by far the most noticeable. The aroma is definitely grainy and has some definite alcoholic presence to it. It is wonderfully complex with clove and a host of other things.  Taste: The taste is super rich. There are the dark fruits like plums and raisins that are here in abundance, but I also get some rich alcohol notes like sherry. The mouthfeel is almost fizzy, so it leaves you with the impression that it is a lighter beer than it is. There is a noticeable alcoholic burn after the flavor starts to fade.  Opinion: This beer is world class, and I don't know how anybody could possibly dispute that fact. I rarely drink wheat beers in general unless they have a ton of funk from the Senne Valley. This is the only other wheat beer that I will drink on a regular basis because of the simple fact that it is incredibly tasty. The fact that it was brewed according to the Reinheitsgebote makes it even more amazing because they were able to get all of these flavors with only four ingredients. Awesome!",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,FenwaySquid,4.42,"Presentation: 1 pt. 9 oz. bottle, no freshness or BBD, poured into an Aventinus weizenbock glass.  Appearance: Deep brown hue, somewhat transparent in the slim bottom of the glass. The beer there resembled coca-cola in color. the head poured about 1 inch and faded quickly into a lace.  Aroma: Very sweet and malty.  Taste: The beer is actually midly smoth up front, with the malt flavor boldly entering the mix about midway with a hint of chocolate, and holding through to the finish.  Mouthfeel: Rather thick and syrupy. The carbonation is higher than average as well.  Overall: A good beer to try once, but it's a little sweet for my taste.",Schneider Weisse G.

Nose is invariably sweet smelling, quite malty. Taste is very smiliar, heavy on the malt, some light sherry notes, a bit woody and estery. Very nicely balanced somehow though, quite a masterpiece.  I'll be sure to return to this one again.  Slàinte!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Heady aroma  Taste, crisp smooth malt, slight alcoholic fruit, dried fruit, slight nutty, some big ballsy alcohol on the finish, slight hint of wheat.

From the middle of the glass on up, small, tightly packed bubbles rapidly flow towards the surface.  The beer is dominated by a fresh wheat aroma, with malty roasted tones added.  Overall the taste is very smooth and malty. There is a strong hint of chocolate mixed with just a smidge of spice in the aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is full, with a highly dense texture. At the same time, however, it is amazingly refreshing on the back of the tongue.  For me it is hard to believe that this beer has an eight percent ABV, as it is so easy to sip and enjoy without tasting any alcohol. This is an absolute killer doppelback, and a steal at $3 a bottle!!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Smells of caramel, grain, and a hint of ripe/overripe fruit. Light clove. Taste is similar to the smell. Medium to heavy body that feels velvety to the mouth and tongue. Powerfully rich and deep.

The flavors that are present (nuttyness, roasted malts, cloves) are overrun and overpowered by the incredibly malty sweetness. Too much for me, it's killing me. The mouthfeel is chewy and thick.  Drinkability and Overall: It's an ok brew just not quite my cup of tea. Too sweet, too overpowering, no balance, and definitly no focus.

The flavors of Schneider's Original Weisse are all here: whole wheat, banana bread, lots of yeast.. except they are all magnified threefold. Plenty of the caramelly doppelbock character, and a very smooth mouthfeel. A bit of alcoholic zing is there, but nothing suggesting the 8% abv. Of course, you'll notice the 8% by the time you're finished with the bottle, but what the hey. Aventinus is a world-class, luxurious beer from one of my absolute favorite breweries.

Wonderful brown with the best head you can imagine, the kind that makes it so you only have to hold the bottle straight for a few seconds while pouring. Nothing synthetic here. Just yeast trained to dance.  Smells of a great wheat beer. All spice, clove, white pepper, banana, apricot. All of them all over the place. Zip zap rap.  Tastes like it smells only with a zip of dobblebock chocolate running throughout. Wow! This is great.  Truly a beer that lives up to its hype.

72,224,mobyfann,4.7,"Paid .85EUR + .08EUR glass deposit for a 500mL bottle.  *Reviewed on 10.07.2005  The beer pours a hazy choclate colored base, huge white head, great rentention and some lacing effects from top to bottom. The smell is screams of sweet malt flavor, not too heavy.  The taste isn't overly complex but this is what I look for in a beer. Smooth flavor, tasty malt, and a remarkable aftertaste, maybe the best of any beer out there. The mouthfeel is as if it were a café crème coffee, the retention of the beer gives the beer a refreshing start to every savory taste. The drinkability is by default a 5, given the exceptional taste, the beer never shows any sign of alcohol, and is ever so smooth on the delivery.  Final Thought: Wow, I had this on-tap at the Weisse Brauhaus in Munich and didn't realize how good it was in bottle form, a world class beer from a favored brewery in the world capital of bocks and weizens!",Schneider Weisse G.

There is a huge 2"" billowy tan head with outstanding retention. Some lacing left on glass. Visually stunning.  The nose contains a beautiful yeasty smell and much spice, clove, licorice and even a little rye bread in there. It doesn't get much better than this!  Chocolate is the first thing to set off my tastebuds, followed by spice and clove. There is a slight earthiness apparent with just a hint of dark fruit (plum/raisin?). A little wheat sourness shows its head before some banana and spicy yeast tones take back over. Everything in here has a perfect and subtle balance.  Smooth, dense and satisfying.  This is a world class beer in my opinion. Very close to flawless!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BuckSpin,4.38,"Got to sample this at a local beer taste. A deep, dark, murky rusted bronze hue with a nice, tight 1/2"" head of cream hued foam. Nose was earthy, malted, yet lightly sweet.  Wow, what a surprise this is! I was not expecting this! With most of the ""bock"" style beers I have tried I was expecting a nice, deep, rich malted taste. Don't get me wrong - that deep, rich malted base is there, along with a little smoke, maybe some earth, but my tongue is alive with the sharp, crisp, strong clove taste that floats above it. Along with some mild pepper essences, the clove just sings and brings a vitality, an energy, a cider-like explosion. This is very enjoyable, one of the biggest surprises I have experienced in a while. The two opposites dance and eventually join on the pallete, then a nice, crisp finish. I immediately picked up one to enjoy at home.  What a great experience. I cannot recommend this highly enough to those who enjoy a change of pace, a taste experience, or are looking for a summer bock-style ale. Definitely try this if you can.",Schneider Weisse G.

The aroma was strong melding of ripe fruits and dark caramel with a strong wheat presence. The ripe fruits were bananas of course with a slight clove spice for good measure. Some slight alcohol was present in the aroma and increased as the beer warmed.  The flavor was nicely accomplished with more strong ripe fruit presence, bananas, and a nice caramel presence melded with wheat and malt for a pleasant combination of flavors. The wheat flavors and alcohol presence led to a crisp flavor characteristic.  The finish was even with lasting bananas, slight clove spice and wheat. The body was rounded and medium full with wheat and carbonation giving excellent palate sensations.  500 ml bottle. Date coding is too many numbers to figure out. Dunno how I missed rating this one.

Richly toasted malts, spicy yeast aromas, bananas, cloves. Mild solvent alcohol aromas. Dark bread crust. This beer ranks right up there with the finest that Belgium has to offer.  T: Taste is right up there with Trappist ales. Big malt flavors, strong hints of grapes and plums. There's a bit of an alcoholic spicy flavor. Chewy, sticky bread. Hop bitterness is very low and seems there only to keep the maltiness from becoming cloying. Citrusy and yeasty. Just an absolute joy to taste. Flavors are dancing a slow neverending waltz.  M: Full body. Alcohol is a hot bolus playing swirly in my system, but it's not a sharp, drying alcohol feel, but a golden smooth warming. Carbonation is just a wee bit too high.

Also fruity and sweet...one of the best tasting beers I have experienced. Slightly spiced as it finishes with clove.  Mouthfeel: medium body. Maybe a little fuller.

72,224,Shaw,4.48,"This beer looks perfect. In fact, it's the first beer of 220 I've reviewed that I've given a 5 to. It is a wonderful dark mahogany color with a large amount of carbonation and a huge, meringue-like head. The head was so substantial that it took me several minutes to totally pour it into my hefe glass. My nephew who lived in Germany says this minutes-long pouring process is normal, though. I was about to subtract a .5 point because this beer was clear. But once I swirled the last few ounces in the bottle and poured them in my glass, the beer got nice and cloudy.  The smell is very good and combines the styles nicely. There is the expected clove smell of a Weizen and it's mixed with the malty and fruity notes of a bock.  The taste is also very good. It is spicy and wheaty (is that a word?) but also a bit sweet. The taste leans more heavily to the wheat side that the bock. For an 8 percent ABV beer, this hides its alcohol well. (But I am feeling it after about 250 mL.)  The body is good and smooth. It rolls right over my palate. It's light, like a wheat beer should be.  Overall this is a hell of a beer. It's probably going into my top 10 (No. 3 at the moment!) based on my score. I very highly recommend it, especially for Weizen fans and super-especially for fans of dunkles bier.",Schneider Weisse G.

From the information hanging off the bottle: ""Therefore, in 1999, the Schneider brewery decided to age 240 cases of Aventinus each year in their historical ice cellar in Kelheim with each batch held for a minimum of 3 years."" The result is quite yummy. Pours light brown in color with a haze. Smell is of bananas and yeast. Taste is heavenly. Bananas, lemon juice, minimal cloves. I wish I had a new one to compare against. Perhaps this is worth another trip back to the store! $5.49 for 500ml bottle. If you see it, it is worth it. Label says hints of softer chocolate, clay, and sherry when aged.

Taste: Malty, very wheaty, lots of spices, and at the end, it had some fruit taste in it. Mouthfeel: Light, crisp, medium bodied with a nice wheat aftertaste.

This is almost a meal in a bottle so it's not so highly drinkable in my mind but it's tasty enough to make you try to drink more than maybe you probably should.

As the beer sits in the glass it is a dark brown, holding it to the light reveals it to be dark reddish brown, a little murky, but carbonation is noticeable. Big tan head, at least 3-inches. I am somewhat disappointed that after a sip or two the head disappeared to form a tight ring around the glass with no lacing, that keeps this from a 5.  Smell: Malty, with burnt wheat field scent. Aromas of chocolate, toffee, banana, and plums or figs (kinda like a fig Newton bar, am I nuts?).  Taste: Malt with a nice wheat profile, a little sweet. Not as bready or citrusy as a straight wheat, but this is definitely not a ""normal"" wheat. Flavor of chocolate (not overbearing), banana, and...something else. A bit of alcohol as it warms near the end. Definitely tasty, there seems to be a lot here.  Mouthfeel: Carbonated, medium to full bodied, filling. A little alcohol burn in the throat on the finish and it warmed my stomach.  Drinkability: A good beer, but it did not leave me wanting another.

Nice complex, though well-structured brew!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Chadbrew,4.53,"Appearance: Deep caramel color that is a bit cloudy (which I prefer). It has a nice big dirty head and pretty good lacing as I drink it down.  Smell: Sweet and fruity, definitely loaded with wheat.  Taste: Starts out fruity and full of malt, thankfully there isn't an overbearing roasted malt flavor which I sort of expected; it is actually very smooth and complex. There seems to me to be some of the things I like in Belgians in here like fig and light vanilla flavor.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Decent body and fairly clean finish has me giving this an above average drinkability despite the ABV.

This was poured into a tall hefe glass and exhibited a nice cloudy caramel color at the bottom of the glass and a rich brown at the top. Initial head was nearly white and a about two fingers tall, this settled out to a thin layer of bubbles on top.  Very nice smell, much like a hefe with its banana and clove aromas along with some other hints of dark fruits. This one is slightly different as there is more of an esther aroma and which is well balanced by a bit of wheat and malt.  This one presents itself with clove and bready malts with a typical wheat beer finish. I love this beer because of its simplicity but robust flavors. There is definately some alcohol nuances in the taste and my stomach.  Mouthfeel is full and coats the mouth well. Not much else to say here. Drinkability is only brought down by the alcohol level. I usually get this in the 500mL at the bar and won't have another as I'm usually quite topped off by the fullness of this one.  Overall, a must have.

The initial pour leaves 6 inches of head to 3 inches of beer, but looks very nice the other way around. It takes several minutes to fit the whole bottle into the glass. Before the yeast it is brown with a reddish tint and after it is close to maroon and opaque. Lots of phenols. Bananas, cloves, pepper, lemons, chocolate, alcohol, yeast, and sweet sugary notes in the aroma. It has a medium body, a carbonation that is a bit sharp at the beginning, and leaves a warming sensation. Flavors include bananas, cloves, pepper, grass, caramel, bubblegum, chocolate, raisins, plums?, a sugary sweetness, alcohol, and yeast.

Big tan head that was impressively packed made me excited for my first sip.  Smells pretty wheaty, with some overtones of clove, chocolate, alcohol, banana, and even a bit of fresh pear.  Taste is a little bump in the road for me. It has an interesting mix of chocolate, caramel, and some clove and banana flavors I'd kind of expect from the style. My only problem, and I know it's supposed to be strong, is that I feel the alcohol is a bit over-the-top in the flavor. There's a pleasant clove element to the finish, but it's almost completely overpowered by the alcohol. It seemed a little more assertive than the 8% would warrant. Raisiny notes are there and fairly enticing, though.  Overall, I knid of went back and forth on this beer. It looked and smelled great, but then I hated the taste.

Looked like a coca-cola with a perfectly formed and long lasting white colored head.  Smelled like clove and wheat malt. Very sweet, perfectly spiced, and quite inviting. I could bury my nose in this all night, but eventually I'd end up drinking it all. Tastes like clove as well. The estery banana and bubblegum flavors are perfect. Great light berry flavors. The yeast profile is excellent  The mouthfeel is perfect. Medium to light bodied and well carbonated without being harsh.

Was wrapped in commemorative paper bag labeled with events from 1999 and with a descriptive hangtag.  View: Pulled off the purple hangtag and ripped open the paper packaging. Had 1999 stamped on the back label and new and interesting graphics on the front. Poured a cloudy, rustic brown with loads of initial carbonation both in the brew and in the tan head. The head quickly diminished to a very tiny ring. I didnt take points off for that, since this is an aged product with a relatively high ABV.  Smell: Caramel and dark fruits, not much hops to speak of, with some faint clove spices  Taste: Wheat bread, sweet candy, ripened and dried fruits, and molasses chocolate malts; slight alcohol taste and warmth; a little bit of spices thrown in there too. This is a delicious beer  Mouthfeel: Velvety silky smooth, with some lingering sweetness and buttery texture, like a well-done cordial. Initially very tingly with just the right amount of carbonation  Drinkability: The special 1999 aged Aventinus was a dangerously good beer, reminding me of chunky German wheat bread smothered in fresh spiced honey, one that I would drink again, assuming that I could find it  We sampled this prior to the last sports and social club game of the season for volleyball.

This brew presented before me in its deep and dark hur with a light head, but one that left a little lacing as I continued on my journey through this brew. The age certainly changed some of the normal alcohol esthers that are in the nose of this brew, but in a very estute way. Both the aroma and flavor were distinct with many, rather complex layers of malty goodness, some spiciness, chocolate covered cherries [perhaps] and raisins or currants [perhaps]. A fantastic brew, and a special one at that... It is hard to make this brew much better, but this has obviously been achieved...  Prosit!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Vipsanius,3.68,"I tried aging this beer for about 8 months but it didn't turn out so well, so the one I'm reviewing is fresh from a grocery store in TX. Although, it doesn't have a freshness date on it so I can't tell exactly how fresh. Poured a little bit cloudy amber color with a inch and a half head, which quickly dissipated and left absolutely no lacing.  The smell is very sweet with some malt and fig characteristics. The taste is for a split second malty and chocolately at first. Honestly, I probably wouldn't have even picked up on the chocolate if it wasn't listed on the bottle. That quickly gives way to a sweet and very fruity taste...cherries, figs, grapes, and other fruits. The finish has a lemony and grapefruit-like mild sour taste to it coupled with some vague herbs that linger a long time afterwards.  Kind of tastes like fruit juice but definitely has the weight and body of fruit juice plus carbonation. Overall, I think my expectations were a little too high for this beer but it's definitely one I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,granger10,4.13,"I had this in a vertical with a fresh Aventinus and a '99 Aventinus. The fresh one was very clovey and bananany(?) with a nice wheat base and semi-sweet malt flavor. The '99 was much more dark chocolatey and vicious in mouthfeel with a heartier flavor, almost port like. The '01 was inbetween. It still had that spicey hefe flavor but not as intense and it had more port, chocolate notes than the fresh one. Kind of inbetween and a little muddled. I think aged Aventinus is prime after 6 years! This was still an awesome beer but not quite as good as either the fresh one or the '99. Fun experiment though!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Pegasus,4.34,"Appearance: Deep mahogany brown in color with a large tan head which, after a couple of minutes, fades away completely. The lacing is quite minimal. There is a considerable amount of sediment present at the bottom of the bottle, most of which I swirled into the beer.  Aroma: Quite vinous character, by aroma alone, I might have taken this to be a wine. There are notes of dark fruit, spices, chocolate, and alcohol, but little of the banana character, which others have noted. Still, quite complex.  Taste: Distinctly spicy at the opening, clove notes are quite pronounced, with underlying fruit flavors, notably apple peel. A sweet and very warming alcohol note appears soon after. Following on is a brown sugar sweetness, and hints of banana, although quite restrained Towards the finish a spicy bitterness appears, unlike typical hop bitterness. Mild bitter chocolate notes appear at the finish. There is a lingering but quite mild bitterness that carries on well past the end of the taste.  Mouth feel: Smooth and rich, almost syrupy in character.  Drinkability/notes: A superb beer for cold weather. Would serve well paired with a chocolate dessert, or as dessert. An absolutely stunning beer.  Presentation: Packaged in a 16.9 ounce brown glass bottle with a pop top crown. Served in a standard pint tap glass.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,hefevice,4.42,"From bottle. Oh my! Loved this right from the first sniff. Pours translucent goldy brown with big foamy light tan head and plenty of fine effervescence. Big estery aroma with sweet caramel, banana and clove tones. Aroma is true to the taste, and it is so smooth that the reasonably high alcohol is barely noticeable. YUM!! Bummer..now I have to go back and down-rate my old favourite (Weinstephan Hefeweissbeir).",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,mgdeth,3.83,"Appearance - Huge off-white head dissipates - no, make that disappears completely - quickly. Deep, deep copper or brown in color. Downright shitty head retention and no beer lace.  Smell - Rich, sweet malty aroma. It almost has a musty smell hidden in it. I also detect a fruity smell. There is some alcohol in the nose.  Taste - Chocolatey malty sweetness is the focus of the flavor. Alcoholic warmth is present. I also taste something like figs or raisins. This beer conjures up thoughts of Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner. I am also reminded of dried fruit when I drink it.  Mouthfeel - Highly carbonated. I get mixed results for the body - it feels thick and thin at the same time. Maybe this is due to the utter lack of head on the beer.  Drinkability - This is a very tasty brew. I can see drinking a few of these in a sitting. The relatively high carbonation makes the beer feel sort of gritty.  Comments - Despite the appearance, this is a very good beer. It is sort of odd as well, because it has some characteristics commonly found in ales (fruitiness, gritiness). Overall, I'd say this is a complex beer. Despite my score, I'd recommend it to almost anyone.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Nice strong scents, banana and cloves, wonderfully spicey! Sasafrass, fresh ginger even maybe? Good amount of carbonation, you can really feel it as it foams up a bit and expands in your mouth. Interesting flavors, not too strong, yet in no way is it mild.... Nice and malty, just slightly dark. There is a hit of sasafrass and a lot of nice clove in the finish, even a bit of a clove tingle on the tongue -I like that and have always loved the taste of clove. Goes down nicely, with a lot to think about and enjoy in this one. Not too heavy, but may be best as a sipper or with a good cheese plate.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Shultzerdugen,3.5,"Served in a hefe glass, poured a yellowish dark brown with a large tan head. I like the yeast in a hefe, and it did its thing with the bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass.  The smell was classic hefe weizen: banana nut bread, with a touch of clove.  The taste also reminded me of a classic hefe weizen with a nice nuttiness from the yeast, apples and bananas, plus alcohol showing off. None of the caramelized malt character I was expecting from a bock beer, though. It became too sweet by the end, I really wanted some hops to come in and rescue my taste buds.  I'm glad I tried this, but I doubt I'll have it again. One never knows, do one? Just the thought of the sweetness makes me cringe.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,karst,4.1,Pours dark amber with a tall head that falls quickly in a half filled Pils glass. Aroma dominated by bananas and clove.  Taste is very vinous (wine like) especially as it finishes with hops.  This was preceded by a barleywine and an Imperial Stout - not the ideal line up.  Debating on getting this again. But without a doubt the Eisbock will be a repeat.,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,foamer,4.57,"Pours a cloudy brown with orange highlights. Frothy cream-coloured head with good retention. Strong banana aroma in the nose, with a little hint of clove. Wheat malt tang with some almost bubble gum-like sweetness followed by lots of banana esters and some cloves. Very very slight alcohol warmth in the lingering aftertaste, but very minimal. Nice heavy and smooth mouthfeel. Quite a tasty beer and exceedingly drinkable. I could drink these all night. I think this might have been the first 5 I gave out.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,kegerator,5,"Outstanding beer. Pours a deep brown with hints of amber and a nice 2 inch head that dissipates slowly and leaves nice lacing. Smell was Plum, and Dried Fruits with hints of Clove spices and a sweet malt and alcohol aroma in the background. Taste was amazingly smooth with hits of caramel malts and alcohol and finishes with a nice hit of the dried fruit and spice. Medium/full body and exceptionally smooth. Very enjoyable brew.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,plaztikjezuz,4.05,"pours a hazy burnt sienia with a healthy head that disapeated into a lacy rim. smell is fruity, banana, sweet. the flavor is malt, banana, clove, alcohol, unidentified spice. the mouthfeel is very full this would be a great beer on a chilly night sitting in front of fire.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,redmosquito,4.07,"This beer pours a cloudy caramel amber color with a lasting, lacing white head. The aroma is a unique blend of spicey lager yeast, fruity ale yeast, and estery hefe yeast. Behind all that is a thick sweet raisin/caramel malt aroma that lingers. The malt sweetness dominates the flavor, drifting between raisin caramel malt and sweet wheat malt before giving way to a yeast finish. The beer is viscuous on the tongue and finishes warmly. This beer definitely takes the winter chill away, and likely the winter blues, as well.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,kosmoraios,4.28,"Murky brown with a 1/2 inch white head that rises for a bit and lingers throughout the experience. Nose is of spices and a tinge of fruit. I believe I detect a trace of nutmeg and cinnamon in the nose. Roasted malts give it a deep flavor reminiscent of toffee and light chocolate. Taste is fruity at first, with red apple, plum, and bananna being prevalent. Spices are more evident near the middle of the glass, again with the nutmeg and cinnamon - just a smidgen, mind you. Cloves also. Not enough to overpower - just perfect. There is a caramel/toffee sweetness to this ale. A perfect balance of strength and wheat. Mouthfeel is spicy and carbonated. A perfectly drinkable ale, especially on a cold, rainy winter's day.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Dessert pastry like aromas of candy malts, brown sugar, cinnamon presence and raisin buttered toast.  First Swigs: Sweet caramel candy. Malty front, but detectable hops background. Honey and spices of cinnamon and nutmeg. Banana fig fruitiness, complex flavors. Awl-kee-hawl detection towards the warmer side of this big bottle battle.  Frothy feel becomes a bit overwhelming. An excellent winter warmer.  Last Swigs: Nearly a Belgian dubbel, yet listed here as a weizenbock. This needs to come down from the foamy palate. Just compared to Ramstein Winter Wheat.

Cloudy russet orange in appearance with gobs of foamy off-white head the dissipates to around 1/2 inch - but stays 'til the end.  Big time scent of clove, vanilla, rum & dark/tropical fruits. The nose of this ale erupts all up in your face!  There it is...clove, bananna, molasses, bubble gum, figs, black pepper & burnt woody flavors. FRESH, FRESH, FRESH flavors.  Mouthfeel is awesome; medium body with a good deal of fine carbonation to keep things peppy. For such a lush, warming ale, it has a nice semi-dry finish (just enough to keep you wanting another gulp).  Drinkability is great, despite it's 8% abv. It's so silky-smooth and unintrusive - everything you could ask for.  Alright...it doesn't get much better than this folks. The perfect marriage of wheat ale & dopplebock - shear perfection. I would love to try this with some bread pudding!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,dgallina,3.48,"Served a pale and murky light brown with a large creamy tan head that persisted through the half-liter. Smells of overpowering sweet and fruity malts, particularly banana.

Lacking in depth and disappointing overall.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,swamiswamu,3.33,"This was a disapointment. It pours reddish orange with a eggshell head. Some lacing. The malts were just too cloying. This offset a little bit by cloves, but not enough.

It reads 04.233 0503.  Pours a marvelous shade of brown...ranging from darker chestnut colors to light brown. There is a tannish colored head on top that turns into a thin lace.  Very nice aroma...sweet fruits, ripe bananas, spices and cloves. A very inviting nose.  Spicy and carbonated with a clovey, bananas dipped in caramel attack on the palate. Fruity esters with a slight chocolate backdrop. Wheat and grains add a dryness to the finish. One of the most thirst quenching 8.0% ABV beers I've ever had. This could be dangerous.  An awesome beer, no question about it. I wish I had more in my fridge. Weizenbocks are quickly becoming one of my favorite styles of beers. It's clear that the Schneider Aventinus is one of the best out there. Highly recommended.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Lots of clove in upfront upon tasting. Hits a quick note of bubble gum, then finishes very dry. The transition from sweet to almost bitter is nicely balanced. Excellent mouthfeel that coats the tongue. Just the right amount of carbonation that works in harmony with the flavors.  An exceptionally drinkable beer.

There is a cornucopia of smells to savor. Very fruity. I sense raisin, prune, and various citrus ingredients. Very spicy. This brew has a very complex scent. Quite pleasing.  The initial taste is predominately spicy, cloves dominate. The mixture of the ingredients seems to be well balanced. I am usually not a fan of the more fruit-spice infused brews, but this is pretty drinkable by my standards. Each drink provides another flavor to experience. Quite interesting.  Mouthfeel is a slight alcohol tinge, with a lingering spice note. Not too bad. This is definitely worth a try, although I wouldn't consider this a staple in my session lineup.  All in all a drinkable dopplebock, but it is just not my style. This is a well crafted brew so I have to give it props.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Smell: A yeasty wheat bread-like smell dominates the senses. If I would pick a classic ""beer"" smell, this would be it.  Taste: Spicey and clove like up front which fades into a strong wheat base. Finishes with a sweet carmel-like note. This just tastes like it was hand crafted and made with care. This is high quality stuff.  Mouthfeel: Medium and prickly. The carbonation definitely hits the palate just right.  Drinkability: Very nice. This is one to sit back and savor.  Notes: This isn't my favorite style but this is such a well done beer.

The flavor is incredibly complex... I'm tasting cherries, raisins, bananas, cloves, vanilla, even a little of a woody root (like unsweetened root beer). There's definitely yeast present in the flavor, but not so much that it bothers me. Every sip makes me notice new things... I'm even getting a taste of milk chocolate here halfway through my pint. Nice carbonation for the style... the typical refreshing wheat beer bubbles like a hefeweizen, but provides an interesting contrast to the more robust and flavorful double bock.  Definitely not a session beer, but a pint or two will be very drinkable and enjoyable... all said, a very unique beer, and well worth trying.",Schneider Weisse G.

Some yeast and a brief medium dry finish where alcohol makes a brief appearance  Medium bodied - though heavy for a wheat beer with lots of effervesence that tickles the tongue. Slightly oily in that the beer lingers in the the mouth and on the tongue.  This is a wonderful beer for a cold winters night. Though the Aventinus Eisbock which will follow is a rare and fine tipple as well.  I really like this beer and even bought the funky glass that it is served in so I could be as authentic as possible.

72,224,bultrey,4.01,"A very interesting beer. Picked up for $3.50 at a little market in Brooklyn. This comes wrapped in tissue paper, on which is printed a variety of pop culture events from 1999. Tear off the paper and it's that familial purple label that Aventinus sports. I poured this into a large flute-like beer glass. The appearance of this beer is remarkable. It pours a very deep, dark, ruby brown, and it seems as if it should be thick, but is in fact thin enough to foster a very strange, soda-like carbonation, or perhaps champagne-like is more accurate. A very persistent moussy head with fast moving bubbles racing up the side of the glass. The smell reminded me of cocoa powder, mostly, with a little banana and clove. It was not an overwhelming aroma. This beer also tastes like cocoa powder, but there is also a melange of fruit and spicy flavors, including clove, banana, earth (truffles?), fig, and maybe even some red fruit, like chocolate covered blueberries or raspberries. Strangely enough, it was a good flavor, but for some reason I expected more power. The mouthfeel is remarkably creamy for being such a realtively thin, non-filling beer. The drinkability suffers, because the alcohol in this puppy sneaks up on you really quickly. Still, these beers make as good a case as any for aging, and I'm going to buy some more and age it for even a couple more years...",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" eggshell head above the dark brownish-amber brew. Head is relatively resilient, and lacing is minimal, both of which are acceptable to me with an aged product. Aroma is of caramel malts, with light tinges of dark fruits and hops character. Taste is initially of biscuity malt, fading into the minimal fruit and hops notes as hinted in the nose. No hint of relatively high alcohol content here.

There is just the slightest hint of hop bouquet.  The flavor is sweet and malty, again with faint hints of raisins, prunes, and licorice.

It's much more estery and aromatic than any other German bock I've ever encountered, It sort of reminds me of a cross between a German doppel bock and a Belgian strong dark ale.

Scent is of sweet light roasted malts, rasins, bananas and spices.  Taste is quite nice with sweet malts, dark fruits, bananas, clove and finishes dry but sweet with just a hint of hops.  Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, and even though there seems to be a lot of carbination (maybe too much) in this bottle it leaves me with a creamy feel.  Drinkability is superb. This beer is smooth and almost refreshing (maybe due to the carbination). I would definately be able to drink many more of these.  This is the best weizenbock I have had. 2001 is very much worth the price, almost $7 for 500ml bottle. I am planning on buying another.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,deejaydan,4.6,"Got this in BIF 10. It is wonderful. Beautiful garnet/deep red color. Pours with a huge head, but it doesn't stick around. I wouldn't expect it to, given the ABV. Smells vinous. Raisiny, black curranty... You can taste the alchol in this, but it's not out in front screaming. It's there, but as a supporting cast. Tastes kinda like a barleywine soaked raisin. A very, very nice, well done beer. It's surpisingly light on the tounge.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Fish113d,4.32,"Upon listening to my buddy Sulldaddy tell me over and over again that this is his favorite brew, I finally broke down and bought a bottle.  Pouring it into my goblet, it poured a dark brown w/ hints of reds in there as well. It left a very fizzy head that quickly jumped over the rim of my glass, but just as quickly fizzled to absolute nothingness in my glass. Smelling it, I first got a sense of soy sauce from a foot or so away, but when really getting my nose into it, I got lots of brown malty tones, not as much as I would hope from a Weizen, but nice overall. I also got the smell of some nuts, fruit (raisins maybe) or some rasberries w/ chocolate.  Tasting it, I first thought it was very malty and deep in flavor w/ plums and citrus flavors. However, as I took a few more sips I felt it tasted more like bitter rasberry chocolate. As I swallowed it, I got the slight taste of a clove cigarette that spiced it up a bit (nice touch).  Pretty light in body, it drank rather easily and the taste helped that happen. It was a nice crisp beer even at room temp, with nice carbonation that tickled my tongue. It also left a nice aftertaste as I said before.  Drinkable??? As Stone Cold once said...""OH, HELL YEAH!!!!""",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BrewMaster,4,"Pours with an orange reddish color and a light head around the rim of the glass. The aroma is malty sweet with some fruity notes. The flavor is brimming with malt character but not in an over-done way. Pale malt seems to dominate the delicate flavor along with light flavors of apple, grapefruit, and crisp grass. There is also a slight wood flavor in the beer. Very clean beer with a smooth carressing of the palate.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,merlin48,4.89,"One of my favorites, often enjoyed, never reviewed. Pours a hazy, chestnut brown body with a sturdy one finger head that is old ivory in color. Nice retention and average patchy lace result from the pour. Aroma is heavenly. Clove spiked rum rasin bread is the best description. Raisins, allspice, overripe bananas, wheat grain, a hint of alcohol, and an array of other spices entice the nose. Beautiful! Mouthfeel has spritzy carbonation and an ideal medium body that, somehow, manages to possess a creamy component. Taste is divinely complex. Chocolate notes are complimented by spicy clove and allspice, and an abundance of fruity flavors are led by banana, plum, fig, and dates. Earthy yeast adds yet another dimension, as the carbonation allows the complexities to mingle into an orgy of Weizenbock delight. This is probably my favorite beer, one that I rely on as a solid, full bodied, supremely crafted, always enjoyable, brew. Very highly recommended to all.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,mntlover,4.33,"Murky brown looking brew with a big tannish head full of big and little bubbles collapsing on themselves as they fall to tiny ring of bubbles. Its cool you can hear them bursting on there way down fizzy sounding, but not fizzy tasting. Aroma of ripe fruits dipped in caramel and molasess dominate with smells of light spice and toasted malt also but in backgroud. Taste is sweet fruit to start aided by some caronation. Then the toasted malt makes a brief apperance followed by light bitterness and spiceness that begins after your swallow is resting safely in your tummy. Mouthfeel is right side of medium its chewy and full tasting, but not a heavy beer goes down easy and smooth finished before done typing. Drinkability is good goes down easy bottle say 8% that doesn't seem possible no alcohol in taste at all. My first Weizenbock on reccomendation from merlin48 this is a good beer must try more.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,GClarkage,4.87,"Consumed in October 2004 at the Toronado on tap. Let me start by saying that I have had this beer many a time, but am just getting around to rating it. This is, without a doubt, my favorite current beer. It pours with a huge head and leaves a nice lace while drinking it in my awesome Aventinus glass. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 on appearance is that I compare everything against beers like Westy or Rochefort or the like. The bubbles seemed to be a little large and the lacing wasn't top notch as some beers I have had. The scent is heavenly. Smells of so many different things. Cloves, spices, anise, chocolate, bananas, toffee, port like wine. So many different scents to amaze your nose. Taste is just as good. Mostly I taste the cloves, spices and bananas. Perfect carbonation for this style beer which makes it very smooth going down. The high alcohol content is the only reason it doesn't get a 5 on drinkability. Two of these is plenty for me before it ends being as enjoyable. A really good afterdinner drink if you don't wan't something super sweet like a port, barleywine or eisbock. Can't say enough good things about this beer. Even the price is good. About $3.29 at my local bevmo for a 16.9 oz bottle. I always have at least 4-6 or these on hand at all times. If you see it, you must try it. I deplore you people!!! Buy one...no, buy two because you will be wanting another the minute you finish the first.",Schneider Weisse G.

Still, it was nice to celebrate the big 4-3 with family, a few good friends, and G. Schneider and Sohn.  A bottle fermented beauty that pours to a deep, hazy, wheaty brownish color. Cloudy like a hefe, but the color of brown alequite a combination. Smells of raisins, dates, clovesmaybe a bit of chocolate, with a hint of butterscotch. Sweet, but not annoyingly so.  Smooth mouthfeel, nicely carbonated, with an almost dry yet buttery finish.  Decidedly drinkable!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,elricorico,4.62,"Pours out a dark reddish brown with a generous bubbly tan head. The head fizzed away to lacing rather quickly.  Smell is delicious. The fruity sweetness makes me think of baked sweets, and there is a hint of alcohol warmth to the aroma, somewhat reminiscent wine.  The taste does not dissapoint. Rich malty sweetness, a hint of licorice and spice. Its finish is like a lick of candy.  The mouthfeel is perfect. It is medium bodied with a light bit of carbonation. I goes into the mouth smoothly, feels good on the tongue, and is easy to swallow.  This is one of the most drinkable beers I've tasted. The combination of a great taste and perfect mouthfeel make it hard to put your glass down.  One of my favorite beers. I would not hesitate recommending it to anyone.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,yeagerbm,4.5,"Pours an orange brown with nice white head. Smell and flavor is tart fruit- apples, cherries and yeast with a hop bitterness enough for balance and a malty sweetness.

Taste is of cloves and some bananas, with a bit of chocolate. There's almost a burning aftertaste that's rather unpleasent.  Overall, I don't really care for this brew. Not only is it darn expensive ($4 bucks a bottle, almost the same as a Rogue bomber), but it just doesn't do anything for me. I may try it again in a year or so, once my tastebuds have grown.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Clove, roasty wheat, banana and other dark fruit and a little bit acrid or lactic smelling.

Quite possibly the best in the world.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,hero27,3.1,"Dark brown color with a nice head, but nearly no lacing left on the glass as you drink. Aroma of cloves and light malt..tons of spice. This one needs to tone down the cloves a bit. I'm not a lover of the Weissbeer style, so maybe that's why I couldn't get past the fruity, spicy flavor of this beer. I have to give this beer some credit. It was smooth and had a decent mouthfeel to it, with some nice malt flavor. Doesn't quite live up to it's reputation as far as I'm concerned.",Schneider Weisse G.

Has the trademark aroma of a wheat-beer (on steroids), w/ an alcoholic kick ---Mmmm, it tastes as good as it smells, no, better! Tastes like warm raisen-bread. Nice caramely malts.

72,224,tatterdash,4.58,"This is my first Weizenbock, having focused on Belgian brews for some time now, I decided to expand to German ales. Poured an evervescent red-brown with a foamy white head that dissipated slowly. Smell was a wine-like plum and banana. Taste... Hey! It's like that one I used to have at Gordon Biersch! Dark fruits, malts, bit of spice and banana, so chocolate creeping in. Has a surprisely light mouthfeel, which was unusual yet appreciated and the high ABV is so well hidden it is quaffable (although you'll want most of it to land in your mouth so it is not a true quaff). This beer is also very refreshing and drinkable, especially on a hot summer night... I like this a lot.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,barknee,3.07,"Pouring this, I was rewarded with an initial 1.75 inch, hi density off-white foamy head and the color of the beer is a burnt caramel. The carbonation is at the initial pour, almost champagne like in intensity, with bubbles ascending from all sectors of the glasses interior. The nose offers copious quantities of clove and fennel which somewhat dissipates revealing the yeast and a hint of dark chocolate. The initial mouth feel is quite creamy, as a portion of the head exists throughout the tasting. The finish is quite crisp, due to the persistent carbonation. For me, the clove-like underpinnings remind me somewhat of a ""seasonal"" holiday flavored brew, and somewhat detract from the overall drinkability of this beer. The combined expansive nature of the style, and the prominent clove / fennel like flavor deeply embedded in this beer is a bit ""over the top"" as I began to get subtle indications that having gone onto a second bottle might have encouraged my gag reflex into operation. It is the nose of this product that has an enormous weight on how this beer will be generally perceived, evaluated and ultimately enjoyed. The taste is moderately potable, but there is no escaping the outgassing of odoriferous emanations. Although interesting to try, it is doubtful that this beer will find a place in my cellar now or in the future.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,WetCoaster,3.83,"Appearance: A somewhat cloudy brown with golden undertones. Furious carbonation and a tall, loose off-white head with moderate retention. No real lacing.  Smell: Rich malts and a bit of alcohol at first. Clove spice, bubblegum and a general sense of dark fruit, though no specific one comes to mind. Unusual (though perhaps not for the style) and quite pleasing.  Taste: Wacky. Well, it certainly is what it claims to be. It tastes exactly like a blend of weisse and dopplebock. The mouthfeel is medium, but the carbonation is extremely sharp; cola come to mind. The flavor is malty, wheaty, spicy, clove...ish? Finishes sweet, but thin and crisp. Bitterness and clove linger.  Drinkability: The slightly phenol taste and high ABV would make this a tough go as a session. I'm glad I tried it, though.  While I know this is a site favorite, not my glass of beer. I like weisse, I like bock, but together it's a bit much. I've rated it fairly high because it seems to be a very good example of the style, but I find the flavor and texture all over the place, with pairings that don't work for me. Next!  NOTE: This beer is MUCH better on tap, absolutely amazing. If I had the energy to write another review, it would be close to a perfect ""5.""",Schneider Weisse G.

Sour apple, clove, and orange aromas with some additional light chocolate tones.  An apple, orange, pear tartness up front followed by some chocolate and coffee tones. A very dry finish with virtually no bitterness due to the well balanced, intricate flavors. The aftertaste is clove infused and very pleasant.  Medium bodied; a bit much in terms of carbonation but it works well nonetheless with the flavors.  At 8% abv this guy is highly drinkable. It's not a boring beer in terms of flavor, and could keep me entertained as a session beer. Pretty much the accepted standard for the style, it does not disappoint. A must try!",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,Viggo,4.3,"Came in a half liter bottle at 8% ABV. Pours a nice dark red/brown, with lots of head. Has a fruity, malty aroma that I thoroughly enjoyed. The taste is fruity as well, with more maltiness and smooth caramel flavour. A little bit of an alcohol taste but not enough to really hurt it. I really enjoyed this beer, I thought it tasted quite similar to Maudite, so if you like Maudite this one is worth checking out. I was already intoxicated by the time I tried this but my tastebuds never die! Aventinus was after two crappy beers so it tasted leven more excellent.",Schneider Weisse G.

Extremely large light brownish-yellow head with lots of staying power and lacing. First smell gives the impression of a hefe-weizen. Wheaty malt sweetness, yeast, banana, and cloves, but also with chocolate, spicyness, dark fruits and, alcohol. Very malty, yeasty, and wheaty. Strong prickling carbonation. Finishes very crisp, slightly dry, and a fairly strong alcohol taste and mild alcohol bitterness. A very tasty and strong beer, only downfall is the alcohol is easily detectable.",Schneider Weisse G.

Lightly toasted malt. A hint of banana, and cloves. The taste is full, malty, with a lot of caramel. Cloves again. These are the notes, there is nothing to invent. But they are very good, and very well amalgamated. Alcohol not perceptible, though the 8 ABV. Medium body. Sweet malt in the aftertaste, too, but not just this. Even some floral - fruity notes.

The head is initially very dynamic, the bubbles at the top get larger and its size diminish fast, but a greatly tight laced one-incher stay up there for the whole 30 minutes I took to drink it. Cold, the aroma is nothing to shout about. On the other hand, as the beer warms, it develops a nice brown sugar and fruity malt complexity. In mouth, I first notice bananas, pears, grapes, brown sugar, berries as well as spices like cloves and cinnamon with a wheaty/bready aftertaste. Pleasant medium mouthfeel, a little biting, creamy. While weizens are definitely not among my favorites, this one is complex, refreshing and pleasant. Alcohol was not noticeable at all to me. Thank you CapFlu!",Schneider Weisse G.

Slightly oxidized and alcohol notes. Rolled bottle prior to opening, thus mildly cloudy (although still a fair amount of setiment on bottom of bottle). Extremely fizzy head that settles quickly and then disappears. Dark amber brown, that's slightly gold on the edges. Flavor shows stronger presence of malts in the mix than aroma, yet phenols still dominate. Dryness appears mid to finish. Slight sherry like oxidation and alcohol flavors. Richness gives it a heavy feeling. Highly carbonated, lends some fullness and softness. Alcohol feels excessive. I'm really disappointed.

Poured from half litre bottle, a hazy copper hue. with a finger thick head and spotty lacing. There's a prominent clove aroma mixed with a rich maltiness. Huge wheat flavor upfront, which eventually finds a balance between wheat and malted barley flavors. This one is ridiculously drinkable, watch yourself!

Held up to the light, you can see the cloudiness of the beer.  Aroma: Lot of fruity aroma.  Flavor/Body: First taste is acidic and spicy, with fruitiness following quickly (perhaps more apricot than banana). Malt becomes more apparent in the finish, with a lengthy finish, drier than one expects. Lot of body, and warming alcoholic sweetness in the middle.

Nose is deep and flavorful, tons of bubblegum lined with citrus and some alcoholic plum bombs, mildly sweet and very creamy.  Taste is overshadowed by the soft and bubbly carbonation that fills the mouth and hits the back of the throat. Lightly sweet bubblegum taste, alcoholic watermelon, or peach--nah, watermelon. The slightest discomfort from alcohol on the throat, but overall highly drinkable and enjoyable. Big flavor and low sweetness, I could imagine myself drinking lots of this.

Initial taste produces a chocolate sensation along with fruit and spices. After allowing it to sit in the mouth awhile I was reminded again of red wine with just a hint of cherry.

72,224,Mitchster,3.58,"Brewed in 2000, aged by Schneider for 3 years before release. Forms an airy beige head with very poor retention, literally fading to nill in a matter of seconds. Lacing is absent. Color is clear (when decanted, cloudy on the second pour), dark chestnut, with amber accents and medium-strong carbonation. Aroma has predominate notes of mandarin oranges, raisins, a unique funky & floral ""caramel sourness"", vanilla, husken Munich malt, and faint cloves. No bananas. Mouthfeel is ruddy and oxidized, otherwise smooth, with a semi-creamy consistency and buttery texture. Alcohol is not appreciated in mouthfeel, or aroma. Body is medium-dense. Taste begins with butter, caramel, toffee and cloves, followed by mandarin oranges, a brief glimpse of syrupy alcohol, and then a very brief buttery finish. The finish is fleeting and the mouthfeel disappears like water, leaving very little of itself behind.  This brew, while not as exciting to myself as most others, is balanced nicely between the sweetness of the wheat malt and the mellow hops. Comparing it to my memory of the uncellared version, I think this beer has lost it's brightness and life, and certainly it's mouthfeel, head, and lacing have suffered greatly.

Try it we did and everyone --3 of us were extremely impressed. Not only did we find the perfect mingling of a wheat beer and a dark color to it.

It looked as hearty as it tasted.  The flavors were a combination of spicy, rich candy flavors and toasty malt notes. Flavors that are common to a good German hefeweizen are found in addition to a lingering alcohol layer that finishes up with a flavor akin to ""leathery figs"".

Smelled heavy spices (cinnamon, choriander) and a small amount of malt. The taste was very unexpected (I've never had a Weizenbock) and delicious.

The taste lingers and tingles the inside of your mouth well after it's slid down your throat.  This beer definitely promotes the phenomona of your eyes (or liver as it were) being bigger than your stomach.

It is creamy with lemon and banana coming through with the nice wheat sweetness. The banana stays with you after swallowing and sitting for a bit...just great. Very nicely balanced and very good.

If you ever put a dark stout up to the light and saw the bit of red that comes through, then you'd recognize it, because it's very close to that aura of colour. Creamy, two finger head. Though their isn't much lace, the glass was recently washed before I poured this beer. So that may affect the lace. Ripe, juicy dark fruit smell, bit of caramel, sweet malts of wheat and barley, and even a slight cheese smell from the yeast. Bit off, yet still pleasant. Tastes damn good. More ripe fruits, with plums and cherries dominant, sweet malt followthrough all up to the aftertaste, which is similar to a dark bread. Creamy, thick mouthfeel coats your teeth, gums, cheeks, tongue and throat. Nice, very nice. I certainly wouldn't mind drinking this again, and again, and again...

This came out a cloudy darker brown color with red highlights and a good-sized light tan head that rose out of the glass. Fantastic aromas rise out of this beer with dark fruits, bready malt and that yeasty wheat smell being at the forefront. There are also slight notes of smoke and chocolate. The taste starts of with slightly sweet fruits and a good amount of carbonation as well. There was a good malt flavor over the middle before a slight bit of hops and wheat come in at the end.

The smell is campfire smoke, rootbeer, dark fruits, dark bready malts, caramel and toffee. What a great combo! Alcohol is not noticeable and at 8% that is something of an accomplishment.  The flavor mimics the nose with the smoke and rootbeer taking a backseat to the dark fig-like fruits, dark malty bread-like notes. The caramel adds a nice sweetness to this beer that is nicely balanced. What a treat. Alcohol is not detected in the taste.

72,224,TagoMago,4.79,"Presentation: 1 pt. 9 fl oz. bottle poured into weizen glass.  Appearance: Cloudy brown. Head is faint and quicky subsides to almost nothing. No lacing is present.  Smell: Upfront fruitiness: fruity, grape aroma with faint cloves. Musky, yeasty wheat beer aroma is easily noticeable. Slight hints of coffee and chocolate lay in the background.  Taste: Tart grapes with a chocolately, yeasty background. Rich malts predominate upfront with a citrusy, fruity finish. A rather common wheat/weizen beer flavor is easily detected. This beer has a rather vibrant carbonation upfront, yet is exremely smooth in its finish.  Overall : A completely flawless weizenbock. Highly recommended!",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,coasterfreak75,4.26,"The pour was a dark copper/brown with a three finger head that quickly dissapated and left a light white lace on top of the beer. The lace hung around for the entire drink.  The smell was very fruity, apricots and dates, alot like a belgian ale. Hidden in the back of the nose was a hint of malt sweetness and even less hop spice.  The drink started with a sharp fruit kick, heavy in apricot. The middle was alot of carbonation with just a hint of malt. The finish was a very light kick of hops followed by a quick clean bit of wheat flavor.  This is the first wheat beer I've had that I really enjoyed. It was quite drinkable and refreshing. Thanks to Chatter for finding it for me, I'll look for this one again.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,benmiliron,3.74,"Paid $2.99 for ~18 oz bottle.  Aventinus is a pretty heavy brew. Wheaty, chocolatey, fruity, yeasty - very complex. At 8% though, it'll kind of knock you on your butt. Would be nicer in a 12 oz bottle. A great tasting beer though, fun to try and pick out the various tastes. Kind of overwhelming though.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Ardon,5,"Good old Aventinus. Strange beer it is to me. When I first tried it I despised it, but like Orval, I kept coming back to it and now it's at the top of my list. Pours a beautiful mahogany with a big foamy, fizzy head. Smells of chocolate cherrys, and other unidentifiable fruits. Wonderful aromas are coming off of this that I just can't put my finger on. Smooth, smooth, smooth for something of this alcohol content. Instantly refreshing, yet at the same time, rich with flavour. Dark fruits and milk chocolate are all over this. The yeast assaults you with a million unidentifiable fruit flavours. The closest I can come is bananas, red delicious apples and cherries. Finishes with a slight, and I MEAN slight chocolately aftertaste. This is one of God's nectars and if Schneider and Sohn ever decide to stop making it they better start watching their backs! :)",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,cokes,4.84,"Vintage 2000. Looks like clay-infused cola. Darkish brown and opague. Nose is raisiny with notes of vanilla, rum, sherry, and cognac. But not in an alcoholc sense. Loads of cloves, and chocolate covered bananas. Begins with an enveloping caramel sweetness. It makes stops at bananas and chocolate, then ventures towards spice. White pepper and clove are foremost, but futher attention provides nutmeg and ginger. The finish is full of black grape skin, covered in white chocolate, vanilla and nougat. Brown sugar, rum, and bourbon all make cameos, but this is never over-boozy nor oversweet. Actually, alcohol is phased out entirely, and merely carries suggestions of related flavors. Ends with a bath of grape, vanilla and herb. Good lord! Medium bodied, with dashing carbonation. This screams for additional draughts. And lots of them. I appear to fancy this more than the non-aged Aventinus. It's a glorious brew and well worth the inflated price. All things considered, I'll purchase the standard issues and age them myself....and hope they turn out just as well.  Damn!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,WesWes,4.07,"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is exceptional. It has a nice fruity wheat scent with the addition of crystal malts for color and maltiness. The taste is good. It has a warm malty flavor with a crisp fruity wheat aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a damn good beer. For such a high abv., it goes down easy and finishes smooth; a fine sessions beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,ViveLaChouffe,4.7,"Pours a deep hazy brown with a frothy tan head. Lacy. Smells of wheat malt and ripe banana. Cloves and light caramel.  Wow. This beer is amazing. My description will not do it justice. Tastes of dark wheat malt and strong ripe banana. Caramel and cloves. Rich, complex flavors. Fruity. This is sooo smooth. For a 12% ABV brew, it remarkably smooth. Rich malty aftertaste. Soooo drinkable and so tasty. This beer makes me happy.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,bigbeerdrinka,4.35,"Appearance: Pours a medium dark brown with a slight ruby and amber hue when held up to the light. A strong whitish head pours about an inch thick without any lacing on the glass  Smell: Smells of dark fruits, figs, plums, raisins, along with a slight chocolate and wheat aroma. This beer also has a noticeable alcohol aroma.  Taste: Wheat and other dark malts hit up front followed by a smooth grape and raisin flavor. This beer then shows off some of its alcohol tones along with what tastes like bittersweet chocolate. This beer finishes with more grape flavors and dark fruits and finally a little more warm alcohol.  Mouthfeel: This beer is supersmooth. The flavors just combine perfectly and the body is surprisingly light and crisp.  Drinkabilty: For a beer that is as kicking as this one is, it goes down easier than the fresh bottles. Simply amazing.  Overall: If you like Aventinus, try it aged... You'll absolutely love it. I sure as hell do. Super smooth and well balanced.. What great flavors..",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,assurbanipaul,4.68,"Why, oh why have I waited so long to write a review? Always overlooked, forgotten, yet remaining one of my all-time, cross-style favorites. But perhaps a blessing in disguise, for it gives me an excuse to open a new bottle.  Pours a clear, dark chestnut with an enormous off-white head, requiring several pours to fill a glass, but retires quickly to just a fizzy ring. Aroma is sweet, sweet caramelized malt, pumpernickel and some light yeast.  Taste is a steady stream of caramel, butter rum and malty goodness. Faintly and subtly spiced with hints of syrup, nutmeg, cloves, raisins. Bready with very little alcohol presence in the flavors. Maybe a chocolate malt taste but not chocolate, just barely the taste of sour apple. Hint of bubblegum arrives late on the palate.  Mouthfeel is on the heavy side but well-carbonated and finishes clean with only a faint, gentile aftertaste. Full-bodied and fantastically easy to drink. A great example of both the dopplebock style and what an ideal beer should aspire to be.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,wyllder,3.4,"Pours a deep, muddy golden brown, with a modest fizzy head that settles down to little more than a lacing.  Nose has some alcohol esthers and a scent of what I can only describe as burnt hops.  First sip is interesting, leading in with a quick hit of hops, mellowed out by a mild burnt malt taste and then the hops are back, mixing with the carbonation to form an interesting combination of dark caramel roasty malt and hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is ok, with the carbonation being a bit too agressive against the burnt taste for my liking.  This is my first review of a Weizenbock, and I've found I am evidently not a fan of the style. While I can appreciate the complexity and craft of this brew, the taste ended up being unpalatable to me after about 2/3 of the bottle and I couldn't force myself to finish it.  If you like Weizenbocks, I have little reason to doubt you'll like or love this.  Wyll-",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,DrJay,4.52,"Cloudy, dark coppery brown with a dark cream coloured head. High carbonation kept a thin layer of foam on top until the end. Ripe bananas and caramel sweetness are apparent in the aroma, as is some aromatic spiciness. The first impression on taking a sip was surprise at how creamy the texture is. The carbonation mixes very well with the full body to make it seem almost ""chewy"". A slight yeastiness forms a base for the flavour, with fruit, nuts, spice, licorice, and some faint chocolate and bitterness mixed in. Alcohol warmth is noticeable at the finish and provides a slight spiced rum character as well. This is a spectacular beer, and definitely worth a try.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,ken3c,4.25,Dark brown with lots of big bubbled foam tapers quickly but leaves a layer on top.  Smells like fruit and bread like a really good raison bread.  First taste is unexpectedly tart and fruity. Reminded me of the taste of mango. Very good and gets better. A big crescendo of taste and a surprising subtle aftertaste. Almost no sense of the high alcohol.  Very bubbly sensation makes it feel lighter than it is.  Very drinkable.,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,elmocoso,4.34,"Huge, creamy, cream-colored head. Very bulbous with a loose knit texture. The brew is a muddy chocolate color or a cloudy cola. Head receides too quickly, maybe from the high alcohol.  Very estery nose - a little chocolaty with tones of cloves - malty.  Rich mouthfeel on the first drink. Smooth and malty with touches of caramel. A little pleasent bitterness in the deep finish.  This beer hides the alcohol very well. Smooth and refreshing.  I swerrel and pour the dregs of the bottle in to the glass and the yeast adds both body and gives a bready roundness to the beer.  Dangerously easy drinking.",Schneider Weisse G.

The body, dark toned in a brown, slightly translucid dusty pour, considerably carbonated with a thick head, slightly tanned past simply white. The smell gives off wheat and malt all at the same time, with a certain moderation and delicacy.

Smell is fresh and of fig/raisin, raspberry, bran muffins, syrah grapes and of course alcohol. Well mixed and inviting.  Taste shows up to the party firing on all cylinders. Dark fruit, wheat, syrah/shirz-y pepper, spice and a dry alcohol finish.   Mouthfeel is great, not quite 5 material yet but getting close. The carbonation, body and overall ""shape"" of the beer fit the aroma and taste quite well.  Drinkability gets a good. I like this beer a lot and could really have this in a lot of situations. The only factor lowering the drinkability here is the alcohol content, I like the warming and slight buzz but this would turn a two beer happy hour to a one beer happy hour.

72,224,Beastdog75,4.22,"Aventinus is a brew that provides a lot of ""entertainment"" for the senses. The beer looks good, smells good, tastes good, and feels good. It masterfully combines elements of a doppelbock with some of the subtleties of a hefeweizen. This is definitely a beer that is worth trying.  Aventinus pours a hazy, copper-like brown color with a massive foam head that rests on top of the brew. The head lasts for a few minutes before vanishing. The smell starts off like a doppelbock, with some big malty scents of caramel present along with the presence of alcohol. After a few moments, some weisse smells come through such as spices and banana. The infamous ""dark fruit"" smell is here too. This beer feels quite smooth and is moderately carbonated. The bock qualities are immediately noticable upon tasting. The malt presence lends flavors of caramel and honey while the alcohol presence is quite noticable on the palette as well. A slight wheaty twang shows up to remind you of the wheat presence in the brew. This brew struck me as quite fruity, with apples, bananas, figs, and maybe even some cherry present as well. The flavors brought to mind a brandy in some ways. Some generic spiciness, cloves, and cinnamon were detectable but were not the focal point. Moderate dryness in the finish. Dryness continues on with the alcohol presence and the dark fruitiness, and the warming sensation from the alcohol is one of the most pleasant in recent memory.  This is a very nice brew. It would be perfect for the winter months, but I would drink this any time during the year. It is complex enough that everyone has their own interpretation of this brew. Don't just read the reviews, go buy this one and discover what lies inside this ""trip in a bottle.""",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,DPMomutant,4.32,"Big head as this pours. Lasts a little bit before leaving just a little bit. Not much lacing. The body is dark brown, but not quite opaque.  The spiciness in the smell reminds me of some strong Belgians I've had lately but isn't quite as strong. Much fruitiness in there as well.  Not so much fruitiness in the taste. The spiciness really does come out now. The alcohol is not very evident in the taste. A little banana in the aftertaste.  Carbonation in this beer is on the high side but not too much. The body is a bit watery for my taste but doesn't detract from the overall experience. The alcohol is comforting in the finish.  Not a session-type beer, but great for after dinner or relaxing late at night (as I am now). A slow nightcap, and drinkable for what it is.  Overall this is very good. My first in this style but this is a great balance between the Weiss and the Bock styles and I would recommend it.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,twilight,4.6,"Dark like dark honey, a rich almost clear brown with some red. The head is thick and creamy with bubbles still rising as I stare at this beautiful pint. Is it the beer or my dashing pouring technique. Awwww shucks, you guys are the best.  Aroma is fruity, on the side of spiced malt, almost.  Mouth filling spiciness with initial taste of sour grass with a hint of cinammon but not cinammon. I can't really describe it, and this is what I love about dopplebocks. Wheat lightness coupled with grassy bitterness with a hint of fruitiness with the vaguest hints of sweetness. It subsides to a bitterish grassy note with the wheat carrying the lighness of the beer. Alcohol taste is present only in the lingering taste well after the sip.  Mouthfeel is so good. Carbonation swishes forth when you first taste it, almost overtaking the initial bite, but then subsides to let the taste break through.  I could take huge gulps of this one, particularly on a nice pre-summer day like today? What am I doing inside reviewing this beer? I don't know. Call me crazy.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,beerinator,3.8,"Appearance: Cloudy maple color. Off white head with not too much retention.  Aroma: Smells sweet and sharp, with alcohol notes present. A bit of fruit noted. The beer's sweetness seems to be deriving from caramel, and not the fruit.  Taste: Heavy malt upfront. Lots of carbonation on the tongue. Finishes with a bit of sweetness. The tingly on the tongue is slightly harsh.  Notes: Pretty decent example of a dopplebock. Mouthfeel isn't the best, but it still is a good drinking beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,PorterLambic,4.47,"A huge head develops initially, slowling the pouring process while you wait for it to drop down to its thin, almost film-like final state. A deep, caramel brown, basically clear although it is bottle conditioned and some yeast sediment is present at the very end of the pour. Smell is malty, sweet, somewhat smoky . Taste is very complex with sweet, sour, smoke, chocolate & malt most noticeable initially, with spice (cloves & nutmeg), chocolate & a floral-like alcohol in the aftertaste. Spice more present in aftertaste. Smooth, slightly tingly on the tongue, not much carbonation. Warming of alcohol develops very nicely, tapers off slowly. Very drinkable, albeit slowly due to the 8% ABV. A 500 ml bottle of this won't disappear in a few minutes time, but will slowly as you linger over the various flavors. Highly recommended. This beer single-handedly destroyed all my preconceived notions of what a German beer tasted like. A definte, ""must try"" beer. In my top ten of all time.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,faernt,4.4,"Aventinus is one of my favorites and my wife gave me these bottles of 2000 as a Christmas present last Christmas 2003. The initial pour is clear with an atypical small head that settles into a skim. I've had Aventinus pour with a 3"" head in a weisse bier glass and this poured into a chalice and didn't flash the big boy head of the standard issue. Nonetheless it threw a spicy and raisiny aroma that urged me on to drink.  The taste is very blended and spicy. After enjoying the first pour I refilled my glass with the remainder of the bottle and forgot about the age and probable yeast floating up from the bottom. It came into my glass with the balance of the beer giving me floaties and cloudiness and a resultant bitterness that wasn't present before. I urge you to take care in your pour since I feel I blew it by pouring in the disturbed balance.  This is still a very good beer even with my blundering pour. It remains drinkable in the Summer and Fall and Winter. This is a versatile weisse.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Trentonator,4.7,"Nice thick, creamy head, the color of the beer is gorgeous! It's at once brown with purple tints, some red and black too. Head lasts a little too little, but it's very large. Smell is awesome too, I get some raisins, banannas, maybe a hint of toffee. Taste-spectacular! Absolutely delicious, almost ""chewy"", it tastes so incredibly rich, it's almost sinful. High marks for this beer all around.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BadBadger,4.63,"This beer is truely amazing. Watch out when you pour this beer, a monster tan head arises. Use the largest pilsner glass you have available. The smell is a citrus aroma, if you weren't looking at the extreme dark color of this fine beverage you would think this was a plain old hefe. The taste will knock your socks off: citrus, cloves, an explosion all over the lingual taste buds. Thsi is one wonderful spicy concoction, which unfortuantely limits its drinkability. Enjoy one ASAP!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Afterburner,4.44,"Appearance: Poured a deep mahogany color with a thick, foamy, eggshell-colored head. Good head retention.  Smell: Rich malt aroma, with a strong fruity character. Typical bananas and also (oddly) cantaloupe. Also has an earthy smell, almost like damp, overturned soil. Finally some hints of anise and clove spiciness.  Taste: Tart, lively tang immediately upon consumption. Malt and caramel show up with fanfare halfway through, along with faint chocolate notes and hops. Finish is strongly banana, with subdued hop character, raisins, and noticable alcohol burn. Also a faint taste of cloves.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. More effervescent than your usual doppelbocks, but less effervescent than a standard hefe-weizen.  Drinkability: Reasonably so, although the alcohol might be a limiting factor.  Overall: This was a marvelously complex beer, very similar in tone to Wolnzacher Roggenbier. And the fact that the high malt content comes primarily from wheat malt gives this beer an interesting character that few other beers can match. Recommended.",Schneider Weisse G.

Big sweet and toasty malt smells. Tropical fruit, mainly banana, and an almost bubblegum hint. A bit of brown sugar and hints of clove and dark rum. Mmmm good! Sweet toasted bready malt flavor. Lots of rum soaked, sugared fruit, spices and a little nuttiness as well. Chocolate, clove and cola in the finish. Outstanding! Medium to full bodied with a rich, full, creamy mouthfeel that was lightened nicely by the carbonation. The alcohol made its presence known as the beer warmed, but in a complementary way. This along with the carbonation induced light mouthfeel leads to great drinkability. But beware, it'll sneak up on you.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,rajendra82,4.42,"The reddish orange to burnt amber looking body surprised me with its initial clarity and the lack of cloudiness. The second pour however had a large number of floating clumps of the little friends. The initial head was an inch and a half in height with a fizzy carbonation. The head did not last very long at all, and there was no lacing to speak of. The smell was perfumey to medicinal alcohol with underlying banana, clove, and ripe cherries. The taste was initially quite sweet with lots of fruity esters and spices typical for a German wheat beer. The alcohol appears to be very well hidden at first, but as the beer warms up, it starts to step in front of other flavors and introduces a lot of dryness in the mix. Towards the end of the glass, the hops make a surprisingly strong appearance. There is a faint smokiness to the malt that is like a wispy ghost. Mouthfeel is not as creamy as I had hoped for, and the yeast adds a mildly unpleasant metallic twang. Very complex beer that starts out easy, and then changes its tune a couple of times as it has your attention.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Rose up thin and fizzed away immediately. Very heavy bead.  Smell: Green apples and chocolate were the main components. Also some light banana, lemon zest, and a good dollup of grainy wheat. Became somewhat sour on the nose after a short period of time.  Mouthfeel: Kind of thin in the mouth. A little chewy, but also a little chalky. Sometimes, it had an extrememly rough bite in the back of the throat.  Taste: Heavy clove, banana, and tart fruit. Seemed very sour and not really in a good way. Like extremely over-the-top green apple, but with a chemical bite. Powdered cocoa and light wheat rounded out the flavors with some hints of yeast and a continuation of the annoying sour flavor on the finish.  I was pretty disappointed with this one. Between the almost non-existent head and the weird sour flavor, I almost thought that I had on off bottle and didn't review it.

The smell is wonderful... The head's still there after 20 minutes... I'm savouring the comparison...making it last. The head's still there...

Dark brown in color that you can just see through, fizzy head that didn't last, but left a touch of lace behind. Not that it mattered because this was a fragrant beer without the head with fruity banana notes and a sweet aroma from the alcohol. Medium to full body. More carbonated than I thought it would be.

Pours a nice cloudy copper under a voluminous three finger beige head wiht great retention and firm body. There was some lacing, but should have been more. The nose is a wonderful combination of the strong malt expected of a doppelbock and the yeast and spice of a Hefeweizen. The compliment each other very well. The mouth is very prickly and too light for this style. The taste is ooh so smooth, with lemon and coriander on top of a good barley base. When cold, there is no noticeable caramel, with the sweetness far more citrus than candy. As it warms, though the candy emerges, and takes over, leaving a very sweet aftertaste from the final swallow. There are no discernible hops, and the alcohol is very well hidden.

The beer pours a hazy dark brown with subtle purple highlights with a massive and I mean massive chiffon like head. Not much in the way of lacing.  The nose is sweet smelling with clear notes of raisins and clove. Strong alcohol presence s well.  Sweet initial taste with the alcohol (8%) clearly present. Beer also has a slightly sour aspect to it as you work your way further into the beer. The raisin taste from the smell is also present in the taste. Some fruit flavors (plums) also emerge.  Wow this is an interesting beer. The mouthfel is nice and soft, the carbonation is very subdued which seems strange to me given the massive head.

As it got closer, I realized it was merely a deep ruby color, but what a color it was. The locals at the table tried their hand at English with us, giving us the warning that this beer was not for amateurs. Taking a sniff, you could tell this beer was in the 8% range. Pretty alcohol smelling. As I took the first sip, my worries of it tasting like pure alcohol were put to ease. While there was a bit of an alcohol taste, there was plenty of malt here to balance that out. A bit of a clove taste followed it as well. It was a lot crisper than I was expecting.

The yeast pour adds a slight haze. Spicy! nose. Sweet, with cream. The front is tangy, tangy fruit. Green apples and candy sugar. With temperature that tanginess tames to the point where some banana shows. Sweet fruit in the middle with some cream. The creaminess builds as the beer warms, turning almost milk-chocolatey. Tangy again in the finish; toffee, some bread, lots of spice. Some alcohol in the aftertaste. This beer really needs to warm up to bloom. When cold, the tangy fruit is almost overwhelming. With temperature, the fruit softens considerable and the thick, malty, creamy, chocolatey malt starts to shine through. Stunningly good when warm.

Taste is pretty interesting. To me this beer seems to blend the qualities of a nice German wheat and a nice Belgian dark ale. It's bubbly and complex like a Belgian dark, but also very wheaty with hints of banana like a German wheat. Very interesting beer. It's a nice to have a bottle every couple of weeks or so.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,watermelonman,4.38,"This poured to a dark brown with hints of purple and red. The head is large and fluffy, and sticks around through the duration of the glass. The whole thing just looks great.  Wheat malts are detectable in the taste up front, with a strong bock-style punch of alcohol at the end of the taste. The alcoholic content is very apparent but not overwhelming. It feels sharp in the mouth without offending, and it's pretty easy to drink considering what's inside.  While I felt the Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock was good but perhaps a touch overdone, this beer is simply outstanding.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,woemad,4.35,"500ml bottle purchased at Jum's Homebrew in Spokane for $3.30.  Poured a dark orangy amber color, with a huge, uneven off-white head that took its time dissipating.  Smell was of wheat (duh) coupled with the aroma of cloves. There's also a little bit of caramelish sweetness.  Taste was of wheat, but not a dominant hefeweizen wheatiness. This wheat taste mingles with a malty sweetness and a clove-cinammon spiciness. There is a very slight hoppy crispness in the finish, but it is very subdued in comparison to what came before it. The abv is not noticeable at all.  Mouthfeel is moderately thick, but not as thick as I thought it would be, being a ""wheat-doppelbock"". Neverthelss it is a little bit filling.  This is a very drinkable beer. I would not hesitate to have one in the future. It might be a little bit much for someone to have repeated pints of, however. There's a reason few bars have doppels on tap. This is a good thing. Something 8%abv that goes down this easy should have some sort of arresting effect.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,tjd25,4.5,"A copper color, darker at the top of the glass. A verny nice aroma of wheat. Some red fruits maybe.  The taste reveals the wheat and some dark malts. A great sensation on the palate. The beers is nicely fruity and ends on a very pleasing note of nuts. Raspberries. Some caramel too. The hoppy bitterness was almost hidden. A zest of lemon. Very nice mouthfeel. Very smooth. You feel the alcohol after a few sips, but it is well balanced with the powerful flavor. Such a good beer. I could have many of these... Why am I sharing this bottle with my friend who says ""it's ok""???",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,ColoradoBobs,4.77,"My first bottle certainly measured up to the reviews.  Unpasteurized, unfiltered with top fermentation yeast that settled to the bottom of the bottle. I wish I could tell when this one was bottled, since it's truly a ""live"" beer that matures and ripens. Anyway, however ripe this one was, it would be hard to imagine it getting any better with age.  Beautiful dark red-brown pour, with an incredible tan head that lasted well; and yet it kept a nice carbonation throughout. Rich, almost warm smells of baked figs(?) and malt.  Really an adventure in beer: all that malt and all that wheat, and hardly any hops -- just the way I like it. A kind of nutty, unsweetened cocoa; a hint of raspberry; some smoke: a ton of flavor mixed in a very smoooth nectar with an almost clove-like finish.  I loved the last bit -- followed the instructions I was given and left about an ounce in the bottom and swirled it at the end to pick up the yeast -- what an amazing flavor that was!  Overall, this is definitely a ""WOW!"" beer! One to savor.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,pootz,4.66,"My first chance to drink this world famous wheat beer. Looked forward to it and finally some arrived circa 2003 production. It appears to be a wonderful hybrid of two beer styles...heffe weizen and dopple bock and the advantages of both beers comes through.  Came in a tall 1/2 liter crown top with a lush looking label with some medieval geezer on it....write up on the beer's bottle fermentation Champaign-like process. Has a coded date and lot code useless to me to decipher.  Poured a clouded mahogany-red with a fine-pored tan cap that stacked out of the glass then stayed as a fine 1 cm cap that rode out the whole drink. Highly effervescent.  Gloriously understated aromas of spice-figs and sweet malt hints of cocoa.  Starts with a peppery, malty departure then builds on the palate and tongue to a rapturous complex mixture of spices, nuts, sweet roasty malt, citrus peel with cocoa undertones with a somehow, full...but clean, gritty body...then the back end changes significantly to a mellow banana-clove overtone with sweet malt and some hop balance....leaving an after taste that is semi sweet and infused with a dozen different lingering spicy tastes leaving the tongue embattled....then...subtle ""warming"" from the 8%ABV...which doesn't crash down on you as it does in other strong beers that dont hide their Alcohol well.  WoW!! This is bottled ersatz ecstasy ! Back to the LCBO for more, I hope it cellars well.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,beergeek279,4.42,"Served in the 500 mL bottle into a weizen glass. The color is brown, with a nice lingering white head. The smell is a malt sweetness and a banana/clove from the wheat. The taste has a nice malt sweetness at first and then the wheat tanginess shows later in the taste, and the alcohol is present but certainly not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is very well-carbonated. As for drinkability, I'd feel very comfortable drinking several of these!!  I'd heard so much about this beer as a Top 20-ish beer, so I was glad to come across the wrapped bottle in Akron. I'm glad I did too, since this is a fantastic beer. The dark barley malt and wheat malt mix very nicely into a unique experience, and certainly one I'd hope to have again in the future!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Boto,4.67,"Bottled: WOW! Came out a little fizzy, but the head died down immediately. The color is a slightly cloudy brown. Malty, wheat and cloves make for a rich taste. Undertones of alcohol, but doesn't overpower the taste. Nose is a bit floral. Also hints of clove. Very full taste. VERY GOOD! This bottle was aged for a year and a half. It was much better than when new!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,yankeeheel,4.05,Pours a brackish brown with a minimalist carbonation of a head. Keeps bubbling up from the bottom of the glass and making little eddies of foam around the edge of the glass.  Smells strongly of dark fruit and a little bit of alcohol.  The taste is pure fruity goodness up front. Lots of sweet sugars rush right in. A little bit grainy and chewy in the middle with a minimal hop ending. Really a sweet beer.  Mouthfeel is very slick and a little drying at the end.  Drink till you can't.,Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,LuckySevens82,4.33,"Pours a dark brown with slight orange tinges. The head is insane, however, it does not stay around for too long. Smells of dark malts, caramel and alcohol, there are some winey hints to the nose as well. The taste is amazing, sweet, a little malty and smooth, wow, this is just excellent. There are also many spices, it seems like nutmeg, maybe cinnamon. This is just one great beer, it's not something I could drink every night, but on cold nights and well whenever really, this very much hits the spot Overall, this is just a tasty beer, I will definitely return to this from time to time.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,SaunaKing,3.62,"I picked up this beer the other day because I am trying to sample more beers of this style since they are becoming more attractive to me the more I have them.  The first time I ever had a wheat beer a few years ago I couldn't finish it, it was that bad.  Now I am liking these offerings. The appearance of this beer was quite nice, cloudy and dark, a rich copper colour. The head was perfect, building quickly and a light brown/gray colour that settled down with not too much lacing. The smell was very complex, many different things happening and really reminded me of Hoegaarden which I have really taken a liking to lately.  The taste was nice for a first try and I will follow up with a 12 pack or so to determine where this will go in my regular rotation. The comination of wheat beer and high alcohol content made it difficult to give too much of a complimentary review on my first tasting but I really think this will develop into one of my faves.  I cannot however imagine buying a 12 pack and drinking it down on a nice summer day like I would with one of my favorite pilsners.  A good first impression, I look forward to many more of these.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,OldFrothingSlosh,4.15,"The wheat doppelbock pours a amazing apple cider in appearance and color. All sorts of very fine yeast sediment visible. Impossibly tight carbonation sits as a thin ring around the edges of the beer, only to foam and billow up as I swirl the glass. Low to moderate lacing of the glass. Aromas are all over the place: fruits by the truckload, with ripe banannas and granny smith apples leading the way. A spicy, almost peppery zip as well. I didn't note the chocolate that others have smelled. Flavor is complex. Large dose of grain-like flavor initially, followed by a quick burst of sweetness, then ends with a strange mix of peppery bitterness. Almost an acidic-dry finish. Warming effect from the alcohol becomes more prominent at the very end. Decent body and carbonation. Drinkability is good as well. For as complex a beer at this is, it comes off very well-balanced and flavorful. A keeper!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BuckeyeNation,3.62,"While pouring Aventinus into my new weizen glass, I was stunned to see the crown rise quickly to the top. In fact, no beer was visible at first, just foam. As I type, the head is very slowly being replaced by beer. Give this one the gentlest of pours if you want to avoid a mess.  Golden brown... like freshly squeezed apple cider. The beer is hazy, almost turbid, with a torrent of carbonation rising off the bottom of the glass. The huge head is light toffee in hue and looks like it isn't going anywhere fast. Strangely enough, almost no lace sticks.  The nose is malty sweet with scents of melted caramel, apple cider, clove and light brown sugar. The beginning of each mouthful is reminiscent of sweet, fermented apples. Things then become pretty intensely dry and puckery. With warming, the spicier elements of the flavor (clove especially) come to the fore. This is probably the most clove-intensive beer that I've had yet.  The furious fizziness of the mouthfeel lessens over time, but never completely fades. The body seems fine otherwise; it's neither full nor light. Good job on masking the 8.2% ABV.  Aventinus is a bit of a letdown. I'm not sure what I expected from a weizenbock, but this wasn't it. It's a little too sour, a little too dry and way too carbonated. I'll probably give it another go sometime, since this may not have been a properly cared for bottle.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,GreenWBush,4.43,"This beauty poured out a dark fudge brown with a huge fluffhead that completely receded and left no laceage. I was a little disappointed by the aroma; it was more of a beer-breath or spilled beer aroma.  But the taste was incredible. Hints of clove, tropical fruit, chocolate, sweet molasses. The mouthfeel was decent but a bit on the weak side for such a big beer.  The alcohol was hidden so well this could be lethal for a session. After a 1/2L, I was already struggling. I will definetely get this again.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,sulldaddy,4.82,"I am very excited to try this brew as the regular version is probably my overall favorite beer. The bottle comes wrapped in paper with some purple type printed on it. Brewed in 2000 mixed with events that occurred that year. I peel back the paper and find the bottle cap to be a little rusty, hmmm could be a bad sign but I press on. The cap pops right off. The brew pours similar to the yearly offering. Soft creamy off white head foams up very easily, nice tight latticework. Color in my chalice is a rich,clear, dark red color. Aroma, is yeasty bread, cherries, maybe grapes and actually birch beer. This last scent throws me a little but its there. First sip gives me a fine prickly carbonation and slightly thick body. Flavor is rich and complex. I get a sweet malty hit up front followed quickly by bready yeast flavor and then tart sour cherries and the finish brings back the birch beer from the aroma. This is a very good complex beer that I think has improved greatly with 3 years in a cave. I am going to buy more of these if I see them for sure!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,RedDiamond,4.87,"This is the LOUDEST beer I've ever had. A virtual Rice Krispies of a beer, snapping and crackling with much gusto in the glass. Pours from the bottle racy, soft, and energized. UPS brown with a faded white head and an absolute ass-kicking aroma. The smell reaches out and puts a headlock on your sensibilities. It is oddly cola-like with a vibrant spice rack of fragrances that are both sweet and peppery; perhaps a chocolate-ginger mix though the bottle suggests clove.  The taste grabs the fragrance and accelerates its magnitude. It's like drinking a jigsaw puzzle. Every sip is curious and mysteriously imprecise though in the end it all comes together. A sort of citrus-licorice presence is maintained. It is inexplicably fabulous.  I honestly had no foreknowledge or expectations about this strange wheat doppelbock. It just looked good and it was on sale. It has proven to be an indispensable beer drinking experience I could not otherwise imagine was possible.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,jahred,4.57,"Newly brewed Aventinus Wheat Doppelbock is one of my favorites - let's see what happens when it's aged a few years.  Pours a dark orange brown color, with a nice medium-sized bubbly off-white head. As in the original, there's much carbonation to this beer, and the head disappears quickly.  The scent is a bit more smooth than regular aventinus. More fruity, too. The smell isn't as strong anymore, but it's still there, and still lovely. Orange and bananas and a nice hint of clove. Mmmm.  The taste is similar to the regular aventinus, but much smoother, maltier, creamier, and more biscuity. The predominant clove taste in the original seems less strong now (though it's still there), and the expected (fantastic) banana taste remains.  The alcohol is less in-your-face, and thus the beer is now a bit less warming. This takes away a bit from the taste, but makes the aventinus even more easy to drink.  Overall, I still prefer the original, non-aged version, in all its wonderful wildness (especially at half the price), but this was still a fantastic beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,ChimayMayDay,4.89,"If beer is liquid bread, then Aventinus is liquid cake (or some form of dessert). I love the decadence of this beer. Ludwig's on Samson St. in Philly pours all of mine. Speaking of the pour, it takes a while. I sometimes order an easy Hefe-Weizen to drink while I wait for the Aventinus. The thick head eventually subsides to a creamy topping. The color is a wonderful dark brown. The mouthfeel is creamy and sometimes milky. I have to remind myself that this is somehow related to watery macrobrews. Somehow...  There's the flavor of wheat and malt at the beginning and a nice alcohol taste at the end. In between are even more flavors, including bananas and some chocolate and all kinds of sweetness (I'll leave others to decide exactly which fruits are present).  I don't have to mention that I feel like curling up in a beanbag chair or a fluffy cloud after drinking this. I even find myself floating on a dark river in the land of dreams. I'm sorry, I was talking about beer.  Some may say I am nuts, but I have noted the smell and taste of bubble gum at times. Bubble gum!!! Is this beer? The answer is no. It's ambrosia.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,xgrigorix,4.03,"Half liter brown bottle, no dates.  Cloudy dark brown. Intense carbonation. A tall, proud off white head retains well, & leaves a little bit of lace behind.  Cloves are prevelant in the nose, along with other spicy notes, a bit of fruit, & a hint of alcohol in the background.  Spicy, fruity - notes of figs & raisins, along with a big clove flavour that if overpowering. Medium/full bodied, slick, with robust pinpoint carbonation.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Foxman,4.33,"It pours a deep, rich garnet, looking rather lustrous. Rising streams of carbonation proliferate. A thick, spongy light tan head expands rapidly, then clings to the sides as it slowly recedes, hollowing out a foamy crater. Ropy lacing slides down the inside of the glass.  The aroma brings spicy fruit, with citrus and clove springing to mind. A yeasty tartness works subtly throughout. A distant milk chocolate note comes gently in to fade at the finish.  The yeast delivers it tanginess upfront, almost instantly giving way to a mild dry citrus tone wrapped in cloves. The chocolate slides in again, understatedly, this time accompanied by a slight dark cherry tartness. A grain current flows lightly toward the end, fading along with a very mellow bitterness at the finish.  Medium bodied, the texture virtually fills the mouth, coating readily. The high carbonation and spicy character leave a fresh sensation on the tongue for some time after it slips away.  It starts as simply lovely to look at, then carries through as wonderful to the last drop in the bottle. The full flavor and spicy character give it a big and true identity. As full a beer as it is, though, it ever sacrifices being refreshingly drinkable. Even the relatively high ABV remains well hidden, and doesn't seem to wreak any havoc. It promises big things, them keeps those promises, a trait that makes it something to keep close by, like in your refrigerator, in quantity, so you always know the next one's there and ready for you.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,GeoffRizzo,4.87,"Deep amber hue, huge rocky, bubbly white head, decent lacing throughout the course of this masterpiece. Fresh fruit, grapes, orange peel, plums, bananas, cloves all grace the nose. Up front, a definitive sweetness, spicy cloves with a gigantic malt back base. The definition of full bodied, toasty and bready flavorings are offered, somewhat acidic, subdued, but revealed alcohol presence. The massively complex flavorings of apple pie, fresh plums, cherries, bananas, hefe-spices, and cloves are all there. Remarkable, world class and superb.",Schneider Weisse G.

Subdued chocolate covered banana aroma with some clove spicyness.  This tastes pretty damn good! This is wonderful! It is simple yet complex and very flavorful. Banana and clove spicyness with some other light fruits and moderate spices. Get a tiny bit of chocolate but not much. Alcohol is very well hidden which makes this just about as drinkable as a regular 5% Hefster.  I really enjoyed this!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,ToolHead,4.73,"50 cl bottle, served in Aventinus glass. Appearance-wise, this is one of the most beautiful beers around, especially when served in the right glass: Deep, opaque reddish-brown; enormous, stable head that sticks around until the very end; massive carbonation visible all the way up the tall glass. It's almost - almost - a shame to drink a beer this fine-looking... Taste is highly complex, easily combining the freshness of a wheat beer w/ the depth and fullness of taste of a doppelbock. Exemplary. Luxurious mouthfeel and very good drinkability w/ the 8% abv. being well hidden. A unique and wonderful brew that's become one of my all-time favorites.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,RockyTopHeel,4.62,"Clear and somewhat chocolate-shaded brown, my first crack at an Aventinus poured with a nice, white head and a surprisingly wheaty aroma. That same wheat melds with dark, rich bock flavors and some fruit sweetness in a beautiful union with the twinge of alcohol around the edges. These flavors dance wonderfully across the palate.  This is very, very, even exceptionally good, and pretty unique--at least in my limited experience. It's also astoundingly drinkable for something so dark and alcoholic. Wow.  Spoils of the 10/11/03 Knoxville Raid.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,claytri,4.13,"Aventinus poors a deep cloudy brown with hints of amber. It develops a nice thin tan head that settles to a good lace. The carbonation ascending from the stem in the center of the glass was a nice touch. It had a strong malt smell with hints of yeast and fruit. I really was not prepared for the taste. It was winelike with a strong citric bite to it, with nice undertones of sweetness. At times I tasted grapes, cherries, and blackberries. It had a dry crisp feel with a citric finish. A one off beer when a different taste is desired.  I was expecting something nearer a stout. I was pleasantly surprised. I may have to experiment and try it with strong meats to see if that enhances the experience. I was having it with pasta and cheeses and the food seemed to stop the beers tastes.",Schneider Weisse G.

I have unfortunately never had this beer on tap but it is hard to imagine it being more exquisite than it is out of the bottle. I first had this beer at the Silver Swan in New York City while eating wild boar and venison. It is a great beer to accompany a heavy meal. It is a great dark weisse and right after you open the bottle you can smell the distant smells of banana and cloves. Once you taste this beer you will be astounded by the flavor. It is 8% alcohol but goes down smooth and if you aren't careful, after a few you will definitely feel it. I recommend Aventinus to anyone and if anyone knows where I can find it on tap in the NY/NJ area, let me know!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The head eventually recedes to a sparse bubbly lace. Clove and other spices stand out in the aroma, with a hint of plum and chocolate and a touch of alcohol. Medium mouth feel with a high amount of carbonation that gives a fluffiness to the mouth feel. Sweet dark fruity malt up front followed by clove and some yeast notes. A touch of citric hop comes in towards the finish. The alcohol is also a bit noticeable towards the end and ever so slightly warming. The clove flavor lasts into the long aftertaste along with some of the alcohol. Very pleasurable brew to drink again and again, yet not one that Id consider a session brew.",Schneider Weisse G.

It has a fruity like banana flavor and some hints of nutmeg. The alcohol is definately there, but it is not overbearing.  Mouthfeel is thick, bubbly and very crisp.  Whew... down to the end of my glass and I am certainly feeling it. This one is a great way to unwind after a long day of work, but I don't think I could put many of these down in one sitting.

A punch in the nose of bananas, clove, and bubblegum. Taste starts off very sweet, first with some candy, followed by some dark fruits, and finally a dash of hops in the aftertaste to take the edge off the sweetness. Still a little sweeter than I would ideally prefer. I expected the mouthfeel, while hardly classifiable as thin, to be slighty fuller. This is a wonderful beer.

72,224,99bottles,4.7,"I tried this last weekend on tap, after much searching and seeking. Mmmm. It looked wonderful. It smelled deep and yeasty, like stacks of hucked wheat, like the soil from which it once came. It lacked the sweety, esteric character of the 'look how high our ABV is' wheat bocks, and I suppose it should. This is, so I'm told, the benchmark for a weizenbock. The nose was great, everything I expected. The appearance too, what I anticipated. The taste. Well, the taste knocked me off my bar stool and I hit the ground with such a resounding thud, I flew upwards 15,000 miles into the stratosphere of YUM. This is a seriously delicious beer. It had the wheat/yeast tone I expected, and yet there also were subtle pickerings of hop, of sticky malt, of vibrant carbonation. Sweet, but only enough to make you want more. An aftertaste you'd like to call sour, but really just readies your palette for another complex and delicious sip. The beer really surprised me. The 8.0% amazes me. It's there only because you expect it to be. It's a travesty to think that the invisible ABV hurts its drinkability. If only the availability in PA was better, I would have crowned myself a new king in Beerworld. Thank goodness for NJ. Go try. I hope the reviews aren't suffering from poor handling, but I do realize this is primarily a bottled beer in the States. I'm sure it's good in bottles, but on tap, the flavors are so intense, they last forever in the finish, and they slide gracefully across your tounge like you just ate a silk shirt dipped in axel grease. It's that good. Wow. WOW. KClinger's has it right now on tap upstairs. It's worth whatever you have to do to try it.

I'm not sure if the bottle got shaken up a bit on the car ride home from the store, but this beer poured with the biggest head I've ever seen. It was an off-white, light, beautiful foam. The beer beneath the head had a deep brown color with hints of amber.  The taste was just a bit less appealing than the appearance. I tasted hints of chocolate and spice and was left with an overall sweet taste. The typical grainy, wheat taste was also very noticeable, but not offensive as it has been for me in other weizen beers.

72,224,counselor,3.7,"started out dark brown with a good head that thinned and left nice lacing through the glass (Authentic Aventinus galss at that). The smell was of nuts, cloves, and bannana. The tatse followed suit with layered flavors of butter, vanilla, and herbs. The mouthfeel was both thian and thick at times and sweet malt flavors swooshed around.  Overall it was an enjoyable beer that made me sit back and examine what was going on with the beer flavorwise, kinda mysterious - like as in what am I tasting here. Well balanced and fun to drink. I think as many people who drink it will describe it differently. A good beer to compare directly with someone else.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,oggg,4.5,"Tasted on tap at the Toronado bar in the Haight in San Francisco Served in a beautiful and curvy Aventinus glass.  The beer is dark dark brown and doesn't carry a lot of head.  Sweet malty smell, faint smell of hops  This beer has huge flavor but is so well done that it doesn't overwhelm you. The beginning is malty and chocolatey. You get that bready wheat taste along with a hint of banana and spice. Big mouthfeel. Alcohol is very subtle. I could drink pints and pints of this.  Seemed much more smooth and flavorful on tap than when I tried it in the bottle.  This beer is the king of dark wheat.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,francisweizen,4.62,"2000 Vintage, caved aged for 36 months in Aventinus' ice cave in Germany. The appearance is very similar, if not the same as regular Aventinus. A dark, yeasty, murky brown colour with a humungous tan/beige head of foam. If swirled or allowed to garner up a big head, the aromas of this are also very similar to the regular Aventinus. I smell cloves, various fruits and esters, slight spicy alcohol, a bit of malt, and very, very slight floral hops. The aromas are actually a bit more well integrated than the aromas of the regular Aventinus, but at the same time, they are also less pronounces/pungent and complex. The taste is more subdued than that wild-fresh Aventinus, but all of the same major flavor hints are still there. Slight bitter-sweet chocolate, dark fruits, german yeast, malt and hops, alcoholic spiciness, and spicy clove hints. The mouthfeel is a bit creamier and more smooth in the mouth than fresh Aventinus and the drinkability is excellent for an 8.0%ABV wheat beer. Please remember to serve this cool, not cold at cellar temperature, because this is were Aventinus is at it's best. Since these 99 and 2000 reserve bottles have been aged in an ice cave for 36 months, they should be served straight from you ice cave (ie: cellar) or brought up to cellar temp, by sitting in the fridge for 30-40 minutes.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,NearerMyBeerToMe,3.91,"Pours with a big, fizzy head of large, airy white bubbles that quickly dissipates into nothing at all! (BTW I had not cleaned my tasting glass with detergent, or a towel, so I'm at a loss as to why there's no head... what a downer!) The beer itself is well-carbonated, though, with plenty of streamers rising through a light-chestnut colored brew with highlights that border on amber. Immediately weizeny aroma up front, with the distinctive refreshing, near-citrus tartness; there follows a banana-bread mealiness in the middle; with toffee malt rounding out the back. Flavor is of clove and slight cinnamon; sour-wheaty with suggestions of bubblegum and melon in the midpalate with spicy clove; highlights of raisin and white grapes. And oh yeah, a lot more clove--so much that it almost borders on black pepper. If you don't like clove, then forget it. Mouthfeel is spicily dry, effervescent, champagney with more peppery tingle; yet somehow quenching in the back of the throat. This combination of spiciness and quenching character infers a high drinkability. I could drink this in session if I wasn't feeling the alcohol already... I might try this again to see if the ""appearance"" score goes up a bit, but for now let's just say I didn't get as much out of this beer as I had hoped.",Schneider Weisse G.

Nice cloudy nut brown color from the yeast. The nose was of raisins, bananas and cloves and very appetizing. Mouth feel was smooth and full and enveloped my tough with flavors. Big flavors of clove, banana, dried sweet fruits and sweet malt. It has a mild wheaty acidic and spicy bite in the end that really finishes nicely. Also some hints of port, vanilla and anise somehow all mixed in this incredible creation..  Overall a superb brew and even smoother and more refined after aging.",Schneider Weisse G.

Malt, caramel, cherry, chocolate, orange, grapefruit, peach, clove, cinnamon, and sugar. 8%ABV is well hidden. The mouthfeel was smooth and light, with mild carbonation. The finish was smooth, with malt sweetness predominant.  I can see why this is on the Top 50 list; it's got that perfect combination of well-blended, yet complex flavors. Prosit!",Schneider Weisse G.

Pours a murky dark brown (with a reddish tinge) with a towering tan head. Smell: rich vinuous character with sweet hints of bubblegum, some banana, and hint of alcohol. Taste is tangy champagne banana wheat bread. Acidic, yeasty, sour apples, some clove. Finish is wheat bitter with lingering banana yogurt and alcohol. Delicious. Big and uncompromising, yet utterly drinkable. I can only hope my brew turns out one third as good!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,AbePhroman,4.63,Bought a 1pt .9oz bottle for $2.49. Totally worth it for this amazing beer. This is one of my favorite brews of all time. It's not often that I give a 5 for taste but this one deserves every point. Poured a cloudy brown hue. Very nice fizzy head with good lacing. Very spicy smell. Can smell the wheat and malts right away. Tastes amazing. Not sure how anyone can give this less than a 4.5. I gave it a five. Wonderful weizenbock. Yummy malts and fruity spices. 8% is a decent amount of alcohol. Goes very well with almost any meal. Try it out. I'm sure you will enjoy it.,Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,tavernjef,4.18,"Reddish dark brown with a gem-like glow, substantially tall evenly bubbled light tan head, frothy topped and whipped with a few divets and little sparkly specks within the foam. Fades slowly to a heavy skim always present but very little lace sticking, most drips back in. Aroma is citrusy and spicy with mild lemon and orange zest mostly coming through, lighter wheat and malty sweetness, musty yeast, and clove spices engaged within. Taste is a total brigade derived from the smell, pretty sharp toned up front with a strong wheaty carbonation that grabs hold right away and sticks with ya the whole ride through. Middle strikes with a yeasty take and citrus zest of lemon and orange, carbonation finally settles out and leaves prickly notions of malted sweetness with some dark fruityness of banana and starfruit tangyness and spice that lingers with a light chewyness that smoothes it out some but that carbonation really stands out and adheres to your mouth. Quite a ride in the feel dept., lots of hold and carbonation that creates lots of those little burps at first but as it warms it mellows and becomes more gratifying. A pretty nice brew, seemingly one dimension in a way, but complex enough to keep interest and finding something new nearly every sip makes for a welcome experience and favorable enjoyment.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,HossMcGraw,4.07,"I would call this an Imperial Hefeweizen. Appearance is dark brown, much lighter than I was expecting for a doppelbock. Smell is a blast of wheat, spice, and alcohol. Nice. Taste is like a Hefeweizen on steroids, with a maltier presence as it warms. Very flavorful. Mouthfeel is a little too carbonated but otherwise pretty good. Drinkability is above average. Good beer, but doesn't seem like a doppel. Also very similar to Trois Pistoles.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,DagFishHead,4.5,"Appearance: Hazy, iced-tea, brown-amber body. Huge, frothy, light-tan head packed with bubbles eventually subsides but a 1/4"" refuses to give up. Lace is creamy and sticky. Smell: Initial wheat blast is quickly pierced by sweet caramel and toasted malts. Definite banana, nutmeg, clove, pear, tart apple. Taste: Initial wheat/yeast tartness is then balanced quite well by full malt sweetness. Finishes with a crisp citrus and hop/spice bitterness which still allows a muted sweet/tart to linger. Subtle alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel: Rich, slick maltiness, smooth wheat graininess. Carbonation is crisp and balances well with the malt's thickness. Drinkability: This will cause me to give even more wheat beers a try (big revelation for a stout guy). Straight high marks for a very balanced and enjoyable presentation.",Schneider Weisse G.

The body is a medium and appears a little murky. Carbonation light. Aroma, a fruity alcohol challenge. No winner. Taste has a spicy/fruit character to it. I pickup initially the taste of plum, backed by a shi(p)load of his fruity friends. Warm alcohol back is secondary but noticable.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,allboutbierge,3.93,"Much like a normal dunkelweizen, only with a tad more flavor and a little bit more alcohol.  Enjoyed in the festive enviroment of the Schneider Weiss tap house in Munich. Color was essentially that of any dunkel weiss, possibily with a slighter deeper brown color and more predominant orange hues. The head of the brew was extremely thick and long lasting. I bet I coudve floated a penny on the top of it (note-did not try). Flavor was particularly heavy in the aspects of bananas and even offered some notes of flat n/a apple cider. A very slight taste of alcohol could be tasted. Mouthfeel was extremely luxurious and thick. The strength of the flavors did however slightly detract from drinkability.",Schneider Weisse G.

Cloves, banana, various spices, dried herbs and slightest fruitiness. Deep stuff that is an absolute joy to 'swirl n sniff'.  The palate is extremely smooth. It just falls over the tounge and down the throat without a care in the world. Same flavours: cloves, spice, fruit, banana, wheat. A perfect match to the wonderful aromas.  This is like a super version of their hefe's. Wild stuff, throughly enjoyed it.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,SetarconeX,4.47,"Clove scent? In beer? How strange...  This is nothing like I thought it would be. I knew with the wheat, it wouldn't be as heavy as I'd usually expect from something claiming to be a Doppelbock, but it's really quite light. A light carmael, Pepsi cola color, with a fizz to match. Highly carbonated, watch yourself opening that bottle.  The taste, on the other hand, rests almost totally on the numberous spices which seem to have been added. Fruity, and yes, as the bottle says, it has a ""clovelike finish."" Quite cool.  Probably not the sort of thing I'd drink every day, but definately something which should be tried. Completely unique and enjoyable.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,PopeJonPaul,4.35,"This must be a rare case finding this stuff on tap - I just started getting Aventinus on tap at Mugs Alehouse in Brooklyn and I've never seen it tapped anywhere else before. I have to admit I prefer it on tap over bottled (though Aventinus Wheat is still one of my favorites in the bottle.) The color (deep brown) and flavor (fruity with a bit of cloves) are still excellent. I think the tap controls the carbonation better, cutting the head down, making it a bit heavier and giving it an even smoother mouthfeel and drinkability than the bottle. Feels a bit more like a 8.0 ABV beer on tap, and it will catch up to you after the second 16oz one, believe me.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Tastes sharp from the carbonation. There is some definite banana flavor in the finish. This beer is lightly sweet, has a light bit of astringency in the finish. the dark malt adds a richness to this beer, in combination with the yeast, it gives the beer dark fruit type flavors. This is like a richer, more chewy, fruitier older brother of a great Hefe-Weizen. All of the characteristics are here, just more so. My only complaint is that I wish it had finished with a slightly higher final gravity, a little more thickness & sweetness would have been ideal.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,HappyHourHero,3.88,"Nice thick foamy head, light tan in color, a little overcarbonated though. There's definitely some alcohol present in the aroma, mixed in with some yeast and banana. The liquid has a creamy brown color to it. The alcohol aroma carrys over into the taste, and ends up as a warm feeling in you belly. The taste is just a little bit sweet, with maybe a little caramelized banana in there. Strong, but smooth beer, maybe more of a fall beer than a summer one.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,Gump,3.61,"I hear this one is hard to find, so when I stumbled upon it at Surdyk's in Minneapolis I bought a couple bottles. Extreme head on first pour, eventually settles out. Color is like cloudy, dark, iced tea. Sweet and earthy taste at first sip.  Some sort of brown fruit taste. (not sure which.. plum, raisin, grape?) Imagine a box of apples and bananas that have started to ferment. That's the aroma ;)  Doesn't have the mouthfeel of my favorite wheats. Tingly carbonation holds out for the full bottle.  Gets better as it warms.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

I was lucky enough to sample a bottle of 1999 vintage Aventinus at the Olney Ale House in Olney, MD (more about them in the Beerfly section). I must say that this is one of the finest winter warmers or dessert beers that I have ever tasted. It pours with a deep opaque body with garnet undertones and is topped by a dense beige head that demands you to taste this beer. And oh what a taste it is! Starting with the ripe, fruity nose of plums and cloves that hints at the taste to follow. A velety mouthful of warm, fresh baked bread with definite chocolate undertones. Despite its high alcohol level, there is an almost indistiguishable amount of alcoholic bite. The beer lingers on the back of the palate with a hint of toffee and clove spiciness that perfectly balance the tast of this marvel. This beer is truly a maltsters dream!

72,224,gnaussea,4.12,"Pours a solid dark amber with a light head, the essence of any bock. When held up to the light the redness can really be shown, but in a medium lit room it is a very nice, not quite black amber. The most distinguishable characteristic of this beer is banana. It is overall fruity and quite sweet, but the banana overshadows all. Other flavors present are chocolate, cola nut, and apple. there is not initial hit to the pallete, rather the malt steadily accumulates, first with banana flavor, then trailing with the others. As it warms up the flavor changes noticably, becoming even sweeter and more balanced amongst the flavors. The mouthfeel is a bit more carbnated than most other dopplebocks, and I like it. Perhaps I'm partial to my celebrator, but this beer makes a great substitute for dopplebock when you need some variety.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Cloves, banana, caramel, fruitiness. A very pleasant beer. Thick and creamy mouthfeel. Taste is gentle, no overpowering cloves like some others in the family. Nice comfortable warmth from the alcohol.  Quite solid overall. Not something I could see drinking a ton of at a sitting, but delightful as a one off.",Schneider Weisse G.

The nose is full of life with , caramel, bananas, cloves and even a almost light tobacco. The taste is the nose times three.. All of the sences are hit with the fruity, spicy, and almost cola like sensations. The carbonation just lifts these onto the palate and makes the tongue dance with joy.. The mouthfeel is smooth and the carbonation keeps this from being to heavy.. This would be a great beer to through back if not for the fact that 3 or more will leave you hurting due to its ABV, which is not even noticable. An all time favourite. For a great treat drink this with Bananas foster for dessert!!! now if i could keep my wife from drinking half of my Tinus id be a happy boy.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,HonestWeightBeer,4.18,"Pours an opaque woody chocolate brown with an effervescent off white head that dissipates quickly, but hugs the edges of the surface, (and returns upon swirling). Small amount of yeast sediment on the bottom. The nose is classic wiezen, sweet and sour, yeasty . I don't know if I have the words to explain this beer, a complex flavor. Fruity (sour apple) and alcoholic esters. The yeast is prominent in the finish, as it should be, but the malt is balanced. Woody notes, maybe oak, reminds me a bit of scotch.  The mouthfeel is slick and full but medium body, made lighter by the carbonation throughout. As for drinkability, this beer is a great example of the style, easily one of the most complex and well balanced versions I've had. The sour notes overwhelm the alcohol,(until it warms) making it barely noticable, for a beer this strong, and this drinkable, a dangerous combination. If this is your first, get up yourself to get the second, it might hit you...  Notes; This is the first beer (of those I have not had) on the top 50 list that I went out and bought based on BA rank.

Aroma is not too strong, with a bit of clove to suppliment the general wheat beer breadish aroma. There is a fair amount of body and which I think comes from the wheat side of the brew but the finish owes more to the bock side. This is a fairly strong brew but the combination of characteristics diguises the alcohol and you would be tempted to make this a session brew which would be a mistake",Schneider Weisse G.

She poured it quite expertly into a Weihenstephan weisse glass and made sure to get all the little yeasties out of the bottle, too.  Appearance: A murky brown in color with a good thick offwhite head. Pretty decent lacing.  Smell: I could have stuck around and sniffing this baby all night, but there was a train to catch the next day. I caught candi sugars and molasses with a bit of banana. There were also some floral hops in the background. It was a nicely complex aroma.  Taste: Very sweet maltiness. The alcohol is not shy about making it's presence felt, either, but it doesn't smack you around like a red-headed stepchild. This beer reminded of whiskey at some points.  Mouthfeel: Man, this beer has got some junk in the trunk. There's some fries with that shake. Very full-bodied and rich.  Drinkability: I would definitely have one of these again.

There is almost no lacing left on the glass, despite the huge head. The smell is super malty and yeasty, and very full of clove spice. It smells like a dunkelweizen on steriods. The taste is also packed with malt and cloves, and also contains some fruity esters. There is a bit of yeast to the finish. The mouthfeel is very thick and super smooth.

Be sure to swirl the yeast at the bottom of the bottle--it's imperative. Smells of bread with Nutella; with hints of chocolate and vanilla and some spices, clove, sweet. Rich tastes of dough up front with sweet dark fruits in the middle smoothed by a banana flavor from the yeast and some cloves and a warming alcohol sensation on the finish. This beer is 8% abv?!

There is a definite carbonic bite in this one that somewhat detracts from the flavor. Very smooth clean finish with a hint of alcohol and a lot of clove and spicey esters. Mouthfeel is light despite the high alcohol. Drinkable as long as it is paired with the right foods or the right moods.

Filled my tall, proud weissbier glass with a hazy, deep brown color topped with a big bubbly beige head that faded quickly into a squirming, writhing, almost living cap kept alive by steady streams of bubbles rising from the depths.  Smell is a wonderful melange of bananas, cloves, brown sugar, caramel, prunes and light alcohol. The alcohol really made itself known after swirling the glass a bit.  Taste: Wow, that's damn good! Starts off with a yeasty, bready flavor followed and some light banana and clove, not as strong as in a Bavarian-style hefeweizen. The taste is sweet and is intensified by the caramel/brown sugar flavor and dried fruits. The alcohol is well hidden. You don't really taste, you just feel it as a faint warming sensation.  Feel is light-to-medium bodied and bubbly. A little too carbonated, maybe. It really wakes up the tongue.  This beer is incredibly drinkable save for the ABV %. I could keep on drinking this but I'd be whacked in short order. That said, this is an excellently crafted beer wholly worthy of the praises sung on its behalf by BA's in countless Forum threads.

72,224,IronDjinn,3.87,"Alright Mr. Aventinus Wheat Doppelbock, I could care less about your reputation and your clammering, twitching following. We've had something of a history together, and an abrasive one at that. Long ago, before I ever had a real job, I had my first sip of you right from the bottle before I figured things out (hey dunderhead, pour it into a glass, just like that Unibroue you once tried to drink out of the bottle!). You swore me off wheat ale, especially German wheat ales for years and years. The last time I tried you, a mere 4 months ago, and after many other multinational samplings, I described you to the waitress and my friends as similar to chewing on a wet IKEA throw-rug--yes, I am clever, and got points for creativity on that one. Oh, but ever since then I've been training, working hard, saying my prayers, taking my vitamins, watching the tapes over and over again, figuring things out. Oh yeah, I think I'm ready for you once again. Come over here tough guy...  You all know what the bottle looks like, I poured it out of that. It's a rather intimidating, yet somehwat appealing hazy (murky) deep mahogany colour, massive beige head on the pour, spilling over, bursting at the seams. But that soon fades away, leaving me to deal with the matter at hand. The nose is quite nice, never noticed it much before now, rather inviting. Spicy and rummy, hints of preserved fruit, like the jarred cherries my Baba used to make. Quite intense. Flavour is very similar. It's something I've yet to find the words for. Wet IKEA throw-rug is not it though, I stand corrected. Like spiced buttered rum mixed with fruit, and then that elusive special ingredient (oh yeah, banana, that's it!). Yeah, this is pretty good stuff. Not the cat's ass like everyone else makes it out to be, but not as bad as I first took it to be either. Not a big fan of the style, couldn't drink more than one in a sitting, but I'm willing to give it the respect it deserves. I'd rather have a Unibroue instead. I think I will...",Schneider Weisse G.

Raw sugar stands out to me, but there are also strong sticky caramel notes, bananas, and other ripe fruits. Well done.  Taste - This is a symphony of flavors. It is brewed in Munchen, Bayern, the home of great beer.  The dunkel weizen aspect is awesome, a hair sweeter than the standard. The carbonation is middling, the yeast deep, raw, and intricate to the flavor, and the dark, burnt taste is present but not porteresque. The huge sugars from the nose kick in as well, making this a mouthful.  The other half of the blend is the doppel bock. Here Aventinus shines as well. The burnt taste (different from the dunkles weizen flavors) is classic bock and, somehow, very distinctive from but not overpowering to the other aspects of the beer.  Together the myriad flavors add up to a smooth, most complex, slightly intoxicating (8.0 ABV) masterpiece. The Aventinus Wheat Doppelbock is an amazing accomplishment within the brewing industry. Ive never tasted anything like it.  Mouthfeel  A little off carbonation for a weitzen, but right on for a doppelbock. Its not perfect, but really good.  Drinkability  In Germany a case of beer consists of 20 bottles like this in a plastic milk bottle type of carrier, and they are ribbed for stacking on top of one another. Id like to have a walk-in cooler in my house and these things stacked to the ceiling. This went down exceptionally well.  Comments  I got down to the 39th review (high-low) before finding anything lower than a four (Im number 40). This is the real deal and not just my partialness to weitzens and bocks. Its incredible, and easily one of my favorite beers of all time.  Update: Reviewed 11/23/04 and raising the Mouthfeel from 4.0 to 4.5. This beer is utterly consistant from year to year.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,Loki,4.3,"Sampled from a 50cl bottle. A Wheat Doppelbock, hmmm what to expect from this? I have no idea what is in store. Let's find out.  It started by pouring a dark, hazy brown with a big beige head in the glass. Small bubbles and great lacing all around the glass.  Aromas of fruit, sweet malt, and biscuity dough waft from the glass. The scents become more prominant as it warms.  The taste is much like the smell. Something of a combination of a typical bavarian wheat beer and a doppelbock, much like the name would imply. Tastes of sweet malt, fruit, wheat, biscuit dough.  The mouthfeel was bubbly, carbonated, and light. The small bubbles tingle on the tongue and awaken the mouth. It finishes very clean and smooth. Hides the alcohol very well, barely detectible and helps balance the sweetness.  Another truly wonderful beer. Proving that once again this world is full of new tastes to be explored. Granted this one is quite old, but it was new to me!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,taez555,4.42,"This beer poured a huge white tan head with a translucent dark reddish brown body.  The nose was a lovely smell of cloves, spices, some slight chocoloate touches, slight phenol, yeast. Basically it smelled like a fresh german dunkel weis with a slight kick of alcohol.  The taste was very nice. Medium to full bodied. Lots of spice. Very carbonated. Lots of clove, some slight fruit. Banannas, prunes, some mellow soft chocolate and caramel. Very wheaty. Touches of yeast as well. Very very slight touch of bitterness. The alcohol is actually pretty scary. You really don't notice it's 8% at all.  Basically this beer is pure germany. I'm not sure if it's the high alcohol content or what, but this beer really tastes like a fresh wheat dunkel as if you're in Germany.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Taste: Sweet, thick malts predominantly characterized by notes of clove, banana, chocolate and ripe fruit. Full, smooth mouthfeel.  Notes: Absolutely beautiful. Ripe fruit characteristics begin to rage as beer warms.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BierManVA,4.12,"Most reviews I've read mention heavy banana. I must say that I smelled heavyclove in this beer. Other spices as well. Very little banana in mine. Maybe this is a difference between the bottle and draft.  A somewhat filling beer, I sampled this on an extremely hot day. Two half Liters were plenty. Smooth and refreshing, I was not dissatisfied.  An obvious favorite with beer drinkers, easy to see why.  John",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,ALEBOY,4.62,"Another wonderful brew from Schneider... Rich colouring, Beautiful head! Cloves and pepper with a slight amount of bannana on the nose. Taste was one of raisons and a slight choc/toffee flavour, this kept developing as the beers temperature changed until fruity bannana became evident in the taste as well as aroma.  A very drinkable beer, I would be happy with glass after glass.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,jcalabre,3.57,"I originally sampled this brew many moons ago. I am writing this review from my notes. This beer has a very nice, complex aroma when poured. It's nice frothy head dies down quickly. It's dark amber in color w/ a flavor of cloves w/ hints of banana. It's a nice beer, but for my taste, it's nothing too exciting. At $3US a bottle, I won't get it again, not that it's bad tasting, it doesn't justify the cost for me.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,hotstuff,2.62,"When poured into my glass, this beer poured a dark brown head with medium sized bubbles. The nose was that of clove and I could definitely taste the alcohol in this beer.

72,224,TripelJ,4.7,"Presentation: 500ml bottle poured into 500ml pilsner glass.  Appearance: A deep reddish bronze with a large fluffy tan head that dissappates quickly. Pretty opaque... only faint traces of light.  Aroma: Ripe bananas and some spices (clove?). Also, I detect a faint licorice aroma.  Taste: Sweet and malty up front with a nice warming effect from the alcohol. The cloves are coming through again as well as the faint hint of licorice. Finishes sweet--a warm cinnamon bun with raisins. *Update: The beer has warmed a bit and I'm picking up some delicate fruit flavors, raspberry in particular. The hops are also coming through more now that the temperature has risen to about 55-60 degrees F.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and creamy, chewy even. Warming from the alcohol, but not overwhelming.  Drinkability: Very good. I could have 2 or 3 pints of this in a session and enjoy each one all the more.  Overall: Highly anticipated, and now much respected, Aventinus is a legend well worth the hype. Dopplebocks are one of the most fascinating styles and this is an amazing interpretation of such. If you see it buy it, its that simple.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,moulefrite,4.1,"This beer would be fantastic late fall with a home-made apple pie, perhaps covered with some melted chedder, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This stuff is loaded with spicy apple/raisin, cinnimon, clove, and even a dusting of cocoa powder. The fruitiness is faint, while the waves of flavor attack with cheerful willingness, over and over again. A warmth from the alcohol is present throughout the experience with some noticeable heat on the palate. In addition, a near perfect bitterness keeps the beer in check. This is cool stuff, but after one I'm done for a while-kinda like cheese fries. The low drinkability reflects my personal idea of drinkability, which perhaps reflects the season In which I have sampled a particular beer. Drinkability to me means when I have finished (a fairly regulation size serving) drinking the beer, I say man, I'd really, really like to experience that again, and very soon at that!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,far333,3.72,"Pours a light mahogany color and is topped with a beige, fizzy head that runs away quickly. Nose is full and sweet, fruity and malty. Flavor is very rich and sweet, primarily of strong malt plus some plum highlights. A slight alcohol aftertaste lingers on. Very tasty and enjoyable, but perhaps a bit too rich to have high drinkability.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,TheDM,4,"This brew poured a nice dark brown pour with a very lively medium head full of medium sized bubbles. It has a very mild cloven aroma. The body contained some yeast residue floating in it. It's taste leaves a lasting impression on your tongue as it goes down. It has a very nice taste with a hint of raisin and at the top of my list, but not the very top. After a few drinks, the alcohol content really comes through.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,jreitman,4.5,"Initial aroma of apple cider eventually leads to aromas of wheat and a slight phenolic waft. Poured a reddish-brown in color with a nice head. Chocolate and dark fruit come out more as the beer warms. Caramel and dark fruit are the most dominant flavors. Spicy on the back of the tongue leaving a nice tang. Very nice. I wouldn't necessarily call it to style, but damn is it good.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Ellbert,4.55,"Apperance: Nice Dark Brown colour with and off white heat that sticks for a little bit. A nice lace.  Smell: A nice full smell. Smells of spices and a caramel smell also.  Taste: This definitely tastes great! Strong spice at the end. It is has a bite, definitely has an alcohol taste. Caramel is in there.  Mouthfeel: Leaves coating on the toungue. It is very smooth and rich.  A good brew, thick, rich, flavourful",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Popsinc,4.35,"Deep, dark brown pour with an enormous foamy head. Light hoppy nose with underlying hints of chocolate and plum. Lovely mouthfeel. Flavours of light, unsweetened chocolate, raisin, plum, a hint of banana and a spicey finish including some clove & nutmeg. Of course there is a noticeable alcohol kick on the finish. Very warm beer but yet not heavy. It stays light on the tongue and refreshes and yet is intense and complex in its flavours. A classic in my book.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,HardTarget,4.32,"500 ml bottle, no date Aroma: The banana smell of Weihenstephan yeast with the slightest hint of alcohol. Appearance: A dark, clear brown beer with a fine head of white that stays long into the beer. Flavor: Again, the primary taste is the Weihenstephan banana like yeast that fades into a rich, dark wheat malt aftertaste. A very rich tasting beer with a loooong aftertaste. Even my burps have that banana aroma (sorry, but they do). No real sign of the alcohol that was hinted at in the nose. Mouthfeel: The carbonation holds long into the beer. Some warming late into the beer, it is 8% after all. Overall: Very enjoyable example of the variety the reinheitsgebot purity law can offer. A well made, dark, rich beer that satisfies. You could drink more than one, but one scratched my beer itch. Highly recommended.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,sponberg,4.15,"Beer being reviewed: a 1998 bottle of Aventinus, stored at 53 degrees in its case in a dark basement, poured at cellar temperature into a 0.5l Aventinus glass. How does this one age? Let's find out...  Mahogany amber-red. The head starts out thick but quickly dissipates into a thin, rather highly carbonated bead. The aroma is redolent of yeast, with some toasted almond and estery notes along with a breadlike maltiness.  Interesting - I was expecting some cardboardy flavors, but instead I get a very toasty-sweet maltiness, with notes of coffee, cocoa, and background esteriness of clove and a little banana. Really fizzy mouthfeel, prickly on the tongue. Alcohol and an oily astringency also present. It's like the tongue gets three effects at once - prickly at the tip, oily in the middle, and astringency at the back. Let's let this warm up a bit... Hmm. The prickliness has died off a bit, leaving more esteriness, vanilla, and a hint of smokiness in its wake. The alcohol seems more apparent than on a fresh bottle as well.  Conclusion: Aging doesn't hurt, but doesn't increase the complexity or depth of flavor to as great a degree as I'd figured it would. Drink it fresh for best effect IMO - but if you have an aged bottle or two, it's still a wonderful brew.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,GreatPondBrewer,4.12,"Another pickup from beer mecca(see: Half Time beerfly). It had a fizzy, bubbly white head. It was a deep and cloudy leather color with tons of carbonation bubbles fizzing to the top. I liked this beer better than the Celebrator. It had a richer, more distinct aroma full of berry bouquets and a hearty yet refreshing wheat smell. The taste was yeasty and fizzy, but perfectly balanced with a bitter aftertaste, musty a damp like a piece of water logged wood. A hearty ammount of spiced, ginger etc. flavoring, but nothing artifucial. Kinda resembled an iced tea. Very good.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Indybeer,4.68,"500ml bottle. I am a big fan of Weizens, and this is my first taste of a doppelbock. Pours a dark brown with hints of red, with a nice head that slowly settles.

Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BigHead,4.5,"Me likey. The cloudy amber beer with a wonderful thick head, it's purdy. And the aroma is awesome, a fruity, spicy aroma mixed in the texture of hops and malt with a hint of ginger. The smooth fruity tang livens up the front of my tongue. There is a cranberry type feel amongst the array of hop, malt, and fruit. The spices of ginger and cinnamon are evident to me in this wonderful beer. A great brew.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,TAMU99,4.03,"Pours a rich dark brown clear/cloudy depending on your yeast tolerance (- swirling the bottom is best)  Smells of smoke and molasses waft from a medium tan head.  Taste is rich in the aforementioned smoke, touch of chocolate, a little cinammon and a heart flavor of molasses. Hearty, deep dark malt profile with a nice hoppy counter.  Feels very balanced, though thought was over carbonated with a few swigs.  Overall a very good beer. I really enjoyed this one.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,lipschitz,4.02,"Presentation: 500ml-bottle freshness date stamped on back.  Pours deep henna with a foaming white heat that wanes rather quickly, leaving minimal lace. The smell is rich with malt, and a strong herbal presence, while exotic fruit and alcohol esters make an appearance as well. The flavour is of complex malt sweetness, which touches on chocolate at times. A brief splash of fruit is followed with a citrus zing, with some hop bitterness finishing the feast. Mouthfeel is creamy, with the carbonation providing a champagne-like pep. Notes: Another remarkable offering from Schneider & Sohn. The high alcohol content gives an extra dimension than many wheats. That said, the alcohol really comes to the forefront as it warms. This is a delicious, boozy brew, but enjoying for a session might land unexpected results.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Gusler,4.12,"The beer pours a nebulous mahogany with orange highlights; the head is preposterous in size, the structure frothy, the color a medium tan. Nose has a bit or hint of the wheat grain. Mostly sweet malt, quite pleasing to the senses, start is ambrosial, nice malted grain profile with the top middling in feel. Finish has a crisp acidic bite, the hops subdued, the aftertaste dry and long lasting, a quite nice beer, as I have always been partial to the Bock sub-style.",Schneider Weisse G.

Aroma: Ester alcohol on a medium roasted malt and wheaty aroma. Taste: Initially plain flavor, that explodes into a rich milk chocolate and malted milk ball flavor. Mouthfeel: Amazingly rich and creamy. Drinkability: This is amazing. I could chug this, savor this, cherish this and love this.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,brewdlyhooked13,4.06,"Nice presentation, attractive bottle design with the royal-looking purple and gold label/lettering.  I poured this with a little too much elevation and before I knew it, I had a thunderhead threatening to go overboard, and yet I can never allow that to happen. (Tasty bubbles...)  Looks like a dark-brewed iced tea, has a malty, slightly yeasty aroma.  Solid mouthfeel, I like it, malt and fruit components up front, light chocolate blended with yeast on the finish.

72,224,dwarbi,4.38,"Really looks like a very good wheat, but the color of a brown ale. A little lighter than a brown, but not much. Looks like there's a storm inside the beer and the thick, seafoam head continues to grow long after being poured. Smells like cherries and berries. Fantastic taste -- very complex. Can taste some fruits and wheat, and it has the clean, refreshing finish of a wheat.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BierReise,4.08,This a Great Wheat Bock beer. Impressive compacted head that stays throughout and a malty ultra smooth flavor with nice yeasty tones overall. Hints of caramel and clove as it warms with a very slight sourness. The 8% ABV is obscured by it's full body and flavor. Another very impressive beer from Schneider.,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Sigmund,4.65,"My bottle (German) says Aventinus Weizenstarkbier (Italian: Birra Doppio Malto), but this must be the same thing (same ABV too). Theoretically I might encounter a better Weizen than this one, but I doubt very much that will ever happen. Murky brown colour, large head, aroma of Paradise: Cloves and other undefinable spices, dried fruits (figs), oak and sandalwood. Oaky cloves flavour with hints of burnt caramel. Alcohol is present, but not overwhelmingly so. Dry aftertaste. This is a thoroughly well made beer!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,WMBierguy,4.71,"I poured this beer into my special German drinking glass and watched the enourmous, delicious head foam up. After a minute or two the head dissapated and revealed a dark brown beer. The taste of this beer is pretty strong, like a super Hefe Weissen. It goes down smooth and, with an 8% alcohol content, gives a decent kick. I recommend this beer for anyone who enjoys Hefe weissens, or anyone who wants to enjoy a fine German beer. However, the average Corona drinker probably wouldn't appreciate it.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,aaronh,4.68,"Pours a dark caramel color with a thick, off white head. The head retention is tremendous, as it lasts seemingly forever. The aroma is roasted malt, bananas, clove, and a touch of alcohol. The taste is sweet and crisp, all at once. A great roasted taste is combined with a fruity, bready, yeasty component, all well balanced. A touch of bitterness is in the finish, along with the characteristic wheat crispness. The aftertaste brings to mind chocolate covered bananas, with just a hint of cloves. The mouthful is creamy, feeling sinful on the tongue. I think I could drink these all day long! I bought this particular bottle in November to celebrate a pending job (so I thought). I cracked it open tonight to celebrate a different job that was just finalized. Although I was expecting great things from this beer, it still surprised me. A must buy for any wheat beer lover.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BittRnessabounds,4.32,"This poured a brownish red with a small slightly tan head that managed to remain pretty well despite the fact that i did not give it much of a vigorous pour. I'll just have to try it again and pour with more energy. The smell was dominantly fruity and sweet, with a hint of yeast. I picked out apples and raisons, with a bit of caramel. It actually smelled a bit like a caramel apple to me, very pleasant. The taste was equally as pleasant, sweet and malty with a hint of caramel and fruit while also spicy and yeasty. Very complex smooth and tasty. Medium carbonation and body combine for a very good mouth feel, and smooth drinkabilty. I never got a sense of the 8%ABV. Overall a wonderful brew, and my first venture into the world of wheat ales or doppelbocks, but it will definitely not be my last.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,EmoBeerGuy,4.44,"This one poured with little head but I didn't give it quite a rigourous pour. The color is an amber brown, very similar to Chimay Red.  The nose is very strong and you can pick up on the hops, fruit notes (apples and raisons) as well has the the great yeast that goes into this brew. I had never had a doppelbock and I don't think this one was the best place to start beings as it was dominated by its yeast. Still, this is a great beer. A ton of complexity here, and also a very smooth brew. I compared it to Rare Vos (Ommegang) to my friends but pointed out that it managaes to be even more drinkable and smooth even with its greater alcohol content. Great beer!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BeerAngel,4.48,"Pours a dark murky brown color with a nice 2 finger off white very dense head. The aromas of light wheat and faint fruit delight the senses in a subtle way. The first swallow reveals a hop/carb bite that opens your eyes in sheer surprise. The flavors of wheat, smooth malts, cloves, and light spices start revealing themselves about midway through each swallow. The mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for such an array of flavors but it does not take much away from such a well-balanced complex brew! Very nice! Prosit!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,canucklehead,4.5,This is top shelf stuff that for me defines this style. I love the fruit cake like top notes that come off a glass of this stuff. The colour is a dark cloudy rummy shade of brown with a lot of Brussels lacing on the glass. The mouthfeel is biscuity and complex and as the beer warms up the great balance shows itself even more. If Germany had a beer war against Belgium this would be on the front lines. Ein Prosit.,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,AtLagerHeads,4.23,"Another great offering from Herr Schneider and Son. Good looking cloudy dark peach color with a decent head and great lacing. I really sense cloves in the wheat beers from this brewer and I like what I'm tasting. Somehow what doesn't sound that good to me does taste good.

72,224,MJR,4.44,"Appearance: Pours a wonderful color that is a combination of orange, red, and brown. It's fairly hazy from the wheat...no surprise there. The head is out of control to start with, but eventually shrinks down to a thin cap.  Smell: Aroma is a mix of clove, bubblegum, banana, malt, and yeast. Nothing unexpected, just a classic Weizenbock smell...  Taste: The flavor is tart with lots of Hefeweizen attributes: clove, banana...hell, just read the smell description! It's the same. There's plum, fig, and raison in there too, but they're minor players here. Very fruity and spicy. Alcohol shows up on the palate, but in a smooth way. It doesn't come across as harsh. Staying dead-on for style, there's no hop flavor to speak of. Overall, it's a bit heavy on the clove, but very nice...  Mouthfeel: Crisp and tart with a medium mouthfeel. Finishes with a slight alcoholic dryness.  Drinkability: Pretty good for an 8% brew. I couldn't make a night out of just this brew, as the alcohol flavor seems to get stronger as I make my way through the glass.  The classic example of the Weizenbock style...enough said!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Scooter77,4.45,"Pours a hazy, dark brown color with plum colored highlights and a lot of carbonation bubbles. The massive, fluffy off-white head presented itself immediately upon pouring. The froth died down incredibly slow, leaving a beautiful lace on the glass. The nose is very complex, there are so many things going on here. Every time I took a whiff, I smelled something different, bananas, cloves, alcohol, raisins, chocolate, and just a hint of nutmeg. The flavor knocked me off my feet, it matched the aroma perfectly. Initial taste was of sweet fruit, followed by a bit of hop bitterness, then the alcohol, and if that wasnt enough there was a spicy zing of cloves at the finish. The only mouthfeel complaint that I have is that there was a bit too much carbonation, it think it distracted me a little from tasting all the flavors that that this beer contained. This is one of the best dopplebocks that Ive had, and its very reasonably priced.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,nomad,4.8,"Poured an opaque with a very dark ruby color. It looks darker when you put it down, though. Beer had tons of little carbonation that built a giant symmetrical building of a head; it became more frothy and billowy as it settled. Lace was decent but a little hasty.  Nose, hmmm, nice... It was dominantly banana, cloves, and an apple-fig scent (smell was more apple than fig, though). You can immediately pick up on the beautiful yeast used alongside the faint yet nicely roasted wheat background. A wonderful nose, reminded me of fall harvest - though I had no problem drinking it in early spring.  Flavors were of a tasty roasted malt; a medium level roast that also seemed a bit spicy. Tasted also of raw cinnamon (the true taste, not the sugar-sweetened kind). This combined greatly with the most dominant flavor which was the cooked apples. The more yeast more poured in the more clovey it became, and combined with the apples, it became like a late fall bounty done well in the kitchen.  Had a moderate to short finish, with a subdued cream in the finish. Very quiet hops and sour were in the aftertaste and lingered with welcome on the appropriate buds. This beer is so unobtrusive yet still so hearty in both taste and aftertaste. There was some tingle on the tongue that helped to call me back, and the mouthfeel was sort of watery-oily. And from these notes, and everything else with it, this beer is so very drinkable. Compared to the other classic dopplebock, Celebrator, more fruity and spicy, and classic in its own right.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,UncleJimbo,4.33,"Sampled on tap at Redbones.  This wheat-doppelbock poured a cloudy brown color with a lot of light tan foam. The smell was very fruity (bananas), which surprised me for a doppelbock, but I suppose the wheat is responsible for these esters. The taste was also dominated by the fruity banana oils, but caramel malt, yeast, and a trace of musty grape flavor came through. The mouthfeel was sweet and fruity, with medium carbonation, and medium body. This bock was very drinkable (I guess I am a sucker for fruity esters).",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Admiraldinty,4.37,"A great brew. Pours a cloudy light-brown, like a doppelbock. Nose is fruity, with some banana, and yeasty. Flavor is fruity and a little spicy with some chocolate undertones. Clove finish. Medium-bodied with a tingly mouthfeel. Somewhat alcoholic. This is a great beer. Definitely warming. A little on the pricey side, but great once in a while.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Darkale,3.83,"An interesting beer.  Cloudy, red-brown, with an immediate citrus and spice aroma. The head is massive and immediate, but short-lived with little lacing.  Taste is citrus and a little hoppy, with a burn of spice and an edge of malt sweetness as it warms in your mouth. To me, the spice tastes like cinnamon. Slightly gritty mouthfeel, and yet it is not uncreamy at all. (Is uncreamy a word? Necessity is the mother of invention!)  It is necessary to pour twice from this beer if you are using a standard beer glass, since it comes in a 500 ml bottle. The explosive head contains bits of sediment; you can taste the beer in the head quite a bit better in the last pour.  The kind of beer that makes you say, ""Hmmm,"" after every sip. That's not a bad thing, but I don't think most of us would want to have more than one per night...",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,AudioGilz,3.9,"It's a very dark and murky brown color with a moderate tan head which leaves a nice coating. Aroma consists of raisins, bananas, faint alcohol....flavors in this beer are very much ripe fruit and faint alcohol as it warms. Quite an enjoyable and full-bodied brew. I don't think I could have more than one though.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Stubbie1,4.03,"Pours into the glass a dark copper color. A think off white head is next; the head turn into a nice lace to the bottom of the glass.  Aroma is malt, maybe raisins and cloves and the yeasty smell of a weissen bier.  Flavor has a bit of fruit notes and complements the aroma. It has a full taste and a bit of alcohol on the finish.  Over all a very good and enjoyable brew.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,SamuraiJack,4.33,"This is an astonishing and quite unique beer. Will, without a doubt, be a permanent addition to my buying patterns. On first pour, this is a deep, dark, cloudy and chocolatey brown. The head is dense that (slowly) fades to a creamy and sticky lace. Aromas are predominately fruit esthers with a strong burnt sugar and alcohol underpinning. Oddly enough, there is a nice tropical spice aroma that lurks under it all. Initial taste shows a bright and snappy carbonation with noticable alcohol and a nice, tropical-seeming, spice and caramel flavor. The mouth feel is super creamy but a bit too ""sticky"" to be truly excellent (IMHO). Finish has excellent wheat and yeast flavors with a final blast of crisp fruit/alchohol. This is an outrageous beer. To my taste and in my experience the best of its type.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,WVbeergeek,4.78,"A remarkable looking beer, this one poured into an official Aventinus wheat glass, with a very full head. Not only was the head nice and full, but as the beer sat the head expanded. It didn't bubble down to a thin layer, but it started to expand until it rose above the rim of the glass. I watched the beer for at least two minutes before I even took my first sip, it was just amazing how long the head was lasting, unlike any beer I have ever seen. The dark brown amber body complemented the creamy brown tone of the head so well. The sweetness in the aroma carrie wheat barley along the alcohol. The nose was like a sweet fig brandy with raisins to complement the complex full aroma. The yeast character from the banana esters were also detectable with in the scent of the beer. The lace formed perfectly and full as I sipped on this huge beer. It is so full bodied with a creamy thick and chewy mouthfeel, that this beer is a meal by itself. The same yeast flavors of the banana and clove is here with buttery notes of apples and raisins. A wonderful aftertaste full of malty goodness laced with alcohol on the tongue. I would love to enjoy this beer regularly, but too many of these put down could equal quite a mess with the high alcohol and full body these are meant to be enjoyed one at a time. I wish I could put more of these away, because it is amazing in every way.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BeerBuilder,4.17,"Ruby-brown in color with a minimal head. The aroma is of sweet malt, wheat, and somewhat clovey. The flavor is big and malty, with the hints of clove. It is medium bodied with an alcoholic finish. A smooth and drinkable German brew. I enjoyed this beer, and most definitely will drink this one again.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,marburg,4.7,"This was one of my two lunch beers today, and it's a classic that I've enjoyed many times -- this time in a bottle. Deep copper brown color -- like mahogany furniture or something, really. Head dissipates a bit faster than most wheat beers, but the aroma is strong. Raisinets and wheaty lemon zest. Tastes great as well. Someone put their Christmas gift basket of fruits and bittersweet chocolates in this beer. Wheat finish with a stronger malt presence up front. Overall a nice combination of flavors. Great beer. The vintage 1996 and 1999 are, to my recollection, even an improvement upon this.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,goz,3.78,"Pours a cloudy dark brown, with a huge, light-tan, puffy and cloud like head. Head slowly dimishes to a pretty strong lacing. Aroma is strong on the banana, with some clove sneaking in, too. Flavor is also strong on the banana, with some slight hints of chocolate, and ending with some clove and spiceyness. In the mouth, it has some tingly carbonation, and a tiny hint of alcohol as it gets warmer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,doho95fu,4.85,Glad I picked this one up. Big tan creamy head on a thick dark copper beer that is anything but clear. The foam sticks for a while and seriously feels like shaving cream. The beer smells fruity and spicy with clove and apple being most distinctive. Tastes are similar with banana and brown sugar or molasses flavors present. The carbonation is fine with great mouthfeel and this is an altogether extremely pleasing brew.,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Morris729,4.85,"Pours a brownish copper color with a huge foamy off-white colored head that eventually dissipates into a creamy and sticky lace. Nose is wonderful overripe banana, clove, and nutmeg with a touch of light caramel. Leaves me almost drooling to take a sip. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Taste is quite fruity with notes of sweet malts, spicy clove, molasses, and a mild alcohol bite that becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. A truly wonderful beer. Perhaps the finest Weizenbock Ive ever sampled.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,cretemixer,4.42,"Pours a deep chestnut with a highly carbonated off white head that fades fast to a thin carbonated layer. No lace to speak of. A wonderful fruity aroma, malt, mollasses, breadiness are all there too. Taste of raisins and cloves most prominent. Sweet with very little bitterness. Very malty. Carbonation is just right with a smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable considering the 8% abv.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,JohnnyDuvel,4.5,"I've always enjoyed a good dunkel-weizen, with the only drawback being a relatively low ABV. I also love a good doppelbock, but it's not a refreshing style of beer. Well, here's a great combination of the two. Refreshing, easy to drink, and plenty powerful! Pours large head (as to be expected), dark and creamy. The alcohol makes itself noticed, and the clovey-spiciness is prominent (along with the taste of banana). Overall, one of the absolute great beers. This is one of my regulars, and I've tried many other attempts at the style -no other comes close.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Sixpack595,3.63,"Pours a copper-orange with full tan head, that dissipates rapidly. I'm not a big fan of Wheat beers, and this is just a reminder why. I have tried it several times now, and I find it no better than drinkable. Way too fruity for my tastes, but it does improve as you go. Strong bannana and a bit of clove and raisin. A complex beer, if you enjoy the style you will likely find this a rewarding taste. I try to rate with the style in mind, otherwise this beer would have a very low rating from me. Its not the beer's fault I think the style tastes like ^%#@.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,proc,4.7,"What a fine, fine beer! I wasn't expecting to like this beer as much as I did. Complex doesn't begin to describe it. Pours out to a plum darkness in the glass with a light brown head that reminds you of brown sugar. The aroma is that of fruit. The taste. Man, the taste. Where to begin? Initially, there is a presence of nutmeg, cloves and banana, much like a regular wheat beer. But just when you think this is what you get, the beer transforms as it warms and the clove/banana taste leaves and a warm fruit taste of raisins takes over. A wonderful beer that truly hides the 8% ABV very well.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,avylover,4.92,"I've tried this one from the bottle too and the difference in taste/drinkability is tremendous! On tap this stuff has no business going down as easy as it does with an 8% abv and tons of taste. Cloudy orangish/brown with a nice head that dies quick..but who cares? This beer still tastes great down to the last sip! A welcome fruity taste but not overbearing by any means. Definitely bananas detected, some other slight tropical type fruit tastes. Has a slight alcohol bite to let you know what you're getting into, but really adds to the overall taste. Two twenty oz. glasses and you're feeling grand, but could easily drink many more. This is great year round and should be sought out by all!! Fantastic!!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,bierman2000,4.65,"As tasted in Munich, a wonderful, full-bodied Weizenbock. Very drinkable with a chocolaty aftertaste and very filling being that it is a Weizen. Alcohol is noticeable and makes an impact at the end of an 18 oz. glass. The beer is excellent alone or with dessert, mainly a sweeter one. Worth seeking out on draft in March in Germany.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,kunzbrew,4.6,"Pours the most sexy copper color with a red hightlight that really make you drool. The head that is poured doesnot stick around to long but the aromas make up for it. The citrus and many other fruity smells fill the nose with great pleasure. The slight smoked flavor and fruity malts are great tasting. This is the best of dopplebocks that I have ever had although the list is small this is the best. Oktoberfest here I come.  Cheers,  Mike",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,schrist275,2.58,"Here goes.another one down the hatch, a few more of these and I wont be able to judge a thing. Anyways, the head come in a shade of off-white that is often associated with cheap white walls. The bier color is..um.root beer candy brown. The aroma is that of a lemon/citrus hefe. Slightly off-colored from most hefe smells. It tastes like a burnt orange peel soaked in a light hefe-weizen. Brewed for the hefe lovers only, and not for the beginner hefe drinker.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,feloniousmonk,4.82,"Big off-white head, dark violet color. Chocolate aromas detected from arm's length, just after I poured it into it's own unique Aventinus glass, footed at the bottom, ballooning at the top. With a closer sniff, all kinds of things come spilling out of this aromatic cornucopia! Cloves, cocoa, anise, spices, dark fruits. Great malt, some sparkling hops, long, luxurious finish. A glorious balance between dark and light. More flavors leap to the imagination as I savor each sip...peppers, raisins, I search for other fruits, but I'll stick with grapes. Halfway through this 16.9 oz,. bottle the head has disappeared, but the flavor's still bursting through! Heavy, alcoholic, but remarkably drinkable, with spice and raisiny flavors standing triumphant. A unique creation, and one of the best sips I've ever put to my lips!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,RBorsato,4.97,"Brownish-red, bronze color with a moderate round tan head. Good carbonation throughout; be careful, my bottle gushed a bit upon opening. Spicy yeasty clove aroma with malty notes and light alcohol tones. A more complex flavor that I can only ramble to describe: vinous, fruity (raisins, figs), spicy clove character, with light alcohol tones. Medium-full bodied (leans full) but has a light airyness due to the carbonation.  Note: this beer was #8 in Stuart Kallen's ""The 50 Greatest Beers in the World""  [16.9 oz. for $2.99] and well worth every penny !!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,ElGuapo,4.25,"a dark cloudy brown color almost murky with a nice foamy head. yeast and spice jump straight to your nose before you even lean in for a good whiff.  very nice balance of yeast and wheat flavors dominate the beer. you get a constant sweet flavor that will warm you a little bit, but you will not get any of the alcohol flavor despite the 8%. tingly carbonation and a solid body that is nice and rich give it great consistency and a wonder to drink. this beer has a lot of flavor, and its complexity is truly remarkable. this is fine beer.",Schneider Weisse G.

72,224,beerguy101,4.26,"Dark brown color. Large creamy head. Malty spicy aroma with a touch of banana and clove. WOW. Big, bold beer.Banana and cloves moves to raisins, fruit, chocolate and citrus. Taste really grabs at you. Which is NOT a bad thing. Warming taste. Alcohol is evident, but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. NICE beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,IrishRedRock,4.1,"This is quite a tasty brew, one I have wanted to try for a while now since it has been in the top 10 for so long.  It pours a very cloudy deep brown, with a thick head atop, and the yeasty spice aroma hits you immediately. Very nice. Quite bubbly in the mouth, yet extremely pleasing to sip. The wheat flavor stands out, and the yeastiness is balanced well with a bit of a sweet, almost fruity flavor. Mild warming alcohol, but you would never know this was an 8% ABV beer. An excellent brew, I am glad to have finally imbibed this baby!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,mickeymac,4.1,It pours your basic brown with little head. The smell and taste are spicy with the characteristic bock flavors. The wheat does make for a bit of a departure from the typical dopplebock. It goes down well and is highly drinkable in spite of the 8% abv.,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,sprinkle,4.3,"This is not your regular Aventinus, its vintage dated by the brewery 1999. Great beer thats just a little smoother with age. All the details of the beer are the same nice creamy copper color, with nice frothy head. Classic bannana, clove nose but a little more subtle with age. Very drinkable, but the cost is also about double since they aged it.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Realale,3.33,"Gorgeous, rich mahogany color. Slight cloudiness, as yeast was swirled and poured into the class. Huge rocky beige head slooooooowly settles to the thinnest cap of foam.  Nose is nicely clovey, with a complex bready/malty base. Some fruitiness as well.  Goes a bit wrong in the mouth. The clove is there, although a bit strong, but the sweet malt is an almost over-whelming presence. Not enough bitterness to balance the too sweet palate, and the alcohol is apparent on the finish - always a turn-off for me. Perhaps an off-bottle, but I couldn't finish it. Based on reputation, I'd be willing to give it another shot, but this was disappointing.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Amdahl,4.82,"This beer pours a nice deep brown. This beer didnt have much in the way of head, most other times Ive had this beer I've gotten a nice layer of creamy head. The aromas are of fruit and caramel, but a hint of cloves can be picked up. This is defiantly a full-bodied beer. Chocolate and cloves dominate the flavor. I absolutely love this beer and it is a staple in my beer diet. Drinking more than 3 of these would bring me to my knees. The alcohol is not as present as some other beers that I have drank with similar alc./vol.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,DerKaiser,4.55,"Outstanding wheat beer. Absolutely outstanding and well deserving of its high BA status.  It pours a cloudy, walnut hue with a nice creamy head. The smell is heavy of clove, banana, and citrus. The taste - even better. Right off the top, I taste clove, banana, bubblegum, melon, and light citrus flavors. Spicy ripe plum in there towards the end, as well. In the background, there's roasted malts and a nice yeast flavor. The 8.0% abv carries these wonderful flavors all through the mouth and nose. Delicious and dangerously drinkable for such a strong beer.  This is one of the best wheat beers I've ever had and also one of the few BA top 20 beers that I feel actually deserves a higher ranking. I bought one of these to review, I should have bought four!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,CharlesRiver,4.61,"I have been waiting to try this beer as there has been so much talk about it. It pours a ruby brown color with a three finger off white head that lasts and lasts. The smell is typical of most Weizens with bananas and yeast coming through. This beer has a more complex flavor than most in this style. Plums, raisins & bananas are the flavors that I find come through. Very smooth in the finish. I would love to try this on tap!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,maxpower,4,"Pours a cloudy honey-brown color, crazy ass, foamy, clingy white head, nice lacing. Aroma of toffee and bananas, strong banana yeasty bubblegum flavor, some alcohol taste in the finish, a very good weizen bock.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Dogbrick,3.8,Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. Dark amber color with an off-white head. Nifty fruit aroma of grapes and raisins (same thing I guess). Complex flavor of fruits and malt. I am new to the Weizen Bock genre but this was good!,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,AtrumAnimus,4.92,"This is a true artisan beer and a coup for Shneider Weise. If you like wheat beers or Dopple Bocks give this a try. I found using a belgian ale style glass better and more staisfying than the typical Pilsner glass. Fruity aroma, smooth and somewhat creamy head. Fantastic and satisfying flavor. Great before, during and after a meal. I recommend large thick pork chops with apple sauce or leg of Lamb and Jalepeno Jelly. Or if you like Corsendonk - try this as a finishing beer.  Little know fact: Schneirer Weisse also makes a distilled liquor from this brew called Aventinus Elderbrand (Noble Fire) waiting for a shipment from Germany to try this though - next week. Just got confirmation on it. I will add a review for that after we try it.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,putnam,4.2,"Tasted single-blind with Bajuvator and Korbinian (qv.) Medium to dark-brown like a Palo Cortado. There is the typical mashed bananas and cloves of a Wheat with the addition of cocoa on the nose. Good intensity. On the palate it displays very subdued acidity and bitterness. Not quite enough, in my opinion, to drive the flavors. These include mocha, mexican pastry and sweet spices on a clean, pillowy foundation. The finish is rather quick, again, because there is very little thrust provided by any bitterness or tartness. A well-executed beer, but a tad boring for me. For those who desire softness, there may be nothing better. __________________________  1999 Library Release: Tasted 12-27--02. Aromas of clay, terracotta, wet rugs, cola, vanilla, fresh plum, very complex and subtle. Not having another, ""fresh"" Aventius to compare it to, I opened another ""aged"" beer, St. Georgen Kellerbier. The latter seemed to wear its age more gracefully, with plenty of lively flavor. I'm sure it's a difference of tank vs. bottle age as well.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,TheLongBeachBum,4.07,"An Englishman, who loves Belgium beer, drinking his first bottled German beer, in America, hmmm I think I picked a rather good one to start with as well. Hoodwinked into the purchase by a very regal looking purple, gold and red label (the other German bottle labels nearby looked staid and boring). The label has a picture of some ancient looking chap that resembles a genetic cross between an archetypal Hamish Gent and the pictures of Christopher Columbus I remember from my school day history text books. Enough drivel. It poured well into my Erdinger Weißbier glass (is this appropriate I wonder?), the tall glass did appear to suit the beer rather well, and showed off a lovely deep drown color, extremely clear. The head started well, a lovely off-white creamy smooth head but it retreated far too quickly to a thin collar for my liking, and was a tad disappointing. I found I preferred drinking the beer through the head, and constant replenishment of the contents of my glass from the remainder in the bottle helped to maintain a head to some degree. But rather annoying after a while though, perhaps the draft is better. Yeast is really prevalent in the nose, coupled with a fruity twang mixed with rum punch and a hint of malt sweetness. The beer has a very appetizing and soothing introduction, and immediately puts the imbiber at rest. No shocks here, just a well-balanced beer that is clearly thought out. A thick mouthfeel with a mild cough syrup introduction, brown sugar, caramel, molasses and malt sweetness in the middle. A strong hint of bananas is there as well, which lasts through to the end. I got some milk chocolate and wet straw at times? Weird. All this, 8% ABV and highly drinkable. Detractions are that I find the sweet cloyness at the end, that lingers long after the beer has gone, just a little bit disconcerting though. Maybe I will come to appreciate it better as I drink other versions of this style. The lack of a head really annoyed me the most to be honest. That said, I have a feeling that Aventinus is the Led Zeppelin of beers, you come to understand and appreciate it the more you drink it. I need to see it play live (at the Bar in Deutschland preferably) to really appreciate this beer I feel. Nonetheless, a damn fine beer. I just know I am going to enjoy my Suarez into the world of German beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

Tuesday night special; wings. Beer to go with that; a Wheat Doppelback. I never put the two together. Pours a dark brown with the usual high off white head that lasts through the glass. Aromas of the usual Hefe- but with a more pronounced malt nose, not the usual banana/clove. An excelent beer with the meal I was having, thirst quenching. I will try it again without the meal.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

The smell is very diverse with notes of clove, yeast, bananas, perhaps some chocolate and caramel, as well. Taste is similar, but is more on the malty side with some spiciness tied in. Tastes rather sweet, with that caramel and/or chocolate malt taking priority. Very tasty. It's all accompanied by a solid, smooth mouthfeel.

Head is a tan with firm small dense bubbles leaving lace all along the side of the glass as the liquid is consumed.  Nose of toasted wheat malt with burnt barley malt and alcohol. Palate is tart wheat, sweet burnt malt, and clove, with a pleasant but sticky sweet fig after taste.  Tasty with a pronounced sweet desert characteristic, Aventinus Wheat-Doppelbock is a major wheat Ale.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,hyuga,4.55,"Deep, dark chocolate color with cloudiness that you can see in the edges. Foamy, light tan head that is very active from the heavy carbonation caused by the yeast. Strong yeast character in the nose, a bit sour, almost like vinegar. Fruity and malty undertones are also noticeable. As it journeys to your palate, you find a very spicy dried fruit character with an underlying chocolate maltiness, and then a unique spicy finish, which the bottle describes as ""clove-like"". A smooth, yet exciting mouthfeel from the carbonation and spiciness. This reminds me of a Belgian tripel in many ways. This is excellent! I didn't know what to expect from it, but I got quite a pleasant surprise. A very complex brew that intrigues your palate and makes your taste buds dance for joy!",Schneider Weisse G.

Well carbonated but slips down with ease, creamy and very full mouthfeel. Slight hint of alcohol (rum) with spicy and fruity flavors. In the end, the flavors are very well balanced and plentiful. Thankfully, it comes in the larger 500ml bottle, and I get the chance to have a generous second pour into the glass.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,bditty187,4.47,"Royal.  Aventinus Wheat Doppelbock has a white head & brown body. The nose was warm alcohol, liquorish, fruit, yeast, and clove. It tasted exactly the same with an added punch of maltiness for a well-rounded taste. This is one powerful beer and when it slides over your tongue, it tickles and stimulates at the same time. This is a wheat beer on steroids. With 8% alcohol by volume, Aventinus Wheat Doppelbock is rather masculine. It is a notch above any other wheat beer variant I have had.  Drinkability is only 3.5 because while I was very satisfied after I finished it, I did not need another one (right away). Maybe it was too damn delicious for me to handle.",Schneider Weisse G.

At 8% alcohol, this is definitely a strong beer, but the alcohol doesn't overpower the complex fruity malt flavors. Virtually no hop bitterness. Overall, an outstanding doppelbock.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,yen157,4.28,Malty and deep with just the right amount of spiciness. Lighter than one would expect just by looking at it because of the relatively high (8%) alcohol.

I can only imagine that I a) got a bad bottle or b) have different tastes in beer now. It pours a cloudy brown, with an impressive and persistent tan head. The aroma is a beautiful mix of banana, clove, and caramel. Flavor is quite complex, with clove, fig, caramel, and a touch of banana. Has a full body with medium carbonation, that makes for a very smooth and refreshing finish.

It poured with a dark chocolate color with tiny tan bubbles. Smell was that of a rich port, but with some citrus notes. The taste is truly overwhelming- massive amount of malt with a slight tang of cloves and figs or some other dried fruit was predominant. Filled up my mouth and my tastebuds. You cannot drink another beer after this one, and frankly, I'm not sure you can have two of these in the same sitting.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,Brent,4,"An interesting beer - my first wheat doppelbock, so I don't have a standard by which to judge this. Very pleasant clove aroma and flavor from the yeast. Less malty than most doppelbocks, but more body than most weizen styles. Alcohol is a noteworthy flavoring component, lending some pepper to the finish, with some rum-like notes. I'm not sure I'm quite as taken with this beer as my fellow BA's, but a tasty beer, without question.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,aracauna,4.3,"Dark reddish brown, like strong cloudy tea. Easy head had fairly large, soda-like bubbles form the head, but without the fizziness. As for taste, it's got the same strong esteriness of the Schneider weisse with the richer slight caramelly taste from the darker malts. Finishes with cloves. Tasty.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Murph,4.8,The brew was a dark amber/ruby color with a nice yeasty haziness and a good creamy head that fades slowly. The smell was sweet with tons of fruitiness and some nice biscuity yeast. The flavor starts off with some nice sweet/tart vinous fruity flavors with some definite banana qualities and some raisins as well. There is some yeasty biscuity/bready flavors as well as a nice warming alcohol glow. The brew was very smooth and creamy and had the trademark full mouthfeel of the unfiltered wheat beers. For the strength of this brew it was amazingly drinkable. I could see myself putting away a lot of these and being very happy to do so.,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BitteBier,4.65,"Pours with cloudy, dark tones that hint at the dark flavors that round out the taste. Ripe, fruity (banana?) aromas are inviting but are only part of the full flavor profile, which starts wonderfully crisp and finishes with a dark, full flavor. Exceptional mouthfeel. I can't imagine drinking tons of this, but I also can't imagine liking too many beers more than I like this one.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,WilliamPhilaPa,4.8,"Nice light brown / dark copper color, bit foggy / hazy. Very nice creamy head. The aroma is a fruity / banana and yeast. The taste is fruity, sweet taste; hints of bananas and cloves, touch of caramel, and some raison notes in there as well. I thought it was balanced to near perfection. Overall a excellent brew! Enjoyed this at Ludwigs Garten (in Philly) with the Bierman9 & Artied2.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,frank4sail,4.16,"Light brown hazy look with a slightly tan head. Unbelievible lasting head. Sweet nose with a touch of warmth up there where the nose hair grows. At first taste you get a sweet wheat malt tongue followed by a warm comforting bitter dark chocolate finish. Very smooth full bodied beer. This beer would be a great ""winter wheat"" selection. Don't get me wrong I would drink it any time....  I am glad I tried it due to other ""BA's"" ranking it quite high. Nicely drinkable at 8% abv.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,usualpulp,4.23,"This is one excellent brew. It pours a very dark brown almost black color, with a tan head that quickly dissapates. Upon smelling the beer, you can smell a strong carmel and malt presence, as well as alcohol. The first sip is pure heaven, very smooth and refreshing. There are slight fruit flavors and alot of spice. One might also notice a very very slight chocolate flavor. Overall this is one very smooth beer, and very strong at the same time.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,marc77,4.77,"The garnet hued, slightly chill - hazed bubbly brew is topped by a dense, creamy and smooth off - white head. The combination of banana esters, toasty munich malt, subtle chocolately notes and dark caramel is reminescent of a banana split topped with chocolate syrup and roasted pine nuts. The overall flavor is incredibly smooth, sweet and is comprised of a fine melange of wheat tartness and residual and caramel malt sweetness... The fruitiness from the yeast adds complexity yet doesn't detract from the mellow chocolate notes. Full in body and quite rich, but there is nothing cloying overall at all in this fine brew. Flavorwise, this brew truly exhibits a fine balance between the rich, melanoidin qualities of a doppelbock and the lighter yet complex fruity notes of a German wheat. The finish is sweet, a bit tart, but an enjoyable dark Munich malt toastiness lingers. Smooth, satisifying, alcohol warmth coats the throat several seconds after the sip is done. Aventinus Wheat Doppelbock is an absolutely rich, delicious, yet highly drinkable brew.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BeerManDan,5,"Absolutely heaven. The taste of banana's and clove's are well balanced. I have never tasted a wheat dopplebock like this. First impression was like tasting heaven, smooooth and velvety. Absolutely the best wheat dobblebock I've tried this decade. Everytime I've tried it, it's still number one.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Suds,4.49,"This is a wonderful beer. The aroma is an experience in itself. Over-the-top Yeast, clove, spice, banana: Extreme Weiss. The beer has a soft, dark brown color with a huge tan head that lasts through the bottom of the glass. Smooth, velvety mouthfeel. Not much alcohol taste despite the 8%, but there is a nice warming effect. I loved every sip of this one.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,DarthMalt,3.06,"7/17/02 What's the deal with making dark wheat beers? Aren't they supposed to be light and refreshing? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CAVEAT: Not my Style  Translucent amber, with a quick, foam-rubber looking head. Tart clove nose with a deep alcohol scent, kind of reminds me of Chimay Belgians.  Definite wood tones in the mid-taste, tangy throughout, and finishes on the dry side.  Good Beer. I could live on it.  Who's the monk-looking dude?",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Longstaff,4.88,"The pinnacle of wheat beers. This classic became a favorite of mine since my first sip over a year ago and still is. Head froths up even with a gentle pour and is hard to contain in the glass. Delicate brownish color and hints of banana fruitiness in the nose. Banana-clove, chocolate, caramel, and alcohol flavors all mingle together and is offset with just the right amounts of hops to subdue the sweetness of the malt. Has a creamy mouthfeel from the yeast and is much easier to drink than the 8% abv suggests. IMO, the world's greatest beer.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,inebrius,4.97,"Looks like a pilsener shaped tootsie roll with a bone white beard in the glass. A cream puff doused in a pear and brandy sauce might smell something like Aventinus. Still a hefeweiss, but a hefeweiss with a serious malt base. The malt is kept in check with bittering hops while the typical hefe lip-smacking tartness asserts itself by stepping all over spicy clove toes. A myriad of flavors compound to make this one outstanding brew. If you like hefeweissbiers, than I beseech you, try an Aventinus.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,jackndan,3.72,"Weiss Doppelbock: Good looking, nice smelling, but man that Weiss/yeast flavor is over the top. It was just too much for me, as I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the style, but if you are, this is the one to go to. It is the Weiss beer on steroids.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,mophie,4.87,"Man oh man, what a treat. First off, I love the look: deep caramel, almost brown with an orange tinge, and yeasty cloudiness. Nice, foamy off-white head that dissipates a bit quickly. The smell is unique, not quite a weisse, and not quite a doppel. I swear it smells like a cross between a weisse, a doppel, and, of all things, a Belgian dubbel. Huge fruity flavors, banana and raisins and tropical fruits, with the traditional wheaty clove finish. Quite a bit more tang than a doppel bock! Carbonation is also reminiscent of a Belgian more so than a traditional weisse or doppel due to the bottle fermentation. Despite the 8% abv, I find this to be incredibly drinkable, and not just in cooler temps, either!",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Bighuge,4.48,"A chill-hazed amber-orange appearance with carbonation evident. Very nice clove and nutmeg on the nose. Tangy wheat malt aroma also present. What strikes me on first tasting are 2 things: One, this is a very easy drinking beer foe 8% a/v. Two, this isn't overly sweet like I was expecting. On the buds, you get some of your typical weizen characteristics: Phenol, Clove, Vanilla and Banana. The phenolic character is really kept in check nicely. Must be some nice hopping in this brew to keep what could be a very sweet beer (and style) from becoming too sweet. Was surprised I never tasted the alcohol in this one. Great brew.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,ADR,4.37,"Dark caramel color, medium bubbled thick head that is charged from bottle fermentation. Slightly marmalade and malty aroma. Nice smell...Deep maple, raisins, and spice flavors, fades just about perfectly. Just a touch of wheat acidity. Nice medium body that's not at all sticky. Finishes as diminished spicy and raisiny, not cloying, adding to drinkability. Dang fine brew here.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,budgood1,4.85,"amazing. pours out an off brown, and after you work up the yeast, it turns a more milky dark tan. the nose is unbelievable...ripe fruit, ripe bananas, clove, some caramel and chocolate malt. an intoxicating wine like aroma to adds to the sensory overload. taste is of caramel apples, with prune, plum, banana and clove on top of a slick, buttery mouthfeel. the addition of all the yeast really expands the taste. some light spicy hops to add an ending crispness. you have reached german beer nirvana. the best of both worlds in a bock and wheat. a perfect selection for the first warm days of spring. outstanding.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,StevieW,4.66,"This beer really impressed me. Dark amber brown with a big white foamy head. Thick rich taste and feel for a wheat. Heavy yeast flavor, almost chewy, but delicious. Hints of roasted malt and nutty as well. Is there brown sugar in this ? It tasted great. 8% ABV warms you quickly, but easy to drink. 1/2 hour after drinking, I was wishing for more. I only had one bottle, comes in a basic brown bottle with a purple label. A beer worthy of a national championship game or a holiday meal !",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,ZAP,4.97,"Reminds me a lot of the Hacker Pschorr Weiss Dark that is my favorite summer brew....Really charged up on the pour..bubbly head settles down quickly....The aroma is what I would expect of a dark wheat...banana, cloves...citrus..brown and cloudy in color, this is one tasty beverage...sweet and fruity...plums..banana's...oranges...covered in brown sugar...an excellent beer. One of the finest I have tasted for this style.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,Bierman9,4.7,"On-tap review from recent München trip - 11OCT02. I had a few of these on tap at the Weisses Brauhaus in Munchen...ooooh baby!! Poured a cloudy brown, with a huge, whipped head which lasts all night. Nose has clove, yeast, banana, chocolate...oh baby! Body is medium, and it's much smoother on the tongue from the tap than the bottled-version. Flavors produced are more clove, yeast, banana, chocolate, some malt and even a hint of raisins! Has an oh-so-smooth finish. Superb!! A huge Prosit for this one!!!!  overall: 4.7 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | mouthfeel: 4.5 | drinkability: 4.5  *** ***  Bottle review of 02MAR02: This is a real nice one!! Pretty tawny russet-brown color, a touch hazy if you swirl the yeasties in (I do!). Sizable, fine, creamy tan head sticks around a bit, leaving nice lacework!. Nose is an appetizing, fruity banana-yeasty nose, with clove and chocolate as well. Nice fruity, sweet taste; bananas and cloves are evident. Has nice body, but I wish it were just a tad less carbonated...a bit prickly on the tongue. All-in-all a very pleasurable bier! (4.5/4.5/4.5/4.0/4.5 = 4.45) Prosit!!  63",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,hooligan,3.57,"Thick head with lacy bubbles on a hazy caramel colored beer. Strong straw-like yeasty smell, laced with plums, banana, and rum-alcohol. Thick and syrupy on the palate, with a strong earth yeast character, rich sugary plum, and heavy alcohol. Almost no bitterness of hops. Thick on the mouth, with a near perfect carbonation. All in all, perhaps a little sweet for me, a very very good beer, but a tad sweet.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,pbrian,4.87,Every time I have this I wonder why I don't stock it more often. Simply a world classic. Take all the properties of your favorite dunkel and combine them with your favorite bock and you'll get close to Aventinus.,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,rastaman,4.6,"fantastic beer, great drinkability, especially for a winters night, fantastic drop, lots of banana, clove, chocolate and even a bit of spice and some dark fruit, moderately acidic bitter finish, pretty good stuff.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96

72,224,mattmaples,4.9,A wondrous spicy / fruity dark wheat. If I want wheat I would go for this beer every time.,Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BKotch,4.47,"Are there any others like it? Banana, clove, bubble gum -- all the classic weisse flavors -- plus caramel and a strong alcohol kick. Very effervescent. This is the original weizenbock and it's still the champ. At least, I think it is -- what's with Schneider's relabeling of all their beers with the Tap numbers? Regardless, I love it.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
72,224,BeerAdvocate,4.27,"Presentation: 1 pint plus .9 fl. oz. tapered bottle with a cool purple, gold and white label. ""Germany's Original Wheat-Doppelbock, Ale."" No freshness date seen.  Appearance: Comparable colour to a Double Bock though even deeper and thicker shades of brown from the cloudiness, thin off white lace that has a creamy look to it.  Smell: Ripe fruit is dominant with caramel undertones, almost rum like. Soft spicy clove with hints of caramelized plantains, alcoholic esters are noticeable.  Taste: Mildly crisp carbonation from a stiff pour into the glass, creamy and syrupy thick mouth feel within the full body. Snappy and tingling, parading a clean bite from some spicy clove and sweetish alcohol that leans toward a fruity rum character. Hop bitterness is minute as well as the flavour. Gentle hints of chocolate and chicory and to the complex flavour, finish cleans up a bit from the warming alcohol, nutty yeast and husky grain.  Notes: A massive wheat brew that is unsurpassed by any other of its kind. Unpasteurized, unfiltered, top fermented and original bottle fermentation. The yeast in this brew, make the brew. After pouring, there was enough yeast to begin propagation. This is by far one of the best bock beers tasted to date.",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn,Germany,Weizenbock,96
