140,2671,Beer_aenima7,3.6,It has that distinct sierra Nevada skunkiness. A little more dark amber than their infamous IPAs. Currently cellaring mine to see what the age brings,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Qu3st,3.71,"2015 and stored with zero skill, will it survive? L: Dark brown with respectable tan foam. S: Light sour notes dominate, soy sauce on the end. T: Brown bread crust, hint of anise, treacle, cigar leaves. No burn left. F: A little slippery but still good to go. O: I think I caught this at the top of it's age, though possibly a year late.

140,2671,Rube-Riley,4.3,"2023 Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Barleywine - Nice tan head , amber body,great bready sweet aroma + sweet Carmel with a bitter finish taste 9.6% hidden well Going to start pulling my older vintages to compare",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,LeRose,4.32,"Initially poured pretty clear, but it certainly has some cloudiness to it. Kind of a deep amber coppery reddish color with a short khaki head. Said head becomes a chunky cap that persists and sticks handsomely to the glass.  The smell is not the malt assault I expected. It's there for sure - but it's more of an overall intensity that impresses. Grapefruit, pine-like resin, floral, fruit, caramel, and hefty whiff of unhidden alcohol. Yeah...I'm gonna dig this!  I can't explain it, but to me this beer is intensely flavored and mellow at the same time. It's an onslaught initially - fruity, bready, sweet, bitter, grapefruit in spades, caramel or toffee, a bite from the alcohol. The pine resin ramps up at the end, and there's a bitterness that almost resets the pallet, but not quite as the other flavors linger. It's a flavor blast, but it peaks quickly and all the disparate flavors build into the whole - starts all wild and jagged but melds together nicely and tames itself.  Feel is full-bodied, low carbonation. A bit of lingering pine and bitterness. A bit sticky on the lips, tingly finish.  Overall - I fully get the hype and love for this beer. There is just so much going on and it is incredibly intense.This beer strikes me as an exercise in excess, and if they keep making it I will buy it as an annual treat.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Braunmeister_1943,4.16,I have not had Bigfoot in quite a while. I’m seeing less of SN products at my local distributors which I find frustrating. This batch I found at Wegmans supermarket of all places! At $13.99/6 pack I couldn’t pass it up!  L- beautiful deep amber/reddish color.  S- very faint malt aroma.  T- Strong malt and hop flavors. Very slight hint of raisins and fig.  F- Crisp and dry with extremely fine carbonation.  O- Very good. This will age nicely!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,DCH,4.48,"The legend that is this beer lives up to all of the hype. Arguably the best in the style, it pours a dark amber color with a two finger head of foam. Smell is a resinous hop note combined with a toasted barely and slight grapefruit. Taste is similar to an IPA with just a more robust malt note, drying aftertaste. The high abv is hidden until that aftertaste displays it’s prominence.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,DumbRunner26,4.69,I look forward to it’s release every year. Dark brown in color with a foamy head. Looks good but the appearance doesn’t stand out compared to some other attractive beers. The aroma is where this beer thrives. How can a big malt bomb smell like a flower garden. Taste like fresh baked sweet bread. Mouth feel is thick and full. The flavor coats the mouth and says enjoy me some more. Truely an outstanding beer that deserves it’s cult following.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Drazdi,4.23,"Pours dark, with light tan foamy head (1/3""). Carmel, resin and pitch pine. Warm, smooth but slighlt acrid on tip of tongue. Aroma or raisin and fig, with subtle fall/winter holiday notes. Meant to sip or share. I have difficulty drinking a full bottle as it is wholly satisfying at 8-9oz so perhaps share 2 bottle with 2-3 friends. I enjoy this beer more if I have 1-2 drinks first, something sweet, roasted barley malt.  Sierra Nevada hit a homer with this one back in 1983 and I hope to find it years to come.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,LucidoMMA,4.34,"Pours an amber color with a very retentive head  Smells very yeasty and malty.  Taste is a brilliant mix of bittersweet malts, hops, and grains. Leaves significant lacing and a nice bitter clean finish",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,VashonGuy,4.11,"I've had Bigfoot many times over the years. I hadn't realized I never reviewed it. This time, I'm drinking the 2020 version, roughly 3 years after its release. I usually buy a six pack and let it age for a couple of years, as I've found that I like Bigfoot with at least a couple of years of age on it. I think it's mellower, with the flavors better blended.  The strengths of Bigfoot are the smell and taste. It's really a strong ale, with plenty of bitterness, laid over a malty base. Emphasis on the bitterness, which to me is a good thing.  I'm a big fan of English barleywines, which have all the subtlety that Bigfoot lacks. The English barleywines have little in common with Bigfoot, except maybe the fairly high ABV. Two completely different experiences. I'll drink several English barleywines every year, but I'll always have one six pack of Bigfoot, with a couple of years age on it. Good stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,RaulMondesi,3.23,"Pretty bummed on this one. It’s like buying a ticket to see Babe Ruth play, but he was too hungover or in jail or something and not in the starting line up. Right from the start, I detected syrup in the aroma; and then what do you know? Leggo my Eggo - syrup on my palate too.  Well, you win some. You lose some. And right here I’m becoming ambivalent as it warms. Wait…  Yeah, not much. Still a big dollop of syrup in the aroma, but it has died down a bit in taste. Still nothing to call your mama about.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,Rambo111,4.16,"This beer is not meant as a session ale. I buy it once a year as a treat, and this year in 2022 it is exceptional! I get a clean head, with well balanced pine and tropical fruit for the body. The finish is bread flavors and a warming effect; this beer is complex in flavor and feel. I’d recommend this one for connoisseurs.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,TooManyGlasses,4.49,"2016 bottle from the cellar - not going to lie - not sure I drank any of the 2016 fresh.... Pours a clear garnet, dark ruby colour with tawny beige head. A bit of sediment left in bottle. Aroma of caramel malt, bread, date but despite age a strong hop burst is there - piney, resin, candied grapefruit peel. Malty sweetness on the palate - burnt toffee, caramel, date and bread - quickly overcome by a barrage of hop flavours - resinous pine, candied citrus peel, grapefruit with a sticky bitterness coating the palate. Full sticky mouthfeel, decent carbonation despite aged state with a lingering powerful bittersweetness. Marvellous.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,RacerX5k,1.52,"Yes, Bigfoot is an legend, an icon. And, every year, I have one, or two, singles, and yes, last year I depleted the stock at multiple locals, and for 6 months, it was that good. Got my bitterness on, along with Old Rasputin, how I survived (last year) ,... this year? This is not THAT review ...  This year? This beer fucking stinks, on rye, like one reviewer noted, recently, Yes, I finished my one sixer, and just to be sure, wasted the $2.50 on one more single last night ... way too harsh, and plastic, fake, tasting. No balance and this will only got worse over time And while, the other legend Celebration Ale, was very good, it does NOT belong in cans. loses aroma.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,RyanK252,4.28,"2022 bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada Brewing Co tulip glass  A: Pours gorgeous ruby copper amber with a frothy khaki head that settles to a firm layer that hangs around for a bit and leaves plenty of nice lacing.  S: Rich toasty bready malt, toffee, dark and stone fruit, all countered with a strong hit of resinous pine and citrus rind.  T: Hops hit first, citrus, grapefruit and orange, resinous pine, followed by a mix of fruity notes, plum, fig, apricot, peach, cherry, and raisin, toasty bready malt, and toffee sweetness.  M: Medium to full body, moderate carbonation, just a hint of alcohol.  O: Didn't realize I hadn't logged this one until recently, even though I've had plenty of it before, so I figured I might a well grab a fresh bottle and enter in a baseline, then revisit with a vintage bottle.  Fresh, it drinks kinda like a mix of TIPA and hoppy American Strong Ale, in a good way. English Barleywines get the majority of the attention, but there's a reason this American style one has stayed around so long.

140,2671,md3kcn,4.57,"Purchased as a single bottle from The Blue Door for $4. 2022 vintage. Poured into a cognac snifter.  L - A fantastic clear ruby, with a two-finger khaki head that doesn't die out. Lacing is excellent. S - Super floral. Getting rosehip, grapefruit peel, pine tar, and red apple. A hint of ethanol on the nose. T - Toffee, stone fruit, and pine resin. Juicy grapefruit, followed by a heavy black bread note. Finish is intense and pine-heavy. You really pick up the ABV on the latter half of the glass... F - Full-bodied, with minimal carbonation. Filling. Warm. Heavy. O - The king of Sierra Nevada's brews. Like the weathered father of an immature imperial IPA. Dense, intense, and titillating every sense, this one is for the fans.

140,2671,tzbel013,4.48,My 2nd foray into a gnarly wine style beer after Lagunitas Brown Shugga. Definitely catch the malts sweetness on the nose but it's the intense malt/hop hit on the 1st sip that is impressive.

140,2671,Wattie83,4.22,"2021 version. Poured 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a deep caramel color with an off white head that falls to a cap. Very active carbonation rising up. Aroma is caramel and earthy hops mixed with a combination of dark fruit and citrus fruit. Taste is caramel, malty sweetness, resinous/earthy hops, and alcohol. Feel is thick and chewy with a nice carbonation bite. In the end there's a bit of dryness that sneaks in. There's a definite alcohol warmth with this.

140,2671,nizzle8287,5,"I first started drinking Bigfoot exactly 10 years ago, and every year, I buy several 6 packs and drink them periodically throughout the year. Today, I'm drinking the 2022 release on 2/5/22. It is outstanding, as usual. There was a ton of hop residue in the bottom of the bottle already, and I like my Bigfoot on the hoppy side, so I swished the last little bit around in the bottom of the bottle before I finished the pour. Pours a beautiful (and slightly hazy) dark cherry to copper hue with a beige head that falls down to an island with a ring around the rim of the glass. Smell is actually slightly mute this time around, but I can detect a slight caramel sweetness that blends well with a general, but faint, hop presence. The taste is definitely hop-forward, as I did swish the residue out of the bottle into my glass, but for me, that makes it perfectly balanced with its absolutely booming malt character. I believe that several hop varieties are used in the brewing of this beer, and the bitter aftertaste is absolutely there, but the malt flavor is so huge that it's hard to pinpoint any one flavor that stands out; it is amazingly well blended. Bitter-sweet medium-thick mouthfeel that finishes quite dry... the alcohol presence is very well hidden... Overall one of the best Bigfoot releases I've had yet!  Update 2/14/23 - The 2023 release is the best ever. Probably in the top 3 best winter beers I've ever had.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,MartyMaltose,4.22,"Long-time Bigfoot enthusiast. Generally you can expect a somewhat-sweet, quite malty version of an IPA, like an IPA that has had 40% of the water evaporated out of it. Generally, delicious!  2022's is harsher, as KT3418 has mentioned (although ""barleywine style"" is just a legal term for all barleywines...not an indication that it's not a real barleywine). The usual heat is just not balanced this year by enough syrupy sweetness. Disappointing but it's still one of the more awesome brews on the shelves.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Spade,4.44,"Minimal head on a deep copper body. The aroma doesn't prepare for the taste, which is intense. A wonderfully bitter hop bite on a robust malt base, with a full mouthfeel. This will be great for cellaring!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,klarcbarr3,3.91,"I poured a 12 oz. Sierra Nevada Bigfoot into a pint glass. A cream colored head emerged above a beautiful red amber body that was impressively carbonated. Profuse lacing rose above a head that receded but never entirely disappeared. I have never been more impressed by a beers' look! The magic faded on the nose, however. Nice raspberry and bread notes were offset by a pungent hops note, which overrode the more pleasant components. The taste was a bit more amenable to enjoyment... the sweetness expected from a barleywine is there, and lingers a bit, but after a minute without a sip, the hops reasserts and again controls your senses. There is a sense of quality to this brew... the taste, look and feel of it are assertive, and if you are a true hophead, you might be enchanted with Sierra Nevada Bigfoot. I prefer to enjoy a barleywine that celerates its' fruited and grain characteristics. This is not that beer. The mouthfeel is quite good, I anguished a bit, that perhaps it deserved a 4.5. Overall, the taste and smell kill it for me, but I like dark, sweet beers. There are simply too many hops in the mix here for me, but I do believe it is a quality brew that will be cherished by hops lovers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,KT3418,3.01,"The 2022 edition is absolutely awful fresh. Tastes like an extremely malt-forward IPA. None of us could stand this. Hope it's better next time or with age.

Few elements elegantly linked together. Delight.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,LesDewitt4beer,4.6,"Beginning in 2005 I've enjoyed each year of this release. It is perfectly rich, sweet and hoppy with deeply caramelized malts, firm and creamy. It has the signature SN central axis of taste that illuminates throughout their beers. Now 2021, I can finally cellar some bottles to enjoy and age for a few years. A beautiful American Barleywine that is world-class in it's style. UPDATE as of April 7, 2022: 2021 release 12oz bottle pkg dated 12/10/2020 into a pint glass. L: Pours a slightly clouded ruby burnished copper w/a thin creamy khaki head that dissipates to creamy edge foam. No visible carbonation. No lacing. S: Roasted malt, caramelized malts, light earthy hops, a hind of biscuit. Moderate alcohol as the beer warms. T: Gentle sharp hop bitterness, roasted malts followed by dates, citrus rind, sweet/tart hops, caramelized malts again then deep pine resin that goes fairly broad on the tongue. It's firm & lengthy hop bitterness results in a long resinous linger. F: Lightly crisp, bold, firm, medium bodied mouth feel w/a drying long lingering finish. O: This annual American Barleywine release I have is 16 months cellared and has a radiant taste of sweet malts and pine resin hops. It's toastiness & bitterness are expertly blended and it is outstanding and or world-class in it's style. *The 2022 release has a bit more of a head, the body is clear burnished copper, aroma has berries and is a bit more citrusy, the taste is quite similar though bitterness is at the front rather than in the finish, it's feel is slightly slick.

The beer pours a slightly cloudy amber color with some deep garnet highlights on the edges. A dense fluffy head of 2.5 cm foams up and slowly fades to a cotton candy like surface foam. Great dense lattice clinging to the glass as it slips down toward the surface. Aroma is some chocolate and caramel mixing with a bit of toasted grain and brown sugar, but also still a good hop bite. The hops show up with some pine sap and and black tea scent, but the booze is pretty well hidden.  The first sip on this beer is amazing, very creamy and soft texture, which I didnt expect. Fine gentle carbonation that fizzes up in my mouth when swished. Medium body and this beer drinks pretty easy for the physical traits. Flavor is what I expect after the aroma, but a little more hop focused than the nose which was more balanced. I get some dark chocolate, bakers type here, a bit of caramel and some light brown sugar. This rolls to herbal hop notes and again some pine sap and a bit of general bitterness. Booze isnt present in warmth or bite or flavor.

Heavy, bitter hops. But of course, there’s more— figs, carmal, spices, and a boozy malt background that holds hands with the hoppiness oh so nicely. The residual malt really reminds me of a nice barrel aged scotch ale. Feels quite nice, not over carbonated, not too smooth.

A light tan frothy head lingers for a while leaving behind a small cap and quite a bit of lacing.  As soon as you remove the cap the aroma fills the room. Lots of citrusy (grapefruit) and piney hops dominate the aroma with impressive amounts of caramel, toffee, raisin, and to a lesser degree roasty and toasty malts . Small hints of brown sugar and molasses round out the nose.  The flavor is a very nice mix of piney hops and tons of grapefruit. This beer is all about the hops at first (one of the benefits of a fresh barleywine).

140,2671,Rug,4.2,"2021 bottle, very fresh on this one  Closing out the virtual Barleywine tasting event with this classic. I have been looking for this beer for quite some time, but I never see it in my area. Shoutout to Half Time in Mamaroneck NY for hooking me up with this one. Let's dive in  Pours a clear ruby tinged dark amber with a finger of tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  Good lord, the aroma definitely sells the freshness of this American barleywine, it's all about the hops! I'm picking up on aromas of oily dank hops, pithy grapefruit, pine, sweet caramel, dark bread, molasses, and a touch of black cherry  This is incredibly balanced in taste, constantly mingling the best expressions of hops and malt. On the front end of the sip, I'm tasting dark toffee, molasses, lightly piney hops, and toasty malt. The swallow is a different beast, at first bringing notes of dark fruits, thick molasses, orange zest, and brown sugar, before leaving lingering notes of spicy pine and alcohol  A medium full body pairs with soft carbonation resulting in an insanely smooth and easy drinking beer. Finishes almost entirely dry because of the hops, creating a rather refreshing barleywine, if there's such a thing  This is a classic for a reason.

Doing a side-by-side with a 2019 (bottled 12/05/18) & a 2021 (12/04/20)  L : 2019 : Lightly hazy medium amber, with a slight touch of reddishness. 3/4 finger of light tan head, that leaves a thin ring, a thin center sheet, and a few spots of lacing. (3.75) 2021 : Same as above, except for slightly darker, and longer lasting head. (4)  S: 2019 : Toffee, dried figs ,prune, caramel, a little leather, and slight doughy malt. (4.25) 2021 : Resinous piney hops - smooth/rounded, not sharp - , light fruitiness somewhere between cherry pie filling (but less sweet) and brandy , & light fresh bread aroma. Definite difference , that I could smell as I was pouring. (4) T: 2019: An initial kiss of sweetish toffee, followed by dried figs, though less sweet and with a woody tang - similar to when getting a bit of stem within the bite of fig , finishing with light, dryiing bitterness . (4.25) 2021: Brown bread (think ginger bread , minus the ginger/spices), but lighter , slight caramel, a light, vague fruity/floral flavor (hops, I assume) finishing with light bitterness, and a bit of very light lingering pine. Given the greater hop presence in the aroma, this fresh one comes across as less hoppy/bitter, and not as dry of a finish. (4) F: 2019 : Medium , moderately oily/slick, with light-medium , soft carbonation tingle. Lingering drying finish that leaves the tongue with a scrubbed-clean feeling. (4) 2021: Similar to the older version, but a bit more oily/slick feeling, and less of a dry/stripped feel on the tongue.(4.25)  Overall, a pleasure , at either age. If I could choose only one, it would be the older version. The fresh one feels better, but the aged one has more complexity.

Chewy hop flowers and earthiness linger as light ethanol wafts into the picture and closes with a huge hop bite, booze, and chewy malt Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, big and chewy, medium-high carbonation, bold, hoppy, and very dry on the finish along with more alcohol heat Overall: This is freaking incredible and not at all surprising that it is. What can I say, I love this huge, beastly, bold, and boozy American Barleywine. One of my favorite beers to kick off any/all new calendar years and probably my personal gold standard for the style. Raw citrus fruit and bitter peel, floral and resinous components, a huge, bready malt bill, earthy, dry, and noticeable alcohol heat sum this up quite well in my opinion.

The bitterness comes in first. It's closely followed by the sweet malts I smelled but the bitter hops come back. It's not too thin, maybe a medium mouthfeel. Smooth with a lot of little bubbles. It finishes both sweet and bitter. It lasts for a long time, I can still taste it. It's a different kind of beer. I've had barleywine before but this one is unique. Usually they are this sweet but that sweetness has more complexities of sugars and grains whereas this one has just the bitter hoppiness of an IPA competing with the barleywine.

The taste amplifies the smell qualities; richer, boozier flavors; low-key suggestion of brown sugar; fantastic dull bitterness to counterpoint the sweetness.

140,2671,o29,4.39,"01/09/2021: 2021 (fresh) Look: Pours a deep mahogany with good head and lacing. More red, less brown and slightly better head retention than the 10 year aged variant. Smell: Smell is still malty and hoppy, but much, much hoppier. Much of the dark fruit and fig found in the 10 year bottle are subdued by the hops here. Taste: Similar to the nose, very very hoppy, and many of the complexities are hidden by the intense hopping. I can see the criticisms of this as a barleywine, though to my palate I still find this very enjoyable fresh. Dark fruit is still found somewhere buried beneath the hops. Feel: Well carbonated and full. Overall: This is a much hoppier beer than the aged bottle, which I still thought was hoppy compared to an English Barleywine. Still a fantastic beer, and amazing how different its qualities change as it ages. Truly one of the best beers for aging, and still just as impressive (though different and perhaps less true to style) fresh. ------------------------ 01/08/2021: 2011 (10 year vintage) Look: Pours a dark copper with decent head and lacing. Smell: Smell is dominated by heaps of malts and hops. Caramel, fig, dark fruits. Taste: Similar to the nose, big on hops and caramel malts. Quite sweet with a big hop presence to ""balance"" the heavy malt bill as you'd expect from a Sierra Nevada barleywine, though it's understandable that this is not everyone's preference. Feel: This 2011 bottle is still a thick beer, though I think a fresher bottle would score better here. Overall: For a 10-year-old beer it's still delicious all things considered, but I do think it would have been better if enjoyed a few years sooner. In terms of the beer itself, it's a big beer that can certainly be polarizing particularly to those who prefer milder versions of the American barleywine style, but it's one that I personally find quite enjoyable from time to time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Nose off the bat is strong resinous hops, pine, grapefruit, citrus peel, rounder sweeter malts, fresh baked brown bread, baking spice, a hint of green bell pepper. Taste is very hop forward, with rich, resinous, hop oils drowning out nearly all other flavors. There's a strong tannic, bitter aftertaste that lingers as well, blocking any sweeter, maltier flavors out. In many ways, this is plays like a TIPA with its hoppy intensity. As it warms, the bitterness remains dominant, but the sugars play up a bit more. Mouthfeel is full and unctuous, but the lively carbonation prevents it from becoming a slog to drink. Not much balance to this, but as a hop-dominant sipper it does the trick.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,hoptheology,1.53,"Re-review 2020. This is a 2017 vintage I'm having tonight, and I figured 3 years would have tapered off the harshness of the hops, and helped this beer mellow out a bit, even as a very hoppy American Barleywine.  Pours a dark oxidized caramel color with an egg foam yellow head of 1/2 finger.  Aroma of hop oils, perfume, alcohol, golden raisin, dark raisin, and caramel.  Flavor is candy vitamins, oxidized hops, raisin, resin, hop oils, and yellowed hop leaves.  Feel is hot and scathing, medium bodied and thinning out on the palate. Heat remains.  Overall, I have never liked this beer, got it as an ""extra"" in a trade, and figured I'd give it one more shot. It turns out this is still an awful hoppy mess - and I'm a huge hop head now. It's not balanced in any regard, and is on the lowest of the low for barleywine beers. So gross. I can drink the heaviest triple IPAs, but this thing is just a fucking gross mess. It is a total drain pour. Zero balance to this beer whatsoever. Like drinking straight hop oils. It's the biggest head shaker for me on highly regarded commercial craft beer.  -------------------------- 3/22/2017  Year : 2016.  It starts off great with a pour of mahogany and burnt caramel. The head is egg foam yellow and towering above the woody body.  On the label it talks about a lot of cone hops, but that's about all I smell when nosing this particular BW. This comes off more as a quadruple iPA in the aroma. Onion, grapefruit, garlic. Hits of caramel.  SN's Barleywine drinks like a hoppy, oily mess. I realize the American Barleywine style is hoppier than the English counterpart, but this is just a cop out. Dump a bunch of hops into the boil and use a touch of caramel malts along with the huge pale malt bill and there you have it. It's total vidalia onion, awful grapefruit, and a garbage-caramel gross sweetness. Awful.  I just can't quit disliking this beer. Feel is slick and oily, all the way down. Not boozy, not alcoholic, just a resiny mess.  Overall a very disconnected, one trick hop-blasted beer that drinks more like a super hop infused malt liquor. It's disgusting. I'll probably never return to this beer since it's turned me off so badly! To style? This beer is a fat ass F. It's an IPA if anything, and barleywine-ignorant-hopheads with scrubbed palates are the only reason this beer gets any credit.  1.69 / 5",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

There was a nice diversity of rocky and micro bubbles on the head but there was very little retention to it. Despite this, it left a nice lacing around my glass.  On the nose, I found that there was a fair amount of balance between the malts and the hops. There was a good sweet barley malt aroma upfront, but it was coupled with a grapefruit bitterness with a tinge of mandarin oranges. There was also a noticeable amount of ethanol aroma in the back end.  The taste followed the nose, presenting a nice balance between the sweet barley malt and the bitterness and citrus-y notes of the hops. The beginning starts with a big boozy ethanol taste which mellows out to the bitterness and citrus-y notes of the hops. The beer then finishes with the biscuit and caramel notes of the malts with a hop grapefruit bitterness.  The feel is medium to full bodied. It's undoubtedly big and boozy, but I found that it was surprisingly smooth. It had a light carbonation to it and leaves the mouth with a long lingering bitter aftertaste coupled with a slightly tangy orange sweetness. Again, this is a pretty big and boozy beer, and it doesn't even try to hide the alcohol content--so there is definitely a noticeable warmth from the ABV on the palate and throat.  Overall, I felt that this was an above average barleywine. Really good, but definitely a sipper. There was a lot more hop taste/aroma in this that I thought there would be, making this an overall solid and balanced beer.

The color is deep reddish brown with a tan creamy head and minimal lacing. The beer appears slighly cloudy and lower in carbonation. The smell is of hops, alcohol and maybe peaches, surely some sort of fruit. The flavor is hoppy as well, with fruitiness and some citrus tones in there. The alcohol level does come out in the taste department, but not in a negative way. There is that little heat sensation from the ABV and then its back to the flavor.

140,2671,SierraNevallagash,3.96,"2020 Vintage - poured into a short stem at just above cellar temp  Pours a deep mahogany hue - beyond caramel, beyond amber, but not brown. Stained mahogany with deep red highlights, excellent clarity, and topped with two large fingers of dense sandy head which slowly recedes to a giant cap ajd collar, leaving some irregular, albeit tenacious lacing behind. Plentiful visible effervescence rising to feed the cap.  Nose: The aroma is actually a touch muted, but presents itself with plenty of deep caramelised crystal malt which lends a ton of caramel and toffee, much like you'd expect from a Sierra Nevada IPA, but the malt is much firmer, taking things a step further with brown sugar, dried cherry, fig, raisin, date, and some other dark fruit notes. The aggressive hopping with classic West Coast C-hops brings a bouquet of pine and classic floral notes with a hint of juicy grapefruit and tangerine. It presents itself much like a big malty imperial IPA on the nose.  Palate: The beer greets the palate with a big malty sweetness that opens up with cherry, raisin, fig, brown sugar, and toffee which is immediately overtaken by an absolute bombardment of Centennial and Cascade hops. An early and biting resinous bitterness cuts through the malt sweetness bringing sappy, resinous pine and a metric ton of grapefruit pith, as well as all of the predictable floral notes that you would expect from any West Coast-style IPA. The finish dries the beer out considerably, with the resinous hops continuing to increase in pithy bitterness. The malt falls back, leaving all the bitter hop resins to linger and linger with dry floral notes, grapefruit rind, and pine sap. From start to finish, I think anyone drinking this blind would guess it was some type of IPA.  Mouthfeel/Body: The one element of this beer that leans more towards a barleywine. Right out of the gate, Bigfoot has a big, bold, sticky malt delivery - full-bodied with a bit of chewy viscosity at room temperature. Effervescence is pretty lively for the ABV and semi-fine in nature, also keeping in line with the imperial IPA theme. Quite sticky up front, with a hint of a syrupy texture, then becoming quite drying in the finish, with slick hop oils coating the palate.  Overall: I'm quite torn on this beer. I purchase it every year, and I enjoy it, but not when I'm looking to enjoy a barleywine. To me, this has always been a big, bold, malty imperial IPA hopped to high hell with classic Sierra Nevada hopping techniques. I've always preferred English-style barleywine over American barleywine because I find many American styles to be over-hopped. Bigfoot though, is an entirely different beast, and it is so aggressively hoppy, I cannot think of it as anything other than an IPA. I find it best when it's as fresh as possible, though I'm not sure how 5+ years would affect it. Perhaps it's more barleywine-like after extensive aging, but all in all, as long as I don't think of it as a barleywine, it's a great hoppy imperial...ale.

Pleasing. Taste - Rich and complex. There's a bread, malt, sweetness. There's actually a decent hop flavor here, which surprised me. Some raisin. It's got a decent, boozy punch.. Thick full body. Surprised at the carbonation, considering the age, but it dances on my tongue. This is a solid Barleywine, and it ages well.

140,2671,Nass,3.89,"2018 Vintage. Bigfoot has some interesting bottle label artwork. I do notice a bottled on date on the neck of the bottle. It pours a dark reddish, light brown, hints of purple type of color. The nose reminds me of sweetened prune. On the tasting i'm detecting some hops, some caramel, figs, prunes, dates, slight pine character, it's also malty sweet, & biscuity. The 9.6% abv has melded well in this drink. This is a classic Barleywine that has held up over the years. This is clearly a beer that I think will develop & taste better with a few years of age to it. Cheers!

Cherry and caramel hits as well. Taste is definitely hop forward, quite bitter, tastes like black tea and lightly of lemon or lime peel. some tart apple and more caramel as it warms up. Hadn't had this in years and am honestly shocked at how hoppy it is. This could pass as an imperial IPA. Mouthfeel is a little on the lighter side. Really surprised at that, it's not watery but it is definitely not dominant or really filling. Overall this is a really nice english imperial IPA? The most American of American barleywines I suppose.

140,2671,CaptainHate,4.21,"2/3/2019 This is the first of many reviews of this as a baseline since I've already aged a 2018 sixer and will do likewise with more of this. Poured into a large goblet produced a smaller than expected head over a clear dark brown amber body. Smell is of piney citrusy toffee. Taste was surprisingly not the hop monster I was expecting; don't get me wrong, there was plenty of bitterness but already complex dark sweet flavors underneath with very little overt alcohol. Mouthfeel was particularly bitter on the back end.  2/17/2019 After my 2/4 initial plunge with a 2019, which was at my daughter's and son in law's place in Santa Cruz, I decided when I returned to chez Hate to pop one of the 2018s (bottled 12/01/2017) as a basis of comparison. One huge difference: I store mine in a cellar fridge set between 50-55; God knows what the kids fridge is set at but it's a *lot* colder. Maybe because of that the head was much larger and consistent with what photos here have illustrated. Definitely because of the temp differences the smell was more prominent as was the taste. The hops are still very forward and any drop off is indiscernible to my unrefined palate. There's still an underlying sweetness that I hope comes more to the fore with increased age. I'll probably pick up a 2019 sixer tomorrow for cellaring.  2015 (12/4/2014) bottle bought cellar aged. Poured into a DFH tulip there was a thick creamy head of an inch and a half over a clear dark reddish amber body. Smell was richly sweet with the hoppy pine scent having fallen off for a sherry and other sweet smell. Still some hop bitterness in the taste but much reduced from younger bottles. Defintely the dark fruit sweetness is more prominent with very little cardboard presence. Although this will never attain the complexity of an English Barleywine it is still very very good. Not sure if this is the ultimate sweet spot but I will strive to research this as a long term project.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Pours a murky deep brown with a slight garnet hue, two fingers of thick creamy tan head. Nose of big dark fruit with a deep malty sweetness. Notes of raisin, pine bark, preserved fig, hard caramel candy, babka cake, fruit leather and just a hint of alcohol. Loved it! Taste follows the nose with the well melded flavors of sweet dark fruit, spicy babka and pine. Additionally I get a bit of roastiness of the back end as well as earthiness that seems to build on each sip. It's got a luxuriously smooth medium+ body with carbonation still there to prick the back of your palette 6 years in. This is the only bottle of '13 I have and I REALLY wish I had some more.

140,2671,defunksta,3.8,"Appearance: Pours a clear but dark amber/brown in color with a heavy, large, prominent, foamy, light-tan head. The head is sticky and leaves balls of foam creeping down the glass. SRM of 17-19. (4.50)  Aroma: Minimal. Faint dense and soapy citrus behind a smooth rich orange maramalade and resinous and melted citrus candy. The properties of the beer are hidden and not well portrayed in the aroma. (3.25)  Flavor: Orange citrus, marmalade, and melted candied citrus upfront. Deep, sweet, and resinous. The flavor embodies the alcohol well. Strong and hoppy upfront. Vague, sweet, fruit flavors before it's walloped up in a alcoholic caramel and chocolate sweetness. Intensely bitter, but it eventually dissolved by the malts and alcohol. The alcohol is pronounced. A marked sharp pine bitterness lingers. (4.00)  Feel: Heavy body as expected. Well carbonated. Oily, resiny, and sweet as expected. Bitterness and sweetness dance on the lingering palate. (4.00)  Compared with Dirty Bastard (Founder's) 3/14/20: Pours a slightly clearer and lighter amber color. Less aroma, but leans more citrusy and hoppy. Flavor is much more hoppy nectar than caramel or brown sugar. Finishes much more bitter. More oily and alcoholic. Similar sweetness.  Compared to Bell's Third Coast Ale 1/9/21: Pours an identical appearance. Milder aromas. More orange citrus. Less caramel, strudel, and chocolate. Much more mild aromas/flavors. Stronger bitterness. More hoppy and less malty.  Compared to Elysian's BiFrost Winter Ale 3/12/21: Pours a much darker color with a larger head. Stronger aromas of dark fruit, treacle, cherry, pine soap, citrus. Less caramel and brown malt. Stronger alcohol, hops, burn, and bitterness.  Overall: This is my only of the style. Strong flavors of dark fruit, licorice, cherry, treacle, caramel. Some pine soap and citrus underneath. The alcohol and flavor is strong. Sweetness is moderate. Carbonation is heavy but hidden in the heavy, oily mouthfeel.. An interesting heavy beer that is well hopped and bitter to balance the sweetness, Definitely leans American. Sort of like SN Pale Ale or Celebration Ale on steroids. It drinks much like a triple or quadruple IPA with a caramel malt profile. Strong caramel and some hops here.

140,2671,jrc1093,4.07,"Bottled on 12/1/17 (2018 release)  Pours a clean, effervescent deep maroon topped with a thick, fluffy off-white head; very solid retention results in thick walls of lacing and a steady collar when it recedes.  Aroma is heavily piney, but smooths out without becoming too aggressive; fairly one-dimensional, but the intermingling with light tones of sweeter, roasty caramel malt in the background really further the depth of a singular note and has it bursting.  Taste really brings forth some of the restrained aggression in the pine and hops with an earthy bitterness that builds calmly through to the finish; like the aroma, softer notes of caramel malt are present to diversify the profile as its few notes develop.  Mouthfeel shows a fairly robust medium body with a steadily increasing hoppy bitterness and a spectacularly leveled medium carbonation. Drying toward the finish, but a slight stickiness prevents it from doing so fully; overall, silky, gritty, and equal parts easy and aggressive on the palate; so excellently done.  Aggressive, hoppy, and singular in its profile, this is just a beast of a beer with some incredible balance shown throughout; easy to see why this could be considered a quintessential American barleywine.

Aroma is spicy, cake-like bready, sweet grain, caramel/toffee, subtle raisin, fig and white fruits; some grass & pine with a strong alcohol note.

140,2671,Tsar_Riga,4.06,"2012 bottle, so nicely aged.  A - Dark brown body, mostly opaque with strong red and orange highlights, light tan head with an orange tint, and extensive small bubble lacing.  S - Harsh alcohol and pine notes, almost like floor cleaner, but in a manner that is not offensive per se. Caramel and lemon aspects are also there, offering something more pleasant.  T - A sipper, as you might expect. Opens with caramel sweetness, leading to lemon and bread, and a grassy, steeped tea bitter bite in the finish. That bite helps keep things from getting cloying but is itself a bit overpowering, particularly when the beer is still cold. You end up wanting to take another sip quick, but if you let it linger, the biting bitterness does trail off after peaking at about 30 seconds from the drink.  M - Moderate body, with a very dry and building finish.  O - This is a beer designed to sit and grow. And it does offer great flavor range, a mingling of bitterness and sweet caramel.

Smells like toffee and roasted malts. Also picking up stone fruits like raisins. A bit of alcohol on the nose.  Hops, raisins and oh my! Picking up some roasted malts and a touch of sweetness. The hop bitterness is very pronounced at the front and back of the taste. The sweetness is kind of like a toffee unlike any I have tasted, like a bitter toffee.  Mouthfeel is full and that bitterness lingers. Finish seems a bit long and somewhat slick but crisper than what I thought.  Overall this is not a crushable or easy drinking beer. This is more of a sipper. The beer lover in me is trying to pull all I can out of this beer as it seems so complex. By the way this is the 2018 offering. The biigest thing I can pull out of this is the craftmanship that goes into this beer. It seems like it is so complex and wants to give the beer drinker so much more to enjoy.

The malts do give it just a bit of a bittersweet flavor to it, and there's an interesting almost raisiny after-taste, but to me it feels unbalanced and too intense on my palate. It does look awesome - a deep red color with a head that never dissipated as I sipped it down. It also hides the alcohol well for 9.6%. I couldn't possibly say this is bad.

140,2671,Snowcrash000,4.27,"I will be doing this review in the form of a side-by-side comparing the 2014 to the 2020 vintage. The score represents the 2020 vintage, as it's the one I personally prefered.  Upon pouring there really isn't that much of a difference in the look, with the 2014 managing a somewhat surprising amount of frothy head and even some carbonation bubbles, as well as a near identical deep copper coloration, although it is also noticeably less clear, looking a bit more turbid with plenty of tiny floaties visible when held up to the light. Upon final pour, the 2020 maintains some dulled clarity, while the 2014 turns completely murky.  As expected the nose is a LOT more hoppy for the 2020, which features some grainy, caramel malt, but also noticeable citrus and pine aromas, with much lighter dark fruit. The 2014 turns this on its head, with a much richer and sweeter caramel malt and dark fruit/red berry presence almost reminiscent of a sherry, which also makes this feel a bit more boozy, although the merest hint of pine is still detectable as well.  The taste is very much a continuation of the nose, with the 2020 being a LOT more hoppy, with a much stronger bitterness and some zesty grapefruit and resinous pine notes, although also displaying some caramel malt and much lighter dark fruit, with hints of plum and figs. The 2014 is naturally a lot more sweet and malty, with richer and more complex dark fruit and red berry notes of plum, fig, dates, redcurrant and lighter cherry, while almost completely lacking the citrus and pine elements, although the pine is still somewhat evident as a faint echo in the aftertaste. The much increased sweetness adds some honey and brown sugar notes, while the more complex dark fruit and berry notes manifest themselves in a certain sherry character, which makes it feel a bit more boozy in the aftertaste as well.  Body and mouthfeel seem very much identical, with not much of a real difference identifiable. The 2014 may feel just a tad richer, perhaps, although this may well be my imagination based on expectations.  Overall, this makes for a somewhat predictable side-by-side, with the 2020 being a lot more hoppy and bitter and the 2014 being a lot more malty and sweet, with a somewhat greater complexity but also poorer balance for my personal taste. While the results may be predictable, it's still quite intriguing to experience how much a beer like this can change over 6 years and I think that Bigfoot is the perfect example of this because it is such a bold and hoppy American Barleywine when fresh that pretty much turns into an English Barleywine as it ages, while still managing to hold on to some faint echoes of that hoppiness.  I have a feeling that I will go very much against popular opinion when I say that I enjoyed the 2020 a lot more than the 2014, but then again I always prefered American over English Barleywines and the 2014 is just too sweet for me, while I'm also not a big fan of that somewhat oxidized Sherry character that makes it feel more boozy somehow. While the 2014 certainly has a greater complexity to it, it feels more one-dimensional at the same time, because that additional depth almost exclusively brings more sweetness to the beer, while I personally much prefered that sharp contrast of sweet and bitter notes that the 2020 offers, with the caramel malt and dark fruits being very nicely balanced against bitter, resinous hops and citrus fruit here.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,beercat11,4.37,"2018 version. Have had this offering every year the past 10 years and still look forward to it's release. The main reason I go out of my way for the SN barley wine is the hop profile of course. Might not be as traditional as many other barley wines but that is exactly why I like it so much. It pours a nice reddish brown with a nice fluffy head and leaves a nice sticky lace all the way down the snifter as it's consumed. I like to swirl the sediment on the bottom of the bottle to get that hazy appearance and add a little more head potential from the yeast, also puts some bread dough in the mix if you look for it. The balance of the hops and the malt is just right for my taste, Sweet caramel with a touch of pine seems perfect and almost too easy to drink. Alcohol is almost non present. I chill the beer cold like any other IPA and take my time sipping it to enjoy the other flavors that unravel as it warms. Molasses and candied yams come to mind later on. Not too heavy going down due to the mid range tiny bubble carbonation profile. Bitterness is present somewhere in the middle to end. Balance is the key to this treat and that's why it works in this years version as well, as it should and as it has in all earlier vintages.

140,2671,ntraft,1.58,"2018 Edition  I had this many years ago (2008) and it was a major milestone on my journey into the world of beer. It was unlike anything I had ever tried before and even in years hence I continued to regard it as a remarkable example of barleywine. Today I saw it while in the checkout line, and on a whim decided to grab a six-pack.  With this latest effort, Sierra Nevada has utterly destroyed this previously-cherished offering.  The description on the bottle already had me a bit worried: ""heaps of whole-cone, Pacific Northwest hops."" Huh?! What do hops have to do with a barleywine?? They're an afterthought.  Look: Head sticks to the glass, and color is the deep reddish hue that I would expect. Does not bear the same cloudiness that I remember from previous iterations, however.  Smell: Fairly unremarkable. There's a hint of the old Bigfoot deep down somewhere in there, with vanishingly faint notes of raisin and dark fruits under the cacophony of hop oils. I practically have to touch my nose to the liquid to sense it.  Taste: It has not a trace of the sweet raisin flavor I originally fell in love with. The previously rich, syrupy malt has been utterly demolished by an astringent, choking load of hops that has me clearing my throat and chugging water. And for that bitterness I'm not even rewarded with the citrus earthiness of the typical IPA.  Feel: Doesn't have the rich creaminess that it had in previous years. Otherwise unremarkable.  Overall: Literally, what is the point of this beer?? It is literally pointless. It has no place in the world. There are plenty of double IPAs in the world. Why did they need to make one that didn't have the malty sweetness to backup those hops?? They should be ashamed of themselves. They have destroyed something that used to be a cornerstone of Great Beer. This is on the order of the destruction of Palmyra, the ancient World Heritage site which has has recently been ravaged by Syrian conflict.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Celebration is better and that ain't saying much by any means.  I'd say chalky, but I'd attribute that to the overall hop character and a drastic lack of maltiness. Sad really.  I'd never ask for my money back, but if you handed me this beer and called it good? Probably going to judge you really hard.  What do I think this is closer to?

It forms two fingers worth of dense and creamy, well held, tingy yellow colored crown. Heavy lacing. Couldn’t look better.  The nose brings a prominent element of pine. It smells like I’m in the mountains looking for Bigfoot. It brings a sweetness of caramel as well and some apple skin present.  The taste comes in more malty than the nose with the pine playing as a nice background. Toasted malts, caramel, apple skins and toffee all backed by the pine hop presence. The pine is almost so present that it resembles a woody element.  The mouthfeel is bitter with the pine. Dry, woody. Medium-full bodied on the body but great with carbonation. An alcohol presence in some warmness that could make you think it might even be more than the stated 9.6%.  Overall, this is one of my favorites of the American style barleywines.

140,2671,BergBeer,2.91,"@sierranevada 2016 Bigfoot. An American Barleywine. 9.6% ABV Chico, CA  Look: A murky caramel brown with a medium khaki head. No activity visible.  Smell: Sticky and boozy on the nose. Notes of dried figs, golden rum cake, tree sap, pine cones, golden raisins, toffee, and big floral hops. The alcohol is strong and vaporous. Reminiscent of a tawny port with pine cones and bitter hops.  Taste: Intense. Upfront there is a brief sticky attack of golden raisins and toffee. Then the palate is put into what I can only describe as a choke hold of bitter pine hops. This bitterness dominates the palate until the end of the body where hints of golden molasses, whole wheat bread, and dried dates are able to poke through. However that is quickly overwhelmed again by the finish which is a heavyweight wrestling match of sharp astringent booze and more floral hops bitterness.  Feel: Big, chewy, resinous. This beer takes hold of the palate and gives no reprieve. High bitterness. High alcohol. Medium carbonation.  Overall: The quality of this beer is immediately apparent. It’s drinks “clean” as in there is no real flaws to speak of. However this works against this beer for me. This is seemingly how the brewers want this beer to be experienced. Yet, this beer isn’t exactly pleasant to drink. It’s so bitter and chewy. The bitterness absolutely dominates to the point that doesn’t let the rest of the the beer shine. This should balance the stark sweetness of a barleywine. You could even do it in an out of balance way to match the American style but it goes too far in in the hops. This one has almost 3 years in the bottle. Might have to age it even further to let some of those hops drop out. Can’t see myself drinking this very often. Maybe checking up on it every few years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,monkist,5,"I was glad to find this one from Sierra, as they are one of my favorite breweries - and I love barleywine so the joy was double. It is from 2015 so by today (2017) it is already somewhat vintage. Actually it is a barleywine-style ale the bottle says and right, it is not as syrupy as a normal barleywine would be. It is rather like a heavily hopped ale and Sierra are masters of this kind of beer. Along with heavly caramellized malts I feel loads of hops, especially perhaps bittering hops? because the aftertaste is quite bitter with quite a complexity. Very good that the body is lighter than a usual barleywine, but the remarkable taste is still there both in the nose and the feel. Makes me feel like a very very rich IPA... the richness of the hops is amazing, perhaps with Sierra's trademark Cascades? If I had to compare it to something, perhaps it is similar to the Arrogant Bastard Ale - and this should tell it all: it is amazing! An excellent beer this is, Sierra did a great job again.

140,2671,poisoneddwarf,3.97,"2009 backlog. Beer rating # 100 on Ratebeer. 12 oz bottle. 2009 vintage. Ah, Bigfoot! For beer #100 I had to review the beer that got me hooked on craft beer about 10 years ago. This vintage isn’t as great as past years. That first year (1998 or 1999) was a standout. So was 2008, their anniversary edition. This year’s isn’t as exceptional as those examples, but it’s pretty damn good. Aroma is of bananas, spiced apples, caramel--strong malty presence. Pours a huge head with good lacing. Dark copper hue. Light carbonation. Initially sweet, turns bitter. The bitterness and strong alcohol presence linger. This is still my favorite barleywine. ----- 2/14/10. Vertical tasting of the 2009 and 2010 vintages. This is my re-rank (and comparison with the 2010) of the 2009 vintage. 7/5/8/5/17 (4.2 total score). 12 oz bottle. Aroma of caramel, Christmas spices; malty. Murky amber hue. Medium dissipating head with nice lacework (better than the ’10). Mellow, awesome maltiness on the tongue. Starts out sweet, finishes bitter. Medium carbonation. ----- Ranking of the 2010 vintage (and comparison with the 2009): 7/4/9/5/17 (4.2 total). 12 oz bottle. Much hoppier aroma than the ’09. Lots of citrus. Not as murky as the ’09, but the same hue. Way hoppier than the ’09. Not as complex. Medium carbonation. ----- In summary, drinking these two beers back to back, I prefer the ’10 because it’s hoppier, although it’s really freaking close. I think the ’10 will mellow in a year and be much like the ’09 tastes now. The ’09 is more complex, and more interesting, but not as drinkable. This beer is meant to be aged, though, so I’m thinking the ’09 is closer in taste to what the brewers want it to taste like in the end.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

As this had probably sat on the shelf at store temp for 3 years, I was a little unsure about buying it, but decided to give it a try as this beer should age well.  The previous copy of this beer I had was fresh from the brewery, and I found the extreme bitterness too strong for my taste. The barrel-aged version; however, is one of my favorite beers. Upon trying this 3-year shelf-aged sample, I found the extreme bitterness tamed quite a bit; not quite to the barrel-aged level, but very, very good!  Poured into Teku at 47F. On first sip, I got a dark oily flavor that I didn't really appreciate, but that mostly faded as I proceeded through the glass. The strong, but mellowed bitterness leaves a strong, long lasting aftertaste that wears very well. I drank this yesterday, and am still thinking about it. This was very similar to the barrel-aged version, just without the wood flavors.  Barley wines have great bitterness, without the hoppy flavor of an IPA; which is one of the reasons I like this style. They are also high ABV, which stimulates the toungue, and adds a dreaminess to the flavor.

Color was Coppery-Brown (SRM = > 17, < 22) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was boozy with a minty, piney quality. As I said, this bottle is young and will undoubtedly smooth out, given sufficient time. Mouthfeel was big and thick, like a dollop had been scooped onto my tongue. Ahhh! It burns! Well, kind of, anyway. It was definitely a young version of this beer, evincing a lot of fusel alcohol heat to go along with all of those piney, minty hops. Phew! The hops were really overwhelming the malts at this stage in its development, but I will agree with their mention of ""bittersweet"". This was definitely an American Barleywine. Finish was dry, hot, boozy & evocative of another nap. Jeez-o, man, I just awoke from one! This is no playin' around.  And now, a 2016 vintage on M, 19 June 2017.  I Pop!ped this 1.5 year-old cap and commenced the gentlest pour possible. It was clearly not done fermenting as the head just kept rising during the pour to create a finger of creamy, dense, layered, deep-tan/light-brown head with phenomenal retention. Color was Brown to Dark Brown (SRM = > 22, < 27) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had begun to take on a leathery quality. Mouthfeel was surprisingly thin-to-medium, not watery, but close. The hops, while still minty, had begun to fade, giving rise to an alcohol heat underlain by that leathery, bready maltiness noted on the nose. I felt like it was still in its early stages, much more hoppy than I would like in a Barleywine, even if it was of an American bent. The hops have to fade & die at some point, which is why I actually prefer the English Barleywines, even as a hophead. Finish was dry, mainly due to the unrelenting heat of the alcohol. I am sure that it will die down like the embers of a fire.  Next up, a 2013 vintage again on M, 19 June 2017.  The Pop! of the cap was uneventful, so I commenced a VERY gentle pour. It quickly became clear that it had lost none of its carbonation as I garnered better than a finger of dense, foamy, deep-tan/light-brown head with fantastic retention. Color was a gorgeous Coppery-Brown (SRM = > 17, < 22) with NE-quality clarity. It had the same rusty sheen as the hair on my beloved Linda Lou who I lost to a deployment as she married another man. Sigh. Mouthfeel was medium with a carbonated quality that seemed to scrub my tongue. The taste was STILL driven by pine & evergreen, underlain by the emerging leatheriness. OMFG! How long does it take?!? Finish was still rather hot & in need of more aging! Wow.  It is now T, 20 June 2013 & Mr. Peabody's WAYBAC machine takes us to 2005!  No head, even with a swirl. Color has deepened to a Brown to Dark Brown (SRM = > 22, < 27) and the clarity is crystal-clear. Nose has an anise aspect to accompany the leatheriness that has been common throughout. Mouthfeel was soft, very lightly carbonated, but the alcohol heat was becoming very pronounced. The taste was extremely leathery with undercurrents of dried dark fruits like currants, prunes & raisins. Finish was now as dry as any sherry. Phew!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ABabbidge,3.99,"2017 version, reviewed about 4 months after bottling.  L: Reddish-brown body with a creamy light tan head.  S: I get mostly caramel malt. A little bit of pine and some raisins and other dark fruits.  T: Pretty intense flavor. A good play back and forth between the caramel like malts and bitterness of the hops. Hops are very bitter and intense with a lot of pine and earthy notes. Although it is pretty intense, it seems to be balanced pretty well.  F: Pretty full bodied and creamy. Lingering bitterness/dryness.  O: As excepted, this is very bitter as young as it is. There are some definite fruity undertones that I think might be more pronounced if this had a year or two to age. I'll try to find out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,princessbay710,4.53,"Transparent brown. Amazingly sweet smell. Taste is like a strange fruit I've never tried. A bit too strange. Dark malts, slightly winey finish. All in all it's not quite what I was expecting or what I've gotten from other barleywines.  Edit: This beer is incredible this go around, has characteristics similar to a porter but instead of the caramel, coffee, cocoa malts it's much more fruity and refreshing, alongside excellent carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Hoppy_Time,4.2,"Aged just over a year:  Pours a deep coppery Brown with a one finger off white head. Dissipates within a couple minutes to a little veil of bubbles and a halo. Some alcohol legs.  Aromas of rich toffee and malt, dates, prunes, sweet dark fruit. Lesser notes of caramel, brulee, papaya, and a hint of nuttiness.  Taste is sweet dark fruit up front, mostly prunes and dates, some raisin, caramel, toffee, and some of that nuttiness that came through on the nose. Then as the sweetness mellows out the bitter starts to come through, playing on flavors of black tea, rooibos, dark chocolate, burnt sugar, peat, and pine. It's a rather bold bitterness drawing off from both char and herbal qualities.  It's light to medium bodied, fairly smooth with a light tingly carbonation. Slightly astringent and a touch of heat from the alcohol.  This is a very bold and classic American Barleywine, starting off similar to it's English brethren but bursting with bitterness on the finish. It's a sipper but not incredibly intricate. My favorite part is the tea like flavors as the sweetness fades and the bitterness enters.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Reema,4.36,"Serving type: 12 oz bottle of 2017 poured into a tulip glass  Look is a deep amber copper color with a medium amount of turbidity. Smell is of intense pine, slight melon/cantelope, with a sweet bready malt scent coming through. Mild amount of sweet caramel intermingles. No alcohol detected. Taste reflects the smell. Intense initial pine and earthy hops lead into a splendid caramel and sweet fruit flavor. Finishes with a great mix of sweet caramel malt and a small but lingering bitterness. Some alcohol head is present if you really look for it but it does not detract from the beer. Feel is semi-thick, chewy, it fits the sweeter elements of the beer. Overall, this is a really good beer with great flavors that I imagine will mellow over time. Fresh, it's a treat. Fresher, I would imagine it's even more of a treat.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,aleigator,4.17,"Bigfoot 2015 on feb 2017  Pours a glowing red color with a big, fluffy beige head.  Smells of caramel, ripe oranges, dried wild berries, wood bark and fresh cut lemons.  Has a soft, lower carbonation, displaying a medium bodied beer, which has a convincing balance to it, although the finish in this is pushing it, in regards of its bitter hop impact.  Tastes of toffee malts, glazed caramel and bakers chocolate, together with an earthy note, from which slowly a herbal dryness evolves. Its midpalate is still defined by the malts, but now the hops are easily recognizable for their leafy lemon bite. The finish is a complete turnover, it is utmost bitter and dry, with a ripe, malt accompanied fruitiness cutting through.  Wow, this is intense. The beer has a marvellous taste evolution. While it begins like a regular barley wine, sweet, fruity and malty, it finishes unexpectedly dry with a bitter fruit note to it. Very well made and outstandingly well build, everything comes together perfectly in this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,TBoneJones,4.31,"Copper pour with sticky thick off-white head, lacing aplenty. Nothing more needed in looks in a glass. Nose is hops, all pine goodness, and a hint of fruit esters. Taste is a full-on harmony of hops and underlying malts, the latter of which don't bring forth much sweetness like I usually like in a barleywine, however the balance of this big stuff is very nice given the huge hop presence. Fruit is a far away hint, malts are in check, and with the hops the end result gives me the impression of a Sierra Nevada Celebration IPA crossed with a Sierra Nevada Hoptimum. Nothing complex, but so well-made. Each sip brings more hints of fruit: crisp cherry-apple. Medium-bodied and some oily/ smooth, bitterness. Just a bunch of big tasty beer with ample raw hops. I'm certain this would be a perfect 5-across the board on a couple years + of aging, but in my book there's no trouble detecting a high quality beer no matter how early it's cracked open.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

New label looks great and love the six instead of four pack. Pours a garnet, ruby body with a bubbly head. My god the aroma - huge hops (pine, grapefruit, spruce) and doughy malt. Forgot how hop-forward this is. Taste (after it warms a bit) is an upfront burst of pine, grapefruit, blood orange proceeding to candied fruit, honey, dark fruit and roasted malt.

Smelled of coconut, marzipan, cherries, alcohol, prunes, and almonds. The smell was right down to the nose: cherries, prunes, figs, some slight funk and dry spice, grass, and a grimy tobacco aftertaste; there was even some alcohol in the flavor as well. It seemed off and perhaps it's because it's a 3 year-old bottle. It was chewy and full-bodied. A slight dirty feel. It was okay.

Very astringent with notes of bitter pine sap and grapefruit upfront. The sweetness of the malt slowly creeps in - it's quite savory and chewy.

Body is a reddish mahogany color with a rocky, off-white head. Not much lacing or head retention here but I wouldn't expect that from a higher alcohol beer. Smells like over ripe fruit, caramel, and alcohol. Taste is super complex, I actually had some taste bud fatigue afterwards. Lots of dark fruit (raisins, plums), very rich caramel, wood, smoke, chocolate, leather...it's also much hoppier than I thought it would be, although I imagine some of that's faded by now. Getting some resinous and citrus type bitterness. It's overall extremely sweet, but the hops add enough bitterness to keep it from feeling too heavy. It's a good thing too, because this beer borders on a syrupy mouthfeel and needs all the lightening up it can get. Not unpleasantly syrupy in small doses (this isn't a beer you want to exactly chug anyway), and overall pretty smooth and creamy considering the ABV. Alcohol presence is definitely noticeable, a little like scotch.

Not sweet, nor dry, but a very complex melange of very nice things.  Taste: Malt, yes, malt with an advanced college degree. Too complex for simple notes to stand out yet hops are present supporting the rich malt, no hint of roasted malt bitterness but the same full malt character of a good Stout without really tasting anything like a Stout. There is the dark fruit ripeness of a great Belgian, fullness of a Doppelbock, yet something entirely different as if the best of Old World strong beers came to our shores and became changed, updated, without giving up the heritage.

Smell: Nice hop aroma, largely citrus, but some earthy hops are noticeable.  Taste: Smooth. Nice hop flavor right off the bat, followed by a caramel malt flavor. For such a big beer the alcohol is absurdly well blend.  Mouthful: Very nice smooth body. Medium carbonation.  Overall: This is an outstanding American Barleywine. Nicely hopped, but not over-hopped.

Taste substantial malts, lots of caramel and toffee, but definitely unsweetened. Giant hop amounts. So good, evolves into something sweeter. Sticky when warm, but a massive hop blast. Can make you forget how strong it is until it is too late. Very bitter, but all those malt notes keep it from being problematic, in fact, this beer is quite awesome. Been drinking this for 20 years. Never gonna stop. Unless they stop 4/6 packing it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,TH28,4.1,"12oz bottle. 12/4/15 bottle date. Appearance: Reddish brown in color, slight haze, and a beige khaki foam head. Aroma: Rich maltiness of bread crusts and toffee. Light citrusy hop aromas as well. Taste: Deep, rich maltiness. Bready and caramel up front, giving way to more of a toasty and toffee flavor. Sharp, strong bitterness hits on the back end with citrus and pine. Overall flavors are very fresh and sharp. Mouthfeel: Medium heavy body with some chewiness, with a light carbonation. Strong alcohol heat. Finish: Sharp flavor of the beer lasts long past the swallow. Malt forward for sure, with some caramel and toast, as well as a strong resinous bitterness. Overall: The label is absolutely right, this is a beast of a beer. Strong, rich, boozy maltiness from the start with multiple layers of caramel, bread, toast, and toffee. Citric hop bitterness is very strong and does a good job of standing up to the malt. This beer is 4 months old, and the intensity is very high, almost overpowering.

It smells of caramel, raisin, and malt, with some floral hops.You can also smell the alcohol. The first taste is dark, sweet fruit (raisin, cherry), followed by malt, pine, and then a very hoppy, bitter finish. This ale is quite thick and syrupy in its feel and it seems boozier than its 9.6% ABV would indicate.

Outstanding nose of fruit (plum, raisin, grape), caramel and light citrus hops over a subtle spruce spiciness. As it warms, notes of alcohol emerge.  Light medium body with a smooth texture. Below normal carbonation with very little effervescence even in the finish.  The flavor profile is outstanding with balance being the strongest suit. The flavors are rich and deep beginning with bitterness that flows into a nice caramel sweet middle. As the sweetness fades, fruit flavors emerge but don't separate very much.

A mild pine centered bitterness lingers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Certainly the hoppiest Barleywine I've ever had.

140,2671,dd43,4.02,"I have not had many barleywine style beers so I was eager to give this category classic a whirl. The beer had a pretty substantial amount of nice looking yellowed white head on top of the rich, well filtered auburn liquid below. Big boozy aromas of caramel and toffee commingled with a pronounced spruce note. The flavor was quite a bit more bitter than I was expecting. This was a fairly fresh 2016 bottle so the hop punch was definitely all up in my grill piece. I would love to get a few more bottles of this to let them age for a while. I want those hops to recede and let the malts shine a lot more. I'm also curious to know where Sierra nevada's rendition of the American barleywine fits in the style bucket. Are they typically quite bitter and hoppy or is Bigfoot an outlier? More delicious research must be done and I'm just the guy to do it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,jvgoor3786,4,"I'm reviewing a 2017 bottle. The beer pours a deep brown color with tons of rich, off-white head. The head slowly disappated leaving nice lacing.  The smell is huge caramel malts. There is a decent amount of dark fruits and maybe a hint of hops.  The taste is very forward on the dark fruits with the caramel jumping in quickly the dominate the middle and end of the flavor. The caramel is sweet on the end with a little lingering bitterness also.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with and the carbonation of fairly light.  Overall a great beer. I'm excited to try some older versions to see how the bitterness mellows out.  Review of a five year old 2016:  Pours an opague, slightly orangish tan color with almost no head and minimal lacing.  The smell explodes with caramel then molasses and dark fruits.  The taste is still slightly bitter dark fruits, orange, orange zest, and caramel on the finish.  The mouthfeel is medium/low carbonation, medium body, and slightly oily.  Overall, this is smooth, complex, and very enjoyable at five years old.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Sweet barley grains and malt notes open up the front end, with bitter, piney hop notes biting off the end. Mouth feel is a little harsh as far as carbonation, but finishes smoothish. A little bit lacking here. Overall, a solid barleywine style ale. The hop presence is notable. Not incredibly sweet due to the hop presence. Still worth trying.

140,2671,twage04,4.43,"Pours a dark red or ruby with medium or slightly slower than medium carbonation. The smell is of booze, bourbon, figs, resinous piney hops. Taste is much of the same, with some deep bitterness and some dark fruit, bourbon and booze there too. I really wouldn't compare this to a double ipa, the hop flavor really doesn't dominate here and the other qualities for this beer remind you of old ales, belgian dark strongs just with an intense bitterness and resinous hop flavor. Very enjoyable, complex beer to sip on. This one was fresh, from 2016. Compared to the bourbon barrel aged one I tried at the sierra nevada restaurant, this one had sharper flavors. The barrel aged version was still fairly bitter but the bourbon and dark fruit were center stage.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,LAp,4.01,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter shaped wine glass. Pours a clear ruby-russet, with a one finger tan head, which quickly recedes, leaving trace lacing. The nose is very hop-forward...perhaps too much so. Present also however are medicinal elements of raspberry and grape. This beer at first smells closer to an APA than a barleywine, though deeper smells more congruent with the named style emerge after a little time. The palate opens with the boozy malt of a barleywine, which is at first surprising, as the nose indicates anything but a classic English barleywine, but these grape, malt, and booze elements are quickly accompanied by the classic Sierra Nevada hop taste: the same as is found in their signature Pale Ale, in Hop Hunter, and many of their other more astringent ales. These hops don't do the beer any favors, but as I've progressed through the four-pack this week, I find them less noticeable, and less distracting from a good barleywine that hides underneath. In that way, it's not dissimilar from Devil's Milk from DuClaw - an equally (perhaps overly) hopped barleywine. Mouthfeel is an appropriate medium-thick, creamy that accompanies the high ABV and deeper flavors well, though there's perhaps a little more carbonation hiding in this beer than I find ideal for the style. Overall, not a bad beer, and a reasonably priced 4-pack.  More generally speaking: I was very underwhelmed with this beer when I had the first bottle of the four pack - it tasted like a barleywine made by a company who doesn't know how to make anything without ""pale ale"" in the title. The more I've had though, the more the beer has grown on me. As the beer warms, the hop presence recedes, and reveals a quality, dark fruit, boozy barleywine underneath.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ScottJJ,4.77,"I looked this up expecting a less than perfect rating for two reasons; it's Sierra Nevada which overall isn't a favorite of mine, and barleywines are for us sophisticated drinkers and most people think they taste like a foot in your mouth-hence the name.

140,2671,Beginner2,3.85,"I should recognize success when I drink it. And, it is in this bottle. But the different drummer in me wants to say that hops, ultimately, are the servant of malt... especially in this style. Not here. Not in this barleywine. I'm not flowing with the mainstream, in part because the hops dominate and prevent this barleywine from helping most deserts or food in general.  I thought I should cellar part of the six-pack I bought. I drank one a year. I noticed mellowing in the ale, but that didn't interpret directly to my palate. I could not get my mind open to this one. After the fifth, I gave the sixth away to a hop-head.  Bigfoot is on the ""1001"" list, but I beg to differ. Bigfoot also is reviewed in Roger Protz' CAMRA classic ""300 Beers To Try Before You Die!"" MJ's 1990s review gave this 4 of 4 stars (maybe 2% in his ""Guide' win 4 stars.) Maybe, its me.

Appearance: Pours a brownish-red, with half a finger of light tan head that fades to islands of froth with a big bubbly mass of froth in the middle. Some carbonation visible, with a little haze and a little sediment. Lacing is modest, retention is pretty good for the style.  Smell: Immediate burst of hops, alcohol, and malt. Smells very sweet and chewy. Like an orange marmalade jelly donut. Hints of strawberry and caramel. Perhaps less hop here than I expected, but that is by no means a criticism.  Taste: Immediate sweetness on the arrival, turns to a hoppy malt center, then immediate taste of alcohol is present. Smooths out to a caramel and malty ending, then a firm bitterness that is not quite as medicinal as other American barleywines I've had. Finish carries some lingering resin and pine, but not nearly as potent as one might expect, and not unpleasant at all. More bitter/resiny and less fruity than Lagunitas Olde Gnarlywine.  Mouthfeel: Decidedly full-bodied, but not heavy. Remarkably clean, little slickness. Moderate carbonation.  Overall: This is what I was in the mood for, and this is what I got. The alcohol is strong on this one, but I imagine that will settle down with time - three in the cellar settling down. This is far more hop-forward than other strong ales or English barleywines I've had, but is also more drinkable than many.

140,2671,nbbyrd,5,"For my first official Beer Advocate beer review, I’ve pulled out a special beer for a special occasion. This is the last 2013 Bigfoot Barleywine that I have been holding on to as my first attempt at cellaring/aging a beer. Thinking back to 2013 when I first bad this beer, I remember the strong and biting bitterness of the hops and warmth from the alcohol that overwhelmed my palate at the time. As time and experience with other beers have developed my palate, I am really looking forward to what time has done to this cornerstone of a beer for me. So here we go! Look: 12 oz bottle poured semi-aggressively into a tulip glass, a beautiful rich mahogany red with two fingers of a light tan head, a few floaties that have settled from aging. Tight and pillowy at first, the head dissipates to a half inch of larger soapy bubbles in the center and creamy froth around the rim after about five minutes, leaving wonderful lacing. Smell: Immediately caramel hits the nose, with very ripe dark fruits following. Hints of sweet raisins and port wine. Hardly any traces of citrus or piney hops. A completely different creature after 3 years. Taste: Caramel, cream, vanilla, leather, dark candied fruits. Maybe a nice mild aromatic pipe tobacco? The booze is nowhere to be found in such a big beer compared to its younger self. Only slightly resinous with a hint of mature pine. Really a lovely sweetness like a fresh warm fruitcake. The perfect amount of sweetness and balanced bitterness. Feel: So very smooth and creamy. Perfectly balanced and still a great medium carbonation. Such a soft and subtle bitterness that lingers on the middle and back of my tongue before disappearing like a dream. It coats the mouth and leaves a delicate bitterness aftertaste reminiscent of citrus, like subtle grapefruit pith. Overall: One of the most lovely beers I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. The harsh bitterness and sharp edges from 2013 have smoothed and mellowed over time, making this a treat to enjoy on a stormy February evening. It is amazing what time can do to a beer. Being my first (and only at the moment) beer to have aged, I can’t wait to grab a few more bottles of various others to store away for another few years. While I would rate the young and raw version of this beer a 3.43, the 3 year aged version has blown me away beyond my expectations 5/5.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Look: Gorgeous just barely off-white and silky head sits atop. About an inch of head and isn't going anywhere soon. The liquid a deep ruby with brown tones. This is a beautiful beer!  Smell: Some alcohol phenols and hops on the first sniff. Delve a little deeper and some dark fruits and maltiness pop up. Sweet and enticing aroma.  Taste: A complex one on the tastebuds. First hit is that fresh-hop bite. As it moves over the palate the sweetness opens up and dark fruits (raisins, plums, figs) come to mind. After-taste has it giving way to how big this beer is, although well-hidden, as it warms your body.  Feel: Moderate carbonation, just right for this beer. The mouthfeel is silky and smooth and dangerously drinkable for almost being 10%  Overall: Couldn't be happier having this beer as my first official BA-review.

Taste: Sweet malts and sour fruits up front, but soon drowned out by bitter hops and caramel, which all blend into the aftertaste. Some minor alcohol taste is present, without being boozy, and without burning.  Overall: This is my first Barleywine style of beer, without being barrel aged. Pretty enjoyable, with a great balance of bitter hops and sweet malts. The ABV of this beer is concealed pretty well, although still noticeable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

S: Brown sugar and molasses mingling with piney hops.  T/F: Malty and smooth... caramel, brown sugar, and raisins. Strong hop presence so fits right in with the West Coast barleywine's. Evergreen and mild citrus. Creamy on the mouthfeel and warming. High ABV and it shows... but enough balance to keep it tasteful.  O: A big west coast barleywine that stacks up with the best of them.

140,2671,tekstr1der,4.16,"Pours a cloudy, ruddy brown with thin tan head. Aroma is fantastic - malty with booze and a touch of piney hop. Flavor has a more pronounced bitter that takes the forefront, with slight malt sweetness almost balancing.

Flavor is just a spot on america barleywine. That perfect balance of huge bitter with massive sweetness - warming boozy note works perfectly.  Feel is fantastic - carbonation level doesn't add too much bitterness, appropriately lifts this dense brew off the palate. Finish is long on the bitter which just makes the next sip happen faster.  This is a fantastic beer - for the price and availability it's nearly impossible to beat. Those aspects factor into the high marks but it truly is a world class brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Beaconheath,4.5,"2015 ""vintage,"" bottled 12/31/14, tasted January 2016, in a Libbey tulip glass, 45–50°F. Clear dark amber with a one-finger head that dissipated in a few minutes but regenerated with each swirl. Potent fragrance filled the air around the glass at once to a radius of several feet. Flavor dominated by the piney element in the Chinook hops, which floated over the malt base without integrating with it. Will appeal to those who appreciate prominent Pacific northwest hops. Weighty mouthfeel, beverage coated the throat. Overpowered the homemade burrito I paired it with, but it was nice with a dessert of Medjool dates. Sweetness of the dates took some edge off the hoppiness and brought out the malt.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,Ahypercube,4.61,"Wow, SN never ceases to amaze me.  L: Pours a rich, dark reddish caramel color, like coca cola. Two-fingers of thick, luscious, toasted cream-colored head, which builds slowly and lasts well, leaving rather attractive cocoa-colored lacing. A beautiful brew.  S: Molasses, caramel, alcohol, candied dark fruit (Plum, raspberry, cherry, etc), toasted rye bread, and a nutty whole-grain scent; a little hint of piney hops, and a clean grapefruit rind presence.  T: Those bitter hoppy flavors are much more noticeable, with the avalanche of malty, caramelly, toasty sweetness cascading over the bitter skeleton, fleshed out with a sugary blackberry-jam-on-toast flavor. Almost just like a stout, but missing the coffee and chocolate. Definitely something I enjoyed immensely. I would pair with any pastry, or a rich stew, or simply cheese and crackers.  F: Someone commented that the mouthfeel was a little thin. I'm rather blown away by this comment, as it seems as thick as could be possibly expected for the ABV. A lot like Torpedo IPA, but thicker and bitterer.  O: Excellent. If this is any sort of example, I'd say barleywines are definitely a thing I enjoy.

140,2671,havron,4.01,"12 oz bottle with a packaged date of 01/28/15. Sipped from a tulip by a bonfire just shy of a year later. May not have actually aged for the full year as was bought cold about a week ago, so who knows how long it actually spent out of refrigeration.  L: Pours a slightly hazy deep orange-red with yellow highlights, which transforms into an absolutely gorgeous ruby red by firelight. Active carbonation leaves a thin but persistent ring of off-white head leaving reasonably sticky lacing on par for the hoppiness and ABV.  S: Sugary caramel malts and grapefruity citrus hops are the primary aromatic notes, along with a healthy dose of pine. Alcohol is present in the nose and increases as the beer warms. I'm also detecting a bit of a burnt wood quality, but I am fairly certain that's just the bonfire...  T: Sweet and malty, as a barleywine should be. Grapefruit, lemon, pine, and a light whole-cone grassiness from the hops, and in good quantity; this is unlikely to have sat anywhere near room temperature for an appreciable time over this past year. Astringent bitterness persists throughout the taste and the alcohol is quite noticeable but not overly harsh, especially considering how relatively young this bottle is. Some fruity esters and phenolic components are detectable but kept in check. A mild barrel-like quality on the backend alongside lingering pine resin.  F: Medium-bodied and a bit on the watery side for a barleywine. Hopefully will thicken with some aging. Carbonation is solid and prickly, giving the dominant hops a good kick in the cones.  O: This is a solid barleywine and not bad for a young specimen. Looking forward to seeing what a little age will do to this beer, especially considering the relatively light mouthfeel, fairly strong alcohol presence, and boisterous hop intensity. The rest of the four pack is already put away in the ""cellar"", and I may just grab another quartet to join them before the imminent 2016 release.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

REVIEW OF 2016 fresh Bigfoot (bottled 12/4/15 and in my fridge for a few months now, it's 3/21/16): -certainly more bold than the 11 month old 2015, this certainly mellows with age. which is why i bought 2 4packs, 1 for now and 1 for later. also my local store was selling 2014 Bigfoot for the same price as 2016 Bigfoot so i picked it up to test out. -the hops are much more prevalent than the aged barleywine, a nice strong ale almost Brown Shugga flavor to it.  2014: much more mellow. looks like cider. very malty yet has subtle and beautiful hop flavor. and has an amazing flavor. this is amazing with age, holy shit. i'm keeping my 2016 bottles in my cellar for a while now. slight char to it as well. really fantastic.  i am enjoying this! a great barleywine. a great balance, i enjoy the combination this beer has between sweetness and bitterness. almost has a slight barrel taste to it. a great beer, my new favorite barleywine.  2017, less than a year from bottling.

140,2671,Sabtos,3.51,"Cloudy red-copper with a bubbly, pinkish-tan uniform two-finger froth.  Smell is hoppy pine with a mixture of toffee and butterscotch.  Taste is sweet red fruit and caramel with light grape.  Full and frothy, this is soft and smooth for a Barleywine, and the only heat I really detect is in my earlobes.  These most recent review notes are for vintage 2016 on draft at the taproom in NC, in March 2017.  ---  In mid-January 2021, I had the pleasure of opening my own 12oz bottle of 2010 Bigfoot. My first impression of its vibe was that of a very old school Hardy's sort of brew, but still with a bit more hop punch, even 11 years later. I perceive a darker red wine grape pairing with gingersnap and graham biscuit, lit up by a touch of fiery pine in the exhale.  The second sip adds a bit of char, while the slick, medium-light body contains a fine, minimal carbonation despite it's notably tall khaki head, for its age, which slowly settles to a root beer float island, leaving all kinds of cobweb lacing. To continue to flesh out its appearance, the body is a clear reddish-brown, nearing a cherry wood varnish, but for maybe a little haze. As it warms, I actually taste a sort of peppery cologne at times, if only in glancing hints.  While this was a more enjoyable experience than I remember fresher vintages being, I'm ultimately going to keep my score where it's at now, as it's unfair to increase the score of a beer based on an older vintage.  ---  At the end of the month I killed off my 2011 vintage as well, which I found to be much worse for wear, tasting overall mustier, hoppier, drier and more estery than the 2010 I had a few weeks ago.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Dravin,4.5,"Poured aggressively into a Duvel tulip. Bottle dated 12/04/14.  Look -- Three fingers of tight light khaki head reduce to a single finger that lingers. It has nice lacing and the color of the body of the beer is a slightly murky deep amber.  Smell -- Resinous hop aroma with very faint hints of grapefruit in the back. Caramel sweetness coming through and absolute no hint of booze. I'm sure the hops have faded since the beer is a year old but there is still plenty left in the tank.  Taste -- Similar to the nose, resinous hops with faint grapefruit, caramel, and lots of bitterness. The booze hides once again.  Feel -- Low carbonation, possibly partial due to the aggressive pour, and a medium body. It has heft without being cloying. It's just a delight to sip on feeling wise.  Overall -- A nice hoppy barelywine that has aged just fine. It hide the boozes like a ninja so combined with how sippable it is it could easily sneak up on you if you weren't prepared.

T: Very hop-forward with just enough malt to balance it out. Classic American C-variety hops bursting with grapefruit and pine. Long bitter finish.  F: Medium-full, creamy. Medium carbonation which adds to the creamy mouthfeel. Practically no perceptible booze.

140,2671,cauchonpa,4.84,"I purchased a six pack of the 2012 Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale from Once Upon a Vine in Richmond, Virginia, on April 6, 2012. What followed was a worthwhile test of patience. After three and a half years later, this ale is absolutely superb.  A (4.75): Poured into a tulip glass. Cloudy red amber color with a creamy white head tinged with the slightest bit of honey gold at its edges. The head dissipates quickly, leaving almost no lacing. When held to a light, the ale glows a rusty orange.  S (5.00): Incredibly complex. While pouring, the ale surprises you with a strong malty sweetness with a good bit of cherry and spice. Upon further nosing, the hops that have been subdued over the past few years become evident; mostly piney but with the ever slightest hint of citrus. Alcohol hides behind candied fruit and honey, which certainly take center stage, starting (again) with cherry and working through raspberry and raisin to a sweet almost chocolaty allspice aroma. Everything is subtle and balanced.  T (4.75): Fruit tartness is offset by a molasses sweetness. The taste is flat compared to the smell, but isn't disappointing. More candied fruit that turns into malty sweetness after warming. Molasses lingers on the tongue.  M (5): Take the first sip quickly before the head dissipates for an incredibly smooth and creamy feel that dissolves into a slight dryness. The ever slightest bit of carbonation appear on the roof the mouth but not on the tongue. After the ale settles, there's a viscosity to it that doesn't offend, like very thin syrup.  O (4.875): I wholeheartedly suggest cellaring this ale for at least 18 months. I haven't done a vertical, and I'm not sure how much longer it would have held on after 3.5 years, but it's definitely fantastic after some time to balance and mellow out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

However I resampled this beer with almost a year of age on it and it improves significantly. The initial hop bitterness which I did not care for is still present, just in a much more subdued and muted way. The malt is allowed to come out into the forefront. Much more enjoyable.

Edit:had been sitting in the dark part of my favorite liquor store for about 8-9 months, which are decently close to cellaring conditions. Look: Absolutely stunning color. It's a deep red amber. Fine, smallish head that leaves sticky laces on the glass as I drink. I'm not exaggerating when I say this is easily one of the most attractive beers I've ever seen. Love the presentation; the cap Smell: Candy of some sort? Fruits. Good or bad, alcohol presence is there. Taste: Lives up to its name. Tastes like fruit (plum?), with an aftertaste of wine. Big hop presence, but not bitter at all, and it definitely doesn't detract from the other flavors. There's a lot here in the malts. Listed as 90 IBU, which surprised me. Very rich and balanced, with both sweet and bitter flavors. Feel: medium just on the border of heavy bodied. Sticky, clinging finish that makes you want to drink it slow. Considering the abv, this is a good thing. Overall: I did some research, and apparently these are in a similar category to the ""winter warmer"", which is by far my favorite style. This lived up to my expectations of being its more bitter, stronger cousin. Definitely going to be my go-to for cold weather drinking.

Full mouth feel, long lingering bitterness overlaps the caramel toffee sweetness. Overall, this is a great beer, now that's not to say I will be searching it out again; it's that caramel sweetness and that over-steeped tea bag flavor that old D/IPA's get.

140,2671,HopsAreDaMan,4.02,"12oz. 2015 vintage (bottled 2/11/2015): 7 months old to date. I had this right after trying the Lagunitas Gnarlywine at about the same age.  Poured a nice frothy head (similar to Gnarlywine), with a light amber color. Has a lot going on in the aroma: alcohol, malts, dark fruit, and something else I like--and haven't found in any other beer--perhaps mint. Mouth-feel is light to medium. Lots of the flavors I find typical in barleywines: sweetness, dark fruits, not too much on the hoppy side, with a little bitterness in the finish (not in the Gnarlywine).  I have read lots about this barleywine in terms of it being a classic to cellar, so I have been looking forward to trying it with a bit of age on it.  In general, I like both Bigfoot and Gnarlywine. I really like the aroma of Bigfoot (a little better than Gnarlywine), but the flavor of this beer seems a little too much--too strong, too intense--at the moment, which I believe is commonly termed as 'too hot'. My guess is in another year or two the flavor will mellow out and surpass the flavor of Gnarlywine; but only time will tell, as I have a number of both currently cellaring.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,Beertsipper,4.4,"Small tan head. Smells of caramel, toffee, raisin, dates, hops, sweet malts, brown sugar. Taste follows the nose. For a beer that is supposed to be overly hop forward, I get more sweet malts and dark fruit like dates, figs, raisins and a good amount of sweetness. The alcohol shows up at the finish. As the beer warms, the dark fruits, toffee, and caramel becomes more pronounced. This bottle was nine months old. I am going to cellar the remaining three bottles for two years and might reserve another bottle for three years. Very good beer.

It’s a classic, and a standard of the style. Pours a wonderful warm malty-amber with a boquet that changes over time… from a orange/citrusy hop kick to a light toffee/toasted coconut. Big malt backing that develops toffee and chocolate notes over time as well, complementing the citrusy piney hop profile.  I’ve had this fresh and I’ve had this aged and I love it either way.

Initially an emphatic malt sweetness, but the hops bitterness (kind of like chewing on a bitter orange peel) kicks in almost immediately thereafter. But wait: that's followed by a caramel sweetness, and THAT'S followed by a piney, resinous finish. There's so much going on taste-wise that you don't even notice the alcohol (but trust me - it's there). Thick, sticky mouthfeel; moderate carbonation.

140,2671,hopphead31415,4.28,"I had been meaning to try this beer for a while as an avid Sierra Nevada fan. I should have tried it sooner as it is excellent. It does pack a powerful 9.6% ABV so be careful, but it is quite drinkable for such a strong brew and remember it is after all a barely wine. And lastly, this particular bottle pack that I picked up was almost 8 months cellared, so take that into account as you consider my review.  Look-It pours a reddish copper dark amber color that glints in the light with molten golden color hues. The head is delicate and quickly dissipates due to the sugar content. The lacing is also almost nonexistent, but that is to be expected. The color more than makes up for the lack of those other attributes.  Smell-It has a complex and strong malt-forward smell with yeast components as well as molasses, toffee, caramel, spices, pine, and maybe some bread pudding.  Taste-The hops are definitely present, but are equally balanced by a plethora of sweet dark fruits like candied cherry, plums, and smoked cedar. I also get walnuts and a nutty spice that reminds me of Christmas. The hops shine through strongest at the end with a heavy pine resin and maybe some clementine or grapefruit.  Mouthfeel-It is quite heavy, but not overwhelming and mildly syrupy with little carbonation. You get a sticky oil feeling that lingers like a hoppy resin at the end. It drinks so crisply for a powerful 9.6% brew and is really easy to finish.  Overall-This brew is excellent and belongs in front of a fancy movie scene which features a log cabin in the middle of the woods in a blizzard with a man holding a crystal goblet filled with this variety sitting in front of a big fireplace in a red leather chair perched upon a bear rug while absent-mindedly petting a bloodhound and smoking a Cuban cigar.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

LOOK: Clear, lightly reddish brown with a thin finger of off white head that leaves some lacing.  SMELL: Generically speaking, big complex malt and yeast aromas mixed with a big hop presence. Individually, I can smell molasses, caramel, toffee, some spices, tons of pine, and a hint of grapefruit and raisins. On to the taste!  TASTE: A massive intermingling of hops and malt. Caramel, toffee, brown sugar, toasted coconut, walnuts, gingerbread, and fruit cake galore, but kept in check by just enough bitterness. There's a rich, dark fruit presence--some cherries, plums, and raisins. Finishes hoppy with heavy pine and grapefruit. I love it!  FEEL: Medium-heavy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation and a sticky hop oil aftertaste. Drinks incredibly easy for 9.6% ABV.  OVERALL: I love this beer! I'm glad my first trying a barleywine was a good experience. This beer is both heavy as all get out, yet quite easy to drink at the same time. Simultaneously super malty and super hoppy.

140,2671,DabblinWiscCraft,4.08,"Grabbed a single 12 oz bottle as part of a mixed pack at my local Stein's Liquor. This one was packaged about six months ago. Poured at cellar temperature into my tulip glass.  L: Pours a deep burnt sienna with about two inches of dense tan head that persists for a good long while and leaves very nice lacing on the glass. Moderate visible carbonation at the edges where the light shines through.  S: Caramel and toasted malts are front and center. There are also nice notes of raisin, stone fruit, citrus rind, and pine. Just a little clear alcohol coming through. Very nice, if not especially assertive, bouquet.  T: Caramel and toasted malts provide a sweet initial flavor. The hops introduce themselves quite early, providing grapefruit rind and pine notes to complement the malts. In the middle there's also a development of some nice fruit flavors, including raisin, dried stone fruit, and pineapple. The back end is characterized by resinous hop flavor--grapefruit rind and pine. These bring a ton of bitter to the back end, though there is enough of the malts to keep them somewhat in check. Just a touch of clear alcohol at the close.  F: Medium-bodied, though perhaps not quite as heavy as would be expected from the style. Creamy and bright in turns. This one definitely has a bit of stick to it, but it's not overtly syrupy. Lots of lingering bitter on the palate from this one.  O: Having had a few very good barleywines, I was surprised to find this one as hop-forward as it is. Being a big fan of hops, I don't have much of a complaint, but I just don't think this one is quite well-representative of the style. That being said, it's delicious and well-worth a try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

It's very hoppy for a barleywine and doesnt hold up to the best beers in the style today. However, i have to put into consideration that this was first brewed in 1983. As others have mentioned, this reminds me more of an imperial red ale. If labeled as such, id easily give this a 4.5. As a barleywine, its closer to a solid 4.

Aroma: Strong, complex and delicious aromas of toasted malt, candied sugar, dried stone fruit such as apricots, plumbs and nectarines, as well as honey, spices of black pepper, saffron, coriander and a touch of ginger. There is also a touch of floral, piney, hops.  Taste: With two years age on it, it tastes very nice and complex! Tons of roasted malt and candied sugar up front, followed by the aforementioned spices of black pepper, saffron, coriander, ginger, as well as touches of nutmeg and all-spice. There is also quite a bit of the aforementioned dried stone fruit such as apricots, plumbs and nectarines, and finally, the beer finishes with some piney, floral, slightly resin-like, slightly bitter hops, but nothing out of balance or too assertive to muddle the other flavors. It’s a beautifully balanced beer!  Mouthfeel: Slightly chewy and pretty smooth as there is just a touch of carbonation. With an ABV of 9.6%, there is just a touch of an alcohol warmth on the palate, otherwise the alcohol is very well masked.  Overall: This was drunk with two years age on it, and it’s a very nice, very good American-style barley wine. Great flavors, nicely balanced hops.

140,2671,Libeertarian,4.43,"Purchased 8 Vintage 2015 in February/March. Plan on aging them and then adding onto this review once a year, as aroma and palate evolve.  05/02/15 Review:  Served at about 55°. Pours a deep, dark, semi-opaque copper capped with tapioca-colored head. Retention wasn't great, but that could just be the result of the glassware (snifter). Filming lace, on the other hand, was magnificent, sticking to the sides of the glass as well as the surface of the beer. Yeast dancing around the bottom of the glass. Hop aromas are sweet citrus, perfume, pine, and resin. Can't detect much from the grain on the nose. Caramel probably melds too much with hops, although perhaps the slightest toastiness is there. Sweet, caramel malt, some yeast character, and strong, dank fruity/floral hops in the lead. Overall, raisin-like, but bitter. Just as soon as you think these are sure bets, piney and spicy bitterness overtake them. Herbal, rindy notes and black pepper are hot on their heels as they lap and finish. Retro-olfaction brings out crushed mustard seed. A thin, metallic tasting lining of the mouth is soon all that remains. Very smooth, full-bodied, astringent and warming, with medium carbonation. A year is a long time to wait for another tasting.  05/02/16 Review:  May 2016: Served just over 60°, using same snifter. Copper with peach tones, semi-clear but hazy, thick, and dark with fine suspended particles. Beige, rocky, but even and creamy head of moderate retention. Alright lacing. Resin, raisin, pleasant perfume, spicy dankness, pepper, hot alcohol. Hops seem to have deteriorated somewhat, not a bad thing as long as booze, malt, and carbonation do their jobs. Pine, perfume, raisin, apricots to palate. Caramel with dark fruity, spirity sweetness and mild tea/leaf/leather-like bitterness throughout, with the addition of cloves and peppercorn come the finish. Medium-bodied, too well-carbonated to be syrupy, fine and tingly then creamy-smooth, plenty warming, and yet not as hot as expected. Looking forward to trying the 2015 again in another year (and 5 more after that, started with 8). Missed the 2016 so far this year, but I could still get lucky. Not as good as it was before (going by memory and past description) due to hop deterioration, but perhaps in another year or so that won’t be as much of an issue. Though I will keep my first score, for the sake of discussion, I would re-score this at 4.75, 4, 4.25, 4.5, 4.25. Improvement only in mouthfeel, with hop flavors and aromas deteriorating slightly as they would in an IPA or IIPA. Still plenty of room for improvement, as malt and yeast qualities age on alcohol in the years to come.  04/08/17 Review:  Last reviewed this, same vintage, almost a year ago and I still have a few more I will age even longer.  Deep dark copper, almost ruby, semi-opaque with heavy swirls of sediment and haze. Tight, sticky, wispy, foamy tan head of good retention. Dark fruit, berries, resin, wood, caramel, slight grain aromas. Palate is extreme! Hops are deteriorated, but subdued and good in the balance, perfumey if anything and all but losing themselves once the spicy booze has kicked in. Other than that we have plenty of dark fruit and a little toffee as well as some soil and strong woody flavor, which with the caramel and related malt notes approaches maple syrup, but thankfully not as sweet. Retro-olfaction is peppery at first but then you’re hit with a surprise of tropical and fortified wine qualities. While I would normally recommend such a hot beer in sips, you can actually avoid saturating your palate significantly by taking gulps here, although you may regret it later. Medium-bodied, but a bit lighter than expected. Warm, but deceptively cool for almost 10% ABV. Extra fine medium levels of carbonation, almost effervescence, gulpable, not sharp at all. Hard to compare, especially after two years, but this seems like it is slightly better than it is fresh, probably because I generally prefer what yeast does to what hops do, and the right threshold was met in 2017, albeit not in 2016. New score would be: 4.75, 4.5, 4.25, 4.75, and 4.5, but as always, I will keep the original.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,Gajo74,4.46,"This is a hearty and intense but drinkable bear that goes well alone or with a big meal. Pours a dark caramel or copper color. Big cream and foam slightly tan or off white head. Sticky lace retains through ought. Lots of complexity in the aroma. There are dark fruit in the nose as well as a sweet caramel, toffee and molasses type aroma. Later, there is some biscuity malt with a whiff of alcohol on the backend. Later still, some resiny oily hops come to the forefront. This brew is in many ways a tale of two palates. As with the aroma, at first the fruity and malty sweetness are felt on both the tongue and the finish. The feel is viscous, medium bodied to full and almost buttery.

140,2671,Shade1951,3.64,"Wow! How things change. A couple years ago, I thought this beer was the ""bees knees."" Now, though I still feel this is a very good beer, I'm not quite so in love with it. Here's why.  For me, this has way too much of a hop presence for a barleywine. I generally LOVE hops in things like IPA's. But for me, a barleywine should be minimally hoppy and its focus should be on flavors like sherry and bourbon and fruit. This particular beer is hop-infused throughout. As such, it tastes to me more like an IPA. A GOOD IPA - but an IPA nonetheless.  I don't know if the formula for this beer has changed, or if it's my taste buds. I suspect the latter.  This is a very good IPA. But, to my taste buds, it's really not a barleywine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The beer itself is a beautiful reddish deep amber that is very clear. The look is pretty gorgeous.  The beer smell is fairly fruity and hoppy with a bit of sweetness to it. The hops are more a light pine and citrus smell than anything. The malt smell is fairly sweet and fruity.  The beer taste is strongly hopped. The hops are mainly pine with a bit of citrus to it. The malt is strongly overshadowed by the ops but still manages to squeeze a tea and fruity flavor from it.  The mouthfeel is heavy but on the lighter side. The beer goes down smoothly. The beer is lightly carbonated and gives a nice tingling feel on the tongue.  Overall, a very good barleywine despite how hopped it is.

This one, however, did not leave me particularly impressed. Mostly sweet, but not with any real flavor behind it. Everything blended into an amalgam that rather than being balanced was simply dull. I can more easily forgive a beer being outright bad than I can dull.  Edit - boy have my tastes changed. I saw this and wanted to update to my current views. I now drink this beer often and adore it.

Smell - 3.75/5 A lot of resinous hops with some pine as well. A little bit of darker malt sugars. This is a barleywine-style ale, but it smells a little too hoppy from other instances of the style I've tried.  Taste - 3.75/5 Some major resin and pine flavors come in full force the first sip. Yet there is little bitterness. Rather, a mellowed out version of the flavor, very smooth. The malts are more discernable in the taste than they were in the smell. Still, I feel that the hop flavors are definitely dominant in the beer. Not exactly what I'm looking for in a barleywine, but I guess the hops is to be expected, given Sierra Nevada. It's not bad, just tastes more like a DIPA than a barleywine.  Mouthfeel - 4/5 This beer definitely drinkes super smooth, which is nice. Medium bodied, with a lighter amount of light-medium intensity carbonation.

Pours a dark amber/hazy ruby color with lots of bubbles. 2 finger off-white head of sticky foam. Smells of malt, raisins, grapefruit, honey, with a slight hoppiness. Mouthfeel is quite dense, almost like a stout. Taste is bitter hops, caramel, bready malt, and grapes/raisins. I should add that as this beer warmed up, it became much more malt-forward when it hit my tongue. Very interesting evolution in a short amount of time. I get citrus and malt on the back end with a doughy aftertaste.  This is probably once of the most balanced barleywines I've had so far. It's incredibly smooth and easy to drink for 9.6%. Hell, I'm on my second one and I just finished my dinner. I've always been a fan of Sierra Nevada, but this is my first go at their seasonal releases. I bought 1 four-pack.

140,2671,DaverCS,4.33,"2015 vintage.  Beautiful mahogany color with 1/2 inch off-colored head.  Aroma boasts sweet malt, huge citrus, and pine.  Taste is big, strong, and forward. Big malty-sweetness up front, then a huge hit of citrusy-hop bitterness. I get a real strong bitter grapefruit taste near the middle of the palate. Carbonation carries these flavors into the finish that consists of mouth-coating sweetness and hoppiness. Finishes with a present alcohol heat and bite.  The beer is good don't get me wrong, but this isn't something one person should drink. This would ideally be split between two people, not because of the ABV, but because of thickness. It has TONS of flavor, but drinking an entire bottle can be a bit tiring on the palate. I would pair this with a spicy beef chili.

Had a nice 2-3 finger head, but it didn't last all that long in the chalice style glass. Minimal lacing, but it had nice looking alcohol legs. Looks like a classic barleywine for sure.  S- It has dankness, and oily character from the hops. Dark fruits and citrus, sugary sweetness, and some malty, bready notes. There is a big yeasty quality to it as well. Maybe that's where this bready, almost doughy, scent is coming from. Alcohol is there in the nose. It's, in a way, very similar to a double IPA in smell. But overall, it smells like an American style barleywine.  T- This isn't too bad if you're a certified Hop Head, but the hoppy bitterness is very noticeable. Dark fruits and those classic West Coast citrus notes are there, along with the yeasty, earthy type flavors. Some toffee and caramel malts. The malts sit very well behind the alcohol and sweetness. The sweetness is almost candied like, but it's not that cloying at all. This beer finishes very dry! The flavor is pretty hoppy and sweet, with the caramel malts and hints of alcohol. I find the hoppy bitterness pleasant. But that's just me. If you like your double IPAs, you may like this.  M- This is a full and rich bodied beer. You can feel the alcohol a bit in the back of the throat, but in no way shape or form does this beer burn. The beer does coat the mouth and throat nicely. There's a slickness and heft to it I like. The mouthfeel of this would slap yo Mamma around.  Overall, it's a great beer. It is the best I've ever had? No! But this one, although I drink it rarely, is nostalgic for me.

M- Not as thick as it smells. But it is in between a medium and full bodied BW. The taste and ABV that follows justifies the medium mouthfeel  T- taste is fantastic. Rich Munich and a little spice quality maybe a Rye malt.. Overall a real rich malty beer with the perfect balance of citrusy hop flavor. For being almost 10% ABV it is not even remotely prevalent!  Overall- Very good tasting beer... you won't be disappointed! This is the 2015 Barleywine and I can only imagine when it was brewed.. Tastes as if it was already aged for a year! These guys are on top of their shit.. The beer is a cheap Barleywine for a world class beer. Would definitely pick up another pack!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Brackh,4.56,A fresh 2015 bottle. Pours a dark copper red with a foamy head. Hot damn this smells delicious. Floral smell is overpowering. You can almost smell the alcohol too.

Great introduction to barleywines for me, and my new favorite from Sierra Nevada. Well worth the price, even in a four pack. If I could take it overseas I would love to let some age for a few years, but something tells me customs might not be down with that.

Taste: Sweet malt, raisins, slight roast, and again a tea like character.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a slightly sticky mouthfeel and medium carbonation.

Big, sweet malts reminiscent of an amped up marzen or something, but with a huge splash of juicy piney hops. Alcohol is present, but I think it adds rather than detracts.  Feel: fluffy, medium-thick, and dry. Quite good.  Overall: had this for the first time last year and didn't know quite what to make of it.

A little fruity, with some nice malty caramel and toffee notes.  T: Very complex. Immediately I pick up on delectable caramel, toffee, butterscotch, and even some woodiness. The sweetness is perfectly balanced with a floral bitterness and grapefruit tartness. There are notes of pear, apple, peach, and maybe papaya, but they're just supporting roles here.  F: Medium-to-heavy, with a creamy frothiness that complements the sweeter side of the beer.

Immediate sweet malts, such as a strong stout, this is immediately followed by lightly sweet and syrupy peaches and mangos, this is followed by an intense hoppy bitterness, perfectly rounding off the initial sweetness. Strangely enough, after swallowing, seconds later a welcome smokiness develops. O - One of the absolute most complex, interesting and tasty beers I've ever drank.

I have tasted it fresh, and with 3,5, and 6 years of age. All were excellent, but I think I prefer it with 4-5 years of age. Although I would never turn down a fresh bottle.  Ruby red and crystal clear body under a thick and creamy off-white head. Impressive after almost 5 years.  The nose is full of sherry and sugar coated hops. Like warm Ponderosa sap running down the outside of the fragrant bark in summer.  The taste is a happy marriage of hops (with sturdy bitterness) and sherry/oxidized malt. Wonderful. A tiny bit of cardboard hidden under all the excellent flavors, which is very easily overlooked.  The feel is thick and moderately sweet, but is nicely balanced because of the high bitterness.  Conclusion: An excellent beer at any age from 0-5 years, and at any time of the year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

S: Bright, piney nose upfront. Little bit of malt sweetness with caramel, but the hops dominate. Similar to what you’d expect from a barley wine, with a bit extra on the hops, as you’d expect from an american style version. Not picking up any alcohol.  T: Strong bitterness upfront, slight bitter in the aftertaste. Hoppy and piney flavors in the middle mouth. Some sweetness in the middle mouth and resin flavors.  M: Vicious yet smooth. The carbonation is present but does not press your tongue. The carbonation bites and is sustained by hoppy bitterness that lingers  O: Nice, smooth and enjoyable.

140,2671,Johnquisssssssy,4.02,"Decent head, which dissipated pretty quick. Colour is a gorgeous red/brown. Smell is nicely aromatic of piney hops which I assume will fade with years. It's a nice drinkable mix of syrupy prune/plum with a hop bite. There is a dry finish and the alcohol isn't evident beyond the body, and the sweetness.

140,2671,Geegmasta,2.69,"2014, poured into a tulip glass  Appearance - Pours smooth with a crimson/orange body. A very small head accumulates at the top which is stark white compared to the depth of the body. Head recedes fairly quickly leaving a ring around the glass.  Smell - Mildly sweet with hints of a hoppy character. Nothing really stands out.  Taste - Consistent hop undertone hits first and remains for the duration. Roasted malt character shines through after the first second and slowly dies out. Finishes dry and the pine hops are clinging to your tongue until the next sip. There's a bit of zest in there too, from some spicing, but I can't put my finger on it. Too much hop for my liking. No real hint at the 9.6% ABV.  Mouthfeel - Smooth with little carbonation.  Overall - I was excited to see Sierra Nevada with a barleywine styled ale. Hoping it would be along the same quality as their Narwhal stout, I brought home the 4-pack. Honestly, I'm disappointed. The hop character was too obvious and strong for my liking. There was no sweetness that I tend to be used to with barleywines.

Slight sweetness from the malt battles to stay on the stage but the show was taken over by the hops. Classic American barleywine. Overall: Although I enjoyed this brew I can't say it was enough to sway me over the pond toward preference for American barleywines. I would still choose an English style barleywine. English style barleywines are more well rounded and balanced than their American counterparts. American barleywines are more akin to malty IPA's. But hey, whatever floats your boat I suppose.

It pours a murky deep golden brown with almost no head  Smell is of lots of malts an d sweetness along with a bit of pungency from the hops.  Taste is exquisite. The sweetness of the malts carries through from the first mouthful as it plays with the palate and suggests a beautifully blended malt bill for a barley wine. But then the surprise enters in with the hop bite taking center stage as the golden liquor makes its way to the back of the mouth. Ahhh, the pleasant blend of hops makes this a great barley wine for drinking just because. Unlike the great barley wines ex. BCBBW or Sucuba this beer isn't just pure sweet malts and barrel, but fights back with a little jab here and there of the hop counterbalance.  Needless to say I like this beer a lot.

140,2671,infinitebruner,3.76,"2014 Vintage  September 30, 2014 – bottle was cellared for about six months  12 oz bottle, snifter  A – Dark red and mahogany to brown. This is what’s meant when you read “garnet highlights.” Very limited head that lasts probably less than a minute. Clear, malty. A bit of impression of syrupy viscosity. Gorgeous.  S – A load of malt, toffee, and caramel. Some golden raisins and other dried, but bright, fruit. A ton of malt sweetness, with an offsetting whiff of bitter hops.  T – A lot of malty sweetness, toffee, and then a ton of hops burst through, bright, piney, and somewhat resiny. Like walking in the woods on a drizzly day in Oregon. Bitterness coats the tongue, waiting for the next sip to start the process again. A slight butteriness in the malt flavors.  M – Some thickness in the body, a sense of viscosity as it fills the mouth, then taking over by the bitterness of the hops.  O – Even for an American barley wine, this is extremely hop-forward, more than can come close to mellowing in six month. I’m reading Randy Mosher’s ‘Tasting Beer’ right now, and he talks about cellaring these for at least five years; I think he’s on to something.

I took notes on the first bottle of this I opened in 2006, and thought it was a lesser year; it was very astringent and overly dry. Those 8 years really added some character. Dang, the caramel flavors are much more pronounced, and the astringent flavors are all completely gone. I am so glad I didn't plow through this case and have about 9 left. I have a 2004 that was still good, but probably not as good as the previous year's tasting, so I am guessing around 8 years in the cellar is the optimal aging time for this barleywine.

Wait a sec. I'm actually reviewing the Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale or Initialised (as always in my Sierra Nevada reviews) as SNBBSA. What more can be said about Sierra Nevada, they rule the roost when it comes to the West-Coast craft scene, and I imagine they are all-round nice guys/girls as well. Note: This is the 2014 batch, and also my first US style Barleywine.  Poured from a 355ml bottle into a Chimay chalice.  A: A deep hazy cooper body with a ring of beige lace awaits the next lucky drinker (i.e. me).  S: An intriguing mix of dark fruits (fig, raisin, dates), pine and citrus hops. Also noted is a caramel malt and a hint of bread yeast that lingers around. There is a great synergy going on between these aromas, it's as if a fruity Belgian Quadrupel got in bed with an aggressive hop forward American IPA and the two had a passionate love-making session.  T: Then the flavour hits you, nay punches you right in the tongue. Elements of the above aromas swirl about taking a dump right on my palate. There is however a sharp forward hop bitterness that is a tad distracting, it's like an ultra concentration of pine and grapefruit. Shame when everything else within the taste of this fine Ale hits the right spot.  M: Dense and syrupy - it has the consistency of a delicious beer-flavoured treacle.  D: I guess I knew what I was in for when I cracked open SNBBSA but boy oh man oh girl oh woman it really smacks you around. Although the hop bitterness is a smidge over the top, the flavour and texture of this beer is indeed akin to a big hairy manbeast roaming the giant redwood forests of Oregon. Perhaps the only thing holding it back from being as great as a similar ABV Belgian Quad would be finesse - the Belgians nail finesse, whilst the Americans bring complexity to the table it will only take you so far, then you need finesse.  Food match: The heavy body of this beer really makes it more of an after-dinner brew, however if you were going to attempt it with food then you need a bold spicy cuisine like a Thai with a light body to counteract any bloat, such as a green Papaya salad with chopped red chilli.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Phoodcritic,3.58,"Bigfoot has been my least favorite barleywine. I decided to age one that was bottled in December 2016 for five years, to see if I liked it better aged. I didn't. Consumed December 2022. It still had that strong piney, bitter flavor, along with a soapy taste.

Two finger slight toffee head that dissipates slowly.  S- Lovely rum raisin forward notes. Hop aroma is definitely more subdued than when fresh. Now I get more of a backing note of earthy pine and spice.  T- Here is where the hops come through more. Even with over a year on it, the hops are surprisingly apparent. Mostly getting a piney syrup aspect to it with a good amount of spicy hops. Wish it tasted more like the aroma.  M- I'd say on the lighter side of heavy. A pretty high level of carbonation for the style.  O- Prefer this aged version than the fresh one but will see what the other 2013 I have tastes like in a year. I hope some of those rum raisin notes come out in the flavor.

140,2671,Jacobier10,4.04,"2014 Vintage:  Cult classic beers are fun to review, and even more fun to drink! Such is the case for Sierra Nevada Bigfoot. This is the kind of beer that I would describe as ""in your face."" It takes your palate for a ride and makes you question whether you can handle all 12 ounces of it. Everything about it is big. Big malt, big hops, big body, big flavor. But it takes a quality brewer to reel in all of these characteristics and create something that is enjoyable to drink.  Deep amber/copper color with ruby highlights and a creamy light tan head. Heavy pepper spice from the hops with even heavier caramel, raisin, and toffee from the malt. Massive sweetness, full bodied, thick textured, and long lasting flavor. Bitter finish.  This is the third bottle of the four pack that I have had (not all tonight) and each one has kicked my ass. This is a beer to sip and savor, for sure. The quality in the entire lineup of Sierra Nevada beers, not just this one, is impressive. I can't remember the last time I had something by them that I did not enjoy. Can you handle it?  -----  2016 Vintage:  Increasing my rating for Look from 4.00 to 4.50.

140,2671,peensteen,4.39,"2014 Bottle from Andrew.  Brownish ruby colour, one finger of off white head some lace. Smell is of dank piney hops, juicy citrus with a sweet caramel/malty secondary, the hops are really the star of the show here. Taste is full of pine and dank hoppy flavours right away, spicy, malty with a touch of sweetness but in terms of barleywine I would say this is quite dry, bitter hop aftertaste. Medium carbonation, full chewey body. This was really good, perhaps the fastest drinking barleywine I have ever had, I could probably have a couple of these in an evening with no complaints, best enjoyed fresh as this was.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,Hop-o-saurus,4.6,"This is a great and relatively easy beer to find. I love this barleywine because it carries the sweet malty taste to start and transforms into a velvety, alcoholy, and IBU lover friendly flavor compilation.

140,2671,BurgeoningBrewhead,4.37,"2014 bottle poured into snifter; ruddy brown pour showing deep red translucent in light with a solid finger and a half of off-white head that doesn't fade much, leaving dense rings of sticky lacing when it finally does. Smells of hops hit the nose first, followed by subdued bready malt and fermented dark fruit. Taste is bitter hops over top of solid bready malt; very clean and simple, not sticky at all. Mouthfeel is well-carbonated but hefty. Overall, this is a great hoppy barleywine. Actually reminds me of Arrogant Bastard in some ways, although the malt is less nutty than a strong ale. Spot on for the style without breaking the rules.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Hopamania,4.49,"This is a great barleywine, hands down. The hops definitely make it such that it could be mistaken for a Double IPA but this only serves to add to the experience, not detract from it. I just wonder how this would taste after a year or so. I will keep buying this one as long as it is available.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,BeerDocT,3.97,"I love the label on this beer: an old prospector and his mule getting the heck scared out of them by ol' Sasquatch. There are only four beers in the pack and they cost the same as a six pack: it MUST be a good beer if that's the case, right?  Appearance 3.75: Pours out a reddish brown. Opaque. Nice 1/2"" head faded slowly to a thick swirl that lasted the entire session. Excellent lacing.  Smell 3.5: Hops are the dominate bouquet, which is strange given the ABV of this beer and -of course-- the style. Barley wines should smell of deep barley, since a huge amount of the stuff was used to brew the beer.  Taste 4.0: Front is smooth and there is a delightful wave of caramel at this level. Middle is filled with buttery, caramel, brown-sugar and a deep maltiness. This is off-set somewhat by a slight flavor of smoked grains. Biscuit malt would have been perfect at this level, but I cannot detect it. Big hits of hops lurking around the edges of the palate here: more piney than citrus (Bigfoot would approve). Finish is silky smooth with more caramel and malt and lovely alkaline hops. Aftertaste is long and here is where deeper level of hops come out (citrus, grass, etc.) along with a lovely last taste of caramel.  Mouthfeel 4.5: Perfect level of carbonation for this beer, but not necessarily for a barley wine. Nonetheless, different elements come together to make this beer so enjoyable and this level of grading accentuates the beer to an exponential degree.  Overall 4.25: This is a ""barley wine style"" beer, but it is not a barley wine. I am going against the rules here (and following in the footsteps of many others) and grading this beer on its own merits, rather than its adherence to style. This beer is big in ABV, but is just perfectly balanced and so satisfying to drink. Hoppy, malty and a joy in every characteristic that a beer should be, this baby is dangerously sessionable. Don't drink too many or you too may see ol' Sasquatch lurking outside your window.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,PvtSnowball,3.93,"12 ounce bottle purchased at the local liquor store.  A: Cloudy amber with a one finger head with moderate retention. I like the look for some reason.

I am firmly in the English Barleywine camp, not overly fond of a fistful of hops in my BW. But...  Looking lovely and burgundy in the glass, with a just above small slightly off white head.  Smell was just excellent. Dried fruit, wine, slightly hoppy, sweet, and a bit on the boozy side. Well, here goes nothing....  I AM liking this! The hops are just right, not overpowering, working hand in hand with the other flavors. Why can't more American Barleywines be like this.  Mouth was extremely pleasant, one of those roll around the tongue brews  Overall, I'd get this anytime. One minor beef was that it arrived a lot colder than it should have.

140,2671,Maxwell,3.88,"2014 Vintage- The beer pours a deep, candied, ruby color with a nice, off-white head that borders on the color of white sand and has a mild retention. As the head goes, it leaves a thick blanket of lacing on the glass. The beers body is deep in color, but clear and rather translucent, even in its darkness. When I splash the beer against my glass, it leaves the briefest of alcoholic legs, hinting at the booze within it. As a whole, the beer is quite nice on the eyes. On the nose, the beer smells like an old-school DIPA: damply piney, with a strong caramel malt shiver running up the nostrils to suggest toffee. As it opens up, I start to get hints of plum and prune in the malt. On the tongue, the beer tastes initially of hop bitters (mostly of the pine variety). The middle of the sip sees a touch boozy heat, and towards the finish, the bitters are greeted by a powerful burst of caramel malt sweetness, which bends this beer back towards balance. Boozy heat and sweetness return on the finish, combining to intensify the afterfeel of bitterness in the mouth. In flavor, this beer begins with a fresh burst of sticky pine resin, moving slowly towards fresh pine needles and bitter medicine. This medicinal bitterness slowly blends into an ooie-gooey caramel and toffee sweetness. The transition bring hints of brown sugar-coated plums and prunes alongside solvent-like alcoholic heat. The finish sees a beautiful burst of caramel bread that has me looking forward to the things to come. The aftertaste is decidedly bitter with pine sap and medicine. In the mouth, the beer feels full bodied with a sticky, chewy mouthfeel, a middling carbonation, and a definite tingle on the tongue that could be coming from the alcohol or from hidden acidity. The sides of the tongue are shocked with bitter-bite once the beer has left the mouth, and the mouth as a whole is left dry except for the far extremities which pool spittle. Overall, fresh Bigfoot tastes like a boozy DIPA in today’s world. It’s hot, it’s hoppy, and it’s got a nice balancing malt that finishes quite elegantly and lets you know this is an American Barleywine. Admittedly, I’m more fond of the English Barleywines, but this is a classic of the American style, and has some nice complexity to it. This beer is a classic for a reason and should not be missed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,Dope,4.44,"Reviewing a 2011 bottle that is now a bit over 3 years old.  A: Pours a clear amber/red with a very tall and frothy dark tan head. Head fades pretty slowly with great retention. Still substantial lacing too.  S: Sugary sweet dark fruits (raisins mainly) and candied citrus. Caramel too. I remember this being quite hoppy when I had it fresh, it's now very sweet and malty smelling with quite a bit of fruit mingling in.  T: Ahh but there still some hoppiness left in the flavor. A bit of a bite. Nothing like it is fresh but plenty of pine and grapefruit with a small wave of bitterness. Much sweeter than I remember regardless. Caramelly and sweetbread malt. That bitter and sweet candied orange flavor stands out, almost marmalade-like at points. Dry, bitter piney finish with some herbal zing to it at times. Crackery - saltine-like in the finish and aftertaste to go with a citrusy hard candy flavor that lingers forever.  M: Somewhat heavy and sweet but with a still-bitter and a lightly dry, crackery finish.  O: Well, I've always heard this is one of the best aging beers and I can see why. Still has big and bold flavors with good hoppiness. The finish especially still has a strong bitterness and hop presence. Great complexity. Very tasty and enjoyable. No negative signs of age. It's pretty different than from fresh, but not necessarily better or worse. Still great, just a big change. I didn't change any scores except I subtracted .25 from the appearance. Will have to revisit around the 5 year mark I think.  --- 05-24-2012 review of a pretty fresh bottle:  2012 vintage, a few months old.  A: A really dark amber pour with a huge fluffy tan head adorning it. Fades quite slowly, leaving big fluffy streaks of lacing all over the glass. (4.5)  S: Big hoppy aroma. Citrus, mainly grapefruit and some tropical fruit to boot. Even some pine notes. This is no IPA though, there is a mountain of sweet caramel malt hiding behind the hop aromas. (4.5)  T: Lots of grapefruit and tropical fruit up front. Tangerine, mango, apricot. A bit of pine. As it finally fades, there is a super sweet caramel malt with some breadiness in there too. Some hints of honey towards the finish. Piney, resinous bitterness carries into and through the aftertaste. Touch of alcohol bite lingers in the aftertaste. (4.5)  M: Somewhat heavy, crisp with hop bitterness. A bit oily and drying.(4)  O: The quintessential american barleywine. It's very bright with hops when it's fresh, making it a borderline malty DIPA (like a double crooked tree or a 120min). Great balance of bitterness and sweetness, great balance of hops amongst themselves to boot. One of my favorite, if not THE favorite american-style barleywine.

140,2671,BernieBones,4.13,"Barleywine. Being a novice in the beer world, I immediately checked the barleywine wikipedia page after bringing a 4-pack of this character home. Upon pouring a glass, I notice an incredibly vibrant amber, almost red hue. While incredibly vibrant, it also sports an apparent cloudiness to it's texture. A short, creamy and frothy head sits on top of the beer like a autumn cloud at sunset. Taking a close whiff, I catch an overwhelming sense of the outdoors; a very strong hint of pine, with an overall floral aroma. Tasting the ale, I first notice its incredulous sparkling sweetness, which follows with a bitter, almost grapefruity tang to the palette. I feel my sinuses open from its spicy bitterness and what lingers after is a very minuscule hint of wheat, as well as a strong sense of centennial/chinook hops. Overall, this is probably both one of the most unique ale's I've yet to try, as well as the most bitter. The bitterness was actually a bit overwhelming during my first exposure, but I've accommodated it as part of this ale's unique character. This is definitely a strong beer. Boasting a 9.6% abv, this is definitely something you'll want to relish in gradually if you wish to enjoy it's character. What I was a bit skeptical of at first, is now one of my favorites from the folks over at Sierra Nevada. I definitely recommend this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Taste - This is where the Big Foot truly excels. Delightful syruppy taste with luscious and sweet after taste. I'm in love with the warm, malted caramel kick of this beer.  Mouthfeel - Perfectly carbonated. Goes down smoothly, leaving a pleasant, coated layer behind that tends to stay long after the beer is finished.

Mouthfeel is full bodied but not sticky and overly heavy like some barleywines can be. Low carbonation. Overall, a great barleywine, one of the more drinkable I've ever had.

The hop flavor is much more forward, spicy/earthy/piney hops, caramel, burnt sugar, and toffee.  Medium-heavy bodied, medium carbonation, chewy, bitter, sticky and resinous.

140,2671,ZagZagg,4.18,"12oz bottle into goblet glass  A: Off tan colored one, maybe one and a half-finger head. Real pretty looking brandy colored brew that has a certain haziness – gives off a warm glow. Mean retention and excellent lacing – plastering the whole inside of my glass. Visible carbonation, but appears mild, didn’t catch any sediment. Looks medium-well bodied.  S: Worty smelling giving off a bit of an unsweetened ice tea, notes of caramel and maple. Earth mixes right into the nose with aged wet wood. Sweet smelling malts evocate a refined dry nose.  T: Caramel and blends of sweet and bitter malts influenced by earth inflected hop dryness. Middle mouth consists of a lot of earth and resinous hop varieties. Wet dirt, bark, and heavy mineral water, inundated with a certain musty funk. Big malt body persists throughout, offset just slightly by the zesty hop presence and supported by a mild boozy backbone. Faint flavor of dried banana and apricot fade into the finish with a lingering robust combination of flavors – strong finish  M: Fully body and a bit sticky too, fills the mouth right up and medium-light carbonation pinpricks the tongue. Aftertaste is dry and earthy-sweet. Pleasant on the palate  O: Very easy to see how this can age and become more delicious. Barleywine isn’t a style I fucks with much, but this brew has set me straight. It fills up my senses, like a walk in the forest.

The Bigfoot poured a deep ruby red with a significant head a good retention. This was a great looking beer. The aroma was very sweet and hoppy with citrus hops dominating into a sweet and slightly boozy tones. The taste was huge, with more bitter resinous hops on a bed of bittersweet malt that finishes with more pine hop notes. The bitter pine stays on your palate and lingers between sips of this mammoth brew. There is a slight alcohol finish that is hidden well underneath all the bitter hops and malt but definitely not dominant.

140,2671,ykncornelius,5,"This guy is really one of my favorites, but I've never formally reviewed it. I guess usually my glass is empty before I have a chance to hop online...  Beautiful orangey-garnet pour (burnt umber, for you Crayola aficionados out there), creamy off-white head died quickly and gave way to good lacing and a thin film.  The aromas were elusive as all hell to me. Lovely, but tough to put my finger on. It wasn't until I had a sip that I realized I was getting an absolute blast of sugary-sweet grapefruit on the nose. Imagine slicing out wedges from a fresh fruity half and tapping demerara sugar on the top--THAT is the nose and the first taste.  The best part is how that quickly vanishes and leaves you with this meaty mouthfeel of malt, like chewing up a mouthful of animal crackers + a shot of aged rum + a couple raisins + a drying drop of quassia. The flavors just LINGER for AGES, it's fantastic. Especially the residual throaty tastes from that first sip--so if you're just popping the top, really pay attention to the first taste.  Add in that typical barleywine effervescence and chewy creamy mouthfeel, and extremely mild alcohol heat for nearly a 10%-er. It's boozy and yet (dangerously) sessionable...at least to this guy.  I hate to get too technical and give something a 4.5 for appearance or mouthfeel when, given the style, it couldn't be any different or better. So this one's getting 5's across the board.

Whiff of hop presence predicts some bitterness. Dark malty flavors up front moving into some warming alcohol towards the middle. Clean bitterness cuts into the sweetness towards the end of the sip, with some faint floral and piney flavors as well. Nice movement across the different flavor profiles. Rich mouthfeel that hangs out for awhile and finishes with the nice, crisp bitterness. Fresh bottle was very good drinking, if a bit hot and boozy.

T - some sweetness upfront but overpowered by a lingering bitterness I wasn't completely expecting. Oaky. Don't really like it. Gets worse at it warms up.  M - slightly syrupy. Oily is maybe better word.  O - I think this looks, smells and taste much like a double IPA, but with a greater warming effect.

A - Poured into a pint glass (still working on getting a snifter) up to an inch to form a 2"" head and let it sit two minutes. Filled the rest of the way on the side, finishing in the middle with a solid 2""-2.5"" head. A very nice, orange or dark amber color.  S - The moment the top popped off, I smelled wonderful fruits and either a vanilla or caramel. My nose was a bit off that day to tell the difference, but it was a nice, sweet smell.  T - What starts out as a tasty sip quickly plateaus into ""okay."" What made me go for this one was a sip from someone else weeks before, but perhaps it was too small of a sip. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad at all, but compared to the last four or five I've tried, I had obviously over-hyped myself into this one.  M - Nicely carbonated.

140,2671,MasterfulIdiot,3.48,"Poured into a Riedel tulip glass. Kicks up a nice foamy tan head that takes a few minutes to die down. The liquid is a nearly opaque amber with red hues coming through.  Aroma is lots of toasted malts, with a bit of a hop kick hiding underneath.  Taste is roasted malts at first, but it gets quickly undercut by hoppy bitterness. Hops are kind of citrusy, but overall seem to bring a lot of bitterness without much flavor. There's a nice interplay between all the malts and hops, but it comes out having that sickly-sweet bitterness that I find in some beers that I don't like. The hops and alcohol do bring out a nice warming character, which is really pleasant.  Mouthfeel is semi-thick, with lots of carbonation. The head sticks around pretty much forever, and gives you a nice dose of foam with every sip.  Overall, it's just got a flavor profile I don't really like that much. I think it's well done, but not my cup of tea. Maybe it would be better aged, so the hops aren't as strong, but, to be honest, there's not that much else I can taste in the beer that I would look forward to.

140,2671,8stringfan,3.82,"Poured straight down into a large style tulip it produced a massive, thick, fluffy, light beige/off-white three finger head with considerable staying power (after a couple of minutes in the glass it was still well over a finger) and considerable lacing. Color is a hazy, opaque, tawny brown with hints of amber. Nose is well balanced with crisp, piney, and slightly grapefruit hops underlying a big, malty nose presenting dark caramel, toffee, molasses, a tinge of vanilla and, well, just plain old malted sweetness. For a 9.6% abv, there is no sign on the nose of the higher alcohol content. Sip is bittersweet on the front of the tongue leading with lightly floral piney hop notes. Midpalate sees the full expression of this powerful and complex brew with an explosion of multi-layered sweet flavors from the malt including caramel, stewed fruits, dried Turkish apricot, sweet dark bread, and fruitcake. The hop component has a fresh and extremely well-balanced quality and presents a generalized sense of light citrus and pine bitterness. The back of the tongue and swallow sees an aggressive hop expression overtake some pronounced malty caramel notes, first in terms of light crisp pine notes and then an aggressive burst of tannic, slightly rubbery bitterness. Finish is somewhat thin, given the strength and depth of flavor on the sip, and consists most strongly of drying tannins with, again, notes of bitter grapefruit and pine. Despite a head suggesting massive carbonation, the mouthfeel was velvety smooth and slick while the alcohol never really showed up. I meant to A/B this with last year’s Bigfoot but before I could do it, someone at our holiday party back in December accidentally drank the 2012 Bigfoot I’d been saving all year. Grrr!! At any rate, based on my review of last year’s Bigfoot, this one seems a bit less hop forward and more malty, with some greater depth in the malt profile. I think that’s an improvement and a better reflection of what I’ve come to expect from American Barleywine’s. I’d like to see more happen in the finish, but all-in-all, this was a terrific brew and an excellent example of the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

I definitely enjoyed it more than I recalled. The appearance was dead on for what I expected color-wise, but the thin head that provided significant lacing pushed it to the wonderful state. I couldn't get much from the smell in strength, but what I hit seemed in line with the style.  For the taste, feel, and overall, I have one slight issue in the mix of sweetness, dark fruits, and tartness combined with the hops bitterness is just slightly off-putting.

The retention is pretty good at more than two minutes with very little reduction in height. The beer is a dark-tawny color and mostly clear. A bit of carbonation is visible.  S-The aroma is almost hot, but strangely charming. For a barleywine, there is a good dose of bitter hops, which adds to the medicinal, heating sensation of the alcohol. Balancing out the heat and hops is a sweet mixture of caramel, vanilla, malted barley, and a bit of molasses sweetness. Its a bit rough, but quite appealing.  T-The taste follows the smell with bitter, boozy warmth coming on strong throughout the palate. The flavors are as described above (caramel, vanilla, bitter hops, sweetness) with a finish that gives a light kick of citrus and reminds me of cognac. The whole thing is rough and a bit wild, but I kept drinking it and finished both bottles (over two night) thinking that I enjoyed it.  M-The body is a bit light for the style with a tingle of carbonation.  O-This is a big, brash beer and thoroughly enjoyable on a cold winter evening.

The taste comes in strong at first, and then you begin to taste the little touches of wheat and the malt they use.

(2015 new) pretty bitter but with good pine hops and sweet carmel malts. Slight booze and slight spice. (2014 aged 1 yr) bitter and boozy with a sweet Carmel maltiness and very slight hopness (drink 2017, purchased 2014) BOOZE bitter with some caramel (2014,2020) - almost like brandy, dark fruit caramel not really bitter like the fresh ones (2020) boozy, lots of caramel and the classic Sierra Nevada pine hop taste. Gives a great balance!  Feel (2014 new) full bodied and it sticks to the insides of my mouth (2015 new) full body with lots of stickiness. Medium lite carbonation.

It's a strong beer and you have to be in the mood to attack a beer like this but after running, lifting and cutting the grass after a long day I though a Bigfoot would be a great way to finish the evening off! (2015 new) has to be one of the best barly wines! Strong beer but not to strong. Split this with a friend since we are splitting a 2014 that's been aged a year next. (2014 aged 1 yr) not as hoppy as before and more malty and more creamy. Different beer when aged and really good and more boozy. (drink 2017, purchased 2014) what a strong beer with caramel tang and lots of booze. (2014, 2020) - better than fresh! No Sierra Nevada taste any more. More like carmalized butter brown sugar.

140,2671,highdesertdrinker,4.58,"Deep red/copper hue, it smells hoppy, and piney portending what's to come. It has a strong hop wallop, piney, with the standard barleywine style flavors; molasses, raisins, figs, et al. It also has a decent malt backbone to balance things out with regard to the strong hop presence. Make no mistake about it, this is my favorite Sierra Nevada offering, and I'm a big fan of theirs in general. This is world class, IMO, esp. if you're a hophead, and it's rep for aging well is the stuff of legends, and the price is as good as it gets for a beer of this caliber.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Very enjoyable. Plus, it has the best bottle cap art (at the bottom end of the bottle cap) I have seen.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,CTbrew32,4.32,"2013 bottle Aroma has traces of citrus/pine hops, light fruits, and caramel malts. At first the taste is a balance of citrus/pine hop and caramel malt with a tiny bit of alcohol. As this warms up the caramel malt takes over, the hops subsides to a bright dark fruit taste, which balances very well with the strong malt presence. Overall, this beer is very good with a year on it and great with 2 years on. When fresh this is good, but the hops, especially pine, overshadow the malt and fruit flavors. So meeting in the middle this gets a very good score, but it really depends on what one prefers in a barleywine, and I prefer less of a hop presence.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Copernicus,3.53,"Poured a 12oz. bottle of the 2014 into a snifter.  Not sure if a full review is even necessary; this one NEEDS some age. I'll probably buy a second bottle and wait a few years to then do a vertical tasting.  A: It pours a deep mahogany, nutty brown with ruby undertones...somewhere between amber and amber brown. It forms a good off-white head and a foamy lace. There is a slight haze.  S: It smells of nice spicy malt with a sturdy hop background. It's piney, like a wet boreal forest. It also displays some nice medium dried fruit like apricot and orange along with some clove and brown sugar.  T: It's bittersweet but well-balanced. It could even develop some sherry qualities when it ages. It's not too biting despite its alcohol content, but age will mellow it out even more. It tastes young, incomplete, like unripened fruit.  O: All of the makings of a good quaff are there, but the verdant flavors need a few years to work out their differences. Everything felt and tasted too spread out and disconnected, not fully integrated.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Nice hoppy aftertaste  M - Silky smooth on the tongue and palate, medium body and medium carbonatation  O - A really great beer, with a good balance between malts and hops.

140,2671,happilyhopped,4.13,"12oz Bottle of 2014 Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale, Opened on 1/15/14  A - A nice caramel color when held up to the light that gives way to red hues as you take the glass away from the light. A nice head with some solid lacing. Although i swirl the glass a bunch so i have no idea about the retention of the lacing.  S - A ton of the hops hit your nose like a brick when you first smell. Also some grape leaves and white pepper, probably from the hops as well. I'm not getting much of the malt at all on the nose, but do get some of the alcohol.  T - When I first sip this beer i get all the carmel and sweetness of the malt immediately, but only for a second before the intense spicy, bitterness from the hops kicks in. But after the initial smack in the face from the hops, the caramel sweetness returns with a little bit of baker's chocolate in there as well. Also getting some lingering heat from the alcohol.  M - Solid mouthfeel. Not too syrupy like some barleywines, although i would prefer a little less carbonation in this beer considering all the flavor it has. Sometimes i feel that too many bubbles take away from some the the flavors.  O - Overall i like this beer, and if you are a person that likes an intense hop character in their beer, then drink this fresh. I am going to cellar the rest of these for a while hoping that some of the hop intensity fades so i can get even more of the malt backbone in this beer.  ___*___*___*___*___*___*___  12oz Bottle of 2008 Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale, Opened on 2/9/14  **I opened this beer side by side with a 2014 edition to see how time in the cellar effects the beer**  A - The beer is still a caramel/brownish kind of color, but is much more cloudy and murky than the 2014. It also is a bit more brown than the 2014, which has more orange and red on the peripheries of the glass when held up to the light. Almost no head on the pour, but the bubbles are noticeably more orangey brown than the 2014 which has whiter bubbles.  S - The smell is incredibly different then the 2014. Tons of malt and caramel on the nose right away. Almost like a milk chocolate kind of smell. None of the hop aroma comes through and no strong alcohol flavor like the fresh version. This smells amazing.  T - A really hearty bread taste right away, like eating saltless tuscan bread. Also getting a flavor similar to blue cheese stuffed dates that combines very well with the bread taste. But after that there is still a bunch of the hop bitterness working through. Surprised how much of the hoppy bitterness is still on this beer after 6 years in the bottle. But i like hops so this isn't a bad thing.  M - A bit more syrupy than the fresh version which is expected, but still not as much as some english style barleywines. The over carbonation that i didn't care for as much on the fresh version is gone and there is the perfect amount for my liking so you can smell and taste everything in the beer.  O - I definitely prefer the aged version to the fresh version. Both are good in their own right, but I love the front end flavors on this beer so much more than the fresh one and i prefer the slightly less carbonation too. So much richer and more developed than the fresh version. Still think the beer would be good with more years on it, but it is delicious now if you have any and were wondering.  2008 Rating: A: 4.25 S: 4.75 T: 4.75 M: 4.25 O: 4.5",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Hazy dark orange, superb rocky head retention, lots of sticky lacing.  Smell - Loads of sweet, floral, piney hops. Mild sweet caramel malt.  Feel/Taste - Silky smooth, sticky full body feel. Light carb carries the flavor well. Flavor is massive hops front and center with a piney, floral, citrusy attack. The malts catch up shortly after with a sweet but very well balanced earthy caramel note, but the hops catch back up on the finish in a big way and dominate with some assertive lingering bitterness and flavor.  Overall - Huge flavor, huge beer. The hop bite on the finish is a little too assertive for my tastes... but the malt balance is impeccable. I worried it was going to be too sweet, but it's just right and not cloying at all. Maybe the most amazing thing of all, the big ABV is nowhere to be found.

Looks like your typical Barleywine.  Has a hoppy and pine resin aroma with some caramel notes.  Taste follows the nose. Very bitter and slightly harsh. Sweet syrupy and then bitingly bitter.

Nose is candied orange peel, pine and herbal hops, caramel, red apple skin, bread malt, touch of alcohol.  A bit of hop bitterness remains after two years, orange peel, pine, grapefruit, light herbal and earthy hop, with caramel, bread malt.

Aroma is typical of Sierra Nevada. subdued earthy hops on this with some breast maltiness. Reminds me of celebration ale I've been imbibing in the last 2 months with more malts.  Taste is rustic malts up front backed by a little bitterness from the hops. Some caramel sweetness is prevalent as well. Hops I remember on this have really faded but makes it more true to its labeled style. Sweetness prevails throughout with bitter aftertaste on every sip.  Definitely full bodied and sticky. nice carbonation.  Good offering from SN once again. The age really let the malty sweetness shine and overcome the hops.

140,2671,ONovoMexicano,4.09,"Poured from the bottle into a Belgian tulip.  Sierra Nevada rarely fails and this beer's appearance is a testament to that. A beauty here. A finger of cream-colored head, light and fluffy. The head dissipates and leaves a layer of lace around the glass and atop the liquid. The liquid is amber with dark hues and lightens towards the base.  Bigfoot smells sweet and malty immediately. Some spice lurks beneath. Piney hops are present. There's vanilla and toffee in there too.  Resinous, piney hops are prominent. There's some sweet, bready malt underneath with hints of vanilla and toffee. Some earthy, rye flavors are in there too and add a mild spice.  I'm impressed by how smooth and creamy this barleywine is. There is no suggestion of a high alcohol beer. It is sweet and simultaneously bitter and the dry, bitter finish lingers on my tongue.  There are a lot of reasons to like this beer. First off, as barleywines go, this is a great deal, four for ten bucks. Second, it's a tasty beer. Plenty of character. Perhaps not as complex as others I've tasted, but I am drinking it fresh.

As it finishes, the sweetness returns. Boozy in the finish.  M: Robust mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Not syrupy, but certainly thick.  O: Not your typical barley wine, this is very hoppy and spicy.

Astringent notes of citrus, particularly orange, stand out as well.  Taste: Bold sweet malts hit the tongue first. Caramel, brown sugar, and burnt toast. The hops explode on impact and turn the sweet notes into very bitter notes. Part of this bitterness is from the alcohol. Floral notes from the hops. A surprisingly dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Full body. Medium carbonation. More carbonation than I would expect from a barleywine... perhaps this is why the hops maintain their flavor so well.  Overall: This is my first time trying Bigfoot. Definitely contains a lot more hops than I anticipated... not that it's a bad thing though. The flavor is superb by my preference. The only problem I had was with the balance. The malts did not linger around long enough for me to taste their full essence.

The hop smell increases once the beer warms up a bit.  The taste follows the nose, strong caramel malts and grapefruit hops hit at once. There is some brown sugar and syrup taste as well followed by more hops. The rich malt and hop backbone are well balanced and seem to take turns on the palate.

Just more hops than ever before. I mean really... Sierra Nevada takes the IPA model and makes every damn thing they brew taste like just another version of an IPA. Did I happen to mention that I detest IPA's? Cramming a brew full of hops does not equal a great brew-- it just shows a profound lack of imagination.

Plenty of lacing stays behind.  Smell is alot of hops, tons of them. Floral and bitter hops, pine, malty goodness, dark fruits, citrus, wonderful.  Taste is similar to smell with huge hop presence, citrus and pine, and a big malty backbone that blends well with everything. Caramel sweetness is very forward throughout the sip, with the hop character changing along the way, finishes clean with a bitter aftertaste.  Feel is fully carbonated and a slick taste bud experience. Lacing sticks around to keep it looking and feeling great.  Overall i think it's my favorite SN beer and I always look forward to trying it.

This was my first barleywine ale and I must say I am a fan if they all reflect beers like this one. I gota 4 pack, drank 3, and will let that last one sit for as long as I possibly can! Definitely worth picking up. I recommend getting two 4 packs at least, drink one pack, let the other one age for at least a few years.  2014 update: Tastes even better. I did a side-by-side with Old Foghorn, the first american barleywine. Had similar notes, but Bigfoot crushes it with balance. It is so well-balanced and doesn't invade your tastebuds in anyway.

140,2671,voraciousalky,2.16,"I just bought a four-pack of 2013 Bigfoot at a nearby beer shop. I tried this ale several years ago and didn't really like it. I thought maybe I would appreciate it a little more now that I'm older and more experienced. I was wrong.  This beer doesn't taste good, and taking a big swig is a wholly unpleasant experience. Some folks pick up the taste of fruit; I pick up the flavor of OTC cough syrup. I know good and bad are subjective when it comes to beer, but I can't figure out why everyone thinks Bigfoot is worthy of a score in the nineties. Am I just unsophisticated? Maybe. But then again, there might be a lot of groupthink supporting Bigfoot's high average rating. For the record, Busch, Budweiser, Miller High-Life, etc. are all better than this beer. (Yes, I said it.)  Now that all that's out of the way...  This is certainly an interesting brew, despite the off-putting taste. A lot of reviewers note the strong bitterness and hop aroma, but I was surprised that a beer with an IBU of 90 was so well-balanced. When I drink Bigfoot, I'm not overwhelmed at all by the smell or bitter taste of the hops at all. It is truly well-balanced.  Then there's the alcohol. Bigfoot does a far better job of masking the taste of alcohol than other brews, such as Hoptimum, with similar ABVs. I don't know how they did it, but I've had beers with substantially lower levels of alcohol that were far more ""boozy"" tasting than Bigfoot.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,dbrese,3.28,"After collecting this beer for the past five years hoping to see just how good it would get with time, I just don't think it is as good as memory may serve for most of us. There are many better barleywines being made than this one. The main issue I have is that in creating an American version of this style they made the bitterness so intense that after two years of cellaring it is still too bitter and too unbalanced for my palette. 70 IBUs with something other than Chinook or Centennial would help to make the malt more prominent along with less sulfate in the water. Otherwise it is just overly simple for the style. It would be better dry-hopped to make a triple IPA like Founders Devil Dancer. That should be the target for Bigfoot. At least that beer improves with age and is good fresh. The 1990s are gone and we should all expect more from a great American brewery that helped to buck the status quo.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,JohnnyHopps,4.12,"Appearance - The beer, poured into a snifter, was a deep copper color. It possessed a nice white fluffy head that left lacing on the sides of the glass.  Smell - I smell hops. The aroma leans on the grassier side of hops, but there is some degree of citrus. There is also a hint of earthiness to the aroma.  Taste - In the initial taste, I sense sweet malt, caramel, and perhaps a hint of cinnamon. Then the hops take over. The grassy, citrus hops begin the burn of hop assault that warms the back of the throat almost instantaneously. To a modest degree, candy-like sweetness carries throughout the taste.  Mouthfeel - The staying power on this one is pretty special. The thickness allows a lingering of the tongue bruising hops. Nicely done.  Overall - This might be my favorite offering from Sierra Nevada. It is well balanced, and has nuisance that go beyond being a hop bomb.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,SteelSaw,4.16,"Appearance- Pours with a nice one finger white head that dissipates to a thin film. It pours a dark amber color with perhaps slight ruby-ish tints when held to light. Not much light passes through.  Smell- My nose is still in training. It has a very stong hop smell.  Taste- Has a nice sweetness up front towards then tip of my tongue. Middle has a good ale taste slightly reminiscent of Arrogant Bastard. Then a semi strong hit of bitterness near the middle/back of my tongue. For a 9% it really does not taste boozy, and drinks quite smooth.  Mouthfeel- Quite nice. Gets a creamy, medium bodied texture as it passes over the tongue.  Overall- This is a great beer. I am not a huge fan of bitter beers. However this one is nicely balanced and I recommend trying it if you can find it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Das_Reh,1.67,"2013 bottle poured into a snifter.  Aggressive pour produces minimal head, about a half finger thick, before dissipating into a thin white film. The beer is a striking mahogany color and looks wonderful in the glass.  Oh my... BIG hop presence on the nose, very potent and piney. I've had IPA's that didn't smell this hoppy. I'm worried... I've never had the barleywine style before, but I was assuming it would have the dark fruit/caramel/brown sugar aromas of other dark, high alcohol beers.  Holy crap, that's hoppy! Big smack of pine resin and grapefruit rind to the face, a bitterness that dominates and completely overpowers the bourbon-like sweetness that is barely discernible in this brew. There is a bit of warming heat from the alcohol, but again, hops overshadow everything. Each sip makes me grimace; this is far from drinkable...  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slick, with oily hop bitterness coating your tongue.  After a few sips, I had to pour this down the sink, much to my dismay. This is the last time I base my beer purchases on reviews from BA, as my past 4-5 purchases have left me disappointed and wishing I had my money back. This beer was all bitterness and no flavor, a hop bomb. They should have called this a DIPA instead of a barleywine. I've heard that you can mellow this thing out by cellaring it for a year or so, but this is the last Bigfoot I will ever have.  NOTE: Although I stand by my review scores and consider this undrinkable, I should have realized it actually does fit within the style of being very hoppy, as it is an American styled barleywine. American styled barleywines have a more aggressive hop profile than their English counterparts, and I failed to realize that at the time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,scotorum,4.31,"Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into an Alchemist shaker pint.  a: Clear deep ruby amber, inch tall offwhite head receded slowly to heavy rocky surface foam and patterned lacing.  s: Vaguely of caramel malt and citrus.  t: Caramel malt with a sharp pine hop balance. Lingering caramel on the tongue, like someone was painting butterscotch on it. Burning throat on swallow.  m: Moderate to heavy. Great body.  o: Like a high octane real ale. Which is to say, really good, but tastes a little dangerous too. Really enjoying what seems to me more like a very Brit style take on a barleywine.  UPDATE 1/17/15: Aged a few bottles and had one tonight. Caramel malt is not as much in evidence, nor is the piney hop bite, more balanced now, the high ABV still evident but little throat burn. Am lowering the taste score from 4.5 to 4.25.  UPDATE 8/25/15: Having the last of my 2013 stash now and it's smooth and tasty with intense caramel-to-toffee malt/piney hops balance with hardly any evident throat burn! Want to raise my taste and overall scores back to 4.5 and buy some 2015 to age 2 years if I can still find it!  UPDATE 1/25/16: Having the first from a stashed 2014 fourpack and it's everything one could hope for, especially flavorwise in the smooth full body dept. Never got any 2015 to stash but 2016 is out now and will be put away for sure. Excellent value and eminently ageable!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

T - Hoppy and alcoholic up front, with caramel and malt bringing up the rear. The bitterness is balanced out and doesn't leave an aftertaste.  M - The carbonation is spot on for the taste, with a medium mouthfeel that's quite drinkable. Dangerously so, given the high ABV.

Mouthfeel: creamy and smooth, never a dull moment. Not at all watery, not too syrupy. Overall: I really like this beer, and would recommend it. This beer is complex and full of malt and hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,MaximalC,3.1,"Pours a murky bronze color with a moderate, beige head of soapy froth. Aroma is interesting, a vibrant melange of citrus, pine, milk chocolate, and a caramel sweetness. The flavor is extremely hop-forward and unlike any barleywine I've tasted. The palate is greeted by a huge blast of pine resin and alcohol, along with perky carbonation that accentuates both. Sweetness is almost non-existent except for traces of milk chocolate and nuts on the back end. Maybe maltier flavors can be teased out at room temperature? Regardless, this is not what I was expecting when I brought home a barleywine. Mouthfeel feels thin for the style; something more robust would better complement the flavor profile.  Overall, this a decidedly unbalanced brew--a thin, bitter barleywine that looks the part but tastes nothing as it ought to.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,dar482,4.35,"This pours in a deep brown mahoghany color.  It has a fresh hoppy and sweet aroma. It has a fruity note, like white raisins, to it along with candied toffee or caramel with sweet earthy and pine needles, grapefruit.  This beer is a hop monster. The front is just packed with juicy and big body hops with a hint of grapefruit and pine. Just an attack of bitterness.  It then gets a bit of sweetness from the malt and caramel sweetness to pack it up. Caramel, toffee, light brown sugar. The bitterness on the end is dry of cedar wood, roots, earthy, green pine. It settles down with its medium body really well without leaving a bitter aftertaste.  A wonderful beer that hides its alcohol very well along with being quite drinkable without too much bitterness or sweetness.  Having had this fresh and 10 months old, the beer still holds up being quite hoppy.  In addition, the '12 had less bitterness, but still a strong marijuana green pine bitterness. The '10 stood out as the bitterness mellowed out and the sweetness and caramel starting shining more.

Semi-resilient lacing slides slowly down the glass leaving a jagged ring behind.  S- Has a sweet, oaky aroma with a slight hop tinge and a faint booziness. Notes of brown sugar and maple.  T- More wood in the flavor plus a mild bitterness from the hops that lingers a bit. The malt extends itself creating a sweetness that plays nicely over top the hoppy, oaky bite. I'm reminded of dark bread and oats.  M- Slick but slightly sharp from the hops. Medium carbonation and a body that's mostly full.

140,2671,Mises85,5,"Prior to drinking, I aged this beauty for 4 months in my pantry. Served in a brandy snifter at about 50-55 degrees.  Appearance: Absolute gorgeous amber cognac like color. Two fingers of head that dissipates into some thin lacing.  Smell: Very spicy, jalapeno pepper like, Plums, English toffee, western hops, touch of vanilla, cognac, Scotch like alcohol.  Taste: Big hops, plums/apricots, more milky toffee, touch of pepper, touch of cream. I even get a cognac like note. While it smelled like an imperial IPA, I felt that the hops and alcohol were well hidden and it was extremely drinkable. Maybe it was because of the aging. Medium-full bodied and creamy mouth feel  Honestly, this is the BEST beer that I have ever tasted! It has all the characteristics that I could ever want in a beer. High hop, high alcohol, big fruit flavor and smooth creamy mouth feel. This is definitely not the last barley wine I will drink. I will buy 5 bottles and age them.

140,2671,TastefulNudity,4.49,"Been way too long since I've had a barleywine. Let's have a go.  2013 Vintage  Appearance: Deep auburn. Thick foamy white head that goes from a finger to a ring that's not going anywhere. Great lacing. Looks delicious.  Smell: Caramel, dark fruit (plum, raisin), maple, alcohol, pine hops, a hint of vanilla on the back end. Smells sweet and awesome. Could smell this all night.  Taste: Hoppier than the smell indicates. Follows the nose in the exact order. Starts low with that deep caramel sweetness on the front and finishes very high and strong with that pine bitterness. Alcohol represents itself in the way a barleywine should. This is a dangerous one for me, though barleywine isn't usually a style to pound. Love these big, heated brews. I'm not sure if I want it to be maltier or not. Keeping my other bottle to age.  Mouthfeel: Begins a little syrupy (again, in my opinion it's to style), bitter hops and alcohol break and dry up the end result. Makes me want another sip. Nice bit of carbonation. Too little would make this hard to drink.  Overall: Solid, solid brew. The more Sierra I drink the more I grow to respect them as a brewery.

140,2671,machalel,4.27,"Vintage: 2013 dated bottle  Appearance: Pours a hazy copper brown with a fluffy beige head. Head lasted for a reasonably long length of time, and left good lacing down the glass.  Aroma: Very strong and pungent hops in the aroma, with strong pine forest and fresh citrus aspects. Once my nose got desensitised slightly to this initial burst, it was quite herbal, and there were some more subtle honey, melon, maple notes.  Taste: Wow, this thing is intense. Really powerful pine and resin flavours, with some citrus and slight alcohol warmth showing through. There is just enough malt to help back up the hops, but only barely, although it definitely takes the back seat in this brew. The herbal notes came through a bit stronger than in the aroma, and the honey and maple were present also. The aftertaste is an interesting mix of pine forest, fresh cut grass, apricots, pepper, and a bit minerally.  Mouthfeel: Medium-high carbonation and full body. Quite high carbonation for the style, however it doesn't detract too much from the beer. I can see that this may be to help keep the carbonation at a reasonable level after aging.  Drinkability: Initially I was wondering if I would be able to get through this thing, it was so hop forward and bitter, but in the end I couldn't stop sipping it, it was so addictive! By the end of the bottle, I could definitely have had another one, and was seriously considering opening the other bottles I had bought to cellar.

Smell: Pungent American hops hit me right away, but were well balanced by toasted malt and caramel. Lacking in alcohol scents and fruity esters, both of which I would expect to find in even an American Barleywine (as opposed to the fruitier English version).  Taste: Rich, toasted malt with medium-high bitterness that lingers on the roof of the mouth. Toasty vanilla bean and toffee flavors mix with apricots, pears, and golden apples. Very nice. despite the lack of alcohol flavors usually present in this style.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and somewhat chewy, with medium-high (slightly high for the style) carbonation. Here's where the alcohol made itself known, lightly coating the tongue with warmth.  Overall: This is a brighter tasting barleywine than I'm used to, but I rather liked it!

Lacing is decent, but I've used this glass for a few brews now, so that could be affecting it. Very nice all around though.  Smell: Man this thing has a punch. It hasn't gone away yet, and it still very pronounced even near the end of the brew. I'm picking up honey, an awesome set of malts (after I review this, I'm going to need to find out what malts they used, if anyone knows, PM me.) There is a slight ABV smell, but it's actually in a good way. It's very sweet. Probably the honey I'm getting is mixing well with it.  Taste: Awesome! I can't believe how much I'm digging this brew. The honey is there. The malt, much like the aroma, is phenomenal. There is enough bitterness in the hops to keep the tongue guessing. Very well balanced.  Feel: Medium bodied with a bit of thickness to it. It seems to give it a ""wine"" like texture. Very interesting and it works here.  Overall: First of this particular style, but man this was a good beer. I'm very impressed with it and will hold it as the standard to measure others in this particular style. I had no idea what to expect, but this is a well balanced, thick-honey like brew that is great!

Pours a nice off-white head, fairly large and creamy and long lasting. Thought high alcohol beers couldn't have good head retention?  Rich malty aroma with caramel, smooth pine hop aroma as well.  Big malty flavor up front, but never overly sweet. Big yet smooth hop flavors balance the malt nicely. Sufficiently bittered to balance the malt, and slightly bitter in the finish, but the bitterness isn't overdone as in some American BWs. The malt and hops are really united in a single beer here, which isn't always easy to achieve.  MF - Medium-full body, low-medium carbonation. No astringency, and well controlled alcohol warming given the strength.  Honestly, what an American BW should be. Malty and hoppy, but with both elements melding together nicely.

140,2671,SpeedwayJim,4.14,"A HUGE thanks to SurlytheDuff for this one. I'm not a big fan of Bigfoot in general but I do like old beer... and this is a 12 year old (2001 vintage) Barleywine. I'm real excited for this. 12oz. bottle into a Founders snifter. Shared with schen9303.  Big, viscous pour yields a .5 finger coarse, light cream colored head with low retention. Beer is a slightly cloudy dark mahogany. Huge, oily legs coat the side of the glass. Lacing is spotty and with good stick. Solid, given the style and age.  Nose is prunes and other dark fruit, molasses, coarse brown sugar and a subtle, deep booziness. Real rich and sweet but pretty simple.  Opens dark fruit. Molasses, brown sugar, green raisins, prunes and a biting, sappy hop bitterness. Its amazing that the hop presence still lingers here. Coarse brown sugar in the middle with a touch of nuttiness towards the end. Heat creeps up a touch but this is oh-so-smooth. More molasses sweetness in the finish with the same aftertaste complemented by a rough, hop bite. Real nice.  Medium to full bodied with low carbonation. Slick and oily in the mouth and goes down rich and smooth. Finishes dry and sticky with an aftertaste that coats the palate. Really good.  If I had any room in the cellar for non-lambic beer, this would certainly be it. No other brew I've come across evolves in such an interesting manner and holds up so well after so many years.

140,2671,pualie84,4.25,"L: Dark reddish color almost like cranberry. Good 1/4"" head that stuck around threw the first sip.  S: Piney and cozy. reminds me of Autumn.  T: Hoppy. Slight sweetness followed by a smoky kick in the middle. Can taste a lot of resin on the back end that is a good strong bitterness that compliments the middle. Very drinkable  M: Medium to full bodied. Very smooth. Lightly carbonated just enough for this beer.  Overall: This beer is a great beer! it's strong but the flavors are well worth it.

140,2671,Benish,4.12,"Poured a 2013 into snifter glass. Presented a dark ruby color with a short head that disappeared quickly. The color is beautiful. Carbonation present at center of glass. Little lacings on the glass.  Aroma was interestingly almost like an IPA as there were hops noted and a subtle citrusy smell.  Tasted both like a malt and hop bomb. Very complex in flavor. Starts out malty with maybe some dark fruits, roasted nuts, and finishes strong with the bitterness from hops. Not too sweet compared to other barely wines. Also leaves a tingle on the tongue at the finish. Little boozy but not overwhelming. Has a heavy mouthfeel.  Overall this wasn't as big a malt bomb as other barley wines. Some are cloyingly sweet. Yet this starts out sweet and finishes bitter. This beer could almost compare to a double IPA. Curious if the bitterness would stick around for another year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ALZ,4.49,"Appearance: Two-finger light beige head. Nice lacing. Pretty ruby-copper body.  Smell: Light fruits, malts, and a subtle hint of chocolate. Really nice, complex smell.  Taste: Sugary, syrupy malts up front. Spicy, warming alcohol follows. I love the hops at the end; never tasted that in a barleywine  Mouthfeel: Medium body and somewhat creamy. Dry finish that doesn't leave a syrupy coating in the mouth.  Overall: This is the best barleywine I've ever had. It has the sweet, malty, syrupy and spicy characteristics of a barley wine but it's not heavy or overwhelming. I could drink a few of these in a row. I really enjoyed complex flavors and scents; I especially liked the hops and dry finish. Bravo, Sierra Nevada!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,jadpsu,4.6,"In Laurel MS. Pours cloudy in a rich looking redish Amber. Has a malty tan head with pretty good retention and all around side laceing. Aroma of stingent hops of pine and acedic fruit, and maltiness. Taste: Leads with the stringent, acedic hops, tart and bitter and nice. Some caramel malts add to the balance and enjoyment as its 9.6% ABV stirs up the warmth while not being noticed in the smell or the taste. I like that Thick on the palate. Finishes extra, extra dry.

140,2671,MrKennedy,4.23,"12oz bottle, 2012, into a Brooklyn snifter.  Nice copper appearance. Fluffy beige foam on top that retains brilliantly well. The beer itself has lovely clarity.  Smells of caramel, dusky pine, candied pine and an overall sweetness. Not the hoppiness of a year ago, changing, but still very good.  Good mix of caramel sweetness with occasional underlying alcohol booze. Hop presence has died down a bit in ferocity, but still, piney hop flavour is there and works in well.  Seems to do what you want with it. Tempting to smash this in minutes, but also fun to sit on it for a while. Lighter front to it, building with sweetness and a little bitter finish that keeps you coming back. Take it how you will. I chose to sip slowly, thinking that the other 7 bottles i have will probably be even better this time next year.  Fun, versatile american barleywine. Really enjoyable, obviously cellarable and a bargain for the price out here.

140,2671,Kuaff,4.43,"I believe Bigfoot was my first barley wine of any kind. I was interested but not smitten with it at first, but now that my taste buds have matured, it's one of my favorites and it's time for a review. Poured into a snifter at cellar temperature.  This animal possesses a one-finger cream-colored head on top of a moderately hazy cross between garnet and mahogany.  It smells like resiny hops, sweet caramel, and raisins.  Tastes like malty butterscotch initially, followed by a bitter hoppiness that strikes me as astringent, roasty, robust, and, perhaps as the description on the label suggests, spicy. I think there's even a subtle hint of chocolate in there.  It's full-bodied! How could an ale named after sasquatch NOT be?  There isn't much else to say. Bigfoot's an exceptional barley wine and a fine example of a beer that delivers a brilliant balance of bitterness and sweetness (I LOVE it when beers do that, hehe).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Aroma of caramel malt, fruity, yeasty with a kind of brandy like alcohol esters fill the senses. Taste is of caramel malt, yeast with a brandy like fruity flavor. Palate is a full body, smooth and nicely balanced with a sweet slight bitterness and sticky mouth feel.

140,2671,Mongrel,4,"This is the third from a four pack from earlier this year. I drank the first two within a few weeks of the bottling date, but was underwhelmed. So I stowed the last two away for a few months and I'm glad I did.  Barleywine needs time to mellow. It's a style with a lot of potential, especially with the amount of barrel aging going on right now, so I was prepared to write a review about being disappointed about Bigfoot's failed potential. But the beer is much better this time around and I'm sure I'll be cracking that last bottle tonight too.  Into a snifter, it pours a deep amber with a finger of somewhat creamy head. The nose is bursting with caramelized malts and big whole leaf hops.  The flavor brings some of that sweet, malty caramel, bitter hops, golden raisins and dark fruit. The lasting taste is cool from the booze and hops, slightly syrupy with a faint touch of apple cobbler.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,WanderingSwede,2.9,"It has a deep amber body, small off-white head with good lacing. Fleeting pine resin and citrus aromas that really didn't last very long.

Not sure if my palate has changed or the age hurts it, but I think I like this vintage better.  Review done in 2012  08 vintage. Deep red color. Smells luscious and fruity.

S - Citrus and pine, but relatively subdued.  T - Wow, a huge dose of malts. Caramel, wood, vanilla. Balanced with some bright hop notes - mostly pine, but a hint of citrus. I normally don't like beers with this kind of malt profile, but this is supremely well-balanced.  M - Thin but oily; medium feel. Clings all over your mouth, leaving a dull, woody aftertaste reminiscent of tobacco. Quite a bit of foam from chewing and swishing. Huge dose of liquor-like alcohol.  O - This is my first barleywine, so I have little to which I can compare it.

140,2671,SmashPants,3.75,"Bottle: reasonable brown bottle with an original and decent label. I also like the inside of the bottle cap, which has a picture of Bigfoot sharing a beer. Very cute.  Appearance: orange-ruby in colour, quite clear but with a light haze. A one-finger beige head pops up and retreats to a thin film over 30 seconds. Decent lacing also - looks good.  Aroma: definite heavy fruits and brandy up front. Some sweet caramels in the back. Quite interesting.  Taste: sweet caramels and toffee with some hop bitterness - pretty good actually.  Aftertaste: the hop bitterness becomes more intense and biting - and not in a good way. It is accompanied by an unpleasant ethanol-like alcohol. Nowhere near as pleasant as the initial taste.  Mouth feel: heavier in body and smooth, with moderate carbonation to bring the flavour through.  Overall: not a bad barleywine all told, but really not worth the price, especially when compared to cheaper yet betterrounded barleywines from brewers like Moylan's or Green Flash.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Jadjunk,4.15,"""Bigfoot is a beast of a beer, brimming with flavor from massive amounts of roasted malt and spicy hops; brewed in the barleywine style, with a rich, bittersweet body and whole-cone Pacific Northwest hops."" Brewed in the style of an American Barleywine. Released annually in January. 2013 marks the realignment of this beer into the 4-pack imperial series amongst Narwhal Imperial Stout and Hoptimum Double IPA. Despite the dropping of 2 bottles, it's still a bargain at under $10 per 4-pack.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a snifter. Served north of 57º Fahrenheit.  (Appearance) Pours a frothy caramel cream head with a mild airiness to it. Body color is a medium hazy red amber with light sediment and moderate carbonation. Retention is slightly above average and lacing is light and thin. Head quality is oddly shallow for the fresh batch. 3.5  (Smell) Aromas of roasted, clean caramel malt, piney, herbal and mellow citrusy hop blends, followed with a pinch of sharp alcohol. Aroma is well rounded with a decent touch of grain husk and hop character to round out the malt sweetness. Altogether it's a very accessible aroma. Potency is medium. 4  (Taste) Up front waves of husky grain malt, rough around the edges and a moderate slick sweetness with a touch of bready smoothness. It finishes out with a peppery, citrusy and herbal hop bouquet with a strikingly bitter and perky dry finish. The alcohol makes its way into the finish but is nicely concealed by an abrasive hop perk. It's a slow sipper, but a worthy one. 4.25  (Mouthfeel) Texture is slick with just a touch of carbonation. Body is medium amongst Barleywines, medium/heavy overall. Balance is slightly hot over bitter over malty. Malt depth is a touch reserved for a fresh batch, but will likely grow bolder given time and thicken up the body some accordingly. Carbonation is just right for the style, not too perky and not too shallow. 4.25  (Overall) Bigfoot Barleywine is a beast of a beer with lots of bitter hop action and a slick, candied malt sweetness to round it out. I spoiled myself by drinking this alongside the verticals and found it a fantastic beer on it's own, yet wait until you try it with some age on it. The possibilities this beer has to age are seemingly endless. This is certainly a great staple representative of the American Barleywine style and I have been picking up some annually for the value and quality it maintains. If you choose to start your Barleywine expedition with any given Barleywine, this is a prime candidate. 4.25  Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.'s Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale 4.16/5.00  Vertical Notes:  2012 Bigfoot (1 Year, 6 Months Aged):  Pours a slightly more golden cream head, thicker in consistency albeit much improved retention and lacing. Sediment is far more heavy. Aroma is notably more husky and robust, collectively less clean. The hop character is fading but still largely intact, herbal hops prevail and the subtleties or citrus and floral notes fade to the background. Alcohol is still notable, although a touch less hot than in the fresh batch. One year makes a difference in flavor with a more revealed sweet malt character and a faded, but still highly potent hop bitterness. The flavor gives way to some unusual yeast characteristics- hints of pronounced pepper, figs and raisins are subtle but far more notable with a milder, more rounded flavor. Alcohol is still very perky and hot, but collectively this is a more drinkable beer than the fresh vintage. Feels very much like a work-in-progress with a half-developed malt and hop profile, still a little rough around the edges and too young to settle down.  2011 Bigfoot (2 Years, 6 Months Aged):  Appearance is similar in quality to the 1 year batch, a touch more foamy and lighter in complexion. More intense carbonation and finer sediment. Aroma is similar to the 1 year batch, the malt bill is slightly cleaner and more bready with hints of peppery and herbal hops still permeating, but becoming increasingly one-dimensional in light of a smooth barley-led character. Aroma is rounding out significantly, the alcohol pinch is tough to spot out in the open. Two and a half years has given this beer a great deal of time to mature and round out any off-notes even more. Expect a faint growing dryness amongst a developed slick malt base with just a touch of creaminess and a fuller body. Hop presence is relegated to some mild bitterness, still balancing out the flavors well. Candied malt characters are coming out from the yeast- dark fruits more notable than ever before, yet still traces of the depth this beer has. Alcohol presence is finally backing off. This beer is going places with age, much more committed than 1.5 years but still certainly not at the end of its journey. I'll keep aging a few bottles to see where this takes us in the coming years.  Recommended Vintage: Fresh or 2.5 years+",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,gleemonger,4.48,"Deep reddish brow, mostly clear, with a large tan head. Looks delicious, like a dessert. Good head retention with lots of lacing.  Big hop aromas, with citrus, pine and grapefruit. Plenty of sweet caramel malt. Nice punch, but also smells like it's going to be smooth.  Massive flavors, way bigger than the aroma even suggested. Tons of the same blend of hops I'm getting from the aroma, but with a big bitter smack too. The malts are just as big with the thick caramel sweetness that never takes over the hop show.  Pretty heavy, moderate carbonation, lingering. Bitterness takes away from the smooth drinkability, but that's pretty normal for the style it seems.  Barleywine as a style is pretty hit or miss for me, but this is definitely one of my favorites. There's no medicinal backbone that many have, yet this is definitely all barleywine. I really appreciate the crazy levels of everything here - maybe just a little less bitterness would've taken this one further for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Left some yeast floating on top and some sticky, sticky lace. Just beautiful. Nose is big sweet malt. Delicious and fat with caramel, toffee and grain. Hops round it out with dark fruits, cherry and floral. Touch of spice way, way in back. Malt opens up fat and bold as it warms. It’s sweetness deepens but never goes over the top. Hops character is always forthcoming, enlivening and bursting with resin and bitter. Alcohol stays well hidden until the end and contributes to the dryness in the finish.

140,2671,DMXLOX22,4.38,"Found a random 4-pack of this beer at a tiny, gas station in upstate New York. Pretty excited to find it since most places back in PA sold out of it quick when it arrived. Lets see how it matches up.  Appearance: pours a dark brown, chestnut, copper color. Quite nice. The red caramel like coloring makes the nice frothy white head look very inviting. It sits very well and dissipates somewhat quickly. The impressive lacing follows down to the bottom. Simply appetizing.  Smell: simply a sweet tone of caramel brandy. Goes over very nice. A second taking and I sense a fruit-like citric hops. Pretty overload of floral hops. Quite delicious. A slight overload of alcohol scent is noticeable and slightly overbearing. But it is quite good.  Taste: at the first sips, it's sweet and enjoyable. Caramel-like flavors are present. A little surprised of the low hop levels even though they were detected in the aroma part. Orchard fruits are detected and help to really round out and balance the bitterness of alcohol and malts. Syrupy flavors are detected and go down well. I enjoyed all these things.  Mouthfeel: moderate carbonation. Full body and goes down somewhat smooth. Finishes slightly dry, but is tolerable. Very nice.  Overall: coming into this, I was a little excited to enjoy this since I've heard good things. And now, I'm glad I did. Who knew a little trip to a small-time gas station would be worth it. Starting out, this was something special, with the superb lacing and delicious aroma. Then the tasting took it to a whole other level with awesome caramel flavors and a slight strike of alcohol, but overall was well-balanced and good.

140,2671,TheCondor,3.87,"I poured a couple of these tonight for Memorial Day with a fellow Veteran. Side poured with standard vigor from the bottle into a Sam Adams glass  Appearance - Pours a deep amber color with a decent one finger head that sticks well to the glass, leaving good lacing. Head retention leaves a little to be desired. A good looking beer though.  Smell - Seems pretty hoppy for a barleywine. I had to do a double take because I was pretty sure the bottle said it was a barleywine, but I wanted to make sure I hadn't mized up and grabbed one of my Union Jacks or something. Thought I may have lost my marbles there for a second. Very hop forward in the nose, much more so than most barleywines. Alcohol and a bit of malts round out the nose.  Taste - While I have not drank as many barleywines as stouts or many of he other styles, this seems agressively hoppy for the style. A wallop of hops is right up front, pine and floral, with the hops flavor carrying through most of the drink. There is a malt backbone to speak of. Wasn't real wild about it.  Mouthfeel - Dry hop finish with an alcohol presence as well. Leaves the bitter aftertaste. Medium bodied, solid carbonation level.  Overall - I just wasn't that crazy about this beer. I think this would be a good candidate for aging, to mellow out some of the hop character. I'm not much of a hop head, so the aggressive hop nature wasn't really up alley. It was a decent beer, but I certainly could have spent my money elsewhere. Oh well.

140,2671,AlCaponeJunior,4.23,"Downright gorgeous to look at, deep amber with copper notes, clear, with a great 3 finger head that lasted forever and laced the glass with sticky chunks.  More like an IPA in the nose, hops are dominant and the typical barleywine smells are secondary. Piney and even grapefruit hops are pungent. A little caramel malt and a little fruitiness provide something other than hops as a side note.  Taste is bold and again, very hoppy. Tastes more like a barleywine than it smells, but still, this one is quite a bit like a DIPA in the taste department. The hop profile is just dominant as hell, this fact cannot be hidden. Fruity and caramel malt flavors do balance out the taste more so than the smell though, and overall it's quite nice!  The body is thick and tangy but the alcohol is surprisingly well hidden. The hops even leave a bit of a bite on the aftertaste.  Honestly, this is a fine barleywine, albeit a lot hoppier and a bit different than I'm used to when I buy a barleywine. I really like this stuff. I can't wait to see how it mellows. I've put a bottle away for a year, and another for two years, will re-try it again next march (and the one after that) and report back.  I really like trying new beers, and I hadn't had this one yet. Overall I'd list it as ""must try."" Excellent job, SN!  Edit for 2013: once again, they nailed it. The original review is more than a year old, but now I've had 5 different years of vintages, both aged, and for the more recent years, fresh. Every time it's just fantastic!

A - pours a very nice amber/golden color with very about an inch of beige head with an aggressive pours. What head there was faded quickly and left a nice lace crown.

The hops are still prevalent, but toned down. A very nice nice balance of sweetness which follows with a slight bite. A touch of pine, caramel and grapefruit. Good malt backbone. I don't pick much booze for the ABV. Leaves a little bitter resinous taste afterwards.  M - Medium to full bodied. Good amount of carbonation. Easy to drink considering ABV.  O - Great beer overall.

140,2671,Andrew61923,4.31,"2013 vintage poured into my Tree House tulip. I'm not sure how I've never had this beer before. Picked up on a whim as a single...we'll see if I go back to get more, as you can't beat the pricepoint for such a highly rated beer (given I end up liking it).  A: After an aggressive pour, I'm left with a gorgeous amber body with a soapy two finger off-white head that gradually fades to leave a substantial halo with some perfect lacing. So far, so good.  S: A lot hoppier than I would have expected, as this is one of the more hop-forward barleywines I can recall. Lots of juiciness for a beer I usually equate to more malt-based with a good amount of caramel sweetness in there as well.  T: Talk about complex. I'm having trouble even picking up on what I'm tasting. I'm getting notes of pine, caramel, Grapenuts, and toffee all mixed together quite nicely. Not at all what I was expecting from what I picked up in the nose.  M: Pretty much spot-on. The carbonation is a tad high, but for a beer that apparently ages so well, I'm willing to forgive this. Not syrupy in the least, which I think is most impressive.  O: I would never say that barleywines are my desired style of beer. That being said, I do love hoppy beers and I was pleasantly surprised by the hoppiness of fresh Bigfoot.

140,2671,verge,3.97,"2013 12 oz bottle from Total Wine & More in Brea, CA. Cool label and funny drawing inside the bottle cap of Bigfoot enjoying a beer with two humans!  Poured into a snifter/goblet forming half a finger of head. Gorgeous deep ruby/copper color, with just a hint of haze.  I can already smell this beer while it sits on the desk in front of me. A deep whiff reveals complexity, some smoke, dark malts, hops, and some alcohol as well.  My first sip is while the beer is still cool (I expect the flavor to develop as it warms), but it is already a perfect harmony of the malts, hops and yeast, with each taking its separate place but also supporting the others. No alcohol flavor yet, but there is some warming after gulping it down. Also a lingering dry hop aftertaste.  (My palette is not the best at finding specific flavors in the mix, but I've drunk enough good beer to recognize interplay between parts.)  As it slightly warms, I find the bitterness taking over more, and some alcohol shining through, and less of the malt is holding up. The balance is lessening, and it seems it's actually becoming more harsh.  A little bit of malt sweetness returns now after a few more minutes have passed. This seems to be the optimal temperature now, with some sweetness in the beginning, some alcohol in the middle, and minutes of hops at the end. Definitely complex! The balance is complete right here. Take note: serve slightly cool, not refrigerator cold!  Mouthfeel is right in the middle. Not creamy, not too prickly, maybe just a little on the watery side.  I'm still new at barleywines. This is a BIG, bold, hoppy version of one, which I'm sure would mellow out with age. Not really my thing, but I can certainly enjoy this as I drink it. Lots to take note of during consumption. Certainly wouldn't turn one of these down if offered to me again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,standardcherry,3.79,"2002 vintage! I was surprised to find that this was a screw-top.  A: Dark red/brown color. Thin white head with little lacing. Looks alright I guess. S: Surprisingly this still smells a bit floral from the hops! Never tried it fresh to compare but I imagine it's a hop bomb. A bit of caramel followed by a slight metallic aroma. T: Huge flavor. Sweet roasted malts, caramel, toffee, a slight hoppy bitterness. There's a bit of a stale flavor, not sure how to describe it. A big alcohol bite as well. M: Thick bodied, creamy and sticky. Nice carbonation to my surprise. O: This beer has held up very well for being 11 years old.

Bottom Line: Get some!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Vogie,4.38,"P: Served in a Duvel tulip glass. Pour is a nice amber color with about a half finger of pancake like head that leaves some lacing around the edges. Added some smoked cheddar cheese on the side.  S: Strong aromas reminiscent of a DIPA. Roasted malts and grapefruit are definitely present here.  T: Very hoppy and roasty. Definitely getting a strong grapefruit presence with some other tropical fruit sweetness in there as well.  M: Light body with a strong bitterness on the backend. Almost gets smoother as it warms.  O: Not a huge fan of this style or hoppy beers in general. I felt the taste was a bit rough and maybe would mellow with some age. However, I am trying to remain objective in this assessment. I did serve this with some slices of cheddar cheese, which was an excellent touch with the hop bitterness. Well made, not my favorite, but I appreciate the complexity.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The aftertaste is very bitter and hoppy, with some orange rinds, and a little sweetness.  M - Thick, very light carbonation.  O - Very drinkable. Huge malts and hops.

140,2671,MikeOlheiser,3.58,"2013 bottle served in a pint glass.  Appearance- one of the best looking beers ive seen in a glass. ruby red with a bit of a brown. almost has a glow to it. has a nice creamy head that sticks around.  Smell- im not big on the smell, some alcohol, and obvious hops and malts in there. I dont get much else.  taste- very sweet with roasted malt. toffee and caramel. and a huge hit of bitter hops. it will linger and even hop heads may not like it. its not my kind of style, but even with the most objective review, this will bite. you get some alcohol in it as well, but not too much.  mouthfeel- syrupy, sticky sweet. a nice amount of carbonation. little creamy. im not big on the feel of this beer.  overall- this is my first taste of this style, and ultimately its a BIG beer. tons of sweet roasted malts, and tons of bitter hops. i wouldnt purchase this again just because its not my style, but for those who are looking for this, you may find alot to like in this beer. 330 calories worth! haha. enjoy.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,nbaeteer,4.03,"Appearance: 2013 version poured into a wide bottom wine glass. Nice ruby red color that really only lets light through in the center when held up to my tv. Sizeable fluffy cloud like head forms right away but dissapates fairly quickly although a thin layer covers most of the top of the beer all the way through.  Smell: Close my eyes and this could be mistaken for a big double IPA except for the more noticeable alchohol smell hiding behind the hop aromas.  Taste: Would be much, much better with some caramelly, toffee flavor to offset the huge hops. Taste in the back of the tongue balances everything out a little bit. Aftertaste says double IPA and when drank without any food or chaser the bitterness lingers too long for me. I get the feeling I'll still taste this tomorrow morning at breakfast. On the other hand, when paired with a nice blue cheese like I have here in fromt of me it's damn near a perfect pairing.  Mouthfeel: Viscous. Thick. Nice level of carbonation considering the style.  Overall: Man, with this amount of hops I would imagine this would be a great candidate for aging. Would be just awesome to do a ladder for a bunch of them and see how they age from one year to the next.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,nootch23,4.27,"This review is for a 2004 vintage bottle. Poured in a tulip glass.  A - poured a dark maroon, molasses color. Can't see nothing through it. Very little to no head on this.  S - all booze. Smells like a barrel aged beer would smell. Picked up on dark fruit notes, cherries, raisins, caramels underneath the booze smell.  T - absolutely delicious. Tastes nothing like it smells. Very smooth, fruity, no booziness to the taste. A little tartness to it which was expected but the fruit tastes definitely are in at the forefront of this little number. Really picked up some raisins, apricot, a little oakiness to it. Bunch of caramel.  M - didn't leave too much of a dry finish. Very smooth going down. Mouth was left with tastes of cherries and dark caramel. Really tasty aftertaste.  O - I was very impressed with how this bottle aged. When smelling the aroma, the booziness made me a little nervous since big boozy beers aren't my thing, but once I took a sip I was impressed with the different flavors that came to the front, more so than a bottle of a fresh Bigfoot. The smoothness really made it enjoyable to drink and it definitely mellowed out over time. Very well crafted barleywine perfect for aging.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Apellonious,4.2,"12 oz bottle from 4-pack, 2013 version.  A - Cloudy dark ruby red. Thin head. Decent lace retention.  S - Grapefruit, dark fruit sweetness, toasted grains, faint booze  T - First sip is a decent punch in the face for your tastesbuds. A little harsh, but this is new, so I guess that is to be expected.. You get some dark fruit and bitter up front, toasted grains in the middle, and some sweet tartness and alcohol on the finish. The tartness makes the mouth water. Which makes you want more right away. Which makes this dangerous.  M - If I knew what perfect was, I would say this is close. Carbonation is on the milder side, almost creamy, but enough to keep it from being overly slick or sticky.  O - Still getting accustomed to the barleywine style, but this is one of the better offerings I have tried. WIll be setting aside a few of these for some years (at least that's the plan, we'll see how that goes) to see how they pan out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Dave1999,3.85,"Pours a bright reddish brown with a small white head.  The smell is sweet and malty with some citrus hops.  The taste is very bitter with a sweet malty backbone. The hops are definitely at the forefront though. There is also a burnt flavour coming through.  The mouthfeel medium bodied with medium carbonation.

140,2671,GreesyFizeek,4.41,"I have had the fresh version on tap at The Tap and Mallet, in Rochester, NY, and the aged version bought at Nathaniel Square Corner Store. The fresh version was very hoppy, almost DIPA like- with tons of pine and citrus zest alongside a strong brown sugar and caramel malt backbone. I will officially review the 2011 vintage, drank in 2014, here. Poured into a Sierra Nevada snifter.  Pours a dark amber color into the glass. Tawny and bright. Not very clear, almost opaque. Good lacing even for a 3 year old beer.  Smells and tastes basically the same- like dark fruits, caramel, little bit of cocoa, brown sugar, toffee, and citrus zest. The pine present in the fresh versions is all but disappeared. Toasty malt- tastes a bit like sweet liquid bread. A little bit sweet, but this still runs toward the dry side mostly.  Full mouthfeel, coats the mouth. Excellent drinkability, the alcohol is simply not present anymore.  One of the best beers to age, and I'm glad I found a cheap bottle of it to try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,flayedandskinned,3.93,"2013 vintage Poured into a standard tulip glass  Appearance: Pours a lightly hazed amber/orange with a towering, frothy 3 finger off white head that has amazing retention. Loads of web like lacing left behind.  Aroma: Big resinous pine-y hops and sweet, juicy grapefruit. Wow, very hop forward for a barleywine. There are notes of sugar-y bready vanilla infused malts tucked underneath the hops. A little bit of alcohol shows more and more as the ale warms in it's glass.  Taste: A big wave of juicy grapefruit and pine resin similar to the nose strikes your palate immediately before a sugary and bread-y malt backbone calms everything and brings the flavor profile back into traditional sweet barleywine territory. The beer finishes off dry and bitter with even more notes of woodsy pine needles and sweet caramel malt left dancing on your palate. There is a light alcohol presence that becomes more apparent as the beer slowly acclimates to room temperature.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, somewhat viscous in texture with moderate carbonation.  Overall: This is the first time I've had this beer in a few years, and I can definitely see why it is often heralded as an American Craft Beer classic. It is definitely hard to believe that this beer has been brewed for over 30 years. It's bitterness can definitely stand up to a lot of imperial IPAs that are brewed today. It is somewhat stripped down in it's complexity, as this bottle very young, but I can definitely tell that this beer will just become deeper and deeper with a couple of years of age on it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Smell: strong vanilla and toffee sweetness smell, very pleasant start. followed up by some piney and spicy hop kick  Taste: strong piney and spice hop, not nearly enough of the vanilla and toffee or malts. some toastiness from the malts. This one needs a bit more time on the shelf  Mouthfeel: pretty bitter and sticky. i wanted to be a bit creamier  Overall: This one just didn't do it for me. i liked the idea of the toasted malts in the barleywine but the hop choice was off for me.

140,2671,trxxpaxxs,3.86,"2013 vintage...  A: Pours a deep mahogany. Tons of dark reds. The head on this beer is one full finger of light beige froth. The foam takes forever to fade, but I get a really nice amount of lacing as it drinks.  S: The nose on this beer is sweet malt, alcohol, and a touch of bitter hops. Honestly... I can't get much more out of it. The booze is quite overwhelming.  T: Ohh boy. Right up front I get a nice mix of sweet and bitter. The malt and hops show up right away. But this beer changes quickly. I get a lot of alcohol, bitter citrus rind, and only a touch of malt to keep it sweet. It finishes the same.  M: Full bodied beer. It's balanced to start, with sticky sweetness and drying bitters. The booze and hops make this really bitter in the middle. The finish is hot, sticky, and back to sweet. But the hop bitters linger on the palate after the beer is long gone.  O: I don't know if I will ever quite understand the American Barleywine style. Why add hops to something that is supposed to be sweet and syrupy? Ohh well.

140,2671,yankeepride,3.02,"2013 bottle. It poured a really nice-looking garnet which opened up in the Chimay goblet I chose. Didn't have a lot of carbonation at first, rather lots of little bubbles that kept coming for a while. Smelled hoppy, but in a deep, imperial kind of way. Floral, not fruity. Interesting taste; taking a gulp, it has a bit of a not-well-hidden sweetness to it, but the hops are there to let you know who's boss. I enjoyed the initial taste, but thought that the hops lingered far too long afterward, and left a sticky, unpleasant coating behind. Overall, I was expecting some more malt presence, and was disappointed by how quickly the big hops came in and dominated the slightly sweet flavoring.

A little bit of sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Really good looking ABW.  S: The hop aromas quickly fill your nose and then cane sugar, fruits, and floral scents come through. Pretty good but not as I had hoped.  T: Very balanced but a lingering sweetness throughout. Finish isn't cloying, though. Not as hoppy as I expected or desired but I did let this age for a few months. Really wish I bought more than one bottle so I could have had it fresh and compared.  M: Smooth, sweet, and creamy. Great body. Proper carbonation.  O: A fine ABW that is extremely drinkable and delicious. Was looking for a bit more from this, though.  UPDATE: 2016 version consumed on 11/22/2016 after the PST in celebration! PKGD on 12/11/15, which was a bit misleading. I wanted to try it fresh (forgetting that it's not a fall or winter seasonal) but then realized that it would be nice to try it after being in the bottle for nearly a year!  I was craving a boozy Barleywine at the store and this hits the spot. Gorgeous amber red with a massive frothy head. Big nose and flavor of toasted malt, resiny hops, booze, and caramelized sugar with some molasses. Hops are still prominent in the finish without being bitter and lots of malt to back it up and balance things out. Very nice!

Alcohol is definitely present, but does not overwhelm. A touch of spice, vanilla and caramel in the finish.  M - Full bodied, smooth and creamy. Mild carbonation, slightly dry finish.

In my humble opinion, this is more of a double IPA than a barleywine. At least on taste alone. Blame the simcoe hops. Blame my East-Coast bias. For some reason, this just doesn't add up. A good beer which will get you nice and toasty, I just have a hard time associating this as a barleywine and more as an imperial west-coast IPA. This is based off taste and smell, not how it is brewed. I devour most things Sierra Nevada, and while I am not disapproving, I extend a word of caution.

M: It is quite smooth with coarse bubbles throughout. Very nice.  O: This seems like what 120 should be. What is up with the beers that I tried tonight? The WWS is the only one that seems to have been labeled right. Bigfoot and 120 should switch beer types. I really wonder what this would be like with some age on it when the hops die down.

Light citrus background likely thanks to the abundant, punchy hops. M - Alkaline sensation on tip of the tongue. Bitterness takes off its coat and helps itself to a seat at the back of the tongue. Neither are goin anywhere anytime soon, not unpleasant; it's respectful, but definitely reminds you of the company you're keeping. Slight syrupy sensation as well from the rich flavors, but very well balanced. O - Bigfoot for sure. Newcomers beware! This is a beer you should enjoy with friends as there's a lot to explore and discuss here. Daunting, but also fun. Great beer for special occasions and robust meals.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Sludgeman,4.4,"3/5/18 - If nothing else, this is a beautiful beer when poured.  Re-reviewed on 4/1/15 - for purposes of scoring I have generally averaged old and new scores with rounding to towards the original score if necessary.  Bottle codes: 123114 / C1 12:25 / 354 14 C2 0035S  Poured into a chalice.  A classic to which all others will be compared, but one which time may have passed by. Still great though. One to never forget and always come back to. A good barley wine, but for me I prefer BWs that are less bitter or at least better balanced. Possibly a higher ABV would better balance the IBUs? 4  A – Pours a clear amber with a one-finger tan head with orange tints. Good lacing. Some modest alcohol legging. 4.75  S – Malty, slight floral sweetness (I remember the aromas as being more intense than this). 3.75  T – Malty, some sweet to start with a herbal woody bitterness into the finish, some acridity likening it to an old ale. As the beer warms the bitterness begins to dominate. 3.75  MF – Medium bodied with a bitter dry finish lasting on the back of the tongue and mouth, but chewy and silky. 4  ------ 2013 edition of the ale. Poured into a pint glass.  A - Pours a clear dark copper. A half-finger beige smooth head, which quickly dissipates to a thin layer. Fine lacing.  A - Slight sweetness, some hoppy floral notes.  T - Hoppy bitterness to satisfy any hop head but not overwhelming. Spice, a little sweetness, good maltiness. Some hints of raisins/other dark fruits that are nicely balanced by the hop bitterness.  MF - a little sharp on the tongue, but also coats the back of the tongue making it a chewy beer. A nice bitterness in the finish.  O - A big beer. Hops. Malt. Alcohol. Balance. Slightly warming. The alcohol does not hide but neither is this beer too hot. A winter warmer if there ever was one. One of my favorite barleywines. Give me some heavier floral notes and this beer would at the head of my class.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,mfnmbvp,4.33,"12 oz. bottle, 2012 vintage. I will update this review with any other older vintages that I encounter, or hopefully a fresh 2013 vintage bottle if I can acquire one.  Poured into a Firestone Walker pint glass.  A - Pours about three fingers of beautiful creamy khaki colored head on top of a rich luscious ruby red colored body. Some vague bubble action happening, and lots of tiny sediment twirling around the glass. Excellent head retention. Some scattered fluffy lacing.  S - Citrus, grapefruit hop presence, still smells nice and fresh even for being a year old. Some bready, malty type smells emerge as the beer sits.  T - Taste is comprised of dark fruit sweetness paired with bitter dank hops. I get like a date / fig type taste loaded to the brim with citrus hops. Bitter, spicy hop presence. Tastes like a well made DIPA, much more drinkable than the Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine.  M - Feel is dry and loaded with bitter hop aftertaste. Resinous and sticky. Tastes very nice.  Overall, it is smooth and highly drinkable for being a 9.60% abv beer. On par with a lot of delicious double IPA's that I've had. Would have enjoyed trying a 2013 vintage with it to see how they compare and contrast to one another, but that time will come I suppose. I am aging another bottle of this 2012 vintage to see how it is in a few years from now, the first bottle I have interred to the wine cellar. Definitely my favorite outing from Sierra Nevada, and definitely their most complex beer I've encountered so far. Looking forward to many more years of this one, that's for sure!

140,2671,lunarbrew,4.11,"A 2013 bottle. Beer pours rich red color with about 2.5 fingers of khaki head. The head is foamy with great retention. Eventually dies off to a thin blanket. Beer smells mostly of hops and a gentle sweetness. A big, juicy, west-coast nose. The flavor is very big, spicy, and hop forward. I notice the big malt presence, but it is clearly overshadowed by the hops at this point. A bitter flavor lingers. Medium-low carbonation. Medium-heavy mouth feel. I would like a bit more creaminess. Overall, a great beer that could use some age (unsurprisingly).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,hermit990,4.49,"2014 Vintage. 12 oz. bottle poured into a goblet. Package date: 12/11/2013. Review Date: 4/21/2014.  Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy burnt orange/mahogany color, allowing some light through. Has about a finger's worth of beige head which dissipates into a thin film. Decent retention and lacing on the glass. Alcohol legs present.  Smell: Very malty nose upfront, lots of bready/roasted grain notes, some underlying caramel and toffee. Lots of hops aroma in the finish, strong citrus/pine, some earthy spice notes as well. More of the sweetness, caramel and toffee notes, comes out as the beer warms.  Taste: Big bitterness on the tongue at first sip, with the hop characters shining through. Lots of pine and grapefruit initially. The hops carry through the tongue, leading into the malt flavors, continuing with a big, roasty bitterness. Finishes with some of the slightly sweeter flavors into the aftertaste, more of the caramel and toffee comes out, joined by lingering pine and grapefruit. Similar to the nose, more caramel and toffee come out as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel: Lots of body to this one. Feels thick and chewy as it travels through the mouth. Very slight alcohol warming in the back of the mouth and throat. Finishes a bit dry.  Overall: This is a very enjoyable release from Sierra Nevada, one I look forward to having every year. Very easy to find in the winter months (and sometimes very much afterward) and quite affordable at $9.99 per 4-pack in this area. Definitely would recommend checking it out if you've never tried it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,NuclearSoAndSo,4.08,"Poured into a beer mug.  Appearance: Pours a deep red-orange color with a not quite one-finger khaki head.  Smell: Definitely citrus/grapefruit notes, maybe a bit of pine in there as well; a hint of alcohol on the nose.  Taste: First thing I notice is a strong wave of resiny hops, lending that citrus/grapefruit flavor. Very floral throughout, and finishes slightly sweet.  Mouthfeel: Has a very creamy, smooth mouthfeel, yet still somehow crisp; refreshing. For whatever reason, this was surprising to me.  Overall: I can tell this is a good beer (although admittedly, I don't tend to go for the hoppy brews). I definitely don't regret picking up a six pack of this, although I can't say I'll be doing that again with much frequency- but purely because of personal preference (I don't really have any negative comments about this beer).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

S- The smell reveals a surprisingly hoppy aroma supported by lots of malt. I almost dipped my nose in the glass and started to get a bit of bubblegum.  T- Malty up front with a bitter finish. Starts with some caramel and other sweet notes and ends hoppy and a tad boozy. The taste balances out as it warms, which is a plus.  M- Medium-bodied, but not as full as I was expecting. Well-carbonated as well.  O- I have little experience with the style, but I was expecting this to be sweeter and less bitter than it was.

S - Roasted aroma consisting of a strong alcohol scent, dark dank hops, slight cherry and vanilla as well. T - Super sweet malt with a bigger hop punch, definitely taste the alcohol, the end of it has some of the roasted flavors. M - Thick and sticky feel that dissipates to a dark and very dry aftertaste. O - A friend recommended I try this, as I'm not a fan of barleywines, while most that I've had are much worse than this, this definitely didnt make me a fan, too sweet, and too boozey for my palate, but I liked the nice hop addition.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,mudbug,4.47,"2013 vintage poured into a tulip glass Results in a reddish brown clear body with a thin cap of foam, sticky lacing clings to the side of the glass, the body of the brew is quiet, no bubbles rise. Normal for a B-wine style. Aroma is nicely complicated with roasty malts and floral hop notes mixing it up, subdued but appealing. Taste is just superb. A huge bitter hop wallop hits first nearly drying things out, but then a nice sweet barley malt slides up and washes the bitter away. slightly candy like, but oh man, that first hit of hops is coming again real soon to start the party over. Slightly thick due to the low carbonation it's quite a wonder to let this get pretty warm and just enjoy the playing of opposites. I've had it aged but I like it better fresh when it's almost like a DIPA and the hop bite puts some teeth into it. This is a superb beer that Sierra Nevada has perfected through the decades.

Nothing is very robust though.  T - Sweet caramel and toffee. Finishes dry with lots of hops. Not my favorite combination.  M - Light carbonation, fairly creamy medium body.  O - The playful melody of hops in a barleywine is something interesting, although I would prefer them subdued with some aging.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

S- big carmelized malt followed by resiny hops and alcohol.  T- huge malt up front with a madiera note immediately followed by a bitter blast of hops with a long bitter finish. There is considerable alcohol warmth from midway to finish.  M-a bit on the light side for a barley wine but this one has been sitting for a year. Still rich and full but not as big as I was expecting.  O- a consistently good barley wine, highly hopped and notably bitter with just enough sweetness to keep it interesting.

Some candied fruits approach once warmed a bit. There is a spicy hops bite throughout but only serving as a supporting character. There is a hint of alcohol deep in the finish, not unlike its placement in the aroma.  M - Medium, full.  O - I am a fan of the style and this is a true classic. Simple and precise. Mouthfeel is exactly what a Barleywine should be. Drink it as the winter turns to spring.  2013 bottle.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Jschuster,3.43,"A - Pours deep reddish-tan. Good carbonation. About a finger of thick head that soon collapses into larger bubbles, finally dissipating into thick lacing on the glass, and a thin skin of clumped bubbles. Tipping the glass forms additional lacing on the side of the glass.  S - Malt (as I expected). Sweet, sweet malt. A hit of alcohol and more malt.  T - Nowhere near as sweet or malty as I would have expected for this style, or from the aroma. Huge bump of hops. Seems to have nearly the same hop profile of their 'Torpedo IPA' just not as pronounced. Can feel the alcohol warmth in the back of the throat. Oddly, the alcohol doesn't seem as pronounced as 'Torpedo', despite the higher ABV. General aftertaste is bitter notes from the hops - but this is refreshing. I do like that about IPAs.  M - Not quite as full as I would have expected a barleywine to be. Maybe that is why the label says 'barleywine-style'? I am not complaining, just puzzled.  O - I went in expecting a barleywine, and got something very much barlywine-like. Close, but not exactly what I thought it would be. Not at all a bad beer. I just expected something other than a high-octane 'Torpedo'. I picked up a 4-pack on impulse at a grocery store, not on a beer hunting trip. I'd consider this a good accidental find, and I'll enjoy the remaining three. Probably not something I'd seek out in the future, however.   -- This was the 2013 Bigfoot.

Smell - Bready, slightly roasted caramel malts mixed with some earthy hops.  Taste - A balanced blend of hops and roasted malts, but the alcohol sticks out on this one. Goes down semi-smooth despite the minor alcohol bite. Bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Thick, medium carbonation, slightly sticky & wet finish.  Overall - Not as balanced as I like, but not bad either. I'm glad I got a chance to try this before hunting down a barrel aged version. Can't say I'm interested in the barrel version anymore. I have read that the taste is all whiskey, and now knowing what the base is like, I have no doubt that is an accurate assessment. I'll probably try the 2014 batch, but will not be getting anymore of the 2013.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,RobertColianni,4.79,"2013 Bottle 6oz. Pours Duvel Tulip  A: Dark topaz body. Perfect, inch high, cream colored rippling, wavy head. Heavy, thick, sticky lacing from the start. Packed frothiness coats the surface as well as the surrounding glass. Spotty yeast islands skimming the surface with rays piercing out from the exact point of the pour. Both the lace and head linger and stick to the glass long after beer is finished. This was one of, if not, the most sexy beers I've ever seen. Pouring it into a wide open, clear Duvel Tulip was the right move aesthetically.  S: Sweet fig, bubblegum nose. Sharp, dry hop presence. Banana and nuttiness once warmed.  T: Huge wet pipe tobacco flavors with resinous undertones. The alcohol is well hidden. As this barleywine warms up vanilla beans bursts out along with a beautiful banana yeastiness. At points, I questioned melon undertones: reading other reviews, I've noticed similar notes. I really enjoyed that aspect as it was completely unexpected and something new to me.  M: Another perfect aspect of this highly acclaimed barleywine is the mouthfeel. It offers a silky smooth, satin-like creaminess. The slight dryness is pronounced by a nice sugary hop presence.  OVERALL: What a fantastic barleywine! The visual aspect alone is a masterpiece built of perfection. The mouthfeel was outstanding, the tastes were complex, and the scents added secondary tones of flavor when quaffing.  NOTE: My first pour was clear. My second pour contained tons of yeast sediment. The yeast was fantastic exemplifying tons of nutty, banana, bubblegum goodness. If you're sharing a bottle, I suggest saving the yeast for your own glass. It's that good!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ThomasAWilson2,4.27,"Novice craft drinkers, please skip right over this one. There’s no reason to subject your taste buds to a shining example of the American Barleywine style crammed into an ale body until your palate has been refined enough to appreciate it. Bitter, hoppy, thick and boozy, Sierra Nevada’s Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale lives up to its namesake.  This earthy, lumbering behemoth of an ale drags its intense flavor profile through your mouth, sending your taste buds into a frenzied panic as you try to decipher the longstanding infatuation with such a rough-around-the-edges piece of craft beer lore. This heavy, impeccably balanced beer is another of Sierra Nevada’s crowning achievements when it comes to some of the more bitter of their offerings. The 9.6% ABV and 90 IBUs present a very interesting combination, achieved through dry hopping with Pacific Northwest hops and open fermentation, along with a crazy amount of malts.  The biggest plus for Bigfoot is it’s cellarability. Storing Bigfoot in a cool, dry place will allow it to continue “brewing” for years while killing off some of the strong alcoholic taste properties; it is a great beer to do verticals* with. Grab a few bottles and store them in their natural habitat undisturbed. A sighting months and even years down the line should yield amazing results.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Sweet malt aromas hint at toffee and molasses while grapefruit and other citrus hop aromas dance around a touch of alcohol. Caramel and slightly roasted malt flavors build a delectable level of sweetness that is met by a bitter bite that brings hints of grapefruit, cantaloupe, and pine resin.

T- A little fruity sweetness and caramel character up front but it finishes with a fairly high and piney bitterness. Not nearly as sweet or complex as I would expect from a barleywine.  M- Moderate carbonation but a bit thin. Not nearly the syrupy barleywine I'm used to and I think the malt flavor really suffers because of it.  O- Far from the best barleywine I've had.

Finishes off with a lingering bitter and a bit of alcohol warmth.  M: rich and heavy as it should be. Not oily like I would expect from something so hoppy and flavored with whole cone hops which is good. Smooth with just a bit of carbonation to keep it from being like syrup.

140,2671,gr0g,4.36,"03/06/2013: 12oz bottle, 2013 vintage bottled dated December 1, 2012. Relatively fresh bottle poured into a snifter. Not that big a head, but very nice lace formation. Not noticing much variation from earlier vintages I've tried. Compared with the taste notes below from a year-old 2011 vintage bottle, there is a hoppiness approaching DIPA levels. Very floral and citric aroma with just a hint of alcohol. Hop bitterness is a match for the big malt body. Alcohol is very well hidden. Bigfoot is very much a standard-bearer for the American barleywine style. Drink fresh if you're a hophead, or let it sit for a while. Either way it's excellent.  01/27/2012: 12oz bottle, 2011 vintage. Bottle dated January 7, 2011. Reddish copper color with a one-finger head that has pretty good retention and leaves some scattered lacing. I must not have saved my notes from the couple bottles I had relatively fresh, but a remember a large amount of grapefruit hop character with plenty of bitterness. On the nose, this year old bottle features plenty of fruity esters, hop notes that are floral and citrusy, and a fuel note lurking in the background.  On the palate, sweetness from the prodigious malt bill hits first, but there's still enough hop bitterness to balance it out nicely. This is bursting with ripe fruit character; an almost equally big citric hop flavor comes in toward the finish. A little bit of booziness that's appropriate for the style. Mouthfeel features a little bit of viscosity and a moderate but soft carbonation - a good complement to a big beer while still reminding you that this is beer, not wine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,BeerFMAndy,4.79,"12 oz bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada tulip. 9.6% ABV, 2013 bottle  A - A tall pour to the bottom of the glass releases a dense, bone-colored, two-finger head with fantastic retention for the alcohol percent in this beer. Thin, wispy lace coats most of the glass above the beautifully clear and vibrant mahogany-amber beer.  S - Floral pedals, herbal spice, and notes of sticky pine resin and grapefruit citrus waft from this hoppy barleywine. A hint of rye bread meets Vienna toast and caramel sweetness behind the hops. As the head lowers, the aroma becomes grassier and more earthy all while remaining modest in terms of alcohol release.  T - Hoppiness, when compared to the aroma, is overwhelming, really exploding with intensity. Sweet and rich caramel malts have a toasted bread flavor that backs up the mounds of hops pretty well, still finishing with a blast of pine and grapefruit while hinting at herbs and flower pedals. Big depth comes from Bigfoot with little alcohol showing until it warms up, subtly releasing fruity, solvent alcohol.  M - The warming sensation from the alcohol is subtle enough to be welcome here, hiding behind the large hop blast of a pretty bitter finish, really developing in the stomach above all else. Bigfoot is smooth and full-bodied but considerably dry from hops and alcohol with just a touch of carbonation prickle aiding the bitterness on the back of the tongue.  O - Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot is iconic and style-defining, incorporating their love for the green American hop cone of joy into a deep, malty beer. This yearly release is always worth collecting for present and future enjoyment as it's proved, it will age exceptionally with time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Tomhet,4.49,"A rich, translucent ruby/chestnut body rests below a massive , soapy three-finger copper-brown head that's fading away pretty quickly. The aroma has always been a favorite of mine in the way that various layers are revealed as more air in gradually inhaled throughout the sniff. A light breath offers a very sweet, sticky roasted caramel note with strong molasses notes that give the impression of a honey-like consistency. Alongside this light breath is a seriously subtle dark chocolate note that coats everything in its path. A stronger whiff fully reveals the grassy hop profile with a hint of sharp citrus riding on the coattails. Some booziness is there but I personally love the way it meshes with the malt and hop profiles.  Super sweet caramel/dark chocolate hybrid hits the tongue first, which eventually glides along to a biting grassy/earthy hop that dominates the middle and even lingers around after the incredibly smooth, slightly warming finish. The taste of this has always invoked the essence of a cool autumn night of solitude out in the woods; as inviting a character that I can imagine. Body is relatively light and wet, making this dangerously easy to drink at an unsafe pace.  Overall, an absolute classic that should be a staple for the season if you don't wish to feel the shame of passing it up.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,gcamparone,3.33,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter . Purchased in Wakefield , rhode island.  A- Pours a clear cherry body with a thick 3"" off white head that reduces very slowly to leave a huge layer of foam. Leaves thick non uniform lacing.  S- caramel, toffee, and some pretty hoppy citrus and pine notes. Smells like a hoppy red ale, like nugget nectar.  T- This is where this beer falls off a very high cliff. There are caramel and light fruity notes - but these are taken over by an extremely cloying astringency that is present from the first sip to a few minutes on the aftertaste. Alcohol comes through too.Not sure what's going on here.  M- medium body, medium carbonation  Im not sure what Sierra Nevada was going for here or how people can actually enjoy this beer - it's an astringent mess with really no barleywine character. I'll have to sit on the other 3 and see how they age.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Gmann,3.83,"Pours a pretty dark amber/copper color with a fluffy off-white head that has moderate sized bubbles. Settles into a solid cap.  The aroma has a caramel like sweetness. The hops are grassy and don't really pop through too much on the nose. The aroma is just kinda of neutral.  The flavor is big and bready. Nice brown bread flavor, a bit woody, a bit toasted, and a big caramel flavor. There is a nice berry fruit flavor as well. The hops are quite grassy with some grapefruit rind. The hops aren't all that flavorful but they provide the needed bitter offset to the big malt. Perhaps a touch of alcohol vapor.  Full bodied, chewy but almost crisp due to the carbonation. A big sweet blast on the palate which is equally offset by the bitter drying finish. Good balance despite the bold flavors.  A different sort of barleywine. Very malt driven but not syrupy sweet. A very drinkable barleywine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Yoda22,4.33,"Poured 2013 edition from 12oz bottle  A- Pours a cloudy deep amber with 1 finger tan head and solid lacing. Looks incredible.  S- Hops aroma really hits your nose first, I would say piney/resin is the dominant characteristic. But this nose is not without some serious malt either. There is a sweet malty, almost caramel malt quality to the smell once you get past the hops. Also some faint bready/yeast and a little booze on the nose.  T- Oh wow. So much going on. Much like the nose there is some good hop bite to this, especially in the aftertaste. Well balanced with the malts with the main things I taste aside from hops being caramel malt and some roasty malts. A solid amount of alcohol comes through as well, but to be expected with a barley wine especially one at nearly 10% ABV. I think I might sense a little vanilla and honey-like flavor in the aftertaste as well, but tough to say with so much flavor packed into this.  M- Smooth/slippery mouthfeel accompanies a full body that coats your whole mouth; the carbonation seems medium-high and leaves a prickly sensation.  O- Just a really great complex beer here. Would definitely drink again. Plan on aging a few. Can't believe I never had it before even though i'd heard of it for years (I guess I rarely if ever saw it on the shelves before it flys off them, now I know why!).  It's definitely quite bitter (but also balanced out by Malt) and strong as hell - but if you like that type of beer this is a must try. Closest comparison I can make is DFH Burton Baton which is another favorite of mine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,BWED,3.93,"Picked up a 4-pack of the 2013 vintage, $10.99 at the Downingtown Wegman's. I've never had Bigfoot before, and I've heard some like it fresh, some like it aged. I decided to pop this one open, and save the other three for other times.  Poured into a tumbler.  A- Translucent copper/amber with a 1 1/2 finger head. Yellowish/light tan, and solid. Retains where it pours. Sticky lacing, and lots of it!  S- Hop sting up fron but hanging on a sweet malty backbone. Some slight caramel, but the resiny spice is most intense.  T- Quite a bitter citrus flavor overshadows a sweet caramel and biscuit background. Once again, the hops do a lot of the talking.  M- A little thick and quite sticky. Bitter tang finish, and just a slight sense of warmth from the alcohol.  O- The hop character is a little overwhelming, which I can see why many people like this fresh. I, for one, enjoy malt, and more balance. I am looking forward to aging the others and tasting a more mellow Bigfoot. A beautiful beer, though.  Bonus review (from my beer and hop hating fiancee): ""It tastes like I'm deepthroating a skunk's anus.""  I thought that was creative.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,rodlavers,4.18,"2013 vintage poured into a snifter. 1-finger, light mocha/tan head, recedes fairly quickly leaving just bubbles and some lacing, not much. Beautiful hazy deep ruby red in color, looks amazing when held up to light, with little bubbles rising to the top.  Aromas of booze, malty hops, resinous piney caramel orange rind.  I definitely get that quintessential hop blend that's present in many of the SN beers I enjoy most, but this one is very dank, like Hoptimum, but more bitter, with a different style of sweetness to it. Caramel, some vanilla flavors with spice clearly present as well. it's really very good, I like this quite a bit. All the elements of the nose are present and accounted for in the taste.  Full-bodied/carbonated feel leaves a delicious blend of aromas and flavors at the end. It's bitter, but very good.  Overall Bigfoot was not what I expected. I think I expected something almost too sweet, and way more boozy in general. This is sweet, but not syrupy, or too much like candy, and the booze is well-hidden/integrated. It's really very good, and has many of the elements that I find so tasty in other SN brews. Cheers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,KYGunner,3.95,"Deep ruby hue with a deep creamy head this Barleywine set up with a beautiful body and texture.  Lots of variety in scent I get raisin, cherry, prune and a sweet malty backbone.  The taste is quite hoppy, but there's malts and raisin. The grappy, raisin, prune or date flavor is strong on the tongue but its dry. The flavor is robust and distinctive. Where this Barleywine goes wrong is where it is dry in taste it is drying in mouthfeel. So much that my tongue actually felt parched and my palate ruined for the rest of the night.  It was enjoyable in body, scent and taste but came up short in feel.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Darkmagus82,3.8,"Poured from bottle into snifter glass  Appearance- The beer pours a mahogany color with ruby red highlights and a small white head. The head fades quite quickly leaving a great level of lacing on the sides of the glass.  Smell – The aroma is big and malty with a strong presence of a pine and earthy hop aroma. Mixed with these aromas are some port alcohol and spice aromas as well, giving the brew a very warming smell.  Taste- The taste of the brew is as the nose would predict. It begins with a strong malty and bready base with caramel, toffee, and cherry flavors that bring a nice balancing sweetness to the taste. As the taste advances further some of the hops detected in the nose begin hitting the taste buds with the sweetness losing much of its potency. The hops are mainly of a pine and herbal taste and grow stronger as the taste moves to the end. Along with the hop flavor so too arrives flavors of the alcohol and spice that were sensed in the nose. These flavors grow stronger more toward the end as well and when all combined the flavors leave a heavy and warming taste to linger on the tongue.  Mouthfeel- The body of the beer is on the thick and chewy side with the carbonation level on the lower side. The thick and chewy nature of the brew wonderfully suits the robust flavors, and when coupled with the lower carbonation, it makes this a slow sipper, just as the brew should be.  Overall- A hoppy style barleywine a little on the drier side. While not my favorite barley it is a good drinking and enjoyable brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

S – Big earthy hop notes, balanced quite well by a solid helping of malt. The hops here are spicy and organic. A little bit of fig, date and plum on the nose too. Little alcohol comes through.  T – Very complex, starts off malty and boozy. Develops into a really nice hop body, again earthy, organic and spicy, fit very well and balances out the sweet malt from the beginning. Some dark candied fruits come through as well.  M – Understandably thick for the style, but the hop profile does make for quite a nice balance.

Color is a ruby swamp brown. Some carbonation can be seen sifting to the top. Not much else to speak of, this is what happens when you age I suppose.  S: Deep and rich. Port, molasses, hops, and huge malt. Everything really blends together well and suggests you are in for a treat.  T: The aging processed has created a beautiful monster. The brash of a newly born Bigfoot has been quelled by the retreat into his cave. Huge hops, brown sugar, raisons, toffee, and some hazelnut. Finishes with burnt meringue and spiced plum.  M: Velvet for the style. Sweet release.  O: When I need something with some soul and body, I reach for Bigfoot. He knows how to chase the baddies away.

140,2671,rdilauro,4.12,"Ok, I have to make a disclaimer here. I have never been a big fan of Barleywine. First, because it doesnt sound like a beer, but instead a wine and secondly, its always had too much malt for me without any crispness. That being said.  I am a big fan of Sierra Nevada brews. I did enjoy this barley wine. While the malt was high, it didnt hit me in the face like a ton of bricks. There was no crispness, but the body style left me with a lot of beer in my mouth. And that was good.  This makes me want to adventure out and try some more barely wines",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,TastyAdventure,4.07,"Reviewed from two days ago:  A - poured into a tinted glass, i can't comment on the color, but had a thin half finger head, although it remained til the end.  S - some hops... I can't recall much here  T - Robust piney hops, but also robust caramel malt. It's like a Hop monster and a Malt monster beer were blended together. Very strong conflicting flavors that can be overwhelming at first. About halfway through the beer, as I start to feel the effects and the beer warmed, both flavors began to blend more smoothly, and became even more enjoyable. I'm not much of a hops fan, but this beer is great.  M - might be the best part. It's thick, but not syrupy or anything like that. Just a dense, hearty body. Moderate carbonation that is definitely needed for one like this.  O - I enjoyed the last half better than the first. I'd serve this barely chilled next time, close to room temp. Very enjoyable. A lot to think about with this one. Definitely one to sit down, sip and dissect. I have one of these in the cellar because it's great and seems like the perfect type of beer to age.  SECOND REVIEW:  Had a 5 year old Bigfoot on Tap. Not quite as enjoyable. Hops nearly faded to nothing, felt heavier.

140,2671,kemoarps,4.07,"This is a 2010 edition. Thank god for islandale. The beer pours a hazy opaque almost ruby amber straw wih a creamy almost greenish tint but more almond off white head. Holy smacks this smells really good. Big sweet honey entwined with the vinous green hops, with a malt backbone to bring it all together. This is a very tasty smelling beer. The taste veers further towards green vines as the hops still play a prominent role even after all these years. Good steadying presence, though, from the malts, coming together and presenting almost with a backdrop of a good cigar. The hops stick with you the most throughout the back, but they're not hte burning sharp hop bitterness so much as kind of a flat, pervasive dull ache. Think more abrasion than laceration. There's almost some hint of just the sweetness of a dark chocolate hidden in there somewhere but that's just silly (but super tasty)...

Perfumey ange herbal hops round out the profile.  Medicinal cherry dominates the flavor, which finishes decidedly bitter and resiny, with a touch of onion and fresh cut grass. There's a luden's cough drop character upfront., which is then dominate by hops. Booze is evident throughout. Caramelized malt provides respite, but it's brief. More complex malt and ester character emerges late.  Body is a tad full, slightly creamy, with carbonation slightly on the low side and significant alcohol warmth.

I wandered into an acquaintance's dorm room, who had a late class on a friday night. All of our friends in the dorm had gone out to party without us! So he called in a favor to a friend with an ID and told him to buy a sixpack of beer that had the highest alcohol content in the store (priorities in college). His friend soon delivered some Bigfoot and the two of us split the six pack and then went out to find the rest of the group. 3 bigfoots a piece and we never missed a beat once we caught up to the rest of our friends who had been out partying most of the night! the 2013 version is much smoother than the 2001 version and brings back all the memories.

140,2671,MaineBrewing,4.75,"A - poured into chalice a beautiful amber body with one finger off white head with a creamy, fluffy texture. Head reduced to an ever present cap and left good lacing.  S - first up in the nose is a hop explosion followed by caramelized malt character and alcohol. Hop notes of piney, resin, and citrus, with a spicyness from the alcohol and yeast bouquet. Slight fruitiness, not sure if from hops, yeast or both. Very refreshing nose for a barleywine.  T - the nose was very hop forward but the taste is all barleywine. Big massive malt taste, burnt sugar, caramel. Flavoring hops are present throughout with delicous notes of pine and resin balancing out the malt, a very complex and intense taste. Finishes nice and bitter with the malt character carrying through the finish and lingering.  M - thick, smooth carbonation, dry finish, mouthfeel is what I would want in the style.  O - The hoppiness of this example of barleywine coupled with the balance of flavor (albeit massive flavor) makes this my benchmark for a fresh american style barleywine. I'm very curious as to how much the hops mellow with a few years of age. Overall this is just a great beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Davepoolesque,3.8,"It pours a murky brown with little head. Smelled like Brown sugar and booze. I'm getting a huge amount of unbalanced bitterness, first time trying this beer.

140,2671,magictacosinus,4.45,"Poured into a tulip glass from a 12oz bottle. Got a single bottle through a local trade. No freshness date, but does it really need one? I decided to consume this fresh to get more of the hop character.  Pours a maliciously strong darkened reddish color with everything immediately coming out as massive: huge bubbles produced by the tulip and an aggressive pour, a giant head, alcohol legs two fingers wide, generous portions of sediment floating in the glass, and lacing that appears soapy and thick. The head simply does not vanish, and at 9.60% ABV, it is simply an astonishing feat on SN's part. This looks like their Celebration IPA with far more rugged and exaggerated characteristics. Incredible stuff, and a very authentic take on the American barleywine style.  At the tip of the nose, there are massive boozy notes soaked with blood oranges, pine needles, tamarind, and papaya. Caramel abounds on the malty side, combined with excessive honeysuckle aromas. Other than obvious sweetness on the alcoholic side, there's a grassy, earthy, near medicinal flavor going on here, which definitely is an indicator of its freshness. Aged, this will probably get a lot more of the caramel maltiness, brown sugar, and perhaps adopt woody characteristics over time. If only I could get my hands on another single bottle without having to buy a 4-pack!  At first, the flavor is met with slight crispness, sugar-tinged notes, and some hoppiness. However, it's heading towards the finish where this beer reveals its massive nature. After the initial flavors pass, the cheeks immediately numb with the dried, piney hop resin, and the yeast and malts meld to create a sensation similar to toffee and perhaps mulled spices. Afterwards, the back of the throat immediately warms up with all of the alcohol, and chest soon follows. The finish seems to last forever, as a combination of citrus fruitiness and funky yeast combined with a caramel profile. This is very deadly stuff. It will be definitely be sipped for the next hour or so carefully and respectfully.  Oh, it's a big beer alright. I'm glad I finally got to try it after so many years. Apparently a few years back this beer was bashed in health crazed articles all over the internet for being the highest caloric beer... Well, they also forgot to mention that it's one of the most *flavorful* high caloric beers you can get pretty easily across the US! This is everything I want in a barleywine, and its easy drinkability and everlasting flavor makes it both rewarding and, at the same time, enough to make it the only beer of the night. No sessionable traits here. Simply a giant beer of epic proportions. SN are forever beer gods for making this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,neenerzig,4.38,"Drank a bottle of the 2007 edition on 10/14/07 from the 6 pack that has been aging in my cellar for about 5 months now. Poured into my snifter. This beer pours cloudy copper color. The head is a good 1/2 inch thick when poured before settling to a nice, fluffy surface layer with some good lace. Smells of hops, malt, and grapefruit are present. Tastewise there is plenty of pine hop bitterness and malty sweetness occurring simultaneously. Strong hints of grapefruit are certainly noticeable as well along with alcohol. The flavors are starting to mellow out nicely compared to the harshness this beer had when it was fresh IMO. Has a crisp, creamy and full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Easy to drink in the way good beer should be.  Re-reviewing this on the night of 2/1/2013  A-4 S-4 T-4.75 MF-4.5 O-4.75  A 12 oz. bottle of the 2007 vintage that has been aging in my beer cellar for over 5 1/2 years now. Poured into a snifter, this beer pours a somewhat cloudy dark copper color with a tan head that is about 1/3 inch when poured that settles fairly quickly to a nice thick ring lining the inside of the glass with some spotty lacing. Aromas of sweet caramel malt, citrus grapefruit, a hint of piney hops, and butterscotch are all nicely present here. Tastewise this beer has a very nice caramel, slightly roasted, malt and butterscotch sweetness upfront followed with hints of citrus grapefruit and a trace of piney hop bitterness. The sweetness really came out more and dominated as the beer sat and warmed up a bit. The harsh hop bitterness I have experienced when having drank both this vintage and other vintages of this beer when fresh is pretty much nowhere to be found now. The taste of alcohol is barely noticeable now as well. What a difference 6 1/2 years in the aging room in the cellar makes! Has a crisp, yet also creamy, somewhat sticky and oily, chewy, thick bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. This one really coats the inside of the mouth and the flavors linger for a long time indeed! Wow! An absolutely fantastic beer now!

140,2671,rickyleepotts,2.8,"I had this beer last year, and I really liked it. I like this style. I am a sucker for sweets, and I remember this one being sweet. It was interesting to read this beer is good both fresh and aged. I think I am going to get 4 bottles, hold 2 to drink in 3 years and hold 2 to drink in 10 years. Not sure I can keep beers around that long, but I am going to try! Next time I am at Total Wine & More I will grab some more. Might need to find a new cellar, though!  When I went to the fridge, it was either this or the Celebration Ale. I figured we could drink this one because it's a big beer over 10% ABV, and it's Phoenix Open week here in the Valley. Everyone is drinking beer, so I figured we would too! Had a beer today on hole 16 and got to watch Phil miss the green. Everyone was yelling and giving him a hard time. Welcome to the Waste Management Phoenix Open!  In the Glass: It has a nice color to it. You can't really see through it, and the head is thin producing a very nice sticky lace. Beers like this are usually thick, and while this doesn't have that appearance in the glass, I can tell you from experience this has a nice, thick mouthfeel.  Nose: This beer smells like melted butter. It has a nice sweetness to it, as well. This is right from the fridge, and barleywines usually smell and taste better as they heat up. I am going to let this sit for a little bit, and take my last drink at room temperature. I poured myself another beer to help me through the waiting period!  Flavor: That is the flavor I remember. However, this one seems a little more hoppy than I remember. It's not as sweet as I remember. Like I said, I am drinking this cold… but that shouldn't bring out that much hoppy flavor. The finish (and I will get to that) reminds me of an IPA. I wonder what they changed with this release. Do they change the recipe every year?  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is not as thick as I remember. Look at me… recalling my experience the last time I drank this. I am also not blown away with the finish. Again, I will l get to that. The beer is a little more carbonated than I remember, and it's also not as thick as I remember. Barleywines are not supposed to have bubbles… I want thick, flat malty goodness from a barleywine. Not champagne bubbles and a hoppy finish.  Aftertaste: Did they change the recipe and make an IPA? I am serious… this tastes like an IPA. Every swallow is loaded with hops, and I am having a hard time figuring out why this is better fresh. This will, with time, mellow out. But man, this is not very good. I am actually a little disappointed in this offering. Considering I like this last year, I had some big expectations. Boo Sierra Nevada, BOO!  Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale - The bottle says: ""Bigfoot is a beast of a beer, brimming with flavor from massive amounts in roasted malt and spicy hops; brewed in the barleywine style, with a rich bittersweet body and whole-cone Pacific Northwest hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Chickenhawk9932,4.15,"Pours a nice mahogany with cooper highlights. It has a thick caramel colored head that goes all night and leaves massive lacing.  Smells of malt, pine, and resinous hops backed by some earthy nutty notes.  Sweet malt up front with chewy biscuit mouth feel. That sweetness is ripped away almost immediately by big pine resinous bitter hops which dance lively across the palate and leave the finish dry. Earthy and nut (almond) notes are subtle but can be sensed slightly towards the finish. A very nice aggressive beer.

S:Toasted English biscuit malts, some citrusy hops, with pine notes too, Some cognac notes.  T: Initially a big wave of grapefruit and piney hops. Follows up with a big molasses, caramel, even slightly choclatey. Hop flavor then comes back much more spicey/herbal and earthy, some floral notes too. Some tea like notes in malt base. Perhaps some grape/cognac/bourbon burn in finish.  M: High carbonation and super soft/creamy. Not heavy though. ABV isnt that well hidden.  O: Pretty big flavors all over the place. A bit palate taxing. Some time in the bottle would definitely make it smoother, as this is pretty fresh. I'm tempted to drink it sooner tho as I enjoy the hop profile more so than the malt profile.

It starts of with a juicy malt sweetness that eases into a fat caramel center. Rounds off piney and hoppy with a nice warming sensation on the finish. As far as actual flavors go, I’m getting some bittersweet cocoa, dried fruit, pine, woody/vanilla, and malt sweetness.  Residual- Slight astringency, alcoholic warmth lingers but is not intense, bittersweet cocoa and pine, a little syrupy  Overall- It’s a complex beer worthy of praise. Very well balanced Barleywine. It’s sweet at first but the hops (and the alcohol) come in on the back half to make it an extremely worthwhile sipping beer. The flavors really come alive as it warms.

140,2671,Pinknuggets,4.2,Bottles (drinking 2012 and 2013 at same time) both into Rock Art Pint Glasses  A:the 13' is much lighter cooper color while the 12' maintains that color but is mostly a darker brown chestnut color both have similar tan heads but the 12' lingers for a much longer time. The 12 is very cloudy and almost opaque while I would describe the 13' as translucent. Overall age does this well imo  S: The difference in the smells are that the 12' is a lot more malt based smells that is very nutty and less sweet then I expected. While the 13' the hops are the more dominant smell they actually smell pretty fresh too while the 12' has almost not smell of hops the malt is there in the 13' though.  T: The taste follows the nose as the 13' is extremely hoppy for a barleywine there are malt elements in there but this is almost a pale ale it is so hoppy not that I don't enjoy it just not what I expected. The 12' is more like what I expected besides being obviously more mellowed out the hops are in the background while the malt has come to the for front with a stronger presence though seems like it could use more time to develop.  M: the 12' is oily but also kind of resiny and definitely has a hop bitterness to its feel. The 13' Is way more oily and smooth goes down easier but not necessarily more drinkable. Both are not quite thin but in-between that and light syrup. The abv is basically undetectable in both which is pretty impressive.  O: Despite being overly hoppy when fresh it mellows out with age and is quite drinkable across the board. I am not a huge barleywine guy but this is my go to favorite is worth a try every year and make sure you grab enough to age. I can't wait to build my vertical up to about 8 years and really see how this thing handles over time.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,mattbk,4.25,"Appearance: Fairly cloudy, fairly more carbonated than I would have thought, nice beautiful ruby head color and rocky head leaving nice lace around glass. Smell: Nice dark fruit, maybe almost a bit grapey, mixing with citrus hops, I'd describe them as maybe dark cherry or maybe blood orange. Very nice. Taste: First thing is the malt sweetness, followed by strong bitterness from the alcohol. Then finishing with hop bitterness. Hop flavor is pretty much throughout the entire taste, again somewhere between grape and orange. Rich caramel malt makes its way through as it warms a little bit. Takes a couple of sips before the bitterness and alcohol steps aside. A very nice beer, definitely complex. Mouthfeel: A bit drier than I would have expected, likely due to alcohol. Certainly not thin or watery though. Overall: The standard for the style, and still enjoyable. I first tried this 10 years ago and it is still just as good.

The taste is similar to the smell. Sherry, and sweet malt with lots of hop bitterness. The malt is trying to poke through with some creaminess that gets quickly dried up with bitterness of the hops. The bitterness really lingers on the back of the tongue.  I appreciate the American character with the huge hop profile but I'm thinking I'll get another and let it age for a year or so to let the hop bite mellow.

Taste: Big bite of grassy hops up front, strong bitterness right off the bat. Then the malt backbone comes forward - very nice, deep caramel flavor with toasted malts and some dark fruit. Has alot of potential, but the hops are pretty harsh right now. This should imorove quite a bit with aging.  Mouthfeel: Thick body with a strong, prickly carbonation. Hops dry out the palate despite the heavy body as it goes down.  Overall: I can definitely see why this is one of the definitive ""cellarable"" beers. There's a lot of complexity and a lot of great things going on, but it really needs to mellow out.

140,2671,DrewV,3.76,"I had to re-review this one for 2013 for a couple of reasons:  1. For some reason, even though this bottle is fresher than the 2012 bottle that I had last month, it has less flavor and it is much less aggressive overall. The flavors are much more restrained and not nearly as cooperative.  2. For some unknown reason, Sierra Nevada decided to change this from a 6-pack to a 4-pack, but raised the price about 20% per bottle. I guess I wouldn't mind, except that the 2013 release isn't even as good as previous years.  Summary: Every year I looked forward to ""The Benchmark"" in barleywines and after the 2012 release, which was incredible in terms of flavor and body, I really looked forward to stocking up on a few cases of this stuff. But due to the 4-pack release, the increase in price, and the lack of flavor in this year's release, I actually stopped my plans dead in their tracks. I only picked up one 4-pack and that's going to be it for this year. A huge disappointment from S.N.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The malt bill aroma reminds me of an english ale.  T: Bitterness is moderate, kept in check by the huge malt flavors coming out. Dark cherries, roasty notes, over rippened plums and prunes. Also getting darker caramel and toffee notes. Hop flavor is, again very low and pine is the central flavor. Balance is on the malt side and the sweetness is much more prominent then the fresh version. There are some flavors coming through that almost taste like coffee or roasted notes that I don't get with the fresh ones also.  M: Large body with lots of residual sweetness. Carbonation is on the low side. Also getting some astringency from the roasty flavors coming out.  O: This 4 year old bottle was given to me as a gift from a co-worker after I would toss him various beers from my travels. It was great to try an aged version of the beer, but I much prefer the fresh Big Foot.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,BMMillsy,3.67,"2012 bottle enjoyed pretty fresh. Pours dark red with creamy head on a moderately aggressive pour. Pine hops and caramel malt on the nose. Flavor is pretty dry, and Iwas expecting more sweetness. Somewhat like a boozy Rye PA with highlights on the hops, a bit of spice, a strong malt backbone but it doesn't do much for the flavor here. Maybe this gets sweeter with age? Similar to an arrogant bastard profile. Good beer, but not what I was hoping for when I cracked it tonight. Oh well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Broden,4.3,"Poured from bottle into goblet.  A- Pours a nice orange color with next to no head. Very thick and appears very viscous when pouring into glass.  S- Smells of caramel, and alcohol. Perhaps a slight hop presence but difficult to pick up underneath all the malt. Smells fantastic!  T/M- Tastes of caramel and sweetness. Deffinetly heat from the alcohol. Mouth feel is excellent with a nice viscous, slightly sticky texture. Goes down way to smooth for its listed ABV. Also has that very distinct Sierra Nevada taste.. Deffinetly be able o pick this out of a lineup.  O- I really enjoyed this beer.. I have stayed away from barleywines for quite a while now due to some bad expierences with them.

Pretty smooth on the nose but definitely a malt beer at this point. Caramel and toffee coated with an unprecedented barley profile. Some sweet leather and smooth alcohol character. Plum or fig... raisin... very approachable.  Again, the bold malt flavors have taken the reigns. Tobacco dryness with brown sugar and caramel. The booze bill is pleasantly understated and the the finish is exceedingly arid. Dessert candies and burnt sugar without any of that obnoxious cloying sweetness.

140,2671,johnsonni,4.37,"2013 - Bigfoot Ale  A - It pours a slightly clearer barleywine colored ale. Very pretty, by looking at it, you wouldn't think it was as high an alcohol content as it is.  S - The smell is a little bit boozy and hoppy. Couldn't smell as many of the flavors separately as I could when tasting.  T - First taste for me was pretty sweet with caramel notes. Became more complex the longer it was out and also got slightly more boozy. However, the alcohol is hidden quite nicely for a barleywine. Possibly some chocolate or hazelnut notes came through in the remains of the beer. First time ever having a bigfoot, must say I truly enjoyed it. Reminded me of a 3/4 barleywine and 1/4 red ale.  M - The mouthfeel was extremely smooth for the amount of carbonation in it. Didn't overcoat the mouth as some barleywine's have done to me in the past.  O - I must say that this beer is one that you must buy if you are new to craft brew within the last year. I've had several barleywine's and this one was as smooth as any.

Pours deep chestnut red with a thick half finger of pale head that leaves small white clusters of lace.  Smells of intense resinous hops, malty biscuit, toffee, band aid and a little booze.  Those hops cross the palate first. Bold, sticky, piney hops. Then some alcohol burn followed by toffee, sweet bread, citrus rind, earth, caramel and medicinal booze. It's pretty darn hot but there are some nicely blended flavors.  Oily, medium full feel with a fairly heavy dose of almost prickly carbonation. Coats the tongue for a long lasting bitter pine and earthy finish.  This is another treat that makes me glad that I've started branching into barleywines over the past six months. Maybe not the best I've tried but it is top shelf. The hops are very enjoyable now but I can tell that there is enough good stuff going on that those toffee and earthy notes will be right fine with some age, particularly once the alcohol has settled down. I know I'm late to the party, this being my first experience with Bigfoot, but I encourage anyone waivering on the decision to try to take the plunge.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

S - Whoa...it's been a while since I've tangled with the Bigfoot, and I forgot how hoppy this furry bastard was. Big juicy/earthy hops jump out and intermingle with some caramel and biscuity malts, with some slight booze in the background. Very enticing stuff.  T - Starts off with the juicy side of the hops with some grapefruit rind and mango and then segues into some bready, biscuity malt, touches of brown sugar and a hint of plum, finishing off with a little earthy hop bite and a little warming alcohol. The hops seem to be the main player here, and overshadow the other flavors. Could use a little age, but still really nice stuff.  M - Medium bodied, coats the tongue with flavor without being overbearing. Mild carbonation rises from the bottom of the glass.  O - While I thought the first few sips were mildly abrasive, once my palette adjusted I really came to enjoy the 2013 Bigfoot. Big hops over a malt body, smooth mouthfeel, and seriously excellent lacing. I would absolutely recommend this beer.

But in today I am getting a brown pour with ruby red notes, decent clarity, and a small head that simmers down to a ring and lingers.  The aroma is of barley malts, sweet sugar, paint thinner (in a good way), and caramel. The 9.6% ABV is more subtle than I would expect.  The body is medium.

The syrupy viscous feel in the mouth is too wonderful not to mention first. It comes with a short-lived sugar sweetness. Bitter grapefruit renders the sugar a memory. The citrus morphs to tarry pine. It's that bitter. I immediately want to throw this in the cellar. The sweetness calls out from the bitter abyss, alluding to a dairy-caramel sweetness that's promised with a year or two of cellar aging. But the spicy alcohol heat teams up with the bitter hops to silence such rumors. Stepping back to take in the aroma, a pungent honey and ripe melon seem to confirm the ghost of the sweetness. As the glass warms, the bloated bitterness deflates a bit, and a moist, grainy bread emerges, allowing that original simple syrup sugar to creep back into the room.

140,2671,ESPNman,4.33,"A - Pours a deep hazy amber, producing one and a half fingers of almost-white head. It pours almost like a syrup, coating the glass and leaving cappuccino-like trails in the head. Solid lacing.  S - Holy hops, Batman. At first whiff, it was difficult to convince myself that this is a Barleywine (style ale). There is some burnt sugars, a hint of fruit, and some sweetness in the nose... but mostly it's similar to Hoptimum where the dominant scent is sticky fresh hops. It'll be interesting to see how this fades as the beer ages.  T - While the hop bite is certainly present up front, there's a lot more to this beer. Sticky caramel coats the tongue, and is backed by fig and a bit of floral flavors. Definitely some candy-like sugar in there... with maybe a bit of apple as well. Although it's not what I was expecting from the style, I think this will age into a wonderful example of the style. For now, it's just an exceptional beer.  M - Medium bodied, thick, sticky, and a good example for the style. The mouthfeel improves more than anything else as the beer warms.  O - Another solid entry into the SN archives.

140,2671,zac16125,4.2,"12oz bottle into a snifter 2013 vintage  A: Pours a translucent reddish amber with 1 fingers width of very light khaki colored head which dissipates down fairly quickly to a thin outer rim and small whispy center. Leaves only trace patches of lacing.  S: Surprisingly, there are tons of hops on the nose. After many big whiffs some other aromas start to come out including burnt sugar, caramel malts, and booze. For the most part the hops dominate though, and it smells likes a DIPA. Very nice though.  T: Sweet component more prominent in the taste than the nose, as the hops finally take a backseat. Maple syrup sweetness, burnt sugar. Although the hops arent as prominent as the nose, they are still very much a part of the palate profile with a nice citrus, piney bitterness, and soapy hop notes I sometimes get in IPAs. Very tasty.  M/D: Low carbonation, which is appropriate, full bodied, somewhat thick and syrupy. Great mouthfeel for a barleywine. ABV is exceptionally well controlled and drinkability is absurd. About as perfect as it comes here.  O: Overall, this was very, very good. This one kind of surprised me, although Im not quite sure why cause it seems like most SN offerings I try I find to be quite good. I do think that a lot of the great characters in this beer are hop driven, so Im curious as to how it will age once those nice juicy hop notes fade. I know this is one of the most commonly cellared beers, but IMO it probably will decline with age. Im going to throw a couple in my cellar to find out.

140,2671,tectactoe,3.88,"Pours a hazy, copper-amber color with a light tan head; recedes pretty quickly and leaves very small amount of lacing here and there along the glass. Aroma is full of deep, sweet fruits; dates, figs, and plums, some light boozy notes on the nose, maybe some woodiness in the background.  Taste is full of what you'd expect in an American barleywine, and it follows the nose quite nicely; booze-soaked, dark fruits, dates, figs, plums, raisins. Ripe, juicy, and sweet; brown sugar, burnt caramel, light toffee. Some fairly heavy, floral hop notes travel up and down the palate to bring a fighting edge to the sweetness. The brew gets slightly bitter for a second, but remains a primarily sweet beer from the heaviness of the malt. Definitely hopped up quite a bit, though.  The booze is heavy, not quite hot, but slightly more than just ""warming"" - almost bourbon-like in character with a slight vanilla and butterscotch undertone. Thick, mildly syrupy, and just a little sticky on the palate, a bit on the lower side of the carbonation scale.  This is a nice take on the American barleywine style, and it's relatively cheap for a six pack. I plan on aging some of these to see how they pan out. My guess it that the hops will fade a bit and the brew will get a little sweeter, and hopefully a touch more mellow.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Overall (4.0): Having read some of the other review which state this is a very balanced beer, I'm not so sure about that.

140,2671,JamesMN,3.9,"Appearance: Slightly hazy dark maroon hue with some visible sediment and a thin foamy off-white head.  Aroma: Rich caramel that is both sweet and aromatic. Some pine and a little earthiness from the hops.  Taste: As advertised, the palate is sweet with a strong bitterness that sneaks up on you. Starts with rich amber and caramel malts that provide a hint of sweetness. However, if you blink you just might miss those flavors because the hop bitterness swarms in after about the halfway point and provides some serious IBUs as well as a great earthy flavor. The aftertaste is somewhat dry and completely hop forward. Even though the hops play a major role, it is still a balanced brew. Not quite as sweet as I had anticipated but that lack of sweetness might be why it is not cloying at all. Lots of flavor and no hint of the 9.6% ABV. Would love to see them do a special release of this and bump that ABV up a bit to really let Bigfoot loose.  Mouthfeel: Just a couple hairs below full bodied with smooth carbonation. Easy drinkability which is an accomplishment given the style.  Final Thoughts: I've been looking forward to trying this beer since hearing about it through BA. I'm not disappointed, especially given the price ($10 for a 4-pack). Would I drink it again?

Color is Dark amber in light and almost dark copper inside the glass. Ruby hues are present. A large number of bubbles. Somewhat hazy with some minuscule suspensions of dry hops.  Aroma: Very citrus and resin hop heavy upfront aroma. Super and fills the nose like an IPA. Some malt backbone and sweetness is not at all apparent. Hidden caramel malt flavor. Some alcohol is minutely observed. Aroma subsides very heavily in some time after pouring.  Taste: Strong hop presence in the taste as well but accompanied by a very solid malt profile. An excellent mix of bittering citrus and resin hops and malts. Malts have a caramel, toasted flavor and keep fighting the bitterness but do not succeed. This one plays with the palette just like a more balanced IPA does. Aftertaste in the mouth is bitter. It takes some time for palette to come to terms with this one. A very good display of hops and malts, i must say. Wins my heart. Mild alcohol presence for its strength. Provides a warmth while drinking. Finish is bitter dry.

Style Rate: 4.75 Personal Rate: 4.75  I am so impressed by this brew. Not very far from my favorite style and provides the kick through its strength. A beer to fall in love with, for the price.

It nose is fairely close to balanced, but its still more hoppy than malt in the nose.  Taste: Highly bitter hops start this beer off. Big resinous pine notes.

Finishes with a lingering bitterness of grapefruits and citrus peel.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. This beer is well carbonated. For almost 10% you dont get much booze in this beer.  Overall: This is a solid American Barleywine. It will probably cellar well based on the carbonation level present in this beer fresh.

If it weren't for the bittering piney hops, this beer would be WAY too sweet for my tastes... I can't say enough how bitter, sweet, syruppy, malty, alcohol""y"" this beer is. It also reminds me slightly of Dogfish Head's Burton Baton because of the strong ""alcoholic syruppy caramel oakiness"". It's surprisingly well balanced, but in a ""everything is strong"" sense.

Seriously this is just a hoppy girlish tyrant coming for your tastebuds with no regard for your station in life. Sweet, syrupy, bitter, chewy, malty hoppy. Alcohol is disguised very well in my opinion. There is no real dominant flavor in this pile of hops, but it is quite simply delicious. Huge malt, huge hops, gives the effect of caramel drizzled lovingly over hops before some more hops and malt are added. Just a bomb of flavor, not for the weak of spirit, mind or body.  M – Really really nice mouthfeel on this and you can only attribute that to quality brewing and great game plan. Because this syrupy substance is just carbonated enough to make it feel nice and silky smooth on the palate, coating the inside of your mouth, and the bubbles keep it from being overly bogged down.

140,2671,JohnnyBarman,4.05,"Single bottle, 2012 edition, from a six-pack courtesy of one Mr. daryk77 - cheers man! Shared at a recent tasting.  Poured into a goblet. Bright amber, clear, big foamy head, sheets of lacing.  The nose certainly reminds me of the western states - pine, citrus, resin, big malt, caramel, toffee, and a very light booze character  Similar taste as in the nose, with strong resin and pine flavors, not overly malty, slightly astringent. Unreal how little of the booze shines through - feels and tastes more like a bold American pale than a barleywine. Well hopped and quite enjoyable.  Medium bodied, nice carbonation, slightly astringent. Again, little trace of alcohol to be found.  Great brew, flavorful but not overwhelming in terms of strength. Aging would treat this beer very well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,superspak,4.2,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, 2011 vintage bottled 12/30/2010. Pours lightly cloudy reddish copper color with a nice 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big orange zest, pine, grapefruit, caramel, molasses, toast, biscuit, herbal, and earthy spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of big pine, orange zest, caramel, raisin, molasses, toast, biscuit, herbal, floral, grapefruit, earth, and piney spiciness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, orange rind, pine, caramel, toast, molasses, biscuit, earth, herbal, and piney spiciness on the finish for a while. Great balance of flavors with good complexity; nice bitterness/sweetness balance; no overly cloying flavors at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and slightly crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent barleywine! Nice balance and complexity of flavors; very smooth and crisp to sip on. Highly enjoyable offering with the age on it.

Lacing is very nice, and the head stays around for a while. The beer is kind of an orange red color. Very pretty.  S - The aroma suggests a caramel backbone behind plenty of fruity/citrus and spicy hops.  T - The taste follows the aroma pretty closely. The hops do not overpower the sweet caramel malts like I thought that they might. There is a boozy kick at the very end - to be expected from a beer of this strength.  M - A little bit thick and chewy. Definitely NOT a thin bodied or watery brew.  O - I can see where this beer would improve with age. I plan on saving one for about a year to see if it changes much.

140,2671,Beer_Runner,4.13,"The neck label show 2012, but there are no other markings on the bottle or label that provide a more specific date for bottling.  A: A slow pour into a standard pint glass resulted in a two-finger head that was a darker shade of khaki and very dense and clumpy. Over a very long session the head dissipated to about an eighth of a finger and left plenty of lacing. (This was a pretty impressive head for a high ABV beer.) The brew was a darker shade of copper and barely translucent with some cloudiness.  S: The aroma was very mild and consisted of some pine and citrus, and just a little bit of malt sweetness, too.  T: The taste had a wine-like quality. It was a blend of mild citrus, some spicy bitterness, and a strong underlying caramel malt sweetness that held everything together. There was also a little bit of alcohol heat that helped to underscore and bring out the flavors.  M: The body was right about in the middle of the medium range, and it had just a little carbonation. It was also fairly smooth for a high ABV beer.  O: The hops flavor in this beer made it a little different take on a barleywine. Yet, it was still pleasing to this barleywine fan. It had a very wine-like character and somehow it was able to bring out the best characteristics of both wine and beer. I think the unusual balance makes this beer worth trying for a barleywine fan; but, just be aware it has enough hops balance to be near the border of a DIPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Still very hoppy, I'd be very curious to age this a bit and see how it settles down. Really malty carmel taste with a sweet fruit I can't place.  M: Very malty, full bodied mouthfeel.

It isn't overly diff in color than any other good lookin' dark beer and the aroma is fine, but nothing to raise an eyebrow over...but WOW, the taste, makes this a pretty special beer. 1st taste is eyeopening---in a good way. It stays that way, & continues all the way to the end. A lively beer. Looks good when poured into a tulip glass with a deep cream/white foamy head.

I hope this isn't permanent!  Anyhow, I smell a bit of dark fruit and some grapefruit. Some caramel. Feels blunted, and I know it's my broken nose and not the beer.  Tastes: like a malty-ass DIPA. This is the 2012 vintage, and it's still hoppy as hell. Bitter, grapefruit, pine, touch of dried dates and figs. Big toffee and caramel. I can definitely taste the sweet, sweet backbone, but this is super hop forward. American Barleywines, the few I've had feel more like variations on malty DIPAs. Like, why are 90 minute and Majaraja not B-wines?  I've got 2 aging. I'm wondering how they'll taste 1 year out. I think these were bottled in January, so I'll tell you in a few months.

140,2671,claspada,3.53,"Last years release. Pours a dark coppery with color with beautiful khaki head and sticky lacing.  Aromas begin initially with copious amounts of sweet malts. As it warms you get some vanilla and blood orange and pine from the hops.  The tastes begin with caramel malty sweetness and an immediate kick of resinous pine hoppiness. As it warms you get this stone fruit character that reminds me of apricots. The citrus hops come out more as well in the backend with quite a bit of bitterness and pine.  The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with medium carbonation. Finish is a combination of citrusy bitterness and toffee maltiness. A little brash considering the year of age but this beer could be cellared for years and years.  Overall this is a classic American Barleywine that really needs some age to come into it's own in my opinion. 2 years minimum for the brash hops and the alcohol to mellow to that sweet spot where it then becomes ""drinkable"".

The color of the beer is a deep red/brown color with some pretty heavy haze. Wowza.  Smell: A mild malty/hoppy aroma. Does not at all represent the taste in my opinion.  Taste: My first barleywine and WOW. This is definitely one of the strongest beers I've ever had. It has a heavy alcohol flavor, mixed with some serious roasted malt and also hops. The finish is also very bitter and dry. Among these flavors I also get a little bit of grassy taste, as well as a coffee flavor, which is most likely from the roasted malts. Halfway through the bottle though, I found the beer a bit cloyingly sticky and sweet. Yeah, we go it, it's a bitter beer ... it almost became annoying to me that they tried to balance it. Instead of balancing it, they made it almost undesirable.  Feel: Super smooth, super creamy... as if it was out of the tap. Medium carbonation.  I must say, this surprised me. I was expecting a fruity-ish beer, but didn't get that at all. It makes no sense to say given that I've given it the rating I have, but barleywine isn't a style of beer I see myself drinking much. This is a super tasty beer though, and I'd get it again in the future.

140,2671,mick303,4.5,"Pours a really nice head, which sticks around for a good length. Colour is a reddish amber-brown. Steady carbonation. Looks great, leaving good lacing.  Smell has pleasant and heady malt and hop notes. Sort of wafts out with salty cheese aromas. Very rich, distinct. Creamy and caramel like. Excellent.  A real flavour kick. Rich prune-character, a dry hoppiness that is very complimenting. Rolls of flavour and constantly developing on the palate. The alcohol takes on a rich (rum-like) syrupiness, but it isn't overly aggressive despite the ABV, ingitrated and tons going on.  Mouthfeel is very big, carbonation present but fairly minimal. The drinkability, despite the high hoppiness, is really quite paleatable, though the alcohol encourages sipping. Aftertaste is quite bitter balanced with enough dry malt, and it lasts forever, leaving a lingering resiny taste.  Should be experienced by all, definitely recommend.

Taste - An over the top citrus and malt explosion. There are floral notes, toffee, caramel, and a delicious amount of pine.  Mouthfeel - A burn from the alcohol, but also a thick, syrupy mess.

Head is a fluffy tan color that hangs around and leaves a coating on the glass.  Smell is somewhat lacking. I had this beer relatively cold so it could be my fault. I get the pine from the hops, a hint of toffee. Smells like a sweet ipa if that makes sense.  Taste starts out as expected, a sweetness that is malt forward. Unfortunately, the malt is immediately blown away by what I believe is cascade hops. Taste ends on a bitter note rich in pine.  Mouthfeel is moderately heavy. The mouth is coated in a pleasant molasses, but again that pine just dominates.  This beer screams for aging. I got the six pack as a gift and one is already in storage.

A - Dark red body, slightly hazy with some floating protein particles. There is also a decent amount of rising carbonation. One finger high light tan head. Super clingy with excellent retention.  S - Despite the age, it still has a hop kick. Pungent pine and a touch of grapefruit followed by huge dark fruit notes. Caramel, toffee, brown sugar and a touch of booze.  T - Somewhere in between an American and an English style barley wine. Starts off with the rich maltiness of caramel, toffee, and caramelized figs...then comes a blast of pungent piney hops. Very dank and resinous. Less fruity than the nose. Finish is bitter with some alcohol warmth.  M - Silky and coating, yet medium bodied with ample carbonation.  O - Its no surprise it held up well to a bit of aging.

The hops are mysteriously still relevant alongside a dash of noticeable alcohol and light oxidation. Taste is muted toffee and caramel, faded pine and some faint wet cardboard. Its bitter, still. With the muted flavors the alcohol does make itself known. For being 11 years old this is incredible. Light oxidation complimenting against toffee and caramel and a surprising piney hop presence.

Mouthfeel: big body along with a silky smoothness and a well-integrated carbonation yield a wonderful creaminess that hits the spot. I like it a lot.

Head is tanned and quite sticky to the glass. Low carbonation.  Big big big sweet malty aroma with equal amounts of spicy, peppery, floral hoppy goodness. Damn. This does both ends of the spectrum and doesn't cut corners. Right in your face.  Here again the hops and malt loom large. Full on malt with a decent alcoholic kick threatens to derail things but that sharp hop bitterness cuts across the palate to keep the sweetness in check. Huge character right through the beer but still manages to keep things from getting out of control. Lots of talk about how hoppy this can be fresh and this is no exception. The bitterness lingers into the finish slowly subsiding before the next sip.  Mouthfeel is considerable which helps carry the beer but combined with the alcohol forces a slow sipping approach.  Wow!

140,2671,beagle75,3.79,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. 2012 vintage.  A: Clear, dark amber color with less than one finger of sticky turmeric-tinted foam head. Heavy lacing remains on the glass.  S: Very spirituous, with signature spicy hops a la Sierra Nevada and complex vinous/caramel/crystal malt. Alcohol heat is suggested.  T: Begins very off-dry, with dark citrus hop aromatics that complement well the caramel fermented grain. Acidity is mild into the middle where bitterness comes on early. It is a very clean beer, flavor-wise, which seems to allow the palate to really dwell on the bitterness that becomes more and more pure and oppressive through the finish. Alcohol is barely tasted until long after the finish when lingering bitterness finally fades.  M: Thick viscosity, syrupy and warming on the palate, with moderate carbonation.  D/O: The archetypal American barleywine; Bigfoot's focus on hops is as contemporary as any of the style, but it seems to drop another weight class in terms of strength with every passing year. Once maligned as America's most unhealthy beer, it is now a reasonable sub-10% abv in a world where bigger is assumed to always be better. It shares the same house quality of spicy (fresh) Cascade hops that adorns Sierra Nevada's pale ale and Celebration IPA. Often tried by unsuspecting celebrators, this isn't really a beer for changing minds or creating trends. However, it is always there in case one's taster needs recalibrating.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

It's got such body, yet somehow comes across as fresh too. Not at all what I was expecting. The bitterness doesn't quite reach bitter initially, stopping just short and just leaving a cool refreshing sensation that gives way to a nice caramelly maltiness that's somewhat sweet but not too much. The bitter shows up a little in the aftertaste. And what nice gentle buzz off of 12 ounces.  O - I was actually a little worried about this beer from what some had said.

Only now do I truly savor all of its glory and suckle from the Hairy Beast.  *12oz bottle with my trustee 10oz taster nonic  A: Bigfoot portrays a gorgeous dark amber ale with some ruby-chestnut tint to it. Brilliant clarity exemplifies some fantastic conditioning. My pour produced a cakey mass of dark khaki head. Redonkulous longevity with cavernous pockets of air. Leaves chunky cob webs of lace upon the glass. Quite the spectacle.  S: Smells of booze, grainy cereals, piney hops, candied citrus fruits and a good dose of kettle cooked malts. Like a citrus infused liqueur almost. Caramelization really sets in as the initial aroma and alcohol vapors dispel.  T: Flavors open with a bit of sweet raisin and sweet kettled malts. Huge charge of hops brings sticky boughs of pine and citrus fruits to the forefront with a dank earthy hemp stem element that seems to linger long after the drink. 9.5% ABV heat warms the gullet and gives off a touch of booziness. Nearing harsh drinking this young but still doesn’t detract from the enjoyment here. Toasted breads and a suggestion of chocolate to go with those raisins.  M: Mouthfeel is moderately heavy to the point of some chew on it yet seemingly lighter with the higher carbonation factor. More creamy overall with a nice dry and crisp finish. Resinous hops just sap at the palate.  D: BEASTY! The quintessence of the American Barleywine and one that drinks amazingly well fresh. A bounty of caramelized malts and hoppier than most DIPA’s out there. Everything is still relatively balanced and in its place. A touch hot at times but does not derail the experience whatsoever.

Smell - Sweet, syrupy malt aromas, dried prunes, a pine and citrus hop, a touch of caramel, all backed by a bit of heat.  Taste - Starts with a bitter citrus and pine hop, then notes of dark roasted malt begin to pop up. Subtle caramel notes, a hint of black liquorice and prune. Finishes with an odd waning bitterness, almost like pure orange essence with a touch of pine, and some heat makes it's much expected appearance.  Mouthfeel - Full-bodied, thick and syrupy. Carbonation comes across as tingly, which is about right for the style.  Overall - One of the first barleywines I ever tried, and it's still one of my favorites, though buying it has become less a requirement and more a 'maybe next year' deal as the price has increased over the years.

Appearance: Served in the funkiest-cutest glass ever (12 oz), with a great looking body, bubbles on the side of the glass going up and up and a bubbly head that lasts and leaves thick lacing afterwards.  Smell: Not too bad, considering how underwhelming the rest of the beer is. Nice citrusness, faint tropical aromas and even a bit of wood. Fruitcake, sweetness.  Taste: Lots of malt, booze. Musty hops. Resin, stickiness and some aperitif-style liquor, plus rum. Mighty disappointing, to tell you the truth. Hardly a barleywine, more like a faded IPA or strong lager.  Mouthfeel: Rather average for a DIPA and more so for a barleywine. The maltiness is almost overwhelming, and there is a lot of heat as it goes down. The hops are faded, stomped upon by a bunch of overweight cows with saggy tits in a dirty, industrial cowpen somewhere in Texas sloppily cared for by ilegal aliens paid for in food and lodging only. Low, almost non-existent carbonation to boot.  Overall: Drinkable alright, but not a pleasure. Lacks balance, excitement, flavor.

Smell: Small hints of caramel and lactose along with a evidently citric hop backdrop. Bready as well as dry notes of sandalwood comes forth while a almost pungent pine scent appears and re-appears in stages.  Taste: A real punch of burnt and roasted malt along with a really zesty and resinous bitterness is what strikes this palate (no, it's not the palate that's writing, nor is this site the particular palate I'm talkin' 'bout, but enough of them palates, eh? OK, one more: palate). There are some slight notes of caramel but they are quickly subdued by the other aspects. The alcohol is present to an extent, but not in a blatant or overwhelming manner. As it progresses some dark fruits do pop up, namely plum and figs. It truly brings out another dimension to this beer.  Mouthfeel: Full 'n' creamy just like I like 'em. Low-to-medium in carbonation with no need for more.  Overall: Even though it's an AMERICAN Barleywine, it's not what I'd come to expect.

Grapefruit, citrus and pine from the hops floating atop a sweet malty base of caramel and bread.  T/M: The hops dominate up front, with lots of grapefruit and pine, a taste profile very similar to a big, malty DIPA. But there's a ton of complex malts beyond the hops, and blended in is some sweet caramel and toasted malts that come out more and more as the initial hop hit wears off. Going down, there's an alcoholic bite, some burnt malts, and a bit more pine.

It's strong tasting as you would expect and want from the style, very malty and rich but not sweet with a definite alcohol warmth and something that for lack of a better term I'll again call woodsy.This is a thick brew but not cloying as there are sufficient hops and a spicy/herbal aftertaste to balance the richness.  Overall, I'd highly recommend this to people who enjoy barleywines. I'm never quite sure what ""drinkability"" is supposed to convey.

140,2671,SaxmanRick,4.77,"While I have enjoyed Sierra Nevada Big Foot for many years, I realized today that I had not formally reviewed this benchmark/landmark American Barleywine. Today’s 2014 (almost 2 yrs old) Big Foot, was served into a SN Torpedo English pint glass. I have been lucky to share a 6-yr vertical recently and have an appreciation for the pace and manner of Big Foot aging.  12oz bottle pour with a two-finger, off-white dense head. Lacing was solid (literally) and left thick sets of rings as the level dropped. Liquid was dark amber, maybe a slight haze.  Smell was rich caramel with a hop balance. A definite, but slight, alcohol presence. Some red fruits (dark cherry or plum). Very inviting. You know from the smell that this is going to be an epic beer.  For an American Barleywine (higher hops, thinner MF), this ale ranks at the top. First two years of cellaring tend to feature super hops with a solid malt base. 3-5 years feature a fabulous malt base – very caramelly, some hop attitude – but still balanced and fabulous. Year 2 might actually give the best of both worlds…hops, fruit, caramel, sweet, alcohol.  This is definitely not like an IPA or even an IIPA. The mouthfeel is just slightly syrupy, thicker than typical ale. Just right for this style.  This BW has been a favorite of mine for many years.

140,2671,scottfrie,4.5,"Five year vertical done side-by-side with friends. 2008-2012 vintages.  A: All five years have a similar looking pour of clear caramel liquid beneath a couple fingers of light tan greasy and fluffy head. All heads took a long time to fade into a dense film that left spotty to wispy lacing down each glass.  S: 2012: Sweet smelling, caramel, hop resin, toasted breast crust, grape juice, very bright smelling. 2011: Much more caramel and toffee than the `12. The hops aren’t as bright but they are still very noticeable. 2010: Big sweet fruit juice nose, candied fruits, starting to smell syrupy. 2009: Similar to the `10 but more potent. Very sweet and syrupy. Lots of caramel. 2008: Even more so than the `09. Syrupy, almost no hops on the nose. Slightly boozy. Smells aged.  T: 2012: Bitter hops, bright, strong and fresh tasting, lots of pine resin and citrus, some caramel and toffee present, light tobacco aftertaste. 2011: Hop bite is gone but it’s still very hoppy. Sweet malt and candied fruits poke through more. More roast to the taste. 2010: Hops are resinous. Caramel is turning syrupy. 2009: I’m starting to get notes of vanilla. Syrupy caramel, leather and tobacco more noticeable. 2008: Sweet overall with flavors of candied fruits, leather, tobacco, and vanilla. Hops are still resinous and noticeable but they have lost their edge. Beer is still fairly bitter, but far from how it is fresh.  M: All vintages had a full body, soft fluffy carbonation, with a slick and greasy mouthfeel. The older the vintages got the smoother the mouthfeel got.  O: This beer ages very gracefully. The older the better in my opinion because the flavors get more integrated, but fresh is still very delicious.

Bubbles surge from the bottom of the snifter to keep about a two finger head maintained for at least an hour on the beer. Talk about an impressive presentation.  The aroma is of grassy, piney hops with some caramel and malt lurking in the background.  The taste is of toast and toffee but it is quickly overcome by fresh hops flavors. The beer finishes with a bitter bite but is surprisingly dry in its finish.  The beer is full bodied and has a very solid mouthfeel.  Overall this beer, at least for me, set the bar for barleywine.

140,2671,mechamifune,4.08,"One of those beers that i've had numerous times over the years but never got around to reviewing, so here it goes....Pours a pleasant caramel color with a slight white head into a tulip. Strong lacing and carbonation. A nice, inviting looking beer.  Smell is slight sweetness and dark fruit. A bit of an earthy, hoppy armona lingers.  Taste is fruit up front, followed by notes of toffee and then sticky, somewhat citrusy hops. A very full and complex taste that doesn't finish overly bitter.  Mouthfeel is the right combination of smoothness and crispness for the style. Despite the relative hoppiness, it doesn't feel particularly resinous.  Overall this is one of my favorite examples of this style, even if it may be a little over hopped for the style (there in may be the reason i like it as much as i do). Almost more of a hybrid of a malty dipa and a hoppy barleywine. Give it a shot if you are at all curious about either style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,RedBear84,3.5,Being a barleywine I sampled this beer in a tulip. The beer has a rich creamy head that lasts though to the end and leaves thick lace on the glassware. The color is brown. There is surely a pronounced malt nose but there is a warning of heavy hops to come. The initial feeling on the pallet is creamy with a bite.

It's nothing impressive but the flavor is nice and rather malty  Mouthfeel - Light bodied and low in carbonation. Not easy to drink due to it's style, but for what it is, it's quite manageable for those familiar with the style  Overall - If you're looking to try out a Barleywine style ale, this is the most ideal one I can think of.

I opened a bottle of the 2009 last night and was surprised at the way it has mellowed over the years. I would give that one a 4.65 or maybe better.  This is not a beer to pop open after mowing the yard, expecting to have your thirst quenched and your harsh mellowed. This is a beer to pop open and have with a 16oz ribeye, cooked medium-rare with a tablespoon of clarified butter on top and a side of sprouts.  I have tried many Barleywine style ales and this is by far my favorite. I always get a case every year and put back at least half to let age. This is a complex brew that complements a fine meal.

140,2671,afrokaze,4.2,"Notes from a poker night mini-vert tasting, 4/16/12. Scores are a rough average of all 3 years, because they were all excellent :)  2010: Hops are still surprisingly forward, with a long piney hop burn after each sip. More vanilla has started to come out, along with toffee, tobacco and leathery notes. Alcohol is noticeably calmer. Smooth body, dangerously drinkable.  2011: Loads of earthy and piney hops, caramel malt sweetness, more chocolate and coffee malt than 2010. Prickly mouthfeel and sticky finish. Less juicy than I remember it being fresh.  2012: More juicy fruit and dank hops, sweet caramel malt, pine resin, hints of vanilla and some dark fruit, earthy spice. Creamy mouthfeel and seems less hot than 2011.  The preferences were unanimously 2010, 2012, 2011, and this year's bottle was honestly almost as good as the 2010, but in a much more aggressive way.

140,2671,mayorwalda,1.87,"I review this the way I have because I have a number of expectations when cracking open a ""barley wine"" and this brew fulfilled almost none of them.  Sierra Nevada’s Bigfoot Barley Wine Style Ale Man, I love Sierra Nevada! Let’s pry the cap off this thang (12 fl oz bottle).  Here comes the aroma! More like “ah-ro…what?” Do I smell hops? Weird. I really do, I smell hops; and basically no malt. Smells can be deceiving sometimes, I guess.  Let’s move on.  On the pour, Sierra Nevada’s barley wine looks like a barley wine, at least. It has got that dark red, unfiltered beauty which signifies to me, visually, “Hey, man, good job picking that barley wine.” But my nose is calling the bluff here, “Hey, guys, I smell hops. Just hops.” We’ll let senior Palaté (I have no clue how that would be pronounced) mediate this discussion.  And, so, on the first sip, well, my nose had this brew’s number from the start.  Holy hell, are there hops in here! There are really, really a lot of hops in here. So much so, that I am not getting any sense of maltiness at all—certainly nothing from our subtle, sweet, amazing friend, barley. No malt/barley sweetness frolicking across my tongue this time around. What a bummer.  Instead of the smooth, round tastes I’m used to, I’m getting the taste of something a lot more hop-centric. Something like an imperial IPA. I know Sierra Nevada loves their line of pale ales, but it still surprises me that they’d overwhelm this style with the tank full of hops they must have used to make this. I find that it’s a strange decision as a person smitten with this style of beer.  All the things I love about barley wine seem to go ignored in this. The sweetness is not there. While on your tongue, this brew drinks like an IPA. Very green, resinous and slightly floral. After gulping it down a bit you get that typical IPA trail of bitterness on your tongue which waits eagerly for you to reinforce it. There isn’t a moment in the process of enjoying this brew that you do not taste hops.  Word on the street, though, is that this thing perks up—or rather mellows the ‘eff’ out—with age. This is the 2012 release I’m drinking, so, if this thing needs age, well, I haven’t given it that. To be honest, I’ll have no trouble shelving two or three of these for a year or two. I would like this beer to really live up to the sweet mellowness “barley wine” signifies to me. If it takes a year or two, I guess it’s an investment I’m willing to make.  At any rate, the skinny is like this. (I promise from here on out I’ll be less whiny.)  A(ppearance): Well, Sierra Nevada’s got the barley wine style down in this department. This brew most certainly has the dark, red, copper color of the beloved barley wine. The head gathers tightly and eagerly. This brew’s head has a piney, resin texture.  S(mell): This is where things seem to deviate from expectation. The bouquet from this beer is completely composed of hops  T(aste): As far as taste is concerned, this beer is green and hoppy. There is little in the way of malt taste. I mean to say that it must be there, but it is completely overwhelmed by the hop intensity that it’s not present in a way that can be appreciated. It’s probably only serving, at this point, to keep us from going cross-eyed from bitterness. I will say one positive thing about this brew, though. This beer comes with an ABV of 9.6. That will serve as a surprise to anyone who doesn’t do their homework before cracking this thing open. The booziness of a 9.6 ABV is totally hidden in this brew. Kudos for that, Sierra Nevada.  M(outhfeel): The mouthfeel is a bit tacky, with lasting bitterness that asks to be endlessly refreshed. A great quality for an IPA; not, in my opinion, a good quality for a barley wine.  O(verall): Well, as this review is part of my ongoing Quest for the Best Barley Wine Under $14.99, well, I have to totally fail Sierra Nevada’s offering. As a beer in general it’s nice. I’d like to see it called something different because I don’t think it lives up to the qualifications they put to it… At any rate it’s a quality, high ABV ale and deserves a lick. You should try it if for no other reason than, it’s another good hop-centric beer from Sierra Nevada. But, again, it doesn’t even qualify for a rank in my quest…",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,mjpolzin,3.8,"A little conflicted about this beer as I liked it but it tasted more like an IPA than a barleywine to me. This isn't the first barleywine I have come across this year with a heavy hop presence so maybe I just need to realize that ""IPA-like"" barleywine is an acceptable form of this style of beer.  The color was a dark, reddish amber. The smell and the taste was of citrus, pine and like I said, a heavy hop presence. Tasted like a crisp, refreshing pale ale making this barleywine a possibility to drink in the summer whereas most barleywines would be saved for the winter.  EDIT-I drank a bottle of the 2012 tonight as it is just a month or two shy of having a year on it. The hops are still very heavy. There is maybe a little bit more malt character coming through but not much.

140,2671,CaptDavyJones,4.5,"Poured a clear deep ruby red color from a 12 oz bottle (2012). Nice one finger eggshell colored head that dissipated fairly quickly. Visually this ale looks beautiful. Blast of hop aroma upfront which slowly disappeared over time. The caramel malt aroma slowly takes over as the hop presence diminishes with hint of sweetness from the alcohol and some fruity esters. Lots of lacing on the insides of the glass that stays around for eternity. On the palate, the hop bitterness is evident upfront, only to be completely drowned by caramel malt sweetness. Very chewy and almost full-bodied mouthfeel. Definitely a big beer that needs to be sipped and enjoyed. Every sip as time passed by had a slightly different taste profile. Taste just keeps getting better with time. One of the finest American barleywines and one of the best beers by Sierra Nevada.

The aroma is of of piney hops, some bread, and clean water. Taste is very hop forward: pine, bitterness, resin, and syrupy sweetness predominate, and one gets bread and caramel. This is very bitter, but in a super-nice way. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy and syrupy, and Bigfoot finishes mostly dry and surprisingly easy drinking. Even though this was like no barleywine I’ve ever tried (much more like a double IPA), it is just fantastic and world class.

140,2671,Hophead717,3.6,"A: Deep ruby, amber, with a sudsy one finger head.  S: Fresh hops, with notes of grapefruit and lovely pine. Strong caramel maltiness in the back, punctuated by fruity notes. Lovely smell.  T: Wow, this is an overwhelming beer. Strong, borderline astringent, hops upfront--mostly pine, with some fruitiness. In the back, there's a toffee malt bomb. Strong alcohol finish, also.  M: Medium/thin body, with significant carbonation.  O: This one is not meant to be drank fresh. I'm a hophead, but the combination of overwhelming hops and a malt bomb doesn't work well for me. I do, however, see lots of potential for cellaring this one.

140,2671,dbrauneis,4.2,"2012 Vintage  A: Pours a crystal clear copper color. The beer has a finger tall beige head that reduces rather quickly to a thick patch and a thicker ring at the edges of the glass. Significant lacing is observed.  S: This beer has a really nice aroma, starting with some sweet caramel malt notes. After that the hops take over, first with the intense pine and then followed by some lighter tropical fruit notes.  T: The taste really follows the flavor... there is a light caramel malt sweetness up front that is followed by lots of hops. There is definitely a dominant presence of pine hops that have a real lot of lingering bitterness (and quite a bit of bitterness as well). Some subtle hints of tropical fruit hops. Some alcohol taste is present in the finish as the beer warms.  M: Medium to full bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly sticky/resiny.  O: A little surprising that there is so much hoppiness in a barleywine. There is a light presence of the alcohol in the finish of the taste and a slight amount of alcohol heat left in your mouth after drinking. Not the easiest drinking beer but still enjoyable. This beer is meant for sipping and probably only one in an evening. Definitely nice complexity to the smell and taste.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Rich copper colored body, with a small cream colored head, good retention, and sheets of creamy lace up and down the glass. Aroma is sweet, full of honey, noticeable booziness, floral hop note.  Flavors are bitter and surprisingly hoppy after all this time. Lots of honey sweetness, toffee and caramel, lingering bitterness. Citrus note as well. Some fusel alcohol mixing with a bit of coating sweetness and a bitter hoppy note in the finish. Powerful and tasty.  Creamy mouthfeel, medium body, with medium-low carbonation.

S: Huge boastful waves of hopped up sweet malts. The nose on this is simultaneous--versus a chronological narrative--and it hits with heavy hops and bright tropical fruits, backed by a sweet malt body.  T: Boozy orange marmalade, into bright grapefruit, and ending in a very bitter hop linger. There's a ton of booze, sugars, and intriguing tropical fruits in there as well. Not a ton of dimensions, but truly great in the few dimensions it hits upon.  M: Creamy and coating, then boozy and dry.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,LiquidAmber,4.57,"Review from 2/2011 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Drinking a three year unevenly distributed vertical; '11,'10,'03. The newest ones are a nice clear red amber, the '03 pours a somewhat darker, more opaque red amber. Minimal head on the '03 and '11, nice thin, long lasting head and lacing on the '10. The newer ones have a sweet malt, fresh hop aroma. The '03 has a more subdued sweet malt and dark fruit aroma. '11 has distinct fresh hops, sweet malt, dark and dried fruit and an almost pine flavor. '10 is the best with dark fruit and the sweet malts becoming more forward and mellow, but with a nice hop finish; not as fresh hopped as the newer one, but my favorite of the three. The '03 has completely mellowed, with a sweet malt, dark fruit and English barley wine flavor but with a subtle hop finish. These are all excellent and I look forward to tracking the newer ones through time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,MagicJeff,4.03,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. 2012 edition.  The appearance is deep ruby, almost reddish. Pours a nice finger-length head. Retains head pretty well.  Smell: Pine, citrus. Smells earthy.  Taste: Carbonation is there. Malt and toffee start. I taste a citrusy, resinous finish.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation plays wonderfully on the palate. Leaves a chewy taste in mouth. Alcohol there, but not overbearing.  Overall: I honestly have never had a barleywine before. Don't know if they are for me, but you can appreciate what you have here from Sierra Nevada. I want to age one of these and see the results, I think it would mellow this beer out tremendously. Definitely worth trying.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Toffee, raisin, toasted bread crust. Yep, this is it. The booze is present, but not overpowering. Big and chewy, sticky, and delicious. This is a great one. And factor in price and availability, this might be the best barleywine for the buck. I'm laying one down as well.

T: A lot of malt right up front, toffee, caramel, very hoppy and bitter finish with a strong hop aftertaste. Really wonderful.  M: Medium bodied, moderate carbonation.

Appearance: A nice clear reddish brown color with a two finger light tan head, which leaves good lacing  Smell: Heavily hopped, very piney, a little resinous, and a little citrus, there is malt in the background  Taste: Very piney, medium resin, some citrus, and a good backing of malt, though the balance leans greatly towards hops. That will change with some age. The malt is carmely and not highly developed yet.

140,2671,rangerred,3.9,"2011 vintage poured into a snjfter.  Pours a slightly hazy deep reddish brown with a tiny tan head that clings to the sides of the glass.  Aroma is full of toffee and wood. Malt definitely dominate but there is a piny, earthy hop presence as well along with a hint of alcohol.  The flavor starts off quite malty with toffee and a woody mustiness that is possibly the hops showing through. Some caramel follows but everything is quickly washed away by an insane drying bitterness. The hop bitterness is very strong and coats the back of the tongue and the throat long after the beer is swallowed. Warmth from the alcohol is mild and not too noticeable.  Overall this is a tasty beer but not as balanced as I would have liked. The malt faded away too quickly and the hops were a little overwhelming. Nonetheless this is an excellent sipper and one I would have again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ArtimusBeerimus,4.37,"1998 vintage  My sister-in-law accidentally opened this long-saved beer today and there wasn't anything left to do but smile and drink.  Only had a fairly small sampling, but the aroma was heady and strong of raisins/dates/molasses. Surprised at the thinness of the brew - it wasn't watery or anything but I certainly expected there to be a heavier mouthfeel. Very smooth drinking and I didn't get a lot of ""hotness"" from the alcohol. Wasn't sure what to expect (wasn't expecting it at all, actually) and the tasting conditions were far from controlled, but the mellowness of the beer was pronounced. Very smooth and a lip smacker.  And my sister-in-law managed to escape mostly unharmed. :)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,drtth,4.13,"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. This is from the 2012 release and while I’ve had this beer several times before this is the first time I’ve been able to take the time to review it.  Appearance: As poured the beer is a clear, reddish cherry wood color with a 1 ¼” fluffy off-white head that begins to recede fairly soon, leaving a ring of foam and fine lacing clinging to the sides of the glass. Sipping creates a pattern of scattered speckles of lacing that cling to the side of the glass. Although the head has receded to a thin layer of foam about a third of the way through, that foam persists and sipping continues to leave sheets of foam and speckles of lacing on the sides of the glass.  Smell: The aroma has a nice crisp pine resin and grapefruit zest character to it. While there seems to be some dark caramel in there that part of the aroma is way in the background. As the beer warms a bit the dark caramel shows more.  Taste: Initially the flavor is mostly bitter hops with just traces of barley sweetness in the form of dark caramel and in the background. As expected from the nose, the hops provide a strong pine resin and grapefruit zest component to the flavor. As the beer warms a bit the dark caramel flavor comes out a bit more.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is on the full side of medium bodied and prickly with the fine but abundant carbonation. The finish is relatively long and mostly bitter as the background sweetness fades, leaving the dry bitterness to linger on and on.  Drinkability and Overall Impression: This one is for slowly sipping both because of the ABV and because of the intensity of the flavors that emerge as the beer warms. My overall impression is that this beer well deserves its high place in the ranks of the American-style Barley wines. I’ll be having this one again in the future and can recommend it to anyone who wants to try a great example of the style. All that said, I think my preference is that I prefer this beer with a few more months of bottle age on it to soften the bitterness, bring forward the malt a bit more and to integrate the flavors a bit more.  13 Feb, 2015  Drinking one from the same 6 pack of the 2012 brewing. The appearance is much the same as 3 years ago. The aroma is similar but more muted in that the pine has receded and mostly what comes through is grapefruit zest with a bit of caramel in the background. The dominant flavor is grapefruit zest but traces of the malt still come through. The mouth feel and carbonation are much as they were three years ago but the finish has become less bitter although the grapefruit is still there to fade away. Nicely drinkable and the beer has held up well, but I'm not at all sure there has been any improvement with age.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,acevenom,4.88,"This is the 2012 vintage, so this is very young. Poured into a chalice. Pours a dark, reddish brown with a one and a half finger length tan head. Carbonation appears to be plentiful and the head does not dissipate quickly like you would expect from something greater than 9% alcohol. Some lacing gets left on the glass. This looks very appealing. The aroma is of slightly sweet dark roasted malt and the piney hops are very forward. The hops explode in the mouth on the first sip and the malt character is also very detectable. It's slightly sweet. There's some citrus in the taste as well as some alcohol in the aftertaste. As the beer warms even more, the sweetness from the malt comes out even more. The hops flavor bursts in mouth, providing even more balance as this beer warms. Wow. The mouthfeel is full and it's very smooth. The beer coats the mouth well and the carbonation helps the drinkability of this beer. This becomes even easier to drink as it warms even more. This was my first American style barleywine and I have to admit that I was impressed with Bigfoot. This is simply an excellent beer and one of the best I've ever had.

Sweet hops and alcohol. Some citrus. Very juicy and inviting.  T - Whoa, still a bit hot on the first sip. Second sip was much smoother. Ok, starts out with a nice bittersweetness. Then hops and yeasty bread. Malts balance it out. Citrus is present toward the end with just a hint of mustiness. Aftertaste leaves a tiny bit of alcohol lingering. Quite nice and definitely complex. The only thing I'm not loving is the bitter bite that sticks with me after swallowing.  M - Great mouthfeel. Smooth with plenty of carbonation.  O - Really nice beer.

140,2671,CraftBeerTastic,4.42,"Ba Review #147 Served On: 03/23/2012 Glassware: Pint Glass (Duvel Glass Broke!) Labeled ABV: 9.6% Date/ Code: 2012 Release  Found this at Ye Old Spirits Shop in Frederick. Their selection is always phenomenal!  Look: The beer poured a deep rich semi-clear caramel color with lighter brown hues along the edges. The head was almost 3-fingers of beige foam made up of large bubbles. The head slowly sunk down into the glass like a scoop of ice cream.  Smell: Sweet brown sugar notes with a hop bouquet of grapefruit and pineapple. Seemed to have more of a mild aroma than past releases.  Taste: First was a sweet syrupy note of caramelized brown sugar mixed with a hoppy grapefruit. The middle was of a pleasant bitterness with more of the grapefruit coming through and some alcohol warmth. Finish was a lingering citrus tang with the bitterness carrying into the aftertaste. Mouth feel was very heavy and when coupled with the intense complexity – made this one out to be a sipper for sure.  I always look forward to the release of Bigfoot each year. This year’s release seemed toned down slightly with more of the floral grapefruit notes dominating rather than sweeter and heavier malts like in past releases. Regardless, I was not disappointed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,TempeBeerMan,4.37,"Poured from a bottle into a nonic pint.  A – Pours a clear dark copper hue with a one-finger off-white colored head which dwindled but never fully disappeared. Good amount of patchy lacing.  S – Powerful aroma of west coast hops, with underlying notes of malt, toffee, maple, and earthiness.  T – Big grassy/floral hop element balanced with flavorful esters of caramel, fig, and date. Complex and balanced. Some musty esters from the hops. Hop bitterness lingers forever on the tongue. 9.5% abv dangerously well hidden. Delicious.  M – A perfect example of “big and chewy”. Carbonation slightly higher than I would expect for the style, and is more in line with a typical SN brew. (Not a bad thing)  O – Definitely not a traditional barleywine by any means, but a refreshing take on the style and a thoroughly enjoyable beer in nearly all aspects. May be slightly too hop forward, but if it’s a flaw it’s a minor one. Recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,CMB2012,4.5,"12oz bottle 2012 vintage. Served at cellar temp. into tulip.  A- Deep ruby red leaning towards brown in color. Looks clear, but it is difficult to determine with the darker color. The head is off white to beige and very thick. I easily produce two fingers and it just sits there waiting for me to force it out of the way.  S- Sweet caramel/toffee and sugary molasses. Because the hops are so prominent in this American style barleywine I also get some cantaloupe, honeydew, very ripe mango, and other tropical fruits. The hops are citrusy and piney and are a big player in the nose. Once the head has faded enough to show the liquid I do get some alcohol, but not much.  T- The flavor is similar to the aroma, but much more complex. Sugary, sweet malt that is difficult to describe. Caramel and toffee, the usual suspects. Some chocolate surfaces too and then the hops hit! Very bitter in the middle with grapefruit, citrus, and pine needles. The sweet and bitter combo can come off like pine and melon. The finish lingers with a bitter tingle on the tongue and sugary sweetness. Almost no alcohol is detectable.  M- The mouth on this one is pretty full bodied, somewhat chewy, with some viscosity and stickiness. It works really well with the flavors and style.  O- This is a great beer that I look forward to every year and one that every fan of craft beer should try at some point. I think I have finally reached the point in my drinking career that I can cellar a couple of these for next year and I am excited to try it aged.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,deadonhisfeet,4.36,"2012 edition reviewed on 2/23/12 (pretty fresh - it just got here yesterday). Poured from the bottle into a New Belgium tulip. Appearance is a beautiful clear ruby-amber color with a massive sandy white head. There are some nice cascading bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass, giving a nice effervescent quality. This beer is absolutely majestic looking. The nose has huge pine and citrus notes. I heard this was one of the hoppiest barleywines made, but goodness!  Taste - wow! That's all I can say. Malty sweetness hits your tongue first with the flavor of cherries and toast, then a HUGE rush of hops comes in and scours your tongue, making the beer citrusy and almost briney. It's like having a mouth full of rose petals. Just past mid-palate, it starts to soften a bit and the mouthfeel gets slightly creamy and oily. Just as you swallow, there's a nice gentle warming touch of booziness which leads to a slightly dry finish. For the next several minutes, your mouth is coated with citrusy hops. Wonderful!  What can you say? This beer is a classic and, honestly, this was the first time I have ever had it. I have read that, with time, this beer develops great complexity. I bought two 6-packs and will cellar the rest of them (well, maybe I'll have just one more first).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Really intense bitterness and a complex flavor to match. Thick sugary malts, a bit of caramel, some dark fruit as well as the citrus from the crazy hop profile. A unique earthy tone here that I don't recognize from any other beer. M- A bitter aftertaste that leaves your mouth dry and your stomach warm. A pretty damn intense beer.

S: Right from the get go I'm getting huge malt aromas. Big caramel and juicy dark fruits. Some alcohol is present.  T: Wow is this hot. I think that's what I'm getting anyways. Also massive hops are tangling with even more massive malts. Hops are mostly citrus and the malts are all caramel and dark fruits. The finish is extremely bitter. What are the IBUs on this beast?

S - A surprising amount of citrus hops hit first, with the typical barleywine malt notes following. Great aromas from this one. Citrus hops, caramel, touch of alcohol tinging. Smell is a bit dim on this one, and could use a bit more aroma.  T - Hop bitterness and citrus hit first with the red-style malts not far behind. There's a great balance going on here, with each one constantly fighting/complimenting each other. Aftertaste is the same, hops and big malt going back and forth, and it lasts forever. Awesome.  M - Thick, thick, thick mouthfeel. Coats really nicely. Could use a tad softer carbonation but time might help.  O - Fantastic beer from Sierra that I look forward to every season.

S: Surprisingly the aroma isn’t very heavy. Some brown sugary malt and piney hops.  T: Boom! There’s so much flavor! At the start, I can’t help but associate this with brown sugar but the art of it is that it’s not at all cloying. Piney hop bitterness bites you soon after the malt sweetness coats your tongue and pulls you to the finish.

140,2671,nrs207,4.11,"2012 bottle poured into a DFH Signature glass.  A - Nice 1 finger off-white head that leaves a lot of nice lacing sitting on top of an amber/red clear beer. Beautiful appearance.  S - Get some citrus and pine resinous hops. Some sweet malt. It's like a big DIPA with a ton of bready and caramel malt to back it up and make it a barleywine. There's some alcohol in the smell also.  T - Get some alcohol in the beginning and end. It's not overpowering, but it is there. There is some definitely toasty sweet malt backing up a citrusy, piney, and grapefruit hop flavor. It's a really nice tasting beer.  M - The alcohol is there in the taste, but doesn't burn or detract from the drinkability. It's slightly on the heavier side of medium bodied, and it is super smooth and coats the mouth.  O - This is a really nice interpretation of the style. I've had a few American barleywines, and this is right up there. They seem to be mostly IPAs with tons of barley tossed in to keep things interesting (as opposed to English barleywines), which is fine by me. I'm excited to see what happens to this as it ages. I had a 2008 Old Guardian last night, and if this ages as beautifully as that did, I'm looking forward to it. Definitely pick some of this up. Only thing detracting from it right now is the alcohol, but over time I'm looking for that to fade and to get some of the really nice malt backbone to shine through.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,TechTriumph,4.38,"From notes on 03/01/12: Bottled: 12/30/11 at 8:26am; Poured in a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.  A - Just over one inch of off-white billowy, fluffy head with excellent retention; Dark copper in color; Appearance is pretty clear; Beautiful webs of lacing left behind  S - This is dominated by hops for sure with little else poking through; Good bit of citrus and floral hops with a touch of rye and toast; Faint whiff of alcohol as well  T - Without a doubt, this is a big, robust beer, and I'm loving every sip; Mild alcohol shows up in the beginning, immediately followed by a heap of grapefruit/orange citrusy and piney hops; After the strong hoppy flavor comes a wave of toasty malts with just a bit of sweet caramel; There's a nice, sharp bitterness that lasts throughout the entire taste and lingers  M - Leaves an oily, hoppy coat in the mouth; Finish is very dry; Good amount of carbonation; Just a notch over medium bodied; A bit of warmth felt from mid-taste and into the finish  O - I thoroughly enjoyed drinking this beer and wish I had bought more than a single. I don't usually gravitate towards barleywines, but this offering from Sierra Nevada is one I could drink time and time again. All components of the taste work extremely well together, even with the mild alcohol and strong bitterness. The warm, dry, and oily mouthfeel would be very hard to top as well. I wish this beer was available year-round, but it certainly works well as a Winter offering to bring warmth during the harsher months of the year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,teromous,3.99,"2012 Bottle  A: It looks fantastic. It's a dark shade of brown, with dark red hues peaking around as light passes through the brilliantly transparent beer. There is an off-white fluffy head that leaves lots of lacing. It's perfect.  S: The scent is very subdued. Not surprisingly, there is a frontal scent of roasted barley that smells very good. Very, very light earthy hop aroma.  T: Big and bold. It has a nice huge malty taste, with light remnants of alcohol. There is medium bitterness and a definite roasted character.  M: The mouthfeel is very nice. I don't get alcohol burn despite it being a young barleywine, and it is very smooth. It is medium-to-heavy bodied. It starts out feeling medium, and finishes a bit heavy.  O: I would recommend the beer, and would drink it again. It is a most welcome take on the many American Barleywine variations. It is heavy on roasted flavors, and would go well with smoked meats. If I manage to save any of these bottles until Christmas, I'll have to try it with some smoked sausage.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,RattleheadKV2,4.5,"2012 bottle pored into Unibroue goblet.  Appearance: Pours a rich, dark amber, with about two fingers of tan head which recedes to about 1/2 a finger that sticks around throughout the session, leaving huge sheets of lacing.  Smell: Sweet, toasty maltiness, with lots of caramel notes and a bit of a piney hop bite. No alcohol is present on the nose.  Taste: Again like the nose, tons and tons of sweet toasty malt, and caramel notes up front. Bit of hop bitterness, and alcohol warmth on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Full thick, and luxurious, just as a Barley Wine should be, just a huge beer with a mouthfeel to prove it.  Overall: Amazing Barley Wine, Sierra really pulls out the stops with this brew.

S - Big piney hops, with a hint of citrus and some fruity notes. Not much in the way of dark fruit.  T - Again, big piney hops. Some caramel malt and toffee through the middle, and has a nice crisp hop finish. The alcohol is present throughout as well, but is not overly strong given the high ABV. Well blended.  M - Full bodied, w/ moderate carbonation. Finish is nice and dry.  O - Overall, a very nice brew from one of my favorite breweries.

140,2671,StoneTSR,3.66,"APPEARANCE: Deep, dark reddish brown. Foamy white head with moderate retention and some nice lacing.  SMELL: A nice dose of brown sugar and some roastiness hits the nose first. Some clove and other spices are present as well.  TASTE: Bitter and citrus hops smack the palate up front, it is a lot more bitter than I expected. The bitterness returns towards the end of each sip and in between a caramel, clove and brown sugar sweetness rises briefly. The heat from the 9.6% is also noticeable, but I imagine this will fade with some age.  MOUTHFEEL: This is a well carbonated beer. While it is big and rich, it also cleanses the palate the same way some big, citrusy IPAs do.  OVERALL: This is a big, bold beer. Hops, malt, then more hops on the finish. At every stage this is an aggressive beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

T - Some light burnt malts, thick caramel, very syrupy/oily texture. Major pine hop flavors from start to finish.  M - Full bodied, medium carbonation. Hops really stick with you after its finish.

A bit of booze in the finish.  The taste starts with a sweet caramel, and then, slap, hops. Very nice grapefruit and floral bitterness. Slight medicinal and boozy finish, goes down smooth for a Barleywine.  Pretty damn good, I've had a few different years and enjoyed them all.

Smell - a combination of malts, hops and caramel sweetness.  Taste - Very, very strong beer with robust and complex taste and quite the bitter finish. The bitterness lingers quite long in the aftertaste. Alcohol is well disguised without any booziness, but you know its there with the robust flavor.  Mouthfeel - Creamy, buttery and perfectly full-bodied.  Overall - This is my 2nd Barleywine. First was a drainpour and untolerable disaster. This one is still rough to get down with the extreme bitterness but it at least doesn't taste like cough syrup and has some flavorful qualities to it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

It's deep and looks great with a decent amount of head.  The aroma is full of caramel, malt, hop and dark fruits. Much the same can be said of the taste. It has a lot of malt, but the hops really brighten this beer up and there is a very dry and bitter aftertaste.  This is a great beer and I'm going to age one of these for a few years.

140,2671,jeranbrews,3.75,"A - 2012 vintage. Consumed in March 2012. A generous fluffy beige head with little dense clumps where the last few drops of yeasty pleasures dripped in. Reddish rose amber hue with small bubbles of continued carbonation. Clarity is quite high despite the yeasty sediment left at the bottom of the bottle.  S - Slight orange and orange peel whiffs peek out from behind the American barleywine hop blanket. This is a nice batch and has a distinct fresh smell. It's a bit like a loaf of bread from a wood stove.  T - Bitter almost to the point of being sour. Hop profile is not subdued at all. All the subtitles and complexities are buried under a bedspread of hoppyness. There are nips and pecks of fruitiness if you know where to look, but you have to know.  M - Hard to define. The bitter hop aftertaste sticks around too long but I think there is some creamy frothy texture to this. ABV is almost unnoticeable except for the slight numbing aftertaste.  D - A very well crafted version of a just so-so style. The time and effort and engineering that went into this beer are of obvious higher than average quality, but the deafening roar of hops that is so common in the Western American Barleywine style makes is seem like a bit of a wasted effort.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,Number45forever,4.25,"My first Bigfoot! 2012 version...having this VERY fresh.  Appearance: A heavenly deep orange, nice visible carbonation. A gentle pour gave me a 2-finger light khaki head that is fading a bit, but sticking around nicely. This is a great looking brew.  Smell: Wow, lots going on here. Almost smells like a spiced Holiday ale. This is a fresh bottle, and you can pick up some great citrus from the hops. But, unlike say an IPA, there's an incredible sweetness there too. Bready notes. I'm picking up more roasted smells than I imaged would be here. I could smell this for a while.  Taste: I can see why this thing ages so well. This is a Rock Band just barely off key right now. There's a FANTASTIC hop burst to this. There's a massive amount of sweet bread and bitter caramel candy (no, that's not a thing, imagine Werthers, but sharp). Almost a touch of a salty air, like smelling the sea on an August day. We have many different AWESOME players here. One day, these guys could play in nice harmony...  Mouthfeel: Lots of carbonation. Hops tingle in the front, surprisingly dry finish with some warming from the ABV. This drinks easy, even this fresh. Loving this.  Overall: This is a great beer. Fresh, I'd drink this all the time. It's huge in every way. I can't wait to see how this evolves over time! I picked up two 6-packs today...I may well have one per year for the next decade or so!

A big hoppy punch of citrus fruit upfront with a sweet caramel malt and alcohol.  The bitter citrus and piney hops hit first. It has a nice malt character to balance it out. There is also an alcoholic bite.  Medium level of carbonation, full body, leaves the lips sticky, and leaves the mouth slightly dry.  Overall this is a damn fine beer.

140,2671,TheWhiskerReview,4.42,"Pours a dark orange-amber with a creamy 2-finger off-tan head, rather sticky, laying like a creamy blanket atop the brew. Reduces to a small ring, with thick and wet lacing.  A big, fruity brew from the start- nose shows bright hoppy tones of orange, passionfruit and red grapefruit alongside estery tones of cherry and apricot. Oddly like a Sauvignon Blanc wine in those respects. Hops even seem to throw in a saline-like minerality. Roast on the malt and the pine give woody impressions, while the booze covers up just about everything else.  Big bodied palate throws a hefty dose of caramelly malt around that joins quickly with the slick hop smoothness, only faintly fruity, picking up some serious chewy bran before the big bitterness and booziness seem to attack in unison- flavors of pine, faint grapefruit. The thick alcohol keeps the body up for a while before finally yielding texture to the long lingering bitterness, very mouthwatering, with that malty bran joined by the estery-alcohol combination akin to moonshine soaked cherries.  A fantastic Barleywine. Typically I'm very quick to dismiss a hoppy Barleywine but the big estery profile on this seems to bring the hops around in a really good way. Easily my favorite American Barleywine so far.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,Lawl3ss,2.97,"Lightly chilled 12 oz. bottle poured into a Troegs stemmed tulip. Bottling date 12.30.11 (2012 vintage.)  Look- Mostly clear deep amber with a reddish tint, three fingers of soapy-looking beige head that settles fairly quickly, leaving a thin film. Lacing is weblike and dense.  Smell- Freshly peeled tangerine and evergreen boughs, reminiscent of fir needles. Second take reveals light bubblegum and mild bready malt, maybe a hint of brown sugar. Swirling brings out a bit of lime and peppermint oil, accompanied by a dose of fusel alcohol. Smells like a sweet DIPA, which could be good or bad.  Taste- Starts and finishes with a sharp grassy hop bite. In between, I get touches of toasted sourdough, citrus zest, and toffee. Plenty of flavor, but nothing particularly surprising or even individually discernible. Finishes like SN Torpedo, but lingers longer and exhibits more amber malt. I'm not really getting the ""barleywine"" this year, unfortunately. Alcohol is well hidden.  Mouthfeel- Medium to full body, moderate carbonation distributed evenly through the sip and swallow. Creamy feeling, distinctly cottony warming finish. Very drinkable for the style.  Overall- I have to say that I'm disappointed with the brewery's offering this year, it feels like a *slightly* fruitier bottle-conditioned Torpedo, rather than the more complex, maltier version I remember, and I've definitely had it a few months out of the gate. Little in the way of developed malt or fruit character, though the high-alpha-crazed hop heads will undoubtedly like it. Rated as a barleywine, American or otherwise, I feel that it falls short, and if I wanted Torpedo I could pick up a twelve pack for what I paid for this sixer. I'll give it a few months in the fridge and give it another go once it has mellowed out a bit.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

S: Mostly pine hop aromas dominate the nose. Alcohol is noticeable as well.  T: Big hop action on the front end, then a light dose of caramel malts and dark fruit flavors balances. Alcohol warms on the way down while the strong hop bitterness finishes off the palate.  M: Average carbonation with a dry finish that sticks out.  O: Glad to finally try this classic barleywine.

The aroma is dominated by very sweet caramel, malts and figs. When sipping there is a multi-layered mouth feel which has a fruity, flowery impact at first, giving way to a very bitter and dry, hop finish. Slightly piny. I suspect that the hops have faded slightly going by other reviewers stating that it seems to have DIPA qualities. Ultimately, it's heavy every step of the way.

140,2671,ThisWangsChung,3.65,"Poured into a snifter.  A: Pours a brilliant dark tawny color with a one finger heavy cream head with impressive retention/lacing for the ABV. The yeast settles in the bottom of the snifter after a while.  S: A strong hoppiness dominates (both piny and grapefruit aromas) that would seemingly indicate it being an DIPA, but there's some nice (if subtle) candied sugar in the smell, too.  T: There's a big hit of opening bitterness from the grapefruit, pine, mango, and apricot flavors, which smooths out some after subsequent sips. I think it could use a bit more lingering sweetness on the finish, but this is surprisingly easy drinking. Still, I wanted more of the caramel and toffee notes to appear to help balance it better. The alcohol is noticeable, culminating in a finishing taste of rum-soaked raisins mixing itself fairly well with the lingering bitterness. I want to try this aged, to see how the malt backbone comes out in comparison to the faded alcohol and hops.  M: Quite creamy at first, which then fades into a somewhat drying hoppy finish. You can definitely feel the booze in this one going down the throat, but it's not 'hot' by any stretch. The body is fairly thick, with lowish carbonation.  O: I didn't know what to expect from this (considering I have literally no experience with barleywines), apart from the fact that it was from Sierra Nevada, meaning this would probably be hoppy. All told, it's a good introduction to barleywines, but it just falls short of true greatness to me. Having said that, it's biggest flaws (its hoppiness and noticeable booze) can be ironed out by aging it for a year. I'll buy it again for the sake of doing just this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,r0gueleader,4.42,"Bigfoot pours a nice amber brown with hints of ruby red when held to light. The head is a thick foamy eggshell with great retention that leaves behind a spider web of lacing as it recedes. Even a mediocre beer looks great in a snifter, but this one fits the glass perfect. A very sexy brew.  At first, I’m getting everything I expected on the nose. An even balance of piny hops and sweet, malty caramel. A little booze hovers in the middle, but is certainly not over powering (we’ve got a respectable 9.6% abv here, folks). As I get about halfway down the glass and the beer warms, things get more interesting. Swirling to release volatiles gives up a pleasing, flowery quality. I describe it as lavender and Dave agrees. The hops have faded at this point and it’s really become a mixture of estery perfume, sweet pear fruit and a bourbon like alcohol.  The taste closely mirrors the bouquet as I’d hoped. A bitter piny bite leads the front. Then sweet caramel and pear fruit, almost like a caramel apple wash over the tongue and thanks to the oily mouth-feel, the flowery esters cling to the back of the palate, leaving a grassy, herbal finish. It actually reminds me a bit of what I expect a good Belgian IPA to taste like.

140,2671,grannaniwa,4.27,"2012 Bigfoot, tasted in Feb 2012. Big, big nose. Hop aromas are a mix between clear/crisp and pungent -- I’ve never smelled those aromas in balance before, and it is great. Also pulling in some malty sweetness. Big head explodes on pour. Beautiful amber color.  Entry is much more pungent than I expected. VERY flavorful. Not that much carbonation in the mouth. Exits with a little sweetness, and a touch of alcohol. Leaves a pretty heavy load of puckery bitterness in the back of the mouth mixed with a sweet aftertaste. Some floral notes toward the back-half of the palate? Keeps threatening to dip into that ‘syrupy’ hops flavor I’m not a fan of, but never really falls off the cliff.

S - Heavy smell of pine hops and citrus, grapefruit mostly.  T - Starts off with a heavy dose of piney, floral hops, with good grapefruit and lemon flavors. Malts are sweet and provide some balance but there is no doubt the hops are the star here. Tail end yields some darker fruits, mostly prune, and finishes slightly bitter with some alcohol warmth.  M - Mildy carbonated, texture is rather creamy as it warms. A heavy beer, but it fits.  O - This is an excellent beer, and is a style I'm glad to have tried.

Produced a relatively light cream colored head with some good lacing left on my glass.  Smell is very complex. At first I pick up a piney hop smell, followed closely by some dark fruits, port wine, and grape scents. Alcohol esters can be detected as well.  Taste follows closely what the smell was. First I tasted some piney hop flavors, followed by some dark fruit/wine tastes. Reminded me a bit of the Gloog my Grandmother makes at Christmas. A bit of alcohol flavors are left behind.  Mouthfeel is typical for a beer of this size. Pretty warm, but very comforting. Nice and thick, but not too harsh.  I really enjoy SN Bigfoot, and have had many different vintages. I set half of my six pack to cellar to see if the heat dies down with a few years on it.

140,2671,chinchill,4.21,"2012 bottle (date on cap & label) served in a pint glass.  A. Dark reddish-amber with 1+ finger of bone-colored head. The head is markedly thick, has great retention and leaves plentiful sticky lacing. There's a very slight haze, but both coarse and fine carbonation bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. No room for improvement here.  S: The first thing to strike me was the clear hop aroma, with a mixed of resin (primary) and citrus (secondary). This is no IPA, however, and there's a solid, sweet malt base, and hints of brandy and dark fruits. High ABV becomes increasingly evident with warming, but still mixes nicely with the other aromatics.  T: Caramel malt sweetness up front is quickly replaced with a big bitter hop hit. Relatively strong, hoppy and bitter finish and aftertaste. ABV is fairly well hidden.  M: Moderate carbonation. Rather full body. Smooth. Inevitable impact of high ABV does have a negative impact on the mouthfeel.  O: This is a big beer in aroma, appearance, and flavor. Would not be out of place in a DIPA tasting session: it may well stick out less in a group of DIPA than with a bunch of other barleywines.

The malt background is impressive, scents of caramel, toffee, and maybe some maple syrup. Some raw boozy smell in there too, clean  T: I get a lot of piney hoppiness hitting first here, not so much of the citrus I got in the nose. Ther are hints of lemon and grapefruit though, just not prevalent. Nice malt background here, quite subdued, but dry biscuits, not so much sweet caramel as expected from the nose.  M: Quite nice, medium to full body, tightly bubbled to give it a velvety feel.  O: Not a big Barleywine fan, but I liked this. To be honest, drank a lot like a huge DIPA to me, I feel there is a wide range in the style and I liked that the malts were subdued here.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Nice, not over-powering, malty yeast up front that is earthy with a hint of molasses as the glass warms a bit. Also some grassiness, esters, and cotton candy. Pretty well balanced.

The smell gives off a decent amount of fruitiness, sweetness, venous, and some hops. There is a lot going on in this beer.  The flavor is equally deep. I really like when the beer tastes as good as it smells... or vice-versa; I hate when a beer smells good but the flavor is bad. This is a very well balanced barleywine.

O: This is an grest beer and also unique for it's style. I'm pretty sure it was always designed to be a marriage between a DIPA and an American barleywine.

140,2671,jegross2,4.17,"Reviewing the Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale from Sierra Nevada Brewing Company. Score: 92  2012 vintage bottle. Bottling code is ""1364212:37."" Served in a Great Lakes snifter and enjoyed on 02/15/12.  Appearance: Pours a dark, translucent mahogany color with a finger of ""dirty"" tan sea foam head that settles into ring around the glass and thin splotchy coating atop 80% of the glass. Excellent lacing at first, but that quality seems to dissipate some as the beer warms. 4/5  Smell: First pull is a sweet and sappy ""piney hops"" aroma mixed with fresh and ""sticky"" citrus. Smooth caramel, creamy malt, and complementary alcohol esters are also present in the nose. The aroma is much more reminisce of a IIPA/DIPA than a barleywine. A very modest amount of ""stout-like"" dark fruit and toasted maltiness comes out in the aroma as the beer warms. 4.5/5  Taste: The first sips leaves me with the distinct impression of malty grapefruit and hops -- though not in the sense a stale IPA. A mellow piney and citrus IPA-like bitter hops flavor is counterbalanced by a creamy caramel maltiness and moderate alcohol flavor/alcohol warming effect. Toasted grains and a little sugary-sweet dark malt on the midpalate. Not detecting any of the ""dark fruit"" I detected in the aroma on the palate. A sweet barley maltiness grows in the finish as the beer layers, overshadowing the citrus. The bitterness never dissipates, however. The level of alcohol flavor present in the back end of the flavor also grows as it warms. At first, this beer tastes a lot like a mellowed out and slightly boozy single IPA -- much more so than the typical barleywine. As the beer warms and layers, however, it becomes more barleywine-like with malty sweetness. Bigfoot reminds me a lot of the recently released New Glarus Thumbprint Barleywine. The finish is bitter, slightly grainy and malty-sweet. Flavors of caramel, barley and bitter citrus linger. 4/5  Mouthfeel: Medium-plus bodied, moderate carbonation. Mouthfeel is sticky, malty and creamy. Finish is bitter and malty, mixed with some alcohol. 4.5/5  Overall: An excellent example of what a non-barrel aged barleywine can be, though I suppose this is more a ""barleywine styled ale"" than a real barleywine. As someone who does not like most barleywines (e.g., the Y2K I recently reviewed), I always enjoy stumbling across the DIPA-like barleywines such as Behemoth. I cannot wait to see how this one ages.  Recommendation: I would highly recommend this beer to hops fans and fans of bitterer beers. Casual beer drinks will probably not enjoy the stark bitterness of this one.

None stand out above the others; they create a nice blend. And it is not overpowering; it allows for scents of caramel, toffee, maple syrup, and cocoa (a touch) to emerge.

Taste: It has a nice, textured bitterness as it rolls across the tongue, and the hops gradually present themselves. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth, and each sip is tinged with booze at the end.

A pleasant amber gold color, not as dark as some barleywines i've seen.  S: Smells mostly of hops with a hint of alcohol and not much malt. IPA fans will love the fresh hop scent coming off this beer.  T: Tastes of hops bitterness and very slight malt sweetness. Also a noticeable alcohol presence but nothing overbearing. Surprisingly drinkable as the flavors are not horribly overbearing and the alcohol is just enough to know it's there. Hops are still at the forefront here but it all blends well. Neutral on the yeast flavor.  M: Thinbodied for a barlywine, contributing to its drinkability. I would say overall this is a medium bodied beer with a pleasant mouthfeel. I could probably enjoy this on a moderately temperatured night, not necessarily a winter beer.  O: This is classic Sierra Nevada in a barleywine...or is it a double ipa? It doesn't matter.

S - Amber malt, caramel malt, slight hop aroma with some spicy notes.  T - Massive malt profile. Just massive. Immediately after the malts are introduced, I am slammed with a huge hop bouquet that wasn't indicated by the nose. Not as hoppy as some barleywines, but day-um.

140,2671,harrymel,4,"Grades reflect latest review: Vintage 2012, bottled 05JAN12 Pours brown amber with a finger of peanut foam that dies out slowly to a quilt of the same. Smells dank, weed, pine, alcohol and more dankness - hard to get through how hoppy this really is, never ceases to amaze me. Bitter with a good citrus tone and malty undercasing that comes through much better than I recall. There are some toffee feelings in the beer. Medium bodied with hi carb and a semi dry on dry finish. This is a classic beer from a classic brewery. Not the best, but maybe the best widely available in the style. 4/4/4/4/4  Vintage 2011- 4AUG11 A: Pours red and amber with hints of brown. Two fingers of peanut head falls in a couple minutes leaving a thick sheet of the same. Excellent clarity. Thick and cobwebby lacing.4 S: Caramel, alcohol, pine, resin, lemon rind, and hints of spice. This is in between hoppy and malty, maybe....balanced? Dunno if I care for this 'balance', it's a tease. Okay, I like it.4 T: Still quite bitter with significant alcoholic flavors remaining. Plenty of PNW hops and some nice caramel malts underneath. Finish continues the assault of hops on the palate.4 M: Medium bodied with moderate carb. Dry finish.4.5 O: Good beer, having fun tasting this one over and over.4  Vintage 2011 - reviewed 4MAR11 A: Pours an amber red, single finger head halves to a quilt of fine, light tan head. Spotty lacing and excellent clarity. S: Pine, resin and grapefruit. Wow, so many hops in this. As Burc of Oskar Blues would say: a shit-ton. I remember having this fresh last year and don't remember the smell as much as the taste. We'll see how it goes. T: Bitter, hoppy. A hint of corn on this, which surprises me quite a bit. The beer has a nicely subdued (at least I think this is their intention as many of their beers are this way) malt character. The hops are the primary character in this beer. M: Heavy beer with moderate carbonation leaves the palate more dry than I had expected. Actually a very unobtrusive mouthfeel - potentially sessionable as a small offering with a meal. D: Moderate drinkability. I have hear stories about how awesome this beer becomes over time. I have begun a vertical as such to discover the truth.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Reason2B,3.34,"A: Dark amber is color, about an inch of white head and with outstanding lacing that just stays through your entire drinking experience.  S: Dark fruity malts, with a strong smell of hops.  T: Strong bitterness, not a balanced flavor at all, as it desperately need some sweet characteristics.  M: Silky a good medium body. Perhaps the best compound of the review.  O: A little disappointed, as I just don’t feel SN lives up to the hype. Complexity is lacking, with that a sweetness characteristic is nowhere to be found.

140,2671,cratez,4.62,"12oz bottle purchased at Ryan's Party Store in Port Huron, MI. 2011 Vintage.  Pours a hazy deep amber hue with one finger of frothy, cream-coloured head and several strands of lacing on the tulip glass. Great appearance.  Smell is plum, caramelized apple, toast, piney, floral and citrusy hops, toffee, ethanol, grassy earthiness, molasses, perfume, cherry, and melon. Huge aromas here.  Taste follows the nose with rich layers of caramel, raisin, molasses, toast, candy apple, toffee, melon, and a big blast of juicy, citric, and boldly bitter hops. Scrumptious.  Mouthfeel is thick, viscous, full-bodied, juicy middle, massive prickly and astringent hop bitterness precedes a bone dry finish that lingers for quite a while.  Overall, this succulent American barleywine is one of my all-time favourite beers. Bigfoot's gargantuan hop profile beautifully compliments its chewy and complex malt backbone. The alcohol provides a pleasant warming kick that never overwhelms the palate. A delicious and near-perfect extreme ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Jugs_McGhee,3.21,"01/23/12  12 fl oz brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into a Disney thistle glass. Reviewed live in me gaff in low altitude Los Angeles, California.  A: Pours a three finger head of nice cream and thickness, and great retention - especially for the high ABV. Colour is a caramel auburn. Nontransparent.  Sm: Quite malty, with some yeast and cream. The toasted malts are nice. Some moderately strong hop notes are present as well. A mild to moderate strength aroma.  T: Actually quite hoppy. I'm surprised. Some toasted malt aids the foundation. It's simple and strange for the style - to its detriment. Boring and bland, but not without redeeming characteristics. Candied sugar fills out the body without adding much flavour. It's too sugary overall, actually.  Mf: Smooth and wet, but too thick and heavy on the palate.  Dr: Decently drinkable. Okay for the style, but in major need of work. The hoppy approach just feels wrong. I wouldn't have it again. Another disappointment from Sierra Nevada.  I initially asserted this wouldn't age well in contrast to most other barleywines due to its reliance on the hoppy flavours, but GoodBeerFan2006 wrote in to let me know it does indeed age quite well. I hadn't considered that potential hop death/hop flavour demulsification would actually round out the balance better. It's a valid point; thanks GoodBeerFan2006! Consider cellaring it if you desire the best experience possible with this beer.  C+  --- 12/10/12  I decided to revisit an aged version of this after questioning my initial (fresh review). 1995 vintage Bigfoot served into a New Belgium stem-goblet. Expectations are above average. Cost was ~$8.00 at a vintage bottle shop. Cap reads ""Bigfoot Expedition 1995"". Label is quaint and reminds me of craft beer history; so this is what Sierra Nevada looked like when Pearl Jam was popular.  Poured with substantial vigor because undercarbonation is anticipated.  A: Pours a weak tan floater. No head at all. Body colour is a dark brown. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show.  Sm: Heavy caramel, fermented dark fruit including plum and fig, oxidation notes, malty sweetness, and dominant raisin. Not as musty as expected, but it certainly isn't fresh. No hops are detectable in the aroma. An assertive, moderate strength aroma. Not a particularly appealing one either.  T: Raisin, caramel, dates, plum, and malty sweetness on the finish. Oxidation notes ruin the balance and distract. No hops whatsoever. Rich and surprisingly full-bodied. Lacks complexity or subtlety. Not a great flavour; it's definitely past its prime by a long shot. Still, it's not vinegary - quite an achievement at 17 years old.  Mf: Smooth, wet, and weak. Sugary. Cloying, even a bit astringent. Lacks good present. Age has taken its toll.  Dr: Hard to drink on account of its poor quality. Boy, I'm not going to enjoy finishing this glass. The ABV is decently hidden, but this beer has long passed prime. Maybe this would be better about 7 years younger.  D+  I might have overshot the whole aging bigfoot thing; fresh it seems was too young and 17 years was too old. I'll revisit at different vintages in-between as my budget allows. My current score reflects the fresh review.  ---  02/20/13  Final revisit. 2008 vintage (25th expedition/anniversary). It's five years old; this should be peak. Review below will be truncated. 9.6%. Heard a crack upon opening; still carbonated.  A: Pours a half finger khaki head of nice cream/thickness and above average (~2 minute) retention for the high ABV. Body colour is a murky nontransparent opaque dark caramel. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show.  Sm: Fruity and evocative. Rich appealing biscuity malts. No hops. The malts are quite refined; age has done this well. Port-like richness and sweetness. Caramel. Toffee. Bread. Candi sugar. Quite nice, actually. Maybe I've finally found what Bigfoot is cracked up to be. A pretty strong aroma. Right on the money for a barleywine.  T: Okay. Caramelized malts with a light port-like sweetness. Refined biscuit malts. No hoppy character or yeast. Definite fruitiness; perhaps over-fermented (think depleted) fig. Plum on the finish. Licorice. Raisin. It's sweeter than anticipated, with lots of malty sugars. Balanced but simple. This is definitely better than fresh or 17 year old Bigfoot, but it's still not great. Solid for a barleywine, if a bit underwhelming.  Mf: Good coarseness. Wet. Good carbonation. Suits the flavour well.  Dr: I do like this. 3-5 years definitely seems to be the sweet spot for Bigfoot, but I'll give up the ghost after this review. I kept wanting it to be as good as I'd heard it was, but it just isn't. Bigfoot just isn't a great barleywine, but you can't say I didn't try. I'd try it again at three years, but I've lost hope that this will satisfy the hype. My current review reflects the score I gave it fresh.

Pours a beautiful clear reddish amber a/ a rich eggshell head that leaves a fine film on the side of the glass, nice iridescent bubbles smile up from the surface.  Aroma is sticky sweet - fruity malt, caramel, brown sugar, rum-soaked figs, toffee, and floral hops.  Taste is strong and boozy, fruity, with a dry finish. You expect it to be cloying and tongue-coating, then it slips away clean and dry. Tastes almost like a dessert liqueur, but balanced by bitter hops.

140,2671,FirstBrewsoon,3.83,"Poured vigorously from a bottle into a tulip.  A - Pour yields &gt;1 finger of pale dense foam, with tenacious retention and eventually giving way to extensive thick lacing on the glass. Beautiful lustrous amber colour with some cloudines.  S - What aroma there is seems very faint - I really had to stick my nose in the glass and inhale like a cokehead. Hops on the nose, with some caramel in the deep background. I took some time to make sure the nose wasn't being affected by temperature, but I never really could get much of a scent out of this one.  T - Lots of hops for a barleywine, but with an underlying warmth and richness, perhaps a caramel toffee sweetness. Big lingering bitterness on the finish, but the hint of sweetness persists as well.  M - Crisp and bubbly without being overly carbonated. Just thick enough to allow the taste to hang around for a good while.  O - A great buy, and will undoubtedly stand up well to age. I'm eager to see what this beer would be like after a couple of years to let the hops fade somewhat. A very enjoyable, drinkable barleywine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

This is 2007 VINGAGE. I have had it before but first time I am reviewing. Appearance-Dark cherry, very little head, what I would expect a Barleywine style to look like. Smell-dark fruit, figs, cherries, dark chocolate, some west coast hops coming through very faintly. Taste- wonderful, can taste dark fruit, cherry, fig, grapefruit(hops) and malt. Mouthfeel-good. Overall-This is a 2007 I am drinking in 2012 and I have only ever had this beer new before and it is good new, but it is fantastic with a little age on it. I bought out the reamining six pack of 2007 so I am cellaring the rest to see how it progresses with time. It will be tough though given how DAMN delicious it is.

140,2671,Rayek,4.45,"Poured from a 2010 vintage bottle into my favorite snifter, Bigfoot pours with a hazy cherry-wood hue. A huge nougat cap is rocky and firm. It slowly falls to a lumpy blanket of foam. Nice lace is left behind.  Pine, toffee, leather, a hint of citrus and a light alcohol tingle greet the nose. In the mouth, the heavy body is both dry and oily, with a fair amount of carbonation for a two year old beer. Bittersweet toffee and cured leather strike the tongue first. Bitterness is very strong. It has a pine, pepper and citrus bite the puckers the mouth. Alcohol adds a light warmth, but its flavor is mostly masked. Letting the beer warm brings out the flavor even more.  Bigfoot is a great Barleywine. It's very much a benchmark for the American Barleywine style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,EK33,4.78,"2011 Vintage  A-Poured into a mug which produced a one finger head that dissipated to a half finger throughout drinking. Perfect carbonation. Head clung to outside of glass throughout drinking. This is barley-wine appearance perfection.  S-Upfront caramel notes with some vanilla as well. Dark Cherry follows and finally this beer smells of fantastic hops. Alcohol is hidden/absent.  T-Fantastically balanced. Caramel/Vanilla sweetness upfront that lessens to darker fruits (dark cherry/concord grape). It ends with a good hoppiness reminiscent of an IPA cut off at just the right amount.  M-Perfect as the head hanging around would confirm. It has the right amount of carbonation and thickness setting the bar for barleywines.  O-Just short of perfect only on the nose. This is very subjective, however, preference in Barley Wine is fruit then caramel with slight alcohol notes. A difference in that this ends with a flowery hops infusion to the nose possibly covering/replacing the alcohol scent.

Yields a decent head of creamy, light beige foam that hangs around for a few minutes before subsiding to a frothy surface layer. Intense aroma of piny hops followed by sweet malt and yeast. Notes of resin and citrus. A warming background whiff of alcohol. The blend of hops and malt borders perfection.  Tastes of intense bitter pine underpinned by a sweet malt backbone. Powerful aromatic hops - notes of pine resin and citrus. Hints of yeast in the distant background. A boozy note upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is intensely tingly and astringent, but also thick and smooth. Great body - neither too thick nor too thin. Aftertaste of pine and malt - I'll be tasting this at breakfast!

T- Sweet caramel malt which is quickly followed by a strong pungent bitter piney hop bite that lingers for a little. Nice balance with the hops, as a lot of the barleywines are much heavier on the malt bill than the hop. The alcohol is well masked by the big malt presence.  M- Thick but not a syrup bomb.

Pours a deep, murky garnet color with an enormous, fluffy off white head that has slight orange tinges throughout it. The head on this beer is outstanding. It's a least 3 fingers high and reaches to the top of the glass. Amazing retention for such a big beer. It recedes unevenly, leaving lumps of foam that take longer than others. It eventually dissipates to a thin ring. Exceptional lacing. It coats nearly the entire glass from top to bottom.  Huge malty aroma. Nice caramel and toffee sweetness. Still a touch of piny hop character as well. It presents itself as a slightly resiny aroma. Some dark fruit comes through as the beer warms, cherries come to mind. The sweetness also kicks up a notch when warm. There are hints of alcohol as well.  The taste is considerably different. The same characteristics are there but they present themselves much differently. There is a nice sweet caramel malt character up front. Not as much toffee but there is a honey-like sweetness as well. The sweetness gives way to a biting, resiny pine hop character. The hops still provide a substantial bitterness that sticks to the tongue.  The mouthfeel is pretty thick but the biting hop character keeps it from feeling syrupy. The carbonation is low but, combined with the hop presence, it feels pretty lively.  An amazing beer 2 years out. Not surprising that the hop character still makes it self know but it is fairly surprising how much of punch it still packs. It is still the most prominent aspect of the taste. Overall, the flavors and aromas are very well integrated, much more so than when fresh.

It's so rich, complex, and simply liquid heaven. I could drink this forever, but after a couple of them, the nearly 10% abv (which I could hardly taste) sneaks up on you. This beer tastes better with some time. I can't wait to try it again in a few months, year, and so on.  ---  March 22, 2012 (a full year since the 2011 came out) Poured into a snifter.

140,2671,KickInTheChalice,4.2,"2010 and 2011 12 oz. bottles poured into tulips and tasted side by side with willseph. Review scores are an average of the two bottles; the general and 2011 notes are first with a second paragraph about the 2010 bottle where applicable.  Appearance: The color of both beers is unremarkably the same. A blend of a brown center, amber edge, and orange where some light sneaks through creates a pleasant image overall. An off-white cap has the look of a foamy froth, fading fairly quickly to a thin film.  Smell: Even in the 2011, the hop aroma is not as strong as I was expecting. Based on previous reviews, I was anticipating a nose full of grapefruit citrus and spicy pine bitterness, but that was far from the case. Smooth, toasted bread, caramel, lots of vanilla, a dab of cococa. A light amount of spicy pine and grapefruit take a few whiffs to really pick up. There is a strong alcohol note in the fresher batch, foreboding the 9.6% beast to come.  Predictably, the 2010 has even less of a hop aroma at this point, to the extent that the citrus and pine that are present fresh are just a faint whisper of what they used to be. The ethyl alcohol presence is simply absent as well.  Taste: The flavor starts with a strong malt presence. Slightly syrupy and gooey caramel prelude toasted bread and grains, a bit of spice, and a fair amount of vanilla. Some juicy grapefruit, complete with the rind and some zest, come along with a few spicy pine notes as well.  In the flavor as well, the 2010 simply blends together the flavors so much better than the 2011. There  Mouthfeel: As the flavor starts sweet, the body is full and slightly syrupy. Right toward the end, the feel turns a bit dry, yet there is some juicy salivation from the citric hop notes. The body also seems to thin out a little bit. The carbonation is a little bit bubblier than I would prefer. It feels like a creamier carbonation would improve this a bit. The body is actually on the light side for what I would expect. The thought of ""watery"" flashed into my mind for a second or two, which I don't think it is, but it definitely isn't the chewy beast I expected.  The 2011 still has some rough edges, but it is a bit smoother than from what I remember when I had it fresh months ago. The 2010 starts a predictable course to becoming very smooth and drinkable.  Overall: The 2010 is clearly superior to the 2011. A smoother, maltier flavor provides for a more enjoyable experience overall. It is well-documented how much this beer improves with age, and I am satisfied that I am working on a vertical each year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,MONKandTUCK,4.38,"A - It fills my La Trappe glass as beautiful beer as any I've seen poured. A deep amber... red, really. The foamy cap hoovers over top.  A - This is why beer is made. Lots of pine and some citrus, it's equally sweet and biting. It's hard to say more, the beer speaks for itself. Everyone familiar with quality American ales knows this goodness, and know how difficult verbalization of it is to make.  T - There's lots of caramel sweet and plenty of biting hops. First sips are very sweet, but the finish has teeth that bite back. The boozeyness is a bit much. I feel it detracts from the malt flavors and burns in the finish. It would be exceptional if not for the heat. Very fruity.  M - Filling and slightly sticky. It's a fat beer that warms. Fortunately that Chico ale finishes dry.  O - I'm sure a dozen beers top a beer geek's list over this one, but this is pretty much a masterpiece. The juicey and pines flavors mesh well with the English malts; the alcoholic heat is a set back, however. With age a great balance between hops, malt and fortitude can be achieved I am sure. Of course this requires some lucky, since the luscious hop aroma will eventually fade.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,FoundersFanatic,3.03,"A- amber colored with sediment  S- not much smell, but hoppy  T- decent, but nothing special. Is definitely on the hoppy side for a Barley wine. Not much depth, don't taste much of anything. Kind of bitter and dry.

140,2671,Tucquan,4.33,"Had this on 2011-12-12 in Columbia, PA. 2011 release so this is about 10 months old. On 2018-02-17 I had a 12oz 2012 bottle that I've been cellaring. See Notes below. On 2021-02-07 I had a fresh 2021 bottle. Nice batch!  A - Mahogany with a 3-finger, tan head into a nonic glass with excellent lacing. Head lasts surprisingly long for a beer with this ABV.  S - Caramel, pine, perfumy hop floral, plum.  T - Caramel and LOTS of pine, light citrus flesh, sherry, raisin, grapefruit zest, alcohol. Finish is moderately sweet caramel, pine, leafy mint, a touch of raisin and a fine, lingering amount of malty bitterness.  M - Medium-heavy body and light-medium carbonation. Thick, creamy, prickly and resinous. Flavors cling a long time. Nice.  O - This is a very fine brew. More on the caramel side than their Hoptimum. Like most Sierra Nevada hoppy ales, this is a flavor profile that strikes my fancy.  Notes: The 2012 bottle I had on 2018-02-17 was still very good. Plenty of carbonation left given the 2-finger head on the pour. The aroma had some oxidation but is still pleasant. The flavor is quite different than when fresh with a lot more malt and dark fruit presence. Be assured, there is still plenty of piney bitterness but it is somewhat rounded out by the malt. All-in-all, I still prefer an English Barleywine with fewer IBUs, but it was fun to taste this after 5+ years in the bottle. I did lower my taste rating from 4.5 to 4.25 because of how my taste preferences have changed over the years to desiring less apparent bitterness.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Fatehunter,3.88,"2011 Bottling. New review eight months later with a bottle from the same sixer that was sitting in my cellar temp'd wine/beer closet.  Poured into a tulip glass. Cloudy amber color with a finger of dirty-white head.  It has a deep malt smell that you could get lost in. Big improvement from the first review. There is also a black licorice smell.  Heady malt taste, almost knocked me over. Still has the gripping bitterness, which balances the malt well. Big and powerful all the way through. It also has a great alcohol warming finish.  Heavy body, low carbonation. Nothing changed here.  It got a lot better only eight months later. I still have a few more that I'll open one a year. ---  2011 Bottling  Poured into a snifter. Amber colored with a thick, tight dirty-white head. Looks regal.  The smell is, well, almost non-existent. A bit of wet malt and brown sugar.  Sweet, but not too much. A bit of maltiness. A gripping bitterness, a lasting aftertaste.  Heavy in the mouth, but not really thick. Light carbonation. True to the style.  Maybe it needs to cellar for awhile...

MF: Thick, sugary, full mouthfeel. Good dryness and pleasant bitterness.  O: A good, enjoyable barley wine.

140,2671,Pintofbrown,4.27,"I poured this one into a shaker pint.  Appearance- One-finger of caramel colored head. The cap is smooth with pretty big bubbles, very smooth. Retention is all right, but it has degraded to a slight ring.  The body is a cloudy auburn-copper with golden highlights.  Smell- There is a good amount of citrus and some piney hops here. Also a fruity, estery quality to the nose that is most like candied cherries. The smell is nothing short of great.  Taste- Hops give a kick right off the bat, more grassy on the palate with a little bit of resin. Some herbal flavors come out mid-drink. Fruity notes hit most on cherry and even some sweet raspberry.  Age would most likely diminish the hop kick and allow the esters to showcase themselves.  Mouth feel- Carbonation and the hop bitterness really diminish what could be a smooth drink, rather dry as it stands. Although it is a little harsh, it is a solid medium body with decent coating.  Overall- A very good barleywine that hides the alcohol very well. It would be even better with some age on it to battle the hop bitterness, but such is the way with barleywines. Anyone that likes barleywines should really give this one a go.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Had an aroma of sweet malts, dark fruits, earthy hops, citrus and alcohol. Tasted of dark fruits, earthy hops, pine, caramel and alcohol. Amazingly complex and well-balanced.  Medium to full-bodied. Smooth, especially considering the ABV and style. Dry finish that is certainly bitter, but not too harsh. I normally detest barleywines but this one is an exception.

140,2671,eslemarc,3.83,"2011 release  The beers looks very appetizing with such a tall, thick, cloud-like head of a cream color. The beer itself is completely transparent with a soft light brown color with hues of rose that almost brightens it up. There is some visible carbonation; very slow and very minimal. As the head begins to fall it laces very intricately all around the glass; falling further on the edge and staying a bit taller in the middle of the head.  Not having had the 2011 yet this year I can't help but compare it to 2009 and 2010 that I have had recently. There is a very strong presence of maple and fruit with a very well balanced hop back to it. There's just a hint of booze coming through the powerful mixture of dark fruit and hop.  This beer is very heavy and thick. There is more bitterness than I was expecting having had previous year releases before. On the sip I feel like the softness of the beer is going to give way to a fruity array of flavors but I think it just needs some age. It's just a little too bitter for me, but I still appreciate the beer. It's earthy. It's warming, it's a little filling, it's big.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,aorloski,4.58,"1999 Bottle, Enjoyed November 16th, 2011. Almost 13 years old. Cracked it on my birthday. Here we go.  Appearance - holy SHIT, this is like 5 shades darker than a 2010 bottle i cracked not to long ago, incredibly deep dark brown and amber bordering on black. So luscious and amazing looking, not what i was expecting. Obviously no head to speak of but a few bubbles linger at the top. Poured incredibly creamy. World Class.  Smell - In between mellow and dominant is where the aroma lies. It is not in your face but a very subtlety soft spoken nose, but so amazing. Rich deep caramels and toffee flavors, a touch of wood and oak, sugar sweetness. I can't wait to taste it.  Taste - Oh WOW, what a god damn treat. Like drinking liquid werthers candy. Sweet, buttery, caramel and toffee dominate everything and it is so luxurious. The alcohol literally is not there, surprisingly i get a mild bitterness at the end. So incredible. Just short of a 5 for me, i can't wait to see what a 10 year bottle is like rather than a 13 year old one. But yeah, just absolutely amazing.  Mouthfeel - One of the creamiest beers i have ever had. Silky smooth across the tongue, coats the mouth with those amazing flavors i just described. Basically no carbonation but swigged around in your mouth creates a feeling of like whipped cream. I dont think i ever gave a beer a 5 in mouthfeel, well, this is the one.  Overall - Nothing short of spectacular. So glad i have 4 more of these bottles and even more vintages. This is the oldest one i have had and figured i would review this one rather than fresh. An absolute treat, if you have a 12-13 year old vintage CRACK IT, its doing great.

140,2671,fmccormi,4.29,"Straight pour from a 12oz pry-off bottle to a 25cl Duvel Single tulip; bottling date of November 30, 2012 printed in yellow ink on the shoulder of the bottle in a Julian variant (“2335207:26”), making this beer just over ten weeks old.  Appearance (4.5): This pours two and a half fingers of very fine-looking, cappuccino foam-colored head. Light tan and just beautiful. The body is a slightly hazy, ruby-amber color that, again, is just beautiful. This leaves tons of lacing and boasts far above average retention, taking a very long time to die down while leaving thin collars and webby patches of lace wherever it’s been. For the style, this beer is killer.  Smell (4.25): Rich caramel and toffee mix with dark fruits (raisins and plums) with warming, spicy alcohol keepin’ it lively. Spicy and fruity hops aromas brighten it up a bit, with red grapefruit flesh and a mix of rye-type spiciness and resin adding another dimension.  Taste (4.25): All of the same malt depth picked up in the nose shows on the palate: rich, caramel-soaked cereal graininess comes off like a rich coffee cake-type flavor, mixed with toffee, prunes, brandied plums, raisins, and plenty of booziness. Damn—rich and hot, which I certainly appreciate for this style (and other things in life). There’s a solid citrus zest and vegetal bitterness on the back end (Centennial?) that helps dry out the finish, though even the ABV and hops bitterness can’t overshadow the complex malt depth here. Very balanced.  Mouthfeel (4.5): Wonderful feel: subdued carbonation at first gives way to an extremely fine-grained prickle that reaches every surface, leaving a sheen of hop oiliness all over the place; the hop oils and ABV help to make this a dry-finishing beer, ultimately, but the full-feeling weight of the body and the chewiness of the malt stand up to it all.  Overall (4.25): Yep, big fan of Bigfoot. Very solid beer, and a really classic representation of the style; it may not be as big or as hoppy or as rich or as hot as a lot of other examples, but it makes up for all of these things with balance and, to be frank, a degree of finesse. (Not that there’s anything understated about this at all.) Cheers to Sierra Nevada, for making this beer and continuing to fire on all cylinders, even after all these years (even if this IS one of their most classic products).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Taste is up front sweet, bready malt with honey notes, some slight fruit character that fades into a hop bitter finish and ends on a sweet note. The hop character is present but somewhat subdued in this now that it has a bit of age on it. Some slight citrus notes from the hops but this one is all about the bready/biscuit character.  Medium bodied with low carbonation work well enough. It is sweet but not cloying, and there is noticeable alcohol.  This beer is a nice hop forward barleywine.

Very interesting and given my inexperience with barleywines I don't konw what to expect  T- Tons of different flavors just hard to pinpoint one in particular other than the alcohol. It's not a grossly strong alcohol flavor but it is present. Definitely more dark fruits on the back burner  M- Honestly I noticed the mouthfeel before I noticed the taste. So silky smooth in spite of the high ABV. This is the mouthfeel I yearn for in every brew  O- Very glad I got to sample this one and will most likely re-review it once I have more barleywine experience. That being said I am enjoying my first one",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,phiberoptik,3.8,"2011 Bottle, opened just to do a fresh tasting before the others age.  Pours a deep, rich amber color with a foamy tan head that dissipates quickly.  Rich malts across the spectrum, raisins and dates, lots of subtle hop notes, brown bread, and a warm tingle from the alcohol.  Whew, I definitely feel like my breath is hot after the first sip. I fully expected it though as this is not ready for mass consumption. Brown bread and caramel malts up front, raisins, dates, and other dark fruit in the middle, with a strong bitterness through the middle and finish.  Medium to full bodied, lots of resinous characteristics, and smooth carbonation.  Overall this needs to mellow out a bit, but no surprise there. I was surprised at the bitterness. It just lingers on the back of my throat. Get it, age it, enjoy it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,JohnnyChicago,4.17,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter.  A: Pours a deep garnet with a sticky, full, off-white cap of head.  S: Nice resiny hops jump out of the glass with pine and citrus notes. Sweet caramel and dark fruits back the hops.  T: Nice velvety sweetness pours over the tongue and the heavy hopping leaves a lasting, fruity, not dry bittering.  D: Surprisingly smooth and drinkable for its ABV. Its heavy and a sipper, but is remarkably easy to down.  Overall: What more to say? Its one of the classic American Barleywines. Its pedigree, value, and accessibility are untouchable and it only gets better with age. What's not to love?",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,dsprainman,4.53,"A- Into the Tulip goes this 2010 bottle. Two finger khaki head extends above a rather dark brown/plum body. S- Malty sweetness is almost cloying with some citrus hops floating in the background. Dark fruits come to mind. T- A very deep, sweet flavor of dark fruits is in the forefront only it is well balanced by piny hops on the aftertaste. M- Heavy. This beer is very syrupy with medium carbonation. O- This is a really deep beer with many intricate qualities, but it's definitely a sipper.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Malty, biscuity resiny and hoppy aroma and flavor. Sweetness and bitterness accompanied by a very welcomed boozy warmth, but overall very balanced. Reminds me of Gemini/Unearthly.

140,2671,DangerDawg,3.89,"1999 Vintage  Thanks to Scott2269 for bringing this over. Drinking it side by side with the 2011.  A - Pours a deep cloudy brown with no head. Very little carbonation.  S - Smells like raisons and figs. The hop presence thats in the 2011 is totally gone.  T - Tastes exactly like it smells. Very sweet with raisons and figs. Not much like the 2011.  M - Without the carbonation it's not much. A little thicker than water.  Overall this is very good. Bigfoot has always been a favorite barleywine of mine, so having one aged 12 years is great.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,DividedAvery,3.61,"I was expecting a lot out of this beer. Mostly because of all the hype it gets as a cellar beer I guess. Anyways here Isherwood goes:  A: pours a real nice amber color with about a one finger brown sugar cream head.  S: had a cold tonight so its hard to say but a lot of caramel and raisin/fruit is coming through to me  T: nice pine hop flavor with a little bit of raisin in the the finish. The hop lingers nicely in the mouth.  M: nicely carbonated, I bet with a few more months on this it becomes a little smoother and more delicious  Not a bad beer by any means, really enjoyed this. Like I said I expected a little more but overall I really enjoyed this and am looking forward to having some aged bottles in the future.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,lanamj,4.09,"2006 vintage shared with friends.  A- Pours a nice caramel brown. Has minimal head and appears somewhat thin. What little head there was dissolves into nothing. This is a very translucent beer.  S- Wow. This has aged very nicely. Fresh Bigfoot has a nice hop aroma, where this vintage bottle's hop aroma has faded and all that is left is beautiful malt aromas. Lots of caramel and molasses. I get some sweet booze towards the end.  T- Nice caramel malts and sweet booze. This is how a barelywine should taste. Not as complex as it is when its fresh but still so nice. Very little booze on this one. The hops find them selves at the very end in the form of a bitter finish.  M- Goes down lovely. Just a little thin but not to thin. The age on this one has calmed the carbonation a little but still present.  O- Glad i got to try an aged version of this, thanks Brawley!! It seems to lose complexity with age but gains character. I feel it starts off as a barleywine ""style"" ale and becomes a barleywine over time. I love the sweetness to this ale reminds me of so many other great barleywines.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,cneville,4.03,"Poured into a snifter.  Color is a nice, deep amber that appears lighter at the bottom. Head is a light tan and leaves a nice lacing. You can definitely smell the barley here, and there's also an underlying sweetness. When you taste it, the hops are definitely there at first, but fade into a maltiness that really brings the beer together. Mouth feel is a little underwhelming, although the carbonation level is good. This is the first barleywine I've had/reviewed, but it's a style I'll definitely return to, especially with the cold months coming up.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,damndirtyape,4.03,"12 oz 2011 bottle (bottled 10/07/10 if I'm reading the stamp right) poured into a snifter.  Appearance: Hazy dark copper orange-red with a very thin off-white foam on top. Ring at the edge, tiny thin skin in the middle, but big sheets of persistent lacing all over the glass. Good looking beer.  Smell: Very hoppy. Pine, grapefruit, citrus, and tiny hint of mango, all smashed together and tempered with a bit of malt and just a hint of alcohol as well. More of the malt comes through as the beer warms up.  Taste: Bitter up front, quick malt in the middle, and long lingering pine, grapefruit, and earl gray tea (bergamot in here too) hop finish. Hops mellow out just a tad as beer warms up and a little bit of the malt shows through in the middle, but even then, the hops dominate. This beer is a showcase for the hops and little else.  Mouthfeel: Quick carbonation on the tongue, and then it's gone and replaced with a thick and creamy mouthfeel followed by all that hop oil sticking to the teeth.  Overall / Drinkability: Quite a monster this one. Good but smacks you around the head and shoulders with the hops. A slow sipper for good reason. I wonder what it would be like aged another year since if I've read the date stamp right, it's been about a year in the bottle and it's still massively hoppy. Might try it again sometime or pick up a bottle now and cellar it a year to see if the hop profile changes and the malt comes out more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Rhynes2,3.83,Bigfoot is a great name for such a big beer. Pours a nice amberish color with a decent head. A little bit of lacing down the sides as well. The taste definitely has some hop bite to it but nothing overpowering. The malt side of things seems to have a bit a honey with a small dash of caramel. For the price I think it is an outstanding value but as a barley wine i would much prefer a different choice.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ElizabethCraig,3.55,"Split with my husband from a bottle on 9/28/11. I really like barleywines but I'm not sure what to make of this one.  The color is a light to medium amber with a pale tan head, the scent is caramel with.. citrus? I think yes, citrus. I'm not sure how I feel about the combination.  The caramel flavor varies from dry to sweet, a slight carbonation is present a few seconds into tasting it, it moves to a pleasant alcohol warmth.  My husband and I talked about this one for awhile. For some reason I picked it up as very dry and bitter - and he hit the nail on the head when he described it as ""APA-ish"".  I'm not sure how I feel about this, as I prefer my barleywines generally not this.. .dry? But it's been awhile since I had one, so my memory of others that I've enjoyed could be off. This is a pleasant tasting beer, but not necessarily what I was expecting. I'm not used to this combination of intensely caramel but with a bitter/dry edge to it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

S: Sweet, bready malt, some mellow citrus hops.  T: Sweet caramel mixed with mellow yet rich, spicy hops. A little molasses also. Tiny, lingering sweetness on the finish. After a while, a little more hoppy bitterness manifests itself on the finish.  M: Not too heavy, very creamy and light oil coats the tongue.

Upon opening bottle I'm hit with earthy, citrusy hops. Sweet malts. Smells like a barleywine. Taste is caramel, sweet malts, some citrus and earthy hops. Well-rounded and tight. Some bitterness at the end of the taste. Alcohol pleasantly warms the back of the mouth. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied, I am slightly distracted by a cloy aftertaste. Overall this is a solid barleywine.

140,2671,pBRale,4.48,"From tasting notes 9-17-11 2011 Vintage Poured into a snifter  Appearance: This beer rivals any in appearance. A surprisingly clear pour, deep amber in color, with a super creamy light tan head. The head settles very slowly and has massive retention. The lacing left behind is thick and dense.  Smell: An absolutely wonderful array of smells. From the nose, it smells similar to an IPA although there is a much more pronounced malt presence in the nose. The hops certainly dominate the nose but are not overwhelming. There are citrus, floral, piney hops smells and an incredible earthy hop undertone. The malt backbone can easily be detected and is really working up the anticipation of the taste of this beer.  Taste: The taste did not disappoint. Very bitter up front with the hop tastes blending beautifully in pretty much the same manner as the aroma, except that the earthy presence is a bit more pronounced in the taste, which lends itself beautifully to the overall quality of the taste. The initial bitterness is followed by a huge blast of malty goodness that is exceptional and really balances out the beer well. The maltiness in the finish is what sets this up as a great barleywine!  Mouthfeel: The feel is smooth and coating. Medium carbonation in a medium but full-body and a great creaminess in this beer. Excellent.  Overall: Very creamy and delicious--full bodied and smooth. The malty finish is crisp and the alcohol is barely perceptible. This is an exceptional beer that everyone should try. A true delight to all of the senses in a way that most beers cannot do.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,amanofbeer,4.75,"It's your typical barleywine appearance, but with an intense head...the haze is minimal, and in fact it is inteesting to look at what sediment is at the bottom of the bottle, because there is most certainly a present sediment, yet an incredibly clear beer.  The Aroma is pungently hoppy, but a beer of this degree cannot be reduced to a mere aroma of hops. The malt backbone is everpresent with an almost burnt caramel. The hop aroma is earthy and intense. The result of whatever hopping has occured is one of a (balanced) burnt pine and citrus.  The flavor is a total party. Wild. Super dark, but at the same time sharp. The hops are not that of an IPA at all, but those of intense early addition.  Quite a unique beer. Tasty. Big. watch out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

M: overcarbonated with large bubbles, medium to thick body. There is smoothness at the beginning and end.  O: not super impressed with this barley wine.

The brew itself is a beautiful amaretto red color with violet highlights. A good amount of carbonation is evident on the sides.  S- Plenty of caramel malts are present upfront and intertwined with the other scents in this beer. Sweet sugar cane, dark fruits such as plums and raisins, and a fair amount of hops in this brew. Fresh I'd imagine this would smell as a pine forest where the sasquatch roams...(I'm buzzed)  T- Sweet plum, raisin and date flavors begin the barleywine. There is a nice caramel malt backbone to this thing. Aftertaste is somewhat that of cheese, interestingly enough. And there is strong bitterness to the end indicating the hops are still in here.  M- Mouthfeel is medium in body, and almost syrupy. The hops and malt bill balance quite nicely in this brew. Carbonation is evident, I'd say about a 6 out of 10.  O- This is a highly enjoyable barlewyine.

Poured from the 2011 Labeled bottle into my 16oz Dewey's Pizza Pint Glass and has D 348 118 03 on the side (Damn you S.N.! Put a bottled on date here!).  Aroma- A great amount of spice and alcohol hits the nose at first and then has a great sweetness and caramel note at the finish. Also can detect citrus hops behind it.  Appearance- Pours 2 fingers of off-white head and has great retention. Has a copper body that is quite a bit hazy and has tons of yeast on the bottom of the glass. Leaves thick lace on the sides of the glass.  Flavor- Very sweet and malty from the first couple drinks and then a huge citrus hop taste comes in. Has a caramel taste that is very favorable. A very aggressive hop bitterness is present on the backside and is funny that an English and American Barleywine are that much different!  Mouthfeel- Medium Bodied, Medium-High Carbonation, has a nice amount of alcohol in the finish, but not much chewiness or body like it should.  Overall Impression- A very nicely hopped barleywine! Not sure I've ever had an American Barleywine now that I think about it and this was fantastic. I'm glad I kept this one aging for a few months before enjoying it as well.

Nose is dark fruit, piny hops, and alcohol esters. Taste is immensely piny and hoppy up front with a thick, malt character in the finish. Great, but not overwhelming, warmth from the alcohol. As the beer warms, I get hints of dark fruit; figs and dates. Mouthfeel is full bodied, rich, and smooth.  This was an incredible beer even fresh. A little on the hoppy side, but that was expected.

A generous, three-finger, foamy, khaki head develops and remains for a long time. Sticky, off-white lacing is left as it settles. Smells of hops (strongly, being spicy, bitter, and vaguely citrusy), faint caramel, and dark fruits. A bit of citrus in the rear makes it resemble a DIPA in scent. The similarity continues into the taste, where the hops lead the way before the malt, date, raisin, and brown sugar make themselves known. Lacking in too much else though, as the hops are really quite pronounced. Mouthfeel is heavy, with the carbonation and alpha acids cutting only slightly through the rich body.

S: An aroma with plenty of dark dried fruits, like dates or raisins, notes of citrus peels, orange, red wine, fudge, syrup, spices, rye bread and hints of roasted malt.  T: Rich, fruity, spicy, bitter, boozy and even burnt flavours, with notes of dark dried fruits, citrus peels, oranges, red wine, toffee, vanilla, syrup and brown bread. A lot. To me this is almost too much to handle.  M: Smooth when enjoyed slowly. The body and bitterness is both plus-sized.  O: I think this is the first Barley Wine I've had, and it's (of course) pretty strong stuff, but once I got past that first stroke of alcohol I felt: 'This is a warming and really enjoyable beer'.

A - Poured a translucent medium to dark amber colour with two fingers of thick, foamy cream coloured head with good retention.  S - Hop bitterness is the initial unexpected nose with some citrus and pine notes coming through. Caramel and brown sugar flavours are evident as well and become more noticeable after a few minutes. A seemingly balanced barleywine (unlike most that I have had to date).  T - First taste is bitterness, followed by sweet caramel malts. The bitterness returns in the a dry finish. The sweet malt profile becomes more noticeable after a few sips and quickly dominates the palate with notes of caramel, toffee, brown sugar and raisins.

The smaller head is expected given the high alcohol. Lacing is good.  First aromas are the strong, citrusy hops. But the aromas are complex and also have rich, malty notes and those of dark fruits such as raisin.  The taste, like the aroma, is initially very hop forward and bitter. But there is also caramel malt flavors and a sweetness. The balance is there, although I'd say the hops are the more dominant aspect. I also get a nice alcohol warmth.  Feel is thick and full-bodied, with medium to high carbonation. The finish is primarily bitter from the strong hop presence.  Overall, this is a very interesting and complex beer.

140,2671,DavidST,5,"Initial review: 8-9-11  Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter, 2011 vintage.  I had this when it first came out and I only remember the extreme hops (something I actually enjoyed a bunch).  This pours a dark reddish color with a nice tan foamy head. With the smell I get quite a bit of alcohol and lots of caramel malts, I don't get the slap in the face of hops like I remember. Medium to heavy body, a creamy texture. Still some nice hops with the taste, there is some definite malty sweetness and I get a little alcohol heat, but not terrible, I definitely don't get any sort of overpowering alcohol, I actually think its well hidden. Overall a nice thick and creamy beer with lots of hops and malts, I liked it a little more fresh with the hop explosion, but good now. A very tasty brew. I'll try to continue to review again when I open the next one in a few months.  --- Review 8-9-11 2010 vintage.  I'm not sure how smart it is to drink two of these in one night, but here's the 2010 I had lying around.  The appearance is about the same, still has a nice head. The alcohol smell is mostly gone and I get a load with caramel / toffee / sweet malts. Feel is still medium to thick. The taste has mellowed out a bunch on the hops, I get a bunch of toffee/caramel and some hop bitterness, with the less hops, I get a hair more alcohol taste than with the 2011. It a little sweeter and more of a malt bomb also (Is this closer to a proper barley wine?). Honestly, I prefer the ultra bitter DIPA taste of it fresh, but this is still pretty good. 4/5. A fresh Bigfoot might is probably my favorite SN product.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Brunite,2.68,"A: A nice looking beer with a decent head. Color is a deep blood orange.  S: Hops! This smells like an IPA.  T: Bitter. The hops dominate with a followup from the alcohol. Strong...not pleasant. Also sweetness.  M: Medium body.  O: I guess I just am not a fan of the style. I drink beer for flavor and balance. This is just too much alcohol for my taste. I love other high ABV's, like DIPA's and RIS's where there is balance and the ABV hidden. This makes no bones about what it packs....too much for my tastes in a beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,billab914,4.2,"2009 vintage poured from a 12oz bottle into my Dogfish snifter. It poured a caramel brown color with a thin but bubbly, khaki colored head. The head clung to the edges of the glass and left some very nice lacing as I drank it.  The aroma shows a lot of both hoppy and malty flavors to it. The caramel and toffee is what first catches my attention, but it also has a pretty bold juicy and citrusy hop profile to it with some grapefruit and orange notes. It feels pretty balanced between hoppy and malty overall though.  The taste has more of the malty sweet flavors coming out up front. I get some caramel at first with toffee starting to come out a little later. Midway some of the hops start to add a juicy, bitterness that lasts into the finish. I get some grapefruit and citrus rind flavors coming out in the finish and mixing nicely with the sweet malts.  The mouthfeel is about average for the style but on the heavier side overall. Carbonation is moderate. Overall it's a great beer, Very well made and relatively balanced for the style. A classic American version of the style and pretty much a benchmark for the style for me. This one was very nice with a few years on it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,rwinzing,4.45,Just popped my first 2011 bigfoot.  Poured this into my Duvel Tulip. Gorgus dark amber color and a small white head. Full lacing on the glass  Sweet and full. Very nice touch of rasion in the aroma  Full and not over powering. Still a little hot but more balanced then expexcted. Had other bigfoot years fresh wich were a hot mess but this nice and fairly balanced  Full body a little bitter on the back but the malt is nice  Love this beer love barleywines,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,kylehay2004,4.27,"A: 2 finger head, nice and thick with a decent lacing. Copper/amber color.  S: Fruit, very piney and hoppy. Expected a sour, wine odor and was caught off guard. Liked it.  T: Very strong on the front end, especially the first sip. Malts, caramel, tons of hops, bitter fruit,  M: Thick, oily, full bodied and moderate carbonation.  Overall: Drinkability is the downside. I see many people say this is drinkable and for a heavy beer and they may be right but this is still a tough one at the beginning.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Thickfreakness,4.03,"A bottle of 2011 that was tucked away with five of it's friends at a local beer distributor. Poured into my DFH signature glass.  A- Two fingers of bubbly pinkish/tan foam float on top of this murky amber/cherry concoction! Tons of sticky, honey lacing drips and hang all over the glass. This is magnificent to look at!  S- Licorice, piney hops by the ton, orange zest and lemon peel. Really nice maltiness that lends just a touch of sweetness. Really sticky butterscotch and caramel with some nuttiness and dried fruit.  T- Black licorice candy is the first thing that hits the taste buds. Nice bright orange zest, pine cone and a touch of honey. The malty caramel sweetness comes in next lovingly coating your tongue before ripping back in with the brutal hops and licorice. Some nice roasted nuts, dried figs and cherries all blanketed by a lovely alcohol burn. The licorice is really over the top. That and the alcohol are most certainly the most dominent flavors.  M- Ya really need to like licorice to have more than one of these... and luckily for me, I do!!! The alcohol really bits nicely, licorice candy, caramel and honey sweetness... and those loving piney/citrusy hops that blend so nicely with the sweet malts.  O- A very complex barleywine... lots of things to taste, smell and discover. Certainly not the best barleywine on the market, but very solid. I can't to put a few of these away and see how they do over the next few yrs to decade.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Eramen,4.42,"A - Appearance is a ruby-orange, thin head with low retention. |Tends to collect at the edges of the glass.  S - Highly sweet in odor; I get citrus, orange peel, deep pine, wine for the most part.  T - Taste is exquisite! I'm getting caramel, hints of pine, red wine, spices, an intense yet very palatable bitterness.  MF - Very low carbination, smooth, low-medium body, great drinking.  O - This is a fantastic beer, beautifully crafted, intense, bitter, definitely not to be missed!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,cptnspeed1,4.17,"2010 Vintage poured at about 45 degrees. Served in a tulip/snifter hybrid.  A: The amber color of hardened tree sap (think Jurassic Park when they extract the blood from the mosquito). A fairly aggressive pour leaves about an inch of faintly tan and thick head.  S: Hops are still there. The sticky, resiny kind. Just like the pine forests that Bigfoot roams. Caramel and brown sugar with a hint of booze hide behind the hops.  T: I get the resiny hops with a punch of bitter in the front with a dank hops and medium bodied malt finish. Theres some butterscotch/caramel in the middle. A hint of licorice lingers from the middle to the finish.  M: Not as smooth as I would like my barleywines (even the hoppy ones) but that is a trademark of Bigfoot. A couple years in the cellar would probably cure it, but then again, there are plenty that come smooth from the bottle on day 1.  O: Big points for value. Its something I love about a lot of Wisconsin beers. The same quality beer some place sells for $20 a bomber is available for $2-$3 a bottle. It makes you wonder a little. I was able to get this 6 pack in a grocery store for $7.99. Now that is something I can get behind. Well done SN.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,cosmo4u,4.18,"lazy boy saloon 7/23/11 2009 vintage  Appearance: Somewhat hazy deep red body with red laser beam highlights. Two fingers of caramel-tinged head that leaves great lacing.  Aroma: Lots of hops, lots of malt, and lots of booze - just what I expected. Relatively balanced in its massiveness, but the hops take the spotlight. It's a complex mix: perfumey Cascade hops, dark fruit, spices, caramel malt, and alcohol.  Taste: Again, intense and complex. Masses of grapefruity and piney Cascade hops riding on top of a very solid caramel malt base with everything simply dripping with alcohol. Still plenty of dark fruit and spices flavors here. The aftertaste is brilliantly bitter and boozy.  Mouthfeel: So chewy you could chip a tooth with good carbonation. A great dry, boozy finish that segues into a long-lasting hoppy aftertaste.  Drinkability: Very filling and obviously a sipper. One is certainly enough, but a second is always looming!!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,JNewbs,3.8,"A - Deep amber/mahogany. Thick head that sticks around for seemingly ever. Solid lacing.  S - The smell was my first hint that I might not be in for what I expected. Having never had a barleywine, I was thinking we'd be looking at malty, strong flavors. The smell was hops though, plain and simple.  T - Reading the other reviews, it might be because I had this one fresh. But I found the taste to be very raw and abrasive. Hops and bitterness up front, with not much malt to settle it down.  All told it wasn't what I was expecting. In 10 months we'll see how the one in my basement tastes.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,CapitalGains,3.83,"Poured and tasted 7/20/11; 2011 vintage. 12 oz. bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada snifter  Pours an amber, crimson body with moderate transparency with a 2 inch creamy faint tan head. Leaves some aggregated lacing and settles to a nice halo and island effect. Aroma is very forward caramel malt, diacetyl, grassy hops (Willamette maybe), blackberry (?), residual hints of ethanol which become more apparent as it warms. Powerful initial hit of butterscotch, caramel, and earthy hops on the bite with a bready, biscuity, and alcoholic finish. Bitterness is present but quite subdued. Mouthfeel is dense, thick, and a bit chewy especially if it sits on your tongue for awhile. Appropriate level of carbonation. This single bottle cost $2.09 - hard to beat that price for a solid barleywine. Would definitely like to try this again after some time to see how the profile changes once the hops fade out. Sierra Nevada has done an impressive job producing an enjoyable barleywine in this beer at a very economical cost. The alcohol could be a bit better hidden in a fresh(er) batch but this will likely mellow with some age.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,auroracrisis,4.33,"Bottle into a pint glass. This is a 2011  Pours a deep chestnut color. Big pillowy head, that stays strong around the top of the brew. Thick lacing as the beverage is drank down.  You are first kicked in the face with big, resiny hops. The smell is similar to pine cones or fresh cut wood from a pine tree. A cedar like aroma rounds out that resin smell, with grass in there too. Behind that, a biscuity malt character comes forward. Toffee and caramel not too far behind that, with some heat as well.  Upon your first sip, you are greeted with strong bittering hops. Flavors similar to pine tree sap and fresh cut grass. After your tongue is done clenching, the savory toasted, biscuit-like malt eases you into a sweeter side of the beer. Toffee, caramel and a pinch of brown sugar come out after the bombardment of hops.  Sticky, thick and low carbonation. A tingle of alcohol burn rounds out and dries out the palate a bit too.  A brew that truly represents a good portion of flavors in the spectrum of taste. Bitter, sweet and a tad bit of earthiness as well. Infinitely complex, ages well, and cheap to boot. This is something I line my cellar walls with while preaching about the value and quality of. Truly, a world class American barleywine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,StJamesGate,4.23,"Clear burnt amber body with stiff creamy ecru head that leaves soapy cathedral sheets. Intoxicating caramel-dipped orange nose. Werther's Original, brown sugar and papaya attempt to make an appearance but are snuffed by orange, resin, cinnamon oil and pine hops. Cherry cough drop comeback and stinging linger. Medium to full, creamy, chewy, slight burn.  The blueprint of American barleywine. Enough said.  2011, fresh enough. Hot and hoppy.  2020 version, April 30, 2020: Intense pine sap + orange oil nose; caramel, ringing citrus, thread of cherries, flowers + evergreen; surprisingly light, salty, clean, bitter end with no burn.  Crazy oily, almost minty, nose. SN character all the way through. I forgot how zesty + bright this is when it's fresh. This, not NEIPAs, are the kind of big hops that everyone fell in love with in the first place.  Bumping taste to 4.25, and that's an injustice.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ChrisCage,4.54,"Thanks to BigBry for the trade...this is the 2009 version of the brew....  A- Pours a deep muddy brown color with hues of deep red infused within. The head is eggshell in color, thick and dense, and finally settles down to a whipped cream textured layer over the liquid. Carbonation appears to be mild, as I was hoping for and the lacing is purely excellent, with a dense patchwork of soapy foam sticking intently on my glass.  S- Ahhh, sweet caramel malts dominate, with a lush candied apple backgournd following closely behind...I just cant get over how wonderfully big and bold the malt profile is on this one! The middle is deep with molasses, and dark fruit (plum, raisin) balancing it out, while the finish has a subtly fresh hop cone presence.  T- Wow, the hops hit my palate right up front, which I didn't really expect, and provide a stimulating hit of bitterness right away. This subsides a bit with the malt sweetness kicking in, although it is short lived, and the raisin/dark fruitiness comes forth and takes over. The whole experience up to this point has a toasted quality and is very rich indeed. The finish is dry and bittering, much like the beginning, although by this time the palate has had much to digest and it helps complete the beer....a well balanced beer indeed.  M- Chewy and full bodied for sure, this beer exemplifies the barleywine style! The carbonation is reasonably smooth and although the alcohol is noticeable to a point, it doesn't hinder the overall feel in my mouth. This is a very enjoyable beer that requires careful thought and dare I say borders on a desert brew?  O- Didn't know what to expect originally but this has been quite a nice experience! Full flavors, an aroma profile for the ages, great mouthfeel, nice appearance....this one has it all. I would definitely get this one again to savour, and/or to even cellar for a couple years to let it mellow out and ""blend"". Not for the faint of heart, this beer really knows how to knock your socks off! The only thing holding this back a bit is it's drinkability factor....I could handle one bottle and that's it in any given sitting!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,JTSbeerislife,4.7,"12 oz. bottle, vintage 2010, well stored in a temperature controlled environment. Poured into a Dogfish Head Snifter with nucleation etching.  Pours a tremendous two finger head, which settles down rapidly to a lingering ¼” cap. Beautiful, very deep amber color. Has a great “presence” in the glass. Thick lacing hangs on the side of the glass marking every sip. Just beautiful!  Distinct and powerful nose of piney hops when first poured. The hops settle down a little with some time and warming, and allows the rich malt to come out to be enjoyed along with a wonderful ale yeast. That being said the hops dominate this ale from the first sip to the last. Thank you God!  The taste is just a monster rush of piney hops and rich distinct roasted malt, with crisp acidity giving balance. Very full bodied. Long lingering malt in the middle, but it can never shake off the incredible hop component of this ale. The hop oil sticks to the roof of your mouth like glue. Nice carbonation rises from the nucleation etching but it’s not over done, giving this ale a very pleasant mouthfeel.  Long, long lingering finish of piney bitter hops, rich malt, and a touch of yeast. It just goes on forever, like the Energizer Bunny. I may never brush my teeth again.  This ale is just flat out delicious. A great American Style Barleywine. The 9.6% ABV is completely buried by the intensity of the aroma and flavor. If this was not readily available every fall/winter the “Beer Snobs” would be killing themselves to get this, and writing A+ reviews like crazy. I often read in the forums of people asking for a great beer that is easier to find then the ones on the top 10 list, well look no further folks, here it is. I buy a case or two every year and at less than $60 this is a bargain. This is one of my favorite Barleywine Style Ales along with a recent find from Troegs, Flying Mouflan.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

It has muted, but was still a very nice beer despite the temperature and it likely up in abv by now over 10%. Orange coloured body, a lace sheet. Taste as if dry hopped.

140,2671,TheHoppiest,4.18,"Had a 2004 vintage on tap at Lakewood's Beer Engine. Poured into a small snifter, and surprisingly was served a little too cold.  Appearance is a remarkable clear amber color with only slight haziness. A 1/2"" head reduces to a soapy lid, with excellent retention around the glass as it is drunk down.  Smells of vanilla, molasses, mild alcohol and esthers. Not much yeastiness, which I know has been a feature of later releases of this beer.  Tastes quite hoppy, which again is slightly surprising (and pleasantly so) given it's age. Alcohol, bitters, mild malt, slight honey, and a hint of sweet fruit (grapes, apricots) all are present. To be honest, this is very much on par with a decent Imperial IPA.  Medium bodied, this has a lighter, sweeter start before assaulting the back of your tongue with it's bitterness. Slightly thinner than later releases, yet still enjoyable.  This brew was, and still is, a beast, with high alcohol content and a bitter taste. Yet, that is why I love it so!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ExplosivoSR,3.83,"Bottle to snifter. 2011 vintage.  A – Deep ruby red in color, with 1 finger’s worth of head. Lacing sticks here and there.  S – Holy goodness, did not expect this! A big piney hop profile comes through, with the sweet malts that you’d expect kinda buried in the background. A bit toasty.  T - In your face with hops. They really overpower pretty much everything else here, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing since I’ve always thought barleywines are almost always too sweet. Some slight sweetness is present, but only slightly and it never really escapes the grasp of the hops. Alcohol is very well hidden.  M – Nice and crisp because of the hops. Pretty full body as well.  O – I was pretty excited to try this since I’m going to be putting a few bottles away to age. More my style of barleywine: Nice and hoppy, but still having some sweetness to it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Such a nice bitter and then sweet. A tad sour in the middle. Dark red fruits, super malty, oak, earth, some citrus, cherries and sweet yeast  M - big, full bodied, chewy, medium to high acidity, very long finish and well balanced  D - if you love boozy, sweet and hoppy and almost 10%, this beer drinks like water. Well balanced and very drinkable  Final thought - expensive, high alcohol, once a year release and being from sierra nevada. You have to have this one and maybe age it!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Klym,3.75,"A translucent red beer that goes into brown shades in its deeper parts. Head is small, off white, and leaves plentiful lacing. Hops and the oh-so familiar raisin, fig, date-ish smells in the nose. The taste is much of what the nose is though more well blended-- while in many beers the dark fruits and hops are simply concurrent, in this beer they are fused together into one taste that is interesting and make both more delicious. Despite the fusion, hops definitely take the forefront with the dark fruits taking the undertone. Mouthfeel has some alcohol burn on the top of the throat, but the bitter sensations in the mouth are pleasant. Solid barleywine overall, but mostly just a more well-crafted version of generic flavors and sensations.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Sideswipe,4,"2011 batch. 12oz bottle  Bigfoot pours a deep red coppery color. A two finger head of off-white foam floats on top for a moment, then recedes leaving a delicate lattice of lacing on the sides of the glass. The nose is hops and sweet malt, emphasis on the hops. Taste starts out with citrusy hop flavors. Exquisite bitterness is momentarily balanced by a very nice malt backbone, then careens back into hoppy goodness. Finish is dry with an excellent lingering bitterness. Feel is thick and viscous with a lower level of carbonation that serves to enhance the bitter character of this big barleywine. Alcohol is masterfully disguised by the interplay of hops and malt rendering an extremely drinkable beer. Overall this a wonderful take on the style by Sierra Nevada, a supremely bitter, satisfyingly malty brew that is a joy to savor. A yearly favorite!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

S- Pine hops and malt. The smell is nice, but doesn't do the flavor justification.  T- Huge beer. This is one of the most flavor-packed beers I have ever drank. Lots of malt that is smacked down by a huge hop bitterness. There are few beers that rival the bitterness of fresh Bigfoot in my book. Pine hops and a sweet berry-like malt flavor round out the taste. The bitterness lingers.  M- smooth and refreshing. alcohol is faint, hop bite is dry and sticks to the back of the tongue.  O- just a great beer all around. it has become a staple in the fridge (during release times) and can be drank during hot or cold weather, which makes it particularly appealing in the state of Missouri...where you never know what weather will hit you.

I love hops, but this is a bit overwhelming. I really enjoy the initial flavors I get, but then the hops just leave this bitter taste in your mouth and it lingers.  M- Actually very light with good carbonation. Surprised.  O- Not a fan of this barley wine. Maybe if it was aged for a year or so, the hops would mellow out, but Bigfoot fresh is not for me.

Faint smell of soapiness. Taste mirrored the aroma. The first time I take a sip of this brew it always kicks me in the mouth, the flavor profile comes right away. Citrus is at the front, with the piney and woody flavors coming near the end. Flavor retention is dismal, yet still very complex. Although flavor is bright, the body is thick and malty.

I would probably lie some of the blame on the bartender who poured the beer. The beer had a big pine hops aroma, with some hints of some citrus and some malt. The taste is rich and heavy on the pine hops, but also with some nice hints of the malts as well. The beer had a heavy feel to it, dense and almost chewy with a heavy bitter aftertaste. Overall, the beer lacks some drinkability due to the high ABV, but that is not to say that the beer is not drinkable. If I was able, I would have had a couple.

M- coats the mouth well has a good balance of sweetness and huge bitter hop bite.  o- love this beer has become a northern Ca classic and one that i look forward to every spring.

140,2671,therica,4.35,"2011 Vintage.  A= clean copper with a very hefty foaming active beige head about 3 fingers, had to let it settle to finish pouring into a pint glass. Day #2- more settled from 36 hours refrigeration I suppose, less foamy head but still great lacing.  S= centuries of Americans have used this at holidays to pine-scent entire buildings... just kidding. Huge pine pine pine! But with some citrus too so it's not just nostril-burning pine. After about a minute or less as the head starts to settle, very nice rich malts join in. Magical. Day #2- more quickly balanced from settling in the fridge, less pine and a more complex and beautiful bouquet of a nose.  T= definitely pine, with citrus hops and also a slightly thick creamy feeling with very rich sweet caramel roasted malts. Adequate carbonation. Day #2- almost chewy on the malts this time, and even more complex in flavor. The barleywine traits are much more apparent.  M= despite the hops overload the mouth feel mellows out into a very rich malts and hops bitters combination. Day #2- ditto.  O= at 9.6%ABV it's a sit and sip beer but very drinkable at that. Maybe good with roasted red meats or smoked turkey. Day #2- Going okay with Wasabi peanuts, sorta.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Rifugium,3.8,"First had: cask conditioned at Ebenezer's Pub, Lovell, ME  This was a 2002 batch, cellared for 9 years, and served on tap at Ebenezer's. It definitely picked up some interesting flavors in the cellaring process that made it distinct from the fresh batch I had the day before.  Poured a dark maroon-amber with more haze than its younger brother, to the point where it was pretty much opaque. Still sweet with rich malts, with rich coffee tones appearing, pine resin, dark fruits, a very woody quality, and a definite alcohol burn. Heavy mouthfeel, but not quite full-bodied. Strong, but drinkable...though perhaps one serving is enough.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Very rich inviting smell.  T- Followed nose closely but is more complex; Big malt flavor that has a burnt caramel to it, backed up by a huge hop presence.  M- Medium-heavy; Thick and heavy but light and smooth enough for you to want to keep drinking it.  O- Awesome beer; Really drinkable bigger beer.

140,2671,rfgetz,3.83,"2011 vintage...  Pours a clear orange amber color, quick poof of off-white head, gone wuickly leaving splotchy bubbles and some sticky spots on the side of the galss. Scent is dominated by piney hops, moderate amounts of citrus (orange) and herbal hops, some astringent qualities before the malt even arrives. Malt scent is very sweet and syrupy. Taste is as the scent would have predicted... hop forward, warm burn of alcohol and a big syrupy like sweetness. Full bodied, heavy on the palate, lingering astringency and warmth. While a very nice beer - this pupy definitely needs some age - overly hoppy and boozy, will hunt out a vintage bottle or age the next recent one i see for comparison.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,cavedave,4.3,"2010 Vintage  Pours a clear dark amber with red hghlights, topped by an immense and thick dark beige head. Plenty of clingy lace slathers the glass.  Smell has plenty of piney and citrus hop, with some caramel/toffee/breadiness, floral, herbaly tart, and wee hints of alcohol spice rounding it into a dynamite aroma.  It is a high strength taste, starting with sweet caramel/toffee and light alcohol and bread, quickly grabbing some piney and herbal bitter. Citrus kicks in, some bitter orange peel and tangerine to go with the bitter pith. This carries the sip into an ending of sweet spicy alcohol and piney citrus bitter. More pithy-bitter than most barleywines I have tasted. Nice.  Quite light in mouth for such a full flavor, viscous but less than seems possible, perhaps a bit less than optimal, and low carb. despite its look. Fine finish worthy of an IPA, and on par with the hoppiest modern American BW's.  This is a fine BW, highly recommended, and a definite candidate for the cellar, though with a year on it it is in my wheelhouse right now.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Today I had a 2011 bottle, it was bitter and harsh. A: Dark brown with minimal head S: Toffee, caramel, hops T: Hop bitterness and some burnt sugars in the background M: Minimal carbonation, moderately think feel O: As a young barleywine the hops are over powering and put this out of balance, but knowing Bigfoot, it will mellow and come around to a great beer with time.

140,2671,seand,4,"Side by side 2011 and 2007 release. Review scores are for the fresh stuff, but I will note differences in each area.  A: Pours a dark translucent reddish amber, with a fair amount of foamy eggshell white head. Retains well, and leaves a fair amount of lacing. Quite a lot of head for a barleywine. The 2007 is darker and closer to opaque, more an inky brown than red. It's also got much less head, and just clumps stick around on the surface and around the edge of the glass.  S: Malty, almost candy-like sweetness, so concentrated it's almost pungent. Hops are present, but somewhat buried. 2007 is tamer in its sweetness, but deeper and more complex. The aged version is much nicer.  T: Similar concentrated sweetness, but not quite so overpowering, as the hops offer more to balance things out. Nothing subtle about the flavors here. The 2007 is again much more layered; less of a huge sweet kick in the tongue, and less hoppy, though there's still a fair sized bitter note towards the finish.  M: Full body, medium prickly carbonation. The 2007 is still full body but a bit smoother overall.  Overall the young version is good, but the aged version is very good. Both are very big beers, but time softens many of the less subtle notes into something more layered and cohesive.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,BeerMaverick,4.5,"2011 poured into a snifter.  A - Dark red/mahogany-colored with a half inch of beige head. Retention that lasts throughout the session and a good amount of lacing.  S - Raisins and grapes dominate the fruity aspect of this beer. Bitter hops are prevalent as well and it possesses a strong malt backbone. Some alcohol is present here.  T - This beer is on the sweeter side and the raisins really come through here. The hop bitterness is present in the aftertaste, but it lets the alcohol filter through. Some spicy notes as well such as cinnamon and brown sugar.  M - Definitely a full-bodied brew that does not hide the alcohol well. The hoppy character lingers on the aftertaste as is with most SN beers.  O - Definitely a dessert beer. Overall a fantastic beer and representation of the style...my favorite barleywine at the time of purchase and to age as well.

S - Very strong and bitter up front. Caramel is present. Very alcoholic smell. Citrusy and piney.  T - Very strong taste. Extremely bitter, but in a good way. This barleywine really makes your taste buds stand on end. Also very hoppy, with sweet malty goodness towards the end. Very boozy, but relaxing and warming.  M - Smooth and carbonated, almost perfect carbonation for this style. Sticky and chewy, yummy. I can only take very small sips of this beer, it's the way that it's meant to be.  O - Overall I love it. So sweet and malty. After a few of these I feel really good. Such a nice beer.

140,2671,iDrinknewglarus,4.3,"Note: I am reviewing the 2011 bottle, it is at least 3-4 months old kept in the fridge.  A: Reddish-brown. Nice creamy looking head that dies down to form a thin cap over the beer. For a beer of this ABV, it even laces pretty well. Not hazy at all.  S: Huge notes of pine and grapefruit. I even get some sweet, caramel almost sugary malty notes. Maybe just the faintest note of cranberry. It smells quite dry from the alcohol.  T: The initial taste confirms the copious amounts of hops used. There is a slightly sweet malt flavor in the background throughout, but it is really dominated by the hop flavor and bitterness. It leaves my mouth and lips sticky. The aftertaste lingers forever with a bitter, charred wood/burnt coffee kind of taste. Alcohol is well masked.  M: Not a whole lot of carbonation; but still has a medium-heavy mouthfeel.  This is my third bottle out of the six pack, and I must say I really like the way this beer is done. I'm a hop head so I really dig the hop forward taste of this barleywine. Oh yeah, and it can't be beat for the price.

Towards the finish a big piney bitterness comes through.  M: Medium-bodied. Medium to high carbonation. Very creamy. Slightly dry finish. A light alcohol warming.

140,2671,IronLover,4.13,"2011 bottle that poured with a respectable, dense beigish-orange head that very slowy reduced to a wispy cap. Thick sheets of sticky lacings coat the glass. Color is a combination deep amber and dark orange with a very heavy, viscous haze....almost like carbonation bubbles frozen in suspension. Heavy but smooth with a light resinous, yet creamy feel. Aromas are not as intense as I expected, but a nice balance of citrus orange and sugary sweet caramel malt with a hint of pine and biscuit. Intense citrus and pine hop flavors in the front. Citrus flavors slowly fade as the pine hop bitterness intensifies through the finish. The hop flavors ride an intensely sweet malty backbone from beginning to end. Long lasting pine bitter hoppiness with alcoholic heat clearly showing at the finish.

Tastes just like it smells, sweet followed by malt. Very refreshing. A sipper because of the sweetness. Moderately creamy mouthfeel. Nicely balanced hops. Medium carbonation.

140,2671,doverhills,4.12,"2011 vintage 12 oz bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada Imperial Pint Glass at slightly less than room temperature. Initial opening attempt with toe-nail clippers leaves my thumb slightly bloody and I make an excuse to head upstairs for the bottle opener.  A- Pours an appealing mahogany that is fairly consistent and pleasant to gaze upon. Head fades quickly but the lacing that remains is lasting and satisfying. A faint layer of bubbles provides carbonated promise.  S- Several huffs provide my admittedly untrained nose with the scent of citrusy sweetness, largely pine and caramel. Very enjoyable. Definitely makes one want to move on to the tasting portion of the sample.  T- Very similar to the nose and only slightly less satisfying. Begins with a crisp (muted by alcohol) hoppiness that quickly becomes malty sweetness. The ending sensation is one of hop bitterness with a bit of alcohol heat.  M- It's medium to thick-bodied, while still going down easy. Carbonation is close to perfect. The alcohol is still present, I think time will be beneficial.  O- For the content and the style, very drinkable. This years is still slightly hot, and I'm looking forward to aging a few bottles, but there's a reason I had to buy another six-pack tonight, very drinkable fresh.

140,2671,blackcompg,4.03,"Serving this one pretty cold, nice colorful label, gently inverted the bottle and loosened the sediment in the bottom of the bottle, incorporated it into the rest of the beer, turned the bottle straight up, and slowly pryed off the cap, poured into my 12oz beer glass and...  Appearance - Pours a finger of fluffy, beige cumulus clouds..wow, great hills and valleys in the head now, receding slightly after the first minute - lots of tiny bubbles, and a few big ones. Color is a gorgeous deep copper, slight haziness and constant tiny bubbles rising within the ale, looks really good. *3/4 finger of cumulus clouds after 5 minutes...great retention! Sips leave huge, thick lacing! **I wish I could show you a pic of this, my glass is nearly empty, and it almost looks like I've coated the inside of my glass with beige shaving cream - I've never seen thick, robust lacing like this before, Awesome! Raising my appearance to a 4.5 as a result...  Smell - Dark fruits, prunes, molasses, slight touch of alcohol and rye bread. Slight floral hops, no grapefruit or pine smell at all. Smells nice - website says 90 IBU's, surprised how sweet this smells, smells very good though.  Taste - In a word, Delicious. The taste really follows the nose - The dark fruits and molasses are all there front and mid-sip, then a touch of licorice, then slowly take a back seat to the hops. Ahhh, there it is...the hops are way long in this ale, and really assert themselves after the sip. Now I'm really getting the grapefruit peel, the pine, minerals and some sticky lip-smacking resin, and a little alcohol warmth. Then some dryness and hops pucker, time for the next sip. At 9.6 ABV, the booze is really masked nicely. Alcohol presence increases slightly as the ale warms.  Mouthfeel - Nice mouthfeel, some creaminess, some good carbonation tingle, then a nice, bitter dry finish. Little pieces of dried, bitter grapfruit peel in the corners of my mouth - and some alcohol warmth.  Overall - This is my 2nd bottle of this beer, had my first the night before. I really wasn't crazy about the first bottle, but I've changed my mind. This really is a well done american barleywine, and is a tasty, full-flavored beer. I would easily recommend this beer. *I added the last 1/4 of the bottle to my glass near the end of this review, got 2 more fingers of head, and now that the beer is gone, I still have over a finger of head in the bottom of my glass - loving that.

Light peach colored head, about 1 finger, that leaves quickly leaving a nice lace.  S: Picking up some nice ripened fruits, slight alcohol and a nice oaky undertone that cuts through some of the burn.  T: The taste comes through pretty bitter with a roasty wood note. Sweet fruit esters are present which compliment the very slight burn at the end.  M: Medium bodied with a smooth and creamy feel. Leaves a nice sweet taste on the palate.  O: I like the mouth on this but feel like the tastes weren't pronounced as in some other barleywines. Good, but not spectacular. Hopefully with some age it will enhance some of the things I was missing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

It finishes sweet with some alcohol mixed in.  MF: A little more than medium bodied, without any over the top carbonation. Alcohol is noted throughout.  O: Pretty much the standard of a good barleywine. Not my favorite personally, but pretty above average overall.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

A nice mild note of toasty malts to balance out the nose. Alcohol very much present  T - Abundance of piney resin flavored hops at the start with a strong toffee malt presence. Flavor develops to much more bitter and citrust flavors than the sweet maltyness of the initial taste. Nice dry bitter finish at the end. Warm alchohol presence  M - Nice medium to semi heavy body, well carbonated to make the pronounced flavors and alcohol very drinkable.  O - Flavor filled, alcohol strong and still very drinkable.

140,2671,plfahey,4.68,"12 oz. bottle (2011 vintage) poured into a tulip glass.  Appearance-Amber to mahogany with fantastic clarity and a giant, yellow-cream colored head with great lacing and retention. Looks awesome and truly imposing. When swirled about the glass, you can get a sense for how viscous it is.  Aroma-Bright burst of hops up front-pine, citrus, grapefruit, lemon, and a hint of resin. Underneath is a foundation of rich toffee, dark caramel, and molasses. Just a whiff of alcohol. Some orange as well, though I'm not quite sure where that's coming from.  Flavor-Huge flavor on the palate. Starts out with assault of piney hops, followed by rich depth of toffee malt with molasses and dark caramel-almost raisiny at times. After the malt shows in the mid-palate, assertive hop bitterness and flavor kick in. The hop bitterness and high alcohol dry out the palate, while piney, grapefruit hops soar through the long aftertaste. Rich, powerful, and awesome.  Mouthfeel-Medium full body and moderate carbonation make this almost chewy, but it just falls short of that mark-I wish it were just a bit fuller. High hop bitterness leaves the mouth buzzing, while the high alcohol warms from within.  This beer is truly definitive of the style-this is an American barleywine through and through, and a damn tasty one at that. I'm not sure what more needs to be said. I don't think this one holds up to age as well as some other barleywines do, but within the first few years (or even fresh), this beer kicks some serious ass.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,Alieniloquium,4.08,"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter.  Appearance - Deep amber body that's pretty clear topped with an off-white head. Good legs and great lacing. I like to swirl it in the glass to make myself look sophisticated.  Smell - Pungent hops. Piney and citrusy aromas that are quickly overwhelmed by caramel. It also smells boozy, but I generally don't hold that against a beer unless it's offensive. The only thing that prevents me from rating it higher is the lack of malt complexity. Still smells awesome.  Taste - The flavor follows the aroma exactly. Piney hop flavor up front, sweet caramel midrange, and a great hop bitterness in the finish. Again, it's not complicated, it's just good.  Mouthfeel - Heavy side of medium-bodied. Viscous enough to coat the tongue and let the flavors linger. Not such intense carbonation, which makes it feel creamy. This is how I like barleywines to feel.  Overall - The only thing it lacks is complexity. A variety of flavors and it would be spot-on. As it is, there not a thing you can complain about in this beer. I started with a case and I'm down to 12. We'll see how long they last me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

It pours an ever-so-slightly hazy amber-garnet topped by a finger or so of off-white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit, toffee, orange peel, light pine, very light mint, and a touch of cantaloupe. The taste is as though a mountain of citrusy hops (grapefruit, pineapple, cantaloupe, and then some pine as well) was thoroughly drizzled with thick, sweet caramel. A nice balance, with a sizable, though not o'erwhelming, amount of booziness. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly creamy feel.

A: Poured a slightly hazy ruby/brown color with a foamy off-white head with nice retention and thick, sticky lacing left on the glass.  S: I was not prepared for the hops on the aroma, tons of both citrus and pine with a solid caramel backbone. Some tropical fruits including grapefruit and pineapple.  T: Again, surprisingly hoppy. A combination of both citrus/tropical and pine flavors with more of the former - some grapefruit and pineapple. The is a sizeable malt backbone giving a sweetness as well as a slight nutty/toasty characteristic.  M: Very smooth (the aged bottles were smoother), medium bodied, slightly filling, with moderate carbonation.  O: Very good!

140,2671,mattjv,4.62,"A-Pours a dark amber color with copper highlights around the edges. 1.5 fingers of foamy head with good retention considering 9.6% ABV.  S-Rich, sticky caramel malt sweetness comes out strong. Lots of hop presence as expected, big resinous pine and orange citric character. Alcohol is definitely present on the aroma but kept in check.  T-Rich caramel malt presence starts it on a sweet note, bitterness comes in quick and strong. loads of piny hop flavors reminiscent of chewing on a mouthful of needles. Lemon and orange flavors provide a citrus complement to the hop backbone, did I mention bitterness? Comes in very strong and lasts long into the finish with a mildly soapy component. As with the aroma, some alcohol spice and heat are present but it doesn't run amok.  M- Full bodied, moderate carbonation pleasantly prickles on the tongue without overwhelming any of the taste.  0-A great brew with tremendous flavor and bitterness. Steer very clear if bitter beers aren't your thing, otherwise give it a try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,shand,4.45,"2011 12oz bottle poured into a nonic.  This is a great looking brew. A fairly clear brown-red color with a huge amount of off-white head that retains forever and leaves thick gobs of lacing. The aroma is nice, an upfront dank citric hoppiness over sweet caramel malts. The taste is quite well-composed. The sweet malts come through right away, but a HUGE dank hop kick comes in, almost like it's chasing the liquid down my throat. A bit of alcohol is present on this stage as well. Nice bitter aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is very full-bodied with a bit of smoothness from a moderate amount of carbonation. The drinkability is quite good for such a big beer. Overall, a great beer. Looking forward to having some of these aged.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,NATOuk,4.42,"Sierra Nevada 2011 Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale  Appearance A dark golden red, initial white head falling back to a witte ring around the glass  Smell Dark malts, dark fruit, some grassy notes and a noticeable citrus aroma  Taste Big taste here, initial sweetness and dark fruit flavours, then a massive bitterness starts to develop and peaks on the finish. Some citrus notes here as well. A massive bitterness dominates the finish and hangs around for a long time  Mouthfeel Medium carbonation, medium body, coats the mouth nicely  Overall A fantastic beer to sit and savour, great for hopheads given the high hop rates and high alcohol strength. Recommend you try this if you see it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,djsmith1174,4.18,"A: Nice reddish brown with a good tan colored head.  S: Nice balance of grapefruit and sweetness from the malts.  T: Starts nicely with the grapefruit from the hops and transitions to the sweet caramel malts. the extreme balance of the flavors really makes this beer shine.  M: Medium viscosity and slickness that I expect from a Barleywine.  O: I really enjoy this beer both fresh and with age. Fresh, it's like and extreme IIPA due to the hop profile and the malt sweetness in the backbone. It becomes more of a Barleywine with age since the hop character settles a bit. Either way it's a damn fine brew that I seek out several 6 packs of every year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,humuluslupulus8,4.1,"A: Bigfoot was a leather brown hue with some red undertones. The head was soft-looking and khaki colored.  S: The aroma consisted of a strong, but equal, presence of both the malt and hops. I could also detect the slight sting of the alcohol.  T: The flavor was bittersweet and balanced; again, the alcohol was noticeable but not distracting. Each sip also left a bitter aftertaste on my tongue.  M: This beer was VERY thick, and it had a creamy head. This beer definitely felt thicker than any other beer I've drank, even more than North Coast Brewing's Old Rasputin.  O: Overall, I liked this beer but found it too strong to finish. Between the substantial content of malt sweetness and hops bitterness and the dense mouthfeel, I could only take small sips of this beer. Moreover, I only think I made it about half way through the bottle because the beer was so intense. I think my Bigfoot would have been considerably more enjoyable if it had been aged for at least a year; my bottle was from the 2011 batch. I can tell much care went into making this beer, and I hope I'll be able to drink a Bigfoot some time in the future that has been aged for a year or more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Lillenk,4.02,Had on tap at Grill One Eleven.  Appearance was a very nice dark brownish red.  Smell was huge with tons of sweet smells and malty smells.  Taste was also huge. Tons going on with anything from sweet to roasty to almost earthy and grassy.  Mouthfeel was huge. Very big bodied.  Overall a great drink but because of the full body and high ABV it would be very difficult to drink more than one or two.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,JerseyKirk,4.13,A: Dark brown with a white 1 finger head.  S: Very subtle citrus notes.  T: It's odd to say this but it tastes/smells a little like pot.

140,2671,hotliquor,4.11,"Appearance: Clear, light tan foam clings to the glass, beautiful mahogany color.  Smell: Rich malt, caramel, toffee, dark crystal, booze and citrus hops. Piney, grapefruit, and floral. Not as fresh tasting as when it was first released, but really good.  Taste: Bittersweet. Big malt and hop flavor, with lingering resin and warming alcohol. This is aggressive, but well done. Nutty dark crystal and explosive hop bitterness and flavor, mostly grapefruit and bitter orange peel. Finishes with sweet malt and tons of hop resins.  Mouthfeel: Sweet but the alcohol and hops make this more drinkable. Nice carbonation. Lingering resin and alcohol cleans the palate.  Overall: This is very good. I buy a six pack or more each year and I always enjoy it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,MattyG85,4.47,"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. 2011 bottle.  Appearance: A slightly cloudy dark amber red with a small white head that fades into a white layer. Good lacing around the glass.  Smell: Strong burst of citrus and floral hops followed by sweet caramel malts. Grapefruit, orange peel, lemon, and a bit of spice.  Taste: Citrus and earthy hops up front are followed by sweetness from the caramel malts and fruits. Finishes with some more hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium body and carbonation. Chewy and bitter but still smooth and drinkable.  Overall: A very solid brew. I'm not very experienced with barleywines so I don't really have anything to compare it too. It tastes a lot like a DIPA.  Edit: After having several different barleywines both English and American style, I had a fresh 2012 bottle and still think this is the most hop forward take on the style yet.

140,2671,StoutHunter,4.11,"I picked up a bottle of Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale for $1.99 at The Lager Mill. I have been wanting to try this beer for a while since I heard it was one the better Barleywines available, but every time I thought to pick one up they were sold out for the season, but I am not letting the elusive Bigfoot escape me this time. 2011 Vintage, poured from a short 12oz brown bottle into a mini snifter.  A- I like the label on this beer, it fits the name and isn't as plain as most of Sierra Nevada's labels seem to be, I also like that the year was printed on the cap, very helpful for cellaring. It poured a nice caramel amber color with four fingers worth of fluffy white head that died down to a thick layer that left lots of nice looking lacing.  S- The aroma starts off with some sweet caramel malts, but are quickly overpowered by large amounts of citrus and floral hops that pretty much dominate the aroma and are mostly citrus with some pine thrown in there for good measure. I also pick up the faint aroma of alcohol, which is to be expected from this style. Smells pretty similar to a highly hopped IPA.  T- The taste starts off with a big presence of hops, its like a half and half mixture of citrus and piney hops that make for a pretty big hop profile and pretty hop forward Barleywine. In the middle I pick up the caramel malts that have the right amount of sweetness to it. The finish is moderately bitter with a slight hint of booze at the end.  M- Sticky, Medium bodied and it was pretty carbonated which I wasn't expecting but enjoyed.  Overall I though this was a pretty good barleywine. Pretty much all the Barleywine's I have had have all been heavy on the malts and malt forward, in this brew the malts take a back seat to the hops. I think I like the malts forward Barleywine's better but I can still appreciate the complexity's of this highly hopped Barleywine. I fell like the malt heavy ones are better suited for the colder temperatures of the winter, while this highly hopped one seems better suited for those cooler summer nights around the camp fire, each one has it's own good time and place. I don't know if this beer is that drinkable but since it is not as sweet as some of the other ones I have had I could see cracking another one if I had it. If I can find a 6 pack I think I will buy it, this would make a great summertime Barleywine. If you like your Barleywine's Hop forward then this is the brew for you, hell if you just a fan of Barleywine's in general you should try this. This was a great solid beer from Sierra Nevada, I would like to throw a couple of these in the cellar to see how this brew stacks up once the hops start to fade, I am willing to bet it will taste even better but completely different. This is up their with Torpedo for the best beer I have had from Sierra Nevada. EDIT- The 2012 version is just as good and even more intesence since this one was much fresher the 2011 I had last year, through and through one of the best looking barleywines and a really intense beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Cyberkedi,4.3,"Aroma is fruity with an undertone of malt and a firm hint of molasses. It pours a pretty dark brownish amber, almost mahogany, with a thick, fluffy, fairly persistent white head. Luscious flavor is fruity and woody with hints of caramel and brown sugar. Alcohol bite is present and a bit tinny, but not as strong as with most barleywines, which is a plus. Texture is smooth, fizzy and edgy, leaving a tingly and woody finish. I for one recommend this to barleywine lovers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Lots of citrus in the nose, specifically tangerines, with a solid sweet malty backbone and a hint of alcohol. The taste is intense! Huge resiny, tangy, spicy, hop bitterness with a good measure of pine and orange peel and a hint of cinnamon. This is all nicely complemented by a syrupy malt sweetness that tries to tame the intense bitterness. This thing really opens up nicely as it warms. A thick and chewy sipper with a subtle alcohol burn. A classic interpretation of the style. Yet another winner from one of my favorite breweries!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Lauthaha,4.03,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a dinner glass.  Appearance: Beer pours a light-to-medium mahogany color with a little carbonation visible through the glass. Head is the color of well-cooked egg whites, and it recedes into what looks like a mini rice cake/wafer on the surface of the brew. Lots of intricate spiderweb lacing. The only thing that would have made this perfect would have been a bit more head retention; but as it is, it's spectacular.  Smell: Toasty, sweet malt character underscored by some piney/citrusy hops. Lots of ester in the nose, but thankfully it mixes well with the rest of the scents. Well balanced but very strong.  Taste/Mouthfeel: At first sip, lots of citrus and alcohol. Almost no carbonation, but the carbonation that is there lends itself to giving the beer a touch more body. Nicely played. Piney hops dominate the middle-taste, with some of that malt sweetness coming through at the very end of the sip. Aftertaste is toasted oats and pine forest romps.  Overall: A pretty decent brew. It's easily drinkable, but the high ABV is not all that well-hidden, so exercise caution with this guy. I can almost taste the Bigfoot in this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The smell is of sweet malt with hints of grassy and citrus hops. Taste starts with a bit of the complex hops, then it shifts to the malty sweetness. Mouthfeel is just right and carbonation is mild.

S - big rich malt sweetness. spicy hops. some sweet caramel and brown sugar. there are also hints of toasty bread, some very light citrus and floral pine. very nice aroma.  T/M - after the complexity of the nose I was a bit let down by the flavor. not saying that the flavors are bad or bland but after enjoying such a rich nose I expected the flavor to follow suit. strong punch of bitter, spicy hops up front which are cleaned up with some sweetness from the malts and a hint of caramel. the hops are the dominant flavor and they're stronger than I thought they'd be. finishes slightly bitter and with a bit of the alcohol. mouthfeel is really smooth and creamy. medium bodied. high carbonation.  Overall this is one of the best barleywines that I've had. It's the epitome of the style. very tasty. a little lower in drinkability because of the 9.6% ABV.

(4.5)  - Smell is of rich sweet caramel malt.. a bit of bread and rye.. a spicy hopness and rubbing alcohol. (4.0)  - Tastes much the same.. sweet and bold, spicy and sour.. creamy... and a bit too much of a rubbing alcohol flavor for me. But I am sure with age it wouldn't be as noticeable. (3.5)  - Not too dry an aftertaste, and leaves a certain sweetness. A bit chewy. (4.0)  - Quite drinkable, but rich. Definite warming of the stomach. (4.0)  === 2011 Bottle fresh. 5/10/2011  - Big fluffy head, leaves a goof 1/2 inch of light khaki colored foam.. clear ruby brown brew, looks plenty carbonated as many bubbles slowly carve their way through the malts sugars.  - Big crisp hops.. grassy and herbal, some pine. Sweet burnt caramelized sugars, caramel malt, candies, and earthy fire. Spice and alcohol present.  - Certainly a very hoppy Bigfoot this time around. Very refined and well tuned caramel flavors.. burnt caramel candy, earthy and grassy pine hops, and plenty of brown sugars.. a very well balanced, and hoppy barleywine. To me this one stands out over some of the years past, such as the '09.  - Medium bodied, drying from bitter hops, slightly syrupy and sticky. Afterall, this is a sweet barleywine.  - Overall a big fan of this vintage. The hops are explosive, and yet the super bitterness balances the super sweetness very well.. thus resulting in a huge array of flavors.

Not a lot of carbonation bubbles but the head is massive. Light brown or tan in color and a giant three fingers. Very frothy and quite sticky looking.  Big malt sweetness in the nose, a bit citrus aroma maybe just a hint of bread. No alcohol is present here.  The taste is a little different than the nose. Still has the huge malt sweetness but there is some bitter hop taste. The yeast is still really there in the nose but not here in the taste, this is a good thing. There is some alcohol here too but not boozy tasting. As it warms a bit I am getting some citrus maybe an orange or maybe it's not citrus more like pineapple Enjoyable!  The mouth is okay for the style. Rich, silky and a bit chewy. It doesn't have the huge mouth that Old Guardian or Old Ruffian have but not bad at all.  Overall I enjoyed this I would like to set this one aside for a while and try it again. It won't matter if the hop flavors fade, I think the rest of it may mesh a bit more.

I poured the 12oz bottle into a snifter glass to find a deep brown body. The body was on the hazy side and had an one inch head that left very little lacing. The aroma had a sweet caramel malt feel to it. There was a strong, bitter hop presence that hit my pallet right away. The hops presence gives away to a sweet malty flavor. As the beer warmed up the flavors really started to come out more and I enjoyed the beer more with each sip. The carbination is noticable and you notice the alochol as well.

S- Big piney and citrusy aroma up front, sweet malt smell is there, but relatively a backing role. Just a little alchohol presence in the smell.  T- Just like the flavor, big hop punch up front followed by a little caramel and tobacco flavors. The malt is definately takes the back seat in this one. Slight alchohol warming in the back of the throat after the sip.  MF- Almost a full bodied beer, but falls up just short. The big flavors more than make up for it.  O- This is one amazing beer.

140,2671,Fluke828,3.98,"2011 vintage. 12oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Usually there is a julian date on both the bottle and the label however only seem to see one here on the label and it looks like January 11th of this year was when this brew went into the bottle but I digress, it is a barleywine and bigfoot afterall...  A-&gt; Massive head on a relatively gentle pour, as in like at least 3+ fingers worth of slightly offwhite colored head. Deep ruby ambers and copper colors.  S-&gt; Hmmm, nothing really jumped out at me here however I have recently gotten over a mild illness and allergies are in full swoon with all the pollen and shit that has been flying around these days...getting a bit of dark fruits and some serious malt breads/biscuits. Some floral notes as well on the bouquet.  T-&gt; Ah, there she is. Took a bit but finally recognizing that classic bigfoot taste from years past. Sweet malts and dark fruits with sugared plums and figs with some serious caramel notes and toasted grains as well. Getting some herbal flavors as well as a nice crisp and prevalent hop presence.  M-&gt; Nice crsip feeling on the toungue that I attribute to the high (but pleasant) hop presence in this B-wine. Medium-bodied and nice and crisp with great carbonation and the lack of the typical syrup-esque texture/flavor is a welcome respite for the style.  O-&gt; Overall, Bigfoot never dissapoints, and this year is right on point. Really like the fact that this is a hopped up barleywine and doesn't have the aforementioned syrup qualities that most brews of this style typically have. Not that that is a bad thing as a mtter of fact it is a quality I come to expect and love, when I'm in the B-wine kind of mood.

The foam sat atop the glass for a good three to four minutes before dissipating enough to drink. The aromas are very sweet and full of raisins especially. You also get sweet carmel malts and cherries. Unfortunately the flavors aren't quite as complex. You get a boatload of sweet malts, oak, vanilla, caramel, and candied sugar but it's hard to get past the sweetness. This three year old barleywine drinks a little flatter than I'd like. It's lost considerable carbonation throughout time. Overall this is definitely a solid barleywine, but it's very, very sweet and too sweet for my liking.

Pours a deep dark amber that only shows through the light with a creamy light tan head that has a great retention. The aroma holds a great deal of caramel malt, some citrus and some dark fruit. The flavor holds a great balance between a grapefruit/grass hop flavor and caramel malt, there’s also elements of plum, brandy, and alcohol.

There is a very potent herbal note present, along with some bitterness from the hops, and a hint of some citrus. This one seems to be dominated by hops with the malts seeming like an after thought.

140,2671,BarryMFBurton,3.98,"Note to self: anything named after Sasquatch will instantly catch my eye. This Sierra Nevada creation is proof of that. I was just introduced to SN with their Torpedo Extra IPA, and, I must say, I was quite impressed. Plus, I’m not too familiar with the barleywine style, so this is new territory for me in many respects.  A: Dark, nearly opaque pumpkin juice orange with a large tan head. It gives the impression of a bold brew, due to the fact that it’s so damn thick. Good lacing all around, although the foam does give way after a rather short period of time.  S: A big burst of hops at first, wheaty goodness following soon after. Spicy booze and honey malts abound. A big nose for Bigfoot.  T: Wow, tons of flavor upfront. Honey/toffee malts are damn sweet, taking an upfront stance at the beginning of the palate. The herbal/phenolic notes come next, but they are easily overtaken by something in the blend that I wasn’t expecting – some sort of tangy tone that sticks with you. It’s a welcome distinction. The hops are sharp and crisp, and provide a strong presence in the aftertaste.  M: The sweetness is a lot to balance, so it should be a sipper for sure. Sometimes, though, the carbonation proves a bit excessive, practically forcing it to go down too quick for its style. Turned me off at times.  O: This beer has a lot of flavor, but at first I didn’t know if I was a fan of the balance. It seemed too heavy on the sweetness for my taste. A few drinks in, though, the flavors expanded a bit and opened up a more enjoyable experience. It’s a beer that grew on me by the end of the bottle; strange but true. Now I’d be perfectly content with a six-pack of these monsters! Funny how it works sometimes…",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,TheBrewo,4.13,"We pour a brew of glowing red-orange, like the rays of a deep setting sun. It holds a thick, one finger tall head of tan bubbles. It recedes at a medium pace and leaves a single film of big bubbles across the glass, with thick lacing clinging around the sides. Carbonation looks mild, and much sediment is found throughout the glass. The aroma smells sweetly of grain and, of course, dried barley. Sweetness is enhanced by hints of strawberries and honey. A big booze presence is noted, with grassy hops making up the remainder of the nose. As we sip, the first things noted are big waves of warming alcohols and soapy hops. These bitter, biting flavors are cut at the peak of the sip with sweetness of fruit, with apricot and orange being the frontrunners. Malts also cruise in, taking out a bit more of the bittering front flavors. The finish reverts back to the beginning, with bittering citrus rind, big slick hops, and a good deal of booze. All the while a coating of balancing malt flavor is palpable along the entire length of the tongue. The aftertaste breathes bitterly. Here we speak mainly of barley and malt, grassy yet sweetened hops, and fusel alcohols. The body is on the thicker side and the carbonation is light. With each sip comes a nice slurp, made affordable by the syrupy quality of the beer. The mouth is coated nicely, but is ultimately left dried by the bittering hop aftertaste. The abv is within range, and this beer is inherently a sipper.  Overall, the most impressive thing about this brew was the deep, gorgeous coloring. It had the darkness of the style, but a beautiful glowing red to give that extra glam. The aroma was also nice, with a slight fruitiness and spice, amongst the hoppiness and grain. This brew really opened up the more it sat and warmed to the proper temperature, much more so than other beers of this style.

140,2671,Schwarzbart,4.53,"A: 2011 Year. A big 2+ finger, off-white, creamy head. As the head settles it gets super thick looking like a fluffy pancake, it looks awesome. Color is a dark chestnut amber. Carbonation is surprising to see and it isn't as thick looking as many barleywines I've had. Great, stippled creamy lacing.  S: To my surprise, the first thing I notice is the piney hops. Also, some citrusy,grassy, piney, grapefruit hops. Fruit notes of tropical fruits, apricot and orange. Some sweet honey, mint and cocoa nibs backed by a sweet maltness.  T: The hop bitterness is high. It's super grassy and has a piney quality to it. The next quality noticed is the sweetness from the malts then the alcohol esters. Cocoa nibs and raw sugar notes also give it sweetness. Candy-like malts, biscuity, caramel notes and mint.  Overall: Medium to full-bodied and leaning on the full-bodied side. Hops are tingly and the aftertaste of the hops last a long time. A very good drinkable barleywine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,hiku7,4.12,"Poured a 2011 to a 12 ounce bottle to a stemless red wine glass. Color is reddish (pomegranate)-brown with an off-white head. Smells of peaches and citrus and piney hops and toffee malt.  Tastes starts immediately warm, with caramel, toffee and molasses, followed by a deep, sharp hop bite, like a sore throat coming on, but dripping with hop oils.  Mouthfeel is sticky and hot, but not syrupy like many other big beers. Overall, I like this beer because it feels complex; it changes with each taste as the temperature changes. I plan to cellar the rest of the six pack.  Disclaimer: This is my first barleywine, and I like it a lot. That means two things. I may not be describing it in proper terms, and I'll be buying many more to compare, so I may have to revisit this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Only dating on the bottle I can find is 0 348 11 00. Pours a lovely deep ruby hue. Aged a couple of months in my beer fridge w/ a temp of 49F.  The nose is quite hoppy, intense, piney resinous, some citrus-floral notes too. An easy swirl of the drink produces a very large amount of head. Alcoholic mouthfeel comes right in on the first sip. Not as much hop presence as I'd had the first time I drank this. The malt has had time to come through w/ the aging. Has quite a bit of warmth. After this aging, the sweet malt has more of a chance to come through. Still a little sting & warmth from the alcohol. Has a pretty long & dry finish but the hops really overpower in this bottle like it did the first time I had this. Still got a lotta hop though don't misunderstand me.  Overall, a pretty good beer. It's hard to say how much this beer fits w/ style due to the HUGE variability of characteristics from this style. I think I'll wait, if I can, for the the next drink a year from now. Have 3 more to age & am looking forward to see how it develops over time. Prosit!  The mouthfeel is quite rich & very full.

Can't help but to compare it to a sweeter, maltier, slightly less hoppy version of Celebration  T: An almost wild mix of bittersweet malts and nice, bitter hops that attack from start to finish, even beyond. Some slight peppery alcohol that is balanced nicely by the malts and hops  M: A nice, big beer with a perfect amount of carbonation  D/O: I know the calorie count on this one is huge, but it definitely can't stop me from drinking a few of these.

140,2671,nickfl,4.32,"A - The beer fills the glass and forms a half a finger of off-white foam on top of the very clear, light brown body. The head settles out quite quickly and leaves just a film of lace on the glass in its wake.  S - The classic American barleywine aroma of spicy hops and earthy caramel malt. Notes of pepper, mustard, and pine.  T - Spicy hops and thick toffee malt up front with some distinct pine notes. More pine hops in the middle with sweet, sugary elements of brown sugar and caramel. Things finish up with more mustardy, spicy hop flavors and strong, somewhat harsh hop bitterness to balance the rich malt profile.  M - Medium-thick body, moderate carbonation, and a fairly dry finish.  D - This is a tough beer to review, it is such an achetypical classic of its particular style that it is hard to give it an objective examination. Still, like a Beatles album, there is a reason it has become a classic that is a standard bearer for all that followed. The spicy hop character is brimming with pine and more subtle, darker character that is both influenced by and harmonizes with the deep, sugary malt. This is a timeless and complex beer that is all the more notable in that it doesn't require extensive aging to become drinkable the way that some other classic American barleywines do.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

I gave it a pretty tame pour and the head is shooting out the top of the glass. Rich thick frothy head, Nice ruby translucent colored ale. Heck, this looks wonderful.  S: Sweet cherries, grapefruit and strawberries, slightly medicinal, hoppy fruits, a touch of sour. Sweet fruit finish.  T: Syrupy hop attack, intense for sure. This is an excellent tasting barleywine. A very nice balance between the astringent hops and the syrupy thick barleywine body. Surprisingly, not much heat from the 9.6 APV.  M: Wonderful syrupy mouthfeel. Sharp hop tingle and some rather aggressive almost muted champagne like carbonation.  O: Overall, this tastes like the quintessential American Barleywine. It manages to be hoppy , syrupy desert-like, drinkable, and balanced all in one. Much better than most Barleywine's I've tried. Would love to try this on tap or cellared for a year +.

140,2671,Nerudamann,4.2,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter glass.  Look - a lovely, almost ruby red color, murky, with about a finger's worth of deep khaiki-colored foam that dissipates slowly.  Smell - hop presence is evident, perhaps some Cascade hops.  Taste and Mouthfeel - hop presence is even more prevalent in the taste. Bitterness is there at the very beginning and lasts throughout the taste and into the aftertaste, but not too strong in the aftertaste. It's an almost pulsing feeling as the bitterness hits and then fades away. There's a slight hint of a muskiness just before the bitterness hits. Texture is very well-balanced.  Overall - way too bitter for my own choice, but seems to be very true to the style, which is something I can very much appreciate.

But as the seasons changed, I slowly became the beer geeks that I am today. Bigfoot's color is a deep, cloudy red with a pale orange 2 inch head. It has a creamy mouthfeel at the beginning then i got a toasty feeling towards and at the end. Though the taste is a liitle strong for me, I point out that a) I'm drinking it at room temp out of my favorite laser etched pint glass, and b) I can only assume that because of my general lack of drinking any Sierra Nevada styles it make me a noob to this good beer.

140,2671,Spadoof,4.43,"Purchased from: Williams IGA (Vienna, Ohio) Origin: 12 oz Bottle Bottled on: 2011 Tasted on: 04-24-11 Glassware: Ephermere Tulip Glass Serving Temperature: 55 F  Notes: Picked this up at a local grocery store fresh off the truck. This is the first Barley Wine I am going to review.  Appearance: Pours a ridiculously fluffy white-tan head (About 2 fingers high). This might have been my fault due to a slightly vigorous pour. The retention on this is ridiculous! Its like a giant white cloud that sticks around and leaves a beautiful sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. The body is a ""slightly"" cloudy orange/red/copper sunset color. A great start.  Smell: Its like a kick in the face! Plenty of hops right of the bat followed by malts and bright alcohol notes. As this warms slightly, I pick up faint hints of chocolate, caramel & dark fruits. These are still dominated by the ridiculous amount of hops & alcohol. This has me pretty intimidated.  Taste: WOW! This pretty well matches the nose. Big, Hoppy, Malty Goodness. Starts off, with a slight sweetness of the malts which is quickly side swiped by the hops and finally falls down the back of my tongue and throat leaving a trail of alcohol heat. The finish is dry like a liquor, but leaves a little of sugary malts behind to clean up this tornado of flavors. This is a pretty unique beer. I found it to be quite interesting and pleasurable.  Mouthfeel: Thick and slightly syrupy, but overall very well balanced. The carbination seems pretty high, but then again this is a really young beer.  Drinkability: Its a sipper for sure. But is a great choice for an after meal beverage.  Concluding thoughts: Great beer. I feel I can not really give it an accurate review until I has time to mature. The flavors are bold and in your face, but after a year or two of proper cellaring, I'm sure the flavors will come together in a more balanced way.

140,2671,wnh,4.47,"2009 vintage. 12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter.  Pours a deep, clear, bright mahogany with less than a finger of very light tan head. Simple and straightforward, and really beckons me to drink.  Citrus hoppiness on the nose. Sweet biscuity malt backbone, stronger, it seems, even with a month's worth of age. There's a nice vinous alcohol character toward the end of the glass.  Taste is hops up front, almost in-your-face with the first few bottles. Citrus first, then earthy, and bitter throughout. Lots of malt to bring things into balance, but young Bigfoot definitely walks on the hoppy side. Medium-bodied, leaning toward heavy, with a good mouth coating effect. Minor carbonation, but enough to cleanse the palate.  Overall a fantastic beer. Now I see what all the fuss is about.  ===  Update. 2006 vintage, reviewed 1/21/2011.  Pours clear golden copper, turning murky as I empty the contents of the bottle. Limp, soft tan head with little staying power.  Nose is incredibly dense and rich; toffee and caramel, toasted bread, candied citrus, candied pecans. A nice berry fruitiness adds complexity. Not terribly hoppy, but the hops aren't absent either.  The palate is quite different than I remember. Initial wave of rich malty goodness, but that soon washes past as a spicy, earthy, juniper-cedar evergreen note steps in, lingering a while. Actually tastes like my mental image of the Pacific northwest. A bit rainy and damp, perhaps, earthy, mossy, generally green. Malt is full and deep and rich and more than holds up the evergreen (aged hop?) notes.  Full bodied and firm, but approachable.

Nice rings of lace lin the glass on the drink down. Smells of biscuits, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and citrus zest. Taste is very similar but in the reverse order of the smells: citrus zest hops, brown sugar/caramel/toffee, with the biscuit like malt coming through at the end. Medium hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. Thick and chewy in the mouth with each sip. Slight alcohol burn in the throat. Overall, this is a good barleywine that packs a hop punch.

This one has been sitting around a while, the 2010 vintage bottled in mid-December 2009.  Poured into an snifter-ish mug, this looks phenomenal. On the table the beer appears a rusty chestnut, but when held up to the late-afternoon sun it takes on the color of blood orange flesh. The frothy foam rides high and brings to mind the top of a root beer float.  Citrusy and woody hops hit the nose first, almost like a juicy fresh harvest ale. Caramel and spicy alcohol are clearly detectable as well. Taste is much sweeter than the nose and it starts out syrupy before the bitterness dries out the finish. I must admit, the bitterness and alcohol burning is a little more than I'd like. Mouthfeel is good and certainly holds up to the rest of the flavors, but I may hang on to one of these for a few years to let the harsh finish mellow out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

It seems that I noticed the back-bite first, so I'll start with that. Bitter, bitter, hoppy... There was a nice caramel-like presence to the brew in general, but make no mistake: This was a dense brew! Roasted pineapple? (weird, I know).  M: Thick... you'll need a knife to cut it.

I remember when I was getting into English Barleys, and picked up one of these monsters, I was flabbergasted! I had no idea what was going on in my mouth other than an explosion of flavors!

140,2671,TheCommonwealth,3.18,"I picked this barleywine up not expecting a drinkable beer. I had heard from some friends that it was the ""King of Hops."" But, when I saw it at my local beer store, I decided to try it anyways.  I purchased a single bottle and poured it into a tulip glass. Man, what a beautiful color it is. It pours a beautiful deep amberish color. For what it's worth, it maintained a nice 1.5 finger head but I suspect some of that is due to the tulip glass I poured it in.  It smelled like the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company had gathered several bushels of hops and somehow, in defiance of the laws of gravity, packed them into a 12 ounce bottle. Honestly, it has one of the strongest hop aromas I've ever encountered in a beer.  Luckily, it doesn't taste nearly as strong as it smells. In fact, compared to some IPAs I've had, it's relatively mild. Obviously, the overwhelming flavor is a a nice hop note, but there are other flavors present as well. Chiefly, I picked up a rather strong grapefruit taste and a more subtle, but still present, caramel flavor. This is a very, very complex beer. There are numerous other flavors that you can pick up. These other flavors, as in most beers, become easier to detect as the beer warms.  The most unfortunate aspect of this beer, and the main reason for the 3/5 rating, is the aftertaste. Wow. I drank this beer at ~9pm before I went to sleep, and I still had the aftertaste when I woke up the next morning.  Overall, I think that this beer has caught a bad reputation for being a ""hop bomb."" Really, once you get past the aroma, it isn't all that hoppy. It isn't a great beer, but it can be enjoyable. I wouldn't mind trying another, if only to investigate what other subtle flavors are present.

There was a lot going on in many directions and it seemed muddled up. the beer was almost amber with great clarity, a small tan head, fast fading retention and little lace. The smell was amazing! Tons of hops! Citrus, pine, floral and grassy, lemon and grapefruit, pear and green apple, with a nice sweet caramel and honey in the back. The taste just didn't come together right for me. It was hard to finish. The alcohol was well hidden behind the hop bomb, but the hops was all over the place. Bitter grapefruit with lemon notes, resiny pine and green apple were fighting. Hints of pear, caramel and honey just didn't make a smooth mix. Hints of butterscotch, and a slight burn of alcohol. Light fruity characters. Just too much going on. Oily and slick.

140,2671,CASK1,4.52,"2011 batch, poured into a tulip glass. Nice medium amber color with very good clarity for a beer of this strength and bitterness. Fluffy light tan head fades fairly quickly.  Aroma is hops, hops, and more hops. Citrusy and piney, with some floral notes thrown in for good measure. There is a light, sweet, caramelly malt aroma that just balances the hops, and becomes more prominent as the beer warms. There are some yeast esters that show as a light fruitiness, but specifics are difficult to define through all the hops.  Intense flavor! Tons of hops, as both flavor and bitterness. High bitterness, supported by a substantial malty sweetness. Very well balanced when considering the style. High hop flavor shows as citrus, pine, woody, and floral. Lots of fruity esters add to the complexity.  Medium-high body is perhaps a little lower than expected, and makes this a dangerously drinkable beer. Medium carbonation.

Thanks to seeswo for this gem. Tulip glass.  Pours with very little head or lacing, appearing cloudy and kind of like dark apple cider. Smell is a lot of red and dark dried fruit and rich caramel. Taste is mostly caramel and decadent toffee; surprisingly, there's still a dose of bitterness which sits strong on the back of the tongue. Finishes incredibly dry which accentuates the bitterness... and I think that is one of the main things I don't like about Bigfoot.

First sip was hops up front and some caramel sweetness and spices. After it warmed, the last few sips had some more buttery, butterscotch notes trying to poke though the hops.

A strong pour yields a 2 finger creammy off-white head that withers slowly leaving massive clumps of foam clinging to the sides of the glass. The body is a translucent reddish amber color. Thick lacing covers the glass in gravity-defying sheets.  Spicy hops and sweet grainy malts assault the nostrils. It almost smells like cinammon rye toast. A slight booze smell is also detected.  Smooth, mellow roasted malt starts the journey, followed by spicy hops, a light lingering bitterness, and a low alcohol warmth. Every sip is like taking a journey through this beer. Coffee, caramel, toffee, burnt oak, dry resiny hops, and a bit of booze all join you on your trek.  Heavy bodied with moderate carbonation allows Bigfoot to coat your mouth and stick around.  While not exactly refreshing, this beers complexity and excellent flavors keep me reaching for the glass. I keep wanting to investigate it further, but each sip is too enjoyable for scrutiny. Allowing this beer to warm allows the flavors to become more bold.  As this beer ages, it mellows nicely. Its robust flavors round out and flow together.

The balance of the malts and hops give a very balanced beer, especially for it being the newest edition.

With a good swirl I get lots of burnt sugary notes like molasses, toast, caramel, brown sugar, roasted nuts and hints of cocoa. I also get leafy and herbal hop characters. Pretty inviting aroma.  T - Upfront I get some alcohol and bitterness, and as it clears I get really nice malt characters: brown sugar, nuts, cocoa, caramel and toffee, just really tasty. Towards the finish I start getting a pretty strong leafy hop character, pretty strong bitterness that lingers and lots of alcohol. You know your drinking a higher ABV brew, but it works pretty well.  M - Silky smooth texture with soft crispness and a relatively full body.  O - This is a beer that your gonna wanna sit back, sip and let warm. I think this is a pretty darn good Barleywine, drinkable for what it is but not something I would drink more than one of because it would probably get to warm and sweet tasting, which I don't like. A great beer I would definitely have again sometime. Definitely pick it up if your into Barleywines and sipping brews.

Hop forward at first on the nose but then quickly bleeds into bright apple from the alcohol and a rich caramel and sugary base.

S- Strong wallop of citrus and pine hop upon pouring. After a few minutes, the caramel malts, and an earthy hop note.  T- Big caramel maltiness, quickly followed by a solid citrus and pine bitterness attack that balances the sweetness. A fair boozy kick on the finish.  M- Moderate carbonation. A nice, full body... Nice alcohol warming presence. Very, very good here...  D- Good. Tasty, great feel, and an ""easy drinker"" for it's ~10% ABV .

Nice citrusy orange peel notes make up the background  T: Piney hops smack you across the face at first sip, hops through the middle and a drying hop aftertaste. Faint grapefruit... not getting a lot from the malt (not as much as I was hoping for from the smell). Maybe some sort of dried dark fruit(raisons?)  M: Medium to full body with a syrupy and somewhat sticky mouthfeel. Carbonation is prickly on the tongue.  O: Overall this is a good beer, no doubt.

It's primarily piney but there is a subtle sweet floral hint to it. The malts are pretty faint but there. Barely.  The mouthfeel is about as expected, with a bitter hoppy aftertaste.

140,2671,BranfordBound,4.4,"12 oz stubby bottle dated as bottled on December 31st, 2010 at 2:46 PM. Kept refrigerated. Poured into a DFH shaped pint.  So it's finally time to tackle this mythical beast. After over a year of drinking craft brews, I think I've assembled enough experience to track down the intimidating and formidable Bigfoot. Let's just hope it's enough drinking experience to tame this wild beast of a barleywine, my first of the style.  Pours dark copper with a large and rocky off-white head of almost three fingers. Large head does not equate with a lot of carbonation, though. Lacing very present.  Aroma is very deceptive, smells like a bold Sierra Nevada DIPA. Big hop aromas of pine and grassiness with a little citrus. Sweet caramel malt is actually concealed in the back.  Certainly a big, bold beer. Super strong malty sweetness in the beginning, bready, fruity, and almost brandy/rum like. The hops take over a bit in the back end, although not as much as the aroma alluded to. The hops are similar in flavor, though, very ""Sierra Nevada""; heavy on the pine, little bit of citrus, and noticeably bitter. Tiny bit of alcohol on the back end warms you up, but I imagine with a year or two of age this would subside.  Surprisingly smooth, albeit heavy mouthfeel. On the wet side.  Well, it is drinkable! Heavy bodied and heavy flavors for a 9.6% beer, but that is a positive in this case. Worthy of aging, although you won't find me buying a whole case of it every year. A deserving treat and a great break from the stouts that dominate the winter. While the real bigfoot has yet to be captured, his mystical nature and popularity have been captured by this beer, well done SN, well done!

The smell was that of aromatic hops and flowers, the smell is just a precursor to the taste of hops you are about to receive.  The taste was of hops and more hops. You started with bitterness the the floral hops took over. After the hops you could taste the complex grain build of the barley wine that finished with a nice alcohol burn that left you warm.

The pour on this one yielded a hazy rich red tinged honey color with a 2 inch off white head of foam.  The smell of this one is a rich earthy hop aroma that almost smells like a garden on a good summer day.  The taste of this barley wine style ale is really hoppy up front with a strong malt body coming in after an initial hopping of the palate. That is followed by a small bit of alcohol heat which is soon cancelled out by a nice earthy hop aftertaste that fades away into a slight alcoholic after burn. Pretty good to me out of the 3 barley wines I have tried so far.  The mouthfeel of this one was fairly heavy and chewy with some carbonation adding to the chewy factor.

Clean and fresh smelling beer with a hefty dose of alcohol.  Hop leaning, but well balanced with tons of sweet caramel, toffee and toasty malts. Such a big, full flavored beer that is oh-so smooth. After having many of these aged, I actually think I like it fresh the best. It took me 8 years of drinking Bigfoot to realize that, but I really like the fresh hop profile and supremely balanced malt without any oxidation taking hold.

140,2671,zeledonia,3.76,"2011 vintage, bottled 14 December 2010. The one bottle from my six-pack that I'm drinking now; the rest are going in the cellar.  Pours a very clear deep coppery amber with a buoyant off-white (slightly tan) head that leaves a TON of lacing. A few streams of bubbles coming up.  Smell is surprisingly weak for a barleywine. It's rather clean, thin, and crisp. I get some light hops, a bit of malt, and some booze, but not much else. The smell definitely does not pull me in like it does with some barleywines. In fact, if smelling this blind, I might think it was a lager rather than a barleywine.  Taste is so incredibly different from the smell. And to my taste buds, pretty unique. The malts and the hops are both pretty potent, and they see-saw back and forth, first one asserting themselves, then the other. The malts have a good mix of sweet and rich. The hops bring some bitter balance, though IMO they don't bring that much else to the flavor. They do leave some lingering bitterness. In general, the beer feels a bit jagged, like it could use some time to smooth out. The flavors are all just too potent, and they kinda fight with each other. But it is still quite tasty.  Mouthfeel is medium, as expected. Nothing remarkable, decent carbonation. Clings to the mouth a bit, which lets the bitterness of the hops hold on.  Decent, but not great. Not surprisingly, it really feels like it needs some time to develop and let the flavors come into balance. Looking forward to trying it over the next couple years.

As the beer lingers on the tongue there is a slight hint of sweet caramel, bit the hops push it WAY into the background. There is a good amount of alcohol on the swallow. The mouthfeel is solid, with a slight carbonation sparkle. Drinkability is limited, due to the alcohol burn. I'm reviewing this freshly bought, a few months (or couple years) of aging would have an interesting effect I believe, so i'm gonna save one or two of these to sample in 2012 or 2013 and see if they mellow some.

Once you get past the bitterness and alcohol there is a nice sweetness that I can only imagine gets more prevalent over time.  Mouthfeel: Nice carbonation and not thin by any means.

The body and mouth feel were very nice but once again the taste was almost over powered by hops, again a bit out of place for the style, in my opinion.

Gotta say I am an English BW type of guy that is all about the malts, so needless to say I don't care for Bigfoot fresh. However, w/ 4 years of age this brew is starting to become pretty enjoyable.

140,2671,perrymarcus,4.11,"12oz bottle served ina snifter. 2011 vintage.  pours a beautiful, translucent deep amber/copper hue with orange highlights; yields just shy of 1"" creamy beige head. (expected) middling retention - lapses into a thin cap, collar around the glass - but nice walls of lacing. overall an excellent presentation.  my first impression of the nose is that this is going to be one heck of a hoppy barleywine, even for the american style (this is my first experience with bigfoot, incidentally). very heavy floral/cirtus presence of hops. also notes of sweet malt.  one sip confirms the nose. big bitter hoppiness out front, *almost* reminiscent of a DIPA, but as it warms the maltiness seems to open up and the beer becomes much more complex and flavorful. still, hands down one of the more heavy hopped barleywines i've had.  really nice mouthfeel: luscious, medium-full bodied with average carbonation.  overall this is an excellent barleywine. as noted, a bit too hop-forward for my personal taste, but i can see where a little age would take this beer to another level. i intend to test that theory.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,ehammond1,4.38,"Bottle (2011)  Holiday Wine Cellar Escondido, CA  This beer started gushing on me as soon as I cracked the top. Strange, because I've probably had this beer 1xx times and that's never happened....only on the one I finally choose to review! That being said, this beer is as gorgeous as ever! It's damn near majestic! The darkest ruby almost eats up all the light trying to pass through it. The head is a monster, especially for a beer of this ABV, and it doesn't have any intentions of going anywhere soon! With big, soapy bubbles, it's got quite the legs to stand on, and stand on, and stand on... Sticky sheets and rings of lacing run down the glass as I sip. Perfection.  The aroma is a varied bundle and changes as the beer warms. The first thing I notice is the candied sweetness and the fruity elements in the nose. There's a bit of brandy-soaked cherries in the nose along with a nice punch of floral and citrus hops. The alcohol is certainly present and, unfortunately, just the least bit unpleasant. All in all though, a nose I love returning to.  Another cornucopia in the mouth, similar to the nose. The first thing that always strikes me about Bigfoot, especially when fresh, is the blinding bitterness and strong pungency of the hops. This is one hopped up barleywine. While the hops are certainly there, they don't quite get too far in the way of the sweet cherry, sweet caramel malts, a hint of woodiness and earthiness, and a certain presence of warming alcohol. When aged, I think this beer is very close to perfect, but fresh, it's just a touch too raw and blindingly bitter to truly appreciate the other complexities that are there but just hiding underneath.  The mouthfeel is one of my favorite aspects of this beer. It's thick and chewy and a touch oily but all that simply drinks so well with this flavor-first barleywine.  A wonderful barleywine. It's consistently flavorful, available, and always affordable. It's better with age on it, but a wonderful beast to battle when fresh.  A very special beer to me personally. As a CSU, Chico student, I remember waiting anxiously for this release every year. It opened my eyes to what very good beer could be, and I make sure to pick up at least a 6er every winter.

I wasn't expecting that at all. Beautiful ruby color with a blonde leather looking head. Looks like the head on a root beer float, lots of protein in there and the foam is smooth and palatable almost like whipped topping. If i could give the appearance a 6 I would.  Smells awesome, very hoppy while also maintaining a minty presence and malt backbone. Reminds me slightly of 3rd coast from Bells but a bit hoppier.  Taste is great, but I feel that it's a bit harsh when fresh. Alcohol burn is hard to get past as it kind of disrupts the rest of the tasting experience. Great hops and acidic flavors with decent smoothness from the malt.

T - Unsurprisingly, this one is packed with strong flavors. Bitter piny hops up front followed with a more mellow floral hops as it goes down. Maybe a small hint of alcohol bitterness, but the hops cover it up pretty well.  M - Full bodied and moderate amount of carbonation. Pretty much what you expect out of the style.  D - Very strong bitter flavors, but not in a bad way.

140,2671,EricCioe,4,"This 2011 vintage pours a very deep amber with a one finger white head that dies quickly and leaves lace. On the nose there is a caramel malt base with light fruity esters and a piney hop presence, but overall the nose is pretty muted and takes some agitation to stir up these aromas. In the mouth the caramel lays claim to most of the tongue, but as that dies away there is a huge pine hit behind it that leaves the tongue buzzing a bit. It's a medium body with a long, bitter finish, seemingly highly carbonated, but then these are made for the long haul and I'm drinking this one in its infancy. Overall, a good beer, but definitely not my favorite barleywine. I'd like to see how this ages because it might bring out some more of the fruit as the hops die down a bit.  EDIT - I've had several glasses of the 2008 vintage on draft during February 2012. It's shocking how much bitterness this can retain. It's not the hop monster it was fresh, but neither is it a sweet beer.  I also had the pleasure of having the 2008 vintage on cask. The nose was muted but the body was absolutely incredible.

140,2671,wvsabbath,4.35,"Serving Type - Bottle  Appearance - Tanish brown, some red tint, nice creamy thick 2 inch head, tons of lacing.  Smell - Malts, hops, barley, carmel, sugars, spices, some dark fruits like plum and rasin. A little cherry and lemon also.  Taste - Classic malty caramel at first sip, with a nice cherry and plum fruit flavor. Lots of sugars, mollasses, brown sugar and yeasts. Alcohol adds a warmth after each drink. Rasin and some added spices give this even more flavor.  Mouthfeel - Mouth and tounge is bittered from hops, sweeted slighty from malts, and numbed finally with the near 10% booze. A dry strong hoppy aftertaste finishs it out.  Overall - Excellent beer, balanced, flavorful, not overly sweet or bitter. The cherry flavor almost gives it a dubbel like feel. Its a little hoppier then most barleywines, so im interested in aging a few to see what this turns into. As it is fresh, a fine beer, good price and avability, a must try for the craft beer fan.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,HighCotton,3.95,"Pours nicely with a thick off-white/tan head. Leaves medium dusting. A copper color with a nice amount of unfiltered debris swirling about. Very solid carbonation out of the bottle. Smell is hoppy and piney. Honestly smells like an IPA or double IPA (a plus in my mind), but smell is a bit boozier than expected. Could really smell the alcohol once the head dissipated and it warmed a bit. Bitter in and down. Lingers on the back of the tongue, and as the hoppiness fades a nice, doughey malt finds life. A relatively thick mouthfeel for a beer this hoppy. The beer remains in your mouth for several swallows after a drink. The alcohol is there, but would've guessed it was 6.8-7.6% when it was in my mouth and initially swallowed, but the 9.6% makes itself known for a brief instant following the hop-stage aftertaste but is gone by the breadiness stage if not the malt stage. Aftertaste: hops-&gt;malts-&gt;breadiness. At the end of glass, the dusting reveals the level of each drink. A nice beer. It is a bit boozy. If I had the discipline to keep it for a while I would be interested to see how it mellows. I am always satisfied with sierra nevada's use of hops. This beer does nothing to lessen that, for sure.

I have a goal of doing a 10 year vertical evening. We'll see if they last. In general I prefer to European barleywines.  A - Dark ruby read, big frothy off white head. Carb is present immediately after pour, but is gone quickly. Thick webbed lacing  S - Mildly sweet fruity aromas. Hints of fresh pizza dough. Minimal hop bitter nose.  T - Big malty sweet dark fruit flavors are dominated by very forward hop bitterness. As expected for a fresh American barleywine. Dark toasted pumpernickel bread in the middle. Strong bitter hop finish with a hint of creaminess. The hops will mellow with time I imagine.  M - Medium bodied, mild carb, strong alcohol warmth in the finish.  O - This is a very good American barleywine. It's not a total booze bomb like some others, but it will take you for a ride.

Although I am a newbie, I must say that this beer packed a punch. High ABV (9.6) and a serious amount of hops made me stutter after the first sip. It seems that an American style Barleywine is pretty much an American IPA on super steroids. The malt was there but was definitely covered up by the waves of hops that are added to this beer during brewing. This beer could be good with food, but the high IBU count (90) would probably cover up your meal's flavor.  The brew pours with a nice dark/woody red tint and has a strong initial head. Strong hop and pine forest aroma. A thin white lace stays with the beer throughout drinking.  Sierra Nevada always does a nice job with their labels also. The Bigfoot ale being no exception.

Amazingly dry and lacking any real sweetness that the nose indicates it should be here. Finishes with a huge amount of dry bitterness.

This beer is beautiful in every way and is exactly what I'm looking for in the appearance of a beer.  Nose is incredibly fragrant, with a grapefruit punch followed by some caramel and pineapple. This is a fresh bottle, so that explains the DIPA aroma, but the malt definitely stands up for itself here with sugary caramel and toffee leading the charge.  Taste brings out a LOT more of the malt and DAMN is it heavenly - a barrage of burnt and roasted notes to go with luscious toffee and caramel, all while citrus and tropical fruit are exploding all over the place. Grapefruit and mango go incredibly well with the malt in all facets, as the roasted portions push the fruit to the background, while the sweeter sections bring it back to the fore, creating a candy-like taste. Booze is not noticeable at all until the end where it creates a bit of warmth, and the finish is sweet from the malt and bitter from the hops - a great combo, and a nice way to keep a beer this strongly flavored drinkable. A bit of bubblegum taste comes out as the beer warms too, adding yet another layer of depth.  Mouthfeel is full, heavy, and creamy at times, the way it should be.

140,2671,lionchow,2.76,"Pours an attractive, mildly hazy light amber with a thin white head.  Aroma is of a medicinal plasticy, alcohol with an herbal hoppiness.  Flavor is immediately unappealing. Alcohol and hops dominate and meld together in a not particularly enjoyable way. Hops are herbal, menthol, and very bitter. Malt is low to none, with a very slight caramel sweetness.  Mouthfeel is dry which, when combined with the hops and alcohol make it seem muddled.  Overall not enjoyable at all.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

S-Piney, grassy hops dominate the nose, with a thin line of rock candy sweetness.  T/M-Bracingly bitter and dry, with palate assaulting flavors of orange skin, dry leaves and pulped pine needles.The malt sweetness is barely perceptible beneath multiple layers of dry bitter hops and booze.

140,2671,beachscrat,3.8,"2011 Bigfoot  Cellar temp, bottle to pint tumbler.  Nice clingy head, better than most barley-wine. Deep amber, with near brilliant clarity.  I smell yeast byproduct at first pour, reminds me of bock yeast. Quickly turns into citrus candy and sweet malt.  Initial sip is bitter spruce tea, mixed with a bit of spearmint. Just a hint of sweetness but balance definitely leans toward bitter.  Year after year, it amazes me the quality of this barley-wine on such a grandiose scale.

140,2671,feylure,4.48,"Saw this at the store. Haven't been disappointed by Seirra Nevada yet!  Appearance is a slightly dark, clear amber.  Smell is a nice mix of sweet barley and hops. I didn't expect the hops, but I'm a IPA fan, so it's a pleasant surprise.  Taste is interesting and great. I saw barley wine, so I expected more of a sweet flavor. In reality, it's a great blend of spicy hops and sweetness. At first, sweetness hits with notes of sugar and caramel malt, then the hops hit and are amplified up nicely with the carbonation. The tail is a great, sharp hop flavor that lingers.  Mouthfeel is all around full.  I find this beer to be incredibly drinkable, but I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like IPAs or spicy food.

This beer is fairly clear showing just a slight amount of sediment. Leaves behind a good amount of lacing and the long lasting suds just holler freshness.  Smell: A faint aroma of pine and fruit from the hops, sort of disappointing. For me this is the area that could use the most improvement.  Taste: Big blast of bittering hops, much more pronounced in this version of the style. Blind folded I would have chosen this as a double ipa for sure. Flavor is sweet malt quickly followed by pine.  Mouthfeel: A medium feel with a whole lot of hop bitterness. Ends dry as you would expect.  Drinkability: Definitely a huge beer and one for someone who can appreciate hops. No overwhelming sweetness here. Could improve the balance with a little more malt or age which does mellow it out.

A beige one finger head sits On top the leathery brew for a hot minute before it turns into sporadic islands of wispy lace.  S- my first thoughts were citrus! Very grapefruit forward and then you start to get caramel covered hops. As the brew warms more of the sweet malts are appearing.  T- best way I can describe this is hoppy caramel covered toffee. Alcohol is present and makes the finish semi hot and boozy, I guess that is why it ages so well. Sweet and bitter at the same time really Nice.  M- semi thick so medium bodied. Spot on carbonation.

140,2671,GarthDanielson,4.03,"2011 batch. I've never had this brew, so I'm trying some fresh and planning to age the rest.  The beer pours a crystal clear amber-copper coloring that starts with a thin, dense, yellowish, half-inch foamy head that quickly disappears, leaving only a slight film across the top of the brew. The nose has a surprisingly strong undertone of hops which does a decent job to balance the caramel malty smells. The flavor is complex, and honestly feels like it changes as it swims through my mouth. Wow. The first thing I got was a blast of flavor, both hoppy and caramel sweet, but that went by quickly. The next thing I tasted was a littly boozey and a little peppery. The quickly transitioned to a smokey flavor so strong I thought my uvula had been set on fire. Subsequent drinks give similar kaleidescopic flavors, and I also start to pick up some slight sour notes and the steadiness of the hops bitter throughout the taste, although sometimes stronger than others. Very complex. Every once in a while I get a flash of some grapefruit type flavors, too...a little tart and a little sweet. All of these flavors ride a creamy and smooth body that transitions to crisp right at the end. The beer leaves a slightly bitter and puckered feel after swallow, and that feeling lingers a while along side the slightly sour and spiced aftertaste. This beer begs to be consumed. Shockingly easy to drink despite the slightly elevated ABV and the robust catalog of flavors. Now the test will be of my will power to keep from drinking the rest of this and actually age some of it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,NickMunford,3.38,"A: Pours a clear but dark amber/red color with a thin to moderate heat made up of larger bubbles. Has little head retention and only leaves a little lacing.  S: Hops are evident, along with a caramel malt aroma. The aroma seems pretty well balanced.  T: The flavor of this one brings my mind towards the discussion of how American barleywines are becoming more and more like DIPA's. This to me seems like a cross between a DIPA and a Imperial Red. Big hops flavor, with a mild caramel malt as an afterthought.  M: Mild smooth mouthfeel with decent carbonation. Leaves a lot of bitterness in the aftertaste.  D: Average drinkablility. Hopefully after aging this will mellow out and become more balanced.  This is the first beer that I'm really hoping to age. I bought a 6er. Put two in the fridge to drink, and hope to save 4 and have another two in a year and 2 in two years.

T - Starts off with a mix of sweet roasted malt flavor and some citrus hops. There is also a touch of the dark fruit flavor in the background that comes through.

S - Equal amounts of stone fruit/slightly sweet malt and bitter, earthy hops. A second whiff brings out a piney, slightly floral hops aroma.  T - The balance from the nose continues. Plums, slightly tart berries, and sweet fresh-baked bread tango with green, citrusy hops. Finish is sticky hops resin, not as sweet as the front end, and a little dry. The hopping brings to mind a big DIPA, but the complex malt bill identifies this as a textbook barleywine.  M and D - Oily, medium to thick body, moderate carbonation.

Unbalanced, definitely the hoppyest version of the style I have tried.  mouthfeel; creamy with a heavy finish. Somewhat thick.

An off-white cap sits on top and slowly begins to recede leaving some respectable lacing.  S-Deep sugary maltiness and some pretty well defined hops. Piney and grassy hoppiness. Definately smells a bit woody. Rich caramel is present too. A decent whiff of booze is detected but it isn't a detractor.  T-Resinous and piney hops along with a large dose of malt sweetness. The hop profile is powerful and complex. The beer is strong yet well balanced. A bit grainy and bready too. Alcohol adds depth and is not too bold.  M-Fuller bodied. Not overly carbonated. Slick and resinous as well.  D-Like all Sierra Nevada brews, this one is more drinkable than it probably should be. Very bold, but very delicious. Gonna age a few see how those treat me next year. --- (3/4/12)Review of the 2010 bottle side-by side with the 2012.  2010 A-Pours dark amber. Large beige head. Indistinguishable from the 2012.  S-Very sweet and well blended. Hops have faded. Aroma is much less coarse. Still very aromatic and deep. Ultra-rich caramel. Slight but still noticeable hop bitterness. Smells hot.  T-Wow. The flavors have meshed so well together. Less resinous than the 2012. I miss the super-oily hop presence found in the 2012, but overall, I think I enjoy the 2010's overall flavor better. So incredibly smooth.  M-Less resinous. Carbonation is a bit faded but it adds to the rich velvety feel. Still pretty bitter.  O/D-Overall, the 2 years of age has molded this brew into a balanced, smooth, rich and creamy brew. Much different than the fresh one. Hard to say which I enjoy more. ---- 2012 A-Indistinguishable from the 2012.  S-Much, much hoppier. Resinous hops. Aromatic bitterness. Sweetness only attempts to balance out the sappy pine oils. My preferred aroma.  T-Pine and citrus. Booze is evident. Rich malt. Much hoppier of course. I forgot how hoppy this barleywine is when imbibed fresh.  M-More resinous than the 2010 but less sugary richness and creaminess. More carbonation too. Partial to the 2010's feel.  O/D- Amazing what the age will do to this beer. I love the hops here and the bitterness. Tough to say who wins.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

I couldn't pick out any specific fruits. There is some piney hops aroma as well.  Taste starts out as grainy and malty, but them the 90 IBUs kick in with some intense but not overpowering hops bitterness which rounds out the taste. This was a complex tasting beer with a depth of substance that I wasn't expecting.  The mouthfeel is thick and chewy, well carbonated and very, very pleasing. As for drinkability, it's pretty good.

140,2671,stonermouse,4.21,"2010 vintage. Bought a single at Vinnin Square in Swampscott, MA last week- this aged at the package store, presumably in the back.  Poured into a Sam Adams glass.  Pours a nice copper color, same throughout, with a fair amount of cloudiness. The head is super thick and dense. I had to slow down and sip a bit before finishing the pour.  Smells a bit spicy, with lightly-fruited malts. Warm booze hits the nose, but it's not overpowering.  The flavor is potent and complex. Granted, this is not my favorite style, but I can certainly appreciate what's happening here. The hops have faded, with only a bit of a dry, sticky aftertaste remaining. The flavor now is nearly-rotted fruit (in the good barleywine way), and has a solid boozy, rye-like bite. It's pretty sweet as well; combined with the spiciness and dense flavor, it's almost like a modern mince pie flavor palette.  Mouthfeel is nice. Solid, dense body with a dry finish.  Drinkability is great here. I'd love to sit with a couple of these in a night. Better yet, I'd love to do a 3 or 4-year vertical, with a chance to have a freshie that still has some hop flavor.

If I were rating as a double IPA, this is way to dark, and as a barley wine, it is way to light. Definitely should have waited or something.

140,2671,portia99,4.13,"12oz bottle (2011 vintage - bottled 1/20/11) poured into a Brooklyn snifter.  A - Pours a super clear ruby tinted dark amber. A finger of dense and foamy head forms and lingers for several minutes eventually leavings behind some sticky lacing on the glass. Pretty impressive for a 9.6% beer.  S - Lots of fruity esters up front, some alcohol, pungent citrusy and grassy hops. Some nice caramelly and lightly sugary malt and a bit of hoppy spiciness too.  T - Full hoppy bitterness up front - grassy mainly, a bit spicy too. Malt is full and rich - caramel, brown sugar, sweet - but still falls behind the hops in the balance. The slightest hint of booziness. Fruity and somewhat estery. This bottle doesn't seem as hop forward as I remember in previous vintages when fresh. Still very good, but seems like it isn't up to previous years (at least in my mind).  M - Only medium in body...probably technically a bit thin for a barley wine. Carbonation is medium as well. Hop bitterness can be found from start to finish and carries this beer. There is enough complexity from the malt in the way of esters, and various sugary sweet flavors tho.  D - I love this barley wine, especially when fresh. Some beers in this style are overpoweringly sweet in their balance, which is good in small and slow doses, but really hurt drinkability for me. This is crisp, bitter and pretty cleanly fermented making a bottle of this disappear quickly...too quickly most times.

Translucent. Poured to a two to three finger creamy, beige colored head. The head lasted a good five minutes until settling to a half finger to thinnish head during the sampling. Carbonation bubbles rise from the laser etching on the bottom of the DFH glass through most of the tasting. Great lacing left on the sides of the glass after drinking.  S - Great combination of grapefruit, hops and caramel-like sweetness.  T - Fantastic taste. Very reminiscent of a high-quality IPA with a mix of grapefruit & hops dominating the flavors with a great malty, sweet backbone. The alcohol is noticeable and although not overwhelming, does show up during each sip.  M - A rather heavy beer. Not overly carbonated but there is a slight bite to the palette after each sip.  D - This is a great beer. At over 9% ABV, the beer doesn't lend itself to drinking quickly nor does it lend itself to having more than one or two at a sitting due to it's heaviness. However, the beer is simply delicious and they do go down rather easy.  Overall: My first experience with a Barleywine and I think I picked a good one to try for my first.

M- This is a full bodied ale with somewhat of a slick mouthfeel. I get some carbonation on the tongue ass well.  D- Extremely good sipping beer. Nice warming one a night drinker for me.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Bonis,4.15,"A - Dark amber with lots of sticky foam. Great lacing. Looks like a superb beer.  S - Not what I anticipated. Lots and lots of booze along with some sweet malt characteristics. Either my nose is off or I get very little hops. The hops I do smell are only a tad floral. Not gonna lie, I get notes of barf in this one for some reason.  T - As much as I wanted to throw this one away after smelling it, I took one drink and it was amazing. A huge beer, malty and bready and hoppy and piney and fruity at the same time. The finish is bitter and dry but sticks around for the right amount of time. Just extremely complex and well balanced at the same time. I feel like it's a bit hoppy for the style, but it works for me overall.  M - An extremely thick full bodied beer. Carbonation is high, booze is noticeable and warming, but not too much.  D - Good for what it is. I wouldn't want to drink more than 3 in a night, but it is nearly 10% abv in the end.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The estery alcohol bite that ensues is quite pungent. Finishes with sticky sweet molasses and toasty malt.  M- Smooth and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. The hop bitterness becomes less intense with each sip. Still very strong, however.  D- At 9.6% abv this drinks like a dream.

The taste is fantastic, hops, malt, sweetness w/ a little floral mixed in as well. This is a great tasting beer! I imagine this one would age pretty well too, I just don't know if I'll be able to keep my hands off of them long enough to let that happen. Mouthfeel is nice, very smooth, but the hops take over on the aftertaste- and it lasts forever. Drinkability is great, but at 9.6% ABV, a couple is all you'll need.

Dark reddish-copper color with a thick yellowish beige head.  Sweet malts and lots of citrusy grapefruity west coast hops on the aroma.  Starts off with big-time fruity hops and sweet malts, and finishes with warmth, bitterness, and a slight alcohol kick.  Very full-bodied and makes you feel the 9.6% ABV.  This is a really solid west coast barleywine that is not for jokers. Not recommended for beirut or flippy cup.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,zoso1967,4.08,"2011 Bigfoot pours a stunning ruby tinged deep amber. It is surprisingly clear as I watch the bubbles trail up to the light tan head. The foam lingers on top of the liquid almost indefinitely and it leaves sheaths of lace on the sides of the glass.  The aroma is a wondrous blend of sweet malts, citrusy hops and a slight earthy pepperyness. The malt seems to be predominantly caramel like with some toffee and is given a slight fruitiness by the citrusy hops.  The fruity character of this beer is even more evident as I take the first sip. The hops are definitely present in the flavor and lend a significant amount of bitterness. Caramel, toffee and cherry flavors dance on my tongue along with grapefruit and dried apricot. The bitter end of the flavor is pretty harsh, but it also keeps things from getting too sweet. In fact, the closer I get to the end of this glass, the more I wish it was a bit sweeter.  The mouthfeel is on the fuller side of medium with a smooth quality to it. It must be noted that the smoothness disappears in the finish which is very bitter. It leaves some hoppy flavors on my tongue after swallowing.  I would say that this is a decently drinkable barleywine due to the dryness, but it is not exactly my favorite. Whilst I am all about the nice hoppy character and how it accentuates the malt, this is just a bit too bitter for me in comparison to style. Still, this is a well crafted beer and one that I will make it a point to pick up a bottle of every year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Smell is caramel malts, a little bit of roast, citrus and pine are in there.  Taste is of caramel, citrus and pine, and alcohol on the end. Leaves a warming feeling throughout the body.  Mouthfeel is full and nicely carbonated.  Drinkability is good, alcohol is a little too much at this point.  For a barleywine, this is very fresh. Needs a few months and I'm interested in doing a vertical very soon.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,sjverla,4.2,"Nose: Raisins and molasses. Alcohol tartness. Big, earthy (and spicy) hops. It smells massive.  Appearance: A vigorous pour kicks up about an inch of off-white head that sticks like crazy. Deep ruby-amber almost the color of maple syrup shines clearly.  Taste: Big and aggressive. Dark malts and fistfuls of hops. Ends hot and makes you squint. Incredibly complex. Initial taste of golden raisin is quickly pummeled away under bitter and herbal hop gardens. Chewy and satisfying.  Overall: Aptly named. This beer is a beast.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Citrus-dominated aroma with biscuit and caramel notes underneath.  Moderate carbonation and a full, ulta-creamy mouthfeel. Again, big blast of grapefruit and pine up front followed by toasty toffee sweetness, a little bit of dark fruit, and an even more astringent pine bitterness on the finish.  Alcohol was well-masked and this was an easy-drinkin' pleasure to consume fresh. Good balance between the sweeter elements and that biting, hoppy finish. So far I can only compare this bottle to one with a year of age, and the biggest difference I noticed was the presence of the hops up front, whereas the 2010 bottle had an initial toffee/vanilla/woody sweetness before the bitterness took over.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Getting a lot of the same potpourri that I got in the scent, as well as some very piney hops. Alcohol is very noticeable.  Mouthfeel is medium with high carbonation.  Drinkability is low.

In its first taste is a noticable spicyness that has a finishing flavor of hoppy bitter bliss. Its remarkeble given it's almost 10% ABV there is no noticeable burn (which is interesting in a beer like this, the ones in the 20 range that don't burn are frightening).

140,2671,AleWatcher,4.06,"This beer was opened and tasted without any knowledge of what it was-- as per the Blind Beers BIF...  Ok-- first blind beer from Nlmartin. Thanks man! Poured into New Belgium Globe glass  Poured from a stubby little founders-like bottle... Immediately I'm thinking Nackwoods Bastard. A rustic, murky, muddy red. Very small head. Very little lacing. The aroma of booziness is wafting up-- I'm definitely thinking this was barrel aged...  This smells so familiar. I swear I've had this before. There is a big sweetness-- burnt sugar, caramel, raisins?, boozy sweetness that reminds me of red wine?, toffee... Wow, a complex bouquet with tons going on...  The taste has some of everything i got in the nose plus sweetness and a port/sherry quality. There is a ruby red grapefruit bite towards the finish. Just a hint of something I can't quite put my finger on, perhaps... Wet paper? If it is, it is a VERY slight hint of oxidation...  This must be a Barleywine... And a good one at that. Judging by the bottle, I'm guessing this is a Bigfoot... But it isn't fresh. It must be aged. Just miraculously good. I have this in my snifter and I am enjoying it quite a bit as I watch ""Taken"" on HBO.  The body is slightly less carbonated than I like, but it isn't unpleasant-- it sips like a brandy.  --reveals bottle to be 2006 Bigfoot! Very nice! I don't know why, but I could only think Founders the whole way... At least until I was sure it was a barleywine!

M - Full bodied and active, yet smooth carbonation.  D - Very drinkable and enjoyable, I can't wait to see what a few years of age does to this to really balance it out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,JimLetson,3.81,"Appearance - I love the colour of this beer. The red copper sits underneath a billowy, delicate off-white head. Two fingers thick, it recedes fairly quickly, leaving lacing in rings.  Smell - a combination of wine smells, malt sweetness, and a fairly strong piny resinous odour. The alcohol comes through in a good whiff, too.  Taste - the very first thing is caramel. Not a caramel-like taste, but as if I had just put a chewy caramel on the tip of my tongue. That moves quickly into a roasty bitterness, but this is overdone, and it goes from there to a burnt taste as I swish it around a bit. The hops come on strong with the burn, and linger long after the mouthful is gone. The alcohol doesn't come through as strongly as I thought it would, but the burnt taste is off-putting, and not quite what I expected. There's some sweetness, too, but again, it isn't as pronounced as I expected it would be. It's mainly hops and the burnt taste, though the latter does fade a bit as you continue to drink it.  Mouthfeel - there is a lot of bubble to this beer. The prickly feel lends itself strongly to the burnt and pine flavours, and I think that it would seem like a rounder beer if it were dialed down a little. There's not a real drying out of the mouth while you drink it, but it doesn't coat the tongue and cheeks, either. From that perspective, it finds a good middle ground. Medium body.  Drinkability - not bad. I could have another one. The fact that my mouth doesn't feel coated with it after the swallow is nice.  The hops are overwhelming, at this point, but I think it has potential if you let it sit a while. It's probably a good one to hold onto and drink in a year or two.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,CHADMC3,4.23,"Pours a very rich copper to walnut with reddish hues beneath the dense off white head that hangs around for some time before giving way to a thin, but sticky lacing.  The aroma is massive and consists of sweet vinous aromas traditional to a barleywine, although they are secondary, floral or pine hops, and sweet malt.  Hops jump to the front of the palate, again they are woody and piney similar to the aroma. There is also some barley and malt sweetness, although not quite to the degree that the aroma hinted. There may even be some floral hops in here as well, and the hops are certainly the highlight.  This Barleywine offers generous carbonation and a thicker mouthfeel with a hop presence that has a bit of a bite.  This is a fine example of the American Barleywine.

Smells is a pretty dense bouquet of thick, sweet pine and citrus hops and some alcohol.  Taste is dense--very hoppy, and almost like a DIPA if there weren't so much caramel malt behind it. The malt flavor hits first, sweet and smooth, but then it's a big kick of hops the rest of the way. The finish is long and bitter. Alcohol is pretty decently hidden for the ABV. I'm very curious how this will taste a year or three from now.  Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, but what you'd expect from a beer like this.

140,2671,Smakawhat,3.7,"Poured into a snifter vintage 2011.  Pours gold from the bottle giving a nice cream colored head. Lots of leg action and stickiness with pocked marks. Head is very resilient with staying power. Burnt orange to very dark amber body in appearance, but seems a little hazy also.  The first thing I got off the bouquet was strangely supermarket red grapes.. citrus faintness but with hop character. Interesting. Some fresh cut lawn grass sense as well. Some little tight visible carbonation from the bottom of the glass.  Hop character and bitterness shows through in a tolerable way, but missing hinted at fruit character off nose in the taste. Alcohol is masked a little, with double imperial American pale ale feel. Strange grassy feel (literally lawn cut grass) to this that doesn't translate into lingering aftertastes. Fairly alright but sort of a letdown. Palate seems to be focused on the front for me than the entire region tasting this beer.  Does this need to age perhaps? Well can't say, I don't have a time machine. Tolerable drink.

140,2671,rijanyoung,3.93,"Drinking the 2011 Bigfoot Barley Wine  A: This beer pours dark red with a thick head. A very appropriate color for this beer style.  S: I get a toasty aroma from this beer, I smell some hops from this beer. It is a 2011 so that is not at all uprising. I also get some dried fruit (prune) form the smell.  T: Caramel, burnt sugar and some dried raisin flavors accompanied by some dried fruit and toffee. It has a toasty backbone. I am a bit disappointed with the hops of this beer, very one dimensional in my opinion. The hop bitterness is very forward, would like to see how this beer matures with some time on it. I think the hops would blend nicely.  M: It has a nice mouth feel, carbonation is not bad but I would have done less, the body is medium.  D: It is a very drinkable beer giving its age. It is still very obvious that it is a young barley wine and with some time I think this beer will benefit greatly and increased drinkability will be observed.  Over all this is a tasty beer.

140,2671,BirdsandHops,3.53,"Doing a tasting of a 2010 and 2011 bottle side by side. The overall score will go to the better of the two:  A: Both pour a dark burgundy-brown with about two fingers of beige head. Both are quite clear, though the 2010 is slightly hazier. The head recedes into a ring with some decent lacing.  S: The 2010 smells of lots of sticky sweet caramel malts up front followed by a light piny hop aroma with some alcohol notes. The 2011 is similar, but the malt is much more toned down and the hops much more pronounced. Caramel malt up front followed by a big blast of piny hops.  T: The 2010's flavors start out with lots of sticky sweet malt up front, but the hops are still packing a punch even after a year. There's a good kick of piny hops and a bitterness that coats your mouth with the heavy malt bill. There's still a noticeable alcohol burn to the beer as well. The 2011 has a bit of the sweet malt in the flavor up front, but the hops follow closely behind and wipe out any memory of the malt. Lots of resiny pine flavors with a slight alcohol burn and the aftertaste is very bitter.  M: The 2010 has a thick body with light-medium carbonation, this beer has an oily feel to it that coats your mouth long after the last sip. The 2011 has a lighter body again with light-medium carbonation. The oily feel is still there, but the finish is much lighter. The bitterness hangs around for much longer, though.  D: The 2010 is fairly drinkable considering how big a beer it is, but the coating it leaves in my mouth almost numbs my palate. The 2011 has a lighter body and doesn't seem to coat my mouth with malt as much, so it goes down slightly more easily.  Overall, I think I prefer the 2010. The fresh 2011 is a bit one-dimensional as a huge hop bomb that leaves a bitterness in my mouth that doesn't seem to ever go away. The 2010 has a nicer balance between the malt and hops, though the thick body and combination of sticky malt and bitter hops leave me wanting to brush my teeth afterward.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

As the beer progresses there is a strong hop presence that lingers, maybe even a bit too long.  M - I'm torn here, I loved the creamy malty goodness up front, the hops were a little too fresh and bitter for me and they lingered a bit long.

S-mmm this isn't what i expected. i've had some barley wines but so far, this is the hoppiest i've smelled yet, and it is much to my liking. it smells like good robust hops and some barley. The more i smell it, the more caramel undertones i can pick up. its a fairly strong scent. definitely a nice scent of vanilla  T-it comes in with strong and possibly over-sweetened caramel and then transforms in to an extreme bitterness. I mean this is a mouth puckering, head turning bitterness. the after-taste is of caramel and hops, it sorta reminds me of syrup. this is quite unlike any barley wine i've had. it seems to be somewhere between a barley wine and double IPA. It is sort of a let down from what i was expecting.  M-has an okay creamy, medium carbonation with a very bitter finish.  D-the more i drink this, i think the more i begin to understand it. at first the tastes seem to be over bearing, but they eventually fade out and the bitterness is whats left. although i'm not a huge fan of the taste, the more i drink this, the more i seem to want another one and think that i could possible have a few of these in night...this might be the type of beer that grows on you.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Alas I am content to call it merely a big, complex, dark amber barleywine. I'm a big fan of Barleywines, and this, though in some ways unexpected, is very satisfying. As mentioned above, this knocks me back with piney. slightly woody hop bitterness. I would not call this a balanced beer, but there is a caramelly, malty sweetness to the backside that adds to the complexity and satisfaction. The look and smell of this beer is great. A bit fruity mixed with alcohol, and a great cark copper tone with a big fizzy head that dies off to a thin lacey layer.

The nose brings scents of pine/resinous hops with a sweet malty backbone. The alcohol is well hidden here. The taste is bold a rich. The bitter hop taste is still present very much so in this 2010 batch. The sweet malts are nicely blended with the hops to create an untamed beast of a brew.

The drinkability is pretty good due to a well hidden ABV and a good blend of flavors.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,DovaliHops,4.12,"One of my favorite go-to barleywines! 2011 Vintage. Pours a very hazy reddish amber color with a somewhat large brownish white head that disappears eventually. Scent is HOPPY! Tons of piney notes and very little malt. It literally smells like a pine tree. Taste is where the hops and malts mesh a bit more, although it remains predominantly hop forward. Tons of pine flavors with some very sweet candied malt flavors. Finish has just a tad bit of alcohol with bittering hop finish. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, but refreshing and full bodied. Drinkability is high, as I find it to be one of the more drinkable barleywines. I could probably drink about 3 of these in one sitting. Overall, I love this beer...for the price of a six pack(9.99 at local grocery store), it cannot be beat. I've had this beer with a couple years on it though, and I prefer the older vintage. I think this is a beer that ages VERY well, and although delicious fresh, I'd take it aged any day.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,thatsfine,4.2,"My first Bigfoot of all time. 2011 vintage poured from the bottle into my Russian River glass.  A dark copper, amber color. A moderate pour gives a pretty weak head but a stronger pour gives a small head that leaves lacing down the entire glass.  The piney hops are definitely there but the sweet malts are also much more pronounced than I thought they would be. It smells very nice.  Most of what I have read about this is that it is a hop bomb (which is right). What I did not expect is how much of a malt backbone I would taste. The malts backing up the hops on this brew are incredibly sweet and delicious. This is awesome. Other BW's I have had were much less balanced than this, even so young. Well done.  Medium bodied Barleywine and very smooth.  As a Barleywine goes, this is up there with the best I have had (many of which have not been posted yet). Drinks as easy as the style can in my humble opinion. I would go on about this forever but I need to go buy a case...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,thagr81us,4.17,"2011 Vintage! Served from tap into an imperial pint. Poured red-orange with a one and a half finger off-white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine resin, big pine hops, and subtle alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, big pine, big pine hops, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. I know this one gets hyped up a lot about older vintages and such, and now I can see why... Even fresh this brew is excellent. I can see it really coming to life after a few years. For right now the alcohol was a bit intrusive on the palate during the followthrough. If you like pine notes, this is for you fresh. The pine aspect in this one was HUGE. A definite must try, aged or fresh, for sure.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,gabedivision,3.9,"(2011) Poured from a 12oz bottle to a snifter glass.  A- Deep reddish plum with a thick white two finger head that sticks and slimes to the sides of the glass.  S- Smells of nice citrus hops, malts and alcohol. There are alot of scents going on in this glass, no of which are offensive but very complex and hard to pick out whats going on. All works together great.  T- Roasted caramel, bitter bitter hops, and sweet sweet malts.  M- Nice full bodied, bitter lips and tongue on the end.  D- Nice drinkability for 1 or 2 for my tastes, firmly enjoyed this beer. Cannot wait to try this batch in a year from now.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,mcgwire756,4.32,"2008 vintage poured into a Sierra Nevada 30th Anniversary tulip.  So let me preface this by saying I highly recommend this beer with at least 2 years of age on it. I have had it super fresh and it was way too harsh. This review is based on one 3 years old now.  It pours a deep dark red color with a fluffy 1 finger white head that does not disappear for a long time. The smell with age on it is so perfect with the smell of sweet candy and sugar. Simply perfect. The taste is a little maltier than the smell with more molasses but still a ton of candy sugar in the taste. God this beer is delicious. The mouthfeel is so much smoother than a young Bigfoot, but still not a super smooth Barleywine like a 2010 Nemesis is. It is drinkable, but in slow sips so that you enjoy it and don't overpower your palate. My 2nd favorite barleywine next to 2010 Nemesis that I have had. I am looking forward to trying 3 Floyds Behometh and seeing how it compares to my top 2 thus far.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,larsenju,3.05,"2011 Vintage, poured at about 60 degrees.  A-Reddish amber body with a very tall off white head, decent retention but little lacing.  S-Alcohol, some floral/fruity hops with a strong caramel malty backbone. The alcohol really takes away from the rest of the beer.  T-Very smooth caramel right when it hits picking up some lemon, and from there the hops really start to move forward leaving a pine/citrus resin flavor that comes to a point and leaves a very bitter finish. There is kind of a caramel and chocolate undertone, but the hops dominate.  M-So hot it almost stings a little bit, sugary slick with a little tingling carbonation.  D-I recently had an 09 vintage of this beer, it really needs a little age on it. Even the 09 wasn't as good as it could be, but it just is not ready to drink when fresh. Its just to hoppy and hot and the malt character is a little boring, but it develops very nicely in the bottle. That said, its certainly not what I would call a bad beer fresh, its just no where near its potential. I will re-review when I crack one of the 2010 in my cellar in a year or two.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,julian,3.51,"Had this many times, finally getting around to reviewing it.  A: Nice crimson amber color, great clarity, head a bit weak but with a modified more aggressive pour it comes to life and sticks around, leaving a nice layer of thick off white head on the surface. Very nice lacing all around the glass.  S: heavy malt, nice hop backbone, some fruity hop aromas, almost DIPA/IIPA like but enough malt to push this back into the barley wine realm.  T: BAM! bitterness hits you right in the face, then coats your tongue with it's hoppy/resiny blanket of love and slowly yields way to some hidden malty goodness. Not as complex as other barley wines and not my favorite but still representative of the style.  M: Medium high carbonation. Slightly bitter aftertaste, but otherwise, good mouthfeel.  D: ABV will limit drinkability, taste is just above average. Average drinkability.  Note: I need to definitely try some of this aged. I'm wondering how my 1998 bottle is holding up. I should probably crack it soon.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Zundo,4.33,"Appearance: A hazy amber with some copper. one-finger tan head with great lacing...thick foam.  Smell: Very piny and citrusy. Particularly lemon and some grapefruit. Really smells like a DIPA.  Taste: At first I get a sweet lemon flavor with pine, then comes the barley and grapefruit. Has a caramel/ faint toffee malt. Maybe some rye in there too. The flavor really grows on you. Its good to drink this both cold and room temp...you get more out of it IMO.  Feel: Its a bit too carbonated for a barleywine, but the sticky, oily remains make up for it.  Drink: This is probably the easiest drinking Barleywine I have had. Its much more on par with a DIPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

It pours nice with a big head and good lacing. The smell is of malt, hops, and alcohol.  Not an excellent Barleywine, but a solid beer to sip on every year about this time. I had a 2010 that was 9 months old and thought is was a better beer than a fresh 2011.  I really like that Sierra Nevada releases this every year.

140,2671,jsdunlop,4.01,"Pours out a monstrous, fluffy, cloudlike head that sits on top of a light-amber colored brew. Insane retention and lacing on this one. Smells of hops. pine, citrus, grapefruit, pineapple with some floral aroma mixed in there. The taste starts out with resiny pine, followed by a heaping amount of malt sweetness, giving this beer one hell of a body to start out with. While the hops dominate on the taste, the malts bring about caramel and brown sugar notes to the table. Alcohol makes its presence after the initial barrage of pine, letting you know that this brew is serious. Citrus and pineapple notes blend together at random points throughout the sip, mingling with the booze and sweetness nicely. Pretty serious alcohol burn on the back of the throat with this one. Mouthfeel is heavy and syrupy. Slick feeling after each sip, resiny hops make their presence known. Carbonation is minimal, allowing you to take in the full flavor of this one.

140,2671,Miketwolf21,4.18,"2011 bottle...In the world of ever increasing double IPA's its nice to see a 10 buck a six pack everyday barleywine, defeat the likes of Hopslam without hesitation. The pour gave a more than generous sandy colored head. The smell is all candied hops. Nice mix of american hops, some piney, some grapefruit, some tangerine, with a nice peppery note it seems that hides the alcohol. Malts take the backseat here. The taste is were the malts make their quick but distinguished appearance. Upfront you are greeted by a wallop of hops. These hops however know when they have extended their stay and quickly fade to a very velvety malt base. Complex with tastes of rye and even a touch of toffee are amid the voluminous and delicious malts. Fig sweetness with a touch of dried dates. This welcome relief midway through the mouth is met with a bitter ending. The hops once again take a narrow lead in the aftertaste. Thankfully narrow. This is a very balanced brew. I know this is the cliche barleywine but it constantly surprises me. The 2009 tastes more lemony and of over ripe strawberries, not that great of a mix, while the 2010 version tastes distinctly of tangerines, raspberries, and apricots. This 2011 version seems to have a more intense malt base. Mouthfeel is excellent, no extreme syrup body here. Just a brew that makes you proud of American breweries. I highly enjoy a beer that evolves on its way to the back of your throat, and this beer has some of the best transitions out of any sixer-barlywine. This is right on par with Third Coast, just hoppier. I think as a fresh brew this is better than a fresh Old Foghorn, but that really really really should be aged (2008 is drinking brilliantly right now). It destroys Old Horizontal and brown shugga. The definition of American Barelywine. Every year gives you a different story of the same thing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,weizenbob,4.28,"Picked up at Ladd's & Co in Muskegon. Bottled 1/12/11. Poured into a goblet. The pour yields an awesome 3 finger foamy off-white head with fantastic retention. Spotty lacing is touch and go down the glass. The brew is darkly walnut colored but not too dark to see some yeast hanging out in suspension.  The nose is indicating malt-bomb. Caramel hints are short and sweet bleeding into a strong black licorice aroma. The tail end is alcoholic.  The flavor follows the aroma. The malts are earthy without being dirty or gritty. There's more caramel and licorice in the mouth. This is a pretty fresh bottle and the 9.6% ABV is still pretty hot, but not overwhelmingly so. It does tickle the nose hairs upon exhaling as the alcohol lines the throat. Hoppy bitterness manifests in the finish, reminding me that this brew weighs in at a healthy 90 IBUs. It's a testament to the massive malt base of this barleywine that the bitterness is so restrained until the finish, especially for such a fresh bottle.  In the mouth, this brew is heavy-bodied. It's thick and boozy, but the alcohol aids in the wonderfully smooth quality as this brew travels down the hatch. Yes, it has a high alcohol content, and yes, it does have a fairly high IBU count. Still, the potential harshness is kept to a minimum. As such this is as drinkable a barleywine as they come. Of course a couple of these in succession could knock you off your barstool, but finishing off this bottle is no problem. I picked up a 6-pack and very much look forward to seeing what a year in the cellar will do to this beer.  ---  The Two-Schlitz Scale: (see my profile for an explanation) I give a Schlitz for Bigfoot.

M: Medium-full body, lively carbonation, and creamy & smooth texture.  D: I thought this was really good. My husband who hates barleywines, however, really enjoyed this one.

Grassy, grapefruit and herbal aromas burst from the glass. There no need to stick my nose into the glass, I can get it all from several feet away. Fantastic.  The taste of Bigfoot is everything that I want in an American Barleywine. Strong bitterness with a great malt backbone that supports the flavor, bitterness and aroma of the huge hop presence. Wonderful hop flavors mingle with a clean malty body. Deep caramel malts that really are well rounded and not sharply sweet.  Mouthfeel is full, but the carbonation does a nice job of keeping the palate scrubbed and not letting big foot get too heavy in the mouth.

That's not to say you can't taste the malty fruitiness that couples amazingly with the alcohol esters.  As expected, the mouthfeel is thick (as the bros say, chewy). It really enhances the taste of this beer if you literally try to chew it.  I am not a barleywine kind of fella, in fact I don't recall liking SN's 2009 effort.

140,2671,Berticus,4.4,"Don't get me wrong, this is an AWESOME beer but it tastes more like an american strong ale than a barleywine. SO much hops and there isnt really that distinct sweetness that comes with most barley wines. Overall it's very drinkable but if you are looking for a real barley wine, dont look here unless you're planning on aging this one for at least a year to let the hops mellow out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

S-Malt, slight hops, alcohol, and fruit take up the majority of the nose.  T-The alcohol is a bit overwhelming in this one, even though I know it is a high abv beer, it seems to be even more, port-esque in alcohol level. Barley, fruit and slight hop wrap up the rest of the taste, which really is complex, just unfortunately a little masked in the alcohol presence.  M-Full bodied with excellent carbonation.

Lots of lacing.  Smell is citrus, hops, and just a hint of grapefruit. Not as strong as I expected.  Taste is creamy-smooth up front, and then bam, bitter hops hits me right in the mouth, with a bitter grapefruit finish. The bitter finish lingers for some time.  Mouthfeel is creamy smooth up front, dry finish, with some carbonation.  This is my intro to this style, so, not sure what to think? I like it, but not sure I like it more than SN Celebration.

I stirred up the last bit and dumped it in as well so there are some floaties kicking around. Solid 2 finger eggshell head that dissipates to a coating that leaves brilliant lacing down the glass.  S - Piney, grassy and earthy hops are fresh and to the front. Toffee notes follow.  T - Caramel and toffee are sweet up front, bitterness really sets in and doesn't let up. Some citrus after the malt with a smokey finish that has a hint of tobacco.  M - Quite carbonated and a medium on the closer side of heavy body. The dry finish combined with the bitterness leaves you wanting another sip.

This amber-red beer has a head of about half an inch that lasts for a little while. The smell is mostly hops, but also sweet and boozy. This is one of the hoppier barleywines I have had. The taste is hops up front, giving way to a bittersweet, boozy flavor that I particularly enjoy. This beer has good carbonation, light in the mouth, and somewhat refreshing.

140,2671,Leftfield00,3.88,"This is a brew that I've been waiting for all year. Last year it seemed that I just barely missed the boat for the Bigfoot, so this had better be awesome.  - Pours out a nice dark amber color, with great foam, just a little yellowy-shade of off-white. The foam fades medium quickly, without distinct lacing, but great stickyness to the glass.  - Aromas are full of subtle malts, dark hops, and a little bit of alcohol. I almost hate to say it, but it's reminding me a little of another strong, amber color beer that I love to hate.  - Mouthfeel is much stronger hops than I expected. I mean, I'm not sure really what I was thinking, it is a Sierra Nevada. I guess I was expecting something more like the Dogfish Olde School. Full bodied, yet really well balanced. Subdued malts with caramel and butterscotch notes compliment the drying hops perfectly.  - Overall I think the Bigfoot is a solid brew. Not my personal cup-o'tea though. I'm still not a fan of beers that make me more thirsty. It reminds me a lot of a better version of the Arrogant Bastard.

I can sense just a little bit of grapefruit shining through in the back end. Great, rich smell  T - Almost a little sweet as it first hits the tongue. Fades into a blast of hops. Seriously, it feels like the hops just come out of nowhere. Nice, deep, earthy taste. Just a bit of burn from the alcohol on the end.  M - Very thick, almost syrupy on the first draw.

140,2671,siradmiralnelson,4.5,Review of fresh 2011 Bigfoot. Poured from 12oz bottle into Tulip.  A. Poured a big 3 finger head. Thick massive bubbles. Thick lacing left on side of glass. Great retention.  S. Smell is a big blast of hops and malt. I had forgotten how hoppy fresh Bigfoot could be. Caramel malt lies beneath all of the piney hops. Fresh the is a hoppy smelling barleywine.  T. Taste is a nice combination of hop and malt. Probably more malt forward even when fresh. Caramel malt sweetness balances out some piney hop bitterness.  M. Medium/full bodied. Full carbonation. Just a bit of lingering sweetness.  D. Very drinkable. I really like the contrast in flavor that Bigfoot can produce from when it is fresh to its aged version. Fresh it has a ton of hop smell and flavor that I really like. With a year or more on it Bigfoot has some amazing malt flavors.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,rwf08,4.5,Fresh 2011 Bigfoot  Nice dense pancake batter head with good lacing and dark mahogany color.  Full citrus and pine hops with a sweet malt back. Would have to wait a few years for the hops to die down to get other smells but the hops are amazing.  Loads of bitter hops and sweet malt. Very fresh and green in flavor right now. Tastes like a DIPA right now with all the hops. The after taste is very clean and kind of refreshing.  Medium body and very dry.  This drinks well so be careful and sloooow down. I hope to have a great vertical set up over time.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Hops dominate here.  taste is big chewy caramel rich flavor, that is after you get past the forest of pine trees. Big piney floral malt bomb, but in a good way. Nice flavors that are in your face, but are some how harmonious.  Mouthfeel is beyond thick with surprisingly high carbonation. Pretty dry .  Love this beer. Sipper, but man these intense flavors are a smack in the face, but really delicious.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,yuriruley,3.97,"Appearance - Looks incredible, nice dark coppery color, good amount of white head. Has great retention and good amounts of lacing. The appearance is spot on.  Smell - Floral hops with a strong malt background, not getting a whole lots else. Smells more like an IPA than a barleywine so I bumped it down a few notches.  Taste - The taste is like a flavor explosion, it is kind of overwhelming in a way. It has gotten better as I let it sit a bit. Has real strong hop profile, with a sticky/sweet malt backbone. As far as the flavors go it is a little on the aggressive side with hops to be my ideal barleywine. But overall not bad at all.  Mouthfeel - pretty thick and sticky, good carbonation.  Drink - Pretty easy to drink despite being a punch in the mouth with hops at first.  Hadn't reviewed in awhile so I decided to give this one a whirl. Overall a solid beer. I think I'd prefer it was some age on it so the rest of the flavors could shine a little better through the hop assault. For me hops shouldn't be the focal point in a barleywine, but still a tasty brew none the less.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Aroma is still a bit hoppy; reminds me of celebration with the spicy hop notes. There's also rich caramel malt sweetness, and booze. Some fruity notes come through on the nose as well.  Taste is dark fruits , some booze, spice notes, and still a hint of hops.  Feel is creamy, nearing full and heavy, slightly coating.

140,2671,WYVYRN527,4.08,"2011 Edition. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter.  A: 2011 Bigfoot pours a dark amber hue with a thin, cream-colored head that slowly settles. Retention is decent, and leaves sticky lacing on the glass.  S: Floral hops surrounded by a thick malt backbone, with scents of dried fruit, fig, spice, and alcohol. Hints of citrus and pine linger in the backround.  T: A very assertively hopped beer of this style. Floral, with lots of pine and citrus. Malt brings forth notes of caramel, dried fruits, toast, and some spice. Finish is slightly alcoholic and quite warming.  Notes: Bigfoot is a full-bodied brew, and flavors remain on the palate for some time after each sip. While this is a fresh example, it's a bit off-balanced, yet still tasty. This is one for the cellar, as the hops will mellow and flvors will meld together quite nicely. This is a beer that I look forward to every year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,amcmaho1,4.15,"Fresh 2011 Bigfoot picked up earlier today...  Appearance: Great crimson colored body. Pours a small head with nice lacing. Very beautiful presentation!  Smell: Huge malt sweetness and aromatic hops dominate the nose. It smells ""fresh"" in a good way; although i know how well this ages, and subsequently how the flavors and aromas will shift with time. For now though, the hop profile is taking a front seat along with the malt, giving this barleywine a great ""American"" edge.  Taste: Again, the great interplay between the sweetness of the malt and the bitterness of the hops. There's a little alcohol burn and astringency, though it's marginal.  Mouthfeel: Nice amount of carbonation, and little to no ""syrupy"" feeling. It's undoubtedly a ""bigger"" beer, though not a behemoth. This makes it very drinkable for me. As great as it is now though (and it certainly is...)

140,2671,Beertracker,4.65,"SNBA (Expedition 2011) pours up with intrepid antipation and plenty of effervescence that creates a plethora of tiny-modest bubbles which create a massive sustainable beige-tannish cream colored head that sits regally atop the deep reddish-brown body. The head retention is amazing! The initial clarity suffers from a bit of ""chill or hop haze"", but clears nicely after it warms in hand and shows off some definite legs. The initial aroma showcases the resinous Northwest hops (Cascade & Centennial) which are part of the signature with an abundantly fruity (citrus salad/grapefruit) character. The additional added spiciness (piney/pine tar) and grassy/floral notes add complexity and gives way to a solid malt backbone and vinous strength as it warms. The malt dominated flavor starts off nicely fruity (apricot preserves, Mandarin orange, Texas Red Grapefruit) with a lovely toasted (ginger snap, shortbread cookies, vanilla wafer) character & huge caramel maltiness (hot buttered rum, toffee/treacle) that carries a touch of nuttiness (sugared almonds, peanut brittle) which layers into the overall complexity of this classic American barleywine. There's a very marked-scorching amount of underlying bitterness that keeps this grain fed monster balanced and prevents it from ever being overly cloying. The powerful, lingering finish is bold, rich and dominated by a green hop bitterness that screams monster! Everything about the mouthfeel is perfect, just perfect... from the creaminess to the carbonation. A barley masterpiece for the mouth! I've a professed Bigfoot fan who's been hunting & hording cases since 1998 with my oldest expedition tasted being a 1988. Bigfoot is the quintessentail American-style Barleywine and remains one of the finest examples in all of the known beer world!

Aroma is strong and fruity, you know you've got something with bold taste from smell alone. The first taste is very pungent, and has a very long lasting aftertaste. You can really taste the alcohol in the aftertaste on the first few drinks. As your glass gets empty the taste hits less hard due to the overwhelming aftertaste. This has to be the one of the longest lasting, if not the longest lasting aftertaste I have ever experienced in a beer.

140,2671,PeprSprYoFace,4.6,New 2009 release. Poured into my Old Guardian snifter. It's a nice light brown color with some red highlights. A small tan head formed and dissapated but this beer has a ron of great lacing.  Smells really hoppy with a slight caramel smell in the background. Smells great I can't war to take a sip.  Taste is awesome. I love it. Almost IPAish but the malt is what makes it an awesome barleywine. The balance is awesome.  Mouthfeel is great. Nice and smooth with a nice crisp finish.  I will drink many of these throught the year. I think I'm going to buy a few more sixers in my next trip to the beer store.  2-1-11 Side By Side  This review is of a side by side of 09 and 11' Bigfoot.  The 09 has a more caramel color to it when the 11' has a red hue. No real head or lacing.  Aroma on the 11' is way more hop forward. Almost IPA citrus hops. The 09 is very caramel and some amount of prune aroma.  The tastes are the same. The 09 is much more caramel and semi sweet but with a bit of hop bite in the finish still. The 11' is more bitter and hop forward with a bit of malt and has a bit of booz burn.  Mouthfeel of the 11' is more dry because of the hops but the 09 is much more maltier.  Overall I love it fresh and I love it aged. I will continue to buy a case every year to age some.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Hoser77,4.03,"Disclaimer, this is the 2011 version and is obviously very young and hoppy. This beer will only improve with age!  Poured from 12oz. bottle into Fat Tire globe.  A-Deep ruby red color with garnet highlights. Slightly hazy due to the high hop level. Gentle cascade of bubbles billows up to support a dense off-white head that lingers with exYcellent lacing.  S-Smell is of young fresh hops. Definitely balanced towards the hops at this young age. Strong citrus and floral hop aroma with a hint of earthiness. Caramel malt sweetness noted. Definite legs, even the aroma is warming. Young stone fruit aromas. Lacks complexity, one sided due to age.  T-Firm hop bitterness and flavor that lingers throughout and coats your palate! Strong citrus, floral and earthy hop flavors with slight crystal malt sweetness in the background. Strong malt backbone barely supports the prominent hop bitterness and flavor.  M-Slightly astringent due to the high hop level. Mouthpuckering. The hops really coat your palate as your tongue sticks to the roof of your mouth. Finishes crisp and dry, but has a subtle chewiness. Well attenuated and warming.  D-Barleywines are so hard to review, especially when they are young. Bigfoot 2011 is more Double IPA than barleywine at this time. The hops will certainly fade in this beer and the malt will begin to come to the forefront as the beer becomes more complex with age.

140,2671,mjn5036,3.83,"2009 Vintage. Should be approximately 2 years old at this point.  Cracked this bottle open and poured into tulip glass. This one pours a ruby grapefruit/dark copper color. The pour gives birth to a massive three finger off-white, eggshell colored head; voluptuous and extremely sticky looking. This is a sexy looking beer. The head takes approximately four minutes to subside leaving ample sticky lacing all around the glass. A small mole hill of charred marshmallow foam floats on the meniscus. As I continued to drink this one, the lacing continued all the way down the glass in a superb fashion.  The age appears to have really mellowed this extreme beer out. The nose is fairly subtle, consisting of light spicy hop notes, earthy/musky notes, and the malts have much more of an appearance here as this one has aged. Of course alcohol is quite noticeable. As the beer warms I pick up on a sweet, candied fruits.  After two years the hops have seemed to virtually fade away to obscurity, leaving nothing but a lingering bitterness that quickly fades on the palate. What you are left with is a sweet, malty flavor dominating and a residual fruitiness. The mild bitterness helps balance this one out a bit. When I first took a sip of this beer it was still fairly cold and I was getting this weird, fermenting fruit, skunky flavor in the aftertaste. After letting it warm up for a while the peculiar flavor has disappeared.  After two years this is still one hell of a powerhouse of a beer and definitely not for the faint of heart. The alcohol is still unfortunately noticed more than I think it should be for its abv and age. The drinkability has gone up slightly as the hops have faded. The problem here is that without the hops you are left with a less complex beer. It becomes more similar to an English style but lacks the depth. I think this one is best to be drunk fresh. Don't get me wrong this is certainly a good beer; maybe some more time will help this one out. I'll stick to my fresh Bigfoot. If I want a non-hoppy barely wine I'll go for an English style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,paulozanello,4.22,"2010 BigFoot 12 oz bottle poured into a tulip.  Pours a dark amber-brown color, very opaque, with a monstrous light brown head that persists for about 5 min receding down to about a one finger foam cap. Lacing is very good.  Aroma is a nice mix of caramel mats, roasted malts, chocolate and resinous, fruity and citric hops. Not that much booze.  Taste starts with lots of malt. I was expecting much more hops from the nose but the malt bill on this beer is really complex. It starts with caramel and roasted malts and it soon shifts to lots of complex flavors like chocolate, coffee and toffee. There is a spike of bitterness right in the middle of the sip that persists well into the aftertaste. Not much else going on in terms of hops. I definitely get a little fruity and citric taste but it is minor and hiding behind the huge malt notes.  Body is huge and heavy like a Barley wine ought to be. The carbonation is high and mouthfeel is fairly smooth but nothing impressive. The alcohol content is very well hidden and I can only detect it through the warming sensation after each sip.  I like this beer. It has a hoppy nose a complex malt taste and a huge body. Definitely a sipper as far as drinkability goes.

140,2671,RBassSFHOPit2ME,4.35,"Had these two side by side - 2010 and 2007 Vintages.  A - both dark Ruby Red, almost black cherry color and head retention amazing. Lacing sticks throughout both snifters. Beautiful beer for the style.  S - dark fruits, plumbs, light bit of cherry, figs and rumish flavored dates or raisins - oaky character as well. Hops still there surprisingly a lot still in the 2007.  T - Follows nose exactly but add some earthiness to it. 2007 being more subdued - in both the nose and in the taste as the hops are not as apparent but trust me, they are still there. The 2007 is more boozy to my surprise as I figured age would have mellowed / smoothed it some.  Mouthfeel - A nice creamy bitterness to both, especially as they warmed. Neither had mellowed with some time too much as I'm realizing this beer really needs TIME.  D - Good, not great but hey! It's a barleywine. I'd be fine after 2 and move onto something else.  Final Thoughts - I remember reading a post from SierraNevadaBill stating that Bigfoot goes into a ""dumb"" period from the 2-4 year mark and it's best qualities come to the forefront after about 5 years or so...where this beer really becomes special. I'm thinking the 2007 is in the ""dumb phase"" now. While still a great brew, it was muted to me. I liked the 2010 better but NOT due to the fact that it was hoppier. All the other qualities that mentioned will turn out better with age in the 2010 I'd assume. Who knows. I could be wrong. Time will tell as I won't crack another 2007 for a year or so and see where I stand then. Great beer(s)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,Corndork2,4.78,"12oz 2010 bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass  A - Pours a beautiful deep caramel color, with some deep red hues in it as well. Almost resembles a Sherry color. Developed about a 1"" head that was present until the end. Leaves beautiful lacing around the edges of the glass as you drink. If the first part of the tasting experience is with the eyes, then this one begins very, very well.  S - Smells very thin, but with smooth notes of honey, caramel, citrus, yeast and the aroma of sharp hops. Its a deep, but bright bouquet.  T - Amazing. The hops bite in right when it enters the mouth, and they stay throughout the finish. The alcohol can be tastes, but the heat doesn't burn. The caramel notes add some sweetness, and the citrus really adds to the finish. The taste is very layered and complex, but to me, is good in every respect.  M - So smooth. Light, but coats the mouth well. Creamy, but not thick. A nice velvety brew.  D - The heat is in there, but it doesn't over color anything and make this one hard to drink. The smoothness and the light mouthfeel makes this one go down so easy. Its a real pleasure to drink.  I REALLY enjoyed this one. I bought twelve bottles, and will try one or two every other month or so. This was my first experience with Bigfoot, and I am not disappointed. This is definitely one to try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Keffa,3.85,"Bottle from 2010 poured into a Duvel tulip.  A: Poured a nice caramel red highlighted brown with a nice 2 finger tan-ish head. Head stays around and leaves some nice lacing that fades quickly. Some legs on the glass when tilted/swirled. Head settles into a thin cap through the whole glass.  S: Caramel malt sweetness and a little booze, floral hop, and dark (80+% cacao) chocolate. Biscuits, toffee, golden rum soaked raisins, and bread come through as well. Very complex aroma on this one, and the only note that doesn't come and go is the caramel sweetness.  T: Caramel, bready, and booze. Some floral/citrus notes in the very back. Some of the raisin and chocolate shows through.  M: Nice body, and a little creamy. Not overly carbonated, which is nice, because that would take away from this one, IMO.  D: As it sits, it's not bad. I think with a little bit more time for the alcohol to drop off, it'll be better, but as it sits, the alcohol is still right there asserting itself. I think that is the only real flaw I have noticed.  I meant to review this one fresh too, but forgot. This beer FRESH, is one of the single hoppiest beers I've had. With a year on it, it's a lot easier to drink, but it's still a bit hot. It's got great flavor though.

Nice carbonated feel as well. Well balanced, so the carbonation does not conflict with the heavy texture. Heavy bitterness throughout that drowns out a lot of the fruitiness.

Pours a medium dark copper red with white thick head when fresh and very little head after two years.  Citrus hop/lemon nose when fresh that, after two years, goes to a maple whiskey - big maple whiskey character carries through flavor profile and finish.  Mouthfeel is big and rich and well balanced with lots going on. You can't help but want to put more in your mouth.  I was not a fan until I again tried it after it spent two years in my cellar; I'm a fan. Complex orange peel lemon/lime hop flavors when fresh that, again, goes to a maple whiskey flavor profile; lots of burnt toast and bitter burnt orange; very complex overall; lots of hops; long hop finish that, after some age, retains complexity and goes to a bitter burnt orange/burnt toast bitter maple whiskey.

140,2671,Zimbo,4.35,Oh my. Over 2000 reviews of this beer. Is there really anything to add?  Drank this 2010 just over two weeks before the best before date of 22/01/2011 (duly noted that this date is written in the European manner so I can only assume it was intended for export).  Poured between an ISO tasting glass and a high tumbler the head was just everywhere and foaming like James Murdoch at the Edinburgh TV Festival. The mini tornado of thick beading moved throughout the deep reddish brown liquid.  A deep long piney nose and in the centre of all that is just a whiff of a sweet core. This is reflected in the taste but there is also some orange in there too. Some long pricklish acidity to taste. Very hoppy too. Tres nice.  Leaves lots of very light and delicate lacing.  I would have liked some more clinging lingering coating of the mouth. Just a bit more dimension for perfection. Still very impressive.  I can fully understand how some might consider this to be almost like an Imperial IPA. It is a total contrast to an English Barley Wine.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,zhanson88,3.86,"Appearance: Bigfoot pours a medium copper color with amber highlights. A couple fingers of light caramel colored head forms, and retention is very nice. Some slightly chunky lacing remains.  Smell: Plenty of caramel malts in there, along with some floral and citrus hops and slight booziness.  Taste: Caramel malts form the base of this beer. There is a bit of booziness, and a lot of floral and piney hops on the back end. Finish is pretty bitter.  Mouthfeel: This beer is medium bodied with fairly low carbonation. It drinks very smoothly. I think this beer will definitely benefit from sitting for a while. It is very hoppy, with sharp flavors right now.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Snamnoum,4.32,"Brewed in 2010  Appearance - hazy copper tone with 2 fingers of frothy beige head. Head retention is good and there is lots of lacing left on the glass.  Smell - fantastic smelling. Rich and vibrate fruit , toasted grains add a toffee like aroma, complimented perfectly by aggressive resiny hops. Also I want to say I smelled a little orange rind but maybe I'm just drinking it too fast...  Taste - from the first taste I'm overwhelmed by how big this beer is. Its got so much going on all at once. You get this wave of intense fruit and big malty sweetness. Followed by a toffee/brown sugar esque smokiness and sweetness. All tempered by a quite bitter finish especially as it warms. A little boozy alcohol but for the most part its pretty well tamed and disguised by the colossal hops and malt.  Mouthfeel - heavy bodied with medium carbonation and a creamy feel that lingers on your tongue and the walls of your mouth and refuses to go away.  Drinkabiliy - about as drinkable if not more so than any other barleywine this is a beer you drink like a glass of wine otherwise you'll be on your ass in no time. An excellent brew and well worth a try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Tifore,4.26,"2010 Vintage. Poured into my DFH snifter.  A - Pours a deep cherry color with some orange hues. I may have over aggressively poured this beer because it developed a huge 3 finger head that even spilled out of my glass a tad. The head started out as a light tan olor but as time went on turned into a off white and got super airy with huge bubbles. It also left the most delicious and sticky lacing that I have ever seen all along the sides of my glass and a very thick cap to top it off.  S - Smells of loads and loads of sweet dark fruits and grapes. Blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, some melon in there too as well as concord or sweet purple grapes. Lots of malts with carmel and slight roastyness in there as well. The overly sweetness of this beer even reminds me of Koolaid.... Haha.  T - The taste is absolutely delish. Very strong and bitter to start but that fades quick to the sweetness which takes you along for a malty berry ride to a coffee and toffee lingering finish.  M - Mouthfeel is good. By the end of the beer I felt it had lost all carbonation and almost felt a little flat, I was lost by this but overall a great smooth beer that leaves you with a awesome finish.  D - Well this barleywine is pretty intense and overpowering at times so it is a sipper and perhaps a one per night only thing. I will definitely be savoring the rest of the six pack and letting it age. Highly drinkable",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The aroma is a surprise. Fresh citrus and pine indicate a heavy hand of hops in this brew. The hops plow a path across the tongue and linger afterwords. The caramel makes inroads as it all develops, providing some needed balance against the attack of pine and grapefruit. The hops dry the palate, but the alcohol is hidden well. The big bold body provides a great mechanism to transport the flavor to the imbiber. Reasonably drinkable considering its heft of alcohol.  All and all, this is a tasty beer.

It just doesn't taste very good.  Pours an acceptable color and smells or a wee bit of caramel and delicious, but mostly hops and booze! (yes, still a bit of booze 3 years later).  The mouthfeel is thin with hops just oppressively attached to the tongue. What the heck, I thought I was drinking a barleywine? ugh...  Taste is...not so good. Like, a small bit of barleywine flavor, malt and deliciousness, but pushed away quickly by hops I cannot even fathom are still there 3 years later. They just don't belong. Wow, i thought I was going to love this beer and I really don't like it.  It's not really all that drinkable...it seems to take on the bad characteristics of a barleywine and a dipa.

M- Very Rich, and encompasses the entire palate. About a medium effervescence.  D- A nice barleywine. One of the better ones that I have encountered.

It has abrasive bitterness from the start on through the finish, increasing in intensity and lasting well on into the aftertaste with stinging astringency. It's one of the most bitter beers I have ever had. Yes, there's some raisin, toffee, and booze on the taste as an undercurrent that shows through on the finish pretty well....but absolutely nothing approaches the hoppiness here. It left me grimacing after each swallow. I know I'm not the biggest hophead on the planet, but the lack of balance here just turned me off.  In the end, it's just not my type of beer I suppose.

140,2671,Groomsy,4.28,"12 oz. bottle from 2010 Vintage pack. Poured into a snifter.  Appearance: The beer poured a beautiful amber/caramel color into the snifter; truth be told, the color is fairly similar to maple syrup with some reddish hues in the light. A very respectable head tops the beer and leaves massive, long-lasting strings of web-like lacing down the glass during consumption.  Smell: Hops are the order of the day here, and they are in abundance. The signature citrus aroma in most of SN's brews comes through, but there are also strong hints of pine and some underlying notes of caramel malt and some fruit. Evident smell of alcohol as well.  Taste: HUGE hop profile out front which takes no mercy on your palate. Tastes of citrus and especially pine abound, and there is little sweetness to be found in the initial taste. But there are some slight caramel notes in the middle as well as some notes of dark fruit to balance out the ample bitterness. Very balanced, but the taste of this sucker is gigantic. Not for the faint of heart. The high alcohol content also provides some lingering bitterness (along with the hops) long into the finish.  Mouthfeel: Fairly smooth for such a big beer. Surprisingly smooth, actually. The bitterness in the finish might cause some to find it coarse, though. The beer is fairly thick in body, and this is definitely a beer to slowly sip on as opposed to quaff in gigantic gulps.  Drinkability: With the alcohol content and interesting flavor, it would be way too easy to put a few of these down, but this is a beer to handle with caution and to enjoy slowly. I mean, it took me over an hour to really finish the glass and enjoy it.  A massive beer for the winter months. Definitely enjoyable, but it may have been a bit too much for my unrefined palate. Still fantastic, though. I would love to see how aging smooths out this bad boy.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,thebrood1987,4.49,Wow smell of piney hops hits you in the smell. I can tell this is going to be a real full flavored beer. The taste is unreal. The taste smacks you in the face with hops and very rich sweet malted barley. Very rich tasting. This tastes like an IPA with a shit load of malt. The rich malt flavor reminds me very much of the Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA malt profile. Actually this is like Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale times 5. So if you like the Celebration Ale and want that same taste but with even more bitter hops and and that same malt but a lot more of it this is your beer. Actually the Celebration Ale and this beer have the same ingredients. They both use two row malt and English barley with the Cascade Chinook and Centennial hops.

Smells plenty bitter though. the hops though are very evident in the flavor, though, riding through with centennials and cascades and a very sharp bitterness indicative of the Chinook. The citrus flavor is big, balancing upon the sweet caramel malt ride, with that wave of bitterness encompassing all. It's a fine beverage of fond memories.

This beer is a clear amber with some enhanced red hues when held up to the light. However, I'm most impressed by the creamy head that slowly dissipates and leaves a film on top of the fluid.  The smell is mostly hops with caramel malts in the backbone. Maybe pine on top of bread pudding?  The taste hits hard at the beginning and the end with hops. Very piney. The malt backbone is huge and sweet. Borderline cloying... overpowering on some sips and perfect on others.  The mouthfeel is good... but it doesn't caress my mouth like it could.  It's pretty darned drinkable, but I'm not dying to get the next sip.

140,2671,Arenbeer,4.32,12oz stub into a Snifter Glass. 2010 Matltage  A- Pours a nice reddish copper with a great lasting 1 finger off white head that leaves some sticky lacing.  S- Nice bitter smelling hop presence up front with a sweet caramel malted barley background. Such a great blend or molasses and brown sugar with a touch of darker fruits and maybe some toffee. Definitely a very unique smelling B-Wine. Some alcohol as it warms but not bad.  T- Man...I'd swear this was a DIPA if I blind tasted it! Great bitter pine and citrus hops with a strong and solid barley malt background. If you can get past the hops you get some nice fruits and sweet molasses. But man those hops!!!!  M- Solid thick and syrupy body with a good amount of carbonation and a serious bitter dry finish.  Overall this is no doubt a great B-Wine! I had my doubts but my mind has been changed. Would love to get some more to age and mature this sucker. Get more of a taste of the malts than hops.  SkÅL!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,demuzik,4.94,"By far one of my top ten US craft brews.  Appearance is deep and rich, smell is strong hoppy complexity, and the taste and mouthfeel is where it dominates... super chewy and thick from the massive malt usage, balanced with an enormous hop and dry hop gifting.

140,2671,surlytheduff,4.38,"Drank from a goofy stretched out tulip. 2010 BF. Poured a deep amber, with a two finger solid head. Smelled really citrusy and hoppy on first whiff; if I didn't know better I'd think it was a dipa. Boozy, caramel malts, floral citrus, really smelled tasty. Taste was more barleywine-esque then the smell. Good contrast between the sweetness and the alcohol up front, with a great bitter tasting finish. Mouthfeel was really nice; med-to-full bodied and rich, well carbonated.

The Nose is toasted biscuity malts, a rich sweet hop character, smells of dark fruit. The taste is a bold and bitter start ending up being a superb mixture of the malt & hops, finishes slightly bitter. Theres a wet hop taste, a barleywine taste and a big malty blast and discovered in subsequent sips. Barely notice the alcohol presence here. Medium bodied mouthfeel. This beer goes down quite easy, drinkable for any occasion. Another impressive craft beer from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,bridgetowhophead,4.5,"Bigfoot was the first barleywine I ever had, and possibly the best after Old Guardian. 2010 vintage now has substantially less alcohol presence then when I first had it back in July, but it still warms the throat as it goes down.  Pours a burn orange/toffee color, with a magnificent head. Smell is dominated by caramel malt with a hint of dark fruit and a bit of citrus hops. Taste is much more hop forward, quite bitter but the malt sweetness comes through in the middle with a finish that is all hops.

Smell: Floral hops, hints of malt sweetness.  Taste: Bitter hops mingle with the malt. Notes of caramel, brown sugar and a soft fruityness. The hops are very piney and resinous, and really round out this big beer. Alcohol heat is not noticeable right away, but creeps in later as it warms. Light citrus, pine and earthy tones, brown sugar and caramel malt.  Mouthfeel: Silky smooth on a fuller bodied beer. The mouthfeel of the draught Bigfoot is very nice and worthy of note.

T: Taste starts with some big boozy notes before lending to and overload of caramel and toffee sweetness.

Smell- Hops hit real hard and are then balanced by a somewhat roasted malt.  Taste- This beer has so much going on. Piney hop taste explodes as soon as you taste it then you get a hit of roasted and toasty malt flavor and a resiny,leafy hop after taste.  Mouthfeel- Very smooth beer, heavy but creamy.

Aroma is alcoholic slightly, like a liquor, with caramel and mild toffee and perhaps some leather.  Beer is big, chewy, in the mouth. Viscous. Its not hot any longer, its sweet at the lead off and heavy. The flavors of dark fruits and raisins cover the mouth. Its great and highly drinkable.

140,2671,bohemiandonut,4.85,"Barley wine is an oft-confusing style for me. The moment I think I know what to expect, another throws me for a loop and I'm left unsure I even know how to consider such a beer. That said, Bigfoot, I challenge thee to challenge me to understand you.  Pours a brilliant scarlet red with head that is just itching for another swirl. Aroma is exactly what I wanted, malted-over citrus rind simply bursting with brown sugary booze.  Wow what a taste! Nothing I could have expected, very smoky (in a good way), woody, and complex. The mouthfeel really adds to this experience, creamy but dry, exploding in a million different directions of flavor. To emphasize, this DOES NOT taste like charcoal or mesquite, but rather like a perfectly peat-y cognac dipped cigar. Tobacco leaf and pine needle.  I think I may go back and buy every last bottle of this, so happy to find it still on the shelf! Definitely a beer to drink with Santa. Thank you Chico.

140,2671,3FaveryRogue,4,"Bottle code 9-036-2-14:37=So, bottled on February 5th 2009, if I'm not mistaken. About 1.66 years on it. Have had many previous vintages, mostly fresh. But this one is in my glass tonight.  [L] Pours a murky, oily orange, with tan head, and sticky film. Hazy through the sides, yet clear from a bird's eye.  [S] Wallop of caramel, wet wood, citrus, and slight herbal tea quality.  [T] Has a very nice chocolately tone. And although it is not at all wood aged, I sense a woodiness here as well. Could be the mellowing. There is also a grapefruit, citrusy rind. And a very present caramel malt, as expected for a solid barleywine. Probably enough hops for a DIPA. Though malty, it does kind of skew the line.  [M] I'm always impressed as to how well the hops in the Bigfoot verticals stand up. Biting, dry, lengthy lingering prickly bitter. Big citrusy hop. Still very well carbonated, though on the fuller side. Chewy at times, but not extremely heavy.  [D] There are probably more drinkable barleywines. But I enjoy this one very much, and COULD prolly do 3 or 4 on a cold evening. This is a prime example of a hopped up American rendition IMHO. And always a great candidate for aging.

140,2671,wessells,3.72,"This is the first beer review that I have posted, despite following Beer Advocate for quite some time. I recently participated in a sufficiently rare tasting event to justify writing up my experience.  A year ago I received a gift of the 1990, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1998, 2001, and 2002 vintages of Bigfoot. They were procured at Stuffed Sandwich in LA. More recently I acquired the 2008 and 2010 (Sadly, 2009 was missed) vintages as well. Last Saturday (100210), the nine vintages were tasted vertically, from oldest to youngest. No alcohol was drunk beforehand, and only small amounts of each vintage were consumed until after I finished taking notes on each. Several palate rinses over a few minutes were performed between vintages.  A few general comments: the 2010 and 2008 vintages are both a rich red-brown color and have at least 1/2 inch of robust head from a strong pour. Vintages 2001 and 2002 form and retain a small head. Vintages 1998 and older show virtually zero carbonation. The 2001 and 2002 vintages are brown, while the 1990 to 1998 vintages are extremely dark, opaque brown.  Tasting notes by vintage:  1990: Nose: Raisins, brown sugar, maple syrup. Taste: A burnt, woody finish after hints of toffee and dried fruit. Mouth feel: Smooth and syrupy, much like better barrel-aged barleywines. General Comment: Nearly 20% of the bottle was dark brown (tasteless) sediment.  1993: Nose: Initial sour/rotten smell, suggesting the bottle had gone over. After the volatiles dispersed, a nose of caramel was present. Taste: Sour, rotten wood. Sadly, this vintage had gone over.  1994: Nose: Very weak nose of caramel. Hardly anything here. Taste: vaguely sweet dried fruits. Nearly flavorless. Mouth feel: Fizzy and watery. Not nearly as syrupy or smooth as the other older vintages.  1995: Nose: Again, raisins, dried fruit, caramel. Taste: A distinct but muted raisin flavor. Ashy and bitter finish. Mouth feel: Smoother than 1994, but does not approach the supple texture of 1990.  1998: Nose: Caramel, and remarkably, a hint of herbs. Sage, perhaps. Taste: Tart, with an ashy finish. This bottle had probably gone over.  2001: Nose: A weak nose of rum and butterscotch. Taste: Muted flavors of rum and raisins. Mouth feel: Slight carbonation helps a smooth but watery finish.  2002: Nose: Warm butterscotch and rum. Remarkably buttery! Taste: Mild flavors of fruits and caramel. The aftertaste is of earthy wood and leather. After sitting half an hour, a second helping showed stronger flavors. Mouth Feel: Watery, but smooth. The vintages that are about a decade old are not very syrupy.  2008: Nose: Rich fruit and caramel. A much stronger nose than any of the older vintages. Taste: Finally, a classic barleywine&#8211; rich fruits, leather, raisins, and caramel. For the first time, the alcohol is detectable. Mouth Feel: A smooth finish complemented by a robust head.  2010: Nose: Rum, leather, caramel, and a variety of fruits. Taste: Syrupy, buttery caramel, raisins, and a hint of hops. Until now, the existence of hops had been all but forgotten. Alcohol is present, yet welcome. Mouth Feel: Excellent full bodied texture. Wonderfully thick and syrupy, yet not overpowering.  Final synopsis: Some annual releases such as Anchor Christmas and modern barleywines such as The Perfect Storm, Mirror Mirror, and Abacus can (hopefully) withstand substantial aging. However, Bigfoot has a useful lifetime of only a few years. It was unfortunate that I could not procure a vintage from the middle of the last decade on short notice, as that would have been a good test of this beer's true longevity. The 1990 vintage was reminiscent of some modern barrel aged barleywines. This was lucky, as most of the older bottles were bland and dead, if not outright spoiled. The vintages up to 2002 had twist-off caps, which may not have been sufficiently secure.  If you are lucky enough to own ancient vintages of Bigfoot, they are worth saving for a special occasion, but not worth keeping for the purpose of aging them even more. These beers were not intended to be saved many years, and even if they haven't gone bad, the nose and taste has become quite weak. Only time will tell if recent vintages will prove longer-lived.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,tewaris,4.26,"OG: 23.0 Plato FG: 6.0 Plato 90 IBUs 12 oz 2010 vintage, bottled December 30, 2009, poured into a wine glass at room temperature.  Appearance 4.5/5 Clear reddish brown with a dense, creamy, tan colored head. The head retention was great with good lacing, but not as sticky as I hoped.  Aroma 3.5/5 Only ""downside"" of the aroma was its weakness. Otherwise fantastic: first impression was hops, but not of any specific kind. Some caramel malts and brown sugar, with sweetness and richness of a fresh baked rum raisin pie.  Taste 4.5/5 Bitterness is the king here. Starts slightly fruity sweet, but the bulk is a strong and smooth bitterness. Not harsh, but very powerful. Strong and complex hop flavor. The alcohol is felt in breath and in its warmth but not in the taste itself. Finish is dry and long with unyielding bitterness. The malts support the beer pretty well but the balance is decidedly bitter, as is appropriate for the style.  Mouthfeel 4.5/5 Feels more attenuated than I remember, both in the body and the finish. It's perhaps the age on it, almost ten months, but maybe it's because of the temperature too. Low carbonation lets the beer coat the mouth without being prickly. Keep in mind, however, that the finish is quite clean and not cloying at all.  Drinkability 4.5/5 Very good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,DefenCorps,3.93,"Since my first exposure to this beer, I've had a few barleywines, and a re-review is in order. This is the 2009 vintage.  The color is still beautiful, ruby red with a dense, light brown head with excellent retention and lacing. The nose is now dominated by a rather strong caramel presence, with brown sugar, syrup, a little burnt sugar. The hops have faded, there isn't much pine character noticeable, and definitely not as pungent as usual. A touch boozy too. The palate opens big, thick, chewy and syrupy with brown sugar, caramel, toffee and some dark fruit - dates, raisins - soaked in brandy. Sweeter than I'd expected - and remembered - this does seem very well-balanced. Full in body with light carbonation, the finish is long-lasting, sweet, a little boozy and rather fruity. Rather excellent stuff, despite my tastes having changed quite a bit since my original review. Ultimately, though, it's a little too sweet for my liking.

S: Glorious piney hops. I haven't had a beer in a week thanks to the flu and this is JUST what i craved. There's a massive malt backbone behind the hops, along with hints of raisins and figs. Definite alcohol presence too.  T: Strong caramel malt backbone with the massive hop bitterness. There's hints of toffee and nougat in here too. This is full bodied and alcoholic. Very good!  M: Excellent. Smooth, soft and viscous. Long, bitter finish  D: Drinking this will be rewarding but brutal. Respect it for what it is - an after dinner sipper  *31 July 2020** 2007 vintage. The nose is beautiful toffee and butterscotch, rich caramel and a little Vietnamese coffee. Pleasantly oxidized with no hops. Raisins, dark fruit. Buckwheat honey.

140,2671,brewnickbrew,4.42,"A- Orange, Hazy appearance with an off white foamy head that never goes away. In fact, the head was there until the final sip. Amazingly thick, sticky lacing.  S- Aroma of piney hops dominate with slight citrus. The malt is pleasant if you can weed out the hop aroma (no pun intended)  T- Piney Hops right up front, followed by a malty backbone. As the beer warms up the alcohol hits you and the malt comes through more and more.  M- The carbonation and hop bite hits you pronto. Strong alcohol.

140,2671,nas5755,4.47,"2010, reviewed in September 2010 This is a world class American Barleywine, the benchmark for the style and one my all time favorite beers. The pour reveals a reddish-amber beer with a fantastic head and lacing that seems to bind onto the glass. The nose of this beer is wonderful. It is full of astringent piney hops blended with citrus overtones, big malts layered with raisins and caramel with a very faint layer of alcohol. The taste is full of hops, citrus oils, pine and a big malt spine loaded with raisins, some caramel and a touch of honey. Really fantastic. A great mouthfeel, so smooth and easy to drink for a beer that has a massive harshness in its first few months. The carbonation levels are on the medium to medium low levels. A faint alcohol tinge is noticeable, but this beer is one of the few that can make the tinge pleasant. This is a great beer, one that I look forward to drinking again and again, whether fresh or aged.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,StarshipPoopers,4.03,"A - Very nice colour, a dark reddish-brown. The cream coloured head sits nicely on top, with a straight pour it produced about a finger of head that lingers behind. What really completes the beer's appearance is the excellent lacing.  S - Pine and hops are predominant with the malts close behind. I have a cold so my smell is a little lacking.  T - The malt and hops are balanced very nicely. One doesn't overpower the other, they are both present for the entirety of the taste which is good. The malts taste slightly burnt but are still sweet, the two characteristics play nicely off of each other. The hops are a bright and crisp pine taste that balances the sweet malts very nicely. You can tell that the alcohol is there, but you never taste it outright thanks to the balance.  M - Quite smooth, I like the mouthfeel of this beer. The bites from the hops and the overall smoothness makes it a nice drink to enjoy.  D - Not bad at all. It's not too sweet, not too bitter, not too heavy. All around it's a strong tasting beer without being too formidable to finish.

Damn fine hoppy barleywine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,BBP,4.23,"A- Almost a cherry copper color with a solid head and medium carbonation. Slight bits of yeast float around inside this one. Very formidable lacing.  S- Heavy malts, predominantly roasted, and it's share of hops as well. Pine is the dominant aroma from the hops and it balances the malty sweet aroma well.  T- Sweet caramel comes at you first, and then it seems to veer into roasted malts just after. It leaves you with a bit of a burnt aftertaste and is somewhat smoky. The hops balance the sweetness quite well and are quite substantial, and work hard so you never get overwhelmed by it. It never tastes of alcohol, but I did noticed a sliver of alcohol heat in my nose as I exhaled after drinking. It gets sweeter as it warms up, and that's how I prefer it. The flavor seems to be smoother.  M- Full and fairly smooth. Carbonation and dryness hold it back a bit. Goes down smooth in sips, but hard if you take too much. A bit too much dry stickiness for me.  D- Very easy to down. I know from experience that you have to watch yourself with this brew. It hides the 9.6 where nobody can find it. However the strong taste, fullness, and dryness certainly slows you down. Also, a hell of a deal, as it's about the price of a normal SN 6pk. The only thing I didn't really like was the dry finish.

S- Lots of hops, picking up some floral accents, pleasent to the nose.  T- Very bold flavor, immediately taste the kick from the hops and it lasts all the way to the back end. Taste remains long after the drink. Not too much alcohol taste for it being nearly 10%. Very impressive.  M- One of the bect I've had.

Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, 2010 Bigfoot is a clear, copper-orange color with a thick, foamy, amber-tan colored hop head (no pun intended). Bubbles rise through the glass like Champagne. The nose, to no great surprise is mostly all west coast hops like grapefruit, pineapple, heavy pine resin and floral but there are also some grainy sweet and toasty notes to boot. Hop lover's bouquet! The flavor (to no surprise again) leans towards the hop side as well with the hop flavors previously mentioned, piney and resinous more than fruity. The malt does its best to balance but this one definitely leaves a bitter aftertaste. There is a slight alcohol burn, but nothing out of line for 9.6%. Mouthfeel is full in body with a minimal but chewy carbonation and semi-dry finish.

S-Wow, what a difference a couple years can make. This is a hop bomb. Cascade and Centennial hops are redolent against a malty sweet backbone almost reminiscent of a DIPA. Hmm, I wonder how this vintage will age. Nicely, I suspect.  T-Hoppier than I expected. But, hell, that is what make this an American Barleywine, eh Brits?. There is sufficient malt sweetness that makes me believe this is one to cellar for years to come. I hope the Mayans were mistaken about a 12/21/2012 end to the calendar.

M-Full bodied, but quite smooth.  D-This is a phenomenal value compared to other barleywines. At $1.99 a 12 oz. single it is almost too good to be true.

Chunky lacing left on the glass as I drank this one down.  S- Good floral and pine like hops in the nose. A sweet caramel and toffee malt makes up the backbone of the beer. Some light brown sugar notes with a strong alcohol backend.  T- Sweet caramel malts in the front of this. A nice piney hop jumps out there along for the ride in front. There is a strong alcohol taste in the middle which I found to be interesting as I expected it to be more in the ending. Light darker fruits and a sweet brown sugar and caramel taste collide with a light citrus hops in the backend. Overall a good taste for this beer.  M- Medium-heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation is good for the style. Big malts left on the palate with a warming alcohol and darker fruits left long in the aftertaste. Flavors were well put together which made for a nice drinking beer. Medium drying on the palate though from the alcohol.  D- This was a very drinkable barleywine.

A clear deep red amber with 2 1/2 finger off white to very light tan head that reduces to about 1/2 cm cap with big patchy lacing. Awesome lacing left as the liquid was quaffed down.  Aroma initially sweet, grapefruit rind and pine, with malt poking through. Taste of grapefruit soda with bitterness popping up as the initial carbonation fades off the tongue accompanied with a nice sweet maltiness. French bread rides on the tongue while grapefruit rind/peel and piney bitterness coats the back of the roof of my mouth and lasts through the aftertaste. Alcohol pokes through only late during the swallow.  A little light bodied versus what I expected. Not exactly what I expected of this beer because it was hoppy but the maltiness is there and really hits back against the hops blow for blow during the super long finish.  Probably too high of an ABV to drink a lot of, and as it warms up the alcohol expresses itself too much. Also, the high hops would probably wear on me too much eventually. The beer burp was pure grapefruit! However, this is a pretty nice beer that I enjoyed and would definitely drink again!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,xnicknj,4.13,"2010 bottle poured into large snifter glass.  A - Pours a hazy auburn with orange and copper hues. A creamy, one finger high, off-white head retains nicely with layers of lacing littered across the glass.  S - Crispy dark malts, caramel, and a bit of warming alcohol.  T - Surprisingly bitter and juicy hops on the front end, mixing with citrus such as grapefruit. A beefy malt backbone lies underneath with caramel and toasted grain. There's a touch of fruit sweetness hidden in between everything along with a bit of astringency, which might be capable of turning people off. Finally, a flair of alcohol heat warms up the palate during the finish.  M - Medium to full body, somewhat chewy, yet ultimately smooth.  D - Between the biting hops and boozy touch, this is definitely more of a sipper, but for 9.6% everything is masked well.  This is hands down one of my favorite Sierra Nevada beers by a longshot. I'd really like to try some more vintages and see how much this mellows out over a longer period (5-10 years).  ---  12oz bottle poured into snifter - 2011 vintage  Pours dark cherry auburn with a decent beige head which fades to nicely retained film with assorted patches and spots of lacing.  Strong pine resin and hops in the nose with some scents of fruity esters followed by malty sweetness.  Intense hop presence up front with sticky pine. Malted sweetness with caramel, burnt brown sugar and bready tones. Softer fruit notes and cherry hidden in between the more aggressive hop profile. Thick malted backbone laden with some warm alcohol presence. Smack of sticky pine hops, dryness and boozy warmth in the finish.  Full medium body, higher carbonation, a bit creamy and sticky. This is probably the freshest Bigfoot I've ever had, and it's definitely a different animal than the aged variety. This almost resembles a complex DIPA, but still remains super tasty and drinkable, although ultimately I enjoy it better with age.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,montecristo2,4.2,"A 2010 ale served from a bottle into a snifter.  Two fingered thick head. Smells piney and of caramel.  Same flavors persist in the taste-a nice caramel flavor and a great balance between hops and malts.  Awesome lacing on the glass as it slowly disappears into my mouth...  Nice to let this one warm a bit before drinking. Leave it out on the shelf for a few minutes before you drink straight from the fridge.  I've had vintages of this as old as 2005, which is AMAZING. Imagine the flavors present in this ale only much more smooth and pronounced.  Highly recommended. Buy a few to lay down for a couple of years!  Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,GDBEERMAN,4.43,"12 bottle into snifter. 2010 vintage. A: Pours a thick foamy head that grabs onto glass and leaves full lacing on the glass. Body is light amber in color and the head is a light tan. The haze in the body is a rich and non-transparent. S: An aroma of rich, sweet caramel dominates. A classic barley aroma that is only a treat for what is to come. Slight notes of roses are present. T/M: A strong and sweet balance is presented by this classic barley wine. A subtle spice is present thought the entire experience. A great malt back bone is layered with a nice balance of hops. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, with great lingering tastes. D: This is a great brew, that is very drinkable, in regards to style. Good balance of flavors make this my goto barley wine. A brew that can be drank anytime of year with a character that has you coming back for more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,TKEbeerman,4.08,"Poured into my SN XXX glass, this brew pours an almost perfect amber orange with an impressively frothy tan head. Lacing is left all the way down the glass  S: The aroma is lacking power and complexity, but is full of toasty malt and pinny hops. After months in my closet, this brew is still a hoped up slice of heaven.  T: The flavor is sweet caramel, with hoppy bitterness increasing over time. Overtime, this brew has maintained it's hop presence like no other.  MF/D: mouthfeel is still full, and drinkability is still superior.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,dgilks,4.08,"Bigfoot pours a rich, chestnut colour with a big, fluffy, light tan head. Great head retention. The beer is a touch hazy.  The aroma is citrussy and resinous and very reminiscent of a solid DIPA. There's plenty of alcohol too and a hit of toasty malt. Not overly malty.  This is actually a bit of a surprise. It's nowhere near as full on as something like Green Flash Barleywine and the hops are definitely forward presenting as a moderately-high bitterness and mild citrus character. The malt is sweet but not cloying with toasty, chocolate character which is good.  Medium body with moderate carbonation. Very good.  I like this though it is somewhat laid back compared to other American Barleywines (Green Flash and Rogue come to mind).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Reaper16,4.08,"2010 vintage served on-tap at Mellow Mushroom, Tuscaloosa, AL  How is this beer still on-tap in September? I was worried about the tap lines but I had a sample and everything was OK, so I ordered this twice.  Pours a luscious rufous color, like liquid rust. Dark enough that you can't see through it but it is not cloudy in the slightest bit. A dense two fingers of buff leather colored head sits like a heavy crown. Add to it spindly lacing and you have an impressive looking draught beer.  Pungent, toasted sourdough bread and some caramel provide the initial aromas. This is mostly malt, which is expected given the nine months of age on this keg. Raisin, drunken fig, maybe a small trace of Werther's Original candy. The hops provide a astringent quality to the nose; the citrus fruit is pretty much missing at this point. This is still good though it will get even better.  The taste mostly follows the nose. Lots of bready flavors. The hops are felt more prominently on the tongue; pine and a touch of tangerine are well-integrated into the malty body. Dark fruits and toffee. Booze for sure. A smidge of diacetyl, unfortunately; I taste a bit of butterscotch here and there.  This pour of Bigfoot was pleasantly toothsome in terms of mouthfeel but not so viscous that you couldn't drink the thing. The alcohol makes this a sipper, especially on your second glass that you shouldn't have but get anyway. No less drinkable than what the style calls for though.  Bigfoot is in its awkward in-between stage - some of you who have long hair will remember the awkward in-between stage of short and long when you were growing your hair - where the hops have started lose their fresh impact but the malt character hasn't developed enough to compensate. This stage occurs between 7 months and 14 months old in my experience. It's Bigfoot though - it is always going to be good. I was just stoked to see it on-tap here in AL.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,korguy123,4.45,"12oz bottle poured into my snifter. 2010 bottle. Special thanks to my brother nwfodder for grabbing these for me.  A- Dark amber/brown/crimson pour. Carbonation just bouncing around the glass like a presentation of swan lake. Two finger off white/meringue head. Fantastic lacing.  S- Sweet malts, pine, strawberries, mango, peach and faint jolly rancher smells.  T- Toasted malts, brown sugar, vanilla, piny hops. Very balanced for 90ibu. Sweet candy taste, roasted coffee beans. The alcohol is expertly hidden in this taste.  M- Sticky on the lips, creamy and silky. Slight juicy finish from the hops.  Outstanding beer. This is my second ever barley wine, last one I had reminded me more of an ice wine than anything. This is the epitome of superb. If it wasn't 9.6% and only be available in the states I'd drink one a night.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,IPAescotch,4.23,"Reasonable color, thick lacing. Dark pale amber. More dark than pale, but not a deep dark, a light dark if im making any sense.  smells of grapefruit and hops. Esters are strong in this one. Citrusy hops  tastes same as smell. Bitter with a fruity aftertaste and a smooth malt finish. At first i didn't think much of this one, but i like the way the taste develops through the sip.  Very drinkable and refreshing.  My favorite thing about this beer is licking the drops out of my moustach after a superbly satisfying sip. im a beer slob, its a guilty pleasure, but it makes it taste better.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,LiquidCucumber,4.06,"A - Dark cloudy brown, amazingly dark. This one didn't have much of a head but it's leaving nice lacing.  S - Caramel malts and the scent of pungent hops, I am guessing it's mostly Cascade because it smells so much like other SN brews.  T - That very same caramel maltiness but now with a blast of bitterness from the hops, I bet this stuff mellows out to be amazing (never had an aged one, really only on tap). But tastes pretty well balanced as it is, maybe it's the 6 months or so the 2010 has had on it.  M - Slick hops and sticky malts cover your mouth and linger for quite some time, very nice, epic even.  D - As a barleywine it suffers generally with the big D, but this one does pretty good. I really don't want to woof these down but I could easily finish several in a night, and that's saying something when I can't usually have more than a couple really flavorful beers in a sitting. Probably my favorite from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ohoh,4.25,"A nice, dark amber colour with a tan, sticky head.  A real warm scent of caramel malts and interesting floral hoppiness. There is also a hint of alcohol, but that's hardly a surprise.  Taste is true to the smell. The hops come quickly and balances the sweet malt with the alcohol complementing it nicely.  The body is surprisingly light and it's quite easy to drink. It's balanced by two different explosions of a) roasted malts and b) floral hops. You could definitely sip this for a while - it's interesting enough to concentrate on for some time - although I think I drank it a bit quickly.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,jsprain1,4.4,"A- Dark copper, rather opaque. A big head settles into a thin foam with good lacing. S- Smell is of intense hops, grapefruit and pine, with a lightly roasted malt background aroma along with a bit of alcohol. T- Super aggressive hop opening transitions into a nice malt flavor. Finishes with a bit of alcohol warmth. M- Rather astringent and mouth-whacking if you will. Dry finish from the alcohol. Medium body and low carbonation, yet this plays into the beer pretty well. D- A darn good beer, solid in almost every regard. A very good beer, even if it doesn't fit the barleywine mold. But then again, SN was made to be outside the mold.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,mavbrew,4.32,"A: Poured an aged 2009 Bigfoot into my new Duck Rabbit snifter. It's a dark amber color with a two finger off white head. Nice lacing down the side of the glass that hangs around for a while.  S: Floral/hoppy notes are the first and most prominent scent I noticed. Slight fruity scent is evident as well.  T: The higher ABV hits you right off the bat, followed with some serious hops. Much smoother than I can remember before it was aged. Letting this beer sit for a while seems to help in the taste category.  M: Medium bodied with not much carbonation. Not sure if this is due to the aging process or not.  D: Very smooth and hoppy. The aging process will definitely give this beer a nice smooth taste, I have a 2010 that I will be drinking soon to compare, still aged but not quite as long.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Haybeerman,4.23,"A: Murky orange/amber color; like a light copper. Poured a 1 finger creamy tan head with good retention. Sheets of sticky lacing.  S: Roasted caramel malts. Piney floral hops. Alcohol. Lots going on.  T: Sweet roasted malt up front. Big floral hop flavor quqickly follows; more like an explosion. Fruity alcohol finish. For as sharp as all the flavors all, balance is good  M: Light body. Moderate carbonation. Sharp, dry and hot.  D: Flavorful. Balanced in an odd way. definitely a sipper.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,jmarvin4189,3.94,"Poured out of a bottle into a glass, 2010 Bigfoot Ale  Appearance - this is a unique looking beer its a dark brown but almost looks purple with off white head that leaves a nice lacing  Smell - has an alcohol smell along with some sweet fruit undertones  Taste/Mouthfeel - I don't know how to describe this taste, its very unique, this is my first barleywine. Right off the bat you get slammed in the face with the high abv which creates a very nice warming feeling all the way down. the taste is very complex its sweet but at the same time it isn't, i really can't describe this beer. its just tasty  Drinkability - not something i could slug back but it is definitely a joy to be drinking it",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,philosobeer,4.28,"Poured into a large wine glass. The vintage I'm reviewing now is 2010, so this is virtually unaged.  Appearance - Tan and a good couple fingers thick. It settles down, but remains coating the top.  Smell - The hops stick out, but with a certain alcohol presence and some very sweet flavors. There's some lemon and grapefruit here, and a tone of pine. The only thing it loses points on is it's slightly solventy, too.  Taste - Very nice. It is on the bitter side of the scale, but there are nice malt sugar tastes really makng a good balancing act. Also treacle, and an almost plum like fruitiness. Did I mention the hops? Lots of depth here.  Feel - Sits very well. It is heavy but also quite silky. The underplayed carbonation a big plus here, too.  Drinkability - I wondered if it should be this drinkable. It really warms you up, and it's hard to out down, but the alcohol and heft make this a little hard to finish a second (though I usually keep it to one)q",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,generallee,4.45,"Presentation: (2009-2008-2007 vertical) They were poured from brown 12oz bottles into tulip glasses. Each label is different and each cap has the year or vintage of the brew.  Appearance: (2009) Its body has a deep reddish brown color with a slight haze. The head is thin, about one finger, and very clingy. Over time as I slowly sipped this one it gradually settled down to wispy thin covering that makes nice lace rings. (2008) This one is very close to the 2009 in color, haze, head and lacing. (2007) The 2007 has the same color as the 09 and 08 but with a little more haze and a little less head.  Smell: (2009) There are lots of wonderful citrus and resiny pine like hop notes in the aroma over rich sweet caramel and roasted malty notes. The alcohol is noticeable and boozy in a good way. (2008) This one still has big hop notes with some more bready, roasty and caramel notes coming out. The alcohol is still noticeable and boozy. (2007) This one has the closest balance with hops still most noticeable. The barley malt really comes out here and the boozy alcohol adds its own sweet touch.  Taste/Palate: (2009) Its big full body brings a base of warm boozy sweet malt with strong hops mixed in. There are notes of rich caramel, roasted grain and red lickerish candy covered with powerful citrus and resiny spicy hops. Hop bitterness bites onto the tongue and hangs on long into the finish. The texture has a firm slick feel with nice soft carbonation. (2008) In this year the caramel notes sweeten slightly, alcohol mellows a touch and roasted notes come out more with bready yeast notes coming in as well. Hop notes are still big but bring some herbal orange and lemon citrus notes the piney hop bitterness. (2007) With this year all the flavor notes and bitterness mellow and blend together just a bit more.  Notes: All three years were outstanding and very tasty. All were very similar with just a gradual mellowing of character. The hops really held up well with age.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,BobZ,3.29,"12 oz., 2010 Vintage, Poured into my Duvel Tulip.  Appearance: Golden copper/orange, initial thin head dissipates, decent amount of lacing.  Smell: Hops are very dominant, very little sweetness, in fact very little beyond the piney/slightly citrus hop aroma.  Taste: Follows the nose almost verbatim. Hop bitterness at the beginning, middle, and finish, no real taste of alcohol, in fact not much malt flavor either. In some ways, a one dimensional beer, there are other flavor elements present but the hoppy bitterness envelops them all.  Mouth feel: Clean and relatively smooth, well carbonated.  Drinkability: A sipper and a bit bitter for my liking.  No real comparisons can be made to a British or even a Belgian barleywine. Color and appearance characteristics are the only similarities.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,GarrettMD,4.3,"2010 bottle  A - Pours a clear ruby color with 2 fingers thick bubbly off white head.  S - Smell is mostly citrus hops with a slight alcohol scent.Some slight caramel malt is coming through.  T - Huge malt character, caramel, slight roasted flavor. Hops are very present as well. Citrus is still the main flavor, bitterness overpowers the hop flavor though.  M - Medium bodied, good carbonation. Slightly oily from the hops. Finish is mostly bittering hops with a small hint of alcohol.  D - Very good drinkability, ABV isn't too noticeable, very smooth beer with a well rounded flavor.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Jiggamyte,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  A Poured a light reddish brown with light lacing. Very little head sticks around for the entire beer to be finished.  S A pleasant floral, hoppy scent with subtle malt undertones. Citrus and grassy are the major scents here.  T Citrusy, piney, grapefruity, and grassy are your big tastes. In the background are tastes of caramel and slight malt.  M There is a heavy, crisp, and bitter mouthfeel here. This beer has a warmth that builds up due to high levels of alcohol.  Overall this is a good beer to have during a cool fall or spring evening. It is refreshing and very strong. One or two of these can certainly help someone go to bed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,nerdrocker101,4.25,"2005 vintage thanks to my buddy Ashton.  Pours a syrupy brown with just a ring of creamy head and a nice lacing.  The smell is certainly sweet malts with almost a wintergreen aroma to it. I find that to be a little odd, but not exactly a bad thing.  Tastes like brown sugar, maple, vanilla and a little bit of raisin.  Very well rounded with age, medium-full body. Slick, oily feel.  This is certainly the oldest vintage of any beer that I've ever had. Wow, does it make a difference. I've got to get on top of aging some more things.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,CHickman,4.48,"2010 BigFoot BarleyWine Style Ale: Pours cloudy blood red with a creamy/foamy 2 finger tan head that lasted a while and left a creamy layer on top as the beer went down; a lot of sediment floating in the beer and great lacing that clings to the glass. Love the artwork on the bottle as well!  Smells of floral hops, piney hops, really sweet malt, caramel, syrup, wheat bread and brown sugar. Very hoppy nose that is also incredibly sweet and inviting even with the alcohol present in the aroma. This beer lets you know from the star that it's got a kick.  Huge sweet malt and hop flavor up front, followed by the alcohol heat that tasted like rum or bourbon; this tastes of floral hops, citrus hops, piney hops, sweet malt, caramel, dark fruit like plum and or raisin, orange peel, grapefruit, light brown sugar, some vanilla as well as molasses. Very sweet, yet somewhat bitter like an IPA from the hops. This is a strong beer and has a very good balance, with a bitter pucker in the finish which leaves a combo of toasted grains, sweet malt and grapefruit or citrus hops. A real nice beer to sip and savor, I found this extremely enjoyable on the palate.  Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with very little carbonation and an oily feel; body was heavy and chewy, but still managed to go down easy even with the alcohol presence.  Drinkability was good, especially considering the high ABV, but this is a beer to end the night with or just enjoy slowly. A very tasty beer that I would definitely have again and highly recommend!  2011 BigFoot BarleyWine Style Ale: Pours hazy blood red with brown and orange accents near the edges and a massive bubbly/creamy/foamy 2 finger tan head that faded very slowly and left excellent lacing with foamy rings going down the glass; the head was so solid it didn't move for a while and looked like a foam cloud and then when it was gone it left a creamy layer on top. A really great looking beer.  Smells of huge hops up front, with the malty sweetness, with caramel, toffee, wet bread, grains, dark fruits, brown sugar and some alcohol that smelled like it was aged in a wine barrel. Just like the 2010 brew, this has a very hoppy nose that's incredibly sweet and inviting even with the alcohol present in the aroma.  Tastes like it smells, with huge hops up front, floral hops, piney hops, citrus hops, then followed by the alcohol heat, sweet malt, pepper or hop spices, caramel, dark fruit like plum or raisin, orange peel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses and the wine barrel aging hints. It's sweet, but the hops provide enough alcohol punch to make it like an IPA with just enough spice flavor. A slight bitter pucker in the finish.  Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with very low carbonation and an oily feel, a medium body, and some chewyness to it; it's heavy and you can sense the alcohol presence, but it's still a really great beer that goes down easier than it should.  Drinkability was very good, especially considering the high ABV. Not a session beer, but a very tasty beer that I look forward to drinking each winter. Highly recommend again!  2012 BigFoot BarleyWine Style Ale: Spot on and amazing again; had it fresh and just cracked open a bottle over a year later and this beer ages with the best of them. To me the most impressive aspect may be how well the head stands up and sticks around after a year of aging; taste, smell and experience are all equally impressive both fresh and aged.  9/13/2016: Had a 2016 bottle and it was equally malty and hoppy, with sharp piney hops coming off like rye before the citrus and herbal notes resume control. Smooth and well balanced, it goes down easier than it should for a 9.6% ABV brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,EwaldEichstaett,3.83,"First barleywine ever! seems to be a good place to start :)  A: Nice head which leaves islands of foam for quite some time. Cloudy reddish brown color.  S: Smells like the Celebration ale by SN, hop dominated, pine and cirtus smell.  T: Very rich and flavorful beer, seems to have a nice balance. Whereas the beer smelled like an IPA it also has HUGE malt flavors, I was very happy about this. There is a little sweetness hidden under the piles of hops.  M: Very thick in the mouth with a little alcohol kick; I wish the beer had a bit more carbonation, I think it would go down smoother.  D: Ummm 9.6 ABV is not what I would call drinkable but... it does go down easy and tastes great!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,jmhart,4.42,"On tap at Taco Mac Kennesaw  A- Deep amber with a little maroon shade when held up to the light. A little hazy, but only just a little. Served with no head, but probably not the beer's fault. Had only a remnant of lacing around the glass, but again, probably not the beer.  S- Strong herby hop nose with only subtle amounts of caramel malt and nuts underneath. There was a potency to it, maybe anise or pepper.  T- The first flavor that hits you is intense concentrated hops. Earthy hops with elements of grapefruit. Quickly following the hops are intense caramel and raisin flavors, along with some nuts and the slightest hint of anise in the aftertaste.  M- Pretty thick, in the medium to full-bodied range for a barleywine. It was slightly chewy with a fun amount of carbonation. I would have liked to see just a little more body to it.  D- This was really tasty. A broad spectrum of flavors. Gotta be careful because of the alcohol...it doesn't hit you until you've already ordered you're second one.  Overall, I'd say this is pretty much dead on for the style. A standard from which all others should be compared. That being said, there's always room for improvement no matter how good one does.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,AgentMunky,4.25,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a St. Bernardus glass.  A: Pours a beautiful, rich, reddish colour, with light head which evolves into gentle tracings of infinitesimal surface bubbles. Something about this beer just exudes a warm, glowing, welcoming feel. Very impressive.  S: Magnificent! Strong, strong hops surge upwards, giving incredible force to this pungent nose. What might be lost in a wash of bitterness is instead highlighted -- light notes of citrus, an underlying breadiness, and distant malt.  T: Like no barleywine I've ever come across. Rather than being sweet or sticky, this is the most overwhelming hoppy concoction I can imagine. Slightly carbonated, the hops don't bite, but rather immerse. The tongue, the mouth, the senses, are awash in fresh flavours which cannot obscure the gestures towards balance -- an undeniable underlying sweetness, a citrus background, and a perfect roundness of flavour. The aftertaste is long, dry, and hoppily bitter. To me, this is amazingly delicious. To the non-hop-lover, I imagine this is repellent.  M: Chewy, bready, and good. The bitterness and smoothness mostly cancel one another out, leaving a neutral mouthfeel, edging towards bitterness. Hops leave a trace, but instead of characteristic soapiness, it's a clinging dryness.  D: As appealing as this beer is, I cannot imagine drinking more than one at a sitting. The one I did pour goes slowly, languishing in the mouth. If you like hops at all, this beer is a must buy; highly recommended.  EDIT (11 December 2011): the following review is of a bottle aged in a wine cellar for 14 months (and in my fridge for another month).  Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a St. Bernardus glass. Vintage 2010.  4A: A surprisingly amount of head. Half a finger thick and apparently rock-solid. Great retention. The beer is a murky brown that glows auburn in direct light. Translucent, but far from transparent.  4.5S: Time seems to have mellowed the hops considerably, but only in intensity, not amount. This bottle, however, has a balancing brown sugar/caramel sweetness. Notes of citrus and muted pine, along with a noticeably alcoholic twinge. Deep and nice.  4T/3.5M: A bit of a disappointment. The pine is still present in the taste, and it, combined with the high ABV, make for a rather astringent beer. It grows on me, slowly, as I note other interesting features such as the nutty dryness on the endtaste. The maintaste is still predominantly hoppy, but the hops are so enervated that it is rather humdrum experience. A very light carbonation avoids flatness, but lacks pizazz.  I realise that so far, the aged Bigfoot doesn't sound great, but it's still a very good beer; I retract the disappointed judgement. It's a different beer, and less vibrant, but somehow more...mature. The aftertaste is pleasantly bitter and feels reminiscent dark chocolate. The maintaste is more balanced and, if there is less fresh citrus, there is a more of a substantially malty backbone.  4O: I wish I'd put down a half dozen and tasted them at various ages. I prefer the fresh hops of this beer, but it was not a total disaster. Try younger, is my advice.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Pittsburgh,4.16,"I was really anticipating trying this beer, since it seems like there is alot buzz around the beer and people like it.  Great pour, very bubbly, sticks around the glass for a while, dark amber in color, doesn't smell much.  Taste is potent, comparable to the only other barleywine I have had (Stone), sticky icky, rich, malty, hoppy, fruity, strong finish in which you can slightly taste the alcohol, but its pretty well hidden. Bitterness is very strong in the end.  Instense beer, not sure how many I could drink in a sitting, but one is just great.  Overall I like the beer, definitely has the stamp from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,VTaler,3.62,So I finally come face to face with this mighty bigfoot. He looks rather dark maroon with a cloudy appearance. His head was huge. Kind of a yellow-orange color. As I stare at it I smell a very floral hop aroma straight up. After that comes an aroma of what I first thought to be chocolate but now I realize it was burnt sugar. I start to battle with the beast. It smacks me in the head with hops and comes around quickly with a sour uppercut. These hits are very strong and honestly it's a little hard to take but I keep up the fight.

140,2671,denflyr,4.25,"Poured into my goblet glass with a nice amber and in some ways slight burgundy hue. Minimal lacing and the head was minimal....but I think that was because the bottle was a wee bit cold.  Smell is better now that the beer has warmed a bit. Sweet malt and hoppy notes that have an orange/citrus note to them!  Taste is wonderful, not to sweet or hoopy. Very balanced!  Mouthfeel is good. Not overly carbonated and not cloying even with it high malt bill.  I could drink several of these, but would be foolish to do so with its high ABV! Alcohol nicely hidden and a GREAT beer overall!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,ptykozoon,3.75,"-2010 Vintage-  Appearance is a dark brown with a hint of orange. There is a strong off-white head, but it doesn't last too long. All in all a decent looking beer.  Smell is strong & sweet malty hops. I think that sums it up best. Hints of herbal aromas and caramel.  This is a very sweet beer. Taste is reminiscent of the nose, the hops and malty flavor are in perfect balance as of now, neither overpowers the other. Not bad but nothing amazing, I'm interested in tasting the yearly progress.  Mouthfeel is exceptional, strong carbonation, the hops are bitter on the tongue and the dessert like maltiness add to the thickness of the beer which is great.  Drinkability isn't bad, tastes like 7.6% not 9.6%. There is a dense sweetness however which is never exactly recommended for drinking large quantities of.

The lacing on this beer was amazing, the glass was almost entirely cream colored.  It had a very strong malt, pine aroma to it. Much different than the current vintage.  The taste of this aged vintage was very smooth with very little carbonation.  This is a good barleywine and even better with 4 years on it. If you can get your hands on some older vintages I highly recommend it. I also highly recommend setting aside this anytime you can.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Mouthfeel is syrupy and sticky like watery resin. I have a bunch of these to age so we'll see what happens  1999 Vintage, 15 years old! Sugar Cookie Dough colored head. Cloudy, amber hue, deep caramel color, similar to fresh maple sap. Aroma's definitely got some sweaty dank feet up in there musty cabinet odors, not super pleasant I'd rate it a 2.5, with the 2010 at a 4.5 We're averaging a 3.5. Taste has quite a bit of lingering hop citrus up front, just slightly bitter with the malt really being able to show it's stuff with some malty raw sugar notes at the back, with some orange peel rounding it out with a slight tartness as well 3.5 in this category.

Great dark fruit taste. Molasses sweetness, strong hop bitterness. Spice creeps in at the end. No alcohol taste.  MF - Again, big is the first word the comes to mind. Heavy bodied mouthfeel through and through. Carbonation doesn't come to lighten things up either.  D - I think it's a bit too strong to be very drinkable.

The taste is frontloaded with hops. They are citrusy and very obvious. The malt that I smelled is overpowered by the hops. I wish I had the willpower to cellar this beer but I'm a needy person.

Its probably one of the better looking beers I've seen in awhile. But, as we all know looks are only a fraction of the package. The smell is somewhat sweet, but also a bitterness that definitely comes from the hops. Taste-wise this was just as I've read from previous reviewers--grapefruit hops, with an undertone of sweetness. This one stays on the tongue for a little, and it goes down very smoothly. A bit too smoothly for a nearly 10 ABV :)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

T: The taste is still full of grapefruit hops but the age has tamed them considerably. There is a good deal of malty sweetness now and a yeasty wine-like quality. The finish is bittered by the hops.

S: this thing is loaded with malt and hops. Most other barley wines are too sweet & sugary, but this one has a great hop aroma. Spiciness, pine, & slight citrus shine through. The hops place a nice mask on whatever lies beneath. After swirling around in my glass a bit, I catch a peppermint-like scent.  T: not overly sweet, but syrupy. The alcohol strength definitely shines through. More hops than malt character. Wish there was a tad more malt flavor but I don't mind the hop kick whatsoever.  M: creamy and even bodied.

Smell -- An abundance of caramel and butterscotch with some floral hop aroma and some resin. Some alcohol is present in the nose, as to be expected.

Finish is hoppy and asserive with a fair amount of caramel and burnt roast flavors, as well as some alcohol bite.  Mouthfeel -- full-bodied, chewy, and with more carbonation than I am used to with for the style, but somehow it suits this beer quite well.  Drinkability -- This is a whole lot of beer in every way possible. What I really enjoyed about this beer was that even with 90 IBUs it still hits a lot of those prototypical malty, unctuous barleywine notes that makes them so satisfying.

140,2671,stakem,4.4,"Review from notes taken on 4/22/10.  Vintage 2004 on tap at the Buckeye beer engine in Cleveland, Oh. Served initially way too cold in a snifter. Pours a clear amber color with a creamy finger of tanned head. Solid retension and a wall of lace clings to the glass. Nose is a great malty monster which includes a combo of sweetness from the malt and floral hops. Taste is quite bitter from the hops with an oily resine-like feel. Body of this beer is medium with a very mild level of carbonation. The alcohol becomes quite pronounced as it warms. Malty sweetness provides a solid backing but doesn't overtake the oily hop bitterness that lingers in the mouth. Some dark carmelized sugars, a bit like molasses, are left combating the alcohol and hops. Overall well done.  I've had this brew a number of times and ways ranging from as fresh as only a couple of weeks in the bottle to a vintage on draft that was 16 years old. This is a remarkable beer that can really stand up to aging and seemingly the older it is the better it gets. A wonderful display of how malt character can develope and hops can fade. This vintage being reviewed was surprisingly still hoppy and could have easily be kept good for several more years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Hard to really pick anything else up.  T- This is unlike any barleywine I have had. There is a big spice presence combined with malt and something else I can't put my finger on. Maybe a little pumpkin.  M- Medium bodied with a very sprite like carbonation. Almost stings the tongue. A little warming from the alcohol and a spiciness on the back of the throat. A little thin for my liking in barleywines.

Nice hop bite, sweeter malts and hints of honey with alcohol at the tail end. The hops make this one of the more bitter barleywines I've had lately, but it still packs a distinct sweetness. The viscosity coats the mouth in a sweet, sticky way. Got a little boozy as I finished the glass, easy to drink one, two would be another story.

140,2671,Bouleboubier,4.41,"2010 issue. Served in a snifter. Bottle was left out of the fridge 20 min. before opening.  The head slowly billowed up out of the pour, lingered momentarily to peer around, and sedately settled back down, resting at around a 1/4 inch for awhile thereafter. Gleaming, ruby-brown, vinous shade. Light passing through gave it a plump, fruity brightness.  Piney hops jet out through the nose. Lightly toasty with hints of malted milk ball and black cherry jam. The body was somewhat smooth, thinned-out syrupy sweet, and of moderate maltiness. The hops are surely the centerpiece to the flavor and finish - a tiny tad over the top for an American barleywine.  The alcohol was a little too present in the nose, taste, and finish. There's other barleywines I've had, namely Victory's Old Horizontal, for one, that are more well-balanced, hiding the alcohol better while packing an even bigger punch. That said, Bigfoot is still dangerously sessionable, and the potent hop character sets it apart from the rest of the pack.

Pours a blurry rust orange, 2 inches of thick stubborn head (doesn't go away on its own). Gives off a smell somewhere between pear & lemon.  First swig takes out the rest of the head, flavor matches the smell plus just enough spicy bitterness to cut through. Relatively thin on the way down, though considering the sweetness on the back end that isn't bad.  Considering it's 9.6, the character of this is a shock. The ABV says sipper, but the flavor suggests having a 2nd or even 3rd would be acceptable.

140,2671,Kaiser777,4.48,"Off to Nevada we call it Serria Nevada and where hunting Bigfoot!  A- Volcano of foam with a light brown tint to it that is to lovely for words, and the way the foam coats the glass is like soap coating a cherry red 57' Chevy, like we say where I'm from off the hook, and the almost chocolate color of the beer with a symphony of bubbles that is beautiful to the eye.  S- The smell is of the best barley's, hops, and chocolate that is beyond a masterpiece.  T- Is a gift to the taste buds it's called a barley wine for a reason, it has a beautiful mixture of barley, hops, malt, and chocolate, if I meet a person that doesn't like this beer they must be from another world, it might be one of the best tasting beers I have ever had.  MF- Coats the mouth and stays there for a while that I love and appreciate with a passion that is un explainable.  D- This is very hard for the fact the longer it ages the better it is, so when you buy a six pack you can let it set for five years which is hard to do because the beer even in it's first years is above and beyond, and I fell in love with Serria Nevada when I first tasted there pal ale, and when I tasted the Bigfoot I was in beer extasy, so to all my brew masters in Cali that helped create this masterpiece much love ta ya, west side till we die!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,dasenebler,4.13,"Pours a clear reddish mahogany with a towering light tan head. Retention is excellent, with textbook layers of lace.  Aroma is of booze, molasses and overripe fruit.  Flavor is huge and bold, though not as insane as some barleywines. I love the enormous malt backbone-- it's sweet, luscious and thick. The hop bitterness is also huge and actually overcompensates, making this a very hop-forward barleywine, at least when fresh. The first thing I noticed was the piney American hop character of this beer. Though, there is a tea-like flavor in the aftertaste that I don't love. The carbonation is ample, but doesn't get in the way of the quaff. This beer leaves a hairy, chewy and lupulin loaded prehistoric footprint on your palate... I can see where it gets its name.  Delicious barleywine and something I will seek out in the future.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Mora2000,4,"2010 vintage. This bottle may be off since the beer was only filled up to the top of the label. It didn't taste oxidized or flat, so I am reviewing it.  Pours a reddish-amber color with a white head. The aroma is brown sugar, alcohol and caramel malt. Pretty basic barleywine aroma. The flavor is brown sugar, toffee and piney and citrus hops. Even with the big hop flavor, the bitterness is not too high. The alcohol is definitely detectable and is front and center in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,StaveHooks,4.84,"A - Pours a clear amber with a 1 inch creamy mocha head. Thick rings of lace last through the first half of the beer.  S - Big whiff of hop resin(almost stings the nose), dark chocolate, heavy toffee malt. Sweet alcohol notes. Candied fig.  T - A plethora of strong hops off the top, then melts into cream buttery toffee malt bomb. Finishes off with a heavy dose of crisp bitter hops along with a mild dark chocolate flavor. WOW! The aftertaste is a nirvana of malt and bitter hops. Mouthfeel is creamy and sweet(not sticky) but finishes quite dry. The hops sticks around for awhile.  This is my first taste of this style but I'm blown away. I didn't expect it to be as hopped. This beer just has giant flavor everywhere. Although it is very aggressive on the hops it also has a big assertive & established malt presence. It's really not that complex. It's just intense without going overboard in one direction. It's like the American ""comfort"" beer. Lot's of hops, big buttery malt, and plenty of alcohol. I can't think of anything wrong with it. I gambled and bought 2 six packs of it just in case I liked it and I wish I would have bought more. This review is sadly the last one I have. I will defiantly look for more so I can age it.  Also a BIG plus for the 6 pack! Thank you SN for that.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,RickS95,4.5,"Dark bronze and orange-y in color, with a fluffy beige head. Beautiful cascading head formation with nice retention. Very creamy up top of a thick, cloudy liquid.  Flowery hops dominate the nose. Hints of citrus, but you can tell from the smell this is a strong beer. Massive pine scent, you can smell the Pacific Northwest. With such a hop presence, it needs and packs a serious malt punch. Very bready nose. Some char and oak.  Certainly a manly beer. The hops are ever present, but the malt is the key ingredient in the taste category. A bit of orange peel and some pine as well, but it's got an earthy malt backbone that really steals the show.  Hops, hops and more hops. Extreme bitterness is all I can say. It starts off bitter and does nothing but get more bitter. The citrus notes are completely overwhelmed and do nothing to soothe the bitter. That said, it's an amazing bitter. For such a beast of a beer, it's so creamy and smooth. Extremely full bodied. The piney resins coat the tongue and never really let go. This thing gets better every year.  Such a good beer. I've been drinking Bigfoot since 2010 and it gets better every year. It's one of my favorite Barleywines and probably the easiest to drink. Another home run for Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,mountdew1,3.8,"2010 vintage poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a reddish brown. Head was a yellowish white 1 finger that clung well with big bubbles on the bottom and small foam on the top. Aroma was slightly hoppy with a small touch of citrus sweetness. Taste was strongly of hops with tangy bitterness. Very prevalent at the tip of the tounge, mellowed out on the back of the tounge. Slightly sweet as it warmed up. Coated the mouth well very, nicely carbonated, maybe a bit to sticky in the mouth. A good beer to drink, worth savoring.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Lolli1315,4.17,"A- A very hazy orange copper color with minimal head, but its retention is rather decent. Nice sticking lacing on the side of the glass helps to bring the look of this beer together.  S- Smacked in the face with bitter citrus and earthy hops on this one as it almost scorches the nose. Sweet caramel malt is apparent sparingly throughout the beer as a small hint of alcohol lingers in the background.  T- Wow, that is a hop punch. Strong hints of the earthy hops that were available in the smell coupled with a combination of citrus hops and grapefruit and orange flavors. The alcohol is more apparent in the taste than in the smell as it sticks around in the aftertaste. Sweet malt is detectable in moments as it jumps in and out of the taste only to be overcome by the hope bitterness each time. Back end of the beer fades into a stagnant bitter aftertaste with a trace of alcohol.  M- Medium bodied beer starting to move the thicker side, but not quite reaching an in between section. Great carbonation in the mouth that makes this quite the refreshing beer.  D- Well, this beer packs quite the punch, but the complexities of the tastes have me reaching pack to unravel more of it each time I put the glass down.  Notes: Could be the cornerstone for American Barleywines and quite enjoyable.

Taste up front is barley without too much of a bite too it, although it does increase as you finish. Good smooth feel with only a light malt coating. There's not much complexity, maybe a hint of dark fruit sweetness but mostly just an alcohol taste. It's sticky on the lips but still pretty smooth.  This barleywine reminds me more of a strong ale.

140,2671,irishking1977,3.14,"A: Pours a dark ruby red, with a huge, frothy white head, that leaves a great deal of lacing. Nice, not your average looking barleywine.  S: Dominated by hops and a hint of caramel.  T: Woah. Okay, folks. I get it. American craft beer drinkers like their beers hoppy, regardless of style. I like some beers hoppy to a point, but I also like my beers to have some degree of balance too. I'm waiting for Bud, Miller, and Coors to start producing their macros with tons of extra hops, then they will get the American craft beer drinkers on their side. This one is another one of those beers that took me by surprise at how intensely hoppy, piney, and citrusy it is. I was expecting some degree of hops bitterness and perhaps a decent malt background, but this doesn't have a malt background. Not enough to hold off the intense hops. Dark fruits, including raisins are also detectable, but are overridden by the amount of hops. I am a bit disappointed, to be sure.  M: Fairly oily, and thick. Moreso than your average barleywine. Tries to hold up to the intensity of the hops, but still loses out. Hops bitterness lingers on the palate for practically an eternity.  D: Barleywines usually aren't session beers, and this one is no different. The style in itself seems to be hit or miss with me; sometimes I find one that is really good, (Weyerbacher's Insanity) and there are some that miss the mark for me (this one, Blithering Idiot). I can understand the appeal to a degree, since this one looked really good on the pour, but otherwise, not enough of a balance, and it screams ""Hello, I am a typical suped up hoppy beer from an American brewery, trying to add more hops bitterness because that's what the majority of our drinkers want."" Too bad, because this one could have been pretty good with more of a balanced flavor.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

As it warms, I taste caramel, oak, and some undetermined spice. More time passes -- the hops grow in strength and work to balance this multifaceted, slow-sipping gem. The bitter finish is amazing.  M - Very good structure; not sticky, well carbonated; creamy, yet abrasive  D - Quite drinkable for a fresh barleywine. I'm loving this now and will be intermittently over the next few years.  This is an annual favorite, and it always delivers. If you're into barleywines (or simply hops, for that matter), you've likely already had this; if not, pick some up ASAP.

Balance definitely leans towards the tart, bitter citrus and hops. I could not taste any trace of alcohol like some reviewers noted.  M- Medium bodied and creamy. Not really syrupy in my opinion. Good bit of fine bubbled carbonation. Surprisingly smooth and crisp. Dominated by the long hop finish which coats the mouth.  D- I was ready for a second bottle before I finished the first.

140,2671,TCgoalie,3.28,"Notes from 4/30  This brew has a dark ruby red color with a snow like covering of off white head. Lacing on the glass is a map of where the initial head pour was.  I'm picking up a lot of lemony pine hops and some caramel malts when taking a big whiff. It is difficult to pick up the subtle notes since I am in a bar.  This tastes like pine tree juice. I can hardly believe this is a barleywine, it tastes like a double IPA. There is a lemony characteristic in the hops with some malt trying to show its face in the beginning, but the pine forest flavor takes over. The aftertaste shows some booze, evidence of its ABV.  I would say this is medium full in regards to its mouthfeel. It is smooth considering the hop bite, but I cannot get over the flavor...like I just ate a handful of grass and pine needles.

140,2671,infi,3.88,"2010 release - 12 oz. bottle.  Poured into a Duvel tulip.  Pours a beautiful raspberry-red color with lots of generous carbonation. The color is quite vibrant when held to the light - very appealing! A nice thin and frothy off-white head is released and leaves lots of speckled lacing throughout the whole glass. Smell is interesting. There's some sort of medicinal quality to it, sort of like cough medicine. But besides that, I can detect some grapefruit citrus scents, a good amount of piney hops and caramel malt. A decent myriad of aromas overall.  Anxious to try my first barleywine. Well, this is quite a novelty. It's sweet in taste, like caramel sugary. Straight forwardly sweet, wow. I'm actually surprised. Not bad! After a few seconds, a small amount of bitterness and citrus bite presents itself on the palate and then disappears. I was expecting a little more, but I'm not disappointed! Also, the alcohol isn't much of a factor in the taste either. Not too much of a burn as it goes down. This is actually pretty tasty as you sip occasionally.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth and silky on the palate. Total opposite of its appearance. Not much of an effervescent presence in the mouth. Quite nice and pleasant overall. Drinkability is easy, albeit slow. A possible choice for a nightcap.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

If one were looking for an English-style barleywine the hops would detract from that. But I am judging it based on what it is, a hop-forward American barleywine.  The taste is caramel and even a bit of chocolate from the malts, followed by a strong piney hop presence. The mouthfeel is medium for the style, fits nicely for this beer. The drinkability is very good for the style. I am drinking it out of a Guinness glass which may subconsciously make me drink it faster.

T: Taste is pretty similar to the smell. Big, bold, malty body with a bitter citrus hop finish. Not too aggressively hopped as some fresh barley wines tend to be. Tastes great! Not a whole lot of complexity, just a plain and simple barley wine style ale done perfectly.  M: Moderate carbonation. Nothing unappealing about the mouthfeel.  D: For me, this is a 1-2 and done.

Shows year (2010), and Alc. by Vol. (9.6%). Served in a snifter.  A - Deep amber to amber brown pour, with a good creamy head, fair retention and a few strokes of lacing.

The hoppiness works without being overpowering although in this fresh version is a touch too forward.  M - Medium to medium-full body with medium carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel.  D - Works well, a bit rough still to make it a memorable sipper but it would seem to be heading in that direction.  Notes: Quite a few years since I tried this, also fresh at the time and it seems about right if memory doesn't fail me. It´s a bit raw just right away. It´s still nice but a some aging might round it up nicely, maybe even a few months could do the trick to push it a bit not needing to reach a year in the cellar, which would not be a bad thing either.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Thick, creamy light tan head blankets the brew and sticks to the glass. Unrelenting head retention as well.  Putting your nose up to the glass is like being buried in a mountain of hops. The fruity, pine-like aroma is intoxicating.  Raw and robust grapefruit and piney hops explode in your mouth from even the smallest sip. Although raw and powerful, the hops do not make the flavor unpleasant. Malt provides support and balance with a maple and caramel sweetness and a thick, somewhat syrupy texture. Let it sit for a while and the bitterness mellows out to give a sweet, fruity character reminiscent of cherry and prunes. Hops latch onto the back of the tongue for a bittersweet, citrusy aftertaste.  A brawny, full-bodied brew with mild carbonation. Sticky texture at first and very drying.  I enjoy the way this doesn't follow the sweet stereotype so common among stronger ales. Huge and complex hop flavor yet still balanced with a solid malt backbone. A masterpiece in brewing!

140,2671,feelmefoam,4.28,"2010 Bigfoot Barleywine, I've heard good things, here goes:  Nice pfffft as I popped off the cap; the beer pours a dark burgundy color with lighter burnt orange highlights when held up to the light, fairly opaque. Nearly two fingers of head rises up off the top of the liquid here, it's off-white and hangs around for quite a while, leaving some really nice lacing around the glass.  The smell, while interesting, needs a little bit more spunk in my opinion. Big, toasty caramel malts abound throughout the nose while pine and citrus dance around in the background. A bit of alcohol can be detected, too, though not an unpleasant amount.  At first, Bigfoot's taste follows the nose to a T. Those big ole' caramel and toasted malts are battling it out, giving a sweet and roasty flavor up front. Unlike the nose, though, the hops do not stay in the background for long. They come up fast, swinging hard and beating back the maltiness with a distinct citrus and pine rush that is full of juicy flavor without being overly bitter. This is a slugfest between malt and hops that is pretty damn enjoyable.  With a body that's a few notches above medium and a light, effervescent amount of carbonation, Bigfoot stays fairly smooth and creamy, an easy sipper with a bit of pleasant (not harsh) alcohol warmth to finish things up.  Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale is all about being Big and Brash. Lots of malt, lots of hops, lots of things I like. The only detractors from drinkability is the ABV and thickness of the beer. I'm satisfied with just having one. Brutal but soft and lovable, Bigfoot is certainly a beverage to try from a brewery that has yet to disappoint me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

S: Aroma was not as strong as I expected and I got a lot of malt from it and just some hints of citrus hops and pine.  T: Taste was nice, but a bit subdued consisting of some roasted malt, citrus and pine hops, along with some toffee, caramel, and alcohol. Nice, but not quite as rich as I was expecting.  M: Thick, rich, and creamy feel with smooth carbonation and a pleasant tinge of alcohol.  D: For a 9.6% American Barleywine, this went down with no problem.

The aftertaste consists of citrus and dark fruit.  M: Very thick, creamy and resiny. Carbonation is quite strong and could perhaps benefit from a year or two in the cellar to mellow.

This is my first barleywine, so I wasn't sure what to expect. It smells hoppy and sweet. The taste is sweet with hints of apple followed by a huge hop assault. The strong hop bitterness and dryness remains on the palate almost unpleasantly long.  2010 vintage (2010/03/31): Appearance is the same as 2009. Aroma is full of fresh hops and sweet molasses. Flavor has plenty of hop flavor and bitterness. Sweetness has some apple sweetness as well as some darker molasses flavor. There is a touch of alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is somewhat syrupy but dries up well. It's a heavy beer, so I wouldn't want to drink that many of them in a sitting.  After almost a year in the fridge the 2010 has smoothed out nicely compared with a fresh 2011. The hop flavor and aroma are disappearing, but bitterness is still strong.

Aroma - sweet and tart green apples, canned pears, sticky piney hops, burnt sugar, caramel candies and some nose tingling alcohol all come out. As this is a fresh bottle there is no oxidization smell and it is not overly sweet.  Taste - nice crisp and bitter flavors abound from the first sip. My mouth is full of strong hop flavor, warming alcohol, burnt sugars, astringent pine and grapefruit along with dark sweet fruits (plums especially).  Overall - I love this beer fresh, its hoppy and has some nice dark fruit flavors and lots of complexity but yet is so easy to drink and enjoy without too much thought. Easily my favorite beer from Sierra Nevada (sorry Torpedo). After some age it mellows and the harshness of the alcohol and the hops really get smoothed out. Fresh or cellared, its a wonderful brew.

A tan head of small bubbles rests atop the beer. It has a sweet malty alcohol aroma. I'm picking up notes of raspberries and toffee. There is still a lot of hop and alcohol in the taste, even after two years of aging. There is a kiss of bitterness, but it doesn't linger too long. There is some sugary sweetness still present, but not nearly as much as fresh strong beers. There is a biscuit-like quality up front, but it is different from the Belgian wheats that I associate with this trait. It has a medium to heavy body. Not much carbonation is left, but a lot of stickiness remains. The alcohol in the aftertaste limits my drinkability. This is a large pour and I'll have a hard time finishing it.

A - Pours a beautiful orange-amber, with a huge, creamy head -- a good two inches that leaves a lacy web all the way down the glass. The beer itself is a bit hazy, with a little sediment present.  S - Light, flowery smell. Some notes of citrus -- possibly grapefruit?  T - Very full taste. The citrus notes are strong, and the alcohol is very present, warming as it goes down. There is a definite hoppy, bitter aftertaste.  M - Thick and oily, sticks to the tongue and cheeks. Carbonation is noticeable with a slight tickle on the throat, but not high, and certainly not overpowering.  D - While very tasty, the boldness of flavor and high alcohol content prevent this from being a beer I would drink too frequently.

It tasted like bitter grapefruit, citrus, pine and leaves a large hoppy bitterness on the back of the tongue. Pretty good drinkability.  Bigfoot 09- poured the same orange brown with a shade darker than the 2010 version. It smelled hoppier than the 2010, more malt flavors, grapefruit. It smelled the best out of all three. It tasted of hops, bitter grapefruit skin, citrus, some light toffee and malt flavors.  Bigfoot 08- the darkest color of them all- dark copper orange. It smelled of more malt characters than hops- toffee, vanilla, caramel and light citrus. It tasted more bitter than the 09 with more flavors of bitter grapefruit skin, light malt and citrus.  Overall, my favorite was the 2009 Bigfoot for it's fantastic malt/hop balance. The 2010 is great for a fresh barleywine that is still $10 a six pack, which is amazing. It's a good barleywine to start with if you have never had one before.

A: Dark copper in color with a faint residual head that takes a great deal of time to fade away before it leaves a ring around the top of the glass. Good lacing and mellow looking.  S: The over the top hops from a fresh batch aren't there. Hops still come through but underneath an almost chocolaty and sweet caramel layering.  T: This is probably near the ideal aging for this beer. The hops are naturally faded, but still have a floral and a tad of a resinous kick to them. The sweetness is great and this could only improve with a couple of years on it as the hops progress further into nonexistence. Nice rounded caramel sweetness that is layered with some other flavors to create a great tasting brew. I can see why people are obsessed with having this beer aged.

Overall smooth barleywine.  M - The warming is what I love about a good barleywine. Medium to high body so take small sips not chugs.  Overall for the price of 10.99 is is one of the cheapest and most drinkable Barleywines I ever got my hands on (most being 4-6 dollars a single bottle!) Hoppy, strong alcohol but only warming not in taste and little cloying yeast make it a winner in my book. Glad I have two more to enjoy whenever I need to get warmed up.

There is an earthy/funky aroma in both as well. The alcohol is more present in the 2004. WOW!!!  The aromas carry over into the palate. The 2001 really is unbelievable; it taste like a butterscotch-peanut butter-pecan pie. The flavors in the 2001 are so well balanced. The 2004 is good just not as rounded. There is much more going on than I can explain.  The mouthfeel is great. The 2001 is a perfect; velvety smooth, not overly sticky, with a nice long drying finish.

In the appearance, a plethora of shades are visible. Light orange to deep crimson to dusky ambers. Like looking into a tiger's eye stone. Frothy tan head that has the consistency and retention of ocean foam. Head gets about halfway down then settles in for the night. Mostly clear, but with some cascading sediment that dances from top to bottom. Ribbons of bubbles rocket to the top. One of the most beautiful beers I've ever seen.  In the nose, heavy citrusy hops. Lemons, grapefruit, almost edging on IPA hoppiness. But then I get the maltiness: sweet caramel.  Holy bitterness. This thing is so hop heavy. The resin clings to the tongue; it stings the nostrils. Oranges, grapefruits. I'd be tempted to categorize this as an IPA/DIPA if not for a honey sweet, grainy character. Oddly, I even pick up some fruity red wine notes as it warms. Alcohol is there, but not distracting.  Mouthfeel is just what I expect from a barleywine: syrupy, warming. Medium/high carbonation. Boozy. Nom.  I've had the 2009 and 2010 versions of this beer, and each has been a sensory adventure. I wouldn't say it's the best barleywine I've ever had (that status still belongs to Mirror Mirror) but it's an extremely solid example of the style -- and a welcome return to craft beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The aroma had the sweet and spicy barleywine character, with a nice bright hop balance. Sweet citrus, bitter pine, and grapefruit pith collaborated for a nice hop profile. Sweet malt, caramel, brown sugar, and spice made up the brunt of a complex nose. 9.6%?... doesn't seem like it, well hidden. However, towards the end of the beer - when I could really get my nose in the glass - it was much more evident.  The flavor was expected, an extension of the nose. Sweet ripe fruit and tannin all melded together well leaving a dry resiny finish. Maple syrup, caramel, and woody tones do a pretty good job of masking the, still apparent, alcohol.  The body was viscous, and slithered down leaving a dry chalky finish. The carbonation was quite sharp initially, but tamed as it sat.

Very hoppy, typical of the SN style. Plenty of the Cascade and Centennial hops SN is famous for. Not bad, but it's more ""SN"" than ""Barleywine."" There's some malt presence, but not enough for the style. Floral with hints of citrus. A hint of alcohol burn.  Dense and vicsous - it's a little syrupy. Not too syrupy, but the characteristic is there. It's bitter and hop-heavy, as expected from SN. I'm a little disappointed. It's like a very strong version of the SN Pale Ale. I'm not knocking it - it's good. But, like many American Barleywines, it misses the integral part of the style - Barley...  Slightly syrupy, but easy to sip on. Works OK with food, but it's really a beer that you should drink on it's own. Like I said earlier, it's not bad. It's good.

140,2671,chicagobeerriot,3.24,"This review is for the 2010 version, so that I have a baseline for subsequent reviews of earlier ""vintages"" (brewtages?). Pours deep copper with a ruby tinge and only a slight veil. A generous light tan head makes it seem as if you could use Bigfoot as a pillow. The head dissipates slowly, leaving impressive latice work on the side of the glass.  The smell is surprisingly restrained given the flavor profile. The hop smells are all at the front (mango/pine etc.) but some of the toffee and burnt cream notes are allowed to make an appearance as well.  Mouthfeel is also appropriate for the style. It's moderately thick, with just enough light carbonation to emphasize some of the hop notes to come.  When consumed fresh, this beer is a full-fledged fundamentalist hop assault. If your world view is ""Hops uber alles,"" then this is your barleywine. What I'm missing here is complexity. The hop flavors are perfectly fine: we've got the big three properly represented (pine, citrus rind and spice/pepper). The problem here is that there is little balance: the brief carmel sweet note is restrained and dominated by the prolonged, one-note bitter finish.  Now, it's essential to keep in mind that Bigfoot is two beers in one. When aged, the hops moderate, revealing the immense malt complexity that is held backstage when fresh.

Alcohol reveals itself only at the end and becomes more prominent as the beer warms up, but it is balanced with the other flavors and not overpowering. But the story here is really the hops; they command the entire palate and the linger is just amazing. For those that like that sort of thing, it is just fabulous..you can make each sip last 10 minutes if you want. Mouthfeel is almost creamy as carbonation is appropriately low. D - Surprisingly pretty high; don't get me wrong, this is definitely a sipper, but it's one that you could sip for quite a while and this is because of its balance.

140,2671,bonkers,4.2,"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle (2010 vintage) into a snifter. Amber/mahogany in color with a big foamy white head, leaves lots of lacing. Big spicy pine notes dominate the smell. The first sip is full of sticky pine that clings all over your mouth. It finishes with lots of lingering bitterness.

140,2671,Kegatron,4.3,"12 oz bottle into a snifter. 2010 release.  Pours a beautiful looking deep clear amber, with 2+ foamy fingers of foamy off-white head. Retention is great here, with this putting up a big frothy flareup of lacing that hangs in thick swathes down the sides of the glass. The aroma mainly consists of fresh American hops that literally blow up in the nose, being full of pine and spice and a deep smelling fresh herbal tanginess. A thick malty graininess fills the back of the nose, with most of the sweetness here appearing to come for the fruitiness and earthy nature of the hops.  Resins and spice from those fresh hops just rip the mouth, while a combo of earthy dankness and bitter citrus flavor creeps along in the background. Much like the aroma, there isn't a whole lot of sweetness present (but there's just enough), with a stiff backbone of toasted gaininess holding steady across the back of the palate. Finishes with a ton of lingering dryness, spice, and some leftover herbal tang. The mouthfeel is full and chewy with a good bit of thickness to the feel; but the overall creaminess of the carbonation helps keep this smooth in the mouth for such a big beer. Even at room temp, I'm happy to report that the alcohol here is kept in check, with only some gentle warmth in the chest and throat showing itself after each sip. Well done.  A classic any way you cut it, not only because of it's great availabilty and price each year but also because this is just a damn fine American Barleywine. I personally prefer this fresh each year but aged isn't shabby either. So loosen up thee ole' belt and enjoy one of these calorie-bombs!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,steelerguy,3.78,"A - Very clear mahogany, can see right through it. Big and sticky off white head that has some lasting and lacing power.  S - Big malt and hop aroma. Not going to bowl you over but you can smell right away this is a barleywine. Lots of malt sweetness and citrus hops.  T - The malt and hops hit hard and early which is good, the balance lasts throughout. Bitter finish as the sweetness of the malt and then the alcohol makes itself known.  M - Rich and creamy, goes down smooth and the warmth of the alcohol finishes each sip off nicely.  D - Smooth, balanced, and dare I say safe?

Looks okay, but not much lacing going on.  smell- hops are very present. Would be Sierra Nevada be Sierra Nevada without Cascade hops?? Yet there is a deep malt here as well. Seems like a yin and yang between the hops and the malt here.  taste- hops up front, malt kicks in not to long after. Malt vs. hop wrestling match with hints of sweetness and bitterness giving the palate all it can handle. The finish has has a bitter hops finish that lingers for a bit. Nice brew.  mouthfeel- Thick, syrupy, oily, but not at all offensive. I can't really pick up that 9.8 until I put one down. I feel it before I taste it. Well done!  This is my second most faovrite brew of the winter, and by far the best Barley Wine I have tasted to date.

140,2671,scottyshades,3.68,"2010 variety  A: Pours a transparent rich mahogany color with a fluffy, thick eggshell color head that retains very very well. In fact, it lasted throughout the entire session, releasing all those delicious aromatics. Each sip reveals a notch in the glass- pretty awesome.  S: Very nice nose, raisin, fig, with an overall sweet dark fruit note. Hops are definitely present; piney, resinous, floral. An overall sweetness from the dark fruits and an earthy hop presence that balances nicely with the pale and caramel malts. Apparently this recipe calls for the ""three C's"" hop variety- cascade, centennial, and chinook and I must say that this combination works for this style.  T: Definitely a big beer. Hops are intense, bittersweet, earthy and resinous. The hops and malts are not very balanced, in fact the malts play a very small role. Again, dark fruits (raisin, fig), molasses, caramel lay beneath a massive hop-dominant profile with an overall bitter-sweet flavor. Huge underlying bitter bite...kind of takes away from the balance, and what is more surprising is that this brew has 90IBUs...I would have guessed more.  MF/D: Body is medium for the style, prickly carbonation (a little too carbonated for my liking), chewy feel, and a bittersweet hop finish and aftertaste.  Definitely characteristic of the American version of the barleywine style- lots and lots of hops, and this one seems to be less balanced than others, but still an OK drink, especially as an aperitif. I had this alongside some baked apricot brie and it was and amazing pair!!!!  I cannot really figure out what I do not like in this beer...its either not malty enough, or too hoppy and bitter, maybe both..OR maybe its too young, so I'll cellar one for a while and edit accordingly  EDIT: I figured out what I don't like...There is a distinct taste that really resembles dextrose (priming sugar) and I've noticed it in a few other of SN offerings. It almost tastes like chewing on an aspirin",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,JoePat,4.32,Pours a dark amber color with an off white head. Smells like citrusy hops typical of Sierra Nevada. Taste like smooth malt over powered almost imediately with the hops.

140,2671,Arbitrator,3.6,"2010 vintage stubby into a glass. Purchased as a single at Whole Foods in Los Altos. Re-reviewed since the 2009 vintage was very much not to my liking.  A: Pours a murky amber color with reddish tints throughout the body when held to the light. The cap is lightly reddish brown, and recedes in sections over a few minutes before finally falling into a light film and donut on top of the brew. Lacing down the glass.  S: Reminds me a lot of a candied, caramel-ish pine branch. Some floral aromas too. Like walking through a forest.  T: Very hoppy. Lots of pine and floral flavors up front. The mid-taste brings out the malt character (although it's hard to detect with the really forward hops): caramel, toffee, and nuts. It actually reminds me of a slightly hoppier Double Bastard. Takes on a slightly metallic character as it warms.  M: Very warming. Medium-full body with low-moderate carbonation.  D: The flavors in this one are very strong; fresh, it's not a subtle beer at all. It's actually slightly hard to finish, what with the overpowering hop flavors and lack of dimensionality.  I suspect the 2009 bottle I had was bad, from reading my own review. Not oxidized, but just somehow off. The 2010 bottle is a lot better, although I still detect a metallic / mineral quality to the flavor that bugs me. It's a good barleywine, not a great one.

I'm intentionally drinking a very fresh 2010 vintage to compare it to older and more aged versions.  Eyes: Pours a soupy darkish red/copper. I need to pour the bottle slowly and wait as the head is so full and threatens to spill over. The off white foam is incredibly thick, and looks like the surface of the moon as it receded. Massive lacing. Gorgeous.  Nose: The hops are prominent, a sweet citrus, fruity profile. Dried fruit mix in with caramel. Smells very close to a DIPA, but not quite there.  Tongue: An extremely complex profile here. It's very thick and syrupy, with sweet malts, and bitter hops especially on the tail. All flavors are very well blended. The alcohol is fairly evident also.  Mouth: Thick, chewy and pasty, good carbonation for the weight. The savory mouthfeel seems to last for ever.  Libation: This is truly a great beer. I had heard this was a lot more hoppy than it actually was, there are enough hops to add an interesting dimension. Even trying this very fresh, I don't see how anyone could confuse this for a DIPA, but it is certainly a very tasty, very warming offering that I'll look forward to drinking and storing every year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

It pours a nice clear deep amber color with a nice creamy and and thick off white head that retains pretty well and laces all over the glass. The nose is leafy, estery, piney and grapefruity hop. The nose is quite nice, I just wish it were a bit more assertive.  The taste is definitely full bodied. This is all about the hops, at least at first. There are juicy and leafy and slightly acerbic piney hop with some citric tanginess. The hop is very upfront, and probably a tad bit more leafy than anything else. The beer is very well balanced with its thick creamy maltiness. There are lots of crystal and pale malts, not much graininess at all, very smooth and clean. The ABV on this beer is quite evident and is rather warming and not overly boozy. The beauty of this beer is its balance. The assertive hops are held together nicely by a malty and creamy base underneath. The ABV keeps this beer strong, a bit unrestrained, and warming. The beer is ultimately a strong sipping beer with lots more maltiness than you would find in a more vinous and syrupy barleywine. My vote is to label this as a DIPA.

Taste, is a full frontal assault on the palate. An immense beer, big on hops, the hoppiest barleywine I've ever had. I age a bunch of these, and if you want it to taste more like a traditional barleywine, age it a few years. If you want it to be like a West Coast IPA/Barleywine, drink it fresh. Its delicious either way, but for hopheads, I say drink it fresh.  Mouthfeel is excellent as well, can become challenging, as the malt feels heavier throughout the drink.

S: The hops are hitting pretty heavy here. Rich sweet maltiness backing it up with a definite IPA grape fruitiness. A bit of a Belgian character as well with the plum.  T: Wow! Very sharp and bitter up front. Some people say the hoppy bitterness isn't really there but it is explosive to me. It is more so than the 2 DIPA's I had last night. Bit of a candied plum bringing up the rear but the bitter hoppiness is what I get straight through.  M: Hmmm. It may be a tad too aggressive with the carbonation. Only weak spot so far.  I may be in the minority but the hoppiness is killer in this beer. Or maybe more of the reviews I have read are aged. I don't see myself aging one of these since I just enjoy bitterness too much. This is worth the wait every year and price is killer. How does Sierra Nevada get away with selling all of their sixers at the same price?

Leaves lots of lacing and retains a nice cap.  Smell - Fresh aggressive citrus hops. Beneath lies dart fruit and rich malt sweetness, although this nose is all about this hops! 4  Taste - Dark fruits and rich caramel command much more of a presence here than they did in the nose. The hops join the party part way through and add an intense ege to the sweetness by providing buckets of citrus fruit and raw bitterness. Finish is long and dry. Waves of bitterness put my tongue in a sleeper hold with the robust malt sweetness doing everything it can to keep my tongue from catching on fire. Alcohol is present, but remains hidden under the hop carpet bombing.  Mouthfeel - Medium-full bodied and supremely creamy carbonation. Quite a bit of carbonation. Smooth, lively, and not syrupy or sticky.  Drinkability - This is such an assetive and in-your-face ""barleywine-style"" beer. A hop lovers dream. I am excited to see where this beer goes over this next year and beyond. Personally, the hops feel a little overwhelming to the great malt profile at times. A big beer that is just oozing with American character. A classic.  ___ 2009 vintage reviewed 2-25-10 poured into Duvel tulip. Pours a reddish brown with a healthy off-white head. Tight clingy lace.  Sweet caramel and powerful hops in the nose.  Taste begins with malty sweetness that transforms into a viscous piney hop bite. Instantly warms the stomach as it goes down.

Could imagine this dying off very nicely with age. Very surprising floral hop aroma. Well balanced.  T: Hops bitter the malts perfectly. The hop use is is for mostly aroma in this beer I suppose. The slight bitterness brings out all the sweet characteristics of this beer. Vanilla and caramel come forward. The malts make their appearance. Caramel and roasty malts. Just sweet enough, not a cloying malt bomb like some other barleywines. Bitterness comes in the form of some citrus peel and some piney hops. Floral hops stay with you after each sip. Very delicate balance between the hops and malts for this BW.  M: Feels like it's going to be syrupy as it hits the tip of the tongue, but it rushes around the mouth as you sip. Hits each and every tastebud and hangs around with its hop bitterness that has your mouth feeling almost like you've had a very tannin rich wine.  D: Very easy sipping for a barleywine. Usually they take me 30 minutes to an hour to consume. This one may be going down a bit too fast. I'll let it warm for a bit. Fantastic barleywine! Can't wait to try an aged one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Mildly cloudy amber red in color the burnt orange hues more apparent along the rims and beer glass bottom. Honey and cane sugar in the nose, a touch boozy, candied orange peels, uncommonly grainy for the beer style, floral as well, suggestion of apricot or peach fruit. Full-bodied, however, the foaminess of the carbonation only increases its density, to the verge of becoming ponderous. The orange, grapefruit citrus more edgy here and the herbaceousness rises quite a bit. For a barleywine, this is a total hopfest, any caramel or honey accents way in the background. The apricot, nectarine fruit also recedes. Hence, what the hell is sweet here? The weight and viscosity is there, I'm just repeating myself in saying that this lacks the flavor profile of the vast majority of barleywine beers I have had in the past.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" dense beige head over the clear orangey brown brew. Head recedes very slowly, with heavy coating lace. Aroma is sweet, with ample piney hops. Taste starts sweet, but quickly cedes the conn to the overpowering pine hops. Hops character powers on through to the close, with ample bitterness and a warming close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both great. Excellent brew, and really hasn't lost a single step in the cellaring of the keg for the past two years.  3/29/04 - 4/4/4.5/4/4 German-style refillable growler filled at Oliver's Beverage, Albany, NY on 3/27/04, begun to enjoy on 3/29/04. (I have a feeling this will not be a one-session growler...)  First imperial pint glass pours with a HUGE 3+"" head, which was very dense, and probably all my fault for using the hard pour that most growlers seem to require. Head shrunk down to a manageable 1/2"" level after a few minutes, leaving lace, lace, everywhere, all the way up to the tippy top of the glass. Deep copper in hue. Very strong aroma of hops, and alcohol isn't hiding very well in there, either. Taste is upfront barleywine, mostly malt and alcohol, with the aftertaste of the ample hops that were smelled originally. This brew has an interesting symphony of flavors working here, and is to me quite a show of craftmanship. A bit overpowering to me, the combination of large amounts of hops and alcohol, but I can certainly appreciate their efforts.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,jeffthecheff,4.31,"From a bottle into a tulip glass. Bottled on the 351st day of 2009.  Bigfoot pours with a beautiful brownish red color and great clarity. The head is a solid 2 fingers at first and has a slightly tan color. It has a solid consistency and when it finally recedes it still has a thick cap and fantastic lacing.  The aroma is hoppier than I remember it. It has a sharp and raw aroma of pine, bitter grapefruit, and some wood. I thought ""gritty"" was a good term to describe it. There is also a touch of caramel malt and booze. This is all coming in with great strength.  This might be the most bitter beer I've ever had, and I've had some of the hoppiest from the west coast. That is the biggest character here. It's raw and a bit harsh, reminding me of the peel of grapefruit. There is some slight caramel coating, and a very big, smooth sweetness that is similar to rock candy. A real dessert type of flavor.  The mouthfeel is incredibly creamy, especially on the sips with the head. It manages to keep a big but creamy and smooth mouthfeel with a slight burn on the finish.  Very tasty and surprisingly easy to drink. It went down a bit quick and made me a bit sleepy. And I'm not talking about just your typical weekend nap.  2007 vintage: At 3 years, the aroma has a slightly herbal hop note, wood, cigar, and slightly sour dark fruit. The taste is super sweet and syrupy with a mouth coating, caramelly finish. It's still very rough and very rich in character.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Aroma is super-hoppy with about equal amounts pine and citrus - there is also a nice caramel malt sweetness. Taste is a blast to the palate - initial caramel sweetness followed by the hop plethora, which seems to be more piney, but the grapefruit bitterness is also in there - finishes with a touch of alcohol. Full-bodied with a zingy mouthfeel. Quite enjoyable - interested in trying one with some age on it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Honey malt with lemon rind, earthy grass, and maybe some dark fruits.  T - Phenomenal. One of the greatest tastes I've ever experienced. Follows the nose pretty close, the head coats each sip very nicely. It has one of the GREATEST all time bitter aftertastes I've ever tasted. It lingers in your throat and it's quite invigorating. Extremely resinous.  M - Nice and balanced. Not too full but not thin at all. Kind of weirdly inconsistent however.  D - With the ABV, you can probably only have 2 or 3 responsibly. But it would also be a desecration to this beer to ever have more than that. This shit is just fantastic. Maybe the best beer I've ever had.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,dismal,4.2,"My first Bigfoot, actually my first Barleywine so I'm kinda excited. Pours a dark red, copperish color with a small white head that disappears but not entirely. Leaves some ok lacing down the glass. The smell is slightly hoppy, malty, and kind of fruity with a hint of caramel. Not as hoppy in the smell as I was expecting but those piney hops are there. Taste wise it's pretty good. The piney hops stick out more to me in the taste than the smell, I was able to pick up the hoppier taste of the fresh Bigfoot I've heard a lot about. Other than that there is a sweet malt flavor and in the end it bites with some alcohol but it's barely apparent. As it's my first Barelywine I wasn't quite sure what to expect so maybe I'm still trying to figure it out. Overall though I like it. I can taste the alcohol but it isn't a problem at all. I'll probably pick up another sixer just to drink and then age the rest I have.

I was never impressed with Sierra Nevada until now. SLIGHTLY sweet malty thick canvas sets the stage for GLORIOUS resinous hops to paint a picture of grapefruits and pine. A feast for the nose as well as the palate. I would drink this over any DIPA/IPA any day. This is just amazing for a ""Barleywine style Ale"". I'm.. I'm just blown away.

Smells strongly like a bitter citric fruit, almost like a grapefruit I should say.  First sip is definitely hoppy. The bitter grapefruit that came off in its scent is present and up front on the pallet. There is a subtle sweetness to this, however, unlike other barleywines, this is far from sweet. It's got a certain sharpness to it that isn't usually present in barleywines. It almost tastes more IPA-like than anything else.  This beer is certainly an interesting one; and while it didn't turn out to be what I was expecting it to, I can definitely appreciate it for what it did.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Aroma of sweet grain, burnt raisins, caramel, rum soaked fruits, and a very light pine scent. Faint alcohol; fruity, sweet, and syrupy.  Heavy sweetness with a taste that mimics the nose quite well. Building hop bitterness idles and meshes with the sweet finish and alcohol heat at the swallow. Sweet, but mot cloyingly so. Smooth and not boozy.  Medium/high carbonated and full bodied.

I could smell the resiny hop aroma as soon as I cracked the bottle. In a blind scent test I would have difficulty distinguishing Bigfoot from an EastCoast syle 2X IPA. Once the beer hits the glass a wonderful smell fills the air. Very aromatic beer.  T: Outstanding. Opens up with a nice strong dose of bitter and that is quickly balanced by huge malty backbone. Loads of pine in this one...the combination of pine/juniper and a little heat screams gin to me and that's just fine 'cause I love gin. Very herbal and medicinal.  M: Good carbonation level. I'm very surprised at how dry this finishes. Not much aftertaste.  D: About as drinkable as a Barleywine should or could be. I could definitely drink another one of these.  Very impressed.

Head is a slight yellowish color that recedes but leaves beautiful lacing throughout the drinking of this beer.  Smells sweet like caramel and the hop aroma is present as well but what really jumps out is the scent of alcohol, its almost intimidating.  I love hoppy barley-wines but this might be a bit too bitter on the front of the tongue and follows through all the way to the end of each sip. The beer feels to lack complexity at the moment. It isn't bad at all but I actually seem to miss the sweetness found in many other barleywines. I like the cleanliness and carbonation, as many other barleywines come off as being a bit flat and too syrupy.  Beer is a bit of a chore to work through.

140,2671,PBoegel,4.38,"2010 Bottle poured on February 16, 2010.  Here I am reviewing a beer that I first had at the Waterfront Alehouse in 1997.  I find the appearance of Bigfoot to be nothing short of perfect, deep amber with brilliant clarity and a light tan dense head.  The aromas are pine, brown sugar, baked apple pie, light notes of chocolate and shortbread.  The taste is well balanced with a tangy bitterness but ample sweet malt and alcohol to blend into a perfect finish.  The mouthfeel can at times be a bit big if not cloying, but for a barleywine this is a minor drawback.  I find the beer drinkable, but I score this on the basis of how much you can take in an evening. More than one bigfoot in a session is not appealing to my palate.  Still to me this is the standard for an American Barleywine, with balance and a nod to a hop kick when young.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Higly reccomended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,StoutHouse,4.24,Besides the price in my area this beer is one of the best barley wines I had. It has a very rich smell without the harsh alcohol taste.

S - Very strong pine notes, more what I would expect from an IPA, but it had an interesting malty backbone.  T - Creamy with nice hops, a little caramel comes in to give an interesting mix. The hops are just slightly too piney for me, but not bad.  M - Light bodied, could use more carbonation but guessing because this was an old bottle it was reduced.  D - Not super drinkable, but could do more than one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Smell Fruity, juicy hops make up most of the aroma. They're not as pronounced as I expected; not up to the level of Celebration Ale. Some doughy, biscuity malts are faintly detectable. Orange, cranberry, strawberry, raspberry notes coming out.  Taste & Body Initial sip surprises me by how melded and behaved the flavors are. I remember this before as being assertively hopped and it's not striking me that way. The finish reveals the weight of this beer as a slight sting tickles my nose. Silky oily texture and full-bodied with a lower level of carbonation than lower strength beers. There's a sharp bitterness that cuts through at the end and fights on my tongue for dominance over the doughy sweet malts.  Overall An extremely drinkable young barley wine.

Drink this one over a 45 minute to an hour period. Tastes really come out as it warms. More pine/citrus hops with some fruitiness.  M- Full bodied. Alcoholic warmth. Goes down fairly easy.

140,2671,DerekP,4.4,"2010 bottle poured into an imperial pint glass (the one that looks similar to a weizen, around 19 oz's)  I've finally gone ahead and picked up a single of Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale, a curious brew I first noticed in six packs a year or two ago.  Sierra Nevada's brews almost always have an unmistakable hops smell. The only brew from this outstanding brewery that doesn't have the smell, to my knowledge, would be the recently released Glissade, a pretty distinct bock that is light in color and pilsner-style sharp in hop character.  This barleywine style ale is up there with Sierra Nevada's Estate, a tasty beverage a friend and I had the pleasure of enjoying several weeks ago while sharing a 24 oz bottle.  Not that I'm an expert, but I was thinking loudly, ""Cascade!"" when I got my first whiff and taste of Bigfoot. Turns out I was right, partly. Cascade hops are at work with Centennial and Chinook, all engaging in a variety of quality tactics. Just check the Sierra Nevada website to find out more.  The foam is always a half-inch thick, and the lacing is hefty. In fact, the lacing actually drys up on the glass. It gives you a good idea of how bitter the hops actually are in this brew.

Pungent fruity hop notes.  T & M: For a barleywine a little lighter bodied than expected but still relatively full bodied. A little creaminess in mouthful. Tones from nose come through up front with clean, dry hop tones in the finish. This is a barleywine that is not ridiculously overbearing, aging will be nice but isn't absolutely needed in my opinion.

There is some pale, biscuitty maltiness here too, but the hops are the star of this show and they really shine. A very nice job of masking the alcohol.

Little-to-no head, but still a good amount of lacing as this one goes down in the glass. Smell is very assertive--malty and very hoppy. Citrus and pineapple aromas as well. AS with the smell, the taste is an excellent combination of malts and hops, with the hops dominating. A little bready and quite bitter, with the same citrus and pineapple from the smell. Alcohol is very well concealed. Mouthfeel is crisp and again bitter, with a slightly dry finish. Very drinkable despite its ABV--which again is hardly noticeable. I wish I had another.  I bought just one bottle but I'll be buying more. I've had the '09 which I thought was good, but not great. I then had an '06, which changed my opinion of this beer for the better.

Really pretty ruby-brown that, when held to the light, has a very jewel-like quality to it. About a finger head. The lacing is sinewy and sticky.  S: Mmmmm, piney hops. That is the overriding kick to the nostrils in this one. I can smell the malt hiding in the background, though. A slight caramel aroma is also present. Not really complex, but I do like the dry hop character.  T: Definitely more of a balance between the malt and hop flavor in the taste than in the smell. I was expecting more of a hop-bomb based on the bouquet. The piney-hop dryness is present throughout the sip, but the malt sweetness is there until the very end to complement the hop flavor. Some really dry citrus flavors and a little breadiness are also in there.  M: A nice, full, puckering feel. Pretty dry at the end. It's not a full-out party in the mouth, but it's enjoyable.

Im going to pick some more of this up and throw it downstairs, its intense and i feel i t would be good to let it mellow out a bit.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,billyzoom666,3.43,12 oz bottle into pint glass. This pours an awesome caramel/amber color. It looks like there's sediments frozen into the middle of the beer. There's a nice little head and some lacing. This has a sweet barleywine smell to it. It's typical and average for the style. Wow! This has a bit of bite to it. It tastes like a mixture of blueberry and hop. Real nice stuff here. It's a great sipping beer. Please don't try and slam this!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,mdwalsh,4.35,"A: The beer is mahogany and slightly hazy with a little bit of active carbonation going on. The head is big, at least three fingers, and sort of sandy colored. A lot of texture in the head, many different sized bubbles and sparse but solid lacing. The head doesn't stick around too long though, which may be a good thing for a barleywine. 4.5/5  S: Very piney American hops. Just dense with resin, no malt here at all. It's like sticking your nose into a fresh cut Christmas tree. Maybe there's a little citrus, but no malt still. This, too me, smell's pretty quintessentially American Barleywine, and while that may be perfect, I'm not going to give a five because I would like to see more malt. Personal opinion, meet professional judging. 4.5/5  T: Here I can agree with this beer a little more. I get more of a malt backbone, though really see a lot of similarities between this and an IPA. Still got those big piney American hops, though the citrus is even more evident here than in the nose, especially along the edges of my tongue where it manifests in a biting bitter taste. I guess I really would like to see some more caramel malts out of this creature though, because I get none. I mean I can tell there is malt in here, but that's as much from the feel as from the flavor. Flavor I'd like to taste some carmelized or nutty grain tastes for sure, and I don't get that even as it warms. 4/5  M: Big, bold, beautiful, this beer really fills up the palate and the whole mouth, and reminds you why they call them barleywines. If the judgment was on feel alone, I'm not sure I could really tell the different between a well made barleywine like this and a lighter wine like Pinot Noir. 5/5  D: The first few sips are a little biting while your tongue gets used to it, and the nose can be a little overpowering, but all in all, drinkability is about what you would expect from a Barleywine. I think I'll pick up another few of these for a little aging. 4/5",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,zimm421,3.88,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. A dark amber color with hints of ruby in it as well, that is very hard to see though. Has a nice thick off-white head, that dissipates fairly slowly leaving clumps of head and great lacing down the glass.  Nothing huge stands out in the smell, but there are good hints of hops, with citrus and pine in the forefront, as well as some alcohol. Not a huge amount of nose, a little disappointing. The taste has a good amount of citrus and pine, with the hop flavor dominating. There is also a good amount of malts, blending very well. The aftertaste is very bitter, and the alcohol is noticeable as well. This beer also finishes very well.  The mouthfeel is very smooth at first, almost creamy, but the carbonation comes out at the end, finishing fairly dry. The drinkability is great as well. Even with the high ABV, I could put a few of these down without noticing it until later. Overall a great brew, slightly disappointing in the aroma, but everything else is great, just what I accepted.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Pahn,4.3,"(Numerical score reflects 2009 vintage, as it was the better of the two I've had, and you can age the 2010 if you so please)  12oz bottle into a wine glass. 2010 vintage.  Appearance: Moderate pour yields a 1/3 inch frothy, yellowish-white head that dissipates steadily. Beer is an almost fully opaque dark amber. Head and beer leave good lacing. (4.0)  Smell: At first all I get is a sugary and faint smell of fruit (white raisin, maybe some kind of berry). There's some melon there too. Gradually some floral hops come out, then it mellows into a semi-strong herbal, hoppy aroma. The herbal and sugary notes remain until the end. (4.0)  Taste: Similar to the smell, with a much bigger hop bite. At first the flavors are a bit difficult to differentiate, but the sips go: vague sugary/fruitiness, big bitter hop punch, weak malty/dry finish. As it warms, citrus hops become very present up front, and the malt finish deepens into some sugary cake-like flavors.  The malt flavors aren't anywhere near as deep as those of many other American barleywines, but they taste good. The interaction of the huge, DIPA-like hops and the malt is very impressive; more of a marriage of the two than a journey from one to the other.  As the beer warms, the bitterness starts to build up and the finish gets very dry and almost sour. Some dark fruit notes come out, and the sweet malt mirrors the smell almost exactly. Alcohol is not a huge factor in the taste at all.  This was the last bottle of my 6-pack, and it was also the one that delivered the most complex and satisfying flavor. I'm thinking that perhaps I needed to get used to the hop assault, though I did still find the depth of the malt to be lacking. Would be very interested to taste this beer with a couple years on it. (4.0)  Mouthfeel: Pretty carbonated and bitter. Kind of heavy and sticky, yet finishes dry. Not bad, but not particularly pleasant either. (3.5)  Drinkability: For its ABV, the alcohol is not aggressive at all. On the one hand, I think I'd normally rather a great DIPA or a deeper, maltier barleywine. On the other hand, the chances of me picking up a few more 6packs of this before it's off the shelves are high. (4.0)  I guess Bigfoot is an excellent American barleywine if what you're looking for is a DIPA with a little more malt backbone than most. Myself, I want an American barleywine to be a hop assault with deep, lush malty/caramely flavors that are big enough to contend with the hops. Nonetheless, it's a quality beer that I'll happily drink again.  ---  2009 vintage, poured into a wine glass. Reviewed June 29, 2010.  Appearance: Pours a dark, hazy reddish amber, with decent lacing and a bonewhite, steadily dissipating head. Same as fresh.  Smell: Piny, grassy, herbal hops and some caramel and raisin. Nice.  Taste: Very rich, but still retains a surprisingly strong hop bitterness. Lots of caramel and dark fruit (raisin)... these are the big malt flavors I was looking for when I had this beer fresh. It's recognizably the same beer as when it's fresh, but remarkably deeper; a year has done way more to the flavor than I expected (I just thought the hops would fade and it might get a little sweeter). Beautiful smoky raisin and caramel flavors.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, not quite creamy, a tiny bit sugary. Moderate carbonation. The dryness is gone.  Drinkability: The high alcohol content is still nowhere to be found, but now huge, beautiful barleywine flavors are coming out to play with the still resonant hops.  I had no idea time would treat this beer so well... I guess that's what everyone was talking about. I didn't intend to rereview this beer, but from the first sip of a 2009 bottle I was strongly won over, and felt I should update my lukewarm (though already positive) review. I would bet this beer is at its best with about 2 years on it. I know I'll be searching around for some 2010s to put away for awhile.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,beavers,3.2,"Bigfoot 2010.  Pours a cherry brown with a creamy and frothy light khaki head. Clumps of sticky lacing. Smell is not very strong initially, but as it warms it smells of sticky, resiny, piny hops, and big booze. Subtle grapefruit notes. Taste is candy sugar sweet, nutty, caramel malt, honey, piercingly sharp, herbal, piney hop bitterness, and....booze. Don't get me wrong, I love hops. But this bitterness is overtly astringent and the alcohol is all over the place, making this one hot mess. Mouthfeel is medium/full bodied, syrupy, and overly carbonated. Sweet and cloying.

Leaves a creamy layer of foam just across the top of the brew for the entire time it sits out.  Smell: biscuity and malty, with hints of toffee and caramel.  Taste: Overwhelmingly hoppy, with malts and other sweet notes in the background just about entirely covered up. I would love to see what some age would do for this one. As it warms, the hop tastes are still huge, but the sweetness comes out a bit more, and it goes down cool with a spearmint taste.  Mouthfeel: Great carbonation. Medium bodied and goes down smooth like a light syrup. Low carbonation levels work very nicely here.  Drinkability: This one is good here, but the strength and bitterness of the hops makes it one to sip.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,Ricelikesbeer,4.2,"2010 edition  I am jealous. Flat out. After brewing an american style barleywine, and getting no where close to this beer, I'd say its one of my favorate of its style.  A: A filtered-looking amber color, almost orange in light. Nice body on this beer, but not overcarbonated. Very nice sustained thin head.  S: A nice boozy alcohol smell, with some candy and plenty of malt. I can almost smell the munich malt in this beer.  T: Incredible, and very complex. A nice malty, sweet taste upfront. Plenty of alcohol. A sharp bitterness from the hops, but the taste is very balanced. Not a huge hop presence, but its there. Sweet but very dry for a barleywine. Soooo balanced overall.  M: Huge, chewy mouthfeel, very smooth despite the large abv. goes down nice and easy, but there is plenty of body.  D: The alcohol is there, and doesn't let you forget it. It lingers on your palate long after you sip the beer.

A thick tall cream-colored head recedes to a rich collar and a panoply of large bubbles.  Monstrous, pine-heavy aromatics annihilate any subtleties. There is a bready caramel malt undercurrent as well, but it fights a losing battle. Assertive C-hops though not overly sharp or punishing.  Forest floor, fresh rain, and wet loam lead you down a path to the mid-palate, where a slumbering storm of grapefruit, granola, orange pith and scalded brown sugar await.

Sweet, hoppy, sticky, citrus, alcohol, woody? This is quite a complex beast. What an intriguing brew. The flavors are blended nicely, but there's no getting around the alcohol uppercut that is delivered effectively with every drink.  M: Sticky sweetness coats the mouth.

140,2671,Buckmaister,3.56,"Appearence: a maroon color that you can barely see through, a 2-finger head (dense) which shrinks to half it's size but stays that way, a good bit of lacing left over, a few bubbles seen rising  Smell: a slight bitterness/hops..nothing in particular standing out here  Taste: slightly sweet to bitter taste as liquid moves from front to back of mouth, and a smokey/bitter taste which lingers at the back of your throat and gradually builds as you drink more...a dry taste, not particularly tasty in my opinion but not offensive either  Mouthfeel: smooth upon first sip but as you swallow you can feel the slight carbination at the back of your throat, slightly syrupy  Drinkability: for this style of beer it's fine. I've tasted smoother drinks with the same ABV and also drinks I struggle to finish with about have the ABV.  Thoughts: Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is one of my favorite beers so when I saw this on the shelf I couldn't resist.

Smell - Sweet scents of honey and sweet floral hops with a little malt detected. Nice.  Taste - Sweet and fruity up front, with good citrus and pine hops on the finish. Typical to a Barleywine, it's very sweet and the high ABV can be detected with it's warming effect and slight alcohol taste, but definitely well balanced with the other flavors.  Mouthfeel - A little syrupy, also typical of Barleywines, but creamy carbonation helps to balance it.  Drink - Very drinkable, a delicious example of an American Barleywine. At the relatively high ABV of 9.6, a few of these go a long way. A great beer for doing a session of 3 or 4 beers. Will definitely buy this again!

Quite bitter throughout with an earthy, planty flavor from the hops. Towards the end, a bit of malt comes through but again this is in the background.

140,2671,Genuine,4.37,"2010 edition here. Poured from the bottle into my clean sam adam's perfect pint glass.  Poured a very nice...deep amber/red in color...with an off white head. Amazing lacing. Very beautiful to look at.  Smell - the nose on this one..is quite to talk about. Very fresh, very piney, some citrus notes.  Taste - this is where the beer all comes together. Right off the bat, i knew that this was not a lower alc. % beer. I buddy of mine thought it was but I figured it would be around the 8-9% mark. But, this beer...was so crisp, and full of flavor, that it pretty much masked the alcohol. The alcohol did come out a bit more as it warmed up, but not unpleasantly so.  Mouthfeel - This one is medium, a bit syrupy as well, I thought. I loved the carbonation in this one. Well done.  Drinkability - I could definitely have a couple of these without any problems. I saved 2 of the bottles to age so, I can't wait to crack those open when the time comes.  ---  Bigfoot 2011 Review -  Poured from the bottle into my Sam Adams sensory glass. This beer pours a beautiful...dark amber, which fades to deep mahogany red. On top of this body sits a very nice 2-3 finger head that sticks around for the whole ride. it's a nice cream in color.  Smell - an abundance of hops hits the nose first. Followed by some dark fruit malts, apples/ syrupy malty goodness.  Taste - I can see how this differs from a 1 year matured 2010 bigfoot. Everything is there and it's big and crisp and in your face. Some bitterness of the hops, then you get the hit of the alcohol at 9.6%, but it's not just that straight alcohol flavor, it reminds me of some roasted apples, dark, deep and complex. Some residual sweetness right at the very end of the finish.  Mouthfeel - Medium to full. The carbonation is delightful, perfect for this one.  Overall - I think this is another sucessfull barlywine from SN.  The 2010 big foot has flavors that have all meddled together and rounded out, where this 2011 big foot fresh, while delicious, should be even better with a year on it. Fresh bigfoot is a bit spikey, but with a year on it, everything will mesh well and round out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Poofy soufflé head, raised in the middle with striated sheets clinging to the sides.  Pungent pine, herbaceous aroma, also a rich and sweet toffee malt element. Looks and smells the part of a good barleywine.  Smooth with a dry bitter edge, this is very balanced but hop-forward. It's big all around, but the sum of it's parts fit well together. Sticky toffee and caramel laced with pine and resinous hops. Rich and not too boozy. Probably not for the hop-novice, but i've come to appreciate it more as a full fledged hop head.

Hops are ever present, somewhat mellowed, still leafy and bitter. Some citrus rind, spicy with clean heat, and sprucey touches at the end. Long finish of herbal hops that coats the throat.

140,2671,eternaljester81,4.82,"Along with Founders, I consider Sierra Nevada as one of my two favorite breweries. Torpedo is one of, if not my favorite IPAs, and topped my list of favorite SN brews. Notice my use of the word ""topped"", as in past-tense.  I honestly wasn't expecting what I got with Bigfoot. I like to think of myself as a fan of barley wines, but more than anything I'm a hophead, so I was quite excited to try this beer. I poured my first bottle into a New Belgium snifter - little did I know of the sheer awesomeness that would soon caress my tongue.  A - Pours a beautiful burnt orange/brown with a solid, creamy, one-inch head. The head slowly settles into a rocky fluff, leaving sticking lacing at every interval.  S - Holy crap! I was blown away by the floral, pungent smell of hops. Lots and lots of hops. A deep inhale reveals the high ABV with a bit of an astringency, while there's an inkling of sweetness in the middle, but overall the nose is all hops. My mouth was watering at this point.  T - And I thought the smell was impressive. Wow, the bitter hops are all over this beer. The only thing keeping Bigfoot from being an all-out hopbomb is the excessive malts (which still don't quite exceed in balancing the beer out). Hell, who am I kidding, this is pretty much a hopbomb, and I love it! The high ABV is surprisingly well hidden, and as it warms the sweetness of the malts shine through to a greater extent. Regardless, just like the nose, the hops are the star.  M - The mouthfeel is (very) slightly thin for the style, but it still holds up quite well. The most noticeable aspect is the slick, oiliness from the hops, which makes this very big brew go down very smoothly.  D - This is where Bigfoot is crazy dangerous. At over 9% ABV, this beer goes down so easily, that it's easy to get lost in it. By the time you know it, you've lost sight of how many you've enjoyed (and pretty much everything else). Be warned!  I was expecting a very good beer in Bigfoot, but what I got is my new favorite brew from one of my two favorite breweries. While I think, at this point in its age, this is much more in line with a DIPA, it doesn't matter - Bigfoot is unbelievable regardless of style. This is the reaction I was hoping to have to Hopslam (which is still very good, just a little disappointing).  Bottom line: Bigfoot is beyond awesome!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,JohnPecod,3.88,A - a cloudy amber with some hues of gold and virtually no head as you would expect.  S - A hint of the trademark Sierra tea hops with a hint of caramel sweetness but everything is taking a backseat to the downright boozie odor. Not a ton of complexity...yet.  T - Follows the nose. Young and boozie with a hoppy alcohol kick on the finish that almost makes you want to that arm move people do after they take a shot of whiskey.  M - Surprisingly light and carbonated with some coating creaminess.  O - Ah the dilemma of grading a beer on its current state or its potential. Since I've had the pleasure of sipping on many Bigfoot vintages going back to the Clinton Administration I'm going to opt for the latter. This is a raw rookie with loads of potential that shows flashes of brilliance but still needs time to develop.

A &#8211; It poured a deep copper hue, with still a bit of foam.  S &#8211; Smells strongly malty, with notes of rum-raisin, assorted dark/dried fruits, toffee, sherry and malt vinegar. It is quite similar to the 1991 Thomas Hardy I just had, but dialed down a few notches.  T &#8211; Amazing. The hops are still plenty discernible, adding a spicy, herbal punch to a very richly malty base. The flavor has deepened and seriously intensified, with the olfactory elements being present at significant volumes in the gustatory. Again, the taste is similar to the nineteen year old Thomas Hardy's Ale that I just drank, plus hops  M &#8211; Still good carbonation...  D &#8211; A worthwhile endeavor, cellaring the Bigfoot... thanks JP.  4/5/5/5/5=4.8  ***  I don&#8217;t remember it ever tasting as good as 2010! I think 2010 Bigfoot is the hop-star this year.  Also, this beer goes a long way towards restoring my confidence in SN, in light of the debacle of the soapish / perfume-y 13th Wet Hop Harvest Ale.  A &#8211; Deep copper, and a decent but quickly receding head, very sticky lacing.  S &#8211; A hop bomb; the most deliciously herbal, piney, dank and resiny hops are first and foremost in the nose; only the most subdued caramel malt is apparent, seemingly existing purely for the sake of balance. I like it. I don&#8217;t appreciate an overload of caramel, in the aroma or taste, and far too often American Barleywine is syrupy sweet with caramel malt; this beer avoids such a pitfall.  T &#8211; Tons of herbal hoppy goodness. Tastes awesome; the specific hops used are so ridiculously pleasing to both the olfactory and gustatory senses that it begs comparison to the best of the DIPA style (Hopslam, etc.) The beer has a first kick of well-balanced hop and malt, mostly piney, followed by a astringent bitter herbal kick, and wrapping with a grapefruit-citric and dank mouth-watering pucker. As I said, I prefer more hop, less malt from American Barleywine; this is a well-allocated brew.  M &#8211; On the full side of medium, sharp enough, smooth enough, a tad slick from all the hops.  D &#8211; Oh yeah, but drink it slow, it is deceptive&#8230;  I believe this review gives me my mug. Time to fill it!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Fresh out of a brand new 12 oz bottle into a snifter  A- A very nice dark amber ruby color, small off white tan head that receded fairly quickly and left a ring around the glass and lacing.  S- Smells very hoppy with fruit - maybe some pineapple, maybe some grapefruit or darker fruits. The smell on this one reminds me of an IPA  T- Starts sweet, maybe from the fruity hops, maybe from the caramel malts, at first, but it is quickly overpowered by a hoppy bitterness. This bitterness stays with, with an afterbite of alcohol  M- Smooth, good carbonation  D- A very hoppy BW.

140,2671,steve8robin,4.33,"Found this at a local beer store. Was happy to see it...  A: Very good look. Deep dark ruby color with a 1 inch off white head that disappates perfectly. Not too fast or too slow. Very good looking.  S: I can smell this as soon as I poured it. Smells good. Very malty and hoppy with hints of brown sugars.  T: Tastes good. Malty upfront with a very hoppy tastes in the middle. Grapefruit backend with hidden notes of brown sugars. Good tasting.  M: Perfect amount of carbonation.  D: Goes down super easy. Despite the heavy hoppiness, the fact that the hoppiness is in the middle of the flavor makes this pefectly easy to drink.  All in all, this is a very good brew. Glad I finally got to try this. I was surprised. Good for those who like hops and grapefruit flavor. If that's you, buy a 6 pack.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,brewerburgundy,3.99,"12oz bottle of 2010 Bigfoot, goblet.  Proper deep, ruddy copper, earthy red with a creamy tan head sitting up top. A very nice inch of head formed on a patient pour and the retention looks to be good. Beautiful sheets of lace are appearing.  The aroma isn't an explosion. It is reserved and expected. Hop resin weaving between rind and pine character with quality malts in the background.  The mouth is zapped with astringent grapefruit before some sweet and grainy malt makes itself apparent. Finish is softened but bitter with some soapiness.  This 2010 on the palate doesn't have the weight of its abv. It could be perceived as slightly oily. The carbonation is well contained and clean, which I appreciate.  Compared to 2009 Bigfoot with ten months on it, on tap, this seems lacking in complexity. I have no reason to doubt that this will develop equally. That 2009 just had the most wonderful chocolate note. The alcohol doesn't make a showing, which translates to great drinkability. Like many before me, this should probably be viewed as an Imperial IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,EJNibs,3.42,"Appearance: Really deep, ruddy-brown when held up to the light, but against a black backdrop it looks almost like a stout. One finger of head that dissipates after about a minute with minimal lacing.  Aroma: Great. Really bright floral hops up front (so much so that I was a bit surprised) with a strong malt back. Sweeter malt tones, more sugarcane than biscuit I'd say.  Taste: Very nice strong sweet malt up front that fades to alcohol warming, but comes back in a lingering finish at the very end (maybe 10 seconds after taking a sip). My problem here is that it's all at the very beginning and the very end, the middle and most of the finish are dominated by alcohol warmth. While I smell the hops' florality (is that a word? I just really didn't want to have to say ""floweriness"") it is mostly obscured by the alcohol. Maybe 20% of the sips I took had a hint of hops in the finish, but not most.  Mouthfeel: I was a bit surprised by this beer's mouthfeel. I was expecting a bit more robust, chewy, smooth and heady beer, but the carbonation is a bit more aggressive and the fullness just isn't there. Nearing the end I enjoyed it better, but I'm not sure that lettng a beer lose some of it's carbonation for a good mouthfeel is ideal  Drinkability: Not drinkable at all. Or, rather, not sessionable at all. My roommate and I tried this at the same time on a Sunday afternoon: it took us both about an hour to finish 12 oz and he immediately took a nap afterward. You can order this one to avoid buying a second drink at the pub, but that's really the only virtue here.  Verdict: If you're a fan of barley-wines, it's worth trying Actually, maybe even if you aren't a fan it's worth trying, as I'd say this is (though not out of this world) a good intro to the style. I wouldn't say it's the best of this style that I've ever had, but it's not bad, and to be fair, it is a bit green, and might be better with a year or two of age on it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Fresh hops, Quality malt. This is my style barleywine.  T - Roasted malts backed with a strong hop backbone. Almost tastes more like a DIPA. Love SN's take on a barleywine here. Absolutely theraputic.  M - The citrus from the hops smooths this one out for me. Carbonation seems high for a barleywine. I'm going to age a couple of these monsters I'm betting it'll grow into a whole new animal.  D - This is a drinkable beverage for almost hitting 10 on the abv scale.

This bottle is very fresh so there was still hops on the aroma as soon as I opened the bottle. Lots of plum and dark fruits. Predominately toasty malt profile with a bitter hop finish. Not much hop flavor on the palate but the bitterness leaves a big impression on the tongue. Mouthfeel is good. Nothing stands out too much.

140,2671,JohnL9013,4.47,"For those familiar with the Stone ""Double Bastard Ale"", this beer will be perfect for you.  A: Great appearance overall, cloudy, and barely transparent. Mediocre head with moderate lacing.  S: Wow, I walked away from my beer to toss the bottle in the recycling across the kitchen and the smell quickly consumed the kitchen and followed me.  T: The taste is exceptional, no doubt about it. This is not a true barleywine, but it is most certainly an exeptional ""American Strong Ale"" as this is very similar to Stone's Arrogant and Double Bastard Ales. This beer is a flat-out terrific value. I believe I got it for under $2.00 for a single 12 oz. bottle. Expect roasted malts of the highest quality. Absolutely delicious.  M: The mouthfeel could definitely stand to be improved. This beer doesn't sit well in the mouth because it's just not as smooth as it needs to be to achieve perfection like Stone's Double Bastard has. The alcohol only exaggerates the slight sourness to the beer. It also has a slight astringency. I bet aging would improve this.  D: This is still a very drinkable beer for being a 10%er.

140,2671,MbpBugeye,3.39,"Lots of talk goin on about this one right now. This is my first Bigfoot so we will see how the talk stands up...  A- Really dark ruby red in my snifter. You can barely see through this beer. Big sandy, fluffy head perched atop. At this point the head seems unwavering. But it eventually faded leaving all sorts of lace.  S- Much like a DIPA... Nearly all hops, well not exactly... There is a nice caramel, toasty malt bill underneath. But if the fact that this is a Sierra Nevada (West Coast) beer didn't tip you off that this will be hoppy, then the nose definitely will.  T- hmm. Hoppy AND malty. A bomb on either end of the scale. This is one pretty big beer. Starts caramely and toasty and leads into some really piney hops. The finish is of course hoppy and biting but not before more of that malty goodness comes through. Very nice battle between bitter and sweet.  M- Fluffy, smooth and approaching thick, but not quite. Fairly clean finish, but lots of hop oils still linger.  D- Obviously going to be a bitter, hopped up barleywine, but that is to the style as this is an American west coast barleywine. The booze is nearly nonexistent in the flavor but the effects are soon felt.

The brew itself is a dark brown murky color, reminiscent of an oude bruin. The smell is immensely appetizing - burnt sugar, cinnamon, and dark licorice - hints of anise as well. Extremely rich in flavor - somewhat phenolic but plenty of interesting flavors going on - butter, toffee, raisins, and impossible to ignore that nice hoppiness that still seems to be holding strong after so long in my cellar.

140,2671,crossovert,3.56,"2010 vintage.  Pours with a large off-white head that leaves sticky lacing as it dissipates. The beer is red with a hint of orange.  The smell is different than most barleywines, because this is the first barleywine I have had fresh, I'm probably going to age the rest of my 6pack, but I wanted to get a taste of how this beast is fresh. It is moderately hoppy with a huge malt presence and a bit of odd smell.  It is mildly carbonated with a big thick mouthfeel. The hops here aren't my cup of tea and they dominate the flavor at this point. The seem like bitter but mildly flavored English hops which are always my least favorite. The malt is buried underneath the fresh hops. This one will need some time to age.  Overall it isn't bad in it's current state, reminds me of the Sprecher English DIPA, it will get much better I can tell, this is a great base.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,llllDrGONZOllll,4.47,This was a great score at my local beer dist. This little devil was bottled 2 years ago. This is my first time reviewing it but thinking back to the time I had a fresh one I thought it to be a tad too much for me...times has changed this ale! Quite possibly time has no doubt changed my pallet as well.  Thick tan head rest atop a beautiful deep dark red body. Transparent enough when held to the light that carbonation and yeast can be seen floating throughout. The head has began to recede and left a tan collar reminding me of how quickly this brew is going down and the size of the quaffs taken. I am basking in wonderful aromas of raisins and fruit cake with hints of barley and caramel. The smell if very inviting. Deep caramel tastes a plenty a toasty tastes slides in beneath the strong cling of hop bitterness. It is almost a shame to rush to the next sip because the strong aftertaste is so enjoyable. Right now i could really go for some fine Lindt dark chocolate. Luckily I found a piece of 89% cocoa and will be pairing the two quite soon.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,dwilson01,4.53,"Just saw this bad boy in the store the other day so I thought I'd pick up a six pack after work today...needless to say I am GLAD that I did and I haven't even tasted this beer yet.  Poured out into an arrogant bastard pint glass, solid thumb-width of head which sticks around for a while. Kind of a cross between the super dense frothy head I find on their celebration ale and their standard pale. It looks awesome, I mean this thing has an appearance all to itself which gives it some individual character right off the bat. Darker than an amber but not at all the same look as a porter or stout it's either dark dark red or a light light porter.  Got a good whiff out of the bottle after I poured it, smelled pretty standard Sierra Nevada. Solid floral hop aroma, but once poured it became a more subdued foresty smell.  The first thing that comes to mind about the taste is the strongness of the flavoring couple with the thickness of the beer. Very malty, I can see where the darker color comes from for sure but it's balanced very nicely with some sweeter hops and Sierra Nevada uses only the best hops to be sure! Best way to describe it after a couple of tastes is a super strong initial flavor where I get solid malt, almost like a nut brown ale but much more in your face. After you let it sit for a second it mellows out and the sweeter more floral and foresty tasting hops come into play which completely eliminate the small hint of alcohol flavor I got at the beginning. It ends with a combined sweetness from all of it's elements, I get some honey in there as well. What surprised me the most about the finish was how smooth it was, it was seriously as smooth as most porters and stouts i've had albeit not as thick bodywise.  Bottom line, this is a great beer I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of strong ales and barleywines for sure and to most people who generally like beer..you know who you are!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Jmoore50,4.71,"I just discovered I have never reviewed this fantastic beer. Well I have a fresh 2010 in front of me, so I figured this would be a good 200th review.  The appearance is beautiful, a dark stained cherry wood color that is so clean and pure it makes me weep. It gives good head, something I really appreciate. It pours a three finger white frothy head that just sticks to everything it touches. The head never really goes away, it just gets a bit smaller and leaves a fat lacing. It has everything I want in appearance, good color, good head, good alcoholic legs, good lacing.  The smell is of strong citrus hops and sweet bready malts. A bit of cherries as well.  The taste is of strong fruity hops paired with very sweet caramel malts. There are cherries and peaches and lemon peel with an earthy flavor. Strong wisps of alcohol come in different waves. Apricots and plumbs in some aftertastes. This is fairly fruity with so much backbone. Perfectly balanced on the palate and incredibly drinkable. I love this beer for everything it stands for. It is not too strong, 9.6% ABV, and it is not thrown in any barrels. This is just another example of why Sierra Nevada deserves to be the top brewery in the country.

140,2671,onemanarne,3.68,"First review, finally. I've been extremely curious about Barleywines for some time now, but never come across something that seemed affordable and delicious enough. Until now. Got a 6 pack for $10 at fred meyer. As a hophead and SN fan, I figured this was my best first try with a barleywine. I think I was right.  A- Dark amber. A little darker than most DIPA's. Thick, sticky off white head.  S- Lots of sweet malts, lots of hops. I was expecting more of a hop smell, smells pretty balanced.  T- BAM. Lots of hops and lots of malts. It's like the best of both worlds just exploded all over the inside of your mouth. As a first time Barleywine drinker and IPA/DIPA lover, I like it a lot. It has that hop bitterness and delicious taste I'm always wanting, yet it's balanced out but definitely not canceled out by the big malty presence. Pretty sweet, but really not overpowering. Really long finish, first numbed by the alcohol and then you get hit with sweet malts and then bitter hops. Jeez. Better than I expected. I wouldn't say it's much more boozy than 90 minute IPA. Quite simply, delicious and a must try. I'm probably gonna age one of these, out of curiosity.  D- Very good, considering the 9.6% ABV. Not chuggable, not a sipper because of the shear deliciousness, but a nice quaffer. You'll realize you probably don't wan't very many unless you're just trying to get tanked.

140,2671,woosterbill,4.21,"12oz, 2010 bottle into a Duvel tulip on 1/29/10.  A: A vigorous pour delivers a clear mahogany body with some fine particulates in suspension underneath a billowing head of frothy tan foam that fills the tulip to the perfect stage of near-overflowing. Retention is off the charts, and as the head recedes it leaves the thickest covering of lace that I've ever seen. Phenomenal looking beer.  S: Smooth pine-centric hops up front, followed by some light floral notes. A little bit of mildly spicy malt comes through toward the end.  T: Hops start this off nicely, followed by smooth, rich, and complex maltiness - toffee, caramel, and candied fruits, and some nice spice rounding things out before the slightly boozy finish. Even super-fresh (it just came in yesterday), this is a very smooth and balanced barleywine. I can't wait to see how it ages.  M: Sticky full body with moderate carbonation.  D: Doesn't do much to hide the alcohol, but the generous hops bitterness keeps things fairly crisp. Definitely drinkable for a barleywine.  Notes: I've only had this beer fresh (over several of the last few vintages), and it's always blown me away with its great hops/malt balance. I can't wait to see how this one develops over the years.  Addenda:  1. Brief notes on a fairly fresh bottle of the '11, 3/13/11: just as gorgeous as last year, and a bit more hop-centric (and floral) on the nose (even though I'm reviewing this one less instantaneously). The malts definitely make their presence felt, but in a more straightforwardly sweet, brown sugar kind of way. A little harsh with the hops bitterness, but still delicious. Not boozy at all, but still a bit of challenge to drink. Overall I think I preferred the balance of last year's vintage, but I think this one has just as much potential for aging.  2. I just did my first Bigfoot (mini-)vertical, comparing 2011 and 2010 bottles on 3/26/11. The other tasters and I all agreed that the 2010 was hugely superior in every way except perhaps appearance, where they were identical (perhaps a bit more head on the 2011, but that may have been the pours). The 2010 had a big, rich nose redolent of candied fruit, toffee, and spice, while the 2011 was surprisingly subdued in the nose - just some piney hops. Flavorwise, the difference was almost as extreme, with the 2011 tasting like a mediocre DIPA in comparison to the 2010's barleywine decadence. I definitely won't be opening another 2011 for quite a while, but I'd say that 2010's are hitting their stride beautifully.

140,2671,biboergosum,4.2,"12oz bottle at Bar Volo (adjacent to the sunny windows on a surprisingly gentle winter's day in Toronto) - not exactly a common brewer to find on this side of the 49th.  This beer pours a clear, dark burnt orange-brick amber colour, with three fingers of puffy, densely foamy, and rocky beige head, which leaves a mess of chunky lace around the glass upon its leisurely retreat.  It smells strongly of fleshy citrus, bready and doughy caramel malt, a hint of biscuity toffee, some testy spruce pine, free-range brown sugars, ephemeral earthy yeast, and a mild, but still threatening boozy edginess. The taste is pungently citrusy and piney hop oils, a solid caramel/toffee malt backbone, dry vanilla pods, a hint of tanned leather, and some subtle earthy mustiness, all with a buzzing booziness hovering in the background.  The carbonation is nice and reserved in its merely supportive frothiness, the body rather smooth, thick, and kind of viscous, even with all that hoppiness flitting about. It finishes well off-dry, and yet clean - sweet, yes, but still damned hoppy for a barleywine of any ilk.  Overall, a patently enjoyable, and dare I say drinkable American barleywine, especially if you're into that sort of palate-abusing treatment.

Great head retention, a loose speckily lace over the glass. The head just sat in lumps throughout the session, awesome appearance.  Smells very hoppy, with fruits, pineapple and hints of ripe dark fruits. So fruity though almost smells like an IPA. Outstanding really.  Big hop bite to this one, as to be expected from SN. Any sweetness at first is pretty much drowned out by the bitterness. Although getting better as it warms, a nice caramelly sweet taste.  Very velvety and smooth. Wonderful mouth-feel.

140,2671,DanOLeary,3.61,"Aroma: Surprisingly up front is a moderately strong citrus hop aroma. Like grapefruit and orange peel. Subtle malts are present in the aroma with some melanoidin character, as well as a hint of alcoholic spice.  Appearance: A crystal clear ruby red that in a way borders on burnt orange. There is a small amount of sediment left in the bottle, but if this is a bottle conditioned beer it pours incredibly clear. During the pour a thick, three-fingered head formed. It faded reasonably slowly to a short and creamy off white head, though a great deal of lacing is left behind on the glass.  Flavor: Caramel malt sweetness greets the tongue at first but is quickly pushed away with assertive citrus hop bitterness that dominates the tongue and overall flavor. The oily hop character lasts into the center of the flavor profile before the beer finishes with an assertive and spicy alcoholic bite. The hops come back again once more with the bite of grapefruit rind.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with high carbonation, like pin pricks across your tongue. There is a slight stickiness in the middle but this is quickly dried out with hop bitterness before the beer finishes with a warming, in fact quite a hot alcoholic presence. In the finish there is a strong emphasis of this alcoholic presence, but the hops really come back again with a resin like character. There's quite a tenacious bitterness throughout.  Overall: This is an extremely hoppy example of a Barley Wine Style Ale. If Sierra Nevada had written ""Double IPA"" on the bottle instead, I'd be convinced it was such. For a Barley Wine I feel this is overly hopped and doesn't have the malt richness I expect to back it all up. The hop bitterness dominates the palate, the flavor and the nose. For a Barley Wine where hop bitterness may be moderately strong to aggressive, it misses the mark on the fact that there is very little malt character. You really have to look for it to find the barley. This beer doesn't just lean toward hops, it stands upon them.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The finish is raisins as well as a hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is full bodied and there is a crispness. Overall, quite an impressive barleywine from SN.

140,2671,FoodBlog,4.06,"Had a 2008 bottle. A bit hoppy for the style, in my opinion, but overall a valiant effort at producing the true ""champagne of beers"".  Aromas of freshly cooked waffles hit you before your first sip. The miniscule bubbles do not do much in the glass, but they blanket the tongue in an effervescent welcome. Definitely sweet, but balanced (perhaps overly) with an abundant dose of hops. The subtle fruitiness I like in Barley Wine (at least the ones I make) is diminished in the hoppiness. Still, flavors of caramel and maderized fruit make their way into the flavor profile.  This beer would definitely be the one to have with a nice after dinner cigar, and perhaps some lamb stew or beef with blue cheese. I used it to braise some Honey Mustard Spare Ribs, and it was perfect for that. Some might consider it a waste of great beer, but all cooks I know like to use good wine and spirits when cooking, and good beer should be given the same honor.

140,2671,MeisterBurger,4.2,"2009 bottle.  Pours a dark, lightly chill-hazed rusty color topped by a substantial, creamy light beige head. Laces and retains amazingly.  If, like me, you have an unquestioning love of beers dry-hopped with citrusy west coast c-hops then this is the barleywine for you. Simply awesome. And yet underneath this lurks some wonderfully rich caramel notes with hints of chocolate.  The taste is a deep, richly sweet caramel malt quickly met by a massive punch of grapefruit pith and piney bitterness. This is beyond full flavored. Licorice notes and pepper are present at well. Definitely far more bitter than any barleywine I have ever had. Alcohol is present and warming but not in the least bit overpowering and well hidden by the tongue-slapping bitterness.  Mouthfeel is slick, chewy and a little syrupy but a goodly amount of carbonation helps lift that from the palate.  This is far more bitter than I anticipated, which makes it a very intense and interesting experience, but this isn't one I could drink more than a bottle of in any one sitting.  I picked up a sixer of this and I'll lay down at least three. I'd like to see how this is once the bitterness fades and the flavors meld.

Pours a dark amber, very murky. Tiny head that is gone in a blink of an eye. No lacing.  Aroma of some fruit (pear), piney hops, caramel and some molasses.  Flavor is quite strong, more hops, malt, caramel, molasses, some chocolate. Rather sweet. I'm sure there is more here, too.  Initially was moderately carbonated, but as I get further into the glass, there is not really any carbonation left at all. Syrupy mouthfeel, but not quite chewy. You taste some alcohol, but it is not overbearing.  There is a lot going on with this brew, and I will definitely have to try some other barleywines.

Pours copper/red in a nonic with a large 3+ finger fluffy and rocky very light beige head which maintains a foamy cap and leaves clumps of sticky lacing. Sure doesn't look like a normal barleywine.  Aroma is sweet, fruity, cherry, citrus and earthy hops, caramel malts.  Flavor is predominantly sweet, cherry and other dark fruits, caramel malts, earthy resinous hops that bring some bitterness, also a bit of a Robitussin character, ahhh yes, the alcohol, you taste and smell it but it doesn't burn.  Mouthfeel is full, rich, rather carbonated. The big foamy head threw me off at first, but I understand this is quite fresh, and will save most of these for a year or more.

Strong, dried figs and sweet molasses are accompanied by spruce, floral hops and some grapefruit. This one reveals raisins and brandy as it warms.  After nearly three years in the bottle, Bigfoot still puts forth a strong bitter and alcohol profile. Primarily spicy, including pepper, this one has a long, pulsating bitter finish.  A warming, medium-bodied beer with a dry, oily texture and hint of metallic notes.  As expected, this is a sure sipper with a sharp alcohol bite.

This nearly year old beer has a strong citrusy/pine hop aroma to it still backed up by a strong malty caramel with hints of chocolate licquer.  Flavor is certainly big and still rather raw for a nearly year old beer. I find the flavors a bit hard to track down. An initial sharp pungent taste fades to a thick somewhat sweet caramel malt. Hop flavor abounds and is of citrus, muted grapefruit and resin. Also noted are brandied fruit (raisins, apricots, pears) along with vague hints of chocolate noted in the after taste. Alcohol fills the mouth with warmth but does not eclipse the other bold flavors. With warming the alcohol blends nicely into the other flavors.  Mouthfeel is big, thick and chewy with a slightly creamy very smooth finish.  Bigfoot always has an initial kick in the mouth that takes me half a beer or so to really begin appreciating, after that though it just gets better and better as it warms.

Appearance: A nice dark cherry soda color, with a decent straw colored head that laces nicely.  Smell: Malty and sweet. Toasted caramel. Also some pine hops.  Taste: As I expected, this being a Sierra beer, it tastes more like an extremely well-balanced strong IPA than what I think of as a barleywine. That being said, it's delicious. The hops are strong and earthy. That earthy bitterness is nicely balanced by the malt sweetness. I'm picking up freshly baked bread, some of the caramel from the nose, and maybe a hint of bitter chocolate?  Mouthfeel: Goes down smooth. A little more thin than I'd have expected.  Drinkability: I could have a couple of these in a sitting, but it's not as deceptive as some other similar beers in terms of alcohol content. You can definitely taste the booze in this one.

I also taste some distinct caramel and toffee and maybe just a hint of burnt coffee or chocolate. This all adds up to a good amount of sweetness initially.

140,2671,Lldeegan,3.88,"Pours a deep reddish brown, with an off white head that is a bit thin, but expected. The head quickly dissipates a bit and changes to just a foamy surface. The beer all together is very appetizing looking in the glass. This American barleywine smells of sweet bready malt at first, followed by a nice plum and fig fruityness, paired with some hints of licorice. There is an overtone of hops throughout. The sweet malt arrives first on the palate and almost instantly turns to a complex blend of fruit, then licorice, then all the complexity of flavor seems to disappear behind a deep hop bitterness. This has much more hop aroma, flavor and bittering than I had expected from a barleywine, this is clearly where English and American styles differ. I should have known to expect a high dose of greenery from the West coast hop heads at Sierra Nevada. The alcohol is pretty well hidden, there is low heat overall. It is a little more unbalanced than the label claims to be. Just as the Brits are subdued which I enjoyed in the Anchor Old Foghorn Barleywine, the Californians bring that extreme American attitude to this beer. I liked this beer, just not at first. As it warms the hop bitterness rounds out and gives way to a sweeter, more stylistic and smooth finish. This is definitely a sipper of a beer. My opinion on the bottle, is one and done. One note is that the hops remained pretty fresh and biting for a Barleywine that is over a year old, must have been stored pretty well as it is the 2008 edition.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Piny & citric hops, in a way that smells like slightly over-ripe orange. Some malty, cookie-like smells. A very saturated, heavy smell.  Taste is WHOA! A force to be reckoned with, complex in so many ways. I taste the sweet, malty syrup flavors, & the sugary fruits, but it's like they're being held hostage by the hops & alcohol. Woody, lemony, orange, pine. Toward the end of the sip the malt gains some strength & bursts through a little with biscuit, subtle vanilla, even a little fruity (banana?), but then are pounded down again by floral, bitter hops & hot alcohol.  Mouthfeel is big, lots of body & so many movements. Left with a twinge of sweetness around the corners of the mouth, with a broad bitterness across the tongue.  This beer is big in every way, challenging & very complex. There's so much going on, the smooth & the rough almost balance each other out, but it's more like a cycle, each gets its turn, rising & falling. A time-based beer. Can't say I love everything about it, but it's inspiring in its way. Any beer that moves me enough to write this much about it has won my heart. I'll just have the one, thanks.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,weatherdog,4.47,"2008 vintage - Poured into my 20oz tulip  It pours a deep amber/ red with a small less than finger widths head after an aggressive pour.  The smell is this wonderful rich caramel sweet smell with just a little bit of alcohol presence inviting you in. The hop aroma is virtually undetectable compared to a fresh bottle.  The taste starts off with a mild alcohol bite to remind you of its strength then fades away to a sweet malty rich taste and ends crisp and on the dry side. As sweet as the aroma is it finishes well and not cloying in the least.  Mouthfeel is smooth with the exception of the upfront alcohol bite. That upfront taste is subtle though, and needed in a beer of this gravity to remind the drinker that this is a beer to savor and not a sessionable ale.  I've had this beer many times before and I will say that for being the most assessable barleywine available it is an excellent representation. It isn't mind blowing in any way but it is unoffensive and a great beer to sip to relax and unwind after a hard days work. Also in terms of bang for your buck (which is a big factor in my ratings) this beer scores very high. Not many other barley wines you can buy for $10.99/ sixer",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,gford217,4.33,"2008 vintage.  Pours a deep, clear copper with a massive creamy off-white head that sticks to the sides and recedes very slowly to a one-inch head that refuses to go away.  The aroma has plenty of hops left up front, with some oranges and grapefruit coming through up front. There is some caramel malt and toffee sweetness with lots of dark fruits as well.  The taste is more of the same with the caramel malts forming a big sweet backbone on which the citrus and floral hops are still evident, especially in the finish, where there is a piny hop bitterness lingering after each sip. There is also some wood character and plenty of brown sugar as well.  The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and sticky on the palate with hops and sugary sweetness.  One of the better examples of an American barleywine out there. It's got plenty of hops left two years on and is extremely drinkable with no hint of the 9.6% coming through.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

(A)- Pours thick and a cloudy brown/red amber to copper color that produced a larger & foamy 3+finger off white to light yellow head that is slowly dissipating down. All the while is sticking to the sides of the glass leaving behind some sticky webbing.  (S)- Deep/rich & sweet caramel & toffee raisin figs with a piney butterscotch background.  (T)- Massively dry with caramelized pineapple and grapefruit citrus. Bits of toffee & butterscotch sum up the malt profile. Let this warm up a bit; it only gets better actually.  (M)- Very robust with a big sweetness and a dry puckered citrus. Great carbonation level with a relatively great balance between all the rich characteristics. Has a little boozy warmth as it goes down but is fitting for this beer.  (D)- Up there with the best barleywines I have ever had, especially when it comes to the best bang for your buck(value).

A good bit of yellowish tan head forming a soft blanket on top, which dissipated quickly.  S: A sticky sweet fruit flavor dominates.. Dried apricots, strawberry and apple. Then the hops.. bitter and earthy.  T: A nice surprise. Ripened fruit and a burnt caramelized flavor up front, which then fade into a bitter hops finish.. Ends with a bit of a mineral taste.  M: Thick, sweet, and sticky.  D: Definitely good. I thought this was going to be an overhopped mess from when I opened the bottle, but the sweetness really balances out the bitter hop flavor.

Smell: Beautiful scent of strong, spicy hops, in-your-face sweet malts and some earthy grains.  Taste: Poweful sweet malts with a huge, but deliciously pleasant hop bitterness. This is excellent. For such a potent beer, it's so well-balanced and enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and not as heavy as you'd expect from the taste. The hop bitterness lingers for awihle, but in a good way.  Drinkabillity: As great as this beer is, I usually don't drink more than one or two at a time. As far as barleywines go, though, this is one of the more drinkable ones I've had.  Overall, this is one of my favorite brews and I always try to keep some in my fridge as long as they're available. It's got such powerful flavor without being overpowering, because it's so superbly balanced. I'm enjoying one with breakfast right now, if that's any indication of how good this beer is.

140,2671,BeerForMuscle,4.19,"A - Nice dark amber shade. Lumpy tan head.  S - This one smells wonderful. You get spicy hop aroma, fruity notes and citrus, and earthy grains in your nose.  T - Huge delicious hop flavor without being overly spicy or dry. Dark sugar, dired fruit and sweet sap are there as well. You can taste the alcohol in the finish. The combination of loads of hops, and plenty of sweet and earthy tastes make this brew complex and enthralling to the tastebuds.  M - This beer is so smooth and appeases the mouth. Not too carbonated, not too dry, not too sweet, not overbearing with alcohol flavor even amidst the high abv.  D - I'm not sure there is another beer with this abv that is as easy to drink. Bigfoot is super creamy smooth and packed with huge flavors. More than one is needed to get your fill of this brew.  Notes - I got a 6 pack of this stuff just to try something new and didn't realize what i was about to get into. I hadn't read up on it prior to my purchase and I was blown away.

Now I do like a number of DIPAs I ve tried such as Great Divide most notably but I thought that the brutal hop bitterness and very dry aftertaste was clashing with my concept of a Barley Wine - one of my all time favourite styles.

140,2671,donniecuffs,4.62,"Let me preface this review by saying that I do not usually care for barleywines. Not that the style is a bad one, but moreso because I find that brewers in general tend to make this style so syrupy and sweet that it makes me feel like I am drinking flavored maple syrup.  Anyway, I recently sampled the 2004 vintage on tap, and it was delightful. It poured a nice reddish-brown, with a thin off-white head, little lacing, and little carbonation, if any. The smell was a poutpourri of both dark fruit (date, raisin, plum) and citrus (red orange, lime, pink grapefruit), as well as some malty biscuit, and the flavor revealed all of these in more generous quantities. However the flavor was not overpoweringly sweet, and the mouthfeel, while thick-bodied, was not syrupy. This might be one of the only sessionable barleywines I have ever come across, but of course beware the alcohol content.  Final note...of course the five year-old nature of this brew most likely smoothened out the feel and flavor, so I'd like to try and sample a more recent vintage to discern the aging effect.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Great lacing and aroma, much hoppier than expected, also more alcohol taste than expected, but both have mellowed just a bit from fresh Bigfoot.

Nice swirling white cap with a good foamy ring around the glass. Carbonation is visible and looks delicious. Smell is still pretty aggressive and it's been almost 2 years (not that thats a bad thing). Booze, malts, caramel, and hops, bit of dark fruit in there too. Taste kicks like the nose: alcohol, caramel, hops have faded a bit, dark fruits (a bit plumlike). Mouthfeel provides a nice contrast with its creamy smoothness. Much silkier than I remember this beer being with a fullness to it that is hard to come by.

The aroma is a blend of spicy and citrusy American hops and dark fruit, toffee, and caramelized sugars.  Pine, spice, and citrus rind hit the palate first with crystal malts following close behind. Flavors of raisin and caramelized sugar can be found through the assault of raw, aggressive hops. The beer finishes with some lingering sweetness and a strong bitterness on the back of the tongue. Alcohol is only barely apparent through the other intense flavors in this brew.  A great American barleywine and a benchmark for the style.

140,2671,nomomentwasted,4.38,"Had this out of a bottle last night, poured into a pint glass from a 12-ounce bottle. 2008 vintage, the 25th Expedition.  Appearance: Beautiful, beautiful beer. I would go as far as to say gorgeous. Lacing is clumpy and huge, head retention is fantastic, and color is a brilliant red-brown hue. I don't love giving out 5s, but I can't really think of any way this could've been done better look-wise.  Smell: Bit malty notes with some caramel and almost a dark wheat smell as well, with some floral, sweet hoppiness on the tailend. Malts are the front and center, with that hoppiness being a little more latent. Smell of warm alcohol exists a bit too, which is only mildly unpleasant. So far, an absolutely excellent beer.  Taste: Wow, for a beer from a sixer this really is delivering. The malts are immediately noticeable on top of some very intense bittering hops for the style. Almost like an IPA bitter, with some bitter and sweeter hops as the malts fade. When aerated in the mouth, the hops and malts go head-to-head pretty well, and it's simplyt a great little beer that could. Little alcohol taste as well, but it's not as harsh as some other Barleywines out there.  Mouthfeel: First little hiccup here. The bitterness is almost too distracting from the battle between the hops and malts for taste supremacy. The balance is so well struck, but the carbonation that leads to such great lacing and head is a bit too much at some times. Still, nothing awful, just the first little tic mark in the less desireable column.  Drinkability: Well, I probably could drink a bomber of this fairly easily, but be quite warm afterwards. It gets hot quick after drinking it, but for the style and ABV that's to be expected I suppose. Still, a fantastic little beer that makes me want to delve more deeply into Barleywine territory.

140,2671,MaxBrews,4.53,"Presentation: 2009 Bottle poured into snifter.  Appearance: A big and luscious off-white brownish head, with good retention that dissipates into a thick and soapy lacing. Is dark ruby red in appearance. I'm giving this a 5 in this realm, cos no beer has provided such a mystifying color, large head and beautiful lacing. Usually the alcohol in such a beer would limit this.  Smell: The aroma of this beer is outstanding. In a room where there are no other odors you can step back from your glass and actually pick this up. The first thing you get when pouring is hops but that is quickly replaced dark caramel malts, bourbon, alcohol, sherry, raisins/prunes, black cherries (dark fruits), and brown sugar. What an aroma!  Taste: This is a complex beer. Different sips pick up different bits but with a large gulp and some swirling you get, buttery biscuit, dark fruit (see aroma), alcohol and even a bit off coffee towards the end of your sip. This is of course while the beer provides a huge hoppy backbone. This beer is steeped in hops and really adds a certain something to the earthy and generally dark taste. Perhaps a crispness and a bit of excitement. I would not have this beer any other way.  Mouthfeel: Someone described this beers palate as chewy and I'll agree with them. It definitely has a heavy, body and some dryness & bitterness from the hops. But along with that theres a sweetness that makes this all ok. This beer covers all its bases.  Drinkabilty: A barley wine for the hopheads and the rest of us. A complex maltiness followed by a strong hoppiness.

When drinking this beer I was amazed at the complexity of the flavors I experienced. Although outright impact on the taste bud's in the intense flavor of hops (having 90 international bitterness units), the beer is surprisingly well balanced by the malt. The flavors were so rich this beer seemed almost chewable. The aroma was filled with the resinous smell of hops, and then topped off with a bit of sweet malty and fruity character. Though the alcohol content was close to 10 percent, the alcohol taste was not overpowering at all and the drinkability of the beer was quite good. It poured a beautiful clear reddish-brown and had a nice fluffy head in my chalice. This is one of my favorite examples of the American barleywine style ale. Its almost as good as Stone's Old Guardian, but falls just short of that in my opinion. I would like to age some of these for a while at home and then see how it effects my view on this brew, although I already think it is great with out any aging. I've never seen these in 22 oz. bottles, but it would be cool to see some of them if there are any because buying a six pack of this type of beer feels weird to me. Overall a really impressive beer and I would recommend this beer to any beer nut.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Casey10,4.32,"2009 Version will mostly age a couple of these for awhile.  A - Dark amber red frothy head.  S - Citrus, grapefruit, slight spices.  T - again grapfuit, slight pine, hoppy fresh.  M - stong tart and hoppy.  D - could drink a couple probably not a lot at once. Look forward to a couple after some ageing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,david18,3.5,"Sierra Nevada does everything so well and dependably but they have become so ubiquitous that I often overlook them for something more obscure. However, whenever I see the stout, porter or barleywine I always make a point of getting one. Not as think as many and also not as hoppy, this is a perfect balance of malt, hops and alcohol for a great winter warmer.  Had this beer again and was very refreshed to taste such a balanced beer that was a good change from a double ipa with many of the same characteristics.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,MunchkinDrinker,4.08,"A - Dark hazy amber to red with a thick dark cream colored head and lacing all the way down.  S - Big grapefruit nose with a strong malt sweetness backing it up.  T/M - If the malt backbone wasn't so strong it would easily get smothered by the grapefuit rind hop flavor. Thick juicy mouthfeel compliments the hops nicely. On the aftertaste you get a slight malt chalkiness alond with some residual grapefruit flavor.  D - Very tasty, but this is a big beer and I wouldn't drink more than 1 a night.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,srandycarter,4.27,"2009 Vintage  A - Pours brown blended with amber, off white 1 inch head, reduces fast to disk, lots of lacing all over the glass.  S - Pine, Citrus and Cooked sweet malt, all in large measures.  T - Big malt is the predominant taste, heavily backed by TONS of hops. Almost smokin bitterness.  M - Fairly thick, great carb, good balance.  D - I like it, but after one, I need a lighter fare.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ShogoKawada,4.62,"Picked up a 6-pack of this. 2009 vintage.  A- Pours a nice earthy brown with a moderate head.  S- Hops and malt sweetness out the wazoo. Fresh, floral hops.  T- Amazing. Hops and malt are here at 110%. With the intense flavors, you hardly notice the high ABV. I taste grapefruit hops, caramelized malts, and bitter hops in the end. Very very good... nay...great!  M- Amazing. Great beer balance helps hide the 9.6% ABV. Malts help bring the whole shebang together.  D- Moderate to insanely high depending on your preference for in-your-face brews. An intense brew.. not for the timid. Still, I think this beer goes down with ease. I've put off this one for a while, and can't for the life of me think of why. SN puts out quality beer, and this one shows it in spades. Bravo!  I plan to make this one a staple in my fridge. This is the first beer in a while to knock my socks off. Amazing!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,wl0307,4.6,"2008 Vintage/25th Expedition! BB 25/01/09, served cool in Tripel Karmeliet's long-stemmed, flower-bulb shaped sniffer.  A: the colour comes dark ruby, with a decent but not fierce input of carbonation and a lovely, thick and creamy dark beige froth that lasts extremely well, leaving even lacing as it slowly retreats. S: superb, like a DIPA, the aroma bursts with Cascade's bouquet of sweet citrus and overripe lychee fruits, syrupy+creamy caramely malts, really dense honey-ish notes, and random inputs of dates, fat (preserved) cherries and figs. A swirl gives rise to a very mild edge of fruit esters as of ripened pears, but not quite assertive as a traditional English Barley Wine, due to the heavy presence of US hops on the balance. The overall aroma is intensely perfumy and hoppy, yet balanced and complex at the same time. T: a lubricating slurp of marvelously flowery, piney and lychee-ish juicy hops plus rich caramely malts precedes a rather soothing edge of tangy+tannic bitterness, as of dried citrus/grapefruits and stems of semi-fermented teas; as the bitter palate prevails, the rich yet belated fruitiness consisting of longan-fruits, nectar and rum-soaked sultanas manages to chime in. In the finish, aromatic Chinese tea-leaves, hop oil and perfume linger with the 3D grapefruit bitterness and an herbal ""bite"", in an assertive but still elegant manner. M&D: softly carbonated, full-bodied yet ever so easy to drink due to the attenuated alcoholic feel, this beer is uncompromisingly hoppy, bold, bitter, and tannic-dry, actually much more in line with the style of a DIPA (or ""Triple"" IPA?). I can't see the point of branding any ale ""American-(something)"" if only it is extra- or over-hopped with American hop varieties, which hardly merits a new beer category IMO, but the experiment in this bottle is truly sublime all the same. I haven't forgotten the initial shock and eventual, extreme joy when I first tasted the 2005 Vintage - my first ever experience with an American Barley Wine, while the performance of this bottle connects me to that fond memory just seamlessly and ever so vividly! To me, this is a world-class heavy ale.  * Tasting Date: 16/11/2005 Got this beer at the UTOBEER beer stall in the Borough Market, London. On the cap it says ""Bigfoot 2005 expedition"", so that's Vintage 2005 I believe. Apart from that there's no freshness info. on the bottle. 4.5 A: served in a goblet, it comes with a slightly hazy, ruby hue; I manage to pour an extremely thick and fluffy off-white head which ""egg-shell cracks"" ever so slowly, leaving different layers of fine lacing; pretty static body, as far as my eye-sight could manage. Looking nearly perfect, like a glass of port if without the foam. 4.5 S: as wildly malty as incredibly hoppy--hallmark of oily, fat hops (Cascade?) reminiscent of the heavier American IPA/DIPA even...; after swirling, a flow of intoxicating, intense and mixed aroma comes through, with intense aroma of caramel (liquid form), sharp pine-wood smell, preserved prunes, dried longan-fruits, over-ripened lychees, a dash of orange syrup, and (maybe) a sprinkle of cinnamon or other spices. Overall, the aroma, despite its thick, even syrupy texture, shows great complexity and depth. 4.5 T&4.5 M: thick, syrupy and oily texture of fruity malts pours in, almost immediately bringing on board a wave of powerful bitterness so tannic and herbal it transforms the impression of the nose in no time! Lots of dried fruits as identified in the aroma, all wrapped between the mighty oily hops and underlying bitter taste. The tannic bitterness lingers too well, like the kind of mouthfeel you get whilst wrongly crushing grapeseeds b/w your teeth; but this one goes even deeper down the throat, well balancing the undesirable sugary and alcoholic aftertaste. 120%-bodied and fuller-than-full-flavoured barley wine it is, with a thick mouthfeel supported by tiny bubbly texture of carbonation--just about right. 5 D: this is my first-ever bottle of American barley wine, and it's incredibly delicious as well as surprisingly balanced. It's so different from those English barley wines I've tried which tend to taste ""older"" and mellower. In a sense, it bears much resemblance to other types of American ales maybe thanks to the bulk of strongly-scented hops used in this ale, even reminding me of some fantastic characters of SN's own Celebration Ale, but of course this one is of different type. Overall, this is a good digestif to replace a vintage port for me this winter. Though it's not something to savour for more than one bottle, I think the ""drinkability""--overall performance, satisfaction vis-a-vis expectation--is sublime. I shall buy some more bottles for ageing and see if it indeed improves with age like a port~~",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,aaronxsubaru,4.37,Tastes like a condensed beer. Quite good and strong. Back color. Smells like smells sweet and bitter at the same time. Hints of orange pith maybe. Tastes like it smells. Great balance of hops and malts. I think I am becoming a fan of barley wine. This is a great brew. If you get the chance give this a try. It's really full flavored,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,SpdKilz,4.3,"Appearance - Seriously, a beautiful ruby red color with a mahogany tint. Amazing head, good lacing.  Smell - Hoppy, but honestly not very ""bitter"" in the aspect, more of a sweetness to it.  Taste - Immediately I taste a sweetness which is followed by a bitter/hoppy taste. I can also taste citrus and caramel.  Mouthfeel - Quite thick in texture, almost like syrup. Not much carbonation when it hits the pallet but it fits the beer.  Drinkability - When cold, the alcohol is not as prominent. As it has warmed up to room temperature the booziness has become more prominent but not in a ""distasteful"" way. An amazing drink and I'm sorry to not have found out about it until recently.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,froghop,3.85,"2009 vintage  pours a dark copper with a small beige head that becomes very thin, a little lacing.  smell of barley, burnt caramel, dark fruit, spices, citrus, some roasted nuts, and a touch of floral in the back  taste is creamy, thick, warming, alcohol comes through but not overpowering, some tart and sour fruits, caramel, and some roasted nuts, a very nice bitter ending.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,number1bum,4.53,"Can't believe I've never reviewed Bigfoot! 2009 vintage. Pours a dense, dark amber color with a very creamy two inches of tan head. Retention is excellent, keeping a very thick, flufffy lace and leaving a mess of stick. Perfection.  Smell is aggressively hoppy for a barleywine, with lots of citrus and pine. Also a rich, bready caramel malt aroma with a light toastiness.  Taste is even hoppier than the nose, with big citrus and resiny flavors as well as sticky pine. Malt backbone, like the smell, is very solid as it should be, with a big caramel flavor along with some lightly toasted, biscuit malt flavor. Hop bitterness is also pretty aggressive but not out of line. This is just extremely well balanced and I love how hoppy it is. The alcohol isn't completely masked but it's not hot either. It lets you know of the beers strength without getting obtrusive. If the alcohol were masked a bit more this just might be a 5.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and very creamy. It's downright chewy, with a richness to it that is complemented nicely by the slick, oily hop feel. If the alcohol were masked a bit more this too might be a 5.  This is just a fantastic beer fresh, and although I'm ashamed to say that I haven't had it aged I'm putting some in the cellar to see how it progresses. It's hard for me to imagine that I'll like it better aged, however, as I love the hoppiness of it. I feel the same way about Troegs Flying Mouflan; I'm not sure which of the two is hoppier fresh, but they are both outstanding barleywines. Great stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

S - You can smell how big this beer is. Lots of hope notes pine and citrus. Sweet caramel malts and just a touch of tabacco finish off the smell.  T - Very complex flavors. There is a full hoppy shmorgus board of flavor. Very yeasty bread notes with fruity esters. Not much alcohol for how high it is.  M - It definitely leaves an impression on the tongue. Tons of carbonation, very full body. Slightly warming.  O - This beer is not for the timid.

A very dark, cloudy, reddish appearance with a little, 1/2 fingered head dissapearing fast but the lacing for some reason was stellar! Lovely malt presence, dark fruits, and a hop flavor thats quite subtle. The taste folows the aroma of malt, dark fruit, adds a little spice, and has a great hoppy bitterness at the finish. What a creamy, smooth beer! A great full bodied beer, not too hot with the alcohol. And the carbonation is controlled very nicely. I really like this beer. Great balance, tolerable alcohol presence. Be careful, too much too quick and you're jacked. But a great, great beverage.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Nibbley,4.66,Poured from a 2008 25th Expedition release. Pours a lovely reddish-brown with a good 2 finger head that lasts the entire glass.Good lacing down the glass. Smells of dark fruit and fresh baked rye bread. First taste bring a wallop of hoppy bitterness that mellows into a nice malty backround. Warming alcohol is nice but not overpowering. Exceptional example of the style.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,superdedooperboy,3.95,"2009 batch poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter. Served at cellar temperature, 50 degrees F.  Pours a beautiful clear, deep reddish hue with a full, creamy light tan head that fades to a thick bubbly cap that casts a few splotches of lace on the walls of the glass as the glass drains. Displays some legs as the glass is swirled.  Aroma is rife with rich malt and fruity estery goodness, along with a mighty hop kick. Luscious notes of figs and prunes meld delicately with a hint of caramel and bright, floral, citrusy hops. Each noseful is a delight.  Quite full-bodied though certainly far from syrupy, with just a mild carbonation that provides just the faintest prickle on the tongue. The palate is mostly hop-forward, with a definite citrusy hoppiness that screams DIPA; but then, this is an American Barleywine, and the line between it and the venerable DIPA is a thin one. The barleywine nature shows through in the rich maltiness that undercuts the hops, though it is quickly forgotten thanks to the dry bitterness that is accentuated by the alcohol that shows through in the middle, carrying over well into the finish, seemingly soaking all moisture from the palate and leaving a bone-dry, grapefruity hoppiness that lingers long after.  Delicious but, naturally, the high alcohol content hinders drinkability. Certainly an excellent American barleywine, but one that deserves a bit of mellowing to tone down the hop level and bring out the malts and delicious fruitiness. Ken Grossman has stated that this one is at its best after a year of age; I may certainly have to test out his judgment.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,johntangus,4.48,"Pours a lovely deep amber with a thick frothy head that dissapates slowly leaving some killer lacing.  The smell is a rather boozy dark fruit - very big beer smell.  It doesn't taste nearly as boozy as it smells. Great hop presence up front with a delicious malt back end.  It has a wonderful medium mouthfeel and if i weren't tipsy after one, i could see myself drinking a few of these in a sitting.  This is probably the most impressed that i've been with Sierra Nevada.

140,2671,ClevoPiwo,3.7,"poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter  this beer pours a nice deep chestnut or a rich burnt sienna. the head is moderate, about a finger width, and leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. after the initial head dissipates you are left with some spotty foam and a thin rim around the edge of the surface of the beer.  the hops are right up front in the smell and very distinct; you can pick them out without any trouble or confusion. in addition to the bitter and pine-y aromatic assault from the hops there are some overtones of sweetness from the malts and a bit of alcohol ester.  the taste is really big on the hops. the malt is present briefly once the beer hits the palate but the sweet and caramely flavor of the malt is quickly overtaken by the hops which linger into the finish. would have personally liked to see a fairer balance between the malts and hops, but that isn't to say this isn't a skillfully crafted beer. the alcohol is present as well in the taste, fitting somewhere between the malt and the hops.  overall a good beer. if you like hops, this one is for you!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Nose- Burnt carmel, piney hops, a touch of oak, and a whiff of alcohol.  Mouthfeel- reveals a slighty syrupy medium body.  Taste- Up front is a malt bomb all the way with toffee and citrus showing. The finish ends dry with aggressive hops(a little more than I was hoping for considering three years age) and a touch of warming alcohol.

140,2671,lacqueredmouse,4.5,"A rather splendid burnished copper colour, with a thick and frothy head of yellow-beige bubbles. Lacing is phenomenal. Clarity is excellent. This is a damn hell yes looking beer. Just gorgeous.  Oh my and goodness. What a truly lovely American-hopped nose. Full of citrus, fruit and pine, delicious with resin and deliciously good. Oh, this smell always takes me back to San Francisco, a very pleasant place to be, surrounded by delicious beer. If I'm being picky, it's probably not as sharp or pungent as the best highly-hopped American ales, but it does have a pleasant sweetness sitting around that adds some character. Still - this is very, very nice indeed.  Creamy and silky on the mouth, a very fine and slick feel is noticeable from the first sip. Amazingly, it's not as bitter as I would have imagined from the aroma - and for a barleywine, that's excellent. There's a rich sweetness lolling over the tongue, feeling rich, heavy and gorgeous, and the hoppy notes just dance around over the top, never proclaiming their dominance. The beuatiful coupling of the flecks of bitterness and the creamy, sweet backbone make this a really, really excellent beer.  This is an exceptionally good barleywine, in my opinion. The hops remind you of its origin, but the palate is so full, rich and heavy with malt sweetness that you can't mistake this for a DIPA, which is how I feel a lot of barleywines end up. Extremely drinkable, and thoroughly enjoyable. Sierra Nevada, I take my hat off.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,laituegonflable,4.02,"Pours a rich amber colour with frothy cream head that has disappeared, leaving some nice spots of lace around the glass. Little bubbles are formed with tilting, but no other visible carbonation. Looks very nice.  Nose is very hoppy with a tangy citrus character rebounding off some very aromatic floral hops, underlying buttery note and a hint of a watermelon Jolly Rancher element. Very nice indeed. I'm a fan.  Taste is a bit insane. Deep raisiny, treacley sweetness on the front, very thick and full malt, then a quite quick, but increasingly intense, fanfare of hops that start out quite floral and get increasingly bitter and phenolic towards the end, with a roasted, burnt kind of flavour as well. Leaves a very sharp astringency in my mouth, probably killing my palate. Quite a puckering mouthfeel overall.  For all that though, it's very nice, a good complex journey from start to finish. I just think it leans too heavily on the hops, leaves on a very bitter note, like my slut of an ex-wife.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,oldpinecone,4.2,Drank from a pint glass. This beer pours a wonderful copperish color with a thin light tan head and subpar lacing. It smells of malt and nature with a mild alcohol presence.

S: Rich aromas of both malts and hops. Pleasant fruity aromas (gooseberries, red grapefruit, lemon peel) blend with a large amount of sweet chocolate. Hints of raisin and vanilla. A very sturdy malty backbone. All in all, the smell is very powerful, rich and dense. Very complex and very pleasant.  T: Big caramel flavor, sweet fudge and chocolate. Sweet and ripe fruit - citric notes, grapefruit, cherries. Notes of almonds. Vanilla and licorice in the middle. The finish is very bitter with notes of grassy hops and raisins. A well integrated taste of alcohol delivers a spicy layer on top of the sweetness. Very nice!  M: Full bodied, smooth and soft mouthfeel with a slightly chewy finish. Medium carbonation.  D: A very good beer. Complex and well balanced. One year of cellaring is really suitable for this one.  ---  2005 vintage. Serving date: 2009-04-10. Cellared for about 4 years, parallel tasted with the 2008 vintage.  A: Much darker than the 2008 vintage, and with a smaller head that dissipates faster.  S: Not as impressive as the 2008 vintage, but still good. Not as powerful and not as complex. A similar fruitiness, but with a slightly tart edge and it is harder to pinpoint exact components. A big malty backbone, but not as sturdy as the 2008 vintage. Still plenty of chocolate and raisins. One of two funky notes and a prominent aged character.  T: A prominent taste of dusty cellar, somewhat sweet but mostly funky - not unpleasantly funky though. Sweet fruits (currants, grapefruit and some cherries). Hints of wood. The flavors have in general a very mature character. More sweetness in the form of chocolate and some vanilla. The finish is not as bitter as the 2008 vintage. The hops have faded significantly. The alcohol is not as prominent as in the 2008 vintage, and it is very well integrated. All in all, the flavors in the 2005 vintage are a little edgier than in the 2008, and it is not as complex. The 2005 vintage has some notes resembling sherry, and I did not pick that out in the 2008 vintage.  M: Basically the same as the 2008 vintage.

Pale beige head that leaves some lacings.  S: Lots of grapefruit and hop resins. Notes of pine-needles. A hint of vanilla. The malty caramel background is noticeable, but muted by the powerful hops. Compared to the cellared 08 vintage, this one is clearly more hoppy and not as balanced.  T: Lots of grapefruit and tropical fruits. Hints of vanilla and toffee. Juicy caramel malts in the background, but clearly overpowered by the hops. Rather sweet. The finish is massively bitter, really aggressive, with lots of piny and spicy hops and sweet and spicy alcohol.  M: Same as the other vintages.  D: A bottle this young is much more hop forward than older ones. The beer is quite different when it's young compared to when it's cellared. The sweet and chewy vinous character of a barleywine is considerably held back in favor of the hoppy flavors. Not as well-balanced as especially the cellared 08 vintage.

Nice amount of carbonation.  Smells were yeasty, caramel sweetness, and floral hops. A nice balanced aroma that was very enticing.  Taste was a slight let down compared to the aromas that it gave off. Upfront was a toasted nuttiness, that was slightly sweet, followed by a grassy hop bitterness. There was a slight harshness in the finish that makes me believe this beer will do better with some age. Very dry almost chalky finish, that had a slight peppery taste.  Mouthfeel was medium bodied.

Taste is quite good, very hop forward and quite bitter. Malt is present but very much in the background. Finish is a touch sweet and there is a very low alcohol presence.

140,2671,photomike,3.78,"5.5 month old bottle. Pours a nice, clear mahogany with a half inch tan head (poured very cold). Impressive lacing but had hoped for a bit more out of the head. Not much retention at all, with a thin film remaining throughout the glass.  Nose is excitingly complex. Peppery hops are prominent, as are a couple of different malt scents. Very sweet carmelly malts and sourdough bread. Intoxicating alcohol, which is a bit much paired with the intense sweetness.  Flavor is full and complex but easy to pull apart. Peppery, piney hops are prominent at the start, and their presence is felt bigtime in the bitter finish. The middle is full of dark fruits and alcohol, with some spicy pepper that might be coming from the hops. Bready. This is well balanced, but I feel as though the alcohol is a tad too noticeable, and the hops are a bit conflicting in their fruitiness--like the grapefruitiness from the hops doesn't meld well with the dark fruits present. I had to dig pretty deep for these criticisms, though, this is really tasty.  Medium-high body with a lot of chewiness, especially as it warms. Perfectly carbonated, but rather hot. Slick.  This bottle is labeled at 9.6%, and the high ABV is obvious. The alcohol hits you hard and fast, and I don't usually want more than one. Big time sipper.

Appearance- Beer pours tea brown with very little carbonation across the top and light lacing on the sides of the glass. Clarity is nonexistant as there is quite a bit of cloudiness in the beer even after 8 years.  Smell- Dates and a rich nutty character, a bit like cashews, very sherrylike in it's oxidation that I am somewhat surprised to detect considering that it is on tap.  Taste- The nutty sherry flavors really come through on the taste, with the hops having died down over the years, really letting the malt take over and do its thing. Very caramelized and a much smoother drink than the previous bigfoot that it was.  Mouthfeel- Creamy, lightly warming, medium low in carbonation, and medium full in body.  Drinkability- A very easy drinking barleywine, but it could be about a year past its prime. A tricky thing these barleywines are.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The hop aromas pretty much dominate any other aromas if there are any. Again a strong pine/citrus peel hop flavor and a little alcohol flavor. There was also a caramel and toasted malt flavor in there somewhere when I took my first sip, but by know the hop flavor is too ingrained in my taste buds to detect anything else other than pure hop juice. Good mouthfeel, not too thin. It is very tasty, but I probably would stop at one or two.

It leaves a little lace, but retains a ring around the edge, a film on the top, and with a swirl is easily revived. The liquid portion of the image is a chameleon changing with the light, brown, burgundy, red, and quite clear...limpid. I love this beer. Distinct hops, and malts sweet and grainy and fruity, define the nose. I really don't have the palate to do the beer justice...I'll try, again and again. Wonderful mouth feel creamy and smooth with carbonation enough to keep it lively. Bigfoot, fresh, has distinct hoppy bitterness, and hop flavors, that work really well with the sweet flavor of malt.

Starts piney and finishes grapefruity, with enough malt backbone to hold it in place. alcohol is present but not overpowering.

The choice in glassware (Shaker) and the pouring methodology used (45&#730;/completely full to the brim!) did not help in this category, but all things aside this is still an incredible beer!  A - Medium-Amber to Deep-Amber in hue (SRM 14) and a thin off-white head. The beer is light enough to partially see some carbonation, though dark enough to struggle in doing so.  S - Malty foreground with hops and slightly boozy in the background. Caramel comes to the nose by way of English Caramel Malt, though Pale Ale Malt seems to make up the majority of it.  T - Sweet caramel flavor with a mild bitterness from the Cascadian hops. Though unaware at the time, Sierra Nevada's website states that Chinook and Centennial were also used in brewing this lovely concoction! It also comes across as more boozy and malty than the '09, so clearly aging this beer has helped to mellow the assertive hops aspect of the beer out.  M - Slightly syrupy and very smooth. A soothing warm feeling rouses the sense with each sip and warmth and time only creates a more dream-like state.  C - This beer can be perceived as very drinkable by some, though I would definitely state this as a sipping beer and one not to take lightly! Aging the beer a year definitely brings about thoughts of a more traditionally brewed English-style Barleywine than the 2009 hop-prevalent vintage does. Dark chocolate, aged cheese, or a crackling campfire would all be lovely pairings with this beer. Enjoy!  Vintage 2009  Tasted as part of a Vertical Tasting, this was the second time trying the 2009 Bigfoot and was grateful for being able to do so soon after having finished tasting the 2008 vintage.

In comparison to the aged 2008, this vintage presents a much more bitter hop taste that lingers slightly.  M - Slightly syrupy and very smooth.

C - This beer can be perceived as very drinkable by some, though I would definitely state this as a sipping beer and one not to take lightly!

Time and time again people mentioned bigfoot. I was surprised to find out it was a barleywine as that's not typically something I would associate with bringing about a beer revelation in a macro drinker - but there you have it.  Appearance-wise Bigfoot is quite good. It has a nice creamy off-white head that settles to a ring of foam over an attractive mahogany colored beer. The smell reminded me immediately of Southern Tier's Unearthly.. lots of fruit, alcohol and malts.. and there are other similarities between the two but Bigfoot definitely cranks things up a notch. The taste is a BIG dose of fruity malts up front finished with powerful alcohol infused hops at the end. It's a mouthful.

140,2671,PatrickJR,4.42,"Re-review. Original posted below.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into oversized snifter, 2009 vintage.  A - Translucent brown with hints of red mixed in. Cola colored. Two fingers of light brown head rise with decent retention. Minimal lacing.  S - A good deal of piney hops mingle with a strong caramel/brown sugar malt profile. Raisins, toffee, dark fruit, dark bread, nuts, and hints of anise and mace are evident as well. Alcohol-laden note on the back end with suggestions of citrus peel and black pepper.  T - Quick pine note at first followed by the complex malt profile. Lots of raisins, covered with caramel and toffee though the sweetness remains restrained due to the massive influx of hops. Anise like notes bounce in and out of soft brown sugar and indistinct dark fruit flavors. Mid to late palate the fruity flavors drop off. A dark bitter bread character persists in the background, but the hops take the stage with near vegetal flavors and bitter herbs. Some citrus peel works its way in but mostly notes from tea, mint, cardamom, perhaps rosemary(?) dance with a very noticable alcohol component. Bitterness grows and crescendos in the aftertaste with an earthy flavor.  M - On the light side of full bodied with a moderate to low carbonation.  D - A sipper to be sure, however this stuff begs to be drunk quickly. Near perfect marriage of lots of hops and lots of malt. My major complaint is the obviousness of the alcohol which keeps the flavor from carrying on flawlessly. Still, a great beer at a great price.  ---  Original Review from 9.29.08  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into oversized snifter. 2007 Vintage. Consumed slightly below room temperature.  A - 4.5 - Dark, cola-colored brown with some transparency on the edges. A nice half inch of brown head rises with decent retention for the style. Decent lacing as well.  S - 4.0 - Very minty and piney hops ride a huge caramel/brown sugar sweetness with expected dark fruits in the background. A faint roastedness lingers as well.  T - 4.5 - Sweet malt is evident with big brown sugar and a little bit of burnt/roasted character. The hop flavor makes its entrance after the sweetness has settled some, with pine being the most obvious flavor and citrus in the background. Roastedness prevails late palate and finishes with a moderate bitterness. While I don't think the malt component even touches the English version of the style, the hops flavor is much more harmonious than other American versions I've had.  M - 3.5 - While aroma and taste increased as the beer warmed, the mouthfeel definitely worsened. A light carbonation with the medium-ish body worked well, but the warmer the brew gets it seems to thin out more than I would prefer for the style and the carbonation is next to nihl.  D - 4.0 - For a relatively intense beer this is at least an easy sipper. Great flavor and the hops aren't too loud in this one.

140,2671,brewmudgeon,4.08,"2010 version--as of october, drinking well, the hops are not too abrasive but the brew still comes together well. getting back on the bandwagon and wishing i'd bought more than 12.  after just a few months in the fridge i'm finding the 09 bigfeet have seemed to have lost some carbonation. very odd, but bottle after bottle seems to confirm it. and despite the constant refrigeration, the hops are falling pretty flat too. (overall this is now down to about a 4.0 rating beer) maybe significant age will bring out other charms, but for now i'm thinking drink these right away.  bigfoot 09 nearly through a case so time to review. 4.5 (from 5) beautiful deep amber with hints of ruby. sticky head leaves lace everywhere. viscous enough to entertain you as it coats the glass when swirled. 4.5 potent citrus, pine, and catnip (chinook) hops and biscuity malt, now the hops again. as it warms there's a boozy stage where alcohol takes front and center, then the sweet maltiness starts to take over. 4-4.5 three beers in one. i drink the first 1/3 cold for the delicious hop bite, aroma, and heavy vibrance. the chinooks are key here. the next third plays tag, dodgeball, and a few other playground games with your palate as various traits emerge and recede. the alcohol is fighting to take over, but ultimately loses to the malt and hop flavor--the third phase has begun. sip slowly at this point, and bow silently when the glass is finally emptied. 4.5 the viscosity is just right, the carbonation ideal as well so long as you don't pour aggressively. 4 (down from 5) not just a beer i'm willing to have again. a beer that makes me sad when i realize the supply is other than infinite. a lot of people claim bigfoot is best aged, but damnit fresh is where it's at! inspired live rock concert vs. neutered elevator soundtrack instrumentals.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

S - Fairly assertive malt backbone with strong hop aroma: resiny and some citrus, with a fairly strong smell of alcohol.  T - Rich and malty up front, with nice hop character following it up. Spicy, resiny, and citrus notes in the hops, and finishes semi-dry with strong bittering and a lingering alcohol heat.  M - Full bodied and rich mouthfeel.  D - Drinkable for the style.

140,2671,pandashaver,3.78,"A - Burgundy reddish brown body deep and translucent body, just showing some slight light through it. Good 1.5 finger initial white to off white head. Leaves gorgeous lacing as it dissipates to a thin white ring. Floral.  S - Earthy and hoppy, also smells of apples (granny smith?) and perhaps berries.  T - Upfront very sweet and dry with the malts. Heavily spiced, enhanced by the alcohol (which is very present as it warms). Bitter finish. Pine, especially in the finish.  M - Medium to thick, not creamy or watery really. Warming due to the high alcohol - I can see why it's a winter brew! Demolishes the palate, but in a good way. Sticky and resiny as it goes down. Long and satisfying warm/bitter finish.  D - Low, but this is my first barleywine and I'm guessing they are all sippers. An excellent drink on a cold night, or one one where you just want to relax in front of the TV or listening to some tunes.

140,2671,bobsy,3.8,"2009 vintage - one sampled fresh and the other laid down for posterity to see how the aging effects this one. Nice mahogany pour with a light tan couloured head, which exhibited good retention and lacing. Far more head than a regular barleywine, which is at least partially a result of its freshness. That very same freshness is apparent in an aroma that just screams hops. Grapefruit rind and pine bludgeon the nose, with some alcohol lurking in the background.  I've heard a lot of talk about how Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot tastes great fresh, nad while it can age does not necessarily gain anything, but instead changes in character. I can see that. Off the bat this is a very hoppy beer - intensely so - and I could imagine an aged version would be markedly different. The beer is dominated by a piney-citrus bitterness, but madeira sherry apsects are peaking out from underneath, and I'd like to see them become a bit more apparent, which I'm sure time will bring about. Right now it definitely feels slightly unbalanced, with the bitterness nary reigned in by a light pervading sweetness and hints of toffee. What this sweetness does achieve, however, is to take the sharpness off the bitterness to make it palatable and drinkable. As for the alcohol, its reasonably well-integrated, and doesn't make itself felt until a warming finish moves from the mouth to the stomach.  The residual sugars make for a syrupy body. Its a touch beyond the 'chewy' I ideally look for, but it is somewhat alleviated by an active, but soft carbonation.  I still prefer the english style of barleywine, but this is decent enough. Its more of a hop-bomb, and should be approached as such.  Thanks Bryan!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,josiahschlender,4.15,"I've been curious to try this beer for a while, since I'm a fan of Sierra Nevada and barleywines in general. I wish it was more common and affordable here in Portland. It sounds like that's often the case in other places.  Nice looks from this ale. Rich amber in color, with a decent off-white head that leaves some lacing.  Wow, huge pine oil nose on this one. My wife doesn't like the hoppy beers, complaining they smell and taste like Pine-Sol. While I disagree with her on that point most of the time, I must say there are definitely some Pine-Sol similarities in the way this brew smells. I also detect a combination of roasted and sweet malts sneaking between the hops and the definite alcohol.  Hops dominate the flavor, but the surprisingly roasty malt backbone tries to balance it out. Malts are not overpowered, but this barleywine toes the line of being one dimensionally hoppy. Speaking of hops, this beer has some of the most bittering I've had in a while. And I drink a lot fo NW IPAs. Almost punishingly bitter... I thought I was strong but this is kicking my butt.  Mouthfeel is well suited for the style, slick and oily that sticks to your mouth on the loong bitter finish.  Overall, this is the kind of beer I love to love, but for some reason it's not floating my boat tonight. I wish I had a sixer of the stuff to see what some time would do for it.

Very thin head but nice lacing.  Smell: Dark fruits (plum) and some alcohol. Grapefruit is also evident but the smell is really not too overpowering in the hop department, despite the upcoming assault on my taste buds.  Taste: Begins with expected Barleywine profile (fruit, toffee, caramel) before being quickly overtaken by a strong spicy and grapefruit bitterness, which lasts long after taking a sip.  Feel: Somewhat thick and chewy, with moderate carbonation. Slightly warming.  Drinkability: Tastes great, but very alcoholic and unbelievably bitter. Slow sipper and I really don't want more than one.  I am excited to try this again after sitting in my basement for a year.

My limited nose is probably not doing this beer justice as it seems quite complex. The flavor of this thing is also huge beginning with plum, ruby grapefruit, caramel malt. A hint of alcohol provides a nice warming sensation. The bitterness of the hops comes through in the end having a grapefruit citrus flavor.

Something buried deep under that head.  Big bitter hop burn in the bite. Yep. Good flavor but seems rather one dimensional at this point. Time for an aging experiment.  Medium to full body, smooth.

Smells similar to their Pale Ale to me.  T: It starts out kind of nutty. followed by the bitterness of orange and pine flavored hops. Alcohol is easily noticed throughout the sip. Finishes with a nice touch of maltyness and a nice smooth burn of alcohol.

Sweet malts back up the hops.  Citric hops on the palate with strange fruit undertones. Sweet malts try to balance out the bitterness, but the hops overpower everything.

Flavor is complex, a tug-o-war between the hops and the sweetness of malts. I first notice the hops, and flavors of grapefruit rine, pine, and earthy spices. Strangely, enough I notice some chalk dust on the transition. The malt comes through extremely sweet on the end and into the aftertaste, and caramel presence.

Notes of alcohol on the nose with nuts, winter spices and fresh fir/spruce notes. Some citrus/pine hops when idled for a while and a bit of dark chocolate. Not as malty on the nose as expected, well balanced.  Hops initiate on the flavor with a touch of bitterness to follow. Malt structure is there in the finish and lingers well. Slightly chewy but not overpowering and with a bit of citrus hop on the close, along with some dark cherry/chocolate. Offers a light yet steady carbonation that fits the beer quite well, maintaining a surface cap yet not being unduly fizzy.

There is a caramel like sweetness but is light. I can also taste the alcohol.  Overall: The mouth feel is astringent and carbonated. The body of the beer is medium thick, and the finish is bitter.

Decent amount of carbonation, but nothing too over the top.  The aroma is not as hoppy as I originally assumed it would be. Granted, there is a large hop portion of the aroma, but there is so much more. Dark fruits, and I also get some citrus fruits, mostly Grapefruit. Also a light caramel scent. The slightest bit of alcohol is present, but not in the least bit intrusive.  The taste is pretty surprising to me. I was under the impression that this was an overly hoppy beer, but that assumption is very wrong. I find this beer very well balanced, and very very smooth. Excellent taste. I don't get much fruit here, and no alcohol. Bitter aftertaste is expected.  Again, this is one smooth brew. Almost creamy smooth. Medium bodied paired with a light carbonation.  Very drinkable. This one is almost dangerous. With an ABV approaching 10, and no sign of it anywhere, I could easily go overboard with this one. Very smooth and enjoyable, keeps me coming back for more.

Smell: The brew has some fruity esters and a rich scent of hops. The brew also had a little pear scent and toasted malts in the background.  Taste: The flavor hits you like a ton of bricks all at once. Alcohol is very present with the initial taste then moves in to a nice malty body backed up with a rich hoppy bite. The flavor then subsides and moves in to a deep bitterness that lingers through to the end and then some. A nice alcohol warming is present through much of the end. Its been about two minutes since my last sip and still I can taste the rich hoppy bitterness that is Big Foot Ale.  Mouthfeel: Thick like a milk-shake and with a nice level of carbonation.

It finish a with a little hottness of alcohol and a whole lot of hops. In fact I am not sure how long the finish is because it hasn't stopped. I feel like I chewed on hops instead of drinking a beer, but that is expected with barley wine and any of Sierra Nevada's specialty beers.  Its mouthfeel if full, but consider the ABV it pretty smooth.  Overall, I felt that Big Foot was a really good version of the style.

140,2671,Offa,2.73,"This is a very bitter barleywine with good qualities and rich, fruity barleywine character that to me ends up being largely ruined by sharp, clashing bitterness in the end. I had the 2008 vinatge, purchased in Feb08 and stored until April 09, when I drank it, in anticipation of the strong hops. Even so, the hops still came out far too bitter and intense.  Deep copper and faintly hazy, it has a medium tan head with orange hue, very slowly shrinking to a thin, foamy ring and wisps with a little lace.  The aroma is grapefruity-piney hops, very flowery, with candied lemon, fruit, caramleized grapes, raisiny-pruny alcohol. It smells a bit similar to Lagunitas Brown Shugga or Lucky 13, yet more ""barleywine"" like with a defintie English barleywine character underneath.  The taste is somewhat similar, rich flavour and body with burnt, winey fruit, smokey wood and earth, caramelized burnt orange peel and grapefruit - a rich, sweet barleywine with definite English-barleywine undertones - but then a sharp, mouth-puckering, intense citrusy bitterness takes over near the finish, clashing around and drowning out the rest in the finish, lingering and sticking to the mouth. It doesn't have a drying feel because of the otherwise rich chracter and feel, but it made me extremely thirsty after drinking only about 6 ounces. The feel is rather rich, oily and frothy like many other barleywines I've had. Ultimately, the one-note, intense hop bitterness dorwns out everything else.

The head fades slowly and leaves excellent lacing all the way down.  Aroma: A bright and citrusy hop presence over a solid caramel malt backbone. There's a bit of booze here, but not much.  Flavor: Wow, there's a lot here to describe. Up front, a big wave of citrusy, tropical fruit-like, piney, resinous, and thoroughly bitter hops. Underneath, there's a big and bruising biscuity caramel malt backbone that's up to the challenge issued by the hops. There's a lot of spicy heat and some booze from the alcohol, but it works nicely. Somehow, even with so many massive flavors in the mix, they all stay nicely balanced. Biscuity malt, a hint of booze, and lots of lingering bitterness in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: A chewy full body with smooth medium carbonation. Plenty of heat from the alcohol in the cheeks and throat.  Drinkability: Certainly something that will take a little time to wrap up, though it drinks much faster than you'd imagine.  Verdict: Bursting with a multitude of full flavors, yet still balanced and somehow drinkable, Bigfoot is a true classic that is well worth waiting for each year. I can't wait to report back on how this has fared in 10 years or so.  ---  2009 Vintage Reviewed Shortly After Release:  Appearance: Somewhat hazy deep red body with red laser beam highlights. Two fingers of caramel-tinged head that leaves great lacing.  Aroma: Lots of hops, lots of malt, and lots of booze - just what I expected. Relatively balanced in its massiveness, but the hops take the spotlight. It's a complex mix: perfumey Cascade hops, dark fruit, spices, caramel malt, and alcohol.  Taste: Again, intense and complex. Masses of grapefruity and piney Cascade hops riding on top of a very solid caramel malt base with everything simply dripping with alcohol. Still plenty of dark fruit and spices flavors here. The aftertaste is brilliantly bitter and boozy.  Mouthfeel: So chewy you could chip a tooth with good carbonation. A great dry, boozy finish that segues into a long-lasting hoppy aftertaste.  Drinkability: Very filling and obviously a sipper. One is certainly enough, but a second is still tempting...  Verdict: Bigfoot, like any good Barleywine, is simply a massive beer. Everything about it is larger than life. There are enough hops to make it unique, but not so many that the lines are too blurred with a Double IPA. I can't wait to see how this ages.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,MrIncognito,3.75,"A - 2009 bottle, poured into a stemless wine glass. Mahogony red and mostly clear with just the slightest hint of haze. Nice, big 2-finger off-white head that is sticky and leaves beautiful lacing. Head retains a 1/4-inch film for the duration of the beer (I sipped this for 2 hours)  S - Big hoppy smell with some sweet malts and alcohol in the background. Light hints of grapefruit.  T&M - Huge hop flavor right from the getgo. Pretty much dominates the palate. Other flavors that sneak in include the grapefruit and then the warming alcohol. Alcohol is definitely there with a sweet yet spicy flavor, but masked well by the hop bitterness. Sticky, syrupy mouthfeel, but not necessarily in a gross way. Light carbonation livens this up a bit. The hops really drown out alot of the other flavors and takes away from the balance.  D - As mentioned earlier, I took two hours to sip this down. Not only because I was savoring the flavor but because the hops are just a bit too harsh for my taste. Left the back of my tongue feeling braquish like I drank sea water. Don't get me wrong, I liked it but I think some time in the cellar would really mellow this out well and become more balanced.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,brow1901,3.61,"Bigfoot is an alleged ""big"" beer. But I have found no proof, instead I find a decent barleywine that doesn't live up to the name.  A- The beer pours a dark and deep red, very clear. White thick head that sticks around for most of the beer.  S- bigfoot has a much more pronounced hop character than other barleywines I've had. So that is the first thing that stands out. Like many bw's the malt is pronounced and there is a hint of alcohol.  T- The taste kinda disappoints me, I really felt that it tastes like their PA with more alcohol. Plus some malts. But again the hops are very present and I feel like the beer isn't balanced in this sense ( not balanced compared to other bw's).  M- The beer is full bodied, with enough carbonation. Leavers the mouth sticky and its not really enjoyable IMO.  D- At 9% this beer is drinkable, they will catch you off guard.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,FallinDeck,3.57,"Appearance: Red body with off white, ok sized head. The color is great but the head and lack of lacing brought down my appeal to the look. Smell: Hops, Molasses, and alcohol. Not too heavy. Taste: Very dry hoppy, and I swear I can taste Molasses. Mouthfeel: Heavy and goes down like syrup without the sugar. Drinkability: Poor drinkability do to the sour molasses taste and high alcohol level.  All said this is a good beer, it's just a one beer sitting in my opinion.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Gosox8787,4.37,"Bought a six pack, vintage 2009. Poured from the bottle into a glass with a small beige head that receded quickly. Appearance is between amber and orange, with a slight haze throughout. The smell hits upfront with the pine and citrus scent of the hops. Also noticable is the caramel note from the malt, although it is not as prominent in the aroma. The flavor hits immediately with the pine and citrus notes of the hops. The taste that follows is the sweet caramel of the malts, to a much lesser extent than the hops in the beginning. The mouthfeel is crisp and light, which works well with beer, making it seem lighter than the ABV would indicate. The drinkability is decent considering the high ABV and the strong flavors. However, I have had more than a couple of these in one sitting and enjoyed them all.  Overall, this was a great barleywine and a solid offering from Sierra Nevada. Definitely recommended for anyone.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,cadenwhitaker,3.58,"Pours a clear red with a beige head  Smells of grapefruit, citrus, pine, brown sugar  Taste - lots and lots of hops, as to be expected, followed by immediate sweetness.  Overall - Despite all the great reviews I wasn't really expecting to like this beer, which I'll admit isn't a good way to approach a tasting. I'm just not as big a hop head as most others out there. With that said, I could see why people like this beer, it is crisp and complex, it tastes like it was brewed with care.  To sum it up I enjoyed it tasting it and I can't say I found anything really wrong with it, but one glass was just enough for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,earthboundagain,4.25,"12 brown bottle, 2009 on the cap  A: Pours a clear orange red, nice off white head that is very light and fluffy. Retention was not the greatest. But had a thin lacing that lasted till the bottom of the glass.  S: Wow the aroma is great, very pleasant and it hits you before you even get close to the glass. I can smell lots of big pine, some citrus, and bread, plus much more the smell is very complex.  T&M: Now that is a taste, nice and big and bitter. Lots of pine and citrus, malt is in there too. There is a lot here, and I really can not tell you everything. Great body that's starts bitter but smoothes out some as you go. Very clean with a good amount of carbonation, the aftertaste is not bad but it stays with you.  D: This one is an odd critter, it is very drinkable but at the same time is a sipper. Its taste and aroma make you want to drink it all down, but I think this beer deserves the time to be enjoyed. This is my first Barleywine and my first Sierra Nevada product, and I am impressed with both. While I may not be able to tell you all the taste and aromas, I can tell you that it is good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Durge,3.79,"Found on tap at The Great Lost Bear in Portland, Maine, I couldn't resist trying this after enjoyment from the numerous bottled versions. This poured an orangey amber with a nice full off-white head and similar lacing. The aroma surprised me to seem somewhat non-descript. The usual citrus was not pronounced in this tulip glassful. I did get some mild malt sweetness and a hint of the grapefruit, but I found it odd that the this would be less impressive on tap, and unfortunately the taste followed suit. The flavor matched the aroma with the addition of that familiar bubblegum overtone. It had nice medium bodied creaminess with decent small bubble carbonation and was decidedly drinkable but this just didn't strike me the way bottle Big Foot has always managed to impress me. I wondered if maybe the taps here at the Bear were less than perfect in delivering this fine brew. Still, it wasn't bad, just more ordinary I guess, and a bit of a disappointment.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,RuntoBarleywine,4.33,"2009:  Outstanding beer! As soon as that beer hits the glass you catch the aroma of hops which pulls you in. At first taste the taste buds are covered in a tasty combo of hops with a hint of sweetness, not sweet tasting. It is a fun beer to drink, looks good in your glass and it is a wonder to taste. Truly if you want to try an American Barleywine this is the one.  The head starts okay when you pour, not a big crown which this beer definitely deserves, but as the beer sits in your glass the head dwindles to nothing, letting you focus on the beer's beauty as you drink it. A beautiful medium dark amber color the whole way from pour to finish.  Definitely going to store at least a six pack in the cellar. I look forward to tasting how this beer ages over the next five plus years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,mothman,4.32,"Enjoyed some of these with ThePeskyDingo  Poured into New Belgium Globe Glass  Bubbles stuck to the inside of the glass. Pours a 1 finger tan head, some what pillow-toped. Good retention with splattered lace. Color is a clear copper ruby.  Aroma is very complex. Pine hops, citrus fruits, honey, and bready malts.  Taste: Hops, hops, and more hops. This beer follows the sierra nevada line-up for sure. Piny hops, honey, grapefruit, bready malts, just like the smell. Alcohol peeps out a little here. For some reason this beer reminds me of a couple month old hopslam.  Mouthfeel is bitter at first then it gets a little smoother, but still pretty bitter. Decent carbonation and has a very clean aftertaste.  Overall a hoppy beer that I really enjoyed. If I had tasted this blindly, I would have thought it was a double ipa. It is, however, a sipper at 9.6% abv.  Edit: had a side by side tasting with 08 and 09 and here are a few notes.  The 08 was a lot farmer. Hops faded a little but the beer developed very well. Color is more hazy for the 08. The Aroma is sweeter/ not as hoppy. Overall, I enjoyed the 09 hops but I loved the developed flavor of the '08. Simply an amazing beer. - Drinking a 2022 only a few months old. Still enjoying this one. Once did a huge vert back to 98 or something but lost my notes. This is piney, resiny, dank, weedy, but also packs the caramel, toffee, and bread pudding malts. So damn floral and bitter. Drinks like an imperial ipa almost. Not bad for 2.39 a bottle ;)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,Gyle41386,4.43,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours what I guess I'd call a reddish copper. Highlights of orange in there, too. Couple fingers of head, beautiful lacing.  Smells, well, like a Sierra Nevada beer. Big citrus and pine from the C-hops. Loads of caramel malt as well. Very nice aroma.  The flavors are every bit as big as they were in the nose. The sweet caramel malt leads the way, and then the hops take control. Big citrus, big pine feel on the tongue. I love Sierra Nevada's choice of hops. The intense malt sweetness and intense hop bitterness are perfect matches for each other.  Long finish, coats the entire mouth like cough syrup. Full body, great rich texture. It's boozy without feeling boozy. Incredibly smooth drinker. The feel is just...perfect. Not much more to say. The 9.6% keeps this from being an all night drinker, but it begs you to take another sip. Just an awesome barleywine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,johnmichael712,4.45,"This is the fourth Bigfoot that I've had from the 2009 vintage, and I decided that it's high time I review this absolutely beastly barley wine.  Appearance: Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into a nonic glass. This beer pours a beautiful mix of orange, copper, amber, and red and is exceptionally clear. The head is a dark khaki/sand color with a stiff, sticky appearance and it leaves an absolutely huge amount of lace behind on the glass. So much lace, in fact, that my glass is barely translucent by the time I finish.  Smell: The nose of this beer has a very rich and overwhelming maltiness that resonates with strong notes of caramel and sweet malts. There is also a strong citrusy hop aroma in the nose, and the C-hops (Cascade, Chinook, and Centennial in this particular beer) are definitely on display in this one. There are also faint hints of mustiness and earthiness, and this is one fabulous smelling barley wine.  Taste: Bigfoot has a flavor as big as his footprint, and this beer is well balanced with intense hop bitterness and equally intense, yet rich, malt flavor. The malts are what start this beer out, with a sweet and syrupy taste that has very strong notes of caramel and toasted malt. After that, however, this beer is all about the hops, and the C-hops that I mentioned earlier come rushing in with much ado. The flavor moves to an intense leafy bitterness with strong notes of lemongrass, grapefruit, tangerine, and bitter orange peel, and this insane hoppiness leads to a finish that is obstinately long and has a prominent alcohol taste along with a hoppy bitterness that leaves me swearing I can taste the hop leaves.  Mouthfeel: This beer is exceptionally full-bodied and chewy, and it has a luscious, velvety texture that is hard not to love. The alcohol is there, but it doesn't reach a solventy or hot mouthfeel. There is also a very light amount of carbonation, and this beer has one incredible mouthfeel.  Drinkability: This beer is definitely a nightcap, and not something I ever see myself beginning a night of drinking with. The high ABV combined with the exceptionally long finish make this beer a definite sipper, and the hoppyness makes this beer a definite palate-destroyer. Regardless, this is one highly smooth and delicious beer, and I've had no problem finishes the 12 ounces of this sample.  Notes: Michael Jackson called this beer ""perhaps the world's hoppiest barley wine"", and although I haven't tried very many barleywines I am inclined to agree. This is definitely not a beer for the faint of heart or the faint of palate, and if you haven't gotten your palate accustomed to the deliciousness that lies within intensely hoppy beers this probably isn't a good starting point. To those that are ready, however, Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot is a rich, thick, and exceptionally flavorful and full-bodied barley wine that is hard not to love. A real ass-kicker of a beer, Bigfoot is something to be sipped and savored.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Brenden,4.38,"The color is a very deep brown that shines copper in the light. Maybe it's just my particular bottle, but once the head had gotten to about one finger of thick foam, it never dissipated. Sticky lacing is left everywhere in its wake. The smell is complex. Great, pure hops are the first thing on my nose. Grapefruit and pine with a pure fruit presence and lightly sweet malt. The taste is every bit as complex. Hops bitterness is strong but the flavors it brings out are glorious. Underlying is the malt, adding a bit of caramel sweetness. There's a certain earthiness to this brew as well, and light biscuit toastiness with some subtle fruit flavors round it out. One of the most balanced brews I've ever tasted. I can't stress the purity of the hops; I'm picturing raw, young, green buds right off the plant. By the by, this claims 9.6% ABV and I can barely tell as an aftertaste. Impressive. There's nothing remotely astringent about this brew. Drink this now and live.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Lambstrong,4.7,"Appearance: Dark amber, almost mahogany in color. Yellow head that quickly dissipates.  Aroma: Nice floral aroma. With barley wines I'm used to an upfront sweet smell mixes with phenol notes. I like this already.  Taste: Right away I got the sweet barley wines taste. However, the bold hops used meshed beautifully with this ale. I really enjoyed the intermingling of the sweet and bitterness. Two big thumbs up!  Mouthfeel: Not over carbonated which is appropriate for this style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,cdkrenz,4.5,"Update: My good friend Rob Hamilton, aka drizzam, gave me a 2001 edition. He offered it up back in September 2008. He had it stored in his fridge since he bought it way back when. I kept it at about 58 degrees since I inherited it.  Today, with the birthday of the late Michael Jackson (The Beer Hunter) I was informed that a world-wide toast was taking place. Whom was it that informed me? Well, it was drizzam. He also informed me that the Beer Hunter was a big fan of the Bigfoot. He suggested I pop the top on the 2001, so I did. I am amazed!  I didn't think this brew could actually get better. My only wish is that I had 3 more of this Bigfoot's brothers to share... with myself. (CK, March 27, 2009)  $7.99/Six Pack JR Liquor Stevens Point, Wisconsin  Appearance - An excellent pour with fast action and multiple shades of auburn. The hazy auburn turns light inside out offering a golden glow. The frothy white 1.5 inch head lingers temptingly. As the head thins it leaves a trail of white lace along the glass. This is a beautiful beer!  Smell - The fruity aroma was instantly noticeable as I poured the beer even a foot from nose. It has a deep ripened fruity scent that it very nice. The hoppy smell is also very noticeable and the two fragrances compliment one another very well.  Taste - A taste of fall. There is a fruity beginning and then a bitter finish. The one or two seconds of sweet fruit flow into the hops but the hoppiness really overwhelms the beer at the end. If it finished with a little less bite, it would be better than good.  Mouthfeel - This beer is smooth as silk. I'm so impressed with the way this beer feels, I wanna sleep with it.  ~ This ale was made for the most pure enjoyment that anyone can have with a beer. If you wanna sit back and relax with an excellent Sierra Nevada I suggest you invite the Sasquatch. And for $7.99/sixer, you can't go wrong.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,projectflam86,4.43,"A- 2009 poured slowly into a snifter. I had refrigerated initially but allowed to warm for a half hour before pouring. One of the most beautiful brews I have ever seen. Deep scarlet/amber color with dancing bubbles that look so inviting. A nice creamy tan head appears thick and stays around for the entire experience.  S- Almost too complex to pinpoint. The nose starts out with earthy hops and piney fruit scents (mostly grapefruit and apple?) Malt and some alcohol smells can be detected as well.  T- This one has a bit of a kick! Strong initial hops give way to a wonderful cascade of earth and fruit flavors. The alcohol is very detectable but isn't bothersome. The malt gives a nice sweet balance but the hops know who is boss. Ester and citric flavors are more pronounced as the beer warms.  M- Incredibly smooth full body with a nice amount of carbonation.  D- I have to admit, this is my first barleywine, but now I know what all of the fuss is about. Bigfoot is a must try. This brew demands respectful sips and the high ABV will make you pay if you don't.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Bobo77,4.44,"Suprised to see this around here but Friar Tuck's had it. Poured a thick dark brown body with a light brown lumpy head. We are off to a good start.  Smell- I am very surprised, though I shouldn't be because it comes from Sierra Nevada the purveyors of ultra-hoppy West Coast beers, but this Barleywine smells citrusy!  Taste-After having tried a few different Barleywines several years ago, one being Brooklyn's Monster Ale, I had decided that it was a style best avoided as it just seemed to me to be a syrupy malty mess. But back then I also didn't like hops and since my tastes have since changed, and also since I discovered food pairings such as cheese with beer, I thought that I would go ahead and give this style another chance as well. Hops come out way in front, they are the first thing and last thing you will take note of in this beer. Malt is there but is subordinated by the citrusy West Coast hop domination. Don't get me wrong, you do taste the malt but much in the same way that Wasabi comes through when eating sushi (at least when the Wasabi is fresh) the hops come through. This makes this beer much more interesting. As I finish another sip, my lips are sticking together from the oily hops.  As for pairing this with food my brother and I knocked back a couple of these with some Stilton that I picked up at Global Foods in Kirkwood and the two complimented each other very well (Gorgonzola would work too.) Just remember, strong beer = strong cheese.  Something else I noticed, after knocking back a couple of these, you will feel a nice buzz as Bigfoot packs a mighty 8+% ABV.  Mouthfeel is rich and thick, this is without a doubt a sipping beer and definately not for the novice beer drinker. It may be one that a beer drinker has to work their way up to like I have.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,rwdkosak,3.89,"Poured from bottle at cellar temp produced a short-lived head but exceptional color. Dark amber, clear and very much wine-like when light shining through the glass.  Smell is average, some floral and malt detected but nothing huge on the nose but still pleasant and certainly no hint of 9+% ABV.  Taste is better up front and on the finish though something about the bitterness in the middle distracts me though not at all a deal breaker; this is a very drinkable beer.  Overall a great example of the style. Especially given it's available in most local stores, served up in six-packs.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,BirdFlu,4.25,"Pours a very dark amber with thick, foamy white head and ruby highlights when light passes through the glass.. Smells strongly of hops, floral, piney and with some candy-like sweetness just behind it. The flavor follows the smell in that the hops are at the forefront in a big way, to the extent even of an IPA on the first few sips. But there is a sweetness behind it which grows as the beer opens up a bit and settles towards room temperature.. This isnt so much a malty sweetness but sugary and a bit fruity. Its very complex but its sort of a journey (like searching for a sasquatch) in that you have to search for it a bit. The mouth is moderate with sort of a full body and prominent, crisp carbonation. Its refreshing though it almost approaches syrup-like quality in the sweetness. This brings down its drinkability a bit. Overall its great, but its very ""big"" in a lot of ways.. the floral aspect is really out at the forefront and I could stand the hop character brought down a pinch, but it becomes much more complex as you get through it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Nice lacing on the glass  Smells Malty, with hops in the background.  Tastes hoppy and malty, with citrus flavors. Alcohol is hidden pretty well.  Medium to low carbonation, leaves my mouth dry and clean.  Easy to drink for me, but i love hoppy beers. It goes down easy, and the taste lingers for a while which is nice.  The 2008 version tasted side by side with the 2009 version there is a big difference.  The '08 is hazier than the '09.  the smell has less hops in it, and more malt.

Appearance- Beautiful lacing down the sides of my glass; a deep amber color in appearance.  Smell- Upfront smell that of sugars and malt; a second whif with nose and mouth picks up hops. The hops smell dominates on a third sniff.  Taste - Initial sweet upfront flavor transitions to a hoppy bite; settles back to a sweet flavor with mild citrus notes as swallowing. While a fan of hops; I prefer my beers more malty and European in style. The hops I feel are just a tad overwhelming.  Mouth - Thick and smooth; it is seems velvety.

S- Hops up front... sweet and citrusy. Piney hops too. Refreshing. Finishes slightly fruity. Bit of caramel malt in there too.  T- Piney hops up front with a bite. Stronger malty flavor than apparent in the nose, slightly roasty. I get a little fruit in there too, darker fruits, but not quite sure what they are. Finishes dry. Slightly boozy, not a bad BW, though there are better BWs out there.  M- Creamy, medium-to-light carbonation. Medium body.  D- A little tough.

140,2671,BarrelO,3.83,"12oz bottle poured into a goblet. After my experiment with warming up Stone IRS ended up such a smashing success, I've decided to do the same with other highly regarded beers I've found too harsh in the past. So after 40 minutes on the counter, here we go.  A: Pours a gorgeous ruby red color. A two finger head eventually withers away to nothing. A decent amount of lacing.  S: A wave of hops, like walking through a pine forest. Malts linger meekly in the background.  T: Well, so much for warming it up causing it to mellow out. The hops are just as overwhelming as ever. The caramel malt makes a valiant effort to make itself heard, but it doesn't stand a chance against the hop blitzkrieg. After a while, though, it starts to grow on you. I can't really explain it, but it does reach a nice equilibrium on the palate. Not great, but pretty good.  M: Thick enough to keep you from quaffing too enthusiastically, but not so much so as to be intimidating.  D: Honestly, I think it's a bit too raw when fresh, albeit not undrinkably so. Sometime last year, I had a 2007 Bigfoot, and I remember it being a bit more balanced. What it comes down to, though, is that I have a problem with the idea of a beer that has to be laid down before it's any good. Why not just make a beer that's good fresh? Or alternatively, why not age the beer before you release it?",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,rowew,4.28,"Presentation: 12 oz short bottle, typical Sierra Nevada style label in blue, with someone examing footprints. Large 2009 on the neck. Cryptic date code, ABV is on the side.  Appearance: Clear dark amber color with a good sized tan colored head, great retention and lacing.  Smell: Hops dominate, with grassy aromas, and then a bit of malt sweetness and some dark fruit in the background. Definitely hops up front, though.  Taste: A nice mix of hop flavors (sticky resinous flavors) along with some peppery spice, plenty of malt. Some vinous flavors in there too - like a good dark wine.  Overall impression: Probably the classic American barleywine. Some age mellows the flavors and rounds out the edges a bit, but I prefer it fresh. Definitely pick up at least one six pack every time it comes out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Rainne,4.5,This is the one that I was introduced to barley wines with and boy was that the way to go. I've had this enough times and made some revisions to an original review.  A- Awesome. Deep reddish brown in color with a thick fat head and sticky lacing.  S- Mmm. Grapefruit citrus and piney hops right away. Fruit alcohol and sweet malt finishes it up.  T- Just what I expected from the smell. Maybe a tad fruitier than in the nose and a little stronger on the alcohol but not too much. Great balance.  M- Nice and thick and smooth. Good full body.  D- The first and best barley wine I ever had. Drink and enjoy.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,KevinBrewer,4.35,"A: Beautiful dark amber in color with yellow hues around the edges. 1/2 inch off-white head that dissipates to a fine layer of foam. Plenty of lacing all the way down.  N: Wow! A beautiful floral bouquet of hops fills the nostrils. A moderate melon fruitiness and honey blend perfectly with the hops, and the perfect touch of biscuity malt supports it all. I get a stinging touch of alcohol when I swirl the glass vigorously before smelling.  T: Bitter and floral hops up front with a light sweet maltiness underneath. Melon in the background with a touch of orange blossom honey. The bitterness lasts throughout and is the dominating flavor. Bitterness is a little harsh, but not bad. This is a great barleywine, but I can tell it will get much better with age.  M: Medium-light body, moderate carbonation, and a bone-dry finish.  D: At 9.6% ABV, one is the perfect amount. Very enjoyable. Drinkability is appropriate for the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Much like other Barleywines I have enjoyed; nothing exceptionally unique, but inviting nonetheless.  T..Wow -- this is easily the best barleywine I have had yet. Complex malt and hops flavors with hints of roasted nuts perhaps? Deliciously sweet.  M..Considering the 9.6% ABV, this beer is not at all drying. Full bodied on the mouth with a slight warming quality.  D..Easy enough to drink that I could consider this a session beer, albeit a somewhat short session at nearly 10%. Smooth and refreshing I must say. I am very impressed with this barleywine and I look forward to my next six pack.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Taste is sweet and follows with a alcohol bitterness. Initial moutfeel is loaded with carbonation with a bit of malty smoothness. I received this one in a trade and enjoyed it but I believe it may improve with time.  I haven't journied into the barleywine style since I first started drinking craft brew about 3-4 years ago and I have just discovered I was missing a wonderful style.

140,2671,biegaman,4.13,"2008 Vintage - 25th Anniversary Edition - sampled 18/03/09  Luscious raspberry puree with a bit of cantaloupe polish near the bottom end - if I worked in the cosmetic industry I'd be sure to have a lipstick made in this colour. The beer has such a healthy glow when held up to the light, the rosy brilliance is striking. The scantiness of head manages to provide outline but largely denies the beer of contrast.  The bitterness of the beer can be sensed from the smell at first instance. Pungent, earthy hops bombard the nasal passage with a cannonball of grassy vines, bitter serum and crushed up tree bark. This is much less the zest of citrus than it is the piths. There is something very inelegant about this scent that I don't remember noting in the best smelling Barleywines. (Note: I've revisited and upped the marks, this is delicious!)  The flavour is dominated by a very harshly roasted malt bill. It tastes as though the grains and their husks are still in tact. Notes of burnt toffee, dark chocolate and dried fruits unfold. Given the richness in the colour I'm surprised the beer isn't more sweet (I know from experience the sweeter caramel malts will come forth more once the hops begin to fade).  Speaking of those little lupullin pellets, they impart a discernibly earthy character as well as a grapefruit pith so bitter it will cause your cheeks to suck in (this wouldn't be a classic West Coast staple if it didn't have a little citrus!) American Barleywines age well but also drink wonderfully young when the copious level of hoping is on full display.  But on that note, I think I personally prefer this Barleywine aged. Like the creature after whom it's named, I find the beer a little beastly and brute at a young age. Unlike him, however, the alcohol can often be seen in plain sight. Not to say it doesn't have some camouflage (caramel drizzle and candied fruits) but I was hoping not to have spotted it.  Having sampled previous vintages and older bottles, I can be fairly assured that all my qualms with this batch should fade as it matures over time. The fact that the beer is still this tempestuous at age 1 tells me it'll be fine to hold up over the long haul. Indeed, I always look forward to revisiting this beer and have never finished the glass anything but satisfied.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,kkosmoski,3.95,"The new 2009 vintage served into a snifter glass. A very nice looking ale in the glass - clear light red color with a dense cream colored head on top. A very pungent, raw hop aroma comes off of this. Grass, pine, lemon, toast and caramel are all in the nose. The flavor starts out fruity with hints of orange and sugary dried fruits. After the initial fruity sweetness, a firm, citrusy bitterness grabs ahold. Some toast and maybe a bit of light roast try to budge in toward the finish, but they are squashed down pretty quickly by the crushing bitterness. A sticky citrus bitterness remains in the aftertaste and really doesn't go anywhere between sips. Feel in the mouth is thick with a moderate carbonation. I feel like the fresher this beer is, the harder it is to drink, not to say that I don't like it, just from a drinkability standpoint.  The bigfoot is an increadibly complex and intriguing ale. While the hop aromas are very nice fresh, I think that the bitterness is a little too raw and brash. It is alot better drinking around 6-12 months in my opinion. The rest of the sixer will be resting in the cellar for a while.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The hop presence is very smooth and well-balanced, almost like its pre-aged. Very nice.  Mouthfeel is full-bodied... very thick and creamy, with carbonation right in the middle. Finish is sweet and piney. It's a big beer, so while a sipper, it's one that you will want to keep sipping.  Tonight Bigfoot joins Celebration as one of my favorite Sierra Nevada beers.

140,2671,bamadog,3.85,"I guess I finally worked up the courage to try this offering from Sierra Nevada. I eyed it up a few times and just decided it was time. Poured from the bottle into a trusty pint glass.  Appearance: A nice deep ruby color - not quite what I was expecting as I thought it would be a little lighter. 1/2 finger head appeared, but that slipped quickly into a firm skim that seemed a little chewy. No real carbonation to speak of and the beer appears to be very clear and free of sediment. Firm lacing and oil coat the sides of the glass on the swirl.  Smell: Strong hop present, bitter and piney. a slight floral bouquet to it as well. The hops are a nice touch - I've read that this an especially hoppy barleywine, and those reviews were clearly not holding anything back. I'm excited because I find that in these bigger beers that bitterness is sometimes subdued by a malty/carmelly sweetness.  Taste: Wow. Hops are super present and this comes across wonderfully bitter with an earthy/piney attribute and aftertaste. There is a malty/honey-like sweetness in there as well, and a strong presence of alcohol. I like the hoppiness, but I've been told this really mellows with age so I'm strongly considering picking some more up to wax and wait about a year to see what happens...  Mouthfeel: Feels very thick and full in the mouth - chewy. Mouth warms tremendously as well from the alcohol combined with the awesome bitterness that's present. Leaves a syrupy/oily coating throughout the mouth.  Drinkability: I should explain the lower number here: this is an amazing beer and I truly enjoyed it, but the ABV is too big for me to drink much, and the sweetness becomes a little sickly sweet to me after the end of the glass. It's part of the style and I recognize that, but my personal preference is certainly being considered here too.  Overall I strongly recommend this - but it's not something that I think I could endulge in often.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The head formed nicely just above three fingers and slowly settled to a clear, rich copper-red color between drinks. The ale left strong distinct, lacing that gave a good history of my drinks. It had a strong hop aroma that carried from start to finish, with a very sweet bouquet. The mouthfeel was great with a balanced amount of bitterness for the aftertaste. I savored each drink but I do recommend drinking this one slowly. This was a very tasty ale and I was suprised when I discovered the ABV was upward of 9%!

HUGE, BIG and perfectly balanced. There is sweetness and depth of malt. But the hop punch counteracts this perfectly. I get more of a straight grapefruit pith finish.... Tastes fresh from front to back... Funny the more I enjoyed the beer the more pine resin flavor/feel I sensed.  Thick and almost syrupy mouth feel. A sipper for sure. But a joy...

Finish is long, lightly bitter, and toasty.  Mouthfeel is smooth, syrupy, and with a light underlying carbonation that perks this slow sipper up just enough.

As it warms, malt comes through a bit more, but still subdued. Alcohol is big in the taste, but not more than normal for this style. Slightest butter taste as it warms further. Volatile in your mouth, residual bitterness on back of tongue. Sweeter as it warms. Also more tangy and ever so slightly soapy.  Mouthfeel is very good. good carbonation. some substantial body to it. Volatile and hot from all the alcohol, but not enough to make it unpleasant really.  Drinkability: Pretty huge. Apparently I don't hate barleywines, I just hate Old Horizontal.

The flavor is sweet and spicy, with a bit of cinnamon and pepper and a lovely deep, sour cherry flavor that plays right into the mouth-puckering bitterness at the back of the tongue. The alcohol is present but muted behind the malty power of the beer. It finishes with a long, slow peppery burn down the tongue. The mouthfeel is clingy and beautiful.

Bubbles are still rising from the depths as the head recedes slightly.  The smell is a powerful dose of fruity citrus, grapefruit, pineapple hops sitting on a bed of melted caramel. The hops dominate. There is also a grassy leafy note to the smell, like the hops were added to my glass along with the beer.  The taste is big! Huge dose of caramel malts up front with some notes of fruity and maple sweetness. The back end is a display for the hops. Pine, citrus, pineapple, grass,... it is all in here!

140,2671,Phillyduke,3.63,"*** 2002 RELEASE (Tasted 03/11/2009)*** Received this beer in a BIF from a friend in California. I'm a bit concerned about oxidation with the screw-top cap, but I'm hoping for the best...here goes!  A: Poured into a snifter leaving a fair amount of sediment in the bottle. Beer is a murky mahogany brown with a thin tan head that dissipates quickly, leaving only a few soapy bubbles on the surface. Very little lacing to speak of. This is a beer that has certainly settled out. - 4.0  S: Heavy, rich doughy malts with the noticeable presence of alcohol. Slightly sweet. A faint hint of dark dried fruit. Hops are all but gone. Not getting any oxidation though [that's a good thing!] - 3.5  T/M: Sadly, I think this one has passed its prime. It didn't go bad during its 8+ years in the cellar, but the flavor profile's no longer there. Taste is thin and diluted, with the most prevalent flavors being the alcohol and caramel malt. Sweetness does pick up towards the end, and does a nice job of covering up the alcohol. What flavor there is smooth and creamy (and enjoyable considering I'm drinking an 8-year old beer). Feel is thick, syrupy and a bit flat...but still rich. Finish is subtle and sweet, but the faintest twinge of bitterness lingers on the palate. - 3.5/3.5  D/O: For a vintage beer, I was pleasantly surprised with how well this held up. Having had many releases of Bigfoot, however, I was disappointed to see how far this had faded. I'm not sure how long people are aging their Barleywines, but I think 8 years may be a bit too long for this one if you want to get the robust flavor this beer is known for. - 4.0",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Smells of floral hop goodness with some pine. Very earthy containing an abundance of bold smells which can perhaps be attributed to the high ABV.  Strong dry pine and floral hops. Starts off strong only to grow stronger. The ABV is noticeable, but not overly so as it blends pretty well in the hops. There is some noticeable malt but the hops still stand out.  Thicker than anticipated. Is slightly similar to syrup in feel, a bit lighter. Sharp but suiting for the taste.  While the beer is strong, it's also full of flavor.

Smell: Moist pine, resinous hops, molasses, some earth, and possibly some doughy malts to round it out. Seemed a bit faint.  Taste: Brace yourself for a big smack of bitter, oily, hops. Sticky, mucky, hop gunk everywhere! (I mean that in a good way.) An assortment of other flavors join the mix as well: wet, chewy, pine; oak; molasses; doughy malts; spices; and a nice alcoholic burn. WhooOO, this beer is a bitch! Beware rookies!  Mouthfeel: Chewy as hell and sticky to boot. Makes me think of hop taffy (if there were such a thing). Covers the entire mouth instantly and finishes pretty dry. There's also a good deal of mouth warming and numbing, as should be expected from a beer that's nearly 10%.

Piney, woody/earthy, and citric.  Hop flavor/bitterness is dominant and aggressive. Too much so.

Bitterness increases and becomes more oily long into the aftertaste. Nice warming alcohol presence.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy.  Overall I was able still to enjoy it. Hops are way overdone in my opinion though. Drinkability is low due to the harshness and acidity. You can actually still taste hops in your mouth for the rest of the evening.

140,2671,jnn4v,3.73,"This is a review of a fresh bottle of the 2009 Bigfoot. Not to be confused with any Bigfoot with age on it.  A: mahogany and cherry hues. A deep reddish brown barley wine color. Appears to be moderately carbonated with a small to medium sized light foamy head.  S: When cold. alcohol dominated the scent. As it warmed, several different malt elements began to rise to the surface including molasses, vanilla, caramel and a woody scent.  T: Hops, warm coppery malt, and a rush of sugar toward the end of the first wave of flavor. Followed by a drier bitterness from the lingering hops. Possibly some cedar or a spicy woodiness.  M: Thick, but not syrupy. More carbonation than expected. Not bad, but not spectacular. I'm looking forward to the mouthfeel a few years from now.  D: Perhaps Sierra Nevada was prepping this for long cellaring by overhopping and overcarbonating it in advance. It's still drinkable now, but tastes more like a high-hop DIPA than a barleywine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Groenebeor,4.56,"This beer is colossal. I was impressed with the big taste, smoothness, the malt, the hops...  Served in a bottle poured into a pint glass.  Smelled like a thicker IPA...  Tasted.. like god. A really great brew, very hoppy, malty, with some nutty taste throughout, bitter at first sweet to end it with.  Very thick mouth feel, so good, not too much carbonation.  Not that drinkable, but decent. I loved it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,blaje,3.49,"This is a long awaited drink for me...  Pourred from a bottle in a pint glass. Served chilled. It revealed itself as a reddish, deep amber color without haziness. Little head over it, &lt; 1cm and white that was gone in a few minutes.  Nose: Nose is a bit disapointing. I was expecting something great, but in fact, it was faint. no pine nor citrus scent as expected. Floral smell is present.  Mouth: Good carbonation for a barleywine, I was surprise. The taste... well I guess everything is in the tatse for me. The nose wasn't revealing much, but this beer really reveals itself in the mouth. Bitterness is well present (around 100 IBU I guess). Bitterness with a twist, bittersweet? A slight caramel taste from the efty quantity of malt is present. LONG bitter aftertaste  Ageing?: yes, it will age well. Will mellow down the bitterness and aftertast for a more caramelized taste...  Overall, a good barleywine, but would have hope for something better since that I heard so much about it. will buy again, but not on my priority list.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,wheatyweiss,4.07,"2009 12 ounce shorty bottle poured into a snifter.  Pours a mahogany hue, ruddy red with a small off white head that recedes quickly.  Aroma is full blown fruity hops. Slightly floral and hinting at a fresh grapefruit. Caramel malts come through barely, but they are there.  Flavor is hops upfront, the flavor belies the aroma as the hops are peppery and biting. Alcohol follows with a chewy malt backing that barely balances the hop. Hops in the middle are resinous and piney. I would almost guess Simcoe, but the site says Chinook. Alcohol sneaks back in on the finish as well as the cracked black pepper flavor of the hops.  Mouthfeel is lush and oily, perfect carbonation.  Very nice brew, the bitterness would be helped by a little more malt backing, but overall very good.  (2010 batch)  This year is way more balanced than last. The alcohol is hidden way better than the last batch. Very smooth and drinkable. Be careful!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,JohnWaynes44,3.58,"Appearance: 2009 pours beautiful reddish brown in a chalice. Golden hue on the edge in the light. Thick half finger tan head. I can never get a proper head in this type of glass.  Smell: Sweet malts, caramels, and alcohol on the nose.  Taste is bold, robust slam of hops and charcoal. Sweetness shows at first but fades into a bitter, ester, alcohol taste. Malts and caramels are almost there but are lost and overpowered by hops and alcohol. Leaves a charcoal, bitter taste in mouth  Mouth: Smooth in the front, warm medium body, dry and bitter finish.  Overall drinkability: I think this one needs to rest for at least a year to mellow. It is a bit harsh in the end. I love the upfront hops and sugar, but I don't care for the harsh, charcoal, alcohol finish. It does though, like most high abv brews, get a little more drinkable towards the bottom of the glass. Probably should be served a little warmer than my beer fridge setpoint.

140,2671,sevopie,3.61,"Appearance - Brilliant amber/ruby color with a beautifully rocky off-white/tan head. One of the most beautiful looking beers ever.  Smell - Some sweet citrusy hops are clearly evident, with a small dose of caramel malts hiding in there as well.  Taste - This one is hoppier than the beast that is celebration. Celebration walks the fine line of beauty, this one crosses it. There's also a lot of candy sweetness in here as well, with the caramel malt not hiding at all. Overall, I think things were a little too overpowering to be perfect, with that slight hint of alcohol greeting you under the bitter/sweet blend. Then again, it is a 10% barleywine.  Mouthfeel - This one just about gets about it right. Creamy, oily smooth, with a good blend of carbonation.  Drinkability - The alcohol becomes more prevalent as it warms, and the overwhelming nature of the flavors detract some from overall drinkability. As a whole though, its a very solid brew, and a damn bargain at $11 for a sixer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,washburnkid,4.6,"2009 bigfoot.  A: Over a finger of creamy beige head; body is a reddish-brown and amber mixture with copper tones along the edges. Beautiful head retention that refuses to leave me. I've been nursing this beer for an hour and the head is still sticking at the very top of the glass. So incredible. S: Heavy herbal aromas with the pine that is reminiscent of Torpedo. Florals deeper in the aroma though not as strong as the other scents. Some hints of malts on the nose. T: At first, the flavors include incredibly hoppy and bitter notes, including florals that just dominate my palate. The bitter flavor is someone charred or burnt at different points in the sip. There's a malty backbone that, in the beginning, provides an intense syrupy sweetness that balances the hop and bitter presence. Eventually this sugar shop sweetness just dominates, leaving the hops to cry for attention. M: Heavy, syrupy body that is carbonated just right and leaves a ton of malty residue in my mouth. D: This beer is tricky. It starts out so hoppy but the sweetness just completely takes over, making this beer wonderful for dessert. Next time, I'll split a bottle for after dinner--mostly because of the immense sweetness that pulls through. I'd love to know what this beer tastes like after a couple of years.

140,2671,StrangeBrewer76,4.68,"With many hundreds of reviews of this beer there is nothing but my personal experience with it that could be informative at all. Even my personal story is likely repeated here a few times chances are.  I bought a case thinking I would review one, drink a few and cellar the rest for next year knowing how well they age. As you may have guessed, that was not the case. I drank the first 23 in less than two weeks while also drinking other stuff. I went out of my way to buy really good beers so I would forget about the bigfoot. This also did not work. I tried keeping them warm (room temp) so I would be less tempted, but I found myself throwing 'just one' into the freezer but when I went to drink it, I determined it to be 'too cold' and instead of waiting for it to warm up, I had the genius idea of mixing it with a warm one.  This is the first beer that I have been addicted to in a literal sense. The only solution is to review this last one and wait until next year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The smell of citrus hops, some caramel notes, and a hint of malt.  The taste is really nice.

Beautiful lacing in the glass.  S = Spicy Hoppy scent. smells like it tastes as far as bitterness is concerned. for the %ABV, there wasn't much raw alcohol smell. Aroma is almost flowery. I'd wear this as aftershave...  T = bitterness grips the side of my tongue and lingers a good 30 seconds or more. Flowery, spicy and intensely hoppy blend of flavors. a verry small astringency from the alcohol is detected, but the bitterness almost drowns it.  M = Damned near creamy in the first few sips with the nice head on top. heavy bodied. Once the head is mostly gone (it never really seems to fully dissipate), the mouthfeel is very full. Just a sip at a time thoroughly coats every taste bud.  D = Lookout! It is tempting to sip sip sip. It does taste good, but like cheesecake, for me it was very filling.  General Comments: Possibly the best smelling beer I've come across, with a taste and mouthfeel to nearly match. The %ABV is a drawback I feel since it is so powerful it can't really be enjoyed in great quantities except for Irish or Italian people! .... Wait.... I'm Irish-Italian...Pour me another! This brew would be best enjoyed alongside a sophisticated meal requiring a palate-cleanser. Possibly Duck, Oysters on the half shell, or perhaps a Beef Wellington. Food pairings aside, for tobacco aficionados, try enjoy with your fullest flavor cigar or a very strong aromatic pipe tobacco. This beer is an excellent palate cleanser.

140,2671,Clydesdale,3.88,"A: A deep brownish-orange with a tall, dense, foamy and creamy light tan head. Retention is impressive, and lacing is solid.  S: Some sweet caramel malt up front. Citric hop notes, mostly orange and grapefruit. A moderate alcoholic nose as well. I get some apple peel hints too.  T: Grapefruit and orange rind up front, giving a bitter start. A nice dose of sweet, sugary caramel malts throughout the body. Rather aggressive alcohol flavor towards the finish, along with another dose of pithy, citrus rind bitterness. Some piny flavors accompany the hops as well.  M: A touch light for the style. Rather crisp, given the carbonation and the aggressive hops and alcohol. A riding, biting dry bitterness into the finish.  D: Very tasty and extremely hoppy for the style. This drinks like a hybrid between a barleywine and a robust double IPA. A real sipper, given the relatively unmasked alcoholic nature.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ToddT,3.93,"A- Deep amber color with a huge off white head. Head is long lasting and leaves lots of lacing on the glass.  S- Noticeable aroma of grapefruit, hops and alcohol. Subtle notes of fruit, apple, and caramel that is pretty well hidden behind the hops.  T- Hop bitterness right away then some sweetness from caramel and malt balance this out. The bitterness carries through to the finish, which is dry slightly and astringent with alcohol esters and a second burst of the grapefruit hop bitterness.  M- Light in the mouth for a barley wine, medium carbonation. Somewhat viscous but no heavy aftertaste finishes dry and clean.  D- For a barley wine this is easy to drink. The 9.6% ABV is well hidden, but you will feel it's warmth after about three sips. Due to the strength you will probably not want more than one or two in a sitting.  Review is for the 2009 vintage. For a fairly fresh barley wine this is well done. I can't wait to see what this tastes like in a couple of months or a year or two. Buy a case and put some away for the future. In this economy it could be your best investment.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,nc41,4.03,"I have to admit my Barley Wine experience in very minimal so I'm hesitant to pass judgment. But this is a big Ale, massive in every respect with respect to flavor. I find it un balanced, and too sweet in the middle, could use more hop bitterness to round out the sweetness. I'm not sure what the IBU's are and I really don't care this one needs a little more bitterness, and a touch more effervescence, mouth feel for me is tricky, but this one is a little viscous because of the heavy malt. Very decent in most respects, but the possibilities... just missed a HR.  The above was for the 2009 Bigfoot. IMO the 2010 is much better. Bigger hop presence, nicely bitter, massive head that held to the very end. Smooth finish for such a big beer.

140,2671,spointon,4.15,"I poured this one from a 12oz stubby brown bottle into a shaker pint glass. This was the 2009 vintage.  A= With an aggressive pour, this ale appeared a very clear dark copper color with a 2"" fluffy white head. The head dropped to a 1/8"" cap that retained all the way down and left loads of sticky sheet lace.  S= This ale was all fresh citrus hops in the nose. Some pine notes as well as a biscuity malt aroma in there too. Modest alcohol presence.  T= This one had a load of hop bitterness right from the start. Sticky pine and grapefruit ruled the roost for sure. Despite all those hops, there was a caramel and biscuit malt backbone always hovering underneath the hops. The end was quite dry with a touch of alcohol.  MF= Medium bodied with a prickly carbonation feel.  D= This is a very good beer, but I think its a bit young still. The hops are at a DIPA bitterness and aroma level now, and the alcohol is a bit over the top. I think that some age will mellow those hops and soften the alcohol a bit. Even so, this beer will be good at any stage of its life.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

S - Sweet caramel and apples, cloves and raisins. Wonderful malt aromas!  T - Small sweet taste in the front, which I expected to be a little sweeter as is the case with most barleywines. Some hoppy bitterness though, a lot more than I am used to with this style. A lot of the bitterness is similiar to grapefruit rinds. None the less it's spiciness and bitterness makes it complex and tasty!  M - Fairly heavy with a thick body. Higher carbonation that expected. Still syrupy though, coats the pallet nicely.

A wonderful copper color that became spectacular when held against bar lights.  Some let down with the lack of aroma. Even as it warmed and I swirled, I couldn't pull much out. I was expecting more hop aroma.  Flavor was very smooth and balanced. I'm not sure if it was the bar aroma (non smoking) but it came out like the aroma. Nothing jumping out at you - just very smooth and well balanced.  It's probably not fair to make this comparison, but I had a Southern Tier Oak Aged Unearlthly on draft the night before. It may be the age of imperial IPA's have passed up barleywines for impressive punch (9% bigfoot to ~11% ST).  Overall a very nice entry point for me into the world of Barleywines.

Pours a deep copper in color with a sticky off-white head that leaves chunks of lace in my glass.  It's got that barleywine smell: Citrus hops mix with toffee and caramel notes and a hint of alcohol. Nice.  The taste is perfect. And I give very, very few 5's. This is what I think of when I think barleywine. It's bitter and malty with lots of hop flavors and a nice warming finish. It is not just a bitter beer: This has depth.  The body is thick and smooth and almost chewy with its heft.  This is one of my most favorite beers.

(4.0)  It still has that great, complex barleywine aroma of hops, malt, caramel, biscuit, alcohol and more things I can't identify. (4.0)  Time has done little to this beer's taste. If anything, it's even more bitter and tannic than when it's young. Alcohol flavors compete with the sharp bitterness, overriding biscuit and caramel flavors from the malt.

Taste is sweet roasted malts with a very full earthy hop bitterness. A hint of dark cocoa from the malts. Mouthfeel is very nice with moderate carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden by the full body. Very drinkable for the style. Will probably update or edit this review when I try the 2009 version in my beer fridge. Update: 2018 version.

It demands attention and but is not completely overwhelming.  Overall, very drinkable, especially for a nearly 10% barleywine. This year's version seems slightly more balanced than previous years.

Awesome lacing and retention.  Smell: No real barleywine properties in the aromas, huge floral hops explode here, nice dose of citrus, some nice spice aromas probably from the malt. Well balanced for sure.  Taste: At first you get a blast of hops, a very pleasant barelywine taste pokes through in the finish. Grapefruit, plum, and some other darker fruit are very evident. The finish consists of nice amount of coriander, grapes, and other spice properties. Taste alot like a DIPA until the finish, then you can really tell it's a barleywine styled beer.  Mouthfeel: Not overly carbonated which I liked, nice and malty and sits nice on the tongue. A bit of sour bitterness completes this excellent brew.  Drinkability: At 9.6 ABV, this is very sessionable, could be a dangerous one if you have too many in a sitting. Very easy to drink and very enjoyable.

Its a more balanced then my previous palette lead me to believe. this is a great dessert beer. I will be reaching for this one again, and am still interested in trying to age some of these, to see how they turn out.  Feb 4, 2022  Impressed that there is still a one finger head on this beer after 12 years. Still big, still sweet, but something in the back of my mouth does not agree with what I’m tasting - best I can describe it is it tastes like ear wax :( disappointed I waited so long to try crack this one open and it’s lost what made it great.

Good carbonation, light stick lacing. Excelelnt clarity.  S: Smell seems muted, expected more hop aromas. Sweet malts, booze.  T: Malts, caramel, alcohol, bitterness. Bitterness lingers.

140,2671,brianlg,3.31,"I had high expectations going into this beer. It poured very nice reddish brown color with a two finger head for me. The smell was subtle, but I have sinus problems! Anyways, the first sip i took I thought WOW this beer is bitter! I wasn't sure how I felt about it, but after a few more sips I found it hard to take down. I bit my teeth and took the rest of it down, with a struggle. I bought a 6 pack so I will revisit this beer in a while, hoping to change my mind. I was pretty disappointed. Maybe barleywine isn't my thing.  EDIT: After a couple more tries, this beer is growing on me. I feel I wasn't ready for it at the time I bought it and first tried it. I upped my review as this is a very well made beer, and I am beginning to like this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,imagineiii,4.14,"Poured into my trusty DFH snifter.  Agressive pour doesnt yield much of a head. What is there diminishes quickly leaving molasses brown syrup.  Very sweet. the alcohol, the citrus and pine from the hops, and the surprisingly light fruits like red apples, are all sweet.  Holy cow this beer is big. Starts with an intense biting acidity as soon as the beer hits your tongue. rolls to the back of the tongue with a bitterness from the immense hop profile. Pine is the most prevalent flavor in the hops.  Mouthfeel is enormous. Bitterness is lingering, and changes even after the beer is gone. alcohol is slightly tongue-numbing.  Hardly a drinkable beer overall, but considering its size, and hop profile, it is surprisingly mouthwatering.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Jdecarol,2.29,"I love hops in my beers but this thing is not balanced at all. I is nothing but bitter kicking in the back of your throat. Moon shine goes down smoother.  Looks great though but that doesn't make it easier to drink. I'm going to sit on it for a few months and revisit it after it mellows. Hopefully the aging doesn't destroy the hop flavor and just mellows the bitterness.  I had this last year but it was bought around june, maybe the extra months sitting on a shelf made it more palatable or they just hop bombed it this year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,TehAnkh,4.45,"This is my first barleywine EVER, so, here it goes...  2009 Bottle.  A: Pours a gorgeous, clear ruby/amber. with 2 fingers of big fluffy head that doesn't want to go anywhere but eventually recedes down to about half a finger of still frothy head. Big, frothy and chunky. The lacing is also spectacular, big bubbles cling to the glass like superglue.  S: Grassy and citrus hops on the nose, along with a big fat wallop of sweet malt. Also some raisin and a touch of alcohol comes to the nose upon swirling the glass a bit. This stuff SMELLS like it's gonna be bitter.  T: Flavor is like the smell, grassy and citrusy hops (kind of tastes like cannabis???) Sweet barley is in there somewhere, trying to come out, but this stuff is extremely herbal and musky. Wow, this tastes like grapefruit and bonghits, what the hell?  M: Extremely bitter and pretty heavy bodied. The bitterness isn't overwhelming but it definitely punches you in the teeth. Pretty creamy, kind of chewy, and very very nice.  D: Damned drinkable for as bitter-hoppy as it is. The alcohol isn't present at ALL other than being slightly apparent in the smell and a mild glow in the belly. It goes down smooth, and tastes even better as it warms up. I like it, a lot.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Psilo707,3.28,"Deep red ruby colors fill the glass once poured, and a decent amount of lacing covers the side of the glass as the liquid dissipates. The smell is one of overly done hops and barley and fills the nose with a strong aroma that can't be denied.  Taste is lesser than I thought quality wise. It seems like Sierrva Nevada attempted to fill this version of their ale with as much hops as they could, neglecting actual taste decency. Not too big of a fan. Although the mouthfeel brings it back slightly with a very creamy and solid feel.  Drinkability is alright, although I seriously would choose almost any Sierra Nevada over this. Overall, I'm somewhat dissapointed, despite the fact it's still a decent brew from the Sierra Nevada name.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Vonerichs,4.1,"Auburn color with an ever-so-slight creamy head that disperses fairly quick and a moderate lacing.  Smells like a load of citrus hops, followed by tones that are a combination of raisin and brown sugar. There is a slight detection of alcohol.  The taste is phenomenal. Bitter hops up front which gives way to a sweet brown sugar malt flavor. The alcohol is definitely present in this barleywine and lingers.  Mouthfeel is thick and well-carbonated.  As far as barleywines go, this is a little more drinkable than the average. While the alcohol is present, the hop/malt balance keeps it in check. At 10%, this can be a sneaky one and I can easily see myself having a few before I realize it's too late.  This is a 2009 brew and I've stashed one away and will give it another rip in a year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,thekevlarkid,4.2,"On tap at the Scuffer in Burlington I was able to enjoy this famous beer. My pint was delivered to me a deep ruby color with good clarity and some rising carbonation. The one-finger head was beige, the retention good and the lacing consistent. The aroma was notably sweet, a mix of caramel malt, sweet malt, toasted malt, floral hops and some bitter herbal hops. The flavors were delicious. I tasted caramel malt, toffee, brown sugar and some notes of dark fruit balanced by bitter hops and citrus hops. In general I thought the balance was excellent and the sweetness concealed the high alcohol percentage very well. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body full and the carbonation on-point for the style. A great American barleywine and well worth tracking down its big feet.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,TheycallmeTim,2.42,"2009 vintage poured from a 12 oz. bottle into an Ommegang chalice.  A--Pours up an auburn-like reddish brown with a thin fingernail of creme colored head that dies quickly to skim. Nice spidwereb, though, on the surface that does lace a bit.  S--Umm, like an IPA? Orange, grapefruit, and pine. Maybe some candied cherries wafting up from the malt but the sweeter notes that should be rising and making for a fruit cocktail in my nostrils just aren't there. This may just be too young.  T--Umm, again--like an IPA with too much malt in it? Sorry to be repetitive,, but this is kinda boring. It's just hops, hops, hops, tons of bitter resinous pine and citrus in the beginning, middle, and end of the flavor profile. Some malt does sneak into the middle in the form of cognac-soaked raisins, which is nice, but why should the malt have to go creepin? This is a barleywine, fer Chrissakes. Just an overload of hops IMO, without anything earthy, medicinal, or a variety of dark fruits to open up on the palate. Instead you gotta dig for complexity, and not much turns up, at least fresh.  M&D--Sierra Nevada never disappoints me on the mouthfeel, and this one is no exception, as it's pure creamy heaven. The drinkability in my eyes is terrible, however, as this to me tastes like liquid heartburn.  Hopheads rejoice! Anyone who thinks MORE MORE MORE doesn't equal better better better, well....you might want to lay off this one. Or lay it down for a year or two. Lemme know how it goes, as I won't be buying any more of this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,smanders,4.23,"Appearance - Beautiful redhead color with a thick head. Chunky lacing.  Smell - The familiar smell of hops with a note of toffee/caramel/prune sweetness.  Taste - The sweetness of the malt blends well with the crispness of the hops. Oh, then there's the warming of the high alcohol content. That's gonna stay around for awhile!  Mouthfeel - Thick and oily.  Drinkability - A definite sipper. Excellent barleywine example that will also satisfy hopheads. Not too many ales you can say that about.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

A- Bigfoot has a deep dark amber with a mixture of orange and red spots in places. A semi aggressive pour yields one inch of off white foam that sticks to the glass. Slow rising bubbles lead me to believe this is thick.  S- A nice aroma coming from this as i'm getting a nice hop punch up front resembling piney scents, some citrus as well. Malts giving off some caramel. A bit of honey.  T- A big focus on the hops in this b-wine, perhaps the most hopped in this style that i've had to date. They give off a rather bitter appeal. Backed by some malts that drown out the hops although they never fully leave. A bit of caramel/toffee. some alcohol as well.  M- Medium to semi full bodied with a very slick feel as it glides down the tounge. A nice bitterness to start but smooths out. A bit of alcohol here as well.  D- A slow sipper for sure, i took about two hours with 12oz. A bit of hotness and the thick appeal makes for small sips. Only one bottle a night for me.

Leaves a little sticky lacing but not much.  Nose is mainly dark fruits and brown sugar, a little tiny bit of alcohol but hardly noticeable. The brown sugar is what sticks out most.  Up front is deep dark sugars and a medium brown sugar sweetness followed by some hop bite as it goes down. My opinion is that the hops are slightly too strong but that was as expected for this one.

Happily hoppy, overly hoppy, I love American Barleywines, take a good thing, and overhop the heck out of it to make it great.

140,2671,Jwale73,4.03,"2009 vintage served in my new New Belgium goblet courtesy of Mauerhan. Poured a translucent, but slightly hazy, mahogany with a dense, half inch, off-white head; bands of lacing were revealed as it slowly receded. The glass must have a nucleation point etched in it, because a spiral of tiny bubbles gently swirled up to the underside of the cap. Potent nose - could smell it from eight inches away. Aromas suggest hops, dark fruit and maybe some toffee or caramel in the mix. Hops hits you right in the face on the first sip before revealing the characteristics implied by the nose and then finishing with a lingering, medicinal bitterness between quaffs. Mouthfeel was slightly more than medium-bodied, with a mild viscosity and a subtle, but consistent background effervescence that adds a liveliness to the brew. Also detected a little alcohol heat, but it wasn't clearly revealed in the flavor profile. Wasn't sure how I was going to feel about this brew.

Mouthfeel - Feels slightly too carbonated for my tastes, but excellent nonetheless. Leaves a nice warm alcoholic finish.  Drinkability - Good for a 9.6abv barleywine! I don't think I could take more than a couple of bottles due to the very hoppy aftertaste.  Overall this is a great barleywine, and very reasonable for a 6-pack. I tasted the 2009 edition. It's definitely more hoppiness than I'm used to in my barleywines though, as well as more carbonation.

Pours a slightly cloudy reddish brown with a gorgeous light tan head with amazing, photographic-quality lacing along the sides of my cab glass.  Smells are big hops and malts all over the place...  There's an immediate bitterness on the tongue when you drink this, due to the hops. In fact, the hops dominate on this one. Granted it's young and hot for it being a 2009, but wow - this is a big beer for SN. Medium bodied with medium to full flavor profile. If blind-folded, I would guess this is an American Double IPA all day long. Floral and grassy hops all day long... Good bittering and dryness, as well. Very drinkable.  Slight waxiness or dry sensation on the finish, likely due to the hops.  Very nice, BIG beer from Sierra Nevada!

140,2671,optiontwo,4.3,"12oz. bottle poured into tulip Appearance: Clear dark orange with ruby hues and a beautiful frothy two inch cream colored head, great retention, and tremendous lacing.  Smell: Lots and lots of juicy hops. Very citrus like but with a sweet berry and caramel background. This is such a great complex aroma, spicy and sweet at the same time. Spicy in the sense that it's very herbal and earthy and the sweetness comes from all the wonderful malt in there.  Taste: The first thing I taste is a sweet dark cherry with caramel notes, THEN the citrus hops come through, which is kind of nice that you're not hit over the head with them right away. After that some herbal comes through, pine and grass, and finally finishes off with a full amount of bitter and some slight alcohol heat. Delicious.  Mouthfeel: Coats the tongue and the throat on the way down but somehow remains at a good point with its viscosity. A delight to sip.  Drinkability: High alcohol and a medium to heavy body makes this not the most drinkable brew but I honestly could have more than I should in a row.  Overall: I love barleywines, and this is one of my favorites. It's got everything a barleywine should have and then some.

The aroma is teeming with fresh grapefruit and pine. It pretty much masks the malt tones. It smells great, though. It is full bodied and very smooth. It is slick, with a clean finish. The balance is just right. It is quite bitter with flavors of Juicy grapefruit and resiny pine. It really masks the alcohol. It is slightly sweet, but there's no need to age this. It's excellent the way it is.  2007 bottle. This beer is a slightly hazy ruby with a small off-white frothy head. The aroma is of grapefruit and flowers and sweet malt. In the mouth, it's thick and oily, soft and fluffy, and leaves the tounge slightly chalky. The flavor is very bitter grapefruit peel with the warm rumble of alcohol and medicine. The taste of curacao lingers. This doesn't seem as sweet as some previous years have been and I like that.

140,2671,Vengeance526,4.48,"2009  Pours a dark copperish amber color with a half finger tan head that stays pretty consistent throughout and leaves a good deal of lacing.  Aroma is piney and citrusy, with lots of hops present upfront. Very inviting.  Hops abound in the taste. Some raisin is present along with notes of pine and grapferuit. Alcohol is present but not as powerful as you would expect.  Has a very warming, sticky mouthfeel. At 9.6% I typically wouldn't want more than one of these at a sitting but this was surprisingly very drinkable. I seem to have gotten so lost in the taste to even notice the alcohol so I definitely felt like I was ready for another afterwards. Always worth grabbing a few of these every year and I'll be interested to see how this one has aged by next year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,TheDoorman,4.2,"Pours a very dark amber with an slightly tanned head. Aroma is prominently earthy hops, complimented by brown sugar and caramel. Front of the palate is molasses and dark candy sugar sweetness. Alcohol asserts itself as well, it an inviting, warming manner. Floral hops reemerge in the finish, with a lingering bitterness. A nicely subdued degree of carbonation A stickey, resiny residual mouthfeel. A barleywine, of course, is intended to be filled with alcohol, and its presence is well known here, but not overwhelmingly. A nice balance of dark sweet malt, hops and alcohol. Maybe a touch too much on the hops ""for the style"" whatever that means. But for a hop-head like myself, this hits the spot. Perhaps this beer should be called a Barleywine Style IPA. Very nice.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,StarlightSeraph,3.61,"2009 Vintage, poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter.  Appearance: Pours a beautiful ruby-mahogany, which was surprisingly clear. The color of this beer is absolutely phenomenal, and looks almost like a deep red wine. Poured with a finger-and-a-half of off-white head that dissipated reasonably quickly, but left a blanket of lacing.  Smell: Grassy hops, tempered by a sweet malt background. Can almost detect some cinnamon and nutmeg spices.  Taste: The hop bite of an IPA was the first thing I got, intermixed with the alcohol (definitely noticeable!). Left a nice warming sensation as it went down. Hints of malt sweetness in the background, but the hops were the dominant flavor. As the beer warms, more sweet, nutty flavors in the malt comes out, and some honey notes. However, I'm not getting all the complexity I was expecting - I might try this again with some age on it, to see how it is.  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated, and thick in the mouth. Helps support the big flavors in this beer.  Drinkability: Felt more like an IPA than a barleywine...I might have to try this again with some age on it. Fresh, however, it tastes like most of SN's other offerings, with just a little sweetness in the background. Not bad, but not what I was expecting for a barleywine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,schoolboy,4.15,"I am not sure when the last time was that I had any of this that wasn't a year old. I've been aging this stuff a year before drinking for several batches, and the result always seems to be a smoother barley wine than I remember the unaged stuff being.  As I recall, the un-aged stuff was much nastier and ruder. That is to say, it still is nasty and rude after a year, just much less so. My question (that may remain unanswered for a while unless I stick one away a little further).  The appearance of this was not the flat, boring barley wine you might expect. It is a pretty reddish color and has a decent head.  For a smooth, pre-aged experience, I think the Old Brooklyn has a less wild taste - not necessarily as true to the style, but more drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,MADhombrewer,3.91,"I poured this from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. (Don't have a snifter, yet)  A- Dark cooper in color. Small head, good retention.  S- Distinct, but smooth hop note. Little bit of nuttiness.  T- The alcohol taste overpowers almost anything else. I can taste some nutty flavors, but mainly just the alcohol. As the beer worms, however, it does get sweeter and the alcohol taste mellows a bit.  M- Medium mouth feel. Nothing great about it.  D- I could not have two or three in a row. One would be good if that is all you are going to have for the night.  I have not had very many experience with Barleywines. I am not real big on heavy alcohol tasting beers. This is one that I may stay away from, at least until the one I have in the cellar is a little older or my tastes changes to where I have ""grown"" to like the style. I will continue to try them, though.  Edit 3-23-11 2011 vintage. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a New Belgium balloon glass.  Appearance- Dark caramel color with a nice off white head.  Smell- Lots of caramel malt and hops. Some bread as well.  Taste- Alcohol right up front. Lots of piney and citrus hops. My taste buds are at attention. The malts are the main flavor after that. They give the beer good body and something to ""chew"" on.  Mouthfeel- The mouthfeel is right on for the style in my opinion. It is not very thick. More to the middle of the spectrum.  Overall- Good beer. I have to buy more of this when it comes out next time. This is the first time I have had it. Now I know why everyone drolls over it.

Smells of dark chocolate caramel cherries and noticeable straight alcohol lacing.  Wonderful body as this beer enters the chew zone. And yes it's chewy... in a good way. Lot's of roasty characters enter in. Chocolate, raisins, caramel and raspberries. A lot of spicy hop friends here along with the big grain bill makes this beer an oversized artists' palate of flavors. It's hard to get to them all.  I wasn't overly impressed with the way this beer sits in the mouth. It's rather heavy but not fun. Kind of like Rosie O' Donnel. I was expecting a little more here.

It has a great deep amber red color with good clarity and nice head. The head leaves great lacing behind.  Aroma is sweet, fruity, and very hoppy - all good things.  Flavor is similar in the sweet and fruity way. Lots of hop bitterness and all very well balanced. Roasted and carmel flavors meld in there as well.  Mouthfeel is smooth, big bodied, and lightly carbonated. Drinkable, yes, but limited with such high alcohol.  A nice American barleywine but maybe not my favorite.

Served at ~50-60F 10-15C  A- Still, garnet-colored body with a big, sticky, tan-colored head  S- Loads of American hops common to Sierra Nevada brews. Aromas of grapefruit, pine, and sweet-roll. Even at higher temperatures, this beer's alcohol character is shy  T- There is too much taste here I don't mean that in a good way. However, the mad amounts of flavor are complimented by the smell and it does manage to cover the alcohol taste. Overall, the sweetness is cloying and the bitterness from the hops is over-aggressive, but the ethanol is nowhere to be found. Congratulations to Sierra Nevada for creating a beer that I can both love and hate at the same time. As it ages, the flavors begin to erode, but become more cohesive with each other.  M- This beer feels sorta like juice in the mouth. I like juice. Low carbonation and slick texture  D- The ""alcohol character is shy"" and ""the ethanol is nowhere to be found"". Imagine this as 2 beers in 1 and you will understand how amazing this brew truly is.  I drank this bottle as an appetizer before my dinner. Did I mention that this beer is a beast?

S - Huge grass smell, citrusy and fruity. Pine and grapefruit come to mind. Smells like a well-balanced DIPA rather than a barleywine. Not a bad thing though, very inviting.  M - Somewhat creamy mouthfeel, carbonated, but not overly carbonated.  T - Tons of grapefruit upfront and a hint of lemon. Hops are dominant, but not as huge as a DIPA as I said earlier. The finish gives way to a malty sweetness that barely pulls through all of the hop flavor.  D - Delicious, but then again I'm a hophead. I've done a vertical tasting of Bigfoot, and five years was a real sweetspot for this beer. It's much sweeter and balanced as the hops die off.

Tastes sweet with the flavors fighting each other followed by noticeable alcohol, a negative in my book. There is a lot going on here and I think this needs time to meld. The other five bottles of the six pack will be heading to the basement for an extended stay. I think when I rereview this next year the ratings will improve, possibly substantially.

140,2671,bgjohnston,4.1,"Having enjoyed this beer for a while now, I felt like it was time for an update. Only in this way could I capture what a pleasure this beer has been on a consistent basis from year to year.  Pours a clear dark amber with a generous head of tan foam and sticky lacing on the glass. Smell was actually somewhat dank, like a deep pine forest, and you might be expecting a double IPA in the glass as a result.  Taste informs you that there is a very solid malt body holding up the hops. Hoppier than a barleywine should be, even a fresh one like this (1 month past bottling), it is still very enjoyable. I think I like it because of, rather than despite its deviation from what I would consider a standard barleywine. If it were more balanced, people would probably never be able to age it, and I suspect the love people have for cellared Bigfoot is because this can help the beer achieve more balance than it has fresh.  Have no doubt, this is a strong beer with a heavy mouth feel and this should slow you down, if the ABV does not. Still, the world is a better place with Bigfoot in it.  2009: This beer was a fresh 2009 release. I had been looking forward to trying this one, so I poured it into my favorite snifter. It poured a dark caramel color, with foamy head that quickly settled into a sticky lacing.  Smell was inviting: hoppy and malty, just a hint of the alcohol behind it. First sip was an explosion. Nice big flavor; sweet, malty, grapefruit flavor going to a nice hoppy bite. Sharp, clean finish. The contrast balanced well and played with each other very nicely together on the palate. Went down very easily for a nearly 10% ABV beer.  I had wondered whether this beer was overhyped on this site, and to be honest, even hesitated to buy a $12 sixpack of it in part for this reason. Happily, no regrets.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Smell is ridiculous with hops and of citrus. Taste is very piney and overwhelming with different type of hops that just attack your mouth. A very dry aftertaste and the alcohol quickly follows.

140,2671,snaotheus,4.08,"2009 Sierra Nevada Bigfoot  I think it's even hoppier than last year -- extremely hoppy for a barleywine. Hoppier than their Pale Ale. Strong astringent alcohol -- oddly, the sweetness is more in the background for this barleywine. Slight floral tones.  It's a dark, syrupy amber color with a decent head and strong lacing. Smells piney.  Feels thinner in the mouth than it looks when it pours. Drinkable for a barleywine. Very nice!  ---  17 April 2009 Update: I am now drinking a 2003 Bigfoot side-by-side with a 2009 -- I'm not going to update the scores I gave it, I'm just going to contrast them.  The 2003 is noticeably cloudier and slightly less carbonated. It has a much smokier, caramel-laced smell than its younger counterpart.  2003 is much sweeter, maltier, and way way less hoppy. Strong molasses taste to this beer, and a little astringence.  2003 mouthfeel is chalky, almost gritty -- I don't think I disturbed any sediment, but I may have (I know I've never seen sediment in the 2008s and 2009s I've head).  Overall, I'd prefer the hoppy crispness of the 2009 over the 2003, but they're both solid.  --- 2014 (packaged date 12-10-2013) enjoyed 19 Feb 2014  Hoppy, nice, honey sweetness.

It looked like someone pained rings around the glass. That's some seriously sticky lacing. The aroma of this beer is crazy hops. Wow. Lots of citrus overwhelms the olfactory senses but beneath that frontal assault of hops is a really mellow sweetness coming from what has to be an absolute ton of malt since it was able to sneak out from under the hops. The taste is equally great. Huge hops muddled with a big malty backbone. This is what I've always thought a barleywine should taste like or at least I always wanted it to taste like.

Smell: Grapefruit dominates the aroma. Judging by the aroma I would think that this beer would be a particularly malty and strong Imperial IPA.  Taste: The taste is pretty much nothing but hops.

Smells of sweet caramel malts with hints of piney hops and very faint citrus hops. It almost has a vanilla aroma, like a more powerful version of Dale's Pale.  Tastes similar to how it smells. Smooth sweet malts kick things off and are joined by mild pine flavors. Citrus flavors join in right before a solid bitterness ends the sip. The alcohol is faintly noticeable as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel is very good. It's got a great thickness with grainy carbonation that makes this one glide straight on down.  Drinkability is too good for a beer with this high of an ABV.

Brace yourself if you've never had one of these. You will get hit with roasted carmel malt flavors just before all the hop bitterness and alcoholic spiciness take over. Just very complex and very strong. This makes the mouthfeel and drinkability suffer. THe high amount of alcohol is apparent and one too many of these would be easy to do.

Dried leaves, banana leaves, dark brown sugar, palm sugar, golden raisins, new leather. Earthy and sweet smelling.  Palate: Prickly, sweet and bitter all up front. Medium bodied with lots of texture. Lots of bitterness all the way through sweeps up the initial sweetness of the malt. It goes back and forth between this deep malty raisin-y character and bright, dusty hop flowers. It's almost resin-y and dusty at the same time.  Notes: Lots of ageing potential. The hops will fall away (with some luck!) and that will balance the beer out between bitter and sweet over the next year or two. After that, I suspect the malt will play more of a role. This beer might live for 10 years or so given proper cellaring.

Floral and citrus hop-filled notes come to the front immediately and dominate the aroma. Upon further inspection, I can pick up some malt tones. There is also an underlying sweetness present that begs of caramel.  The first thing I notice is the citrus taste, reminiscent of grapefruit or sour oranges. The hops also provide a piney and slightly sticky taste. You can tell the malt is there also, but it is tough to pick out as the hops are some dominant.

Aroma is of caramel, toffee, and brandied fruit. Very little hop aroma save a hint of pie spice. Apricot brandy and whiskey-ish notes at it warms.  Burnt caramel of the malt in the taste is immediately tempered by a solid grapefruit pith and piney resin bitterness. Toffee sweetness persists well into the finish, with coffee bitterness, grapefruit, and alcohol drying it out in the end.  Mouthfeel is juicy and sticky at the same time, with a lingering hotness on the tongue. Surprisingly sharp after 2 years in the cellar. I was expecting something a bit rounder. Carbonation is light, but the bitterness keeps it bright and clean.  Drinkability is good; ultimately balanced, although the hops and alcohol challenge the palate. More like a DIPA than a barleywine even after aging, which is not necessarily bad.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,bigeyedfish,4.25,"2008 12 ounce bottle purchased at the Foodery for [if memory serves correctly] an exorbitant price, poured into a Bulldog pint-glass-night pint glass.  Two fingers of dirty white head recedes slowly but consistently until there is a lather-like coating on-top of the beer with a finger-and-a-half of lacing coating the sides with some small bubbles throughout, but for the most part, the lacing is consistent. The beer is light-burnt-red in color and, surprisingly for the color, resistant to light penetration.  This is one of the hoppier barleywines, even after a year, but it's a really subtle, pleasing hopping. Fresh it's almost offensively hoppy, now the hopps are deep, the smell sweet pine and not overpowering at all.  Tastes really good initially; the hops that are on the nose are there in the palate, but at the same time is a hint of an almost-bittersweet chocolate. The finish is strong, the most powerful part. There's some strong, west coast, dry, piney hops on the finish. The beginning is, at least in comparison to the finish, disappointing; it's a more physical sensation than a taste one. There isn't a lot of the syrup-y ness of most barleywines; this is a lot closer to an IPA than most other barleywines.  The mouthfeel is, like the taste and smell, deep and refined. There is some tingling beginning in the mid-palate; this quickly fades away, leaving a strong coating of pine-y hops on the top of the palate once the sip is finished. The beers IPA-like qualities, previously alluded to, lend it to having a decided lack of palate coating, making it rather a beer with some noticeable carbonation (specifically on the mid-palate) and a long-lingering tinge of bitterness.  This beer, despite its high-alcohol, is remarkably drinkable. Unlike any other Barleywine, it drinks, at least after one year of mellowing, like a strong IPA, with the bitter hoppiness being reserved for the later parts of the palate (a good opposite representation is presented in Brooklyn's East India IPA, if memory serves correctly). Seems to be surprisingly all-seasonable- drinking this in front of a woodstove monitored with too much vigilance has left me with a distinct annoyance with the heat, and this beer is borderline thirst-quenching, probably the last thing any barleywine ever could say it was. Where this beer goes from here is anyone's guess; but I for one look forward to seeing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

I think this is one of the best beers I have ever tasted. From the initial pour the hops are overpowering and the taste is full bodied and amazing. It literally made my mouth water thinking about the next sip.  I hadn't has a Bigfoot for several years, but this brew is amazing. I don't have any way to compare it to previous vintages, but I am now hooked and will be buying it every spring.  While it is high in ABV it is amazingly drinkable and after 2 in a row I could definitely feel it.

A nice hop presence in the nose, but not as strong as most SN brews. A solid malt foundation supports those hops. Body is slightly thin for a barleywine, with the hops having the usual SN boldness. This is very drinkable for the style, but should a Barleywine be an easy beer to drink? I think Barleywines should be maltier, not as hoppy, and not smoothly drinkable. I also think SN overhops all the beers they make. That said, I like this beer a lot, maybe it belongs in a different category?",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Pours a clear deep copper color with a fluffy off white head that laces most of the glass on the way down. Smells of grapefruit pine and resin. If I squint and close my eyes I smell a tiny bit of caramel malt deep in the background. Taste initially hits with the hops, grapefruit and pine eat my palette. There is a malt backbone here that caramels its way through some of the hops before being beaten down by the bitterness. Resinous aftertaste begs for another sip. Alcohol is very well hidden. Body is thick, mouthfeel is syrupy and resinous, carbonation is low but ample. This is one of my favorite beers. Barleywine or DIPA who knows.

140,2671,Thesoundandthefury,3.8,"A- This barleywine pours a nice dark orangeish red. 2 Fingers of head quickly calm down to about a half a finger which leave some lacing as I drank the beer.  S- Hoppy floral notes with some citrus and alcohol come through in the nose.  T- First thing I notice about this barleywine is the upfront hoppiness and bitterness. A faint bit of floral, bitterness, and dried fruits come though. It's a taste that vaguely reminds me of a sweeter blended scotch. Some alcohol also comes through, which is expected from such a young barleywine.The finish is hoppy and bitter which lingers for minutes.  M- Great carbonation with tiny little bubbles that aren't overly excited. A slightly thin and ever so light coating feeling are present, which I feel comes from the hoppy bitterness which hangs around for minutes after a sip.  D- Easy to drink 2 or 3 of these, but watch out as the alcohol content is quite strong.

140,2671,Augustiner719,4.49,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter.  Appearance: This is the first barleywine i have had so given that I cannot accurately judge its appearance based on the style but only in my own opinions as a beer itself. Poured a nice reddish brown color. Very dark, translucent still, but dark with brown and red hues comming through.Nice 1 finger thick beige head with nice lacing.  Smell: This beer smells very strong on the hops. Its got the same characteristics as many double ipas ive had before on the nose. Sweet, sticky, piney, citrusy, malty, and delicious.  Taste: For 9.60% abv this beer has the depth and quality to hold it very well. The bite is evident, but hidden extremely well. Its got a tremendous dose of hops that is toned down by rich malty flavors. Its like a huge hop bomb without the hop bite or sting. Certainly unique in my experiences.  Mouthfeel: On the shorter side of the carbonated beers, but true to its style i would assume. Its coats the palate well and leaves a nice after taste.  Drinkability: Funny thing about this beer is that I want a lot more of it. The high abv makes you wonder how many you could drink, but its a great great beer. Being slightly intimidated by this style I went in with a closed mind that it was going to be boozy and needed to age in order to lose the bite. I was wrong. Its so drinkable and the hops taste fresher than ever. I can see where cellaring would help dissapate the hops and the alcohol bite.

140,2671,HopEnthusiast,4.35,"Incredible brew. Buy a case every year. This one looks great, huge fluffy off-white head. Dark brown in color. It's not your typical English Style barley wine though, much rougher in nature, much more emphasis on hops rather than malt and yeast. Massive dry hop aroma and a small amount of flowery hop notes. The taste is also heavy in hop bitterness, it does boast a good amount of rich sweet maltiness. Raw, brutal and so damn satisfying.

A- Pours a clear garnett color with a huge light tan head the hangs around for ever finally ending in a one finger head that stays for the entire beer. Leaves great lacing. It's just a very pretty beer.  S- First thing is the citrusy floral hops. It has suttle fruity sugary notes. You can smell the barley malts really well. It's very complex and I'm sure I'm leaving some smells out.  T- Nice bitterness that mixes with a burnt sugar taste that sticks to your lips. It finishes with a malty kind of fruity taste. It all blends well with the hop sticky bitterness causing all the flavors to stick around for a long time. Just like the smell it's very complex and hard to point everything out.  M- It tingles when it hits your lips from all the alcohol. It's crisp from all the hop bitterness which causes it to be fairly thick and extremely sticky. If held in your mouth it almost feels like a shot of liquor in you mouth, but it isn't unpleasant like you would think.  D- It is an easy drinking beer but would probably make you loose your mind if you drink too many of them.

T - Up front this ale had a slightly sweet malty taste that quickly gets overpowered (not in a bad way) of the bitter flavor of grapefruit and some pine needles. Finshes off slightly dry with a bit of bitter hop bite.  MF&D - Oily, sticky and wonderful to drink (sip). Medium bodied, but with a thick, slightly creamy mouthfeel.

The carbonation is minimal as it should be with this style beer. It has a slightly sweet smell when first poured.  The beer almost sticks to your mouth. It is not as heavy as it is thick and syrupy. Not overwhelmingly malty or hoppy but well balanced with both. The aftertaste is just slightly bitter. This is a beer that stays with you.

140,2671,rgore,4,"2009 Vintage. (I'm drinking this a good bit too early, but I plan on saving several of the bottles and keeping them for 6 months to a year to see how it ages)  A - Its a great looking beer. Clear and a dark mahogany color. Pours with about an inch of head that dissipates down to just a thin layer. Nice lacing all the way down.  S - Earthy, citrus hops dominate the nose. Sharp pine scent, a subtle orange. The pine hop scent is so strong I can even see describing it as mistletoe.  T - It starts out just as it smells with the pine hops dominating the flavor, this flavor is really pine bitterness strong. It does slowly mellow though as the alcohol comes in and the malts start to balance it out with a little bit of a peppery sweetness. Its a really nice tasting beer even at this very young stage. I'm looking forward to seeing how it changes with a few months to blend and mellow.  M - You pucker some due to the bitterness of the hops but the alcohol and malts really don't let that last too long. Ultimately you are left with a nice almost earthy flavor that lingers.  D - At 9.6 percent I wouldn't/cannot imagine a session with these. But even more than that this is a beer that I think is best enjoyed slowly. Appreciating the balance between the hops and malt which really does a great job of eventually mellowing the hops out. There is a decent amount going on here, take your time with it.  This is the first time I have had Bigfoot after hearing about it for a while (no good excuse on why it took me this long) for the price (8.99 for a sixer) and the flavor its an excellent deal and another great beer from sierra.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,rhinos00,3.9,"2008 Vintage  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter.  A- Pours a semi-clear, crystal amber. Reveals a healthy two fingers width of off-white head.  S- Classic barleywine. Distinct aromas of burnt sugars and sweet fruits run rampant throughout. Smells like a floral bouquet hopped up on sugar and fruits.  T- Initially, there are complex layers of sweetness from sugars, malts and fruits. However, even after a year, this is short lived. Midway through the taste, a strong hops presence crushes all taste, and leaves the tongue with a bitter burn.  M- The consistency was there. It was sticky, and gooey with sugar goodness sticking to the lips and tongue as it was consumed. Was hoping for it to be a little chewier, but still pretty thick.  D- The bitter hops burn really hurts this one. Each sip started off as a glorious barleywine, that then turned south midway through.  Overall, one day this will be a fantastic barleywine. Even after letting this one sit for a year, the hop oils still have not been infused with the rest of the ingredients in this brew. Given at least another year, this will be a malty, sugary and sweet barleywine that should be reckoned with. Bottom line, after one year, this one is still hot with plenty of hops to go around.

140,2671,Jekster,4.69,"2008 Variety  Appearance: This beer pours a deep dark cherry read that fades to a dark garnet pink red on the edge of the glass. There is a slight one finger light caramel head that maintains persistence while drinking the brew.  Smell: The smell is phenomenal. There is a deep sticky pine resin character along with a fresh cut grapefruit citrus character. There is a slight spicy character of rosemary or thyme along with dark caramel undertones. Tones of sweet bourbon hide as well in the background finding a nice balance with the forward hop character.  Taste: The first character on the pallet is definitely a strong hop citrus peer bitterness. This is quickly backed by an almost dark chocolate malt character along with a pleasant sweet red cherry flavor. The flavors literally hit you in waves providing a deep a complex character throughout the whole beer. There are tones of bread crust, burnt marshmallow and wildflower honey. There is a slight bitter aftertaste, but nothing astringent or unpleasant at all. The beer finishes with a nice warming feeling of alcohol although it was not detected in the least with the smell.  Mouthfeel: For as big as this beer taste it does not feel overly thick or syrupy. In fact it is actually a full bodied beer with a slight slickness and rather dry finish clean finish.  Drinkability: I would enjoy sipping a few of these throughout the evening. It is definitely not a beer to drink quickly, but rather one to enjoy with a nice cigar or a roaring fire.  OVERALL IMPRESSION: This is a wonderful sipper of a beer. It is amazingly complex while not being overbearing in any way. It has the perfect level of aroma, flavor, and alcohol to make it the perfect sippable beer for a cold evening. For the price point it is unmatched in my opinion by any barley wine I've had.

Sticky lacing left in notches.  A: Piney & citrusy hops, biscuity malts, caramel, and some earth.  T: Oh baby, the hophead in me is jumping for joy! It starts sweet from the malts, but the hops soon crush any incling of this being a malt bomb. The hop profile consists of brown sugar-crusted grapefruits, oranges, pine sap, and a touch of herbal spice. So fresh and juicy, it flirts with entering the DIPA territory. In fact, I've had DIPA's that can't match this. Sweet malts try in vain to hold their own, but it's clear who the star of this show is. There is also a caramel sweetness in there that plays off of the bitterness quite well. Alcohol is well-hidden for this big of an ABV.  M & D: Full-bodied, luxuriously smooth, and a bit chewy. Great drinkability for this big of a beer. Although, I'm not sure how many I could drink before I find myself on the kitchen floor!

It almost, for a brief second, seemed like this was going to be a big, smooth maltbomb. Then the hops came in. The brief kiss of caramel is annihilated by the bitterness of the hops.

Hoppy, caramelized sugars, and maple. A bit green, a touch herbal, and just a bit of spice.  taste is very hop forward with a definite earthy hopping that is unique and delicious.

140,2671,kaseydad,4.53,"Excited for this years Foot and the beer is awesome this year! Love the blue border! Keep it!  Nice foamy head on initial pour which has nice staying power.  Beautiful cherry red color! The wife said it reminded her of a sunset. Agreed! Also sort of reminded me of cough syrup but hey...it's amazing.  Sweet, syrupy taste with a nice foam inclusion on each sip. A little hoppy taste on the swallow which works very well.  Very easy drinking for a high alcohol beer. Would like to see what this tastes like in a year or four.  Excellent ""Foot"" this year!

140,2671,cdizinno,4.11,"A- Dark cherry red/brown.  S- Typical HOP smell and taste for Sierra  T- Again, if you like HOPS, you probably like Sierra. It's my fallback beer and this is a great variation on their standard Pale Ale. Sweeter than their standard with a bit more malty taste.  M- Good feel as the maltiness cuts down on the hoppy carbonation taste associated with their regular Pale Ale.  D - Nice to drink.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,jdklks,4.72,"I did a back to back tasting of the 2008 and 2009. they are very different and both very good.  2008: A- Murky, impenetrable copper-brown body with a frothy tan head that has great retention and leaves a thick lacing.  S- Hops. sweet maltiness. citrus fruits.  T- Malts and sweet fruits up front with a bitter hop finish. however, the malts reassert themselves and dominate the aftertaste.  M- It's definitely a full bodied barleywine. perfect amount of carbonation, and smooth throughout.  D- the drinkability is pretty ddamn good considering the fullness and the abv.  2009: A- Dark, see-through amber brown color with a small off-whitish tan head that minimally laces the glass.  S- Hops and malt.  T- Just like the smell, it's hops and malt. a great, balanced blend. more malt up front while the hops are pronounced in the finish. hardly any of the sweetness that dominated the initial flavor of the 2008. again, lots of hops, especially compared with previous years. has a less intense aftertaste as well.  M- not as carbonated as the 2008, which is surprising considering that the 2008 has a year on it. a little bit lighter body than the 2008 as well.  D- the drinkability of the 2009 is higher due to it being slightly less ""full.""  Overall, the 2008 is better RIGHT NOW than the 2009, if you didn't get that from the reviews. however, the 2009 definitely has promise for aging. they are both excellent.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Smells like a hoppy barleywine for sure. I'm also getting a great caramel smell. Slight clove too.  T- The hop taste is very clean and refreshing. There is an earthyness I've never had in any other barleywine. I'm getting lots of spices that I'm having trouble putting my finger on. Although the hop taste is clean and refreshing, it still has a bit of an edgy bite. I can see why people like this after it has aged a while. That edgyness will mellow and bring out the other flavors. Its a good think I have 5 more.  M- Good feel in the mouth, the carbination helps cut the thickness that is the BW.

140,2671,yeastsipper,4,"I know, I know, I know....let this on age. Just picked up a six pack of the 2009 and want to give this a try.  Beer pours a dark mahogany brown with a small head.  Smell upfront is very sweet. For me, there is a touch of sweet caramel and maybe some prunes. Dark, fermenting stone fruit. Initially, there is a slight piney smell, which becomes more pervasive as the beer warms.  The first sip is one of strong bitterness. There is a big hop presence, one not noted on the nose. Almost IPA-like. The aftertaste is an interesting combination of bitter and sweet. Hell, I will call it bittersweet. Interesting to me, but as the beer warms, the sweetness is noted more upfront and the bitterness at the end - a reversal of my first few sips. There is some complexity here, which my novice palate notes but can't decipher.  The mouthfeel is great and the beer is almost creamy going down. Remarkable.  I reserve the right to edit in the future. I am very new to the style and have little to compare this beer to. I like the big flavors and yes, I can see how this might mellow out over time.

140,2671,KeefD,4.17,"2009 Bottle  I've had this beer before but this is a new review. Pours a very lovely dark amber/red color with an inch-high head that falls quickly leaving behind very light lacing in the snifter. Big piney hop aroma backed up by some thick, dark caramel maltiness and light licorice. Flavor follows suit. Intense hop bitterness overpower the dark bready, caramel malts. Lots of dark rum soaked fruit with pine sap drizzled over top. This is one big beer. Alcohol can be detected throughout, from nose to throat, but it's all a part of this beer drinking experience. It's damn tasty, but I don't want more than one at a time. This is an excellent Barleywine, and probably the standard for American Barleywines. I will drink two of these and age the rest in hopes of one day doing a 10 year vertical.

Taste of sweeter hops and a little tartness after the initial hop character. Mouth feel is a little thick that as weird as it sounds, that goes away fairly fast off of the palate. A little malty, very little, in the after taste along with the hops. This beer is the definition of an American Barleywine in my opinion.

Smells strongly of piney hops and spicy hops, alcohol, sweet malt, floral hops, and a hint of resin. Fits the style of an American Barleywine. Mouth feel is really sharp and crisp, with an associated dryness and bitterness. There's an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong alcohol, strong spicy hops, strong piney hops, hint of floral hops, and a hint of resin. Overall, this years beer is letdown, while still quite tasty, it was not a good blend at all and the feel was too sharp and carbonated.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Soneast,3.83,"*EDIT* (1-29-09) Well I reviewed this a few days ago, but I think my tastes may have been a little off, because I'm drinking one right now and I gotta say this seems much more balanced then I initially believed and the more it warms the more sweetness and caramel flavors come through in the beer. I'm really diggin' this atm! Consequently I gots to bump the taste up a notch.  Pours just shy of mahogany in color with some definite copper tones. Has a huge, rocky, cream colored head that got away from me. Really good retention with a lot of pillowy suds left on the glass.  Aroma consists of a strong hop profile. Predominately pine aromas with a floral kick. Also a nice sweet toasted malt aroma hidden behind all the hoppiness.  Flavor is also heavy on the hop side with a lot of floral and piney character with a sort of spiciness in the background, and just a hint of sweet caramel right towards the end. Has a bitter finish and a bit of booze burn as well.  Heavy bodied, medium carbonation. A thick creamy beer that coats your mouth with a delicious slick of yumminess! I think this will really benefit with age though, as the hop profile really is a bit much in it's present state.

It has been sad living in San Diego County for over 30 years ,loving SNPA and Celebration but never trying this beer. Ok, well not really too sad. Thanks BA for the knowledge.  Pinkie sized light tan head sat upon a clear amber color with ruby highlights. Lacing at the beginning, giving way to some sheeting,but still a ring of frothy goodness to the end. The expected west coast hop influence is floral in the nose. Along with the presence of caramel malt goodness. The same profile hits the palate. First the expected West Coast bitternes, but followed quickly with a balancing caramel malt footprint. Alcohol tries to poke through. Very drinkable now, smooth, sweet but not syrupy. Bitter finish. Just another solid Sierra Nevada value. I have never had an older Bigfoot but plan on putting a few down for sure.

Some off flavors do sort of hang out after it goes down, but really they are great flavors, and it will surely change over time.  D- Excellent.

The foam is fairly resilient, only dying down after a couple of minutes and leaving a light coating and some brilliant lacing. Smells more akin to an IPA than a barleywine; floral cascade hops dominate, giving it that signature SN bouquet. As it warms, sweet malt with hints of molasses and raisins peaks through. Sharply hoppy upon first tasting, with quite a bit of grapefruit coming through. Sweet, boozy malt is faintly evident after the palate gets acclimatized. Bitter, warming finish. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, though verging on syrupy. Not terribly drinkable, at least for me; the hops are overpowering and the alcohol is pretty noticeable. With a couple of years on it to dull the hops and tone down the alcohol, this could be great.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Jablonski,4,"2009 bottle  I picked up an individual bottle today and decided to try it before purchasing an entire six pack. It poured an amber color with a large head and decent lacing. The smell of piney hops hit me real quick, but I could later detect some spices and malts. Quite a complex smell, but unbalanced toward the hops. Despite the aroma, I was still a bit surprised on my first sip. It seemed to taste more like an IPA rather than a barleywine as the beer was more bitter than Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (not that it's a bad thing). Once my palate was used to the hops shock, I was able to taste much more of the beer. The beer is initially chocolaty and malty and the hops slowly take over the taste. There is a warming feeling as you drink this beer that gives me the sense that I'm drinking whiskey. However, I cannot taste any alcohol in the taste. The beer is carbonated nicely and appears to be near the perfect thickness. This beer is also very drinkable, but I prefer to have no more than one at a time. It just seems you are missing out on the beer if you follow up with multiples. Overall a decent barleywine, and I'm glad I got my hands on this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

M - i tend to like my barleywines on the undercarbonated side, so I took 0.5 off for what i perceived as over carbonation in this beer. it would be normal carbonation in any other beer, but in a barleywine, i didn't quite enjoy it.

140,2671,mdcrouser,4.13,"Welcome to HopFest - your host, Sierra Nevada. Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale 2008.  Originally enjoyed 03/21/08, updated 02/05/09 with a cellared bottle. This beer is captured within a brilliant red-brown cylinder, topped by a lasting creamy white head. With lacing around the edges of the glass, this is an attractive beer.  It quickly unveils a fully uplifting blast of fat, chewy hops that rolls smoothly over the tongue like a velvet carpet unfurling across a room. Holding it on the tongue is like slow-smoking a marshmallow, allowing it to melt in your mouth. Once it moves to the back of the throat, a mild fruitiness takes over, pushing against the inside of your mouth, big enough that it's seemingly searching for a way out. That escape comes upon first exhale and return inhale.  Impressively good. Cellaring one for a later enjoyment.  In the past year, it has mellowed, with the fruitiness completely mellowed, becoming even more velvety smooth. Stewing in its own juices has done good things for this beer. Not sure that I like it any better than last year, but it's at least as good.  03/21/12 2012 version, with a six pack purchased to enjoy one per year over the next five years. This is my only one of 2012.  Big head upon the pour, settling down only after a few minutes. That's a long wait to finish pouring. Once complete, the head is sturdy and tan, leaving thick rings, with a glowing orange/red beer beneath.  Fresh with hops and a malty backbone - the nose is big, but still seems very ""new.""  While smooth, creamy and incredibly enjoyable, there is a sharpness coming from the hops that comes through spicy and very forward. It then closes sticky and a bit smokey.  Really enjoyable and I'm looking forward to learning how it develops in the coming years.  02/22/13 2012 version, pulled from the fridge the day after the biggest snowstorm to hit KC in our lifetime dumped 12"" on us, I'm worn from shoveling and this sounded like as good of a cure as any.  The head holds fast at about an inch, capping that beautiful glow.  The nose seems to have mellowed a bit - less pungent, but still every bit as big.  The spiciness noted last year leveled out some too, more smoothly ascending into the mildly spicy hops and smoked maltiness.  Such a lovely drinker - warming, fulfilling, bridging the gap between winter and spring.  12/4/2014 Dreary night, time for a big beer. The third of six 2012's.  Sitting two feet from my nose, this beer is an explosion.  There seems to be a layer of tobacco that has introduced itself here, providing a smokey, vegetative maltiness that really rounds out as it comes to temperature.  Great for spring, great for winter a year later. I'm really looking forward to next year.  04/17/15 I'm a little stuffy, but the nose is no longer explosive, seeming to have extinguished in the past year.  The tobacco and vegetation rolls on the tongue, spritely and echoing in the mouth.  Mellow, lingering and still booming. I still love this beer, but it seems like after three years of sitting in the dark of the beer fridge, it's losing its spicy breadth.  04/04/2017 Cold and dreary day in the rain. Have spent two months pounding pavement to earn what finally came today. This is a celebration beer. A commemoration beer. A future motivation beer.  The sixth of the 2012 sixer - crazy to think I bought this when our now six-year old was but 18 months. And our four-year and almost 10 month old weren't even a thought.  The nose is gone - hardly a whiff of the previous romance. The explosive hoppiness has further mellowed as well, reverting to little more than a rolling smokiness. Pleasant, mildly spicy, some phenols that weren't apparent in past years - banana, clove. Nothing bad, but past its prime by at least two years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ncstateplaya,3.77,"This review is for a 2007 bottle, I decided to let a couple rest for a year, unfortunately one of the bottles went bad.  Appearance: Deep amber with a nice finger thick, creamy colored, sudsy head. The head quickly dissipates into a foam sheen (too thin to be a sheet) across the surface. Tons of extremely fine particulates in suspension.  Smell: The smell seemed dark and dangerous. There is a sudden rush of alcohol and esters. I would say malts were the second most abundant...actually pretty sweet smelling. And there was a subtle aroma of hops...just enough to let you know they were there. There was a faint smell of raisins.  Taste: This beverage is truely rich and loaded with toffee like flavors and dark brown sugars. It was a little more bitter than I had expected based my perception of the hoppy aroma. I thought the finish was caramel like and that the alcohol was very well hidden.  Mouthfeel: It was very smooth with just enough carbonation to notice. I would say a medium bodied drink with an almost mouth turning bitter finish, however it left my cheeks and the roof of my mouth feeling oily.  Drinkability: As barleywines go, I was a virgin and didn't know what to expect. I can see this as a sipper on a cool fall evening, but its not exactly what I look for in a brew.

140,2671,LilBeerDoctor,4,"Reviewed on 2/21/08. 2008 bottle. Pours dark red with a very small head. Lots of hops in the initial taste, but then the malt takes over in the finish, leaving a sweet taste in your mouth. Very good, very drinkable even for a 9.6%.  Update 5/28/08: 2006 edition found randomly at CBM! I'm not sure how well this bottle was stored because it may have shown some signs of oxidation. Aroma of dark fruits and raisin. Initial flavor of alcohol, dark fruits, and a bitter finish. The hops and malt don't mesh well here. Some malt goodness I noted in the 2008 came out at the very end of the glass. So to sum- not sure if this particular bottle was stored well or if that's how aged Bigfoot is supposed to taste, but I didn't really care for the 2006. I didn't change my original rating though.  Update 8/15/08: Had another 2006 vintage. Lots of apple skins, sweet malt, with a slightly bitter finish. I have concluded now, after having had other aged barleywines, that this bottle has been stored properly and that this is how aged Bigfoot is supposed to taste. Therefore, I conclude that I am not much of a fan of aged barleywines. Fresh only, please!  Original rating: 8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)  Update 2/12/09. 2009 bottle. Aroma is quite hoppy (citrus) with some caramel and cracker malt in the background. Flavor is largely caramel malt with sweet fruits. A touch of floral hops in the finish. Heavy palate but drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,DrMalt,4.5,"Vertical tasting of 2005; 2006; 2007 & 2008.  Enjoyed this beer many times before but finally assembled a vertical tasting of different vintages.  I couldn't find many differences between the 05 & 06. The hop bitterness has mellowed in comparison to the 07 & 08.  All vintages had similar color, head & lacing. Aromas were more subdued in 05 & 06.  Although I enjoyed the 05 & 06 I think the 08 has high potential for a winner in years to come. Luckily I bought a six pack of the 08's.  I expected more variance in the tastes of each vintage but was equally impressed with how well the earlier vintages had retained or even improved on their flavours.  A long time favourite of mine & now I can attest to its ability to continue to be a solid beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,cpn920,3.4,This was my first venture into a Barleywine Style and I have to say I'm not a fan based on this first encounter. It poured a nice golden brown/orange color with a modest head. Smelled very piney and citrusy. I didn't care for the taste. It seemed overly bitter but that may be the style and I haven't acquired the taste for it yet. It also seemed oily with not a ton of malt to it. I wouldn't want to drink another in the same sitting but I am looking to try the style to see if it was just this particular SN or if it is my lack of appreciation for the style.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,jpiper,3.3,"Poured from a bottle at below cellar temperature.  A dirty, unclear brown pour with a modest head which quickly dissipates to a swirly lace.  The aroma is a bit subdued - perhaps too cold. Dried fruits as expected: raisins, cherries. A bit of medicinal smell - somewhat like a cherry cough syrup: not the best mental association.  Wow - the flavor is too much - way too much. Not at all balanced or integrated. There's malt, fruit, bitter hops - but too much bitter, not enough fruit, and way too much alcohol for the ABV. Wow, second sip comes right back with the intense bitter hops. The malt is still there, but I just don't like how it all comes together. It does get better with more sips. And it does least a pretty nice aftertaste after about a minute or so.  Tough to get past the unbalanced taste when getting to the mouthfeel, but independently, it's pretty nice. Thick, but not cloying.  Drinkability is pretty low here. A sipper, and it'll be tough to get through the entire bottle of this.  People say this cellars like a champ. I can see the possibility. I think I may pick up a handful of these and let them site. We're talking at least 3 years, though. Maybe I'll get 12 and try them every 2 years.

140,2671,malcontent,4.55,"2008 Edition, one year later.  Into a goblet, this barleywine sports a far more impressive head than I would have guessed. The caramel-colored body is clear as crystal and the lacing is sticky and generous.  Holy Hell, is that a hoppy barleywine! Big grapefruit up front with deeper tones of dried apricots and rum.  Just a huge malty body here and it had better be; the hops are even more aggressive. Citrus-y to an extent but more pine-driven than anything with rich caramel sweetness hidden below. Raisin undercurrents and spice surface before being buried beneath a closing avalanche of grapefruit pith hop bitterness. Yum.  Carbonation is contained but not to the extent where this becomes a listless, syrupy mess like so many others. The finish is understandably resiny, given all the hops. I'd almost like to dock it points due its deviation from the traditional English barleywine, but I guess this is the one that established the American style as a separate category. Worth the wait.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Dark fruits and doughy aromas as well.  T: Sweet maltiness hits the palate at first. A bitter hop bite and some hot alcohol hits during and after the swallow. A bitterness lingers on the tongue.

140,2671,bheilman,3.92,"I love the color of this beer. It also tastes good. I just had a green flash barley wine and that set the new standard for me. This is nice and I have been very satisfied with Sierra Nevada, but it didn't live up to that standard. It has a good maltiness, but the hops hits a bit hard. Maybe the combination isn't quite right for me. It leaves a little too much of a sour flavor in my mouth. The alcohol doesn't really stand out, so that's nice, and in general it's definitely a solid beer.  Just drank another one forgetting that I already reviewed this beer and my opinion is about the same, read if you'd like:  This beer tastes very fresh. I'm aging it a bit hoping it will mellow. The appearance is a nice dark golden color, but the head was a bit thinner than I would like. It does have a very nice hoppish smell. The taste is too bitter for me. Almost like sucking on a lemon and that is why I mentioned I hope it mellows a bit. It's definitely a unique flavor and probably the hoppiest barleywine I have ever had. I just want the malt to show some backbone. The aftertaste is ok and the flavor does stir around for a while. It's not so drinkable given the extreme bite and the high alcohol. Definitely a unique barleywine, but not my favorite. I like the label. Had another one from the same batch.  This beer has been in my ""cellar"" for at least 10 months. I am comparing it directly to a Stone Old Guardian. It is darker, but fairly clear and a nice whisky colored ruby brown. The smell is great with a sweet hoppy scent stronger on the hops. The taste is good, but definiteyly hop intense. I thought that would relax after months, but it is still the initial flavor that hits you. The after taste is good becuase the hops finally starts to drop and you get the smooth sweetness of the barley to shine through. The beer isn't entirely that drinkable. It is too hoppy. I like a hoppy beer, but given the intense hops and the high alcohol, I can't handle more than one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,PhxHorn,4.12,"This was a 2007 version, aged for a year and then given to me in a trade. The color is an orange-brown, cloudy, with a quarter-inch of tan head. Smells of caramel, figs, malt. Tastes of all those, plus some berries I can't quite place, some Xmas candy-type flavors, a trace of hops, grapes, maybe some apple and pear, too. Lots of flavor going on. Not real intense, but complex and enjoyable. Carbonation was just right. Not a beer you can drink quickly--this took me an hour to sip my way through it.

Sweet, malty, and hoppy scents blend delightfully and in balance. the booze is noticeable.  Deep, rich blend of alcohol, malt and hops. Very well balanced.  Low carbonation, some modest warming, full bodied, creamy texture with bitter, dry finish.  This big, bold, winter ale is quite smooth. It has a very nice hop element that balances the malt. This is clearly not a session beer, rather one to sip, savor and share.  This is a great beer.

140,2671,BWH3,4.33,"A: Deep copper with a medium to large off white head which contains just a glimmer of orange. The beer has a fair amount of gas flowing on the pour. The head lasts and finally settles as a juicy ring. Only deductions for lack of clarity with its chill haze. This was overridden by the depth and majesty of the copper color. Furthermore, a swift swirl of the glass reveals the viscosity and the legs in this ale.  S: As you would expect from the Chico brewing company, big big citrus hops wallop the nose in this bouquet. As the beer warms and with some agitation the other resinous hops aromatics arise. The caramel malts are palpable but not as prominent as the hops. Bold and simple but all the elements are properly represented. The hops could show more elements to earn higher marks.  T: The tasting begins with a mild creamy caramel sweetness to set the palate up for the bitterness to follow. The bitterness begins as a earthy and mineral dull bitterness that slowly sharpens and mutates into the citrus and resin flavors so prominent in the nose. The alcohol warms the belly. The flavors are not as big as the aroma, nor do they have a complexity deserving the highest rankings. None the less very good.  M: Creamy, good head retention, a touch on the gassy side for style. Full bodied and exceptional texture on the palate.  D: Perhaps the best beer from Sierra Nevada. Overall, a widely available and very good example of the barleywine style.

140,2671,kels,3.6,"2008 edition poured from the bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Great variation in the opaque coloring from reddish brown to honey gold with a tight 1 1/2-finger head in a frothy toast color. Head dissipates quickly, but leaves giant rings of lacing behind as I drink.  Smell: The first thing I note is the heavy, chewy maltiness in the smell. It is sweet caramel with toasty graininess that suggests a thicker, richer taste. Brightening notes from the hops and a really fruity presence - citrus, and a berry-like note - add to a definitely complexity that I can't claim to fully decipher.  Taste/Mouthfeel: The alcohol is humongous in this beer - more so than in some other really well-rated barleywines I've tried. It is a little overwhelming to the rest of the tastes, so much that I have trouble separating them from the alcohol's sharp dryness. The clear taste is a big bitter hop presence - citrusy and bitter grapefruit and orange peel taste with some sappy, dry pine in the aftertaste. The previously noted smells of the caramel malts are barely detectable in the taste in comparison to the hops, but do provide a syrupy baseline to the overall taste. The mouth is a heavy medium with a very sticky finish and moderate carbonation.  Drinkability: Phew, I'm not even halfway through, and I can already feel my cheeks getting red and my body relaxing:) I definitely couldn't do more than one of these every once in a while. The stickiness and uber-present alcohol would keep me from coming back to this one too often.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

This beer is full body and full flavor that you can sink your teeth into. Some bitterness and warm alcohol finish. Doesn't seem as good as '05 or '04 versions.  Bottle from 2004 consumed July 24th, 2006. Murky amber color with off white to tan-ish head. Strong fruity aroma with hints of malt and a bit of alcohol. Excellent lacing. Yum, thick rich mouthfeel. The caramel flavor really jumps out at you. The fruitiness has faded away over time. I'm left with a very nice toffee after taste. Wow, real smooth with faint alcohol taste hidden away.

Taste was a bit sweeter than some of the barleywines I've had recently. Got a lot a notes of seeded fruits like fig in the flavor. This sweetness seemed to help with the drinkability of this beer.

Big Foot smells like brandy with tropical candy fruit in it. Maybe some biscuit? Poured a muddy caramel color with a small, quickly evaporating head.  The taste is not subtle. Thick, heavy hops, Grande Marnier orange sweetness, caramel and butterscotch immediately up front. This is balanced by a raisen, toasted malt, and dark chocolate-like bitterness. An alcohol taste is omnipresent but never suppresses the sweet and bitter balance of Big Foot. Fittingly low carbonation.  Dude, there's a picture on the bottom of the bottle cap. That's awesome.

140,2671,seaoflament,4.15,"Thanks to Joey for giving me this bottle. 2007 vintage.  Nice looking beer. Pours a dark ruby with a good inch and a half of foam with great retention. A few soapy bubbles cling on to the side of the glass.  I wasn't a big fan of this one when I had it fresh last year, or was it two years ago? Too hoppy for my liking at that point.  The aroma is of citrus flowers, grapefruit, caramel, toffee, light chocolate, orange flavored chocolate, brown sugar, a bit of vanilla, and a touch of grassy hops. This is how I'm liking my barleywines. A nice multi-bread and nutty malt profile. There's also a fruity alcohol aroma in the background that comes off as cherries in syrup. Some good complexities going on in this one. After a few minutes of just smelling this beer I am starting to pick up a few spicy notes like cayenne pepper.  Earthy and citrus bitterness upfront with a wave of caramel, toffee, and chocolate. It finishes with more bitterness, lemony and citrus rind, and a bit of alcohol. A bit fruity with cherry, raisins, dates, and prunes. I'm also picking up a bit of bubblegum flavor in the finish. Dry, resiny, pine aftertaste.  A little dry in the finish, enough carbonation to pick up the massive malt flavors and keep this from being too sweet (and the hops play their part there too), but it doesn't leave too much residual sugars on the lips.

It is cloudy, light passes through easily enough, but you can't see any clear images. There was some lacing.  The smell is of dark fruit with a hint of vanilla. The scent of bourbon from being aged in a bourbon barrel. The bitter scent of hops is present, almost overpowering. The taste is a mixture of roasted malts, vanilla bean and hops. The bitterness from the hops overpowers the scent and the taste of the beer, and leaves a very IPA like aftertaste to it. I'm not sure if this beer is just a little skunky or if it should taste like this as it doesn't taste like any other barleywine style ale that I've ever tasted. Although I will say that you can't taste the alcohol in this 9.6% Alcohol by Volume beer.  This is medium bodied beer that is light on the carbonation. There is some coating to it, which may be why the aftertaste sticks around for a long time.  This beer was given to me back in June and had been lost in the back of the fridge since. It may have gone skunky in that time so I'm thinking of getting another one to re-review it at another time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Pauly2X,4.08,"A- Deep reddish brown, half finger head.  S- Strong earthy hop aroma with citrus undertones held in restraint by heavy caramel.  T- Big fat caramel malts hit you at first along with an alcohol dryness that rides throughout. An assertive yet not overpowering hop bite follows quickly as to not let the malt take center stage. Great balance ensues throughout the middle and into a smooth, hoppy, dry finish.  M- Full and rich without being too heavy.  D- Dangerous, nuff' said.

140,2671,Phocion,4.23,"2008 vintage poured into a Unibroue tulip. Deep, dark mahogany color with a retentive and frothy beige head with thick lacing.  Aroma is full of caramel malts, bready/biscuity, citrusy hops, and mildly spicy, in that order.  Very complex flavor. Brown sugar and biscuity with a healthy dose of bitter hoppiness, and obviously the alcohol flavor as well. Most barleywines I've had in the past have either ventured more towards too-sweet or immensely bitter, but this Bigfoot strikes the perfect balance.  Definitely full-bodied, and smooth if not a little dry. Obviously not a session beer, but overall very drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,everetends,4.2,"2008 vintage. Purchased at Four Winds in P'cola, FL. Poured into a tulip.  A: Pours a really nice amber color.

S: Nice citrusy hops, sweet malty presence, biscuits, resin and alcohol. very nice.  T: Taste is of the same citrusy hops, a little sweet, a little bitter. Malt is sweet and biscuity. Resin comes in big time. Piney flavors are definitely there. Alcohol really rounds this out.  M: Medium bodied to full bodied. Really sticks in the mouth. Big time resin in the feel that lingers in the aftertaste. Alcohol burns a bit. Still, very nice.  D: This is a really good brew. It needs some time to round the edges. Very drinkable for the ABV.

Real nice hop aroma with a fruity, candy presence. Strong hoppy flavor, tangy sour fruits with caramel malts. Very rich and full and the flavors balance well. Bitter and slightly dry finish and bitter hops tingle on the tongue long after the sip. Good stuff. Strong hops but the 2005 version I had before was a touch stronger hop flavor.

140,2671,hellomcfly,4.24,Poured from a growler into a snifter.  A - Pours a nice ruby-amber; great color. Head isn't huge but I attribute this to being from a growler and not being very easy to pour.  S - I really love the way this beer smells. Nice citrusy hop aroma but also very malty and bready in the smell. Alcohol smell also detected.  T - One of the best all around barleywines in my opinion. It has a certain sweetness but is rounded out by a big hop profile and slight alcohol burn that lets you know you're drinking a big brew.  M - Nice mouthfeel. Full bodied and creamy with the right amount of carbonation.  D - Not the most sessionable beer in the world but for a barleywine it rates pretty high with me.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Complex as the hops really battle it out with the malts in the nose. However, the taste produces battle where the hops win - tart, coarse, oily hops that are a bit harsh. Malty sweetness comes in the back, similar to light caramel. As the beer warmed the hops mellowed out more and the malt profile show some more...

140,2671,halfP1NT,3.85,"This review is based on a new 2008 bottle.  This beer appears a hazy mahogany color with ruby highlights. An aggressive pour yields a one finger, off-white head that sticks around leaving some lacing, then dissipates to a foamy cap.  Smell is sweet malts with a touch of fruitiness and a definite hops presence. Caramel and dark fruits are apparent; plum, cherry. An earthy, hop bitterness is present as well.  Taste starts off with a sweet maltiness. Some of the dark fruit flavors come through. It finishes with a huge dry, bitter hop bite that almost makes my mouth pucker and lingers long after the sip. I'm getting flavors of rye, cherry and fig. There is a bready quality that makes this beer very full bodied.  The hops are almost a bit overwhelming. After the first sip, it becomes difficult to pick out other flavors associated with the malts because the hops have such a strong, lingering presence. Not that that's a bad thing, but it definitely makes this a very distinctive Barleywine.

140,2671,100floods,4.33,"I bought a 6-pack back in february. It's August and this is the first bottle I've opened bottle in the pack.  I poured it into a Caracole tulip glass. It starts off as a light amber and turns to a dark red by the end of the pour. A hefty, yet light tan foam dominates the top. It tastes almost similar to the beer itself.  Not much change after 6 months, and who knows when this batch was made either. A strong chalky/hop taste is what is first noticeable and pretty much dominates. I'm guessing colombus, and very little finishing hops, none that I could smell. This beer wants to act first and ask questions later. This flavor makes it a little dry to the pallet, but not bad. A similar aroma would be more apparent if it was a younger bottle (there is no noticeable aroma at this point, any and all was experienced imediately after opening the bottle and when there was foam). There are slight sweet notes similar to Old Foghorn, but you really have to search for it, because it's downplayed by the hops.  I am curious to see how long this beer could age, or if it even changes over time.

Nose is alcohol, caramel and sugar, maybe some toffee and dried fruit, plenty of bitter hops. Flavor is full-bodied, and hoppier than expected and more bitter than I expected, somewhat obnoxious on the taste. As it warms, the finish takes on some licorice flavors. Mouthfeel is thick, bitter, off balance, tingly with alcohol and warming. That bitterness leaves it off balance to me. This thing need some age to mellow out and kill that hop bitterness. I know that American Bwines are hopped to Hell but sometimes you have to find common ground. To bitter and unpleasant to drink. I like SN but not giving it an A just because of the name or label.

As the head recedes there is lots of sticky lacing left clinging to the glass.The aroma is of earthy malts, dried fruits and piny hops. Upfront you can taste the earthness of the malts and barley. Dried fruit as in plums and raisins. The hops definitely mellowed with age but still gives you that grassy/piney bitterness that lingers. The aftertaste of malts stays with you until your next sip.

The aroma is a very nice citrusy hop over a strong alcoholic ale smell. Hints of sweet (but not too sweet) liquors. Overall, it smells like a hoppy pale with something extra. The two distinct aromas create a tandem of strong, heavy flavor.  The intial citrus/grapefruit taste is followed by a strong liqueur/grenadine flavor at the swallow. The pale malts emerge as it warms up, and the flavor becomes even more complex. It's obviously chock-full of alcohol. The citrus really does come out the more it warms up. The flavors are uniformly extreme, but always in balance, which somehow makes it less extreme.  There is a serious whiskey burn on the way down, and it's very thick. Typical barleywine feel. Very strong and pumped full of flavor. The citrus and alcohol battle it out to a draw. One is plenty.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,Ineedabeerhere,4.07,"(2008)-This is a great beer, and a nice entry into the American Barleywine style.  Pouring it into my DFH Snifter, its a great dark amber color. Definitely aromatic. I can smell it as Im pouring. The head is a good size, after an aggressive pour. This beer gets better and more aromatic as it warms up. Remember that as you drink it.  In the aroma, the alcohol is definitely present. The hops are definitely there also, a little more than one might expect. Overall the aroma is very similar to what I would expect out of a DIPA, the citrusy tones, but with an earthier backbone. This comes out in the taste also.  I cant help but think that the taste is dominated by the earthiness. I get a lot of dark fruits like dates. There is also a nutty quality hiding behind the alcohol flavors and hops.  Its great on the palate. Perfect amount of carbonation. I really think that it feels full on the tongue and isn't a beer to be sessioned.

Head sustains a thick layer for a long time, leaving a thick layer of sticky lace.  S: Lots of hops with a very heavy, caramel malt backbone.  T&M: This is a barleywine, and I mean that in an emphatic way. This beer is exaggerated, but also in a good way. Very strong bitterness and hop flavor shocks my tongue, as a syrupy thick maltiness coats the inside of my mouth. Very strong resiny pine flavors and grapefruit/citrus pith. Carbonation is low, but enough to satisfy. This is a very complex brew, and VERY bitter. Definitely for my fellow hopheads and not for the faint of heart.  D: Low. This stuff is thick, syrupy, bitter, sweet, etc. It is very good to sip and enjoy, but definitely at the beginning or end of a night.

140,2671,Buebie,4.35,"2009 Review  Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into my Sam Adams turbulator. Transparent, darker amber color with orange and red hues. Nice thick 2 finger off white head, looks like sea foam. Receeding to a thick white colar and very thick and sticky webs of lace.  Aroma of pine and grapefruity hops with a touch of sweet orange peel. Caramel maltyness and an almost maple brown sugar aroma.  A good doseage of smooth creamy carbonation up front, becoming a bit more prickly at the swallow. This is somwhat thick and chewy with loads of malt and hops, well balanced for the amount of hops. This is much hoppier then I remember it being last year. Sweet malty brown sugar and carmel roll buttery flavors. At the swallow the pine and grapefruit really pick up, now dominateing the taste and lingering bitter for a long period.  Very good as always.  ---_-_-__-_-_-___---__-_----_--____---___--__---___---_---____--___-_----__---___---___  2008 batch  Purchased from Heritage Liquore in St. Paul.  I dont know what it is, but I've been having really good luck with great brews latly, this is another of my fav's.  Poured a 12 ounce stubbed brown bottle into a 16 ounce mug. 3 Finger white foamy head. Huge thick laceing all around the glass. Color is a redish semi tranparent amber.  Smell's of sweet malt and piney hops. The smell is pretty mellow and misleading. As this brew is packing a punch.  Taste is absolutly outstanding!  Upfront is a diceptivly sweet malty grain flavor all through the middle. Then at the swallow, alchahol warming and BLAMO! Hop abbundance. There is a nutty coffe like flavor in there after the swallow as well about 4 seconds in, that quickly dissapers into hop linger.  Finish is dry and hoppy, pine, grapfruit, some hop oil. This is a massively hoped beer. But its balanced well with the sweet malty beginning. Mouthfeel is well medium creamieness with moderate carbonation.  Excellent beer.  _--__-____---___---___---_&gt;..._----.-&gt;___-_--___&gt;  1998, the year I graduated highschool. Although I did not drink beer then, it is sure nice to revisit this year with a beer brewed at that same time.  So, I found a $3 bottle of 1998 bigfoot, here goes...  Poured from a brown stuby bottle into a snifter. The rigerous pour has produced really no head, just some random bubbles. A rigerous swirl bring back an inch of foamy white head. The color is a dark brown, not at all transparent. small spots of lace and a now colar of retention.  Aroma is all malt, hops are gone. Its sweet and smells of dark fruit, prunes, figs and rasins. Brown sugar is a big part of the aroma here. Its very sweet and malty, still a good amount of fresh cereal grain aroma. Candy sugar too.  The mouthfeel is pretty thick with an oily creamyness. Carbonation does not tickly put does give a bit of a snap to the flavors. HOPS DO LIVE! Wow, hops are still present in the taste, amazing! It starts out thin, becoming increasingly creamy and full. It also starts out with little flavor, suddenly awaking in my mouth from 11 years of hibernation. Caremelly sweetness, brown sugar, more roasty now with some darker roasty grain flavors. Hops wake up and bit just before the swallow. The are super bitter now, almost boiled down to one pungeant smack, then fall away after the swallow. There is hemp, pine and like a boiled down hydroponick grapefruit hop flavor. For about 5 to 10 seconds I'm in hop heaven. Then it mellows again. Malt and semi sweet brown sugar come around, balance it out. Bittering hops linger, alongside a buttery sweet maple brown sugar malt flavor.  This is the oldest beer I've ever drank and by far one of the most fun reviews I've done. Its means so much more to me to do one in a year that was extra special. This brew is very fine indeed and only gets better with age, as I've now learned.

140,2671,johnnieoz,4.43,"25th Edition of the Bigfoot Expedition: 2008 bottle.  A: Nice pour, leaving a big off-white head. One finger remains for quite some time. The reddish-brown hue lets just enough light through to show off its brilliance.  S: Green raisins, ripe plums and dried apricots.  T: Intense and brief sweetness hits the tip of the tongue. This maltiness is then complemented by creeping, potent and lingering hops. Still, the taste is sensationally balanced and leaves the palate abuzz.  M: This ale feels fantastic in the mouth - it's just heavy enough, there are some hop oils but they don't dominate. As the juicy ale swishes about, all kinds of flavors announce their presence.  D: How DO you rate the drinkability of a barleywine? Well, this one is eminently drinkable. Far from a session beer, you can still manage two in one sitting. Not bad for a 9.6% abv...then again, that's a lot less than some of Bigfoot's compadres out there.  The Bigfoot still rules the roost and Pacific Northwest.  Pairing note: this combined really well with Rogue Creamery's Smokey Blue Cheese (Oregon). It's pungent blue cheese sharpness is balanced by caramel sweetness, which is the result of smoking over hazelnut shells.

But here goes, it had a chewy mouthfeel, quite caramelly but matched by the bitterness of the hops. This stuff was out of season and not aged (2008). Guy next to me said it was good to age it so that the maltiness could come through. I could see that because there was a thick mouthfeel provided by the dark malts and the oiliness of the hops.

I had it on draft in a snifter for a very affordable price- I believe under $5. The color was very clear and orangey-amber with little visible carbonation. Smelled of whispy cascade hops. The taste was also of cascade, crystal malt, and alcohol, but not in an extreme sense like ""i'm drinking straight vodka mixed into a normal beer.""

Sweet malty and fruity notes with a hop bitterness that really packs a punch at the end. Despite the high alcohol content, it just brings some warmth and not a lot of burn.  The mouthfeel is very smooth and silky, not quite oily, but getting there.  For my first experience with the style, I wasn't sure what to expect. Very complex. Although it mellows very nicely as it warms, it's definitely a sipper, and I would probably just have the one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

A musty sweetness with some grape jelly and rasins.  T: The first thing that hit me was the hoppiness of the beer. It still felt pretty hoppy, extremely so for a 10 year old beer. Taste like a tawny port with a nice maple syrup rasiny taste. Big malt kick. That fades right to a big hop spiciness and alcohol and a long finish of warmth and bitterness.  M: mouthfeel wasn;t as syrupy and heavy as I expected. Still a good bit of carbonation. Though it wasn't light feeling by any means.  Ovr: First of all, big thanks to brewandbbq for a 10 year old bigfoot as an extra in a trade. It was ag reat great beer. I got the farmiliar fig/port taste of a good aged barly wine, but the amount of hop bite still left in this was unbeliveable.

Smells primarily of northern hops, citrus, malt, and some spices. Hard to pick out anything subtle because of the intense hops.  First taste is very potent hops, some grapefruit, possibly cloves, a bit of malt, and not a whole lot else.  Spicy carbonation, severely bitter hops (typical of SN), fairly smooth but extremely potent, medium body, hoppy and syrupy finish. This doesn't taste so much like a barleywine as it does a malty IPA. In that respect it would be pleasing (except for the estery finish), but I'm not convinced it fits the style enough. Still an interesting and enjoyable brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

M - Medium bodied that finishes very smooth.  D - Very good beer. I have come to expect nothing less from Sierra Nevada. I had the 25'th expedition bottle brewed in 2008.

Hops fill the palate and fade as a warming slowly builds. A sweet maltyness lingers.  Mouthfeel: Full! My first taste felt thick/syrupy but as I continued to drink a lighter side pulled through.

Surprising amount of floral hop in the aroma. Still, the main smell is a lightly sweet malt.  Oily and rich, the greatest flavor is the powerful amount of fresh hop. The malt base is potent with a touch of malt sugar. Lots of warming alcohol. The body has the consistency of skim milk and the carbonation is quite low.  This is a pleasant beer to be slowly enjoyed.

When held up to light it was similiar to trying to describe a beautiful sunset. Is it more red or orange? Clear with a thick 2 finger head and although dissipating was retained through the end.  Detected a hint of pine, some citrus like tones and floral. One of the better smelling beers I have tasted.  This was my first barleywine style ale and it was very shocking how a beer can be so sweet, syrupy and bitter all at once. It was an even battle between sweet or bitter. A perfect match to taste the malt flavor and hops.  This beer will really warm your esophagus down to your tummy. All the times sneaking up on you with a suprising high alcohol content. I could not drink more than a couple of these before it was becoming too over whelming with the strong taste. I will buy again but this sixer I bought is going to last me several days.

The aroma is a little disappointing though. I couldn't get much except some floral hops. It tastes very crisp for the style. It's not sweet, but fairly ballanced.

Starts with a tiny bit of sweetness, with maltiness in the middle, followed by a strong hop and malt aftertaste. The aftertaste is heavy and warms the throat. Flavourful stuff that makes you take notice. Different from what I think is a typical barleywine.

Poured into an Old Guardian glass, on to the beer:  Deep reddish copper with a compact frothy head on top. Some clumps of yeast splash into the beer during the pour, but I'm not surprised. Big hop aroma with some burnt sugar and caramel notes. The taste is exploding with hops, but the balance is pretty good for what it is. Citric and piney at first, dextrin and fruity esters then take over the ride, then a burst of passionfruit and pine bury the palate in the aftertaste. Thick and smooth like syrup.  Great success.

Mild burn in the aroma. Rum covered raisins come to mind first. Not as hoppy as I wouldve thought.  T: Tasty indeed, a whack of caramel up front but left in the back with nothing virtually but hops and a good chewy flavor. This is a really nice 'barleywine style ale'. All of these attributes come together ideally. As the beer warmed a bit, took a bit of a different order: whack of hops, awesome maltiness, then the hop coating. Taste the alcohol in a good way.  M: Syrupy as it should be. Nice and chewy texture. Comforting to the throat- strong characteristics.  D: One of the most drinkable of the style. A bit more than a sipper and I like the mild burn. When I think non-over the top European barleywine without being over the top, this is the definition.  I recommend highly, another good job by Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The first sip hit me hard with a lof of flavor. This offering is very hoppy and sweet. I get a lot of fruit in there and some earthy flavors as well. As I drank it out of the bottle, I could not get a good feel for the head, but it wasn't foaming much in the bottle. I could taste the alcohol (9+%) but it wasn't at all overpowering and felt pretty well balanced. Great mouthfeel (you know it's there).

140,2671,drperm,4.1,"This review is for the 2006 release. One of the stupider food-and-beverage labeling laws in the U.S. is the one that prevents barleywine from being marketed as such; the oh-so-lame ""Barleywine-style Ale"" being the result. It's enough to make a socialist into a libertarian.  Because, at the end of the day, there IS a difference between ""Barleywine"" and ""Barleywine-style-ale."" Barleywine is a very old, traditional, revered style of strong ale hailing from the UK. Any number of American variations and interlopers on the style exist, taking liberties and experimenting with the brew.  Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot is a tremendous offering in the classic English vein, a true ""Barley Wine."" It exhibits robust hopping and strong malty tones, with a whopping 9.6% ABV.

I poured it in a standard American pint glass as that's the type I keep in rotation. The color was red/brown with a creamy head that stuck around and thicker than just left lacing as I drank.  It smelled very strongly of hops.  The taste revealed that the beer was as hoppy as the smell led me to believe with a strong bitter character as well. The maltyness is what led me to edit my review. I find that it tastes much better to me when enjoyed rather cold which is to say as it warms and develops into its true self, I like it less. As it warmed, it almost tasted salty.  The mouthfeel was medium thick and went down well, thinning as it warmed.  I am not a hops lover and the hops quality of this beer would prevent me from having it often much less having several.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,TroyS,3.91,"Sierra Nevada Bigfoot 2008 Barleywine Style Ale is a really nice brew that'll warm you up. I purchased some of this fine offering at the state store in Provo, Utah. I bought 12oz. bottles.  It's suprising that all Utah liquor laws aren't a pain in the ars; I live in Idaho and Utah, but buy more regular brews out of the state liquor store because they offer a great price even though it is government and they don't pick the great ones like they do at my favorite shops in Idaho.  Anyhow...Bigfoot 08' is simple, warm and nice. I use the nice word because it is not an offensive barleywine at all. It pours with a real big head; the head pours lighter than most barleywines that I've had, but still carries color and a bit O' head is good for everyone and will linger until your last sip unlike so many barleywines what loose any sign of head after a couple of minutes.  The color is beautiful. An amber glowing almost showing like a dark apricot color. It's a real beauty of a brew; the first moments that it's in your mouth you'll taste a hint of sweet nectar flavor. So, the apricot is there in appearance and hiding in there to surprise your taste buds if you look for it.  The nose on this one seems a tad light and skunky; the skunk aisn't an old beer skunk, but more of a bitter dry skunk that's appreciated rather than shunned; keep in mind that the skunk ain't always bunk;)  So...this one drinks really smooth. I love a great looking beer! The appearance plays into the rest of the picture as does aftertastes. If it tastes like ars then the sweat aftertaste is stinky ars and nobody likes a stinky one....right? Well....this one is a bit heavy in the mouth, but not too syrupy or not too much alcohol either. This is a smooth and pleasant brew that I'd recommend especially for those that haven't tried too many stronger alcohol/hopped offerings.  Cheers to Sierra Nevada. This is a great main stream offering. Hip Hip Horray!!!  The only thing that could make this one tastier is with a stack of Doctor Grandma's Whole Grain Pancakes; those suckers go down smooth with nearly every style of brew;) Thanks Sierra Nevada and keep up the great work! As always...please throw in a few extra hops for me.  Oh....didn't mention the hop presence of this Bigfoot which was subtle and balanced. This is one if the defining characteristics of this particular Bigfoot. I'd personally call it slickfoot since it's not too incredibly ""big,"" but won't go unnoticed, so in that manor it most certainly is big. I like em' hoppy and Sierra Nevada delivered this one as a barleywine should be with a moderately strong introduction and a smooth and bitter finish with a hint of booze. This barleywine is quite smooth with out the stab that I've gotten from most other barleywines. 4 outa 5 I'd say.

The sweet dark fruit flavor is right behind that. They all come together at the back end of the sip for a big warming flavor that is a great combination.  Mouthfeel: Nice thick beer with a good amount of carbonation. Leaves a nice warming feeling as it goes down.

Can definitely taste the alcohol.  Very slick and oily from the hops. Still leaves a bit of stickiness on the tongue. Not very drinkable due to the high ABV (9.6%) and the intense bitterness.

Flavor: Malt right off the top but that quickly gives way to a very hoppy warm. I definitely get 9.6%. The hops give it a incredible citrus and floral flavor.  Mouth Feel: The hops cling to your mouth and just kick your salvia glands into overdrive. The high alcohol content gives it a distinctive warmth.

You are hit immediately with the piney taste of the hops which is quickly followed by the fantastic presence of a malty flavor with a hint of fermented fruit? Either way, deliciously overwhelming.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is present, but at the perfect level. The bubbles do not take away anything from the taste.

S: Huge bouquet of hops. Pine and citrus. Also noticed toasted malt, alcohol, and sweet caramel, but those aromas are playing hide-and-seek behind a wall built entirely of hops.  T: Big, bitter, piney hops accompanied by a large dose of sweet caramel malt, toasted malt, and (of course) alcohol. I also detected sweet fruity flavors of pineapple and apple and a notable black pepper hoppiness.  M: Slick and very oily. Bracing bitterness from the spicy/peppery hops and a noticable raggedyness from the alcohol help keep this from becoming a sweet malt bomb. Excellent, long lasting, peppery finish.

140,2671,SMark,4.28,This beer was poured into the middle of an Imperial pint glass at 53° from a 12 ounce bottle. This is the 2008 version. There was a thick three finger head which lasted quite a while and left considerable lacing. As stated on the label the beer was reddish brown.  Hops were the most dominant aroma. The bouquet indicated there would also be a hop presence in the taste. The malts were detectable in the background but it took a lot of effort to get past the hops.  There were definite hops and alcohol in the taste. The beer was slightly bitter which smoothed out nicely over time.  This was a full throttle beer with the hops and alcohol blending nicely. A warming sensation started in the mouth after the initial attack of bitter on the tongue and then carried on into the throat.  I would not recommend this for an extended session of drinking but definitely would imbibe and enjoy one or two over an hour or so.

S- thick vapor of pine and grapefruit still with alot of caramel toffee bready malt behind it. malt is present but with little complexity due to the magnitude of the hop aroma and the same goes for the alcohol. smells thick and super concentrated and if you sniff and sniff and become accustomed to the hop aroma the malt reveals itself a little more with dense italian bread and biscuit and even a rye sourness.  T- very herbal piney and burnt grapefruit rind, resin saturated wood, oak and cedar, brandy cask, hops lead the way here again, and they taste so fresh pungent it's like i wish this could be an ipa and barleywine could go even one step further... more charred kinda smokey bready malt flavor near the end again with the rye sourdough taste, this one has a definite hop advantage .

140,2671,TheTrevor,3.48,"This beer a poured a reddish copper with a single-finger beige head. The scent is mostly sweet malt with some fruity and floral characteristics. The taste starts off with some sweet caramel malt that quickly gives way to some piney hoppiness that lingers and finishes with a little bit of warming from the alcohol. The mouthfeel is nice and thick with a fairly low amount of carbonation and pleasant warming from the alcohol. This is a tasty beer that's definitely worth a try, but I think it might sit a little heavy to have more than one of at a time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ommegoose,3.14,"2008 bottling. I've been sitting on this since January, when I decided it was a bit too rough for me at the time. Hopefully four months has mellowed it more to my tastes.  Looks as good as I remember from before when poured into a goblet. Like a cherry-wood color, with strawberry red brightness when held to the light. The head was at about an inch and foamy, but receded to a cap moderately quick, leaving chunky bubbles in the middle. Leaves lacing all the way around when I give it a swirl.  I'm rather surprised at how little potency there is in the nose for such a high abv. Does not smell boozy, but does not smell like much of anything. I am not serving this cold at all either. Piney hops are most upfront. The bottle tells me to look for a dense, fruity bouquet. Maybe there are fruits in there that I haven't had before. The more likely case is that there's not much there yet. There's some sweetness that's hard to define.  I was hoping to not be overpowered by the hops in this tasting, but I was. For me to get much out of this beer I need to cellar it for quite a bit longer. Or so I thought initially... When trying to pick apart the front end of the flavor, I took a tiny sip, and found myself far less assaulted by the hops. I figure it's best to treat this like a liquor almost, and take rather small sips rather than full swigs. The very bitter back end and finish still dominate the first few sips, but this becomes less of a problem when acclimated. There's some sweet malt flavors, and if you wanted to get creative, you could find some fruit in there. The fruitiness probably has more to do with citrus attributes in the hops. Grapefruit is definitely back there. Piney flavors were heavier at first, but give way to floral and fruity notes later. As in the nose, the sweetness is hard to characterize, but it develops over time.  Pretty syrupy. I suppose that's what is to be expected here. Sticky. Lingers a long time on the finish. Not too much alcohol on the tongue, but it definitely is felt in the stomach.  This went from being something I didn't like much at all, to something that I find sort of drinkable. A 5 oz. snifter or something like that would have been fine for a sitting. I wouldn't think of two of these in a sitting. I am definitely not a hop head, so I'll cut the beer some slack, but am not going to give this an A just because everyone else has either. I'll revisit in a few months. Even if I like it then, I probably won't go out of my way for an expensive beer that I have to age a long time before I prefer it to any number of more affordable and readily available beers. However, an A- average after 1000+ reviews suggests that this is a beer that will please very many BAs.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Not much of a smell coming of it, faint hops & fruity.  Taste is very nice. Not the best barleywine I've ever had, but definitely not something I'd kick out of bed for eating crackers. Alcohol is more muted & subtle, which I dig, but lingers nicely on the back of the throat.

There were some small bubbles of carbonation visible in the hazy liquid. The head eventually dropped to a nice lace that left many sticky rings.  S- The aroma was a nice play between the malts and hops. There were strong, warm caramel scents that just edged out the earthy hop tones. On further sniffs, there were definite alcohol aromas hiding in the background.  T- There was more balance in the flavor. I'm used to sweeter variations of barleywine, but this one seems to work. The caramel tones were overtaken by dry pine flavors from the hops by the end of a sip.  M- The feel was nice and thick. The carbonation was light and the hops added a dry bite to each mouthfull.  D- This is a definite sipper, but a welcome nightcap or warmer on a chilly night. It's early spring and this beer really hit the spot.  Overall- A different, yet great, representation of the stye.

The first thing I notice upon sipping is that the ABV% must be pretty high (I don't read labels before reviewing). That, of course, should be expected from a barelywine but my point is the taste of alcohol isn't very subtle. It's sort of distracting.  Lots of hop bitterness. I expected more balance between the hops and malts. The only real malt presence is in the thick, heavy mouthfeel. Slight malty-sweet/syrupy finish is there, but again hops dominate.

T- Big citrusy hops right off the bat... Followed by the malt sweetness and spice that rides in on a wave of alcoholic warmth. These blend nicely after swallowing. The warm fumes hang around in the nasal cavity for a while. Very pleasant...  M- Fine, abundant carbonation, accentuated by the huge hop profile, gives Bigfoot a tart, crisp mouthfeel.  D- As far as Barleywines (or Barleywine Style Ales) go, I am fairly inexperienced. I first tried the style before my ""changing"", that is, bfore I discovered better beer and learned to appriciate it. I was fairly turned off, but still intrigued by the style at the time.

140,2671,Pencible,4.37,"2006 - This poured a fairly dark, transparent brown with a little head. It smelled very hoppy for a barleywine. The flavor was a little malt and citrus hops up front with a bit of malt and more hops in the finish. The texture was smooth with no discernable carbonation, but still a bit thin. This was much more like an imperial pale ale than a barleywine, to me. I liked it.  2009 - A: This poured a clear mahogany with light tan head. S: It smelled like strong pine hops with some caramel malt and orange hops. T: It tasted like strong bitter pine hops, like most Sierra Nevada beers, but had a bit more of a malt backbone and alcohol flavors. M: It was somewhat thick with moderate carbonation, and had a very lasting bitter aftertaste. D: This was a very hoppy barleywine fresh, but it had nice clean flavors and good body.

Lacing all the way through the experience. Attractive looking beer overall.  S: Seems to be a rather strong citrus hop aroma on top of a medium sweet malt smell. Not sure what the taste will bring as the label describes this as a 'barleywine'. I would expect a softer malt nose. The aroma of this reminds me more of an IPA.  T: Quite malty but truly balanced with hops, by which I mean there is a lot of both that assault the palate at once. I definitely get a clear presence of alcohol as well but only after the initial flavors go by. Rather warming on its way down. The finish is a little different as it seems like the hop bitterness is battling the malt sweetness for position on the linger, with the bitterness winning the fight.  M&D: Very heavy but not thick; leaves an almost oily feel in the mouth. Not sure if it's from all the hops or from the ABV. Not unpleasant either way but worth noting.

The one inch head is a rich and creamy beige fades into a cap in a few minutes. There is some decent amount of lacing which is nice because I wasn't expecting all that much. Really though the color on this beer is what gets me.  S: Wonderful but not in anyway overpowering floral hop aroma greets and teases the nose that hides a delicate malty sweetness, I'm thinking of rum or brandy and caramel covered cherries with a delicate syrupy sweetness, wonderfully balanced and delicate while still conveying a powerful aroma.  T/MF: There is a nice woodiness that I can detect here coupled with the strong hop profile in this beer. This gives way to a sort of dusty sugary maltiness that I can really only just barely detect because the hop profile on this beer is so strong as well as the alcohol heat that backs this beer up so effectively. The mouthfeel is also dominate by an intense hop bitterness that leaves the tongue and the back of the throat feeling rather dry, no one can argue that this beer is being lazy in the mouth. As the beer warms the malts are better perceived and balanced is restored to the beer. There is a light carbonation that, coupled with the prickly hops really makes this beer snap on the palate and now I'm beginning to pick up some buttery notes on the back end of this beer and I'm falling ever more in love with this little guy. And if I didn't mention this before there is this kind of dusty grainy texture I'm picking up here that really fills out the mouthfeel on this guy, you are definitely drinking a beer when you are drinking a bigfoot.

140,2671,yzer,4.88,"2008 Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Ale. Bottling code (on bottle) was 7349 making it a mid-December 2007 bottling. Purchased fresh from a well-stocked store today with three months of bottle conditioning.  My only criticism is a slightly soapy aromatic noticable from the head. No biggie.  Poured a dark amber (I'd call it Chris-Craft red) with burnished gold highlights. The look in a glass stein is clear with all of the head you could possibly want and curtains of lacing.  I think this 2008 Bigfoot is one of the best West Coast brews available right now and is not to be missed. First taste will hit you with a SN hops smackdown that will weed the men from the boys. About halfway through the glass your staggering tastebuds will relay the sublime balance of hops and powerfully rich malts. Caramelized sweetness, tartness, and floral accents are all in abundance is spite of constant whacking from iron strength hops. If you like steroid level hops and want to taste malt that stands up to it ... Bigfoot is the name.  Surprising good drinkability, just be prepared to ride or weave your way home after two.

It's bedtime and I've already had a couple other hoppy ales so I'm splitting the bottle. It doesn't suffer any: it's still beautiful. It looks great with a dense off-white head which leaves thick lace work down the sides of the glass and it smells...well, awesome! Candied fruit and piney, yet complex and flowery hops burst out of the little glass. This huge aroma dissipates and I get kind of sad, but then my first hoppy sip puts a smile back on my face. Ah, the piney hops mixed with the thick caramel malts and then that intensely bitter and dry finish. Bigfoot is never a cloying barleywine, that's for sure. It's drinkability is quite good for the style.  I eagerly await doing a flight of Bigfoot with fellow BA RedBaron; I love how this beer ages, We plan to take a stroll down memory lane sampling the last four or five years of 'Foot.

Appearance - A crystal clear copper/red with quite a bit more carbonation than I expected, little bubbles fighting their way to the smallish off white head.

Taste - Very hoppy from the outset with strong east coast ties. Drinks like a DAIPA but with a touch more complexity on the malt side. Alchohol brings in peppery notes well after the swallow. Pine and citrus dominate the palate. Malt just barely hints of sweetness. This is the way I like my barley wines. Balance is for other beers: give me malt, or give me hops :)  Mouthfeel - Very smooth across the palate. The aformentioned high carbonation is non-appearant across the tongue, although still present in the glass it's self. A little thick with a slick oilyness.

S - Big, big hop nose, not much of anything else can compete with it's potency. Very enticing.  T - Extremely sweet, almost unbearably so. The abv is right up front and it actually smacks the palate, the first sip almost made me choke. Some fruit notes manage to shine through a bit but are mostly drowned out by pine hops.  M - Full bodied, sharp on the tongue, low carbonation level.  D - Tasty, yes, but this is probably too much for me.

Still a nice, classic brew. Will go pick up some more to lay down.  2005. Sampled 9-23-2007. I believe it has been in cold storage all this time. I also have three more now that will lay for a while.  Pours a clouded brown with reddish hues. Raisin nose. Touch of alcohol. Still going strong on the nose. Flavor is hoppy, with raisins, minor alcohol, and...prunes? That is what I want to say. But I can't say I am a regular prune consumer. Feel has a smooth carbonation to it and the liquid is good too. Overall very drinkable still. I am sure this could have aged in a better fashion, but it is still going strong as if it never missed a beat. I will probably go back to the store I found this and buy the other bottles. (posted scores reflect this vintage)  2008. Sampled 3-9-2008. What? No more camping Bigfoot under the cap anymore? Lame. Pours beautifully. Nice darker amber with a thick creme head leaving a lot of lace. Nose is strong piney hops. Later on I get very noticeable grass that has a distinct minty edge. Flavor is smooth with a nice bitter bite to it. Robust and full. Feel has a great carbonation to it and the liquid is nice. Very, very nice. This is extremely good.

Nose has rich complex caramel smooth malt with some spicy piny hops beneath. Slightly sweet and gummy, there are many more subtle smells of spice, licorice, and grass. Alcohol definitely holds a presence.  Taste has smooth caramel and round malt in the front with a hint of sweetness, filling quickly with a lightly resinous and piny hop taste that rises in bitterness to the finish. Grainy at the end alongside the bitterness. Nice balance of flavors.  Feel is bold, mouth-coating slick/sticky character that dries up at the finish. Good firm body with plenty of carbonation to balance.  Considering all things, especially abv, this is a fairly drinkable beer. The flavor is a great balance of big hops and malt.

Appearance - Pours a reddish brown with a slick half finger tight white head. After the head subsided a layer of misty white bubbles floated on the top of the brew.  Smell - Strong piney hops is the first scent that hits you in the face. Great hop presence! Followed by a sweet caramel malt to balance out the nose.  Taste & Mouthfeel - A piney bitter hop taste consumes everything the moment the first drop hits your tongue. Then a beautiful caramel sweetness coats the mouth relieving the bitter taste. A little spice on the back of the tongue right before the finish. Alcohol warms the mouth on the end of the taste.  Drinkability - Damn fine barley wine. So good that I made sure to buy 2 cases of the 08 to go along with my 2 six packs of 07. This one will age beautifully after it's laid down for a few years. A treat to taste before maturing.

Pours a generous whysky cooper, thick head that thins down quicky and leave wonderful lace. Huge aroma of chinnok and c hops. I could smell this glass all night, loving it. Also present is a aromatic malty-sweet smell... very inviting.  Flavor is huge on hops, rich and floral, also nutty and butternut malt flavors. Straightfoward and also very complex.

Flowers in the nose for sure, a light carmel maltiness lingers in the background, piney, seems that alcohol may be present as well.  Tastes sweet on the tounge, hops seriously make a statement. A little fruity, raisins, a mystery flavor, alcohol for sure. The hops just keep coming while the alcohol warms everything up. I imagine cellaring for a year might help mellow it out a bit.

Surprisingly complex, not for a barleywine, but for such an inexpensive beer. This is a hopheads dream come true. :)  M - Creamy, smooth, and crisp. Medium-high carbonation and wonderful hop oils on the finish.  D - This is as good as it gets for the price. It's a big beer, so it's not particularly sessionable... but I can see drinking about 2 in a sitting.  A wonderful offering from Sierra Nevada... pick some up for now and later.

Smell - Caramel and toffee, fresh resiny hops and plainly noticeable alcohol.  Taste/mouthfeel - Flavors of caramel, biscuit, lemon peel and pine are most prevalent. Very balanced; the rich, syrupy malts are kept in check by an equally massive hop character. Bitter hops and bitter alcohol in the finish; somewhat rough. Warming as it settles in your stomach. Good stuff, and surprisingly easy to drink.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Nose is really strong floral, citrusy hops right up front. There are some fruity esters with some caramel notes as well. There's also a slight, but definite,alcohol presence.  Taste is very malty up front: some sweet caramel malts and biscuits, with a real noticeable alcohol bite that warms you instantly. The hops bombard you in the finish, which is very long, bitter and dry. Almost too much.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and for the most part pretty smooth.  It is drinkable, but with the high ABV burn and hop bite combined, it will definitely be a bit more drinkable with some aging.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,argock,3.81,"2008 vintage poured from 12oz brown bottle into an oversized wine glass  A: Stunning ruby-brown with healthy off-white head and tons of lace for a barleywine  S: Earthy and citrusy hops odors dominate up front, but there is a cloying sweetness of caramel and toasted malts there too  T: Tastes like an amped-up version of SN Harvest Ale with lots of spicy, grassy hops bitterness and bit smaller contribution of the sweet maltiness than you'd expect from the aroma. Still very enjoyable, but I bet this will be better in a couple of years.  M: The bitterness really hurts in this category as its level of hoppiness is very high to the point of feeling a little acrid and gritty.  D: A very drinkable barleywine, although it still feels like a bigger version of Harvest Ale or Celebration Ale to me.  2009 Vintage -- sampled on 2/8/10. Very much smoothed out after 1 year with barely any alcohol presence. Hops have faded but still provide a woody, earthy, floral bitterness which works well with the intense maltiness. The malts are robust without being harsh and finish with a delayed blast of toffee and chocolate that goes well with the tobaccoish hops. Excellent and makes me wish I'd bought more.  2010 Vintage -- sampled side-by-side with 2009 on 2/8/10. No comparison on which is better -- the 2009 is far and away more drinkable and way less alcoholic than the 2010. Very boozy with hops overwhelming and masking malts in a big way. I bought 12 and am definitely going to set the other 11 back for a while.

140,2671,JMH_,3.68,"2008 Edition:  Pours a deep ruby-brown colour with a huge pillowy head that hangs out for a while before dissolving to a mid-sized lace. Stickiness is simply incredible: walls of residue are left on the glass.  The aroma is far hoppier than any barleywine I've ever sampled: a bit of pine and a touch of citrus. There's definitely a general sweet fruit aroma here as well, along with some caramel and a hint of alcohol way in the back.  The flavour is a touch harsher than the aroma would lead on, but to me that put it closer to a true barleywine. Citrus is still present toward the back of each sip, with an earthier, slightly toasted malt flavour coming through much more so than anticipated from the aroma. Alcohol is also well hidden, being barely to non-noticeable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and perhaps could have been a bit slicker but was still right for the style.  For some reason, I don't drink this one often, but I think I may change that a bit. Aside from a (very nice) hop burst that dominates the aroma, this one has a nice balance even with the bigger than average hop profile to it. It's got a nice West Coast twist to it that's not distracting and makes for an easier drinking barleywine. A classic that has to be tried.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,morimech,3.46,"2008 edition pours a dark red with an one-fingered off-white head that has good retention. Moderate amounts of lacing left on the glass surface.  The smell is dominated by the hops. A heavy dose of citrus hops covers up the malt. A faint whiff of alcohol is also detected.  Taste wise this is the most hopped up barleywine I have had to date. Heavy dose of citrus covers up the malt. Not very well balanced in my opinion. Alcohol is about the only thing that cuts through the hops. Has a nice medium body and maybe a little over carbonated as it tingles and almost burns the tongue. I like the hops but I can see how people who are not hopheads would have a problem with this interpretation of a barleywine.

This rested on top of a dark, ruby/auburn shade of brown that barely had any light penetration. There was a vast hoppy aroma in my glass, with good traces of different type malts (i.e. chocolate, coffee in 2nd) and for a second I thought I had found a bourbon cask bottle on the cheap. There were some roasted malt flavorings, or at least some chocolate, coffee and hazelnut mixed in with caramel and/or honey on top of hops, so this beer had an extremely noticeable hop bite but was very tastey and very smooth. The only thing that limited its drinkability was the ABV being over session beer limit. I mean, this was a damn smooth beer, syrupy even, with malts all over the place that went down fine and it is inexpensive. On top of the hops and malts there were hints of citric fruit w/ other minimal flavors and I wish I would've bought more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Surprisingly nice hop malt balance for something that calls itself a barleywine.  Mouthfeel is rich and slightly syrupy with carmelized agave notes to the taste. I taste the malts first, followed by hops bitterness, but then a sweet finish.  I have had this on tap and like it, and it is good in the bottle too.

Poured from a 12oz. bottle that kinda looks like a stubby. This is the 2007 release.  Appearance: Pours a deep brown almost cognac-like in color with a thick 3 finger head that has a good staying power.  Smell: Resin-like, dried raisin with mild, bitter hoppiness.  Taste: Surprisingly subdued alcohol taste but rich in flavor. Dried fruit with a bitter finish. Warm & malt-like character dominates. Very tasty!  Mouthfeel: Very smooth as it coats the inside of the mouth like a warm blanket. Dried fruit presence restrained with an almost earthen quality. Aromatic, bitter-sweet & intense malt. Very comforting.  Drinkability: In a heartbeat, yes! Had to pace myself from finishing glass due to high abv. Alcohol very well hidden, allows me to appreciate the various flavors. If i had another, would have had it that evening.  Overall: A wonderful, winter brew for those cold nights (like last night).

My BF clocks in at 1-year old - the aging may have smoothed some of the rough edges, or maybe I just have developed a tolerance for strongale. Poured into a 16oz ""bar"" glass, Bigfoot kicks up very little head - it's as though the bubbles can't force there way through the viscous liquid.  The colour is mahogany. The ale lies thick on the tongue. The nose is alcoholic - the first beer that struck me as such. The taste is vey strong of heavy malt and bittering hops.  It's been a tradition of mine to buy a little Bigfoot every March, even thought it's really a bit much for me - I guess I like the challenge.

Appearance: Pours a clear deep ruby red colorcarbonation rising at the center of the chalice. The head formed small, a little less than one finger, and faded into a thin layer.  Aroma: Citrus and piney hops along with some sweet malts, mainly caramel.  Taste: The first thing I get is the hops, bitter citrus and piney hops in all their glory. Some caramel and toasted malts come through in the middle, but remain in the background. The finish is bitter and spicy hops with some alcohol warming.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied but smooth, you definitely feel the alcohol. The carbonation balanced out very well.  Overall: An all around great beer, there's no other way to put it. You have to really like hops to enjoy it (as is the case with most Sierra Nevada brews) but if you're a hophead this one's a must. I've got a one year old bottle in my cellar.

It poured a dark red, almost ruby-like color to medium orange with almost 2 fingers of head. As I drink it down. the lacing sticks to the glass and leaves rings.  This is very hoppy and bitter and dry. I taste citrus, and spices... it's almost toasty but the hops dominate. The alcohol is very warm, almost hot and overpowers after you drink. The mouthfeel and body is full and so strong that you don't taste the alcohol until the finish. The alcohol also sneaks up on you too.

M - Full with lots of carbonation sharpness, stays around on your tongue for a while.  D - This beer has good parts, but the whole seems to fall a little short..

140,2671,CrellMoset,4.48,"UPDATE: 08/15/08, 2007 Vintage bottle from Brawley's Beverage in Charlotte, NC. Poured into an Allagash glass.  Appearance: Completely opaque, a muddy reddish brown body with minimal carbonation, a big creamy, foamy, immaculately-bubbled head. Retention is fantastic. Lacing courtesy of Jackson Pollock - it's streaky in some places, solid and sheet-like in others, and drippy in others yet. Gorgeous.  Aroma: Totally mellowed out, with much softer, more delicate piney hops, a few citrus notes, and a great toasty malt body.  Taste: Wow. Fantastic. Great aged, mellow piney and citrus hops - grapefruit and tropical fruits - and a solid but absolutely manageable amount of bitterness that melds so well with everything else - and a huge array of malts, from sweet, bready grain all the way to caramel, toffee, and even light, sweet chocolate notes. Maple syrup and French toast sweetness lies hidden behind the first wave of piney bitterness. Not a hint of alcohol, either. Phenomenal.  Mouthfeel: Milky and creamy and fine-bubbled - oily, and smooth. Great.  Drinkability: Confounding variables here - was the 2007 batch better, or has aging done wonders for this beer? Maybe a little of both, but I can't really be sure, so I won't change my review too much. Either way, let this one age - it's absolutely wonderful.  ***  Purchased at Wine Warehouse on Hydraulic Road in Charlottesville, 2008 edition, poured into a tulip glass from a 12 oz bottle.  Appearance is a deep ruby brown, with a thin, creamy head which appears and then disappears just as quickly. The fine pearly lacing cascades down the sides of the glass, and the carbonation is mild but rises slowly - a thick-looking beer.  Smell is hoppy, lots of pine presence, with a definite note of alcohol. Some fruity esters are present, but hops definitely dominate here.  Taste is, again, incredibly hoppy. Citrus and pine hop notes are up front, but they mingle over a strong caramel malt backbone. Fruity notes are of course also present (grapefruit, orange), and alcohol is also there, but these are largely covered up by the bitter hops.  Mouthfeel is mild, creamy, but not too heavy. You can feel the alcohol more than you can taste it - the familiar prickly sensation is definitely present. Very nice balance though.  Drinkability is good, with the formidable alcohol taste largely offset by the piney hops. This makes it somewhat deceptively boozy, but also more drinkable. It also doesn't have the cloying sweetness of a lot of high abv beers/barleywines. However, the sheer strength of this beer in all departments - it is a BIG beer - cautions against too many.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Gehrig,4.53,"Wandering into the great Neil St. Piccadilly, I saw Bigfoot's ominous presence looming for the first time in quite some time, and was compelled to grab one. Good move, for Bigfoot is an amazing beer. One and one-half fingers of slightly tan froth top a gorgeous reddish-copper body, with rings of dense lacing ringing the Ommegang glass--a picture of magnificence. Hops and fruit dominate the smell in unmistakable abundance.  As with many other (good) barleywines, Bigfoot is endemic of the style's veering into DIPA and strong ale. The hops in Bigfoot could easily allow this to pass as a DIPA, but the equally heavy malt complicates this beer, making it a very good barleywine that is strong but smooth on texture. Although bitter in its finish, this is complex enough to offer one more than good, hopped bitterness. Caramel adds much to this gem, adding hints of a sweet cake taste to offset the hopped bitterness.  Bigfoot is nothing short of outstanding, a great, big, beefy beer that will impress lovers of DIPA, barleywine, and just plan good strong beer alike.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Minor, light tan head develops but quickly disappears. Lacing is light but nice. Color seems almost purple and wine-like.  S - Huge pine and citrus hop flavor that is very clean yet oily. Hops dominate but a bit of malty sweetness is detected. Grapefruit and maybe some pineapple. Enticing and not too sweet like some barleywines. A slightly oaked alcoholic scent develops as the beer warms.  T - Starts slightly sweet with some dark fruit flavor and tartness. Hops hit almost immediately with an oily, piney and citrusy flavor. Alcohol is present but well disguised amongst the hops and malt. Slightly nutty malt flavor.  M - Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Slightly sticky on the tongue with an intense bitter/drying aftertaste. Not too thick or oily.  D - Hop-heavy, almost to a fault. I was a expecting a bit more balance, but that's what aging is for.

I'm updating the stats as this is consistently one of my favorite beers to draw for...the pour, the scent, the sweet malt, the sublime hop profile, the brown sugar/molasses/honey sweetness, etc. This is one of the greatest beers in the world. An American classic in exact opposition to everything the globe assumes about American beer.  ---  2008 edition  Pours a bright crimson from the 12oz bottle, decent head retention and laces to the side of the glass. Smells brightly of hops & malt; I'm getting tangy fruit & flowery lavender scents. Tastes spicy & hoppy, with maltiness coming through at the end. Fairly sweet to balance the bitterness; I'm getting a little honey & molasses/brown-sugar flavor in there, as well as some fruit...apples or berries, perhaps. Cirtus, more orange than grapefruit or lemon, reveals itself at the end. Mouthful is consistent...there is enough complexity to keep it interesting and vibrant between sips. Certainly drinkable, especially for hop-lovers. A brew well-balanced enough I barely noticed the high ABV. One of the best SN products I've tasted thus far.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,robg2251,4.36,"The beer pours a beautiful deep amber color with barely any head, more of a fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a sweet malt smell with a big alcohol essence. A hop smell comes through, which might be the fruit I'm smelling. A very crisp malty mouth feel that finishes with a nice sweet bite. Light carbonation with a good full body, but very drinkable. This beer has a good carmel malt, sweet flavor up front with a big hop finish. A definite piney taste and the hops come through as a tart grapefruit taste. Overall, this is pretty amazing. I've only had a handful of barleywines, so I can't compare it to others, but this is definitely my favorite so far. It's definitely a sipping beer. As you sip, you can feel the warming sensation of this beer going down. I love the balance between the malt and hops, and the strong alcohol bite at the end isn't overpowering. I remember having a couple of the 2007 version of this last year, and let me tell you, they sneak up on ya. An amazing beer, good work SN.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,bierSnob,5,"They did it again ... Sierra Nevada banged out a great 25th anniversary BIGFOOT. The 2008 batch if fine.  I enjoy big beers. But this beer is HANDS DOWN THE BEST BARLYWINE out there. Hoppy palate, and a balanced malty tase that somehow masks the high alcohol content. I think I was especially anxious to get my case this year and was not dissapointed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Philabeerphia,4.7,"1999 vintage on tap at Monks! So lucky to stumble on this, which has been stored in their basement for 9yrs apparently. I know the vintage doesn't necessarily translate, but... Poured into a tulip. Appearance was opaque coppery reddish brown with a creamy 2finger crandberry off-white head that quickly settled. not much lacing, everything is creamy and wants to settle back in the glass. S: Tart and sweet, acidic and alcoholy. Sweet malts, dulce de leche candy. T: my goodness. the very first sensation on the tongue is tart, sour. quickly turns to deep woody malt. Sweetens up quite a bit in the middle - all about the malt as described on the beer list - buttressed by plenty of dried fruit, apricots and prunes, mixed with caramel candy, floral, but pinned down. Vaporous & breathy alcohol apparent throughout without being cloying. Swirling in the mouth brings out the sourness (sour red ale), still pinned down and going many complex directions. At this point I was hit with the realization that I was tasting something unbelievable. The tartness told me that this beer was pushing some limit, aged to the point that it had become a totally different beast. I'm elated. The Aftertaste is woody and tart. As this warmed a bit, it just became all the more pronounced and complex. MF: creamy, milky forgiving. The ultimate mouthfeel for this style and probably for any beer D: no pints? I need to run errands tonight? How did I leave this at one glass? I could have an adventure all night with this one. Thanks Monk's!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,biggmike,4.35,This poured a reddish-brown color that was attractive with little head that dissipated pretty quickly. The aroma is fruity hoppiness. The flavor is a beautiful balance of maltiness and hoppiness. This is an extremely smooth drinker that I can't believe is 9.6% abv. Drinkability is great for a barleywine,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,timbro81,4.42,"Pours a deep reddish brown topped with a small dense head that fades quickly. Smells wonderful, high alpha acid floral hops, booze, and a hint of caramel malts. Greeted with that wonderful hoppy goodness right away accompanied by some booziness. In the end there is a noticable amount of biscuit/ caramel malt. Aftertaste is boozey with a nice warming sensation. Really well balanced considering what it is. I enjoyed this one more than the 07' (not that it was bad by any means!) I think this one will benefit alot with some age on it. My only gripe besides the weak head is that I miss the campfire scene underneath the bottlecap, it is so charming.  2007 Bigfoot after 1 year in the cellar: A=4 S=4 T=4.5 M=4 D=4.5 Pours a nice hazy amber/orange with a decent off white head that lingers around for a while. Smells much less hoppy than when it was fresh, much more malt-forward with some hops on the back burner, little to no alcohol presence discernable. Taste is awesome! Very complex and balanced. Malty upfront that transitions to a toasted malty caramel goodness. Ends with nice hops and some alcohol heat that says, ""I'm still here!"" A little more viscous in the mouth than than I remembered.

140,2671,riboflavin88,4.13,"2008 batch: Poured this one in a brandy snifter, which highlighted its beautiful deep brownish-red color. It poured with a nice ivory head with thin lacing all the way down. The alcohol was definitely present in its nose along with aromas of plum and pine. Taste is sweetness up front with moderate malt flavor, and then its high alcohol sneaks up at the end providing a nice warming sensation on its way down.

140,2671,tapman,3.85,"Dark amber, brown/red. Head is a medium eggshell that starts 3/4 finger to 1 1/2 finger. Head retention looks excellent as it took so long to escape is what did it for me.  Hops smell grassy, earthy, sweet fresh paprika, floral, and spicy. Malts smell sweet and caramel, so I'm guessing lots of caramel malts with some dark crystal to round'em out. No alcohol is present and the smell is so sweet, unlike many barleywines that I have tried.  Grass and lemon seeds hit me right away. Alcohol is close behind. As it warms the sweet caramel comes out and the hops mellow a bit. Stronger than I anticipated, from the nose, by a lot. Astringent roasted barley taste, though i wouldn't guess it by the looks of it. Then again, I suppose it could be...  Mouthfeel is full on the palate and tingly at the tongue tip. A little syrupy for me, but for the style it does all right.  I dig a good barleywine, and this one is fine, but an overpowering hop presence, though seeming to contain a bevy of different varieties, which is sweet that S. N. would use lots of hops to create a beer like this at a time when it would not be economically viable, but its a little spicy for my taste. Generally, I relay on a sweeter malt character to mask the alcohol, but not with this one. It's interesting enough.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Body is topped with a frothy white head only one to two fingers thick.  Smell is full of sweet hops, citrus, and malty goodness.  Taste has a good malty front with a balanced heavy hop pop when it rolls off the back of the tongue. Real strong bittering from the hops but a good balance with all the malt all around. The alcohol is embellished nicely within the whole taste.  Mouthfeel couldn't be heavier.

140,2671,chefboy812,4.23,"poured glowing clear dark red with some copper. nice cremmy tan head that hangs for a bit and leaves huge lacing.  aroma is quite mild with a little alcohol and raisen with some malt.  The sip makes up for the smell, but I do have a bit of a sinus thing today. so I will not take off too much for the smell.  Huge malt chew witha big alcohol smack then they send in the boat loads of hops. the malt is very molassas and maple syrup with caramel, and coffee roast adding some nice bittering dryness. then the hops come in as grapefruit pith and pine resin(christmas fir) huge dry bitter linger.  chewy and sugary with the alcohol heat  a great barleywine, I hold in eaquil reguards with Hog Heavin, My favorite.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

S - WOW, hops and malt were perfectly balanced. Piney character in the malt.  T - Sharp and mellow at the same time. Malt up front with a very hoppy finish.

A bit of caramel as well, alcohol is noticable but not overpowering. Tastes is strongly hops but there is a nice malty balance. It seems a though there is a citrus presence as well.

140,2671,beerthulhu,4.2,"A: Poured a dark coppery-auburn from the bottle, while in the glass appeared a deep crimson red when held to the light with a swirling haze of micro turbid matter. The capping was solid and firm, a respectable 2 fingers high, and light beige in color while leaving a sticky broken collar for a lacing. The carbonation appeared random with sparsely separated micro-bubbles rising at a steady pace. The head was extraordinary when it came to both size and retention per style.  S: The nose was beautiful and strong with fresh pine and a light flowery sense of citrus backed by a sweet residual malting. Underneath lied a toasted dry munich touch. Again a nice level of aromatic exposure especially per style.  T: The residual sweetness comes through initially though is quick to be countered by a equally balanced show of bitterness composed of citrus and pine giving this an warm wintery appeal. A dry warmth of alcohol and pine come through along with a show of dry toasted malts, perhaps munich, that soon moves in delivering a dry and slightly boozy touch. The beer rounds out with a dry pine booziness that lingers quite a bit giving you a warm wintery sense of standing in a forest of evergreen trees in the still of winter. A beautifully warming balance of malts and hops that is brought about more so drunk at the proper temperature.  M: A near full body experience of maltiness that was creamy and thick but eloquently smooth. The carbonation provides just enough of a tingle to make its presence known and appreciable without distracting from the luscious full maltiness.  D: A very nice dry toasted and piney boozy barley wine which is further heightened by drinking it at its proper temperature. I consumed this at 65F which brought about a weatlth of warmth of pine juice and dry toasted appeal that warmed me up after a long day of shoveling snow. Even at room temperature the 9.6%abv was well manageable and easy enough to handle and enjoy another one.

Head is 3 fingers thick, creamy, and offwhite to light tan. Great lacing all the way down the glass.  Smell: Hops dominate the aroma... big piney, citrusy hops to be exact. There seems to be little attempt to balance the hops out in the nose, but there is a subtle pale malt character somewhere in there.  Taste: Wow... superbly (and surprisingly) balanced, starting out with a big, smooth maltiness that was unexpected and seemed to come out of nowhere.

On closer inspection there appears to be a fine sediment suspended in the beer.  Crisp, fresh hops dominate the nose. Lightly accented with fruit and pepper.  This is an aggressively hopped barleywine. They exhibit a vapory, perhaps numbing sensation to the taste buds like a Halls lozenge. An underlying sweetness and a husky grain character are nearly obscured by all the bitter, piney hop action. Smooth and creamy in the mouth, and warming on the way down. Lingering trace of hop, of course.  This must be a good one if they've been releasing it for 25 years.

One of the most attractive beers I've ever seen. I'm turned on now.  The aroma is MAGNIFICENT. It smells exactly like fresh Cascade hops. The smell takes me back to brewing with my friend and my brother.  This is one of the hoppiest beers I've ever tasted, and I drink hoppy beers all the time. I've had Bigfoot before, but I guess I never had it this fresh. I would second the notion that it almost tastes more like a DIPA than a barleywine. Intensely bitter, but juicy and citrusy to make the bitterness palatable. A bit of a woody, earthy tinge too.  Medium carbonation, definite alcohol heat (but, that's to be expected). It's obviously gonna be a slow sipper, but I'll enjoy every slow sip. Can't wait to try it next to some '07 Bigfoot.  If you like hops, drink it now.

It pours a beautiful copper/ruby/red. excellent color with some hairy white head that disapates into lacing.  Smells of cherry, sweet malts, I dont really smell the hops. But the musk smell of sasquatch make me want more.  Excellent mellow taste, some alcohol, dark fruits, hops up front that fade into sweet malty goodness.  Nice finish, a little hot, this one will age b-u-t-fully.  2007 Version  When you pour this beer you can smell it. Nice.  Pours a beautiful mahogony color, not much of a head.  Smells of sweet malts, dried fruits, toffee. Excellence.  Tastes amazing. This will continue to get better. Tastes like a really good powdered chocolate donut.  Lingering good aftertaste.

Smell is hoppy moreso than malty by far with almost a minty fresh alcohol presence. Some graininess as well. Hoppy beginning with a sharp hop bitterness in the form of dry aspirin like medicinal bitterness. Some cherry cough drop like flavor along as well, but mildly so. I definitely prefer the 1 year aged version of this to fresh as it was more balanced, although still a hoppy barley wine, and more rounded overall, but still not one of my favorite barley wines by far.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,barronkr,4.25,"25th Expedition -- reviewed same year.  Pours a deep amber, copper red. Nice lacey head that quickly dissipates presumably due to the ABV.  Smell is overwhelmingly C hopped. Piney, resinous, faint hint of citrus -- definitively Sierra Nevada. A slight sweetness from the malt barely carries through.  Hoppy. The first taste is a rush of thick, sweet, resinous, all-American hoppy goodness fading to a nice bitter aftertaste that persists for a while. The malt easily balances the bitterness, first sweet and bready followed by an unexpected dry finish that lingers with the residual bitterness. As the beer warms the dryness becomes more evident, nicely contrasting the initial sweetness. The bitterness really does build in this beer, a quality that may decrease with aging -- who knows I'm not that patient.  The mouthfeel is thick, but not overly so, again nicely complemented by the clean dryness that becomes progressively evident.  Overall an EXCELLENT Barleywine, different in many ways from the malt-forward offerings of other companies. As a hophead I thoroughly enjoyed this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Good looking copper beer with a nice JUST off white 1 finger head that sticks well, and laces better. Aroma is a very nice strong fruity and spicy hops, quite a bit of promise here, reminds me of something from when I was a child I just can't place it. Taste, Ouch nice flash of hops and fruits, but before they even make much of an appearance the alchohol burn just won't go away. I was guessing this beer to be around 12%, but then I come here to see it is only 9.6% with that kind of burn, this is poor craftsmanship IMHO. Mouthfeel is burning overly carbonated and thin.

140,2671,NCBeernut,4.48,"Deep mahogany glow is gorgeous. Off white, bone colored, one finger head. Creamy looking at first, then more bubbly as it settles to a thin layer, leaving tons of lacing. This is a GREAT looking beer.  Smell is hop-dominant for sure, yet more complex than an in a IPA/DIPA; very floral and earthy. Apples and sweet raisin maltiness. Spicy.  Spicy, bitter, pine, earthy, woody hops, with a fruity touch (raisin and faint apple) and cannabis. The malt character blends in, and isn't immediately noticeable. Alcohol is a bit hot when very fresh but begins to mellow in just a few months. This is a BIG, bitter beer, and delicious if you are ready for it. It bites, but leaves you satisfied. This will mellow out nicely with some age though. A defining American Barleywine.  I went out and bought more after the first bottle.  2007 Vintage (Reviewed Aug 2008)  Not much sound when I opened the bottle, but there is still decent carbonation. Not much head formation - maybe half to a full finger, dissolving away to nothing in a couple minutes. Same color of course, but very opaque and cloudy. Aroma is full of dark fruits and still very earthy. Hops have dropped off a little bit causing a much sweeter aroma. Man the insane hoppiness of the fresh version has started to tame, but there is still plenty to go around. Defintely more balanced though. Not a whole lot of difference yet, but I can begin to see where the aging process might take this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Bubba83,4.04,"2008 edition purchased in a six pack from Whole Foods in Cupertino, CA. Poured into a Samuel Adams tumbler at around 50 degrees.  Appearance - A nice deep amber/ruby hue with a surprisingly clean bright white head. 3 fingers of head after a semi-vigorous pour.  Smell - Perhaps the most impressive aroma of any beer I've had to date. I smell strong caramel, highlights of citrus and pine, and faint alcohol in the background.  Taste - Jesus! Is this a DIPA or a Barleywine? I have to be careful not to swish it to the back of my tongue or all I get is bitterness. Hops are mostly of a spicy character, with a little pine mixed in. The malt flavor may be hard to get to, but it's there and actually quite nice. The hops are pretty killer up front but almost cloyingly bitter on the swallow. It really is almost more of a DIPA right now though, will have to see how this one is a couple years down the line.  Mouthfeel - It's nice. It could be a little more syrupy for a smoother feel but overall it's good.  Drinkability - The alcohol presence is never really known in the taste, probably because it is well hidden from the extremely hoppy presence right now. As long as you don't let it sit on the back of your tongue very long the drinkability doesn't suffer too much from the high bitterness.  Overall - If this was a DIPA, I might be giving it a 4.5, but it's a barleywine, so where's the barley? A little out of balance, but good nonetheless and should improve down the road.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,jamie2dope,1.82,"From what I understand, this years vintage has received a large amount of criticism and praise at the same time. Lets see how it turns out. Poured in to my Westmalle chalice a nice looking cherry color. Besides the color, it looks slightly dull, with not much head save for a tiny ring around the glass. Aroma is a slight improvement, with some great berry and cream characters backed by a heavy perfume of booze. Taste begins with a huge assault of hops, a bit of juicy dark fruit, then leaves on an intensely bitter note that reminds me of cheap tobacco. Aftertaste is rather unpleasant. Reminds me of the taste in my mouth after a harsh night of drinking mixed with bad cigarettes. Mouthfeel is heavy on the palate, and drinkability is lessened quite a bit by the rough aftertaste. Quite a disappointment in my book, as other years of this brew have been very enjoyable. I suspected maybe I had a poor bottle, but found the same flaws present in the second bottle I cracked open. I don't think I will be drinking the rest of my six pack at this point, so maybe I will lay a few down to see if they mature well. Simply a mess of a beer IMO.

140,2671,jeonseh,4.03,"Poured the 2008 into my crystal snifter.  A - Color is a dark ruby which has the notes of both plum and also there is a light orange glow that seems to emanate from the bottom. The head poured big and then dissolved into a nice, thin layer of bubbly carbonation that sat right on top of the beer. Left some nice lacing as well.  S - the biggest smell that initially hits me is a ton of hops, which go smell like the normal piney hops that SN loves so much. also gets some sweeter fruit flavors that all seem to mix together such as candied dates, plums and even a bit of mango. There is also a big whiff of alcohol that hits the nose and seems a bit much given the ABV of this one.  T - hmm now the taste was much milder than the nose would make me think it was. first the most overpowering taste that first came over me was a sweet, almost maple syrupy, malt flavor that slowly sweep in on you. There is also a bit of the candied dates in there. As the beer warms up to near room temp, the sweeter malts and fruits flavors seem to becoming even more prevalent. Only after taking most of the sip do the hops and their contrasting bitterness come in to balance out the sweetness. After these two flavors hit you, the aftertaste is actually a very light hops presence that just hangs around for a while. I was surprised by how light the hops presence actually was.  MF - has a nice body for a BW as it is thick without being syrupy thick. i felt as if the body actually made the beer have the sweeter malt flavors dominate first instead of the hops. Idk if this is true or I'm crazy but i think if this beer was highly carbonated, the hops would hit ya hard and it would be more like a DIPA than a BW.  D - overall a very drinkable BW. This is one that doesn't really force you to slow down and enjoy it because it is not overly thick and sticky in the mouth. This is good and solid and an interesting twist given the hops presence that we always expect from SN.

Very strong floral hop aroma is a little soapy at first blush but otherwise very powerful and pleasant.  Deep hop backbone - more like a DIPA than a barley wine in a way. Malt and alcohol are in the background. Very very hoppy for a BW but well-balanced.  After a while the malt opens up nicely, but this is a ""pucker"" on the mouth from the big hop profile.  The extra-abundant hop presence makes this a bit for drinkable for a barley wine. Solid stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

S = Strong hops notes of grapefruit and pine, sweet grapefruit juice smells also show up with a malt undertone. Nice and complex.  T = Great bitters on the sides of the tongue and in the finish, grapefruit rinds, citrus hops are very upfront, but the malt backbone is also there with a good creamy mid-palate bread taste.  M = Medium to heavy bodied, perfect amount of foaming carbonation on swish, great mouthcoating.  D = A good drinking beer.

140,2671,udubdawg,4.21,"12 oz bottle, 2008  The pour is spectacular, vibrant, clear, and colored a sort of coppery amber, maybe slightly darker. The tan head is as sticky and creamy as marshmallow creme and leaves spectacular rings of lace over my glass as it (the head, and the level in my glass) slowly subsides. Esily a ""5"".  Nose...hmm, maybe I'm coming down with a cold...big piney hops are showcased, some earthiness, pleasant spiciness and alcohol that isn't shy. Again, maybe my nose isn't working tonite, as from experiences with previous vintages I expected more of a hops assault.  Flavor is sweet for an instant, but even before I can start to try to discern malt subtleties I am blasted by the pine and floral hops I expected earlier in the aroma. Freaking awesome! Finishes with more hops riding on the alcohol that is warming my throat but despite the fresh, oily nature of the hop profile the lingering bitterness fades sooner than I expected - I thought this one would be with me for a while with a building bitterness, but there is little to be found. This may make the beer even more dangerously drinkable for me! Body is at best medium, carbonation fine and the beer is *just* bitter enough to slow me down to an acceptable pace. It's becoming clear why I don't keep more Bigfoot around the house - unless fresh, I would drink too much of it.

140,2671,ojclark,4.3,"Strong, piney hop aroma with strong floral notes. Some alcohol and yeast in aroma as well. Poured deep amber with reddish highlights. Moderate tan head with pretty good retention and some lacing. Flavor was an excellent mix of piney hops, alcohol, and malt (especially dark crystal malts). Some brown-sugary sweetness. Flavor definitely oriented toward hops and bitterness, but fairly well-balanced overall. Aftertaste of alcohol, hop bitterness, and dark crystal maltiness. Rich mouthfeel. Medium-full bodied.

140,2671,RickSawyer,4.37,"2008 on tap @ Boondoggles. Pours a nice black coffee with a buck hide cream head. Big smells of piney hops and caramel malts. Head holds a nice line across the top and clings to the glass leaving a nice layered lace. Taste is fully sweet, rounded malty goodness almost overly balanced by big piney hops. Some hop fade overtime can only do great things for this one (IMO). Mouthfeel is a creamy, coating that lets the fresh hops linger on the tongue. I would give drinkablity a higher score if it wasn't so vigorously hopped... time will certainly help. Great beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,jokelahoma,4.57,"2006 Expedition  This one pours a tawny, hazy oragnish brown, with a rather small head that dissipates with surprising rapidity.  The aroma is big, bad, bold American northwest hops. Like sniffing a citrus fruit basket at Christmas. There is some malt in the nose, as one would expect from a 9.6% beer, but it gets lost rather easily among the forest of hop smells. There's an ever so slight whiff of alcohol in here as well, but that, too, gets buried in and among the hop aromas.  Wow, what balance in the taste! Hoppy, then malty, then bitter, then sweet, all alternating back and forth throughout the duration of the drink. Finally, the malt seems to surrender and the hops win out at the end, with a long, lingering bitterness that just won't quit. Not only does it go on and on, but it stays strong enough to make your mouth water long after you've gulped down the mouthful of beer. When it does seem to fade slightly, a quick inhale through your mouth and it all starts again. The fruity earthiness (or is it earthy fruitiness) of each drink is inviting, beggin you to take another sip. It's dangerously easy to drink this one a lot faster than the style and strength would dictate. Extremely well done, and just what I'd want a barleywine to be.  The mouthfeel is substantial, but not chewy. You don't have to work your way through this one, although you're well aware you're drinking something other than water.  Overall, this is one hell of a beer. It's big, brash, and unapologetic, yet smooth and balanced enough to make it seem acceptable in any setting, on any occasion. Simply and utterly fantastic. Bigfoot is good every year, and the 2006 is no exception. Time's running out to find any before it's gone forever, but I'd strongly recommend trying. Well worth any trouble it takes.  ***  Edit for the 2008 Expedition  2008 Expedition  Poured into a wide bowl glass. Pours a nice deep amber with minimal head. Head does lace well all the way down the glass. Crystal clear. Beautiful.  Smells of hops right off the bat. Big hops. Lots of 'em, too! Hiding underneath those hops is a subtle woody aroma, with a good dark fruit scent as well. The slightest hint of metal creeps in, but so minor you have to convince yourself that's what you're smelling.  Remember the hops in the nose? The big hops and lots of them? Well they're right up front in the flavor as well. A tiny little bit of malt sweetness hits for about half a second, the BOOM! Hops! Quite bracingly bitter, with the floral flavor right on the heels of that bitterness. They don't let up, either. You get the hop flavor all the way through this one, beginning to end. I'm sure there are nice malt flavors in here, but for the time being they're in hiding, apparently afraid the hops will give them a wedgie and take their lunch money. This is aggressive, but not bad. Obviously it's a new brew, and it's designed hop-forward so the beer will balance out as it is laid down and aged, but to my taste, it's drinkable now, albeit aggressive, as I stated. This will be phenomenal in a year or two, if you can set a few back. Good now, great later -- the barleywine credo.  The mouthfeel is surprisingly light for a beer of this heft. Not watery by any means, but you don't have to work at drinking this (other than to get past the hops, that is).  Yes, this one is currently a bit out of balance. It's hoppy as helland unapologetic about it. Considering this really isn't meant to be consumed now, it's hard to fault the beer for that, especially considering how drinkable it is even this far to the hoppy side of balanced. Grab a few, drink one now to measure, the cellar the rest. This one is going to get nothing but better.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,jdoncbus,4.2,"Pours a ruby-brown hue, when put up to a lamp it reveals some fine sediment floating to and fro. Low carbonation leads to a smallish, thumb-sized head that laces together some impressive rings as each sip completes.  A woody aroma opens up to a toasty-fruitiness. The smell also reveals sourdough, french roast coffee. A tad boozy but nothing over the top.  Oily on the tounge, the taste is smoke-woody, with a heavily toasted malt. The palate is next touched with a firm hopiness; plums, raisens, pepper. The mouth is left dry and smokey. When served at a higher temperature it reveals more alcohol.  One heck of a sipping beer and an outstanding winter companion. I will certainly age a couple of these and see what happens.

140,2671,boston2bburg,4.52,"Found a 2008 and 2006 version at local beer stores today so figured I'd try them both.  2006: Pours over a finger of creamy tan head with a deep dark brownish red body. Head winds up as a thin layer, not covering the glass. Trace amounts of lacing on the sides of my snifter.  Wow what a thick aroma. Caramel and chocolate blended well with earthy, woody hops. Butterscotch also pulls through.  Taste is of sweet caramel and butter with citrus hops at the back of the throat on the finish. Hops have obviously mellowed with age. Alcohol certainly hasn't, and gives my nasal passage a nice cleansing with each sip.  Very smooth, chewy, silky mouthfeel. Very drinkable for a barleywine. Now on to the '08.  2008: Label has a brief description of the beer and mentions the ""25th Expedition"" of Bigfoot Barelywine. Also shows Bigfoot sitting around with two woodsmen sharing a brew. Nice. Twist-off replaced with a pop-off as with their other beers.  Color is very similar to 06 but pours with more head and lacing. Wow! Smell is almost all hops with this one, nothing like the 06. Clean fruit and flowers.  Smell translates to the taste, with more citrus hop bitterness up front but still very pleasant. It's hard to review such different beers at once, but I'll take the best qualities of each.  Mouthfeel is still very silky, maybe a bit thinner than the 06. Alcohol not quite as noticable but maybe I'm getting used to it.  Very impressive and easily the best Sierra Nevada has to offer. Also very reasonably priced, but I wish they'd produce some 22 oz. bombers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Fades fairly quickly, but leaves a nice bubbly covering across the brew with streaky lacing all around. Streaks of small bubbles persistently seek escape from the bottom of the snifter. Smells of piny, earthy, bitter hops. BIG time. Some faint esters are hiding out behind everything else. Tastes of bitter hops surrounded by a definite presence of alcohol. Underneath is an obscured sweetness. Mouth-feel is medium-bodied and dry. Not as creamy and rounded as other b-wines I've tried, which might be attributed to it's newness.

140,2671,deapokid,4.23,"A subtle and complex barleywine from a company that continues to amaze me.  Pouring a rich amber reminiscent of freshly stained wood, the Bigfoot spatters the glass with elegant lace and a bubbly complexion.  Upon first scent, it stinks of IPA with an apricot chaser, differentiating itself from the traditional strength of the breed, while still giving off a bouquet of fruity scents.  As for taste, the ""quiet is the new loud"" motif continues, with the flavors of citrus fruit and the warmth of a high ABV ever present. This is a pleasant surprise, since barleywines often strive for strength over taste (Blithering Idiot is the perfect example), leaving the Bigfoot in a league of its own as a soft and flavorful ale that has a ""big stick,"" but is too confident to have to obnoxiously show it off.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Smell is of bitter hops, rich sweet malts, some light pine scents and caramelized fruits. There is also a light alcohol twinge that tickles your nose.  The taste is an assault on the tongue. The sweet malts are fighting it out with the bitter hops while the pine and fruitiness duke it out in the background. The winner of this royal rumble is hands down the sharp hops.

140,2671,gpcollen1,4.35,"My review consists of side by side 07 and the freshly arrived 08. I thought this may be a good way to arrive at a reasonable score/review. Both poured into my Sam Adams glasses - gorgeous dark orange amber in color with an off-white creamy head.  Aroma on the 07 is very syrup sweet with just the background hops, as opposed to the 08, which give the nose a sweet burst of hops with now deep sweetness to discover.  Head rises a bit on both but does not get in the way of the pour. The 07 hits the palate very caramelly sweet that gradually gives way to a strong drying bitterness that clings to the roof of my mouth. The 08 hits with a whispy sweetness that is carried away with a wave of bitter hops, and rides back in seemingly coating that hoppy bitterness with a shroud of sweetness.  Both are well carbonated, though the 07 seems to just hold a bit less as the glass sits. These are both not thin beers - probably just right with a bit of body to hold these up - slightly creamy in some ways as those mouth drying hops often make it seem. Cottonmouth for sure...  This was fun. My first 07 of this new season seemed underwhelming but my research carried on and worked out for the better as it seems my taste buds must have been off last month when I tried it. If you want something brash and hoppy, the 08 is definitely a drinker now. If you want something sweeter where the hops are discernible from the malty sweetness, age is the key.

Taste is delicious and unrelenting. Thick mouthfeel with a slick backing. Tasty massive hops with tangy citric pine backing. Malts are there, but don't present themselves much. Overall, a raw and herbacously hoppy concoction with a slick and drinkable mouthfeel.  A solid beer, but seems to be lacking something. Not as good as last years. Still pretty tasty though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The mouthfell is nice and medium-bodied. While drinking, this appeared to be two different beers. The initial smell was a lot of bright hops, with some caramel sweetness and a bit of alcohol. The taste had similar elements with quite a bit of bitterness lingering after the initial sweet malt flavor.  I drank this beer over the course of about 45 minutes and, after it warmed up, the alcohol took over the nose and the taste. All I could get was alcohol, which really turned me off.  I had the 2007 expeditiion last year and really enjoyed it. I don't remember the alcohol being as noticable in that one. I think I'm going to put away four of the 2008 bottles and try them over the next few years to see it the alcohol calms down and the flavor improves.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

T - This is unbeleivably delicious. I like it a whole whole lot. A big hoppy flavor with a huge malt backbone to support it. To me it tastes like a blend of a barleywine and a double IPA.

The taste lingers for a long time, but not much else comes through for a fresh bottle. D: Big, viscous and inky. This is one tough beer to sip on.

140,2671,cswhitehorse,4.5,The Bigfoot Barleywine poured a semi hazy red with brown hints. It had some money lacing with a small foam head.  The aroma was fruity and of sugar. I could smell the caramel.  It was malty in the taste with a noticeable hop flower to it. I didn't get much of an alcohol taste even though it was 9.6 abv. In the mouth it was light to the touch and danced on my tongue. Overall this is one of my favorite Barleywines to date.

A rather mediocre, short, slightly off-white head that was pretty short-lived.  S: Some sweet-edged malts, followed up with quite assertive hops (it manages to stay pretty clear of becoming 'aggressive' through some sort of laid back, in control of itself attitude). A little floral... *almost* fruity, but not quite.  T: Fat, pungent hops. Bitter, but not in the same arrogant, piney or citrus flavour route that some others take. Maybe scratch ""not arrogant."" This has attitude and isn't afraid to show it.  M: Quite thick and full... a touch heavy to balance out the big flavour.  D: Take it slow & easy... sip, share one, savour.

Bittersweet caramel malt and resiny hop bitterness. Hop flavors are of pine, hash pipe resin, cat piss (in a good way). Somewhat astringent bitterness backed up by a big crystal malt carmel sweetness.  Hop bitterness is tingly on the tongue and gums but the malt backing smoothes it out. Alcoholic strength becomes evident after a pint but is not hot or particulary noticeable in flavor or mouthfeel.  Very drinkable for a young barleywine - well balanced, but lacking the complexity of aged barelywines. A very good conservative, non-extreme American Style barleywine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Morey,3.91,"This is a 2008....Poured a deep redddish-brown and produced a healthy head of 3/4 of an inch. Faint smells of alcohol, hops, and bready malts in the nose. The malts were the first to hit the palate, and then the hops come in and finish this one off with a sharp bitter bite that lingers just long enough.  Morey's Bottom Line: Somewhat similar in taste to Old Horizontal, but with more of a hoppy taste. Very satisfying barleywine to say the least. I have a few in the basement for next year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Overlord,4.3,"Another uber-hopped Barlywine, this one even outshines the 2008 Stone Old Guardian.  Pours a clear dark amber/orange. Nice carbonation. Good chewy mouthfeel.  Smell is overwhelmingly piney and hoppy. Taste is similar. Little to no sweet fruit content, just a bit of balancing malt. I'm not saying this is a bad beer, in fact it's a pretty good one.

140,2671,Patrick999,4.43,"A - Pours into my snifter that definitive American Barleywine amber-brown. Not much sediment if any - is this not bottle-conditioned? Thick and long-lasting head for a b-wine. Some lacing and a thin coating hangs around.  S - It smells plenty hoppy. along with some caramel-like whisky. A little acetone, smells a tad hot. Nose not lacking, though, that's for sure.  T - Alcohol doesn't seem to be quite as present as in the smell. Big bitter hit of Cascades, nicely balanced by thick, sweet malt. Nothing too outlandish, just a great drinker.  F - Has that thick hop-oily feel I recognize from many Imperial IPAs. Full bodied, but not quite as thick and syrupy as many other barleywines.  D - For a barleywine, this is great drinking, not just sipping. I could conceivably have a couple of these. I couldn't do that with an Old Ruffian, Olde School, or too many other barleywines, no way.  25 years....it's yet another style definitive for Sierra Nevada. I'm not sure it's my absolute favorite barleywine, but it's up there. Factor in the ridiculously low price for a 6-pack, and you see why Bigfoot is such an anticipated beer. Here we reap the benefits of Sierra Nevada being a ""bigger"" craft brewer and thus enjoying greater economies of scale; few others give us this kind of value.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Smell- Very warm smell from the alcohol, hints of caramel and other syrupy things.  Taste- Medium sweetness, alcohol is noticeable on the palate but not over powering. Very smooth taste, very syrpuy, reminds me of slightly diluted maple syrup.  Mouthfeel- Excellent palate coverage, really covers the entire tongue.

140,2671,katan,3.69,"Second SN review of the night.  Bigfoot 12 oz bottle, 2008  A - Pours a dark golden amber color. Looks thick, although there is no haze. The head is about a cm high, and is well retained.  S - Very weak smell - not much there. I smell maybe a little bit of specialized malts in there. Surprisingly missing.  T - Ahhh the big beer - oh how I miss thee. This thing rolls with malts on the tongue. Nice and sweet - its dominant Finishes with a similar earthy hops flavor similar to the celebration I just had. I must admit however that I thought there would be more maltyness to this style of ale.  M - Very very thick. The carbonation also sticks with you. This thing sits on you hard.  D - As far as drinkability - I can't drink these fast. For some reason, that can be a good thing for me. So I'd say all and all its moderate.

A- This beer pours a deep reddish-brown color with a thick off-white head that sticks around and leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Very pretty to look at.  S- Very boozy. The strong, resiny hop aroma is piney and citrusy with some malt sweetness behind it. There are aromas of dark fruits, toffee, and burnt caramel.  T- A big hop punch gives way to some sweet and fruity malts, with toffee and caramel flavors on the finish. The bitterness kicks in on the back of the tongue and lingers there long after each sip. Really complex and delicious.  M- Velvety smooth. The perfect amount of carbonation for the style. This coats the inside of the mouth. Awesome.  D- The high ABV prevents this from being sessionable, but other than that, this goes down very easy.  This doesn't have the same tobacco juice bitterness as the '07 edition, but this year's offering is incredibly mellow and smooth. Highly recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Nice earthy hop aroma with hints of fruit and maltyness underneath. The taste is bold. Malted barely with layers of fruit underneath an earthy hop flavor that balances the beer out very well. The mouthfeel is good. Very crisp and complex with a dry finish. The drinkability is OK because of its intense flavor.

140,2671,ChrisBuster,1.9,"07' Bigfoot  So I think I must have stumbled on a bottle that had somehow soured in one way or another. The color was excellent however a nice amber red, bright yet opaque. But a very small head that dissipated in an instant. Smell was hard to explain yet very pleasing...everything else was just bad. Strong alcohol taste that gave me no room to even really taste anything else...in all honesty tasted like cheep booze to me.

140,2671,kleffman,4.13,"My first bottle of the 2008 batch, poured into a Stone Old Guardian tulip.  Pours a rather dark amber with quite a bit of red when held to the light and extremely clear. About a two finger head with wonderful retention and lacing.  Smell is very hoppy, west coast style. Smells of sweet malt too, like a thick already converted mash.  Taste is a fantastic blend of west coast style hops, sweet malt and biscuit flavors with a nice alcohol bite. No fusels, clean and well balanced. Caramel and toffee with maybe a bit of a floral character but it's definitely massively hoppy.  The mouthfeel on this is very full bodied. Almost syrupy but it's creamy smooth at the same time and is a real delight.  I went a little lower on the drinkability because I would probably only have one of these, as it's a big wonderful sipping beer. I'm content with the same 12 oz pour from half an hour ago, because the flavors linger very well on your tastebuds.  Always look forward to this seasonal offering. I missed out on it last year as I was out of commission so this year is even more exciting.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,elmore,4.28,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. Dark amber with a half-finger, off-white head that receded into a ring and left moderate lace.  Fragrant, piney hops with some malt sweetness and alcohol.  Bitter hops predominate. I haven't had a Barleywine in a while and this is bitter, very bitter. Strong, piney, grapefruit hops prescence. A good malt backbone holds it together. Carmelized malt, toffee, brown sugar sweetness. Alcohol is not that detectable - I think it is masked by the bitterness, but there is a definite warming sensation in the mouth and throat.  Viscous, chewy texture from the malt with an oily slickness imparted by the hops. I enjoy the bitterness of this beer, but it makes it a slow sipper for me.

Head dissipates to a nice collar with a thin film in the middle.  S: Hops. Smells like their pale ale but a bit more. There are some caramelly malts behind the hops but there are so many hops notes the caramel music gets drowned out.  T: Awesome hops, but almost a bit too bitter. Its been a time since I've had a hoppy beer. This beer is fucking hoppy as all get out. Some malts in there but the hop bite and bitterness kinda takes the whole shebang. Ends biter bitter. Not really like any barley wine style that I've had.  M: Nice creamy and bubbly. Bitter back of the tongue feel.  D: Maybe a bit too bitter for me today, but i usually really love hoppy brews.

S: Thick brunt of hop character, very piney.  T: At the first taste, you can feel it's more subdued in character than the '07 fresh, which I truly enjoyed, the maltiness comes out in a toasted biscuit and caramel/toffee character, but later on I felt the hops had regained their stronghold, a thick, resin filled pine came through, even at it's power, I felt it complemented the malt perfectly, it didn't go crazy into an unappetizing bitterness, like many ABA's can do. Restrained at times, but still a hop bomb, absolutely delicious.  M: Thick and resiny, with a full carbonation that conveys that image to every corner of your mouth, the aftertaste will stay with you forever, if you want it to.  D: An absolutely dynamite barleywine, possibly my favourite made in America, I can't wait for the '08 to come to town, definitely Sierra Nevada's finest creation.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Head was big and rocky, like an IPA and had some nice staying power.  Big hop smell dominates the nose. Smells of pure hop oil, flowers, caramel malts, and a whiskey backbone.  Not really what I was expecting in a barleywine. Very piney, citrus flavor with a sweet maltiness. The alcohol is very present, but not overly dominant. A hop-forward barleywine.  Light and crisp, probably because of all the cascades used, with a lingering alcohol warmth.  I can't remember this beer being this hoppy; it's been about 2 years since I had it last. Not quite what you would expect from a Barleywine. I stashed a few of these away and will break them out over the next few years.

Very aggressive, which is to be expected from a beer of this caliber fresh on tap with no time to mellow out. Taste is very fruity. The hops and the malts are both in abundance, yet balance each other out, making for a flavor bomb. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy so that the flavor sticks around for a while.  Treat this beer with the respect it deserves. This is a MONSTER beer. I followed this up with another huge mythical creature, the Yeti, and was done for the night.

There is also toffee, and a little bit of citrus zest.  Medium to full bodied, chewy, sweet, with a bittersweet aftertaste, and average carbonation.

140,2671,JohnGalt1,4.28,"2007 bottle from the cellar preparing for the coming '08 release.  3finger head poured into my New Belgium goblet... perfect cascading lace.. clear deep amber with beautiful red highlites... after a while the head recedes and looks like a dollop of whipped cream atop a glass of cold black tea.  Fairly thick pine and citrus hops with deep caramel malts dominate the nose... quite a bit of fruitiness.  Hop palate rips most of the other flavors to threads.. pine is dominant, but grapefruit is definately a soldier in the fight. Malt sugars are there but are still on the backburner.. caramel and chocolate only come into play after the IBU's die down.. even then, the fruitiness and tongue slaying hops make for a very long finish.  I think of Bigfoot as the perfect body for an ABW.. thick without being cloying.. firm while still enough carbonation to keep the palate moving... very tasty for sure, but it will mellow with some time in the bottle.  The '07 still is pretty raw, I had my last '05 a couple months back, thinking it would be ready.. I was wrong.. Bigfoot can settle down for at least 3 years... I have an '02 and'03 in the cellar; but now have to score another 4 and 5 to complete a 6 year vertical.. I must do it soon... If you can help, beermail me....

The taste is lightly sweet and fruity. Red apples lead, but are quickly overtaken by a heavy sweet caramel and roasted malt backbone. A nutty and spicy bitterness rounds this one out with an alcoholic brandy warming. The mouthfeel is awesome; full and smooth, creamy with soft carbonated bubbles. A great barleywine that may hinder my plan to age my only other bottle.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

No real head to speak of, just a half moon circle that cant quite make it all the way around the snifter.  First smell is like sticking your head in a feedbag filled with hops. Theres a ton of spice in the nose.  Very BIG, and surprisingly complex. This isnt a barleywine where they just upped the alcohol, this is an almost perfect 10% abv combination of thick sweet malts, aromatic and spicy hops. The first thing that jumps out at me is the aftertaste. As complex and smooth as it is, it cant hide the peppery alcohol aftertaste. Sweet on the front of the tongue, heavy chocolate in the center, and sweet berries right before the peppery alcohol. As it warms, the chocolate turned to caramel.  The mouthfeel is very cool for a barleywine, thick and sticky from the malts.  Even though barleywine isn't a favorite style of mine, this one really hit the spot on a cold winter night, and was way more complex then I thought it could at such a high abv.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The nose is a nice balance of malt and hops, but hops are slightly more apparent in the nose. This barleywine is a great balance of malt and hops. The hops are not as powerful as I had expected(which is good b/c I am a bigger fan on english style b-wine) Great malty backbone but with hops throughout. I do feel this taste could be stronger though in general. The alcohol flavors are very well hidden. good malt in the middle but a nice hoppy bite at the end. despite that this beer goes down exceptionally smooth. Very nice thick mouthfeel and one of the most drinkable barleywines I have ever had. A great offering from sierra nevada. I compliment them on not going overboard with the hops on this one as I had expected. This will be wonderful after a few years in the cellar. awesome.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,PhiloPsych,4.45,"2011: Updated the numerical ratings above. The head is very puffy, the color is barleywine. This year I notice a few new wrinkles in the taste: more molasses, some oatmeal and some dark-roasted malt. The hops is in the background, rather subdued compared to past years. The hops profile is grassy, I'd say. As always a great beer; glad it varies from year to year.  2009: Lasting foamy head, clear red-orange color in the glass. Smell is dominated by hops. Typical resiny mouthfeel that I love in this brew. The taste might be a little less sweet than I remember from previous years--a little more skewed toward the hops, thus a little less balanced and little more one-dimensional. Though the color is barleywine, the taste is rather IPA-ish this year. Still delicious, but not as outstanding as last year's.  2008: The head rose up big and foamy and left a nice mousse lacing in the glass. The color was a beautiful deep red. The big hops are balanced wonderfully with big maltiness. I love the sticky finish of this beer! Maybe because it was fresher when I had it, I liked this a lot better than the 2007 brew--and I liked the 2007 brew a lot! This is definitely my favorite beer from Sierra Nevada, my favorite barleywine, and one of my favorite beers full stop.  2007: The color is dark amber as it pours from the bottle and a slightly hazy red-brown in the glass with very little head. The smell is very sweet and malty, but the hops is more pronounced in the taste. Very nice balance of malt and hops! The mouthfeel is slightly syrupy with low carbonation and the finish it quite sticky. This might be the best beer I have had from Sierra Nevada and is definitely one of the best barleywines I have had. It is very drinkable, too. Two or three bottles of this with a nice meal and a rich dessert would make for a great night.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,shadow1961,3.48,"Sierra Nevada's 2007 Barleywine Ale pours a big stiff head over a slightly cloudy deep amber brew. There isn't a lot of carbonation, and the nose is dominated by bright citrus/pine hop aromas. The flavor is big, round, and malty up front, with brown sugar and caramel notes, with a massive hop finish. Mouthfeel is full and would be quite sweet were it not for the massive hop additions, with sort of an astringent, medicial quality. The aftertaste is more hops, but very firm, grassy, and long lasting. In my opinion, this brew is weighted a bit more toward the hops than I like- it seems unbalanced. On the other hand, at 9.6% alcohol by volume, it should age well, in which time a lot of that hop will moderate. Young, it's a brew for the true hophead- if that's you, go for it!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ksbrainard,4.27,"Appearance: Cloudy dark orange, but brown in the middle. A thin head forms and dissipates before too long, leaving a ring around the edge where the glass meets the beer.  Smell: First whiff is a combination of plums and raisins with a hint of alcohol. There's a background of piney hops, with green apple undertones. It has that whole dark-ale-Barley-Wine malty thing going on.  Taste: This is deeply bitter, and this is accentuated by the increased alcohol. It just numbs the tongue, but in a good way. The malts also manage to stand up well to the hops. Oh wait, this is a Barley Wine. The hops are earthy and piney, and I don't get the big grapefruit I might have expected. Gotta love the unexpected. I can get caramel flavors if I focus, but the overarching concept is on awesome hopness (is that a word? - who am I kidding - no it isn't!) The alcohol flavor plays a role at first, but lets the hops take over as the show moves on to the later acts.  Mouthfeel: This has a nice, full mouthfeel. Now I am not one for a big sticky mouthfeel, so I am glad that the hops (and to a lesser extent the alcohol) dry this one out as it finishes. It sticks around a while, and reminds you of a robust IPA, but for the warmth eminating from within.  Drinkability: First impressions are good, and by the time you reach the bottom of the glass, you are just convinced that you could go for another one or two of these. It is quite a feat for a big beer like this to make you want to reach for another of the same thing, but the boys from Chico do it with this one. It also makes a fine accompaniment to Maytag Blue Cheese (or really any blue-cheese-family offering). But the Maytag's smooth creamy feel is a good balancing effort to the hugeness of the Bigfoot.  I must conclude with a bit of a reminisce. I can remember getting this stuff in college (probably around 1998 - I wish I saved a bottle or two from then) and liking it, even though in those days, I was a ""Sam Adams is great"" guy. Now I can see how I felt that way. This beer is so accessible but yet so awesome still now. Just awesome.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Mad hops. i dont care if cascades taste like grapefruit juice, its amazing. this particular sample had a fairly strong alcohol bite to it. i imagine a year of aging might do it good, but not more than that lest the hop flavor will diminish. bigfoot is another strong brew from sierra nevada and a quintessential barelywine for hopheads everywhere.

I wasn't sure what to expect with this one since I've never had a barley wine before but this was the perfect blend of malt and hops. It was a beautiful brown, amber color with a little fluffy head. It smelled very hoppy with an underlying note of malt and something dark and rich.  I was extremely happy with this beer. The first drink was very hoppy with a bitter aftertaste that lingered FOREVER afterwards. As the beer warmed, it got maltier and maltier and very rich.  This rates right up there tastewise with the Ayinger Celebrator and the Dogfish Head 90 Minute which I think are both excellent beers.

Poured out a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Smelled of sweet malts and strong hops and a fruity wine scent. The taste was good. But not amazing. The sweet malts and hops were great, but that wine flavor behind the initial taste was a bit too much for me. I'm not a huge fan of wine, so this may be the reason, but for me, it wasn't pleasant.

Off white head built up quite well, and sat there as a nice foamy and frothy 2 finger cap for a while. The liquid was a dark orange, some brown. Can't see through the glass because it's murky. The smell has a big floral hoppiness to it. Lots of sweet malt down there with it as well, which is more apparent the warmer it gets. The taste starts out with a malty coating which turns into a quick floral hoppiness in the finish which *lingers* as a tingly bitterness. After about half the glass I start to get much more floral hop oil type of taste right at the beginning of the sip, which stays hoppy all the way through. Not much of an alcohol burn but it might combine with the hops at the very end to augment the bitterness.  Mouthfeel is about medium, which seems like a pretty good area for it. I've had double IPA's that are more syrupy than this.  Strong in every sense. This is a beer to really relax with in the cold weather and enjoy the heaviness of the flavor. ___  2004 Bigfoot on draft at Lucky Baldwins. ~4 years old.  Poured a hazy reddish brown. A lot of the hop bitterness has faded and you get a really nice maltiness out of it, although it does have some bite to it still.  A 2000 (8 years old) was also on tap and that had mellowed even more but had still kept a really nice maltiness to it. Interestingly this poured a clear reddish brown, no haze.

140,2671,BuckSpin,4.25,"Presentation: v.2007 ""Expedition"" (production code of 7026A0827???), cellared for 7 months in my possession, in a Duvel tulip  BAside: the 1st of many more reviews of a case of 2007 Bigfoot as it cellars.  Poured silent, thick n' slick. The nose, while still very nice, has toned down considerable from the fresh bottle I enjoyed in March 07'. The hops are muted significantly, still there is the aroma of overly ripened grapefruit, maybe some distant pine bark. A wonderful wooded/oak quality is present as well as dark brown sugar, some mild molasses and raisin. With some agitation some dulled mulling spice aspects leap out & then fade, and with some time to bloom a pleasing peaty, smokiness emerges along with some faint dried fruit. The overall nose is much more sophisticated & complex but no where near the searing hop blast it was.  A surprisingly fat finger's worth of thick, creamy, sticky almond hued foam has a pretty decent retention for a beer this big, eventually settling to a pencil's worth of the same with decent edge lacing in thick splotches. The color is just breathtaking - a stunningly burnt cherry amber, glowing, copper radiant, with almost a sunset quality to its luster. While the nose has tamed, this is still one great looking & smelling beer.  Oh, so creamy & smooth! Time has tamed the beast that was Bigfoot fresh! This is very nice! Hops are robust yet bitter, sharp, even a wee bit gritty in feel. The malts are silky smooth & bittersweet, a pleasing burnt caramel quality adding to the overall bitterness. It will be interesting to see how this hop degradation continues to evolve. Still a beer that commands to be sipped & savored.  A dull, wooded/oaken quality is present and adds some structure, but overall this is about bitterness and how the beer is evolving. The play of the creamy, bittersweet malted mouthfeel against the bitter hops arrows piercing its velvet skin is a very nice contrast.  It tones down significantly on the palate, growing much softer and sweeter, taking on a slightly syrupy feel. The alcohol, which to this point has been alarmingly absent, finally ignites my mouth in a steady, dull heat with a subtle throbbing quality. It lingers and continues to slowly grow in intensity & presence. The finish is semi-dry and bittersweet, gritty, a filmy rockiness/mineral quality pervading my senses along with a delayed *boom* of an alcoholic rush & vapor. The aftertaste is full of grapefruit pith & rind, dirt, yet surprisingly clean & light in feel.  A damn fine beer experience. I'll enjoy more of these now and would highly recommend that anyone cellaring this should enjoy some at this point. It will be interesting to revisit it as a review after a year. This would pair fantastically with a big, bold Bleu cheese (especially the creamy feel) or any other cheese that has some serious strength.

Drinks less like a barleywine and more like a Strong Ale. Makes me remember the time i was sitting at the bar and i drank three of these while doing the crosswords in the paper, then i lifted my head up and was smacked right in the face with the alcohol.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,MarkSCCOT,4.5,"Tried this after getting as a gift from BA Alyeast. I have little experience with Barleywines. The one I did try was young and as such harsh.  Poured from a 12 ounce bottle (Vintage 2004) aged 3 years into a snifter.  A. Deep dark apple cider appearance with a moderate head that dissipates but remains throughout the tasting. Some mild lacing.  S. This was an interesting beer since initially I poured the beer too cold. As the beer warmed the smell intensifyed and actually transitioned. At last the hops came out from the woodwork, but never completely overwhelmed the overall maltiness.  T. For me Sierra Nevada has always been an ""in your face"" Cascades Hop bomb. Always enjoyable but never what I would look as a mellow experience. What made this beer so enjoyable is that the aging mellowed the hops taste without compromising it particular hoppiness. But the hops and malts are well balanced. The alcohol warmth is very pleasantly noticeable. This was a great appertif and a worldclass barleywine.  M. A smooth beer. The carbonation is negligible, but the body is smooth.  D. The high alcohol is a bummer, but still, if you want a gourmet quality beer to experience, definitely a great choice when aged.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ralree,2.06,"A: Head is a little weak, but that's almost expected from this style. 1/2 finger at best. Color is reddish-orange and murky. Laces nicely.  S: Grainy and pretty fruity. Will probably be good.  T: REALLY bitter. I wasn't expecting this level of bite. It's not my style, so I'm going to give it a lower rating than some others might. The alcohol is very evident as well. Has a bready finish.  M: A little thick - a little astringent.  D: Had to pour it all out. Completely undrinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,deanhead,4.58,"2007 Vintage Appearance- Poured a dark amber, and brilliantly clear beer with a frothy head that slowly dissipated into a variety of bubbles that eventually left a lace around the perimeter of the goblet.  Smell-Spicy yet sweet smelling hop aroma right on the nose. Flowery essence with a peppery finish  Taste- Slightly sweet with a pronounced dank, pungent, chewy bitterness that lingers on until the alcohol taste pushes it's way forward and says hello. This beer has a huge bite, that goes on and on and on.  Mouthfeel- This is one full bodied bitter beer, with an extraordinary amount of hops to balance the malt on this one. The alcohol just simply invades your mouth combined with a coating of hops to make this a well rounded beer.  Drinkability- Wow! Sierra Nevada has really managed to create a highly drinkable barley wine, that leaves you coming back for more year after year. It tastes like another.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,51mmz0rz,4.72,"This review was of the 2006:  A: Small tan head, but it's thick; strong. The body is cloudy and mysterious, like a foreign planet. Bubbles struggle to move through the deep brown body of the beer.  S: Smell is rich, with a honey sweetness and slight alcohol tinge. The smell of old malt gives it a distinguished aroma. I can tell I'm going to have to sip this one.  T: First sip: Malt, hops, malt, alcohol and layers upon layers of flavors. They hit in distinct sections; amazingly well choreographed beer. Malt honey sweetness, hop bitterness and bite, and roasty malt on the finish. A song.  M: Thick and coating; fits the style.  D: A beer to enjoy slowly for sure, with exceptional and varied palate. ___  2008 version poured into a tall Adnams glass.  A: Nice thick head with a unique light orange color. The body is pretty clear and fiery red, probably the reddest beer I've seen. Head has good staying power, and the lacing is excellent. 5.0  S: I smelled this beer as soon as I opened the bottle. Nice hoppy aroma and a sweet malt in the background. 4.0  T: Huge hops flavors, I personally don't taste much malt. Lots of bitterness, and it lingers. I think this could use some aging to curb that a little. 4.0  M: Mouthfeel is good, maybe slightly thick, with normal carbonation. 4.0  D: The lingering bitterness and high abv make this one to sip. 3.5  I'll be interested to cellar a few of these and check back in a few months. 4.15/5",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,WaveRebel51,4.7,"2007 edition. Mmmmm. Looks and smells tasty. Deep amber hue, and is very thick. A deep fragrant aroma -- nice mix of floral hops, sweet malts and an earthy character ... the tastebuds are bombarded with complex flavors. Starts out with a malts, then strong hop bitterness finished off with malt sweetness. Yummy. So thick, I'd bet you could drizzle this over a piece of cheesecake for a wonderful after dinner treat.  EDIT -- 2008 edition. I think I sold this one short when reviewing the 2007. The flavor profile is excellent, as you get the whole range from the sweet malts up front to the hop bitterness in the finish.

140,2671,cabsandking,4.52,"A delicious looking chunky beige head sits with good retention on top of an amber to dark copper brew. Caramel malty nose, some hop characters of floral esters and citrus fruits. Full bodied with a less than chewy mouthfeel and frothy swill. Flavor is extremely hoppy, peppery, resiny, funky sour towards the middle, and an assertive hoppy pine washes over the rest of it. Malt and toasted grain characters sit behind the hops. Dry, bitter finish with resiny florals and burnt sugars, biscuity. I enjoyed this beer but wanted something more than a face full of hops...perhaps some time in the cellar will soften its edges.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Strix,4.67,"Cracking a 2006 expedition. Gorgeous clear red-amber color with thick lasting head. Smell is packed with hops. Taste is WOW! There is so much going on with the taste. Full of hops, with orange, malt, spice, pine, and grapefruit flavors. Really complex and tasty. Reminiscent of a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale with more complexity and a serious hop kick. I don't remember what the other bottles tasted like, but the aging couldn't have hurt this. Mouthfeel smooth but dense and the alcohol is noticeable and warming. A nice brew.  2018 addendum: Cracked a 10-year-old 2008 vintage. 4.5 Poured a clear dark chestnut, great head on it, especially considering the age. 5 Brown sugar, malt, sugar.

140,2671,zeff80,4.34,"2006 edition  A - Poured out a clear, amber color with a small, tan, one-finger head. Left nice rings of lace.  S - It smelled of Cascade hops. Also, some citrusy notes. A good dose of malt aromas, too.  T - It tasted of spices. A nice sweet caramel maltiness. Some fruit flavors, too.  M - It was crisp and sharp. A heavy-bodied beer with a warm alcohol presence.  D - This is a very good barley wine. But it is very strong and requires some slow sippin'.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,pmcadamis,5,"A - A very solid looking finger and a half of orangish-tan cream rises above a deep crimson blood-red amber brew that lets only a little light through. An enormous amount of gorgeous dry lace sticks to the glass, and the lace shows some flecks of orange too. Ok, it came to me...the head and lace are the color of the inside of the orange rind! Swirling deposits a huge amount of perfectly arced lace around the glass, and builds the head up to a full finger and a half again. The head shows outstanding retention for such a high ABV beer.  S - I could smell the mandarin orange hops before I put my nose in the glass, and that aroma only intensifies with my schnoz fully inserted cheek-deep into the glass. Has a lot of DIPA aromas, but with a dirtier malt aspect. Big sweet juicy mandarin oranges....real, not canned. Some piny aspects show the SN DNA, but this is all about hoppy sweet-citrus fruit aromas. I also smell some round sour cream notes that remind me of Orval. The malts are all fresh sweet bread with peanut butter and light caramel notes too. As it warms I get some dark fruits too, and it also becomes much more complex and boozy with warmth. I could sniff this all day. This has single malt quality aromatics.  T - Oh! There's the complexity I was looking for! Dirty, earthy, gritty, tobacco, and scotch malt grabs my attention straight away, then dark fruit and caramel in the mid-palate. Lots of hoppy citrus overlays the darker fruits, but doesn't distract from them. It's almost like singing row-row-row-your-boat and then somebody else starts singing brother-john-brother-john before you've finished...it's that complex! I also taste hints of sourdough bread, pumpernickel, sunflower seeds, pine sap, junipery gin and tonic quinine notes, and loads and loads of sweet and bitter citrus and pine (leaning towards the citrus in the beginning and leaning toward pine in the finish). There is a distinct black licorice anise twinge right before the swallow that I didn't notice at first. This is one of the most well put together beers I've ever tasted. Outstanding!  M - Big, fat, plump, full, rich, silky, and boozy. This is one of the fullest mouthfeels I've ever experienced! I can feel sugar, alcohol, and hop oils covering my mouth. The dry bitter and acrid finish reminds me of one of my favorite non-beer drinks....the dry gin martini, but it also has a lot of scotch-like qualities (scotch is another passion of mine...but I really can't afford to drink it with any regularity). This is really, really pleasant, and is pretty much the definition of full-bodied.  D - Screw the 9.6% ABV! I could drink this all day (slowly, and with plenty of water). Outstandingly complex flavors shine like a star, but the nose doesn't really advertise the greatness. A bit more pungency in the nostrils would garner this a perfect 5.0 from this fella.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Thick off white head forms about an inch thick soon settling down to a dense centimetre head. Lots of patches of lacing up and down the glass  Smell, rich sticky creamy american hop tinged alcohol, fresh pine and citric hops on the nose, tonnes of lemon and lime citrus. Bubblegum and candy floss, sticky caramel and toffee, rich burnt sugar and a touch of molassess, sweet effervescent alcoholic fumes. A touch of caramel and oaky bourbon aromas also  Taste, slick oily american hops, cascade and centennial overflow the palette with a myriad of juicy citric, bubblegum and piney flavours. Rich bitterness from the hops along with a quinine like finish. Sweet and caramel like malt profile along with some sharp notes of ginger and black onion seeds. Thick rich alcohol, nothing too over the top though considering the abv. Chewy and sticky hops backed up by a thick and crisp malty backbone, yeast dryness on the finish along with a tonne of various hop bitterness.  A big bold and seriously heavily hopped 'barelywine'.

140,2671,saintwarrick,4.2,"2007 vintage. Wow, this brew blows the doors off my preconceptions of a barleywine. This is its big fat hoppy neighbor. Pours a dark ruby with a big ol' hopped-up IPA-like head, a stark departure from every other barley wine I have had. Hops and oils hit the nose big time, very piney and slightly astringent, but not to its detriment; behind that it also has some candied fruits soaked in old brandy. Hops show through in the taste, very bitter with an underlying sweetness that almost balances the brew, big alcohol bite hits at the end as is common with this style.  This brew is a big chewy glassful, but definitely a sipper. I love hops, so I may just have to say this is the best barleywine I have had. Wish I could get this more often.

Pours a brownish-amber color with a one-finger head that doesn't last much long. Aroma is a mix of malt and hops with strong alcohol scent. So far, I think this will be decent.  Taste is hoppy upfront, almost an overload. Fades into a strong alcohol aftertaste with the hops and malt following along. A second sip confirms much of the same. It's still quite strong and hoppy and may need more aging over time.  So far though, I'm enjoying this beer for what it is and I recognize that it needs more aging. Great sipping beer though and reminds me much of 120 Minute IPA in terms of hoppiness and strength.  I like.

This is my first one since then and now I love it. This is an '06 Im trying. Pours out a dark ruby amber with a full head that retains and laces thick all around. Smells of dark fruit, fig, alcohol and hops. Taste is delicious. Ripe plumb, brown sugar and a bang of delicious hops. My face is now comfortably numb, well warm anyways. Mouthfeel is medium with a carbonation presence. I love the hop profile in this brew and it is very drinkable, especially considering the ABV.

But a year old, on tap at Spike's on Higuera downtown San Luis Obispo, this one really hit the spot. Looked pretty good. Light brown, reddish hue with minimal lacing that dissapated quickly. Smelled pretty good, above average Tasted damn good. Smooth, malty but stll very hoppy with that distinctive Bigfoot yeast/malt.

M - chewy, sticky, creamy, heavy. Fair bit of alcohol warmth. Long dry finish. Perfect for the style.  D - This tastes like heaven in a glass.  Candy for adults... that's what this beer is. It is great fresh or aged, Sierra Nevada really does make a fine product. Oh how I wish the small national brands in Canada (Sleeman, Big Rock, Moosehead) bothered to make good beer like this.

As soon as the cap was popped, I could smell the sweet aromas awaiting to be poured into my glass. Poured a deliciously dark hazy walnut color with nice 2 finger head with massive appeal. The caramel malt and fruity aroma was almost overpowering. Initial taste was incredibly malty with a nice brown sugar-like sweetness and pleasant citrusy bitterness. Mouthfeel is incredible! Thick and chewy, definately an impressive brew. If you can drink a 6er of this, I tip my hat to ya. For me, one and I'm done, a meal in itself.

140,2671,BretSikkink,4.4,"A sort of holy grail, and also a litmus test for drinkers of hoppy barleywines. A personal favorite; I'll try to be objective. 2007 vintage bottle.  Multi finger head with sticky fluffy lacing. Deep red brown color is always attractive. Very nice look for a barleywine.  Very hop-ful aroma, fresh grapefruit sting with a pine background. Also in the nose there is some fruity ester alcohols along with a malt profile of some thickness though not to a JW Lees-extent. All dominated by the oily resin hop swell.  Bitter and hop driven, though to my mind not as astringent as the Celebration ale. Big sweet toasted malt is in there for gravity and balance, there's some light kind of fruitiness and esters. Finish is semi-dry with plenty of warming fusel alcohols.  Great depth, not too thick and syrupy but manages to cram a huge hop content in here and keep delightful sturdiness of body.  It's hard to manage much more than one or two at a time, with the high alcohol content and supreme palate-shredding bitterness. I enjoyed the 2006 vintage this summer on tap alongside a relatively fresh 2007 keg; while the newer obviously flexed its hop muscle a great deal more, both were outstanding, challenging, and impressive ales, with the 2006 being one of the smoothest and richest draft ales I've ever enjoyed. If you think you enjoy today's ""big beer"" movement, check out a tried and true recipe that shows what high gravity and big hops are all about.  **Update** 2008 vintage  Same oaky color, incredibly sticky and long-lasting head.  Pine hops dominate the aroma of this young barleywine. Plenty of citrus in there as well, also a good amount of sweet caramel malts.  This is just a great flavor. I love the thickness of the malt and the fresh pang of C hops. I was consistently impressed with '06 and '07's hop charge even as they aged, but it is also very lovely brand new.  Drinkability is sometimes a stumbling block, but overall the flavor and craft evident in the Bigfoot is exemplary.  2008 is also highly recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

T- Hops in the front are spicey and taste a lot like a an evergreen. Sharp flavor's great. The malt is well balanced. Not a grainy malt... a bit sweeter like a molasses.  M- Fairly thick, but not a chewy or grainy flavor. Barleywines are usually too heavy for me, but this is good.

Palate is hops, hops, and more hops. I have chewed on hops just by them selves; Sierra Nevada Bigfoot is no different. The taste of this brew is just like chewing on a hand full of hops with a barley malt wash.

I quickly talked myself into buying it, even though it was a good four dollars more than I was planning on spending.  It poured a clear amber with a lacy head that dissipated rapidly, but not completely. Immediately, there was the scent of hops and sweetness wafting from the pint glass.  This beer fills the mouth on contact, delivering that hop bitterness from the smell, which comes across as snappy. After the initial bitter, it is sweet and warm, with a little stickiness on the aftertaste along with the alcohol burn.

Nice webs of lacing coat the sides of the chalice.  S-This smells like Sierra Nevada pale Ale of steroids. Those same cascade hops step to the forefront with a mildy sweet malt backbone a a whiff of alcohol  T-Deifnitely more bitter than sweet as befits an American Barley wine. The bitterness remains throughout the wonderful piney essence of northwest hops. some grapefruit as well. The residual caramel/mollases sweetness exists in the follow through but that bitterness and a bit of warming from the alcohol are what you get in the end.  M-Slightly on the thick side with out being too viscous and more carbonation than the typical barley wine.  D-This is probably the second barleywine I ever had after Old Foghorn and I still like it today. the drinkability is so good for a beer of its strength that I have been known to polish off a sixer of this in my younger days.

140,2671,MiguelMandingo,4.12,"This was my first barleywine ever, and it made quite a nice impression on me. This is definitely my new favorite from Sierra Nevada. Thanks to BeerZack @ Wiggy's for pointing this brew out.  Poured a 12oz. bottle of 2007 into a snifter.  Appearance  It has a dark translucent garnet color. It has a small off-white head that recedes into a halo at the edges of the glass.  Smell  The smell is all over the place. I can smell hops, citrusy grapefruit, pine, alcohol, spice, and caramel malt.  Taste  Wow. There is so much going on with this brew that it is hard to pinpoint anything. It has a subdued slightly fruity caramel sweet taste to it, but Bitter hops is the flavor that sticks out the most - and there is a lot of it. I detect the sweetness first followed very quickly by the hops. All of the scents contained in the smell are also in its flavor. Highly reminiscent of a DIPA, just fruitier and lots more spice.  Mouthfeel  Slightly oily and thick without being chewy, but definitely thick. An extremely slight alcohol burn from the 9.6% ABV.  Drinkability  For as big a beer as this one is, it goes down amazingly smooth. I have sampled 6% ABV brews that dont go down like this one. It is still a sipper at 9.6% ABV, but I could easily have another one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,TheClassical,3.41,"I had one of these a while ago, but I saw the 2007 batch on the shelf and decided I needed to try one again. Too bad I only got the one, and not an entire six pack!  From a 355mL/12oz chilled bottle and into a pint glass, the pour is an incredibly rich ruby-orange. The deep copper-brown brew shimmering in the lamplight was very inviting. The head was very nice. It fizzled to a muddled foam after a while with rich veins of lacing down the glass. It makes the glass and the beer look well-enjoyed. The carbonation was steady and slow.  The nose ... how can I describe it? It was very smooth and exciting, and certainly not overpowering, something you might expect in an ale/barley wine that's 9.6% abv. It was an intensely hoppy aroma, and even though the hops are strong on the taste, there is enough malt sweetness in the nose to keep it balanced. In all, I was surprised at just how subdued and low-key the aroma was.  The taste is powerful. An initial impression of alcohol is washed away by a mouthful of hops. The alcohol taste remains, but in a way that is appropriately loud on a beer like this. There is a heady and dry finish that lends well to sipping, which is fine, because this one is too big to drink too quickly.  It's certainly drinkable, but as others have said, you need time to enjoy this beer, and you could plan an evening around a six pack of this stuff. Strong as it is, I would have loved another, so I think it's quite drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,BrewSomerville,3.62,"Aroma: grassy hops, sweet malt, grapefruit... aroma is not very strong; I think that it might have something to do with the lack of effervescence.  Looks: Ruby red/orange/copper-ish colour. Almost no head, just a little around the edges of the glass.  Taste: grapefruit, spicy hops, bitter hops (chinook?), floral, piney. Sweetness from the malt is there at the begining but then steps aside for the hops to take over. Alcohol is well masked considering it is 9.6% ABV. Hops are very bitter in this Beer.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied. Fine carbonation, similar to that of a naturally conditioned mouthfeel... I don't think that it is though (naturally conditioned).  Overall, it is a good sipping Beer, do not buy this Beer if you don't intend on spending some time with it. A very big Beer in taste.

Hints of the sweet malts come through on the nose. Smells like a huge american IPA. T: Bitter hops on the front of the tongue, then a hint of sweetness to help balance things out. There is a hint of citrus in the back but, it is mostly just bitter. M: More carbonation than I associate with a barley wine but, I like it. This doesn't come across as thick, just hugely malty. D: This is probably the worlds most a**-kicking american IPA, and I mean that as a huge compliment. I haven't had many american barley wines but the level of hops seems true to style (and taste great). HIghly recommended, I can't wait to slowly drink down this six-pack.  2/3/14 drinking my last 2007 now The top did not want to twist off, when I finally got it off, there were signs of some leakage in the threads.  A: Dark and hazy, no head, not very pretty :) S: There are still hops there, but they are not very obvious, a slight caramel smell along with something hard to place T: The malts are way out in front, but it is obvious that there are a ton of hops in there, slight sherry flavor, no cardboard, a hint of what I can only describe as metallic M: The carbonation is almost gone, very tongue coating, slight astringency O: If this was my first time trying Bigfoot, there probably would not be a second time :) There is some definite oxidation that doesn't work very well with the hops. This was the last year of the twist-off tops, hopefully the 08's in the basement have held up better.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Contra,3.18,"I've reviewed this beer awhile ago, and I'm kind of surprised at the difference in my impressions about this beer. Perhaps because this is the ""2007 Edition""? I don't know.  The appearance is fairly good, rosewood color, head around the rim of the glass. A quick whiff of the beer reveals a good, hearty aroma of hops & malt. Unfortunately, I'm just not tasting what I'm smelling. Bitterness is out of control and, I have to suppose, masks those hops & malt. I'm missing that sweet, malty characteristic found in Barleywines. Again, that overwhelming bitterness really takes away from the mouthfeel & drinkability. Now, Barleywines never really have a high drinkability, but in comparison to other Barleywines, the bitterness just doesn't work.  Overall, don't let my review sway you away from trying this beer. My previous review was positive, but I have to be honest in this current review. Whether they changed something in 2007, or the six pack I bought wasn't kept well, I don't know.  To be fair, I'm going to try & get a single bottle of this stuff next time I go to the distributor which allows breaking up of six-packs. I'll amend my review whether or not my impression has changed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,trill,4.07,"2007 vintage, poured into an oversized wine glass.  a - poured a dark copper, with a very slight head that tends to hang around for the duration.  s - malty, but, for the style, an exceptional amount (read: a bit) of hops in the nose.  t/m - surprisingly balanced for a barleywine. enough hop presence to stand up to the big malts. this leads me to believe that this one would benefit greatly from sitting for a year or two, to let the hops calm down and the complexities of the malts expand. the mouthfeel is pretty even, with a fair amount of bite from the carbonation/alcohol.  d - overall, a highly drinkable example of the style, which seems well-prepared for cellaring. i've gone through 3 bottles of a six-pack, and i look forward to seeing how the other three age.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,BeerBelcher,4,"I had the 2004 Bigfoot on tap at Roman's Pub recently, and thought it to be quite good, better than fresher examples of Bigfoot I've had recently.  It was served to me in a Delirium Tremens tulip, and was an attractive hazy red with a scummy head made up of tiny bubbles with more tiny bubbles rising from the side of the glass (this beer would make Don Ho very happy).  Aroma was sweetly hoppy with some candy sugariness.  Flavor was intense but with more subtleness than fresher Bigfoot I've had, with a mellowed hop sugariness providing not so much a flavor of fresh pineapple, but the flavor of canned pineapple syrup. Good.  Mouthfeel was quite smooth and velvety.  A very good beer. Definitely recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Many thanks to joecast in Tassie, who brought it back from the US.  2007 Expedition... cute little cartoon on the inside of the cap.... glad I read the Alstrom reviews and learnt what it was, otherwise I was gonna mark it down for having a dirty lid...  a: Handsome, haze-free, mahogany to copper colour. Well-set head, an inch to start, and eases nicely as the drink progresses...good start.  s: Big American hop nose... ubiquitous citrus... Grapefruit for sure, but I think the rest of the damn clan's come along also. Malty notes of toffee/honeycomb round it off. Worth throwing in a brandy balloon and savouring for the nose alone.  f: Hops again, of course... and very fresh. Reminds me of a recent hop-harvest ale from Victoria, AUS.... but more intense and sweet. The hop notes carry brambly vegetation.... pine, spice. It's robust, strong, and green.  m: Chewy, sticky, strong bitterness... slightly hot.  d: I've tried many beers that have been considered cellarable. And for the most part not understood exactly why. This beer, however, makes no mistake in shirt-fronting you with juvenile aggression.

140,2671,frankbro,4.68,"I only give it a 4 on drinkability because you can't chug it. At 9.6 ABV you probably wouldn't want to. Not for mowing or yardwork. Didn't I have a flower bed? Definitely a thick head, in the glass. Not much lacing in a Bass Ale glass. It's a beautiful reddish-gold, when held to the sun. Smells like HOPS, citrus, and malt. As hoppy as a double IPA.

140,2671,t0rin0,4.46,"I have tried 06 and 07 Bigfoot both on tap and in the bottle. I heard a lot of people say that its more bitter this year but I can't notice the difference. That may be because it had been a year since I had it last.  The appearance is amazing. Its an awsome red color with a dark head. Hold it up to a light, its really a nice color.  It has an intense malt smell with a considerable hop presence. The only downside is that one can almost smell the bitterness. I am not saying that bitterness is bad, just that when it comes out in the smell it doesnt bode well for the beer.  This beer is remarkably well balanced in sweetness and bitterness. Despite my initial predictions based on the smell it is one of the best flavors ive tasted in a beer. The first sip almost hurts its so bitter but after that its really quite delicious and after 1 or 2 bottles in an evening you wont even notice the bitterness.  Bigfoot is fairly heavy bodied as it should be considering how much unfermented sugar there is in the beer. It has a low-medium carbonation but it doesnt matter because its just as good once it gets flat.  It is drinkable but it must be sipped and enjoyed. The 6 pack challenge has a become a ritual in my group of friends. If you want to ""chug"" a 6 pack, which still takes a few hours, be prepared to wake up the next morning in a strange place. Otherwise enjoy it with a meal or on tap somewhere.  Overall: a great beer even warm and/or flat. Well worth the cost.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Atlas1,4.1,"Well, hello Bigfoot. Please leave your imprint here.  Poured into my Delirium snifter, this 2007 Expedition Bigfoot appears a dense copper orange color, with some crazy cranberry hues that shine through when held up to the light. Good looking head, with some sticky lacy residue left behind as the beer recedes. Smells hoppy, like a lot of nice IPAs I've had before. I know the SN brewing company is known for hoppy seasonals, but I had no idea their barleywine style would be quite so complex in the hop factor too. Well played, SNBC... well played. The taste is genuinely hoppy, with a crazy strong malt character built in. Lots of fruit here too, but it's almost too heavily masked by the hop content. I love this flavor, but I think it would be just as good if it were a bit milder. Mouthfeel is hefty. I'm not sure this is a very drinkable beer for several different reasons. It appeals to a certain beer drinker, and that's just fine with me because I am that certain type of beer drinker, but it's not an accessible beer by the masses. It can't be. And that's what makes it that much better. Still, t'is a fine beer and one that will keep me running on fumes for the better part of the afternoon.

Nice light tan head that stayed a 1/4"" thick throughout.  S: Hops hit the nose first followed by some slightly sweet malts. Surprisingly the alcohol is not detectable in the smell.  T: Damn, this is a pungent, powerful, raw and a tad bit harsh of a brew. It starts out with some bitter hops in the form of a lot of citrus and some pine. It then slides into the slightly sweet malts; caramel & toasted malts. Then the alcohol hits in a big way. Probably the biggest wallop of alcohol I've ever experienced in a beer.  M: Medium bodied, slightly syrupy yet with a good amount of carbonation.  D: Certainly not the most drinkable beer I've had due to the raw and powerful flavors from the hops and the alcohol. This was my first barley wine and I found it intriguing.

Beer pours a deep copper color with a white head that is leaving decent lacing behind. The nose is very pleasant, heavily perfumed by the citrusy floral hops. Taste is a blast malts and a large amount of hops that dominate the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, an almost chewy quality. Overall drinkability is good.

140,2671,lonestar4lunch,4.67,2007 edition. OUTSTANDING. This years is a special gift. It is their traditional Bigfoot but with more hops and man do I love the hops. It has the sweetness with a touch of bitterness in the end with hops lingering on the tounge. Wonderfull. I will buy all I can find. Had right after a 2006 and quite a bit more hops. Can't say enough. This is like Bigfoot mated with Celebration and a beautiful brew was born. Will call it Celebrafoot....it's that good folks.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,eepopporkahah,4.2,"A - Bright and ruddy, clear and slightly bubbly. The head poured huge then dissipated rather quickly. S - Grass seed, pine sap, grapefruit, dark sugar, vanilla, and moist pipe tobacco all come to mind. T - Bottoms up! Fierce hops and smooth caramel come first, the caramal thins and disappears, leaving a hop bitterness (from out of nowhere). As this bitterness fades, I taste leather, moss, spice, and a lingering dry bitterness M - The mouthfeel is thin but syrupy. An odd balance between barley wine and lighter styles of beer D - Being a big ABV fan, I might dare call this a session beer on colder nights. However, June feeling as it does in NYC, it's best left for: winter (for the patient among us) or, right now (for the lushes among us).  I highly recommend it with any of the following: dark spanish chocolate, hard cheese such as Doddington, isle of Mull cheddar, a very aged pecorino Toscano, Bresaola, gamey bbq like mutton, venison, or anything rubbed with masala, the Motorhead album ""Ace of Spades,"" or your fifth out of seven days of work in a row.

There are distinct characteristics that may improve with a bit more time. For instance the mellow fruity qualities could stand to be enhanced.  Again, the flavor is bitey with some tangy fruit and a bit of smoky warmness. The finish is a bit sweeter with honey and some great malt.  A good welcomed carbonation lightens up the brew and accentuates the sharpness on the tongue. Overall a very nice selection.

Just by smelling it you know this is going to be a hop-bomb.  Taste is really smooth with a butt-kicking bitterness that will leave even the most hardcore hopfanatics satisfied. My tastebuds is almost overwhelmed. There are also some notes of grapefruit and a weak presence of malt-sweetness. The high abv is well hidden by the hops.  This is a fine brew for those who can take this kind of hop-bomb. I would prefer some more malt in there but by reading other reviews this is is a brew that ages with diginity and get more balanced over the years.

Some initial spiderweb lacing- decent head- half an inch on this one- hills and bumps. A very sweet scent eminating from my glass- detected some maple notes, raisons, even slight caramel. A side from the sweet stuff- Bigfoot is a hop bomb! These hops will stick around for a while as well leaving a great taste in the mouth right up until the next sip. The alcohol is evident- at 9.6% ABV although it is not as strong as expected with a barley wine- tastes better as it warms-  Needless to say, Bigfoot is a pleasure to sip.

The smell is loaded with American hops; citric notes of Cascade, Challenger and perhaps some Fuggles? I found notes of grape fruits, bitter oranges, bitter herbs and some light sweetness from the malt.  The taste is very concentrated and powerful: an almost brutal bitterness. Grape fruit juice, bitter herbs, lightly roasted malt, some mild sweet notes. The aftertaste got some minerals and earthy notes, the bitterness gets a little milder and smoother. The finish is creamy, somewhat sweet with sour-bitter notes of bitter citric fruits.  The carbonation is mild; small soft bubbles. The liquid is very smooth and a bit thick.

140,2671,RidiculedDisplay,3.7,"2007 edition.  Poured into an oversized wine glass.  Appearance: Pours with a fairly pretty butterscotch. However, this one lost points for its lack of solidity in body color - it needed a least more of a semblance of being opaque. When holding it up to the light, it looked watery and unimpressive. The lacing is like a fine sea mist, a myriad of hyper-carbonated dots canvasing the side of the glass.  Smell: Caramel sweetness, alcohol, big flowery and pine aromas. Super hoppy backbone which cradles the sweet aromas very nicely. Cinnamon. Really works very nicely for a ABW in terms of being strikingly harmonious and easy to snuff. Very well balanced aroma.  Taste: Caramel, huge pine, flowers. There's a very noticeable alcohol here that isn't very pleasant, especially given its relatively low ABV for the style. I'm not digging this as much as the aroma, but I do see how age would serve the flavor well.  Mouthfeel: A little too carbonated, perhaps, but otherwise syrupy and somewhat astringent.

There is a peppery spice to the smell and the taste. Butterscotch notes are noticeable as well. Darkened toast with orange marmalade comes to mind.  The alcohol sticks on the tongue long after the swallow. The mouthfeel has little flesh and doesn't really hold up to the caramel notes from the nose.

This is a good one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Chaz,4.27,"A medium-pour into a bulb yields a two-fingered, medium-tan head. Excellent lacing. Pours a moderately-hazey copper-amber in color, with ample yeast settling to the bottom of the glass. Hops are *very* expressive on the nose, with a sort of buffet-table of bitterness and floral hop qualities. Earthy, both in the hops and malt qualities . . . almost smells 'dirty', like the roots of a plant being transplanted. Vegetal qualities are underlying the floral and citric hop notes, and there are a number of fruit notes here too: ripe plum, raisin, fig, and of course anise/licorice. Some diacetyl, but on-style. Licorice and hop bite/bitterness are al over the first sip, followed by a rounding plummy, toffee quality, and a bit of butterscotch. Even after just a sip, there's a sincere alcohol presence in this one - this brew means business! Notes of apple (red and green) in the aromatics, which play nicely with the floral hops (if I said I detect cherry blossoms here you wouldn't accuse me of floral prose, would ya?) Bitterness is very pronounced, and an aquired taste, but is on-style; very par for the course as per my Bigfoot reminiscenses. There's a lemony-citric and even minty quality to the hops on the palate, and it's worth noting that this has a rather dry characteristic as it is still rather fresh; age should smooth that out a bit. Some cherry notes in this too, but faint. Body is medium-full, and becomes a bit more round as this warms. Caramel notes sre here about midway through, and really work well with the fresh hops and fruit characteristics throughout (the caramel notes, too, should become more pronounced as this ages over the next couple of years). Full mouthfeel, with nice,crisp carbonation, but not overly carbonated. Despite a considerable heft this is indeed quite drinkable for the style.

Smells of hops and pine tree forests. Sweet sugars in the background smooth out the hop sharpness. Wonderful.  The barleywine hop bite is there, bitterness only slightly offset by the beer's sugars. Piney hops give it a crisp flavor, which presents a nice contrast to the almost coffeelike background - bitter sweetness.  Despite the hoppiness, there's very little tongue bite, and just the right amount of carbonation.  At 9.6% ABV, I won't be pounding back a few of these in a row anytime soon.

140,2671,jdg204,4.65,"Finally broke down and bought a 6'er of this bad boy after hearing all the praise and seeing it at the Beer Shop for a few months. Got a great price ($8.99) as well and it was well, well worth the wait.  Appearance - Lovely rich red/orange color with a very nice plump slightly off-white head.  Smell - Rich amber citrus smells with a very spiced undertone.  Taste - WOW, not for the faint of heart to be sure. This was almost like a Triple IPA (West Coast Style), the hops was as intense as I think you can go and still hold a reasonable balance. The sweet, rich citrus flavors were intense and though I expected a bit more maltiness, it was definetly enjoyable.  Mouthfeel - Your mouth is in for a party, and yes everyone is invited! The thick, richness of the flavor will overwhelm a bit, but it's a heck of a thrill ride. The hop intensity will definetly leave your mouth tingling for a while, but hey, you only live once.  Drinkability - I'd only had an English Barleywine before, so the American version was very unique and very awesome! The American version is very different as it is less malty but much more intensely hopped and flavored. You could definetly call this beer bittersweet, though not in the traditional sense as it was first richly sweet then a nice intensely bitter aftertaste. I can see how this one has become a classic, bringing barleywines to a much wider audience and this brew definetly brought it!

A nice small amount of good sticky lacing, and a constant soapy head that sits all the way through. Good looking brew.  The smell is like a big hoppy IPA. Sweet and leafy...maybe a little caramel sneaking in there as well.  Taste like you would think it should. Like a big IPA with a little more sweet alcohol. You get the sweet, super warming alcohol with a little syrupy caramel type flavor mixed in at the beginning, then it finishes with the hops. This beer changes dramatically as it warms up in your hand. The syrupy qualities start coming through more and it gets a little sweeter. The only thing that stays the same is the big hoppy finish, which definately lingers with its bitterness on your tongue.  Mouthfeel like I said changes as it warms up. Definately gets to a syruppy feeling about halfway through it...which I like. While it doen't taste like one, it's kind of like a good dopplebock in its consistency on the tongue.  Drinkability isn't that high though. The alcohol, which fits, is really apparent, and this one (for me at least) really lingers. There's a lot going on, and it really hits me hard as I'm not that experienced in big-bold hoppy brews yet. My limit is two of these guys.

S: Hints of fig or date come to mind, with a nice malty depth to it and a whiff of hoppiness in there as well, undergirded by a caramel sweet scent that smells delicious.  T: A sweet and malty introduction give way to a hop bitterness that lasts well beyond the finish, leaving a lingering bittersweet taste on the palate. Some fruity notes round out the flavor, and provide a nice diversion from malt and hop presences, which are phenomenal.  M: Good amount of carbonation, still retains a sharp and crisp taste, somewhat oily and syrupy, though.. but it all seems appropriate for this beer.  D: With solid flavors from the hop and malt camps coming at you, it's hard to not reach for another one of these.

It leaps out at you and grabs you by the throat! Beneath the alcohol is a very nice sweet (caramel?) malt flavor that jumps around the alcohol.  The mouthfeel is excellent. Very thick (somewhat syrupy) and has a mellow feel on the palate. Nice amount of carbonation.  Given the alcohol running rampant, it's still quite drinkable, but I don't think I see myself having more than one of these at a given time. I'm curious to see what this may taste like after a year of aging.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,afinepilsner,4.47,"12oz brown bottle  2007 edition  Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Barlywine Style Ale was a red-brown color with a light tan head. The head had good retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was full of hops and fruit with noticeable alcohol.

140,2671,GratefulBeerGuy,4.37,"12 0z 2007 bottle&gt;snifter  The 2006 vintage I had last summer was excellent, i was suprised when the 2007 verion was even better.  AP: a lovely mahogony-amber color with medium carbonation that managed to form a small off-white head that dissipated to a few thin clumps of thin covering.  nose: wow, this one seems to have a stronger aroma than i remeber from the 2006 version with big sweet malt that is really complex with an abundance of fruity scent's like blackberry and crushed red grapes. There's a scotch-whiskey alcohol heat that tingles the nose and let's off a similar aroma.  Taste & feel: this is a bad-ass full bodied brew that feels thick and downright syruppy. the flavor is dominated by a big malt explosion, sweet and buttery, there's a very green but dry feeling bitter hop that seems to be a bit more mellow than the 2006 version, which i think impoves this tremenously. The 9.6% alcohol feels more like 20 %, reminds me of scotch whiskey in feel and flavor to a subtle degree. It also has the oak-aged, smoked effect in the flavor as well. The malt is heavy and sweet, not DFH sweet but just enough to make your lips sticky. This brew is amazing with smoked gouda and extra sharp cheese. It really enhances the malt dominance.  DA: It's a sipper you need to enjoy slowly.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,IPAcraig,4.84,"Bigfoot 2006 Expedition  This one has been sitting my fridge for about a year.  Poured from a 12oz bottle into an oversized wine glass.  A - A beautiful deep orange, ruby color with a one finger head. Slight lacing.  S - Simply amazing. It makes me want to dive in. Hugely malty/sweet with a hint of alcohol and a tinge of peat and tobacco. It doesnt get much better than this. The hops are not laking in the aroma department either.  T - I love Bigfoot fresh, but I am glad I saved this one. Caramel, alcohol, and hops dominate. But htis beer has so much more to offer than that. Licorice and pine come through as well. Just a great brew, the bitterness has died down ever so slightly making it more balanced than I remember.  M - Mild carbonation, lending a semi slick feel to it. I like it.

140,2671,Slatetank,4.53,"2006 vintage  Presentation - Poured from a 12oz bottle with 6007 imprinted above barcode into a medium sized snifter.  A - Beautiful deep amber/copper ale pours with sufficient carbonation to produce a generous beige head with compact bubbles.  S - Fruits and wood make an immediate impression along w/ grapeskin and stone fruit odors. Hickory and boozy scents mingle with toffee and green apple aromas. Citrus hops do not hesitate to assert their aromatic presence.  M - Warm and boozy, sweet + sticky with mild to medium acidity and a blossoming effervesence.  T - Solid malt sweetness says HELLO! with an in your face hoppiness. The two join together in a sentimental marriage that frolics with alcoholic equilibrium. A great toffee sweet and woody dry essence is blended with grapefruity hop bitterness. Blends of multiple flavors such as tart and spicy are experienced. Candied pecans and sugar cookies come to mind as a malty spotlight shift occurs amid warming ale tasting temps. A great balance is achieved with a 1-alcohol, 2-hop, 3-malt punch.  D - Great drinkability for a potent brew. Hops are showcased as well as an effervescent mouthfeel. Would be one that may benefit from aging.

Intense hop flavors from grapefruit, pine, to pepper, there is just alot going on, thiese flavors linger on the palate for some time. A thin feel at the start, but it gains strength, and begins to roll to the bcak of the throat, leaving the palate dry. This is a solid barleywine, very good to sip on when it is cold outside.

Creamy head with some coppery tinges poured quite thick and rocky then faded to nice light ring around the edge of the glass. Barely any carbonation... some light frothy lacing...  Aroma - Lots of spicy piney hops, strong floral / perfume notes, peppery, herbal notes, caramel / honey sweetness, some burnt sugar notes, spicy fruits (apricots, oranges, some light figs), strong resinous notes, some saltiness, toasted bread, light biscuity malts, some faint leathery traces, grassy, quite a lot of alcoholic esters when the glass is given a light swirl...  Taste  Very strong peppery / spicy / floral hop bitterness to the fore - a real attack on the taste buds !! Once the hops have subsided pine hints appear.. also some very grassy notes, light honey and caramel sweetness, some spicy fruits (bitter oranges, tart apples, some figs), dark muscovado sugar traces, herbal, some anise, toasted bread, very little malts - nothing like the sweet malty English barley wines i'm used to... some woody notes, alcohol not too noticeable...  M&D - Quite sharp initially then mellows to quite a syrupy smoothness. Medium bodied... Certainly not the most drinkable beer due to the hop explosion and the high alcohol... it is quite refreshing though...

140,2671,bosco7,4.2,"Vintage-2007 Poured from 12oz. (perfect serving size) bottle into snifter. Deep cherry amber color; very pretty. Vigorous pour provides a nice two finger head that disapates quickly leaving a nice lace. The aroma of this beer is extremely complex; banana, pine cone, grapefruit rind, and lots of alcohol are a few.  Huge malt presence upfront; very sweet and fruity (banana, slight cherry flavor, and grapefruit). Harsh (though pleasent) resiny / piney flavors follow and finishes with extremely hot.  This beer is wonderfully viscous; making it impossible for me to consume more than one a night.  I tend to enjoy american barleywines on the young side when there is more of a hop presence. That's just me though. I do set aside a 6-pack for cellaring every year. --- 6-7 month update 6/20/07 (2007 Vintage)  In as little as six months this beer has transformed from a super hop-bomb that is a bit harsh into a smooth and elegant brew.

140,2671,becktone,4.85,"Vertical tasting of Bigfoot 2006 and Bigfoot 2007  Eye: 2007- Nice large head with great retention and great lacing. color is light brownish and crystal clear. Some light ruby hues. 2006- Creamy head, not much retention or lacing. I think this is due to the glass-I've never had a good head in this snifter....never been washed in the dishwasher either...nothing that could damage it..weird. Color is much different. Dark ruby-Garnet. I prefer the color of this one over the 2007.  Nose: 2007-Very very hoppy supported by strong malt background-notes of alcohol in the nose. 2006-Much different from the 2007 vintage. Hops in comparison are almost non-existent. Very very alcoholic...at the least it can't be missed. Strong malts are dominant in the aroma though they seem to be behind the alcohol in potency. Smells more like a hard liquor such as whiskey.  Tongue: 2007- Large influence of hops in the 2007 vintage. Under that alcohol is easily noticed. Strong malt backbone supports the strong hops. 2006- Obviously hops are toned down. Malts are much more in the foreground than the 2007 vintage. Alcohol is more evident than in 2007. Bitterness is more harsh, it definitely balances the malts out, however as my first vertical tasting it seems odd to me to to have a lot of bitterness with out the hop flavor, I'm quite unused to it.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: 2007: In all aspects of the beer-flavor and aroma especially pretty much the same as 2006 when it was fresh from what I can remember. However, right now side by side I feel that the body of the 2007 is a bit fuller. It also goes down much easier than the aged 2006-prolly b/c it is less alcoholic in taste. I will always be a fan of fresh Bigfoot. I prefer it fresh and I will probably discontinue to cellar Bigfoot b/c I prefer it fresh. This is a brew I could drink any time, however I see this brew as being harder to drink when aged-thats just me-and also being harder to drink in hot weather. Luckily there's a cold front producing snow in Cincinnati right now making conditions right for me to drink this. 2006-In my opinion harder to drink than the fresh Bigfoot. It drinks more like a hard liquor but it doesn't have quite the high alcohol content. Definitely drinks better than hard liquor. I find the body of this brew to be lighter than the 2007. Carbonation has toned itself down quite a bit.  All in all the difference in aroma and flavor is quite large. I didn't expect the flavor to be all that much different but I was surprised. Aged it is good, actually at this point I am beginning to get used to its flavor. I like it much more than I did, yet still I prefer the fresh, being a hop head and all.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Not that it's poorly made beer, but it's definitely for someone who likes the taste of somewhat bitter fresh hops. I do, and I'm really into this beer.

140,2671,Boppar,2.89,"Vintage 2005 bottle poured into my trusty pint glass. This is a gorgeous beer. It is a deep orange color, almost red. There is an impressive three fingers of head, which sticks around for awhile. Good lacing, great head retention.  When I popped the top and began to pour, my entire kitchen started to smell like pumpkins. This is a very pungent beer. But more than anything, when you get your nose right down in the glass and takea good whiff, this beer smells like honey. Maybe honey witha little pine resin in it, but mostly honey. At first it is intriguing, but the smell becomes borderline cloying (if a smell can be coying).  The taste is sort of like being kicked in the mouth three different times in three different ways. First, there's the carbonated, alcoholic kick. Then there's a veritable depth charge of maltiness (read: almost cloying), then there's a massive hoppy dry finish. While all three of these categories seem overdone in their own stage, I like the interim periods. The malty backbone comes as a sweet relief after the initial onslought, and the hops come to the rescue once the maltiness becomes too much.  More specifically: the maltiness is accompanied by the taste of pumpkins and acorn squash. There is a very nice mid-palate smokiness that transitions between the maltiness and the hoppy finish, and in many ways, the smokiness is the saving grace of this beer.  The overall taste of this beer is really a shame, because it has some intense and interesting flavors in all aspects, but they just don't seem to be balanced. The hops don't balance the huge malt presence, they just pour salt in the wound that is your palate.  In terms of mouthfeel, this beer is incredibly viscous. I'd say ""chewy"" as well, but it really seems like it doesn't want to be chewed. Imagine chewing molasses. It just wouldn't work.  Drinkability? Let me put it to you this way: I've been nursing this puppy for over an hour, and I've got about 4 oz left. For the trecord, there is still a very nice layer of lace on top.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,AustinBeerLvr,4.82,"January 2008 review:  Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a glass--served at cellar temperature.  First of all, what a difference a year makes! If you read my 2007 review of this beer, you might think I am not a fan of ""big"" beers. Well, I used to think I wasn't either, but please take a look at this....  This beer pours a beautiful dark, reddish color with an awesome head as well as lacing on the glass as it's consumed.  Seriously, the nose of this beer would be enough reason to get this brew alone. It is simply outstanding, as the awesome cascade hope notes as well as alcohol combined with some slight caramel sweetness are almost memorizing. Also, some fruity esters only add to the complexity.  The taste of this is in one word....INTENSE. But, it is intense in the best way a big beer can possibly be. Allow me to explain....  It starts off with a huge hit of the famous cascade hops, which have complex fruity, citrusy flavors. To balance this, a slightly sweet caramel like backbone makes its presence. That said, the hops are defenitely dominate and very complex, as this brew seems to have some citrus, peppermint, and a vast array of complex flaovrs as a result of the superior hops used to brew this beer. The alcohol flavor of this beer is very assertive---but in a good way. It literally compliments the hop flavor as if they were both combined to help finish this brew and contribute to its umptmost complex flavor and warming character. When the potent hit of alcohol hits the nasal cavity, you know you are drinking one ""big"" beer!  Oh man, what a beer this is! I thought things couldn't get better after the Celebration Ale, but boy was I wrong. This beer is, of course, a sipping brew, at whopping 9.6% ABV, but it is still very drinkable, as none of the flavors seem to outdue eachother. If I have the willpower, I plan to age a couple of bottles for two+ years to see how it changes. Again, that is, if I have the willpower to hold off on drinking one of the best brews on the planet earth.  July 2008 review (2008 vintage, aged for approximately six months).  This is one beer that I have aged the longest, as the barelywine style has become one of my absolute favorites within the past year. As expected, the beer's characteristics have changed a bit, but for the most part, after six months of aging, seems to be fairly similar to the bottles I tried when it was fresh at the beginning of 2008.  The superb hop character that fills the nose is still there, but the aging has allowed a bit more caramel malt sweetness to come through. As expected, this also holds true for the taste, as the malt character is much more present, and the finish not has hoppy as it was six months ago. That said, there is still the ample trademark hop bitterness that does an excellent job of balancing out this huge brew at the end.  Not only has the aging brought forth a more assertive malt character, but I also get more red-wine like flavors from it as well. The wine like flavors are much more present in the finish due to the mellowed out hop bitterness from the aging.  I am trying to decide whether I like this world class beer better as fresh as I can get it or with a bit of age. Well, to be honest, I cannot decide, because this brew is just awesome all around, with different tastes and characteristics to explore when its fresh and with some age to it. Obviously, with aging, you get less hop flavor, which arguably yields a more traditional bareywine flavor, but again, the trademark hop bitterness of this beer is one element of it that makes it the awesome brew that it is. My suggestion is to do what I am doing now, which is by it new (one it's available, of course), try it then (always remember that for best results, a barleywine should be served at cellar temperature), age one for several months, reflect on who it has changed, and then continue to age it longer, which is what I plan to do with my remaining two bottles. I plan to crack the next one opened around October or so, and then the last of the 2008 vintage around the beginning of the 2009, to see what a beer aged for one full year tastes like. Can't wait to see what is in store for this awesome beer!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,cproioi,3.26,The beer pours a lovely amber color with a light tan head that crowns the beer that leave behind sticky lacing. The aroma was largely of American hops giving it a red grapefruit aroma with a slight sticky malt notes that fight to be recognized. The taste gives off slight alcoholic notes with a red grapefruit taste that overwhelms all in the first taste with a malty backbone following in the middle. The mouthfeel was bitter with sugary sticky feeling that lasts a while. This is a slow drinking beer which is quite nice.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,dogger6253,4.28,"The body of this beer is a dark, amber/molasses color. My pour leaves a large, off-white head behind, very foamy and very inviting. Each sip leaves some on the side of the glass.  Floral hops takes the lead in the aroma, but is not overpowering. Other scents are allowed to develop; citrusy goodness followed by a little honey.  The first sip is sweet with honey, brown sugar and caramel the most noticeable tastes. Shortly after, pine and hops tear through for an incredible bitterness that lasts through the finish accompanied by a sweetness again at the end.  Medium bodied with light carbonation and is also a tad on the dry side, very nice feel, but the intense flavors and high ABV would make this one I wouldn't have many of at a time.

140,2671,wagenvolks,4.2,"Had some Bigfoot on tap with Trep at the Flying Saucer in Raleigh.  The beer goddess brought me an amber-copper hue of a brew that turned ruby red in the sunlight. A slim, tan head dissipated shortly after the first sip and left a nice, sticky ring of foam around the edge of the glass. At first, the aroma seemed more like an IPA than a barleywine, which was kudos in my book. There were big, sweet hop notes with citrus, caramel and pungent floral aromas.  The taste was a blend of the strange and familiar: Notes of tree bark, piney hops, alcohol, bread, barley, and gin. A crisp, well-carbonated mouthfeel met the palate up front and left a sour, liqour-esque bite to the back of the throat. Although I'm not a huge barleywine fan, this was pretty damn good.

140,2671,Jmamay22,4.6,"2008 Bottle Reviewed 3/08 Pours a ruby red orange with a full tan colored head. No lacing.  Absolutely wonderful hop scent. Fruity, piney and hints of caramel.  More hops in the flavor. Really can't say enough of their hop use. Lots of citrus and bitter sweet puckering. Comes off as more balanced than last years, but its Bigfoot and the hops are there.  Mouthfeel is medium and the tiny bubbles of carbonation prick at my tongue and seem to enhance the hop bitterness. Lots of alcohol, but its hidden well under the hops and citrus. Despite overwhelmingly hoppy it comes of as more than a simple hop bomb and has depth and complexity unmatched by any American Barleywine I've enjoyed.  2007 Bottle Reviewed 3/07  Appearance - Dark red, with a thick head that reaches for the glass leaving a nice sticky lacing.  Smell - Floral hops scent up front with slight syrupy/honey/brown sugar smell.  Taste - A piney hop taste followed with an aftertaste of something citric and alcohol. Can't decide if I'm tasting orange or grapefruit or what thats providing the citrus. Hops are clearly the emphasis, but do not dominate the palate and overall tastes amazing.  Mouthfeel - I'm happy this isn't a syrupy barley wine, which can be difficult to finish unless its pouring snow outside. Medium mouthfeel and light carbonation. I'm really digging the aftertaste on this.  Drinkability - Decent for the abv, but I think I would have trouble with more than one. Conversely I could see myself enjoying this beer regardless of the weather or my mood. I wonder if I could still find a case of this someplace local still because it would be well worth it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

An unlike many Barley Wines I've had in the past, this one is perfectly balanced and not syrupy or cloying at all.  The beer is the color of strong iced tea with a generous head. Delightfully smooth mouthfeel. The aroma is definitely dominated by alcohol and malt but there are some floral hops too.  The flavor is rich and complex. There's lots of hops (floral and bitter), toasted maple-ly malts and plenty of alcoholic warmth. I can pick up a little bit of pine and maybe a bit of a strong grapefruit aftertaste.  Very well balanced and matched with the smooth mouthfeel it is an exquisite beer to slowly sip and savor. Definitely improves as it warms.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Very malty with the alcohol presence becoming more apparent as the beer warms. The hops are still there but secondary. This is one sharp and bitter brew.  Slick to the tongue with a very light carbonation.  This is a big beer and to me, an acquired taste.

140,2671,beertastegood,4.55,"2007 vintage - I have come to the conclusion that many American barleywines, especially Bigfoot, do not benefit from long aging. This is a style that emphasize both hops and malt, and if you age it too long, the hops will fade too much.  Pours a deep burnished copper color with a big thick head leaving much lace on the glass.  Citrus, pine, lemony, almost spicy hops, with a sweetish caramel-toffee aroma backing it up. Hops dominate, but malt is well represented. Alcohol evident.  Intense resiny hops up front along with a big blast of intense maltiness - kettle caramelization, perhaps...Very piney hoppiness. Ethanol flavor comes in and makes its presence known as it all melds together for a intensely bittersweet hop-flavored finish. Leaves an aftertaste of powerful American C-hops.  Mouthfeel: medium-full with medium carbonation. Creamy with a slick feel on the tongue.  Drinkability - I like barleywine. This one is a drinkin' barleywine - well balanced.   I have really come to love this beer, and I now always look forward to picking up a case or two when it comes out every year. If Sierra Nevada asked me to pick a single beer for them to brew year round, this would be it - the best of both worlds, intensely malty and hoppy at the same time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

T - First inpression is very sweet, then as it moves through the mouth it ramps up with a serious amount of bitterness. A nice balance of hop and malt flavors - not overly malty as some BWines I've experienced. Strong but wonderfully balanced.

Taste is grapefruit hops and bitterness, brown sugar, orange, caramel, cream, and something strong and tasty on the backend which I can't identify. Hops are somewhat aggressive but not overwhelming. There is a definite alcohol warming in the throat but considering the abv its not overt. Spicey dry finish.  Mouthfeel is a rich and chewey mouthcoating medium.

Taste: Caramel on the tip of the tongue, then grapefruity hops, sweet middle, finish is dry and bitter.  Mouthfeel: Body just on the full side of medium, good carbonation.

Aroma:  Loads of sweet malt tempered by tons of fresh pressed red grapefruit juice.  Taste/Mouthfeel:  Man, this is a hop-bomb, more along the lines of a DIPA than a barleywine. Fresh grapefruit dominates the palate, scorching the tastebuds with its bitterness. Sweet jammy malts make their presence known by midsip, but its the hops that shine here. Finish is intensely bitter with hints of dark ripe fruit sweetness creeping in.  Sierra Nevada went a different way this year with their Bigfoot, throwing in more hops than you can shake a stick at.

T - Tastes of hops and caramel, some faint cereal malt and a little bitterness. The alcohol is not overbearing so it goes down much better than expected.  M - Some carbonation. Aftertaste lasts a long time, I like the aftertaste some spicy aftertaste that seems to last forever.  D - Not a beer you want to have all the time, but definitely a good example of this style.

140,2671,Melchizedek,3.6,"Pours rich reddish amber with a nice, dense beige head supported by streaming carbonation.  Aroma reflects a nice balance, with a strong hop push initially, plenty of pine and a sort of potpourri spice (from alcohol?). Keep your nose in there, though, and some toasty grains and nice beery malts come through. Lovely. In the mouth, the hops again come through strong, providing a bitter-herb note initially. Floral stuff. A little pine-sap in there, with a layer of toast in there somewhere. Alcohol burn definitely present. Mouthfeel is lightened by the carbonation, but slick with hops, a bit sticky after. Kind of numbing.  Maybe just a bit fresher than it needs to be... I feel like I want those hops to mellow a bit before I really enjoy this one properly. Maybe I'm not enough of a hophead to enjoy this as it's meant to be.

Beer is a deep orange to red. Decent lacing.  First thing I notice in the aroma department is a slight woody smell. I've detected this in some other older beers at the Falling Rock. Oxidization? That is followed up by some floral hops and caramel.  The caramel is the first thing to hit the tongue. It has a nice nutty undertone to it. The hop profile isn't very complex. Mostly just bitter, but it is nicely balanced with the malt.  Mouthfeel is very oily and creamy with a surprising level of carbonation to clean things up.

It's still good, but I've gotten so used to the aged ones that I was totally shocked by what I found.  Color is a vibrant deep amber/copper, thick lacey light tan head.  Aroma is a shower of hops - bright, spicy and bitter, along with sweet malt - caramel, cherry, berry, and chocolate notes. Everything rides the alcohol fumes.  Taste is sweet with alcohol, then bitter and dry. It really has more hop than I remember. That's why I need to drink a fresh one from time to time.  Body is pretty rich and full, but not too sweet by any means. I know I have a 2003 somewhere, I'll have to dig that one out soon.  Following is a brand new review of a very old bottle: Reviewd January 2nd 2008  1995 bottle a friend found five of them at a garage sale. He drank all but one. I was happy he decided to share it with me.  Surprisingly well carbonated for a 12 year old twist off, the creamy off white head dropped very quickly to a thin film leaving spots of lace. Color was a very hazy dark amber.  Nose was gigantic ester and hop spices, caramel molasses and citrus.  Taste was grapefruit, orange, cherries, and a whole basket of fruit, peppermint gum, clove, cinnamon, back pepper, a slight banana note, a little oxidation (far less than expected), and a very slight winey sourness.  Overall, past its prime, but fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable. The hops and alcohol were fully integrated into the mix.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Smell is dominated by a piny hops, with notes of the alcohol, sweet caramel, and the malt. Taste is much of the same; features the piny character, but with definite elements of the caramel. This is helped by a thick, almost syrupy mouthfeel. High alcohol presence, so sip this one slowly.

The aroma did not appear to be quite as pronounced as previous. I thought this years batch was a bit sweeter and more malty than 2005 / 2006. Still a huge citrus and pine taste but I wouldn't describe it as much as a hops blast as previously. Noticed a slightly oily aftertaste and mouthfeel. The mouthfeel is still incredibly rich.

140,2671,fank2788,4.28,"12 oz bottle into a pint glass 2007 vintage I was finally able to find some bigfoot and I'm really excited about giving this a try so here it goes. This beer pours out a deep red/brown copper color, a moderate pour yields a nice foamy head about two fingers thick that will dissipate slowly and lace a bit on the way down. The smell is all hops up front. A lot of grassy and resinous hop aroma is experienced, the hop aroma is so thick you can almost taste it. The taste itself is also very full of hops. The copious hop flavors hit first along with a strong bitterness. Then a touch of sweetness comes through followed by a bit of alcohol and the warmth associated with the alcohol. For a beer with a bitterness this high it is surprisingly well balanced. The mouthfeel is very full this beer tastes thick and coats the mouth well. Like many big beers drinkability is only good you need to take it slow with this one or the bitterness will just tear your mouth apart. I'm probably more a fan of English style barleywines but this isn't bad I'd definitely like to see how this one ages if my willpower proves strong enough to let a few sit for a while.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,John_M,4.38,"As barleywines go, this is just about as good as it gets. For me it's something of a mood thing; sometimes I prefer the sweeter style, sometimes the hoppier style. This is decidedly the latter and is just fabulous. This was listed at Max's as the 2006, which I would assume means that it is now one year old. No matter, this beer was very fresh tasting with a faulous hop profile. I find this beer to be very complex with all kinds of things going on. The first thing you notice is the sweetness, followed almost immediately by the blast of hops. Then you start to notice the alcohol and sweetness again, but the flavor profile finishes with a blast of hops. Incredible. This could almost be an imperial IPA it's so hoppy, but it's got the kind of maltiness and sweetness you just don't encounter in most DIPA's. The beer is a beautiful copper color, I don't believe I've seen anything else quite like it. The beer pours with a perfect creamy head that dissipates slowly. A beer to sip and enjoy. A consistent winner from Sierra Nevada.  Note: Recently had occasion to try two aged versions of this beer. On 5/9/09 I was fortunate enough to sample the 2002 and 1999 at Max's. Both versions had held up superbly well, with 2002 showing a bit more hoppy bitterness, coupled with ablack, bittersweet chocolate flavor. The 1999 was nearly still, with more of a soft, creamy milk chocolate flavor, but still with some noticeable hoppy bitterness on the finish.

Finishes with an assertive bitterness that lingers in the back of your mouth. M- Full but not heavy; appropriate for style. D- It's a big beer and it drinks like one.

The head was thin, a little less than a 1/4 inch thick but stayed that way almost the entire beer with great lacing.

You could taste cherries, a sweet malt flavor, a little hint of spice, and possibly a very slight hint of orange. The mouthfeel was good, with the beer being very thick.

The ale itself is a dark amber, approaching brown, with very little carbonation, evidenced by just a few small bubbles slowly rising to the surface. The aroma is sharp and uniformly hoppy. The malt shines through only minimally. On the first taste and all subsequent, this beer tastes very much like a double IPA. The malt character is certainly there, but it's huge counterbalance of hops takes it away from the sweetish thick maltiness that I've come to expect from barleywines. Still, it's quite good. Heavy body, but not so heavy as to force it into the ""one pint per session"" category.  Overall, Bigfoot is a barleywine that I appreciate. In the days of beer that pushes the limits toward thicker, heavier, and more alcoholic flavors, this remains drinkable and an entirely reasonable barleywine. I will drink this again.

Bigfoot poured slightly murky amber with a thin white surface skim of head. The smell was all rich malt but not particularly sweet. The taste was also rich and malty, sweeter then the smell and a bit vinous, but fades to a very hoppy bitterness. The alcohol is well hidden. The mouthfeel was good, medium bodied.

Rusty brown body with cascading bubbles, and off-white, nearly khaki head, and raised lacing patterns on the glass. Not many high abv beers can be described as such. In the nose I get a wealth of pine and citrus, with notes of vanilla and toasted malt. Alcohol sits in the background. When I first had Bigfoot about a year and a half ago, I thought it was over-the-top bitter, which it still kind of is, but now I can taste more than just an assault of hops. What I thought was once disgusting because of the hop character now just seems kind of all over the place with toasted malts, pine resin, and a finish that's both oily and overly sweet with a bitter that doesn't really balance out the sweet, so much as it conflicts with it. The beer is decent, for sure, but it's nothing I could get worked up over. Mouthfeel is full and mellow, but a bit slick for me. I don't have much interest in drinking this.

No head to speak of, and what there is retreats to a ring around the snifter immediately. Some lacing, though. The beer appears a bit murky. There's nothing unappealing about it, but nothing extraordinary either.  S: American hop aroma is the first thing to meet the nose, followed by ripe fruit and raisin. As it warms, there is a slight spiciness to the nose probably contributed by the alcohol but adding a nice layer of complexity. Very, very nice.  T: The nose might suggest a strong hop flavor, but the tongue instead meets fig, raisin, ripe fruit and malt. As that slowly fades, it yields to a nice driness butressed by bittering hops that manage to highlight the sweet maltiness of the first taste. Absolutely fantastic.  M: The mouthfeel is full and fairly heavy, but moderated by more carbonation than in most English versions of the style. The result is a very pleasant sensation on the tongue.  D: This is a sipper, and one is plenty. At the same time, I reach the bottom of the snifter with regret and wish I had sipped yet more slowly.

140,2671,Damian,4.07,"Drank from a 12 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Cambridge Wine & Spirits, Cambridge, MA  Poured a deep, slightly hazy, orange-copper with no head (just a ring of frothy bubbles).  Aroma was big and very fragrant. Super hoppy with piney and citrusy notes. In the background lay a stiff malty backbone with some sweet fruitiness. As the beer warmed, some alcohol also became noticeable.  Taste was similar to smell, except even more hoppy and biting. A touch of malty creaminess was noticeable on the front of the palate before the hops took over. Hoppy from start to finish with the strong, fruity, juicy and piney hop notes intensifying as they moved along the palate. The long finish was very dry, puckering, piney and resiny with a distinct, bitter grapefruit quality. This beer was a true palate shredder.  Mouthfeel was super rich, creamy and frothy. It almost felt fluffy on my tongue.  Drinkability was moderate. While this beer was quite flavorful and the 9.6% ABV was well masked, the intense hop bitterness was rather difficult to handle.  Overall, this was a good barley wine, but I would have preferred a more balanced offering.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,DaggerEyes,3.95,"2007 Vintage, got it for a measly $1.25 at the local corner store :)  Pours a ruby-reddish brown with a soapy small head, crazy sticky against the side of the glass  Wonderful smell, the only thing holding it back from a straight up 5 is that it is slightly too astringant, something that will surely mellow with a bit of age. Strong notes of berries, mostly strawberrys, a bit of rasberry, caramel, a nice subtle hoppy tinge, maybe a little bit of pine in there but just a little bit, great smell...  the taste was a bit of a let down after the nose it had on it...pretty blunt and mono chromatic, not as sweet as one would believe by the nose. Very Bitter and the hops that were faintly present on the nose come out in full force on the tongue. It's pretty young and the alchohol is very present. I'd be interested to see how this does with a few years in a cellar.  smooth, fairly round with just a hint of carbonation, Very dry on the finish, you might want to keep a glass of water near by.  Given the higher achohol content I can't imagine drinking to much of this but it's fairly drinkable as barley wines go.  I am tempted to put a few of these aside...I'm anxious to see how this matures it could really be a knock out in a few years time",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,kelticblood,3.88,2003 bottle  Being 4 years old it lost alot of it's head and carbonation. I've had this in my fridge for along time. The color is a Red/Brown and looks to be cloudy when held up to the light. Almost exceptional complex aroma with a great cherry and fuit smell. True to the style of a Barley Wine. It has mellowed out sitting in my fridge that long and the ABV is well-hidden . Lingering dry bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel lacks a crisp carbonated bite. Full-bodied and creamy with no signs of a watery texture. Due to the high ABV I cannot see myself drinking more than one of these before wanting to switch. Goes down remarkably smooth with no alcohol bite.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,kajerm,4,"2007 bottle, I've been wanting to try this one for a while.  Pours pale reddish-brown, a little bit hazy, and basically headless-- but it looks pretty nice. Slight notes of roasted malt, a little dark fruit, and somehting spicy-- cloves maybe? Oh, and booze. Definitely booze.  OK, tasting it-- shit, this is hoppy. I did not smell that one coming. Alpha acid bitterness and alcoholic spiciness are definitely the dominant notes here, with a shade of malt mid-palate that's gone as quickly as it appears. Lingering bitterness on the finish; not bad, not bad at all.  The palate is heavy, but if you buy a 9.6%ABV barleywine, I hope you saw that one coming. It's heavy, slick, and pretty chewy. The mouthfeel complements the aroma and flavor nicely.  This is a tasty beer, but one is enough for me. Drinkability is about what I'd expect at ten points of ethanol. That said, you need to get at least halfway into this one to really get it-- after habituating to the hops, this beer really starts to reveal itself and the balance and complexity are phenomenal.  rerate: Must have been a lousy pour, I got a nice head this time with about average retention and significant lingering lace. The nose is completely devoid of hops (it smells spicy and malty.) It's still hoppy as hell in the front and back, but it's pretty complex mid-palate-- some malt and lots of esters. Much more warming and alcoholic than I remember, but not in an off-putting way-- in this context, the booze is adding flavor and character. I wouldn't change any of the ratings, but I like it much better this time. It seems like Bigfoot is a different experience every time; I might have to try aging a few bottles.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,sacfly,4.5,"12oz, 2007 expedition on cap Pours a clear reddish color with a huge head (especially for a barleywine) of off white/tan bubbles. Strong aroma of pine and grapefruit hops. Taste is nearly in the hop bomb category. Very hoppy and bitter, but enough malt to add bit of caramel sweetness to the mix. Sweet in the way a grapefruit can be sweet. And the taste is primarily grapefruit. Bitter, but not overpowering in the aftertaste. The grapefruit lingers on the tongue. Great creamy mouthfeel. I loved it, but I also love grapefruit. They seemed to of amped up the hops this year. Im digging this one more than past editions.

140,2671,Cresant,3,"Poured this 12 oz. brown bottle into a becker glass. 2006 vintage. Cloudy/chill hazed (cleared later) golden brown body with a pillowy manilla folder colored head.  Smell was strong. Sweet malts, fresh grains. Baked brown bread.  Taste was alcohol, sugar, and mellow hoppiness. Hops were very present but they were far from being harsh. Barleywines are not my favorite style but I enjoyed this one. I believe I would like a fresh sample better due to my hop-headedness.  Mouthfeel was smooth and somewhat oily. Mildly carbonated.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,MaltyGoodness,3.7,"12oz. bottle - 2007 edition  Pours a clear deep amber with a reddish hue. A small tan head forms and recedes. Mild lacing on the glass.  Aroma is dominated by citrusy / grapefruit smelling hops. However, there is a rich smell of caramel malt that comes through - especially as it warms. Quite a nice blend of aromas.  Citrusy hops pounce from the start and bring with them a potent bitter bite. As the bitterness fades toward the finish, some of the caramel maltiness starts to come through. Even as it warms, the malt taste doesn't really come through as I would like. Full of flavor, lacking in balance.  Huge body, mild carbonation.  While I do love the blend of hops, I would have liked to see a little more malt flavor to balance it out.. Still, enjoyable to drink - but definitely no more than one in a sitting.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ZimZamZoom,4.45,"This is the 2007 vintage, poured into a goblet. A nice dark copper color with a fluffy looking white head that was big on the lacing. This thing clung to the glass the whole way around, lacing was almost solid.  I can smell the malty goodness of an American Barleywine in there, but it is simply overpowered by a big citrus hoppy aroma that almost makes my eyes water. Not really, but wow! A heavy bitter grapefruit aroma that goes on and on. I'd personally like this to be a little more balanced but it is a fresh one and I expect the hops would mellow with some age.  The taste is a giant mix of malts, alcohol, citrusy hop flavor and severe bitterness, pretty much in that order. This is a good sipper indeed as it takes several seconds for a single sip to fade away. The finish is long and harsh and wonderful.  Full bodied with noticeable carbonation, this is a highly sippable Barleywine. Glad to finally get to try it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Taste: Nice big malt sweetness, chocolate, caramel, ripe fruit, it's a balanced sweetness, hops come in, warm and bitter, herbal, finish is dry, alcohol is a background factor, warming.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, creamy and luxurious, the mouthfeel is out of this world, so creamy, very light carbonation.

Alcohol is apparent in the smell along with earthy hops.  Taste is of smokey and burnt flavors at first. This taste gives away to quite a kick of piney and citrusy hops.

Some sweet nutty malts bring up the rear to provide some balance.  T: Hop bitterness blends smoothly into sweet caramel malt. Alcohol ester present specifically if one exhales through the nose.  M: Moderate body. Crisp as opposed to creamy. Refreshing and allows for the taste to represent itself.  D: Simply put very smooth. Goes down very easily. Deceptive for such a strong beer.  As a big fan of big hops, malt and strong beers, this brew hits me just right. With more malt balance than IPAs and more kick than a stout or porter, this is a good representative of a solid American Barley Wine. This brew showcases a solid beer as a drink: thin enough to wash down some nice food while strong enough to have some personality and kick you in the face on the way down.

140,2671,beeragent,3.6,"2007 edition. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a snifter. The beer poured a deep gold, forming a 1 inch head, leaving medium lacing on the glass. The aroma reminds of a strong Belgian style ale, with its intense fruit smell, along with a good balance of hops. The taste is very complex. Flavors range from a slight alcohol taste upfront, to a sweet fruit taste in the middle, ending with a slight bite from the hops. Very interesting! The mouthfeel is thick and full. While I would not recommend drinking too many of these in one night (already did it, and regretted it), it is still a great beer worth trying.

140,2671,warmstorage,4.12,"2007 edition, $1.70 at the Utah State Wine Store.  12 ounce bottle, twist-off (to my continued homebrewer irritation), states 9.6% ABV.  Pours a deep mahogany with a beige head, moderately dense, leaves a bit of light lacing.  Aroma: piney resiny hop goodness, hot alcohol. Maybe a bit of sherry or fortified wine?  Taste: lots of that piney resin-y goodness that's in the aroma, hot, almost burning alcohol (but in a good way, for me.) Deep caramel, a small bit of citrus.  Mouth: tingly hot alcohol, moderate to high carbonation for style.  Overall: another excellent vintage of Bigfoot. It's raw and unkempt, like I like it. It feels like it has much more hot alcohol than the last several years of Bigfoot, and also less sweet malt. Honestly, I like the 2006 better (even when I drank it right off the shelf after it came out.)

Mouthfeel is quite chewy/earthy/sticky but I like that about this beer, makes it quite interesting each sip. Drinkability is definitely there for a 9.6 abv.

140,2671,MrHungryMonkey,4.94,"2007 brown twistoff 12er. Served in sniffer.  Deep ruby red, mostly clear. Yeasty guys floating around. Mild head, doesn't last long.  American hops jump out of the glass. A pleasant barrage of citric, piney, spicy, and floral bouquet. Sweet malt base: toasty nut and toffee/caramel. Light yeasty notes. Fruit character reminiscent of kiwi, banana, and grape. Simply delightful.  Full bodied, thick, and so smooth. Them hops are here and pack a wallop: all the afore mentioned flavors plus a significant bitterness. The malt base is sweet, nutty, and toasty. Noticeable warmth. Not much carbonation, mostly a smooth and thick creamy foam. Feels great. Finishes bitter and dry, the hop oils stick around. The flavors only get better as it warms.  Man, oh man. Smells wonderful, I really can't image a beer smelling any better. Tastes great: so strong and complex, thick and smooth, hop and malt. The hops are insanely strong, however they are not what I would label over-the-top. Their interlacing with the malt is beautiful and well-tuned.

140,2671,eberkman,4.22,"Pours almost a bright red into a snifter, producing a 1 cm head that recedes fairly quickly but leaving a sticky, tight ring around the edges. Nice lacing.  The nose is a big blast of strong, citrusy Cascade hops tempered with subtle malts and alcohol. The flavor matches well - a very crisp, hoppy start tasting strongly of grapefruit and pomelo with a huge malty/medicinal stretch down the middle giving away to a strong, bitter finish that lingers forever. A very complex brew.  Mouthfeel is sticky and fairly thin-bodied. A great beer for relaxing with at the end of a long night, but the high alcohol presence would detract from its sessionability. Which isn't what it's intended for anyway.  I really like this one -- it's personal taste but I prefer it to Old Foghorn. And it's much hoppier than any other barleywines I've tasted.

A strong, fruity nose of light citrusy fruits with apples up front. Strong alcohol presence in the nose, and more-so in the taste. The alcohol pierces through the fruit flavors and combines with the hops to cause a strong sting on the tongue. Slightly thick in the mouth with a warm and syrupy finish. Very bitter, hoppy aftertaste. A damn good sipper.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,rayjay,3.82,"Fresh 2007 bottle. A bit disappointing is the appearance, which is viscous, flat, and dull. Very deep copper hues just like I remember it. The flat body also makes the mouthfeel suffer a bit, and cuts drinkability. The nose: sweet carmel malts, generally malts galore, and volitile cascade hops like a fine NW 2xIPA. The body bears a huge barleywine-style malt tribute, making for one thick beer. Sweet, and a bit sticky too. Worlds apart from the British Old Nick types; they only have the big malt body in common, but even they are on opposite ends of the spectrum. Picture a hoppy ale, then distill it once, dry hop it to smithereens...e.g. Bigfoot ale. The hoppiness is what I love about this beer; pure fruity bitterness. As big as this beer is, it actually hides the alcohol quite well. Give this to a teenager and it may scare them away from beer forever.

140,2671,InsolublePancake,4.08,"A- Great reddish-brown hue with a generous off-white head and good lacing. I love the color of a good barleywine!  S- Quite sweet-smelling. Berry fruitiness and a touch of alcohol. Hops are actually fairly subtle.  T- Surprisingly well-balanced, considering the beer's reputation as a bitter hop monster. As far as barleywines go, it's definitely on the hoppy side, but it has plenty of malt to back it up. Characteristic barleywine flavors of dark fruits (figs and dates) are evident, as is a sweet cake-like maltiness. Hops add a bit of pine to the mix but really aren't an enormous presence in the flavor. They're most noticeable with the hefty bitterness they contribute throughout the beer, and seem to be masking some of the malt flavors.  M- Very nice mouthfeel. Nice and full, smooth, creamy, just the right amount of carbonation.  D- Not bad for a barleywine, but I wouldn't want more than one in a sitting. Maybe two depending on my mood.  This is definitely a good barleywine, although it certainly would benefit from aging. Once the bitterness calms down a bit, I imagine the flavors will be amazing. I definitely plan on laying some down. Even so, it is quite drinkable right now. Recommended if you like barleywines.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Love the Bigfoot graphics haha, alright, so I poured it into a typical pint glass and it looked fairly light compared to the hop oil I was expecting. Let me just say this has the most impressive head retention in a beer I've ever seen. Every sip left a thick ring in my glass, bravo on that Sierra Nevada! The whole glass was literally ringed! The smell was not as hoppy as some of Stone's more hoppy beers, but then you take a sip and realize thats not exactly right... The taste is overwhelming of hops and very little malt, just the way I like it! Except, not blown out of complete proportion... The mouthfeel is very thick, caused by the hop oil I'm guessing, and thats why I deem this beer a complete sipper. One of them gets ya feelin' all warm inside, but you chug this, you might be in for a lost of taste buds for the night...haha. Very well done, I must now try an English version of this style!

The body still didn't clear out, and looked to be an old oaky color with a rather fluffy tan head. But, man, that head hung on forever. Smell was still hoppy. I would have expected it to smooth out over a year, but there was still plenty of hops. Taste was fantastic. Smooth, malty, hoppy. It's a beer on steroids. Mouthfeel was full and chewy.

This is not a bad thing, as I can tell that this beer will be phenomenal in a year's time.  Mouthfeel is very good, thick, drinks almost like a DIPA.

I have sampled it in a nice wide mouth crystal glass as well as straight from the bottle. Freezing cold (put a bottle in the snow outside for about 4 hours) to a nice 65 degree temp. I must say there are many more flavors to be had at 65 degrees but is surely is very good cold as well!  Pours a nice dark amber. The taste is very strong sweet caramel and then the citrusy pine hops give you a bigfoot smack in the ass. Truly awesome. Finishes very smooth and somewhat dry. As the temp of the ale warms the alchohol lets you know it is there.  This is a very good barley wine young. I am going to try to save 4 of these bottles for a year and see what happens. But drinking them at this stage is very, very satisfying. Very easy drinking for such a high alchohol content. Almost dangerous. I rated the taste and drinkability a ""5"" because compared to other fine barley wines I have tried, for the style, this one takes the cake.  This one truly impresses me.

140,2671,Graebner,4.82,"2006 edition. Nice looking stubby bottle. Pours a orange-brown with a finger+ of coarse white head.  Smells like loads of hops. Also citrus rind, pine pitch, and a bit of caramel. MMMM.  Taste is devastating. Tastes of sweet caramel, but only shortly, as it's quickly smacked down by hoppy goodness. Grapefruit rind comes through, as does more pine. Tremendous brew, absolutely delicious.  Mouthfeel is also fantastic. The hops and the alcohol provide a slightly oily and very smooth feel. Finishes very dry, and dries your mouth with it. Very pleasant.  Drinkability is excellent, though the high abv will get you loopy.

140,2671,Kendo,4.27,"Vintage 2007.  A: Poured into an oversized wine glass. The result: a clear, coppery-red body with a 1/2-finger off-white head that disappears quickly, leaving some spots of soapy film resting on top. Very small bubbles rise to the surface. No lacing, but I find that's usually the case with this glass.  S: Very pleasant. Mild grassy, piney and citrusy hops up front with sweet dark fruit underneath -- perhaps powdered-sugar dusted berries. A slight waft of alcohol as well. There's something real inviting about the nose -- before every sip I inhaled deeply and really enjoyed it.  T: First impression: it has that Sierra Nevada taste to it. Green hops dominate the overall impression -- grass, pine and spruce. There is a bit of malty and fruity sweetness present underneath it all, however, as sweet berries and toffee-like malt tries to poke its head through the hops before being beaten down. Hoppy bitterness really lingers as a slightly minerally tang on the back and roof of the mouth. Alcohol is barely noticed early, other than a warmth in the belly, but as it warms a slightly mediciney alcohol presence is more notable.  M: Medium to full-bodied and well carbonated. There's a slight grittiness to the feel, especially at first, which I attributed to the carbonation and what seems like young, green hops.  D: Good. A little too brash right now, I suspect this hopped up barleywine could benefit from some age and be a little better balanced after some cellar time.  Notes: This is my first Bigfoot in years, as I've recently turned my attention to barleywines. The smell was just phenomenal, and all in all I enjoyed this solid offering from SN. It famously ages well, so I'm looking forward to trying more in the months and years to come.  3-22-08: 13 months later and the 2007 batch still has a strong presence of those sprucey, piney SN hops. I expected it to be more focused on the malt. It did seem to lose something in the nose, however; I seem to get more booze in the nose as well. Still solid and not all that much different from what I remember. . . .",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,bjohnson,4.5,"Vintage 2007  A: Pours a clear, but very dark ruby red color. Frothy half finger cream colored head with big bubbles in the middle. Nice retention that doesn't move. Sticky lacing. S: Grapefruit, orange rind, pine tar and sap hop notes are all very present. Spicy and a tad boozy. Powerful. T/M: Thick citrus notes. Hops all the way here--they take major precedence. Spicy on the palate with a prickly nature that lasts into the dry and bitter aftertaste. Very excellent showing by the hops. Sweet malt presence, with caramel notes, takes a back seat, even though it tries to exert itself. Juicy and oily mouthfeel with pine sap that sticks to the tongue. Very hot right now. D: A bit young, but I got a bunch of these and letting them sit will turn out to be a good decision. We'll see how it does in a couple of years. Still very tasty with the hops dominating the palate. A sipping brew for sure, but one I look forward to every year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,BigRedN,3.75,"2007 Edition  Appearance: Poured from the 12 oz stubby bottle into a pint glass. The beer is a darker orangish brown. My pour produces a solid 1 inch head which linger for a while before falling to a thin cover. Some lacing is left behind as I consume the beer.  Smell: Some sweeter malts in combination with some strong piney hop aromas, along with some dark fruits. Malts have a caramel and toffee aroma to them.  Taste: Disclaimer: I often find that SN tends to make their beers on the hoppy side of things. That being said, this beer is nicely hopped (piney and citrousy), while there still is a balance of some sweeter malts (the caramel that I smell I am guessing). A surprising balance IMO for a SN beer. Good, I just don't find it exceptional.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, alcohol is noticeable for me and causes a bit of a burn in the throat and warms my belly. Low in carbonation, feels ""heavier"" than it should. A bit brash and could use some mellowing, but I do not age beers, I drink them now; so I dropped my score a notch.  Drinkability: OK, I am scoring this lower in drinkability for two reasons. One - While this is a tasty beer I have one and am done. I do not want another. Two - As I mentioned, this one may do well with a bit of aging, but I don't age beers, I drink them right away. Also at $10 a six (here in Nebraska) it's a bit pricey for me to purchase.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,beerogre,4.25,"2005 Version.  At last...as I sample bottle 18, I find that the remnants of my case of 2005 Bigfoot have finally matured to perfection, almost two years after I acquired them, and I realize now that I should have bought at least two cases: One to test when it was ready and the other to fully savour.  I have been periodically trying a bottle to see how things were progressing, and up until this point the beer clearly had not reached that heavenly mellowness stage that I know will eventually arrive, all in its own good time.  My wife calls Bigfoot the ""Ear wax"" beer, and as disgusting as that description may sound, I have to agree with her that in its infancy it certainly is overwhelmingly reminiscent of that flavour. However, on offering her a blind tasting of the finished article this evening, she did correctly guess the beer and like me, was more than impressed with its remarkable transformation. As she noted, the bitterness is still there, but now there is also so much more besides.  Not such an ugly duckling after all...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Foxman,4.28,"2007  It pours a slightly hazy and fairly carbonated orange amber, reminiscent of many DIPA's. Three fingers of frothy light tan head deconstruct quite slowly. Shams of lacing pillow the inside of the glass.  In the aroma, dense caramel toffee toasted malt joins a touch of vanilla and spicy pine and dry citrus hops. A feathery floral note tickles an airy element of alcohol.  Upon sipping, it's malt first, thickly sweet and rich with caramel, vanilla, berry, and an earthy bit of currants. The hops are heady with spicy pine needles and dry grapefruit, both of which capably crisp the grain sweetness. A swarthy alcohol presence lays a port impression down before a glimpse of biscuit signifies malt's secondary push. The finish continues to dry to a lingering and gratifying bitterness. The flavor represents a well done and well blended effort.  Pretty much full bodied, the malt is thick and the hops of an oiliness that combine and coat quite nicely.  Often the Bigfoots (Bigfeet?) need some age. Sure, some maturity might be interesting with this specimen, but the sassy, edgy nature of this youngster is a breath of fresh Sierra Nevada air. Even in its tender years there's nothing not to like. And while the ABV may be beefy, it's worked in and warming. It's serious, but it drinks with a knowing grin. So it may end up wearing some age well, but I might not let it rest long enough to really find out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,velo343,4.3,"2007 Bottle  Appearance - Very dark crimson and brown. Fluffy beige head, lots of lacing on the glass.  Smell - A fantastic smell of pine and lemony hops with a bit of orange and grapefruit. Large malt character as well, mostly caramel, toffee, some light chocolate. Some dark fruits as well.  Taste - Wow. Lots of bitterness hits at first, but it is quickly counteracted by a very bready, caramel malt flavor. Lots of roasted flavor, then at the end of the drink, the bitterness hits again. Very thick and lightly carbonated, almost as if it was off a cask.  Drinkability - For how young this is, I found it to be a stellar barleywine already. Right from the looks, it has everything going for it. Great flavors that blended well, and I'm sure it will only get better with time. Got an extra bottle to lay down and I'm going to struggle not to open it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,MICAMD,4.4,"2007 Edition  A- Looks just how a barley wine should look. Dark amber, orange, red... I don't know why, maybe because its Valentines day, but I thought the color looked like juiced rose petals. The head was slightly yellow, mostly white and retains itself most of the way through the drinking of this. Leaves some great lacing.  S- Piney hops, but not overpowering. A little bit of grass. Great malt backing. Like caramel with pine needles tossed in- but in a good way.  T- Not too harsh at first. Man the hops linger. Good balance of sweetness and bitterness.  M- This does not leave your mouth. A little dry, but the alcohol is very well hidden.  D- This is a sipper for sure and the hops are a tad hot. I am going to have to revisit this... I am very anxious to see how this ages. I have my hopes up.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ddarden,4.5,"2007 Bottle poured at cellar temp into a oversized goblet. Deep mohagany and not quite clear with offwhite head that slowly recedes leaving thick lacing. It smell sweet with a blend of pine and citrius hops. Hint of alchol mixes in with the very nice aroma of this beer.  The first sip has a very nice hop punch and quickly fades into a perfectly sweet malt middle. It finishes with a familiar SN hop bitterness that continues to coat the tongue. The alcohol is present in the taste, but is very well blended and adds a nice dimension to the overall flavor. 2007 ranks at the top of my list for Bigfoot years while still fresh.  The mouthfeel is chewy and coats the tongue nicely. The overall drinkability is excellent for something at close to 10% abv. I could easily sip this beer all night. I am planning on cellaring a good bit of this year because I feel it has potential to really mature nicely. Excellent job this year SN and looking for to having this many time again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ArrogantB,4.72,2007 bottle pured into a snifter. Yes! I have been waiting for this one for awhile now. The color is nice amber-red with a short white head that needed a little coaxing. The smell was slightly piney and really awesome. I actually had to sniff the beer for a couple minutes before I took my first drink. the taste was very hoppy pine with a slight hint of bubblegum. I don't know where that comes from but I have detected it in Ruination at times. I didn't get any of the chocolate flavors that are showing up in the 06 right now. This beer was amazing fresh and it will probably only get better.

140,2671,IntriqKen,4.63,"2007 Vintage. Fresh Granted, my tastes have changed over the past few years, but this one taste the best of all of the Bigfoots I've had. Crack the top and immediately get hit with the very fresh smell of citrus and pine hops. Pours golden amber in the glass with a half finger of off white that melts very slowly to very, very sticky lacing. A nice map traces the drink down the glass. The tongue is hit with sweet amber malts and brown sugar with citrus hops all at once....swallow slowly and go through phases of sweet malt, brown sugar, then grapefruit peel hops....pink grapefruit....more grapefruit peel...then a nice drying with only a hint of the sugars left. Creamy mouthfeel. The perfect American barleywine? Hmmm... Damn close.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,montageman,4.15,"2007 bottle. Poured into a pint glass. I just bought this last week, but I think it's only been out for about a month, so this is relatively fresh. Pours a nice red/amber color with a nice solid head that is not too big but leaves tremendous lacing and is really sticky on the side of the glass. Smell is extremely floral with a some pine and maybe even a bit of soapiness - I like it though. Taste is hops, hops, and more hops with some grapefruit rind in the finish (there's an initial sweetness that gets slaughtered quickly by the hoppiness). Some aging would definitely tone this down. Mouthfeel is nice, almost chewy - the carbonation lends a nice crispness. Even though this is super hoppy, it is quite drinkable as a sipping beer. This is one to be savored. Highly Recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Head slowly disappears, leaving good lacing behind and after every sip. Smells like a super hopped IPA. Tastes like a super hopped IPA, with the barleywine sweetness sneaking in towards the end. Poured with a slight chill (about 50 degrees), but flavors started opening up the warmer it got. For a barley wine, it was incredibly drinkable.

140,2671,neonbrown82,4.74,"After reading my review of the '05 (my first barleywine ever) and realizing that I skipped reviewing the '06, I thought I would write a new one. Besides, this year's is quite different than the last. I had an '06 a few nights ago and it still seemed much more harsh and abrasively bitter than the '07. This is probably the best vintage of it I've had, which includes only the past three years.  The beer pours to a nice ruby color, almost brownish. Quite clear when held to the light. Very little apparent carbonation. Has a smallish head that retains to a film. Quite a washy lacing.  The smell is amazing. Almost as if they used different hops this year. Has a very juicy grapefruit hop aroma, not quite as resinous as last years. Smells like they used some Amarillo, Simcoe, or Summit in addition to the familiar Chinook and Cascade. The bitterness is not as rough and abrasive. There is a hint of raisiny malt underlying the hops as well, like special b and biscuit. Sweet with a hint of alcohol.  The taste is equally brilliant. Very juicy up front with a very clean hop bitterness. The '06 I had a few nights ago has a much rougher hop cohumulone even after having aged for a year. The malt is sweet up front with a slight hint of raisiny malt, characteristic of most barleywines. The alcohol is definitely there in the finish, but it is still quite well hidden given the strength.  The body is quite thick. The carbonation is sharp on the palate. Has a nice warming alcohol sting, but still quite mild for the strength. Very drinkable for being so strong as well. I will be interested to see how this one develops over time, but given how much I am enjoying it, I think I might have to buy an additional case. Afterall, I like this at least twice as much as last year's, and I only have one left out of my '06 case.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

A nice sweet caramel and lively piney and grapefruit hop aroma with some alcohol in the nose as well. The taste is incredible! Hop heads rejoice, this beer fulfills any craving for hops one might have. The hops dominate the start and make way for a little apperance from the malt and then the hops are full throttle all the way through the finish and linger for quite some time on the palate.

Hops certainly dominate and hint to you what is stored ahead.  Taste. Hops have a good bit of bittering. A bit more grapefruit with some pine. Aftertaste is still hoppy, but slightly sweetens up. Alcohol become more appearant with a warming sensation, but still hides it decently.  Mouthfeel. Body is full with a decent amount of carbonation. hops certainly dominate, but the malts can hold some of it's own.

140,2671,RootedFool,4.5,"2007 vintage.  As soon as the beer evacuates from the bottle into my goblet, an immediate kick of grassy hop aroma smacks the snotty crust off of my face, buttressed by a substantial malt foundation (rum-bloated raisins, warm cotton candy). The hops, once I dig my nose into the brew, become more complex than simply ""grassy"" -- they're huge here -- an entire landscape of freshly peeled citrus rinds and cut grass, pinches of pine resin -- huge -- along with a mild flash of alcohol heat. The color's a translucent russet, has a sheen to it; the head's at least an inch tall, tan, and deflates slowly leaving curdled swaths of lace on the goblet walls. The taste opens from the periphery of my palate, for a split second, before the onslaught of hop bitterness caves in at a deliberately massive pace, like sucking on a thick wad of liquor-drenched grapefruit rinds that still have a bit of flesh, juice, adhered to them. The middle brings out the malts; they press through, in thin ribbons of caramel and prune, deep from the underbelly of the hop tsunami that's so intense even the roof of my mouth feels numbed. Mind you, this is entirely pleasurable to me. Bigfoot is violently sodomizing my mouth! I look forward to it every year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Tasting 1 - Feb 10, 2007 - 3.55 --- Clear and vibrant raspberry red hue with a tan colored head that fizzes to a thin rim along the glass. String and spotty lacing along the glass. An aggressive pour yields a one finger head with popping bubbles along the surface. The head holds well.  Very sharp hops align with strong alcohol vapors. A little bit of a dark candy scent is also there.  Starts out very tame, with almost no flavor, with a bit of toasty grain showing up a bit late. About midway through, a blast of sharp and acidic hops take over. There is not as much hop flavor as there is bitterness. The malts seem almost nonexistent at this point. A little bit of alcohol shows up at the end. Medium bodied with very low carbonation, leaving a very syrupy and oily feel. The finish is completely hops, leaving a very strong presence. The bitterness lingers for a while after each sip, along with an herblike flavor.  Ultra fresh, and maybe too fresh. The hops are extremely potent at this point, and I think long-term aging would benefit this one. I'm curious to see how much the malt shows up after a while, especially since I couldn't taste them in this round.  Tasting 2 - March 11, 2007 - 3.7 --- Clear and ruby, the head is still a little fizzy and short, and ends up as a rim along the glass.  The hops are the main show, yet not as sharp as they were before. A little bit more of the candy aroma can come through.  Immediately a sweet syrupy fruit flavor emerges, then slowly gives way to a sharp citrusy flavor and bitterness from the hops. A little bit of butterscotch comes out as well. The feel is still the same. The finish is still full of lingering bitterness.  It seems after only a month a little the complexity has increased a little. The hops are slightly less dominating, and the malts and sugary characteristics are coming out more.  Tasting 3 - April 14, 2007 - 3.7 --- Still clear, ruby, with the hops running the show in the aroma. The head is thin and doesn't present much.  In the flavor, the hops are still extremely dominant, even moreso than the last tasting.  Not much has changed since the original tasting. I may reserve the rest for a longer term testing, to give the hops a better chance to mellow.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The color and clarity give no idea of what you are about to taste. The hops jump out as soon as this beer hits your tongue and they are complimented with a rich maltiness followed by a very bitter aftertaste.

140,2671,bigdeuce,3.66,"Wow, this is strong as hell. Pours a nice red color with a massive head that laces all the way down the glass. Smells of mega hops and is very malty as well. It is a little unbalanced toward the hoppy side, but that is the style. Tough to drink more than one of these as the alcohol shines through, hard!

140,2671,mithrascruor,4.32,"12 oz. bottle poured into an oversize wine glass.  Appearance: Pours a ruby/brown. Dense but thin tan head that turns to a lace (and leaves a lacing on the glass as well).  Smell: A strong, nice, and interesting aroma of hops and pines. A hint of citrus is also present.  Taste: Strong and good! A very hoppy flavor kicks in first with a strong piney aspect and citrusy backing. There's also a milder taste of roasted malts that becomes apparent later. Though definitely on the hoppy side, I find this to be well-balanced for this type of beer. Aftertaste retains some of the bitterness, but also the slightly smoky taste of the malts. A tad bit of alcohol flavor is present, but it's far from being overwhelming.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and somewhat warm, with a nice (though very light) carbonation.  Drinkability: Obviously you'll have to drink this slowly (given the strong alcohol and taste., but the beer lends itself quite well to such drinking.  Very nice barleywine that I'd certainly get again.

140,2671,Talisker,3.35,"2007 edition from a 12oz bottle.  An excellent beer hiding in here - a beautiful marriage of American hops with a thick malt and old-fashioned barley wine feel. But it might not be ready for prime time.  Pours into the brandy snifter a dark red color with a medium thick head. Nice lacing throughout. Nose of unmistakably American hops - citrus, some pine - with an alcohol and sweetness saying this is not just an IPA.  Taste is certainly complex, but I find it a little harsh, with a bit of an unintegrated edge - hard to find the malt. Maybe some age will mellow it?  Finish is definitely a barley wine - there's an alcohol warmth, even bite, that can catch you by surprise. A drying astringency lingers. Obviously not intended by a session beer, but the slight edge and alcohol bite knock it down on drinkability.  Still, if you want a distinctly American take on the style, then you'll like this.

Fantastic aroma of Cascade hops dried in an oast that has baking candied fruit air blown through it. Later, the notes of toffee and alcohol come through.  Slightly hot, bitter finish over a creamy, roasted crystal base and some pithy hop flavor in the middle.

An explosion of fresh and piney hops with a backnote of grapefruit and a solid dry malt background. There are also notes of bitter orange and an undefinable meaty taste as well. Delicious.

140,2671,1whiskey,4.92,"2007 Vintage.  12 oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass. Huge billowing head (perhaps I overpoured) caps a brilliant copper color.  Smell is of fanatastic pine, resin, and pineapple notes. Reminds me of Stone 10th Anniversary Ale.  Taste is laden with huge hop flavor, but does not overwhelm me with bitterness the way a young 2006 Bigfoot did. In fact, I can cut through the bitterness to easily detect all of the elements in the nose, as well as date and raisin notes. A huge malt backbone holds it all together, enveloping all that hoppy goodness and propelling your taste buds into sweet oblivion.  Slick and oily on the palate, this has a pretty hefty body. Not much carbonation remained after my fitful pour, but just enough to dance around on my tongue.  Drinkability? AMAZING. Especially for how young this is. Young barleywines should not be this drinkable. I could get myself into trouble with this.  I don't know if my taste has changed this much in a year or if it really is that different, but I much prefer this to the 2006 version.

140,2671,Jwaks,2.32,"Serving : 12oz bottle with 2007 on the cap, no freshness date.  Significant effort is required on the pour to squeeze a finger thick head from this vibrant orange tinted amber brew. Spirited very fine bubbles sprint up through the low viscosity body to meet a scant white frothy cap ringed by a thin sticky white lace.  Overwhelmingly pungeant, bitter hop aromas assult the nose quickly followed by odors of ripe viney fruit and strong solvents. Subtle aromas of malt and bread break free from the overpowering and dominant hoppy and solvent character.  Young, rough and raucous, this beer thrashes the palate with intense, unrelenting bitter hops and unripe vinous fruits that just won't give up even in the aftertaste. Green, leafy hops, lots of lemon zest, and a healthy dose of warming, peppery alcohol hit the tongue on the dry, long-lasting finish. Wow, this beer's bitter, vinous character hits you like a ton of bricks, it has the finesse and grace of a 40 ton truck. It is entirely unbalanced leaning heavily toward hops and bitterness, where are the malts and barely?  Very tough and chewy in the mouth, it is medium to full bodied with a great ability to coat the palate. With so much bitterness, leafy hops and slightly sour viney fruit this one is far from smooth and creamy.  Wow. This was a surprise after reading all the sterling reviews of this brew. I have a feeling this one will require at least six months to a year of cellar age to shed its youthful vibrance and begin to be drinkable.

140,2671,Cadyfatcat,3.77,"Pours a deep brown beefy bullion style with a little lacey brown covering. Smells of mirepoix, raspberries, blueberries, tea, evergreen foresty hops. Taste is huge. Inescapable bitterness throughout. Tangy unsettling taste of a ripe barleywine. Rotten fleshy fruit - strawberry, plum, and peach. Hopping is adequate to combat initial tanginess, dry green wood type bitterness. Breath out and the 9% + can be felt escaping your esophagus. I've had an older vintage and remember it being better.

Nose: Citrus hops, rine qualities, alcohol, some caramel malts.  Taste: Little sweets malts are quickly overwhelmed by an intense dry pine bitterness that does a long dance on the palate. Hot alcohol also warms the belly, as well as a punch of malt and sugar after the initial burn subsides. May need a little while to calm some.  MoutH: Hot and full.  I'd say this may be much more drinkable in a few months, though i must admit i'm not very schooled on barleywine.

S: Hops and bourbon-y malts with a strong scent of spices. A mild fermented sugar note weaves in and out. Notes of wood and caramel are noteable when sought.  T: Strong, powerful complexity. Not for the faint. Wood and bourbon flavors push the palate to near asphyxiation, with caramel malts, sweet fermented grains and rotting dark fruit flavors filling in after the inital wave of flavors.

Aroma is of sweet malt and pine hops. Intense taste-trademark Bigfoot of intense hoppiness and with sweet malt in the middle and a bit of sting on the aftertaste.

140,2671,BlindPig,4.26,2007 edition A- Thick creamy tan head on a clear deep ruby body. S- Huge amount of pine and grass hops. There is also a pretty big citrus hop aroma also. Some light caramel malt behind all of it. Grapefruit and pine are the most dominate aromas though. T- Huge pine hop flavor. Some citrus hops manage to make there way through and make sure they are known too. They come through as a big grapefruit rind flavor. The pine hops just stick to your mouth for a long time leaving a big bitterness alone with the taste of pine and grapefruit. All of this is on a big malt body. The hops do come off stronger but the malt manages to hold its own. Some hints of caramel body can be found in it. Alcohol also tickles the tongue and a very light calm warming is left afterward. I would never guess it was a 9.6% abv though. M- Big full body that is sticky at the same time. Low carbonation. D- This is really good. I do prefer them aged though. It is almost like two different beers. Both are very good but fit their certain moods.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,cbn,4.08,"Pours slightly syrupy, fairly cloudy deep amber-russet. Minimal head dissipates quickly.  Sweet, dry cereal and molasses malt followed by citrus, floral and grassy hops. I strain my olfactory to discern these aromas, even as the beverage warms.  Black pepper, darkfruit (blackberries), coffee and bitter yeast follwed by cedar wood, lemon and grapefruit, an all-out assault on the taste-buds!  Rather cool and creamy, smooth and slightly oily leaving the hop on the tongue.  very enjoyable, drinkabilty is only limited by high ABV.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,jpkoch1962,3.41,"This is from the 2006 vintage I bought a year ago. Pours a clear dark copper with a short lived brown head and lacing. The aroma was a mixture of bitter hops and alcohol fusels - remnds me of a sweet brandy. The taste matured from last spring, as the hops mellowed quite a bit, but not enough. This was like drinking a bitter brandy. Way too much alcohol up front, along with very Cascade hops(grapefruit, pine solvent bitterness) dominated the entire brew. Way out of balance. One positive thing about to say was the strong malt base. Even though it couldn't quite keep up with the hops, a sweet toffee like taste could be detected- thanks to the near perfect carbonation. While this is a hopheads dream, I find it a bit too much, if not poorly constructed. If I wish to drink grapejuice soaked pine needles, I go make it myself. Perhaps another 2 years in the cellar would have helped, but I doubt it. The overpowering bitterness is here to stay. Not intended to be a session beer. I prefer the English Barley Wines, but for hopheads, this is your thing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,dherling,4,"An '04 at Andy's, on tap. Lovely.  Poured out a reddish clear color, not much head, but strangely, lots of lacing. The nose was big, lots of hops, green and bitter, some alcohol, but not as huge as I thought it would be. The taste was pretty big, warming, with sherry, raisin, hops, pine, and a tiny bit of alcohol, more from the warmth of the mouthfeel than a particular taste. A gentle giant.

Nominal head that did last down to the bottom of the glass. Nice fine lacing. The smell was of hoppy alcohol, and fruits. Very nice! Taste was of a great blend of strong malt and hops. Strong alcohol kicker as well. Again very nice. The brew felt thick with little carbonation. Despite the heaviness and alchohol content of this beer I found it extremely drinkable.

Very spruce like aroma. residual hop aroma with a deep, resin laced, slightly malty scent. Quite malty flavor. Winey, somewhat oakiness to it. Fairly bitter but none of the ""fresh"" hop bitterness to it that it has when new. Seems like the alcohol comes out as the years go by. Astringent,sort of dry mouthfeel to it. The standout hop character and huge malt flavor has definately subsided. The dryness an astringency knocks down the drinkability in my book. Still quite enjoyable after 6 years.

140,2671,goschool,4.34,"2006 Vintage: Almost a year old.  Appearance: The pour is a slightly hazy amber with a very minimal amount of head. It's starts out as a thin ring of lace and fades from there.  Smell: The nose is malty with quite a bit of fruit, citrus hops, and hint of alcohol.  Taste: The malts have caught up to, and overtaken, the hops since this first came out. The in flavor from toasty to fruity to sugary sweet and the hops bring mostly grapefruit with a touch of pine. A warming alcohol comes in near malts rangethe middle, goes away, and then comes back for the finish.  Mouthfeel: It's thick, chewy, and sticky with low carbonation, but a prickly texture.

140,2671,friendofthedevil,4.35,"Excellent Barleywine from Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. Have had this many times straight out the bottle while enjoying the natural world. Very hoppy with a slightly fruity taste. Dry feeling in the mouth, likely due to the high alcohol content.

140,2671,strangefate,4.02,"2006 edition.  Pours dark brown with a great cream-colored head that retains very well and laces all over the glass. Smell and taste are both very malty, lots of caramel character, and though chocolate malt is not used, the combination of malts gives a hint of it in the smell and taste. Since this is almost a year old, I guess the hops have calmed down a lot because I don't detect an amazing amount of hoppiness like others say is present when the beer hasn't aged. The malt is king in this beer. Dark grapefruit aroma and taste is also present. Very full-bodied and a very complex taste. The alcohol content is masked very well - it's a strong beer and it tastes strong, but not of strong alcohol, of strong malt. This one drinks pretty easily, you probably won't finish it as fast as other beers, but you'll be able to drink a few more of them afterwards. Especially if you're a badass like me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,oakbluff,4.44,"Vintage 2006 Poured into a medium sized red wine glass. Ruby coloured, with little head and quite a few little floaties (my bad for dumping in the whole bottle). Seems to have decent lacing on side of glass though. Smells like hops with a side dish of hops. I've had this bottle aging since late winter. The first sip tells me that it still packs a mighty hop punch, which I don't mind at all! The taste is still heavy on the bitter hops, but I don't think its unbalanced at all. Has a nice oily feel on the tongue. Very different from the last barley wine I had which was an english style and much more malty. But this is from the west coast so what do you expect? I could drink two or three of these no problem. I have two more I'm saving (trying to save) for another year or so to see how it ages.

Minimal lace floats atop the beer.  Smell: Very floral, bursting with aroma. Pine. Honeysuckle in the background. Other floral aromas present as well.  Taste: Explosive like a 2006 Bigfoot. No changes here. This is a hop bomb of a beer. My tastebuds are obliterated with bitterness. Pine and flowers are so explosive. Interestingly, there is a malt backbone to this beer. As I drink, I have to keep reminding myself that this is a barleywine and not a DIPA. It really does taste like a DIPA.  Mouthfeel: Bitter and full of alcohol although it's low in alcohol for a barleywine. I could see this beer being incredible after 5-10 years. It's not too harsh to drink now, but I think it would see improvement over time.  Drinkability: Not high marks here. It is hard to drink multiples of this beer. Needs to smoothe out after some cellaring. Interesting brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Sweet malt and sticky honey smell as well. Taste was a bit thin, but still good. The alcohol became more present and the peach/apricot moved to papaya and leather. Earth tones finish it out.

Into a pint glass, pours a lovely opaque reddish copper with a half thumb of partly bubbly, partly frothy-like head, receding to a thin film. Lacing is more than when new, spotty bubbles as it drains. Aroma is a solid floral hop presense, piney, oil and grapefuit, some alcahol apparent.  In taste, the hops mellow down a bit, and a nice and conplex warming alcohol and sweet malt due take charge. The hops aren't about to be showed up though, giving some solid pining through and through and good bittering through the middle and end and finishes a little dry. The mouth gets a little thinner if I remember the most recent one I had, much warmer, smooth and kind of crisp even at four years.

140,2671,kimcgolf,4.12,"Poured to a hazy dark orange color, with medium off-white head that hung around for most of the drink, and then reduced to good lacing. Aroma was very pleasant, of malty, dark fruit, with hints of the alcohol at the beginning. Flavor was a little spicier than I expected in a Barley Wine, but was a pleasant surprise, and was a nice addition to the dark fruit taste. As beer warmed, the alcohol continued to make itself more known in both the aroma and taste, and blended nicely with the malty sweetness. This all worked together to leave a nice, smooth, warming finish and pleasant aftertaste.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,wcudwight,4.66,"2006 Pours a cloudy ruby, mahogany and cherry wood color. Thin head with minimal lacing. Smells like a candy apple. The malts dominate the taste at the beginning. Lot's of caramel and very candy natured. This is a very sweet beer with some toastiness. From the middle to the end the taste transitions to a more citrus and piney hop flavor. Can definately feel the bitterness and hop bite at the end. Just a touch of alcohol in the finish to add some warming. Aftertaste is mostly the hops with a hint of the alcohol. Mouthfeel is big, thick, chewy and filling. This is easily the most drinkable barleywine I've had yet and maybe the most drinkable high abv beer I've had. Highly recommended.

It pours a deep ruby red, with a nice head and light carbonation. Even after a year there are a lot of hops in the nose, as well as hints of alcohol and rich malts.

Finishes with a moderately hot alcohol finish.  Medium bodied with pleasant oiliness and lingering piney dryness in the finish.  Pretty easy to drink. One or two at most, mostly due to larger alcohol content.

140,2671,Dizzy,3.82,"2006 Edition - From a bottle  Pours reddish brown with off white head leaving lacy on the glass. Aroma is citrusy hops, carmel or toffee like malts and alcohol. This beer is very, very bitter. There is a lot of malt here, but it is overwhelmed by the bitterness. Leaves a signifcant alcohol burn on my throat. This definately needs to sit a few years and it will probably be better. It seems like the bitterness may be masking malt complexity. I have some 04 and 05, I think I'll try those soon and compare.  Revisiting this beer years later. Drinking a 2009. It still had carbonation and no off flavors from oxidation I can detect. The hop aroma has disappeared over the 9 years, it is still bitter and very sweet and malty. I've saved these for years but I think I've decided I do prefer this beer when its fresh or only a few years old.

Medium bodied with a nice carbonation tingle. Coats your throat but nothing to thick. Can feel the alcohol as it goes down. Actually pretty nice.  The drinkability is good for such a powerful ale. At 9.6% this stuff goes down pretty easy. It's more of a sipper but I could sip on a few of these in a night and be perfectly happy.

140,2671,sockeye101,4.27,"2002 vintage  I was not sure what to expect from a BW of this age, but what I found was a smack upside the head from this beer, very nice!  Appearance was a deep cloudy orange/amber color and a nice offwhite head that left a nice lace. Aroma was heavy in the roasted caramel department, with fruitiness, and hops. Taste was not what I was expecting...I expected something ultra smooth with moderate bitterness. But what I got was a smack of hops, a tongue sizzling bitterness with alcohol and then a smooth roasted caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel was nice and chewy. Overall an excellent barley wine, but not on the level of Stone OG in my opinion.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

T- Slightly more carbonation than I'm used to, but then, this is a barleywine ""style"" ale, not a true barleywine. Some nice fruity notes, plum, raisin, cherry, but the hops dominate in the finish with mostly citrus and pine.  M- Slick and thick.  D- Kind of a cross between a real barleywine and an IPA.

140,2671,dblinkhorn,4.15,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my Stone Old Guardian specialty glass. 2006 vintage. Be careful, because there is yeast at the bottom, unlike almost all other Sierra Nevada beers.  Appearance - A thin tan head caps the crystal-clear honey amber colored beer. The head dissipates quickly to a layer of lace on top of the beer. Little lace is left as you drink this stuff. A few carbonation bubbles rise to the surface, but not much.  Smell - Reminds me a lot of Stone's Arrogant Bastard Ale, at least in the smell. Grapefruit and other citrus notes right away. Some bitter hops aroma and a grainy malt aroma come through nicely.  Taste - So you taste this stuff, and you think: ""not so barleywine-ish."" But when you reach the finish, it comes alive. As soon as it enters your mouth, it again really reminds me of Arrogant Bastard. Strong grapefruit character and other citrus. Strong floral and super bitter hops come through as you swallow and breathe. Indeed the finish is dominated by ultra-bitterness from the hops. Some slightly sweet cooked malt character starts to surface as the finish progresses. Earthiness, a strong bitterness at the back of your tongue, and a lingering malt character make up the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Full-bodied and velvety in the mouth. The carbonation is very nice, and lends some much-needed refreshing traits to this very strong ale.  Drinkability - An extremely flavorful beer that is extremely bitter. Be ready to wake your tastebuds up with this one. I can't imagine drinking much more than one of these, even though it is very good.  One of my favorite barleywine style ales. They loaded this thing with tons of bitter hop character, and a very nice grainy/cooked malt flavor that helps to sooth your mouth in the finish and aftertast.

Cream-colored head to about 1"", with lacing around the glass.  S: Alcohol, lots of sweet malt, slight floral hop character. Smells delicious, very classic barleywine scents.  T: I was worried that this would be lightstruck, having been on Total Wine's shelf for (apparently) some time. These worries were unfounded. Creamy sweetness from the eponymous grain, alcohol burn at the end. Bridging the two is a citrus and rose hop explosion, melding well with the luscious sweet start and concealing the alcohol's presence well.  M: Thick and decadent.

Moreover, the hint of alcohol (it's very well masked) intensifies the tate of the hops from what I can tell.  Mouthfeel: Bitter and thick with a crisp finish.

Both poured a ruby amber color with a small yellow/tannish head that left alittle lacing on the glass. The 03 had a strong aroma of hops, grapes, and alcohol while the 02's aroma was much less noticable, but it certainly was fruity. The 03 tasted still way too bitter, nice hop bite, had a slight red wine taste (hence barleyWINE style) and a warming alcohol presence. Whereas the 02 had already began mellowing out nicely while still being fruity and hoppy. My conclusions: the 03 is still too young, so I know for the future, glad I have 3 of each year left.  2004 sample, This is a super fine, hoppy barleywine.

Lots of carbonation bubbles streaming up the glass as well and a thick sheet of lace.  The nose is very assertively hoppy up front. Lots of piney hop aroma and a lighter fruitty hop smell as well. Alcohol is also apparent.  The beer is very very bitter up front. Not merely hoppy, but an abrasive assertive bitterness grabs and burns the throat all the way down. That said, a sturdy malt presence is very evident but still pales in comparison with the hops this has screaming out at all angles. Alcohol is still very hot and assertive as well. A slight alcoholic tinge with each sip. Bready and biscutty flavors try their best to compliment the hops, but the hops easily steal the show.  Medium body, heavier when warmer. Carbonation is very active and a little stinging until the beer mellows with warmth.  Still young, the beer is very hot and extremely hoppy. Balance is not part of the equation and although one can easily detect the malt body of the beer, it is overshadowed by the hop character.

It isn't an up front citrus but it is faintly there.  The flavor is of raisins, sweet malt, followed by a hop cleansing that gives you a hint of citrus again. The small citrus presence is quickly killed by the malt sweetness and the alcohol warming in the finish. This is a great tasting beer.

Delivers mouthwatering, sharp, immediate flavors. Lots of resiny, piney hops and a real sugary and syrupy sweetness. Very bitter and very sweet. Not subtle in the least. Leaves a hoppy residue in the mouth and bitterness on the back of the tongue. One to sip over a long evening.  This is a very strong, un-mellow barleywine, and while tasty, there are better ones to be had. (Old Ruffian comes to mind.) Bigfoot isn't all that drinkable, due to the extreme flavors and high sweetness. It's not a bad barleywine, surely, but I prefer mine a bit more relaxed and tame.

But its still darn good at an early age as well. One of the best barleywines in the world and thats saying a lot.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,danielharper,4.35,"Purchased for me from Green's in Atlanta by UncleFlip. 2006 release.  A: Deep amber slightly hazy body, off-white (almost cocoa) foamy head. Leaves significant lacing on glass. Quite nice.  S: Strong notes of fruit, apples and vaguely ""amber"" aromas, with strong crisp hops underneath. As the beer warms, it becomes slightly maltier in aroma. Good.  T: Hops, hops, hops. Strongly bitter hop flavor, but with that same malt backbone I mentioned earlier. Crisp, awakening, refreshing. Lovely. Fruit becomes more prominent as the beer soaks into the palate.  M: Thick, chewy, malty. Nice texture.  D: Overall, a very good beer, possibly my favorite Sierra Nevada. I haven't had an aged bottle, but I'll bet as this one ages it mellows nicely. If I can stand it, I'll hang on to one of the last two 2006 bottles and drink them in a year or two.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,spaceranger,4.03,"I poured this ale into a glass and several things are immediately apparent. First, the aromatic smell knocks you out. I dunno...strawberrys, cherrys, hops, honey...there is a sweet sugary wine smell that is blessed. Second, the head lingers and lingers. There is great lacing but the head just hangs there...and the color of the head is a rich coffee-cream color with a swirl of ruby red in it. I swear, it is beautiful in the glass. You like hops? You like kick-ass hops? It would be impossible to impregnate this brew with any more hops. The bite grabs your buds and tonsils and tears at them. BUT it leaves the palette clean and clear. Whoa. Alc: 9.6 means only one or two at a time but this stuff is so overwhelming one or two will more than suffice...thanks Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Rickery,4.03,This is my first Barley Wine beer. Impressed and pleased with the experience. Amber colored deep orange when held up to light. Good head with lace that remained until the end. It smelled very rich and aromatic. Good mouth feel. Taste was much better than expected. I expected to be knocked down with the alcohol content. The alcohol was very well masked with a well-balanced beer. Quite hoppy and bitter but a little sweet to balance.  Generally I am not a fan of very hoppy/ bitter beer. I have been expanding my palette and am much more pleased with a bitter/hop beer. It is definitely a sipping beer. With the high alcohol content and intense bitterness this is very enjoyable but one is enough for the day.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,AltBock,4.25,"12oz. stubby bottle with a really cool and funny label. The label has a great and funny picture of an old miner looking down (probably at some gold he found) and with his donkey trying to pull him away because right before him in the woods is Bigfoot himself! That miner doesn't know what he's in for! Bigfoot is going to come out of the woods tear the miner limb from limb and eat his donkey for dessert. It's too bad they don't have a back label showing the aftermath of Bigfoot's rampage. Of course this is all just speculation. The other stuff on the label is the usual US stuff and with I believe is a batch number above the barcode on the right side. The year that it was made is on the cap and with mine being the 2006 version. This was capped with a twist off cap.  Appearance: When poured into a Snifter, the beer was a really nice dark ruby almost light brown color with a 1 finger of white foam. The head of foam had good retention leaving behind plenty of white foamy rings and lots of white sticky lace in it's tracks.  Smell: When poured into the glass the aroma was simple with some citrus fruits, bitter hops and little malt. But what separated this one was the fact that when I swirled it around, the aroma was slightly different. The citrus fruits turned into juicy fruits and the malts were sweetened. The only thing that remained the same was the bitter hops. Very nice and unusual smell.  Taste: It tasted like the first half of the aroma, but rearranged in a way. The first taste was that of strong citrus fruits and bitter hops. Then comes a little sweetness and some malt. If that wasn't enough, those bitter citrus hops show up again at the very end. Even though this beer clocks in at 9.6% ABV, there wasn't a trace of it in the taste.  Mouthfeel: Even thought this is at 9.6%ABV, I found it to be medium bodied instead of full bodied. Even in the mouthfeel, I still didn't taste or feel any strong amount of alcohol in this. I think the strong bitter citrus hops covered it all up. I guess you can say that the alcohol was hidden, much like the Bigfoot hiding in the woods on the label.  Drinkability: Overall an Excellent American Barley Wine that everybody should try for themselves, if you haven't just yet. As for me, I wouldn't mind having another one or aging a couple of these.  Edit: After writing this I found out what had happened with that miner and Bigfoot. Under the bottle cap there is a picture and it appears that Bigfoot sat down with the miner and a friend in front of a campfire and drinking a couple of these beers. I guess the Bigfoot didn't rip the miner limb from limb! It didn't show the donkey, but I'm sure the Bigfoot didn't eat him. :-)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,hoppymeal,4.15,"2005 Vintage. Pours brown with a little dark copper and red and an off white head, bottle conditioned cloudiness. Smells rich and sweet, prunes and apricots, malty, some dry red wine and alcohol. The sweet maltiness hits the palate for a brief moment before the harsh but pleasant, peppery and piney hop bitterness kicks in. A nice large dry alcohol finish. Chose the 05 to review as I thought it would be truer to the beer's nature, but definitely enjoy it more after approx five as the hops mellow and let the flavors establish themselves better.

140,2671,Abita45,4,"I was surprised by this beer. I went into it without any idea as to what I was having. It wasn't until after I opened and had a sip that I noticed the ""Barleywine Style"" on the label. From the moment beer hit glass I could smell the fragrance of the beer. Sweet and acidic, it proved to taste similarly. There's a sharpness to the taste and an acidity that I find appealing, but still, I really thought I tasted something along the lines of a chocolate flavor. There was a sweetness that didn't seem citric but leaned more towards something more subtle. In any respect, even from a bottle it poured with a nice head and had good lacing.  I really liked this beer very much, and gave it solid 4's across the board. I always enjoy Sierra Nevada's work, and I'm looking forward to giving this another try soon.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,DaPeculierDane,4.07,"Simultaneous tasting of 2000, 2003, and 2006 vintages in midwinter of 2006.  Appearance: The 06 and 03 are fairly equal in terms of carbonation and head. 00 is lacking. All three are semi-cloudy, light orange/ruby brown. 00 lacks some life in color and body.  Aroma: The 06 reminds me more of an IPA than a Barley Wine. Im still getting used to American Barley Wines so this is a learning experience as much as anything. Pine sap is oozing out of the 06. I think I could smell it clear across the roomjust checkedI could. Strong alcoholic caramel notes are also present but really covered by the hops. Citrus and floral spice are strong as well. Everything hops are supposed to be and more can be found within these confines. As expected, the 03 is less blistering but still heavily hopped  actually to a degree considerably greater than I would have expected. One can tell that SN really loads the hops into this one. After three years, a lot of hop oils must have broken down yet the 03 barley wine still ranks with the hoppier of American Barley Wines that Ive tasted. Its pretty cool. Also as expected, the 00 has really lost most of its hops. This isnt exactly a bad thing. I prefer English Barley Wine and I find the 00 to be just delicious. The caramel is a alive as ever. Its deeply earthy and subtle dark fruit flavors that go entirely missed in the younger vintages are present here. I think I pick up cherries and plums.  Taste: Following aroma, the 06 is largely hops with some minimal caramel content. Hop lingering in the finish is up there with perhaps the 5 hoppiest beers Ive had. One sip leaves a hop oil residue for a good two minutes. Intensity is exceptional. The 03 is a step down but once again surprises with some pretty discombobulating hops. Caramel flavors are more pronounced but only slightly. Some wood and sweet grains are present. The 00 vintage on the other hand is loaded with sweet caramel, earth, dates, and Japanese plum wine.  Mouthfeel: Obviously, the 06 is dry as Antarctica and blisteringly bitter. Beyond that the sweet alcohol plays a large roll as does lively biting carbonation. 03 compares as in the aroma and flavor  same as the 06 but smaller, although bitterness in the finish is considerably lessened here. The 00, despite its many fine qualities, has lost a lot of its zing here. Carbonation levels are below where they should be. A lot of the bite is gone. All that remains is a burn from the alcohol but even that seems mellow in comparison to the ass kicking tongue attack of the 06 and 03. Body is too flat and lifeless compared to following years.  Drinkability: The combination of high ABV and crazy hops in the younger vintages is a problem for me when it comes to drinkability. My taste buds simply arent that mature (read old and dead) yet, maybe if I started smoking At any rate, its not a knock on the beer, just personal preferences coming into play. The 00 would be more drinkable for me because of the hop mellowing but the lack of vitality in the body becomes a problem.  Overall: Impressive beer that ages well and changes drastically, although not necessarily for the worse, over time. I am pleased by all three vintages and curious to try others. Peak seems to be sometime before the beer hits three years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,rabsten,4.05,"Many thanks to BA Trep for this bottle. I got two '06s in a trade with him a couple of weeks back; the other bottle is being laid in for a loooong rest. Probably a year or more.  Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Deep amber, thick, thick head. Not a great amount of lacing. Glows beautifully with a candle behind it.  Sweet malt up front with hint of charcoal in the nose; mild hops linger in the background with the alcohol.  Tastes...good, but not finished. It seems like a work in progress. The hint of charcoal in the aroma is much more obvious in the flavor. The hops come through in a ""harder"" bitterness on the back of the tongue. The malt has a very scotch-like character.  Initial harshness on the palate, but smooths out. Later sips are much more easy. As this beer warms from about 40 degrees to (let me check) to 50-55, it gets better. The alcohol is present at all times and lingers in the sinuses after each sip.  Drinkability: The brew starts out harsh, smooths out. A fine drinking experience once it warms up. However, you don't want more than one  Like I said earlier, its a work in progress. I've had better barleywines, and some worse.

A - molten caramel in color, with a rich, creamy, rocky off-white head that lingers the whole way leaving only a trace of lacing.  S - mixture of citrus hops and sugary, candy apple smelling malt. Can definitely smell the alcohol. Hints of ripe, dark fruit, mixed with grapefruit, cotton candy.  T - tart citrus hop flavor and bitterness balanced out well by a sweet, but not overly so, malt backbone. Firm hop flavor, definitely an American style barleywine. Followed by a sweet, tangy, caramel and toffee tinged malt flavor that counteracts the strong bitterness very well. Tastes of higher alcohols, very warming. Well balanced barleywine.  M - surprisingly dry for a beer with so much malt content, mainly due to the big, ctirusy hop content. Body is medium-thick and slightly chewy. Warming from the alcohol. Carbonation is low to moderate.  D - despite alcohol content and rich, full body, this beer is surprisingly drinkable and I could easily knock back a couple of these.

There was about a centimeter or so of head that bubbled away to a ring with some film that stayed on top.  The smell is strongly of fresh floral hops, but Bigfooticus lurks in the background, sweet and caramely, almost a red toastiness, syrupy.  The taste is initially a slap in the face of fresh, floral, right off the vine hops, which is awesome by the way. Then came a distinct black liquorish flavor. Eventually the fruitiness reveals itself, it tastes of apple cider with plums, dates, and raisins. The finish is a combination of everything mentioned before, though it is not confusing, it's just plain phenomenal. As the beer warms, it does sweeten as one would expect but the strong hops persist in the finish.  It has a quite syrupy and chewy mouthfeel, it kind of sticks to your mouth. The montage of flavors does not mask the alcohol all that much, but the alcohol is not nagging, it just kind of matter of fact while enjoying Bigfooticus.

The smell is of heavenly pungent citrus and pine balanced by a solid caramel malt presence. Orange, grapefruit, molasses cookie, raisin and quite a bit of alcohol. The taste is of pretty wickedly strong hops. Good flavors but the hops are so strong they overpower some of the better, more subtle qualities of the otherwise very good malt backbone. The finish is very bitter and long with plenty of lingering warm alcohol. It has a medium body, slightly chewy texture and has moderate-lively carbonation. This is a flavor explosion and a must try.

Pours an opaque, rusty brown with a great looking 1"" head into an oversized wine glass. Head sticks around too.  Aroma is typical American barleywine... strong citrusy hops, particularly grapefruit. Also some mild floral or grassy hops in there too. Hops. Lots of hops.  Taste is... explosive, but not necessarily in a good way. The dry bitterness hits you like a brick to the head. Citrus is actually very restrained, and the bitterness is much more mute and grassy. There's definitely a good amount of malt trying to balance the hoppiness, but it doesn't do quite as good a job as with some others.  Mouthfeel is quite good, good body. Aftertaste is a bit grainy or floury -- a restrained form of the upfront bitterness.  To me, this seemed more one-dimensional than a lot of the bitterer beers I've tried.

My 2nd American Barleywine, I didn't like Old Horizontal much but I figured I'd take another shot.  Opened the bottle and thought I'd spilled paint thinner. Eesh! A clear, dark red / mahogany brown that looks like it means business. Lousy head retention.  Smells like hops. What an understatement. oooof hop oils and alcohol are the nose. Oily and resinous, bitter scent, no florals or citrus, more on the pine side. Maybe a hint of sweetness from malts but who knows, the hops have all the power here.  Tastes of dark, burnt, molasses hops. Lots of burned sugar/caramel. Very oily. The hops mask the alcohol well, at least. Fairly sweet and malty backbone, making this hop bomb different than a DIPA. Hops are all the way on the bittering side. Hints of raisins and liquor. 5 lbs of hops and a long island iced tea in a pint glass, almost.  Mouthfeel is thick, resiny, syrupy. Low carbonation. Aftertaste of hops is biting and leaves a slick on the tongue.  Tough to get through one of these. There is a major lack of balance and the alcohol is needlessly high. It's fine that Sierra Nevada was going for that, and I like pushing the envelope, but it isn't fun to drink and it doesn't taste that good.  This one is just for the hopheads ... I drank it at 55 degrees or so, if you aren't a hophead maybe chill it a little more to subdue the flavor -- some really nasty metallic off flavors came out as I drank it.

The nose is exceptional with a dense head of hops, brown sugar, and a tang of citrus. The mouthfeel is so rich and nearly coats your mouth upon the first sip.

I could tell just from the smell that this would be a very intense beer.  T: Very very bitter hops, reminded me a bit of a very strong IPA. Leaves an aftertaste that lingers long after you've finished. My second try of this beer I also drank a Stone brew Ruination IPA to compare. I always thought that Ruination was a very stong bitter drink, but I was amazed at how weak (no offence to Ruination, it's still one of my favorites) the IPA seemed compared to this barleywine.  M: Very thick and syrupy. Not a whole lot of carbination, but enough to not taste flat.  D: Very hard to drink at first, but after I got used to it I liked it a lot.

You really have to be in the mood for a hoppy beer to want more than one. Tonight is not that night, but I have 5 more to enjoy later on. I will definately save one for next year to see how it mellows",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,villainchiwwin,4.47,"poured at room temperature into pint glass. 2006 'expedition' tasted on 5-10-2006--fresh batch, baby bigfoot. deep red color with some brown, vigorouous bubbles. thick, rich head tinted beige-orange. nice lacing. sweet flowery hop and brown sugary malt in the nose- syrupy alchohol can also be smelled somehow like an earthy cherry liqueur. damn. this brew always amazes me due to the hugeness of its taste - brown sugar and caramel turns to a slight alchoholic flare up with an oily floral sweetness and breadiness extending into a long finish. there is a pleasant astringent graininess to the overall taste that demonstrates this barleywine's youth. lush, silky medium body initially - attacks mouth with a raw sheet of palpable palatable texture that finishes dry. definately a wholloper. delicious but huge in both flavor and abv% - high drinkability if savoring a single glass respectfully.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,mobyfann,4.41,"Paid under $2 for a 12 oz. bottle...  The beer is an art form, a clear amber colored base with a medium sized white head, excellent head retention and a cascade of lacing effects. The aroma is a nice mix of malt and hops.  The taste adds an extra degree of tart fruity flavor to the malt/hop mix, simply blended as one. Extremely smooth and nice on the palette and drinkable to the extent that this barelywine is an ideal session beer.  Final Thought: Packs a punch and is equally blended, there is not much more one can do to make a finer barley wine, this is the new standard in my book and Sierra Nevada is the best large-scale microbrew in this country... Chico, CA has some magic...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,TheManiacalOne,4.57,"2006 Expedition poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A: The beer is a reddish amber color with a very slight haze to it. It creates a foamy off-white head that takes its time to fade and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: Rich hoppy aroma backed up with citrus along with some caramel malt note.  T: Nice hops bite that remains prevalent from start to finish. There’s some citrus and malt sweetness to balance it out a little bit and you can taste the alcohol just a little bit. It leaves a slight citrus hops flavor in the after-taste, but it’s not as strong as I expected given the intensity of the hops that you taste until you swallow.  M: Very crisp and very smooth. Medium body and medium carbonation. Finishes quite cleanly.  D: Although you can taste the alcohol a bit, you certainly don’t taste 9.60% worth. If you take that into account along with the smoothness and the fact that it’s not too filling, I could go with this beer for quite a while, until the ABV catches up with me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,NVbeer,4.65,"Poured from a 12oz bottle with 2006 cap, into a snifter glass. A small white head quickly dissipates after the pour, leaving slight remanents around the edge. Beer has a deep red, mahogany color, no sediment or haze noted. Odor of alcohol is intially noted with minimal hops and no malt odors. As it warms up, increase in hop smell with grassy odors noted. Upon taste the hops are pronounced, again as it warms the earthy grassy tones of this beer appear. Alcohol flavor is also noted, but is never overpowering and begins to dissipate as it warms. Light carbonation noted, very pleasent feel in the mouth, some alcohol bite is noted, but not significant. This is far from a session beer, but does remain a favorite of mine, as it was one of the first barleywines I tried a few years back. Another quality ale from Sierra Nevada.

140,2671,DarkerTheBetter,4.32,"2006 into a tulip  This beer pours a glowing ruby amber with an irregular quarter inch of pale manila head that fell to a film after a few minutes and left some spots of drooping lace.  Smells like there is a base of sweet caramel, raisins, figs and barley with a concord grape that ties the malt into a nectarine and crisp pine hop. Im also getting little hints of cinnamon. Deliciously understated and very enticing!  Tasted very much like the smell with the same concord grape tangy sweetness and some honey that was blended into a furious hop onslaught in the finish that consisted of celery, super dry grapefruit ring and smooth cedar which left a very prominent sting along the edges of my tongue. As I sit for a while to take this in, the same places that got stung are throbbing a bit. Thats a little much for me, but not entirely unpleasant.  The mouth feel is medium bodied with a nice, busy carbonation that really makes itself known with out causing any trouble.  Im digging this one. Id like to sit on my other bottles for anther year to see what the hops do, but over all, this is a pretty good hoppy barley wine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Aroma of caramel malt, notes of toffee, it's bready, no hops, and a hint of sherry.  Taste hits with a blast of caramel malt, multi-grain bread, and a dry sherry character. The hops are mostly gone, only a decayed corpse remains. Mouthfeel is full, though not as thick as a fresh one. This beer has gone from super hoppy to malty smooth. I have no desire to touch my 05s, 06s are still good for a hop fix. This is very close to peak, IMO.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Freshie,4.28,"2006 Vintage  Very nice deep amber colour with good lacing to the side. Cloudy with some visible sentiment.  Smells of strong hops and some pine, citrus type tang.  The taste is a punch the tongue. Hops, strong alcohol, spicy finish. A very sweet malt.  The alcohol burn is very warming and lends itself to the taste very well.  Not for the faint of heart. Strong, but flavourful. Sip it till it's gone.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,GreenWBush,4.9,"1998 vintage, reviewed in 2006.  When this beer was brewed, I was a gangly high-school junior a few months from meeting the girl who I would fall in love with and marry.  This well cared-for example leaves its bottle-entombment dark plum in color with yeasties a' swimmin. A large head kicks up - to my surprise - and leaves a unique, spotty, and abstract lace pattern on the glass.  Nose is potent, pungent, and absolutely untouched by oxidation or other deleterious effects of age. Dark fruit floats feet above the glass. Maple syrup, candied cherries, toasted molasses.  This is the first beer to make me vocalize my adoration...I literally moaned with pleasure upon the first sip. The once-dominant hoppiness has subsided to play a skeletal, supporting role, yet tons of bitterness still remains. To my surprise, the overwhelming sweetness found in BF has calmed to a luxurious and worship-worthy madiera dream. Toffee, vague suggestions of cinnamon. Ends earthy, with hints of oak, vanilla, and silky chocolate.  The endless depth of this beer blows my mind repeatedly throughout the twelve righteous ounces I am so lucky to have acquired. This beer instantly made me think that I am not going to touch any of my BF's until they are at least 5 years old.  This would have gotten my first 'all 5' review except for the fact that I have only one amazingly-aged example of this well-preserved vintage. Its also sort of unfair to give an all 5 rating in part to the calming effects of age.  A beer religious experience. Put a lock on your Bigfoot cellar.  The 2006 tasted like nail-polish remover after this...and looked about three shades lighter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Franchise,4.67,"Pours a ruby red with dark pockets that leave a thick frothy tan head that hangs with this brew. I can smell the hops before I even breathe in the nose. Hops, citrus, baked cookies, cinnamon, pine, lemon, so fresh and nice...are all in the nose.  The taste is intense, so spicy, fresh chewed pine, fruit sorbet. I had this brew awhile back and I don't remember it being this good, it was good but this is fantastic perhaps the development of my palate.  This beer went great with a little cheese platter I laid out. The plate consisted of aged Irish porter cheddar and pepperoni for spiciness that really accentuate the spices in the barleywine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Blakaeris,4.35,"Pours hazy red copper with with a thick off white head the leaves generous lacing.  Smell is floral hop and sweet fruit. Generous toasted malt character.  Taste is a balanced blast of sweet syrupy caramel malt and huge hops. High ABV and strong fruit flavors give a peach brandy character. Very smooth. Finish lingers with the bite of bitter hop mellowed by the intense maltiness and warming alcohol qualities.  Mouthfeel quite full. Thick and oily.  This brew is something special. It is big, but balanced. Very nice.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Gaisgeil,4.2,"This is an exceptional beer I must say. I walked into this one with a certain stigma in my head I must admit. I guess I sort of thought of it as one of those hop lovers' brews; the type of thing that is horribly out of balance etc. It is certainly not that I don't think. Pours a deep and hazy amber in color with a fizzy off-white head. The nose is deeply hoppy, citrusy and strong. The taste is definitely hoppy, though not overly bitter (though that is highly subjective!) but with a sweet and thick malty counterbalance. This brew also hides it's alcohol VERY well. Mouthfeel is medium.  This is a very accesible brew and I can see why it's so popular, it is very well crafted and very enjoyable, I will return again.  Slàinte!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,SetarconeX,4.17,"Rather dark reddish brown hue with a lingering head that isn't too overwhelming but stays put. Lots of hops and malt on the nose. Tastes not unlike someone threw a load of hops into an orange juicer. Not so much beer as a strange form of exceedingly bitter liquid hop.  Very good if you like your beers super hopped, but even if it's easy to love, it's hard to drink. Impressive, but not something you can really drink regularly.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,instrumentality,4.07,"Poured a transparent amber with very little head.  Smell was somewhat sweet, almost like apples.  Taste started out somewhat sweet and apple-like, but was soon overpowered by malt and hops.  Mountfeel was a bit harsh, somewhat burning the palate, and the alcohol was very apparent. The taste of hops was left behind on my tongue, but not so much as with some other barley wines.  I'm not a big fan of barley wines, but I tried to drink this one objectively and compare it with other barley wines. From that perspective, this is a well crafted beer. I do like it, but I'm not too fond of the lingering aftertaste. This would probably be consumed best with a sharp cheese or red meat to help balance its potency.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,sinstaineddemon,4.18,"A - this pours a delightful caramel color with a very thin and short lived tan color head (perhaps because i poured it too cold, a mistake i will not repeat)  S - definitely smells sweet, as most barleywines do to me, a dark, molasses type sweet, there is also the very strong alcohol kick to it  T - man, i see why people rave about this, i've had it before but not since BA came into my life, such an artful and precise balance to its flavor, a perfect hop bitterness matched against a flawless sweetness and the high ABV kick is hidden in the back very well  M - smooth and refreshing, easy down the gullet, as i mentioned, well balanced  D - high, even the higer ABV doesnt detract from this brew, one of my favorite barleywines  2006 vintage, oh and i love the cartoon under the cap",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,cheers2beers,4.17,"Served into a snifter: 2006 version  Appearance: A dark amber with a bright ruby tint when held to the light. The tanish rocky head grew to an extreme magnitude(it almost peaked my glasses limit) Lots of laceing can be found. Even a lone column of bead is noticed.  Smell: Huge hop character. Huge, sweet, caramel and raisin malts,and a huge alcohol are all clustered into the aromas to create a most splendid delight.  Taste: The flavors are vigorously potent. Hops are very strong in this barley wine. Not bad, just seems like its border line of being to many IBU's. I think the sweetened fruity malts helps counter act the,almost overpowering hops. And of course it is hard to hide the almost 10% alcohol. A very nice combination,each one of these three seem to keep the other in check.  Mouthfeel: The feel is oily and slick. Medium carbonation. Leaves a sweet caramel and alcoholic aftertaste.  Drinkability: A very quaffable drink indeed, but I can speak from past experience that if you let this beer warm up to much it will become very cloying.(In my own opinion,of course.) I can definitely say that I will purchase this again. It is a great Barley wine and I would recommend this to anyone as a must try. Ageing might be a good idea.

140,2671,JerzDevl2000,4.03,"Picked this up recently at a local liquor store. I'm not much of a Barleywine drinker, but I like Sierra Nevada's offerings that I've had before, and I heard good things about this beer. It took a bit of acclimating for me, but this grew on my nicely as it warmed up more and more!  A very solid pour here. Not as much head or lacing as the flagship SNPA, but the deep, ruby red color and trademark SN aroma were present and quite a treat to behold. There's a bit of the piney, oily taste that one expects from this brand of beer, but don't be fooled. This is not a mellow drink at all! The 9.60% ABV can be easily felt here, and the aftertaste is quite strong, yet enjoyable. The warming effect of this beer can easily be felt, but it's never too bitter or overdone. Like others have said, this brew is a mix of SN's flavors and aroma, with that of a English-style barleywine. The amazing part it, they got the proportions of each down very nicely, and somehow, this never gets to be too overwhelming on the senses.  This is not something to be consumed at a fast pace. The novice drinker may not adjust to this easily, but a good craft beer enthusiast can enjoy this and it's nuances for quite a long while. It has a wonderful warming effect, has the bubbly mouthfeel and cascade hops that one expects from a SN offering, and a subtle hop undertone to the aftertaste. A commendable effort, one worth cellaring, and certainly worth a try for those willing to expand their horizons with regards to styles and types of beer consumed!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Jcdolan,4.27,"Pours a DARK orange almost redish color. Minimal head that dissipates and leaves a ring around the edge of the glass.  Smells of a nice blend of hops and fruit.  First tastes of mild hops and then an unbelievable powerful fruit tase appears directly follow by intense alcohol. Leaves a linguring tast of hops.  Mouthfeel is mildly fizzy, goes down smooth however.  This is a beer that should be enjoyed slowly and savored. Especially with the high alcohol content. I'm suprised that they sell it in six packs. Very good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Metalmonk,4.75,"2006 Expedition  Looked and poured like oil out of the bottle. Has a glossy, glassy brown/amber color, thick, with super-mellow carbonation. Thick head settles to a flapjack skin across the top. I have come to love the look of this beer, gazing and swirling and almost (almost!) forgetting to just drink the damn thing.  Aroma is herbal, floral and citrus with hops muscling its way in and ultimately winning.  Tastes of hops soaked in maple syrup, with the floral/spicy elements rounding off the edges of the hops. Orange/tangerine flavors come out as it warms. Vanilla, maple syrup, and other yummy things open up as it warms. Can be a bit sharp when young, though, depending on the year of release (see addendum below).  Mouthfeel is wonderfully creamy, with more sizzle than I would have expected from the lazy bubble action.  This isn't as extreme or crazy as some other barley wines, it just does the job and does it damn well. Packs plenty of flavor and does almost too good a job hiding that 9.6% alcohol. Savor slowly and with care.  [early 2007: just sampled a year-old bottle, and this thing becomes ridiculously smooth, all the edges rounded off, making this one crazy drinkable. Cellaring clearly does a lot for this one.]  [another addendum, 2009: The 2009 release is the best fresh-Bigfoot I've had yet. This remains one of the most delicious, drinkable big beers of all-time. A classic!]",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,brewdlyhooked13,4.26,"The third and final of three Bigfoot years sampled over the course of several days. This was the 2006 edition.  Appearance - pours a very nice reddish amber. It catches light well, creating some nice hues in the glass from an almost fiery clouded red to deep brownish amber. Three fingers of head form up on the pour into a Paulaner 25cl tasting glass. The drop-back leaves chunks and craggy patterns of lace down to the solid think cap.  Aroma - sweet, citrusy, lots of pine. Good resilience but not as intense as '03.  Taste - a thick, fairly sweet maltiness rides shotgun to very intense hops, coming on at the first sign of sweetness on the tongue. Full pine and grapefruit rind effect here, enhanced by alcohol. Probably the best flavor for hopheads but the intensity masks some subtleties of the beer that come with some aging. The finish is dry, a taste of fruitiness sneaking in now and then.  Mouthfeel - very thick and chewy, just as coating as the '03. Feels more carbonated to me though, very busy in the mouth. Takes the edge off the bigness, not necessairly a bad thing.  Drinkability - very drinkable. I nearly downed the last of my 2nd sixer before realizing I hadn't taken any notes on it yet. An 'everyday big beer' if there ever was one. The most quaffable of the three I tried for a vertical, but aging the bottles for a few years is the ideal way to enjoy all this beer can do, IMO.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,blackie,4.2,"Vintage 2006  appearance: The pour produces a .5"" light tan head that slowly recedes back into the glass. A thin layer on top and thick ring around the glass is left. Moderate lacing sticks to the walls of the glass as I drain it. The beer is a dark ruby-amber in color.  smell: Big PacNW hops up front...fresh, green, and wonderfully floral. Though this barleywine is definately hop forward, I get the sense that there is actually quite a bit of balance to it. Right along with those hops I get a big, sweet caramel malt aroma that is nice and fruity. Hints of tropical fruits, fresh cut hardwood, honey, and sugar cookies are found. Considerable alcohol presence on the nose, but that it expected and it is not really detracting.  mouthfeel: The carbonation is towards the lower side of the medium range, and is composed of small, smooth bubbles. The body is on the lower end of the heavy range.  taste: Where to begin? Huge flavors of boiled, steeped hop matter attack my palate...but there is also a little fresh hop flavor in there. There's a big caramel malt flavor, but the hops almost overwhelm it completely. A considerable bitterness comes in after the swallow, but it is not overwhelming given the fullness of the beer. Right now it is almost all hops, though I can tell there are some great flavors in there wanting to come out.  drinkability: Limited drinkability due to the alcohol content paired with the mean hop character and fullness. What a beer.  Picked up a six pack, will definately cellar the other five awhile. I also have a 2004 and a 2005 that I look forward to sampling someday.  2006 Vintage sampled Jan 10, 2007: Hops still smell great, and are quite big, but it seems they have lost a touch of their fresh ""snap."" Going by my initial description, the basics are all still here, just more integrated as a whole...malts not as sweet, hops not as fresh, coming together more singularly. Still plenty of ethanol presence. Same can be said for the flavor...the malt comes through much more and the hops have lost some of their dominant bite while plenty of tealike hop flavor persists. Complex with caramel malt aromas and flavors.  2009: deep amber, big pine hop over a boozy caramel malt body, full body not overly heavy, caramel malt that manages not to be overly sweet, huge piney hop palate with a mod-high bitterness, gonna leave my scores as they are, single from total wine, newport news, va, stuck one in the cellar for the vertical",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,skillerified,3.13,"Pours out really thick in a really nice dark mahogany color. Strong tan head that coats the sides of the glass instead of just lacing it.  Pine and citrus (mostly lemon, but a dash of orange here and there too) dominate the scent. There's a hint of alcohol in there (surprisingly small for the ABV). There's bit of pine cone too. Will likely get more complex as it warms.  All hops on the palate. It's like a hop barrage. I like a good double IPA and all, but this is too much for me. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just too much for me. Some spices start to come into play as it warms, but it's still too much for me.  Really thick and heavy bodied. Starts rich and sweet and turns to an astringent bitter bite. Such a wide swing is just not appealing to me. There's no subtlety in this brew.  Not sure if I can finish the one I've got, much less the one in the fridge. I really think it's just me. I don't think this is bad for the style or anything like that, it's just too much for me.

Smelled over-top-hoppy-- think floral--, but then sweeter as it warmed up. Maltiness really fills up the nose on anything more than a light sniff.  Bitter more than hoppy, if you know what I mean. Strong malts and a sweet finish. The booze really tries to creep through the bitterness.  Creamy and smooth, but also so hoppy and boozy that it starts to seem caustic after most of the glass.  Drinkable? Eh...Given the booze and the unabashed heaviness, it's ok. I certainly can't do more than one of these in a night, let alone one sitting.

Smells of floral hops, sweet doughy malts, slight caramel.  Hops hit you in the face but are quickly joined by a sweet malty flavor.This is a hop bomb, though. Flavor tries but cannot hide the alcohol. Could use a bit of aging to mellow it a bit. Sticky, syrupy mouthfeel with noticeable alcohol afterburn. Very little carbonation.

The taste softens after a while...though not much...and becomes an incredibly tasty brew full of hoppy goodness. Floral and citrus. Long, intense bitterness and full in the mouth.

Sm: Wafts of sweet malt, orangey hops and some alcohol drift over from the glass, and closer inspection is no less pleasant. This is a 2006 bottle, and the nose isn't that complex yet. But what it has is a less is more quality.  Ta/Mf: Again it's a malty and citrus hoppy goodness, but somehow it stands out against a barley wine that is just ""simple"" or ""basic."" There is massive rush of flavor as it crosses the tongue, bitter orange peel and sweet malt are balanced and forward in the profile. Strong carbonation, and a puckering mouthfeel make this an enjoyable offering in some sensible dose.  DA: Medium. As tasty and commendable as this classic barleywine is, I never have more the 2 or 3 servings.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ultralarry2006,4,"Vigorous pour yields a 2 inch head that doesn't hang around and leaves slight lace. A deep coppery red with only slight haze. Aroma - instantly noticeable alcohol- some piney citrus and doughy caramel. Taste- intensly sweet and bitter at the same time- very intense- at first, the hops and malt compete briefly, fighting for your attention, citrus and caramel, then two sides of the flavor equation (hops vs. malt)seem to cancel each other so that alcohol asserts itself over the two - leaving a biitersweet aftertaste following an alcohol burn. Mouthfeel - very full mouth, little carbonation, slick coating, and small alcohol burn. Drinkability- this is very good, but very rich, could handle two in one sitting (maybe three if I wasn't driving) then would need to have something much less rich and smaller abv. As for the alcohol burn; this ale is good enough as to make it tolerable, moreover I suspect that the burn diminishes with age (cellering) as the ale's components mellow and hence integrate with each other rather than compete, much the same way it does with wine (this being my first barleywine experience) -this is vintage 2006.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,HugoGrim,3.93,"2006 edition: Poured from the bottle into a snifter.  Rick burgundy/rosewood color to the body. An aggressive pour produced a nice thick head, which dissipated into a thin wisp of soapy foam. Epic lace.  Aroma is hop domination with hints of sweet dark fruits.  Absolute hop blast in the mouth. Very Earthy with flavors of wood and leather, but piney hops flex, and push everything else into the background. Alcohol is faint, and quite pleasant.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,dreadnatty08,4.67,"06' edition. Pours a dark ruby hazy brew. An aggressive pour yields just a slight fizzy head that quickly dissipates. Aromas abound, screaming out of the glass. A sweet, roasty maltiness, followed by some resinous hops and a bit of alcohol burning in the end. A syrupy, heavy mouthfeel with very little carbonation covers the tongue with some intense flavors. The sweetness is quickly entrapped by a bitter hoppy zing. Some dried fruits are noted in addition to a floralness that barely makes it over the alcohol, which makes a heavy presence. This is a style I've come to love, and wonder why anyone would want to drink wine after this. I had the pleasure to drink this side by side a 750ml bottle of Old Crustacean (with a friend of course) and was able to appreciate the big difference (mainly the sweet, balanced flavor of Rogue's vs. the hop bomb of Bigfoot). This is an amazing digestif beer I've been able to enjoy on many a night. Holds a special place for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Dukeofearl,2.96,"CELLARED REVIEW:  Bigfoot 2004, aged approximately 2 years. Last of a six pack purchased in early 2004 for approximately $8.99 at LaBodega in Riverside, CA. I am interested in this re-review, as I really didn't care for it before, and I know it probably has changed, and I know I have changed. Is it any better? Previous (6/2004) review copied below for comparative purposes.  Pours a dark amber with copper notes. A moderate off-white head drops quicky. Muddy looking, even though I kept the bulk of the obvious yeast particles in the glass.  Aroma is complex, deep brandy like, but better. Sweetness, brandied cherries, figs, slight chocolate notes. Flavor follows through, intense and strong. No real notice of the hops that seemed to dominate before- did I mis-identify, or have the hops character truly faded away?  Mouthfeel is rich and full, creamy when swirled in the mouth. But then there's that huge alcohol burn at the end, kerosene/jet fuel that completely ruins all the good stuff that came before. It really takes something that starts well, and just destroys it. When I first reviewed this, it was one of the first barleywines I had ever tried. Now I've had several, and I know they can be better than this.  Once again, I did not finish it.  ORIGINAL REVIEW (6/04):  2004 vintage, poured in 6/04. Pours a medium brown, semi-transparent with a medium head after a vigorous pour. The head dies back into a thin cover pretty quickly. Aroma is malty, with a lot going on- somewhat sweet, with dark sweet fruits, and the oils and pines of hops. Flavor was slightly sweet with a strong, piney oily bite of hops, and with a huge, overpowering alcohol profile. As it warms, rich dark sweet fruits come out too. But it continued to feel like pure grain alcohol mixed with hop oil. There was a lot of interesting things going on, but the alcohol rising through them all made me stop drinking it.  This was a beer of extremes for me. There were parts I really liked, and parts that really ruined it for me. I could not finish it. I have one more bottle that I will let age for a year or two and see what it's like. I am a big Sierra Nevada fan, and I could not do this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Tastes sweet for about a nanosecond, then the hops just punch you hard....candy-malt comes forward as it warms.Clean citus rind finish that lingers into the aftertaste....and lingers some more Sweet syrupy mouthfeel...no carbonation. This is a really good one, but you must want over -the -top - hop bitter...from start to finsh...and then some. For my taste...I would describe this as DFH 90 minute that has been intensified right to the limit.

140,2671,beerphilosopher,4.49,"Much to my surprise, I found this one at one of my local liquor stores. This part of IL is typically quite beer-deprived, so I was very pleased ... anyway ...  Poured into the pint glass with a very red orange appearance. Head is white with little retention. Little visible carbonation. Nose is big time hops upfront. Lurking behind, however, is a pretty robust sweet malt backbone to offset the hop attack just a tad. Smells wonderful. Palate is as suspected. The hops jump out and grab you like a pissed off yeti. As the nose indicated, the substantial malt character really does work to ""tame"" the massive hop profile this one contains. Pine, green tea, and a little citrus mixed with sweet mollasses and caramel. Mouthfeel is biting and sweet, Again, low carbonation. Lasting bitterness of the hops co-exist with a persistent sweetness. Medium-bodied. Wow ...what can I say ... I've wanted to try this one for a while now and it didn't disappoint. I was a bit worried as this is the '06 Bigfoot and still very ""young."" The hops are indeed ""untamed"" and are a force to be reckoned with. All in all, though, this is still very drinkable (one), and promises even better things in a couple of years. The rest of the six is goin' in the cellar and won't make another appearance for a year, at least. By then, it'll have learned a little discipline. Anyway, as for the Bigfoot ... I believe.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,jamesdergen,4.48,"2005 Edition  Appearance: Pours a gorgeous ruby-amber with a medium tan head.  Smell: Dense piney, herbal hops and strong malty background.  Taste: A massive attack on my tastebuds! Starts out with a wall of herbal, piney very aggressive hops that fades into the caramel malt background. The hops never leave completely and come back in with the alcohol at the end, raw hop bitterness lingers in my mouth afterwards.  Mouthfeel: Very aggressive, but not overly carbonated and medium-bodied. The alcohol is ever-present, but not overpowering. Overall, surprisingly smooth.  Drinkability: Easy to sip, but I would not want to drink this any faster. Mostly as a result of the delicious taste, but also out of reverence to the alcohol content. For the style, very drinkable.  What a great brew from SN! Hoppy, malty and full of alcohol, but still well balanced and delicious. Highly recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Gusler,4.42,"Vintage 2006 The beer sets in the glass a clear deep mahogany After its debarking the 12-ounce stubby brown bottle, the head is modest in size, semi-creamy in texture and the color a winsome light tan, after its eventual demise the lace forms a concealing sheet to obscure the glass. Nose has a decent hop floral spiciness, sweet malt at the back, citrus like in its crispness, start is a bit sweet, the grain profile perfect and the top middling in its feel. Finish is mercenary in its acidity, the hops powerful in their spiciness, quite dry and the aftertaste long. Drinkable as it is, but give six months to twenty years then its spectacular.   Vintage 2005: The beer dispenses from the 12-ounce brown bottle a luminous mahogany and the head, Brontosauric in size, the texture creamy and the color light tan, as the head slowly degrades the resultant lace forms a thick and sticky sheet upon the glass. Nose is hop floral, sweet and the malt obvious, crisp and clean, the start is sweet, the grain profile adequate and the top middling. Finish is mildly acidic, the hops punishing in their spiciness, droughty aftertaste, the alcohol also makes itself known is a bit of aftertaste bitterness and the nice tummy warming, a beer I look forward each year, a life long favorite.  Vintage 2004 Well, my waiting is over, every year I wait with great anticipation for the new release of Big Foot, one of my top 3 barley wines, well the wait is over, got my first sampling of Release 2004.The beer disembogues the bottle a somewhat hazy brown color, the head is moderate in size, frothy in its texture and the color a winsome light tan, as it evaporates, the lace forms a sealing curtain upon the glass. Nose is sweet malt, hints of the hop flower, a tad bit of fusel alcohol, citrus crisp and fresh, start is ambrosial; the malt a bit lean in my opinion, top is moderate in mouth feel. Finish is prickly in its acidity, the hops majestic in their spiciness, very dry aftertaste. Appears to me that this years batch is a bit light on the malt, a change I dont like, still a fine beer, and maybe a bit of aging will help, for better or worse, I now have a case and one six pack in the cellar.  VIintage 2003: What can I say about this beer that Ive not said many times before. Each year I wait for it to come out like waiting on a dear friend to come for a visit. As it sets in my Sierra Nevada Pounder, its an unblurred mahogany color, the head temperate in size frothy in texture, the color a winsome light tan, and as it disappears the lace formed a silky sealing sheet, that welds itself to the glass. Nose is floral, slight traces of fusel alcohol, citrus crisp, fresh, as a spring morning, a real treat to the nose, start is sweet and thickly malt with a middling top. Finish surly in its hop spicy bite with the acidity bruising and the alcohol domineering, the aftertaste desert dry, somewhat bitter and long lasting. Love this beer and it only gets better with age just like Olde Gusler!  Vintase 2002: On the pour a nice clear brown, masterful beige head and sheets of lace to coat the glass. Nose is hop floral, malt under tones, and just maybe a hint of fusel alcohol. Front begins malt and slightly sweet, the top has a fair to middling mouth feel. The finish has a brawny hop presence, intermediate acidity, aftertaste is dry, alcohol bitter and the high ABV is certainly evident in the ""Belly Warming"". I bought a case, and a 12 pack is being cellared as we speak, a beer that gains in flavor and robustness as it ages, and I'm sure it will be a ""Hoot"", 2 or 3 years down the road.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The taste is big, huge, citrusy hoppy goodness up front that gets my palate's attention and almost puts a stranglehold on it. ;^) Mid way through, there's a good malt presence that stays right through to the finish though, right at the very end, the hops return just to let you know ""who"" is in command.

I've had a mixed track record with barley wines so far but I'm trying harder to appreciate them and this is suppossed to be one of the best. Pours a cloudy ruby color into my goblet with no real head but a thin skullcap remains. Cloudy and very tranquil in appearance, with zero visible carbonation. Nose has the delicious waft of chocolate malt and is ringed with alcohol, unsurprising considering the abv. I have to admit, I like this beer in spite of what it is. Too much alcohol on the tongue for me but a late kick of hops saves it from high abv hell and gives it some much needed balance and character. Texture is obviously thick and round enough under the circumstances. I still wouldn't choose one for extended session work but this is a high quality brew. I'll definitely be looking for more of these next winter and have to admit with this one, the hype is legit.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,bashiba,4.03,"2006 bottling Poured a nice dark red with lots of carbonation, when poured aggressively this led to about 4 inches of thick creamy and sticky head.  Smell is a nice mix of juniper hop odor with bits of bready toasty malts.  Wow is this a hop bomb. There are some underlying malt flavors, but it still dominated by great piney and grapefruity hop flavors.  Mouthfeel has a thick oilyness that really cotes the tongue and lingers.

Im not sure how long they age this, but it is VERY right now! Aging will mellow and smooth out the few (very) rough edges it has now. Very rich, not really overpowering in any area. Sure its a litle strong, but its A Barley Wine. Much more drinkable than some others ive had that are too sweet (cloying?) or not nearly as balanced.

I was able to get a good foamy head out of it, but cleared away after a short amount of time (maybe a tulip glass would have helped?) Great aroma upon agitating the beer. Nice crisp hoppy smell. The flavor followed the same trend with the hoppiness. Hoppy to begin and a slight dry after-taste. Had a great reddish-brown color when held up to the light.

140,2671,tattooedtolley,4.6,"2006 edition. 12oz bottle with cool little image of bigfoot and some campers drinking under the cap.  Appearance: Deep amber/red in color with a big head that stays for a while, long enough to let it sit and warm up a bit. Great looking in every glass I have put it in.  Smell: Super hoppy, pine aroma takes complete command of my ability to smell.  Taste: You can't miss the hops in this one. I was certainly suprised by the first tasting of this year's Bigfoot, I had no guess there would be this much hop kick. That is certainly something that I think adds to the taste of this barleywine. The piney and slightly fruity hops are great and the maltiness in the back helps add to the body and let's you know that you are still drinking a barleywine.  Mouthfeel: The body is big enough for a barleywine, not overly chewy, just about right for my tastes.  Drinkablitly: The first night I had this I opened one after already having a few others and it straight knocked me on my ass. Ever since that night I stop at just one and save the rest for another night. The beer is still extremely drinkable but you must be on your toes not to over do it.  Overall I think this is one of the best barleywines I have ever had. I love hops so the hoppiness of this one is more than welcome to my tastes but others will certainly want to cellar this one for a while.

140,2671,superdavex,4.92,"Ok, let me preface this review by saying I have a Bigfoot in my hand and have had one consistently in my belly after work for a good month now. Why I've only gotten around to reviewing it now I won't try to explain. On with the review.  As I twist the top off and pour the liquid into my pint glass I immediately notice the DIPA like copper hue. I continue to pour and a very thick body is noticed by the lack of surface movement. As I finish the pour a very slight head developes.  I take a deep quaff and intense hops are inhaled along with a sweet alcohol smell. Wow, is this inviting!  The taste is beyond compare in my experience of barley wines. A slightly sweet malt-like entrance into your mouth followed by an INTENSE hoppy flavour. This is by far the hoppiest barly wine I've had and this is a VERY good thing.  A slightly heavy mouthfeel somehow offset by the intense hoppyness. This thing is so hoppy that it cut through the thickness.  Drinkability is outstanding as I could easily have three or four of these 10% suckers but I'd certainly be regrettin it. I'm gonna limit myself against my will and stop right now after this sip.

Amber colored with brilliant ruby highlights. As I inhaled deeply I was teased by dark fruit, and tons of fresh hops. Taste is sweet and fruity before a tidal wave of strong alpha hops crashes into my taste buds. Huge hop taste and finish with just a touch of biscuity malt in the beginning and end....which the hops just laugh at and step all over. Alcohol warmth present but nowhere neer overwhelming. Mouthfeel is just short of chewy. Big, complex mother of a beer. Definitely would try over and over again. Shows why a company like Sierra Nevada has such staying power in the market.

One decided, unique aspect about this one that I don't think I've noticed in other barley wines is a distinct note of licorice. Intense, hoppy bitter, malty sweet, sweetened coffee... Big Beer.

140,2671,beveragecaptain,4.55,"12 ounce bottle. Bigfoot pours out a deep amber color with a large, dense head. Each sip of this beer seems to leave a new ring of lacing on the side of my glass. The aroma is a blast of grapefruity hops. The hop aroma becomes slightly more tame as the beer warms, but there is no doubt on which side the balance lies in this beer. Pungent hop flavor with lots of sweet caramel maltiness too. Although the sweetness is there, the taste left behind in the mouth is very bitter. The hoppiness is green, but I can't imagine this beer any other way. Smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is present but doesn't interfere.

Poured a dark, ruby color with hues of orange & copper at the bottom and throughout. An off-white head developed with thick bubbles on the surface; soap-like. Aromas of plums, roasted malt, honey, caramel, and alcohol. The taste was smooth and rich with malt flavors upfront and a hop finish. Really complex and flavorful; nothing too overpowering. Thick and chewy in my mouth. Slightly sour taste in the back of my throat with a mild alcohol warming sensation. Overall, this is one of the best barley wines I've had so far.

140,2671,pjwilson,4.85,"'06 sampled fresh  appearance: nice red color with a phat head. sheets of lacing as the glass is emptied. one the few beers that feels equally at home in pint glass, as it does in a wine glass or tulip. this particular one is in a wine glass. pretty hard to beat this one.  smell: nice reisny pine smell. more subdued than some pale ales, but here in full effect. the malts are nowhere to be found at this point.  taste: about perfect, although it can be argued that their is so much hop flavor that it sort of pushes the limit on the barlelywine style. I love the malty barleywines alot too (which this beer itself will become in a year's time), but this beer just has the perfect mix of grapefruit, pine and malt backing to make it work. Samples from a month ago had even more grapefruit, the flavors in this beer really change month to month it's the damnest thing. doesn't seem to bitter at all, although it is bitter, no doubt.  mouthfeel: light as one could reasonalbly expect a barlelywine to be, and they don't even use sugar to thin the body,(not that i care, it's just impressive from a brewing standpoint). sure, it's got some heft to it, but you want that in barlelywine i would assume.  drinkablitly: so drinkable for a bw it's scary. Old Gaurdian is a chore for me to finish, not this. Yeah, you want to savor it, but it just keeps going down.

140,2671,dem,4.5,"I first had the 2006 Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale a few nights ago on tap at MacGregors in Rochester, NY. At the time, it was not a proper (sober) environment to do an accurate review. Well, I unexpectedly found a six pack of it an hour ago at a dinky beverage center. The following is my impromptu review.  Pours out of the 12 oz bottle deep amber. Looks like warm malt extract. Very thin sharp head vanishes quickly. Carbonation just slightly flatter then when I had it on tap. I notice a BIG difference in the lacing. It was poured into identical chalices both at the bar and home. From the bottle there was almost zero lacing. On tap at the bar, the lacing was so thick it stayed on the glass throughout, leading me to scoop it off with my finger to savor it one last time. Too many variables to tell if it was a reaction to something on the glassware (soap) or if theres more lace from the kegged version. I will continue my tests.  A glorious American hop aroma. Hoppy, fruity, citrusy, and sweet. Nice strong bouquet here.  I am not a fan of fruity beverages. Hell, I thought I didnt like barleywines, but this one does it just right. Fruity, malty and sweet for juuust long enough before the hop bite kicks in and makes you feel like a man again. A great sharp bitterness in the aftertaste. Grapefruit comes to mind. Nice and complex.  Mouthfeel from the bottle seems syrupy after having it on tap, but that feeling goes away quickly. It could all be my imagination. When I had it on tap, it was FAR from being my first beverage of the night. That may have influenced my memory of this ale. Hehehehe.  Bigfoot is quite drinkable for me, but I REALLY like big beers. I do think Id save this for a nightcap. A slow sipping setting seems appropriate here.

Thick and delicious looking with good creamy head and excellent lacing. Tiny bubbles rise up creating a very impressive appearance.  Smell = Not particularly strong in the nose but what's there is pleasant. Very hoppy but with a lot of sweetness too, like sugar candy This smells like it's going to be a very complex brew.  Taste = Not as sweet as I remember it when I sampled a bottle in 2005. The alcohol and bitterness makes much more of a dominating presence. The flavor underneath is still pretty darn good though. Lots of hops that are quickly washed away by a very syrupy, bitter-sweetness. Alcohol is just a bit too much in your face. Still for being so high in alcohol, this is a tasty brew. Alcohol dominance just ruins it.  Mouthfeel = like liquid satin. Thick, soothing, comforting.. Really an incredibly experience inside the mouth.

140,2671,jslot38,3.78,"Presentation: 12 oz Stubby Bottle from '06 Spring  Appearance: Deep, hardly transparent amber. Cherry wood body covered by an eggshell head, and a large one at that after a moderatly hard pour. Never disappears, and the lacing just sticks off of it.  Smell: Pine, earth, grassy hop aromas. Slight touch of grapefruit.  Taste: Upfront pine hop blast - other earth tones intermixed throughout. Very sweet, certainly one to slowly intake. Touch of toasted biscuit at the end rounds it off.  Mouthfeel: The moderately abbrasive nature of the hops is balanced by the great slick oily feel and mid range level of carbonation.  Drinkability: At 9.6% this is a strong beer. And with this hop profile and sweetness its one to take slowly. But I don't take that as a bad thing, I like to savour my beers. For a big beer its highly drinkable.  Notes: Tasted a little green, can see why people love to lay these down for a few years. A great barleywine none the less, backs up my already strong feelings that Sierra Nevada has a great ability to implement a strong but great hop profile in their beers. Although I feel this one may use just a little too much pine inducing hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Rezzin,4.62,"Born on date of Jan 06, 2006. Poured into a pint glass.  A - Deep reddish brown with a creamy 1"" tan head that sits around for a while. As I drink the lacing covers my pint glass beautifully.  S - Malty and sweet. Very malty and sweet with a big hop nose as well. This smells like a rich rich beer. Fruity and earthy hop aroma.  T - Sweet brown sugar maltiness up front.. piny, resiny, fruity hop bitterness on the back with an alcoholic bite that's not all that bad which kinda surprises me. It really reminds me of SNCA which is one of my favorite IPA's.  M - Creamy and smooth. Slight dry alcohol aftertaste but not overly so for a barleywine.  D - This is the first time I've tried the Bigfoot barleywines from SN and plan on stocking each year's offerings. This is an excellent beer. I can't wait to try it again in a year or two.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,scruffwhor,3.36,"A 2006 vintage, so says the bottle cap.  Appearance- Pours a very small head with scant retention and no fomage. The color is a mix of red wine and plum skin. Pretty good lacing can be seen when the brew is held to the light. Pretty persistant in the bubbles ascension to the surface.  Smell- Mostly flowery hops with some viney grapes making the presence known.  Taste- Since this is such a young barlerywine, I was bracing myself for a lot of hops, and I was right on the money. Lots of grapefruity hops. But there were some sweet dark fruits and roasted malts lingering beneath the surface.  Mouthfeel- A mix of bitterness and tart. But this mox seemed rather unbalanced in presentation. The citrusy bitterness would clash with the subdued tartness/sweetness.  I know this beer recquires some more aging before its true colors show. Since I ahve a six pack of this stuff, I will leave it in my closet to be forgotten and write back when they are discovered.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Huge creamy fluffy head that leaves tons of stick all over the glass. Enormous nose of hops, oil, pine, resin, redwoods, california fog, damp bark and wet forest just to name a few. doubt me? go to chico and you'll see. extrememly balanced taste of spicy, prickly hops and sweet coating malt. flashes of fruit, brown sugar, malt backbone, drying hops. super complex and super quenching at the same time. im at a loss, this beer is just that good on tap. in the bottle its a different story and needs some cellaring for my taste. suffers slightly in drinkability cause its so dangerous and high alcohol. if youre not careful this beer will kick your ass. right on sierra. one of my all time favorites.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,asabreed,4.62,"Vintage 2002. Into a tulip. Here we go, ya'll.  Appearance: Amber with some dark brown, or is it the other way around? A bit of sediment floating in the bottom. Still after four years there's not much head, but it swirls up nicely, and the lacing spiders a bit around the glass. I still think after ten years, however, the beer, from the style, wouldn't really have a huge head or fantastic lacing.  Smell: Lots of good stuff from the malts over a few years. The hops take a kind of backseat, while the malt complexity is huge. Slight chocolate, then caramel, raspberries, and vanilla dominate. And atop all is a sherry-like sharpness, tartness, and alcoholic bite in the nose. I think this is maybe STILL too young; this has much potential as is. Getting better for sure.  Taste: I did not know this would happen, and it makes me think that I need to really start cellaring beers for much longer (which I'm at least attempting to do). Since the hops, as in the nose, take a backseat to the malt, that's not the only thing--the malt character has gotten insanely complex. I can describe it fairly easily, though the taste is much more ornate: silk chocolate raspberry cheesecake drizzled with vanilla and caramel. Sound crazy? Sure, and I don't even believe it myself really, in a way. But here's the thing, the hops are still in there, and though they have a slight bite to them, I'd say a six year-old bottle, or maybe seven, should be tops for this, or hell, maybe ten. But either way, this vintage four-year is amazing. Wonderfully complex things have developed, and I hope I can keep the 4 bottles of 2005 in my cellar for a while.  Mouthfeel: Still full, thick, velvety, but cloying. I don't know how this would change, especially since the carbonation's going to be less and less as the years go by. No complaints here at all, though.  Drinkability: This is the earliest vintage I think I've ever had, and I'm beyond impressed. Hopefully all the brews I decided to save will keep doing what this is doing. I like it green, but damn this gets much better, so if you have bottles that are four years old with some to spare, I'd certainly say crack one open. But if there's one left, well, you make the decision.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,JudgeRoughneck,4.81,"This is a dense, deep, dark, amber- ruby colored brew with a muted glow and a big bright off-white head that fades fast and leaves some delicate lacing.  The nose is amazing. First thing that hits is hops. They are old, resinous, herbal, and quite inviting. Amazingly subdued alcohol is nicely blended with yeasty aromas. The more I sniff the more I just smell grapefruit. Continued quaffing just makes this grapefruit smell more intesne. I am very impressed at the way niether the alcohol, esters, or malt are running the show here and it avoids that vapory smell. Those qualities are left in the taste, where I feel they belong.  The taste starts off with sweet, sweet, malt and citrusy and herbal hops. Vapor alcohol and berry esters show for just a second. Next comes a sublime bouquet of dark berry, red apple, and citrus fruit flavors which are scrubbed off by a slight yeast bite in the finish. Damn that is good.  The mouthfeel is light bodied but thick feeling. It is amazingly NOT slick. It does not feel like my tounge is lifting weights like other barleywines do and it really helps this beer's dangerous drinkability.  As a rule, I'm not that into barleywine. I love this one because I think it retains all the complexity of the style, yet avoids all the things I dislike usually. My favorite barleywine easily.  ADDING ON JAN 2010 - I aged a bottle of this from 2008 beer for 2 years? The longest Michael Jackson suggests in old book of his. The nose, interestingly, developed an amazing complexity, and I have very nice things to say there. Hop aroma has taken a backseat to a host of other aromas including fig, date, sage, with candied fruit flavors intensifying in the flavor and dominating a mix which also included anise, blackberry, mint, and a leathery finish. The alcohol character became a liitle oppressive and despite all the fascinating complexity this beer developed, I felt its drinkability declined severely.  Added Dec 2017 - reviewing 2013 vintage  Nose - raisin, black pepper, plum skin, dried rose petal, medium low caramel, medium low herbal hop, light note of cinnamon, medium molasses, bread crust, low vanilla, toffee, dried cherry. This beer just keeps opening up. Slight sherry\ vinous character but no overt oxidation. Super inviting and everything I want in ages strong ale.  Flavor - huge dried cherry ester with lush but attenuated malt center of caramel and toffee, explodes into a long bready finish, notes of rose and vanilla emerge, medium herbal\ blackcurrant hop character. Candied orange, cinnamon and vanilla swirl together into one tone at medium low that is beautiful. Medium hop bitterness with a light grassyness in the finish that slightly resembles blonde tobacco. Alcohol gives slight peppermintkiss to finish. Lingers in aftertaste. MF - full bodied with medium carbonation that gives the beer a lush, velvety, mouth filling texture. Alcohol is discernible and only gives the most pleasant warmth with no harshness at all.  APP - low off whites head that persists, no legs, deep ruby amber, excellent clarity  Overall- exceptional aged strong ale, absolutely beautiful, wasn't expecting much but cellared so well this will stand out as one of the best beers i ever drank, and probably the best U.S. Style b wine I've ever had. Really hasn't oxidized negatively in five years and is probably why it shines like it does.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Having a roommate from Chico for two years didn't hurt either.  Pours a deep, dark amber/red. Complex smells of a fine selection of malts and hops. A sipping beer if there's ever been one. In true Sierra Nevada tradition, one of the hoppiest BW's I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. Maybe it's me, but the 2006 seems hoppier than past years, which doesn't bother me at all.

DAMN.  1994 - also had a 12 year old to compare with the '06 and I could not have had a different beer. The '94 had just a little foam around the edges, was dark ruby and cloudy, smelled sweet and fruity, tasted like chocolate with rum soaked raisins and a hint of mint in the back, although some earthy hops showed up later in the glass.

Nose is full of caramel and butterscotch maltiness. Light wood and oxidized notes throughout. Hops are still prominent, but a bit smoother than fresh samples. The malt and hop flavors melt into each other better than I remember. The oxidized notes are most noticeable in the long, bitter finish and they give the malt more of a Scotch whiskey character.

Warm alcohol fades as it warms, but never dissappears, instead blending in with the rich, toasty malts and piney hops for a full taste.

Sweet and sticky, and the bitterness is really quite intense. A persistent aftertaste that is a bit too much.  Mouthfeel: Relatively medium-bodied, with a certain smoothness.

140,2671,cdondera,3.89,"Presentation: 12 oz. bottle...2006 vintage, poured into a snifter. Served at cellar temperature.  Appearance: A gorgeous amber color with a dense one-finger off-white head that dissapates quickly. When the glass is tilted, a small amount of lacing is welded to the side.  Smell: I'm surprised that I don't get a bit more here, but what I do get is a hint of fruity sweetness, a preview of the hops that are sure to follow in the first drink and just a bit of caramel.  Taste: Wow...my nose didn't fail me, there is the hop bitterness right up front, but it is complemented later on by the malt character that follows. The fruitiness and caramel that I detected makes its presence known in the middle (along with a bit of citrus) and the finish is where the alcohol comes to the forefront.  Mouthfeel: This beer is smooth and a little syrupy (like a good barleywine should be). As it warms, it just keeps getting better and better.  Drinkability: I'm thinking that I could probably do a full six pack, as long as I steered clear of cars and heavy machinery! Like a good imperial IPA, these go down easy and hide the higher ABV. But let's not kid ourselves...this is no session beer.  Verdict: A great beer, but a bit young and brash. This one could use a year of cellaring to mellow out if you have the willpower.

The head does creep to edges of the glass but never dissipates altogether. The lacing was good as well.  The smell is very noticeable. Quite hoppy for a barelywine with some bubblegum hops and grapefruit essence. A touch of pine and citrus around the edges as well. A good malt around rounds out the background but hops are most noticeable.  The taste has a great hop presence. The malt is much more noticeable then the smell would indicate but still the hops are more dominate. (I;m thinking if aged the malt would become more balanced). The malt is basic flavor with some sweet grain taste. A touch of caramel but mostly sweet malt. The hops are well balanced in themselves. The bittering is noticeable with piney tastes that give a good bite that isn't overwhelming. It finishes well with a sticky grapefruit taste that gives it the bubblegum taste.  The body is good. The phenol is a little strong but I think more aging would help give it more balance.

140,2671,benito,4.12,"Meditations on the 2006 expedition. A genre-bender of a beer.  Bigfoot, a self-proclaimed barleywine, explores that grey area between that distinguishes barleywines from strong IPAs, both by keeping the ABV rather low and by upping the hop ante for a barleywine. This brew is a clear amber that shows hints of tangerine when held to direct light. The head clumps and lingers throughout a pint.  The bouquet shouts hoppiness: a citrus-filled cornucopia of aromas--lemon and grass being the most distinct odors. Similarly, the flavor itself is dominated by citrus upfront and then followed by a bitter smack on the back of the tongue. The lingering aftertaste is dry and bitter. This is a heavy-bodied brew with lots of strength across the palate, and not surprisingly is a sipper. Though, for a barleywine I suppose the citrus adds a refreshing drinkability that is often absent in the style. Overall, truly a hop lover's dream come true.  But Bigfoot, beyond its own characteristics, asks larger questions about fidelity to style and those hazy boundaries between say a Double IPA and a barleywine. Should I think about Bigfoot relative to other barleywines? By claiming barleywine on the label, do I have a right (or maybe even obligation) to expect a certain style of beverage? Or, on the other hand is the ultimate worth of Bigfoot measured simply by how enjoyable it is in its own right? Should my review reflect Bigfoot-as-a-barleywine? Would labeling it a ""Double IPA"" make any difference whatsoever? Do these sorts of postmodern musings matter to anyone but the critic?  In any case, this beer--whatever it is--is one to remember and savor.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Damn this is not for the feint of heart. Double bastard comes to mind as far as the over the top aggressive flavor. Where the beers become completely differnent is the Bigfoot has a somewhat sweet caramel presence that tames it enough to keep it interesting. Alcohol serves as a spiced up finish with intense and linger aftertaste.  This is one of the bigger beers I've had to date. Not in abv% but in the massiveness of the flavours.

But warming it really brought out some flavors slightly overshadowed in the cooler version I had the first time around.  Big big hops, but only a passing attempt at balance. The sugery candy comes out, but only after a full frontal attack on the tastebuds by a team of piney hops and grassy hops.  Oily and a bit hot. I suspect time will ease off the alchohol a bit, and produce a real winner. For those that think that aging beer is foolish, I think in a year this bottle could convert thee.  Overall, a good beer, but falls short of greatness. But lest I hammer home my ideas on aging this one, I think greatness is just over the horizon.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,doctorjoeyboey,4.25,"The appearance is a dark ruby red with more head than I would have expected although still fairly minimal. I had never had a barleywine before so I didn't know what to expect. The smell is very fruity like an IPA, yet more solid. The taste is bitter like an IPA but has a much nicer taste on the back palatte than most IPAs that I have had. The mouthfeel is pretty good for a bitter beer. Considering the price, taste, and alcohol content of this beer, I would consider buying it again and possibly drinking several in a night.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Phatz,4.07,"This beer pours a complex coppery caramel amber with an off white head.  Smell: BIG! This is a big beer and it lets you know it from the start. Flamboyant floral hops lead in the nose. They are paralleled by a sugary sweet deep dark malt base, mmm.  Taste: The taste is as big as the smell. I would not consider this a balanced beer although it has a balance of flavors. It has an extreme sweet toasty malt, brown sugar and dark fruit characteristic. It also has an extreme grapefruit citrus tart and piney hop bitter. They do run parallel but not blended. The nose and the beginning of this beer seems dominated by the former, that is the sweet malt and as it passes through the middle it move to the latter that is a yeasty hop citrus pine bitter. I must admit I am not a big fan of the pine aftertaste in my beers but this does not go to extreme and I can enjoy it. I do prefer this beer with cheese as a chaser to help neutralize the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: This is a medium thick beer that is smooth through the middle and has a dry finish.  Drinkability: This is a tasty beer but for me the hop bitterness is a bit much to consider it highly drinkable. It goes down enjoyable but with some effort.  Hope this is helpful.

140,2671,hoffman,4.49,"This is a damn fine brew. 2006 edition is my first bout with bigfoot and it came through big time. Pours from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass with a nice, slow-to-rise two and a half finger head of both big and small air pockets The head fills a pint glass perfectly and about 1/2 and inch still remains even 10 minutes later, lacing all the way down. THe color is rich red with golden hues throughout. The smell is phenomenal, honey, citrus, BIG floral hops, spice, and some piney notes. If you hold this one out in front of you as you walk you can catch faint hints of the aroma in the air it is that pronounced. The taste is right on with the smell, some might say the hops are overpowering, and definately they are present, but there is a depth to this beer like none I have had before. The hops are just gravy. There is great flavor from citrus notes, sweet malt, organic grains and even some subdued dark fruits. An exceptional taste from this brew. The mouthfeel is nice with a tingling carbonation and smooth texture. Not everyone will like this one. But you have to admit, if you have tried it, there are so many things happening here that it cannot go without comment.  Cheers to SN on this one. Thanks.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Enola,3.98,This is a exceptional barlywine. I had it on-tap last night at the Olde Hickory Taproom.  The beer was served in a Chimay glass. It had little head. The color was a deep mahogony. There was really not much smell that I could pick up on. The taste was very good. It reminded me a little bit of 90 min. only better. There was a pretty big fruit taste. The mouthfeel had no bite at all. The smoothest high ABV beer I have had. The alcohol was there but just not too overpowering. I will drink these again and again. This beer affected my ability to keep a bowling ball between the gutters.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,MEANxOLDxTOM,3.78,"When, 2006 vintage, I poured the beer it was a deep amber color, with the slightish tint of read. The head was a cream color, and it hund agound for about a minute or two, but never completely disapated. Carbonation was average, but too much, but enough to keep a little of the head around. The remaining head remained on the sides of the glass while I drank.  Keeping in the tradition of the Sierra Nevada the cascade hops were in full effect. From drinking other barleywines I was not quite prepared for this, so I was waiting until I drank a second to write a review. The smell of the hops was strong. Almost an herby/fruit smell, with the slightest hint of alcohol, but the alcohol is not a bad thing in this case.  Taste wise it has a hint of fruit? as soon as it hits your mouth, but that soon turns to a slight alcohol taste, and then into the sierra signature hopps. This beer seemed to me to be medium bodied, slighty heavy on the stomach.  Drinkability....I was surprised by the first one, so I sat on it for a couple days and then drank another. I am just gettting into the heavily hopped beers, and I know thats what the brewer was going for. If you are into highly hopped beers this one is right up your alley. I liked the second one more than the first so I recommend at least drinking two. If you like Sierra Nevada in general deffinitly try it you should not be disappointed, if you don't like their Pale Ale I would not reccommend the Bigfoot for you.  I hear that the malt comes out if you let it age a year so I think that I will sit on one of these until next winter to check for a difference in taste.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,JiminKY,4.45,"2006 Vintage  I had the 2005 Bigfoot, last year, as my first Barleywine and first strong (~10% abv) beer. I remembered it being remarkably good and insanely drinkable. The 2006 version reminds me exactly why. This beer is spectacular.  A - Poured a beautiful clear cedar color with a quarter inch off-white head. A ""thick"" and ""oily"" pour. Light lace rings remain at stopping points as the glass slowly empties.  S - The aroma is heavenly--sweet, flowery and fruity all rolled together. Tempting, to say the least.  T - Sierra Nevada certainly knows how to do hops, and this is a showcase of their finest accomplishment in that area. A perfect strong hop bitterness combines with smooth underlying malt flavors to form a fullness of taste that ranks among the top beers avaialable for ""hop heads."" The best tasting Barleywine I have tasted, hands down.  M - Slick and full mouthfeel, really coats every inch of the palate with its deliciousness.  D - If there's one downfall to this beer it's that it is WAY TOO DRINKABLE. I remember going through 5 of my 6 2005 Bigfoots in one session.

Hop aroma subdued in these samples.  The '02 was a bit raisiny with a stiff almost harsh bitterness. The '03 had an intense caramel flavor and was also quite bitter and piney. The '05 was perfect. Caramel was toned down quite a bit. Hops were gloriously juicy. Great finish. Definitely the '05 was my favorite of the 3.  Overall: It's impressive how different the Bigfoot is in different years.

The beer smells of dark fruits possibly plums or prunes. There is also the very expected smell of hops associated with the beer. The first taste that hits you with this one is the hops. There is also a citrus (grapefruit) flavor that comes along with this one. Additionally the same dark fruit flavors that were associated with the aromas are present. Fantastic mouthfeel.

A small, off-white, foamy dissapears rather quickly leaving minimal lacing on the glass.  Smell: Sweet, dark fruits, with hints of caramel and brown sugar and rubbing alcohol.  Taste: Initial bitterness of piney hops dominate the beginning, the middle transitions to a malty, caramel like semi-sweetness. Alcohol dominates the finish, almost astringent, bittering hops make an appearance leaving a lasting impression on the tongue.  Mouthfeel: Medium to thick, moderately carbonated and somewhat slick and oily.  Drinkability: The 2006 Bigfoot could use some time in the cellar. Very hot with alcohol dominating. Once this baby mellows a bit to let the other flavors through, this would be a fantastic barleywine. As it stands now its merely good. A beer to be sipped for sure.

140,2671,budsboy,3.73,"2006 edition. Pours ruby red, thick tan and sticky head. Lots of bubble trails in there.  All piney hop aroma, some toffee and alcohol. Reminds me of Celebration.  Rich toffee, carmel, but mostly BIG piney hops. A boistrous floral hop bitter finish. Huge amount of hops in this. Alcohol is apparent, making this one almost hot.  Smooth, almost oily mouthfeel. Medium bodied.  Hop monster, this. Maybe after six months or a year in the cellar it'll settle down. I sense there are more flavors in there, but the hops just simply overpower. I'll stuff the other bottle in a dark place and dig it up later.  Thanks, again, the Mr. Hustlemuscle for the samples.  UPDATE: After a year in the cellar, this beer holds up very nicely. As a matter of fact, the above review still applies.  2008  Pours a deep reddish amber with a sticky, thick white head.  Hoppy aroma for sure, but with some true sweet malt smells as well, fruity and a smidge bready. Alcohol is detectable.  Taste is on par with aroma. Bitter hops, sweet fruity malts and a wallop of warming alcohol. There is a tanginess in there as well, a citrusy, grapefruit like bitterness. A palate buster, but what a beautiful palate buster it is.  Full, oily mouthfeel. Meaty and slick.  I'm having the last of three six packs.

A great cascade hop smell, but maybe another or two in the mix. This just has an awesome smell. Tastes very strong. The hops stand out right at the beginning--citrusy and piney, but it is followed with a pretty good malt kick. It tastes just a little nutty. The most notable thing about this one is the big kick of alcohol in the mouthfeel though the taste is only minimal-giving it a little fruity taste.

It is hoppy, sweet, citrusy and loaded with pine tree. For a barley wine though I would say it is mild.  Taste/mf: More like SNPA than celeration because it lacks much malty goodness but it still kicks your ass. Awesome hop punch and dry citrys flavor rapes your tastebuds. The mouthfeel is slick and sticky, medium.  Overall this tastes like a cracked out double ipa more than a barleywine. There eisn't enough mouth waming going on here. Don't get me wrong it is a great beer, but it is missing something to be called a barleywine. But i am reviewing this as a beer for some reason i am not docking it in points because it kicks ass.

I generally prefer beers with a good balance of malt and hops. I set this brew in the cellar back in 2000 because it was too hoppy for my tastes. That said, 6 years in the cellar and this beer is wonderful! It poured a wonderful deep amber color with good carbonation. The head was nice even and steady through most of the glass.  Smell is definitely citrus almost to the point of warm ripe fruit. Not offensive in any way, but a blend of wonderful smells that make you want to take a sip.  Taste is rich and full. Malty sweetness paired with a medium solid citrus / orange taste. Interestingly enough there was a nice toffee undertone just at the edge of the tongue.  Some sediment was evident in the glass. I didn't notice sediment in the bottle and wasn't expecting this. Not a detractor at all.  Based on the results of this tasting I will definitely be putting a case or two of this in my beer cellar.

As it warms, a bit more malt comes through.  Tastes quite bitter, more bitterness than I was expecting. Some maltiness comes through as well, but mostly I taste the bitterness. As it warms, just as with the smell, more maltiness comes through. But the hops are quite apparent.  Thick, warming mouthfeel.

140,2671,RJLarse,2.36,"I went to a local craft beer shop and picked up two of these for tasting. Ive never had a barley wine before so I wanted to give it a try. This one comes highly recommended. I poured this beer in to a pint tumbler.  A medium dark copper color in the glass, with a creamy off-white head. The head is resilient, and left a medium to heavy lacing on the side of the glass while drinking.  The smell is strong, fruity and hoppy. I also think it smells a little like bourbon or whiskey.  The taste is fairly neutral at first, a little sweet and malty, but once you allow air to join the brew in your mouth it turns quite bitter. The taste of alcohol is present, which gets back to the bourbon/whiskey aroma. The aftertaste is quite strong and bitter as well. The aftertaste lingers for quite a while, and seems to be revived from to time in the mouth even without drinking more of the beer.  The mouth feel of this beer is sharp and biting.  This beer is not particularly drinkable. I found myself drinking this one slowly, and frankly not enjoying it very much. It might go well paired with some sort of robust food to quell the aftertaste. I cant see myself drinking more than one of these in a blue moon. Perhaps barley wine is an acquired taste?

Pours a dark amber with a mild head, moderate lacing and weak carbonation.  The smell is predominately citrusy hops with very mild malt undertones.  The first taste is WHOA bittering hops for this American barleywine, and a weak malty sweetness barely holding on for dear life and some alcohol notes creeping in at the very finish.  As I finished the glass, the malt came through a bit more, but it was still predominately hops.  Mouthfeel is sticky and cloying, with the hops stuck in the back of my mouth.  I have a feeling I won't be able to drink more than one or two of these in a sitting.  I know it's an American barleywine, but it's just too hoppy. Sierra Nevada is often guilty of just throwing hops at their beers, and it works about 90% of the time. The other 10% of the time, the result is that the hops mask the other flavors, and the beer has poor hop/malt balance.

Leaves considerable lacing on the glass.  Being fresh, this has a super hoppy nose, it is so hoppy that perhaps it isn't even hops I smell, but pure alpha acids. It almost has a slightly metallic hop smell, which is pleasant, but very strong.  The flavor of this beer is much the same as the aroma, hops, hops, and hops, with only a slight hint of malt. The hop tingle lingers on your tongue for quite a while. While it is somewhat creamy, this is borderline undrinkable right now, due to the very harsh hops, and prevalent alcohol.

Glorious hops!... tremendously unbalanced as the aroma would suggest... barely perceptable malt, but simply dominating hops. Some definite lemon-zest becomes noticeable as the beer warms.  Tight and puckering mouthfeel... moderate thickness.... i could actually use it a bit thicker, but its a small complaint.  While this beer is fantastic, I think the drinkability is limited by its harsh hop profile and its abv.... that being said... god I love this beer... its a slap to your palate in the most absurd of ways.

T- Big up front bitter that is softer that the past or maybe I have gotten harder. Lots of malt flavors and a little syrupy with alcohol popping out all over the place. M- Chewy and syrupy yes but still thinner than I remember.

140,2671,doubleipa,4.67,"'06 Version. I had an '05 last night. Is this really the same beer? Aroma was DIPA hoppy. Not much of a maly smell, at all. Rocky, light-brown head, excellent lacing, and the head lasted a long time. Moderately sweet early and long. Really does taste/smell more like a DIPA than ""classic"" barleywines"". Body was light to medium. Really can't taste the alcohol. This has made me re-think whether I want to age an entire case for future consumption. Hmmm I think I'll review after 6 months and see what happens. 2/17/06 Update. Had the '06 on tap last night. Now I'm really confused. I expected big hoppiness, but was dissapointed. Malt characteristics were much stronger than hops. The waitress assured me that this was the '06 version, not '05.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,poluti,4.18,"Pours creamy tan head with great retension (plenty of carbonation bubbles up the side). It's a dark copper color skewed towards the red side. Overall, a great looking beer. The alcohol is definitely noticable in this beer. It was very fruity in aroma. The taste is balanced extremely well. The chewy malt and the hop kick go side by side for a great session. The mouthfeel is thick with a pleasant lingering on the back of the tongue. Overall it's a pretty strong beer. I will definitely drink it again but stay to one or two a night.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,LordChesterfield,4.22,"This is a royal brew. Big in every way and elegant at the same time. The smell is a wonderful piney smell that resembles boulevard's nutcracker ale. The taste is very bitter but easy to get used to and is complemented with a slick oily mouthfeel. Hop oils? Dark copper in color and a head that can be incited to stand but will soon diminish to a lacing. This beer is one of the strongest in terms of ABV I've had and I can't even taste the alcohol because of the hops. As far as I'm concerned, every bit of hop bitterness is needed to balance the otherwise cloying sweetness. Drinkability of course is subjective but at 9.6%ABV so much hops, two of these goes a long way. Complex and tough, this beer has too much class for you.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Head fades quickly, but lacing clings to the glass like there is no tomorrow.  S: Balanced and big smell. Lots of malt at first with a good smash of piney hops. Need a Bigfoot air freshener for my car.  T/M: Thick malt taste while beer dances on my tongue. Lots of sweet flavors (carmel?) that are difficult to identify. Big/piney hop taste washes the palate clean.  D: Lots of alcohol, but still very drinkable. Thick and enjoyable mouthfeel that makes it fun to drink. Could lead to a lot of trouble (almost 10% abv) if I didnt have a big meal in my stomach.  Notes: Been looking forward to this beer for a long time, and it does not disappoint.

Everything I was looking forward -- Sierra Nevada hit the nail with this one. Surprised it was a twist off top. Chewy malt goodness, this is the best tasting barley wine I've tried so far.

The aroma is bursting with hops, citrusy, piney and resiny with a big fruit component (tangerine, lemon, and grapefruit), nice molasses sweetness, toasted bread, esters and some alcohol. The taste is initially sweet with caramel and molasses flavors, but quickly segues into an intense hoppines (grapefruit, orange peel, pine resin, floral), chewy toasted bread and molasses, fruity esters and some warming alcohol. The mouthfeel is rich and chewy, with moderate carbonation, and a waming, bitter finish. Drinkability is good for a barleywine.

Aroma is a cornecopia of chewy, thick malt notes, burnt molasses, dark caramel, with PLENTY of fruity, grapefruit, tangerine peel, and green pine hop.  Flavor is a tug of war between massive malt chewiness and oily hop bitterness. Hop oils are piercing and tongue coating, with notes of grapefruit skin, orange, fresh bitter herbs, and oozing pine sap. So damn hoppy, but achieves great balance and huge drinkability regardless. Good as ever and ever good!  Body just shy of being big, with an oily, chewy texture and expansive mouthfeel. Hop flavors provide a long, complex finish.

140,2671,gotbeer,4.55,"2006 edition this time around. It's still as great as I remember it, much like my last review. Huge citrus, piney hops with a massive malt profile to balance it out. A little alcohol at the end, but well hidden for a brew of this ABV. All in all- one of the great barleywines, I should say, beers out there.

Pours nice rich dark amber shade, nice quarter inch head quickly dissapates to just an oily patch in the middle of my snifter, but nice ring remains around the outside. A nice aroma of hops and bisquity malt, some oily pine resin present but not overwhelming. A more subdued aroma than I was anticpating.  Wow, the malt and hops both very aggressive upfront, me likes. A very bitter finish, warms the back of my toungue and throat. I quickly want to quaf this again...here we go. An excellent balence of intense hops with a strong malt backbone.

The aroma, while good, doesn't even begin to hint at the bomb of taste sensation that is about to go off in your mouth.

140,2671,GCBrewingCo,4.5,"2006 edition.  The beer poured into the glass clear medium amber with an off-white and frothy head which rose well and fell slowly to lace the glass.  The aroma was fruity and fresh with a piney and resinous citrus hop presence. The hops were fresh and even a bit floral with a background of maltiness, caramel most notable. The fruitines was orange and grapefruit hop characteristics.  The flavor was nicely achieved with a strong malt backbone of caramel malt. The bittering was resinous and piney with more citrus fruity character. While the balance of the flavor was decidedly bitter, the malt presence was very well done and made for a great flavor profile.  The finish was dry with lasting piney and resinous hop bittering and flavor long into the aftertaste. The body was full. The carbonation level made for an easy drinking beer and alcohol only really played a factor in the warming that occurred after consumption.  12 ounce bottle.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,rodrot,4.42,"2004 expedition. This beer poured a hazy, reddish-brown color into my imperial pint glass. Wonderful hoppy, fruity aromas waft from the glass. The taste is incredible as always for this beer, but since it has been aging for a couple of years, the intense hoppiness has subdued quite a bit. The hops are definitely present and still quite aggressive with every taste, but the malt and sweetness is more pronounced now. This brew has rounded out pretty well and I'm looking forward to picking up some fresh 2006 expedition in NC this year. I love this beer aged or fresh, makes no difference to me.

140,2671,Domingo,4.24,"2005 edition. What a great Barleywine! I was looking for something good for cold-weather and I stumbled upon this brew at a small store. Cherry-red with mahogany highlights. In the light, definitely very reddish. Smell is VERY hoppy. For a barleywine, only Hog Heaven has more hop character. Remniscent of their celebration Ale, Actually. Beyond the initial wave of hops, there's a definitey fruity smell. Flavor is sweet, with a little bitterness on the back end. Hop bitterness is there, but not really that strong. It's actually much sweeter than the smell lets on. A spot-on barleyine flavor. Reminds me a little of brandied cherries. Hops come through in the finish, but luckily don't steal the show. They're more there in the smell. Alcohol is definitely there for warmth and a little extra malty sweetness. Not as sweet as some BW's, but definitely not as much of a hop bomb as the smell implies. Mouthfeel is just right. Not too thick or thin. Drinkability is limited by the alcohol. At nearly 10%, I can't see drinking more than 2 of these in one sitting without getting tipsy or numbing your buds. With that said, that's the way the style SHOULD work!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Saved this one until now. This last one is simply amazing to me. The beer poured a nice amber color with a small head that dissipated quickly. The smell is a very intense mixture of very strong hops, pine, fruit, and alcohol. The taste was a very bitter hoppiness initially and then the malts kicked in. Nice! It was quite intense but I loved it. Some might say the drinkability is tough but I say its really good. Definitely would behoove anyone to sip this beer slowly over time though.

The aroma is full of hops but also very noticeable is the toffee, chocolate, and caramel. Loads of flavor with this one. Citrus and pine from the hops, caramel sweetness, and a little toffee.

Slick almost oily feel, long-lasting aftertaste combines malt sweetness, hops and alcohol warmth. would go well with hearty food, but is probably best saved for ""after dinner"" relaxation.

140,2671,SkeeterHawk,3.92,"Though I don't believe that the different years of this brew should be lumped together, here is my review of the '05  Appearance: The beer poured a cloudy reddish brown color with only a 1/4"" head of tannish bubbles at first pour. The head only retained for about a minute or so, and left a still glass of liquid in its wake.  Aroma: The aroma is really vinous this year! There is a whole lot of rich red wine aroma that almost dominates the malt. There are hops in spades here also. I hardly know what to mention first. There are some rich citrusy and plum notes. Man, There is a lot going on in the aroma of this beer...more so than I recall in previous years.  Taste: The flavor is really bold! There is a whole lot of spiciness form the alcohol. The flavor is much more mild than the aroma would suggest. There is a whole bunch of malt, but the Sierra guys aren't shy with their hops. Though this beer is super malty, it still finishes hoppy. Amazing!  Opinion: I really like this beer for the most part, but this particular year is definitely balanced way more toward the bitter than I have noticed in previous years. There is much more hop presence to this beer, and at this point, it is a bit harsh...so I almost think that they changed the profile of their liquor. This is still good, and it will be interesting to see how it turns out in a couple years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

I couldnt help to take a big whiff and enjoy just the smell first. Definitely some citrus notes but not too strong. The taste didnt disappoint either. The alcohol bite hit first then hops punch with the spices all at once. I enjoyed the alcohol bite but my roommate wished he went with the 02 they had which we were told had a slightly smoother taste. Definitely a thick mouth coating beer.

Caramel and vinous fruit flavors upfront give way to a substantial citric hop bite and finishes with a touch of alcohol and lingering hop bitterness. Sweet but not cloying. Full-bodied. Light carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel with a drying bitter hoppy aftertaste.  This beer is fully loaded with agenerous malt profile and even more generous hop addition. Alcohol is noticeable, but doesnt detract despite its impressive percentage. Ill check back after I cellar the rest of this six pack.

Fullish body, still chewy and bitter. Bigfoot is a bit tired after his long journey. Where once he was hugely hoppy and strong, he is now ready for retirement.

Appearance  The brown barleywine has a tan one-finger head with light retention, as much as can be expected with the higher alcohol content, and very little lacing.  Smell  What a nosy beer! Theres a lot to smell here. Dark citrus and spicy fruits mix with deep caramelly herbal malt scents.  Taste  The beer is close to undrinkable (for my palate) being this young  and I like bitterness. This will be a superb beer to cellar for several years. The taste is decidedly alcoholic and bready with deep caramel chocolate tastes underscored by a medicinal backbone with raisin and spice tastes throughout. There is something unique here, and I have a hard time putting it into words. I enjoy this beer, even though I can tell Id enjoy it more much later in its life. Its still too young for me.  Mouthfeel  This has a very alcoholic, chewy mouth feel. It somehow comes across as being both creamy and coarse at the same time; the coarseness probably from the 9.60% ABV. Full bodied.

140,2671,BEERchitect,4.5,"With the release of this annual Barleywine, I am aways taken back to the firt time tasting this massive beverage. With extremes of hops colide with extremes of malt, you don't see the finess of balance comming....  This godfather of the American Barleyine style jumps out of the bottle and lands with a masculine viscocity that's caught somewhere between viscous and crisp. Deep bronze in color, the beer is quite clear for such a hop-forward flavor. Froathy off-white foam blankets the surface of the beer and much of the glass, making it difficult to know where the head character ends and the lacing begins. It's to be expected of a richly malted beer with a generous hop contingency.  Molasass and toffee malt aromas reach the nose, along with an abundance of pine and grapefruit scented hops. Esters of cherry, plumb, and currant help to bridge the hop-malt divide, and to give a sense of meldedness to the nose.  Malt dominance is evidence with the very first sip; with the strong sweetness of black strap molasass, barley sugars, and sturdy malt taste. But the hops provide an attack of white grapefruit, citrus piths, pine resin, and a smooth pang of bitterness... Nether allowing any ground to the other- somewhat combative in taste, but strikingly harmoneous in balance. (Kinda like tango with Fred and Ginger).... Meanwile, back at the ranch- The strong brandy-strength esters of cherry, berry, plumb, grape, and dates begin to sew the flavors together for an intense dichotomy in the mouth.  Strong and matly early, but with the dryness of hop and alcohol late tells the tale of two halves: malty rich and velvety smooth to mid palate then turns IPA-ish with malty-dry textures and alcoholic warmth leading to a strong and dense beer that's way more drinkable than it should be.  A long, dry linger of barley and hops continues to develop in aftertaste making this beer as drinkable as you want it to be, and as savory as you want it to be. That's the beauty in this classy ale!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

And one final thing that I will not say that he's my brother and I'm just doing a little trash talking. This is probably gonna get deleted for clowning around too much, huh? Well hopefully Pat sees it and gets a laugh first, I don't think he believed that I would actually review it, so if you delete it, please beer mail him and let him know that I reviewed it, thank you.  On to the review:  Appearance: Very nice, darkish color, I'm not very good with colors. It poured nicely and left very little fizz.  Smell: It was very Wheat-like in smell, I think it may have been the hops, it was a very natural smell, it was enjoyable, and not too offensive.  Taste: Personally, I liked it. It's sharp, and it lingers in the throat. It doesn't mess around, you'll definitely know you're drinking a serious brew when this one hits you.  Mouthfeel: I loved the mouthfeel. It was great. I think that's about all that needs to be said about the mouthfeel.  Drinkability: After finally getting a decent definition of drinkability, I'd say the drinkability of this beer is very low; however, due to the high alcohol content and the nice taste, I feel that it should be drank slow and savored; therfore, I give the drinkability a 3.5 because, while hard to drink, I believe it is an appropriate amount of drinkability.  Thank you, that is all. This is my first review.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,germaniac,4.37,"Pours a deep reddish brown. Hazy gold highlights are visible when the light hits it just so.  Smells mainly of heavy, sweet malt. Very nice caramel smoothness to it. Alcohol is present and accounted for with a nice bite.  Tastes like malted maple brown sugar, with a tongue tantalizing fruity hoppiness. The alcohol bite only makes itself known after the other flavors have worked my tastebuds over with a decent impression of Apollo Creed.  Fairly thick feeling in my mouth. But still a joy to drink, even in it's infancy. Totally worth it to buy a sixer and enjoy them in the future.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Holyterror,4.27,"Sierra Nevada is known for crafting brews that perfectly exemplify their style. This is no different than any of their other offerings. English barleywine this is not. This is what only a bunch of hop-crazy Americans could come up with. This review is of the 2005 vintage, consumed young.  Bigfoot poured a deep copper with a moderate-sized, creamy head that laced the glass fairly well. The aroma was immediately striking, with delicious estery goodness practically slapping you in the face. A zesty fruitiness and raw alcoholic glory play tug-of-war in your nose. Anticipation is high at this point.  Taste is amazing. Being a hophead, I delighted in the spiciness imparted by the cascades and/or centennials (there's no mistaking these hops). Subtle yeast flavors are all over the place, and its hard to identify them all. A little mellowing would allow these characteristics to surface more easily. Alcohol is evident, but not overbearing. It is at the level where it blends in with the other spicy flavors present, and is quite balanced for such a raw barleywine. Bigfoot has a solid malt backbone that is very bready, but entirely counteracted by the hops. As it approaches room temperature, a little diacetyl buffer appears between the malt and the hops. Purely delicious.  Mouthfeel is good. The slightly syrupy viscosity is expected, and it goes down easily compared to some other similar offerings. This is quite drinkable for such a huge style. The 9.6% alcohol could sneak up on you rather quickly if you were to get the notion of making this a session beer (unlikely for most people).  If you're into cellaring, this could be a real fun beer to experiment with. I can get a sixer for $13; that's six years of cheap entertainment. If nothing else, this is a hophead's alternative to English barleywine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,NeroFiddled,4.56,"Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. ""Bigfoot"" 12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle ""PKGD 12/29/21C 2017"". Sampled 03/30/22 $2.99 @ Total Wine & More, Cherry Hill, NJ  Notes via stream of consciousness: Somehow my review of Bigfoot got clipped down to just a little bit of meaninglessness at the end of what was a rather long review so I'm doing it again. I'm really disappointed with that loss because I also included tasting notes from aged bottles that are now forever lost. Basically what I said was that I don't really believe in aging beers to improve them although some beers do change, and depending on your tastes, that could be seen as a benefit to you. In my case, I used to like Bigfoot with a year or two of cellar time on it as it seemed to soften the hop flavors and gave the appearance of a smoother bitterness. That's not to say that I didn't also enjoy it fresh. Finally, what my notes showed, to me at least, was that it drops off drastically after that initial one to two year period, and given enough time you've basically got a drain pour. So, back to the fresh beer in front of me, it's a hazy dark copper/chestnut brown in color beneath a thumb's width of khaki colored foam. The aroma is both malty and hoppy, with notes of bread, caramel, citrus, and pine. It's actually very much like their fresh-hopped Celebration IPA but not as hoppy, and that should come as no surprise as they both use the same hops: Cascade, Centennial, and Chinook. Also not surprising is that it tastes very much as it smells. There's a wider malt character, and some dried red berries and raisins, but everything else remains. The alcohol is clearly present but not bright or harsh in any way. It's solidly bitter but there's also a lot of malt to it. It's listed at 90 IBUs but it probably seems more like 70. Another thing I can say is that the beer has changed over the years. That's partially due to the agricultural nature of it, and equipment and process as well. What's before me now is not as harshly bitter as it was in say, 1993. These things can't ever be proven because of a pesky little thing called time, but the human brain is an amazing tool and we can perceive far more than any machine that we've ever built. As Sierra Nevada progressed they got better at brewing, as did the entire industry based on new technology and research. I have no doubt that the dissolved oxygen levels in this beer are much better than they were in the past. Who knows when they even started measuring D.O.? Certain years would have been better than others, and that would have made a greater difference in the aging. I won't go into that because there's a whole book in that but let me finish up with why I've scored this beer so high. On a scale of 1 to 5 regarding the qualities of a beer brewed to style, Bigfoot is basically the first American barleywine out there. It's the one that all others are measured against, or at least it was in 1983. It was a high quality beer back then, and still is. It's even better made now. That takes it almost to a 5 just to begin with as it set the benchmark. The same is true for their Pale Ale. Of course, other beers have come along that have improved upon or changed the style, particularly on the pale ale side, but Bigfoot remains a classic. One final note, as with all of the Sierra Nevada beers, it's about balance. The early years of Bigfoot delivered a less balanced beer than what I'm drinking now and I still loved it. It was a different time. They've now reigned it in a bit but that just makes it better given that it's 39 years later. This is not just a classic of the style, it's the original, and that's at least worth a 4 1/2 out of 5.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Aroma is malty sweet with bits of fruitiness and a slight hop presence. Its flavor is a blend of dark fruit, hops and has a slight alcohol presence. There is a bit of chocolate near the end as well.

This one has mellowed out a little since its purchase....I like what i taste  mouthfeel: smooth and creamy, chewey alcohol rich texture  drinkability: good for the style  Prior to last winter I knew sierra nevada for the ever popular pale ale, the average porter, and pretty good stout.

Then the aroma comes at you. It's filled with a lot of maltiness followed by a light spruce and resin smell with a bit of a grapefruit note.  When it first hits your tongue, there is a mellow sweetness followed by a heavy bitterness and saltiness that lasts in duration. This full-bodied beer, has a flat and oily mouthfeel with a very noticable alcohol aftertaste.

140,2671,PatYoda,2.22,"2005 Version  Appearance is perfect. Nice clear mahogany with a perfect 1 finger creamy head of miniscule bubbles. Leaves lacing all the way down the glass, which is very unexpected for the style. Smell is almost all hops, and I'm not talking the nice citrusy hops that I love. Pure pine needles. There is actually some caramel malt smell underneath everything, just barely. Unfortunately it doesn't show up in the taste. At first the hops bite hard. Like eating pine needles. Then you wait for the initial hop bite to subside and for the malt to smooth things over...and you can wait all day if you want, but it never happens. The finish is even worse - it's pure bitterness. There is absolutely no flavor that lingers in the mouth, just bitterness, and linger it does! Mouthfeel is actually pretty good. Nice and thick and creamy like I like my barleywines. Right now I don't care how good this will taste in 10 years, it's nearly undrinkable at the moment.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Very nice strong aroma of flowery hops, notes of honey and fruits too, hints of oak and caramel. Full and rich mouthfeel.

Looks is very inviting, like a soda, but once you taste... I get impressions of brown sugar and maple syrup, but not too much. No complex aged components yet, but it still carried a good bit of IPA hops.

The sticky, air-filled head looked wonderful in my Trois Pistoles chalice. The aroma was filled with a west coast cascade hop punch. This was like a IIPA nose. The taste was very reminent of a strong IPA with the hop bitterness shining through. I would have liked a little more of malt presence to balance out the hops with some sweetness. The mouthfeel is decent, but a little rough so far. This beer is much better after laying down for a couple of years. I will probably give a review from an older vintage, seeing as they are much more balanced as the hop bitterness smooths out.

140,2671,orfeu,4.45,"2004 bottling.  Appearance: This pours a gorgeous brown-amber color with a thick and massive head that doesn't look like it's going anywhere anytime soon.  Aroma: hops with an assertive malty sweetness; toffee, rum raisin, fruity vanilla.  Taste: delivers on what the smell offers. Sweetish malts are extremely well balanced by a snappy bitter finish provided by the hop content.  Mouthfeel: really full and chewy; the bitter hoppy finish is somewhat oily. Pleasantly so. Wow, like nothing i've ever had before.  Drinkability: This beer has a fantastic taste, mouthfeel, aroma, etc. It's a biggun, though. So although I'll have no problem finishing this one, not to mention looking forward to my next, I don't know that this would be an everyday beverage. Depends on what is meant by ""drinkability"" I s'pose.  Overall: this one broke my barleywine cherry. I'm liking it quite a lot so far.

Flavor is really huge chocolate and black malts with a huge hop bitterness in there as well. Very fruity, with notes of dried plums, currants, and licorice. I'm also getting citrus fruits like lemons and oranges. The aftertaste is fruity, spicy, and warm from alcohol.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, yet bitter and lip-smacking sweet.

140,2671,chorizoandeggs,4.06,"As the beer was poured, I became curious of this beer. There was a slight chill haze through the copper colored beer. At first i was disappointed by the head retention but my second beer had much more retention. I'm assuming that my first glass wasn't the cleanest.  As far as smell goes, uh....there wasn't much to mention. I could smell some hop fragrance but it really didn't stand out as exceptional to me. But my sniffer goes wacky after surfing so that may have played a part in it. .  Taste was where I was impressed. This beer was delicious. I was amazed at how flavorful it was and even more amazed at how my damn tongue went numb in 1 minute. The balance worked nicely with the amount of alcohol.  Mouthfull was really light for what I'm assuming was a very high initial gravity. It went down easy and definitely played a role in this beers drinkability, along with taste.  The only downfall is that I had way too many of these in a short amount of time. This is not something you can drink 5 of and mow the lawn.

I wouldnt be sure what to compare it to, as I've had so few barleywines.  Well, I suppose the most noticeable thing is the trademark Sierra Nevada hoppiness. This is definitely a hop-filled beer. And it is strong, and sweet. But not syrupy-so. A pleasant sweetness. I would say the mouthfeel is the highlight of this beer. It feels very full-bodied with tons of character.  The beer is an attractive deep amber hue. Very nice to look at. ""But how does it taste?"" you're asking. In addition to the strong hop character, there are the expected wheat & wine tones.

Finger high head of heavy yellow stained froth that sits for a pertinent duration. A thin collar keeps and the lacing is somewhat glaring and spotty with a small ink blob curtain sticking closer to the liquids' edge.  Aroma is nothin' but smoothed out pine soaked hop oily heat with a medley of tender roasted malts and grains that inlay a bordline scotch-like girth.  Taste is wonderfully smoothed over. The hops still play the main host as a load of pine oils and resin soaked leaves sit among a toasted molasses and roasted edge of malts. Heat is perfectly intertwined as the roasty stuff drys off the end leaving lots of oily hop residue, slight tobacco spice, and plenty of other spicy alcoholic nuances floating across the palate with weight as it finishes.  Feel is fairly rich, quite warm, both in the throat and belly, more so in the throat. Body is still fairly thick and heavy with a hop sided realm of oily heat and resins. Smooth but a bit rough edged; even still? Warmth is f*ckin' awesome to behold. Its perfect.  Drinkability is through the the roof on this aged wonderment. Even with its warmth its just lovely to sip and sip and sip and sip. This didn't last long in the snifter. A could see myself drinking a few more before bedtime no prob.

140,2671,mcclurmc,4.7,"Has a brown/amber color, slightly cloudy. The head is a very light tan. Unfortunately it didn't have as much of a head as I would have liked. It is a very appealing beer, though.  Very appealing smell. I can tell that this will be a fairly hoppy beer; I also smell some fruitiness and maybe a little alcohol.  The taste blew me a away. I was a little apprehensive about barelywines at first because I knew that they are one of the strongest beers, but this one is incredible. This is what I've been looking for in a beer that I haven't been able to find in an IPA. Great hop flavor, but not overpowering. This is perfectly complemented with a slight sweetness that makes the beer incredibly smooth do drink. Even as it warms up I can't yet taste the alcohol. As it warms the beer feels maltier and the alcohol begins to show its head, though just enough to give me a warm sensation.  Very lightly carbonated, this beer leaves an oily, sticky feeling in my mouth and on my lips, which I'm told is from the hops. Gives me a warm feeling as I drink it.  As I said before, this is a really smooth beer dispite it's strength. If it hadn't been for all the things I've read about barleywines telling me to sip it slowly, I think I would have finished this beer in 15 minutes.  A delicious beer.

Retention lasts well into the third minute, and we have some sticky ass lacing here.  Smell- It's awesome how this beer has matured in the six months I've been keeping it. What began as a West Coast hop porno has become a malty, dense, superb balance of aromas. Sharp but elegant is the best way I can describe it.  Taste- Easy and soft at first, then the malts and kamikaze hops unleash their relentless bitterness. This beer literally attacks the sides and back of the tongue so that you will not ever forget its footprints. So well done though, it exhibits what a barleywine should showcase better than any other I've had the pleasure of drinking. Harsh, then mellow, and fading into the big hop monster we crave as a nightcap.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- This plays a huge part in the overall allure of this beer. You've had high alcohol brews that literally hurt the esophogus after the first two swallows. You know what it's like to say ""that's enough"" because the beer is kicking your ass faster than you might have expected.

The aroma is quite hoppy - floral and malty, with noticeable alcohol.  The flavor is puckeringly bitter, with lots of hops. There is a creamy feel, semi-sweet, with an alcoholic kick. The lingering finish is also quite bitter - spicy hops, black pepper, citrus.  The carbonation produces quite a few bubbles by the time I swallow, which almost get in the way.

Much less hoppy than when I tried it this winter/spring. Hops are still there, but not as citrusy and in your face. I liked it better before I think, but it's still good.  Taste/feel: Smooth and balanced. Hops toned down from the winter, but more balanced. Really nice taste. Alcohol is present, but it fits. Syrupy and slick, really coats the mouth. Amazing how much it's changed in just 6 months.  Just a great barleywine. Grab a sixer or two and spread them out over a couple months.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,TongoRad,4.62,"Vintage 2005- not too fresh, not too old? Let's pop the cap and check it out...  It pours a mostly clear rich yet vivid brownish copper color with a dense tannish two-finger head.  Aroma is big- huge hops (resiny, citrusy) dominate but they are backed up by lots of caramel malt. I also pick up a blackberry-and-cream quality, hints of cocoa and, of course, alcohol.  Flavor is powerful- tons of malt and caramel at first, but the cocoa, berries and some nuts come right on afterwards. There is a gigantic bitterness cutting right through it all and there is a lingering finish of orange peel and alcohol.  I'm loving this beer right now- some of its abrasiveness of youth is gone and that lets some more complex characteristics come through, yet there is still some fire there as well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,mentor,4.4,"Belgian tulip glass served at BJ's in Boulder in July 2005. Presented a murky dark brown with a ragged light brown head clinging to itself in some places and spilling down the glass in other places. Smells dark and citrusy. Almost grapefruit pith, but not quite...perhaps a hint of pineapple mixed in there? Sweet is less noticable than the hops and consists of caramel and some brown sugar/molasses. Taste starts sweet (momentarily), but then comes the hops, bolstered by an playful alcohol. Citrus hop bitter rises above the caramel and rock candy sweetness to become almost edgy. Low co-humulone is good, because it keeps this one from going over the edge. The finish is hop citrusy, complimented by the bitter and alcohol to leave my mouth dry. Hop flavor is mostly grapefruit pith, some tangerine and also a touch of sour (not quite plum-skin sour, and certainly not cherry sour). Thick bodied and mildy carbonated. I was concerned that, fresh, the hops would be a bit too much and the malt a bit unrefined. Instead, the malt played a nice supporint role to the dominant hop bitter and flavor to make a multi-dimensional beer with complimenting tastes.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,SCW,4.7,"Undoubtedly, and without question, AN AMERICAN CLASSIC. I have such a tremendous amount of respect for this brewery.  My sample poured a deep amber - almost copper color - with a small amount of lacing.  The aroma was a mixture of piney, citrusy, and almost grassy/herbal qualities from the hops; alcohol; and a massive malt backbone.  The taste? Fuggedaboutit. Outstanding. A massive beer that has found a perfect balance between a high amount of hops, the perfect body and mouthfeel, and a warming alcohol effect.  Overall, a very drinkable (dare I say sippable) beer, and I'm enjoying every sip of it. Bravo.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,phishgator,4.07,"Vintage 2004, 12/25/04  I've given this about a year to age. It is near maturity. The hops are so ever present. The sticky mouthfeel and the sweet malty back bone make this a full bodied sipping brew. The alcohol is warming after the first half a glass. The appearance is a deep ruby with highlights of copper. Nice foamy head in a snifter, that dissipates quickly. Not a brew to start the evening with unless that is all your going to drink.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,CAMRAhardliner,4.8,"Pours a bright amber, surprisingly red. The head is big and fluffy with incredible retention for a strong beer. The aroma is packed with hops, very perfumey, piney, fruity and bitter... very intense. The taste is surprisingly hoppy with an initial smack of high alpha bitterness which leads into wonderful herbal, citrus, eucalyptus flavors. The hops are very leafy and fresh tasting. Malt is always evident in the background and it becomes more prevelant as the beer warms. A really bready flavor emerges with time.  The finish is decidedly hoppy with a mouthpuckering bitterness that lingers and lingers. Alcohol is nice and warming but very well hidden. The mouthfeel is quite light with perfectly textured carbonation from good bottle conditioning. I love bottle conditioned beers. I love this brewery. I love this beer. I love beer.  Id say this is the my favorite barleywine so far. Thanks to Cafe Volo for carrying it (and a lot of other great beers).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Smell: Citrus and hops. Taste: Hops. Smooth. A little alcohol. A perfect bitterness: strong, but nothing overly so, although probably more than a lot of people would be used to. Drinkability: Spectacular. As the beer got warmer I the taste improved with it.

On the other hand who cares, as I have a few other senses to engage. The aroma is full of delightful things like molasses, pine cones, even some dried hay in there, plus alcohol on top. Mouthfeel is full but incredibly smooth. I am picking up some serious, almost chewy (al dente?) malt, with some prickly piney hops. Good stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

I just took a sip and got glued to the glass by all the pine! Loads of sticky sap for a barleywine. Hops heaven. Tons of caramel flavors, with a hint of espresso in the background. The sweetness isnt here like other barleywines but still has that touch of citrus. I just took another sip, WOW this beer stays in your mouth. The flavor keeps flowing. I dont want this to end.

Taste is wonderful as well---very strong bitter pine hops balanced with a medicinally sweet fruity background. Very intense flavors on both ends of the spectrum. Medium bodied with a very smooth creamy feel, the alcohol is somewhat noticable as a warming in the back of the throat. It's been years since I first tried this---wasn't a craft drinker then, and hated it.

The taste is hoppy bitterness right from the start. Sweet fruits, alcohol, and some pine like hops. Sweet dry hoppy finish. Full bodied almost syrupy. A kick to the taste buds I must say.

140,2671,LarryV,4.6,"This is a review of Bigfoot 2004, now about 1.5 yrs old. Pours with a fluffy tan head that dissipates fairly quickly. Nose is hoppy, somewhat subdued. Mouthfeel is creamy with an almost sherry like texture. Extensive lacing is left behind by this deep copper, opaque nectar. The alchohol is very present in the taste making no attempt to hide itself. The balance of hoppiness and maltiness is outstanding after aging. The hops grab your attention first, followed by the maltiness, then finally the bitterness of the hops asserts itself again. This is a huge beer that I cannot drink quickly. I like to savor each taste, it reminds me a lot of a fine sherry. In summary, excellent.  This is an update - Bigfoot 2018. Still a stellar beer! For some reason, we always seem to be a year behind the distro, but I don't mind that since I think Bigfoot benefits from a year of aging. Still echoes my original review, incredibly tasty. Big and bold, plays with the best.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,baiser,4.22,"2005 version. First beer I bought from a small liquor store at 11 pm after just moving to California for a year from Toronto, and it didn't disappoint. Pours a deep, golden orange, with a dense white head, excellent retention. A blast of hops, grapefruit and twang in the nose. The taste was intoxicating. Tremendous bitterness, fruitiness, and some hints of caramel and malt character. But other than that, just intense hop flavours that attack your palate. Finishes dry and bitter. Packed with flavour.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,mjohn27603,3.75,2002 vintage. Aged for 3 years. pours reddish brown in color with a 3 finger high head. Taste is quite sweet but much more rounded with age. Higher bitterness is gone with aging. A little of a musty taste perhaps from the condition of cellaring. Still packs a big whallop. Aged beer is a bit flatter without much carbonation. Not very acidic. Kind of a cardboard taste I know this is a fault. Numbing alcohol on the tongue. A smoother more drinkable beer after having aged for 3 years. Any grapefruit flavor or hoppy bitterness is gone. 5-20-05  2002 Vintage. Revising review. Taste is much better perhaps I'm serving a little colder. All the edge is gone off this beer now. A slight hops bitterness resides in the undertones. Very thick in mouthfeel. Packs a whollop. Definitely a beer that improves with age. I'm changing the taste from 3.5 to 4.0 and also the mouthfeel. Definitely one for a cold night. The opposite of a lawnmower beer. 12-8-05,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,beersarang,4.22,"Pours a nice dark copper with pretty good clarity but the impressive part is the beefy head that leaves considerable lace down the glass. Loving it.  Smells like grapefruit, lemons, pine, caramel and toffee. Aroma is sweet and wonderful.  Enters the palate with a good solid chewy consistency. Smooth overall, citrucy oily hop bitterness is dominant over the sweet malt profile, but still finishes a touch dextrinous in the exhale. Hop character is well defined and prominent. Alcohol is quite noticable, especially as it warms.  Carbonation is kept low, drinkability suffers from the intense hop character coupled with the huge alcohol.  Overall Sierra makes a damn good beer, if I may say so myself.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,meathookjones,4.83,This is one I always look forward to each year. 2005 Bottle. Dark amber in color with a half inch of light tan head that leaves thick rings of lace all around the glass. Good staying power as the head sticks along for the ride. Big hop aroma with floral and pine notes galore. As it warms a bit some of the sweet malt and alcohol peak through that massive hoppiness. The flavor starts with a bit of sweet malt before the huge dose of hops comes through. Citric and earthy hops provide a good amount of bitterness though notably less than previous years. Some alcohol notes but very light. A little bit of sticky fruit sweetness. Bitter aftertaste finishes this. Excellent. Mouthfeel is full and creamy while giving your tongue a light hop raking. Very drinkable this year as well. Also an well priced beer for the style. This is definitely blurring the lines between Double IPA and Barley Wine. I like mine fresh but it is still great after several years. Either way its one awesome brew I will be getting plenty of each year.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,donnebaby,4.06,"Gust of cascades puffs out as the seal is broken. Pours a deep and dark red, opaque. A large, creamy and tight head rises and remains over the body, with lots of large islands of haze and lacing. Lots more head than I'm used to for a barleywine. Combo of aromas is somewhat muddled and mellow, fitting for a barleywine methought. Thick medium sweet malts and alcohol and alot of hops in the background.  Tangy with lots of vinegar on the intake, which continues through in the mouth mixed with alcohol. Notes of figs, apricots, and some wintergreen, with a layer of light, juicy orange juice. Mouthfeel is thick and bready, not chewy but with lots of body and texture. Bittering hops do the job well, stopping the taste in a wall of bodiful bitterness, relatively cleanly.  Great barleywine here, to remind me that I just might like barleywines.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Buildscharacter,3.81,"Appearance: It pours the color of dark caramel. Head doesn't stay long at all. While it's there it's off-white and full of tiny tiny evenly distributed bubbles...it's a beer head, what did you expect? It dissapates into a nice lace.  Smell: Hops. Strong hop aroma. Not much else there. Wasn't particularly impressed by the smell.  Taste: Comes on strong with the hops in the front. Bittering in the middle, leaving with a woody sweet character. Perfume comes to mind but in a good way.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, typical of a barley wine. Thicker than most not as thick as some. Carbonation is strong and really covers your tounge when you take the first sip.  Drinkability: Unless you are a fan of the strong hops flavors found in IPA's I wouldn't suggest this beer. The overwhealming flavor, unlike some other barleywine's is hops. Everything about it from the start to finish leaves you with a mouthfull of that hop flavor.

Also some sweet malty caramel. This is one smooth ass barleywine. And well balanced to boot. Lots of smooth, sweet malty character with caramel notes. Hops are more prevalant than I would have guessed for a barleywine, almost like a double IPA. The incredible balance between hops and malt cover up the alcohol for the most part. Very full mouthfeel drives this brew home. Finish is resinous with hop oils, slightly dry, and sweet at the same time.

It looks like something you would spray into your walls to insulate them.  Nose: Fresh green pine, great tart hops. Some vanilla and mild citrus.  Taste: Perfect sweet malt, some tight green hops. A bit of yeast and powdery chemical at the very end. Some apple taste at the end...?  Notes: A great example of what this style can be.

140,2671,paulyrimz,4.77,"Wow, I simply love this beer! I usually don't like reviewing beers, because other reviewers have touched on things I'd say, it state it in a more clear manner. But this beer is the exception. I am not usually a fan of barleywines. I have in the past found them too malty. But for me, this barleywine is the perfect balance and in my opinion should be the pinnacle of this style. I had this nice number on tap at Lucky Baldwin's for their barleywine festival. I liked it so much that night, and bought a six-pack of it a few days later. The bottle was just as good as the beer I had on tap, which was amazing!  Appearance: Pours a dark red, with a nice head that dissapates rather quickly. Not much carbonation.  Smell: Smells of wonderful citrusy hops. Hints of pine. Delicious scent.  Taste: I can't explain it, brilliant hop flavor blended with a hint of the usual barleywine malt. Usually in barleywines, I only taste the malts which can sometimes be overbearing. Hints of caramel and cherries.  Mouthfeel: Though not very carbonated, silky, full-bodied appearance, makes it a joy to sample.  Drinkability: It's as if you can taste the high alcohol volume in most barleywines, but this one is totally compensated with hops. I could drink this all night...but only if I'm not driving (9.6% ABV). Incredibly smooth",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,rhoadsrage,4.2,2011 Update S- The dark pine hops take on a tropical fruit quality as the beer opens up. Followed by some green mango hops in the finish.  T- The big pungent bitten hops have a strong bitterness that really lingers.  2005  ( Served in a medium brandy snifter)  A- reddish brown somewhat opaque body with tiny bubble gently rising to the surface. The head is a thin white ring around the edge of the glass.  S-The aroma is malty sweet with a hint of citrus hops.  T- Nice big maltyness with hints of caramel and sweet malts. There is also a nice strong hop bitterness and a floral/citrus hop flavor aswell. It finishes with a nice alcohol warmth.  M-Nice full body but not syrupy. Nice alcohol warmth but not hot.  D- This has a nice depth of hops but the malt is right there standing out. It is well balanced and I think this would stand up to aging aswell. The alcohol is nice but not overpowering in this beer.

140,2671,gentlebubbles,3.45,"2005 edition  Light toasty brown with vigorous bubbles. No head, of course.  Distinct grapefruit aroma.  Mild toffee sweetness is beaten about the head and shouders by the grapefruit tang, which turns into an astringent rind in the finish.  What could be a nice syrupy body is quickly dispelled by coarse bubbles.  The overall effect is too raw.

Taste: Malty with bitter fruits abounding all over the place. Definitly a big fruity taste, but not a sweet fruity taste...kinda the exact opposite, which is fitting for a barley wine. Has an earthy hop kick. The alcohol is quite apparent in this one. Gives you that ""gasoline"" breath that you get from like drinking a St. Ides 40. Pretty sweet in my opinon.

The smell is pine and citrus hops, some sweet malts and ALCOHOL. Does have a dirty old sock funkyness that doesn't help anything. BUT, one sip crushes those impressions with a big blast of grapefruit and towering northwest hop bitterness followed by some sweet malt. Very rich and full in the mouth.

Bought a six pack after reading a bunch of helpful reviews.  Appearance is an orange brown, with tints of red and the mug smells of alcohol (almost too much for me.) I picked up a lot of hops right a way which surprised me, having never had a barleywine before. Definitely doesnt remind me of wine.  Tastes unbelievable, very bitter with hints of citrus, great blend of hops and malt. Again, I really enjoyed the hop flavor in this. Also strong caramel flavor, however very refreshing.

Just a hint of malt, gone as soon as it's noticed.  Hops in your face! Pine and grapefruit, just like the smell. I wonder why they don't call this an imperial IPA? The malt is so hard to nail down. The hops do a nice job of hiding the high ABV, until you finish the glass and realize what you drank. Super astringent.  Compared to the bottle this was substantially cloudier and darker. Aromas, flavors, and mouthfeel seemed toned down just a touch. It didn't seem to have the complete over the top hop vibe going I get from the bottle.

Citrusy hops have a strong presence in the aroma, light caramel malt smell is also noted. Taste starts off very hoppy in a west coast citrusy sort of way. The hops are soon joined by a slick malty taste which give way to more hops in the finish. Fruity ale flavors also run throughout the sip.

140,2671,GolgiIPAratus,3.79,"2005 Edition 12 oz Bottle  Sampled: 3.6.05  Poured like thinned caramel, producing a bubble pocked foam head that faded quickly in the wide snifter. Little to no lacing resulted while drinking.  The nose is rich. A satisfying composite of caramel malts, anise, rye and barley. Some hops jump up to mingle with the alcohol. This bottle's aroma is not as sweet as past years' offerings, but I've also enjoyed 2003 & 2004 later in the cycle of their vintage. I consider that to be a significant detail to point out when it comes to commenting on this year's brew. That goes equal in smell and in  the taste is (( BITTER )). Whoa. I don't know if when I see this beer referred to as green in other reviews (that are specifically sampled early after bottling) that this is what people are talking about, but I assume so, and I concur. Now, with that said, the beer is still delicious. I mean, heck, I LIKE bitter. I've laid down a few from this same six pack, so we'll see in 6mos/1yr/2yrs what may come when the hops mellow and time works its magic. Anywaythe bitterness is rounded off with some sweet malts in the middle of your sip, but the end is bitter again. I think some age will add the complexity I've been used to when drinking this beer so late after brewing. The mouth is well carbonated and coated with hop oil bitterness.  Drinking this beer is warming. Warm belly, warm face. Heaviness slowed me down and I drank two over the course of an hour & a half or so.  I wish I had reviewed bottles I've drunk in the past as they were much more ready than this bottle. However, I've made it a mission for myself to never just review something from memory alone, so this beer gets its honest shot from this year's batch in it's current state. That's how it goes...  I will definitely check back in 6 to give a half year review though!   === ===  *UPDATE*  10.25.05 - So, I cracked a bottle from this same 6 pack this past weekend (10.23.05) and man has it mellowed out on the bitterness. MUCH, much better and more to what I expected. I updated the taste rating to reflect this change. I'd have given this a 4.5 if it tasted like this the first time around, so I averaged the previous rating 3.5 and the 4.5, and gave it a 4 since i'm lead to believe aged beers shouldn't really be reviewd. I figure inside a year is enough leeway...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The foams subsides rather quickly, but stays with the pint almost to the end. Leaves a slight lace on the glass. Smell is solid, but not spectacular. Alcohol is very evident in the aroma.  Taste is very good. Bitter intense hop flavor is at forefront. The brew tingles the palate on all sides. You can feel the alcohol warming the body. Good choice for a cold rainy night like tonight.  Althought I wouldn't consider this a session brew, it is still quite drinkable considering the barley wine style. All in all a solid barley wine.

140,2671,kmpitz2,4.5,"We did a small vertical here a week or so ago. We sampled 03 04 05 versions side by side. Here's what I got:  03 - Brown color with a ring of head over top, kind of dirty looking. The nose was raisiney with a slifht chocolate sweetness as well. The flavor still had some of the hop present. I really enjoyed the maltyness and dark fruit tones that came out from the age of this one. The feel was moderate to thick with a light carbonation. Three years did this beer good. I really enjoyed it.  04 - Poured an ambered brown color with a finger of head that stayed nicely. The nose was crisp, with a nice dose of hop and a slight roasted character alongside some dark fruityness. The flavor was mellowed a bit, but there was a sweet citrusy and a slight piney hop and a deep dark caramel malt. The feel was thick and great. Very good brew. I liked the residual bitter left on my tongue a lot.  5 - Poured a copper color with a 2 finger head that fell to coat the beer. The nose was nice and piney, kind of like being in a pine forest. Very strong and woodsey. The flavor was sweet sweet hop. Very brilliant hops over a deep caramel malt. The feel was thick, slightly syrupy. Great.

Really one of the most wonderful hop smells I ever hope to come across.  Huge Hop flavor. I meant to capitalize the H in ""Hop."" Floral and grainy. Too strong at first to really analyze, but after a while you find the floral-ness upfront, followed by a roasted, slightly malty flavor, ending with more sour hops. Wonderful.  What's the most surprising is how easy this beer is to drink. No, It's not like you're able to slam it, but it goes down pretty goddamn smooth for a Barleywine. Really a fantastic example of the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,droomyster,4.28,"Cloudy deep amber, with slow carbonation working its way slowly up toward the the two finger frumpy tan head. Strong smell of cherries and apples, sweet carmel and citrus notes. Chewy taste of cherries, berries and dark fruits and honey. Orange peel hops come out in the end. A lot of alcohol on the finish, and lingering bitterness. Very heavy brew, filling as they come.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Litterbean,3.72,"Is $13.34 a lot for a six of this? Not that I mind, just seems a little pricey.  Anyways, it pours a really gorgeous deep red, with hints of golden brown around the edges. The head is off-white, fluffy, and leaves a thick trace down the side of my pint glass.  It smells absolutely wonderful. Sweet, malty aromas with a hint of herbal hops. It's hard to tell exactly what odors are present, but the overall smell is powerful and is almost overwhelming.  It's a good tasting beer, I'm not going to lie. It starts off sweet, then the hops kick in and it is rather bitter. So bitter in fact that it burnt my throat. The alcohol in this one is all over. You can't get around it, it is a strong beer. I noticed caramel flavors and oily hops. It left my tongue feeling numb after two.  The fact that this is so high in alcohol, so bitter, and such a pungent beer makes this less than totally drinkable. A good beer to sip on a brisk afternoon, but nothing I'd bring to a get together. It's pretty harsh, but it is rather delicious in small doses.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,mgdeth,4.25,"Appearance - 2005 batch, Deep amber color. Good off-white head, decent head rentention and beer lace. Light to medium carbonation.  Smell - Fruity esters are prominent. There is a pine and citrus aroma present. Malt aroma serves as a background. Hops aroma is subtle. Alcohol smell is also in there, and is easier to detect as the beer warms.  Taste - This one is a taste explosion. Really bitter, so hop heads should enjoy it. Malt/hop balance is pretty good for the American style. Alcoholic heat sits in the background.  Mouthfeel - Thick. The hop bitterness clings for a long time, adding to the overall big empression.  Drinkability - Well, this is a loaded question... It tastes great, but it is so heavy and filling. This might do well with some aging.  Comments - This beer makes me think of SIerra Nevda Pale Ale raised to a higher power. In years past, I was not a big fan of Bigfoot, but 2005 holds a lot of promise.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Chadbrew,4.33,"2005 Nice tan yellow head that reduces to a fuzzy film across the top that remains there throughout the entire drink. Oh yeah, I'm in such a hurry to taste it I almost forgot to take a look at the color - deep amber hue. I set it down on the counter and took a step back. I like the way this looks, it looks like a meal. Definitely some alcohol in the smell of this, some grapefruit..? maybe some undertones of banana. Great hoppy smell but not overwhelming to me at all. The taste is citric, again the grapefruit. Good bitter from the Chinook and Centennial hops. The alcohol sort of slams you at the end. I'm tasting this for a while after I'm done, nice! Mouthfeel is medium with a crisp feel and a dry finish. I found this remarkably easy to drink considering the 9.6 ABV. I'm looking forward to re-visiting this again after it cellars for a while, plus at like $9 a sixer the beer/buck ratio is pretty sweet.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,RushLimbmalt,4.77,"I braved the 2005 expedition. And a expedition it is... This barleywine is young, but I braved it anyway. It pours a cloudy amber color and has a nice tan head that leaves thick sticky lace on my glass. The aroma is a wall of hops... so much so that you can barely detect any of the malt and there is definitely a lot of malt in this beer. The taste is a immediate assault of hops on the tongue, backed up by a thick malty body. I can't wait to try it again after it ages a year or two... If I can wait that long. Lastly it is lacking in drinkability simply because it has a high enough ABV to smack you down if you get careless, but then it is so good it is best savored not swilled down like an American piss beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,deejaydan,3.41,"Edition 2005. Hazy appearance that clears as it warms a bit. Nice amber color, unreal head retention and lacing given the ABV. Aroma is all hops. I don't get any malt character showing through on this. Borderline Imperial IPA. Tastes follows aroma, all hops. Resiny citrusy hops. They have their place, just not at this level in a barleywine in my opinion. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, hard to get past the hop bite in this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,malty,4.55,"2008 vintage. Always best FRESH imho.  Pours a brilliantly clear russet color with a blossoming light beige loose 2 1/2"" head. Slow upward moving visible carbonation confirms this is a dense ale. The best head retention I've witnessed in any domestically brewed (non-Belgian style) beer that I can remember. SICK amounts of fluffy & globular lace regions all the way down my nonic pint glass.  Booming hop barrage in the nose quilted by a sturdy and sweet malt base. There's some burnt caramel and tropical fruits entwined somewhere in this bittersweet bouquet.  Ahhh...there we go. The hops are here with my full attention. Bitter, rindy, resiny, prickly, gritty, dry and GLORIOUS. A true homage to the wonderful hop. The malt foundation doesn't let this crazy S.O.B. get too far off track though. The track has been laid by the sweet and thorough malts and the crazy hop train is speeding ahead at full steam. All aboooaaarrrd!!!  Mouthfeel is very nice. Well carbonated and playful keeps this full bodied brute on its best behavior. Dry and bittersweet long flavorful finish.  Drinkability is great also. Warming and restorative for a Super Bowl Sunday Winter evening.  Overall a tame yet bustling beast that I look forward to encountering every New Year. This is the 25th anniversary of this perennial favorite, and it's a grand offering indeed. Long live Bigfoot!!! I absolutely adore this creature!!! ___ Poured from a 3 liter magnum - just kidding! From the usual stubby 12 oz. brown bottle '2005' edition.  Brilliant clear russet-crimson color with a wonderous fluffy light beige head that clings and stands tall.  Scent of citrus floral hops all up in your grill with a fresh malted butter cookie smell. Fruity & doughy all at once.  Powdered sugary sweey malt flavor supported by sturdy blossoming orchestra of glorious hops. So many flavors: dark fruit, grapefruit and cinnamon - can't nail them all, but spectacular. Warming alcohol, though it's well masked with the hearty ingredients.  Mouthfeel is splendidly smooth and slippery (oily). Full bodied and just the right amount of carbonation to keep it from clinging to the inside of your mouth. Juicy beginning & middle with a firm dry, long finish.  Drinkability is surprisingly high due to it almost 10% abv. Be careful!  This is a superb vintage with everything in the right place - beautifully balanced. I'd love to try this side-by-side with Great Lakes Brewing's 'Nosferatu' - but I think Bigfoot will reign for now.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Citadel82,4.28,"This was a pleasant surprise.  Pours a hazy burnished ruby-copper with a long lasting, creamy, tan head. Lots of very fine carbonation and thick sheats of clingy lace.  Aromas of vanilla, caramel with a powerful dose of floral hops. . This hopped up aroma was my first tip that this brew was not your average malt-heavy Barley-Wine.  There is definite strong malty background and caamel in the middle but for me this was more grapefruity cascade type hoppy brew. A long dry finish with no noticeable alcohol.  Medium bodied, actually rather light considering the gravity of this aptly named brew.  Very drinkable, not the heavy, syrupy brew that I was expecting. This is a great beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,dippy,4.68,"Wow...2005 is my first intro to Bigfoot and let me just say that the bigger the foot, the harder it kicks your ass.  I was impressed by the head first and foremost, a light tan/brown and standing about 2-3 fingers. The head stuck around for almost the whole duration of the brew leaving some beautiful lacing on the side of the glass.  My friend actually smelled this beer from around the corner as it is quite aromatic.  The brew itselfwas a bit floral at first,more hops than expected for a barley wine, but considering the aroma I knew it was coming. The carmelly sweet malt of this beverage made it go down so smooth.  This beer was awesome, I could've drank 20 of them if I didn't start to get drunk off just three of them. THe alcohol is well masked. Great beer. Everyone should try one or two or three of them.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ypsifly,4.87,"Poured from a 12oz bottle dated 2005.  DEEP amber with lots of bubbles and a 2"" off-white head that leaves a coating of fine bubbles down the glass.  Smells strongly of piney citrusy hops and lots of 'em. Really gets the saliva going in my mouth. No alcohol detected.  As expected, lots of hops upfront, then a taste of malt, then its back to the hops. This one was designed for hop heads. Long dry finish with some warming, but that's all the alcohol that registers.  The mouthfeel is thick and almost oily, but that's a good thing. A person who craves hops and loves a full profile in the body will have no problem drinking a few more until the abv gets on top of them.  I have enjoyed this barleywine for 11 years and always look forward to late winter when it becomes available. This year it took a while for the Sierra Nevada truck to make it to SE Michigan, and I was growing apprehensive. This afternoon I stopped at Bello Vino in Ann Arbor and found cases stacked as high as I am tall. I just about fell over and prceeded to drain my wallet. It would be nice to cellar some of this, and I have tried, but once its out of season that becomes very difficult.  2004 12oz sampled on 3/13/05  Same deep amber color with a smaller head, a bit less lacing but still a damn fine looking brew.  There's not as much hop in the nose as its now paired with a creamy malt. Still pretty strong overall, but more mellow and balanced than the younger bottles that are available now.  Upon tasting, the hops don't come on near as strong, neither does the malt. Its amazing what a year can do. So much smoother and balanced. No where near as dry in the finish.  I was lucky to find an '04 sixer that was kept in a cooler at a store I frequent. I've always wanted to let this stuff chill for a year to see how far it can mellow. The results so far have been impressive. Now if I can just hold on to the other five long enough to see what this brew can do over a couple more years...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,SupaCelt,4.08,Deep amber colours flourish from the pour. Modest numbers of carbonation bubbles dance to the surface without overcrowding the view. Bubbles noted up to the bitter end. Nice one finger head of a creamy white to pale tan colour. Holds briefly to be enjoyed before dissipating into a very nice contiguous lacing. Looks appealing indeed.  The smell is likewise very pleasing. Definite floral hop bouquet. Large malt presence. Citrusy hop notes pin ball through the olfactory foramina. Smiles abound. Maybe a hint of cherry sweetness there. I cannot detect alcohol.  The mouthfeel has a nice and oily slickness like these heavy percentage concoctions normally seem to possess. Somewhat syrupy. The taste throws off bitters from the jump. The oily finish layers the bitters over with just a touch of sweet. Pine like aftertaste dries out the final throws of flavor. Very nice. There is an almost apple skin like after-aftertaste remnant. Alcohol is only evident in the warm finish for about the first two thirds of a bottle. The bottom seems to taste a bit more strong on the alcohol. Not a problem for me. This baby is still smoove. A toasty ending to a delicious creation.  This is a very solid brew. I might have to agree with those that say this is more like a double IPA. It is a Sierra Nevada interpretation of barley wine at any rate. Damn good,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,mmmbeer,3.38,"2005 edition. 12 oz. with no need for a freshness date. Served slightly chilled in a snifter. Pours a dark dark red with a hint of brown and a light tan, 1 finger head. The beer is not quite cloudy but some sediment is floating around. The only scents are alcohol and hops, granted, the hops are significant (grassy, grapefruit, pine, a bit of tropical fruit, and I can almost smell the bitterness). Taste delivers more alcohol and an assload of hops. The predominant flavors are hop oils, pine, and grapefruit, but they are so strong I can only detect the malts in the mouthfeel. It is very thick and coats the mouth well with a bitterness that lingers forever. However, this bitterness is very intense (...coming from a hophead) and even though the IBUs (90) aren't as high as other beers I've had, the lack of enough malts to balance them make it seem like the most bitter beer I've had. I like my hoppy brews, but I was expecting more malts - this seems more like a dark double IPA than a barleywine. There's no way I could drink more than 2 in a night. Perhaps a few months in the cellar will help.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,CortexBomb,3.18,"2005 edition.  Pours out burnt ruby red with a white head which reduces to a ring in fairly short order. Smell is more like an IPA than a barley wine though, definitely some alcohol tinge, but a large floral presence is dominant.  Flavour starts out with a very aggressive wave of hops and an alcohol swath along with a strong pine aspect (again, hops) and some subdued malts, which mostly get lost in the manic hop-a-thon. The finish is a notable alcohol tinge and warming and a lingering after taste. Honestly, a weak barley wine. I imagine it would be better after being laid down because the hops would have a chance to soften, but the beer still seems to be lacking dimension, so even with balance I don't know how much of an improvement it would be. Reminds me of Rogue's Old Crusty, another extremely over-hopped barley wine.  Mouthfeel is solid at least, some definite clinginess, while drinkability is a shade above average.  Probably another beer that is well suited for hop heads, but best avoided by those of us seeking balance...seemingly a big problem with California brewers in general and Sierra Nevada in particular.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,zacharius,4.37,"This beer pours an amber brown with a decent head, quite a feat for a barleywine-no doubt due to hop oils.

Nice thick bodied mouthfeel. Drinkability is good for the style but definatley a sipper.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,karst,4.87,Poured 2005 vintage and watched as its viscus liquid fortold an awesome mouthfeel. A one finger head with 9.6%ABV - very respectable over a beautiful color.

140,2671,gimmehead,4.35,"Pours a rich, dark mahogony with a thin off white head. First smell is floral and citric hops, very earthy, and slightly alcoholic. Not as malty/ sweet as I had expected.

Will review at a later date.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,scriabin,3.82,"Barleywine is one of my favorite styles, yet it is so hard to find. I was excited about this one, even though it is not quite a true barleywine technically speaking. But close enough for me. It has a nice dark amber color with a thin foam that laces the inside of the glass. The taste has lots of flavors such as coffe, a little caramel, and a good dose of hops. It is a nice blend that isn't too heavy and is complex enough that it bears a few quaffs (don't plan on driving home though). Good stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Hibernator,4.5,"Sierra Nevada Bigfoot 2005  I let the beer sit for about 10 minutes after taking it out of the fridge. 12 oz short brown bottle and served in a brandy snifter.  Pours a copper color with some light brown highlights. A thin brown lacing covers the glass. Scattered sticky lacings.  Rubbing alcohol, prunes, pines and citrus in the nose. Major hop profile.  Super hop bitterness, juicy malts and fruity esters all engulfed in an alcohol sharpness. Fresh grapefruit juice citrus explosion and juicy caramel malts take over your palate.  This beer will only get better with some aging to mellow. If anything, I am having this beer mighty ripe, but I was very glad to see it at the store. The 9.6% ABV must be discussed when reviewing this beer. This is one beer that deserves some respect. It's one of the hoppier Barleywines that I have had.

All hops in the nose with a complex layer of hop flower, pine and grapefruit hitting you. The taste has more of a grassy character, followed by the pine. Malt comes through more in the form of caramel. This is followed by an immediate alcohol warming. Very nice rich mouth feel, slightly slick. The alcohol would keep it from being a session beer, but its surprisingly drinkable. Like many people Bigfoot was the 1st Barleywine I had the opportunity to try.

Taste is real nice...thick and quite hoppy for a Barleywine style, but it has the sweetness that I expect. Real refreshing w/ just a bit of bitter aftertaste. I thought I caught a wiff of alcohol at first, but I am definitely not tasting it. I am grateful for all of you who took to time to review this beer...it is the only reason I picked it up.

140,2671,swamiswamu,4.08,"Is this really a barleywine? Well, the hops are there. The problem lies in the balance. When I think barleywine I think Young's Old Nick or even Schlafly's was far closer. Judged as an DIPA this one would be near the top. In fact I'de give it the edge over Double Bastard and its like, but that's not the style it has chosen to be judged in. Have our BA palates been so altered as to forget that beer is more than hops alone? One can be sure that if you're looking for a hop fix one need not look further than this, but if one wants to find hops and malt in glorious balance and union, this ain't it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,whartontallboy,4.43,"2005 edition.  Looks really great; dark amber pour with a big soft pillowy head that gradually dissipates leaving insane amounts of foam. I'm getting excited! Smell is hoppy as all get out, but cut through with some grapefruit and pine scents as well. There is a detectable note of malt in the nose, but it's minimal. Very tasty as well! Lots of hop bitterness, but there's also a big caramel character in there as well to balance things out a little more than I expected. There's a peppery bite to go with some other spices as well. Alcohol is present, but doesn't dominate. Overall: I'd like to try this one again with some age on it, but it's pretty tasty as is. It's big and strong, but not quite as out-of-control and tough-to-drink as Insanity and a few others in the style. Yummy and extremely drinkable for a barleywine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Sticky head leaves tracks bigfoot would be envious of down the side of my glass.  Smell is hoppy with ripe fruit and a slight malt hint coming through at the end.  Taste is strong, but no alcohol can be found. Hops dominate but pair well with the rich dark fruit flavors and caramely malt profile. Very tasty but will get even better and more complex with aging.  Comparing this to the bigfoot i had on tap last August (which was horrendously astringent) and the 03 I had in October, I can honestly say the mellowed hop flavor is better.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The aroma is very hoppy with a slight caramel malt in the background - almost all hops. The flavor is very similar to the aroma. Lots of hops - citrus, pine - just tons of hops for a barley wine.

140,2671,MuddyFeet,2.93,"The guy at the beer store said that if I had an inkling for a barley wine I should try a Bigfoot. It had a 2005 date on the bottle cap. While my barley wine experiences have been brief, this was definitely different than all the other barley wines drank until now. It poured copper in color without any significant head, but there was a thin film on top of the beer. The aroma is purely of malts and hops. The flavor made me think of crab grass, ery sour with a spicy bite. But not sweet spices like other barley wines I have partaken of, but pepper and cumin. More spicey spices. A lot of really good cooking recipes (or so I think at least) come to mind as I drank this beer. The mouthfeel was fairly crisp but there was a very present alcohol burn. The sourness was a bit of a turnoff and I am not sure I will want another any time soon.

140,2671,jlervine,3.65,"2005 vintage reviewed 2/9/2005. Poured a lovely mahogany brown with a creamy off-white head. Lace forms on the surface, with colonies of the lovely foam at the edges of the glass. Sweet earthy malts are of caramel and honey. The hop aroma smacks you in the face like a pimp with strong grassy and citrus notes. The alcohol notes carry it up your nose and pound your brain. On the first sip, the tongue is scalded by hops, finished by alcohol, and then the hops rape and pillage what's left. Strong citrus/raw grass tones dominate. As the beer warms, and as your pallate slowly recovers, the malt complexity comes through in distant hints of caramel and a charred wood character. The mouthfeel is very drying, thanks to the freshness of the hops amplified by the alcohol. This brew is intriguing and begs to be sipped to completion. This is really a beer to be aged, and I find myself convinced to buy a case or four for such an experiment. Wow! I can hardly wait to taste how my 2003 vintage has progressed this year!  2003 vintage reviewed 1/14/2004. Poured an amber/chestnut color, slight bit of an off-white head tries to form, but sinks quickly back into Belgian lace. Smell is predominantly grassy and citrus hops with a tinge of alcohol, but it has a strong undertone of caramel and chocolate. Malt flavors explode across your mouth. Thick caramel, chocolate notes. Numbs the tip of the tongue before the hops blast you to oblivion. Grapefruity finish, leaves the mouth a bit dry and begging for the next sip.

140,2671,IceAce,4.5,"--- 2005 Release ---  Deep copper with a solid finger of foam that simply refused to go away. Lacing on this beer runs well over the 90% level. The nose is hoppy and strangely similar to that of an over-malted DIPA.  Always considered to be a 'stick to the ribs' brew, this pint packs a wallop with massive hops blazing the way. Taste is complex, with seemingly more layers than an onion. Huge malt goodness is complimented by a layer of licorice in the midtaste. The finish is punctuated with an absolutely sweet lip-licking homage to the brewers in Chico.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

A great belly warming experience, smooth malts and hoppiness makes me wonder if this is not a winter attempt at an IPA. Very smooth for the ABV% of 9.6, but does not seem to be a true Barleywine in taste. Maybe a few months will sort this one out, but overall....very enjoyable, with the alcohol well hidden.

Big heavy malts invade the nose gently giving way to crisp citrus hops with a resiny finish. Taste was still a tad bid hot with a smell malt presence in the start which is quickly cut with an intense hop bite, which morphes between piney/resiny to citrus fruit.

140,2671,Brewfan,4.67,"Haven't had this vintage in over a year. When I first had it, it was very new, too hoppy for my palate back then. But now that I've crossed over to the ""hop side"", I'd like to go back and taste my first ones again. Cellar temperature. Poured the Bigfoot into a barleywine glass and just watched the head reach for the rim. Nice THICK cream color head sitting on a slightly hazy mahogany beer. Loved the contrast. Head died out a bit, but even at the end of the beer, some was still there. Lace stayed around even after the beer was gone. Big, soft mouthfeel. Like drinking a velvet milkshake. Little carbonation. Loved the way it clung to my tongue long after the beer was down my throat. Nice hoppy nose with some floral and orange peel. Caramel and pine also make guest appearances. Definate alcohol presence. Hops have mellowed out in the past 2 year on this one, but they are still the dominating palate. This has rounded out nicely though, letting the malt come out and play. A little dry, still at the end, but not too bad. This one will be with me for a while. I don't want this one to end. Sitting here looking at the last 3 ounces and waiting until the 2005's hit my area. Cannot wait to see what the other 2003's will be like in years to come. Top notch finish.

140,2671,IrishMike,4.45,"man, i've been waiting for this to hit Jersey for quite some time now. The last shipment from SN to our liquor store didn't carry it due to the shipment being sent out prior to the release date, and it took until today to get my hands on it. Well, so long as it finally arrived i'm a happy man. Purchased from my place of employment for $8.99 a six pack, making it a downright steal in the barley wine market.  appearance- Pours a dark copper with a nice one finger sized head that establishes and maintains itself well. Solid lacing on the sides of the snifter and stays throughout the entire experience. Initial pour brings forth a few bubbles of carbonation that dissappear once the beer has been given a moment to settle.  Smell- HOPS! Piney, citrusy, and every other adjective you'd associate with Celebration Ale that ever-so-slowly back away into a nut/caramel blend that are as rich as they are subtle. Alcohol bite comes up in the hop blast, then backs away with the rest of the hops as the malt character steps in. Caramel covered grapefruit, if you will.  Taste- Reversing what was noted in the nose, the malts come forth first and the hops do their business afterwards. Scratch that; in all reality, the hops and malts come together first, then the hops take over the palate once the nutty character has backed off. A hop beast, but not in the out-of-control style that Old Crusty is. More of that pine and citrus with almost an oaky tone to it come together attacking the palate; even my nose is flaring up drinking this baby. Definetly could clear up the sinuses if you down it quick enough. Warms you up, but at the same time doesn't tell any secrets about the alcohol sitting within.  mouthfeel- Oily, sits in your mouth much longer than you'd expect it to. And yet, at the same time doesn't try to out stay it's welcome in your mouth. Hell, this beer is always welcome.  drinkability- well, it tastes great, but there's always that overwhelming hop factor and high alcohol content to take into account. Still, i'd gladly make a session beer out of this, provided i drank them slowly enough.   I always like to compare this brew to Old Horizontal, of which it shares many similarities, and it comes down to a basic question when evaluating which one is for you; do you like more hops or more malt? Bigfoot seems to have the hop market cornered here, while Old Horizontal (while no slouch on the hops itself) definitely takes the maltier, less intense path. As for me, i'm gonna be buying a twelve of both tomorrow; there is no winner or loser in my mind, just two extraordinary brews. The Pale Ale may get all the attention, but this and Celebration are, without a doubt, Sierra Nevada's pride and joy.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,GeoffFromSJ,4.36,"2003 edition, I believe. I got the opportunity to have a glass of this, and it was aged two-years. The aging didn't diminish much of its hop character. Still very hoppy and well preserved. Poured with a head which just wouldn't go away. Still sizeable after everything but the foam was consumed. Very drinkable for such a big beer. The hops dominated the malt character, which prevents this from being perfect in the taste category. But excellent none the less. I would even let this age a couple more years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,TinusTime,4.3,Pours a lovely amber colour with a minimal head. Smell is rich and malty with some nice spicy floral hops. Taste is great. So well balanced even though it is hoppy. Strong malt uptick with a blast of hops at the end that more than dry it out. Some people say the change in recipe has just made this a malted up hopped up SNCA. I dont see it. It still retains its barleywine character where as the Celebration is well a Celebration of scathing hops. Mouthfeel is good even though it isnt that strongly carbonated. Drinkability is dangerously good. The near 10% doesnt stand out and this is actually a quaffable barleywine..=-- Scary good,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,proc,4.2,"2005 Edition: Yet another nice beer from Sierra Nevada. This one pours out to a murky brownish in the glass with a medium-sized head. The aroma is that of citrus and pine and malt. The taste is reminiscent of the Pale Ale and Celebration, containing the signature SN hop profile, however, it does have some malt in here which helps to round it out and mellow it out just a bit on the swallow. The ABV is well hidden. This really didn' t seem like a barleywine to me. It seemed more in the vein of an IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,pentathlete,3.85,"2005 version  Poured a deep ruby brown. Quarter inch head, thinned but never disappeared, left foam on the glass.  Hops and pine assault the nose. This baby beer is going to be all hops.  And sure enough it is all hops. Completely unbalanced, but Bigfoot has a reputation and I'm not about to buck it. A sixer is going to cool in garage for a few months so these monsters can shed their youthful bitterness and mellow a bit.  Loved the mouthfeel. Full and nutty, hints of walnut or bitter almond. It is only diminished when the bitterness finds those taste buds in the back of the tongue; at that point all balance is lost.  If you like hops and bitterness, drink it now. But, for me, barley wine is about deep maltiness with a bitter mix. My expectation is that this needs some time, maybe three months, maybe six. At that point I'll revisit a bottle. I'm looking forward to it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,skybluewater,3.91,"2004 edition (brewed late 2003). Pours a deep cherry color. Thin head leaves a ring of lace at the top of the glass, but that's it. Smells of booze and dark fruits, especially raisin. Taste is nice, with a nice bit of raisiny malt, as well as some brighter fruitiness, as well as some hops (I've never tasted a fresh Bigfoot, so I have no idea how this has mellowed at all over the last year).  Overall, this is a nice barleywine. I'm really beginning to like the style, and this is among the better ones I've had (I've only had one ""bad"" one, and that one was just raw). Great way to warm up on a blustery winter night.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,blitz134,4.47,"A fresh 2005 editionmy first Bigfootthank you new Georgia beer laws.  Pours an attractive caramel color with a decent off-white head on top. The smell on this brew is amazing. Its loaded down with hops, fruit and pine totally dominate. There is a bit of malt sweetness in the background. Both compliment each other extremely well. Taste is again dominated by hops with a pretty dry tasting finish, very unbalanced, but for me this isnt a huge deal but I would like to see a little more balance. Hops are mostly pine and resin with sweet citrus in the background making this beer a little sweet. Many people compare this to Celebration, but the hop profile is definitely different. The flavor is much sweeter than its resin dominated counterpart. I dont pick up much else from this in the malt area. No alcohol flavor to speak of, but it does warm as it goes down. Mouthfeel is full and oily while drinkablity is a thing of beauty. These could get you in trouble.  For a hop lover this is a good beer, even if it doesn't follow the typical style profile of most barleywines. Very typical Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,CVC,4.6,"2005 expedition.  Came in a 12 oz. bottle; served in a pint glass.  Pours a brownish amber color with an off-white, one-finger head. Leaves little lace. Smells herbal, hoppy, and slightly piney. Tastes like it smells. Has such a full-bodied mouthfeel, and is mighty/dangerously drinkable.  Oh, Bigfoot--good stuffs, indeed. Still great even though Sierra Nevada changed the hops around. From what I remember from last year's batch, this year has almost more of a dark [Sierra Nevada] Celebration Ale taste mixed in. 2 parts Pale Ale, 1 part Celebration Ale. In a good way. Still an awesome brew this year around.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,mattcrill,4.37,"Presentation: bottle cap says ""Bigfoot Expedition 2005"". I'm already interested.  Appearance: Pours brick red with a ruby background and a nice cake-like appearing tan head.  Smell: I smell citrusy and pine-like hops. I've not experienced that in a barleywine before. Although, I've only had two and this is my first run in with Bigfoot (I knew he existed....)  Taste: Interesting...it tastes like a buffed up Celebration. Hop profile is pretty prominent with a grapefruit-like twist to them. A slightly bitter lemon zest finish to it. Light alcohol notes definitely coat the palate.  Mouthfeel: Medium to thick and creamy.  Drinkability: On the heavy side but not bad.  Notes: I must admit...this didn't meet my expectations. I expected sweeter, more malt presence, and more alcohol notes. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the hop presence of this beer. I was just lamenting the other day that I got the last sixer of SNCA but if I close my eyes, I can't tell much difference b/t Bigfoot and SNCA. I can see myself getting into a lot more barleywines if they are like this however I think this is the exception and not the norm....",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,GClarkage,4.73,"01/25/05- Purchased at Beverages and More in Sacramento, CA  2005 Edition  Presentation- 12 oz bottle with no bottling or expiration date. Poured into my Duvel glass.  Appearance- About an inch creamy white head, excellent lacing and a brown-amber colored elixer. It even had those small ufo circles that you sometimes (if you are lucky) find in your belgiun or higher abv beers.  Smell- Very sweet and frutiy. Lots of hops (pine, grapefruit and maybe some melon) and a decent amount of malts. A pleasure to smell.  Taste- I have never tasted this many hops in a beer with this high of an abv or actually in a barleywine. Bitter grapefruit hops in your face with a nice warming 9.6 abv feeling in my tummy. Sweet malts polish off this beer.  Mouthfeel- Medium carbonation, a bit higher than expected. Chewy and resiney.  Drinkability- ABV is the only thing holding me back from having more than three of these (yeah, I'm a lightweight). An excelent beer to have on a day just like this (cold and rainy). Looks like I will be getting a few more six packs of these. Another score for Sierra Nevada.  Version 2006....  Appearance exactly the same. Smells a touch hoppier and a bit less malt. As for the taste....needs some time in the cellar. Very light in the malt department with a huge hop bite and a very long lasting bitter hop aftertaste. Still a great beer, but needs some time to mellow, unlike the 2005, which was incredible a week after production.  Version 2007-  This version IMO will mask the 2005 in maybe a years or less time. Much more mellow out of the gate than the 2006 (which still needs plenty of time before it's great). Hops are fairly intense, but the malt plays much more of a role in the '07.  Version 2008-  Same appearance as always. The scent has changed to a more caramel malt dominant one than hops (even though they are still there). This vintage has a very bold caramel malt base that is actually equal to the hops! IMO this is very drinkable right now. I actually like balanced barleywines much better than the hop bombs that everyone is producing these days. Probably the most drinkable Bigfoot yet, at least right off the production line...gets some competition from 2005 though.  Version 2009-  The scent is the least in your face out of all the vintages. Hops seem a touch lighter and maybe just not as much flavor overall. Smoother than most years. Definitely not harsh. Drinkable right now.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,jed,4.52,"Bigfoot Barleywine 2004  Presentation: Comes in a brown, 12 oz bottle with Sierra Nevada logo and an amusing illustration of a prospector following bigfoot tracks. Snowprint cap with 2004 on it. No best by date. Poured into a goblet.  Appearance: Pours a warm, chestnut brown with some lighter brown areas throughout the beer. Nice color. Good size head, which fades quickly and leaves almost no lacing behind.  Smell: Bigfoot explodes with sweet, pine and citrus hop notes. A quick whiff of raw alcohol esthers, along with some smokiness, but then back to the main hop aroma. Excellent aroma.  Taste: Initial smoothness fades to carbonation and extreme citrus bitterness from the hops. Hints of tobacco, grainy hops. Very little malt, but some caramel-like sweetness. Some alcohol esthers in the back, but nothing major  a year of aging has definitely moderated the alcohol in this beer. Finish is dry, with astringest citrus bitterness from the hops.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, if slightly thin mouthfeel. Solid, but not amazing.  Drinkability: Surprisingly high. While a beer with such a high ABV and hop profile would normally be relegated to sipping, this beer has mellowed to the point where the flavor is extremely smooth and drinkable.  Bigfoot is a staple that I've enjoyed but never gotten around to reviewing, the beer that first got me into the barley wine style. After a year of aging, the drinkability of the 2004 is perfect, and the flavor is nicely developing. Believe in Bigfoot  stock up, drink a few, and let the rest hibernate in the cellar.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,BuckeyeNation,4.11,"2004 vintage. Hazy tawny that is a wonderful, multi-hued melange of orange, red, caramel and copper. The pale caramel cap is a thing of beauty as well. Creamystiff and tacky at once, its rugged surface is slowly deflating in sections and thick gobs of lace are beginning to stick to the glass. A real looker, this one.  The nose is hugely powerful and smells like generously spiced fruit brandy. Sweet caramel candy bass notes hold down the bottom end while barely disguised ethanol and floral-citric hops rampage on the top end. The slight rubbing alcohol scent keeps it from greatness.  Sweet, syrupy, bitter, chewy, malty, hoppy... Bigfoot BSA covers all the bases. Repeated mouthfuls fail to isolate a dominant presence on the palate; all of the various elements of the flavor profile are combined seamlessly. Unfortunately, that includes alcohol. I know that it's difficult to hide the alcohol in what is, essentially, a 20-proof beverage, but it seems to me that it could have been done with a bit more success.  I've been hearing for years about how hoppy Bigfoot is, especially when young, but it doesn't seem overly bitter or hoppy to me. Perhaps my 'mouthful of hop cones' expectations were misplaced or perhaps the gargantuan amount of malt and the high ABV do an effective job of smoothing out and blunting the hop flavor.  As noted in the description of the nose, melted caramel blends with brandy-macerated orchard fruit and citric hops to form a wonderfully viscous, mouthcoating, sweet sipper of a beer. The finish is seemingly infinitely long and features diminishing echoes of caramel-drizzled hops. Warming and satisfying.  Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale is good beer. It isn't as hoppy as I had hoped and it doesn't surpass Old Foghorn as far as I'm concerned, but its reputation is well deserved. I plan to pick up at least a sixer every year to see how each vintage changes from year to year and how each changes with cellaring.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,RenoZymurgist,4.22,2004 vintage. Poured a clear red that was very rich in color with a white head that lasted for an amazingly long time for a brew of this gravity.The aroma was very nice with a strong hop aroma that seemed a blend of pine and citrus. The taste was excellent as a strong hop presence was immediatly made which segued smoothly into a sweet carmelized malt flavor and finished with a lingering hop flavor and an alcoholic warmth. This ale seems like it recieved a full amount of aging and the yeast finished this beer very cleanly. The body complements the alcohol wonderfully as it is viscous and the light carbonation provides a touch of carbnic bite which offsets the sweetness of the malt and the differently assertive hops flavor. Very drinkable I try to save some of this every year but it rarely makes it through the summer.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

As good as this is, it seems to have a bigger hop profile than, say, my introduction to Bigfoot in 2000but, in the end, who the fuck cares?

Layered and condensed lacing with solid strength. A murky light garnet in color; noticeable sediment throughout.  Strong ripe fruity-esters with a big hop nose. A light caramel malt sweetness along with a faint chocolate aroma. The main aromatics are driven by cherry, plum, and apple hints.  Very complex in flavor! At first, the fruit: apple, grape, and cherry flavors are very evident along with a toffee, high malt sweetness. This is followed by a big hop bitterness with plenty of alcohol flavors. The aftertaste contains a touch of chocolate as well.  Full bodied; heavy and a bit grainy on the palate.  What a great barleywine! The 9.6% abv makes this one tough to drink as a session beer, but it is certainly a treat for the winter months.

Quite aromatic... hops up front but also a big presence of ripe fruits like apircots and pears. Bigfoot is certainly an appropriate name for this brew. Big all-around flavorful taste. A grapey sweetness hits the palate first, folowed by more fuity malts and finished with a piney hop bitterness. A lot of beers seem to put the hop taste out front, but I like that bitterness as sort of an afterthought in this beer. This beer is a perfect example of a well balanced beer. It's not too over the top in any particular feature, but it's extremely flavorful and has a wide variety of complex tastes to be sought out by the drinker. Exellecent smooth and full mouthfeel. Although a lot of people generally give these bigger beers a fairly low drinkability score I think this is a very drinkable beer, as long as you can handle the %10 ABV.

Not too bad, althougth a bit hard to drink a lot of. It tastes good, yet harsh on my tounge. I have to take drinkablity points away because I am only having a bit of this one.

This pours a beautiful deep mahogany amber red with a small half inch head. Looks great in my SN snifter glass. The smell has some lovely caramel malt notes with a huge hop presence. Some candied fruit tones come through...plums..raisins. The alcohol is there as well...very complex smell that keeps my nose going back for more.  The first sip is massive!! The rich caramel malts intertwine magically with the wonderfully piney, citrusy hops. The fruit tones come through on the palate as well. Sweet and bitter play a tug of war and it seems like it ends up a tie...everyone wins. If there is a nectar of life then this may very well be it. A very complex brew that is best sipped. I love the biterness on the back of the palate. I just can't believe I haven't tried this sooner!  Mouthfeel is excellent. Not too thin, not too syrupy....this goes down smooth...almost too smooth for 9.6%abv. Carbonation is just right. As for drinkability...I'd imagine I could have a few of these on a cold night...probably no more than two..but overall it's a damn tasty brew that does not dissapoint. SN has been one of my faves before ever trying Bigfoot...and now after trying it they've just gone up another notch in my book. I got a few more in the cellar...let's see what happens...  Thanks to Ninjaworm for the opportunity to sample this fine brew.  2005 Expedition - 3-29-05:  Hops are more upfront in the nose than the 2004...citric and piney with the same strong malty background. Nice creamy two finger head. First sip brings a rush of bitter hoppy goodness...definetly ""green""...but in a good way, especially for the hopheads. A nice caramel nut chewy malt background.

Poured into a big wine goblet (it's wine, right?!), the tan head quickly diminished into the beautiful hazy reddish-copper liquid below. I couldn't stop taking whiffs of this beer. It smelled divine. All of the following were detected by my mere novice nose: sweet caramel malts, sour and dark fruits like raisins and cherries, vanilla, toffee, brown sugar, honey, pepper and spices, bourbon and with a big enough sniff, straight up alcohol (how's that for a bouquet?). I dove right into it to find extremely complex tastes... it seemed that right off the bat, my taste buds experienced a candy-like sweetness that was almost immediately punched in the face by a powerhouse of spicy, bitter hops. It's a pretty amazing taste experience. The finish is so, so bitter but eventually I warmed right up to it (literally). Tastes included raisins, tangy and sour fruits, toffee and grapefruit (typical of Sierra Nevada). The mouthfeel is absolutely incredible... extremely smooth but thick and chewy with just enough carbonation to keep your taste buds from falling asleep. Drinkability... well, I'd definitely have another but not in the same session. This is an amazing beer that allegedly gets better with a little age.

The hazy copper red appearance with a steady carbonation that fed a generous head that left oodles of lacing while dissipating made this is one beautiful looking beer. The initial aroma was a wave on piney cascade hops that nearly singed my nostrils. Deeper sniffs revealed layers of caramel malt, vinous and spicy alcohol, and ripe tropical fruit. The taste was sweet plums, raisins, chestnuts, caramelized sugar, and grapefruit that softened up the palette up front for an unrelenting assault of hop bitterness and peppery alcohol zing that lingered long after each sip. Surprisingly, the finish on the beer was again quite sweet, with a toffee like aftertaste. The mouthfeel was thick and chewy and quite soothing despite the dance of flavors going on in the mouth. This is one marvelous brew that should improve tremendously with age.

Thick intitial malt taste with the hint of hops finishing with a mouthful of hop bitterness aftertaste and the malt peeking through the spaces between your tongue. Yum yum to the hop aftertaste. It's thick and wonderful. I'm not a huge fan of the barleywine style, but this one is pretty damn amazing. Mouthfeel is thick and coating. It goes down well, but excessive hop burn detracts from the drinkability. So what about the high ABV. Let this one be your nightcap before you pass out into the luxe of your bed...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,WetCoaster,4.92,"One year: Probably the best beer I've ever had at this point. Absolutely sublime flavor. Magnificent.  Six months: Well, it's about six months later--let's see what's happening. In celebration of Lance's sixth TdF victory, I thought I'd pop one out of the cellar.  Appearance: Wonderful golden cherry color with fine and surprisingly active carbonation. Short lived tan head with no lacing, but thick legs on the glasswall.  Smell: Incredible. It now has a unique honeyed sweetness, a rich, smooth, balanced blend of malt, cherry, citrus, caramel, brandy, with a much more muted spruce/pine hops scent lingering in the background. There is a slight alcohol sharpness as well.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Wow. Deeply malted, slightly buttery with cherry and whiskey notes. There's still a spicy hop bitterness, particularly at the finish, but the balance is now much better. There's a slight smokiness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is creamy and dense.  Drinkability: It's gone from undrinkable to so drinkable it's scary--it's delicious.  I am amazed that a beer could undergo such a metamorphosis in only six months. It's so much better than when it was fresh it's hard to believe it's the same beer. Should be absolutely fantastic in a year--I can hardly wait. --- (Original review: 3.65) Ah, the 2004 has arrived. Ive put the rest away, but lets try one freshy and see what happens.  Appearance: The beer is beautiful to look at; it pours an extremely deep, clear amber with ruby undertones. It has very little head, and whats there is gone quickly. It leaves thick lacing and legs on the glass throughout.  Scent: The scent is surprisingly subdued, some green apple yeast ethers, pronounced hops, but none of the booming malt, dark fruits and spice you might expect from a big barleywine.  Flavor/Mouthfeel: As has been mentioned before, the taste can be described in one word: RAW. Right off the bat, you get huge, spicy fresh hops, pine/spruce flavors, and thick, viscous hop oils; you can almost cut it with a knife. However, thats just about all there is. Theres a faint black cherry malt sweetness in the background, and the expected Irish whisky alcohol heat in the finish, but the balance is tilted WAY over to the hop camp.  Drinkability: As it stands now, the drinkability isnt great; its a bit too rough, unbalanced and heavy for me. One is more than enough.  This is a serious, well-made beer but, in its current state, anyway, its not a good barleywine. With its huge green hop flavor and almost non-existent malt/black fruit/spice flavor points, this is far more convincing as an Imperial IPA.  Its just way too fresh. If you pick some of this up, cellar it, forget about for six months or so and come back to it when the hops mellow out. It should kick ass.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,claytri,3.38,"Bigfoot (2004) pours a deep brassy gold with hints of purple. The aroma is of malt and alcohol. The look and smell hold the promise of a hardhitting beer. The taste is a little surprising. Being pretty bitter with a lot of malt in the background. It's feel is very oily and leaves a lot of caramel on your tounge. I don't find this to be a very drinkable beer. The only times I've found it to be satisfactory is when I wanted a large volume of alcohol or on the end of large volume of beer. As it warms the bitterness becomes overpowering. After trying Young's Old Nick, I purchased a six of this expecting a real treat. That was in January, I am drinking the fourth now in July. A move towards the balance you see in Young's Old Nick would be welcome.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Crotor,4.24,"This is one helluva beer.  And that's one helluvan understatement.  Just drank a bottle of the 2004 vintage, and I must say that it gave me chills... It's only a couple of months old right now, but the hop bitterness already seems much more subdued than it did in the 2003 Bigfoot. The hop aromas, however, are amazingly strong. The treacle-malt flavor is more noticable for me than in previously encounters with Bigfoot, and this pleases me; it adds a good deal of sophistication to what would otherwise be a simplistic hop-monster beer.  Drink this big, hairy, NW barleywine slowly, perhaps alternating sips with bites from a slice of extra-sharp cheddar cheese, and you may very well have a religious experience.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,bigbeerdrinka,4.31,"2004 Edition  Appearance: Pours a deep dark copper color with amber and ruby hues. A nick thick plush head about an inch high shows off this beers beauty. Perfect lace.  Smell: Strong notes of big malts and piney citrusy hop nose. As usual this beer smells rediculus, and has a final alcohol aromas which lets ya know that this is a big beer.  Taste: This beer initial shows off its big malt profile, with flavors of dark fruits, caramels, and toasted sweetness. The hops follow up right behind giving a piney and bitter flavor. Also this beer has some juiciness to it, making my pallate go nuts. So many flavors, so complex. This beer finishes with yet more hop bitterness and flavor with compliments its big size!  Mouthfeel: Smooth rich and creamy I don't know how much more I can expect from a barleywine.  Drinkability: This beer is almost as drinkable as a session beer. Smooth flavors hide the alcohol till the very end.  Overall: Another great job by Sierra Nevada. Thank god I have 10 of these in my cellar aging!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,OldFrothingSlosh,4.45,"[2004 edition tasted 2-15-04]  What better way to celebrate my birthday and the snow falling outside than with a fresh bottle of the Bigfoot?!  Appearance: This year's 'foot pours a rich-looking brandy color with a lovely-looking off-white head that died quickly away to a wispy, ever-changing swirl atop the beer. Very nice lacing of the glass.  Smell: Blasting notes of floral hops mixed with medicinal alcohol physically slap your nostrils into submission. Lagging along behind is a bit of malty sweetness that does nothing to tame tame the tempest raging in your nostrils.  Taste: Hmmm....things are somewhat amiss here. This is one brash and raw beer. Titanic dose of leafy hops entrench themselves onto your palate and only grudgingly move when the medicinal alcohol arrives on the scene. There is some token caramel sweetness that drifts across the palate after the fiery and bitter rawness dies away. Finishes with a long-lasting bitterness that is only magnified by the oily resin on the lips.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: A big beer, to be sure. Medium-high body with smooth carbonation. Despite the aggressive and raw hoppiness of this beer, it still shines as a creamy palate-coater. Drinkability takes a hit due to the harshness of this one.  Notes: It's everything I've some to expect from the Bigfoot. However, this is a beer that is certainly in need of some aging. It's extremely hoppy and, for lack of a better word, unbalanced. Despite the flavor profile, I am 100% certain that, given some time, this will mellow into an incredible symphony of flavors. I've had a 4-year old version and it was amazing. There's no reason to doubt that this one will age into a classic. I've got 11 bottles left and that should make for a great ride starting next winter.  Edit: Revisited this vintage (6-30-04) and it has certainly mellowed. The brash bite to the flavor has been attenuated by almost 5 months of conditioning. The result? Silky smooth on the palate and wonderfully balanced. A more pronounced cocoa-smoky flavor is evident. Hops have faded considerably, allowing more time for the array of malty sweetness to stand center-stage.

140,2671,euskera,4.35,"2004 Expedition...  Poured a dark orange-brown with a small bubbly head that had good staying power. Smell is distinctly hoppy with some alcohol overtones and a slight hint of caramel. Taste is superb, with the hops as the vanguard. The sweet malt hangs in the air, with a piney nutty feel that I just can't pin down tantalizing the taste buds before they are overwhelmed by the hop thunder. Mouthfeel is divine; my tastebuds are almost not worthy of the Yeti in this mysterious brown bottle.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Globetrotter,4.58,"Procured at Bottleworks in Seattle, my bottlecap states ""2004 Expedition."" The brown 12oz bottle sports a label depicting an encounter between some old bearded prospector type and the Bigfoot himself. No ingredient info on the label. I opened it on 6/26/04.  Pours a slightly murky orange hue under a voluminous (what? at that ABV?) 3 finger beige head with great body, and lots of lace as it slowly settle and drops down the glass. Sweet, syrupy malt nose typical of a barley wine. Very thick mouth, with high carbonation. Lots of flavors here, from caramel and barley to pine and floral hops. The blend is smooth, but the components are also easy to pick out, with the malt surfacing early, then yielding to a substantial dry bite. The aftertaste mirrors the experience, with an almost honey sweetness competing against coffee ground bitterness. This is a truly exceptional product.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,99bottles,3.73,"Appearance: Pours a nice red mahogany color with a tiny reddish tan head that soon just became lacing. Sticky rings lead down my empty pint glass.  Smell: Very much like grapefruit. Very tangy, from obvious hop prescence.  Taste: Youch! Very sharp and bitter hops attack from the get go. Really, very one dimensional. Some sweet carmel tries to get at tastebuds, but the astringent aftertaste of hops crushes it. Very piney, very bitter.  Mouthfeel: Good thickness and body. Doesn't really cloy. Whoo, its difficult to find anything in there except sticky hop oil.  Drinkability: No. At this point, this beer needs some time to mellow out. The hops are not kept in check, and they need to be for this to be decent. I'd give it at least 2 more years if you have that sort of patience (I obviously don't). Could be excellent, just not yet.  Update: I found this on tap and had to try it, even though I knew it wasn't my favorite. More mellow, less assertive hops and a nicer malt balance. Still doesn't hold a candle to my favorites, but it's much nicer on tap when it's fresh.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,PorterLambic,1.82,"Wow. This was quite an experience, sadly not a good one. Reddish brown with a coarse 1"" head, decent lacing. Smells of spice, alcohol, malt and fruit. Taste is spice, fruit, malt, alcohol. Starts a little rough, way too hoppy. Finishes with a extremely noticeable and harsh piney, almost turpentine, aftertaste that get horrendously rough, very bitter. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied, but not smooth.  Definitely a beer I will NEVER drink again, barely able to choke this one down, and it wasn't because of the alcohol. It did not improve as the temperature came up, quite the opposite. One was definitely enough.

140,2671,rkhaze,4.57,"2004 bottling. Pours a bright red/amber with a dense rocky tan head. No lace but coats the glass nicely. Hop smell hits from 18"" away. Fresh and citrusy. Closer inspection reveals some pepper and spice. Nicely offset by a sweet malt and caramel aroma. There were also hints of fruit, vanilla and alcohol. Great rich taste upfront. Sweet malt and caramel backbone countered by the clean, tangy and resinous hop flavor. Finishes with a bit of fruit, tea and an intense grapefruit bitterness that really takes over and coats the tongue. The malt certainly gets lost near the end. The alcohol didn't come through much in the taste. Medium to full bodied with a slightly oily mouthfeel and some creaminess. Good amount of carbonation. Huge flavorful beer.

Aroma is a rich malty sweetness that has a slight alcohol smell at the end. A nice mouthful that is not to heavy. Taste has a nice level of sweetness which is complimented by the bitterness that comes through on the finish. A slight fruitiness is detectable but is definetaly an undertoned taste, which considering the near 10% ABV helps mask higher alcohol content. The finish lasts for several minutes which includes the sweetness and bitterness.

140,2671,oracle,5,"2004 vintage 12oz bottle served in a 16 ounce shaker style glass.  Ths beer poured a deep dark amber color with 1.5 inches of thick tan head which gradually reduced to about a quarter inch which left lacing for the entire depth of the glass.  There is not much that is mild about this beer. It announces its presence strongly, right from the get-go with a smell that exudes hops with small malty undertone. The higher alcohol content is also evident right from the beginning as well.  The first few sips let you know right away that this is a beer to sipped, not gulped. The hops come through very strongly, as does a complex blend of citrus and carmelized malts  The mouthfeel is heavy without being too over powering. While the finish is strongly hoppy, it doesn't stick around too long afterwards.  For such a strongly flavored beer with this much alcohol, it is suprisingly easy to drink and can easily catch up with those who do not treat it with respect. Drinking an entire growler at one sitting is a mistake.  At $35/case, its not cheap, but it is one of the absolute best beers around.  Highly recommended",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,woemad,4.03,"Bottle purchased at Huckleberry's in Spokane for $1.69. 2004 vintage.  Poured a cloudy reddish amber color with a small light-tan head that immediately dropped, but left a foamy ring for the rest of the beer's duration in my glass. Not much lace at all.  Smell is primaarily of hops, but there's a maltiness in the background. This smells like an IPA.  While the taste is again dominated by citrusy hops, the maltiness is much more noticeable. I'm going to have to get more of this and age it to see if there is more of a balance with time. This seems like it's just on the cusp of having a great balance, it's just not quite there yet. It still tastes great, better than a similarly-young bottle of Old Crustacean (I know, I expect it to be better with age), it just hints at being capable of being better. If it does age well, it will be fantastic.  Mouthfeel of this is perfect. It's medium bodied, to the point that it goes down easier than 9.6%abv has any right to!  This is a very drinkable barleywine if you are a fan of IPAs. Someone less enamoured of hops might find it a tad bit bitter, but what would they be doing drinking a barleywine, anyhow? This is the best barleywine I've had in a while, and I can't wait to see how it is when the flavors have melded a bit (I'm going to buy a sixer of this at the next opportunity).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Aroma is a nice mix of rich matl with fruity undertones, and surrounded by hops. Pours with a large firm head that becomes rocky. Dark amber in color (reds to brown). Some setiment. Looks good. Initial taste notes the cloyness of the malt. This is intense and flavorful. Hops first present in the dryness at the finish and with bitterness. Fruitiness from the malt finishes with a sourness and a dryness. Alcohol hidden well. Feel has a rich softness despite the cloyness. I like that. Very good ale smoothness.

Poured a dark, fiery, amber with a white head that laced well down the glass. Very hoppy aroma with some fruity hints. Also the alcohol is present in the smell. Very hoppy taste but the fruity hints make it less bitter than one would expect. Goes down smooth. 9.6% is a decent abv. Very drinkable in my opinion for a beer of this caliber.

The smell is hops and sweet malt. Integrated very well for me.  Taste is heavenly! Hops and malt in an incredibly well balanced integration. This is a WOW beer in my book. Nice to have one of these every once in a while to let me know I can still be wowed by a beer. I love the way the bitter hops and sweet malts come crashing down in alternating waves. Complexity!  Mouthfeel is thick and the carbonation surges out of the beer when it hits my tongue. Almost syrupy in texture.

Sweetness emerges, more malt and pine spiciness comes out to level the playing field. Some light orange citrus in the aftertaste, no detectable alcohol tastes at all.

Taste is much more balanced. The hops are still there in a big way but you can also taste some of the subtleties of the brew. I recommend drinking this fairly warm. 55F.  This is a fine representative of the barleywine genre.  P.S. I will continue to age the rest of this. I think it is just beginning to shine.  I just tried the 2008 version.

There was also a nice fruit scent present. As the ale hit the tastebuds, I could taste raisins, figs, grapes, and apples as well as the chocolate and molasses tasting malts.

140,2671,Jason,4.45,"Presentation: 12 oz brown stubby with a vintage date of 2004 on the cap. A small amount of sediment stay still during the pouring. Served at cellar temperature.  Appearance: Thick pancake like head with a webby trail of lace all over the glass. Clear brownish garnet color is brilliant against the light.  Smell: Enthralling aroma of fresh hops hits the nose with a stiff punch of grapefruit and mild pine. Light fruity esters and a caramel like malt are in the back.  Taste: Pungent right from the beginning, not astringent just really bitter from the hops. Then lays in the malt base which is a stable foundation of caramel and toasted sweetness. Some fruity esters jump into the mix as well as a clean yeast in the back ground. Towards the end things dry out with a faint fusel alcohol tagging along for the ride.  Notes: Perhaps a bit green though still damn tasty, drink it now for a good whack to the taste buds or let it sit a year or so to mellow it out. Either way Bigfoot a sure thing.  Bottled 2003 batch.  Appearance: The head is perfection, the lace is thick and sticky with a web like trail down the glass. Deep and dark amber color with a tawny reddish hues.  Smell: Perfumy hop resin aroma with a sweetish oily floral back ground, pungent in light grapefruit and vague piney scents. Esters throw a whiff of alcohol in. Some caramel in the nose within the blanket of malt sweetness that cant seem to cover the hops.  Taste: The body is big, strong and unwavering. Well textured moderate carbonation. Flat out the hops show who is boss, bitterness is hard but with little astringency. Oily hops make for a slick and smooth mouth feel. As the hops roll over the taste buds the flavor becomes more rustic with a bit of earthy leafy hop flavor. Lots more to go around with the hops with citric and piney flavors. Maltiness may not be the dominant one though it still gives a good sweet push on the palate. Caramel and a toasted malt sweetness swirl around the hops and seem semi melded with each other. Alcohol is certainly not to be ignored either with a slow yet steady warmth, mild esters and a fruity character of ripe figs and prunes.  Notes: A bit more balanced than previous years with that same trademark hardcore hop character. This is the Big Mamma of hoppy barleywines and you have to love the stuff. This is a well aged beer if you have the willpower.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,JohnnyDuvel,4.55,"I've had this before, and I thought I had already reviewed it. Oh well, I'll do it now. Pours a dark brown, with a foamy head. Some sticky lacing and head retention. Aroma of grapefruit and malt leaps out of the bottle. Strong, bitter and ""green"" tasting (reminds me of home grown!). As strong tasting a beer (this side of WW2002) as you'll find, right up there with Old Crusty in that regard. A blast for the tastebuds. Also, a boot in the arse (alcohol doesn't dominate the taste, but it's in there!). I'll have to grab a few more to keep around for when the mood strikes me.

140,2671,BittRnessabounds,4.2,"2004 edition. Hey guess what? It's a Sierra Nevada brew, and there are lots of hops. But anyway, this is actually a pretty well balanced beer. I was expecting to be blown away by hoppiness, especially for a barleywine, but that was simply not the case. Sure there were strong hop characters to this barleywine, but it is also nicely malty. Bigfoot pours a nice dark slightly cloudy reddish brown with a very nice head with good lace. The smell is equal parts hop and malt with just a touch of alcohol to tickle the nose. As the ale hits your tongue the warming and molasses like malt flavors dominate and then there is a hint of the alcohol sweetness only to be followed up by the hop bitterness and citric flavors. Good full body and carbonation also enhance this beer. All in all a very good barleywine, especially for one so young. I look forward to aging another and giving another go of this in the future.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,jonnylieberman,4.75,"A beutiful beer to behold. Poured from a 12 oz TWIST OFF (who would of think...barleywine in a twist off!) bottle into a pint glass. Gorgeous, archetypal amber/copper color. Looks like a beer is supposed to look. Killer head filled with tiny bubbles.  The smell is excellent. Malt, alcohol and hops. A little citrus, a little honey, some sugar... almost maple-like. Hops give off a nectarine scent.  The taste is world class. Totally delicious with hops all over the tongue. Alcohol shows up only at the end. Raisins, prunes, figs, grapes, cocoa and a slight roasted flavor are all present.  Mouthfeel is even better. Big, smooth, luscious. Very fruity, plum and pear, even apple flavors abound. The hop kick at then end is sublime.  I could drink several of these. I have several in my beer cave waiting to be drank. The alcohol will probably get you in the end, but so what? A phenomenal beer.  Notes: 2004 edition. For a barleywine to taste this good this early is a testament to how excellent the brewery is. To me, this is nearly the perfect beer. Don't be scared off by the high alcohol content. More beers should be just like this. I love it!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Trentonator,4.24,"This beer leaves a wonderful lace and has a great head. The smell of this beer is nothing short of amazing. Taste is fantastic, color is a rusty, bubbly and quite dazzling array of sheer beer goodness (or perhaps godliness). Mouthfeel is understated at first, then sneaks up on you with a vengeance, leaving you with a slight bitterness and hoppy aftertaste. I drink this beer and think of Benjamin Franklin's statement that ""Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy"".",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,merlin48,4.1,"Pours a mildly hazy, copper color, with a one finger ivory head that leaves massive patches of lace down the glass. Caramel malt hits the nose first, but is immediately supplanted by a bigtime assault of westcoast hops. Pine and grapefruit notes are immense, and a vinous character is noted in the background. Mouthfeel is full of hops and dazzling carbonation. Taste has a vinous alcohol presence at first, then the citrusy hops kick into full gear. Spruce pine provides a bitter hops backbone most of the way, but plenty of citrus grapefruit, lemon, and orange make things interesting. Caramel malt retains a minor, background presence. Longlasting, bitter pine aftertaste. I'm still a novice to the barleywine style, and if I were tasting this blind, I would think I was sipping a nice imperial IPA. Certainly, Bigfoot was an enjoyable and very drinkable ale, regardless of its nomenclature.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Ieatlambfries,4.4,"2004 batch. Served in a brandy snifter. The appearance was good. Dark orange with a small head of dense small bubbles that left quick. It also left a nice curtain of lacing. Very clear for the style IMO. Not a bit of yeast floating around in there, very unlike some others, such as DFH's Olde school barley wine. The smell was excellent, piney, hoppy and solvent alcohol. All enhanced by the fact that I was drinking it from a snifter I suppose. The taste was excellent as well. Much more hoppy than I expected. Big oily bitter hops no less, right upfront. Balanced by the piney flavor and equally big sweet malt backbone. Very well balanced. More so than Victory's Old Horizontal. The finish was warming alcohol that seemed to evaporate out of your nostrils. The mouthfeel was nice too. Velvety smooth, although more carbonated than I expected, and a tad filling. The filling feeling is the only reason I didn't give it a 4.5 on drinkability. The taste is there, but as with all big beers, I would probably not session with this brew. All in all an excellent example of this style. In fact, my favorite.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Onceeven,4,"2003 batch. Had the will-power to keep this one a whole two months before I popped this one open. I know, pretty weak.  Poured a dark hazy sienna with smallish head, but thats my fault. Spotty lacing, but overall a nice looking beer. Wonderful aroma, overwhemling scents of pine, roasted malts, and oily hops. There's something else there too that I can't put my finger on, but it's pleasant. This on has a big chewy mouthfeel with the aroma still stealing the scene. Taste.. this is one big tasting brew. More pine and malt sweetness with a big hop follow up to match. A superbly balanced beer, with a nice warming alcohol finish. A must try!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,mschofield,4.32,"Dark red with a thin tan head, left thin webs of lace. Smells like a pine tree, pepper, dark fruit, malt, citrus. Tastes like a spicy pine tree, alcohol tingles the lips and adds a pepper note. Sweet malt, cherry, plums and caramel. The robust taste lingers in the mouth and the citrus (grapefruit) note grows with warming. Medium-full body, great drinkability for a barleywine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,GuinnessSmurf,4.44,"This was a very strange and wonderful treat for me. I got excited just to dig into this barleywine, but I was skeptical. I had to test Sierra Nevada with two bottles of this. Was it worth it?  A Big Foot entered my glass...the foot was a beautiful brownish, red color (with copper glow in the light). The head is short lived, but is not unusual (or breathtaking either). I guess you can't have both a big foot and a big head. BUT a big foot does not infact herald a stinky foot. This beer was super ""smell-icious"". This is probably the only beer I have given a 5 to, and its in the smell departement. Don't believe me? Pour one of these bad boys and get ready. Its a complicated affair - can be best described using non-smell terms such as: invigorating, exciting, inviting, flirty.  How could I resist? I took the foot into my mouth. As any foot that enters your mouth, it comes at you pretty aggressively. This is ok, nothing to hide in a barley wine. So at first the mouth enjoys a bitter flavor and an alcohol flavor. This is then balanced out in the finish with some of the sweetness that is advertized in the smell.  Good beer - nice for multiple beers, and a great introductory barleywine (style) beer for those just getting aquainted with beer tasting.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,kwalters,3.58,"2004 Vintage.  First off, let's get the trivial things out the way. The name and label of this beer are fantastic. There's nothing more fitting for a big seasonal brew from Sierra Nevada. Well done.  Bigfoot pours a deep brownish-amber color with a very sizable head by barleywine standards. It looked every bit the 4.5 that I gave it as I stared at the snifter. The smell was strong with a notable hop presence. I immediately began thinking Imperial Celebration.  The taste was indeed recognizable as the big brother of SN's Pale Ale and Celebration Ale, but it definately has it's own character too. There's a very slight hint of sweet maltiness with the first drop that hits the tongue. That's immediately washed away by hops, bitterness, and alcohol. As I allowed this brew to warm up over about a 45 minute period while I drank it, the taste became a bit more balanced. The finish had less bite and the alcohol tried to hide. But unfortunately, like a 250lbs kid trying to hide behind an oak sappling, it's never quite out of sight.  I've got a few of these put away for a special occasion. I'll be drinking those at about one year from bottling. Maybe things will mellow out by then.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,jtfest,3.37,"2004 vintage. The brew poured somewhat thin and a dark amber color with a small mustard-tan head. Appearance-wise, it looked more like an amber ale than a Barleywine. The aroma was a bit hoppy, with pepper-like hints. The mouthfeel was thin but coating, with a bit of a carbonated bite. The aftertaste was bitter with a tinge of alcohol. The flavor hard to grasp -- some woody hints, some hop indications, a bit of malt sweetness -- but overall the experience was more like an IPA than a Barleywine to me. That makes it pretty drinkable, but maybe it needs a lot more time before it impresses me like it seems to impress so many others.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ecoboy,3.68,"You want to know what I think? There is such a thing as too much. This is too much.  That said, I guess some beer had to be ""it."" Completely impressive in intensity, this is death metal, this is Grand Guignol, this is wasabi. But when is it applicable to enjoyment? Ruby notes in the amber color. Big bubble head which surrenders quickly. Dry start followed by wallop of hops and alcohol, with a big round syrupy mouthfeel. Sharpness of carbonation appropriate for amplification of every single element of the brew.  I sit in a cold Maine winter and know I have been vanquished by a beer. I don't think I ever asked for that.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,GIVEMEBACKMYSON,4.38,"Pouring the beer, i could see the carbonation go to the bottom of the glass and gradually make its way to the top to form the 1/2"" head that was thick and lingering. The color is sort of a murky brown-amber. You can see that it's got plenty of body by the way the carbonation moves through the fluid. The taste is spectacular, almost overwhelming. The hops are very prevalent, and there is an intense sweetness that goes right along with it. Different flavors reveal themselves...prune/raisin, orange peel, hops. You have to try to pick out the tastes, because after it's swallowed, it's hops all the way. Not that there is anything wrong with that. The alcohol flavor is not as prevalent as one might expect at 9.6%, but it is there and warming. There was more carbonation throughout the beer than anticipated. It actually nips at your tongue. The feel is neither oily nor dry. It just plain goes down well. I don't know what to say about the drinkability of a barleywine. I loved every sip. But i'm going to wait until tomorrow to have another. Next time I drink one of these I will try it a bit warmer to see how the flavor changes or intensifies. This one was enjoyed at around 42 degrees farenheit. I wouldn't advise driving after having one of these. I wouldn't advise standing up if you have three.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The taste was bold and beautiful, strong alchohol presence, perfectly carbonated, sweet and syrupy but the hops brightened things up nicely. I did not find this to be overly hoppy like some others noted ---- I felt the hops livened things up a lot and made it seem a tad lighter than other barley wines I've had.

140,2671,blitheringidiot,4.51,"I went in search of the elusive Bigfoot BWA tonite. [ FYI: This review also was done comparing 2004 12 oz. SN Big Foot to a 12 oz.Victory Old Ho. Please see both reviews to compare & contrast, like in high school, except this is about beerYeah!] A nearly perfect, -strike that- PERFECT pour started out this adventure. An enticing, murky orange, evenly textured, hazy, dark, ominous slightly cloudy pour tore loose thru the woods of my goblet, with a light head sauntering off to a clingy circular band, sliding clean down the sides. I even uped my rating to 5/5. This is golden! This is an appearance that doesn't get any better. Can I swig it yet?  Aroma was a roasted walnut with peppery scents but not really a strong aroma at first. As I chased this Yeti thru the woods, some piney esters and hops were invoked. She poured at a slightly cooled temp, but warmed up to introduce the mature alcohol esters and Isopropyl like effluvia. A port nose pronounced, underlined nicely with hops.  Bigfoot sips, yes...sips with dark caramel, Vermont maple syrup, sweet, thick, full in the ole kisser. Hersheys dark chocolate peeks out. Easy carbonation slides by. Flavor lasts while sinking back in the mouth to a pleasant rye toast. If left on the tongue to sit, it reminds me a twinge of Stone, Ruination IPA, but in a more vinous flavor, and less in attack mode. Other nuances? A dry walnut bite, with a lingering, lip-smackin coriander, finishing with a stand up strong and proud, bold aftertaste.  Last swigs: I set the trap, but she got away! Perfect, pleasant pour, hoppy Port nose and mature 'malt & hops' balanced flavor, to whisk this down while being less aggressive on me tongue than Victory Old Ho. IMHO, tantamount to any Brandy for an all night cozy sipper. There is no end to this sip-ability [did I just invent another word?] rating. Stay tuned for updates on capturing this 9.6% ABV monster at 6 & 12 months. Cmon September!!! Price? Usually you can snare a case in your beartrap wallet inYuengling-ville for $38 but this was a trade from car pool co-workers home brewin husband! Thanks Tim!

140,2671,BeerResearcher,4.35,"2004 It pours a lovely sun burnt orange amber with a smallish but fairly long-lasting beige head. Potent floral hop aromas burst out of the glass while pouring. A smell of spruce, malt and alcohol blend in. Caramel and candy sugar sweetness are easily noticed. Doughy bread, rum-soaked raisins and a light taste of herbs begin to emerge, though settled in the background. Sharp grapefruit, lemon zest and a bit of a metallic bite provide quite a bite. The piney esters of whole fresh hops and the big alcohol kick remain quite separate from the other tastes, which begin to mingle halfway through the glass. Bigfoot is an original Northwest American-style Barleywine. I hope that just because something else more extreme flavor-wise, or more potent in the ABV department comes along, doesn't relegate this wonderful brew to the back shelf.

140,2671,Gueuzedude,4.44,"2004 Vintage, Sampled March 2004 Pours a clear, amber-ruby color when held up to the light. A thick tan head rests atop this beer. Thick aromas of malt and hops waft from my glass as I pour. The hops dominate the aroma, Citrus, dark fruit, pine, alcohol, and a nectar like quality are all in the nose. Thick bodied, with a slightly syruppy consistency. The taste is sweet with American hops bursting forth all over the place. A strong malt character (caramel, biscuit) is here, but it is definitely subservient to the hops in this fresh example. The malt only serves as a vehicle to allow the hops to express themselves to the fullest.

140,2671,pio,3.72,"2003. hazy walnut and amber colored liquid with next to no activity. somehow it has been a differing head size for me, seems to depend on the temp. at best it's a two fingered head that stays and leaves pretty nice lace, at it's worst it's been snap, crapple, pop of a fizzy head. i dunno, it's usually been pretty nice, no biggy. the nose is heavy with malt and honey. what i've come to think of as the signature sn hops profile (though they do seem to vary this from style to style i usually find alot of similarity in them) comes shining through. some very nice spice notes help and the warming alcohol is tantalizing. a roasty malty start on the palate is nicely bitter and sweet with a honey note. hints of clove and perhaps nutmeg work through a twang of maple and honey. the good old sn hops dry the palate accutely and abides with an herbal lingering that has a tendency, too, towards the bitter and toasty. the effervescance seem a bit much for the style but probably helps the body from being too sticky, though it is a little just the same. heavily bodied. there is alot of competition for bigfoot doing so many nice things for this style, it's difficult not to move on if there are others available. thanks for reading my review.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,Beastdog75,3.7,"2004 ""Expedition""  Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot is their biggest and most intense brew out of their entire lineup. I'm a barleywine newbie, so the only thing I could really expect out of this was the massive hops (because of it being SN). I realize that this barleywine is in a totally different mold from English and other barleywines, as this is more of an ""ambassador"" of hoppy West Coast brews. When I cracked open my first bottle, this was just as intense and interesting as I thought it was going to be.  Bigfoot pours a lovely reddish amber color with a nice light gold head that retains pretty well and leaves some lacing. The smell was of pure hops. Strong pine and citrus/grapefruit aromas in the nose, very woody and aromatic. The mouthfeel was slick, smooth and coating. The first sip of this was like electro-shock therapy for the tastebuds. Those hops are REALLY strong. Notes of pine, citrus/grapefruit, mint/herbal qualities, and an earthy woodiness. There was a malt presence just barely detectable under the hops, adding some buttery/caramel notes to the beer. The first few sips brought some alcohol flavor to my tongue and up into my nose. The alcohol flavor mellowed out as I drank on. This is a sharp and bitter brew, but as it got warmer and as I neared the halfway point, it seemed to mellow out a bit. Aftertaste is long and dry, with the piney Cascade hop flavors lingering long after the brew is finished. A very nice warming sensation finishes out the beer.  I will definitely save a bottle or two of this and try one in 6 months and the other a year from now. They probably will progress quite nicely. This brew is mighty and complex, and must be sipped. Because of its very raw and pungent hoppiness, I couldn't forsee drinking too many of these. The alcohol became a non-factor as I drank on, but I'm sure Bigfoot would catch up to me if I had more than the said few. I can't say I really enjoyed this on a wide scale level as it took a lot of intestinal fortitude from me to finish the first bottle, but I do respect how well made this brew is and its special place in the beer world. I'm not a card-carrying member of the HopHead Society yet either, but hopefully that will change in time.. To summarize, if you were to take the strong, intense Cascade hoppiness of a Celebration Ale and put it into a rich brew, you'll have Bigfoot.  12/30/05 - I tried one of my aged bottles (2004 edition) and it did mellow out quite a bit. In both the aroma and flavor, the caramel-like malts were noticable. While still a very hoppy brew, it was (dare I say it) easier to drink. Some woody qualities that I really didn't notice before became noticable. I have another bottle of this that I think I will sample in another year to see if it progresses any more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,krberg,3.96,"2K4  Usually I rate appearances as average or good, but the anticipation is too much and it looks great. All dark copper with a cream head. God, barleywines just look amazing.  Bigfoot always smells the same to me: hoppy and sweet. I'm always happy when I inhale the nose of a BW and I'm greeted that way. There is a weird bitter smell in there. I'm not used to that. Now I'm intrigued.  Wow, that is mild. Bitter, but very mild in the malty sweetness (considering style) and very floral and fresh. This is the first time I have had SNBF fresh. Usually, I'll get them after 6 months or so and drink them the rest of the year. I love its fresh flavor. This is without a doubt the best fresh barleywine I have ever had.  Great flavor and a silky smooth texture. Feels just great rolling over my tongue. I find SNBF2K4 smooth to a fault - I could pound this and not even realize I was drinking a carbonated beverage.  Tasty, wickedly smooth and drinkable as hell. It gets a 3.5 because I know I could drink a few, but I'd have to stop so that I did not embarass myself by attempting any movement what so ever, including the consumption of another pint.

140,2671,BeefyMee,3.8,"Appearance: Wow, this is a great looking beer. The deep reddish brown color is unmatched, and the head is soft and creamy.  Smell: The floral/citrus hop aroma is just a little too much for me. It actually burns my nose when I inhale quickly, although this is kind of cool too. Too too hoppy and in a bad way. There is only a slight hint of malt somewhere in the background. Judging by the smell, I'd say this is one grossly unbalanced barley wine.  Taste: Alright alright, we might just have something here. The extreme hoppiness doesn't go away in the flavor, but it is accompanied by a big ass malt body. The malt becomes more and more noticeable as the beer warms, so don't drink it ice cold. As far as taste goes, this is a wonderfully balanced beer.  Mouthfeel: Another bright spot. It's smooth and substantial. The best mouthfeeling I've ever experienced in a barley wine.  Drinkability: As with most barley wines, this beer is so huge that the alcohol is almost unrecognizable even though it has about twice as much as a ""normal"" beer. This means it is very drinkable, but it doesn't mean that you won't start to feel the alcohol after a few.  Beef Notes: A top-notch barley wine here. The hop profile is still a little too floral for my tastes but this doesn't take much away from the beer as a whole. If anything, it adds to the astounding character of the brew.

140,2671,abents,4.33,"2004 Appearance: Pours a beautiful reddish brown with a slight white head. Moderate ammount on carbonation running up the beer. Head sticks to the glass like its hanging on for dear life.  Smell: Smells of citrusy grapefruit and a lot of hops.  Taste: Huge ammount of hops overpowering the taste buds. Yet there is a slight sweetness to it in addition to the bitterness. Evens out quite nice. No doubt about it this is a big beer slight alcohol taste remains, but covered nicely.  Mouthfeel: Coats your mouth like a cough syrup. Huge beer lingers on the tounge long after you take the last sip. It's delicious.

140,2671,MobBarley,4.45,"Mahogany red with a small, creamy tan head. Decent enough lacing, too. The smell is all pine and grapefruit and subtle chamomile. A fruity sweetness attempts to bring some balance but is banished with extreme prejudice by the ruthless hops. The taste? The oral assault, more appropriately. Bitter in a number of ways, first invogorating, then antiseptic, and finally numbing. Pine flavors and grapefruit flavors battle for dominance while a mild spiciness caresses the tongue. Mouthfeel is beyond ""chewy""... slick and oily, this brew crawls down your throat. Niiice. Drinkability is the only letdown, but the massive hops cover up the high ABV very well. Yum.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,jahred,3.33,"2004 bottle, but this is the first time I've tried this beer before (in any vintage). The cap top says ""2004 Bigfoot Expedition"" ... At 9.6% ABV, I think that any such dangerous expedition should stay away from this stuff.  Pours a beautifully deep brownish red color, with a nicely thick almost-white head. The smell is strong, but pleasant. Esters and pine and malt...  Immediately upon tasting, I'm thinking ""Wow"" and the first word that comes to mind for the taste, which lasts quite a long, long time in my mouth, is ""raw."" Deep piney hops and thick malts in a wild combination that I can't quite place. The aftertaste (much later on after the initial sip) is slightly chalky, and reminiscent of a stout. As it warms, much of the malt tastes seem to disappear, and I'm left with that wild hoppy taste. It's overpowering, and I feel like this is more like a crazy double/imperial IPA than any sort of barley wine. The alcohol, which is also quite prevelant in the taste, didn't quite help with how unbalanced this beer is.  The mouthfeel is nice - thick and oily, but I'm focused on the drinkability of this beer, which (probably much like Bigfoot himself) needs time to tame.  I will lay this down for at least a year and see what happens - hopefully some more of the malt characteristics will come through.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,granger10,4.37,"2004 edition Color is absolutely beautiful, akin to a mohagony red with highlights. However head is small in size and there seems to be no lacing. Aroma is straight up hops, signature cascade hops from Sierra Nevada. Alcohol is also present in the smell. Taste is too complex for me to describe. More flavors continually come. I can't describe them all. Big flavors. Citric hops upfront. Caramel malt is lean but present. More malt sweetness in the body. Some fussel alcohol hits me towards the finish. Grapefruits become very pronounced in the end. Aftertaste is quite bitter. This was an extroadinary beer. The mixture of flavors is excellent and alcohol fits perfectly. I'm proud to call this one American!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,UnionMade,3.99,"Sampled from a spankin' new 2004 bottle. The beer is a dusky copper, a fairly agressive pour generating a thick ivory froth. The head settles into a broken mist, surrounded by a thick collar which leaves scattered bits of lace on the snifter. Some yeast floaties hang in suspension, adding a bit of haziness. The aroma is quite pungent, an equal blend of syrupy malt and brawny hops. The malt conveys a caramel sweetness, with a bit of a biscuity chewiness. The hops are very citric, with a bit of coarse earthiness. Some apparent alcohol lends a slight solventy twang, mixing with boatloads of estery goodness. Hints of red apple, plum, fig and raisin soften things up with a mellow fruitiness. The flavor starts with a huge, chewy maltiness. Loads of toasty caramel and biscuity flavors assault the tastebuds. A bit of grain, with a vaguely mashy feel. The malt rolls forth, impervious to anything in it's way. Sweetish caramel picks up a strong fruitiness, with a pronounced raisin and apple flavor, hinting at some fig. A bit of nectarine into the finish, where the malt is challenged by an equally beefy hop profile. Oily and grapefruit rind-like in it's strength, the hops are more than up to the task of cutting the malty sweetness. Pungently citric, the hop flavor is just bitter enough to avoid being too much, but packs quite a bit of flavor that will keep through some aging. Some herbal flavor, adding a bit of earthiness, washed over with some alcohol astringency in the very end. The hop flavor carries into the aftertaste, providing a coarse, grapefruit skin bitterness. A slick, almost syrupy mouthfeel, barely supported by a mild, small bubbled carbonation. Big ass beer. I actually like this beer a little better when fresh. It's great for aging, but the grapefruity power to the hops seems to appeal to the closet hophead in me. The beer physically abuses your tastebuds all the way through, I can only do a bottle of this stuff at a time. It gets slightly milder with some age, but I really don't like too much big beer at once. It's really one of the truly great american barleywines, though. A benchmark for the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Billolick,4.32,"12 ounce bottle, 2002 vintage, pours a golden amber. Hoppy nose, rich, thick mouthfeel, Rum, brandy type flavor notes. Alcohol obviously present, warming. rich malt center, and a wollop of hops! Citrus, resin, pine notes. This one is a whole lot of beer. Malt, hops alcohol, strong flavors, yet it remains in balance. A favorite that deserves the high marks it typically gets.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,oelergud,4.74,"2004 Clear ruby brew with low carbonation though more than other barleywines I've seen. Tan head with amazing retention. Smell is VERY hoppy with some grass and floral qualities. Taste is very much like the smell only more intense and have a hay-like flavor to it. This is the first beer I've had that has a pronounced sweet aftertaste, it's hoppy and bitter up front and sweet afterwards, up is down, black is white, but it's pretty good. Cant really taste the high alcohol %. Good body and mouthfeel, not quite as full as other barleywines though, it does have some creaminess to it. This is a beer with too much presence to be a session beer as it demands attention with every sip. Not something I would drink with a meal cause the food would be completely overshadowed.  -Oelergud",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Rastacouere,3.69,"As soon as the bottle is opened, a huge christmas tree aroma burst into the room. Can you say cascade? It then pours clear copper with not much of a head, off-white. Aroma is probably the most potent cascade use I've ever encountered, it's as intense as any other barleywine's nose, big, deep with a ridiculously heavy grapefruit/pine/floral character. The taste is earthy, a coniferous forest in spring with a slight hint at alcohol, nice aftertaste which lasts forever, but is a bit astringent. Medium-bodied. While this is very bitter, it's also pretty sweet and a little sour from overhopping. I'd definitely like to try this aged a bit to complexify the flavors a bit, but young, this is one big hopheads beer, therefore not exactly my bag. Quite citric even for an american barleywine. Similar to Hog Heaven, but displays a better body and more balance",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,AllThingsNinja,3.95,"I had this on tap, but forgot to ask about the vintage. I assume that it was a 2004. The beer was a deep read with a whitish head that left a fair amount of lace in my pint glass. This is a heavily hopped barleywine. The taste and smell are both in your face. I tend to prefer slightly milder barlewyines, but completely understand that Sierra Nevada is going for something different. I really enjoyed the malt complexities that lurked just below the bitter surface. The Bigfoot is an interesting concept, brought to fruitful realization.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,BierReise,4.12,2004 Expedition. Poured a beautiful firey reddish brown color with a thick head. Huge floral cascade aroma with bready malt underneath. Mouthfeel is full and smooth with a tongue numbing bitter hop sting at the end. The flavor here is sweet and syrupy with a huge amount of bittering hops and notes of grapefruit and peaches. Plenty of malt to hold it all together and this is one angry and intense brew. There's no escaping the bitterness in this young brew. I can't wait to see how it ages.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,shirfan,3.99,"2004 version.  Pours a rich, deep clear copper with an unbelievably retentive, thick tan head. Sticky lace absolutely refused to disperse, leaving a 1/2 inch layer for the duration of the glass.  Aroma is mild; citric hops and alcohol.  Taste is deceiving. A hearty helping of citrus and piney hops mask the true epic nature of this beer. Balance is achieved, however; the hops aren't overwhelming, and give way to nice standard ale malts... but lots of them. Not overly sweet.  Only a mild hint of alcohol is tasted in the finish, along with a more leafy hop presence...slightly medicinal.  Sneaky for its size, ""bigfoot"" is an apt name.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Nytemare,3.98,"2004 vintage. Completely surprised to be able to find this in Oklahoma. Thank you Cellar Wine and Spirits for expanding. Your selection rox like slayer. With that said. Pours a nice dark reddish orange. Virtually no head, a little lacing, and very little carbonation. Smelled of hops and alcohol with some light malt underneath. Grapefruity and grassy at the same time. Upfront with the flavor was a massive hops assault, but following closely behind was a bready, sugary maltiness. A little grapiness around the edges, just a hint of whats to come. As it warms, alcohol definately takes over, but by the time this happened, I was nice and warm, and didn't let it bother me. Full bodied mouthfeel, oily, but not bad. clingy. Drinkable yes, in large quantities, no. I understand why Foghorn comes in smaller bottles, besides the obvious marketing ploy, 7-8 ounces is really all I need, after that, it just tasted like alcohol anyway. Also, I probably should let this age a while as well. I really think this will be very tasty with some aging. Hops was just a little too dominant right now. Another six months maybe? I have another one set out to drink fresh and the other four are in my ""cellar"" aging. I'm thinking that each one of those will be sampled six months from the previous sampling. Meaning I'll stretch this out over the next two years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,HardTarget,4.55,"2004 Vintage sampled 2/2004 Aroma: Sweet malt perfume. A heady alcoholic undercurrent wafts the thick brown sugary aroma to you. Some slightly peppery hops come in as well, but far distant second. Appearance: Clear dark amber/pale brown. Very little head and it died after leaving a modest lace at the top of my glass, but not toward the bottom. Flavor: The hops really come out in this young vintage. Cascade is most noticeable with a deep grapefruit bite, but the hops just serve to keep all this barley under control. The overall taste is balanced, but disjointed. It&#8217;s like a battle between hops and malt, which each side winning battles, but the war being a draw. Malt has a bit of toasted quality, but not smoky. I even get a slight hint of the yeast, or at least something that reminds me of the Celebration Ale. The hops seem the same as well. It&#8217;s like they brought the malt up over the amount of hops they use for the Celebration. The alcohol becomes noticeable as it warms. Mouthfeel: Heavy body with a decent chew. A touch of oil, but overall it goes down very smoothly. Overall Impression: Drinkability? At first I had some trouble enjoying it, it&#8217;s just TOO MUCH, but as my palate warmed (thank you 9.6% alcohol) I started to mellow and just enjoy the exuberance. Toward the end of the glass, I&#8217;m thinking I could do another, but the amount of water I&#8217;m going to need to avoid dehydration is probably going to make this the only one tonight. I&#8217;m looking forward to the next one though, so high marks. I also want to age it a bit so I enjoy the first few sips as much as I&#8217;m enjoying the last ones. It is very good stuff, but something to be enjoyed in small quantities. Recommended!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Beaver13,3.67,"The Bigfoot poured a hazy reddish-orange with a thin, light brown, creamy head that had good retention. The nose was alcohol and tart fruitiness with some hoppy notes.

Alcohol in there too. Sweet malt is definitely there, but this is mostly a hoppy aroma. Nice! Taste: Sharp raw hops, piney and a bit citrusy. Hops first, then the malt rolls in with a second wave of hops and some alcohol on the tail. Its hard to call this a balanced beer, but I want to. Sharp and raw, but not rough. Mouthfeel: Kinda coating in an oily, resiny way. Thick, but not too thick. Some alcohol burn apparent. Drinkability: For a beer this strong, it is quite drinkable. At this strength, it only gets more drinkable the closer I get to the bottom. One of my favorite barleywines.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,LuckySevens82,4.17,"2004 edition. Pours a nice red-amber color with a large, off-white head. Head gives way to a nice lace that sticks to the side of the glass. Smells very good: Hoppy, floral, and sweet. Not a whiff of alcohol that I can detect. Not exactly what I would consider a great example of a barley wine, very hoppy and sweet. The hops somewhat overpower an already outstanding brew. This is one that is very deceptive: the abv is 9.2% and yet definitely does not taste as such. You definitely cannot drink this one all night, but it tastes great and I look forward to keeping this one in the cellar to try and keep trying to see how it ages.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,RedDiamond,4.22,"Bigfoot breathes with a delightfully complex aroma that is sweet, malty, floral, and hints at vanilla and bubblegum. (Bubblegum aroma good.) Dark brandy-brown and semi-clouded, Bigfoot comes close to biting the middle palate, swerves towards the sweet, then finishes with an herbal balance of blended hops. The taste is plush and luxurious, yet does not specifically replicate the notes suggested in the aroma. (Bubblegum taste bad.) The flavor is a devilish mix of acidic tannins with hints of syrup and perhaps nutmeg. The brew leaves a slight sugary stickiness at the lip and possesses a vivid sweetness that will actually attract fruit flies. The net result is a mellow strong-ale with a smooth complexion.  Bigfoot possesses enough complexity to keep you guessing, and enough drinkability to keep you coming back for more. It is balance and regal. Even the alcohol at this early state has rounded contours.  In my notes I have written, a rose of leather, with thorns of silk. Strange brew indeed, but Ill have another.

It sports a beautiful clear copper color and a great irregular lace which I see each time I open one because it's half gone before I look at the glass. It's hoppy but balanced and that shows up during the session. Spending time with this beer releases all its flavors. I've been told it doesn't age well. It changes over the years....I now have a six year vertical if anyone wants to get together I'll bring mine. But it really doesn't make any difference. It is an American experience.

I waited for the head to settle, sticky ring lace settles on the glass and laces all brew long. Very nice. The aroma is a slight sweet malt with stong floral hop overtone while a vapor of alcohol hits the nose. The taste is close to the same while the alcohol is more concealed. A good but strong balance of the hop and malt. The hop coats the mouthfeel (perhaps hop oil) as it lingers on awhile. Drinkability is smooth but with a respectful bite. I've put some away to age and look forward to see how they mature.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Bierguy5,3.97,"On tap at Boston's. Time to have one as winter is almost ending, spring is approaching. Dark copper to ruby color with a foamy white head. This beer left some incredible lace in the glass. What a smell, hops, hops, and malt, malt. What a big beer this is! The taste, is a roasted, sweet malt, with a bitter, bitter amount of hops. Wow, this beer is intense. I rewally could not finish an enitre pint. Not because it wasn't good, but man this is a big beer. This is a beer to sip in front of the fire when you are snowed in.

140,2671,filabrazilia,4.6,A beautiful clear dark amber with a thin tan head. Great lacing adorns the glass in sheets.  There is a floral hop presence in the nose that is balanced with a gentle malt sweetness. This is a smell I expect from a good barleywine and the 2004 Bigfoot does not disappoint.  The flavor is wonderfully balanced and smooth. The hops and malts are prominent and complementary. There is a rich maple and carmel sweetness that is cut with a strong hoppiness. Nirvana in a glass as far as I'm concerned. The thing that is so wonderful about the taste is that it seems close to perfection in its balance. There is no hint of alcohol in the flavor.  This is a creamy smooth beer that has a bitter dry finish. It is full bodied without being chewy or syrupy.  Another great beer from SN and a nice addition to my basement.

The flavor is less disappointing, but still, it is lacking the nerve of its superiors. This has very traditional barleywine flavors, but it not as bold as normal. I hate to think of it as simply a strong-ale for the masses, but I can't hlp myself. That being said, its not a bad beer. It has been well brewed; alot of effort has been put here, but unfortunately, it has been put to making the beer well accepted. I just prefer a barleywine that doesn't accomodate to you, rather, one that makes you accomodate to it. ie....north coast or stone-double bastard ( if you want to call the latter a barleywine, which i dont like to.)

Prominent hops taste but not enough to call it a hop monster, slightly sweet and fruity too. This has lots of complex tastes in the background but it isn't yet really ready.

Very floral with some underlying bitterness.  Taste is big maltiness (of course) but quickly the hoppy bitterness muscles in there. Floral and fruity hops flavors. As it warms, there is more underlying caramel and alcohol flavors present, especially in the finish. Bitter hops finish and a sticky, malty and bitter floral aftertaste.

It didn't so much lace down the start of the glass as it did leave a white head film down it.  Smell: Deliciously hoppy, much more hop aroma than any other barleywine I've had. Malts are present in the background, and do sometimes peak through the hops.  Taste: Sweet and hoppy. The malts are prevalent in the palate, and are balanced well with the hoppiness. The bitterness provides the perfect foil to the malty sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Smooth...borderline syrupy, but not as much as other barleywines I've had.

Head recedes in to a beautifully swirled sheet of lace.  Smells quite hoppy with a bit of malty sweetness in the background.  Taste wise this is alittle subdued for a brleywine but I'm also keeping in mind that it's young. It doesn't overwhelm you with a ton of flavor like a lot of young barleywines will. Quite a bit of candy like sweetness up front with a heck of a hop twang in the back. Bits of wheat like flavor drift in and out.  Mouthfeel is quite syrupy and full. Carbonation is minimal.

140,2671,RedBaron,4.55,"This, the 2004 version, made for a great respite after a long hike in a snow-covered forest.  This outstanding, if young, brew poured nicely from the start, with just the right amount of carbonation (which lessened, but remained throughout). The color was a deep dark bronze. I believe this ale is filtered, which somewhat dismayed me, but not too much (I kinda like my barleywines a bit cloudy).  The initial smell was of a very hoppy and 'green' beer--it's still too young to fully enjoy, as the hops overwhelmed the nose. However, given another 6 months to a year, I'm sure it will mellow nicely.  The taste was a great blend of bittering hops and a biscuity malt, kinda like the buttery biscuit flavor you'd get from Popeye's. It was incredible, to say the least. However, I still think this beer needs to mellow out a bit. I'll probably drink one or two more bottles this season, but I've already socked three away for years to come.

Alcohol on the nose and palette, but still to style. And though it meets all the requirements, this does little to set itself apart. That said, I couldn't believe the cap said 2004. This was easy-drinking, lightly warming, and absolutely delicious (albeit standard).

The boquet is very floral and fruity, can really smell those hops in there.  Taste is... ahhh just like I remember it. Intense and hoppy, it is huge. Very complex. Alcohol is there but not overbearing by any means.  Mouthfeel is thick and rich, leaves a warming sensation as it goes down.  This is a very drinkable brew, even at 9.4%!

140,2671,beergeek279,4.67,"'04 vintage, served in the 12 oz bottle, into a snifter. The color was a very dark amber, with a wispy head. The smell was a citrusy hop blend. The taste was a very nice citrus hop bitterness over the creamy caramel malt, and the alcohol was quite warming and not harsh and overpowering. Mouthfeel was very thick. As for drinkability, despite the ABV, I could drink tons of these.  When I first had this one last summer, it sent chills down my spine & made me think just how lucky I am to have so many good beers in my time. A fantastic barleywine, and proof that the style doesn't have to be an ABV monster to impress...well-balanced and warming is quite enough. Quite good, and now that it's out for 2004, I'll be having more of this!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Ellbert,3.99,Fresh 2004  Appearance is a reddish brown with a slight haze that lingers on the top half of the beer. The head is a slightly cream color and lingers for a while until leaving a very heavy lace with large bubbles.  The smell has a huge malt characteristic to it with some hops noticable. Some say pine which I can detect a hint of. Alcohol is evident in the smell. Vey complex.  The taste is very sweet with a spike of hop flavors. These hops leave you dry and they linger forever. A very pleasant flavor but the lingering hops are a bit annoying. Alcohol is not very evident which is a little disapointing to me.  The mothfeel is very meaty with a perfect amount of carbonation to go along with it.  the drinkability is low for this because of the hop lingering aftertaste and the alcohol.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,stewart124,4.5,"A dark cooper color with a nice off-white head that leaves very pretty lacing along the sides of the glass. A nice looking barleywine. The smell is exaclty what you'd expect from a Sierra Nevada brew, spicey hops and a hint of pine. There is a nice blend of hops and malts that tickle the tastebuds and again I taste a little bit of pine. The alcohol is very well masked by the other flavors. A bittersweet flavor that is very drinkable. I think it is safe to say I fell in love with this beer. A must try for anyone who loves Sierra Nevada's products and I wish this was available more of the year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,farHillsBrewer,4.3,"[2001 vintage tasted January 2004] I was pleasantly surprised at the shelf-life for this powerhouse brew. The malt complexity was amazing with fruit, grain, sweet and sour and caramel. The mouthfeel was like pudding. It went down real easy and took me at least 20 minutes to finish. The maltines came throught in the aroma along with a bit of spicy cascade hops. The hop finish had faded from the fresh taste I remember from an earlier tasting. The swallow had it all, a lingering malt sweetness, great mouthfeel and a slow transition to the astringent hoppiness. It didn't taste strong for alchohol but after just one, I had a definite buzz.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,edchicma,4.32,"Whoa...kick me in the butt and have me enjoy it too! Cloudy dark brown appearance with a nice head and great lacing. Smell was dintinctly like grapefruit, with a slight yeasty bouquet. The smell invited me to drink. Taste was a blast of hops that slaps you in the face, says ""sip"" me you fool, then ends in a dry grapefruit, citrus finish that is damn nice in the winter...Mouthfeel is dry and the strong alcohol presence reminds you that it is a barleywine, so sip!

140,2671,HiroProtagonist,4.1,"Bigfoot Expedition 2003...Poured into a Duvel tulip, with a small head and lacing that left the impression of a snowy mountain panorama. The color of the beer was a hazy deep chestnut with an orange hue. The smell was composed of full and sweet maltiness, with some sharp hoppiness poking through. This beer had a large and tasty roasted malt profile, which is quicky smacked down by an excellent zippy bitterness without harshness...a polished effort! The delicious malt and bitter hoppiness lingers on beautifully. Mouthfeel was smooth and full, with a nice level of carbonation. The drinkablity was suprisingly good for a barleywine...big flavors but not overpowering. This has to be one of my favorite examples of the style.  2002 vintage, brought out of storage in Jan 2004...notable differences: more head, less sweetness, and perhaps some subtle fruit esters on the nose.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,johnrobe,4.15,"2003 edition: I have been woefully negligent by ignoring this classic in favor of newer brews that have been surrounded by hype. But Bigfoot is clearly cast and mold for the hop accented American Barleywine. SN's founder must've sold his soul, as that can be the only explanation for their continued expansion and maintenance of lofty quality standards.  Bigfoot pours a deep orange / chestnut with a beige head that maintains a cap. The aroma is dominated by piney / citric (orange peel) hops with a strong dark caramel backing. The hops still shine loud n clear in the taste but the sweet malt has emerged nicely after nearly a year of cellaring. Citrus and pine combine with toffee, bitter chocolate and roasted nuts in the flavor. Bitter finish lingers and the belly stays warm. :-)  This brew's bitterness can be overwhelming when young. It's best to cellar it for several months to a year and beyond...if you can keep your greedy hands off of 'em.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,counselor,4.42,"2003 - poured a deep maduro with a thin head. Smelled of the typical deep sharp SN hops and then a whiff of the alcohol. The tase was right on, slow sippin, thoughtful, world problem solvin' goodness. A moments worth of slightly sweet malt flavor almost like dry maple. Then came the full hop and alcohol assault, sharp, dry cognac like flavors. Big head filling flavors of spice, wood and tobacco. What a well balanced mouthful, really good carbonation balance that lasted the whole glass. A super beer that packs a wollop and is a really good barley wine example.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Jon,4.47,"2002 Vintage.  Dark copper with little visable carbonation and no head. Nose features forward, assertive hops and caramel malt that opens up around mid-glass. Alcohol presence is quite evident, as well. Piney, resinous hops with an almost sugary sweet caramel malt character sticks out more in this aged keg than they do in younger versions. Notes of figs and currants open up, as well. Even in this almost two year old version, the raw hop presence hardly fades, while the malt becomes more complementary and sweet. The alcoholic burn on the finish lingers, but not as much in more youthful versions. Mouthfeel is viscous and oily, yet round and appropriately carbonated for an aged draft offering. Full-bodied and assertive, Bigfoot at this point in its life is still one of the hoppiest barleywines around. Quite drinkable, nonetheless, and worthy of some additional aging. Great stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Stubbie1,3.48,"2003 Bottle,  The appearance is a brown/amber color with a ½ inch off white head. The head fades leaving a very decent lacing.  The aroma is sweet. Hints of raisins, plumbs figs , molasses, caramel, and alcohol are present. Ther is also a faint whisp of Hops present. As I sit and take in more aroma the sweetness of the fruit it is quickly over ran by the alcohol.  The taste is sweet. A dominant malt start followed by a small wave of the fruit notes. Nevertheless, as you enjoy it all youre slapped in the face with the 9.6% alcohol punch. There is a slight creamy smoothness to this beer and a smooth feeling is left behind on the tounge.  It is an enjoyable beer. One that you would put your feet up and unwind to watch some football on a cold winter day. For me, the punch from the alcohol is a bit too forward. It makes it somewhat hard to enjoy. Therefore, I could not sit and enjoy this beer all day. I will try the other 3 at the 9, 12 and 1 year 3 month mark just to see if there is a change.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,byrd,4.3,"2003 bottle and sampling - Im not a big fan of barley wines, but Bigfoot easily gets my vote for best of the bunch (that Ive tried so far). Nice tight half inch head that reduced so a sticky lace. Great aroma of lots of sweet caramel and fruity malt with a slight hint of alcohol. Only a small touch of spicy hops to the aroma. Color is deep copper-brown and slightly hazy. A large amount of carbonation can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass, yet theres only light carbonation on the tongue. The palate is similar to the nose with a good deal of caramel and fruity malt sweetness. The alcohol which is quite obvious is in no way awkward in its tendency to stand out. Instead, it melds with the other flavors only adding to the overall experience. Decent hop bitterness picks up toward the end to perfectly balance out the sweetness from the start. Theres a little roastiness to the finish and aftertaste which lingers for quite some time. Easily the best barley wine Ive had to date, and Ill certainly be looking for this one again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,waughbrew,3.92,"Join me as I revisit the beer that first kicked my ass....  2003: Hazy dark amber with a big glorious egg-nog head that lasts forever. Big aroma of resinous, citrusy hops sting your brain. The hopping starts to resemble spicing - cinnamon, a bit of nutmeg, and cocoa powder. Malt wafts up mostly as light caramels, but also with a little cookie dough. Taste does not try to hide the alcohol - in fact it showcases it. Brown sugar taste in more present than I expected from this brew. Hops prickly on the tongue. Although I would not mind the alcohol and bittering hops knocked down a notch, this is still a wonderful brew.  edit: at one year old, the 2004 diminishes in hop flavor and bitterness, as well as the alcohol flavor. It becomes much smoother, but the finish loses some of its character.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,stirgy,4.82,"2002 version.  This is one big and bold beer. Poured out a rich ruby amber color with a long lasting and very creamy head. Wonderful lemon citrus hop bouquet intertwined with a heavy malt sweetness. The flavor is extremely rich and full flavored, but not overly sweet. Perfectly balanced. Theres a pleasant bitter grapefruit-like hop tang with some fruitiness. In the forefront are raisins, oranges and plums. Also has some cider and cordial-like qualities. A well rounded and complex ale that will put meat on your bones. This has to be one of the best tasting strong beers that I have had in recent memory.

140,2671,cerevisiaephilus,4.5,"10/23/03, 2003 bottling  This beer is grande! The nose is awesome. Incredible amalgam of scents, both VERY malty and VERY hoppy with some alcohol in there. Really nice blend. The taste is good, but really really hoppy. Even for a really big hoppy beer, I think they could tone it down a touch, but this was a 2003, I've had one a couple years old, I think it was a 2000, and it was definately more mellow. But screw that! I love Bigfoot!  4.5 5 4.5 4 4  edit 3/3/05, 2005 bottling  If I have a beer that I've already reviewed, but that I gave a poor review of (quality of review not gave the beer a poor score), see above, and I'm in a position to review the beer again...I'm gonna do it.  Very nice looking beer. Deep orange, auburn color. Very appropriate carbonation. Not too much. I am consistently impressed with SN's ability to naturally carbonate their beers and yet maintain such clear beers. This is why I'm skeptical that their bottling strain is the same as their primary ferment strain. And other reasons...but I digress.  gonna have to take the nose rating down 0.5 points. It's nice and big and hoppy...but that's it. I'd like a little more.  Really wonderful flavor. Big big hops just barely held up by the malt backbone of this beer. Nice sweet malt flavor, it's there, but it is overwhelmed by the huge citric bitterness. I like it.  gonna up the mouthfeel in this tasting. It has a very nice mouthfeel. Maybe it's the year, but this year seems much thicker. Nice mouthfeel to have something for those hops to skate around on.  Gonna have to up the drinkability rating 0.5 points as well. Just a really drinkable barley wine. This summer my buddy bought a case and we made 1lb hamburgers and hand cut french fries and drank 8 or 9 bigfeet a piece. Holy crap...we were fucked up!  So overall score stays the same, but I tweaked the individual category scores.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The aroma was sweet and alcohol was noticeable. The taste definitely mellowed over the five years, as it was still quite malty, extremely smooth, and a bit of caramel tones were detected.  The hoppiness that is present in current releases is much mellower and tamed from aging, but still is noticeable. The smooth flavors lasts long into the aftertaste, and the alcohol is quite noticeable. Always save a bottle or two for the future.

The taste is bitter, way too much hops for my taste. Small notes of caramel, malt, prunes, cardboard, with an alcohol bite. Nice mouthfeel, a smooth, light creaminess.  The finish is hops, hops, and more hops. Mouth-puckeringly bitter hops. Did I mention hops? Oh, yeah, it's got some hops, too!  I have another bottle of this, and I'm going to put it away for a while. The general wisdom on the forum is that it'll mellow out after about a year, so I'll try it again later. As it stands right now, I'm too afraid of it now, this Bigfoot has big hoppy fangs, and a nasty disposition. We'll see if a stay in the klink improves its attitude...  10/10/03- Even after only 5 months, this beer has mellowed out a bit. That, plus I've been exploring some IPAs this summer, and have recalibrated my palate a bit. It had pretty much the same aroma, taste was about the same, except I noticed a cola flavor. Overall, the hops bitterness got toned down quite a bit in the taste and finish. The moral of the story is: this beer NEEDS to be cellared!

140,2671,RoyalT,4.8,"Appearance  Gorgeous, monster head that rose brilliantly, went down slow, and actually laced the glass which was impressive considering the high ABV. The body was a beautiful orange/brown color, thick and solid.  Smell  There are some big, floral hops to this one. These things filled the room. The deep, ripe, fruity scents are there as well. This ale has a tremendous bouquet.  Taste  This is monster flavor. It reminds me of The Guardian. Every type of hop flavor is represented here. This one will pucker your cheeks for sure. Then comes the classic barley wine sweetness. Theres also some smoke in there to boot. The only thing thats missing is a sensation of alcohol from this 9.6 ABV ale.  Mouthfeel  This is the fullest beer that I have tasted to date. Every sip fills the mouth and bloats the cheeks.  Drinkability  This is dinner tonight. You dont drink Bigfoot Barley wine, you eat it.  Update  I wrote the initial review with a 2003 sample. I enjoy this immensely every year but though Id offer an update with a fresh 2006 vintage.  The consistency is amazing from year to year. If you get it fresh the ale is so big and explosive it makes you literally shake your head and call a friend.

140,2671,dedalus,3.38,"sampled from a bottle, 2003 vintage.  this beer had a beautiful appearance in the glass. i bought some brandy snifters specifically for barley wines, and poured the bigfoot into one of them. dark red color with a hint of orange-gold when held up to the light. thick, dark-cream colored head that dissipated only slightly, and left a gorgeous lace down the glass.  the aromas were extremely hoppy; mostly piney and sappy, with only a little citrus poking through.  erm, the flavor. i admit with more than a little embarrassment that i drank this beer before i knew there was a difference between british and american barley wines, and before i knew that barley wines are best when aged. i therefore raised the glass expecting hugely complex layers of malt tastes; imagine my surprise when this beer sledgehammered my tongue with enough young hops to tranquilize a rabid rhinocerous! pure pine sap through the start, middle, and the long, long finish, with only a bit of citrus, as in the nose. i finished the bottle with more than a little effort, and then read up on barleywines. next afternoon the rest of the six pack was resting comfortably in my basement, where it will age for about two years.  the mouthfeel was relatively thick, but without reaching syrupy proportions.  i strongly suspect that i will enjoy this beer much more once it has seen two more winters. if you're into lots of hops, go ahead and have this one young. otherwise i recommend aging. but not for too long; from what i've read, anything more than two years of aging and this beer will lose too much of its hop character.  cheers!  s.d.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,putnam,4.08,"""2003"" on 8/8/03 Powerful, boiling syrup-look to the bubbles which emerge from the brown liquid to create a crusty, tan-colored head. It smells like cannabis... sticky, green, raw. Also there's a warm, blackish-brown brioche element that begins to outflank the herb. I take a drink. This is an exercise in grade-B maple syrup flavor and boot-polish bitterness. It is a bitterness that coils around the tongue and gradually flexes until it leaves the generous sweetness rasping in a hollow, dry panic. There is sugar here without a doubt...and a lot of it. It's just that it is only enough to ease the outrageously bitter hop medicine. No flaws. Too young to drink.

Topped by a big bubbly biege head which rocked above the rim. Good looking lace. Aroma features some earthy floral and herbal hops, some caramel, and a wisp of alcohol.

140,2671,WVbeergeek,4.29,"2003 Version:  Deep amber brown mahogany with a huge caramel colored tan head. I poured this one into a 20 oz. Gulden Draak glass, and I couldn't do anything but sit stare and smell it for like five minutes. The aroma was simply amazing, I could literally sit here all day and enjoy the aroma. It's full of deep invigorating piney hops wrapped in maple syrup that are acting like pheromones, making me fall in love with this beer. The taste is one huge assault of malts and hops. The hop resins send shots of bitterness across my palate and the wave of malty sweetness of figs, raisin, and syrup sweep through finishing the flavor. Mouthfeel is syrupy fullness one full bodied west coast hop monster presenting the oily resins in the mouthfeel very nice. The drinkability of a beer this high in alcohol is so dangerous, but this is one beer to be enjoyed slowly it's an experience. In fact it's one that I would like to have again, I will tango with this classic west coast barley wine anytime.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,far333,3.55,"2003 batch: Hazy, dark iced tea color with a big, beige, foamy head. The head laces the glass as I drink. Smell is malty, with some fruit flavors that I can't really define. Mouthfeel is creamy at first, but leaves the mouth a bit tingly in the finish. Flavor is fruity, strong malt, and a mellow hop bitter, but the alcohol makes its presence known. A good barleywine, but not as smooth or full of character as I expected.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,nomad,4.12,"2003 vintage, drank in 2003...  Its color was a deep amber but equally oranged, like a deeply stained antique piece with faded edges and seams. Had a very steady almond-colored head and left some stain on my barleywine mini-tumbler.  Nose was of rosy malt and exploding raspberry and grapefruit and salty hops. Had a wicked roasted tone to both the malt and the hops - hops I would describe as newly harvested hops fermented in funk (in a good way).  Tasted of big hops and alcohol - exploding flavors of hops, grapefruit, and a twisted bittered raspberry. Had a good toasted malt background, but moreover a strong as hell bitterness, a real kick in the pants that feels good and healthy with time. After a long course of sipping a woody tone emerged underneath the hops. Also, after warming up, occassionally the first flavor that hit me through a newly kicked up head of foam was a straight shot of fruity sugar - it was a perfect way to start the plunge into the vat of lupulins. So, of course an extremely drying finish, yet not that thinned or dried of a mouthfeel, as it still held a nascently wet slide to it.  This barleywine takes the same strands and ratios of hops found in their classic Pale Ale and balloons their presence, yet it is still unmistakeably fruity and barley hearty. In other words, it does a great job even though it is on a far extreme of the style (i.e. the hoppier end). For me, an aged bottle would undoubtedly score much higher in flavor. I'm so glad such a good barley is so available and so cheap.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,padjo1,3.15,"Being a fan of the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company, I was,perhaps, expecting something of the caliber of their Celebration Ale or Pale Ale. Their Barley Wine (style) Ale provides an inviting appearance with a robust brown color featuring ruddy highlights, as well as a complex aroma that includes scents of pepper and orange. An odd scent, which transcends as hoppiness in the flavor, is probably attributed to the high alcohol content that comes off in its scent and amalgamates into the bitterness of its taste. Therefore, the taste would probably be improved by a long and intense breathing session or storage alone, as many advocates have suggested. A chunky mouthfeel doesn't help, culminating in a less than spectacular review. A more competent review could be submitted within a year after giving this prestigious label an opportunity to age.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,dmarch,4.38,"Pours with a dark ruby color with hints of orange and a long lasting head. Spicy hop aroma. A lot of hops, especially for a barleywine. The taste is a little more balanced. There is some malt sweetness underneath all the bitterness of the hops. Finishes with a warm alchohol taste. A year or two of cellaring would maybe tame this beer a little more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,philipt,3.9,"Had on tap at the 10th Annual Southeastern Microbrewers Festival.  What a thorough and pleasant surprise to find this beer at this festival (shhhh...don't tell anyone that NC law limits beet to 6% abv).  Appears chestnut-deep garnet in color with a very creamy tan head. Quite a thick brew. Hops are the first to strike me in the aroma, also a roasted maltness appears too. Taste is thick, sweet and hoppy. There is a distinct malt flavor accompanied by a strong hops presence. Hops are the theme throughout this barleywine.

140,2671,ElGuapo,4.4,"2002 A deep reddish brown brew topped with a huge mass of off-white foam that hangs around for quite some time and leaves huge amounts of lace all over the glass. The aroma is loaded with hops, but there is also a large amount of sweet fruit in the nose. It also has a slight hint of alcohol which one would expect from the 9.6% content.  A very hoppy start to this truly marvelous brew. Alcohol lets its presence be known, but it is not at all overwhelming. A nice amount of coffee and roastiness comes in later. Cherries throw themselves in there as well. This is one incredibly complex beer. I have been sitting on a case of the 2002 for a while, and I will surely enjoy every last bottle. The carbonation is light which aids in a very smooth mouthfeel that warms as you take a few swallows. Despite the high alcohol and intense array of flavors, this is a very drinkable brew. I can't say I will be throwing back a case, but you could have a couple, which is very impressive for the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,BigHead,4.2,"Frankly my beer, I give a damn and this is an interesting brew, certainly worth a damn.  I was a little surprised on the sweetness to the aroma, but the hops do a dynamic floral dance up my nasal passages.  As I lift this pretty dark amber in for my first drink, the hops bite and spices provide a nice complexity to the flavor. The floral feel of the hops feel slightly acidic in the mouthfeel and aftertaste. The ABV calms the circuits in my head for a long summer's night sleep.  A good barleywine, yet again, Sierra Nevada proves itself.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,WanderingFool,4.53,"I've been looking for the 2003 Bigfoot all winter and finally came across a 6 pack today. The beer is a nice clear dark ruby color with tiny bubbles floating up from the center of the glass. The light tan frothy head fades after a few minutes but leaves a nice ring around the glass and a sheet on the beer. The lace is thick and clings to the sides of the glass all the way down.  A hoppy herbal aroma hovers over the beer. I could also detect pine, citrus and alcohol in the smell. The thick mouth feel is warm and inviting and coats the tongue completly. Each sip is full of hoppy flavors blended nicely with caramel malt, orange peel and an alcohol finish. A hoppy bitterness is all that is left behind after each sip.  I look forward to this beer every year and use it as a benchmark to judge other barleywines. However, I did find this years version to be less hoppy than what I remember. I'll have to pop open a 2002 Bigfoot that I've got stored away to compare.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Quaffer,3.98,"Vintage 2003  Appearance: This was a deep amber brew that almost glowed in the snifter. The tan head rose up dense and fluffy, lingering for a long time. A few patches remained thoughout the entire drink. There was a ton of lace left behind by this beer, sometimes forming solid sheets of sticky, dense foam on the side of the glass.  Smell: There were big malt aromas, combined with tart cherry, toffee, cream, and strong alcohol. From the bottle, there was a very distinct smokey smell.  Mouthfeel: A full-bodied brew, that was smooth and creamy in the front of the mouth. As it moved back along the tongue, a carbonation and alcohol tingle gave this beer some bite.  Taste: My first drink was all big malt flavor combined with a nice smokiness. The smoke subsided after a few drinks, though. It settled into a huge, full malt flavor, combined with coffee and a subtle fruitiness. A strong hops bitterness emerged in the middle to balance out the big grain bill. It lingered well into the finish and then some. A spicy alcohol component also played a big part in the flavor, as well as added a nice warming effect. Gotta love that!  A very nice barley wine that would be terrific with a few years of age on it. While I really enjoyed it and feel that it is balanced beautifully, a little celler time to let the flavors combine and intermingle (for lack of better terms) would do it good. Not too long, though. I wouldn't want this big boy to mellow out too much.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,GeoffRizzo,4.4,"Pours a beauty of an orange, bordering light red in color, the initial aroma of citrus and hops, prominent of grapefruit, this is a smelly beverage. A taste of hops up front, followed by citrus and hops, leads me to believe this could pass as a strong IPA here, the citrus does come in near the end, but the hops dominate, this bad boy is very delicious, very smooth and sweet and creamy, it lives up to its reputation.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Dantes,4.35,"Package: Stubby ""heritage"" bottle. No date guidelines. Cap denotes &#8220;2003 Expedition&#8221; and 2 men and a Sasquatch around a fire underneath. Label depicts a prospector examining footprints, while his mule shies away. 9.6% ABV.  Cost: $9.49 a 6-Pack at Bottle King  Presentation: Snifter at 50º  Appearance: Coppery, strong-tea color with some haze. Generated a medium-dense off-white head, resolving to almost nothing. Isolated strings of small bubbles stream from the bottom.  Smell: Provided a snootfull of hops at the get-go. In that signature Sierra style, they weren't harsh or off-putting as I find in some other brews. One can pick out some dark-fruity notes like raisins, green apple, and a citrusy element. Clearly reminiscent of Celebration Ale.  Taste: &#8220;Tangy&#8221; was the word that kept coming to mind as the beer made my mouth water. I don&#8217;t know how Sierra Nevada does this, but they practice perfect &#8220;hopsmanship,&#8221; pushing the limit just to the point before it becomes medicinal. There's a strong, pine-resin taste with a citrus edge (pummello?) that avoids the overt grapefruit flavor I find unpleasant. As I savored this; caramel, malt, roasted nuts, clove, allspice, currants, and dried plums emerged. Evoked the iodiney single malts from Laphroig and Caol Ila. At the denouement, the hops reasserted themselves in the long, dry finish. Whereas Old Horizontal starts sweet and dries out; this starts dry, ripens, and then tightens up again.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is a bit more assertive than some other barley wines, but matches well with the unctuous, palate-coating body.  Drinkability: A wonderfully drinkable barley wine that doesn&#8217;t flaunt its ABV. Obviously not a quaffer, this doesn&#8217;t shortchange you on refreshment or satisfaction.  As noted in my review of Celebration Ale, Sierra Nevada just knows how to do this kind of thing. Clearly, Bigfoot carries the hops banner in the barley wine wars, and does it proudly. Maybe not quite as complex as Old Horizontal, this promises that cellaring will be well-rewarded with more complexity, perhaps at the cost of some vibrancy. Less malty and sweet than some barley wines, this brew clearly demonstrates its Celebration Ale heritage.  Bottom Line: An &#8220;Imperial"" Celebration Ale.  NB: A pre-1983 to 1997 vertical tasting in The Malt Advocate determined that 3 years of aging was the ""pivot-point,"" where this seemed to reach its optimal condition.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

This beer poured from the 12 oz. bottle a dark rusty red/orange color some-what cloudy but decent light could penetrate. The head was thick and foamy and fairly large, it was a creamy beige/light tan color as well. It left a full but chunky lace behind that stretched the whole way to the bottom of the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were of flowers (dandelions), hops, pine trees, some malt, light bitey citrus fruit, holly berries and some alcohol. The smells, I noticed, seemed to change in strength as it warmed as well. The tastes were BIG and pronounced. They were of bitter hops, and more hops (seemed to be the leader in this brew), wild flowers (dandelions), earth tones, pine trees, some sweet malt was noticeable but not strongly and seemed to be in the middle of the tongue, some roasted malt, dark plums, and a warmth that came from the 9.6% alcohol. This beer left my mouth, after each sip, with a dry hop taste that seemed to remind me of a dried flower. This beer gets better as it gets warmer, the flavors become more pronounced. I wouldn&#8217;t leave it sitting out around the campfire too long of it will disappear. A big beer that sneaks up on you like the elusive bigfoot in the woods, better get a picture or it will disappear and leave you with that feeling that something great just happened. Of course that could be the alcohol too.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,marburg,3.9,"Drank the 2003 this afternoon. A fine barleywine. Poured a not-quite-ruby color which when viewed in the light yields a reddish glow shining through a dark amber shroud. Aromas were of rum cake, citrus, and scotch pine needles -- a pleasant mix that took me a few minutes to really comfortably place and categorize in my head. Taste was similar. Very light citrus notes up front that get put to rest quickly by an overwhelmingly large hop presence. And that's all that limits this brew as far as I'm concerned. Some of this big hopped ales seem to numb my palate and irritate my senses a bit, and after one or two, I have to call it quits.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,BitteBier,3.9,"Translucent copper color. Head is minimal but clings well. Hops bitterness is dominant in the smooth nose. You know the alcohol is there, but it's toned down in the smell save for a little warmth. Medium, almost creamy, body with hoppiness that lasts from start to finish. Relatively sweet at the start; quickly dries out and fades to a warm aftertaste. Not as complex and balances as Bell's offering, but certainly a good beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,AtLagerHeads,4.17,"Quite a nice beer. This is a very potent ale with a strong, but balanced hops sense. Not for the meek, this brew presents a host of sensual assaults. My sample poured a very murky dark amber color reminiscent of very well steeped ice tea. Despite an attempt to raise a head I got little more than an eigth inch that was quite attractive giving the appearance of frothy liquid gold. The head dissipated to a very lttle remnant that hung til the end. Great lacing from the residual.  The smell gives away the strong hops presence but little else at the open. Perhaps the hops mask the other ingredients. As it warms there is a strong sense given off of caramel and malt that voids the intial hop sense. The high ABV is very apparent and in the taste from the start. This hoppy brew starts and finishes on the bitters. It has a gamut of fruity hints that begin to impress as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is very full-bodied and smooth, almost too cloying. Very heady stuff and a good beer to end the day. I made the mistake of putting it with lunch; it should stand on its own since it is more than capable of doing so.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Mitchster,4.06,"2003 edition. Brewed with Two-row Pale & English Caramel malts. Hopped with Chinook for bittering, Cascade and Centennial for finishing, and dry hopped with Cascade, Cent, and Chinook. 9.6% ABV, OG=23.0p, FG=6.0p, 90 IBU's.  check out the cool video: http://www.sierranevada.com/beers/images/bigfootwindows.wmv  A very good, hoppy example of the style. Pours out to a clear dark-amber/light-ruby with a thick, whipped yellow head. Retention and lacing are truly exceptional. The lacing is sticky and tenacious, and the head remains at least 1/2"" thick throughout the entire glass. Carbonation is moderate. Aroma is pungent with sharp, floral Cascade hops, and lots of hop resins. Fruity esters are abundant with notes of plums, raisins, and dates. Mouthfeel is slick, cloying, and oily with a soft finish and a firm body. Taste starts with potently bitter Cascade hops and a firm pine-sap character, fading into a sweet malt body with figs, dates and prunes. Towards the middle there is a crescendo hop bitterness with notes of dense, dark wood and tobacco. The finish builds and builds and seems to linger forever...it's mainly intense earthy hop bitterness with tannic astringency, more tobacco, and leather. The finishing hops are rough like eating grapefruit pulp, and would certainly benefit from aging. The alcohol is expertly hidden. As it warms, a bready complexity becomes apparent, the alcohol becomes noticeable, and the aroma takes on the character of a sweaty make-out marathon. There are no off-flavors appreciated. A well-crafted brew...but it may be a little much for the non-hopheads. This is a beer that pairs up well with a fine cigar. Cheers! --- 25th anniversary 'expedition', 2008. 9.6% ABV.  Pours out to a clear dark chestnut, forming a large ruggedly whipped light tan head with superior retention and amazing lacing. Moderate to mild carbonation. The aroma opens with a boatload of fragrant green grapefruity hops. When swirled, just a hit of alcohol and vanilla. The mouthfeel is not as big and chewy as the ABV would have you guess, but it's still quite sturdy with a hefty body. The taste is predominated by copious amounts of hops. This is a very American barleywine, much more rich and potent than something like Old Foghorn, and more akin to Stone's Double Bastard. The bitterness is sturdy and astringent. The malts linger as a mild nutty sweetness before the finish. The aftertaste is all pine needles and grapefruit.  This is a hefty, very hoppy barleywine. It may not be for everybody (personally, I prefer mine less hoppy), but it is a quality brew as it stands.  2011 Edition 3/2/11-Pours out to a clear chestnut, forming a tall rocky and spongy yellow head with superior retention and lacing. Good looking as always. A thin layer of sediment in the bottle. This smells and tastes like I described in my prior reviews, so seems to be a stable recipe. Oily, dense rich body, medium-strong bitterness, with a sweet bready middle and a lingering aftertaste of hoppy bitterness akin to Arrogant bastard. Touches of isopropyl with a hint of acetone...a little rough.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,UncleJimbo,4.5,"12 oz bottle with ""2003 Bigfoot Expedition"" on the cap. (Under the cap: A drawing of Bigfoot sitting around a camp fire with two guys, all holding beers and smiling.)  I must begin by saying that this was a most excellent strong ale (barley wine style)! I thoroughly enjoyed it and am glad that I bought an entire six pack.  This ale poured a hazy, red amber color with nice tan foam that eventually settled to a thin surface coat, but still left lacing down the glass. The initial aroma after pouring was floral hops! followed by sweet malts and some fruitiness (figs, raisins, and apples) and a bit of oak. As the beer breathed and warmed, the dominance of the hops in the smell and taste faded and bit, and the malt resurged to counterbalance perfectly. Much like the smell, the initial taste was one of a strong hop presence, followed by a valiant attack by the malt. Again, with warming and breathing, the flavor became very balance between the malty/fruity sweetness and the puckering hop bitterness. Despite this, the mouthfeel was smooth and full bodied, with a lingering sweetness and hop flavor. Moderate carbonation. Somewhat warming. This was a very drinkable ale (almost dangerously so), and I wanted more! I definitely recommend allowing this one to warm towards room temperature from refridgerator termperature to get the full experience.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Darkale,4.1,"2003 edition. So much packed in a little 12 ounce bottle! Over the top flavor of roasted malts, and immense sweetness, with a dark, almost French roast charcoal-toasty edge. Just shy of too much malt sweetness, reined in by a rough burning edge of hops. Great tan head, just phenomenal, resilient with superb lacing.  Watch out, this stuff goes down easy. I only bought one, else I'd have been hard-pressed to avoid to urge to see what it's like after 2 or 3. Bring on Sasquatch; this will tame him.  Another reason why one should love Sierra Nevada.

140,2671,longpondbeerman,3.68,"From a stubby (classic Sierra Nevada style) 12 oz. bottle, Bigfoot pours a luscious dark reddish amber with highly visible and active carbonation. There was a medium head which settled rapidly. First smell revealed a distinct citrus smell (I could not tell whether it was lime or something else), and the taste likewise is a potent, tart, citrusy first impression which does not fade at all (lots of hops, too) and ends with a definite alcohol finish.

140,2671,GreatPondBrewer,3.83,"2003 batch This beer was very difficult for me. Being a big hophead this was awesome, but the taste was something my palate could not readily deal with. The pour was a spectacular deep red, like the color of sunset with an almost yellow head. The smell was all hops with a great lime aroma that dominated. The taste though was too strong for me. Now I can drink strong beers no problem, but the alcohol on this beer was not hidden at all. There was nice hops in the aftertaste, but my mouth was dominated the alcohol. Tasted almost medicinal like a harsh cough syrup. The mouthfeel was exceptionaly creamy.

140,2671,jeffboo,4.85,"A classic beer and label from the boys in Chico. This bottle is vintage 1998, found, I'm guessing at Blue Max Liquor in Burnsville,MN this year. The aging had alot to do with this review. The balance between hops,malt and alcohol could have only occurred with a prolonged aging. The flavors here are the reason we age certain brews.  This beer is a dark ruby color with nice tan head for a barleywine of this strength.The aroma? HOPS- pow. Ok now that I've regained my senses, there is also brown sugar,earth,vanilla,chocolate,oakwood,and more and more HOPS.  The flavors are stunning- fine tobacco,vanilla,oak,maple syrup and an alcohol with hop bitterness finish. The flavors are well rounded and the body is, strangely, medium- which makes it even more enjoyable to drink.I think single malt lovers would love the complexity of this beer, and so smooth for almost 10% abv.

Bitterness. Burnt grapefruit, if there is such a thing. Maybe some grass and earth, too.  Mouthfeel: Thin. But, that is partly my fault, as I was too impatient to allow it to warm up enough.

Aroma is room filling with piney hops, some slight fruity/malty sweetness sneaks in, but is overpowered by the hops. Flavor is pretty much the same, it's almost all hops, lots of citrus (grapefruit), and strongly bitter. Again, some fruity and malty sweetness comes through, but the hops just smack it down.

A light tan head starts off a full inch tall and shrinks to a steady, and persistant, cap. This brew leaves tons of lace down the side of the glass.  Smell: Tons of raw, pungent hop aroma with the highlights being pine and citrus. There's a malt backbone, but it's buried underneath all the hops. A touch of alcohol is there as well. Very raw and unrefined...I love it.  Taste: Starts with a 'wham-bam-thank-you-maam!' explosion of hop flavor and bitterness. This one is still young and out of control! Just like the aroma, it's all pine and citrus (lots of grapefruit) here. After the initial bitter onslaught, the malt makes it's presence known, and comes across as caramel and fruity. Towards the end, the hop flavor changes into a slighty burnt flavor. Finishes with a rush of warming alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Very syrupy and rich with a medium mouthfeel. Finishes dry...  Drinkability: Hmmm...this is where this brew takes it on the nose. I'd love to sit here and kill the whole six-pack, but tomorrow morning would be rough. Still, it's a killer beer, and one of the best barleywines to be found...

140,2671,FirkinDave,4.05,The first time I had this beer was the 2001 batch. It was huge and sloppy in its delivery of flavors ranging from citrus and grapefruit to carmal and hops. It was comperable to a small fireworks display going off on my palette. The beer overall seemed like it should be aged a bit and thats exactly what we did. Holy crap what a difference! After aging it for a year and a month (couldn't wait any longer!!) The flavors balanced out perfectly. Good dark saturated amber color and a great carmel hop nose lead the rush of smooth flavors. First a bit apple/malt which led to hops then caramel finishing with a grapefruit punch and smooth dark finish.. yeah I said smooth and barley wine in the same paragraph! I drank this in a pint and not a snifter.

140,2671,LarryKemp,3.92,This Barleywine poured very dark with a nice stand of off white head. The head retention was very good and the lace clung to the side of the brandy sniffter glass. The hoppiness grabbed your nose and you knew you were in for a hoppy beer. The hops were very strong but were offset somewhat by the sweetness of the malts. BUT the hops won the battle and lingered on the tongue LONG after the liquid was swallowed. The mouthfeel was disappointing for such a strong beer. Maybe the hops were so dominate the mouthfeel was lost but I never was aware of the liquid.

140,2671,mzwolinski,4.17,"2003 Vintage: Nice nose to this one, with a firm malty base, fruity notes of apple and grape, a bit of alcohol, and of course, coming form Sierra Nevada, some citric/piney hops. Appearance is a hazy cherry red, with almost no head at all. Taste is malt-dominated, very fruity, with a mildly spicy but mostly warming alcohol, and a piney hop finish. Medium-full body with a dry finish and a lingering citric bitter and somewhat sugary aftertaste. Quite nice!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Bierman9,4.83,"Watching some football tonight (09JAN10) and having the last of my 2005 and 2006 Bigfoots (Bigfeet??). Lots of malt in there... toffee and caramel... very English-like these days; quite tasty... Just one 2004 left... :-( Cheers!!  *** ***  Raising my last 2003 vintage today (11NOV09) in honor of our Vets! At about 6.75 years old, the appearance is still top-shelf. Chestnut colored with a thin, tan head. Aroma has lots of caramel and toffee, and there's still some piney hop action present. Smooth and silky on the tongue, and the body is still solid. Immediate flavors on the palate are caramel and toffee malts, but there's still a huge, resiny, citrussy hop character present, after all these years. Leaning much more towards an English style BW these days, but still verry nice! Thnx Vets!!  *** ***  2007 vintage, side-by-side with a 2006 (17MAR07)... the '07 is clear, garnet-hued, while, surprisingly, the '06 looks darker and opaque. No sediment found in the bottle... odd... Aroma of the '07 is verry hoppy, while the '06 has gone a bit down the malty route, reminding me a lot of an Old Ho. Both exceedingly smooth and nicely bodied. Flavor-wise, the fresh '07 is sappy, resiny, piney... lining the mouth with lupulins... the hops in the '06 are still in-yer-face, though toffee-ish malt stands out quite easily, and tastily. Verry tasty, on both counts, though I think I like the fresh, hoppier '07 version. Same ratings across the board... (Btw...still have 2x '03, 2x '04, 2x '05, plus lots of '06 and '07 in the cellar fridge). Prosit!!  overall: 4.85 appearance: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | mouthfeel: 4.5 | drinkability: 5  *** ***  2006 vintage (31JAN06) - Super chestnut/garnet hue... clear... no sediment in any of the 5x bottles I've had so far... Creamy, tan head... thins yet sticks beautifully to the glass. Aroma still hop-laden, yet not citrussy as before.... lots of caramel/toffee... plus rindy hops. Smooth, creamy, almost full-bodied. A chewy delight! Caramel malty sweetness initially.... then a heavy dose of resiny/piney/oily hops which get applied lacquer-like to the insides of the mouth and cling there lovingly... Superb this year; absolutely superb! Same scores as 2003 version. Prosit!!  *** ***  2005 vintage (23NOV07) - 2.75 years old. Still has a chestnut/mahogany, though this one has some cloudiness, from the yeasties swirled in.... Thin, beige head... nice lace.... Toffee nose combined with some citrus... rindy/piney action... Lovely mouthfeel.... solid medium+ body, and smooth on the tongue.... Nice malt.... can we say toffee and caramel too often? Solid citrus hop action.... resiny still, coats the throat... lingering maltiness, al-la Victory Old Ho or another Brit style BW.... still a very good bier.... have 1 more left from '05.... Prosit!!  2003 vintage (23NOV07) - 4.75 years later... My 2nd to last of this year... Color's the same...how can that change? Still nice lacing.... Aroma now is all caramel and toffee.... Can you say maltified? Solid mouthfeel, as always.... Flavor? Some malt there, though nothing in the way of what the aroma suggests. Nose says this is all-malt, in the English style. Tongue says there's some toffee, but then there's still a lot of rindy, piney hop action going on, coating the tongue and throat with lupulins. Still quite hoppy, though with a lead-off blast of toffee-ish/caramel malts. Yummy!! (No new ratings, as this is 4.5+ years old...) Oh, btw, Happy Birthday Dad!!  *** ***  2003 vintage (02MAR03) - Color is a rich chestnut/mahogany hue, with a prodigious, tan head. Lacing is top-notch! Aroma is heavy on the citrusy hops (Cascade?) and superb! The mouthfeel is dee-lish-shuss!!! Full-bodied and silky smooth! Oh yeah!! Unsure what I was writing about last year (dark fruit??) but this is hop-heaven!! There is some residual sweetness from the malt, but it's all grapefruity hops from there on in! And I can STILL taste them long after finishing the sip. They just linger and linger.... What staying power! (If only I...) Sorry... This is a fabulous bier, and still young, too! I had initially put aside 3 bottles of '02 last year for cellaring....but then 1 day last summer I said ""wtf!"" and quaffed all 3!!! Oh well.... a couple of these '03 babes are in the cellar now! Be patient, Bierman!! I'll definitely get more, though (especially at $6.99/six). (5.0/4.5/5.0/4.5/5.0 = 4.85) Prosit!!!  *** ***  2002 vintage. This baby was lovely. Had the pleasure of experiencing her on tap (03MAR02), and, just recently (07APR02), from the bottle. Inviting dark brown color with a fine creamy head. Love the aroma: Strong whiffs of dark fruit and some alcohol. Great mouthfeel; medium-full body and great smoothness. Great flavor of those dark fruits, alcohol and hops thrown in. Super mix! Really....for a barleywine...lots o' hops....what a combo!!! Great brew!!! Way good stuff!

140,2671,Winter,4.08,"2002 Vintage. Color is a hazy ruby/amber with a thick creamy off-white head. Tantalizing aroma consists of cherry (or other fruit), malt, citrusy hops and a touch of brandy. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, crisp and oh-so smooth. The sweet fruitiness is balanced well with the malt flavors. Finish is a where the hops seem to really make their presence known. Alcohol is there and the effects certainly start to kick in about half-way through, but the taste is hidden very well.

140,2671,Dmann,4.73,"Wow, what a great Barleywine! I had heard a lot of good things about the Bigfoot but have now just gotten around to trying it. This is the 2003 vintage. It poured a very dark copper color with a great tan color head that lasted quite awhile for a barleywine head. The dominant aromas were of corse hops, and then beneath that was a fruity, floral scent. I let this beer warm a bit before drinking, and the flavor was great. It reminded me of the SN celebration ale, but with way more alchohol and more malty sweetness. As soon as it hits your mouth, you get the blast of hops, then the sweetness sneaks in followed by the warming feeling of the alchohol. As far as barleywines go, this is right up there with Stone's Old Guardian for the best you can get.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

140,2671,BeerAngel,4.22,"Pours a hazed amber/tea color with a modest light tan head. The aromas are malty, biscuity, and fruity with light alcohol and hop notes. It smells awesome and makes my mouth water just anticipating the first taste! The taste has strong alcohol presence and fades into a citrus hopped smack right in the tasters. The light biscuity and malty taste in the background are nice to be able to detect, but arent as noticeable as they could be or even perhaps, should be. I feel like aging this could make these flavors more balanced, so I will save back a couple bottles for this purpose. The mouthfeel is a nice medium body and unfortunately with the large alcohol presence, the drinkability score wont be what I had hoped. This is still a very nice brew with lots of complexity, yet its unbalanced flavors should come together very nicely with a little more time in the bottle.

The pour is a very bright red when viewed by a lamp with a tannish-orangey head that laced nicely and stuck around.

140,2671,AudioGilz,3.75,"2003, Color is dark brown/indian red. The head is very thick and likes to hang out. Just a small whiff and hops hops in the aroma, very bittersweet. This beer definitely required some adjustment of my palate. It was way too overly hoppy at first. But as I got into it, and it warmed, it was still hoppy of course, but much more enjoyable. Thick and kind of syrupy in way, this full bodied brew has some kick! I haven't tried many barleywines yet, but they will probably grow on me. This one wasn't too drinkable to me. I enjoyed the hoppy flavor as it warmed though. The alcohol didn't seem evident for being so high. Definitely a kick ass brew, something that I'm sure I'll grow to enjoy more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Bruiser81,4.1,"02 batch  This beer poured a deep amber-gold with a nice white head that reduced down to a thin layer on top of the brew. The smell is complex with a fruity smell with obvious alcohol aroma's and plenty of hops. The taste starts out a bit sweet but that is quickly overwhelmed by the warmth of the alcohol. The finish and aftertaste is all crisp hops with a constant lingering of the alcohol. This beer has a definite warming effect. I'm not sure what kind of hops are used but they are not really bitter, almost more of a grassy taste.

140,2671,doho95fu,4.85,"I am not the biggest barleywine fan (or so I thought), so I was not even going to buy a six pack of this beer when it came in at my local beer store - but luckily I did. The color is deep reddish brown with a tan creamy head and minimal lacing. The beer appears slighly cloudy and lower in carbonation. The smell is of hops, alcohol and maybe peaches, surely some sort of fruit. The flavor is hoppy as well, with fruitiness and some citrus tones in there. The alcohol level does come out in the taste department, but not in a negative way. There is that little heat sensation from the ABV and then its back to the flavor.

A very sharp hoppy aroma with notes of caramel make for a bittersweet nose. Slightly grassy too.  Flavor is very hop driven. More like an IPA than a barleywine at first. As the beer warms and my palate adjusts, I taste fruits in abundance: lemon peel, orange, grapefruit and caramelized apricots.  Mouthfeel is full and creamy with dead on carbonation.  Drinkability is a toss-up...While I'd love to have another right now, I may regret it.

Had a powerful hoppy aroma even before I poured it. After the pour I can detect some grassy and caramel aromas, in addition to the hops, of course. It looks very murky, like muddy water, with a slight reddish glow to it.  I expected this to have a killer hop bite, but it is surprisingly mellow. Earthy flavors balance well with the floral notes. There is also a slight candy-like sweetness towards the end and a bit of warming alcohol as an after-effect. Leaves my mouth wanting more. I've wanted to try this brew for a long time and it has been well worth the wait. A damn good brew, and most likely even more enjoyable after a few years in the cellar.

140,2671,hyuga,4.58,"Fresh from the 2003 batch. Characteristic barleywine deep crimson with a thick cream-colored head. Head retention is excellent. Very nice to look at. All of this adds up to a perfect 5 for appearance, not surprisingly. In the nose, there's hop character of impressive magnitude. You can tell it's hopped generously, and with different hop varieties. It's very floral and a bit tree-like overall. The malt backbone is big and strong, offering intense caramel and deep grain up for sniffing. Flavors are just as varied and complex, if not more. A rush of heavy caramel is first in the front with an underlying grain character. Near the middle, the hops come in. Very leafy, oily, and resin-like with a serious, but well-targeted bite of bitterness. Sweetness shows up in the finish. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, just perfect. Pretty smooth for a fresh barleywine, but still intense in a wonderful way!

One inch of dense, light cream-colored head dies slowly leaving thick lacing. The color is a transparent deep red/red-brown.  The nose has flowers, spice, slight sweetness, soap?  Wow. Thick, complex, malty start gives way to a ton of hops. Spicy, but not like a spiced beer. The middle is complex with hops, citrus, lots of malt, alcohol, and that spiciness. Thick. Rich. Bitter. Sweet. Intense. Finish is bitter with all those hops, but my head is spinning from all the flavors.  This beer is fascinating. It's well balanced, but balanced in the sense that all my tastebuds are firing at 100%. Alcohol is evident, but takes a back seat behind all the strong flavors. I'm willing to cut it some slack on the slight over-hopping because it's from California. All in all, a good beer experience. I'm cellaring some for next year.  --- 2004 release  Two inches of dense, flat, rich, light-tan head sits on a gorgeous, deep, mahogany/red-brown body. Sticky, crusty, foam lacing. Aroma sports rich, rich, oily hops with milk chocolate malt. Huge, piney hops dominate the front with a thick, buttery malt arriving fashionably late.

The smell is lots of hops and sweet malt, until you take a sip and breathe in. Whoa!!! Rubbing Alcohol!!. Never noticed this before..try smelling while you're sipping..you'll see what I mean. Still a 4 for smell because you really have to try to get this effect..This beer tastes awesome. Unlike in the the smell, the alcohol is hidden well. Tons of floral hops but the malts manage to break through in the mix to make things even more interesting. My tongue is tingling after a good sip. Ever put your tongue up to a nine-volt?

Awe-inspiring hops profile on the palate (same as the nose), warming, the alcohol is noticeable, a note of underlying malt is detectable with a pinch of sweetness. This is a damn great quaff. The finish is citrusy, a tad tacky yet lovely. A hearty brew it is a must try for any beer drinker.

The head was very thick at first and was a creamy color, kind of like sea foam. The taste is interesting. It's got quite a bite to it, kind of peppery, but at the same time, there is evidence of some fruit, maybe something citrusy. The mouthfeel is fairly good too. It coats your mouth, so it's nice and smooth. I don't know if I could drink this too much. It's kind of like Sam Adams winterbrew.

Nose is dominated by strong floral hops. Some notes of fresh fruit and alcohol are also present. Taste is sweet syrupy caramel at first, but then the hops take over in a big way. Raw oily hop resins are the key player here with some additional flavors of bitter grapefruit rind, fresh pine, and a hint of dark fruits. Pretty solid and heavy mouth feel.

It looks about the same as it always doesmurky, brownish red with a tan head that lasts a lot longer than I expected it to. The light brown, infinitely small bubbles formed a blanket across the top of the glass, almost like Guinness at the outset. They then mostly retreated, like most beers heads do, to the safe confines of the edge of the glass. The viscosity was even higher than I remembered from last yearthe beer emerged from the bottle almost as if it were port  very little splashing and no head until I raised the bottle an uncomfortable distance above the glass.  The aroma is hard to put my finger onyeah, its hoppy and grapefruity with an underpinning of sweet malt (like brown sugar) and amplifying alcohol, but theres something else too. Its almost leathery, or even meaty, in some vague way. It also has a big, green leafiness to it: it smells like a big, dark green, oily leaf (perhaps a Magnolia leaf?) looks. On top of that, it has the burnt hop aroma that I notice frequently and comment on occasionally as well: like most of the hops were in the kettle for most of the boil.  The flavor attacks the mouth just like the nose prepared us for. The vinous, brown-sugary, leafy, thick bitterness completely coats the palate from the first sip. Its no wonder that barleywines are an acquired taste, because if I didnt appreciate the brewers skill required to make this beer, I think Id hate it. The big, almost cloying maltiness is magnified by the substantial alcohol presence and THEN the hops come in! The massive alpha acid attack is relentless, beating my palate into unwilling submissionI will not be able to taste another beer tonight.  Like I sensed in the aroma, this beer has the burnt sensation in the flavor as well, magnified, like the sweetness, by the alcohol. That over-caramelized sugar flavor, which is so intense its almost like melted plastic, lingers unendingly after I swallow. Yet somehow, through all this punishment, I cant wait for another sip. I also cant wait to try my bottle of 2002 side-by-side with this 2003 to see how much of the crippling harshness wore off after a year of cellaring.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,TheLongBeachBum,4.28,"*Vintage 2003*  As I told Elvis Presley last year when we were playing Cards with Lord Lucan whilst monster watching at Loch Ness - I dont believe in the existence of Bigfoots. But to my astonishment and utter surprise, fellow BA DavidBanner managed to catch one recently and gave it me for further investigation.  A rare example of this mythical being, this sub-species was the Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale, a long named beer that comes in a short 12 fl.oz. bottle. The Cap says simply Bigfoot 2003 Expedition.  A huge tanned head is generated as I poured the beer, which settles to a superb looking 2 deep foamy-tastic looking froth that laces and sticks to the sides of the glass like Sasquatch manure cling-ons stick to untrimmed fur. The body of the beer is a majestic looking powerful deep mahogany copper color with a slight haze. It really looks the part. The nasal quality is strong and very deep. It fills the back of the Cranium with roasted smells and odors that expand the veins, capillaries and fires off intense brain activity. This beer really drinks to its mighty 9.6% ABV; a mighty mouth warming alcohol kick introduces this beer. Hop-bitterness is strong in the beginning and signposts a smooth road surface through to the beers malty middle. Then a ride downhill culminates with a warming finish that will give your cheeks a ruddy complexion and a glow in your eyes.  This is no man in a fur suit. Its the real thing. An Excellent Barley Wine style Ale. Sipped during a warm 76 Degrees Fahrenheit night in Long Beach whilst sat on my balcony  somehow does not do justice to this most warming of beers. I want to share this drink in an isolated snow encrusted cabin cuddled-up with someone very special. (I wonder what that waitress from Lucky Baldwins is doing next week). What a beer!!!  So you dont still believe in Bigfoots then?? I have seen one in Captivity. But I would still dearly love to see one in the wild though, ""On Tap"". That pleasure still awaits me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Strong hop pressence in the front of the mouth and hints of the alcohol potency in the back of the mouth. But probably not bad enough to ruin whatever different beer you may drink afterwards. Good beer, but it doesn't seem to live up to the hype I've heard from friends and fans of this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,jtw5877,4.97,"2003 edition. Pours a dark amber color with a white head. This is an excellent beer. Prominent hoppiness with a massive malt backbone. Everything I want in a barleywine. The only thing that kept this from getting a 5.0 was a quickly dissipating head, but with flavours this tasty it's ok. A great barleywine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,elmocoso,4.69,"Aahh - I pulled this one out of my closet the other night after hiding and forgetting about it for a year. This is a 2002, and i can sure tell the difference after letting this baby age for a year.  It poured a cloudy copper-red color with a nice rich tan head that soon fell to a ring and a nice lacy blanket across the top of the beer.  The smell is fabulous and complex - a rich malty sweet with a vail of citrusy hops. I can not tell that there is a winner for most prominant, because it seems they co-exist in perfect rich harmony.  The taste is great. sweet and malty at first, gliding over the tounge like a slippery eel and leaving a bitterness in the back that makes you long for another drink, more maltyness to compliment the after-taste.  The mouthfeel is great, easy on the tounge. This beer is great, and of course i wish i would have held out with the five that i dranke prematurely - hell, this one was probably a little premature, but hay, a year takes a lot of self controll.  I will seek and destroy a sixer of this years addition - hopefully, and just maybe get another sixer to stash and hopefully forget.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,HopheadEd,4.3,"A 1995 edition! Poured into a large snifter, despite a vigorous pour there was no head at all, no lace. Dark brown you can not see through, with speckles of sparkling bits of I don't know what. The aroma is that of the 2002 I had a few weeks ago. malt and tart candy. The taste of malt is overwhelming, but in a good way, surprisingly fresh! Smooth mouthfeel, creamy and slightly tart. A fine crisp finish with a big alcohol bite but not too much for a beer aged 7 plus years. Sip it slow, as I did, and enjoy, as I did!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,aaronh,4.25,"2002 edition.  Hazy orange-copper color beer pours with a minimalist tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring along the edge of the glass. Strong fruit and alcohol aroma smells mostly like plums. Perhaps a touch of hops in the nose as well. The taste is very hoppy, much more than the other barleywines I've had. Also unlike the others, this one is not overly sweet. Reminds me more of a robust, powerful IPA than the sweet barleywines I have become familiar with. A bit more fruitiness and sweetness shows after a few more drinks, but this is an amazingly balanced beer. (even the ""Hop burps"" are both sweet and hoppy!) Very nice bitterness on the finish. Can't quite place the type of hops, but it tastes like possibly Liberty or Cascade. The mouthfeel is not as syrupy thick as others. While this hurts my mouthfeel rating a bit, it elevates the drinkability. Even with the high ABV, I could drink several of these. Really a great winter warmer. Perfect for a night when we might be hitting single digits. Or any night that you want a powerful, well balanced beer. On top of the great beer, the label on the bottle is decent as well. If you are a beer fan, find this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Dogbrick,3.97,"2002 Bottle: Another winner thanks to the Hollingshead Deli in Orange. Deep amber color with a thin and rocky off-white head. Huge toasty malt aroma. Flavor of malt, alcohol and dark fruit. This is easily the hoppiest Barley Wine I have had, but it actually works pretty well. The hops make it more drinkable than the usual overly sweet malt/alcohol found in most Barley Wines. This would be a great beer to age for a year or two.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,zerk,3.95,"Pours a hazy deep amber with a pillowy beige head. Sticky lace covers the sides of the glass. Aroma is very complex... port wine, raisins, herbs, pepper, and a touch of pine. Flavor is very bold... semi-sweet chocolate and raisins, with a grainy middle, some pepper and herbs, and an in-your-face bitterness to finish things off. The hops are quite intense. The alcohol is very prominant in the finish as well. Has a syrupy mouthfeel with mild carbonation. Suffers a bit in the drinkability department, because of the intense flavors and high bitterness. I wouldn't drink this very often. Even so, this is one of the best Barley Wine Ales I've come across.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,stoutlove77,4.15,"I got a chance to savor this one on tap at Lucky Baldwin's, man is this stuff not to be dealt with by the weak. This is the first time I try a Barley Wine style ale and it was sure memorable.The color was a deep amber with a nice light head. The taste is a bitter with a fresh light essence of caramel and i believe hops.. The drinkablity is going to be low, the ABV of 9.6 rated here doesnt feel close, in fact I believe this one had a lot more for I was in unexpected high gravity country and I wasn't coming back till the next morning. Overall a good one, enjoy at ease.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,inebrius,3.76,"Mmmm, big beer. Tasty big beer, full of caramel and nut skins and citric hops. An alcoholic praline. Profound amber hues and sticky fingers of lace. Sasquatch nose of toffee, sour fruits and ferns. Most excellent and more like the toothless tree-topping critter from Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer than any hairy, scary Pacific Northwest beastie. A quick, happy sipper.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,CharlesRiver,4.32,"The very first barley wine-style ale that I had and it is still one of my favorite beers of all time. This bottle is from the 2001 batch. Pours a cloudy amber color with no head at all. The smell is sweet sherry with a dose of hops. The alcohol is very prominent, more prominent than I remembered. I am going to wait until this one warms up a bit in terms of temperature.  While I wait, there is a cool drawing under the cap. A ""bigfoot"" sitting by the fire with two guys.  I had this on tap at Redbones this summer and it was amazing.  Now that the temperature has come up a bit the ale becomes more smooth and balanced. The alcohol isn't so pronounced.  Still one of my favorites and I can't wait for 2002 to come out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,maxpower,4.08,"Last years 2001, Unlike any barley wine I have ever had.Lots and lots of hops, like most of their beers. I like hops so I love this barley wine., citrusy and sweet aroma aroma, malty as hell, and loaded with hops, I always like the bigfoot, gets alot better aged for at least a year, mellows the hop out a bit.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,HossMcGraw,4.75,"Malty and hoppy as hell! I bought a single of this from Quick Six. They are used to people buying forties and sixers of Coors Light, so they didn't know how much to charge me for this. Their stuff is so overpriced, I didn't really feel too guilty about taking advantage of the discount I recieved. All they had to do is go to the cooler and check the price, but apparently they were too damn lazy. Score! This is a serious brew for serious beer drinkers. I had yet to try a barleywine, and I have to say that this was a wonderful experience. If you want an in your face kind of brew, this one gets the Hoss McGraw seal of approval. They wanted sixteen dollars for a six pack, and that was more than I was willing to pay, but I really wish I had some more now. A definite must-try for all beer geeks.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,BeerBuilder,4.2,"This is a tasty Barley Wine-Style Ale. It pours to a nice amber color. Its nose is one of malt and spice. Your every sip is hit with a blast of alcohlic warmth and spicy-bitterness. Overall, this is an excellent beer that is sure to keep you warm on a cold winter night.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,allboutbierge,4.82,"BAM! Bigfoot's hops whacks you across the nose as soon as you crack the bottle. This beer makes you stop caring about the world. The head holds for quite some time, and the lace sticks on the side of the glass throughout the lifespan of the beverage. This is one of the heaviest laces i've ever seen! There is a very heavy hoppy taste present. For a high alcohol beer, bigfoot hides it well. It provides a slight warmth that makes it quite enjoyable on a winter afternoon. There is no better brew after a hard day of skiing. The egyptians did something right when the 1st brewed barley-wine. Now I realize how they built the pyrimads without the wheel.  5KD favorite.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Suds,4.87,"In spring 2001 I bought two cases of this beer and set several bottles aside. It was terrific then, and has only improved with age. Deep burgundy color with a single finger tan head and beautiful, clingy lace. The aroma is sublime. Intense malt and intense hops. The forceful hop bitterness has mellowed with age, and seemed to merge with the overall character of the beer. I love the hop finish....still goes on forever. Alcohol is more hidden than when the beer was young, but still provides warming. What a wonderful beer!!!!!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,aracauna,4.01,"After the chill haze cleared (I served it too cold) the body was a deep ruby. Head is light beige and nicely creamy. Aroma is good crisp citrus peel hops. Surprisingly low bitterness when cold for such a strong hop aroma. The hops come out stronger as the beer warms giving the beer a nice bitter finish. Mildly sweet malt dominates early on. Some chocolate, which surprises me from a comparatively light colored beer. Also has a distinct breadiness to the flavor. Can't say anything bad about this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Wildman,4.25,"Okay, this is only maybe my 2nd or third barleywine. It poured an amber color and formed a nice light tan head that left some lace. The aroma was of hops, fruit,some alcohol and caramel. The taste was definately of hops, with some caramel and a slight indication of alcohol. The finish was a bit bitter and dry. So far this is best one I have tried so far.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ADR,4.52,"I'm usually the first to say that I find Sierra products over-rated, the Pale is pretty tame and the Stout has weird sour flavors to my tongue. But this is a brew...  Amber color, hazy with an impressive head of 1/2 inch. Smell is complex -- hop oil, candied fruit, residual slight sugarcane sweetness. Flavor is marvelously all over the map. Hoppy, peach and plum in brandy, and a finale of gravelly grapefruit citrus that could scour the sink. That the brew is very drinkable is testament to the malts even keeping up. Mouthcoating, mutating flavors, and a potential for mellowing over time -- what else do you need in a beer?",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,StevieW,3.43,"The third barleywine I have tried and really not for me. I understand the complexities of this beer, but I didn't find it enjoyable. Pours a deep brown with ruby shades, soft tan head that fades away. Very strong bitter hop smell. Taste is dominated by the same overly bitter hops presence. Thin feel due to very noticable high alcohol.Can't get over the bitter, acrid taste. I can see where this is appreciated in colder climate as a sipper, but in that case, I would just have a nice scotch. IMO, a bit overrated and not a top 10 beer. I will store one and revisit it next winter, as for the other 4, if anyone wants them, let me know........",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Pegasus,4.43,"Cloudy amber brown with a truly massive head that lingers until the end, slight carbonation. The head is wonderfully creamy with lots of sticky lace, no other beer that I have tried can compare. Very potent aroma in which strong hops dominate, but sweet caramel malt, bitter citrus, pine sap, and alcohol are noticable as well. Hops throughly dominate the taste with strong bitterness that does not really linger, and also impart flavors of pine and bitter grapefruit. Malty sweetness is also present, it plays well against the contrasting alcohol flavors. The alcohol notes are very potent and quite warming. Dark fruit notes finish out the flavor. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. Should be consumed carefully and with respect, due both to its stunning quality and its potency. This incredible beer will no doubt will only improve with a couple of years of aging.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Todd,4.47,"2001: Hell yeah! A bit raw, but expected for such a young big beer. Lay this baby down for some years and you'll have a totally different beer ... but back to this one.  Dark copper, with a nice patchy foam head. Killer aroma of aggressive hops with a citric sting. A very creamy and smooth beer. Flavour is initially overrun by hops (grapefruity, piney, salty, leafy and raw as all hell), then the big malt sweetness (a tad treacle-like) and alcohol flavours kick in to smooth things out. Fruity? yes. Oh, and by the way, the alcohol is very present, warming and dangerous.  Treat this beer with the utmost respect ... sip and savour.  Anyone look at the inside of the cap? Gotta love that image of 2 campers sitting down with BigFoot and having some brews over a campfire. Hell yeah!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,WilliamPhilaPa,4.13,"Pours a deep reddish-brown color, with a minimal off-white colored head. On the nose are sweet fruity aromas, alcohol, and slight citric hop. Mouth feel is fairly smooth. There is an immense malt front on the palate with sweet fruit undertones in the middle. I really enjoyed the brewIm wondering if this is why I woke up feeling like someone had hit me in the head with a brick last night, or was it the EKU 28 I had before that? Anywaygreat stuff",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,tigerpaws,2.85,"This beer just wasn't for me, could for sure tell the alcohol content was there by the aroma. My main drawback was the sweetness, I just didn't care for it.

140,2671,Murph,4.35,"Pours a bright amber with a rocky off-white head. Smell is hops, hop oil, hops, light malt, and some barely perceptible alcohol. The first flavors on the tongue are of extreme hops. The hops stay all the way through but are floating on a tide of sweet caramel maltiness for most of the taste. Some dark fruits are also evident in the malt flavors. Creamy, slightly thick syrupy mouthfeel but still very drinkable. If this brew is this good after a couple months I can't wait to see what it is going to be like in a few years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,bmills1608,3.95,"Pours a dark, dark red, somewhat hazy, slightly white tan head developes nicely and sticks with the brew in a small scale through out.  Nose is prickly hoppy with lots of earthy bitterness combined with malty sweetness  Taste is predominatley sweet, malty, with dried fruits (prune and raisen) but totally balanced with a real blast of deep bitterness that keeps the sweet in check. The alcohol is noticable but not overwhelming.  Very Powerful stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,frank4sail,4.88,"2002, I have saved this beer (6 pack) with anticipation for my 100th review.. and man was it worth it... Perfect color for style between copper and medium brown. Nice thick brown head. Sweet initial taste, but then bam! an explosion of balanced bitterness... the finish is one of silky smooth orange rind.  In between sips my mind is reminded (by my tongue) of campari. It is a luring seductive bitterness. Hops is a gift from god and the brewers of SN understand that fact very well.... I can't wait to taste this again in the fall when it becomes even smoother and more complex. Be careful you will not notice the killer ABV..   2003 4.5 4.5 4 4.5 4 sweet malt nose with fresh crisp hops. Dark ruby color with a sticky beige head and lace which is lasting. Slight ripe fruit smell as well. Original bitter grapefruit taste which slowly reaches around the tongue with s sweet malty backbone. Up front it has a smooth fuller mouth. The tongue is left dry on the tip and wet and watery on the back. A liitle too up front in its bitterness but that should mellow with age.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Brent,4,"I've been looking for this beer ever since it stormed onto the top beers right out of the gate. While this is certainly a good barleywine, it didn't knock my socks of like I hoped. Nice murky brown appearance, with a good head for a BW. Hops tickles the nose, and the first sip is packed with resin hops. Prune and caramel follow, with a well moderated bittersweetness. There was a raw alcohol note present, which I attribute to the beer's youth, and this may mellow out in a while.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ZAP,4.6,"Perhaps the most balanced BW I have had to date. Orangish in color with a frothy head...Aroma is not as strong as expected but the hops are evident...The hops hit the buds immediately but a good malty backbone to this as well. some alcohol evident on the taste early in the beer, but it mellows and you'd never guess the potency later on. some darker fruit flavors and good hopping but not quite as complex or flavorful as expected. Very, very balanced though so maybe that is why the strong flavors are not shining though entirely(I still gave it a 4.5 on taste, but I expected to go 5.0)..must have a heavy malt load to balance the hops..smooth and easy drinking....the second bottle poured a head like a root beer float (Maybe the first one hit me too hard and I blew the pour)..creamy lace sticks to glass from top to bottom...the best overall barley wine I have had, but not the most intensely flavored..",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Jordan,5,"Heady fruity and spicey and alchoholic aromas. A very thick malt rush start, then a semi-bitter rind/citrus peel coarseness is abrasive on the palate. Alchoholic notes. Complex and overflowing with a rich character. This has been a very difficult brew to find here in Fresno, CA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Bighuge,4.82,"Nice looking burgandy. Although not necessary, there is a light tannish head. Smell is beautifully bitter. First indication: this beer has been dry hopped abundantly. When that first drop of beer hits the tongue you know you're in for an amazing brew experience. The malt backbone in this fairly evident even though this brew is insanely hopped. Great citrus hop tones. Great bitterness that lingers for a while and then fades gradually. This is the kind of hop bite that I love. (Maybe centenial or nugget??) This was the first barleywine that I tried (2 years ago) and remains my favorite after tasting many, many more.  2001 bottling: Pours a deep burgandy which is a bit murky. Oily bitter hops on the nose. The slight off-white head has some retention and laces nicely. Even after a year, I can still perceive a HIGH OCTANE bitter bite and some alcohol on the tongue. A bit surprising it's still this intense. This baby could age easily for several more years. As with most Bigfoots that I have tried, this beer does have good balance. There is a solid malt backing, but the hops are the entree here. This is a Top Tier Barleywine.  2000 bottling: Pours a clear mahogany with a very slight head. Beautiful bitter hop notes mixed with sweet caramel malt on the nose. This beer is medium to full bodied. It has a nice refined bitterness and hoppiness. Not nearly as over-the-top bitter as fresh samples of this same brew. The malt tones are really starting to show. And they are really nice. Sweet caramel malt. There is still some noticeable alcohol on the palate as well. Don't be fooled however. Even after 2 years of cellaring, this beer is still all about the hops and bitterness.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,mickeymac,4.55,"This is happiness in a glass. It starts with a big beautiful head. The color is a nice deep ared. The aroma and taste of the hops seems a bit overwhelming at first, but everything starts to work together very well after a few sips. The 2002 is my first Bigfoot. However, this one doesn't seem to leave much room for improvement.  I just tried the '03 BF and found it to be similar to a young '02. Recently, I've had a chance to sample some leftover '02 Bigfoots and they've aged very well. The hop bitterness is still very much up front, but it has mellowed a bit, as has the alcohol smell and taste.

140,2671,John,4.5,"IMHO, it doesn't get much better than this. I didn't find this too bitter like some of the other reviewers.

140,2671,marc77,4.5,"Beautiful ruby hue w/ good clarity. The thick initial head settles to a modest but creamy and persistent off - white one that leaves lace all down the glass. Gorgeous & appetizing in appearance. Citrusy, piney, bold American hop nose from the four C's (minus Columbus) dominate the nose, but caramel malt, fusels, toffee, subtle fruitiness and a touch of diacetyl add considerable complxity to the aroma. Superlative in all aspects of hops-- bitterness is high but clean, and the hop flavor and aroma is wonderfully assertive. Although the hops hit hard, there is considerable malt complexity & sweetness that contends well w/ the hop profile, but, alas malt does lose in the end. Bigfoot finishes with hop bitterness and a bit of residual sweetness on the tongue, plus mellow alcohol warmth in the throat. Just delicious & intense. There is a wonderful bittersweet taste you get when you lick your lips after each sip.

140,2671,cokes,4.27,"2003. I'm a little less keen on Sasquatch this year. Nevertheless, this is a quintessential BW in terms of price and availability.  Condensed notes: Chocolate and caramel dipped toasted pumpernickel bread covered in pine (or should I say PINE PINE PINE) needles and salt. The saltiness is what catches me here. Good heft. Alcohol is noticed but nearly flavorless, as it blends its gin-like bitterness with the masking hops. Good stuff still.  2002 Since last year, I have been convinced that Bigfoot and Sierra Nevada are overrated. Things began to change recently when I had their stout (again) and realized I liked it. Perhaps my crusade against SN was flawed?? Bigfoot was a must buy in order to figure out where I stand on this matter. As I said, I hadn't been too excited about it in the past (not that I DIDN'T like it previously, I just thought it was overly praised). Well, keep the praise coming for the 2002 batch. Nostril- and taste bud-exploding goodness. Pine and citrus and all sorts of other flavors prancing about widely both in the aroma and in the mouth. The malt keeps things in check, but not too strickly, there is alot of room for the flavor and alcohol content to fool around. That is what makes this beer so tantalizing: there is so much going on in it. That sound you hear is me jumping on the SN (and Bigfoot) bandwagon. It will be fun to see how this batch ages (if I can keep my hands off them for long enough). rating 2002: 4.7",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,ColForbin,5,"2002 Vintage (reviewed 2/25/02): Can I give a beer five 5.0s? If any beer deserves it it is Bigfoot. The hops are all over this beer, but it has the malt and alcohol content to balance it out. I believe Sierra Nevada was the first brewery to realize that a strong beer didn't have to be sweet (i.e. most Belgians). If you've been turned off by the sweetness of most high-alcohol beers, Bigfoot is for you. A true American classic.  2004 Vintage (reviewed 3/1/04):The 2004 vintage of Bigfoot pours with a thick creamy, hoppy, head, reaching the top of an imperial pint glass. It fades to an inch-thick head with a lot of staying power. The beer is a deep ruby red. The nose is full of piney, floral hops. Taste is full of oily hops, with a thick body presumably from malt, but I can't taste a bit of it. Maybe a brief malt hint in the aftertaste underneath a boatload of hop bitterness. Scarily drinkable. I'm yet again reminded why I consider this my favorite beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

It poured dark reddish gold with a dense, creamy white head, which I find unusual for a barleywine. The aroma spoke of a hopheads dream exploding with Cascades and grapefruit. To try and balance this beer must have been a daunting task but Sierra Nevada succeeded in my mind. Toasted malt, apricot, some toffee sweetness over the aforementioned hops and then the alcohol kick. Superb.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Viking,4.85,"Beautiful beer with a reddish-amber body and full, creamy lace-bearing head. Major hops in flavor and aroma (seems to be a 'trademark' of Sierra Nevada). Nice malty flavor evident within the hops. Exactly what I crave in a barleywine! Taste of alcohol is also evident under the hops and malt.  This is the first year I've been able to find Bigfoot, and I finally understand why everyone eagerly awaits the release of this beer each winter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,Thrasher,4.32,"Beautiful winey amber color, exactly how I imagine a barleywine should look. Very hoppy as you may have guessed. I have to say it is actually too abrasive fresh out of the bottle; the hops are overwhelming and the flavors are unbalanced. I can't wait to try it again after I shelf it for a while. Unmistakable trademark Sierra Nevada flavor (read: hops). I didn't have any goblets so I poured it into a brandy snifter - I would suggest not just dumping it in a pint glass. It mellows nicely in the glass. There is something really interesting going on hidden under the hops but it is indistinct at this point. Withholding full judgement until it matures. Buy it now though, it goes quickly. (11 weeks later: Ohh, it's good. I'm kicking the smell up to 5. The smell is AMAZING!)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,BKotch,4.19,"I just drank my last 1999 Bigfoot at Christmas, 2001. I am surprised by the similarity of the fresh 2002 batch. Almost three years of cellaring gave the '99 version a softer, rounded flavor that far outshined my recollection of it when fresh. The 2002 is practically there at the outset while displaying better carbonation. A beautiful clear dark amber with really tiny bubbles rising almost champagne-like, a nice light tan head that leaves a gob of lace all the way down the glass, a vague maltiness up front that pops through the incredibly ever-present citrus-tinged hoppiness, and a medium-to-heavy oily body. One of the best Bigfoot batches in years.  1999 bottling: As I just wrote in my review of the new 2002 Bigfoot batch, I had my last '99 Bigfoot at Christmas, 2001. Very impressive. The cellaring gave the flavor a softness and rounded-ness that more than offset the slight loss of carbonation and head. I've read that the hops flavor is the first to go when one cellars beer, but you couldn't tell that from this brew. Wow!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

The first sip causes your taste buds to stand upright out of sheer hop shock, but they soon catch on and realize that they're experiencing one of the true pleasures of life. Once that happens (about half-way through the glass), you can really focus on the complexities: a slight malty sweetness, the alcohol (not overpowering, but definitely there), the lingering pine and citrus. It's terrific now; it'll be out of this world after it ages a bit.  2001 bottling: Something magical has happened over the last couple months. My 2001 has aged and mellowed perfectly. The trademark hoppiness is still there, but is now balanced by just a hint of sweetness (like caramelized fruit). Outstanding. Unfortunately, I have only one left, so I can only hope my 2002's age as well (and I exhibit a bit more patience than I did with the 2001's). I marvel at Sierra Nevada's craftsmanship.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92

Sure it has great caramel maltiness to it, if you can find it behind all of those hops. The sheer hop bitter edge is too high at this point but that should age out fairly soon. If you are the kind of hophead that liked the Stone fifth anniversary IPA or sucking on hop cones then enjoy this beer now. For the rest of us, give it about 4 months and this beer will make any beer lover snap to attention and solute the SN banner. I love it, it is just too too green for me at this point.  2001 bottling: Ok I give it this high of rateing with one caveat, and that is it has to age. I my opinion it is the best Bigfoot in the last 4 or 5 years. Sure the hops were too agrressive when it first came out and maybe they still are but it has enough malt going on this year that it will age out to perfection. Another 4 months and I will crack anotherone open. It has the potential to be a truely GREAT beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
140,2671,BeerAdvocate,4.3,"Presentation: 12oz short brown twist cap bottle, with a mountain landscape and some looney hick pulling a donkey. 1998 Vintage.  Appearance: Dark-red amber, with an off-white sticky head.  Smell: Loads of hop aroma (loads), and a strong alcohol vapor that is almost perfume like.  Taste: Rich, ripe and fruity. The extreme hop bitterness and high malt sweetness blend together nicely, providing a well balanced barleywine. A pronounced hop flavour strikes with every sip, and lingers to the point where you can taste the raw hop leaf.  Notes: A deceivingly powerful brew, that is sure to sneak up on you during a session. At 9.6%(abv) and roughly $11 a six-pack this is by far, one of SN's best brews. Find it, buy it and savour it with respectful sips.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Barleywine,92
