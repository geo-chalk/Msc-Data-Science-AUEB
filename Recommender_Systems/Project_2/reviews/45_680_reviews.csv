45,680,MikeB_from_Macomb,2.46,I didn’t taste much chocolate. Quite bitter. Disappointing.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Shiredave,4.15,"I've been enjoying BBCS for over 20 years, presented and promoted it for over a decade, offered it in numerous beer tasting events on tap, fresh and in vintage bottles. But this is my 1st review here. It's changed over the years, as will this one if stored properly. New brown swirly label I don't care for - the classy image of the white on black is missing. The pour results in a tall, dark tan head of sticky foam with good persistence and specks of lace over a jet black liquid. The aroma is big and sweet but not bold or overwhelming. Strong treacle and molasses notes mix with bakers chocolate dripped over warm oatmeal, with a splash of tequila. The flavor is busy - sharp black grain and long boil hop bitterness stab the tongue up front right along with the caramel malt sweetness that adds depth and complexity. Softer hints of drunken cherries and berries, figs and rye bread all blend with the charred grain and sweet toffee stoutness. Body is BIG and alcohol doesn't hide well even in the deep, warm stout flavors. The finish is long and bitter, grassy hops, wet leather and black coffee. Still a winner but in a boring new package/label.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mmpm13140,4.3,Walking through my local Wegmans looking for a new Imperial Stout to try. I remember reading the reviews about this one so I thought I’d pick it up. I’m glad i did. Pours dark with a tan head. Very delicious and even better the closer it gets to room temperature. Definitely putting a few of these away to see what aging does to it.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,BitteNochEinWeissbier,4.29,"12 oz bottle Bottled On: Winter 2019 Consumed on: 26 Dec, 2022 Glass: Tulip Snifter ABV: 10% Serving Temp: room temp   Look: Black with a 23-finger high creamy dark tan to light brown head. The head dissipates slowly, leaving very good lacing.  Smell: Dark roasted malts with a touch of char. Rich semisweet dark chocolate mixed with some milk chocolate notes. A touch of vanilla.  Taste: All the aromas are here and dialed up a notch. A black licorice or anise note joins the party about mid-sip. This is followed by light smokey notes and a light touch of char and ash. Some molasses even sneaks in and perhaps a hint of a dark fruit. A mild bitterness then arrives and helps to change the chocolate to a bittersweet variety. The sip finishes lightly bitter, a tad dry, malty, and lighltly chocolatey.  Feel: Creamy, silky and viscous. Warmth from the alcohol can be felt. The body is medium.  Overall: A very nice Russian Imperial Stout. Great aromas. Great flavors. Enjoyable and easy to drink. I don't detect much bitterness, which must be from the 3 years that I had this beer in the cellar.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MrOH,4.24,"One of those beers that I've drank so many times over the years that I'm surprised I haven't reviewed it. 2022 vintage. Pours black with a brown head, good retention and lacing Smoke, roast, chocolate, and dark fruit aroma. Burnt caramel, dark chocolate, and dried fruit. Heavy bodied, but dry. Lower carbonation. The one of the few imperial stouts you can rely on being there every year and not changing. FWIW, I once had a 14yo one that had been stored in a fridge and it tasted like ruby port and cocoa.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BMBCLT,3.61,"Dear reviewers,  !!! THIS BEER DOES NOT CONTAIN CHOCOLATE !!!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MattinHouston,4.7,"This one is perfect for the colder weather. The smell is actually like a heavy chocolate cream liqueur. The feel is dense but like drinking the same liqueur custard, but thin enough to sip, with decent carbonation. Well done. Glad I picked it up, surprising at 10% ABV. If you like Russian Imperial Stouts this one will leave you happy.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,1BrewBacca,3.84,Pours black as midnight with a new moon with a brown head and sticky foam lace on the glass. Simi-sweet but the chocolate is somewhat overpowering. Feels seltzer like. Glad I tried it but I'll be looking for something else the next time I go beer shopping.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,EnderFett11,3.77,"Poured gently from a bottle into a snifter glass forming a finger of brown head that eventually faded to some lacing. Dark brown color, pretty much opaque. The smell is roasty barley and some dark fruit. The taste is pretty much roasted and a bit bitter barley, just a hint of dark fruit. Definitely a imperial Russian stout, but basically no chocolate flavor. Feels a bit like false advertising. Light to medium bodied with moderately high carbonation. Fine for an imperial Russian stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DrOfGolf,4.14,"The smell is fantastic with hops, caramel, and chocolate. The taste is of vanilla and chocolate, and hops. The 10% ABV really comes alive. I like it a lot and hope that I can get some more.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Blogjackets,4.34,"Poured from a twelve ounce bottle, the body is dark black with a nice fluffy tan head. Rey good lacing throughout the tasting. A good looking beer in glass.  Aroma has notes of chocolate, malty char and a light sweetness reminiscent of espresso.  Taste follows nose but adds a good hop bite. The featuring of bitter malt flavor is a welcome change from many modern pastry takes on big stouts.  Mouthfeel is good, perhaps a tick lighter than expected. However the taste more than compensates. Carbonation is solid.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MadMadMike,4.34,"2022 vint, tap hit into a snifter. Looks great - deep dark, brownish foam. Smells divine. Big baker’s chocolate notes, vanilla, aromatics. Taste is full on. A chocolate confection in a glass. Mid-mouth sits a fine hop character. Post-swallow reveals a light bitterness and a fine not-quite-too-sweet finish. Alcohol well hidden, but present. Missing is the anise note of a RIS, there’s an aromatic that is present, but can’t place it. Feel is classic RIS, medium carbonation from the keg, I suspect. Overall, an xlnt winter warmer, I hope to find it in bottles.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,NorsemanOne,4.24,"Winter 2018 12oz bottle from Cellar Trade  Pours a thick deep black with a soft tan head Strong boozy and chocolate nose Rich chocolate flavor Soft, thick, and silky smooth.  Awesome trade!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jbolger,4.43,"8/10/22 Really nice Russian Imperial Stout. Perfectly balanced between chocolate, coffee, malt. Sweet but not cloying. Better than Ten Fidy? This could be the one.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Iamaskier,4.15,"Happy to try an east coast classic. Smell is sweet, lots of vanilla, some maple syrup, a bit of coffee, and a slight bourbon character. Taste follows- sweet and rich. Toasted malt dominates. Caramel, marshmallow, some piney hoppiness, bitter dark chocolate, and nutty coffee on the finish. Smooth drinking, and I can taste the alcohol. It lives up.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bitterbeer,4.75,"A stout to cherish: strong, bitter, excellent chocolate without usual sweetness — wish it was a regular year long.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,burnstar,4.41,"Pours black with a nice tan head with some lacing on the surface throughout. Smell is roasted malt with some chocolate notes. The beer delivers on its black chocolate promise but without becoming cloying or gimmicky. The first few sips have a big spicy alcohol hit before it settles in and you get used to it. Nicely balanced between bitterness from the roasted malt, some underlying sweetness, with that black chocolate note throughout. Heavy and boozy although it's tasty enough to have a couple.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jackflaps,4.11,"Winter 2019 series.  L: Very dark, tan head that fades quickly. S: Boozy at first, before the chocolate comes in. Some roastiness too. T: Lots of chocolate, some roasty malt, a little anise maybe? F: Very smooth. Gets better as it warms up. O: Underrated, somehow? The chocolate is very understated but it's a good balance of flavors and a pleasure whenever I get around to having one.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DDiFran,4.75,"This beer is as close to perfection as it gets. Outstanding look, smell, taste and mouthfeel. L: Opaque with a light brown head that leaves a lot of lace S: roasted coffee licorice and chocolate T: same F: plush One of the best Russian imperial stouts",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Peach63,4.34,"Ebony with a 1/4"" tan head, which dissipates. Light lacing.  Aroma is coffee, chocolate, roast malt.  Taste is coffee, dark chocolate, roast malt, licorice. Acidic.  Full body, light carbonation. Dry, astringent finish.  Outstanding! This is one Imp Stout to tyry before you die.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,lastmango,4.43,"Poured black with a fizzy dark tan head that dissipated quickly to a thin film. Light lacing. Nose of light molasses, malt and dark chocolate. Initial taste of sweet malt and then an explosion of flavor from burnt toast, dark chocolate, oak and bitter black licorice lingering on the finish. This is a huge taste bomb with various layers. The high ABV is somewhat hidden. Moderate-light body with fine carbonation. Slightly slick with a lingering stickiness on the lips. Although I expected a slightly thicker brew, the overall feel is quite good. Sip this slowly and roll it around on the tongue to get the best experience. I would definitely buy this again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BeerAndGasMasks,4.09,"Again, after many years, I try this brew. From the bottle, it pours a stygian dark black color with a nice light brown head that reduces and leaves lacing. Roasted and burnt malts in the nose. The mouth follows the nose, with some bitter chocolate as well.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,maxarvo,4.06,"Crisp, bitter, wouldn’t guess 10%, unlike many stouts at this level which ooze alcohol as well as adjuncts- none of those in this, relatively mild taste of chocolate and bitterness, coffee etc. very drinkable, for a rich 10% imperial stout. Really great, good for winter.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,PathofChaos,4.54,"Appearance: A full, two fingers of creamed froth the color of burnished beige that laces in slippery webs. This voluptuous head retains only a few moments before being swallowed up by the glossy blackness below.  Bouquet: Smoked barley and charred baker’s chocolate are engulfed in a tremendous whirlpool of dark malts. As it airs, the barley and malts take a backseat as tremendous dark chocolate emerges from its charry cocoon, bold and unmitigated.  Feel: The very definition of a stout: dense and full-bodied. Carbonation shows restraint, content with becoming lost in a warm, boozy, woodsmoke linger.  Taste: Copious quantities of scrumptious, bitter black chocolate, subsumed by an avalanche of booze-drenched dark grains and black bread suffused with charcoal smoke.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,skisonic,4.13,"Its an almost oozing thick dark ale on the border of jet black, with a warmly tinted head. Dank notes of prominent tannins, vanilla, oak, and of course chocolate. Smooth. Surprisingly light-bodied. A maltiness and a dark chocolate bitterness, I honestly forgot it was a 10% but it doesn't surprise me. Still a great offering.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,LesDewitt4beer,4.34,"12 ounce bottles dated DEC 2018. I bought it/drank OCT 2019. Pours jet black, thin toffee head. First: quick black ale w/dark bitter cocoa pow. Second: raisins prunes and dates, booze, all dipped in bittersweet hop chocolate. Third: booze, light smoke notes. Hops and bitter cocoa go for miles- at least 01:45. Long lingering bitter darkness. It is excellent in every way.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,NiceTaps,4.24,"On tap in a 10 ounce stout snifter glass.  Pours opaque pitch black color. The cap is dense dark tan, 1f, lots or dripping lacing.  Aromas of Belgian dark chocolate and cocoa powder. A note of vanilla as it warms.  Dark roasted malt and 85% cocoa dark chocolate flavors.  Full bodied with intense dark chocolate bitterness. The 10.1% abv does not hide itself.  Pretty much a straight up malt stout that develops a chocolate flavor. Very good.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,CTHomer,4.45,"A: opaque; very dark brown - almost black; less than a 1 finger medium brown head that receded to a thick, finely pored collar; very little lacing;  S: Ovaltine;  T: deeply roasted grain for a moment, then Ovaltine; moderately bitter finish;  M: full bodied; moderate carbonation; dry finish;  O: really, really good - don't know what else to say;",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,nick_perry,3.93,"Minimal head which is slightly tan in color. Moderate chocolate aroma. Certainly feels like a true stout, with strong malt flavors and a slightly bitter finish. Very smooth, with a good amount of carbonation. 10% ABV makes it a bit boozy. Not as much chocolate taste as I’d like, though.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,rapayn01,4.07,"My youngest daughter, who is much more of a beer drinker than her older sister, gave me one of these in a mix 6er at Christmas. She lives in NYC and it was a mix of local beers. This stout had very nice chocolate flavors and excellent mouthfeel, but it's very boozy. I think my abv cap is closer to 7.5, but it was interesting to try and it was a great gift.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,LeBron_James,4.37,"2020 edition. Pours black with small tan head, left no lacing and faded fast. Smells really inviting. Nice dark chocolate with tons of roasted notes and some light vanilla sweetness. Taste follows the nose. This is an awesome flavour profile. Dark chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, caramel, some coffee on the back, and 0 alcohol so this one’s a bit dangerous. The mouthfeel is sadly kind of thin. Not super full bodied like what I expected for a big stout but it doesn’t ruin the experience. Carbonation is light and the finish is smooth and dry.  Overall, this is a really cool beer and I’m glad I got to try it. It’s balanced very well.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Parmesan,4.32,"L:. Pours a dark black with a small tan head and no lacing on the glass.  S:. Sweet dark chocolate, a hint of vanilla, some smoke and ash, a touch of caramel and tobacco.  T:. Sweet dark chocolate, roasted malt, a nice touch of vanilla, and it finishes with a nice long lingering smokey roasted bitterness. Really like the taste of this.  F:. Smooth silky body, little lighter than expected.  O:. It's nice to have a normal imperial stout without all the crazy stuff in it, and this one is fantastic.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BergBeer,4.41,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass  Look: Opaque black with a rich mocha colored head  Smell: Rich bitter sweet chocolate, burnt toast, and vanilla.  Taste: Big blast of semisweet chocolate, rye bread, vanilla, and oak up front. Then a body of cold brew coffee and chocolate.  Feel: Thick and coating. Covers the palate. Big bitterness. Medium alcohol. Smooth carbonation.  Overall: A great example of the style and one tasty brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mike22ne,4.43,"Poured from a bottle, 2020 edition. I've had this many times years ago, but not recently - and only realized now that I've never reviewed it! A blizzard is currently rolling in to Boston so this sounds like a perfect time to sit and sip.  Looks good, a silky thick pour with near-black brown color and a fine brown head that fades quickly. Minimal-to-no lacing. Smell and taste are big and full of roasted malts. Black coffee, bitter dark chocolate, and burnt caramel, with a slightly metallic earthy quality. Prominent bitterness lies under the layers of flavor. Feels medium-full bodied, with a depth of flavors but not overwhelmingly sticky. Bittersweet and dry finish. No perception of alcohol heat, only as it warms me afterward.  Overall fantastic. To me, this is the ""quintessential"" American (Russian) Imperial Stout. All-grain brewed, no actual chocolate or other adjuncts in the recipe",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jockstrappy,4.29,"Pours solid black with a creamy 1” tan head, sticky lacing. Aromas noted are chocolate with roasted malt and coffee. Taste is chocolate with a mild caramel sweetness up front. Mild coffee like bitterness from the roasted malts, hop profile is faint. Mild alcohol warmth detected. Finish leans the sweet over the bitter, a little sticky on the palate. Heavier body with a smooth and creamy mouth feel.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,reknirdsuomynona,4.32,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass  A - Almost pure black. About as close as you can get with a beer. Small brown head about one finger thick appears with a vigorous pour. It quickly disappates to a patchy coat on the surface that lingers.  S - Sweet chocolate up front. Very little else. A faint hint of the dark roasted malt on the back end. No hops to be found. Simple and straightforward.  T - Sweet chocolate and roasted malts. Finishes dry and malty. As with the aroma, simple and straightforward. No real complexity, but not everything needs to be complex. Everything here is well balanced and well executed. The chocolate might be too sweet to get through the whole bottle without high alcohol content slightly numbing the tastebuds while sipping. Another well considered facet.  M - Probably the only weak point of this beer. It feels too thin. The carbonation is a little too, IDK the best word here, maybe delicate? for the gravity. It just doesn't feel quite like a stout. No where near ruined, but it's the only real blemish here.  Overall, a really good Imperial Stout with a little bit extra. Everything is done by the book and done well. Will gladly enjoy the other 5 bottles over the winter.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,NYNorseman,4.54,"Solid beer! This is a terrific stout that is pretty widely available. I remember a great afternoon drinking these brews at Totonno’s Pizzeria in Brooklyn before a Cyclone’s game. This beer is rich, malty, chocolatey and has aged pretty well in my cellar. This is a 2019 vintage and is pretty tasty. This is an affordable classic. Give it a shot!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,dano213,4.48,"Winter 2020 Vintage 12oz bottle purchased off the shelf as part of a mix-a-six pack. Looks like a Julian date of 2960, which perhaps corresponds to a bottling date of 10/24/2020. Drinking this somewhere in between cellar temp and room temp.  Look: Pours a very dark brown almost black color. No light getting through, that's for sure. Looks like it has a thick body to it. A very nice brown colored head with tiny bubbles adhering in a small layer along the sides of the snifter.  Smell: The aroma on this russian imperial stout is what you would expect - dark roasted malts, coffee, pleasant dark cocoa aroma, and just a bit of acidity. I am getting secondary notes of dark fruits like stewed black cherries and plums, nice sweet almond marzipan and creamy vanilla aromas also. A bit of spice comes through also. I got some metallic notes too, but I think that they blew off eventually. Overall, the aromas aren't super expressive but definitely present and accessible. I've heard other people describe previous vintages of this beer to smell like chocolate cake and I totally agree with that.  Taste: Wow, this is very nice. Not quite what I expected, and very enjoyable. Up front, it's hard to describe the flavors. Lots of generic roastiness without much sweetness. Some fruity and nutty notes up front as well. On the finish, there are lots of chocolate and coffee flavors. Huge robust baker's chocolate notes with some pleasant dryness and bitterness. The bitterness doesn't taste like it is coming from hops, rather it seems like is coming from the unsweetened chocolate flavors that are coming from the roasted malts. It's very complex and interesting and I find that after sipping it and savoring it, there is even more to appreciate. There is a tinge of acidity on the back end as well. It's almost an afterthought because it doesn't even cross your mind - the 10.0% ABV is completely undetected.  Feel: This RIS has some nice chewiness to it and the carbonation is moderate, really spot on for this type of beer. Mouthfeel is just a bit thin.  Overall: This is a solid russian imperial stout. It is delicious now and I think that cellaring for a year or a few years would only enhance and help develop and round out the flavors. I think that this beer would be really enjoyable to pair with rich cheeses (think brie or blue cheese for example) or dark chocolates.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jdubbs13,4,"2012 bottle date - nose is dark chocolate; smooth and delicate to start on the body. The chocolate grows as it warms in the mouth. Silky, malt follows as does some light coffee roast on to the finish. Sweetness is moderate for an overall good stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JMT1,3.79,Nice stout for the price. Not the quality of Founders or Bell’s but 1/2 the price it’s enticing.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,blazerkor,4.41,"The smell is like the name a dark chocolate dominant stout. Bitter sweetness and roasty malts come in after the cocoa heavy chocolate.  It tastes like a dark chocolate malt with very little sweetness.  The mouthfeel is foamy, full and silky smooth. The finish is dry and bitter, the bitterness lingers for a while.  Overall this is a phenomenal straight forward imperial stout. Hardly an alcoholic taste absolutely was not aged in anything wooden because it is just a stout. I give it a 5.2 out of 6.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,RumDude,4.22,"Look: Richly dark body. Dark tan head with decent longevity. Thick pour.  Aroma: Rich traditional balance of black/dark malts with a hint of chocolate/ stonefruit.  Taste: Nicely balanced continuation of the aroma with just enough alcohol flavor to let you know its the real thing.  Feel: Pleasant enough but would be better if a bit thicker. It’s on the light side of moderate/medium.  Overall: A solid performer and a bit better (2020) than in other years. As a comparison, it is not as complex as Founders Breakfast Stout but richer with a slightly better feel. Definitely worth $2.50 per bottle.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,klarcbarr3,4.03,"An aggressive pour into a pint glass provides a 2 inch head and a perfect fill to the top. The head lasts several minutes, and enough remains to provide some pleasant, tawny lacing to the end. An earthy, robust smell of coffee and modest chocolate greets you. The taste is strong, a bit raw.. boozy, good, and not subtle. It is every bit an Imperial Russian Stout, a tad more chocolatey than many. I drink it with a touch of nostalgia.. In the seventies and eighties, I had progressed through the endless sameness of American lagers, skunky European imports, pilsners and fruity summer ales, concluding by the nineties that Sam Ale and Pete Wicked were the beer zenith.. but on a hot summer night, two quick Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout draft imperial pints, to parch my thirst, shook my world. I now buzzedly knew more existed.. and my quest for beer perfection continues to this day. I fondly remember Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout as the beer that opened my eyes and inspired my thirst.

Healthy enough but not healthy enough to survive an rigorous hike at 83, yes, an hike we've all done many times ... the review?  Looks like stout, huge aroma and flavor, char, chocolate, coffee, roast, bitter, everything an RIS needs to be great. This year's rendition seems better than recent years.

Aging does nothing for this beer. Pinky sized head, mediocre all around. Drink fresh!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,titty_mcbitty,3.94,"I think this is an Oct 2018 bottle, but the date is smeared. Anyway, it pours black with almost a finger's worth of khaki head. Mostly small bubbles appear, and the foam dissipates pretty quickly.  I don't get too much on the smell, other than a faint milk chocolate or some kind of turned milk aroma.  The taste is pretty good. Up front is bitter dark chocolate and malt. Maybe a roasted nuttiness is there as well. Hops come through. There's something like a dark Belgian thing going on in the background.  Consistency is very good! Not thin and not crazy thick. It's oily and some of the bitter flavors linger on the palate for a while.  Overall this is a great beer for the money, and a good beer in spite of the price point. What impressed me most was the feel of the beer - it wasn't thin at all, which I love. I also liked the bitter chocolate flavor that Brooklyn pulled off. No wonder this has been such a staple for them.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BJB13,4.03,"12 oz. bottle poured into a nonic style pint glass.  Pouring dark brown and thick it is near black and opaque in the glass. A conservative pour yields two fingers of rocky light brown foam leaving slick lace and oily residue on the glass. The nose is subtle, featuring notes of light roast, caramel and a ghostly whiff of cocoa. A flavor profile starting with a balance of semi-sweet chocolate and floral hops with alcohol moves to a slightly bitter aftertaste. The body is full and soft with medium carbonation and a little warmth. A straight forward solid offering in my humble opinion.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,rudiecantfail,4.18,"12 ounce bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass.  L---As dark a brown as exists. Huge, brown, soapy head faded slowly and left impressive lacing.  S---Aroma of high percentage dark chocolate, more bitter chocolate, not sweet. A touch of vanilla is present along with a hefty amount of alcohol which is not unexpected at its double digit ABV.  T---Dark chocolate, as advertised is up front. In the background is some vanilla and coffee.  F---Lighter than expected for the high ABV. It's still medium-full bodied and surprisingly well carbonated.  O---An excellent offering by Brooklyn Brewery. I'm actually going to go back to where I picked up this single and get a few more.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,stevoj,4.36,"12 oz bottle from Beer Peddlers. Black pour, small beige head, settles quickly. Aroma is bitter roast malts, dark chocolate, small hit of coffee.

45,680,Whyteboar,4.77,"For a Non BA Imperial Stout, this stuff is amazing. For my palate at least, the level of hops is excellent, lower than most RISs but still present to cut the cloying taste of all the malts in here.

45,680,DavetotheB,4.4,"From a 12oz bottle dated ""Winter 2019"" into a pint glass. Pours pitch black with about 3 fingers of brown head, the result of a violent pour. The head dissipates around the edges of the glass leaving a tower of foam in the middle. Good lacing. Smell is a little more muted than what I expected-picking up chocolate milk, coffee and a little alcohol. Taste is magnificent-like roasted chocolate with some coffee in the background. Slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth, smooth, smooth. Beers of this abv should be drank a little more slowly, but this one is hard to put down.

For some reason, this beer seemed to vary quite a bit from one swallow to the next. At times it seemed like a standard Russian Imperial Stout. At other times it was very cocoa forward. At first I was impressed, but the longer I drank it, my opinion dropped. The beer came to seem harsh and unbalanced, with a metallic Tang. At first I liked it a lot, but then I wound up not finishing it. Very odd.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Looks Just as one would expect an Imperial Stout to look dark black with a thick brown head that both lasts and laces. Aroma Powerful malt and chocolate Taste Also malt and chocolate, 6 different malts are used and there is NO added chocolate. the tastes changes as it rolls across your tongue bitter, sweet, milky dry. Not a lot of hops in the taste, Feel Full and thick Finish slightly dry and lasting Overall Brooklyn BCS is the 1st Imperial Stout I ever tasted. I must have had at least 50 other ones by now but it is still my favorite and one of my 5 top beers, This bottle was fresh the Winter 2019 bottling. I've had it aged up to 5 years.

Really dark chocolate. Strong malt. The 10% ABV is very present.  A little on the thin side with smooth fine bubbles. Makes for easy drinking.  This is made for pairing. Like the bottle says, good for drinking with cheese, dessert, or in front of a roiling fireplace. This would work with a dessert that is perhaps on the sweet side or a cheese that could hold its own against it. It is singularly focused as being a contrast and a counterpoint. By itself, you can feel it needs something. If you have a nice hearty aged Gouda, this would be a good pick.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TooManyGlasses,4.27,"2016 vintage. Many times in past and always great. Pours a rich thick black with a short lived deep tan head. Aroma is initially notably boozy - espresso notes and dark chocolate with hint of sweetness. Taste is a very pleasantly boozy rich chocolate with a bit of balancing espresso bitterness. Nicely carbonated for the ABV with great thick mouthfeel and boozy heat.  July 2,2020 Same 2016 vintage - a bit thinner and some evident oxidation but less boozy still chocolate but with some sherry notes. Still great.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Aroma is quite elusive and subdued. Primarily notes of milk chocolate, prominent roasted malts, grounded coffee beans, and burnt caramel. Other notes of vanilla, licorice, toffee, dark fruits, and bourbon barrel.  Alcohol can be tasted easily. Taste isn't too bitter, although it remains in the aftertaste.

45,680,SierraNevallagash,4.27,"I have had the 2018 vintage before, which was remarkable, but this review will be of the 2017 Winter Release.  2017 Vintage 12oz bottle (aged a year and a half) - poured into a wine stem at 55F.  Pours a seriously deep, dark mahogany color - thick - sitting jet black in the glass, with zero light penetration. A thin finger of mocha colored foam sits atop, slowly receding to a thick cap, leaving behind very little lacing, but coating the glass with the beer.  Nose: At first, the nose is rather subdued, consisting primarily of milk chocolate, sweet, moderately roasted malt, and the faintest hint of fresh ground coffee. As it opens up, vanilla becomes apparent, along with lesser notes of burned caramel, molasses, and a hint of dark fruits. The faintest whisper of floral hops. Zero alcohol fumes for 10% ABV. Some time in a bourbon barrel would work magical wonders on this. Note: This 2017 bottle seems to have softened quite a bit from the 2018 bottle, lacking the rich dark fruit character, and vibrancy of the 2018.  Palate: Moderately roasted malt leads to flavors of dark chocolate, roasty barley malt, malt sweetness, toffee, vanilla, and as it begins to warm and open up, the dark fruit notes become more evident. Dried cherries, raisins, figs, plum, and even a touch of milk chocolate-covered dried strawberries. It's satisfyingly sweet, in a very natural malty way, never approaching cloying or overbearing. Mid palate, it shifts away from the sweetness, bringing vanilla, dark chocolate, and the impression of oak to the forefront, before leaving everything behind, and finishing with cacao nib, and a slightly tannic charry roasted dryness. Not bitter, but dry, clean, and slightly roasty. Note: The 2018 bottle was a bit fuller, and brighter, with a slightly more all around richness to it.  Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is mild to moderately thick, slightly viscous, with a good amount of heft and body. Just a touch sticky. Effervescence is low, fine, and fuzzy, and very appropriate for the style and over a year of bottle maturation. Feels like a good 10% imperial stout should. Perhaps just a touch on the thinner side, but by no means ""thin"". Note: The 2018 bottle had a slightly thicker, fuller, more viscous mouthfeel to it, though with roughly the same effervescence.  Overall: I've had this once before, but as a 2018 vintage. If my memory serves me right, the 2018 was bolder, both on the nose and on the palate. It was sweeter, and had more vibrant flavor, particularly those dark fruit notes that I love so much in a big stout. The age seems to have mellowed this one out a bit, subduing the overall character, subduing the roasty bitterness, and rounding everything out a bit, bringing forth more of the vanilla and malted barley character. Nevertheless, regardless of the vintage, this is an excellent imperial stout, and the price of this makes it a true gem. $2.50/12oz in my neck of the woods. This stands toe-to-toe with any non-barrel-aged imperial stout I've had, and for the cost, I will choose it any time. Zero glaring flaws, and a nice traditional European style RIS in a world of over-hopped American stouts. This is a must try, and a great starting point for anyone looking to get into big stouts, while not breaking the bank, and still experiencing outstanding quality.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,jrc1093,3.77,"Winter 2018 bottling  Pours a light black with no translucence and a fluffy cap of caramel-colored foam; nice retention on the head with some sparse walls and stringy patterns of thicker lacing left around the glass.  Aromas of dark cacao nibs and roasty malts dominate; lighter hints of caramel, toffee, and milk chocolate influence the bouquet smoothly in the background.  Taste of dark chocolate and toasted granola upfront, with lighter tones of dark berries/stone fruits, smooth malty roast, and a faint milk chocolate imparting the slightest sweetness toward the finish; bits of booze are somewhat prevalent on the latter part of the profile.  Mouthfeel shows a nice medium body, slightly sticky, and with lower levels of carbonation with an occasional odd spike; hints of booze come through on occasion, but not enough to become a consistent distraction; a well incorporated package of sweet, dry, and roasty.  Integration of dark chocolate really evens out the expected stone fruit and dark berry tones, striking a nice balance where plenty of lighter (mainly sweeter) notes are given space to shine through. I do think this didn’t quite reach the next level, though, as the profile was muddied in spots, and the mouthfeel suffered from the occasional thinness and inconsistency. Overall a really solid brew that does shine in its approachable flavor and drinkability.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,HoppingMadMonk,3.83,"A solid offering from Brooklyn. Aroma was mostly coffee followed by roasted malt and chocolate. Taste was bitter black coffee upfront followed by bitter dark chocolate.

Color was dark impenetrable brown with a sizable tan head that stuck around for a while. Smell was increasingly chocolatey as it warmed up with a charred malt base. Taste mirrored the smell with minimum alcohol presence. Mouthfeel was fine.

Appearance- a deep black in the body, but a little clearing at the bottom and the head, similar to cola; head is merely a thin mocha ring around the edge and lacing is absent. Smell- dark chocolate, brownie batter and dark roasted coffee! Taste - dark roasted, malty coffee is most profound in the flavor profile, with hints of soy sauce and the dark chocolate making a brief cameo! Feel - definitely a sipper, but a fairly easy one at that; smooth with some dark chocolate and coffee bitterness! Overall- all in all this is great, it just lacks the character to stand amongst the best in the category; a very good RIS that I would certainly recommend if you haven’t tried!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Chocolate predominates, as one would expect, but the malt and hops come through subtly afterwards. Feel: Very nice body to this beer. Not too ""thick"" feeling as some stouts are.

The nose hits hard with robust charred malts, rich, sweet, almost artificial chocolateyness, a touch of smoke, and a bite that further suggests healthy hopping. The flavor is potent with roasty malts and char, dark and bitter chocolate, and some appreciable piney hop resin. The alcohol seems to enhance the bitterness doled out by both the malt and the hops, but itself remains hidden. The body is nicely thick and mouth-coating, and the carbonation is fine and lively without becoming bubbly and fizzy. Wow, what a great beer just sitting around. It brought the potency, it brought big, deep, rich flavor, it brought chocolate but didn't overdo it, and even managed to squeeze in some hops for the ride.

With a 10% abv, this beer could get me in serious trouble. I will definitely be back for more of these.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jjamadorphd,3.86,"Definitely a solid chocolate stout...  I've had some success with these Brooklyn offerings and this stout turns out to be no different. As advertised, the damn thing is black, maybe even blacker than black. When I poured it into a Guinness glass, it even looked like a Guinness - black liquid, dark tan foam, and some good staying power. The smell was an even mix of booze and chocolate, but that did not translate to the taste. Try as I might, all I could really pull out was the boozy character of the beer - I liked it, but I was expecting something more balanced. Mouthfeel, after it warmed, was slightly creamy and a tad smooth, but first out of the bottle it was quite carbonated. I liked liked this one and would certainly reach for it again during this ""cold"" FLA winters...",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MrRB,3.4,"I can't say that I really enjoyed this beer. Near black body with brown foam. The nose is moderately intense and exhibits mostly roasted malt with hazelnut and some faint dark chocolate. The taste is rather dry and savory – little chocolate to speak of. A distinct note of soy lingers on the palate, leading to a slightly astringent finish. A bit austere and one-dimensional.

45,680,tbrax34,4.53,"Loved it in 2015. The 2016 version tasted boozier to me and I didn’t enjoy it as much, though it was still very damn good. It’s a winter must have; one of the few reasons to look forward to the cold.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,alexanderplatz,4.02,"A: Pours dark brown, opaque. Tan head fades to lacing. S: Like the flavor, well balanced between chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. Hint of booziness. T: Well balanced between roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee. A hint of sweetness but not as sweet nor as chocolatey as Founders Breakfast Stout. Mild bitterness at finish tastes like baker's chocolate. F: Medium body. O: A well made stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Herringii,3.76,"Look- Dark and soupy in nature. Smell- Dark roasty. Chocolately and a bit of alcohol. Taste- Dark chocolate and a bit fruity. Like the smell there’s a bit of alcohol.

45,680,jkblr,4.18,"12oz bottled 38 days ago poured into a snifter at fridge temp 10% ABV. The beer pours dense very dark brown with no light penetration. The head is light brown and slow to settle leaving behind significant lacing. The aroma is roasted malt, chocolate and coffee with no one dominant. The taste is smooth dark malt with dark chocolate undertones. The second half of the taste is roasty bitterness with a slight booze presence. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and somewhat dry. Overall, great imperial stout. I love the balance and the fact that I enjoy this fresh instead of having to age several years like some other RIS. Recommended.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,HenryPorter7777,4.11,"Let me begin by stating the obvious: this IS a good beer. Pours a dark chocolate with a 1/4”-1/2” tan head and a light lacing. Medium to light carbonation. Definitely an Imperial Stout. Russian Imperial Stout. This beer only gets better as it warms. Chocolate? Think sweet, bitter, and all the variables. Layered. Balanced. Alcohol is all there, but not overwhelming. Excellent with cheeses or charcuterie. Think Fall/Winter weather setting. I could not possibly drink more than one in a sitting: or could I ??? I could. 10.0 % ABV Note: did I underrate this beer?",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,Shade1951,4.18,"THIS is an Imperial Stout! Very flavorful and strong - but not harsh. Whatever hops there are are subdued. I keep saying it and will continue to say it: An Imperial Stout should NOT be a hop bomb. I wish certain breweries would take note.  I love the motor oil black color. Aroma is pleasant... coffee, leather, dark chocolate - but not overpowering. The flavor is very good, rather similar to the aroma. It is also sufficiently carbonated, unlike certain stouts that taste flat, seemingly by design.  A fine stout that I won't hesitate to get again. Now, if only Brooklyn would bring back their Monster barleywine....",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,dustin22martin,4.28,"Pours black as night, with a dark tan head that lingers for a minute. Has a rich smell of roasty espresso and alcohol, which the taste confirms, but once the (not unpleasant) alcohol taste goes you are left with the amazing flavor of rich dark chocolate that lingers on and on in the most satisfying way. It's like taking a bite out of a dark chocolate bar. So good.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,coldseamonster,4.69,"I reviewed this beer years ago. But like every beer it changes over time. It's not fall yet but I drink stouts year round. It's not just a cold weather beer for me. Look is jet black luscious viscous oil. Hold it to a light , the light is barely seen if at all. Smell is espresso and dark chocolate malt. Taste is toasted espresso with chocolate in backround. The high abv is masked by a dark toasted malt that would have you believe that chocolate bean was brewed with this but it's not. Continues to be the best east coast imperial style stout IMO.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,woodychandler,4.34,"OMFG! How is it possible that a) I have NEVER previously reviewed this beer & b) it will be my 4,400th on this site?!? I remember sharing a then-vintage bottle with Garrett Oliver & FerMentor Lew Bryson at the State College Beer Expo in 2000(?)/2001(?). I LOVE Brooklyn Brewery & I have visited many times over. I am flabbergasted that I have not reviewed this beer until now.  From the bottle: ""This is the famous Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. Descended from the Russian Imperial Stouts of 18th Century, our Black Chocolate Stout has itself become a modern classic, heralded the world over. A blend of six malts produces its dark chocolate aroma and flavor. There is nothing better to enjoy with rich desserts, fine cheeses, and roaring fireplaces.""; ""The Legendary Russian Imperial Stout"".  Today is T, 20 June 2017.  Winter 2016: I Pop!ped the cap & commenced a slow, gentle pour into an awaiting glass. Once decanted, a vigorous in-glass swirl raised a finger of dense, deep-tan/light-brown head with moderate retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose smelled less like chocolate candy and more like fudge brownies. It was very rich and chocolaty, but also with a breadiness from the malt. Mouthfeel was big and full, like a scoop or dollop on my tongue. I let it lay there & rolled it around to better get a sense of its flavors. Interestingly, it not only had the rich chocolaty fudginess that I noted on the nose, but it also tasted of cherries, raisins, tobacco & charcoal smoke. Phew! Another no-playin'-around beer. Finish was dry, not sweet at all, with lingering cherry-chocolate flavors, like a torte.  Next, on W, 21 June 2017:  ""Limited Bottling - Winter '14 - '15"": I Pop!ped the cap & performed a very gentle pour. The in-glass swirl raised a brief finger of foamy, deep-tan/light-brown head with modest retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose was really rich with a fudgy, chocolaty, brownie-like quality, underlain by a light smokiness and a malty breadiness. Mouthfeel was somewhat lighter than in the more recent batch. It was not as thick or chewy, but it was still bigger than simply ""medium-bodied"". The taste was MUCH more chocolaty without any of the fruity flavors noted earlier. It was like a rich, fudgy brownie at this point, almost a dessert beer, although a smokiness kept it in check. Finish was dry which I might have thought unexpected had I not noted such in the fresher batch.  ""Limited Bottling - Winter '12 - '13""; ""In the last century, British brewers made strong stouts for the Czar's Court. They were called Imperial Stouts. Our Black Chocolate Stout, brewed once yearly for the winter season, achieves a chocolate aroma and flavor through the artful blending of six varieties of black, chocolate and roasted malts.""  Having Pop!ped the cap & conducted a gentle pour, the in-glass swirl raised a brief finger of foamy, dark-tan/light-brown head with modest retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose had begun to take on a pronounced smokiness, more roasty than chocolaty. Mouthfeel continued to moderate, becoming less thick & chewy with each older iteration. The taste was more like raw baker's chocolate now, nary a hint of sweetness, but with a smoky, charcoal bitterness. Finish was quite dry at this point.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Lone_Freighter,4.5,"It poured a pitch black leaving the same color body. A one inch foamy yet level dark tan head appeared and lasted for a good two minutes before dieing into the body of my nonic. Some nice foamy and clingy lacing appeared in rings. The smell had dark chocolate up front coming forth in a roasty sort of way. Some coffee notes presented themselves as the beer warmed. The taste was sweet and bitter in different aspects at different times as the chocolate comes and goes and the coffee comes and goes. The palate was about a medium with a nice smoothness coating the mouth and tongue. I’d say the drinkability isn’t that high, but hey for a RIS, this should be more of a sipper anyways as it shows with a fairly high ABV. Overall, this was a nice winter sipper that I would gladly come back to.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,RandyCongdon,4.62,"Saw it and had to try it.  Look- Dark cola brown, almost black. The head is dark tan and very thin. Not what I would call true lacing, just a slight syrupy residue that settles after a moment and is gone.  Smell - An above review mentioned soy sauce, and I think that fits. Just a hint of chocolate.  Taste- Chocolate, a bit of smoke and then the alcohol in good balance. Not too bitter. Just a tIny bit sweet.  Feel- Light/medium body . Swallow is very smooth. Aftertaste is that of slightly chalky, mildly bitter cocoa.  Overall- I generally prefer my Stouts dry, and this one pleased me. The little bit of sweetness was what this one needed. I recommend it as a nightcap, because the alcohol hits you fast. I would buy it again. Generally, I like to suggest food pairings in my reviews, but this beer probably is best unaccompanied. It is also better at room temperature.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Aroma is a mix of blueberries/strawberries/blackberries/raspberries - and some dark chocolate. Taste is nutty/berry/dark chocolatey dream. Feel is light, silky and smooth. There are some slight boozey notes in both the taste and aroma Overall, I've found that aging this beer definitely brings out its finer qualities. Aged for a year.. and you get more of the dark chocolate profile. Aged for two years and you get the fruitier profile. Definitely age a 4 pack and see what happens. Interesting to see what another year or two will do, although that might be pushing it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,opierce,3.59,"I'm trying to like imperial stouts and this one is better than Old Rasputin. I think generally don't like stouts unless they have some other extra taste, such as the Dragon's Milk with the bourbon and vanilla flavors. The chocolate came through on this one but the roast/burnt flavor still dominated too much for me. The mouthfeel was a little thin as well for my tastes.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The first thing you taste is dark chocolate, and lots of it. In between layers of the chocolate, you find tones of coffee and licorice. Long finish with quite a bit of roasted malt.  Soft liquid, just the right amount of carbonation. Mayve a little bit thin.  Overall, a good stout, at a price that is hard to beat. My only gripe is that is's a little bit too thin.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Flachs,4.65,At first I didn't buy this as I don't like coffee. The coffee is so far back in the taste I didn't mind it. I could taste the chocolate right off. The burning and warming feelings was great.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,hoptheology,4.07,"Beautiful pour, yielding a black chocolate color and a slightly reddish beige head. Head forms 1 finger and gradually recedes to a ring of lace.  Notes of roast malts, peppery coffee, chocolate, and cocoa.  Alcohol is apparent right from the get-go. It's a pleasant burning flavor without acridity or astringency. Lovely notes of chocolate and roast malts dance on and around the palate. Some tight licorice snap on the finish. As it warms up a few degrees the alcohol presence does become a touch astringent. Still, it's one of the better tasting Russian Imperial Stouts I've had.  Feel is pretty roasty as well, with hot, boozy alcohol dryness and burn. A dry, dry finish.  Overall the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is a solid performer. It's got all the chocolate and roast notes, with only a hint of unfavorable astringency.

45,680,BethanyB,4.14,"Look: The deepest of mahoganies, with a long lasting, half finger of evenly distributed tan-colored cream on top.  Smell: A hefty, diverse array of dark fruit rises above the malt, which depicts the usual roasted mocha notes along with some malted milk. A smattering of allspice puts me in a holiday mood. In all, both promising and unexpected.  Taste: Akin to the aroma, the roastiness is at the bottom of this lasagna. It lasts well into the finish, however, lingering longer than the more upfront flavors. Chocolate soft serve ice cream is made heftier with a coat of cinammon and rich dark cherry and plum flavors. Some spicy hops and a taste of vanilla yogurt bring some balancing brightness to the complex, yet round configuration. Very well done!  Mouthfeel: Medium-high carbonation is on the front of each sip, but artfully melts into a smooth finish. Medium-bodied. It might benefit from some more heft, but the lightness of such a heavy hitter in terms of ABV in particular, is impressive. The high ABV is extra hidden in that no obvious alcohol warming comes through.  Overall: I may be a Brooklyn resident, but Brooklyn Brewery's beers are hit or miss for me. This one hits hard: Its unique and thoughtful recipe goes above and beyond your typical chocolate stout with its powerful helpings of fruit and spice. The details are finely tuned, but the big picture makes a solid impact. Disappointed that I bought a single bottle, as I'd love to have another right now!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

On the taste I mostly get a dry bitter dark chocolate with a good amount of dark malt. The roast really doesn't come through until the finish where it finishes bitter with a very nice warming. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than I'd like, but it's still thick enough to coat the mouth.

45,680,taxandbeerguy,4.24,"12oz bottle served just above fridge temperature and served into a tulip. Purchased while visiting the US.  Appearance - pours almost the darkest of dark blacks with a small half finger of tam head on top. Good head retention and the color eradicates light. Small cap of tan foam lingers for a good duration on top.  Smell - dark chocolate and some surprisingly cherry aroma too to add some complexity. Some mild earthiness with just a hint of vanilla and coffee on the nose, but sweetish on the nose with dark chocolate and cherry being the stars.  Taste - loads of dark chocolate, a prevalent but restrained bitterness. Some mild sweetness with a brief cherry intermission before a fine coffee ground flavor shines through as well. Complex with multiple levels of flavor there's even a coffee, vanilla and caramel troika to close. Yum. Enough other flavors to make me think this is an American stout as opposed to a Russian imperial stout.  Mouthfeel - smooth with a heavy but slick body, creamy feel and adequate carbonation. Just right for the style.  Overall - while Brooklyn's Dark Chocolate stout is not quite the pinnacle of the style, it is a delicious, flavourful stout loaded with dark chocolate and cherries that is certainly worth any beer advocates time. Highly recommended for this top notch brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

On the palate very minimal carbonation with a rich creamy mouthfeel with the flavor of coffee and dark chocolate with deep roasted malt and fruity back notes of plum and raisin. Bitter on the front end which gave way to a subtle but discernible sweet finish which became more prominent as the beer warmed while drinking. the high ABV does not come across as boozy but does make you take notice.

The smell comes off a little boozy with lots of bready? flavor coming through no chocolate that I can detect though.

Stays on the tongue forever then eases into a long slightly sweeter finish. You breathe out the dark malt. M: Silky smooth yet sticky for flavors. O: More intense and noticeably better after a few years, but maybe pushing it a little with oxidation. A really delicious and alkaline stout; a nice departure from the sugar bombs nowadays. Pairs predictably well with artisan flavored chocolates.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,LAp,4.09,"An excellent imperial stout that embraces its chocolate notes most fully.

Smell: Dark chocolate, baking cocoa, dark roast coffee, caramel, vanilla, burnt toast, and soy sauce.  Taste: More sweet than bitter, but balances nicely on the finish. You get toffee, caramel, milk chocolate, and dark roast coffee upfront. Toasted bread and a touch of butterscotch in the middle. Finishes with dates, figs, tobacco, black licorice, bitter cacao, and more coffee.  Feel: The lighter side of full-bodied, but feels silky and velvety in the mouth. Lightly carbonated.

45,680,crisis1290,4.5,"A very good friend of mine gave me a few bottles of the Brooklyn Black Chocolate as a gift. The date on this bottle said:"" LIMITED BOTTLING WINTER 11-12"". It really can't get any better. A nice solid stout aged 4 years . When the bottle was popped open for a special occasion, I was in heaven !!! A nice black thin pour . Super smooth ! A semi-sweet chocolate with coffee and malt in the background like taste. The taste almost changes with each sip. I am bummed out my glass is almost empty, but I have a few more in the basement ! I put this offering from Brooklyn right up there with Old Rasputin as two of the better Imperial Stouts for sure !!!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,rodbeermunch,3.86,"Black, oily appearance with minimal head in the range of 1/5"", beige. Aroma was chocolate, sticky, and some bourbon barrel.  Taste hit up lots of chocolate impressions coming from the malt moreso than an adjunct usage. Finished chalky and dry.  A good beer, but there are plenty of other options for spending $20 for a barrel aged stout, but its nice that this one usually sits on shelves.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,tekstr1der,4.35,"Very solid offering, this pours black with a thin, but persistent and clingy top of brown head. Aroma is not overwhelmingly chocolate, but it's there among vanilla, roast, and slight booze. Flavor follows the nose well, and that's a good thing. Nice notes of dark cocoa, some sweetness in the middle, and a somewhat dry, slightly bitter finish. Will definitely have this again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Harrison8,4.1,"Pours black with a medium-thin foamy desert tan head. Fair retention. No lacing left behind. Roasted malts, chocolate, and alcohol on the nose.

45,680,ccg,3.92,"It looks like a barrel-aged stout. Minimal head, thick legs, nice lacing. Smells malty and boozy. It delivers on the chocolate. It's pretty cool that they can make that flavor only with the malt. Nice sweetness without being cloying. Finish is bit on the hoppy and bitter side. Despite not having much visible carbonation, it feels light on the tongue. Overall: Good stout!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Mousel,4.29,This beer changes with every sip. As it aerates it's flavour varies from a chocolaty finish to a more alcoholic taste. A beautiful drink that I will continue to purchase and try over time,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Very good chocolate stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Beginner2,4.2,"We got a great beer here. Listed in the ""1001"", I read that review that this recipe got Garrett Oliver his job at Brooklyn. (He had been working in a brewpub in Manhattan.) And beer history took a very big step. Unlike many of the others in this category, Brooklyn's contribution uses no cocoa... but tastes like chocolate. You have to know lots about malts and, apparently in 1994, Garrett Oliver knew lots more than just about everyone.  I bought a 4 pack... which I no longer regret. Two years later, I just drank the last one now and it was worth holding as it clearly had improved... less edge, more smooth.  Reviewed in Roger Protz' "" 300 Beers To Try Before You Die!"" MJ's 1999 edition gave this 3.5 stars of 4 and called it ""the world's answer to a waring malted milk with a shot of bourbon. It achieves an astonishing black-chocolate flavour through malt alone""  2/5/17 had the vintage bottled two years ago. All the tastes are there, but not at peak. My next tasting of this will be at 18 months.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,deleted_user_971432,3.67,"Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout %10 ABV. 51 IBU's? I had this out at a Freezepop(electro, synth pop)music show in a 12 ounce pilsner style glass. Look: blackout, letting no light through at all. smell: Not much smell, a small amount of roasty, bready smell, some chocolate taste: sweet chocolate, coffee, roasty biterness. It was a bit too bitter for me and a kind of gluey aftertaste that I find in breakfast style stouts. Feel: a tad heavier, but pretty o.k. for an imperial American stout. Overall: The beer was not even close to what I am looking for in a stout. That weird aftertaste of glue and too charred and roasty for my tastes. I mean it didn't reach ash tray levels of burnt taste, but it wasn't very likeable for me. It wasn't absolutely horrible, just not great and not my thing. The one thing that I noticed was that it hides the alcohol taste very well. In that department they were good. I didn't know the ABV level before I bought the beer and only found out afterwards. I was quite surprised. I haven't normally liked Brooklyn Brewery in the past, but I figured I would give them another shot. Oh well.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Zebulan,3.91,5 month old 12 oz bottle poured into generic belgian glass. I really like this beer. The pour is nice and dark and the brown head goes away fairly quickly. The sweet smell is not over powering. The taste is thin in the mouth but still full of the chocolate flavor. The positive flavor lingers for a bit as well. Is warm going down without being painfully hot. This is a very sold example of a sweet chocolate stout. Will get this again.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,brblanch,3.95,"12 oz bottle poured into Dogfish Head pint glass. Color is jet black with 1 finger khaki head that slowly dissipates and leaves moderate lacing.

Enjoyable beer overall, especially as ""dessert"" after a satisfying meal.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Shanex,4.06,"I had this one for noon and this wasn't necessarily a bright idea, might earn me an afternoon nap.

45,680,SanWrencho,4.94,"Truly one of the most delicious beers I have of this style.

Smell: Rich dark chocolate, caramel, powdered sugar, and very faint alcohol.  Feel: Thick, chewy body, but very smooth with some nice carbonation.

45,680,Wer34truh,4.06,"Poured into a snifter. Features a clear black color, with a small dirty-brown head which dissipates quickly. Quite a bit of lacing for a Russian Imperial Stout.  Smells of chocolate, caramel-sweetness, biscuits, and general smoked flavors.  A distinct bitter coffee-flavor dominates the taste. The roasted element comes through well in the initial taste, but ends up playing second fiddle to the coffee. I didn't get that much chocolate until the aftertaste, which has a distinct dark chocolate flavor that lingers for a delightfully long amount of time.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MNAle,3.43,"Some sort of screwy yellow code stamped on the bottle in very crude dot-matrix format - impossible to read. Grrrrr. Very dark, black, opaque. 1 inch tan, creamy, bubbly head that recedes slowly. Aroma is sweet, smoaky, chocolate. Moderately thick feel. Taste follows the aroma: sweet, roasty, bitter chocolate. Transitions from the opening taste through a sweet middle. The finish is bitter. Not boozy despite the high ABV. I can see how this would be highly rated by some, but somehow the sweet roasty fighting the bitter chololate does not work well for me. It is more like a ""versus"" than it is a balance. I enjoyed this beer as it stands, but it won't likely be a repeat purchase.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Buck89,4.06,"Poured into a snifter. Opaque black color accompanied with a 1.5 finger tan head that left quickly but left some nice tracks behind. The smell is semi-sweet chocolate, roasted malt, and dark bread. Rich chocolate taste with some coffee and roasted malt. A nice chocolate finish. Not a viscous as Ten Fidy, but full-bodied with a nice feel - perhaps a touch too thin. The alcohol is hidden well with a nice warming on the finish.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,Gajo74,4.21,"Pours a pitch black color, thumbnail length dark tan head which dissipates to a thin ringlike lace. This one is all about the chocolate. In the aroma I instantly detect dark bitter sweet chocolate. There is also coffee, roasted malt and a hint of wood. Towards the end, you smell the alcohol. The taste is initially creamy sweet on the tongue, then, bitter dark chocolate, espresso, bitterness from hops, nutty. The finish is dry and the raw cacao bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. The alcohol warmth, front he high ABV, is there, however, it is by no means boozy. Full bodied, rich, robust and viscous. It could be considered a sipper, but it is smooth enough that I felt that I drank it fast. This might be arguably my favorite thus far from Brooklyn Brewery. It is complex and slightly intense, yet, a fairly drinkable stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Taste: Dark chocolate, malt, cream/coffee.  Feel: Dense. Like drinking a slightly thin milkshake. The alcohol is present but only really felt if you hold it in your mouth. Sticks around too.  Overall: This beer is a smash hit for me.

Overall: A ""big"" beer that's exceedingly well done. Arguably the most enjoyable imperial I've had.

45,680,OldManMetal,3.98,"This winter stout pours to a thin, brief-lived sticky-looking creamy brown head on a nigh-impenetrable black body with slight orange highlights; lacing consists of the scantiest of ladders and dots. The nose leads with a surprisingly white toasted bread note, which vanishes to reveal a moderately-expressed dark maltiness: dominant chocolate notes sweetened by lesser amounts of molasses and dark, dark toffee, with very perceptible alcohol notes riding atop everything. On the palate, the toffee notes play a much stronger role than on the nose, obscuring the chocolate up front, then finding a synergistic balance with the chocolate by mid-palate, producing a slightly-sweet, beer-defining candy bar flavor. The finish is boozy and toffee-like, followed by a mild, moderately-roasted coffee bitterness that lingers for a few minutes. The mouthfeel is in keeping with the full body, and the texture is very creamy, peppery from the strong carbonation and quite warming from the alcohol.

Pours a burnt chestnut mahogany and is completely black in the glass with a creamy khaki colored head of tightly packed, tiny bubbles. Great smell, lots of bittersweet chocolate, cocoa, fudge, dark fruits but with a faint tartness, something like blackberries and dark grape, charred caramel, vanilla, and rich malt. Great creamy, full mouth feel, no alcohol bite, goes down like silk. The bittersweet chocolate follows through strongly in the flavor, dark roasted coffee, vinous notes, licorice, molasses sweetness.

There's alcohol in here too, but it's not super evident. Roasted malt long into the finish.  F- smooth with some carbonation. Quite full, but short of syrupy. Just about right.

Overall - purchased the beer of a recommendation, overall it has lived up to the recommendation.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TomMorris,4.12,"This is pretty easily my favorite offering from the Brooklyn Brewery. Lovely aromas of dark chocolate and lightly coffee coalesce into a remarkably balanced and rich taste with a creamy, velvety mouthfeel. I wouldn't call this an exciting Russian Imperial Stout by any means, but it's an excellent and balanced example of the style and might be the easiest to drink of any RIS I've had. Along with Northcoast's Old Rasputin, this would be an excellent introduction of the style.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,K-Dog,4.46,I think this is last year's release bottle says winter 14 and 15. Saw a Couple single bottles on the self for 2 bucks each. The smell was amazing chocolate and vanilla. Even though it's not a bourbon stout I did sense a bourbon flavor but was also very hoppy at the same time. This was fantastic at an unbelievable price. Will purchase more of this in the late fall and defiantly age a few for several years.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,Kurmaraja,4.19,"Pours with a few inches of nice mocha head. Dark brown appearance, edgeing towards blackness. Nose is chocolate, dark malts, some dark fruit, a bit of dried cherry. Taste follows, a subtle cherry flavor that isn't sourness so much as a back note to the chocolate. Not a ton of complexity or depth, but delicious. Body has a hershey syrup thickness to it. Really well done.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,do_ob,4.28,"No bottle date. 12 oz. bottle into a Madtree snifter. Pours an incredibly dark brown - nearly black. Needless to say, pitch black in the glass. A gentle pour yielded a thin lacing of tan-colored foam. I'd imagine a slightly more aggressive pour could've produced a thicker head, but with a 12 oz. glass capaicty, it was pretty much impossible. Faint, yet plesant notes of rich, dark chocolate and roasted malt on the nose. A slight coffee scent is present as well. I got a bit of vanilla and marshmellow as it warmed. Heavy weight with a creamy & smooth mouthfeel. Just about perfect for a big stout. Maybe slightly over-carbonated for my liking, but hey. Huge roasted malt and bitter chocolate up front, wow. Very delicious. Increasing bitterness middleways. Sweetens out on the back end and sees notes of vanilla and cream. Bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt, followed by expresso on the aftertaste.  This beer really impressed me. I'd stack this up to Rasputin or Ten Fidy anyday.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,schoolboy,3.83,Last night I had a too sweet stout and tonight I'm having an even sweeter one.  It's black. It smells like sweet malt.  The taste is overly sweet. Any hops or bitterness is easy down in the profile. I wonder if it would be better really fresh.  The chocolate is also missing or over powered. This is not recommended unless you want sweet and nothing but sweet.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Mehinaman,4.75,"This was better than I had expected it to be. Truly excellent chocolate stout.

45,680,IKR,4.04,Serving Type: Growler  Appearance: Very dark brown bordering on black with a medium-sized dark beige head that gradually faded. A nice looking Imperial Stout.  Smell: Mild chocolate and mild roasted malt aromas. Not a bad nose but the nose is fairly mild.  Taste: The taste profile features moderate chocolate notes with some mild roast malt notes. The beer finishes with the semi-bitter chocolate notes . The beer has a very restrained alcohol presence.  Mouth-feel: On the heavy side of medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation.  Overall: A good non bal-aged Imperial Stout. Very nice bittersweet chocolate profile.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,allforbetterbeer,4.17,"Bought in Charleston during my honeymoon in June of 2010. I saved it at 53 degrees for this last 5 years to open after celebrating our 5 year anniversary. 12 oz bottle (label states 09-10 winter bottling) poured into a snifter on 07/08/2015. Knowing what I know now about aging beers, I would never have chosen a stout (except maybe Courage, but that wasn't made in 2010) to age for 5 years. Many imperial stouts can change in positive ways over 1-2 years, but very few can make it past 3-4 without developing off flavors that slowly erode anything positive about the flavor.  Pours black with no highlights, living up to its name. Pours with an impressive 2 fingers of coffee head. More than 5 years in the bottle and 10% alcohol and it still forms a head. Hopefully the flavor held up this well!  The aroma is subtle, with a hint of wet coffee grounds, bark, and a touch of alcohol sting. Not very inspiring.  The flavor is actually pretty impressive. Cherry-infused ultra dark chocolate shavings, salty chocolate sauce, burnt coffee, and darkly toasted bread crust come to mind. I was expecting much more of the meaty/salty grossness that shows up in stouts as they get too old (autolysis?) and was happy to find it is still restrained.  The mouthfeel is outstanding. Still carbonated, but heavy and thick. There is a little sweetness left and that helps a lot. Not dirty-water consistency like some older beers.  Conclusion: Knowing what I know now about the general principals of cellaring, I would have opened this when it was right about 3 years old, and judging by how it is now, I bet it would have been sublime. However, it is still pretty good. Not a bad way to celebrate 5 years of marriage!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,911CROFT,4.35,"355ml bottle into an oversized tulip. Paid £3.50 for a single bottle.  Pours an opaque, pitch-black body that is unchanged when held to the light. A one-finger in height, dense, tan coloured, bubbly head slowly reduces to a thin collar around the edge of the glass, leaving behind small amounts of fine lacing.  Rich, dark, roasted malts and fresh-ground espresso dominate the nose. Noticeable in the background are dark molasses, bitter chocolate and alcohol. Upfront the taste leads with full-bodied, heavily roasted barley, chocolate malt and dark roasted coffee characters. Bittersweet chocolate and a delicate touch of caramel and vanilla sweetness follow. In the mouth it feels luxuriously smooth and creamy. The thick, robust and slightly oily body is complemented perfectly by a low, appropriate amount of carbonation that prevents it from becoming too filling. Smooth chocolate and tangy dark fruit linger on the palate throughout the finish, balanced perfectly by a slightly dry, bitter cocoa bite and alcohol warmth.  Overall this is a fantastic beer. Superbly well balanced, well crafted and indulgent, this is a treat to be sipped and savoured! Recommended.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,SaltofOH,3.24,"Reviewed 3-13-15. Brandy Snifter. Bottle 2663 1333 (December 2013 release).  Appearance: Great smoke on popping the cap. Pours a deep black, totally opaque. Thin, tan cap fades to spotty islands of tan bubbles. Retains that tan skim down to the bottom of the glass.  Aroma: Sweet, fruity, some alcohol. Malt. Grapey, smoky.  Taste: Savory, meaty, salty, bitter, medicinal.  Mouthfeel: Heavy, slick, no carbonation.  Overall: A year old. What a year. This is so big, so bold, and slightly unpleasant. Sip slowly. Perhaps because the snow has melted, I am not feeling this; I love the aroma, and don't care for the taste.

Maltiness is more light bodied with a stronger black licorice taste. You can detect some dark chocolate smoothness. Hints of coffee at the end. Not much of a roasted taste, which I come to expect from Imperial stouts. A little too much licorice for my taste as well. It does hide the alcohol very well.

Smell: Coffee and yeast, fresh bread like smell.  Taste: Dark robust coffee, dark bitter chocolate, burnt malt undertones, some sweetness (that is thankfully fleeting), and then hops are present towards the end to complement the coffee and dark chocolate.  Overall: This is one of my favorite stouts. High ABV with a prefect pairing of chocolate and coffee. A lot of times these double stouts or high ABV stouts have a sickly sweet taste and aftertaste that prevails.

The taste follows the nose but there is also some caramel, molasses, and a touch of raisin and cherry. This stout is creamy, medium-bodied, moderately carbonated, and while not boozy you can feel the 10% ABV. It is also reasonably priced. This is probably the best value RIS I've ever had.

45,680,interzen,4.69,"355ml bottle into a chalice glass - bottle dated Winter '14-'15  Look: Blacker than a black thing in hell at night. But blacker. Not much in the way of head, and what was there dissipated fairly quickly. The net result looks like a glass of pure, distilled, well, blackness.  Smell: More than a hint of alcohol, which is not entirely surprising given that the ABV is in double figures, but at the same time there's an underlying chocolate maltiness with more than a hint of dark fruit. That said, initial whiffs of alcohol aside this isn't a big smelling beer. What's there is nice, though.  Taste: Reminds me more of a coffee stout (along the lines of the Bad Seed Espresso stout I had earlier in the evening) than a chocolate stout along the lines of Sam Smiths. Even so, the coffee and chocolate taste combine to give something reminiscent of very dark dark chocolate (think 90% cacao-type stuff)  Feel: Heavy, yet smooth - not surprising given the ABV, though. This is one for kicking back and sipping - there's a nice transition from the coffee and chocolate tastes up front to the malty, alcoholic burn of the finish. Really quite exquisite.  Overall: I think I have a new favourite stout - for me, this one ticks all the boxes although some might find it a bit too bitter and astringent. Me? I think it's fantastic - just a pity it's harder to get than my other favourite (Sam Smiths Imperial Stout).

A strange and out of place sourness mixes with the initial carbonation bite, dark bitter sweet chocolates and roasty malts fade in well into the development, but I can't get passed the funky sourness right at the beginning, has no place in a stout like this. O - The developmental Flavors and aftertaste are amazing, but this beer let me down and wasn't near the legendary stout I had hoped it was. The funky sourness at the beginning was a major turn off. Going to cellar my other three and see if aging helps. Otherwise, the beer is painfully average. V - So far, the value is pretty low.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Brutaltruth,4.19,"Enjoyed from a growler in a snifter, this rockin' Imperial Stout pours a thick dark black with a thick, very dense brown head. Nose of dark sweet chocolate, rich malts, and strong alcohol. Flavors are intense chocolate and coffee flavors, thick and coating, yet light and drinkable with a trademark smoothness. Moderate carbonation makes this one of the better winter Imperial Stouts out there. Finishes wet and chewy with a solid lightly bitter roasted malt quality with a light hops background.  OUTSTANDING!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,Beerando,3.71,"Uncharacteristic but good stout. Very nice dark color with a little more than a finger of mocha brown head. Has a citrus-y smell that blends into the taste. Besides a hint of citrus, there are coffee and chocolate hints as well. The feel is initially smooth going to low to moderate carbonation. Overall, a decent beer, just a bit confusing for a supposed chocolate stout. Maybe my pour? Will try again when I can.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,Barnoloid,4.26,"An outstanding RIS. Cracked open a bottle from 2012, was hot back upon release but has mellowed into an exceptional blend of chocolate and roasted notes.

45,680,m_hall,4.3,"Pour from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip... color is black and completely opaque, crowned by a thin tan head that left light lacing.  Aroma is fairly subtle, coffee, roasted malts, a faint trace of alcohol.  Flavor is rich and complex- the promised bittersweet cocoa notes are right up front. Moving in after are notes of toast and espresso and molasses, finishing with a slightly nutty dryness with slight herbal hop notes. All flavors are very balanced, with nothing being too dominant.  Mouthfeel is smooth and rich without being syrupy, and lightly carbonated. A pleasure to drink.  An excellent RIS overall. Not as challenging and distinctive as Oskar Blues Ten-FIDY, but definitely with a broader appeal. Perfect for wintertime.  VERTICAL TASTING NOTE- 11/23/18: Cannot find an exact bottling date, but this bottle is from the same Winter ""14-15"" bottling I reviewed above. Aroma seems to have deepened, with some vanilla and dark raisin-ish notes mingling with the cocoa and coffee. Flavors are even smoother than before, dark chocolate being a bit more apparent and coffee bitterness slightly rounded off and pushed to the very end of the finish. Any booziness from the alcohol has been effectively cloaked. Not noticing any oxidized 'wet cardboard' flavor. All in all, this one aged very nicely indeed.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,dmgeng,3.98,"Came up on a list of high rated beers and I knew that I needed to try this one.  A - Dark black color. Fluffy tan colored head with light lacing.  S - Strong roasty aroma with burnt characteristics and some dark cocoa. There is some alcohol and coffee tones after the roasted notes.  T - Very similar to the smell; much of the burnt roastiness at the front along with the coffee and some dark cocoa. The roasted bitterness is strong and predominant. It took me off guard since I was expecting more chocolate and not so much ""Black"". It's good but it seems that the roasted, burnt character is the primary flavor with some chocolate, coffee, and caramel afterwards. . M - Full mouth-feel. Medium carbonation. The roasted bitterness lingers on the palate but it does have the highest carbonation of a RIS that I've ever had so it attempts to balance the thickness.  Overall, this is a good imperial stout. I wouldn't seek this out again just because there are so many other more delicious RIS's out there. I know that someone else may prefer this take on the style more than a sweeter more caramel or coffee inspired beer but I do not. I would suggest you spend your money elsewhere like on an Old Rasputin or if you can find it a delicious Ten Fidy.

The smell is chocolate, (duh), burnt and sweet malts, coffee and some dried fruits.  The taste follows the nose; the chocolate hits first, followed by the burnt malt, then coffee, then sweet malt then finishing with chocolate. The chocolate is present in the taste from beginning to end. It goes down creamy smooth; sweet but there are just enough hops present on the back end to prevent it from being too sweet. There is also a warming effect, maybe just a little alcohol taste is leaking through; I can't tell for sure.

The cap of the beer never recedes and leaves a good amount of lacing that leaves rings down most of the glass.  S: Smell is mainly bittersweet chocolate, with roasted malts and a faint presence of alcohol. Caramel and vanilla start to come out as the beer warms. There is also a bit of a nutty aroma with some toasty/smokiness.  T: Big, robust flavors of dark chocolate and roasted malts with a touch of dry smokiness on the finish. Also caramel with a touch of brown sugar. No hint of hops or alcohol whatsoever.  M: Very smooth and slick on the palate with a full body and a low level of carbonation. Very drinkable for such a big beer, with alcohol masked very well for 10% ABV.  O: This is a solid, cheaply priced RIS that I look forward to every year. It isn't as outstanding as certain other imperial stouts, but it is a good beer that showcases the style well. Great aromas/flavors of bittersweet chocolate and roasted malts, and at $10 a 4 pack you can't go wrong. One of my favorite offerings from Brooklyn Brewery that never disappoints.

45,680,cjgiant,3.84,"Review is of one-year aged version, rating is on original tasting on tap of 2014: A: The 2013 pour is quite black, as I recall it from the origins taste. The head on this pour is minimal, but to the top. A swirl doesn't bring back much. Aged rating: 4.  S: the most distinguishable scent is licorice, but it's not necessarily the predominate scent. There is also a dark cherry or raspberry tartness, laced with alcohol, behind a lightly smokey and cola nose. It's actually kind of strange, and I don't get much chocolate, which I did recall getting in the original taste. Same rating.  T: an unsweetened chocolate comes through from underneath a woody beginning. A coffee bitterness also builds at this time. They all come together and the smoke from the smell makes an appearance. This whole flavor profile, as it plays out, is interesting. However, the whole time the tastes stay rather bitter. No rating change.  M: feel is a bit thinner than I'd like. The alcohol peaks through in some sips, but is mostly subdued. Carbonation is a tad flat. Aged rating: 3.5  O: I liked the fresher version better. I can't explain if the flatness changed the impression of flavors, or the flavors changed, but they are not what I recalled. Will need to re-try a fresh one and decide to really alter the ratings or not. Aged rating: 3.5.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Make sure you warm appropriately as this is where the goods are at with this beer. Even delicious slightly warm. And the roasted malts become more assertive as well. A fresh bottle will reward you with the nice coffee flavor others are talking about as well as some vanilla. I love that the coffee aromas in this particular beer are more on the smooth side for coffee aromas.  It should be reasonably priced wherever you are, as all BB beers are.

45,680,Roguer,3.78,"Nice dark brew, topped with a 1 finger dark tan head. Retention is so-so.  Surprising aroma, most strongly hinting at overripe dark fruit and roasted barley. Dark cacao and cream as it warms.  Flavor is pretty traditional RIS territory: dark, overripe fruit; red grapes; dark cacao; and waves of super roasty, slightly metallic-tinged barley, finishing with a bit of char. Definitely a nice chocolate component to this brew on the tongue, much more so than in the aroma.  Flavor improves dramatically as it warms, losing quite a bit of the fruit, and gaining a much smoother and more consistent chocolate profile. However, as a counterbalance, the high ABV comes out a bit more, as well.  Fairly long finish, strong with the very bitter roast, and tinged with slight chocolate sweetness. A little heat in the chest, but not in the mouth. Pretty thick and sticky brew. Lively with a little sting, but very little foaming.  This is a good stout, but I get way too much tartness and fruit for a chocolate stout.

45,680,doktorhops,4.14,"So lately I’ve begun seeking out Russian Imperial Stouts, I yearn for their bold chocolate/coffee notes, and Brooklyn’s Black Chocolate Stout is next on my hit list. Originally brewed in 1994 this Stout has taken home many beer show awards and I’m looking forward to a brew as great as that tasty old Russian monk: Old Rasputin (North Coast Brewing).  Poured from a 355ml bottle into Duvel tulip.  A: Looks exactly as it should with a jet black body and a light (but dense) mocha dusting for a head. So perfect I want to take a picture, get it framed, then take a picture of the picture next to another glass of this and admire its beauty again. 10/10.  S: Whiff of solvent alcohol upfront isn’t doing Brooklyn any favours - follow this with deep dark chocolate, notes of coffee, vanilla & molasses, and you’ll be bang on the RIS nose money. Bit of a mark down for that solvent hit though. 7/10.  T: Bold and delicious, now entering flavour country, population: Me (i.e. you when you drink this). Upfront dark bitter chocolate, hints again of coffee and molasses with brown sugar thrown in. There is a smoky mid palate and slightly bitter aftertaste. The alcohol is nowhere to be found in the flavour profile, which is a surprise given the aroma. Like a big dark chocolate brownie - sweet, bitter and moreish. 9/10.  M: Heavy bodied with a light but dense carbonation, exactly how I like my Russian Imperial Stouts! 10/10.  D: From that sniff of solvent alcohol to one of the best tasting Stouts out there, Brooklyn have managed a few surprises with this “drink of the Czars”. That said it comes close but falls short of the mark set by Founders Breakfast and Old Rasputin, and is more pricy than both of those fine brews... and more difficult to obtain here in Australialand. However if, like me, you have become slightly obsessed with Russian Imperial Stouts and have added: “Dying due to drinking too many Stouts” to your bucket list you should definitely give this one a go. 7/10.  Food match: Borderline dessert sweet - so it’s heavy roasted meats with dark gravies, after dinner cigars or dark chocolate brownies for this brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

(4.5) T: Sweet dark chocolate, dark roast coffee with cream, charred wood, dark caramel malt, and a hint of grainy hops in the background. With warming, a note of cinnamon emerges.

45,680,ThePaintedGrey,4.2,"12oz. bottle poured into imperial pint glass.  A: Tar black. I might have chalked this up to being absolute black, but the iPhone flashlight test reveals the faintest glimmer of garnet around the edges. It's absolutely opaque, however, with no amount of light able to pierce through it. A deep beige head is full and frothy, with excellent retention. This bad boy is here for the duration, leaving blankets of lace in its wake.  S: Lots of malt upfront, roasted black yet still offering some sweet aromas. The staple notes of coffee and dark chocolate are the frontrunners of the show, with the dark chocolate being the real star. Bitter, pure gourmet dark chocolate emanates ostentatiously from the glass. Not picking up anything in the hop department. That's okay with me in this instance.  T: Drinking this cold is blasphemy. I made that mistake. Right from the fridge, into the glass, and a sip not 30 seconds later revealed that this far too chilled and resulted in a boozy mess of flavor, like a chocolate bar soaked in vodka for hours. Off to the side it goes... Now we're back roughly 20 minutes later. At nearly room temperature, the show truly begins. The alcohol is still too pronounced for my liking, but the flavors have shown their true colors and the booze is easy to look past. The bittersweet dark chocolate runs the show once again. This is no chump's dark chocolate either. We're talking one of those 60% - 70% cocoa bars paired with a robust cup of morning brew, served black with one sugar. It's strangely a little bready in the finish along with some booze lingering on the tongue.  M: Full, creamy, and smooth. Does a great job of coating everything in the mouth. Borderline chewy, but never quite becomes that big. Not much to praise, but nothing that can really garner a complain. Just less than outstanding.  O: I am quite particular about my Russian Imperials. Due to being in my top 3 favorite styles, they have the potential to become one of my favorite brews. They also have the potential to be clunky, malty messes. Lucky for BBCS, it's not the latter. Unfortunately, it's not the former either. There's a LOT going on in this beer, but amongst the business some blunders arise. The booze isn't veiled as delicately as it could have been. Some of the coffee notes are reminiscent to burnt gas station coffee. With those complaints aside, BBCS truly is a wonderful RIS, but it simply straddles the line between good and great falling just at the border.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Although I found this drinkable it seemed to lack that kick in the ass character that the above named had that impressed me. The coffee & chocolate were distinct & enjoyable but the lack of body was distracting.

45,680,kevinlater,4.38,"12oz bottle into snifter. bottled on september 10, 2013. enjoyed on september 15, 2014  a: pitch black with two fingers of gorgeous tan head. with a bit of swirling, the head becomes a more darker brown which is kinda cool. this is a big stout alright  s: dark fruits, chocolate, roasted malt. coffee aroma is very slight  t: dark fruits up front, then a huge roasted malt and chocolate flavour explosion. it just tastes so... dark? which is delicious of course. very chocolatey and roasty all throughout. little alcohol presence. mild-to-moderate dryness at the end. superb  m: nearly-full and sticky mouthfeel, coats your mouth. little to no carbonation. excellent & very fitting for the style  o: not a complex stout, but it's very tasty and has a deep, lingering roasty character. i've had this beer closer to fresh in terms of age, and i remember the alcohol presence being a bit too much. one year of aging worked wonders. such a good stout at an unbeatable price. try it if you haven't already!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BaalDagon,4.5,An amazing beer... pure and simple. One of the better stouts I've had up to this point. I heartily encourage anyone who is a stout drinker to give this one a taste for themselves!,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Nightwing,4,"Poured from bottle. Very nice aroma of chocolate and coffee. Pours black with minimal head. Medium bitter taste.

45,680,Buschyfor3,4.35,"12oz bottle; 2011 vintage (note: review from my tasting notes from March 2012 – I don’t know why I never got around to posting this until now)  A: Nearly jet black, and pretty thick-looking pour; as near as makes no difference to opaque; a dark khaki head bubbles up at the start, peaking at about a finger’s width, but it is quick to fade into nothing more than a small collar of bubbles with an oil-slick sheen on the surface; coats the sides of the glass.  S: Dark roast and bittersweet dark chocolate come to the forefront; the overall impression is a distinct, mocha-like quality of premium coffee blended with sweeter chocolate hints; not overly sweet, as there is a nice balancing dose of roast bitterness that contributes some burnt and smoky notes; a touch boozy as the bottle warms – almost like a coffee-liqueur with a slight sting to the nostrils.  T: Dark chocolate rides high on the initial wave of flavor as the beer hits the palate – bittersweet chocolate, fudge and lighter hints of powdered cocoa keep things sweet at the first sip; then the bitterness gets turned up a notch as dark roasted coffee beans and burnt malts break through that initial sweetness to lend a balancing hand; then a boozy, dark fruit character begins to take hold – the alcohol quickly growing in warmth and presence as the glass warms to room temperature; the finish measures out a second dose of smooth dark chocolate alongside earthy/smoky char and a nutty coffee flavor to try to temper the alcohol burn; the aftertaste sustains long after each sip.  M: Full bodied; low carbonation; pleasantly thick, but not nearly as much as other imperial stouts I've had recently.  O: Quite a tasty RIS we have here. True, it’s not nearly as complex as other imperial stouts on the market, but Brooklyn does a fine job emphasizing its namesake bittersweet dark chocolate in the aroma and on the palate. A touch boozy, but that seems to be a recurring theme for the style, and at 10.00% ABV, the might of this one is felt. Drinkability would likely be improved with some age on the bottle to smooth over the edges of the boozy heat. Overall, a very nice stout, and very nicely priced too at just $8/4pk. Will enjoy this one again, that is for sure.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,WhiteHillsStore,3.98,"A nice stout that offers a lot. The appearance is a dark black with a coffee colored head. The smell is very sweet with lots of chocolate notes. The smell though is a bit more subtle with malt and more mellow flavors, before a semi sweet chocolate finishes off the taste. The mouthfeel is very nice, coating your cheeks. Overall very good.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,CalgaryFMC,4.13,"Poured from a 355 ml bottle into a snifter, winter 2013-2014 vintage. This one is indeed dark, pitch opaque black with nary a ray of light passing through, with a halo of dark brown foam rimming the glass but otherwise no real head to speak of. Aroma is equal parts roasted, sweet, and floral/fruity, which is unexpected and quite pleasing. Some wood char and dark roast coffee jump out initially, with the latter carrying over onto the palate, burnt toffee, chocolate-covered raisins, and bright floral hops at the end of a sniff, really appreciating this latter element. The taste is well-rounded and mellow despite the bevy of dark malts and roasted grains advertized on the label, the alcohol is almost perfectly concealed (particularly considering this is an imperial stout!) and the flavors are aforementioned dark but smooth instant coffee, toffee, pancake batter, raisin, and baker's cacao mixed with milk. Just the barest tinge of ash at first, although this effect does emerge over time. Finishes quite sweet and here's where one does get a slight hint of alcohol. This is quite thick on the palate but the beer somehow goes down as lighter than it is. Careful or the high ABV will sneak up on you. This beer has won numerous awards and I can see (taste) why. Nothing to criticize here although some may want an Imperial stout to translate as hotter and more aggressive. Truthfully, there is something to be said for such an artful and skilled approach as this.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BSDA,4.83,"This is what you're looking for if you are looking for a beer of this type. Greatly appreciated but only lasted for so long. Getting at least two cases at my local Specs. Great price, case price is around $7/ 4pk. Can't tell it is 10% ABV, hardly in the taste. Smell isn't strong like a coffee so it isn't noticeable from a distance. Drank two of the my first time and forgot it was like for other beers! Same thing goes with the much less-drinkable Blaecorn Unidragon from Clown Shoes. Highly recommended since I just discovered it in early January 2014, now it is indeed my favorite beer to date.

45,680,patre_tim,4.25,"A: Dark brown to black virtually opaque beer with a rusty brown foam on the top, with lighter tan notes also in the foam. Chocolate milk lacing.  S: Dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, Russian Imperial Stout all the way. Alcohol present, creamy, sweet, tar, black licorice, overall black and dark. Reminds me of Old Rasputin by North Coast.  T: Wow, it packs a punch. Loaded with flavor. I get all the dark chocolate, sweet notes tar notes, alcohol, black licorice, cocoa nibs. Its really umami, soy sauce, a saline quality there as well, and snow, or almost freezer burn. Slight sour, little bitter. Really complex.  M: Thick syrupy bready body, medium low fine bubbled carbonation.  O: Really enjoying this one which exceeded my expectations. Liking it a lot, comparable to Samuel Smith’s Imperial Stout and Old Rasputin Ale. Think I may like it equally to these. Will give it 9.3 out of 10.

45,680,HoppySeb,4.18,"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into KBS snifter, bottled in 2013. Bottle stored in cellar then briefly refrigerated prior to opening. Pours a beautiful jet black and forms a two inch foamy head that's beige in color. The head ultimately settles into a thin ring around the glass.  The nose is French roast coffee and milk chocolate, quite inviting. There's also a strong roasted malt aroma, followed by a spicy presence that hints of nutmeg. The taste is quite similar to its nose, bitter mocha, sweet molasses and roasted malt, fudge and spicy (chile ancho and nutmeg).  The mouthfeel of this beer is quite pleasant, almost no carbonation present which in my opinion helps savour the beer even better.  Overall - very excited to discover this beer, its quite enjoyable and hides the 10% ABV extremely well. Its sweet yet no overwhelmingly so and all of its flavors are well balanced.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,wrightst,5,"I left the marks high, because over the years this is one of my ""dimes""; a ten out of ten. A consistently perfect beer, and my only 10 in the RIS category. However, this year my crew and I think they changed the recipe. The hops are less balanced, and there is a slightly more pronounced bitterness to the beer. I'd mark it lower, but that's what happens when you tinker with perfection.  Still, this year a tan, lacy head, with chocolate and coffee in the nose and tongue. Strong alcohol without the burn. You really can't tell how high it is by taste alone. No flavors fighting for the front row. 55 IBU, give or take, balances well with the alcohol and the signature black and chocolate malts, and those hops don't drown out the roast. Again, balanced. I'd have made it a little sweeter, but then I don't win any prizes. Still trying to clone this one.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,MrWilliams,4.44,"If I'm reading the Julian Code right bottled on September 10th 2013. Poured into a goblet.  A 4.5 Rough pour created about two fingers of head, which came as a light brown, what I would think of as latte. Some lacing as the glass was swirled but didn't last long.  S 4.25 A bit over boozy but at 10% abv not unexpected. Slight hint of smoke and bread but chocolate and cherries dominated.  T 4.5 As the smell indicated black cherries and dark chocolate dominated but was not overdone. A bit of smoke but not as much as the smell would leave to believe. Very low bitterness with virtually no hop presence.  M 4.5 Quite thick, just what I would expect in an imperial stout, with slight carbonation and alcohol burn on the finish.  O 4.5 The 10% abv is hidden well throughout the glass, extremely smooth. I've had a few chocolate stouts and this one is by far the best of the lot.

The obvious chocolate in the smell, but it doesn't completely dominate, leaving room for dark fruit (berries, raisin, fig), roasted malts, burnt sugar and faint light coffee. Smells nice and rich. Starts pretty sweet, with lots of juicy plums, cherries and raisins covered in chocolate (a bit dark, but not too much). Burnt sugar, roasted (almost charred) malts and coffee keep the sweetness in check and start bittering things up, but not before some hints of vanilla, licorice and anise are felt. Hops don't have much to say, but the finish is dry, ashy and quite bitter. Full body, sticky, low carbonation. Booze isn't perfectly subtle, but doesn't bother. It all kinda reminds of Kahlua. Does bring in the ""chocolate"", really tasty. A great imperial stout, probably even better aged for some years.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,MIchelle,3.88,"This is a very interesting beer. Pours a beautiful deep mahogany brown, nearly black with a thick 1"" tan head. Visually this beer is amazing. It has a terrific toasty chocolate malt smell. First sip it was very intense and I was surprised at how many sips it took for me to kind of warm up to this one being a stout drinker. I didn't read the abv prior to purchasing as I purchased in a mix a six pack. I think the intense first few sips are due to the high abv. It may in fact be just a little to much, sort of throws the balance off for me in this brew. The chocolate doesn't come thru as much in the sipping of this, I taste more of a roasted coffee flavor. It's a good beer but it's not my favorite overall. Perhaps this beer is a bit to cold right now since it's just out of the fridge, maybe as it warms slightly other flavors will come out in this.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Being an Imperial Stout I wasn’t too concerned about the 4 years or so of age, but I did have to let it thoroughly warm up before I could appreciate it. It poured pitch black with a surprisingly decent khaki head. The aroma was of sweet deep dark fruits and semi-sweet chocolate that definitely leaned to the sweeter side over roasted notes. The taste was also heavy on the smooth dark fruits and chocolate. There was still a bitterness present on the finish but not as overbearing as I remember the fresh version. The Black Chocolate Stout unsurprisingly was still a full on chocolate assault but it had moved away from the bitter chocolate to a sweeter fruitier flavor.

The head lasts well into the pour and when it does give way it leaves a very nice film and silky tan lacing. The nose is a little unremarkable with subtle notes of dark chocolate (duh), coffee, burnt sugar, and rroasted prunes, figs, and dates. The mouthfeel is coating and slightly sticky., but strictly in the best of ways. The flavor greatly triumphs over the aroma. It is a deep and rich blend of Belgian dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee, burnt fruits, and deeply roasted malts. This is an incredibly robust and delicious beer.

On style, but not incredible.  Aroma (3): Toasty and burnt up front with lingering roast coffee and a light spiciness (perhaps hops pushing through?). The alcohol is very forward and overshadows the other aromas to an extent.  Taste (4): No real ""chocolate"" flavour, but hits of molasses and a big caramel sweetness. Some minor dark fruit in the background - a nice touch. Again, the alcohol punches through and really is a dominant force between all the malt sweetness.  Mouthfeel (4): Slick, oily and creamy. A nice medium to full body that coats the pallet and lasts long after a sip. The alcohol leaves a nice numbness on the pallet that is both a strong reminder of the beer's potency but also a prep for the next sip.  Overall (4): A BIG beer that will be aged in my cellar for a while. The hotness of the alcohol begs for it to be aged, and I imagine this will be fantastic given a few months to a year (or two).

45,680,StoutHunter,3.99,"I got a bottle of Brooklyn Brewery's Black Chocolate Stout in a trade, thanks a lot @Motozappa. I've been wanting to try this beer for a while and I'm interested to see how it stacks up to some of the other stouts I have tried, so lets see how it goes. 2013 Vintage. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a snifter.  A- The label looks pretty good, it's got a clean, dark, and classy look to it, I think it's a little eye catching. It poured a nice dark black color that didn't let any light come through and it had a half a fingers worth of tan head that quickly died down to a thin ring that eventually faded away and it left a little bit of spotty lacing behind. This was a pretty nice looking beer, but I wish there was a little more head and lacing.  S- The aroma starts off with a higher amount of sweetness followed by the malts being the first to show up and they impart some roasted, slightly charred, sweet malt, and chocolate like aromas with the chocolate seeming to stick out the most and it has a bitter dark chocolate like aspect to it. Up next comes a little more sweetness with some dark fruit aromas and a noticeable alcohol aroma that's just a little boozy. This beer had a pretty good aroma, but I think it would be even better if the alcohol was hidden a little better.  T- The taste seems to be pretty similar to the aroma and it starts off with a higher amount of sweetness followed by the malts still being the first to show up and they impart the same aspects that they did in the aroma with the chocolate still showing up and being showcased nicely, but this time it reminds me more of bitter baker's chocolate. Up next comes a light dark fruit flavor with a pretty noticeable amount of alcohol that tastes a little boozy, but it isn't too warming. On the finish there's a higher amount of medium bitterness followed by a roasted, sweet and chocolate like aftertaste. This was a pretty good tasting beer, but just like the aroma, I think it would be just a little better if the alcohol was hidden a little better.  M- A little smooth, slightly warming, rich, a little cloying, sticky, full bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel was pretty good, but I wish it was just a little smoother.  Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a good example of a Russian Imperial Stout, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style and it stayed true to the name with the dark biter chocolate flavors being showcased in this beer. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was a little smooth, sweet, sticky, rich, a little cloying, boozy and filling, but the taste did a good job at holding my attention so i think one bottle would be the perfect amount for me to sip on and enjoy, I think the sweetness and booze would start to wear on me if I had more than one. I think this would make for a good beer to enjoy on those cold and snowy days in the winter. What I like the most about this beer was the taste, it was pretty good and the chocolate flavors stuck out enough to make it true to it's name. What I like the least about this beer was how much the alcohol showed up, I think the 10% could have been hidden a little better. I would buy this beer again, it would be nice to keep a couple in the fridge for the winter and I would like to see how this beer ages overtime, maybe age will help tame some of that alcohol. I would recommend this to anyone who likes strong stouts, but it may be a little too intense for people who aren't real into the style. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I did think that there were a couple aspects of this beer that could be improved upon, but other than that I still enjoyed and I wouldn't turn one down. It isn't my favorite Russian Imperial Stout, but it is now my favorite beer from Brooklyn Brewery. Good job guys, this was a pretty good Stout, keep up the solid work.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

If you let this beer warm a few degrees as you savor its darkness and 10% ABV it becomes acrid/hot and almost undrinkable playing second fiddle to Stone's RIS.

Chocolate starts to emerge mid way, leading to bitter dark chocolate, bitter coffee, and some booze. Seems to have some spice going on as well.  M- Medium thick body. Creamy and viscous with super sharp carbonation. Drying.  O- Not the biggest fan of this one.

Moves onto a heavy roasted coffee like taste. Unlike the smell, alcohol is well hidden. mmm.  M: Full bodied. Thick. Yummy.  O: An extremely complex and delicious RIS.

45,680,GOBLIN,4.25,Mmm . . . . Tasty ! I've enjoyed this stout many times. I had the pleasure of selecting the beers for a food and beer tasting party awhile back and this was a no Brainer selection for me to represent RIS's and introduce everyone present to the style. Everything you could want in the style with huge amountselection of chocolate. Brooklyn's best beer !,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MarkQ617,4.29,"Had this poured into a stout glass. After a few sips I decided this was my favorite beer I've tried to date from Brooklyn. Dark chocolate color to match both the flavor and the aroma. Generous tannish-brown head. Aroma of chocolate and coffee beans. Incredibly smooth mouthfeel and medium body for a stout.

This is a great beer!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Chiefy770,4.15,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter. Bottled on September 12th, 2013. (2013-2014 release)  Appearance: Pours thick and as close to black as a beer can get. No light is getting through this one. Very thin tan head. Not the best lacing in the world. 3.75  Smell: Mocha latte. Sweet molasses. Chocolate. Subtle notes of sweet fruit.  Taste: Smooth chocolate up front. A bitterness of toasted, almost burnt grains kicks in. Notes of coffee develop very well in the finish. Minor notes of dark fruit, almost like a Fig Newton, kick in. For the most part the alcohol is pretty well masked, however, it does break through pretty well in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, no surprises there. The carbonation is low, but high enough to carry the bitter notes.  Overall: The chocolate flavor is phenomenal, though I am not wild about some of the supporting flavors though. The mocha flavors are spot on but the bitterness is really cranked up in this one. Almost sour notes of burnt toast develop. The alcohol is also to pronounced in the finish, but I suppose that's to be expected given it is a 20 proof beer. I really think this will develop well with a year or two on it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JulioH,3.9,"Very good beer. Somewhat one of the lightest in texture, it is easy to drink and does not feel thick or heavy. It almost feels like a stout that could be had in pairs.  That said, this beer is heady. Be it the 10%, you can feel the alcohol go quickly to your head as you are sipping on it. It does have a nice carbonation though, reminding me of most Belgian ales, but of course, this is not a Belgian ale, so the carbonation is minimal yet present in miniscule bubbles.  This stout, however, is just a bitter coffee beer. There is no chocolate or any other ingredients, and it qualifies as a very traditional American stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

T: same as nose, wonderful taste, sweet, little bit salty end, bitternes is present but well rounded. mild bitter prolonged aftertaste.

45,680,PeterParker,4.21,"Pours black as the ace of spades, appropriately. Small head that is swiftly fleeting.  Dark roastiness on the nose. A bit of bitter chocolate. It is what I think of as a deep stout smell. It's good. Can pick up a tad bit of Belgian-esque malts. Smells sweet.  Probably one of the most aptly named beers. Taste is predominantly dark dark chocolate. Like 90% cacao. Sweetens up on the tail end but dominated by the dark chocolate. Not overly complex but still really nice.  Coats the mouth and leaves a bittersweet cocoa aftertaste.  Overall this beer is great. I had this a few years ago and thought it was too boozey, now I don't even taste booze. I understand the hype now. Definitely one of the best, if not the best chocolate stout I've had.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Mongrel,4.13,"Pours just about black, with some chestnut highlights and a rich, dark tan head, British khaki if you will. Leaves pretty nice lacing. Sexy looking beer if poured right.  Smells roasty and a little sweet, with hints of dark fruit and char. It also has that inky espresso/licorice bitter aroma that I can never quite put my finger on.  Taste is bittersweet in the best way. Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, hint of coffee and more than a hint of licorice. Flavor delivery is sometimes really concentrated and sometimes softer, balanced by a mild oatmeal sort of element. A firm hop presence reinforces the coffee/chocolate bitterness and lends a cool veneer. Finishes dry, almost chalky, with just a touch of syrupy chocolate at the back of the throat. Very well balanced, with not a hint of alcohol.  I know some have complained about the mouthfeel, saying it's thin, but I think it's fine. Medium-full with a big hearty oatmeal center. It's like the comfort food of beers.  Overall, this beer is delicious and drinks entirely too easily for a 10% impy stout. And a steal at $8-9 a four-pack.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Bone53,4.48,"Served from a bottle into a snifter at around 50°F.  Appearance: Thick pour; Black with no light coming through. A frothy one finger tan head that dissipates quickly.  Smell: Dark fruit and roasted malts. Not as much chocolate as I was anticipating, but it's there. A slight alcohol presence as well.  Taste: It starts off with dark fruit, chocolate in the middle, and roasted malts, almost like espresso, on the end that lingers on the palate. A slight alcohol burn that compliments the cold weather. Very enjoyable.  A heavy medium mouthfeel. Slightly creamy yet has an alcohol bite.  Overall: I still have plenty of RIS to try, but this is right behind my favorites so far (Expedition and Founders) and very affordable for the style. Not as choclatey as the title indicates, but rather has all the traditional RIS characteristics and they mold together nicely. Very well done and especially appetizing with this harsh winter we have been having. Cheers!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Nose has hints of roasted malts and dark chocolate.  Taste is dark baking chocolates, dark fruits, with an ample amount of hops to keep the sweetness at bay.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth.  Overall this is a brew that has American Stout written all over it but it has some Belgian influences with it's smooth dark fruit characteristics.

A: pours a dark near black with a one finger head of root beer colored foam that breaks quickly and leaves little behind but a tiny island of foam.  S: chocolate and dark fruits with some light coffee and roast.  T: chocolate, coffee and roasts up front with some dark fruits and a bit of booze on the back end.  M: medium body with a creamy feel. Good carbonation.  O: this came highly recommended by a few friends, and I see the potential but I think that perhaps this bottle was too young to get the best out of it.

45,680,dougbotrob,4.01,"A: Thick head, darker-cream color, lasted about 3 minutes to settle down, then left with just a bit of lacing to look at. This is a-ok for me because I'm not drinking the lacing, i'm drinking the beer. S: The nose is great but I embarrassingly have trouble placing it. There's the obvious chocolate and malt, and I want to say ""dark fruit"" but I don't mean black cherry or currant. I *think* I'm smelling figs but honestly it's been a while since I've smelled figs so I might be pulling that out of no where. In any case it smells dark and delicious and mostly like semi sweet chocolate. T: Bittersweet chocolate (not the kind you want to eat, but the kind you bake with), coffee, more dark fruits- this makes me ask myself ""what's the difference between dates and figs?"" M: Well carbonated, thick enough but certainly not syrupy, just what I want from a big stout. O: It's a solid chocolate stout, not the best but definitely not the worst. I've bought it before and I'll definitely keep buying it in the future.

Medium bodied with a slick creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation level is normal. The alcohol is not well hidden and dominates the flavor profile after the initial notes of chocolate.

Finishes smoothly with a bit of sweetness followed by alcohol.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,RVigz,3.53,The initial smell and taste of this beer is astounding. It has an opening taste of malty coffee/chocolate with a smooth body. The finish is a strong malty taste that pulls through the chocolate taste. The aftertaste is pretty strong on the malty taste so i would recommend some food in between to break up the malty taste. The smell of this stout cant be beat.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,beercat11,3.38,"I have had this brew for the last 7 offerings(brewing seasons) and every year I look for the uniqueness of each yearly release if there is one.  This years version seems more balanced and a little more complex than most past years versions, I keep a journal with my thoughts and note them when I have my first few sips. I feel that's when the small nuances of each batch are the most impressed upon me. I have never been a big fan of this stout but it is local enough to me where it is priced pretty well at $6.99 a 4 pack. I have seen it at local markets for as much as $3 more.  It seems that this stout always has a character about it that turns me off. I find it on the back end. Up front it has that traditional RIS that's so prevalent for the style but I can't seem to get beyond the off flavors I get towards the end.  There are roasted malts and black licorice candy which you would typically expect in this style but the finish is just too frustrating for me. Some reviews complain about the lack of carbonation here but I think they are on to exactly what I am saying about the finishing flavors. This year I got an idea on how to fix this issue and I have to say I nailed it first try. I added some high end all natural organic vanilla extract, about a teaspoon full into a 12 ounce bottle. Wow! who would think that this 1 thing could change everything about this beer, up front and all the way home.  If this additional flavor was added to this beer at the brewer You would see much higher reviews I am sure. Most reviews are up there but not everyone is as picky and critical of a beer as a few others like me. Try it and see. Just make sure you use high quality extract.

45,680,MacQ32,4.21,"2012 Vintage  A - Pours near black with a dense finger+ of rich chocolate colored head, fantastic lacing and retention.  S - Decadent chocolate with a minimal underlying roastyness, great hazelnut like aromas, a bit boozy, perhaps a hint of raisin.  T - Lots of rich milk chocolate and sweet vanilla type flavors, roasty hazelnuts, alcohol and subtle dark fruits kick in towards the backend, minimally medicine-y. Aftertaste is like chocolate oak with a hint of booze/medicine.  M - Full bodied, more carbonated than expected but still little carbonation, it works very very w ell. Kind of a sipper, deliciously creamy, but I'm consuming around 45 degrees so its going down pretty quick.

45,680,hopflyer,3.95,"Update. 2015 version.  Haven't had this since my review below so figured I'd give it another shot. Much more refined and booze, licorice notes are way back seat to the chocolate i was expecting. Dark fruit just as prominent as the chocolate and a pleasant bitterness rounds it out. Glad I have this another go.  Julian date 2663. So bottled September 23, 2013  pours pitch black, small tan head. head retains throughout with minimal lacing.  aroma is light roast coffee and a bit of dark chocolate. Dominated by dark fruits though, fig, plum.  Coffee and dark fruits from the nose follow thru the initial taste. Not picking up much of the dark chocolate. Some bitterness and subtle resinous hops. Alcohol hidden well. Bitterness carries thru and doesn't really mellow out much and lingers more than I would like it to in the aftertaste. Some backstage black licorice too. Sambuca-like as it warms and booziness becomes apparent. Where's the dark chocolate?!  Very thick and sticky with moderate carbonation.  I think this is my first beer from Brooklyn and I'm underwhelmed. Was expecting a nice smooth chocolate stout. Instead it was more of a bitter liqueur. Not a bad beer but it's label doesn't match its contents according to my palate.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,HalfFull,3.65,"From notes, 3/13. 12 oz. bottle from a recent winter release and poured into a globe glass. Pours an opaque black with a finger of deep mocha foam. Shows decent retention and lace, flattening out a bit by mid glass however.  Lots of roast, chocolate and a firm punch of alcohol on the aroma front. Booziness comes across as rummy and barrel like in nature which gives the beer an interesting depth.  Taste is a bit oily given the rummy character. Offers a rich malt profile yet a bit singular in nature. Rich chocolate notes yet without the bitterness or close of dark chocolate. Lighter on the roast than the arom might suggest and a touch of black cherry with warming. Feel is full and rich yet lacks the lingering chocolate one might expect.  Overall the lack of carbonation after the initial pour creates a lessened experience. Rich and boozy but a bit short in depth consideing it all. Vinous in nature like a fruit bomb of a zinfandel. Probably not worth the calories.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Also has a little boozy kick to it. Fantastic balance, but nothing really seems to blow me away here. There does seem to be some complexity, but maybe I just prefer my chocolate stouts more straightforward with an abundance of sweet cocoa.  M- Silky, yet thick and creamy.

45,680,Jim_Benz,4.1,"My wife and I each drank one bottle (2013) in tulips, served at cellar temp--around 58° F (or a little less).  Appearance--dark chocolate black topped by a one inch head of milk chocolate foam-- very appealing and rich-- the head dissipated in about two minutes, maintaining a rim around the edges throughout. I forget any distinctions about the lacing.  Smell--alcohol and dark chocolate, mostly bitter but rich and tempting.  Taste--same as the nose, like 80% cacao dark chocolate lightly (or barely) sweetened with grain alcohol. In fact, the flavor of the alcohol seems to play a major role in both taste and bittering. No real hints of coffee; not much taste of roasted grain outside of the chocolate flavor; hops indiscernable. Not incredibly complex but perfect in its own way. Very tasty and decadent. Dry and bitter on the finish, but somewhat cloying on the tongue without being particularly sweet in any way.  Mouthfeel--medium to full body, more carbonation than I expected, less creaminess. As it warmed and the carbonation lessened, it became a little smoother but not much.  Overall--a very good, very rich imperial stout that drank just like its name implied. The 10% ABV packed a punch, but it also provided a distinct flavor that accentuated the chocolate beautifully. I'm curious to see how this one ages--will it become more complex; will the alcohol/chocolate bitterness soften into something a bit mellower and roastier; will it develop a creamier body? I guess time will tell, but it'll be worth drinking either way.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S: Big creamy chocolate aroma with a little hint of roastiness. Some sweetness of dark fruits is detectable but not easily identifiable.  T/M: A slight prickliness of carbonation alongside a fruity sweetness that is slightly tart up front leads into a smooth chocolate flavor. The rest of the sip is dominated by chocolate and roastiness, with the finish having a slight roasty bitterness. Alcohol is not strongly detectable, but there is a definite warming sensation from it after the sip. Mouthfeel is heavy but maybe a little thinner than I had expected, with low-to-moderate carbonation.  O: This is a really nice beer, but is honestly less chocolatey than I had expected from the name. I honestly get more creamy chocolate from Dark Horse's Plead the 5th. Which isn't a knock on this beer, but rather an observation about the expectations created from its name.

A fine black color that is completely opaque. How much more black could this be? The answer is none. None more black.  S: I got a lot of dark fruit and roast. Very little chocolate. I was surprised by the amount of dark fruit in the nose. Sweet.  T: I tasted much more chocolate than the smell. Dark chocolate. Sweet alcohol, but not overpowering or anything. Its in check, definitely for 10%. Some raisin remains from the dark fruit nose. The carbonation adds something to this, but I don't think its beneficial. I think a little more time in the cellar would have definitely helped. It could use a little more complexity.  MF: Medium-low mouthfeel. I would have enjoyed a more full bodied mouthfeel.

45,680,wildcatboy,3.78,A very solid stout. Poured from a 12oz bottle into tulip. I didn't get as much chocolate smell or taste as expected... Based on the name. More of a malty flavor with slight hint of dark chocolate followed by a bit of boozeyness. It was a much better taste as the beer began to warm up. I would get this beer again. Just now in my top tier but I can see why some feel it should be.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ugamike888,4.21,"I think this is a very solid beer.  Appearance: Poured a 12 oz bottle into a Snifter. Poured with about a half inch of light brown head. The edges were laced with a darker toffee color. Beautiful beer that is dark brown, just shy of black and lets no light through.  Smell: The only thing somewhat lacking about this brew. Smells of bitter chocolate syrup. A little hint of roasty malts and coffee. Obvious aroma of alcohol.  Taste: Yumm. This is dessert-like. Well balanced and I wouldn't want it any sweeter. Loads of cocoa and a hint of dark fruit.  Mouthfeel: Feels medium-full with an oily slickness and leaves a lingering taste of alcohol on the tongue.  I wish I could find this beer year round. Highly enjoyable to drink.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,errantnight,3.31,"A beer that I've never particularly loved that I keep wondering if maybe it's me, given the general adulation. May need to try it again in a blind American IRS stand-off. My latest caveats are that maybe if it isn't overloaded with coffee and other adjuncts or barrel aged to hackinsack I'm just not digging the giant 10% boozehound stouts these days? I dunno, but I found the Stone IRS I had on tap a couple months ago to be more enjoyable. Anyway, caveats out of the way:  This 11-12 winter bottling pours beautifully into an Innis & Gunn tulip. Inky black, thin, rich, fizzy head dises down to a persistent ring with nice lacing.  Aroma is chocolate and just a hint of warming alcohol and... not much else. A sort of freezer burn note hints at some oxidation, as does a slighty sherry and raisin note.  On the palate this is still plenty boozy and bitter despite the two years (this has been in the fridge for that entire time, however, which certainly would have minimized degradation). Chocolate and roast predominate, and there's a long, lingering bitterness. It's not bad, it's just not terribly complex or interesting. I'm struggling to pull nuances out of the malt character which is covered up quickly and heavily by waves of bitterness that seems like a mesh of hop, roast and alcohol derived flavors.  Ranking this just slightly above average feels like something of an apology to it. It's lacking in any obvious flaws, but it tastes unbalanced and slightly unpleasant. I've got a few more bottles from this same year, a couple of which weren't aged in the fridge, maybe some extended cellar aging did it some favors? Seems doubtful.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The aroma has a milk chocolate and oatmeal stout aroma and a creaminess. Black coffee, almost like deep espresso, roasted chocolate malt. There’s a slight booziness in there too. Almost like Nesquick with the milkiness. There's also some Belgian quad deep rich fruits too.  The flavor has this semi-sweet chocolate flavor with a good roasted malt backbone. There’s a The middle has this uplifting bitterness of dark chocolate and a slight booze. The finish has roasted bitterness that climbs up from the middle. There’s definitely some alcohol and licorice in there. There’s a big lingering roasted smokiness that lingers. It really has a huge Russian Imperial stout flavor.  The mouthfeel falls a bit too quickly, but it does leave a great big strong finish on your tongue.  The beer is almost like an oatmeal stout, but huge and with bitter chocolate. It really is quite well rounded. I wouldn’t recommend this as a “chocolate” beer because it really isn’t. It instead is a roasty Russian Imperial.  (This is an update) With a year, the beer still shows some booze on both the nose and flavor. Lots of coffee, some fudgey chocolate, dark raisins. The beer is quite robust and very heavy on the roast. Almost a grainy quality there too.  I French pressed a tablespoon of Intelligentsia Bourbon County 2013 coffee into it.  The aroma is just of fresh roasted coffee, like at a roaster or store. Obscenely coffee fresh. The flavor follows with a bit of the base beer of dark chocolate and roasted malt, but then it's dominated by a beautiful woody, vanilla, dark cherry black coffee. The booze still comes through.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,GorgonSed,3.86,"A - Jet black and opaque. No light gets through at all. Head disappears quickly. Head is thin and light.  S -Chocolate, cherry, smoke and a bit of alcohol bite. Disappointing but I suppose it is a stout.  T - Chocolate cherry flavor hits hard and then mellows into smoke. Not much alcoholic bite to it at first, but it prickles the tongue after it sits. I was surprised to see it's 10% ABV.  M - About as thick as expected. Flavor lingers long after sipping.  O - I'm pleasantly surprised by this one. Haven't had great experience with Brooklyn Brewery but they've won me over here. Extremely surprised this is 10% ABV.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,alaimoa,3.6,"2012 vintage a bit disappointed from what I remember fresh. Current pour is ok with head that quickly fades. Nose is alcohol forward, bit if spent coffee grinds, chocolate largely gone as far as sweet smell.

Feel is thick",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DrinkNewport,4.15,"We had this one about a year back, so it's interesting to see the palate-shift.  As the name suggests, it's a BLACK pour. No surprise there. There wasn't much head, which I'm beginning to learn isn't much of an indicator of anything when it comes to serious stouts.  The mild aroma lets the roasted malts come through.  This beer tastes less like chocolate and more like Marmite, with a hint of chocolate, which works.  Overall? A good beer that seems to be becoming more available.

45,680,BryanCarey,4.52,"Brooklyn Black Chocolate stout is a very dark stout with a brown- colored head of foam and a nose of roasted malt, dark chocolate, caramel, and alcohol. Generous amounts of lacing are left as you drink and the physical appearance alone makes this beer stand out in a crowd.  But beauty of appearance is only the beginning. Take a sip and you will experience the delectable flavors of roasted malt, chocolate, some coffee, caramel, smoke, even hints of vanilla and dark fruit. The body of the beer is thick and creamy, and the beer is bitter overall.  Dark, decadent, and delightful, Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is still one of my old- time favorites and an excellent example of the Russian Imperial Stout style. Hundreds of craft breweries have created imperial stouts of their own over the past few years, but this is still one of my favorites from the older, more established craft breweries. I like the roasted malt and chocolate character and the bitterness, while obvious, isn’t offensive in any way and knows how to keep itself behaved.  I love chocolate and I love stout so Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is an easy winner in my book. I still love indulging in a few bottles from time to time and I still rank it among my favorites. Grab some for yourself and tantalize your senses.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,AtrumAnimus,4.33,"This one pours brilliant black that allows no light to pass, not even from the 100 watt bulb over my head. The head is a thick and resilient tan that is extremely slow to settle.  The lacing appear to be extreme and more of a resilient clinging head that is coating the glass.  The nose is sweet, caramel, dark chocolate, cardamon and some alcohol with a subtle hint of hops.  The favor is far more dry and hoppy than I expected with the nose. I was expecting much more malt. That said, it is a pleasant surprise. The taste is subdued malt with strong stout overtones of the chocolate, coffee, caramel and toast that has a strong hopped flavor throughout the entire tasting. The bitter is strong but not overwhelming and is very pleasant with a nice IPA like finish.  The mouthfell is a bit watery considering the thick head, lacing and the fact it is a stout. But overall is more than acceptable.  Overall I really like it. It is finally cold enough outside that stouts are perfect. A nice dark beer that warms you up with alcohol that is not over strong and a great mix of flavors. This is good. I will definitely drink it again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S- Fantastic dark chocolate, roasted malty sweetness, and smokey notes.  T- Superb dark chocolate/coffee bitterness that fades into a nice chocolate sweetness. The 10% ABV is present but masked phenomenally. As the beer warms, more and more of the chocolate and alcohol pokes through.  M- Full bodied, creamy and thick. Excellent.  O- One of my new favorite Russian Imperial Stouts. Nice dark chocolate bitterness then blends into milk chocolate and roasty malt sweetness. Definitely some heat at the back end but for a 10%'er it's well hidden esp for a fresh bottle. One of my new winter favorites",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,WheelsPSU,4.12,"I picked up the new 13-14 batch from of all places, Whole Foods in Union Square. At $8.99 for a four pack of a 10% ABV beer in NYC, I was pleased.  This poured a deep brown that bordered on muddy. Opaque just like an Imperial Stout should be. The head was subdued, a creamy beige color.  The smell produced dark chocolate, smoke, and roasted malts. It reminded me more of a roasted coffee smell than of anything overly sweet.  The taste had more malts and black coffee. But as the beer warmed the rich chocolate sweetness started to show.  Mouthfeel was creamy and thick. I almost felt like I got a hit of fruit at the finish. The high alcohol content was pretty well concealed too.  Even though the name is Black Chocolate Stout, I picked up a bunch of malts and coffee is the smell and flavor. But this beer truly shines , and the chocolate comes out, after it beer sits for a few minutes. I have the 12-13 batch from last year that I am waiting to open to compare the two. Well done, Brooklyn.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Richardbeerlover,3.18,"When a beer says chocolate I expect chocolate. This one has no chocolate taste whatsoever. Is it dark like chocolate? Yes. Does it smell like chocolate ? Very slightly. Does it taste like chocolate ? Not at all. No sweetness at all. Now if Brooklyn is trying to market this beer as ""chocolate"" based solely on the fact that this beer is dark like chocolate that is fine. But I was disappointed that there was not much chocolate taste at all especially compared to Young's or Smith's. Not sure why it's rated so highly.  The 10% ABV however is fantastic. You can taste the strength of the alcohol and is the redeeming quality of this beer for me.  Drank my second bottle a few weeks after my initial review. The chocolate is more prevalent now and so is the dark coffee flavor. A bit sweeter than I remembered. I'm liking this beer now! Still not as good as Samuel Smith's but really holds it's own in its own special way.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Dayman766,4.18,"A- Black and totally opaque, as you'd expect. Head disappeared as soon as it appeared. S- Chocolate and dark fruits T- Definite chocolate and coffee flavors with low, appropriate levels of bitterness. Certainly some of the 10% ABV showing towards the end, but I rather like how it develops - not jarring or distasteful. M- One of the first things that struck me about this beer was its incredibly smooth and velvety mouthfeel. Seems to glide across your tongue. O - This is a solid and accessible imperial stout and I look forward to the next one.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BrewMaven,4.1,Totally black with a passing thin tan head. hints of lace.  Dark chocolate nose with a bit of licorice?  Taste is mostly dark bitter chocolate with slight sweetness through the middle. Dry finish with slight bitterness..Really nice!  Medium bodied with faint carbonation..Excellent! I really should indulge in this way more often than I have. Maybe cellar some too.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,redearth329,4.74,"One of my favorites. Poured from a growler into a tall tumbler at 40 degrees.  A - Impenetrably black. Two fingers of dense, light brown head that quickly disappeared. Not really any lace sticking around to speak of.  S- Dark chocolate malt notes, a bit of coffee perhaps. After that some dark fruit notes; plum, mostly, also some black cherry. Just a bit of heat from the alcohol, but you have to be looking for it.  T- Really rich and well-balanced. Chocolate is present, but sweetness is matched by roasty bitterness. The alcohol content is not obvious.  M- Full bodied with very light carbonation. A bit of lingering astringent quality from the roasted malt bitterness.  As a side note, this beer cellars very well. I once kept some Brooklyn BCS for a year, and it was really mellow after that time and the fruit (plum, black cherry, etc.) notes really gained in complexity. The restaurant I where I was working at the time served a 3-year aged BCS which was even more amazing. It could easily go longer in the right conditions. If you're disciplined enough not to drink it all, it's definitely worth trying to cellar it for a while.  Pair it with a slice of New York Cheesecake.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,SFNC,4.46,"This one poured midnight black into a cut cafe glass. A finger size head of an intense mocha color formed and remained a ring on the edge of the glass for the entire 45 minute drinking period. The smell was of dark roast coffee, deep roasted malt and dark chocolate. The taste intensified those characteristics, plus added more chcolate depth with a subtle alcohol burn considering he 10% rating. Mouthfeel was smooth and viscous with slight carbonation, once again the alchohol was well hidden. This is the best offering that I've had from Brooklyn Brewery, a strong contender for my favorite Stout. World Class.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,PsilohsaiBiN,4.38,"2012 vintage  Appearance: Black as death, pours with virtually no head aside from a small, tan collar.  Smell: Dark chocolate, roasted malt, graham cracker, faint dark fruit.  Taste: Dark chocolate up front gives way to a roasted malt punch that subsides gently. You're left with chocolate, malt and that slight graham cracker/cookie I got in the nose. It all fades out nicely into a dry finish. Even with a year on it, there's still some booze at the end, but aside from that it drinks smooth as silk.  Mouthfeel: Heavy mouthfeel. Not quite Hunah or BCBS, but close. Silky, velvety smooth. There is ample carbonation to keep things interesting.  Overall: Not many points I could take away from this bad boy, aside from the booze at the end. Would love to taste a barrel aged version. Well done.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,artoolemomo,3.13,"Appearance- Pours up less than a finger's worth of head but has pretty good retention. The head is a dark beige/mocha while the body is an opaque, dark chocolate black. Hints of sheeting extend from the surface of the beer. Lacing is okay.  Nose- There is chocolate there but it's very subtle. Slight hints of roasted malts. More milk chocolate than dark chocolate. Hope the flavor profile is more engaging than the aroma. If not, this is going to be one boring beer. Some milkiness and cream. Reminds me more of a dry or milk stout at the moment. Swirling shows the creaminess of the aroma even more.  Taste- Large roasted notes with some chocolate but huge coffee. The coffee and roasted malts are so prominent they give off very woody bitterness. This leads into a sour sweet note that reminds me of tart raisins (even a little bit of lemon?) If any of that sounds unappetizing, it's because it really isn't. Not to say that this is a bad beer; it just doesn't jive with my palate. Some heat but the coffee really overwhelms. Maybe the sour fruity ester of the finish is more like a red berry or pomegranate. Whatever it is, I don't like it. Reminds me a little bit of the Disorder Stout (Barley Brown's) I had yesterday. However, that didn't have this sour sweetness which tends toward being acrid because of its extended linger. Maybe it's too fresh but there is no way I'm splurging on this again. Does have some positive qualities but is pretty much average.  Mouthfeel- A little more than medium bodied. Slightly over carbonated. Somewhat gritty. Tiny slickness.  Drinkability- Definitely not sessionable. Probably a drain pour for many but I prefer to suck it up. I think I paid 7 bucks online and that is way too much.  Overall- I am curious whether this is too fresh or if this is infected. Very average beer that has enough redeeming qualities not to be considered poor. Would try it again if I found it on the cheap.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,TheAlamoWrocker,3.83,"Reviewed November 2, 2013. Limited bottling (Winter 11-12). Poured a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  A: Very thin, less than a 1/4 finger, cocoa tan head. This head dissipates down to essentially nothing in less than a few seconds.  S: Exploding alcoholic dark chocolate aromas. Sticky burnt brown sugars finish off the nose.  T: The initial taste are of booming dark roasted malts with a thorough alcoholic taste.  M: This is no doubt a thick sticky brew. Carbonation is extremely thin if at all present.  O: With an alcohol content of 10% by volume I was hoping this would've aged nicely a bit, but it did not. You would think that I would've learned this lesson by now due to the fact that I have aged other chocolate based stouts. If your stout has chocolate in its name then do not age it.

A rather vigorous pour raised a decent head but this soon reduced to a thin partial top coat. The body looks thick and black.  Aroma: a nice blend of dark malts and alcohol esters.  Flavor: rich, dark malts without more than a hint of burnt grain. High ABV rather obvious yet mixes nicely with the other flavor components; still it is more than a little boozy when young, but better integrated in the aged bottle.  Feel: full bodied, and then some. Slight alcohol burn makes me think this would be a great candidate for barrel aging.  O: an imperial stout indeed, aromatic and flavorful.

45,680,SerialTicker,4.14,"$2.19 single bottle poured into a shaker pint (the good glasses were dirty!)  Appearance: As to be expected for the style, pitch black. A pretty dark brown head sits on top, and is about a finger in height. Dies down fairly quickly. Some really nice lacing for the first half of the glass or so, which I wasn't really expecting. A pretty great looking beer. Carbonation is surprisingly high on this beer, and you can see quite a few bubbles streaming through.  Smell: Dark chocolate, roast, coffee... some of the usual suspects from such a beer. Surprisingly sweet aroma. This also has a tinge of alcohol in the aroma. Dark fruits come through a little bit as it warms, but not much.  Taste/feel: First thing I noticed was the carbonation -- it's actually pretty high, and I wasn't expecting that at all. There's a pretty full body, but it's not as thick as some other RIS's I've had. There's a bit of booze flavor, and a slight warmth. Alcohol isn't entirely well hidden, but I don't expect that in an Imperial Stout. The thing I like most about this beer is, well... a lot of things. First of all, like I said, I appreciate that it isn't syrupy thick/sweet. I get that in some of the critically acclaimed RIS's, and I don't like that too much. Additionally, although the smell isn't something you probably haven't smelled from another quality RIS, this is just that, a quality RIS. A lot of chocolate, coffee, and roast in this, and it makes me want to dive in. As much as I like this beer, I was expecting a bit of a chocolate bomb given the name. There's definitely a chocolate presence (especially in the aftertaste), but not as big as I figured there would be.  An excellent RIS that could easily be year round... the price is also damn hard to beat. One of the cheapest RIS's I've purchased, and nearly the best.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,hoody711,3.97,"Fall is here in Chicago and it's cold this week. I was challenged by a friend to report on a beer hiding in the back of my fridge. This little guy has been hiding since last December.  A - from a 12 oz bottle into a Darkness tulip. 10% booze - yeehaw. The bottle is nice, looks classy. The beer pours a very dark brown and produces a lovely dark bronze-ish head, 2-3 fingers worth. The head settles to a thin ring.  S - so, there's dark chocolate. Duh. There's a little roastiness as well. There's some breadiness and wort as well. Just kidding, I don't smell any of that bullshit. It smells like a chocolate RIS. Chocolate, roasted malts, and booze. Nicely blended. Not as good as Stone's offering, but it smells good.  T - follows along as above. Chocolate and roasty malts, then there's some sweetness, then the chocolate again, with some sharpness, then a nice booziness to warm the ol cockles.  M - thinner than I expected to be honest. It coats the tongue nicely, a tad oily, and bitter on the way down.  O - who know's if this beer has changed a lot during its hibernation, but it's real good now. Comes real close to being perfect in a lot of ways. Definitely a great beer for the coming winter months.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Gryphon69,3.77,"12oz bottle date: winter 13/14 oversized wine glass  A- Pours a nice black with a mocha head. Fades to a hard to see ring around the glass.  S- Alcohol, dark roasted malts, chocolate, burnt brown sugar.  T- Dark fruits, which have a certain sweetness, some burnt chocolate / malts.  M- Full body, more on the heavy side. Has a creaminess and a fizzy carbonation that is start to finish. Has a alcohol burn on the tongue.  O- Decent taste, has more dark fruit sweetness that throws off the balance imo. Can defiantly tell its 10%, it lets you know from the smell to the finishing taste, finding that the alcohol is less hidden in some of our American brews, but once you get past that the flavors are pretty good.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,lordofstarside,3.94,"12oz to a snifter, no idea about the bottle date, I'm pretty sure it's from last year though  Pours pitch black with a half finger of dark brown head that dissipated pretty quickly leaving a frothy ring around the edge of the glass. Moderate carbonation stems from the sides. Lacing isn't bad, same with the over all look  Smells of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, cherry, and alcohol. Everything comes together well, not a bad smelling beer  Taste is with the nose, strong robust roasted coffee malts backed by strong chocolate, some dark fruits, and some alcohol. Comes together nicely  Feel is full bodied, thick and a bit sharp going down. Alcohol is concealed well, drinkable if sipped slow enough, hurts my throat if I swallow too much. Improved as the beer warmed  Overall not a bad beer, not as chocolatey as I expected though. Feel still needs a lot of smoothing out. Glad Brooklyn has expanded to the west coast and I got to try this though",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,danieelol,4.08,"Second brush with this beer. Wasn't impressed the first time.  Pours a brooding but not entirely unsympathetic black with nice heavily tanned head.  Smell is potent roast, some booze. Creamy, with a hint of nuttiness. Almost a lactic quality. Overall has a nice sharp classiness to it. Slightly vinous and a teensy bit of soy.  Taste is a nice three-dimensional roast and some alcohol. Good bitterness.  Mouthfeel is roasty, decently thick, bitter.  Good beer, I'd almost mistake it for a (really dry) imperial milk stout. Definitely had those Sort Maelk-notes. Good stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Taste is once again deep dark cocoa and chocolate, roasted malt, espresso, toffee, caramel, burnt bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel is silky and smooth, medium carbonation. Really nice.  Had this a few months ago and decided it could use a bit in the cellar and man was I right. Really great beer here, nice price, a lot of distinct flavors going on.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,rdilauro,4.87,"WOW.... Thats one word to describe this stout. It is dark, it has a great aroma. Hints of chocolate and coffee with a touch of cinnamon.  Then the pour.... Dark dark dark through and through. Then slowly the white creamy head rises to the top. Not a lot, just enough to separate the dark from the cream.  The first sip. Its smooth, its delicious, you can taste the coffee more than the chocolate and it is smooothh The beer in your mouth is very full and the after taste lingers for a long time.  For a beer that is 10$ ABV, you would never realize it because it is so easy to drink  I gotta run out and buy several more 4packs.  09/2012 Second major tasting of this stout.. Same as before, loads of chocolate in the noise and in the taste. This years brew seems to be fuller and rounder than the 2011, which to me was even that much more enjoyable. The only negative, and its a very small negative, is that in this batch (2012), I seem to taste/feel more alcohol. Even at 10%, past years brews seem to have less of an alcoholic taste. But then again, this could be just more beer tasting techniques and skills have been advancing. Even so, a great STOUT!  11/13/12 Another Tasting: This one is getting better and better every time I taste it.. Its getting close to a 5 for me now  02/02/13 One more time. This time, I could feel the chocolate as well as smell and taste it I was anxious like a little boy in a candy stand waiting to unwrap the chocolate candy bar and bit into it. Well tonight, I was that little boy and boy did I enjoy this even more  09/23/13 Another tasting. Even more than before this stout has everything, I mean everything I ever wanted in a stout. The pour was beautiful. Deep rich black chocolate stout down into the glass, then topped with a 1 1/2 frothy amber cream head that stayed and stayed. Once my nose was inside the glass, I felt like a kid in a chocolate factory. The taste was superb, you would think at 10% ABV, there would be some burn here, but its smooth and smoother As I had more from my glass, I could detect the alcohol in the nose but still was not in the taste. The chocolate got richer and the beer kept on getting better.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Tsar_Riga,4.54,"2012-13, cellared for a year since I picked it up.  A - Solid black with not a bit of transparency. Not much head, but what is there sticks around, forming a tan ring around the edge. Serious legs.  S - I love the nose on this. Big chocolate, a note of roasted coffee and toasted bread. The big ABV shows in warm burn around the edges.  T - The chocolate nose recedes into roasted grains and coffee elements, with a big turn toward bitterness in the middle and close. The bitter edge keeps growing into the close, until it is the only note that remains. Chocolate nibs, rather than the cocoa element from the nose, are the main evocation of that aspect, and it is present throughout. That it is all built on the malt and hop bill is a sign of just how assured Brooklyn is as it puts this together.  M - This is perhaps my one quibble. The bitterness is heavy here, and builds. This is a sipper, not based on the 10% ABV, but because a quick drink will overwhelm the palate with bitterness, leaving the more subtle notes to drop out.  O - I am a big fan of this beer. It is full and robust, and that it evokes so completely the full range of chocolate notes without using adjuncts is impressive to say the least. There is serious alcohol and bitterness tied into the sweeter elements, so do not mistake this for a simple dessert beer. A stout of the first order, this will always be a go-to RIS in my book.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jacob_dowden,3.79,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Winter 12-13. I have poured this in both a standard pint glass, and my preferred Trappistes Rochefort snifter (has a wide rim for a great aroma release.  A- Great dark tan head. Retention is less than would be expected for a stout. I noticed that the head retention is more stable in the narrower pint glass. That's the case for most beers, however. This stout has the look of espresso. Tilting the glass reveals a slight transparency. Very active carbonation.  N- Obviously very heavy on the dark chocolate. The aroma of the malt is potent. It's obvious that a high percentage of specialty malts were used. I would say Biscuit malt, Sour malt, Black patent, and Chocolate (some pale, mostly regular). There is some woody hop aroma, spicy as well, red chili aroma. I also detect a dark-wood aroma.  T- First impression is dark fruit (plum, raisin, dates), and coffee. I'm not really getting the sweetness described by other reviews. It isn't too bitter, but the sour malt is a little on the heavy side. Of course there is a prevalent espresso flavor, accompanied by both dark chocolate and light chocolate, with a milky quality (lactic acid added perhaps). The chocolate is much more pronounced in the finish and aftertaste. Resting the sip on the palate and in haling opens up sour flavors and acidic espresso flavors. I like the way the flavors drastically change with each stage. Dark fruit remains subtly in the middle and finish (mainly raisin). The alcohol is barely noticeable in such a complex mix, really only detectable when the sip is swallowed. It is a dry stout, definitely a dry cracker note in the finish.  M- Heavy body, brightened by medium carbonation, but not too strong of a bite. Silky when going down the gullet. This is a beer to be consumed steadily, quaffing this quickly would be unenjoyable.  O- A very good stout, but I think there are better chocolate stouts available, and less expensive. Personally, I like a sour note in stouts, but this one has too strong of a sour taste. Like I said earlier, I'm almost certain that a high percentage of sour malt was used. There are a lot of great reviews, but in my opinion there is room for improvement. I would say the aroma and finish are the best aspects of the beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smell: Strong coffee aromas, with a smell of some sweet chocolate. Nice combination of aromas.  Taste: Full-bodied with great balance of malt and hops. There is a hint of chocolate, that smooths the overall flavor. The combination of strong hops and roasted malts and strong alcohol give this drink big powerful flavors.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, but very smooth, almost creamy.  Overall: Great stout. Best if you enjoy a combination both strong hops and malts. The label lists 10% alcohol, and it does taste like it.

Delicious aroma of dark chocolate from roasted and slightly smoked malts. Notes of earthy hops and espresso coffee. Intense flavor of roasted malts, earthy hops, cocoa powder and licorice. Notes of resin, peppery yeast and cream and dark chocolate. Dry aftertaste with its lingering bitterness from its roasted malts and hops. Liquorish body with low carbonation and tiny bubbles. 10% ABV is completely hidden. Great sipper for the wintertime. Exceptional beer, which gets better and better once it warms up. This was beyond my positive expectations. This one now and Sorachi Ace are my preferred brews from Brooklyn.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,hansavijaticar,4.75,"From bottle just few months old... That's very important to notice, because this beer is famous for it's aging potential and changing it's qualities from coffee and chocolate to dried dark fruits. Very dark brown with dark red hue. Smell and taste of coffee and dark chocolate, but it had already developed some prunes and raisins qualities. Full body. Syrupy, malty and sweet, but roasted/piney bitterness is still there. I love this beer. I might have tried better imperial stouts, but all of them were barrel-aged, so that doesn't count. By the aspectis of dried fruits it's very close to one of the most intriguining baltic porters I've tried, Porter Łódzki, but not so sweet and sticky. Have some botlles of different ages of it in my cellar waiting for tasting next winter.  Just opened the one that's already a year old and it's deliciously complex and with much more aspects of dried fruits.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,HistoricalMan,3.63,"Poured down the center of a Left Hand balloon glass from a 12oz bottle. The bottle doesn't have a birth date but the label does note that it's a limited 2012-2013 bottling.  Appearance: A thick, jet black pour settles with one finger of creamy mocha-colored head. The head slowly recedes and leaves a halo creamy foam. Some lacing.  Smell: Roasted malt, powdered chocolate, a hint of milk, bitter espresso, and some added sweetness from the alcohol.  Taste: A taste that matches the flavor; roasted malt, powdered chocolate, plenty of sweetness from the alcohol, and a fairly bitter finish. In fact, the finish isn't very smooth at all... very astringent and prickly on the palate.  Mouth: Medium body with light carbonation. I'm actually surprised by the astringent finish given the low carbonation.  A fairly decent imperial stout. I imagine the finish mellows out with time and at 10.00% ABV it should age fairly well. Overall, not my favorite chocolate stout but definitely something I'd be interested in purchasing again in the future.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,utopiajane,4.25,"Pours pitch black and a little thick with a tall head of mocha colored foam that fell slowly and looked so creamy. Left a nice cap and ring and plenty of shimmering lace. Nose is milky smooth with luscious chocolate. Decadent and a little boozy. Bold espresso and some mild dark fruit. Deep sweet roasted malt. The coffee is so fresh, touch of vanilla. Taste is scrumptious. As if you had fresh roasted espresso beans dipped in bittersweet chocolate. The palate bends to the dark will of this beer. The chocolate continues to send ribbons of it's bouquet to the nose. The dark fruit accents the roasted malt bitter and the malt is nutty like pecans. Warming alcohol and vanilla in the dry finish. Mouthfeel is full and smooth.  Strong flavors in this one that satisfy with every sip. Creamy like a milkshake with rich and complex flavors that area delight to behold in the glass. Although the chocolate is rich, it's the roasted malt that is the star of this show with it's pecan accents and molasses like smoothness. This is a new favorite.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Sweepz189,3.72,"Before I say anything, I need to say I got a case of this discounted because it's currently July 2013 and this is a winter style beer. I've seen this case in the distributor for months. They had it in the cooler for less that $30 so I figured I'd try it out. I like a good stout, even if it is hotter than hell outside. With that said, this beer is old, expired, and out-dated. Personally, I don't care.  A: Poured cold bottle into a glass, almost black with a very small head, very little carbonation left.  S: Smelled from the bottle before I poured it, strong acidic, alcohol and dark roasted malts, some chocolate, mostly bitter and alcoholic.  T: Almost knocked me out. Very strong, bitter, almost burnt flavor with extreme dark chocolate. I imagine if you ate an 80% cacao chocolate bar, it would be on that level of chocolate. Very alcoholic up front as well, taste more like an aged chocolate malt wine than a beer, but this is a stout, so I wasn't disappointed.  M: Not something you would grab to quench your thirst. Very heavy, barely any carbonation (again, this is old beer). Strong after-feel in the throat. I hate to put it like this, but I swear I mean it with the most respect and in the best way, it's like a night time syrup/elixir. Not like cough medicine, but it's thick and the alcohol content makes me, personally, drowsy. The best word I can think for mouthfeel and feeling in general is ""thick"". I took a nap after my first beer.  O: If I had tried this before, I never would've got a case. That's 24 of these bad dogs. I wasn't even thinking about alcoholic content when I got it. I'm still used to thinking all stouts are like Guinness; barely any alcohol content. After my Victory Brewing Imperial Stout experience, I realized stouts are highly alcoholic and are not the ""thirst quenching"" beer. On the bright side, this is very good beer, even though it's old. I never did find a date, but I remember this being in the store for at least 4 months and I remind you, it's July 2013. All the label on the bottle says is ""Limited brewing 12-13""so it was brewed last winter, since winter '13 hasn't yet passed. This would be nice to enjoy during it's seasonal run, on tap, with friends. One is all you need, remember, this is beer fit for royalty.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Fresh 09 bottle drank winter of 09/10.

T-the taste follows the nose initially and brings a light chocolate malt, a hint of roasted malt, slight warming from the alcohol, dark fruits come in next, the ripe plum and raisin, then you get a nice citrusy finish that balances this delicious beer out.  M-it is full bodied, not huge but still somewhat chewy, velvety smooth accompanied by the right amount of carbonation to give it a crisp finish  D-this is a great RIS, nice flavors throughout, not balanced but hops are in there, unbelievable mouthfeel and it hides the alcohol very well.

There’s lots of roasted malts up front, with some coffee notes, and again, as the name of the beer suggests, chocolate, but there’s also some hints of vanilla and caramel, as well as dark bread, and some very slight, very subtle dark fruit, finally, finished by some pleasing alcohol warmth. Very interesting.  Mouthfeel: Very, very, chewy, with a nice creaminess that coated the mouth very nicely.  Overall: Damn, this is a really good beer! But be warned this is totally a sipping beer, not a session beer! The high chewiness and alcohol content (this beer clocks in at 10% ABV) completely makes it an after dinner/desert/final beer of the night kind of beer.

Smell: Dark chocolate and caramel up front. Heavy dark fruit presence takes over with plum and fig, along with a touch of alcohol.  Taste: Starts off similar to the smell with cocoa, caramel malt, and dark fruit, but is amplified by strong coffee notes along with some molasses and more roasted barley. Flavors are developed extremely well - this is one intense, complex stout. Finish is semi-sweet with a touch of alcohol heat.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, rich feel. Medium to low carbonation (for my taste it would benefit with a little bit lower of a carb level).  Overall: A perfect example of a classic Russian Imperial Stout.

Smooths out somewhat later to a slightly more dark chocolaty bitterness.  m: Medium to heavy, velvety feel but the bitterness stands out.  o: Doesn't quite live up to the hype and rating for me, but then I'm not the biggest fan of really bitter beer.

Not thin by any means, but not as big of a body as some other stouts. Alcohol is a little warming.  O: This is a fine stout for a winter release. The warming alcohol and dark chocolate and malt profile is very welcome on a cold day, and still enjoyable even now in the summer months. This is the third bottle from a four pack I've had for some time, and in my opinion this bottle is a little past its prime.

45,680,tectactoe,3.78,"Vintage 04-05 bottling, thanks to Jeff. This baby is somewhere between 8 and 9 years old - let's see how it has held up. It pours dark as hell - black with only a slight bit of dark brown showing at the very edges. No head, literally none, even with a straight down pour. I guess that's what almost ten years in a bottle will do to you, eh? Very still and menacing in the glass, seemingly void of any carbonation.  The first glace, Black Chocolate Stout is a bit more pungent on the nostrils than I was expecting, and it actually contains a strong, almost boozy character. It's like rich, dark chocolate dipped in a booze bath. Lots of cocoa on the nose - some milky, some darker, with a touch of roasted malts on the side. Not getting much coffee and hops are probably long gone at this point.  So far, this doesn't smell so much like a Russian Imperial Stout as it does an American Imperial Stout, but maybe I'm just splitting hairs. Unfortunately some oxidation has gotten the best of this beer - or at least the aroma would tell me that. It invokes a slight sherry character, perhaps lending to the booziness, but it also has the slight smell of wet cardboard, slightly musty and stale. Hopefully it doesn't affect the taste too much.  Leading the charge of the first sip is a mound of smooth, sweet chocolate and a solid offering of boozy, dark fruit sweetness - figs, anise, and the darkest dates around. The roasty character takes a bit of a backseat, and oxidation is present from the middle to the end, again introducing both a mild sherry flavor and a bit of the ""stale, wet cardboard"" that is especially heavy in the aftertaste. Some sweet and dark chocolates help to balance this out, but I can't help but wonder how much better this beer would be fresh. Without carbonation, the mouth feel is pretty silky and smooth; full-bodied and pretty heavy.  It seems like this beer would age well if you could keep it from oxidizing. Hell, even slowing the oxidation down wouldn't be so bad. It was just a little too much, here, but the beer that lies underneath the oxidation seemed to be doing fine. I'd like to have this one again, fresh, just to compare. Very good stout, although there are plenty out there that I'd choose over this one.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smell: The aromas definitely give out hints of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, light dark fruit and some booziness.  Taste: Like the aromas, it has a some nice dark chocolate, roasted coffee notes, a light bitterness and faint dark fruit. The booziness becomes more prevelant as it warms.

T - Semi-sweet dark chocolate (reminds me of a dark chocolate Hershey's bar), roasted dark coffee beans, and mild bitterness. With a year in the bottle, the alcohol has really mellowed out. When I had a bottle from this batch a year ago, it was extremely boozy, but this is much more balanced.  M - Thick, syrupy body that clings all over the mouth, and low carbonation. Only a slight hint of alcohol. Somewhat chewy.  O - I'm glad I decided to keep this bottle from last year, as my main complaint about it last year was that it was so boozy.

Another year might have made it even smoother, but I don't think it's really that necessary. Goes down much easier when aged.  M - Nice medium to full body.

Aroma is very subtle but a pleasant burnt caramel/toffee, rich roasted barley with dark chocolate and a very slight hint of vanilla in the background...  This is a rich black full Imperial stout just the way they should be! think Guinness Foreign Extra Stout but then imagine that being more refined and smoother with a much more pronounced alcoholic but delicate warm finish wrapped around it....this is a nice beer!

45,680,timn,3.37,"A: Pours dark brown, almost black, with virtually no head whatsoever.  S: Smells burnt and boozy. As the beer warmed, I was able to pick up some licorice in the aroma as well. I really did not pick up any chocolate at all.  T: Tastes very boozy. The alcohol really takes charge here, along with the burnt flavor. As with the smell, as the beer warmed I got some taste of licorice and a very slight hint of really dark, bitter chocolate, but not much. The glaring abscence here is any real chocolate flavor. I expected a dark chocolate taste right up front, but it's just not there.  M: Mouthfeel is good. Pretty smooth and creamy, not too thick.  O: Overall, I'm a bit disappointed. There really isn't much chocolate to speak of in this beer, and the booze comes through so strongly it just seems to overpower everything else. This does seem to get a little better as it warms, but still a disappointment. The 10% APV at least gets you nice and warm.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

No appreciable head to the beer.  Smell: Prominent chocolate notes, but that's about it.  Taste: Upfront notes of chocolate and mild smokiness. Roasted malt throughout, ends with a slightly boozy finish.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, smooth, creamy.  Overall: Great stout with upfront chocolate influence.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,paulytasker,4.08,"Serving- Bottle poured into a snifter  A- Just about black as black can be, with a pretty dense blanket of tan head capping it off. Head doesn't appear to want to go away anytime soon, and is leaving behind quite the spider web of lacing. I dig it.  S- Well, so far there's no denying where the name of this one came from, as my nose has been bombarded by a boatload of chocolate. Next to the chocolate, there is a fair amount of roastyness, maltyness, goodness going on. A fruity scent lays low but I cant decipher what exactly it is. Smells like a big bad ass dark chocolate to me indeed.  T/M- Wow... the big chocolate and roasted malts that hit the nose are even more pronounced to the palate, maybe a little too much so. Not a big hop profile to this brew, but there are some hops there nonetheless. Pretty slick and creamy. The alcohol in this brew shows you who's boss and I kind of wish it was hidden a little better. A big brew, and an all night sipper for sure. The strong assault of roasted malts seems to tame a tad as the brew warms.  O- There is a lot to like about BCS, great smell, great use of chocolate, and a nice creamy mouthfeel. I think this brews full potential would be met after a few years in the cellar to help tone back the boozieness.

The brown creamy chocolate mousse head leaves plenty of lacing.    The aroma is boozy with a hint of chocolate and nothing else.    The flavor is up front and in your face with roasted malt and rich dark Swiss chocolate, followed with a surprising hop bitterness that could compete with any blackened IPA. This is an intense beer.  \  The mouthfeel is heavy and smooth and the alcohol is not playing hide and seek.    Overall this is a great beer that I would recommend to anyone that doesn't plan on flying an airplane, walking a tight rope or teaching quantum physics soon after consuming this brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

T- much more impressive than the smell. Probably the best ""chocolate"" stout I've ever had as it was not over done with the chocolate. Also taste some coffee in there. The alcohol is extremely well hidden, I can't even tell i'm drinking 10%, even a little.  M- Could have been smoother. I dont like too much carbonation in my stouts. And while it was not ""too"" carbonated, it could have been less.  O- Very well done, but not a game changer",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

A- Pours a viscous black body topped by a single finger of light brown head that recedes in about two minutes to a very thin cap, leaving behind some lacing.  S- Not a whole lot here, but there is definitely some chocolate, back by some coffee and a faint bit of alcohol.  T- The taste is far greater than the smell indicated. Chocolatey but not overdone. It is quite malty and there's a smokey component to it as well. It finishes with subtle dark fruit notes and a bite from the alcohol. That said, the alcohol is well-hidden compared to the last 10.0% beer I had (Ballast Point Victory at Sea).  M- The feel of this is very creamy.

A sweet aroma with some chocolate, light roasted coffee and some raisin skin.  T: Opens with a big, roasted chocolatey note. Rich notes of dark chocolate and roasted malt. Some anise, espresso, and a nice touch of oats on the finish. A nice, velvety mouthfeel works really well with the flavors here.

45,680,jifigz,4.64,"bottle poured into a pint glass  This beer pours a dark and deep black color with a nice off white head that lingers for a long time. It is whatever temp my cellar is, so it is definitely not fridge cold which is a good thing in my opinion. That really helps beers be themselves. Anyways, the aroma is boozy, chocolatey, slightly bitter with a touch of wet dog. The flavor is great. It is rich and bold and smoky and chocolate and stove ash all rolled together. It comes in waves and changes on the tongue and remains quite complex. There is a hint of bitterness on the end, but mostly alcohol. The MF is a decently light for style but still quite perfect.  A great beer. I am usually not a huge fan of Brooklyn, but a good job on this one.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mfnmbvp,3.98,"12 oz. bottle, winter 2012-2013 vintage. Drank a bottle of this stuff last year, and remember liking it a bit, but don't remember too much beyond that. So we'll see what the deal is again. Poured into a Firestone Walker pint glass.  A - Straight pour down the middle of the glass yields three fingers of beautiful chocolate mocha colored head. Gorgeous. Virtually opaque thick oily black body. Even some nice rings of lacing leftover.  S - Toasted chocolatey oat smell. Slight bourbon / vanilla /alcohol soaked wood type aroma begins to creep out. Not bad smelling, just not very impressive. I guess I just had high expectations.  T - Dark roasted malt profile, with even a bit of hop presence standing out. More of a dry powdery cocoa type taste leftover. Not much coffee bean bitterness happening, very much malt forward. Some alcohol presence makes itself known, but this beer is ridiculously smooth for being a 10.00% abv beer. Creamy vanilla flavors begin to appear as the beer warms.  M - Dry, bitter, powdery cocoa type feel.  Overall, a smooth creamy tasty beer, and one that deceptively masks it's 10.00% abv, yet I feel that there should be more going on here than there actually is. Perhaps it's a beer that will mature with age, so maybe I will have to cellar one to find out. I would personally prefer a North Coast Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout to this beer, so maybe a side-by-side tasting is also in order. Either way, Brooklyn Brewery Black Chocolate Stout is an enjoyable, highly drinkable stout, one any serious beer lover should try.

45,680,rawfish,3.53,"Pours viscous and black into a snifter. Finger high mocha colored head, tight bubbles with medium retention for a stout and thin lines of lacing on the glass.  Robust aroma of raw dark cocoa, licorice, dark fruit, roasted malt with some toffee sweetness, alcohol. Dark chocolate stands out as well a bit of sharpie too.  Roasted malt, ashy with light caramel sweetness to it, dark chocolate and an odd vinous fruit note and plenty of licorice. Not my favorite profile. Earthy bitterness on the tail end with a roasted aftertaste and plentiful booze.  Not quite astringent but the sticky roasted malt really extends the profound alcohol burn. Creamy on the palate with a typical imperial stout body.  Not bad, reminds me of Old Rasputin well crafted with lots of earthy licorice notes. A little green, could have waited 6 more months to crack this one, alcohol makes a big impact. Aroma is memorable. More chocolate and sweetness could push this beer up.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Then the sweetness of rasians, blending into roasted coffee. All this in a matter of seconds. There is a small stale cola taste in the middle.

A very noticeable increase in refinement. Flavor and aroma scores based on this aged bottle.  12oz bottle, '11-'12 Winter vintage. Pours a syrupy black with a thin layer of brown foam comprising the head. Alcohol is somewhat prominent on the nose, with cocoa and coffee-like aromas too. Semi-sweet chocolate flavors emerge courtesy of the roasted malt. and bitterness that's more reminiscent of coffee than hops emerges on the finish to provide balance to the flavor. Alcohol presence is there in terms of warmth but not flavor.  BCS is a a go-to Imperial stout of mine because of the high quality at a relatively low price. While not among the elites of the style, once it has some age on it, it truly becomes a great beer.

45,680,HabiMendes,4.05,"It is an absolutely black beer, with a super retained beige neck. The expresso/chocolate aroma hides very well the stunning alcoholic content of 10%. In terms of taste, we have a full-bodied beer that should emanate expresso and (dark) chocolate - exactly what we have here. The low carbonation pairs with a good hoppy presence to balance the toasted malt. The end is dry, hoppy, and brings the feeling of having an expresso. Very appropriate that what it proposes to be.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Head is a chocolate color and starts big before falling to a thin layer, leaving a thick wall of foam on the sides of the glass.  S- Deep dark chocolate. Some dark fruit (blackberry and plum) comes in the mix along with a little caramel. A tinge of booze barely shows itself, seems to be even less than when fresh.  T- Incredibly smooth and light up front with luscious dark chocolate middle mixing with burnt toast and other roasty flavors on the end. A bit of fruit shows as it warms but the alcohol isn't detectable in the taste despite the 10% ABV. Very complex.  M- Fairly thick and creamy. A bit milkshake like with low carbonation, a bit too low for my tastes.  D- A nice imperial stout with very strong chocolate flavor. The age seems to have played nicely with the flavors. Still the chocolate is a bit strong to the point where I wouldn't immediately reach for another.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Poured into a pint glass with 1 finger of tan head that quickly recedes to some light swirls on top. Pitch black, there is no light getting through this thing at all.  S: Dark malt and raisins coming through up front in the nose. Some alcohol sweetness comes out as well leading right into dark chocolate smell.  T: Slightly bitter dark malt right away followed by dark fruits, raisins and figs mostly. Next comes some alcohol sweetness and a little bit of bite. Then the after taste kicks in and it's all dark chocolate and warming alcohol from there. Finishes nice and smooth and begs you to take another sip.  M: Heavy and smooth mouthfeel with just enough carbonation to keep if from being sludgy. Seems just about right for the style.  O: This was my first experience with a RIS so I don't have a great benchmark to base this off of. With that said, everything I've read about this style is coming through really nicely in this beer.

45,680,zoober911,4.49,"13-14 bottle poured to tulip.  a - Pours a translucent black, with a small light brown head. When poured it appears to have a thin almost watery quality to it, but when in the glass and swirled it adheres to the sides a bit like a dark brown cough syrup would.  s - Chocolate nose is present in the forefront. Some slight toasted notes layered in.  t - Similar to the smell, the chocolate profile is very much upfront. This is followed shortly after with a slight booze character. The booze presence is very subtle. (As a side-note I drank a 12-13 bottle about a week ago and the booze characteristic was completely mellowed out and no longer present as an undertone.)  m - A moderately full mouthfeel. Not as full bodied as sometimes expected with a RIS but it is nothing to shy away from.  o - This should be a go-to for anyone looking for a year round RIS fix. It is definitely one of my favorites and well worth the price tag affixed to the bottle.

45,680,JK4Stout,3.97,A: Very nice black color with coffee colored head around the top. This bottle was aged (unintentionally...forgot it was under the stairs) so I can't speak too much to head.  S: A mild aroma of melted chocolate and just a tiny hint of fruitiness.  T: I have had this a time or two but have forgotten just how good it is. I was fairly impressed honestly. I had an Imperial stout last night that didn't make the grade as well as this. Great flavors and even smoothness.  M: Heavy side of medium and decent carbonation  O: I'm all in.

Carbonation low enough to get all of the creaminess and chocolatiness onto the palate. Rich and milkshake like.  O: Right up there with Old Rasputin in my book.

A tingle of light carbonation and a little alcohol warmth. Finishes slightly dry/bitter for a good balance.  O- The first thing I thought of, was that this was no where near the chocolate stouts I have had in the past. But then I read and realized that this chocolate stout (unlike others) doesn't actually use chocolate in it's recipe.

Guess the malts are really good. Some vanilla as well.  Thick, creamy mouthfeel- not the thickest imperial stout ever, but still pretty solid. Low carbonation.  Brooklyn's best beer, I think.

Tons of Roasty notes, chocolate and slight hop finish similar to Old Raspy.  M: Full bodied, plenty of carbonation for you belgian fans, and a slight bitter dry finish that isn't there in most stouts. Chocolate sweetness lingers as well.

O: 5: as a full disclosure, Brooklyn's BCS is my favorite RIS on the market; it also holds sentimental value for me as one of the first beers that addicted me to craft beer and sparked an interest in homebrewing (I brew a clone of it each year now); the chocolate and coffee aroma and taste are unparalleled with just enough hop flavor/aroma for balancing, maybe the best use of Cascade hops in a non-American IPA/DIPA; I'll continue to be cellaring and eagerly anticipating my vertical tasting in 5-10 years.

A - Pours slightly viscous, opaque black with a one-finger tan semi-rocky head that dissapates rather quickly. Average lacing  S - Aromas of roasted malts, coffee and milk chocolate, but dominated by the roastiness. Brown sugar sweetness.  T - Roasty malts, (still) low on the chocolate but its there, with a nice bitterness. No sweetness. The ABV balances this beer nicely, but be careful as the 10% alcohol is almost invisible to the senses.  MF - Medium bodied with a dry finish. Smooth, almost silky.   -------- 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  Not at all what I expected. Where is the chocolate? If its there, its faint. Maybe this brew needs some aging.

45,680,TheHammer,3.23,"Appearance: Black as night with a finger of head the laced well and retained quite admirably. True to it's name, the body is a black as night. A little bit more head and a bit more retention would have earned the perfect score.  Smell: I'm catching a light smell of dark bakers chocolate, and...that's it. I guess I can't complain, I mean it's called Black Chocolate Stout, but that being said, there is a lack of stout on the nose here.  Taste: There is an undertone of dark chocolate throughout the beer, and dominates the entire experience. It starts with some straw like malt, and then turns to come notes of charred wood with a slight alcohol solvent taste.  Mouthfeel: The alcoholic note I could use without but the carbonation does a good job of accenting things and keeping the beer a smooth ride. The dark chocolate really likes to linger on the back of the tongue though.  Drinkabilty: Well it's medium bodied to me and while I'm not a fan of dark chocolate it's taste is prevalent in the beer that someone who did like it would be pleasantly surprised.  Final Thoughts: I can't help but question this beer, I mean you'd think a beer that emphasizes chocolate taste would go for something sweeter, but it doesn't. You'd also think as an RIS more malt and other character would be there, but it's not. If you like dark chocolate or high cacao chocolate you will like this beer, I personally don't so it's not quite my thing.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

I get a semisweet waft of cocoa.  Taste: Chocolate really picks up in the taste. A kind of bakers chocolate. The overall taste is not too sweet, with the alcohol very well hidden.

It sort of slides down the glass back into the beer as time goes by.  S – Definitely chocolate, molasses, and dark fruits like plums and figs. Some roasted coffee is here, too, along with some alcohol.  T – Sweet nearly all the way through with chocolate, plum, fig, and some molasses. Some roasted bitterness creeps in and builds at the finish.  F – Full-bodied with good carbonation, a velvety, sticky, and creamy mouthfeel, and a bittersweet and slightly dry finish. Sweet chocolate and dark fruit and bitter roasted malt flavors linger. There is definitely some throat-and-palate warmth from the alcohol.  O – This is a good RIS. It’s not the best or most complex one that I’ve had, but it is exactly what is advertised – a black chocolate stout. Glad I got to try it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DocJitsu,4.38,"Pours an opaque, nearly black color with a dull mocha/khaki head that has a hydrogen-infused appearance. The aroma is very nice. A lot of coconut and sorghum up front. After the beer settles a bit, a lot of sweet, milk chocoate emerges. Mouthfeel is not as viscous as it looks. Very creamy with some sting around the edges of the tongue from a carbonation/hop hot/alcohol combination. A lot of chocolate flavor, contrasted by the smokiness. The smokiness dissipates as the beer sits. There's a bit of ripe cherry in there as well. I like it very much.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ironchefmiyagi13,4.33,"The restaurant I work at got this on tap recently so I decided to try it out.  For a RIS lover, I was very pleased with this beer. The color and density of the beer is dark and syrupy. Pours a very thick and creamy head that last around long enough to hold the aroma for smelling. The flavor, while tasty and drinkable, was just a tad sweet for my taste. You can definitely taste the chocolate, with the coffee shining through. I also tasted chocolate covered dark cherries and raspberries. Very interesting and appealing. Overall, I enjoyed this beer enough for a second glass. Great for sipping at the bar with friends. Will definitely drink again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,tekn0ph1sh,2.59,Poured out black thick and viscous. Poured from a bottle into my Duvel glass with Maybe a fingers width of reddish brown foam. It looked like tar or thick oil in my glass. It smelled like burnt cereal. All I could taste was burnt grain with a metallic after taste. It was so boozey and tasted like gasoline. I really do not like this RIS and regret I have another bottle to choke down but at least it's 10 percent and will cellar well. Maybe by next year it's taste will have improved and mellowed a bit. I could not taste chocolate at all. I would never buy this again and will think twice about buying another Brooklyn beer.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

T: Lots of chocolate flavors. Reminds me of nice quality chocolate bar mixed with nice glass of bourbon. Alcohol is up front but in a good way.  M: Creamy with nice carbonation especially for a stout. Easy drinking even considering the ABV.  O: Really nice beer.

45,680,beerme626,3.11,"Bottle from Good Foods in Lexington, poured into a stout glass. Appearance was absolutely gorgeous. Thick, black beer, but still with clear, tiny bubbles running up the side. Dark brown one-and-a-half finger head on top. Enticing. Everything else disappoints. The issue is, that unlike other high-alcohol stouts, this one is so obviously alcohol-y. The smell has rich notes of roasted malt and coffee, but it's entirely negated by the smell of... gasoline. The taste is the same way; rich, full tastes of roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee are cancelled out by the alcohol bite and feel. It's not cleverly disguised at all. The mouthfeel is higher because of the pleasant warm feeling. Overall, a bit of a disappointment. Other imperial stouts, like Old Rasputin and Choklat, are able to cleverly disguise the high-alcohol in the complex flavors. This is binary, and it doesn't work for me.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,CurtFromHershey,4.55,"Pours a near pitch black with reddish hues around the edges. Strong tan head which provides surprising lacing given the abv.  Smell is roasty, coffee like, slight hints of cocoa. Perhaps something slightly sour although not infection-ish.  Tastes like a quality bitter dark chocolate with a more coffee like aftertaste. Hints of dark fruit throughout, perhaps fig. Impressive.  Can't find anything I don't like about the mouthfeel. Thick, rich, silky, fairly strong carbonation for a stout. Lovely.

A: Pours an opaque dark brown with a thin, creamy mocha-colored head that fades away quickly.  S: Black chocolate is a very good description. This smells almost like a bar of dark chocolate with a bit of alcoholic heat in the background. Some faint molasses notes as it warms.  T: Unfortunately this one doesn't taste as good as it smells. Very bitter from start to finish -- reminds me of raw coffee grounds. The alcohol also comes through much more than expected. I remember enjoying this beer much more in the past, so perhaps I got a bad batch...  M: Full-bodied with a slick mouthfeel and a dry finish.  O: Definitely not one of my favorite imperial stouts.

Taste: Bitter and roasted. The main flavors seem to be dark chocolate and heavily roasted malts with a strong hop flavor. A slight alcohol taste is also there.  Mouthfeel: Heavy bodied with very light (almost none) carbonation.

The head dissipated into nothing but a small ring. This beer appears so still and silent. Even swirling and agitating it really does not create any head.  Smell: Roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, slight coffee, and some alcohol.  Taste: An over abundance of bittersweet chocolate malts dominate with a bit of char. Fairly sweet for a RIS and interestingly a bitter snap at the back end of the swallow. The bitterness actually does linger after the swallow a little. Alcohol is hidden very well.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. I think I'd want this by the appearance and taste to be more chewy but that's not what you get here. It does work ok but actually I find myself drinking it a little too quickly due to the thin feel.

Some roastiness here and smells pretty hearty. Flavor is heavy chocolate and some fruit. Lingering roast on the finish that explodes on the palate. Nice and creamy mouthfeel. Very good. Sweetness is there but balanced by the bitterness from the roasted flavor. Reminds me a lot of Stone's RIS offering, but like this one better. Really no alcohol presence despite the double digit abv.

The scent is subtle but has nice variation. Touch of vanilla and coconut, like many barrel aged stouts, there's evident chocolate malts and a touch of graham cracker.  The taste is of strong roasted malts, slightly burnt. There's a sweet vanilla middle that is fleeting and a hint of tinny alcohol at the end.  The mouthfeel is slightly thick and viscus, with a carbonated finish. This lends to my overall feelings in that I really enjoyed it but found the immense carbonation off-putting. I allowed it to ""air out"" like a wine and it behaved much better. Very strange.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,KFBR392,3.16,Appearance: Very dark but not as dark as other RIS I've had. A very delicious looking creamy head.  Smell: I little light here. I realize there shouldn't be a ton of aroma here but the subtle undertones were not there like I'd hoped. A little bit of the chocolate is here but overall not great  Taste: There are a few different things going on here but nothing is outstanding. A sweet licorice front lets the creamy aftertaste linger on the palette. The hop dryness comes in at the end and hangs around. The chocolate plays a role but is mainly undetectable. Not a traditional RIS  Mouthfeel: A creamy mouthfeel is here. The alcohol is hidden and the hop dryness is pleasant.  Overall: Decent.

Some dark fruit especially prune. Some smoke.  Has a dry wooden finish and the bitterness lingers. Not so much sweet as it is roasted.  No chocolate cake batter here or any creaminess, but pretty hot. Will put a few in the cellar.

45,680,portia99,4.04,"12oz bottle (Winter 12-13 vintage) poured into a Brooklyn snifter. Had this so many times...can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet.  A - Pours an opaque black color with dark, molasses brown highlights around the edges. A short cap of somewhat fizzy head lingers briefly and dies to a small mocha collar...lacing is sparse around the edge of the glass.  S - Roasty, coffee, a bit boozy, some dark fruits, bakers chocolate and cocoa. The cocoa and dark fruits are the biggest contributors in the aroma here.  T - Quite roasty in character. Tons of black coffee and burnt grains. Some astringency and charcoal and dark fruits. Bitter chocolate and cocoa.  M - Full bodied. Lots of char and a fair amount of astringency. Chocolate is very much part of the profile, but I wouldn't call it the dominant feature. Carbonation is mid-level and a touch tingly. Dry cocoa powder feel in the body comes thru more as the beer warms up a bit.  O - Very good imperial stout...a classic for sure. I've had so many outstanding imperial stouts lately that this doesn't stand out from the crowd that much. Still very good, but perhaps ""showing its age"" as its been around a while and some of the other IRS's out there seem to appeal a bit more to me.

45,680,Craigory,4.1,"Winter 2012-2013 release, poured from a 12oz bottle into a Duvel tulip glass.  A-- Pours thick and black, with a one-finger mocha head. The head recedes pretty quickly, leaving a thin ring on top of the beer. There's just a wee bit of spotty lacing. Standard appearance for an RIS.  S-- Lots of bittersweet chocolate on the nose, along with some burnt malt and a little alcohol. Pretty sweet-smelling, overall.  T-- Typical roasted malt and slight alcohol astringency that you get with many RIS offerings, but with a good bit of chocolate to boot. Brooklyn does not, I believe, use any actual chocolate sources or flavorings; all the chocolate flavor is coming from the malts. A little bitterness lingers on the tongue when each sip is done.  M-- Medium bodied, moderate carbonation; with a beer this black and chocolate-y, I'd appreciate something a bit more thick and chewy. Still, it feels (as well as tastes) good.  O-- Not the best RIS out there, by far, but a nice winter seasonal. Amongst all the other stouts flooding the market this time of year (a good thing!), Brooklyn Black Chocolate does stand out by getting so much chocolate flavor out of the malts.

Chocolate erupts on the palate, accompanied by dark fruits at the base, and ending slightly roasty and a touch dry. Dark cherry, dates, and figs are fairly pronounced, with light notes of coffee balancing.  Body is thick, almost syrupy, with low carbonation. There's significant alcohol warmth.

Classy, clean label, with nice info about the beer on a 12oz brown pop top. Into my Hennepin stemmed goblet.  Appearance: Pitch black, with a touch of ruby highlights in the bottom of the glass when held up to the light. Nice big tan head that shows good retention.  Smell: Lots of chocolatey fudge up front, with a bit of fruity booze. Really pleasant, but surprisingly no real roast; only detractor here is a lack of complexity.  Taste: Largely lacking the deep chocolately notes present in the aromas. Dark, fruity booze (hints of cherries). Dry roast (black malt?) on the finish . Some alcoholic heat, but not particularly hot. A nice imperial stout, though I'd lack a bit more richness and depth of flavor.  Mouthfeel: Medium-full, but not quite what I'd expect for a big RIS.  Overall: For between $9-10 a 4-pack, this isn't a bad RIS. The aromas are nice, as are the flavors, though both could use a bit more depth and definition.

A rich dark chocoalte with a cherry filling. Not overly long, but well layered.

Body is the deepest brown, nearing black, but a little light can be seen attempting to pass through on the edges. Leaves a bit of thin lacing.  Aroma is dark chocolate, heavy roasted malt, and a hint of dark fruit.  To get the full flavor, this beer must be allowed to warm a bit. Dark chocolate is the first flavor. This intermingles with dark fruit for a few seconds, than this phases out, allowing the chocolate flavor to take stage again, then plays off the heavy alcohol taste on the end.

S: Nice roasty, toasty chocolatetyness --also some hops coming through. More than I smell in most stouts. Nothing too special, but nice -- test will be in the taste.  T: Some crazy roasted malts / toasted grain flavor in the finish. Slighty bitter too. Definitely taste like tobacco. Hoppy. I'm not getting as much chocolate as I had hoped. Not bad or anything, but I don't think it is what it says. I really gotta look hard for the chocolate.  M: Nice carbonation. I'd say a medium body. Creamy and smooth -- more creamy. Little bit of chewiness. Good, but nothing that screams great.  O: I highly doubt this is an infected bottle, but this is called a Black Chocolate Stout and it should be called Black Tobacco Stout. Honestly, this needs more chocolate. I thought I detected it in the smell, but I knew the taste will tell the whole story, and the end wasn't great.

45,680,thehyperduck,4.2,"355 mL bottle from the LCBO purchased as a single (2012-13 edition); best before Oct. 2015. I wasn't really expecting to find something like this on the shelves around here, but once I discovered it, I quickly grabbed a few bottles - mainly because I've heard nothing but good things about this, but also because the price was right. Served only slightly chilled.  Pours deep black - totally opaque, not even any highlights under the light. At the surface rests somewhat less than a finger's worth of loose, frothy, brown-coloured head that recedes relatively rapidly over the next few minutes, leaving a soapy film at the surface, a modest collar, and some spotty smears of lacing. I get a lot of molasses and raisins in the aroma, alongside dark chocolate, roasted malts, and a whiff of ethanol. Appealing enough, with the aromas intensifying as it warms to room temperature.  Really tasty stuff, with molasses/caramel sweetness and vanilla to start off the sip, followed by some dark cherries and raisins (normally I'd just use the ethereal 'dark fruit' to describe it but I actually do get these specific two notes). The dark chocolate and roasted malts come through in force toward the end of the sip, with some herbal, roasty, vaguely smoky dryness rounding out the finish. There is a solid burn from the alcohol, but in the context of all the other flavours it works nearly as well as could be hoped. On the heavier side of medium-bodied, with mild carbonation that gently prickles the palate. Creamy and satisfying, with good warmth from the ethanol - helping to make this stout a perfect winter sipper.  Final Grade: 4.20, an excellent A-. There can be no doubt - Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout is one of the best imperial stouts I've ever had. At 10%, it's about as hot as you'd expect, so one bottle would probably be enough for me on any given night, as the alcohol and sweetness combine to make something that is clearly better suited to sipping than sessioning. Still, it's a bargain at its LCBO price ($2.65/bottle), so I would suggest stocking up before they run out. Canadian winters are pretty long, after all.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TubaManJack,4.22,Fresh Bottle and one for cellering for next year.  Appearance - Wow its quite thick and black as night. A great brown head that is retained. The opaqueness is impressive and ready to suit the style.  Smell - Yes this is delightful. The mocha body and licorice is really impressive. There is not a whiff of the solvent abv which is detected in many of the other RIS.  Taste - The flavor is rounded out and full of chocolate malt and really smooth. Its pretty straight forward but well executed.  Mouthfeel- Mmm light carbonation with a touch of its round body. Its buttery and velvety.  Overall this a great seasonal and an awesome RIS modification.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,decimator,4.03,"355ml bottle poured into a Stella Artois goblet. ABV 10%.  A - Poured a nearly black opaque dark brown with a 2cm milk chocolate head. Head slowly reduces and there's good lacing.  S - Lots of dark chocolate, some toasted bread, some dark fruit, and some alcohol.  T - Brown sugar, dark chocolate, some toast, hint of fruit, bitter hops and some booze.  M - Medium carbonation, medium-heavy body, creamy, syrupy, some heat in the finish.  O - A bit boozy but it's pretty well balanced. Easy to drink for sure.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,AmitC,4.53,"My second out of 4-pack of 2011 Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout.  One year on it. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my large snifter.  Very thick, dark brown colored pour. Pitch black inside the glass. Dark and opaque. A shining brown colored fluffy one finger thick head that slowly dissipates into a thin shining ring. Awesome lacing. Bubbles not to be seen.  Aroma: Toned down alcohol, i would assume. Well mixed with dark roasted malts and chocolate aroma. Very slight caramel. Some hop-alcohol mixed nose that is typical of Russian Imperial Stouts.  Taste: Roasted malts and dark chocolate taste. Some slight bitterness, that i would assume is subdued due to age on this one. Sweet-bitter dry finish. Alcohol is not felt as much as it contains. Less of burnt up malt flavor.  Mouth feel: Full bodied yet very drinkable thinness feel. Moderate carbonation. Slight alcohol derived astringency.  One more brew that makes Russian Imperial Stouts so reputable and likable.  Style Rate: 4.5 Personal Rate: 4.5",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,cjoc83,4.08,"Bottle from a 4-pack purchased at Wegmans for $9.50. Pours like motor oil into a chalice, opaque black with a 2 finger slightly billowy milk chocolate head that sticks around for a few minutes before receding to a ring around the glass that leaves some pretty nice, albeit spotty, lacing.  Obviously big chocolate notes in the nose, along with the typical dark fruit notes of a RIS, some sweetness, a little alcohol.  Milk chocolate sweetness and brown sugar hit the tongue first, segueing nicely into rum soaked figs and raisins, molasses, and an earthy, floral hope note. Finishes with some bitter bakers chocolate and a small hop bite and slight heat, but for the abv, the alcohol is pretty well hidden.  Rich and chewy, low carbonation. Spot on for the style.  I picked up a 4-pack of this for the first time in a couple years, and I'm picking all types of things I wouldn't have noticed 2 years ago. Just goes to show how ever changing our palettes are when it comes to this thing of ours. A super solid RIS, very rich and creamy, great flavors all around.

Look: This beer was black as night and very viscous. A nice creamy brown head formed to my surprise. Lacing was everywhere.  Smell: Smooth chocolate and coffee notes. Toasty character with some toffee notes that came through.  Taste: First was creamy mocha with an earthy roasted malt kicking in around the middle. Than things were switched up with a short lived bitterness that lead into a smokey finish. The coffee returned in the aftertaste. Mouth feel was very full and smooth. No alcohol warmth to be found.  I found this to be a wonderful RIS. I’ve heard a few different people say this is actually contract brewed by Saranac. Regardless, it’s a nice winter treat.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,johnso98,3.41,"Winter '12-'13. Not the best chocolate stout I've ever had, or even chocolate beer for that matter. When the chocolate taste does come through, it is enjoyable. But this stout doesn't exactly match up to Guinness Draught.  A - A great black color with a dark brown head. S - Initially smelled of chocolate, then turned nasty T - Initially of chocolate once again, then became muddled with all kinds of flavors that I can't really discern, but was not enjoyable. Ultimately finished with some more warm dark chocolate. M - It's drinkable. The taste is very inconsistent though, which does sort of affect mouthfeel. The alcohol is not noticeable until the finish, but that's normal. O - Brooklyn makes some other beers that I like a lot, so I had higher expectations for this one. At this price, I probably would not get this again. A 22oz bottle of Rogue's chocolate stout would've been a much better investment even if it meant half as much beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,suspect,4.18,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Bruery Tulip.  A: Deep dark black pour. Aggressive pour leads to a monster 3 finger cocoa whipped cream head that fades ever so slowly leaving the thickest lacing trail I've ever seen.  S: Cocoa, coffee, molasses, some hop bitterness.  T: Nice chocolate and coffee mix. Almost like a strong mocha. ABV finds it's way to the way back of the throat in the flavor.  M: Perfectly carbonated, nice mostly big body.  O: Nice sipping winter beer. One of my all time favorite beers from one of my all time favorite breweries.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Callaghan,4.08,"A: Bottle is from the 2012-2013 winter brew. A hard pour into a chalice gives a nice two finger head, which is straight up brown. The beer itself is black as could be. Watching the head settle looks almost like a nitro pour. Beautiful.  S: Dried plums, alcohol, and chocolate of the baker's variety. Not much sweetness here. It promises to be quite tasty, as there are a bunch of underlying notes, but I can't can't pick them out. I did notice some roasted malts as it warms up.  T: Balanced and the alcohol matches well to the other flavors. Obviously, chocolate is the main flavor, but it's hard for me to discern the other flavors. it kinda just hits all at once, and I can't separate them. But, I like the way it tastes. I would give a higher score if I didn't feel like the flavors were mauling my tongue.  M: Smooth as any stout I've had, like a good oatmeal. Light carbonation, silky and full-bodied. Afterwards, though, it hangs around a bit longer than I like. Otherwise, It's about perfect.  O: A very good beer, and one that I have come to really enjoy. I will save a 4-pak in hopes that in about a year, maybe some sweetness will come through, or the subtle flavors will pull through a little stronger. And at 10%, it hides it extremely well.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TheSixthRing,3.78,"Appearance - Pours jet black with dark, ruby brown edging where light can penetrate. The head is a deep tan, 2 fingers thick and with great retention. Fair lacing, though a more or less spotty.  Smell - Notes of sweet chocolate, hints of smoke, earth and a faint hint of sweet berry.  Taste - Follows the nose for much of the way. Starts with sweet chocolate and subtle hints of berry. Earth and anise flavor creep in mid-way, before it finishes with light bitter bakers chocolate and some heat from the alcohol.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, though the carbonation comes across with a light, creamy fluffiness.  Overall - Not overly impressed with this beer. It's a good, solid brew, but there's not much complexity, and the flavors don't quite hit the mark the way other chocolatey Imperials do. It certainly didn't live up to expectations, and maybe that's part of the problem. If it made it out to the West Coast, I'd probably buy it again, but it's definitely not a beer I'm going out of my way to get again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,thlayli87,3,Pours a deep opaque black with a razor-thin head. No lacing. Smells of dark chocolate. Tastes very boozy. Smokey with some chocolate notes. Mouthfeel dominated by searing alcohol.

45,680,twiz1,4.7,"I may be crazy but I swear they have changed the recipe on this beer since I first tried it several years ago. I find this beer relatively hard to find, strangely most New Yorkers that I know (even some beer lovers) have never ever even heard of it.  Anyway, I know this has always been an RIS but I feel like it had more chocolate in it in years gone past. I honestly wish I had one from last year to compare. That being said, still a great beer, lovely on the tongue, a crisp stout finish and really not much to complain about (unless you hate stouts).

45,680,InVinoVeritas,4.52,"Bottled winter 2011-2012  A: Black opaque in color as to be expected of the style. Great head for such a high-octane beast! Head is tan in color. Minimal lacing, as expected. This maybe which may be the only visual detriment; at least for me it’s a small minus.  S: Sweet and here comes the Chocolate. There is a tad roasted malts, and toffee flavor. On a deep inhale there is just a hit, infinitesimal heat, perhaps the only hint of the alcoholic.  T: As the smell would indicate. However, there is no boozy taste whatsoever.  M: Is surprisingly creamy, almost milk stout like, but that could just be me.  O: This is a very solid, in fact one of the best RIS I’ve had. It is remarkably balanced, complex and extremely drinkable.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

T - Very well-rounded IS. Strong and complex pushing bitters and chocolate to the forefront. Alcohol warms the palate.  MF - Medium/Heavy bodied, medium carbonation. Very silky, so it coats the mouth very well.  O - What a great RIS for a beer enthusiast to enter the subclass. I would choose either Old Rasputin or Brooklyn BCS to represent the category (Not as the best, but as a well-rounded representative of what the group has to show).

M - Definitely full-bodied with a syrupy tongue coating viscosity...light carbonation...smooth. Would love to try this on nitro or cask...it would be so creamy.  O - This is a great RIS that is perfectly balanced...I'd like to do a vertical of this to see how they mature...but I don't think I could stand to save any.  Really happy I scored a case this year.

T - 3.75 - Not particularly sweet, surprisingly. Cacao nibs. Ends with something coppery and bittersweet chocolate. I'd like for it to be more complex.  M - 3.75 - Thinner than expected and thinner than it looks when pouring. Short of medium bodied.  O - 3.75 - This is a mature stout in the sense that it doesn't try to be sweet and syrupy and isn't afraid to be bitter in that darkest chocolate sort of way. I think it could actually use a bit more body and silkiness.

Smell is a little muted. Mostly dark chocolate, toast, some nutty notes.  Taste, lead is heavy bitter to bitter sweet chocolate. Then it fades into, well, sort of a mess. Not bad by any means but I really can't pick anything out. It's a soup of stout flavors fighting each other. I had no problem drinking it, actually quite easy drinking, but it seemed a bit messy.  Mouthfeel is top notch. Thick, rich, optimal carbonation. This aspect really manage to make up for the messy palate and makes it very easy to drink.  Overall - although it's not really complex stout, it seems that this one would benefit from some age to let the flavors figure themselves out.

45,680,shanemcp,4.7,"Let me first start by saying that I love dark chocolate. Let me also say that I love stouts.  I've had many a stout that claim to taste chocolatey or mocha-ish, but this is by far the most authentic ""chocolate"" stout I have ever had (dark chocolate to be precise).  I first drank this beer by sampling it from the glass of a friend who, knowing I like a good chocolate stout, offered it to me hesitantly knowing I would be floored after drinking it. And they were right.  It starts out smooth but the rush of flavor doesn't wait long to hit you. The chocolate flavor is perfectly balanced by the bitter taste from the alcohol (enhanced by the high level of alcohol I think) as it simmers on your pallate it gives you just enough time to ask yourself if you just drank the perfect chocolate stout or ate the perfect piece of dark chocolate.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

I savored each sip really looking for good or not so good. Well, this stout does not disappoint. Rich Chocolate mixed with barley and malt. A serious treat of a stout. Alcohol taste to me was not overbearing at all. Goes down very smooth but beware!! This brew packs a wallop. I had 4 bottles in about 2 hours or so and you will feel it. Have to many and your not going anywhere!! At least not me. A great cold weather brew. At $7.99 a 4 pack, it is well worth it. I wont drink it all the time, but treat myself now and then.

Hardly any head on this one. Maybe a quater inch dark tan head, dissapated quickly. Little to no lacing.  S - Burnt chocolate and alcohol. I was more excited to try this before I smelled it.  T - Touch of pitted fruits up front which quickly turns into lingering bitter burnt chocoolate and alcohol. I'm not getting much chocolate if any. I wish I tasted more chocolate. The burnt taste is really heavy to me on this one. I'm wishing I aged this now.  M - really smooth mouthfeel, little carbonation.  O - This one is a sipper.

45,680,KKB,4.05,"A - Looks like syrup as I pour it. Just about as close to being black as you can get without actually getting there. A nice tall...basically brown head. Looks tasty.  S - Delightful smell. Chocolate and coffee, charred malt, a little bit of licorice that could be brought on by the high ABV and thus the alcohol might be coming through in the nose a bit. Overall, very nice though.  T - I read a couple of my more respected reviewers before I set in on this beer, and one said that he thought the alcohol was too noticeable. I actually disagree, I think that the alcohol contributes to the flavor. The flavor is rather robust, even for a RIS. Coffee and chocolate dominate the palate. With chocolate definitely being the most prominent. Not much in the way of complexity, but sometimes simple is what you want. Tastes good brotha.  M - Mouthfeel is spot on, very rich, low carbonation, just the way that mama made it.  O - Overall this is good. I enjoy this and am not at all disappointed.

I bought a four-pack of this back in 2008, and I thought it was pretty nasty. Fresh, I imagine it is still pretty nasty.

45,680,JamesMN,4.5,"Appearance: Completely opaque black liquid with a modest one finger light brown head that head quickly dissipated. Leaves some lacing.  Aroma: Classic RIS nose. Lots of dark malts and a hint of alcohol. Roasted notes. Not getting much more chocolate than a usual RIS.  Taste: The first sip is a sensory experience that only this style can provide. Completely robust and flavorful. You simultaneously get dark roasted chocolate, black coffee, currants or other dried fruits, and a subtle earthy hop presence. The hop profile and resulting IBUs work very well to cut through the heaviness of the malt bill and give a brightness to the palate among all the darkness. Don't taste any of the 10% ABV but feel a nice warmth after each sip. Finish is bitter and dry. My only complaint is that the chocolate isn't as present as I thought it would be based on the name.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and highly drinkable for the style. Full to thick in body.  Final Thoughts: A near perfect beer and great representation of the style.

45,680,sixtyminute,4.3,"This is my first review, and I am not an extremely versed stout drinker, so keep that in mind when factoring this review into your decision about whether or not to try this beer. We all gotta start somewhere...  Glass - Snifter  A - Pours a very deep brown/coffee color with very minimal head which quickly dissipates. Roughly opaque as dirty motor oil. Moderate lacing fades slowly down the glass between sips with small retention around edges.  S - A toasty chocolate aroma with a hint of tree bark and roasted dark malts. Perhaps even a little raisin. The scent of alcohol is present and slightly distracting for the first few sips, but I found my senses quickly adjusted to appreciate the smells in concert with one another.  T - The chocolate aroma translates into a more subtle flavor, giving way to more of a charred taste which I might describe as the beer version of the flavor that comes from a wood-fired pizza oven. At a 10.0%, the alcohol is a little bit out of balance for the first few sips. It may be off-putting to other non-stout drinkers such as myself, but I strongly encourage you to stick with it before ruling out the taste as not to your liking! Also, I found the taste to be more palpable at a temperature slightly above what I'm used to, so maybe try that out if you're not feeling it.  M - I am not used to judging mouth feel, but I would say I haven't had many thinner-feeling beers that are as dark or darker than this. Leaves a semi-sticky aftertaste that somewhat coats the mouth in a coffee grounds flavoring.  O - Very pleased with this seasonal offering from Brooklyn Brewery. It is not exactly up my alley, but represented itself and its style very well. I see myself sipping this one again in a long session as I read or do work late at night. I will probably not have a reason to buy another 4 pack, but I would definitely recommend it, and would jump on trying it if I saw it somewhere on tap. If I had only gotten a couple sips of this, my opinion would be totally different, so all your non-stout drinkers, stick with this one!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,GossageBrewery,4.46,"Poured this Russian Imperial Stout from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This stout poured a dark black color, produced a light brown head, featured excellent retention and left a very nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consists of dark chocolate, fresh ground coffee beans, and some grape/wine like fruitiness. Full bodied, this stout was extremely smooth and creamy. Very nice mouthfeel. Foundation of roasted malt, espresso beans, dark chocolate, alcohol, and grape/prune fruitiness. I would classify this brew as a winter warmer- something to keep handy on the first blustery cold night in December. Excellent example of the style, its a big beer but not so big that you have to force your self to finish the session.

45,680,ThisWangsChung,4.18,"Old ratings: (5.0/4.0/4.5/4.0/4.5)  Brief write-up for a 2012 vintage. Though I was disappointed this beer poured practically no head, it made up by being a lot more chocolaty than I remember from the aroma. I still enjoy how it transitions from sweetish dark fruits to a roasty finish, all while staying in balance. Surprisingly complex, especially in comparison to its ""readily available imperial stout"" brethren, such as Yeti and Old Rasputin. No frills, but very well crafted - the only real flaw is that the alcohol isn't hidden spectacularly.  ----  One of the beers I picked up to commemorate my parents' anniversary. Poured into a Williamsburg Winery red wine glass.  A: Has a pitch-black body with a beautiful, dark mocha-colored head. The light has no chance against the body of this beer. The head has excellent retention for 10% (seriously, it's confusing) and fantastic lacing that just won't go away.  S: Really nice smell of roasted malts and dark chocolate. A bit of booze adds to the character of the beer.  T: Oh my. This is stunning. The dark chocolate and chocolate malt notes are amazingly executed, and a bit of roasted maltiness keeps it in check, as well. Great complexity and balance makes this an incredible slow-sipper. Maybe the booziness is a tad strong, but it's otherwise hard to tell it's 10%.  M: Borderline silky smooth with good thickness and a slightly dry finish. A bit warm from the alcohol, but it adds to the character wonderfully.  O: This was $8.50 for a 4-pack? For the quality, this is a fantastic value! It's one of the finest slow-sipping stouts I've had. If I had to nitpick, I'd say it could be a touch less alcoholic, but who cares?! If you're a stout fan (or a beer fan, for that matter), get this immediately.  (5/4/5/4/5)",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

M: A tad hot, but stops short of being unpleasant. Friction/graininess of dark hot chocolate is interesting. O: This one could use some time to mellow. I wouldn't buy again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Kooz,3.74,"Sorry for the stunted review, but until there's an app, it's going to be hard to review beers from bars and restaurants...  Poured dark, almost black with a chocolate brown head and lacing. Perfect.  Smells sweet (but not overly so) and malty. Nothing amazing, but better than average.  Tastes sticky and chocolatey with a sweet aftertaste like sweetened condensed milk. It tastes more like a milk stout than an imperial.  Good body, very nice. Foamy and creamy, and leaves a stickiness in your mouth that lets the flavor get a little more complex after drinking it.  Overall, it's very good. I'd drink this anytime, anywhere.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,superspak,4.1,"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled 9/15/2010(over 2 years). Pours pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, char, toast, molasses, raisin, prune, earth, and light coffee. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, char, raisin, prune, toast, molasses, earth, and light coffee. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, prune, raisin, char, roast, molasses, and earth on the finish for a good bit. Good depth and balance of flavors; no cloying on the finish at all. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial stout. Good depth, complexity, and balance of flavors; fairly smooth to sip on. Very enjoyable to sip on slowly.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Powderhornphil,3.9,"Really a nice looking stout. Looks full with some appearance of viscosity. Small amount of lacing and a mocha head.  Smell of dark chocolate. Maybe some coffee, espresso notes too.  Tastes of its namesake. Chocolatey sweetness. Some caramel sweetness. Leaves some bitterness on the finish. Really like the taste. Also just a touch of booze on the finish. I will be interested to taste this with several more months on it.  Mouthfeel is smooth and silky with minimal carbonation.  Edit, coming back to this beer 7 or 8 months later. Really have to downgrade taste. A lot of the chocolates have dropped off an given way to dark boozy fruits.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S- chocolate, dark fruit and alcohol sweetness.  T- bitter chocolate on the cold side, tons of dark fruit after it warms up. A lot of flavors hitting the palate, helped my the small bubbles, most are a sweet dark fruit flavor. Not much alcohol taste.  M- Surprisingly thin mouthfeel with moderate amount of carbonation.  O- tastes nothing like I remember. The dark chocolate flavors have faded and given way to a Complex dark fruit flavor. Given the thin mouth feel and the more fruity flavors that have developed, this could easily be mistaken for an Old Ale. Pretty good.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,GMB,3.53,"Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout is as awkward as its name. ""Dark chocolate"" is the idiom; what is ""Black Chocolate?"" Or is it ""Black Stout?"" Aren't they all? Perhaps the brewers are trying to suggest that this beer is beyond dark. That is, it is so dark it's black. Perhaps. But, like its name, something about this beer seems slightly off.  Its pour suggests as much. Even held up right against a strong light source, the body of this black beer doesn't allow any light to shine through. Its mocha head rises and falls quickly. Nice.  The nose presents the first conundrum. The deep, roasted aromas of chocolate and coffee are there, but right in the middle sits the strong smell of alcohol. At 10.0% ABV, this is to be expected, but the smell doesn't seem well-integrated.  The taste is similar. The chocolate malts are delicious. Hints of prunes and raisins tease the palate, but are overpowered by the taste of alcohol. The flavors are not in balance here. I like a beer with a high ABV, but the alcohol must play a palpable role. In this case, the malt flavors and bittering hops are nicely balanced, but the alcohol is clumsy.  The mouthfeel is what one expects from a beer with a full body and no substantial head: Rich and chewy, but not entirely satisfying.  Black Chocolate Stout is not a beer I'd buy again. I tried pairing it with foods that generally do well with Russian Imperial Stouts. Dark mint chocolate was the only one that could stand up to it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,planet_rob,4.55,"This beer has become my favorite for now. Delicious from the bottle or in a glass. Goes excellent by itself or with a meal (it's almost a meal in and of itself).  My rating speaks for each of the categories. This is a great beer, just like I like them: Dark, thick, strong and tasty.  For an even better experience, pour this into a snifter, or heck, even just a glass, and don't be gentle with the pour as it releases a creamy smoothness that makes this beer even better than it is straight from the bottle.  This beer is now my favorite, not just for now, but probably for good.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,KeshiaM,4.83,"This is a superior Imperial stout.  When I poured it it formed a thin, mocha head that faded quickly but left no lacing. This stout is black as black can be even against light.  It has a strong chocolate, coffee smell that is a rich as the taste  Speaking of taste, intense chocolate with a hint of vanilla and caramel. The alcohol is strong but it never overwhelms the taste. Just leaves a lingering booziness.  The mouthfeel is a little thin for a stout but it doesn't detract, at least not for me. Light carbonating keeps it from getting heavy towards the end.  Overall I loved this stout. I let it sit to warm up and it brought out every taste it had. A complex yet very drinkable beer. Be careful though, at 10 percent this beer sneaks up on you fast.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Here it goes:  A: straight up opaque, totally blocks out the light of the light of the lamp, 1/4 inch caramel head that stays pretty much until you finish it.  S: very chocolatey, can pick up the alcohol too  T: Blast of chocolatey flavor, vanilla, caramel, smoke, can feel the warmth of the booze, taste it too  M: Surprisingly light, some carbonation, can feel the warmth of the alcohol.  O: Overall its very good, especially for being vintaged, very complex and smokey, very chocolatey, very good. Worth a shot.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Dennoman,4.2,"Bottle BBF September 2014, poured into a snifter. One of the easier to get imperial stouts in Europe. Extremely popular in the US it seems as the go-to off the shelf impy.  A: Pitch black, mocha-colored dark head that disappates very quickly for a 10%, perhaps a little quicker than I'd like.  S: Booze, roasted malt, dark chocolate, slight coffee and bitter hops.  T: Nice roasty bitterness with a little sweetness from the booze.  M: Due to medium (high) carbonation this stout is a little thinner than I perhaps would like. Still very lush though.  O: Perfectly lives up to its reputation, and then some.

45,680,thebigredone,3.48,"I had high hopes for this one.  Appearance is nice, dark black/brown with a thin white/cream head.  Smell is decent, but not overly roasty or chocolatey.  Taste follows suit, some roasts, some dark chocolate, but for a beer called Black Chocolate Stout neither the chocolate nor the black roast stands out.  The mouthfeel is where this really fails. Not creamy or thick by any stretch. Very thin and watery.  Overall, I am dissapointed with this beer. The thin mouthfeel and weak flavors did not live up to my admittedly lofty expectations.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,flyingpig,4.16,"Dark and thick looking opaque black with a dark tan to light brown colour head about a thumb width tall to begin with before slowly settling to a thin lacing around the sides of the glass after about two minutes.  Strong, rich chocolate aroma with some roasted coffee and rich malts backing this up. There is some noticeable alcohol on the nose as well but nothing overpowering and too strong. Some sweetness, sugar, raisins and dates.  Creamy chocolate and rich, dark malts to begin along with some medium strength coffee and a hint of alcohol. There is some cocoa and a touch of malty caramel that backs up the hints of sweetness throughout. An excellent beer.  Dry and medium on the palate with a full body and a touch of grain. There is some alcohol noticeable throughout but nothing unexpected from an Imperial stout really.  A very good beer and one with a lot going on, definitely one of the best Imperial stouts I have ever tried and one I hope to try again at some point in the future. The only slight downside was in fact the dryness in that it was slightly too dry for my liking but certainly not enough to put you off the beer. At 10% it's not an everyday beer but it is one everybody should try at least once.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,kevanb,3.85,"2011-2012 bottle poured into a half pint glass. Review from notes.  The beer pours a like motor oil, thick, viscous, almost syrupy. Jet black in color, faint hints of brown when struck by the light, only the smallest head appears, darker coffee brown color, very tiny bubbles and it recedes quickly. No real retention here, a faint layer of film appears, no true lacing to speak of. A lot of roast in the aroma, charred chocolate and toasted coffee are huge components, rich, sweet malt plays with the chocolate very well, hint of faint alcohol in the nose. The flavors are also strong on the roast, bitter dark chocolate, roasted coffee, strong burnt malt flavors, a striking amount of astringent alcohol is present as well. Some dark fruits do make an appearance as the beer warms that helps to mellow out the burnt flavors, but the alcohol persists and detracts a bit from their effect. The body is spot on, thick, rich, creamy, just about perfect for this style of beer.  Verdict: Solidly done imperial stout from Brooklyn. The alcohol in the flavors suggests to me that it needs some time to mellow out, but it's great to drink now as well, definitely a great winter beer, and one I will enjoy year after year.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,quaybr,4.25,"Well, this beer isn't messing around. Served in a snifter at around 50 degrees.  Sits like motor oil with a head of tiny brown bubbles that dissipate to a ring around the edges.  Smell of chocolate and roasted malts, with a hint of alcohol.  Taste follows the malty aromas. As the beer warms dark fruits become unmistakably present. This is enormous.  Mouthfeel seems rather similar to the motor oil described above. Thick, slightly creamy, and leaves a bit of residue.  Nothing like gearing up for autumn than with sipping a beer like this with friends on the porch. This is an unapologetically big beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Poured into a snifter.  A- Pours black as night letting no light through, with a very small amount of dark mocha colored head that quickly went away.  S- The usual suspects of dark roasted malts and dark roasted coffee. A little boozy. Little bits of dark chocolate coming through not much though.  T- Starts off with heavy flavors of dark roasted malts, and move on more chocolate flavor than the nose lets on. Finishes with a strong black coffee taste. The aftertaste is just like a chocolate covered expresso bean. Wonderful.  M- Just like a RIS should be. Smooth and highly drinkable at the 10% ABV. The flavors that stick to the palate are great. A mix of chocolate and coffee.  O- Wish I had a newer bottle of this to compare it to. I really enjoyed this one.

45,680,rodlavers,4.08,"Old Review: Poured from bottle into Westvleteren tulip. This is the winter 2011/2012 vintage. Less than a finger of dark mocha head thins out to almost nothing, leaving the glass looking like a cup of black coffee. I have to say the color is pretty much black, but if I look closely enough at the edge of the beer in the glass, I can make out some dark browns and reds. Smell consists of sweet coffee with loads of brown sugar, bitter chocolate, sweet floral notes, maltiness, maybe some molasses. For me, the taste is dominated by bitter chocolate and artificial coffee. There are hints of oatmeal, malt, and this metallic flavor that I'm not a fan of, probably just the bottle. Mouthfeel is rendered bitter and sharp as a result, unfortunate because I bet this is much better fresh, but do not know for sure. I give this a 4 overall, and hope to have a fresh bottle in the winter.  Re-reviewing this beer, 12-13 vintage. Poured into a Founders snifter. Huge dark tan three finger head, spills over. Recedes to a thin layer with some dark tan lacing. Almost black in color, looks like an amazing stout.  Aroma is rather subdued, not too different from what I remember last time. Nonetheless, roasted malt dominates, with chocolate and coffee notes to follow. Smell intensifies as beer warms.  For taste, re: smell. Though at first, chocolate is ever-so-slightly present. What I get most is malt, roasted malt, and more malt. Chocolate and coffee are very much secondary. As it warms, which I recommend, chocolate becomes much more noticeable and enjoyable.  Mouthfeel calms down too as a result of warming up a bit. Very smooth and sweet.  Overall, this is a very decent stout, but recommend enjoying after a bit of warming. Cheers.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Appearance: Pours a nice dark chestnut brown with mild red clay hues. Thick as night with 2-3 fingers of head. Settles to a fat creamy ring with some lacing.  Smell: Alcohol soaked raisins, oatmeal cookies, chunks of chocolate, dates.  Taste: Begins with a rich decadent chocolate with a nice espresso but the finishes with an abrasive and chalky chocolate flavor. Permeates for a good while but when warm it's better and has a sweet macadamia nut flavor.  Mouthfeel: Bitterness gets to the enjoyment of this. Harsh and though it smooths out, it still leaves a not so pleasant impression.  Overall: Have had this at 3 separate occasions and not entirely impressed. There are better ones out there for sure.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,RichD,4.36,An 11-12 vintage poured into a snifter.  A: Pours a deep black with a small mocha colored head. This is what imperial stouts are supposed to look like.  S: Smells of burnt dark chocolate. I caught some alcohol on the nose along with some roasted malts and some toffee sweetness.  T: Dark chocolate is the star here. I also caught some java and roasted malts. The alcohol presence is pretty much non existent which allows the flavors I've described to really shine.  M: A medium to full-bodied mouthfeel. Pretty much a standard feel. Nothing to write home about.  Overall: This is definitely my favorite low cost stout. A great value and this brew really shines after having a year on it. The chocolate taste is very prominent in this and the subtle complexities really allow this to come together.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,WoodBrew,3.92,"Tried this beer at the Boulevard in Johnstown, PA. Pours out very black with a small mocha head. Lots of legs in the glass. Lots of roasty aromas straight off the pour. In the glass, there's rich chocolate. The taste is a delightful balance of dark chocolate and roasted coffee, although as it warms a touch of sourness starts to present itself. Full mouthfeel, but highly drinkable thanks to a moderate carbonation level.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

A: Pours opaque black with three fingers of brown foamy head which quickly dissipates into a thin layer of bubbles that linger through the finish.  S: Sweet booziness with hints of chocolate and coffee.  T: Flavors of bittersweet chocolate and roasted malts lend a bitterness that compliments the sweet boozy taste. The alcohol is not overpowering.  M: Fantastic, smooth mouthfeel. Not as syrupy as I anticipated, which is a definite plus. Just the right amount of carbonation. The alcohol provides an excellent level of warmth.  O: Overall, this was an excellent imperial stout with a nice chocolatey backbone. Exceptional mouthfeel for the style.

The smell after a bit changes into some standard stout roasted malt and yeast. Head leaves a lot of lacing for a stout, beautiful. Taste is glorious; creamy and full mouthfeel, with sweet caramel, coffee and chocolate swirling around with dark roasted malts. Finish is a bit boozy but it works for such a big beer.

Just loads of sexy chocolate. Yum.  Mmm... more goodness. The massive chocolate character is beginning to bitter slightly. Still slightly sweet but a bit more roasty.

45,680,DiverJon,5,A: Pours black as night with a thin head. Exactly like this style should S: Chocolate with alcohol background. Slightly sweet but not overpowering with a little coffee in the back. T: Very full and intense but smooth at the same time. Sip slow. Definite chocolate with the alcohol apparent but it does not overpower the malt. M: Very full and warm. Go slow with this one as it will overpower you. Serve cellar temp not cold to get the most of the flavor. O: One of the finest Imperial Stouts on the market. Everything about this is near perfect. Buy a case and set some back to try every 2 or 3 months. When a brewmaster is getting ready to try an Imperial Stout he/she should have one of these to see what they should aim for.

Lacing is absolutely gorgeous and truly coats the glass. A classic looking stout here.  S. Perfect. Coffee roast, dark chocolate, mild vanilla, caramel, dark fruit, and some very very subtle hop presence. Beautiful bouquet.  T. More baking chocolate, coffee bean, dark fruit, caramel, and a little stronger zesty hop presence. Finish is slightly drying with hops and a little booze. Near-perfect balance between sweet, roasty, and dry here. Wow.  M. Creamy is exactly how I would describe this. Luscious, decadent, and smooth as a Hershey Kiss, this beer has some perfectly integrated flavor and drinks amazingly.  O. Nearly perfect, without the mildly boozy finish, it likely would have been. This is a spectacular stout and should in no way be penalized for its ample quantity and wide distribution. In fact, it should be praised for absolutely hitting it out of the park on such a broad scale.

Some sweeter chocolate malts. Black patent. Sweetness is high. Seriously roasted. Meat ends. High alcohol. Some lingering caramel malt sweetness. Almost like teriyaki jerky. Very sweet. Plums and cherries. Dark fruit and wet leather. Coffee beans.  Taste: Leather, char, and jerky up front. So much leather. Dark fruit, as in plums and cherries pull through. Some nice layers of cocoa, baker's chocolate, and sweeter chocolate. It's all there. Burnt and roasted like crazy. Cooked and then some. Mild dusting of citrus. How'd that get there? Punches of old coffee. So burnt. Alcohol smacks with a burn.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, full, and creamy. It drinks like a burnt dream.  Overall: I've tried this beer once a year for 4 years. It's always tasted like burnt meat ends to me. This isn't a bad thing, but it's not a good thing either.

Taste- initial taste is prune, raisin, fig, and plum. Strong chocolate bitterness with a bit of coffee. Finishes again with dark fruit and alcohol sourness.  Mouthfeel- nice thick body with good carbonation keeping it smooth. The finish is light leaving me feeling like its lacking. The alcohol presence in the finish isn't good.  Overall- this beer tastes much much better with 6 months on it than it did fresh. Fresh I'd give it a 2 overall but now it's a 3.5.

Smell: thick, sweet malt aroma with a lot of fruity character. There are dark cherry, raisin and date aromas, with plenty of chocolate when you search deeper. Amazingly, this dark-as-night brew is free of harsh, tannic smells and vegetal hop aromas. Deep, but clean ... wonderful!  Taste: big right off the bat with lots of bitterness and a hint of sourness. The coffee and general roastiness of the malt come through much more heavily in the flavor than in the aroma. There's a harshness to the flavor that is completely absent in the aroma. It is decent, but as the aroma is just so heavenly I am a tiny smidge disappointed.  Mouthfeel: big, huge body with a good carbonation. It's very silky on the tongue with a giant creaminess to boot ... excellent!  Overall: this is a great beer, but it is a bit on the harsh side, flavor-wise.

The flavor came through with some nice coffee bitterness, but barely anything hinting of chocolate. And I was expecting it. The finish come off with roast and ends with a peat moss flavor.  The mouthfeel was full and a bit chewy, I like that.  Overall, I didn't get the chocolate component I'd hoped for. And in certain Scotch Ales or even Baltic Porters I enjoy this flavor, but it didn't work. And I believe it shouldn't have been there. Nobody else has described the same experience.

The smell is deep with a mix of ingredients, a hint of alcohol behind a nice deep rich malt and inviting chocolate aromas. The flavor starts with a subtle sweet malt moving into a nice chocolate flavor and rounding out with a strong dose of the high ABV. The mouthfeel is by far the best part of this beer, which says a lot considering the flavor and smells are so good. It is so smooth, a rich thick body, borderline medium heavy.

The flavor is dark chocolate with milk chocolate, coffee, and raisin notes. Very complex. The mouthfeel is full and creamy with a biting, medicinal bite in the finish.

45,680,jazzyjeff13,4.17,"A 355ml bottle with a BB of Oct 2013. Picked up from an off-licence in Ripon. Brewed in the winter of 2010/11, so it's been maturing for a while; mmm....  Poured into a Delirium chalice. A deep jet black hue, though revealed as a dark brown when held to the light. Produces a decent head of creamy brown foam that remains for a few minutes before subsiding to a frothy surface layer. Aroma of rich, sweet malt with notes of dried fruit, molasses, chocolate, roasted malt, burnt grain and coffee. A warming whiff of booze in the background. Intense and delicious.  Tastes of rich roasted malt with a fruity character and a dry, bitter finish. Notes of dried fruit, chocolate, molasses, burnt grain and coffee. Slightly sweet, and possesses a spicy, astringent quality. Quite bitter upon swallowing, with a warm alcoholic note. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, with tingly carbonation and great body. Very dry, with considerable astringency that dries the palate. Aftertaste of bitter roasted malt and booze.  Wow - one of Brooklyn's classics. A fantastic brew with tons of flavour and character. Rich, sweet, fruity malt with distinct chocolate and coffee notes. I think what impresses me most is that this beer doesn't actually contain any chocolate; the flavour is the result of superb malt selection. I love the smooth mouthfeel. Excellent - add this to your list of must-try beers!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Can't complain  O - a great stout everyone should try",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Samp01,4.5,"Pours a deep dark slightly viscous black with a small brown head. Aroma is a strong chocolate with some roasted dark malts and espresso. Taste is chocolatey, with some roasted dark malt, espresso, and some hops and dark cacao bitterness. A rich full bodied and slightly viscous mouth feel with moderate carbonation on the palate. Finished with a bitter sweet choclatey and roasted dark malts, some espresso, ending is a long sweet lingering bitter chocolate flavor.

45,680,LXIXME,3.91,"Pours a dark black beneath a nice big brown head that slowly settles into a pretty decent lacing.  Dark roasted malts dominated by a almost sweet molasses aroma, with it it seems a very light pitted cherry presents.  Heavy mocha mixed with molasses and roasted malts taste, a dark dark chocolate taste is present but not dominate.  A dry mocha rich aftertaste lingers on the full bodied effort.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Alieniloquium,4.1,"Updated review on 2/17/2021. 12 oz. bottle from Winter 2019. Black body with a brief khaki head. Smells of heavily roasted malt that steers just shy of soy sauce. Tastes of roasted malt, chocolate malt, and a fairly aggressive bitterness lending to a bitter tobacco finish. Medium heavy, but never tastes too sweet or boozy. Excellent all around and a reminder that stouts don't need to be viscous sugary monstrosities.  Original review from May 16, 2012. Looks like I was a clown back then: 12 oz. bottle poured into a CCB snifter. Bottled 8/30/2011.  Appearance - Black with a nice buildup of a mocha head. Not much room for it in this glass, but it's there. Settles quickly with some decent lacing for 10%.  Smell - Chocolate through and through. Molasses rounds it out. Overload of both aromas, really. I like it, though. Just a touch of hop in the aroma as well.  Taste - Initial smack of chocolate and molasses, but it's immediately followed by a hefty dose of hop bitterness. Not really a well-defined hop bite. Just bitter throughout, especially in the finish. Drowns out a lot of the flavors. The finish is a touch grassy with an intense roast malt finish. Almost burnt.  Mouthfeel - Not pleasant. The bitterness is intense and the beer thins out at the very end, leaving a strong carbonation and hop feel instead of a nice creamy stout feel. What gives?  Overall - First half of the beer is good, the second half is lacking. Overly hopped? Not really, as the hop flavor doesn't come through clearly. It's that burnt flavor at the end that's the most off-putting. Luckily a lot of the other flavors salvage this one. 4-4-3.5-2.5-3 = 3.45  I don't update many reviews, but this one needed updating.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BostonHops,4.08,"12oz bottle served in an oversized wineglass.  pours your standard jet-RIS-black with a really nice finger-plus of a creamy, mocha toned head; very respectable retention and outstanding walls of lacing. just an A+ presentation... stands apart even within the style.  in the nose i get a ton of dark chocolate, roasted malts, molasses and maybe a subdued dark fruity note or two in the background. great aroma.  taste is very good albeit slighty disappointing, though on the latter count mostly considering the build-up of its appearance and smell; flavor mostly follows the nose though has some bitterness to it and is not quite as robust as the aroma indicated. alcohol is perhaps not as well-hidden as it could be. still, the main players (roasted malt, chocolate, molasses, a touch of dark fruit) are present and accounted for.  for an RIS (an arena teeming with worthy foes), the mouthfeel is just OK, a bit - a bit - on the watery side; doesn't have the chewy, velvety-ness i look for. adequate carbonation... decent drinkability, more a sipper than something you'd want a few of, but a beer i'll definitely seek out again (especially considering its very reasonable price).  originally reviewed: 10-25-2010",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Very wholesome.  Taste Very strong chocolate and malts with some carbonation as well. Dark roasted malts.  Mouthfeel Strong roasty malt after taste with some carbonation as you first taste it.

45,680,heygeebee,3.62,"I can't add to 2500 reviews, but can note that it was not a particularly good looking beer, (no head no lace) nor was it obvious that it was a 10 %- er. Actually thought by the flavour profile was much less.  Masses of roast malts and chocolate drive an overall middling complexity experience, so while good was not great.

45,680,lacqueredmouse,3.66,"Pours a dark mocha-black, leavened on the edges with a touch of burgundy-brown, but otherwise quite opaque. Head is fine and soft, forming a pleasant milk chocolate ring around the edge. Lacing is veiny. Body is solid, and it forms nice fine carbonation when tilted or swirled. Overall, a very good-looking beer.  Nose is roasted, but also oddly acidic, with a oily whiff of vegetative pressings. There's a vaguely fragrant, jasmine-like overtone to it, which undermines the deep sweetness I feel it's trying to convey. Not bad overall, but not much like what I expected, and certainly no chocolate characters.  Flavour is nutty-black, with a thinness that is a little unbecoming, but marked with pleasant almond and sweet cacao characters. In reality, there's not much in the way of chocolate to it, but it has a pleasant raw, grainy darkness to it which is appealing enough.  Feel is surprisingly light, and allows that fragrant, burgeoning jasmine character to slip through quite prominently onto the palate.  Overall, it's good. I mean, it has to be good. But it's also a little odd, and doesn't live up to its name or to my expectations. A 10% stout, chocolate or no, should be better than this.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,CrazyDavros,3.7,"Pours black with a large, lasting head. Nose shows roasted malt, dark chocolate, burnt fig and cocoa. Tempting! Similarly rich flavours, very powerful. Lots of cocoa, more figs/prunes and charcoal. Very roasty. Some booze shows in the finish, accompanied by an aggressively roasty bitterness. Very syrupy body, carbonation seems a bit full-on though.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ScruffySouthpaw,4.2,"Served in a snifter.  Appearance: Really dark, you know what looks like motor oil not too bubbly. Tan head was thick after a rising to roughly a fingers length and settled to nothing after a sip.  Smell: Light chocolate, not to potent. It comes off easy and honestly feels like you can taste the beer before tasting it if you know what I mean.  Taste: Bitter, but a notch sweet. Feel of chocolate is definitely there and very very light molasses.  Mouth: Little rough and definitely not for everyone.  Overall: All I need is a cheesecake or maybe a great beer to finish off a nice meaty meal. Picked it up for the hell of it and absolutely will be buying it again.

S - Dark, bittersweet chocolate, a hint of oak, licorice, a touch of alcohol.  T - Some roasted malt up front, with a slight hop bitterness. The huge chocolate shows up mid-palate and just lingers and lingers and lingers... Lots of dark chocolate with just a hint of marshmallow creme. A very delicious tasting beer.

In the background I get faint notes of dark fruits, figs.  T: The first thing I taste is a semi-bitter chocolate. With this is a wide range of other dark malt flavors; black and roasted. There is mild coffee flavor, but chocolate is the theme. This beer actually has a fruity, sweet side to it. Plum, fig, and raisins round out the bitterness from the dark malts. The finish is fairly bitter, with a lingering pine/chocolate flavor.  M: Thick like oil. Coats the mouth and is a little sticky. Carbonation is mild but small and effervescent. Alcohol is very well hidden.  O: A well balanced but chocolate forward imperial stout. The girlfriend doesn't find it as chocolatey as I do. Given that this beer doesn't seem to have any actual chocolate added to it, the chocolate flavor comes entirely from the malts and is well done.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Pintofbrown,4.38,"I had some Black Chocolate in a nonic pint. A tip o' the cap to one, Geneseohawk.  Appearance- Nice one-finger width of a dense and rum raisin -colored foam has great retention. No lace, but no matter. The body is certainly true to it's namesake, no highlights escaping here.  Smell- A sweet and roasty nose, almost combined, it is very hard to pick out which one is dominating the other. I certainly smell figs, some tobacco, dark chocolate. There is a dash of alcohol warmth that gets through but just barely, and not off-putting.  Taste- The palate copies the nose well, but there is more char here because of the long, roasty finish. The figs and tobacco are back again at the front of the drink, with a little bit of dark chocolate for good measure. There is a little bourbon booziness in the stout as well, thanks to the 10% abv. This is a very nice touch, a thoroughly enjoyable drink.  Mouth feel- This has a nice medium body, and is not nearly as slick as I thought it was going to be. It is very creamy and the bubbles really make the beer fill the mouth up. Also a pretty dry finish that does a good job of keeping the roasty finish around for a long time.  Overall- Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is a great beer. The nose is great, but I felt like I had to try to hard to enjoy it, wasn't pouring out of the glass. The boozy kiss and sweet qualities make it a pleasure to drink, and the feel is a gift that keeps on giving.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The head retains nicely and it leaves a great lacing down the glass.  S - Mostly dark fruits; plum, cherry, raisin. Some dark chocolate, but it lacks the roasty, complex aroma I am looking for in an RIS.  T - The fruits are prominent, but there is a big baker's chocolate bite/bitterness as well. It is quite balanced as it starts with a tart black cherry sweetness and transitions to a chocolate and woody bitter finish. There is a slight alcohol burn at the end that reminds me this is a double digit ABV'er. Very good flavor.  M - I have had this on tap a few times and found it to be too thin and undercarbonated. The bottled version, however, has a full body and the carbonation suits the style. Enjoyable.  O - I saw this one on sale as they were trying to clear stock to make room for spring seasonals. I enjoyed it all winter long and was not let down on this mild spring evening. The flavors are complex and balanced.

Jet black otherwise, just like an Imperial Stout should be.  -Smell 4.0: Very nice bouquet. Toasted oats and dark chocolate notes and an unmistakable ""sweet"" smell. Promising.  -Taste 4.0: Front is sweet and there is a detectable taste of smoked grains. Middle is thick barley with a medium sweetness and a nice layer of cocoa and smokiness.

It is nearly flat and this detracted from the overall enjoyment of the beer.  -Overall 3.5: Very good Imperial Stout. Has a high ABV (10%), but this is unnoticeable in the taste.

Foamy, cascading lacing.  S: The nose bursts out of the bottle immediately and never really ever departs. It's meaty (iron-like) milk chocolate, with some underlying veggie tones, and some light chalkiness. Lovely.  T: Big chocolate malt tones burst like fireworks as soon as this RIS touches your lips, followed by a lightly toasted malt second fiddle. A spicy booze/hop middle cuts through the roasted malts, leading into a chocolate malt and grassy hop finish.  M: Slides down like liquid chocolate, or pancake syrup.

T&M: Upfront a bit sour and chocolately. Not as much alcohol as you would expect out of a 10% imperial. Bitter acidic coffee finish. Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy. Pretty much no carbonation present.  Overall: an incredible steal for the quality/price. Spartan Spirits was selling this for less then 2 bucks a single.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JordonHoltzman,3.53,"Poured into a Pint glass, its black with a tan froth head. the maltiness and chocolate are the prominent aromas in the nose. Taste: for taste it was not at chocolaty as i hoped, although its there, there is also maltiness and some bitter hop tastes. When chocolate is in the name, i hope for more. compared to something like Rogue's chocolate stout, it didn't stand up in the chocolate department. still pretty good though. it has a solid mouth feel, not as creamy as i hoped. smooth and good carbonation. Overall the beer grew on me the more i drank it. drinkable, definitely good, though i wasn't wow'd and i did not think of it as special.  I had this right after ten fidy, which i am about to review (both from notes), so also that was in my memory.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,litheum94,4.21,"Winter 11-12 stamped on the bottle.  Deep, oil slick black. Minimal, brown head. Leaves a whispy cover.  Great aromas of hazelnuts, semi-sweet chocolate, slight cola and licorice. One of the best smelling stouts I've encountered.  Two types of chocolate are present, with sweet milk chocolate followed by a bitter, bakery's chocolate flavor. Some espresso bitterness as well. Some molasses flavor and smoked oak. Finish has some more chocolate bitterness, an a good dose of alcohol burn.  A really nice stout, tasty, but I wish it tasted as good as it smells! And that's not a slag on the flavor at all. This also drinks like it would age well.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,kscaldef,4.48,"Pours out very black with a small mocha head. Lots of legs in the glass. Lots of roasty aromas straight off the pour. In the glass, there's rich chocolate. The taste is a delightful balance of dark chocolate and roasted coffee, although as it warms a touch of sourness starts to present itself. Full mouthfeel, but highly drinkable thanks to a moderate carbonation level.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Thads324,3.29,"2521 1230 on the bottle Pours a jet black with a tight, small bubbled dark tan head. Dissipates quickly. Light ringed lacing. Aroma is of fruity esters and some chocolate malt. Light roast. A lot of rubbing alcohol aroma in the end. Flavor starts slow and sweet. roasted, nearly burnt chestnuts, some faint caramel and heavy roasted malts. Slightly fruity sweet. Ends with a bitter malt flavor. A lot of heat at the end. Very smooth and almost creamy mouthfeel. The effervescence tingles and while light, carries the flavor well.  Entirely too much boozy flavor and over done roasted malt. I'll let it age more in hopes it'll calm down and mellow. I'll return to this one when it's time.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,zeledonia,4.23,"2011 vintage.  Pours black and thick. One.5 finger deep tan head, very dense. Decent retention, and some elegant lacing. I like it.  Smell is rich, chocolatey, and slightly boozy in a way that I like. The booze comes more as a fullness than sharpness, with rich caramel. Main complaint is that it's a little faint, but I suspect that will change as it warms up.  Taste is deep and complex, though I'd like a bit less bitterness in the back end. Slightly smoky wood, chocolate, caramel. It has a slightly burnt taste, that lays on top of those delicious chocolatey malts, and doesn't quite let them shine through. Finishes rather bitter, thanks to some hops and some char. Pretty darn good, but so close to being so much better. Alcohol is very well hidden.  I LOVE the mouthfeel on this beer. So silky smooth. Heavy and thick, but the carbonation keeps it fluffy. Long-lasting chewy finish. Wow.  A very tasty stout. Just like that, my glass is almost empty. Chewy and complex. One of the better widely-available imperial stouts I've had, though I find the roast a little heavy, leading to a notable bitterness. The mouthfeel is simply exquisite.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S: A nice, malty/chocolate concoction with licorice backup. Dark fruits. Some smokiness.  T: Espresso, astringent. Those 6 varieties of malts creep in along with that 10% alcohol. Slightly bitter, chocolate-y finish. Even smoother as it warms.  M: medium, creamy. Big bodied. Really coats the tongue.  O: A fine IRS. Would compare to Stone IRS and slightly below Old Rasputin.

45,680,RonaldTheriot,4.65,"Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout has a thin, tan head and a very dark brown appearance. The aroma is of grain husks, dark chocolate, dark-roasted chocolate, fudge, and molasses. Taste is of dark-roasted grain, dark chocolate, sweetness, and syrup.

45,680,Parrotshake,4.33,"Winter 11/12 bottling.  Pours very, very black with a finger of tan head. On the nose, licorice, cocoa powder and an illusion of sweetness that is absent from the palate altogether. Tantalizing.  Taste wise, a rush of astringent roasted malt. Bitter chocolate first and foremost, licorice, coffee, the slightest hints dark stonefruit, vegemite and pepper. Gosh. Full-on, and delicious. 10% alcohol and not afraid to show it. Pretty big hop bite on it at this age too. A monster.  Softly carbonated and medium bodied. A beer deserving of an epic meal or special occasion... that said, I'm drinking it alongside a tin of baked beans while watching Eastbound & Down in my underwear. Still works. I will buy a whole bunch more of this and see what some age does to a couple of them, if I can resist. Magic.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Louski,4,"Had On-Tap at Grey Lodge in Philly. Poured into standard pint glass.  Deep black body with thick, tan head. Smells of chocolate and malt with hints of coffee. Very distinct dark chocolate taste in that it has a nice bitterness and is not as sweet as I thought it would be. A very filling beer (to be expected) although I must admit that it also served as dessert to a hefty lunch. Overall, a nice above average chocolate stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DrinkSlurm,4.32,"Poured from tap at Sunset in Boston. Pours a dark oil looking color with thick tan head. Smell is of chocolate for sure with hints of coffee and roasted malts. Really great roasted malt and chocolate flavor. There are so many other flavors going on here; roasted coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa... It almost taste like a Manhattan Special (NY Italian Soda); which in this case I think it really works. Its delicious, well crafted, and worth every penny. Makes a perfect after dinner or desert brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JTSbeerislife,4.5,"12 oz bottle labeled, Winter 11-12, purchased 12/2012 and well stored.  Poured into a Dogfish Head Signature Snifter.  Pours a thick ½ “ head, which slowly reduces to a thin cap and finally a film. Black as pitch color, opaque, with a medium dark tan head, excellent lace coats the glass. A classic look for the style.  The aroma is rich and malty, with distinct smells of dark unsweetened chocolate. Coffee Latté. Black bread yeast and pumpernickel, you can really smell it. Quite complex and extremely enjoyable.  Full crisp entry on the palate of rich, deeply roasted bitter chocolate, followed by a slight sweetness, then some bready yeast kicks in. Nice bitterness continues in the middle, is it hops, or the black roasted malt? Whatever it’s delicious! Very full body and fine carbonation balance out this wonderfully enjoyable ale.  Exceptionally long finish of deep roasted chocolate malt, coats your mouth like paint and just won’t let go.  This is quite massive, aggressively flavored ale, but at the same time every component seems in balance. The 10% ABV is only faintly noticeable and in a very positive way at that. Extremely drinkable despite the weight and intensity of this brew. I definitely can drink 2 or 3 of these back to back (at home of course).  Very highly recommended!  These notes are from bottles that I have stored personally, but I have had the pleasure to have had this on tap several times and oh what a pleasure that is!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Aromas are dark cocoa/chocolate and boozy. Initial mouth-feel is thick and chewy, but velvety and smooth. Tastes are dark chocolate with a sticky sweetness, some roasted malts, and a little hop bitterness on the finish. Overall, I liked this more than the last couple of times I had it. It is extremely rich and sweet, but excellent none the less.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,HESSLER500,4.23,"Overall a very robust stout. The flavor of this beer remains on the back of the tongue for a good minute or so; a bitter dark chocolate flavor. Nothing like Southern Tier Chokolat however. I find that this beer is so much more enjoyable when mixed 1/2 and 1/2 with a Dark Horse Scotty Karate (Scotch ale); adds a bit of sweetness that this beer alone lacks. By itself however, a very good beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,brureview,4.03,"I had two different experiences sampling this beer. The first time I tried this beer, I had just purchased it and it had been stored in the liquor store cooler. It was too cold. A few days later, storage at my refrigerator temperature made a big difference.  On my first sampling, I poured the beer at the usual 45 degree, then at a 90 degree angle. The head was only one finger. This beer is actually capable of a great head, so I suggest pouring more at a 90 degree angle.  The color is an exceptionally dark chocolate- quite enjoyable to view. The smell is a complex spicy fruity chocolate. The mouthfeel is pleasantly tangy.  The taste from the first sampling was disappointing. It was bitter- too bitter with a lemony finish, and the flavor was not balanced with the mouthfeel and smell. There wasn't much chocolate present.  However, two days later, with a better head and a warmer temp, the finish was smooth and malty.  Overall, a great beer, which can be enjoyed regularly. It should be served warmer, and poured more vertically for a better head.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,acevenom,4.41,"Pours black with a miniscule tan head that dissipates quickly. The alcohol hits the nose and there's some aroma of roasted malt and chocolate once you get past the alcohol. With 10% ABV, you almost have to expect the alcohol to be forward in the aroma. The alcohol is definitely present in the taste, but one can get the bitterness you would expect with this style as well. The flavors of roasted malt and hops are definitely there as well as chocolate. I'm currently aging some, so it will be interesting to compare after this has had some aging. There isn't much carbonation and the body is medium to heavy. This is a solid beer overall.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Ruger,4.63,"A - Pours a complete black probably the darkest beer I've ever had, thick lacing with a nice two inch head and strong retention.  S - Roasted melted chocolate, I don't get any coffee at all in this which doesn't really disappoint me. Seems like some dark fruits in the back too.  T - For 10% this is amazing can't taste the alcohol at all Starts off roasted malts with strong chocolate and finishes with a nice hop bitterness.  M - Heavy bodied really smooth, the beer sticks slightly to the mouth really pleasant with light carbonation.  O - By far the best RIS I've had.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TownDunkel,3.93,"Chocolate beer, combining two of the best things in the world! I am a big fan of the the double chocolate stout by Young's, so I figured this one is worth a shot  Appearance - One of the best pour colors I have ever seen in a beer. Great dark opaqeness that almost sucks light in!  Smell - A deep complex scent. Dark chocolate is evident but also with hints of oak and coffee beans.  Taste - Don't expect sweetness! It is a great dark beer with great coffee flavor and cacao.  Mouthfeel - Not as much head as I would expect but it is filling and has a nice long lasting flavor.  Overall - A great chocolate stout!

45,680,Thingus,4.08,"Live tasting bottle into Duvel Tulip...  Appearance; pours a viscous black color with less than a finger of mocha colored head. When held to light, only the very top fraction of a millimeter appears a cola colored brown... This is a black beer. Retention is non-existent and lacing follows suit.  Smell; roasty malts, coffee, chocolate and slight notes of soy... Hints of dark fruit, raisins and prunes...  Taste; coffee, chocolate and roasty malt flavors jump right out, notes of smoke and slight soy bitterness creep in as well as the slightest notes of dark fruits such as raisins and prunes...  Mouthfeel; smooth and oily, goes down exceptionally smoothly, coats the mouth, and definitely on the full side of full body, but not as thick or chewy as say Ten Fidy...  Overall; this is a damn good beer, and has all of the qualities I can appreciate in a solid Imperial Russian Stout. Doesn't taste a hint of 10%, even just a few degrees above cellar temps...

S: Very pleasant waves of dark roasted malt, barley, dark coffee and dark chocolate.  T: Rich and smooth with roastiness leading the way. Comes out waves of roasted, almost burnt malt, then bittersweet chocolate and back to roasted malt. The more I drink I pick out espresso. Hints of barley are noticeable along the way and it finishes with slight cream and dark berries. The alcohol sneaks up because it warms a bit but not very noticeable. The more I drink the more I notice some slight hop notes in the mid-end. Kind of mild grassy/herbalness. Very mild and supportive.  M: Rich and creamy with a velvety feel and thickness that support the beer.  O: Very good, I like this beer more each time I have it.

T: Strong dark chocolate taste that turns to a chalky aftertaste. Hints of dark fruits. Slight hop taste at finish that lingers in the back of your mouth.  M: Pretty light on the palate for such a dark and strong beer. Low carbonation. Not very sticky for how sweet it is. Leaves a thin film but mostly with a hop taste.

45,680,Cozzatoad,3.77,"330ml bottle. Clearly an export version bottle, with ingredients and names of importers on different languages on the back. Winter 11-12 vintage  A- Totally black colour. Two finger, quite foamy mocha head that disappears pretty quickly, though the beer leaves some hints of lacing on the glass  S- Dark roasted malts with notes of caramel and a dense, strong chocolate smell, with maybe some background coffee notes. A slightl herbal feel from the hops brings a touch of freshness. A bit of alcoholic booze shows up as well  T- Bold mix of assertive dark chocolate and roasted notes from the malts, with chocolate definitely taking the main stage. Some background notes of coffee, molasses, maybe liquorice might be noticed. A touch of hop bitterness can be easily detected, resulting in a bittersweet overall feel. Some not completely hidden, warming alcoholic notes. Maybe some aging could help in blending flavours a bit more  M- Medium bodied with quite low carbonation, but somehow still very thick. Sweeter and smoother on the palate than it is on the tongue. Suprisingly dry for the style. As i said, flavours are not fully blended; the mouthfeel is probably where some aging would have helped the most  O- Bold, warming, strong in flavour, but not perfectly balanced despite nice drinkabilty",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Also a bit warming going down, which is to be expected and is appreciated here.

M: coats the mouth, very thick and full bodied, smooth and creamy, kind of a meaty aftertaste as well  O: This beer is like a meal unto itself. Very thick and delicious, definitely a sipping beer.

The head dissipates fairly quickly leaving a thin layer of dark mocha bubbles at the edges of the surface. Excellent lacing on the glass with this brew.  S: The aroma is slightly astringent overall, quite possibly due to the alcohol content, and has very bold amounts of chocolate in it followed by hints of coffee, toffee, and leather.  T: The taste also has the slightest hint of alcohol in it. The flavors are of bittersweet chocolate upfront, followed by leather & pepper, and hints of licorice, tobacco, and coffee in the finish. The beer has a pleasant amount of bitterness and is nicely complex.  M: Medium bodied with low amounts of carbonation. Very creamy.  O: Glad that I took the time to cellar this one before drinking it, I have had many of these over the years... from the different batches and aged different amounts but this one is probably my personal favorite (08-09 aged 3 years).

45,680,BarryMFBurton,4.42,"Here’s a brewery that I’ve never tried: Brooklyn. Their Black Chocolate Stout is certainly one to start with – I’ve heard it’s one of the best. At any rate, I’m cracking this one open during the Super Bowl, so I’m hoping it’s worthy of the occasion.  Brewed over five months ago (August 30, 2011 from the date code on the bottle).  A: Devilishly dark, shining like a deep black-brown night sky. The head only gets to a foamy half-inch, about the color of wet beach sand. As I swirl it around, the body looks pretty oily – the lacing doesn’t stick very abundantly. A thick, dark presence.  S: Immense dark chocolate – as big as DFH World Wide Stout (one of my favorites). That loveable character is amplified by woody bourbon-booze, toffee, and malts as thick and spicy as rye. What’s more, I’m getting notes of bubblegum, leather/must, and pepper. It’s magnificently powerful, but luscious as ever: exactly what I love in a stout.  T: Cocoa powder, bittersweet, opens the palate with the rich flavor of homemade brownies and gooey fudge – the perfect entrance for this Black Chocolate Stout. There’s a thick, leathery, wooden taste covering the remainder, smooth and dark. Like many of my favorite dark beers, this has just a touch of hop bite for complexity; resiny, savory bitters. Licorice, toasted bread, coffee, and leafy tobacco play well from the malts and residual sugars, as well. Finish is smoky with a hint of tart fruits and honey-oat cereal grains. This is one delicious stout.  M: Creamy, full-bodied, yet insanely drinkable for a 10% ABV stout. It’s really only astringent for a fleeting moment, just to give it a kick of complex texture. Very well-done, here.  O: Black Chocolate Stout is worthy of its reputation, and definitely a Super Bowl-worthy beer; I’m picking up a four-pack for some aging, ASAP.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,deadonhisfeet,4.16,"Poured from my growler into a proper Brooklyn tulip. It's black and the head is chunky and brown and doesn't want to dissipate. Holding this glass in my hand is like holding a big black pearl. From the nose, I'm getting faint tones of chocolate, leather, and a tiny bit of booze.  The taste follows the nose. It's very smooth, malt-forward, and semi-sweet, and there is not much bitterness at all. The predominant flavor is chocolate and it hits you coming and going. There is just a touch of that burnt flavor that characterizes RISs, but it is buried under the chocolate. There are also dark fruit notes at mid-palate and a faint warming alcohol presence on the finish, but it's reasonable given that this baby is 10% abv. The mouthfeel is firm and slightly creamy.  This beer is an RIS that drinks like an American Double Stout. I have had it many times and it is one of my favorite winter seasonals. It is very easy to get, it is reasonably priced (especially growlers), and it is absolutely delicious. I don't know why I waited so long to review it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,eric5bellies,4.35,Drank from my Duvel chalice  A - Pours a Black / Ebony colour (no light) with a nice coffee coloured head that retains well and laces.  S - Mainly hops and malt on the nose.  T - Up front some nice sweetness followed by some decent hop flavours. The chocolate is subtle but very complimentry. The finish is a long balanced afair with no sign of the 10% alcohol.  M - Full body and low carbonation.  O - A truly great beer. The chocolate is not overpowering but complimentry. I will buy more.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BMoldy,4.47,"A: It doesn't take too heavy a pour to yield a large, thick brown head on top of this jet-black brew. Retention is above average for the style, while the lacing is not inconsiderable.  S: The chocolate rings out strong here in the form of cocoa powder and milk and baking chocolates. There is also an overlying sweetness and an underlying aroma of booze in the background.  T/M: Taste follows the nose, though it's not as rich and one-dimensional as Choklat, which I find to be a good thing. The sweetness is well tamed by some subtle hops, while the alcohol mostly stays out of the way. Roasted flavors are faint compared to the chocolate, but help –along with a mild alcohol warmth– to round things out a bit. A good, medium-heavy body benefits from a perfect carbonation that's soft enough to add creaminess but active enough to keep things alive.  O: I've wanted to try this for a while, and I have to say I'm not disappointed. Having tried Choklat last night, I believe that my perfect chocolate stout lies somewhere in between the two. Though this brew lacks the robustness of Choklat, it's less offensively heavy and more varied in flavor, making it much more drinkable. I definitely see a side-by-side tasting in the near future.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Salted caramel in the end.  Mouthfeel- Thick and creamy just like a stout should be. Lingers in your mouth forever...and leaves a citrus after taste.  Overall- An amazing beer.

No light is getting through.  S: Hops. Not in the IPA way, but the delicious stout way. Tobacco, licorice and a moderate dose of dark fruit (mostly plums). I’m certain the roasted malts are there, but they are so well done that they are not putting off a strong char aroma.  T: Here comes the roasted malt. It’s very nicely balanced and is the focus of the brew. While it wasn’t the star of the nose, it’s the lynchpin of the flavor of the beer. If Brooklyn was off on the chocolate malted grains then this brew would be compromised. Hops are the secondary player and they are nicely placed. The hop bitterness at the finish sets a nice pace for the respect this beer deserves.  M: Medium body, medium carbonation. Although it is drinkable, from experience, this is a beer that should be respected.  O: My nemesis. I love this beer, but it has historically kicked my butt. It’s deceptively strong. I’ve always liked it, but never really broken it down, which this review has allowed me to do.

45,680,TWStandley,4.15,"Poured into a Chimay glass...  Aggressively poured, appeared a jet black color with a mocha colored head. Head was about 2 fingers to start, yet dissipated rather quickly, leaving a syrupy resin on the glass.  Smelled of dark chocolate, coffee, molasses - with a slight boozy warmth in the nose. Smell makes me want to take a big gulp.  A solid roasted taste - though I find the chocolate to be much more prevalent in the nose, and less on the palate. Still extremely tasty and well balanced. Nice bitter finish.  Moderate mouthfeel, on the lighter end for a stout but compliments this particular brew quite well.  This is one of my go-to stouts. Always a solid stout no matter the vintage. I find that more chocolate/vanilla notes come through with a little age on it. Looking forward to saving the rest of the 4 pack I purchased for a few years down the line.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Converge,4.62,"355ml bottle poured into a 16oz tulip. Winter 11-12 bottle.  A - Small head of dark mocha foam; only about a finger though. The beer black as night, and really viscous. Very little head retention, but it does settle to a small ring around the edges of the glass. Minimal lacing for a while, but that soon disappears as well. Honestly, the appearance of this stout is probably the most underwhelming thing about it. I suppose I'll give the next one I try a good aggressive pour and see if I can yield a nice big head out of it.  S - Maybe a bit too cold, but I'm getting a lot of skunky/metallic notes at first. Upon warming up for a bit, more bitter espresso, burnt black malt, and rich black chocolate. A bit of hop presence looms in the background. Overall this RIS shows off a complex aroma with earthy, resinous notes of charred malt as well as deep, rich chocolate sweetness. There's definitely a smokey character in here as well.  T - Outright massive. The flavors are dark and rich and very complex. Huge charred and burnt malt dominates the front of the palate, along with rich dark chocolate and a solid bite of coffee bean bitterness. The finish is lingering burnt black malt, dark chocolatey goodness, and espresso bitterness. As it warms, the complexities only grow. Notes of dark fruit begin to come through, along with heavy molasses, licorice, and some earthy hops and resinous, smokey character. There's definitely some alcohol heat in the finish, but with a stout this big and mean, I don't mind one bit. Although this flavor profile might sound like an all out assault of flavors, which it sort of is, it's not at all too much to handle. The bitterness is there, but I wouldn't have guessed 70 IBUs; maybe more like 50.  M - Viscous, creamy, and heavy; low carbonation, but not quite as subtle as I would have liked. Not really as smooth as anticipated either. Still, this is no area of concern for this RIS. The body feels full and rich, and the carbonation adds a nice liveliness to it. As expected, this monster gets pretty sticky towards the end. The heat is there in the finish, but as already mentioned, it doesn't detract from the flavor profile at all.  D - The RIS exceeded all expectations. The flavor here was everything I could have hoped for and then some. Although this stout couldn't be much bigger, it was still easy to get through. Certainly one I'll be having many times more, and well worth the hype.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,anth0ny,4.12,"A - Brooklyn Black Chocolate pours deep black with a pinky finger of a brilliant cinnamon colored head. When the head is out it leaves a nice, thin landscape on top and a small frothy ring around the glass that hangs out til the end. Looks pretty dang good.  S - For me, I'm getting pretty much all chocolate/cocoa and some bourbon in the nose. Loving the aroma.  T - The taste is interesting. By interesting I mean an initial shock to the palette on every drink. Black chocolate is dominant, a little raisin, a bit of hops. Finishes bitter with a lot of booze. It's definitely a sipper and a warmer. You get the stout flavor in the aftertaste, with lingering coffee and malt.  M - Nice, heavy mouth with sufficient, balanced carbonation. Ice cold is the way to go, more chocolate and less booze. The warmer it gets you get more of a chocolate cough syrup.  O - This stout is power with flavor and punch. I'd say the alcohol is a bit too much, but without it, it wouldn't be the same. Also, it's a specific occasion type of drink. I had it now just chillin at home, not really the right scene for it. But I also had this on a more relaxed NYE in a hot tub and it was fantastic.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,thecheapies,4,"On-tap at the Sharp Edge.  Near black with a cream-colored head that rings firm.  Bitter chocolate, booze, candied sugar, smoke, hint of caramel.  Prickly spice hops with a very bitter alkaline cocoa punch. Licorice is strong; big roastiness, semi-sweet, alcohol present, long tingly finish. Earthy/spicy hop comes in pretty hard in a fresh offering. Commanding presence in a beer.  Silky mouthfeel. Hot, because it's pretty fresh. A little syrupy, carbonation is a bit low.  I drink this on draft here every winter. One of my favorite seasonals. Highly recommended.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,hogrider,4.52,"I have heard a lot of good things about this stout and I made a special effort to get a bottle; first impressions are very important, as I poured this stout into my 12 oz. mug I knew that I had a winner in my hands. I immediately tested the nose, it registered a strong bitter brew, scent of chocolate, roasted barley and chocolate malt came to the forefront and it was confirmed by the palate. Head retention is minimal with light lacing in the mug…I like this stout a lot, it goes down warm and is thick to the palate; next time I have it I will drink it in a sniffer glass and sip it slow just like brandy. I highly recommend it….and remember folks support your local brewery DRINK BEER. HOG.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee, candy, vanilla. Ended by grassy hops and alcohol  T: Follows the nose. Roasted malts, hints of dark chocolate, coffee, yeasts, grassy hops. In overall a deliciously bitter beer. Very very tasty  M: Full creamy body. Low carbonation. Dry bitter mouthfeel. Alcohol is quite evident. Aftertaste is grassy and earthy  O: Brooklyn beers are usually good. This one is even better ;)",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,Zimbo,4.09,"Limited bottling 10-11.  In the bottle there is a nice light dry roasty aroma with some richness and raisin. Poured it forms virtually no head. Jet black colour and obvious high booze shimmery hue this is surprisingly light bodied for the style. A bit hollow on the taste front as it lacks definition and fullness on the palate. But just when you've virtually given up all hope more intense roasty complex meaty aromas creep up on you with a medicinal gauze quality which just makes it really quite delicious. Still, by the time this almost perfect nose comes to the forefront its almost too late to push this into the realm of excellent. Still, I could whiff this little baby all night.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,nataku00,4,"Bottle ('09-'10 release so around two years old) poured into a tulip glass. Beer pours pitch black with about a finger of khaki light brown creamy head. Head retention was pretty good for a little bit before it receded to an even layer around the surface, leaving a sheet of lacing on the edge of the glass.  Nose is pretty true its name, rich semi sweet dark chocolate that is slightly fruity with notes of red berries. A little bit of espresso in there as well.  Taking a sip, there is a mild hop bitterness, before the smooth semi sweet dark chocolate flavors come through. Some roasted malt and espresso astringency near the finish.  Full body with some prickly carbonation, though it's silky smooth on the tongue after the initial carbonation attack. Alcohol is completely hidden after two years of age. Pretty good RIS, though it's a bit of a one note in flavor.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,markmiller,4.33,"Picked up a growler for $10. Poured into a nonic pint glass.  A: Dark. Really dark. Lusciously dark. Poured aggressively resulting in a three finger caramel tan head that sticks around for just a bit. I love the look of this beer.  S: The first thing that hits is the roasted malt and coffee. Then a good whiff of alcohol takes hold that mellows into dark cocoa powder. Maybe just the slightest dark chocolate covered cherry.  T: Roasted malt and just a hint of bitter chocolate. Stronger alcohol taste in the finish. As it warmed, tastes of the dark chocolate covered cherries come back on the finish. Very smooth, though. Enjoyable.  M: Mid-to-full bodied. Great coating of the tongue and mouth. Warmer it was a little syurpy, still really good.  O: I really enjoy this brew. The look and aftertaste do it for me. Each sip leaves such a wonderful taste that lingers forever, and the higher ABV allows this beer to have a nice warming taste and effect.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,GarthDanielson,3.83,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is jet black with hazelnut highlights around the edges, with a thin, foamy, sparsely covered biege head. Aromas are rich, with dark chocolate and booze in the forefront. Good roasted, coffee, and slightly meaty characteristics in the nose, as well. Flavors are bold, with a dark roasting feel overall, and a rich, chocolatey backbone throughout. Alcohol characteristics sharpen the palate a bit, with rich, dark molasses and slight licorice flavors. The aftertaste is mostly roasted and chocolatey, with a steady bitterness that curbs the booze content in the mouthfeel. The beer is rich and smooth, with a slight lacing left along the glass. The beer has a drying finish that ends short, leaving a slight slick feeling in the periphery of the palate. Great beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,StJamesGate,4.15,"Viscous black with only the slightest tinge of magenta with a creamy sepia head that leaves trailers. Prune, port and muscavado sugar on the nose with hints of blueberry, ash and wood. Espresso grounds, liqourice root, raisin and tar lead into roasty dark sugars and a branch and understated dried orange rind hop end. Burnt caramel finish and dry, slightly acidic roasty linger. Full, sticky, chewy, smooth, not much burn.  Winter 11-12 version.  Big and bold, with all the RIS flavors in all the right places. Lean as opposed to some of the more sweet Imperial Stouts out there. Chocolate doesn't turn up much, in spite of the name. I somehow can't help but feel that there are so many monster examples of the style that this, being merely solid and an older recipe, suffers by comparison to what's come after.  My 800th review.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,AMiz602,4.33,"Talk about a stout. This is truly one to throw you over the hill. High alcohol content, high roasted coffee undertones, and about as black as the night.  Smell wise, it smells as if you were baking a coffee infused chocolate cake. It is very roasty and smells quite sweet, which when you taste it, is quite different. It is a drier taste, with a very strong cacao-coffee taste. On the back end of it you can definitely taste the alcohol, and lets you know what you are dealing with. It is a heavy drink, but not very syrupy by any means. The head has a real nice brownish hue to it, and makes for a great sit-back-and-relax beer. It is exactly as advertised, heavy, chocolatey, and a spicy stout that is definitely worth your time devoted to it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,blacklabel67k,2.88,"A- Really thick dark and syrupy... zero light coming through the glass  S-Smells like alcohol with a little bit of chocolate and coffee and roasted malts.  T- Bitter chocolate, overwhelming alcohol taste that ruins the beer imo.  M-Smooth and drinkable.  O- I felt this beer was average at best for the style. The alcohol takes over the taste of the beer once it starts to warm up imo, so I think its best to drink this cold.

45,680,bigaltemple,4.12,"12oz. bottle/Winter 11-12  A - Pitch black in color. Creamy, three-finger tan head slowly settles to half-finger width that provides some moderate lacing.  S - Oh, this smells good. As advertised, dark malts, and bitter chocolate. Cocoa nibs, and mild hint of dark fruits.  T/M - Follows the nose well. Chocolate dominates with some sense of caramel. Coffee comes through as well. Finishes with a bit of bitterness that makes me want to have another drink. Would probably come across as too sweet if the carbonation wasn't right on. It really keeps this from being syrupy.  O - Really well done. Will gladly be looking for more of this one.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Darkmagus82,4.18,"Poured from bottle into tulip shaped glass. This particular bottle was brewed for the 2011-12 season.  Appearance - A beautiful deep black brew, forming a brown foam head upon pouring. While not more then a finger high, it persists; fading only slowly over time.  Smell - A roasted coffee comes big and bold up front. The cocoa then really comes in with some show. A deep-dark chocolate flavor with the slightest hint of vanilla mixed in. At the end there is a presence of some dried darker fruits and the smallest detectable bit of cherry, but these are soon lost in a nice alcohol flavor which warms you through.  Mouthfeel - A nice creamy brew that seems to coat and cling the tongue, allowing the flavors to permeate your taste buds. The wonderful body is only accentuated by a great level of carbonation which subtly tickles the tongue as the creamy brew clings to it.  Overall - A wonderful brew with a great look taste and feel. A holiday beer to sit back and sip. Warms you through and through.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,SLeffler27,3.98,"As promised, this is truly a black beer with a head that is slow to rise but kicks in with that famous cascading action. The head foams to a thick creamy dark chestnut that leaves copious amounts of lace as it recedes like a glacier, never completely melting away.  Chocolate malt fills the nose. Roasted malt is less pronounced than others of this style. Plums, some bourbon, prunes, raspberries, cigar tobacco, and coffee, even surprisingly a little mint in the background.  The roasted malts are much more substantial than in the aroma, bordering on a burnt quality and contributing lots of bitterness. Chocolate is more that of nibs, while the berries are still present. There is a hint of tartness that lasts long into the finish and becomes more lively as this beer warms in the pint glass.  This stout is fuller with a thicker body than expected. It is slick, then creamy with a fair presence of drying alcohol that otherwise would allow this to be overly sweet. Light carbonation.  This beer is more suited to be consumed with a meal but will work with reading or conversation. Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout would also pair well with a cigar.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The flavor is mostly a robust roasted malt with chocolate notes, mostly in the finish. Not as dynamic as the aroma but very smooth as drinkable. Mild hops as well. Full bodied and moderate carbonation. Overall a highly drinkable russian imperial stout, the booze are well hidden.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Tne booze is VERY apparent throughout, as well as the cocoa's bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Heavy bodied and moderate carbonation, with a creamy mouthfeel. Definitely a sipper.

45,680,seedsofchaos,3.92,"True to it's name, BCS pours a rich, dark chocolate brown. A thin tan head made up of carbonation bubbles quickly dissipates and one is left with very little to look at. What one is left with, however, is a fantastic aroma. Dark fruits are quickly apparent in the nose even as the beer is still being decanted. Chocolate syrup, candy sugar and molasses all play heavily.  Immediately, my palate is presented with dark chocolate with the bitterness to match. The dark fruits come through as well but most of the fruitiness is centered around candied plum. The aftertaste centers around unsweetened coffee/espresso. Black Chocolate is smooth and a bit overly so. Typically, with a Russian Imperial, I would expect a brew that sits more heavily on my palate.  For the price, Brooklyn's BCS is a fantastic treat. The alcohol is hidden behind chocolate and smoothness but, for the style, I want just a little more. All in all, this is a solid stout with great drinkability that only really falls short on appearances and mouthfeel.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

A - Just under one inch of dark tan, creamy head; Pitch black appearance; Nice web of lacing all around the glass  S - Notes of dark, bitter chocolate, roasty and sugary malts, hints of dark fruits and tobacco, and just a touch of alcohol  T - Two part taste here: Up front, there is sugary sweet and tart dark fruits and subtle chocolate, followed by a wave of roasty, chocolatey, earthy, and slightly bitter flavors with a bit of alcohol warmth  M - Low carbonation; Full bodied; Creamy and smooth mouthfeel with a fairly dry finish; Has a nice thick quality, though not over-done in any way; A little warmth detected from the alcohol  O - I think this is my first ever RIS and it was really quite enjoyable. The two part taste of sweet, dark fruits, followed by roasty, bitter chocolate was very delicious and left me wanting more than the 12 oz. I had bought. During the Winter months, I think it would be tough to find a better RIS than this one to keep the chill away.

45,680,Luigi,4.15,"Poured into a snifter glass a pitch black color and reveals a tan head that is one finger in my snifter. I am sure that in a pint glass you could get a larger head. After I pour, the retention is a creamy lacing around the glass.  Well the aroma is full off dark and semi-sweet chocolate. There is a sweetness coming from the alcohol and a mild bitterness from the hops as well.  The taste is full of semi-sweet and bitter chocolate. I believe the sweetness pulls through from the high alcohol content (which is noticed but not out of control). Besides the malt, there is a rather tasty dry hop bitterness in this stout. However, the hops do not overwhelm the roasted and sweetness from malt and alcohol. It creates a pleasant balance.  The finish is semi-dry dominated with deep roasted malt and some hop bitterness. All throughout the stout the chocolate flavor pulls through. Not a session drinker, but I certainly recommend it on a night you want something to balance out a great meal or beer on the softer side.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

T- Deep, deep burnt roasted malts dominate. Slight dark chocolate hints towards the middle. Alcohol flavor really kicks in towards the end.  M- Somewhat think and creamy, but not quite the level of most stouts. I'd like to see it a little thicker. Alcohol burn is there for sure. Adequate level of carbonation.

Lots of milk and baker's chocolate smell, along with a little coffee, some nice roasted and burnt malts.  Taste is where this beer shines. I was expecting black and chocolate, and I got both, especially the chocolate. You can almost feel the cocoa powder and unsweetened baker's chocolate, their dryness being a prime component, but even the chocolate flavors are balanced with a little sweet milk chocolate flavors. Roasty malts and just a touch of smoky burnt fill in the gaps.  An extremely easy to drink RIS, despite a tinge of an alcoholic component (expected given the relatively high ABV).  Brooklyn is really a damn fine brewery, and this beer keeps that reputation going strong in my book. I'm always looking for Brooklyn beers!  Having another tonight.

Smells bitter. Dark caramel and chocolate. Roasted and toasted.  T: It hides the alcohol content well with a very strong roasted coffee and chocolate malt that starts off sweet but finishes very bitter. Some dark caramel comes in and then finishes with a roasted coffee bitterness. Needs just a little more hop bitterness to balance it out.  M: Sort of creamy but a little too heavy, even for a black stout. Not bad but it could use a little more carbonation to support the weight of such a strong brew.  Overall: I like it Alot.

This is one of the more respected stouts on the market  A- black darkness contained by my pint glass yet nevertheless the midnight theme almost glows. A slight resemblance of lacing on the sides  S- chocolate mocha espesso beans launch from the get go. An earthy and nutty finish combine completely well. Now this is what a chocolate stout should be like  T- a coating coffee and mocha presentation appears within a toasted malty flavor shows up from the start.

45,680,KajII,4.35,"[Best served in a Snifter]  The pour was jet black with an average sized (1-2 finger) medium brown rocky head that diminished slowly down to a few puddles of residue left floating on top, which allowed some nice sheeting of lace on the glass.  The aroma was robust and tantalizing with roasted black malts, a mild resin hop and a bitter leathery yeast with notes of bitter-sweet chocolate, molasses, dark roasted coffee, a smidgen of dark fruit and a nice dose of alcohol.  The taste was boldly malty and lightly sweet with notes of chocolate and molasses at first and finished with a nice bitter mocha coffee flavor and had a smooth alcohol ending. The flavor stuck around for a nice long time letting the alcohol fade and the mocha coffee taste linger on.  Mouthfeel was thick and full in body and creamy, oily and a bit dry in texture with a nice lively carbonation.

45,680,RAFH,4.25,"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a pilsner glass. The bottle was purchased from Shangy's in Emmaus, PA in December 2011.  This stout pours as a very dark black with a small tan head (single finger of head even with a hard pour).  Smells of dark chocolate and vanilla...ummm!  Flavor began with hints of bitterness and roasted malt and lots of dark chocolate. Finished dry, but very compatible with my palate.  Seemed to taste better as the stout warmed in the pilsner glass. Carbonation was not too much for my taste.  A delicious beer that I look forward to aging to see if the tastes/flavors mature.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Dope,4.18,"Bottle states ""Winter 12-13"" so this is quite fresh.  A: Pitch black pour with a huge, dense medium brown head. Fades very slowly. Huge fluffy splashes of lacing everywhere. Great head retention.  S: Surprising amount of dark fruits initially. A little cherry and raisin primarily. A little swirling and a little bit heated up and there's the chocolate. Dark, dark, DARK bitter chocolate.  T: Chocolate and lots of it up front. Strong and dark with some cream in it. Just the lightest hints of dark fruit, mostly obliterated by the chocolate. Sweetness fades away a bit in the middle and the chocolate turns bitter, baker's chocolate-like. Like drinking melted 75%+ cacao chocolate. Just a little bit of char and maybe anise in the finish, but again it's mostly chocolate. Long lingering dark chocolate aftertaste.  M: Pretty heavy, not overly syrupy though. Fairly creamy in fact.  O: Seriously good chocolate RIS. Pretty much the benchmark of the style while being easy and cheap to obtain. Last time I had this I felt it was quite boozy but I don't really notice that now, despite the freshness. Guess palates change. The only real reason I don't give this higher ratings is because it IS fairly one dimensional - or at least the chocolate overpowers the other dimensions.

Velvety smooth with a fresh made s'mores quality like singed marshmellows and melted dark chocolate.  This is a truly complex beer with wonderful after dinner chocolate goodness and a 10% ABV to boot. Cheers!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Scourge07,3.78,"A: Opaque deep brown/black with a very thick, creamy brownish-tan head. Looks awesome in the glass!  S: Initially milk chocolate when poured which quickly turns into a dark chocolate scent; roasted malts; mocha  T: Dark chocolate with a bittersweet flavor that is well balanced. A bit of a bitter coffee-like aftertaste in the finish. Slight alcohol booziness. A bit of a metallic-like flavor.  M: Awesome! Full bodied and very creamy. Medium carbonation.  O: Nice brew overall. The chocolate flavor is very pleasant and the brew itself is well balanced - not overly sweet or bitter. The only thing I didn't like was a slight metallic-like flavor. It's not a dealbreaker though and the brew would go great with a chocolate desert!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,SolipsismalCat,3.88,"Poured into a snifter. Reviewed alongside Big Eddy Russian Imperial Stout.  A: Black with one-finger, tan, creamy head that lasted a minute. Pretty good lacing.  S: Dark chocolate. Roasted and alcoholic.  T: Moderate sweetness and moderate bitterness. Roasted coffee and a nice nutty finish, which I like. Chocolate of course as well as an alcoholic taste.  M: Medium bodied with lively carbonation. Creamy, slightly dry and very warm.  O: This is a good stout. I would call it close to being a tie between this and the Big Eddy. The Big Eddy looked and smelled nicer than this beer, but this beer tasted better and had a slightly better mouthfeel.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Cord018,4.88,"Had this on tap at Surf Restaurant in Portsmouth, NH. Jet black appearance with a nice creamy head. You notice the smell of chocolate right away but also a nice roasty aroma emanates as well. On the first sip you taste the chocolate and maltiness right off the bat. It is just sweet enough. You also get the slight taste of alcohol without it being overpowering. The flavors compliment each other very nicely. Very smooth, velvet like feel in the mouth. I am a big fan of this style of beer and was very pleased with this offering. Was surprised to see it was at 10% alcohol! Very easy beer to drink and throw back a couple which could become dangerous at the alcohol level.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,elNopalero,4.15,"This pours a thick black with a good amount of foam topping it. (At its strength my six ounce pour was a steal for $2!)  Toffee-espresso roast aromas dance around, and pair off with a roasty dark chocolate flavor along with some heavy coffee notes. There’s a noticeable alcohol booziness (whiskey? Bourbon? Barrel aged?) that hangs around. It has a dry finish. A thick beer, yet easily drinkable.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,akorsak,3.53,"A 12 oz bottle, from the Winter 06-07 version, clocking in at five years of age. In a mini Duvel tulip.  A: Bold and black with an off-white head. Opaque the body, wispy the head.  S: Plenty of rich chocolate in the nose, roasted malts have lost a little.  T: Chocolate is still here, but it has taken a bit of a beating. The roasted malts have done even worse, dropping off substantially. The warmer the ale gets, the more chocolate and booziness come through. They end up being a strong force with enough vinousness still remaining. What's left of the roasted malts turns acrid late in each sip. Good but not what it once was. I'm thinking 3-4 years may have been perfect.  M: Syrupy chocolate and boozy complexity, the stout still beats many on the market.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,stckhndlr,4.61,"A- Pours as black as the label on the bottle. Great 3 finger dark tan head. Good lacing as you drink it down.  S- Chocolate and Coffee malts. There is a bit of a tinge of alcohol in there. Sweet caramel malt as well. The deeper I go into it the more I can smell the sugars. Has a creamy note to it.  T- The caramel and chocolate seem to come out first followed by the coffee in the finish. Has a bit of bitterness to it that lingers. The more it sits it starts to take on a bit of a dark fruit/dark cherry flavor.  M- Thin on the palate yet creamy. Its' a strange kind of feel to it. incredible smooth body makes it seem milky but when you swallow it down it's like it creams up and thickens. So I would say it has a pretty good body to it overall.  O- A pretty good stout with big flavors. I think holding this one for a while and letting it mellow out will make this beer even better. Pick one up today and drink it next winter.  Had this one again on tap and this time the flavors were more amazing. The chocolate notes just burst out of this beer. It was velvety and smooth on the palate and just a fantastic beer. On my last review in Nov. I said that it might be better if you hold it in the cellar and drink it next year. Well I am changing that plea to ""only if you can't get it on tap"". Fantastic brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smell - Complex coffee and chocolate and hop notes  Taste - Like the smell, this is a complex tasting RIS that has some chocolate notes, coffeee, roasted burnt malts and a hop bite in the finish. Very nice beer.  Mouthfeel - Full bodied and buttery in the mouth.  Overall - Really like this RIS.

T-Very impressive balance of chocolate and coffee. Very deep toasty flavor. Flavor resembles more of a coffee stout instead of chocolate stout. Impressive.  M- light body considering style. Wish it was heavier. Although it he weight isn't ideal it does not take away from the beer.  O- Really enjoyable beer. Wonderful balance and delectable flavor. Great beer for a great price. Easily my favorite Brooklyn.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BuzzLitebier,4.58,"This should be somewhere between 4.5 and 5.0 for overall greatness. This beer is awesome! It pours black with a short-lived when poured into a pint glass with some lacing. The smells of sweet dark chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts are exquisite. The chocolate didn't really come through on the taste as much as I would've expected (especially given the name). I also tasted some coffee and burnt malts which tended to linger. It had a thick and heavy mouthfeel with a bit of carbonation. Didn't taste boozy at all. I really, really like this BIG beer, and it is absolutely worth trying if you're into stouts.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jlpepper13,4.07,"Enjoyed from an antique traditional German Pilsner glass.  A: Pours out coffee black and relatively thick with full finger of brown head resting at the top. Some lacing remains after head comes down to a sliver but not a whole lot.  S: VERY strong smell of sweet sweet chocolate that overpowers anything else that could be present. A light tinge of spicyness that I can't quite ID. Not sure what causes this aroma but love it.  T: Again, sweet chocolate prevails. Slight coffee notes comes through as it sits and coats your mouth. Burned dark chocolate creeps up in the back palate that persists from drink to drink.  M: Light to moderate body. Low carbonation that really lets the chocolate soak in. Very slight alcohol burn that is barely noticeable. Leaves you with a dry mouth feel that demands that another sip is taken.  O: Tasty desert stout that is easy to enjoy. Has decent body ,as a stout should, without being overly filling. Love the chocolate taste though it makes it easy to forget that this beer is up to 10% ABV. Super rich and sweet but dries you out at the end.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Beerdregs,4.03,"A: Pours a deep brown maybe all black color. Cannot see through in the limited light in my living room. Ample 1.5 to 2 finger mocha colored head that is leaving a nice ""veil"" not lacing around the glass WOW!  S: Deep, dark chocolate, coffee, some fruity notes present very subtle. I do pick up alcohol smell but not overpowering and not surprising with a 10% alc/vol.  T: Good sweetness but not as cloying as many 10% beers can be. As in the aroma and description this beer is all dark chocolate yumminess. Also pick up on some alc. burn.  M: This is a full bodied stout with a sticky mouthfeel.  O: This is a good impy stout and it is great at what it is says it is...a chocolate stout. If you like chocolate you will like this beer. Myself, if I am buying an imp. stout I would prefer a bit more going on flavor wise. That being said I really think this 2011 version could benefit a year in the cellar to mellow out that alc. burn.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S- roasted malts, dark fruits, dark chocolate, sweet milk  T- malts, molasses, and brown sugar right off the bat. a deep, rich chocolate comes out with some bitterness but balanced with some sweet caramel hints. a mixture of bourbon/espresso tops off this deliciousness.  M- Good carbonation, dry finish with some sweetness. Oily, but running a little thinner than expected, but incredibly smooth. How is this 10.6% abv? Unbelievable.

45,680,malloyca,4.47,"Pouring into a tulip glass, the viscous body is noticeable; it looks to have the consistency of whole milk. A thick, light brown head lasts for several minutes. Prominent bitter chocolate aroma, followed by some black coffee and toasted malt. This carries through on the palate, although chocolate flavors are present they are not cloying and do not overpower the roasted malt. The very thick body creates just the right mouth feel for a beer that tastes like this. Long finish.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Mario61Aler,4.7,"Poured into a pint glass, was black in color. A very thick pour down the side then made a very aggrssive pour for the last 1/5 and received a very nice head that was dark brown and lasting. Lacing was incredible. Happy I used the pint glass, I needed it for the head space.  Aroma was Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Malt had to wait for 5 minutesfor the head to decrease to the point that a sip could be taken.  Taste was Chocolate malts and was very slightly bitter but smoothed out as it warmed. Incredible! This is so balanced. This is the picture that is in the dictionary, when the words Chocolate Stout is used.  Mouthfeel was just wonderful, thick, creamy, soft, low carbonation.  Over all buy it, drink it and repeat seveal times. This will never be a disappointment and it fresh.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,eclipse54,4.32,"A 12 ounce bottle of the Winter 2011-2012 batch that was sent by JM03; thank you for this ""Want!"" Poured into a DFH signature glass.  Pours black with a thin veil of tan/light brown head; a good amount of lacing remains behind, and nice legs course through the surface of the liquid. The aroma is of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, a hint of vanilla, cane sugar, and a touch of coffee. A roasted note is present throughout. It tastes of dark chocolate, faint vanilla, a touch of caramel, roasted coffee grounds, cane sugar, and some muddled grains. The chocolate rush up front is delicious, and throughout the sip this one does not disappoint. Mouthfeel is slightly thinner than expected, but that only adds to the drinkability. Finishes surprisingly clean, and ample carbonation keeps the otherwise syrupy texture lifted nicely off the tongue. Overall, a very good stout that I really wish I had local access to. Would certainly love some more of this one!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ggilman,4.01,At $6.99 a 4pk this imp. stout is a bargain.  Poured into a Sebago tulip.  A beautiful tan cocoa tight bubbled head sits above a deep black cherry body. Ample soapy lace patterns the glass. The nose is chocolate syrup and liqueur.  Rich syrupy chocolate. Maybe a little too sweet. You can taste the 10%. Hints of vanilla extract with a slight bourbon or coffee brandy mocha flavor.  Every bit over the top and imperial. A slick and somewhat creamy mouthfeel make this an enjoyable stout in small doses. One or two at a sitting should suffice. Might work well to cut this with a dry porter.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

A: Ink black, dark tan head, no real lacing, head dissipated quickly, disappointing I remember this leaving more lacing.  S: Chocolate nibs, roasted malts, not the dark coco taste that comes through in a lot of malty brews.  T: Sweet up front, lot of chocolate, chocolate ice cream, some mocha flavors, a touch of oak/bourbon, very very sweet. On of the most chocolate forward beers I've ever head. Some peppery spice in there too as it warms.  M: Thick and syrupy, definite sipper, alcohol is warming, apparent and pleasant; not overwhelm ing. Not a lot of carbonation but I don't need it. Very rich.  O: Drink this at cellar temp, not insanely complex but really f-ing tasty. Great price point, Brooklyn is under appreciated.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Has a rich malty scent. But the chocolate is dominant. This is the most pronounced I can recall.  T - Taste comes as close to matching the scent as one could hope for. Very rich, malty, chocolatey, and with a sweet, boozy bite at the end.  M - Rich, heavy, smooth, and syrupy thick. This is a sipper. I found this more enjoyable after my meal than during. This is a big boy stout that wants your full attention.  O - I had this bottled years ago and don't remember it quite this good. Is it the nitro? Is it better becuase its fresh?

45,680,LeRose,4.35,"This was my first Russian Imperial Stout.  Appearance - dark, almost black.Thick, creamy head that persisted to the bottom of the glass. Foam was pleasantly dark colored.  Aroma - the alcohol hit first, then malty/chocolaty, then a hit of smokiness and possibly a hint of anise/licorice note.  Drinking - expected heavy mouthfeel and found it surprisingly refreshing and clean. Slight bitter hit at the end. Complex flavors - a little chocolate, definite malts, maybe a hint of vanilla that wasn't in the aroma (for me). Not as ""hevay"" overall as I expected, but a very pleasant, drinkable beer.  Enjoyable and I will purchase more (to me, that is the real test).",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,matttttYCE,4.17,"12oz bottle dated Winter 10-11. Poured into a snifter. Thank you very much azdback for this bottle!  The head is about 1 1/2 fingers high, darker shade of tan, and creamy. Recedes after a while, leaves some decent lace. The beer is a deep black chocolate, hmmm.  The aroma is quite nice with lots of velvety, rich, roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, strong dark coffee, darker fruits like figs/plums/raisins (almost rum soaked raisins) in the background, notes of smoke or ash but in a good/complimentary way. Faint hint of marshmallow in the background as well.  The taste is very nice as well. Much of the same - smooth and rich malts, a roasted quality that is wonderfully impressive, strong coffee, bittersweet chocolate, marshmallow, hints of dark fruits, even cherries, and the smoke/ash from the nose.  The consistency is silky or velvety, the carbonation is medium, maybe a bit lower, the body is moderate, and the finish is nice and smooth.  Overall this is very good RIS in my opinion. Probably within my top 5 of RISs. The aroma makes for a buildup and I'm not quite sure the taste can deliver. But surprisingly it does and then some. The taste is wonderful, rivaling some of favorite RISs. Great beer that I'll have to look into cellaring some more of.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Yagman3000,3.95,"Served from a 12 oz. bottle into a Chimay goblet.  Appears really really dark but not in my official ""dark as night"" category. There's a very small filmy foam on top.  Smells of dark roast coffee and bittersweet chocolate. The 10% abv stings the nostrils a bit.  Tastes similar to smell but I pick up a bit of anise. There's a subtle hop bitterness that comes at the end but it's hard to get past any flavor tones other than the chocolate malt.  Mouthfeel is a tiny bit underwhelming in my opinion. For a 10% RIS I was expecting something more heavy duty on the tongue.  Overall I was hoping for more. I haven't had this in a few years but remember it as darker. I guess I'm just jaded and have a palate ready to drink concrete at this point.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

M: Quite thin for a Russian Imperial. Moderate carbonation and mouthfeel. Bitter finish.  O: The mouthfeel is would lend to high drinkability if it were not for the booziness.

As I drink, the head remains, and the glass is left with the marks of my conquest in the form of lacing down the sides.  You can smell the alcohol in this beer, intermingled with the burnt malts and a sweetness reminscient of baking chocolate. Is that a hint of molasses or are you just excited to see me?  You catch a lot of the same fish as the nose, with a slight bitterness that is built by the chocolate alcohol and burnt aspect of the malts, though they mellow into a rounder more roasted slope on the come down. There's a slightly bitter aftertaste to it as well, but not as dominant as many RIS.  Has that dry characteristic that helps remind me of baking chocolate, and good carbonation levels. Overall I rather enjoyed this brew. Sadly, it is not at all available in my area, otherwise I would definitely consider getting it again (cost of course being the mitigating factor).

Smell: Chocolate and roasted malt, maybe a whiff of alcohol.  Taste: Almost identical to the smell, you get the dark chocolate flavor up front followed by a bitter roasted malt finish with some alcoholic warmth. The bitterness is not overwhelming and neither is the alcohol, however they are both noticeable.  Mouthfeel: Relatively smooth, nice finish.

Not my favorite taste, with far too much dark/ripe fruits coming through; think prunes and figs. Some very sweet and oily tobacco too. The fruit combines unpleasantly with the roasted malt's chocolate offering. It's nice that there isn't a lot of cloying going on with this sweetness.

A- Dark black with minimal head when poured slowly into a Chimay glass. Good amount of carbonation present when twirled.  S- Chocolate, dark malts, coffee and alcohol. Almost makes me hope for something in the class of WWS from the smell.  T- Not bad here, a good dark malt/chocolate flavor combined with the coffee making it a nice flavor. The alcohol is a little strong and is easily detectable giving it a bite on the finish that I would prefer better covered either in flavor or decreased percent (this is coming from a guy who likes peaty single malt neat)  M- Here is my biggest complaint on this beer. It feels like water when you dont consider the alcohol. I don't know where people get full bodied but based on its thickness and flow I honestly think it rates more as a porter, the only reason they call it a RIS is b/c of the alcohol percent. Thicken this up and I think the body will go well with the alcohol and flavor  O- I still think the potential is here due to the flavor and aroma of this beer, but it comes off as a porter to me, and a slightly burning one at that.

I get a cream taste in the middle that doesn't taste like a dark chocolate.  Mouthfeel: there is a good carbonation in this brew with a little burn from the high ABV. but very enjoyable.

Medium carbonation. Medium/heavy lacing.  S: Big chocolate malt notes along with caramel, coffee, char, and a bourbon scent that I believes comes from the dark roasted malt. Hops are noticable as well and have a relatively pronounced representation on the nose given the quantity of other ingredients in this beer.  T: Huge chocolate deep roasted malt notes along with a nice hop presence. Alcohol is noticable on the secondary palate. Aftertaste is slight char, hops, and chocolate malt.  M: Full bodied. Given the ingredient heavy nature of the beer and the full/thick/creamy mf that results, the hops in this beer counter and balance the malt very thoughfully.  O: Fantastic fresh. Amazing aged.

The fact that this beer is so ingredient heavy would make one expect for the palate to be bogged down by malts, but the hops in this beer (when fresh) balance the flavor and leave an almost wet/salivating sensation after each sip. Top notch beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BrewerB,4.25,"08-09 version that I've been hanging onto since it was originally released. I've sampled this beer numerous times over the years but this is the first time I've reviewed.  Poured into a highball glass, this is espresso black with a tan foam on top. Good lacing and legs.  Dark cherry fruit in the nose with charcoal and a sweet chocolate also present.  Luscious chocolate, and caramel. Raisins, smoked wood. The medium-long finish leaves traces of tobacco.  Silky, medium-full textured with a moderate low level of carbonation. Hefty on the tongue.  An excellent winter sipper, this is layered, luscious, and complex. One of the first russian imperial stouts I sampled, to this day it remains a favorite.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Finatic,4.35,"12oz bottle poured into a Cigar City sifter.  A: Pours a thick black almost motor oil with decent light brown head that retains a decent lacing.  S: Dark chocolate, strong coffee and burnt malt offerings. Quite a decent hop profile as well.  T: Loads of dark chocolate and a great array of roasted malts, coffee and anise spring off the palate.  M: Very drinkable for such a creamy stout.  O: I will be seeking this out on a regular basis.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TheMultiYeast,4.3,"Flowed from the bottle into pint glass, slightly viscous, nearly black, forming a thick brown head.  Smells is pungent and robust with dark roasted chocolate, rich malts, roasted coffee and aromatic hops.  Taste provides layers of chewy toasted malts, some burnt chocolate cake, more coffee, dark dried fruits, a punch of hop bitterness and warming alcohol.  So thick and substantial, chewy and smooth.  Grab this one before it's gone!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,tobelerone,4.33,"Can't believe I waited this long to try such a quality stout. Pitch black color with a big fluffy brown head, good retention, decent lace.  Aroma is chocolatey, roasted, molasses, anise, coffee..traces of a metallic note underneath.  Delicious and full flavored, very roasty, again a good mix of chocolate and coffee with anise, tobacco, molasses and a touch of hops giving a bit of bitterness that cuts the sweetness.  Medium body, medium-to-low carbonation, sticky and slightly chewy. Nice thickness overall.  Wow, I gotta say I am knocked out by this beer. This thing costs less than 2 dollars a bottle! Probably the best bang-for-the-buck in the style you can find, certainly the best I can remember.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,dlello2,4.07,"A - Pours quite thick with a half finger of coffee-colored foam on top. Retention is nice with large bubbles remaining both in the middle of the glass and around the edges. Great alcohol lacing, ring of thick brown/red foam clings to glass forever.  S - Whoa. Quite strong. Heavy bourbon and chocolate. Smells thick and delicious (I'm a fan of distinct and boozy aromas). Alcohol.  T - First sip sent a chill down my spine--suppose that's from the alcohol. Not really getting any alcohol/bourbon taste suggested by the intense boozy smell. Mouthfeel is thick, carbonation is nice. While it's cold here I'm getting most of the chocolate taste well after the swallow. Some hops in the beginning, lots of malts and coffee in the middle. Definitely getting a touch of alcohol in there. Some earthiness, some dark fruits. Nothing unpleasant!  O - Really a nice beer. Looking so much forward to this a year or two down the line once the bite is gone. Regardless, such a good beer for roundabouts $2 a bottle (from a 4pk).",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,LaCoursiere,3.94,"Limited Release - Winter 11-12. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter.  A - Black like overused motor oil with a 1/2 finger tan head. The head dissipated quickly leaving a collar and small patches. There is minimal lacing  S - I get molasses and coffee with subtle fruit and floral hop notes in the back ground.  T - Coffee and roasted malt up front with a hint of soy sauce. The finish is an excellent mix of roasted malt of pine hop bitterness. I get a hint of dark chocolate late in the finish.  M - Smooth and a trifle syrupy. The body feels more medium than heavy with light carbonation and finishes slightly dry. There is a little bit of alcohol warmth  O/D - Excellent RIS for the price point. It's quite drinkable as it stands, but I think this would be super-drinkable in a year if I could make it last that long.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,azorie,4.63,"I poured it into a mug and waited for this one to warm up. I am reviewing my last one of 12 (3 4 packs)  A: black of course, with some creamy white head. No lacing I noticed.  S: at 51f, its boozy, coffee like hits the nose. Some caramel and chocolate also. Some dark fruit like currants, almost quad like. ok even at 60f not much changed.  T: lots of sharp black coffee and chocolate, with a nice burst of booze. no hops detected. Smooth, almost Bourbon like. Rich sweet candy like malt flavors.  M: a tad oily, low carbonation, medium to thin body.  O: I really enjoyed this beer, and since I am out of beer after this one, I hope there is still some left at the tw. I really think this ris is one of the best ever. So happy the local tw had a big pallet of these left. So I bought 2 cases!!!

45,680,jjanega08,3.43,Winter 11-12 vintage on the label  A= Pours a deep black color with a tiny layer of head on it that rises and falls with relative ease. The color of the head is a nice tan color and there is a surprising amount of lacing for the little amount of head on it.  S= The smell doesn't carry as much weight on it as I would have expected. There is a definiate chocolate note in it as well as some sweet dark fruit in the nose but not nearly as intense as I would expect from a RIS. A nice sweetness to it that I expect will balance the chocolate bitterness.  T= The taste brings together my suspicion of sweetness balanced by bitter chocolate. The chocolate plays the dominate role for sure with this one and the sweetness takes the back seat. I almost feel like there may be a hop bitterness as well but I'm sure it is just misunderstood chocolate. There is also a nice roast character that I didn't pick up in the nose and the sticky sweetness I smelled is dying by the second. There is a little alcohol in the taste but nothing to deter the deliciously powerful taste.  M= The mouth on it is a little light. Not as heavy as the typical RIS that's for sure.  O= This is a quality beer that's for sure. It isn't what I expected from the hype however. I like the beer a lot and I would buy it several times over but I guess I expected something more after hearing about it so much. A thicker mouth may change my mind and do it justice but until then it is what it is.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,trxxpaxxs,4.2,"A: Pours a pitch black with a solid full finger of mocha head. The foam clears in a moderate amount of time. There is a some thin lacing as it drinks, but this brew doesn't have a ton of legs.  S: This beer smells of raisins, milk chocolate, roasted malt, and brownie batter. There is very little alcohol in the nose for a 10% beer, but then again, it is a stout.  T: Starts off with a quick hit of raisin, but shifts swiftly into the velvety chocolate and roast malt characteristics that I picked up in the nose. The high ABV comes through for only a second as this beer transitions into the finish. I'm then greeted by more raisin and smooth melted chocolate.  M: Full bodied beer. It's sweet and silky from start to finish. There is a bit of cloying stickiness, but it's not offensive. Really pleasant.  O: I think this is a great late season seasonal beer. Actually... I feel like this could be an all-weather beer if Brooklyn wanted it to be. The flavors and feel of this beer are spot on.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,02maxima,4.36,"Bottle poured in to a pint glass  Pitch black through the entire glass. Small head that dissipated quickly into a tan collar with a thin film of bubbles on the surface.  Malts, slight alcohol and a touch of dark chocolate. Maybe a bit of apple on the second smell. Cocoa is definitely coming through on this whiff.  I taste the coffee and dark chocolate. The flavor is very complex. I notice a bit of toasted marshmallow. Delicious.  Mouth is thick an carbonated if that is possible.  This is a great beer that I will look forward to ever year. The chocolate flavor reallly comes through in both the nose and taste.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,stephenjmoore,4.2,"A- Very dark with no transparency. Tan head that stays around.  S- Roasted malts with a slight hint of chocolate and maybe some toffee.  T- Very malty with hints of chocolate. The malt definitely dominates with the chocolate mostly coming from the dark malts. Some hop flavor actually came through which is surprising for an imperial stout. Only a slight alcohol note.  M- Smooth and creamy, full of flavor but very drinkable.  O- Not as chocolately as I was expecting, but a great beer with uniqueness and great drinkability.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,droyce,4.83,"I was really excited to bring this one home, right after the pour I could tell I was going to enjoy this it.  A - black like motor oil with a thick creamy mocha head, great looking beer S - a malty sweet dark chocolate T - alcohol upfront but not bad for 10%, roasted malty goodness, barky dark chocolate M - smooth but not overly thick O - overall a great IRS, really enjoyable beer!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BBThunderbolt,4.72,"I love this beer and was surprised to see that I hadn't reviewed it. Thanks to OKComputer for popping open a bottle to rectify that situation. Poured into snifter and served alongside a homemade Old Rasputin brownie.  Poured black, with just a thin cap of brown head that had good retention and light lacing. The aroma is a wonderful blend of chocolate and malt. Only the slightly overpowering alcohol scent detracted from the olfactory joy.  On the tongue, the story was the same. Big, solid base malts supporting just enough chocolate to satisfy this choco-holic. The body is appropriately full and smooth, but again the alcohol presence took a bit of the happy away. Drinkability is dangerously excellent. I have drank 2 22oz bottles in a sitting before (and I rarely have more than a pint of any 1 brew at a time) and will happily drink this beer most any time. Overall, a true classic of a beer. A must try if you haven't.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Chocolate lingers until the end. Alcohol re-appears toward the end as well.  m: medium body. low carbonation  o: A solid RIS and a great value to boot. Looking forward to aging a couple of these. Still very smooth and drinkable fresh. Drinks a bit hot but did not bother me at all. A nice way to take the chill off a cold autumn evening.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Neorebel,4.4,"Pours black as night into my pint glass with a frothy, tan colored head. The roasted malt aroma is creamy, with hints of milk chocolate and a touch of coffee. A sharp, yet subtle sweetness is present in the background as well - could it be from the esters or perhaps from hops? As the extremely full bodied beer coats my mouth, pleasantly bitter dark chocolate flavors erupt at first, with a bit of raisin, giving way to a dry spicy finish. As I drink, the head clings to the side of the glass as it should. This beer really warms you up, but I wouldn't say it is not 'drinkable...' I put mine away rather quickly! I'll definitely get another six pack before the winter's out this year!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,cps98,4.12,Ended up splitting a case of this with my good drinking buddy. A great deal for me!  A – Black as night with a thick 2 finger toffee colored head.  S – Sweet chocolate and light on the coffee  T – Dark chocolate was the power packing force in this one. Light coffee undertones from the roasted barley.  M – Super smooth a very nice blend of sweetness and alcohol. Medium bodied.  O – Overall a really nice stout that’s big on the chocolate. I will continue to enjoy as I work on this case!,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Microbrewtaster,3.83,"Appearance: There us a large 2 finger head on a medium pour, the head is a mocha color with hints of red or amber. This head has a good retention time and sud like bubbles on the side of the glass. The Liquid is Black and opaque a nice looking RIS off the bat.  Smell: The first smell that comes in is a light alcohol scent followed by malt and chocolate sweetness, possibly a hint of prunes or raisins or a dark fruit. after a long slow whiff gives a a dryness to the nose.  Taste: the initial taste is that of mocha followed by chocolate and a real biting alcohol presence showing the 10% ABV that is there.  Mouthfeel: This is a thick beer that has low carbonation but definitely has a warming sensation that lingers due to the ABV.  Overall: This is one of the more bitter/warming RIS that i have had. it is creamy, but a little bit of time may do this beer a little more good. will probably break out another in about 3 months and the others will be shared or saved.

45,680,DoubleSimcoe,3.66,"Black Chocolate, 32-oz growler filled at the new Brew York City / Duane Reade on Broadway at 76th in NYC for $5.99.  I have had these beer many times, but this is the first time I enjoy it from a growler.  Appearance: Gorgeous and classy-looking on my Lost Abbey chalice, with a deep shiny black color and a beautiful, prominent coffee-colored that lasts and lasts; thick soapy bubbles on top. Great lacing, retention, carbonation. An outstanding presence.  Smell: Sharp booze, rum-soaked wood. Coffee. Spice, dank hops / bitterness (a bit unpleasant). And a dryness that gets in your nostrils! Maple and some plant-based sweetness at the end? Reminds me of sipping on Founders CBS, believe it or not.  Taste: Follows nose, with a more pronounced coffee side that reminds me of Founders Breakfast. I don't get much of the chocolate... a bit of sour funk and barnyard lactic feel.  Mouthfeel: Full flavor, medium body and carbonation. Correct but a tad thin for the style, and unfortunately overtly bitter. Smooth and creaminess are AWOL. Bone-dry finish with spice and clover. After opening and closing the growler a couple of times, the bitterness recedes and some chocolaty creaminess appears.  Overall: Black Choco is all over. I've had horribly bitter versions of it and smooth and creamy pints, both in tap and bottle. It changes between seasons and serving types. Last week I had a bottle of this current year ('11-'12) and it was beautiful. This growler is too bitter but still alright. What will be next? It is, in any case, a mighty drinkable beer, and always a good deal. No trace of 10%, I could polish a growler of this and still stand tall and strong.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Jammies,3.72,A - pours a deep black. A very thin layer of foam quickly disappears.  S - The chocolate was detectable from about a foot away.  T - Much smoother than I expected. The chocolate isn't overwhelming. Slightly hot at the finish.  M - Slightly hot. Smooth with a medium body. Not too heavy for a stout.  O - Dessert in a bottle.

45,680,hippityhops85,3.41,"2009 vintage on draft at the Blue Dog in Lansdale, PA. Poured into a 13oz tulip glass.  Pours pitch black with a beautiful mocha colored head that forms excellent lacing on the glass. A really beautiful stout.  The nose carries bittersweet chocolate, toasted malts, pretty muted although I really had to let this warm up as it was served insanely cold.  After about 20 minutes of allowing it to warm I tasted it. The taste had lots of bitter chef's chocolate that almost came off as metallic. Kind of let down but this. Lots and lots of bitterness.  I've only ever had this brew on draft and after reading the great reviews on here I think I need to try it out of the bottle because the draft has never done anything for me.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TheDinger,4.15,"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Pitch black pour with 1+ finger of dark tan head that stayed around for a while. Minimal lacing, but a beautiful beer. Smell is quite complex with coffee, molasses, raisin and some notes of vanilla and chocolate. Very favorable aroma following turkey dinner. Taste mostly followed the nose, but had a good bit of licorice on it. Was wanting more of the chocolate to come through. A little boozy, but too be expected with the 10% ABV. A pretty good balance otherwise. Mouthfeel is what you would expect from a RIS. Thick and creamy a bit of silk with adequate carbonation. Overall- A can't say this beer was fantastic, but it is a very good sipper to close out a chilly evening. Wanted more chocolate and coffee and less licorice. Solid effort from Brooklyn and I would have no problems hitting another after some aging. Quite Tasty-",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,coreyfmcdonald,4.33,"12oz bottle into a tulip glass - from the latest release? Re-reviewed on 8/27/12 from the Winter 2010/2011 release. I've since had a 2011/2012 bottle, a bit over a year old and I think the sweet spot for age of this beer.  A: Pitch black pour with 2 fingers of fairly dark brown head. It recedes slowly and sticks around on top of the beer forever. Beautiful beer. The head from the aged bottle didn't last nearly as long.  S: Right away I get intense roasted malt aroma with coffee, dark chocolate, and significant licorice and toffee.  Molasses, dark fruits, and milk chocolate are more prominent in the aged bottle. Licorice is still very significant. I also get a good amount of oxidation.  T: I get an odd bitter flavor that overwhelms everything else - a bit too heavy handed on the hopping for me. In the background, I get great dark chocolate flavor with a lot of roastiness. Maybe the beer needs sometime? The ABV is also quite apparent.  The aged bottle is a completely different story. Very complex, the beer starts off with lots of dark chocolate, roasted malts, smooth black coffee, some nuttiness, and a very nice smokiness in the aftertaste. Molasses are in thr background. This is one of the most complex beers I've ever had.  M: Medium to thick mouthfeel - quite good. Very creamy.  O: Not sure what to think here. If it wasn't for the odd bitter flavor, this beer would be exceptional - too bad it's quite strong. I've got a 2 year old bottle and will drink it soon to compare.  The aged beer is really quite nice. Very complex, balanced, and quite flavorful. Aged, this beer is wonderful - so complex, so delicious. With a year on it, this is one of my favorites.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Appearance: Black used motor oil color, pours with a finger of brown frothy head that settles into a thin lacing on the surface of the beer. Looks very oily, dense, completely opaque. Slightly below average lacing, which is to be expected from a 10% ABV beer. 4.5/5  Smell: Bitter chocolate and earthy hop aromas. Some raisins, light cherries, a little vanilla. Some booziness. 3.5/5  Taste: A little alcohol burn at the front, but super creamy bittersweet chocolate on the mid-palate. Some coffee beans, hints of dark fruit and oaky vanilla. This one is pretty complex. Finishes with super bitter chocolate that lingers quite some time. 4.5/5  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, oily, with minimal carbonation. Finish is very dry. 4.5/5  Overall: A little less balanced than some Russian Imperial Stouts, but overall very flavorful and complex. I love beers than linger, and this one sticks around.

I get notes of vanilla, dark woods, charred grains, as well as some bitter cocoa and coffee aromas against a slightly sweet alcohol backdrop. Beautiful.  The taste is more chocolately than the nose would suggest. There is a significant amount of bitterness between the roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee flavors, but it is balanced out by the syrupy-sweet nature of this big stout.  Sorry for the brief review.

Of what was there, before it dissipated, the head was a dark mocha coffee color.  S: This beer is quite heavy handed on the chocolate, it has a nice background note of sweet cherries. Smells like chocolate covered maraschino cherries. Delicious! The alcohol comes in though a bit on the nose as well.  T: The alcohol hits your right up front with a small burn, followed a blast of roast and finished with a punch of chocolate and a tad of dark fruit.  M: Full bodied and lightly carbonated, it also comes though somewhat dry and leaves a grittiness on my palate.  D: Quite low, but it's good like that.

The taste has chocolate, coffee, alcohol, and raisins. A sweet beer, with bitterness provided by the coffee taste. A nice flavored beer, and I almost gave the next highest mark for taste, but decided against it due to the alcohol heat. This should age very nicely.  There is a sticky, chalky feel to this beer. Full bodied, creamy, modest carbonation, and the alcohol is not well disguised, which is unfortunate. I like this beer quite a bit, and am glad to have the rest of the 4 pack to finish. At $7.99, this beer is a steal. I think I will age some of this. I think it will be really good with about a year on it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,zachary80,3.22,"Nice dark tan head is surprisingly uniform and smooth. Great lacing, okay retention. Totally black body.  Aroma is slight alcohol, light roast, sweet.  Flavor is bittersweet chocolate, although the chocolate is not very well rounded out is too one-dimensional. Bitterness from the malts is fairly high. Slight metallic taste is off-putting.  Mouthfeel is slightly astringent. Somehow it comes off as too thin given the rest of the character, not sure if it is the carbonation or what. It feels like there will be be more body at first but lets down.  Overall a good beer, wish it had more body. Actually I'm not quite sure why I like the beer since I can't say many positive characteristics. Sum is greater than the its parts for this one.  A note on aging - at one year it was nearly impossible to tell apart from fresh; the biggest difference was in aroma and there weren't any notable improvements.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Notes from last night *12oz bottle using a 10oz taster Nonic glass  A: Pours a super dark brown if not damn near black with a sort of garnet edge on it. Real tight bubbles form a turbinado sugar colored rim and just some bit of alcohol legs down the sides of the glass.  S: Smells of deep rich roasty sweet malts. Some char character with dry roasted coffee notes. Alcohol. Not really much chocolate present in the nose.  T: Taste is super rich and decadent with dark roast malt flavors, dark chocolate, sweetened dark fruits and coffee beans. Slightly sweet overall with some alcohol presence but actually quite balanced at 10% ABV. Very robust and juicy with chocolate flavors. A big step up from the aroma here.  M: Heavier body and relatively viscous but with nice carbonation so not too syrupy. Sugars do coat the tongue providing a nice silky smooth mouthfeel overall.  D: A big rich stout with some great chocolate malt flavors. More of a sipper at 10% ABV and a touch sweet but with enough balance to make for a nice smooth drinking experience.

45,680,brandon911,3.97,"Served into a Chimay Chalice.  Pours a very dark brown, almost black, opaque beer that allows no light to penetrate. I didn't get much of a head at all, though it wasn't poured very aggressively. The little bit of a head that was apparent had great retention and lacing. Smell wise, it doesn't have too much there, though it smelled great. A lot of roast and coffee and some alcohol, for a chocolate stout though, there isn't much chocolate there unfortunately. I loved the way it tasted, though once again, there isn't much chocolate. A lot of coffee, some smokiness and roasted malts. A little alcohol is apparent, along with a little vanilla. The mouthfeel is almost perfect for the beer. It's nice and creamy and delightful.  For some reason, I had a kinda rough time finishing it. I guess I may have gotten a little full or maybe bored, I dunno, maybe kinda distracted.  Overall though, I really liked this beer. It was a pretty good price at like 7 bucks on sale for a 4 pack at Specks. I'm definitely excited to have another.

Slight bitter black coffee presence is there as well. Not too much of a lingering aftertaste. Finishes very clean with a slight alcohol burn due to the high abv.

S: Heavy coffee, roasty note here with not much chocolate to be found. Smoky aroma in there with some char and anise. Surprisingly not really all that chocolatey.  T: Much like the smell: not much chocolate to be found here, but a LOT of roasted coffee and some smoky notes laced in there. Some mocha as it warms which might lend some cred to the chocolate name, but overall more coffee. Some bakers chocolate as it warms more, but no sweetness to be found. Definitely an imperial stout rather than a chocolate stout.  Overall: As a RIS, pretty good. I can see this being a good one to age, but on tap it was pretty tasty.

Getting some coffee and maybe some raisin deep down. Man, this tastes good. Huge chocolate notes at the outset. They really taste creamy and full. The coffee, roastedness picks up halfway. The end finishes smoothly. You can tell the alcohol is trying to get out, but it's deftly kept at bay. Still tasting some raisin on the far back end, though I think that's just the chocolate malt combating with the alcohol. I prefer Old Rasputin slightly more, but this is a very good Imperial Stout.

45,680,claspada,4,"Sampled the 2004 version next to the 2010 version.  Pours black without being terribly thick with a nice mocha head and a bit of lacing. Foam recedes much quicker on vintage edition.  Aromas begin with espresso and fudge brownies. Smells quite sweet with loads of chocolate and some roasted malt. Hints of anise and molasses in the most recent version. You can also detect the delightful zip of alcohol in there. In the vintage version you get a lot more dark cherry and coca cola notes as it warms.  The tastes directly reflect the nose of each. The recent version has an unstoppable coffee-chocolate presence. The flavors hit hard, full, and quite unforgiving. Finishes leaving behind a bitter coffee essence to punish the tongue. The older vintage has that coca cola dark cherry syrupy sweetness. Finish has a less boozy/bitter presence than the newer version.  The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with medium to low carbonation. Both are quite solid in this department. Newer version is drier with more of a bitter/alcohol finish. Older one is a little sweeter and creamier.  Overall, I enjoyed this side by side tasting. You would have no idea that these are the same beers or even from the same brewery. Neither is a star for me but both are solid beers. I think I would probably imagine a vintage in-between these two would be the best. Probably a bottle with 2-3 years on it would be the best balance of flavor in my opinion. A solid beer either way that is often overlooked because it is so readily available.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The 10% surprised me at first esp for the price(7.99 a 4 pk) and the aroma was slight coffee the rest alcohol, wasnt my favorite.

45,680,hmf05,4.12,"Pours stout dark with a two finger tan creamy head that seems to be sticking around. Aroma is chocolate malt balls, grains, dark chocolate, and some dark fruits. Smells amazing. Taste is dark chocolate all the way. Nice and sweet, yet noticeably bitter. Alcohol is slightly noticeable, but not overwhelming at all. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy with tepid carbonation. Overall, very nice brew. My main complaint is that this is pretty one dimensional. The dark fruits that came through in the aroma are nowhere to be seen in the taste. Bitter dark chocolate is the most dominant flavor here. Nice for the price, but there are many other RIS/Chocolate Stouts that are better.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MikeSr619,4.76,"So, Im at Room 11 in DC and having some local beers and I ask the server Chelsea, ""hey, whats the Brooklyn Dark Stout like?"". Im from California and had never had one but Im nervous of what some people call stouts. Im used to them being big, bold, in your face thick beers and didnt want to be disappointed. She said, ""you have to try one"" and brought me one back.  OK, so I take the bottle and pour it in to the glass and it looks as black as used motor oil coming out of an ol john deere tractor. NICE! All my friends are looking at me like Im nuts for even wanting that beer but this is my style!  I smell the beer..once again, NICE! It smells like a good stout and very chocolate.  The taste..well, I sat there speechless for a few seconds while trying to digest all the great flavors and when I looked up all I did was nod at her.  All in all I ended up having 6 of these bad boys and went to the store the next day so I could bring one home to SD for my friends to try.

Enjoy.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,RISky,4.28,"Poured into pint glass from bottle. Deep dark black with one finger tan head that fades back into body within minutes.  Smells strongly of chocolate up front, hint of coffee and malts with strong backing of alcohol in the end.  Taste is much the same as the smell, full chocolate body, thick and heavy as a RIS should be. As with most RIS' this one will be phenomenal after a year or so. However as deep and complex as many RIS are this one is heavy in only a few areas, mainly chocolate (Obviously) and coffee. Then the ever present alcohol taste which will cool off as time ticks by.  Mouth feel is a little less than what is to be expected from a RIS. Focus of chocolate and coffee leave the aftertaste of both as if one had just drank a cup of weak coffee with pure cocoa mixed in. Not quite as creamy as a RIS is but time heals all wounds.  Over all good, good, good. Real close to great and maybe it will excel as a cellar beer. The only reason it got a half point less in taste was limited complexity of flavor, but still quite a good beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,VncentLIFE,4,"Review is for cellaring purposes, but its still a review of fresh BCS!  11 batch poured into a GL snifter.  Pours a pitch black. Like no light passes through even when help up to the light. Very thick caramel head that stays around.  It smells like an unflavored RIS. Roasted oats are everywhere mixed with booze and smoothness probably from the oats. Not overly impressive, but not bad.  Well I mean, I guess they call it Black Chocolate Stout for a reason. Milk chocolate isnt there; it's all dark bitter chocolate. After all the breakfast stouts I've had recently, the dark chocolate is kind of refreshing. Just like every previous time, it's still hot. The booze is a touch too much for me; after subsequent yearly reviews, maybe the booze will mellow out (hopefully).  A serious candidate for Bourbon-barrel aging. It could use that finishing touch of smoothness. It just feels a tad too rough around the edges.  It leaves a roasted feeling from the malt and bitter chocolate. It has a nutty feeling, that really isn't all that displeasing.  **UPDATE** 4 months has lightened the body, mellowed the booze, and brought out the belgian black chocolate. overall, a very good beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ahq514,4.17,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into Duvel tulip. About a year old.  Pours a black color. Small head, but pretty decent for an RIS. Diminishes off to a lumpy film. Light specks of lacing.  Love how intense this aroma is. Its full and somewhat roasty and has some rich milk chocolate. Slightly sweet, and very faint coffee.  Very flavorful and complex. Right up front, the sweet chocolate comes through, followed by a nice blast of roastiness. I like how they used a butt-ton of roasted grains without it becoming too dry or bitter. Nice touch of warming alcohol on the finish.  Nice full body and low carbonation. Pretty drinkable for 10%.  A very enjoyable stout overall. Nice sweet chocolateyness and roastiness. Will be anxious to see how this is with another year on it. Will enjoy again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Taste was more of the same, although at 10% ABV there was a little bit more of a flavor of alcohol than I would have liked. This isn't to say that it wasn't good, but I'm not sure if I'm going to make this one of my everyday stouts - it's a big beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Nuke77,3.51,This is a very dark beer. No light passes through the glass with this one. Very small head when poured right down the middle of the glass. Aromas of burnt malt and light hops. I tried this cold out of the cooler and let it sit a while and warm up. Taste was very malty with strong accents of burnt grains. I tasted no chocolate flavor whatsoever in this brew. Not a favorite and for my money not in the class of Founders' stouts.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ummswimmin,4.3,The boards really go nuts for this beer. It is about time that I try it out.  This beer is as black as midnight on a new moon. You can't see through it. It looks like one of the darkest beers I have seen.  The smell off the top is extremely rich. You get a ton of roast and chocolate (but no coffee).  The flavor is equally rich. It languishes on the tongue with a ton of stout flavor and the presence of chocolate. On the back end you get a decent amount of bitterness along with the flavor dwindling.  Overall this is a very good example of a chocolate stout. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Obviously Gordon Ramsey has a lot to learn about beer after seeing him spit out this great concoction.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Small spots of the head are darker as it settles down on top of the beer leaving some room for the beer to shine through. Little bit of lacing on the glass as it goes down.  S- Dark chocolate, of course, lots and lots of coffee on the nose as well. Smells to have a little bit of hop profile. Roasted malts coming through strong, not barrel aged but smells to have some oak like characters.  T- Sweet on the toungue, coffee and chocolate comes up first. Sweet roasted malts and a little bit of smokiness. Alcohol pokes its head out. For whatever reason, this reminds me of a less harsh Dark Lord.  M- Thick and slick. Medium carbonation. No complaints.

45,680,fountainofyouth,4.46,"Bottle from a four-pack poured into a standard pint glass.  Appearance: Pours darkest brown, basically black. Absorbs light like a black hole; even the edges of the glass are opaque. The initial pour built a three-finger brown head that filled its way to the top and sent a lone drop sliding down. This beer looks mean.  Smell: Appropriate intensity. Burnt sugar and barley, with both bitter and sweet chocolate. A little bit of herbal hops in there, too. A restrained scent of alcohol, too. Softer caramel is kept in the background.  Taste: A broad, robust profile. There's some spicy hops throughout, but the primary flavor is black patent malt in its charred glory (but without being ashy). There's a little bit of alcohol, but for 10% ABV it's not much at all. There's not much sweetness here, except for a bit of toffee malt. Definitely on the bitter/coffee end of the spectrum, and not fruity.  Mouthfeel: It's pretty creamy, medium-bodied. Finish is a little dry, but the mouth stays coated for the most part. Standard carbonation. The alcohol numbs the tongue a little over time.  Overall: Intense and as black as can be, no wonder it's a seasonal! Try it if you think you can handle it!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,seesnow3,4.38,"Heavy Seas Pint Glass, no freshness, $2.50/bottle.  Pour-This is probably the darkest, most opaque beer I have ever seen, or at least tied for that title. Head directly against an overhead light fixture, and a bright one at that, you can see hints of light around the very edges of the beer and that is it. No light will ever penetrate to the center of this beer. Originally, pouring the beer produced a small head of foam, but quickly faded to a thin film with a thick ring of foam wrapped around the inside of the glass.  Nose-Cocoa powder and caramel malts. Definitely some chocolate malts in here, smells like rich chocolate syrup in the background. There is not much else going on in this one, except maybe a hint of dark roasted coffee, and possibly just the slightest whiff of dark fruits like raisin, but the chocolate definitely takes over the entire aroma.  Palate-A hit of sweet that fades quickly to give way to a huge astringent, sour taste. There is also some bitter but the sour takes over. The main note is without a doubt chocolate, almost like chocolate syrup chocolate (though less sweet) or a creamy bittersweet chocolate that melts in your mouth. Both of these are combined with a cocoa powder taste, since the sour sensation is so strong. Noticeable alcohol on the palate.  Body-Thick, incredibly heavy and creamy, this is definitely ONLY for the dark beer lover, and it does a great job at being just that! You will feel just a hint of bubbles on the tongue.  Final Thoughts-This stuff is excellent. I would say it’s not necessarily a well balanced beer in the sense that it is so sour, but the flavor intensity certainly matches the body. Nothing overwhelms the other. This is really great but only if you plan on drinking no more than one beer. Note the alcohol percentage, this stuff will knock you down, it’s a lot more than it sounds like. This particular brew is seasonal so grab it while it’s still on the shelves!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,KickInTheChalice,4.2,"Served on tap in a tulip at Hopleaf.  Appearance: My pour is an ebony black color with a modest tan head. The glass was  Smell: The aroma is full of deep, dark roasted malts, lots of Belgian chocolate and fudge, and a bit of smoke and molasses. I don't take any hops away from the tap version.  Taste: The flavor is also dominated by the chocolate flavors. The dark roasted malt is noticeable, but it immediately pairs with a sweet and sticky fudge flavor and some dark, unsweetened chocolate flavor as well. A little bit of coffee and smoke step in on the periphery to give it a more robust taste, but the focus on the chocolate is never lost. The finish is semi-sweet with more chocolate.  Mouthfeel: The thick, creamy, and viscous feel of Black Chocolate Stout is one of the strengths. The carbonation adds to the creamy feel but is on the light side overall. After each sip I am left with a sticky sweetness on my lips.  Overall: This was significantly better on tap than it was in the bottle. The unpleasant booziness in the nose and flavor were both thankfully absent, allowing me to focus on the better parts of the beer. This is still kind of a one trick pony as far as imperial stouts go, but it was enjoyable.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,ccarney2,3.93,"Appearance - Deep brown to black color with about a finger of toffee colored head that vanished quickly. Very little to no lacing.  Smell - Wow, lots of sweet, roasted malt in the nose. You can definitely smell the 10% ABV right away, I was a little worried that the alcohol would dominate the taste at this point.  Taste - This is really where this beer shines, and worries about the strong alcohol taste dominating quickly vanished. The flavors in this beer are very complex and work well together. Initially the taste is very sweet and there is a definite cherry flavor, but as soon as you start to exhale, all the bitter dark chocolate really shines. The chocolate, almost coffee flavor lingers for a while in your mouth.  Mouthfeel - Silky smooth feeling here, with very little carbonation. It completely surrounds every nook and cranny of the tongue and almost has a thick/syrupy feel.  Overall - This beer was a pleasant surprise, I've heard good things about Brooklyn Brewery for years, but I've never really been very impressed by any of their offerings. This changed that though, this brew was quite complex, effectively hid the high ABV, and left a wonderful dark chocolate taste in my mouth well after finishing the glass.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smell is definitely alcohol with roasted malt along with plums and a hint of bitter, unsweetened cocoa.  The taste reminds me a lot of unsweetened cocoa. This flavor seems to dominate the taste along with burnt caramel, plums, and a touch of dark coffee which I attribute to the roasted malt. There is no alcohol burn but a very noticeable and pleasing warmth.  The mouthfeel is full but is not too sweet and sticky.  I found 3 of these in my fridge from 09-10 and I haven't had this beer since so nothing fresh to compare it to. I will say that this beer has aged wonderfully and is an exceptionally smooth, easy drinking RIS.

45,680,weizenbob,3.76,"This 12 ounce bottle was purchased at Siciliano's Market in Grand Rapids, MI for $2.19. It is the Winter 2011/12 vintage. It was warmed to 55 degrees and poured into a tulip glass. A moderately aggressive pour yields a finger of mocha colored head. Retention is moderate. It recedes quickly but never fully goes away. Lacing sets up a holding pattern between sips. The stout is very dark, but a small amount of translucence reveals some light peeking through near the bottom of the glass.  In the nose I'm getting plum, alcohol and a small amount of unsweetened cocoa. It is rich, yet undistinguished. It smells like a lot of other stouts, maybe just a bit stronger.  The flavor on the other hand is very nice. Cherry makes a mild first impression, blending into some rich but nicely roasted malt. The alcohol is pretty hot. It's 10% ABV and still young so I'm not surprised. I've read a lot about the literal chocolate flavors that people taste in this stout, but I'm not really getting that. Sweet malts persist through the finish, but not in a way that says ""chocolate"". However, it has been amply hopped with a good amount of bitterness poking through toward the end. There is a nice smoky aftertaste that I'm really enjoying. The profile is fairly complex, though the balance would do well to be tweaked. And where is the chocolate? It's the name of the beer.  In the mouth this is a full bodied beer, but it doesn't come off as being that heavy. The carbonation level is kept to a minimum. The low carbonation and high alcohol make it a pretty smooth beer with a velvet viscosity. I don't know though. I prefer a thicker feel in such a high gravity stout, particularly one that I've been lead to believe will be chocolate-like. It has a good feel, but I expected more.  Overall this is pretty good, though it definitely did not meet, yet alone exceed my lofty expectations. It is a competently brewed imperial stout; nothing less and nothing more. A big positive mark in this beer's favor is the fairly low price point for the style. I would buy it again if I was itching for a big stout and didn't have the big bucks in my pocket to splurge on a bomber of something more premium.  ---  The Two-Schlitz Scale: (see my profile for an explanation) The selling point is that this is a great value.

Almost got a 4.5, but just a bit too sweet up front. M- Lots of body to it. Smooth and creamy. Just a slight astringent note. O- This is a very very good beer worth seeking out.

A: Pours an almost opaque black as the name would indicate - just a touch of mahogany around the very edges when held up to the light. Not a lot of head at all, probably due to the aging.  S: Definitely a lot of roast. You get the booze as well...and that bittersweet dark chocolate smell. Some anise and vanilla...  T: Wonderful chocolate bittersweet characteristics. Alcohol wouldn't be at all detectible if not for the warming. More anise. A ton of roast and char in the back end. Fairly complex and the chocolate firmly takes hold as it warms.  M: Medium to full bodied beer. Not a lot of carbonation, but it's not needed...this beer has plenty going on w/o it.  O: A very good example of the style, but not as complex as it could be.

45,680,animalchin,4.18,"2011-2012 Series  A - Opaque black body with a nice and deep tan head. Rather dense lacing paints the glass like an abstract brush painting, leaving a minor presentation of a heady surface.  S - Dark and enigmatic bitter, cocoa aromas upfront followed by the most faint sweetness of dark caramel and European mocha. Bitter malts soon take over everything, leaving behind underwhelming traces of the initial smell.  T - A dense and overtly bitter introduction of chalky cocoa and espresso that then progresses into a rather apparent sweetness that resembles once again of the caramel quality within the smell. In general, everything is rather condensed with many of the tastes masking one another. It is because of this that a new sip brings a new experience of taste each time.  M - A heavy and murky chewiness with rather dense carbonation that does not let up.  O - Certainly one of Brooklyn's best beers. A seasonal that teases you all year long until the holidays.

Appearance: Pours a very dark, basically black color with a finger thick, creamy head that leaves a good amount of lacing and retention.  Smell: Very boozy at the front, and roasty through the middle of the smell. I barely pick up on the hints of chocolate though. Leaves more chocolate to be desired in my opinion but great aromas none the less. I also get hints of coffee.  Taste: I can definitely taste (and feel) the alcohol. The hops give it a slight bitter taste that reminds me of unsweetened coffee. Very strong and rich like an espresso. The taste of chocolate is very subtle.  Mouthfeel: Between medium-bodied and thick. Took me longer than an average beer to sip this one.  Overall: Good stout to drink on International Stout Day 2011.

45,680,bsp77,3.7,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Snifter. 2011 vintage.  Appearance: Extremely dark brown that appears black. Nice brown head at first that dies down but leaves some light lacing.  Smell: Dark chocolate, molasses, char, cream, licorice, booze and just a touch of coffee.  Taste: Very strong roasted malts, with char, dark chocolate, smoke, dark fruit and coffee. Very meaty tasting. Acrid bite at the finish, more from the roasting than the hops.  Feel: Very smooth full body that is slightly marred by a light chalkiness. Quite warming.  Overall: In many ways this is a very good beer, but it has been roasted within an inch of its life, leaving a strong burnt taste. Considering the style and my expectations, I am somewhat disappointed. I will need to cellar my other bottles and see if the charred taste and chalky feel improve with age.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Hophead717,3.62,"A: Dark as the night. A very thin bit of dark brown head appears after a vigorous pour, but quickly dissipates.  S: It's like sticking your nose into a bar of dark chocolate. It's a bitter chocolate scent that greets the nose-no sweet notes to be found. There's a little something extra in the nose that I'm having trouble placing, it may be some dark fruity notes, but they're at the edges.  T: Tons of roasted malt upfront with a forward dark chocolate flavor. Definitely a bitter beer. There are slight hints of dark cherries around the edges, but they definitely take a back seat to the bitter, roasted, chocolate malts.  M: Surprisingly thin for such a big beer. Not in a bad way necessarily, since it's a fairly smooth drinker, but I was a touch surprised.  O: Good, not great. I have a couple more bottles that I'll enjoy, but I'm unlikely to pick up another four pack till next year.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,minnesotaryan,4.52,"2011/2012 release poured into a Surly Darkness Goblet.  Appearance: Pours a nice deep dark black with a finger of khaki head that quickly dissipates.  Smell: Lots of chocolate and malt, and has a good amount of booze in the nose as well, this smells good and strong.  Taste: This tastes like a dark chocolate bar that then proceeds to burn your mouth with alcohol fire. There is some bitter dark cherry flavor which balances nicely with the roasty caramel malt flavors.  Mouthfeel: This is a beast, very much a sipper, chewy, good carbonation, not too much lingering flavor.  Overall: For the price this is exceptional, lots of flavor and you can get them in 4 packs. There was a lot of hype about this beer, but in my opinion it exceeds the hype.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,isitsavage,4.09,"Poured from 12oz. bottle into a snifter, winter 11-12. Black with about a finger or creamy brown head, faded pretty quickly, light lacing.  Intoxicating smell, a good swirl brings out a lot of chocolate that is difficult to pin down. Bottle says it is brewed with six types of dark chocolate, so I guess that is why the chocolate aroma is so complex. A lot of roast/toast in the nose too, some breadiness, very malty, slightly alcoholic.  First taste is quite bitter, chewy chocolate, malt, cream, and coffee notes stand out. After a few more sips it gets sweeter and quite smooth, both dark and milk chocolate, there is a very light hoppiness to it. The bitterness is very well balanced out now and only lingers at the end, light coffee, hops and alcohol, some burnt wood flavors. Very nice, complex.  Full bodied, slightly prickly, very smooth and drinkable. Doesn't really coat the mouth, lingers a bit and the bitterness keeps me sipping.  Very nice overall, and at the price it could be my go-to stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,57md,3.58,"Pours a dark black with more than a finger of head and decent retention. The aroma is slightly malty, but nothing to write home about. The taste is robust and malty, but this offering lacks the roasted bitterness I enjoy in a good stout. The alcohol burn is also far too sharp for the 10% ABV. This may be a beer where the reputation is better than the actual product.  January 2017 update: I sampled a three year old and two year old version of this beer and experienced something brand new - the essence of soy sauce. I have always wondered about claims from others that certain stouts taste like soy sauce but I never experienced this before. Both vintages smoothed out alcohol-wise but I just could not shake that nasty soy sauce taste.  After trying this offering over numerous years both fresh and at various ages, I am finally ready to give up and accept that I just don't like this beer very much.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Decent two fingers of dark tan head that quickly fades into a thin patchy layer. A moderate amount of lacing sticks.  Smell: Smells as dark as it looks. Lots of dark chocolate with dark roasted malts and a hint of coffee. Also some strong hints of dark fruits and earthy hops. Smells very bold and sweet.  Taste: Like the smell, a big presence of dark chocolate with lots of dark roasted caramel malts. Some good notes of coffee come in midway. Has some nice hints of dark fruit with dark cherries. Also some light hints of earthy hops. Fairly sweet but the bitterness of the chocolate balances things out. Very tasty.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Very chewy and creamy. Starts sweet and finishes dry. No heat from the alcohol is felt.  Overall: A great imperial stout. One of the best out there and you can't beat the price.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Rifugium,3.83,"First had: bottle from Pinocchio's beer garden, Media, PA  Poured a jet black with a dark mocha head; very little retention or lacing. Aroma of brownies! and dark malts. Roasty taste, dark malts and bittersweet chocolate, with hints of coffee and a pervading booziness. About medium in body, perhaps just a little too on the thin side for the style, but still pretty good, and definitely quite drinkable. Probably the best beer I've had from Brooklyn.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MsRif,4.55,"Hot damn. Russian Imperial Stout is my favorite style...and this one is exceptional. Pours a black color with a chocolate head that recedes into a thin ring leaving beautiful, albeit spotty, lacing. Smells of roasty malts, bitter chocolate and coffee. Tastes like it smells. Finishes dry, starts sweet. VERY enticing. Not overly complex, but well-balanced and drinkable, especially given the 10% ABV.  Full-bodied with light carbonation. Creamy. This is a delicious beer that is dangerously drinkable. I love having this one in cold weather. Highly, highly recommended!!!!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,fmccormi,4.15,"Straight pour from 12oz pry-off bottle to my Cigar City snifter; bottling date of October 9, 2011 (Julian code: “2521 1023”) printed on the neck of the bottle in yellow ink.  Appearance (4.0): Fine-grained head the color of coffee ice cream expands slowly to two solid fingers, fading far MORE slowly to a solid half-finger. Lacing on the side leaves a sheet on the far side of the glass. The body itself is black, and . . . black. Nice looking RIS.  Smell (4.0): Apparently, the name of this beer is descriptive: dark chocolate. Like 80+% cocoa kind of dark. And, that’s about it, but it certainly fits the bill for what the beer’s advertising.  Taste (4.0): Chocolate starting dark and bitter but mellowing and becoming richer towards mid-palate; very modest coffee note finishes out the malt profile, and the finish shows some grassy hops adding a nice, understated, balancing bitterness. There’s an astringent coffee note that lingers, no doubt partially from the grassy hops. Whatever yeast is in here is buried pretty far deep into the bottle, but that’s okay. No alcohol to speak of.  Mouthfeel (4.5): Not the MOST viscous beer in the world, but it’s still very smooth on the tongue, especially with this velvety carbonation—just like in the head, incredibly fine-grained. Body itself is medium-full. I suppose it could be thicker, but this smoothness with that body is and excellent combination. The mouthfeel is like that Irving Berlin song, “You’re Just in Love”: a rubdown with a velvet glove.  Overall (4.5): I might have liked something like this to be a little fuller, just a hint sweeter, maybe a bit of oat happening in here to anchor some more intense chocolate / coffee action, and I can always use a little more head (that’s what she—no, I said), but damn this is a good beer. Those would go more along with an American Double / Imperial Stout, anyway. If someone asked me what I was drinking and said “Black Chocolate Stout” and gave them a taste, there’d be no question as to why it’s named so. This is an excellent, excellent beer, and at this price point ($7.99/ 4-pack) there’s no question that this is one of the best values around. Really great.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,aorloski,3.71,"Appearance - Pours an amazingly beautiful dark as night black, khaki head that sticks around. Looks world class.  Smell - Smells like weird chocolate, the only way i can put it. Dark chocolate right up front but not in the bitter hop kind of way. It is more like melted chocolate mixed with alcohol. This being said it does smell pretty good. Oatmeal and chocolate are forerunners, not a single coffee note to speak of.  Taste - Definitely follows the nose. chocolate, big big malts on this one, i can't taste any bitterness which is strange for a big chocolate stout. You get a little bit of the alcohol but not much. Just overall it is a well balanced beer.  Mouthfeel - So good, thick, chewy, coats the mouth and perfect carbonation.  Overall - i LOVE this beer because it is cheap and readily available. It is the BEST stout you can buy for the price and availability. Is it the best? no. Is it awesome? yes. Buy it. It really is a great brew and buy plenty of it throughout the winter. Thanks brooklyn!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,SWMeyer4141,4.35,"Poured into a claret.  Appearance-Dark black body, no light shines through. Head is a tan 1 to 2 finger head. Nice lacing.  Smell-Very nice bitter dark chocolate. Some sweetness and some roastiness, a touch of smoke I get as well.  Taste-As good as I remembered it, it's been a while since I had one. Tons of dark chocolate, but some milk chocolate sweetness does come through. No dark fruits and very little coffee, just a lot of chocolate malts. For being pretty fresh, the alcohol is pretty much not there.  Mouthfeel-Creamy, pretty thick and a little chew to it. Carbonation is perfect, it really lets the flavors shine.  Overall-The best part about this beer is and always will be it's price point. 7 bucks a 4 pack! Really glad I got a case as well, only 38 bucks. Thats 1.60, pretty amazing.

Nose is full of rich, deep dark chocolate, mild nuttiness, a little meaty and a nice mild touch of mocha coffee.  Nice, big robust flavor and pretty good balance. Starts of with a nice robust mocha/coffee flavor. Almost a rich brownie. Then into a mildly pale, almost slight chalky finish. But it's weird, I only got that in a few sips, not all. Overall nice flavor.  Mouth is full bodied, nice and velvety viscosity with a med-high creamy carbonation.  Overall a great beer/Imp. Stout. I wish this made distribution to my side of the country as a seasonal. Although it seems you might not want to sit on this one, because mine was fresh, Winter 11/12 and I really liked it. My buddy, who loves stouts, didn't like it too much with a year of age on it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

T: Sweet malts give way to bitter roasted notes with a mocha/ milk chocolate finish.  M: This beer coats my mouth with a delicious chocolate film. Slightly creamy feel gives way to crisp finish.

Just a bit on the sweet side with a good amt of bitterness and some alcohol thrown in the mix - but it is complemented so well that it never slaps you in the face. I swear I get a slight flavor of some sort of berry in the finish. unfortunately it seems to become more one-dimensional to me as it becomes room temp M - just great...creamy, medium-bodied, smooth, slight carbonation...can't really ask for more O - A great brew and for what it is it can be bought very cheaply...been a fan for a while but finally got the urge to review",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

It does leave behind a slight film on the top of the beer  Smell: A little roastiness upfront traces of chocolate and alcohol  Taste: Upfront I get some roast but quite a bit of alcohol is present and this beer is a year old so it's kind of surprising to me. The beer is quite syrupy and there are very slight traces of dark chocolate notes on the back end.  Mouthfeel: Full body low carbonation a tad silky and a hint of alcohol heat  Overall: The name of the beer for me was a bit misleading because I expected big chocolate notes and they are just not here.

S - A lot of chocolate, a little burnt malt, and light coffee  T - Coffee is more prominent in the taste than the aroma. Bitter chocolate and malt round it. As previously stated this is where the only difference was evident when aged a year, slightly less bitter.  M - Nice and chewy, light carbonation, don't notice the alcohol much.

T: Again, lots of roasted malt and chocolate flavors at first, then comes some dark fruit like sweetness (prunes come to mind again). Finishes a tad boozy with roasted malt bitterness that lingers. Some age on this and this would be very well melded together. It already tastes somewhat aged and this is this years version.  M: Fuller body, soft, yet a decent amount of carbonation.

Reminiscent of port. Hints of dark chocolate and coffee.  Flavour really reminds me of port. Background of dark chocolate, dark roast coffee and burnt malts. The alcohol is very evident and leaves a warming feeling in the back of your throat.  Full bodied. Thick mouthfeel with minimal carbonation.  Wow, the booze is really upfront and this is a really strong tasting stout. Maybe too much alcohol for my liking as it overpowers alot of the other flavours.

This year's edition, in my opinion, might be the best balanced BCS compared to the last several years. Very drinkable.

S: Roast and a touch of booze. A nice dark chocolate as the name suggests.  T: Very chocolatey with a touch of cherry-like dark fruit. You can tell it's 10% alcohol but that almost is essential to the flavor and not cloying at all.  M: Full-bodied with more carbonation than I expected. Very nice.  D: Gonna be easy to drink.

Taste matches scent...booze is not as prevalent as i thought it might be, but still there for sure. Uber-bitter chocolate on initial sip fades as the beer warms. Man, this is one you want to let sit...take your time with it. Taste mellows a bit.  Wow...this is an f'ing smooth beer! Goes down so easy...very lightly carbonated...perfect mouth-feel for a big stout. Booze is just a bit noticeable though...the only real flaw. No big deal though.

The head is creamy and has good retention for stout and leaves very good lacing.  Well, chocolate, of course, is the prominent aroma. Light coffee and roasted malt blend in as well.  The flavor is different than I expected from the aroma. A bit of bitterness from the roasted malt and coffee flavors is present in equal measures with the sweet chocolate flavors. I applaud this blend as I am not generally a fan of overly sweet beers.  Medium to thick mouthfeel and only a minor notice of the alcohol.

45,680,nppeders,4.53,"First off let me say that I don't love RIS's that taste like prunes, raisans, and all those dark fruit flavors that you usually get from big stouts. I saw the chocolate stout from Brooklyn (where no chocolate was used in the making and thought... hmmmm... maybe this is my thang!)  appearance - motor oil, no light shall get through. Tan head. three fingers dissipate and leave great sticky lacing.  smell - caramel, toffee, prune, and little bit of roast.  taste -starts out with a little bit of dark fruit. No hops to speak of, pretty sweet in the middle, and then finishes of with a blast of dark sweet chocolate. Very well balanced. Probably the most balance flavor profile I've had in a stout. I like that it finishes with the chocolate!  mouthfeel - carbonation is low-medium and perfect for this still for me. Not to thick or thin but a nice medium mouthfeel...makes it drinkable dispite the 10% alcohol which doesn't seem to assert itself until it warms to cellar temps.  overall - For my tastes, this is just right. The dark fruits are present, but not overpowering. The chocolate is at the end of the taste which hits you really nice. Solid beer, and the best one I've had from Brooklyn. Get's better and better as it warms and the alcohol becomes more assertive!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Piliper,4.61,"Served in out of the bottle into a pint glass.  A: The appearance is pitch black. No hints of red or brown around the edges. Absolute motor oil black. It pours thick from the bottle with a generous 3 finger khaki head. Great lacing as well.  S: The smell is intense. Definite banana up front with faint hints of roasted dark coffee. Some caramel and spice as well.  T: The taste... oh, the taste. Other worldly. An incredible stout. An incredible beer... period. You are definitely hit with the coffee that was evident in the smell right up front. It's semi-sweet, but not too much. Very malty and the alcohol is hard to decipher. At 10% ABV, that's a dangerous thing.  M: The mouthfeel is very full and thick. The motor oil like pour is evident here. Sticky and almost chewy.  Overall: possibly my favorite stout. I'm a huge fan of Convict Hill's Oatmeal Stout, but the low ABV in that brew makes it difficult to judge in comparison to this. This stout doesn't have the annoying over carbonation that some of the higher ABV stouts have and the smooth nature of the brew is almost too good to be true.

Makes you long for the next sip.  Overall, this might be the best bang for your buck stout you can get. $7.50 for a four pack and this stout is sublime. I will make it a point to buy a four pack every time that I go to buy beer until it is off shelves. So you can run and tell that homeboy",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S: Dark chocolate, toffee, molasses with a surprisingly noticeable hop profile.  T: Semi-sweet chocolate, roasted coffee beans, hops poke through and resonate in the aftertaste. Slightly too bitter for my personal taste.  M: Medium bodied, slightly dry.  O: Solid stout, and I'm very glad that I have three more to drink!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BUNZILLA,4.28,"12oz bottle poured into a large sniffter  Appearance : pitch black in color with no light penetrating through this brew. A nice dark tan head appears after a vigorous pour that dissipates to a ring of bubbles. If you agitate the glass the head will slightly reform.  Smell : lots of toffee and dark chocolate dominant the aroma. Also picking up on some alcohol aromas as well.  Taste : huge dark chocolate flavors here and not any bitterness. Not overly sweet but has a nice carmel malt backbone.  Mouthfeel : full bodied brew with adequate carbonation,not sticky sweet but has nice mouthfeel.  Overall : this is a great chocolate stout I'm glad I picked up a four pack. I think this brew will improve with some age on it. Definitely needs to be drank on the warm side to enjoy all the flavor this beer has to offer",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,WMEugene,4.57,"Poured into a tulip glass.  A - Rich, velvety black color with a thin brown head and nice lacing. An attractive stout.  S - Deep, dark chocolate. Smells like one of those fancy dark chocolate bars. Nice hints of roasted malts as well. If you like the smell of chocolate, you will be in heaven.  T - Flavors of dark chocolate and roasted malts dominate. A bit of alcohol in the taste as well. Hints of coffee/espresso in the background.  M - Medium to full-bodied with a nice level of carbonation. A little bit of a dry finish and alcohol heat in the aftertaste.  O - The Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is a delightful winter seasonal and is a must-have if you love (dark) chocolate. The dark chocolate flavors are delightful and it's aroma is fantastic.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ShanePB,4.1,"Vintage '11-'12, poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip.  A: Deep black body with a bit of dark brown around the top edges and on the pour. Mocha colored head with tight bubbles and a very creamy nature to it. Lots of sticky lacing and a spotty cap make up a seriously great looking RIS.  S: Dark roasted chocolate malts, caramel, bitter dark chocolate cocoa nibs, slightly roasted coffee beans and touches of vanilla towards the back end. Not too rich or sweet, very dark and roasted in nature.  T: Milk chocolate, bitter dark chocolate and roasted coffee beans again coat the mouth. Mid palate is some powdered chocolate, and finishing somewhat sweet with an added honey-like flavor to it. Well balanced, not overboard in any certain aspects. All in all a very well done beer.  M: Well carbonated with lots of tiny bubbles giving this a thinner feel on the palate. It's not watery but certainly could be a bit thicker for the style. A weak point of the beer but it does somehow retain a certain creaminess to it.  I remember having the same impression last year with this beer; very solid, relatively inexpensive and dangerously drinkable. I have a bottle from last year in the cellar and plan to do a mini-vertical once next years batch comes out. It looks to be a good cellar candidate but we'll see how these hold up over time.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

O- for the price, this is one of the better stouts I have had. The complexity is what did it for me. I was expecting just a ""chocolate stout"" and ended up with so much more.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JMad,4.08,"I drank this from a snifter...  Pours black with a lofty, frothy brown heads that stays pretty consistent. The smell is dominated by unsweetened dark chocolate, roasted malt, black coffee and hint of alcohol. Tastes of bitter dark chocolate and load of roasted malt, some coffee and a slight alcohol bite. The mouthfeel is thick smooth and silky, low carbinaton and a dry finish. This RIS can hang with the best, I really enjoyed the chocolate flavors in this beer, and that it wasn't sweet.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mechamifune,3.63,"(this is for a winter 11-12 bottle)  Pours a not quite pitch black. .5in brown head develops and stays for a good while. Lacing is very heavy....appears a little over-carbonated for the style.  Smell is lots of roasted malt, chocolate, and alcohol. The usual suspects as far as big IS's go, but as a whole it's not as inviting as some of the best examples of the style.  Taste is pretty in line with the smell. The flavor notes are there but come across a little abrasive rather than blending together. As a whole its still a relatively pleasant taste and to style (aren't IS's supposed to be a little abrasive, after all?).  Mouthfeel has a little bit of a chocolate milk quality, but it could stand to be just a little smoother. For me, mouthfeel is probably the most important element of an IS (or at least it's far more important than in other styles), and this beer just doesn't really stand out enouth in this category to compensate for the harshness of the flavor profile.  Overall this beer works at its given price point and is a good, middle of the road, IS. It's worth picking up a 4 pack and cellaring a couple for comparison. Just don't expect to be blown away.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,diamondc,4.32,"11-12 vintage.  A: A typical RIS pour ... black motor oil, light mocha colored head. Not much head retention though. Some light lacing.  S: Cherries, moderate roast, slight smoke, coffee and chocolate (duh..). Very vinous.  T: Dark fruit flavors initially, figs & cherries. Followed by an intense dry roastedness. Hot nuts and dark chocolate. Some moderate light pine hop bitterness at the end. Superb.  M: Another RIS sipper. Booze is apparent, but not distracting.  O: Some nice complexity. Still have one from last year being 'cellared'. Always look forward to this beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JohnnyChicago,3.9,"I keep here people raving about this one. Although I found the bottle very pedestrian and average, I though I'd give it a shot from a growler. Purchased the growler from New Beer Distributors; poured into a snifter.  A: Pours a deep, dark brown with two fingers of white head.  S: Smells like a dark chocolate bar next to a bowl of cascade hops. Its rich and bitter, but inviting.  T: Tastes like an RIS! Its chocolate promise carries through with a strong cocoa nib flavour, but the vicious hops provide a lasting bitter backbone. Finishes dry and boozy.  D: Alcohal is still a little too present for my tastes. Not too much difference between the tap and the bottle, which is weird. Especially considering how much better that growler of Stone RIS I had was.  Overall: I still don't get this stout. Its solid, don't get me wrong, but its far from the top echelon of RIS, or even chocolate stouts. It is just too boozy and unbalanced for my tastes. However, the price certainly is right.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,miromanyth,4.25,"I really enjoy this one during the long and dark nights of winter...  A: Viscous, melted chocolate, with a nice dark chocolate head...  S: Licorice up front - I get a big licorice note on this before anything else. Toasty malts, raisins, bitter chocolate, and some booze. Smells great!  T: Follows the nose. Black licorice, and semi-sweet chocolate. A roasted quality begins and ends with the swallow. Perhaps a smidge of a hop bite, with a nice warming finish that reminds me of kahlua  M: Cream.  O: Superb beer - absolutely perfect for the cooler months. Sip on this one and watch the leaves change :)",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Immortale25,4.59,"Poured into a Delirium Tremens snifter. No readable freshness date.  A- Pours a black (duh) motor oil color with some bubbles sticking to the glass's edge but no head really. Good lacing, although short-lived.  S- Roasted coffee and chocolate but not sweet-smelling at all...until you get to the alcohol which is present but not noticeable right away  T- Burnt toast, coffee again, chocolate naturally. Not especially strong though, given this beer's 10% ABV. Yeah, real smooth with a roasty aftertaste that I enjoy even though I don't usually prefer stouts. There is a slight bitterness from the hops but it takes a back seat to the dominant maltiness of the brew. So easy-drinking for such a high ABV but it's not very boozy at all. Quite remarkable.  M- Thick and viscous. Leaves that gooey saliva build in your mouth that's hard to get rid of. This could be a good or bad thing depending on where you're coming from. Low-medium carbonation makes sense in a beer as heavy as this.  O- Brooklyn's hit or miss but it seems like their high alcohol percentage beers are usually the ones that do it for me.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Agold,4,"Drinking the fresh 2011/2012 version of this beer. Beer is black as always with a tan head with a bit of lacing and a nice ring around the outside of the glass. The aroma is chocolate with mild coffee and roast aromas. There is a bit of caramel as well. The flavor is very nice, chocolate takes front stage, but there is a distinct fruityness that is present as well. There is also a bit of roast. This beer is pretty thick and pretty smooth, but there is a bit of maybe acidity (not sour or infected at all, maybe some acidity from patent malt?) that cuts it a bit. Good carbonation. This beer is a very solid readily available imperial stout. Got some last year, and am in the infant stages of building a vertical. Big fan.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

A slight smell of dark fruit, a light smell of lactose and dark chocolate.  Tastes of dark fruit, fairly sweet, a slight taste of oxidation and a light taste of alcohol.  Bottle From Winter 08-09: A two finger frothy tan head forms on a black brew, the head receeds to a small ring of bubbles and light lacing.

I am also getting a tiny bit of alcohol.  The taste is by far the best part of the beer. The chocolate and roastedness just explode on my palate. The chocolate taste lingers and it is just amazing.  The mouthfeel is very smooth. Feels great in my mouth with a good amout of crispness.  Overall this is the best beer from Brooklyn I have ever had. It is just so tasty and enjoyable.

Up front sweet, roast character with a creamy chocolate character with a sweet, bitter character that has some awesome coffee and alcohol and ends on a roasted note. Complex and damned tasty.  Full bodied with a lower carbonation...not heavy or cloying though.  A big, complex stout that I look forward to every year.  *Update: I tried this next to a one-year old bottle and the aged bottle had a huge coffee note in the finish that lasted forever. It also had a creamy taste and a much more muted hop character. It tasted less ""bright"" and more subtle. I liked both versions for their respective tastes.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,ElizabethCraig,2.85,"Split a bottle of this with my husband on 10/1/2011.  Lets start this review with my kind of apology/explanation.  I really do like stouts! I don't always like Russian Imperial Stouts, but generally I do like stouts!  Really!  Ok, here goes:  The appearance was dark black with a slightly tan head. There was more head in my husband's sample glass than in mine, but that happens sometimes.  Scent: dark, acrid, slightly sour. I'm slightly concerned at this point, but my mind is still open.  Sigh, the taste is where I just didn't get it.  Dark dry and musty that fades to a dark very acrid/burnt chocolate. Ends slightly sour on my palate. Not sweet, not sour, really *ashy* like extremely charred coffee.  Body is medium to rich. Very nice texture to it.  I'm not a fan of this beer at all. When I drink overly dark roasted poor quality coffee, I start getting pain in my hands and knees (my bad spots) and this beer flared up these tender/painful points just like overly charred poor quality coffee.  I'm not giving up on the style since generally I like stouts and I like some RIS's, but this is not the beer for me.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

I am not getting a ton of chocolate nose or flavor, but still quite nice. Would get this again and recommend it to other fans of sttouts.  VERY GOOD, WORTH TRYING!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,etaggie09,4.1,"appearance: very deep black. pours with a two finger head that dissipates to an 1/8"" cap and leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass.  nose: this honestly smells like chocolate tequila to me. that isn't to say that it smells alcoholic because it doesn't. it just smells like you took that salty, limey, agave taste and smell of a good blanco tequila, threw in some chocolate and voila! It also smells a little bit like brandy. Again it reminds me a lot of liquor, but it is not alcoholic or offensive. It really seems like it has just removed brandy's and tequila's base aromas and just removed the alcohol. Enjoyable to me because I love to drink both brandy and tequila.  taste: it was very roasty and bitter at first, but it rounds out quite nicely as it warms. it definitely keeps that roastiness aspect, but it becomes more milky and choclatey. It sometimes does relay the notes that are in the smell. A little saltiness and limeyness come through. Very enjoyable.  mouthfeel: viscous, but not like motor oil. decent amount of carbonation, too, which is very nice. i can't really find anything wrong with the mouthfeel. It's really top notch.  Overall: this is a damn fine stout. It's kind of one of those situations where it's a technically great interpretation of the style that just lacks a little oomph to push it over the edge, but not like Flying Dog's Raging Bitch was for me. This beer was also genuinely enjoyable from a less intellectual place than the raging bitch was. In all honesty, I would definitely tell someone who was looking to get into stouts to try this one first. It hits a lot of notes that other stouts do and it does them all very well with maybe just a tad too much restraint.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,flannelman808,4.1,"A: The deepest Mars black with the most subtle ruby red highlight ever. This stuff is crazy opaque... Almost no light shines though (even on a tiny wine glass pour). It's topped with a tan head which has ok retention and pretty solid lacing.  S: Super duper rich milk chocolate bon bon (the legit french deal filled with chocolate mouse which is more dense than then our sun).  T: This stuff is crazy effing rich. Wow, I'm glad it's my dessert and I would recommend everyone else to look at it that way. Seemingly infinite layers of chocolate of varying cacao percentages. Hidden deeper, hop driven, bitter citrus peel (orange, lime) sneaks into the scene almost pushing the line between bitter and tart... awesome!  M: Devils food cake  O: This is truly a dessert beer. And it should make for the best vanilla beer float of all time. Sweet and bitter merge, finishing sweet (too much so but what the hell). A must try for lovers of the style!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The head was caramel colored and about a finger thick but was gone in the time it took to stick the bottle on the counter.  As you would expect, it smells of bakers chocolate and coffee. There is a hint of booze that sort of overcomes the other aromas,it is 10% so I'm not surprised.  Rich malty chocolate, coffee and a little bit of licorice hide the alcohol a little but it's still a beast.  Overall tasty, but there is a little missing on the finish, it just gets a little thin at the end. Its a solid beer that has all the working parts that an Imperial Stout with Black Chocolate in the title should. I dug it and would buy it again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S: Bakers chocolate & coffee. Roasted malts bring in the back of this nose. Almost indistinguishable through the alcohol. Disappointing.  T: Boozy. Hints of bakers chocolate & roasted malts. Alcohol overwhelms the taste as well.  M: Low Carbonation, thicker mouthfeel, typical of the style.  O: I had high expectations & was let down by this brew.

45,680,ehammond1,2.69,"Bottle (2010)  Thanks for sharing Sam!  Jet black pour with a light brown, tan head that sticks around, then leaves lots of lacing down the glass. So far, so good.  Sharp alcohol is the first thing I notice unfortunately, and I have to search for the chocolate. When I do find it, it's somewhat sharp and too sweet, not rich and decadent like other wonderful chocolate stouts. There's some nice roasted malt and coffee elements that try to balance it out, but it's dominated by alcohol and over-sweet chocolates.  Sharp and stinging bittersweet chocolate (like cocoa powder), alcohol bite, something metallic, and mild roast. Not a lot of complexity, and not a lot of good.  Medium to thick mouthfeel with low carbonation.  Too much alcohol and the chocolate does not come in an accessible, enjoyable form. Too bad.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Bitterness starts to overtake in the middle through the end. Chocolate settles off pretty quick too, still very smooth drink.  M- Full body. Low carbonation, almost none. Creamy mouth feel.

Smell: The overwhelming smell is a sweet boozy aroma. Notes of sherry, molasses, and licorice. Surprisingly there isn't a lot of chocolate aroma.  Taste: A sweet boozy flavor hits you first followed by a strong roasted malt flavor. The dark chocolate flavor is much more apparent in the taste than in the smell. The taste is sweet up front with a slightly bitter finish due to the roasted malts and dark chocolate flavors.  Mouthfeel: Medium thick mouthfeel with medium carbonation.  Overall: This is a very good stout for the price. A little more boozy than expected, but nothing too serious.

Can't wait until I dip into the 2005 and see how that goes.  Overall, I found it to be a bit boozy (did I mention that already?), but liked it a bit better than last year's.

Looks like an imperial stout ought to look.  Dense and delicious, inviting nose. Aromas of creamy milk chocolate, cocoa powder, roasted malt, caramel, mixed berries, vanilla. Alcohol is present but not distracting. Perhaps a bit of evergreen hoppiness in the background.  Thick and rich and creamy on the palate. Flavors of mildly bitter dark chocolate, earthy roasted malt, warm alcohol, moderately hoppy, burnt grain, butter caramel. Packed and dense and tasty. Oily and mouthcoating and just barely drying. A bit of an herbal/medicinal note on the finish hints at more hops.  Has an English rather than American feel as imperial stouts go. Balanced and nuanced but flavor-packed. Surprisingly hoppy for the style, quite nice for a change. A fantastic beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,VaTechHopHead,4.36,"A - Very viscous when pouring. Straight up black with a huge dark brown foamy head that cascades when it forms. Excellent lacing.  S - Huge aromas of roasted malts complimented by chocolate malt. Not a lot of black/roasted malt smell. Mainly more sweet than anything else.  T - Black malt is the first flavor and then gets quickly interrupted by the chocolate malts. Lots of roasted flavors, a little burnt toast, with hints of dark espresso. Finishes with a huge malt sweetness and a slight alcohol burn. Transitions greatly through all phases of each sip.  M - Very heavy body with very little carbonation, and a creamy body. Finishes neutral from the creamy body and acidity from the grains. Definitely a sipper but nothing too complex to keep one wondering.

Dark chocolate brown with cola highlights. 2008-9 (2 yrs old): 4.5 - Better looking that the ‘9-10. Head is a darker khaki, and sits taller than before. The body is also darker; more black than brown. 2007-8 (3 yrs old): 4.5 – Even darker than the ‘8-9, with darker brown highlights. Dark khaki head has a fine bubble structure with ok retention and lace. 2006-7 (4 yrs old): 4.5 – Likely the darkest of the vertical. It’s at least as dark as the ‘7-8 above it with a similar head.  SMELL 2009-10 (1 yr old): 4.0 – Dark chocolate, raisin, molasses, and rum fruitcake. 2008-9 (2 yrs old): 3.5 – Rum soaked raisins. Less chocolate than the ‘9-10.

TASTE 2009-10 (1 yr old): 4.0 – Bitter chocolate up front with a backdrop of raisin. Great roast note in the middle with a touch of smoke. Warm booze on the backend blends into a dry cocoa finish. 2008-9 (2 yrs old): 4.0 – Opens smooth and slowly builds up a nice roast character. Warmer booze than the ‘9-10 and less chocolate, which I thought was odd. Has an almost an oaky dryness to it. A cocoa power finish lasts a lifetime. 2007-8 (3 yrs old): 4.5 – Nice complexity with softer and better-integrated flavors than the younger years. Roasty cocoa nibs blend into a semisweet dark chocolate. Nice malt roast through the center. The finish is roasty and semisweet. 2006-7 (4 yrs old): 4.5 – The best of the vertical. Caramel, walnut, and dark chocolate. Nice coffee center with a dry, dark cocoa backend. Light oak and semisweet finish.  MOUTHFEEL 2009-10 (1 yr old): 4.0 – Smooth with a medium/full body. Nice carbonation. 2008-9 (2 yrs old): 3.5 – More porter-like than a stout. Medium body is lighter than the ‘9-10. Nice carbonation is a touch brighter than the ‘9-10. 2007-8 (3 yrs old): 4.5 – Medium/full body with a solid smoothness. Lower carbonation than the ‘8-9. 2006-7 (4 yrs old): 4.5 – Medium/full body is super smooth. Has the lowest carbonation than the rest of the vertical, but still enough to be pleasant.  OVERALL 2009-10 (1 yr old): 4.0 – Delicious with a great roast character. 2008-9 (2 yrs old): 3.5 – Strangely boozier and lighter than the ‘9-10. 2007-8 (3 yrs old): 4.0 – More complex with better integration than the younger brews. 2006-7 (4 yrs old): 4.5 – Super smooth, well developed, and complex. Interestingly, the years culled some of the fruitiness of the previous years. Not surprisingly, the age also took the edge off of the booze.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,clareo,4.62,"Winter '08'-'09 bottling.  A - Pours a deep, dark velvety brown; a hint of ruby - with the barest trace of a tan head.  S - Primarily chocolate and booze. Distinct cocoa and a bit of coffee. Slight black licorice on the end.  T - Sweet chocolate and alcohol, progresses to a powdery cocoa and roasted coffee. Fades gradually into a pleasant finish and lingering warmth.  M - Thick, syrupy, smooth; coats the tongue pleasingly.  O - A very good stout; excellent for the winter season. I have had it fresh, and this aging has allowed for a much-needed mellowing of the strong alcoholic note.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jondeelee,4.53,"Smells of strong, dark sugars--deeply caramelized turbinado sugar and molasses, primarily--with a slightly yeasty, grainy scent.  On the tongue, there's a two-pronged attack between sugars and heavily roasted, bitter flavors, which seem to consider your tastebuds as ground zero for the most tasty carnage you'll ever encounter. Most of this is due to the ""six varieties of black, chocolate and roasted malts"" (as per the label) that have been blended in. On the sweet side of the malts, there are huge dark fruit flavors, deep caramels and toffees, molasses, and a touch of maple syrup. On the bitter side of the malts, there are equally huge chocolate malt flavors, bringing that almost-but-not-quite-burnt bitterness that's typical of a good stout. The hops are nice as well, though are kept on a backburner to allow the malts to take their presence at center stage.  The end result is a fabulous brew: a stout that offers a little bit of everything, and does it in a well-balanced, beautifully overpowering way. Yes, this stout is not for the faint-of-heart; but if you can handle it, you're in for a treat.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,auroracrisis,3.38,"Bottled into a snifter, Winter 09-10 bottling.  Pours infinitely black. I can't even see through the edges of the glass. One finger head that dissipates into a collar of foam.  The smell is licorice and toffee up front. A touch of cocoa beans and booze as well. Stale pumpernickel and a little caramel too. Seems to be a bit boozey for it's age though, the alcohol tingles your nose.  On the tongue we have muddled licorice, bakers chocolate, weak coffee, and booze. Caramel and a touch of peat or smoke as the beer warms. Alcohol too. Again, it seems a bit boozey for a beer that is almost 2 years old.  Thin for a stout. I'd say a light medium body, with moderate carbonation for the style. A little sticky, and some tingle from the alcohol.  Overall, this isn't the best Russian Imperial Stout. In fact, it's more of an American Double in my opinion. But, you get what you pay for. Okay chocolate and licorice flavor, and a nice amount of alcohol. It's not bad per say, but for my money I'd rather spend a dollar more and get a four pack of Founders Imperial Stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BeerNemesis,4.08,"Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout | on-tap | 10.0% ABV | July 2011  Brewer: Brooklyn Brewery Style: Russian Imperial Stout Glass: Snifter  Appearance: Jet black, the abyss. A mocha crown—perfectly motionless—rings the periphery.  Aroma: Iced coffee, dark chocolate.  Taste: Dark roasted coffee, espresso, brandy. There's a strong alcoholic presence and it leans towards bitterness, which is not for everyone.  Mouthfeel: Thick and luxurious, this is an incredibly pleasing liquid to swish around the your mouth.  Harmony: It's a great Russian Imperial Stout, except in that the 10% ABV can clumsily peek through the otherwise well-composed exterior.  Would I get it again?: Yes, and I have.

A - Dark black body that let's zero light through, mocha head that vanished quickly into some light edging.  S - Dark roasted malts, bittersweet bakers chocolate, caramelized figs, molasses, and some brown sugar. Not it's strong point.  T - Yup, this is an RIS. Smooth creamy mouthfeel with just enough carbonation. Flavor is initially bitter chocolate and roasted malts, but then it transforms into smooth espresso beans and some light vanilla. Delcious!  O - There's a reason why I bought a case of this stuff. Its an amazing brew at an amazing price. My favorite RIS in a small bottle format. Can't wait to see what some real age does to this.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

T- The taste is big and malty upfront with a bitter roasted cacao aftertaste. Very thick with a bit of carbonation. You get a little bit of heat from the alcohol, but it is very well hidden for a 10% ABV beer.  O- Overall this was an excellent beer that I was glad to finally taste. I can't wait to try another bottle in a few months to see how it ages. Definitely worth trying if you have the chance!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S: Bittersweet chocolate, dark roast, caramel, toffee, a hint of vanilla  T: At first, a big blast of caramel malt and milk chocolate, with the middle giving way to an almost dark fruit flavor, and the end finishing with a bitter, dry, cocoa and double espresso flavor. Amazing flavor.  O: This is an amazing RIS. After having brooklyn's barleywine, I was hesitant, but this is an amazing brew. The flavor is the best part, however, and I wish the nose was a bit more complex. Other than that, fantastic.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JDizzle,4.03,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle  Pours a deep black, with a medium tan head that goes bye-bye fast. Smells like dark roasted malts with a little chocolate and coffee. Carbonation is perfect for this style and the alcohol is present, but not too obvious for a 10% ABV stout. Mouthfeel is medium thick with a creamy goodness.  This is a steall for $8 a 4-pack.

45,680,beagle75,3.9,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter glass. Winter 10-11 vintage  A: Opaque black color with less than one finger of beige foam that quickly retreats, leaving a filmy and inconsistent residue on the surface. Scant lacing remains on the glass.  S: Refined grain is entirely roasted, with substantial earth and a thread of shoyu. Chocolate is not especially strong in intensity, but there is a definite suggestion of rustic, minimally-processed cacao liquor. Restrained dark fruit emerges as the beer warms, but coffee is left largely unrepresented in the nose. Volatile fusel alcohols add depth, rather than booziness.  T: Begins off-dry, with heavy, chocolate-infused roasted barley. Acidity peaks after a few beats, but the flavor of it stays under control and adds a bright citric layer of flavor. The middle features spirituous dark fruit and a transient whiff of old coffee grounds. Grain is re-established toward the finish, with a drier and huskier quality than at the start, while bitterness is fairly strong for the style, tasting earthy in a way that is not herbaceous but umami.  M: Medium viscosity, acidic early and slightly syrupy on the palate, with moderate carbonation.  D/O: This is a fine imperial stout, based on a chocolate-centric theme, that largely succeeds at what it set out to do. While it drinks easily for a 10% abv brew, it is held back by acidity issues that are typical for the style. For that reason it is better off accompanying a sensuous dessert, than it is in a solo role as a slow-sipper.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Rschis16,4.08,"Pitch black like oil out of the bottle. No light at all comes through. Dark khaki head on top that won't go away at all, and leaves beautiful silky lacing down the glass. The smell is of espresso, dark roasted malts that drip with caramel, and dark chocolate. Sweet and bitter smelling at the same time.  Tastes of espresso and the bitterness of unsweetened cooking chocolate dominate the flavor. Bitter like espresso in the back, but sweet and milky up front. Creamy, but not syrupy in the front, but crisp and zesty in the back. Definitely boozy, and at 10% it should be. But surprisingly, its not all that noticeable at first. Its masked by the delicious swirling of chocolate and espresso and dark-roasted malts to the point that it is only present in that zest at the back of the mouth. Surprisingly drinkable at 10%, this is a dangerous brew for any stout drinker and especially to those who found russian imperials to be their favorite. This is certainly a very good beer and I'm impressed. Between this and Old Rasputin, I may turn into a regular russian imperial stout drinker.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,calcio360jrd,4,"Last beer of the day during huge July 4th party.  Pours out a nice blackness with more carbonation than i expected. Great smell of chocolate malt, maybe some toffee and even a bit of licorice. Taste was a bit lighter than expected, also a bit thinner than expected, but a very tasty RIS in my opinion. Head dissipated quickly but left a pretty good lacing on the walls of the glass. Glad i had this at the end of the nite watching fireworks instead of at 3pm when the party started, the 10% caught up to me at the end!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,seabass87,3.75,"Served from 12 FL OZ. bottle into glass. Winter 10-11 vintage.  A- Solid black. Small brown head that disappears quickly.  S- Bittersweet chocolate, roasted espresso, and sour cherries. A bit of vanilla, a bit of alcohol.  T- Follows the nose. Chocolate and espresso first, with some cherries in the back. A lingering espresso aftertaste to help cover the strong alcohol. A fair amount of warmth.  M- This beer has a medium-thick mouthfeel, and is able to do its job without sticking on your tongue too much. Zero carbonation. The structure of the beer is very good.  O- For a chocolate stout, this beer ventures into the high ABV (10%) side of the spectrum. It's a bit more complex that some of it's contemporaries, but the alcohol is a bit obvious. Above average for the style.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jcurtis55,4.58,Wow. This is an excellent stout. I got 2-3 fingers of foam and after every drink the heavy lacing seems to last forever. Initial smell is of dark fruit and dark chocolate.  The flavor is pretty much the same. There is not a hint of alcohol in the taste.

A: Pours black with two fingers of oily dark brown head that slowly faded into a thick film that left a network of fine lacing down the glass. S: Big sweet chocolatey notes of fudge, cocoa, hot chocolate, milk chocolate and... more chocolate. This smells great! T: Rich creamy chocolate notes of chocolate ice-cream covered with fudge. There is a splash of coffee near the finish as well, and the aftertaste is lightly bitter and acidic. I also get a hint of cinnamon in there. M: Low, soft carbonation over a medium-thick body with a velvety and creamy mouthfeel. This beer is very easy to drink and very smooth. O: If you love chocolate you’ll love this one. It’s got every flavor of chocolate except white. Really solid all around.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Eriktheipaman,4.3,Poured a solid black with brown head that mostly fades but hangs on the edges.  The smell isn't what I expected. The smell is pretty hoppy. It smells like those chocolate oranges.  The taste is also on the hoppier side on the front. The back comes in with an amazing mouth feel of roasted chocolate and a little coffee.  It was'nt as chocolaty as I'd expected but that's not a bad thing at all. A damn fine beer.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ChrisCage,4.69,"A- When I poured this out of the bottle, I immediately said that I've never seen such a thick beer before....it barely swirls in the glass! The head is actually minimal, caramel colored and very dense (the film over the brew, that is). The lacing is decent, with lots of zig zaging lines of foam staying on the glass....reminds me of snow caps on mountains. The brew itself is motor oil black and I see a couple of C02 columns on the side of the glass.  S- Wow, this reminds me of the first time I smelled a Malmsey Madeira! This is a very deep smelling beer, with lots of damp soil, raw unsweetened cocoa, plums, and a raisined malt sweetness and toasted chestnuts. The finish is a combination of astingent blackstrap molasses and a sweeter but not overdone English toffee. So much going on here, it's amazing!  T- While this has some of the same flavors as aromas, the dark chocolate really shines through! It comes across equivalent to having a square of 70% cocoa from Lindt...just great! There is underlying hints of coffee bean, fresh vanilla bean, and cappuccino. The finish is slightly alcoholic but more of roasted malt and burnt toast....the aftertaste shows more of the hop bitterness as it lingers.  M- Full bodied to a tee, and the carbonation is very fine....this is a heavenly smooth beer...just like butter! This reminds me so much of a devil's food cake or a nut filled brownie, it's just that good!  O- I'll definitely be acquiring this awesome beer again! Full of wonderful complexity, both aroma and taste wise! The alcohol is generally well hidden, except for a bit on the end, and in my opinion, this is right up there with the best of the best stouts of the world! It's so rich that it might be best to enjoy this, one bottle at a time during a sitting, but just a real enjoyment....well done!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Knapp85,4.25,This beer poured out as a beautiful black color with a brown head. The head left a pretty good lacing down the glass after each sip. The smell of the see had a nice hoppy chocolate aroma to it. The taste is rich with dark chocolate and bitter burnt toast. The aftertaste had a hoppy bitterness too adding to the flavor. The mouthfeel of this beer had a pretty good thickness and the feel was pretty oily. Overall this beer was pretty freaking good.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DaveBlack,4,"Winter 10-11 batch. A friend recommended this one to me, and if there's one thing I love it's a good stout.  A: nice pour, solid opaque black with a small cascade of bubbles leading up to a half finger of tan head. The head doesn't last that long and it leaves behind some slight lacing.  S: Big aroma on this. Coffee, chocolate and deeply roasted malts. Smells like a stout should.  T: Chocolate malts, deep roasty flavor, espresso. Big surprise is the alcohol, which comes through far too much in my opinion. I don't know that I've had a 10% ABV stout before but it doesn't hide it as much as a would have hoped and seems a bit incongruous. I can see how that might be a nice warming touch on a winter night, though.  M: Surprisingly medium bodied for how it looks, light on the carbonation.  O: A really good stout. Obviously if you're drinking stouts you don't plan on having too many, but the 10% makes sure of that. Certainly hits on all the high notes with the coffee, chocolate and heavily roasted malts. Nice balance and easy to drink.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DavidST,4.45,"This is a winter 10-11 vintage.  The appearance is beautiful, I love the look of a chocolate stout, deep black with a brown foamy head with great retention. I love it.  The smell is wonderful, full of dark roasted malts and dark chocolate, reminds me of desert.  The mouthfeel is different than expected, lighter than other stouts I've had, medium thickness. There is a little burn and some carbonation.  The taste is good the dark chocolate is the main taste present which is bitter and good. For a high ABV the alcohol is very well masked. (I'm actually surprised to read another reviewer that no chocolate is used in making this).  Overall this is a great beer to have after eating, I'm going to save a few and see how they taste in a few months or a year but I'm glad I made this purchase.

The aroma is of smooth rich chocolate malts, with some faint dark fruits.  The taste is of chocolate and faintly roasted coffee malts finished with faint dark fruit notes.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with light, yet appropriate carbonation.  This is an extremely well done beer, and is even more impressive in that no actual chocolate is used to brew it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Eramen,4.28,"A - Pours an opaque black or perhaps a dark ebony with a one finger head. When I put it up to strong light it remains an impenetrable dark, brown-black colour.  S - I personally find that it smells much like a fresh chocolate milkshake and coffee with malts and hop interspersed. A very pleasurable smell.  T - Same as the smell yet with much deeper and assorted flavors - roasted malts and coffee, rich dark chocolate, sugar & milk, cappuccino.  M - Very creamy and milky and chewy, and not heavy in the least, this combined with the fantastic flavors gives one much to savor. This is perfection.

Flavor is nice as well, with bitter cocoa and coffee dominating. Roasted malt and caramel as well with a bitter aftertaste but still leaves you wanting more. The mouth feel is a bit light for a 10% chocolate stout, but the heavy carbonation probably adds to this.

45,680,rickyleepotts,4,"I have had this beer before, and while it doesn’t really taste like chocolate I still love this brew. Not only does it have a HUGE ABV, but I like pretty much everything they make at Brooklyn. Even though this particular beer isn’t made at the actual brewery, it still has their name on it. Plus, I like stouts!  The beer is extremely black, and has a sweet and tempting nose. It smells like what a Guinness looks like it should smell like. (I hate Guinness, just so you know.) It makes me want to be outdoors, or staring out over the mountain tops in a cabin out west. Smell it… tell me you don’t smell that cabin!  The taste is incredible. Starts off smooth, then gets a touch carbonated on the back of the palate. Then… wait for it… it explodes across the back of your mouth leaving you with a dry aftertaste. But the aftertaste is great. It has a certain dark fruit note to it… almost like I just ate a pile of burnt cranberries. But that’s okay… the aftertaste is what brings me back for another sip.  You would never know this beer had 10% ABV. It doesn’t taste that way at all. You don’t smell, or taste the alcohol. Back to the aftertaste; it never leaves. It just sits there. Apparently the folks at Brooklyn want this beer to be drinkable, not one you would sip. They have succeeded at that. Also hear that the longer you leave this in the bottle, the better it tastes and the more chocolate flavor will come out of the beer. It’s a great beer, that’s for sure. A true stout, and one that I wish more breweries would model their stouts after. Well done Brooklyn!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Tford,3.39,"A: It pours a deep black with a small, light brown coloured head  S: There isn’t a whole lot of odorants here, it mostly smells of alcohol.  T: The initial taste is a light chocolate, then the alcohol takes over. The aftertaste is a slightly bitter chocolate coffee flavour. Surprisingly, I can taste more coffee than chocolate  M: I was expecting this to have a heavy body, but it is rather light. There is a health amount of carbonation as well.  O: There is nothing horribly wrong with this beer, but there is nothing excellent about it either. I think it needs more chocolate to balance the high abv.

Clear, soapy looking bubbles surround the body of the beer.  Smells of sweet chocolate malts and fudge with a hint of dark coffee roast. Sticky sweet aroma that's reminiscent of chocolate icing. The alcohol comes through at the back end.  Smooth creamy chocolate, loads of sweet fudge and bittersweet dark cocoa. Some coffee bitterness also shows through. It tastes like a dark chocolate fudge brownie. The hops are dormant. Amazing bittersweet balance.  Soft and creamy mouthfeel with excellent viscosity. Thick and chewy as a 10% abv chocolate stout should be. Excellent drinkability for a beer of this magnitude. The alcohol is well hidden and feels like a non factor.  Overall this is a superb chocolate stout. It's comparable to the best chocolate velvet cake you can get in liquid form. The mouthfeel is right up there with the best of them as well.

45,680,BlackHaddock,3.6,"335ml brown bottle poured into a Westvleteren chalice. Almost jet black body, only when held to a powerful light source can any reddy hue be found. The deeply dark tanned head soon fell away to just a collar, which is always a shame in my eyes: I love the head to stay on the beer, no matter which style you are talking about. This beer (according to the neck label) is a limited bottling-winter 09-10: best before oct 2012, reviewed June 2011.  The chocolate in the taste didn't show it's self a great deal in the smell, being hidden by by other malty aromas. Chocolate rules the flavours, the alcohol is also very evident within the mouthfeel and taste, but the chocolate dominates overall.  Rich and warming, the alcohol content doesn't add a great deal for me, it is just a bit to prominent for my tastes.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,azdback,4.02,"Poured into my Stone Imperial glass. This is dark in color but I think I'm gonna call it dark dark brown not black. There is a slow rise of carbonation bubbles that surrender a beautiful dark brown, soft, creamy head of about two fingers. Lace is nice and sticky and leaves a spotted ring pattern that is very respectable.  Smell is wonderful!! The choice of malts has given this quite a fantastic nose. I have to say that coffee wins in the front. There is definitely some sweet coco there as well. I also get just a touch of char and vanilla. Alcohol is present as well. Smell reminds me a bit of Abyss.  Taste is boozy!! The 10% is pretty much in your face from the get go. The other flavors get there as well but have to wait for the Ethanol to dissipate. Cherry tartness is huge on the palate. This is very sweet as well, but I have yet to really get any chocolate or coffee I got from the nose. As this warms the alcohol mellows a bit and lets the chocolate and coffee flavors come out some, but they still struggle to get recognized.  The mouth is sticky and a bit dry from the cherry tartness. I also think this one is a bit thin for the style. About two thirds of the way down the throat it gets a bit watery.  Overall I think this is a fantastic beer, but when it comes to beers in the style I must compare this to, it falls a bit short. Too bad the brewers at Stone an Deschutes nailed the style so well the rest just have to keep trying. A definite thumbs up though and a must try if you can!!!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Quite alcoholic tasting. While the body is fairly rich, it is more of a boozy than beery taste.  For an Imperial Stout this seems like a less than noble attempt. Might be just the thing, though, with some good cheese and pretzels.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Keffa,3.96,"Live review.  12oz bottle poured into my Columbus Microbrew Festival pint glass.  A: Pours pitch black, 2 finger deep tan head, settles into a full, yet thin, cap, leaves lacing everywhere and desperately tries to hold on, which it eventually loses. Held to light, it's letting zero light through. Wonderful looking stout.  S: Roast, chocolate, nuts, and wooden, earthy hop off the bat. Not a particularly strong aroma, but good nonetheless. Some alcohol is noticeable, but restrained.  T: Deep roasted malt, nuts, chocolate, and ash/char are strong front runners, followed by a little bit of an alcohol heat and more roast. Some hoppiness toward the finish, wood comes to mind. Finishes pretty dry and quick, but the roast lingers on past the finish. Alcohol warms more in the aftertaste.  M: Fairly thin for such a huge stout, lightly coating of the palate and not nearly as substantial as some of the other 10% stouts I've had.  O: Nice stout here, alcohol heat kinda detracts a little bit from this one for me. That said, though, pretty easy to drink, easy to find, cheap. What more could you want from a 10% Stout?",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ngeunit1,4.35,"A - Pours a deep dark black color with a big finger of frothy tan-brown head atop. The head fades slowly down to a thin leaving behind lots of lacing.  S - Aroma is full of deep roasted malts and lots of dark chocolate. There is a bit of booze and a touch of vanilla and coffee.  T - Starts off with a ton of deep roasted malts and lots of dark chocolate flavors. Right from the start there is also just a touch of booze, but not in a bad way. Through the middle, some vanilla, a touch of coffee, and some other earthy flavors come through. The finish is a mix of lots of chocolate and roasted flavors and a bit of booze that lingers nicely.  M - Full bodied with moderate carbonation. The beer feels really smooth and even a touch creamy. The finish has lots of roasted and sweet flavors that linger with some background warming from the alcohol.  D - Very drinkable. The flavors are super rich and complex and feel nicely balanced. The chocolate flavor in particular is very strong and rich. The alcohol is present, but not in an unpleasant way.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,plfahey,4.53,"2007 Vintage. Pint on tap at the Happy Gnome, St. Paul, MN.  Appearance-Inky black darkness and totally opaque. Tall light brown head is dense and fluffy with good retention. Good lacing.  Aroma-Dark Cocoa powder and fudge brownies, with some fruity, plumlike esters. Slight hint of alcohol and vinous character. No hops.  Flavor-Sweet chocolate fudge up front is slowly overtaken, first by dark fruit esters, followed by drier bittersweet chocolate and light espresso flavors. Finishes semi-sweet, with faint hop flavors making an appearance. Aftertaste is fudgy, with a chocolate liqueur character. The chocolate seems to expand on the palate forever.  Mouthfeel-Thick and full, almost chewy, and yet velvety smooth on the palate. Moderate carbonation, with some nice alcohol warmth in the finish-the only real hint of the high alcohol content.  Overall-This beer is fantastic, and wears its age well. No hops remain (except for a hint in the flavor), but the malt and alcohol are very smooth and uber-chocolatey.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,lisomiso,4.3,"Thank you Walows (who pulled this out of his cellar after our Porter tasting). I love you!! What a treat.  This is one seriously delicious beer. Jet black and gorgeous with a complex malt profile of coffee and roasted marshmallow. Silky and rich on the palate and the finish is pure espresso. If I dared to quibble, the nose was a bit hot as the beer warmed, but really, the whole experience was a delight.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jrenihan,4.2,"Bottle from the Winter 2010-2011 edition.  Pours jet black (surprise surprise!) with two finger widths of frothy tan head, that retains quite well.  Smell is full of dark chocolate- again not much of a surprise. Coffee is also detectable, as is roasted malt, alcohol and a touch of sweetness.  Chocolate is again upfront in the taste, coffee much fainter. Alcohol is noticeable- a bit too much, but not bad. I can taste dark fruit, such as plum, very faintly, mixed in with the booze. Almost reminiscent of an alcohol-flavoured chocolate, with a bit of fruit filling. Dark chocolate aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is very good. Smooth and silky feeling, but with a fairly robust body. Carbonation is fairly low.  Overall, very nice. I imagine that this would be better with some more age on it, to allow the alcohol to mellow out further. However, it is very good as is as well. I look forward to letting the other sit for awhile.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Auracom,3.97,"One of my targets while in New York. Opened a 12 oz. bottle on March 23rd, 2011 into an over-sized wine glass.  BCS is a pitch black coloring. Swirls around with semi-thickness. Light brown, thin head with so-so lacing and very little retention. It's a standard appearance.  Aroma exhibits dark/semi-dark chocolate, vanilla bean, and coffee notes. Pretty apparent hint of booze. Taste is similar - more of a primary dark chocolate character that is slightly sweet but mainly bitter. A little roasted quality is also combined with more coffee flavoring.  Finished long from the dark chocolate bitterness with semi-dryness. Carbonation is great. Medium-thickness in the brew's body.  Not sure about drinkability. Abv in the nose but not so much in taste. Strong bitterness across the middle and late portions of the drink make it a bit harder to get through than it'd have otherwise been. It reminds me of a more refined and complex version of Rasputin in terms of availability. If I lived on the east coast this would be a frequent visitor in my fridge.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JayQue,3.95,Good RIS. The balance of Chocolate to roasted malts is very good (a lot of chocolate stouts are too over-the-top). The alcohol presence/taste leaves something to be desired.  Pours a dense black color...no light getting through. Medium size dark tan head with good retention for this level abv. Moderate lacing.  Good strong pleasant aroma. Milk chocolate and roasted malts.  Taste is similar. The chocolate is very well blended into the overall stout flavor/malts. Just the right level of chocolate to enhance the roasted malt flavor. There is a steady/moderate alcohol presence that makes this beer less than it could have been. I suppose aging would reduce the alcohol presence and make this a really awesome stout.  Mouthfeel is rich and smooth. The alcohol presence is the only negative here.  Overall still a very good stout. WOuld probably be better with a year or two aging.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Pours near completely black with a 3 plus finger brown head, that leaves behind tons of lace and settles slowly into a thin layer of bubbles.  Smell is cocoa nibs, grainy biscuit, hints of vanilla, expresso, and some warming alcohol.  Taste follows big chocolate, vanilla, and strong coffee upfront with some grains and slight booze in the balanced finish.  Mouthfeel is a little bigger than medium, a little creamy with plenty of life, maybe a whisker dry, and even with the slight boozyness it drinks rather easy for its heft.  Overall this is very nice, I finally went back and reviewed this again. My review from 2011 wasn't very good and I have learned plenty over the last 5 years, that it deserved better.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Some nice lacing, too.  S- Dark, bittersweet chocolate. Almost none of the 10% abv comes through. A little oakiness to it as well with brings some vanilla aromas.  T- Just like the smell with a little more of the abv present in the finish. A wonderful flavor of chocolate with a hint of that oaky- vanilla flavor. Nice burnt coffee flavors as well.

Pours a pitch black with a roasted almond colored head that leaves a great coat of lace behind with each drink. Smells of sweet chocolate, a small hop profile, and roasted toffee. Beer has a great smell to it. I taste an overwhelming amount of chocolate, very good amount of toffee, a slight taste of bitterness from the hops, and a slight touch of alcohol. Beer is very thick and very well carbonated. This beer is a great representation of the style.

45,680,ExtraStout,4,"This beer is possibly the best ""bottled"" beer from Brooklyn - I think we all know that the non-contract draft beer coming out of the brewery is much better! This beer pours a very dark brown/black with ruby highlights. There's a nice, light tan/brown head around the rim of the glass, although no Belgian-lace is produced. The aroma is of a bittersweet chocolate and candyish malt, but without hops, which is OK for the style.  The flavor starts with alot of chocolate and roastiness followed by a clear alcohol, a bit of hop flavor, and eventually mellowing into very nice coffee notes. The finish stays on the pallet a bit and is somewhat sharp. The carbonation level is appropriate and the body is nice. There are no off-notes to speak of. Overall, a nice example of the style.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DrewV,4.05,"Poured from a bottle (Winter 10-11 date) out of the beer fridge at 45 degrees into a Spiegelau Stemmed Pilsner (tulip).  A: Pours a dark chocolate color into the glass and forms a solid 1-finger tan-colored head which dissipates quickly. Lacing is adequate, but less than other RIS examples I have drank.  S: Smell is restrained, but a definite nose of hops and cocoa can be detected. Sweet, roasty malts provide some backbone. Alcohol seems well hidden. Much sweetness leads the way.  T: Heavy, over-the-top roasted malt hits the taste buds first and lingers. A very thick body carries the flavors. Once again, the alcohol is very well hidden. As the beer warms, the coffee flavors become more pronounced, as does the chocolate (and the alcohol). Later, the aftertaste kicks in with a hint of hoppy bitterness after the ""roast"" disappears.  M: Low carbonation suits the beer well without leaving it completely flat. Slightly oily character throughout the body and into the finish. Extremely creamy brew. Very much like a ""spiked"" chocolate malted milkshake.  O: A very hearty brew, almost too hearty. Chewy, but with extreme flavor and depth. A surprise, considering the high ABV, which eventually shows its strength in the second half of the glass with some noticeable burn and warmth. Not quite my favorite RIS, but definitely a nice option every once in a while. [EDIT: This is quickly becoming my favorite RIS due to its creamy maltiness.]  NOTE: The first bottle out of this 4-pack was ridiculously hot with nothing but alcohol aroma and flavor. So I tried another bottle and was shocked at the difference. I have no idea why the two bottles were so different. Maybe the next two will answer that question. [EDIT: The third bottle was very creamy and not at all hot. Very creamy, smooth, roasty brew here.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Leaving behind a slight lace, but not much.  S: What an aroma! Bitter, dark chocolate. Vanilla, molasses and light espresso coffee beans.  T: Semi-sweet bakers chocolate with big toasty malt backbone. Slight vanilla and chocolate chips present as well. Very light burn on the backend which ties this all together.  M: Thick and oily mouthfeel. Heavy body with little carbonation. Leaves a nice bitter chocolate finish on the tounge.  O: What a great RIS. The complexities of the chocolate, the big roasted malts and the slight heat tie together to make a very balanced drink.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mdvatab,3.95,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a Bordeaux glass. Bottled in Winter '10/'11  Aroma: Deep, dark chocolate, molasses from dark roasted malt, and sweet dark dried fig. A hint of bourbon-like booze appears from the middle through the finish.  Appearance: Pitch black espresso, dark tan two-fingered head settles to a thin, spotty layer of foam. Very light lacing.  Flavor: Rich molasses sweetness up front. Hershey's Special Dark-like chocolate flavor and bitterness. Fruitiness is reminiscent of fortified wine, and is followed by a light smoky finish.  Mouthfeel: Slightly thinner body than I'd desired, but not bad. Spicy heat from the alcohol warm the inside of the mouth and throat. Alcohol is prominent, but definitely not overwhelming.  Overall: A very solid showing by Brooklyn. I have to admit, I didn't read the small label on the neck of the bottle, and was hoping for the use of actual chocolate in this beer. The chocolate flavor, as the label says, however, comes strictly from the malt. At the end of the day, this beer is an artfully brewed, complex imperial stout, and I'm probably going to try to get my hands on another bottle and cellar it for a couple of years.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S- Getting a pretty even mixture of dark fruits and chocolate. Prunes and figs come to mind. Definitely picking up on that 10% ABV with some sweet alcohol notes. The coffee and dark chocolate notes are definitely there but take a back seat.  T- So much going on here. From the get go there's a powerful fusion of coffee, dark chocolate, dark fruits and alcohol. The coffee is almost charred and works perfectly with the dark chocolate. The alcohol produces some serious warmth. The finish drags on for ages with loads of bitter chocolate and roasted coffee.

M: Medium body with med carbonation  Overall: There is no chocolate in this beer except chocolate malt I think this beer is a bit misleading. Not too much chocolate taste to the beer either.

45,680,tewaris,4.06,"12 oz. bottle (2010-11 vintage) poured into a snifter. Thanks Dan!  First off, this is not a chocolate stout, but uses specially roasted malts to achieve chocolate notes, and I will rate it as a regular RIS. Moving on, BBCS pours dark and clear with a big espresso brown head that formed in cascades and stuck around for quite a while. The lacing was very good too. However, it didn't seem as dark and viscous as the beers it would be compared to.  The aroma reminds of Bell's Expedition more than any other stout because of its tartness. Roast is present too, and some soft alcohol --- a typical RIS aroma but at pleasantly high levels. Dark sugars and some charring are evident and welcome.  The taste can stand up against any other stout not brewed with actual coffee/chocolate additions, or barrel aging. Bittersweet, with a strong bias towards bitter, BBCS is like dark chocolate minus the flavors. Well, there's a strong resemblance in the aftertaste so the last sentence should be taken as a negligent comment. Starts displaying a molasses character with warmth, and is tart to begin with. Smoothly warming, with a long and bitter finish with medium roast character.  The mouthfeel is way silkier and richer than what I expected based on the relatively thin color. Carbonation level couldn't have been better either. Overall, I am very glad to drink this beer finally --- especially when I haven't had a RIS in days. This beer reminds me why I like the style in the first place. Highly recommended.

45,680,russwbeck,4.35,"A: Black pour with a big, creamy, light milky brown head. Lacing is wonderful and the retention is pretty good as well. 4  S: Lots of chocolate on the smell, hops and roasted malts display themselves as well. Perhaps a hint of booziness. 4  T: Starts off with the chocolate. Creamy, bitter, roasty chocolate. Next up is a faint hoppiness, followed by a dry coffee finish. The flavor is a tad sweet, but very well balanced. The flavors seem to evolve on the palate as you drink. 4.5  MF: Full and creamy body. Hardly any alcohol noticed and a very dry finish. 4.5  O: Very good representation of the style. It isn't a beer that tries to be anything more than a full RIS and it works. 4.5  Winter 10/11 bottling. Review will represent the numbers above, as that beer was enjoyed fresh.  A: The beer pours out semi-see-through black in color with a thin, brown head. The head never builds to anything more than a finger or so, and dissipates quickly, leaving only minimal lacing behind. 3.5  S: The aroma is full of booze and dark fruits. The fruits surprise and sort of concern me, as I don't remember this being a fruity beer fresh. Some roast remains, but the big hit of chocolate I remember seems to have been lost to the years. 3.5  T: The chocolate is not lost on the taste luckily. The dark fruits actually add to the complexity of the beer, dominating the taste after the dark chocolate has gone. The finish is roasty, with the lingering fruits, and boozy. The taste is interesting, but I can't say it has improved with age. 4  MF: A bit on the thin side with a noticeable reduction in carbonation. It still remains rather drinkable for how high the ABV is. 3.5  O: This wasn't all that great and I doubt I'll age more than the 3 or 4 I have left from this batch.

It still has a distinct bitter/sharpness to balance it out.  Black as night with some deep brown coffee colored highlights. The head is deep brown - burnt umber - very good retention.  Smells of rum, raisin, coffee, chocolate - yet everything seems to meld together into a sweet, strong perfume smell. Very nice.  Up front is heavy, woody grape wine like character followed by rum and raisin. Next is very nice coffee flavor; it finishes with round full chocolate coating.

Tastes of roasted malts and bittersweet dark chocolate. Acidic coffee flavor comes through at the end and in the after taste. This is well balanced.  Mouthfeel is very nice. A good tingling bite on the front and a moderate weight makes this easy to drink. Resin coats the mouth with a bitter acidic taste that makes you want to drink more.  Overall this is a really good stout.

S: Chocolate malt and alcohol esters, followed by a whiff of coffee and bitterness. There is a whisky-like quality to the nose, from the alcohol to the richness and sweetness, that I like.  T: Rich and drinkable. You can taste a little alcohol but there really isn't any heat. The sweetness comes through as milk chocolate, and the finish is bitter-sweet like a dark chocolate bar. There is some hop presence as well and it all meshes pretty nicely.  MF: Creamy and silky smooth, viscous and coating. Medium to full bodied.  O: Very good, glad I have another to age now.

45,680,BamaViper1,4.13,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. 2010 version.  The Black Chocolate Stout pours motor oil black into the glass. Astoundingly for a beer that pours this dark, the Head formed from this pour was substantial, about an inch thick and colored mocha brown. This head dissipates but forms thick lacing on the inside of the glass.  This beer has aromas of roasted malt and milk chocolate. There are hints of espresso and dried fruit. Also upon swirling a more bitter chocolate can be discerned.  Roasted malt invades the tastebuds as this beer is ingested. The dominating flavor, however, is a bittersweet chocolate. The finish is coated in bitter chocolate with the mildest hint of raspberry. There is the presence of alcohol taste, but it is not overwhelming.  This Brooklyn brew is more carbonated than I was anticipating, but is actually nice for a beer with this much body. The finish coats the tongue allowing the flavors to linger on for eternity.  I really like this beer. I feel that maybe with a full year or two of age, this beer will be even better. Kudos to Brooklyn Brewery.

Nose has roasted smoky peat notes, campfire, almost a acetic quality and some buried burnt coffee. No real sign of chocolate here. No real smoke on the taste, it does have some nice bittersweet chocolate, roasted and a very dry finish along with a high level of carbonation. I was waffling between trying something new or a breakfast stout, i wish i went with the latter.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,UCLABrewN84,4.23,"Thanks to mjtiernan and SalukiAlum for each sending me a bottle of this!  Pours a pitch black with a huge 3 inch dark chocolate colored head that fades to a small cap. Very nice distinct rings of lace around the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark roasted malts, cocoa powder, and dark fruits. Taste is of dark bittersweet chocolate, plums/prunes, roasty coffee, and slight soy sauce. There is a pleasant coffee/dark chocolate bitterness after each sip. There is also a slight acidity in the beer. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Overall, this is a very good RIS. I am glad I got a chance to try this one and that I have another bottle to drink later.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,quine,4.3,"A: Pours a rich, dark brown, bordering on black. Head is tan and a nice size. Nice lacing as well.  S: A big roasty chocolate aroma comes through. A bit of alcohol is present as well, but not unpleasantly so.  T: Like the smell, lots of roasted malts and chocolate are in the taste. Sweet dark fruits are also there. Also, some bitterness and a little bit of alcohol, which blend well with the flavors.  M: Creamy, thick and smooth, with a surprising amount of carbonation. Nice.  D: Scarily drinkable for 10% ABV. Can barely taste the alcohol, and it blends well with the flavors. The taste is well balanced as well, not too sweet (as some chocolate stouts tend to be) and not too bitter.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ONUMello,3.98,"12oz bottle poured into pint glass  A: Slow to form 1/4"" head. Jet opaque black in the glass.  S: Rich chocolaty cream, a little coffee with some subtle hop characteristics.  T: Cocoa, coffee, just a hint of bitterness to balance the malt.  M: Thick, rich, and a bit of alcohol towards the end.  O: Good example of the style. Nothing stands out, but I still found it enjoyable to sip.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,EnemyWithin,4.25,"2008-2009 vintage into Duvel glass.  Appearance: 4.5 Opaque, dark drown-black body with dense, foamy brown 1 inch head. Nice lacing. As I drink a faint, incomplete of head remains on surface.  Smell: 4.5 Strong aroma of cocoa with notable presence of dark fruit and molasses malt. Addictive to smell.  Taste: 4 Initially, sweet chocolate malt that is overtaken by the more fruit, warming alcohol midway through with some mild bitterness. Great roasty finish with slight stickiness. Alcohol is notable, but not too over-powering. Good sipper beer.  Mouthfeel: 4 Moderate thickness with good coating of mouth. Carbonation is mild to moderate. Feels appropriate for such a stout.  Overall: 4.5 A very nice stout, especially to sipper during cold winter night. Quite drinkable. I enjoy the chocolate aspect and feels it softens the alcohol presence nicely. Overall, the alcohol is detectable, but not too overpowering. Enjoyable, but not a beer I have multiple in a sitting in most cases.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,HotHands,4.3,"A - arrived as a jet black color with a frothy tan head.  S - chocolate and a bit of coffee and brown sugar.  T - As the name would imply, chocolate is the main attraction here. A healthy amount of bitter, roasty dark chocolate flavor with some coffee and brown sugar. In my opinion, the light sweetness is well-balanced by the roast and the hops. I wouldn't ask for more sweetness or for less. This stout is well-balanced overall with no real rough edges. A bit of booziness at the end if you sip it too fast, but this is to be expected from an imperial stout on tap.  M - nice body without being too heavy. I would be interested in trying a nitro version of this stout if such a thing actually existed.  Overall - this is a great, well-balanced stout. I can't say I'm too keen on the traditional flavor-hammer imperial stouts, so if you're a huge stout fan maybe you shouldn't take my review at face value. But I really like how Brooklyn BCS balances the chocolate flavor with everything else going on. Enjoy.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Shrews629,4.47,"Appearance - Very dark brown/black color with some very faint ruby highlights around the edges. A nice dark tan head that was smooth and creamy. However the head was not very large nor did it have a tremendously long retetnion time. Left some decent lacing though.  Smell - A sweet and burnt chocolate note seems to be the driving force of the aroma. Some additional burnt malt is in there also. A touch of coffee. A touch of dark fruits. Some burnt bread. No over abundance of alcohol in the smell either. Nicely balanced. Smells great.  Taste - The taste brings out more of the robust, sweet chocolate, burnt coffee and dark fruit. A minor flavoring of alcohol is present as well. Very, very well balanced. A little bit of milk flavoring also.  Mouthfeel - Medium/full mouthfeel. Very dry and smooth and creamy. Slick feeling. The warming alcohol holds off until the last second then comes slowly and finishes strong. Covers the palate exceptionally well.  Drinkability - What a wonderful brew. A great smell, mouthfeel and of course an outstanding taste. This beer is very easy to drink and even more so during the Winter months. Watch out however, 10% ABV is quite a bit. I'm picking this up again next year for sure... and yes you should too.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,HosP,3.75,"Poured 12oz into Tremens snifter.  A- Pours dark black, with no light coming in or out. Very nice khaki head. Creamy and holds very well.  S- Nice bittersweet aroma from this. Roasted malts overcome the bitter chocolate notes in nose.  T- Up front the roasted malts mix with subtle sweet chocolate flavors. Bitterness starts to overtake in the middle through the end. Chocolate settles off pretty quick too, still very smooth drink.  M- Full body. Low carbonation, almost none. Creamy mouth feel.  O- Good beer here. Nothing really jumps out at me though. Chocolate flavors weren't as present as I was hoping for. Solid, but nothing overwhelmingly special.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TheHoppiest,4.18,"Had on tap at the Winking Lizard in Independence. Poured into a tulip glass and was, as usual for the WL, too cold. After warming the glass in my hands for a few minutes, I swirled and got down the business of reviewing.  Pours a dark brown/black, with a 1/4"" tan head that is sloooow to reduce.  Smells of burnt brown sugar, dark chocolate and coffee, with hints of bitter flitting in and around these aromas. Tough to say if it is a dark chocolate bitter, or a coffee bitter.  Has a bitter-sweet start, with decent black coffee bitter and a decent amount of alcohol. Sweetens as you drink more, and remains smooth throughout.  Very full-bodied, and becoming more so as it warms. The alcohol also begins to mellow as it warms.  Easy drinking and smooth, I think this is one of Brooklyn's finest offerings. I would definitely have this again and recommend it if you're looking to enjoy a good stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jsdunlop,4,"A: Pitch black, motor oil consistency, very faint whispy head forms, then recedes. S: Raisin, plum, alcohol, bakers chocolate, toffee and caramel T: Strong raisin flavor up front, alcohol seems to be shining through fairly well. A slight astringency mingles with a touch of roasted malt and chalky bakers chocolate. Caramel sweetness is wrapped up in a moderately bitter finish, followed by a boozy warmth as the sip is finished. M: Smooth, slightly viscous, with moderate carbonation O: A solid beer, fairly sweet, seemed lacking on the chocolate forward characteristics that I was hoping for in this after-dinner brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Brunite,4,"A: Pours a dark black with a light brown foam.  S: Roasted notes. Lots of chocolate. Some coffee...some cherry noted.  T: Bitter roasted flavors up front. As it warms the chocolate becomes much more noted. A bittersweet chocolate taste predominates. A bit more sweet than would be optimal. The alcohol peeks through once in a while. A lingering bitter chocolate flavor coats the mouth.  M: Medium-thick on the mouth....A few swirls creates a creamy head. Rich & thick.  O: Drinkability is good. I considered this one over again and liked it more the second time. Initially....the sweetness is just shy of cloying but stays within reason. Later...you get the balance here and the flavors work together like a liquid chocolate cake. I raised my points and will try this again, in comparison to my standards of Old Raspy & Storm King.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The nose is made up of roasted malts, espresso, toffee, and chocolate. Not overpowering but very pleasant. Taste is amazing. No alcohol is on the palate with plenty of dark chocolate and a bitter malty finish. Very easy drinking stout. Mouthfeel is quite viscous. Overall this is a great stout. I wish I had some fresh to see how the chocolate has faded over the couple years this has been cellaring.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,London1985,4.38,"Wow what can i say....  I picked this up from Utobeer in London's Borough Market today (March 26th 2011) and had to review it as it took me by complete surprise....  I was expecting just an 'ok' stout from this as my perception of the Brooklyn Brewery is kind of along the lines of mass produced beers so i didnt have high hopes for this.  However, when i opened and poured this, i was captivated by how dark and luscious it looked. It had the blackness to match its name and a lovely aroma.  It goes down very smooth and leaves an addictive film of alcohol and roasted coffee/chocolate flavours on your palatte like all good stouts should.  It has a beautiful lacing on the glass as you drink it down.  To cut it short, i wasnt expecting to drink the best ever stout i had with this.... but i also wasnt expecting such a wonderfully crafted and flavorful drink that goes down so smooth and is so pleasent on the nose and palatte.  Well done Brooklyn Brewery... you have produced an exceptional stout when compared to its price.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,raszputini,3.76,"From the bottle to a tulip glass. Pours jet black with a very thin tan head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is light with mild notes of roasted malt and chocolate. The taste is pretty intense. These malts are BURNT, but not in a bad way. The chocolate and coffee tone it down a little, but this is still a pretty intense brew, as it should be. Mouth is moderately thick, but not chewy and somewhat sticky. This is my favorite Brooklyn product so far",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Carbonation is not present in the body. Very typical for a RIS.  S: The aroma comes off very clean, with a big roasted body and subtle hints at chocolate. Sweetness is found in the nose as well. Overall aroma is standard and nothing really breathtaking.  T/M: On the front, this has a nice sweet roasted character, with high interplay of malts and bittering hops. Chocolate doesn't really come through till the beer warms up and bit. Mouthfeel is thick and leaves with a silky coat.  O: Can't really see the huge attraction to this brew, although it is really good, I find it to get lost with a lot of other RIS. Chocolate really is not showcased as I would have thought from the name.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BirdsandHops,3.88,"A: Pours black with three fingers of brown head, which recedes into a thin cap with decent lacing.  S: Dark, smoky malts up front followed by a blast of dark/semi-sweet chocolate. There are some hops on the end, providing a light piny aroma. The alcohol shows up in the aroma as well.  T: Similar to the aroma, there are roasted malts up front followed by dark chocolate and some bitter coffee flavors. The hops kick in, providing a piny flavor towards the end. The finish is of bitter coffee and some alcohol warmth.  M: Thick body with low carbonation, this beer is thick and somewhat creamy, though the carbonation and bitterness provide a bite on the finish.  O: Overall, a pretty good RIS. Nothing spectacular, but very cheap and better than many RISs much more expensive.

M/D: a creamy, full-bodied brew that feels great swishing around in the mouth. Relatively easy drinking here too, though it's definitely an imperial stout. A solid chocolate stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JerseyKirk,2.76,"This was my first imperial stout so my review might be a little bit off due to the higher alcohol content.  A: Poured a rich dark mocha 3 finger head. Deep rich black malt. Ultra dark. Head retention is great for such high alcohol content. Lasted long with excellent lacing. By the end the top of the glass still held laced head.  S: Dark chocolate, dark malt, little bit of alcohol. I really like how sweet the dark chocolate smells. Deep rich cocoa that lasts.  T: Deep rich cocoa and dark malts. Alcohol is definitely there and warming. The finish lingers with espresso and cocoa. Not bitter at all. Alcohol flavor really reduces the grade.  M: Creamy but not as much as Guinness. There is a full bodied almost thick and chewy feel but not entirely there. The more is swish it around in my mouth the thicker and more enjoyable the feel is.  D: Although some stouts I really enjoy, this isn't one of them. Making something high alcohol without blending it more the alco flavor is too paramount. The beer flavor should be the high note not the low note against the alcohol. Maybe its me I love the chocolate and espresso notes but the alcohol doesn't make me want to have another.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S: Pretty potent chocolate nose--about as strong as I've noticed--but without being sweet at all. A bit boozy and rum-like, with pleasantly burnt sugar notes. Very good.  T: The dryness is perfectly in line with the dark chocolate sensation. Otherwise, very solid roasted malt characteristic. It's just a bit too boozy tasting.  M: Smooth and round, but as mentioned, a touch alcoholic. Good carbonation for the style.  O: A great beer, one of those that really embodies a chocolate stout for me. Probably not world class, but definitely an exemplar, and not a bad value for the quality and the ABV. Everybody should drink this beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

No light penetrates the dark depths of this stout The foam recedes leaving a tan ring which sticks around for the duration. The nose is roasted malt, coffee, and cocoa. Taste follows. Huge chocolate and coffee notes backed up by roasted malt sweetness and dark frluit. Very nice. The finish is pure coffee, and mild hop bitterness. Feel is thick and viscous which is perfect for this beer. Low carbonation lends a very satisfying creamy texture which is just exquisite. No trace of the 10% ABV is detectable making this brew dangerously drinkable. I am really enjoying this one. Highly recommended!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

T - A very strong, forward taste. At the beginning, it's a lot of that dark fruit, especially raisins. As the beer fills the mouth, you get a good helping of that dark chocolate and roasted coffee. I thought the taste was very complex.  M - It's a good, full bodied beer that coats the throat as you drink. Just a twinge of burn from the alcohol and a bit of carbonation.

Sticky matted lacing clings to the walls of the glass as it warms. Completely opaque black color and just the slightest drop of light coming through in the bottom of the glass revealing a dark ruby port color.  Cocoa and dark fruit like raisins and burnt dates are on the nose. Deeply complex ash and chocolate malts are abundant.  Taste was intense and lovely with dark fruit and chocolate pronounced throughout. I did notice a slightly soapy taste in the aftertaste however. As it warmed up the taste faded. Little bitterness except framing up the balance is present. A lovely representation of this style.  Deeply intense and warming as you swish this over your taste buds it's defiantly a winner.

The -09 version is well balanced but perhaps the character R.I.S. is usually more rugged than this brew. Almost milky in the nose i see this beer as one that you can serve to the avrage joe and he will understand but perhaps not like (depending on taste ofcourse). My conclusion is that its got a pretty high drinkability and the taste is perfect.

45,680,mintjellie,4.43,"Winter 2009-2010 bottling.  Black as tar and completely impenetrable to light, topped by a generous helping of crema-coloured foam that leaves the occasional spot sticking to the glass. Strong coffee aroma with hints of molasses and chocolate. Big coffee and chocolate flavour, lots of roast and char. Leaves a lingering acidity and bitterness behind, like a mouthful of French roast coffee or espresso. All these bitter and burnt flavours are accompanied by a touch of residual sweetness, creating a beautiful balance of bitter and sweet. There's just a trace of alcohol warmth at the back of the mouth. This was quite boozy when fresh, but time and a cool dark closet have tamed it. Full-bodied with a fine, velvety carbonation that helps to lighten it. It's odd how it can feel so full and so light at the same time. I love the mouthfeel of this beer, but can understand that someone looking for a heavy and substantial RIS might be disappointed by it. 9% ABV be damned, I'd be drining a second if I had any more left.

Rating is for the 2010-11 vintage.  Vintage 2010-11: Very dark black color beer. Nice head. Brown color head. Intense aroma of chocolate with some raisin notes. Coffee too as it warms. I get also the licorice. In the mouth, this beer is creamy. Awesome! Warms too. Taste wise it is licorice, coffee. Not much chocolate in this one. Drinks so easily! Needs to be drank slowly to discover all the different aspect of the beer as it warms.  Thanks ritzkiss and liamt07. A very good beer!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Jugs_McGhee,3.6,"Served from a bottle in the Salthouse pub in Galway, Ireland. Poured into a Gouden Carolus goblet (which we later ""borrowed"").  A: Tan head of pathetic retention. Sheer black. The retention is forgiveable given the ABV.  Sm: Chocolate, toffee, alcohol. Caramel. A moderately strong scent overall.  T: Chocolate from build through to the finish. Open lacks the cream it needs. Alcohol is certainly present, but not unpleasant. Body is well built and balanced. Finish is nice. Tones of roasted barley are subtly supportive of the body.  Mf: The smoothness carries the alcohol across the palate, whilst the dryness lets the flavour come through. Well executed, particularly for a beer of this style.  Dr: Hides its ABV dangerously well. If it were half the price, I'd get it every night. Elsewise, it's just a treat for every once 'n' then. Here's a beer that boldly tries to be unique, and succeeds. Bravo.  3.98  --- 11/02/13: I picked this up at me local HEB grocery and wanted to re-review (with truncated notes) since my palate has changed in the last two and a half years. 10% ABV confirmed. 12 fl oz brown glass bottle. Expectations are high. Served into an Avery snifter.  Served cold and allowed to warm. Side-poured with standard vigor.  Paired with Lindt milk chocolate.  A: No bubble show forms as I pour.  Pours a quarter finger head of khaki colour that recedes entirely inside of ten seconds, leaving no lacing behind.  Body colour is an opaque solid jet black. No yeast particles are visible.  Overall, it looks as it should. Quite within style conventions. I'm looking forward to trying it, but it's not unique or special.  Sm: Bitter dark chocolate, dark malts, chocolate malt, faint roasted barley, cream, light caramel, and burnt sugars. Maybe black strap molasses. Some very welcome pecan as well as a hint of vanilla. It does have some buried dark fruit on the back end which I'm glad isn't too prominent: grape, fig, dates. Seems sweet; there's little bitterness here.  No yeast, hops, or alcohol character is detectable. I'm really looking forward to trying this. A bold assertive aroma of mild strength.  T: Straightforward milk and dark chocolate. I wish it the chocolate was more multidimensional, but it's pretty one note. Dark malts, chocolate malts, cocoa. The roast is too buried. Molasses. Very reticent hints of grape and fig. Caramel. Complementary burnt sugars. Enjoyable pecan. A hint of vanilla. The subtlety of the flavour profile leaves it feeling more simple than it actually is; it's well balanced and nicely put together, but not quite gestalt. Average depth and duration of flavour. Below average intensity of flavour. Sweet but not overly so.  No yeast, hops, or alcohol come through substantially.  Mf: Smooth and wet. Should be creamier. Unrefreshing. Somewhat acidic. Has a very light acridity akin to espresso. Decent body and thickness. Okay presence on the palate. Would be better softer. Suits the flavour profile generally well.  Not oily, harsh, gushed, hot, boozy, or astringent.  Dr: Drinkable for the ABV but I think it'd do well with some age. I'll happily kill the 4 pack I picked up and look forward to setting some down to cellar. A solid brew from Brooklyn and an important one historically.  Pairs well with chocolate.  Low B  -- 03.30.14: truncated notes.  A: Pours a nice tan head with some richness. It recedes fully inside 2 minutes. Body is an opaque jet black.  Sm: Sweet. Milk chocolate, faint roast, dark malts, chocolate malts. True to its namesake. The chocolate has depth and character. I do pick up on a kiss of licorice, which isn't great to my personal tastes. Cream.  Wisps of rum, sugarcane, and even coconut are barely perceptible. It's an understated but highly enjoyable aroma of mild strength. Not boozy, yeasty, or hoppy. Sweetness is near perfect.  T: Milk chocolate dominates, but it isn't as sweet as the aroma suggested. There is ample sweetness on the open, which is soon balanced nicely by some cacao bitterness and faint roasted barley. I do notice a bit of coconut, but luckily no licorice. It's not a hoppy, yeasty, or boozy flavour profile by any means, and I find it well-balanced and very enjoyable. Varied dark malts fill out the body nicely.  It's simpler than I remember it, but still remarkably cohesive and well-built. Nice depth of flavour.  Mf: Smooth, silky, and wet, with light touches of coarseness and dryness from the roast. Well-executed overall. A biteen overcarbonated, perhaps. Texture complements the taste well.  Dr: A sipper, but a mighty enjoyable one. A well-executed stout from Brooklyn which I imagine I'll be picking up every year. It'd be interesting to see where it goes with age, as well. I'd recommend this to friends. Worth cellaring, and absolutely a must-try for stout fans. Hides its high ABV well. The 12 oz format is perfect for this beer; a greedier brewery would try to push bombers on us for a higher price per ounce. A winter treat.

45,680,deltatauhobbit,4.33,"I've had this several times but just haven't put up a review for it yet. Vintage 2010-2011. Do have to admit that this beer gets much better with age though.  Pours a dark black color with a great sized tan head, fades at a slow rate, when held up to the light barely a hint of light can penetrate around the edges.  Smell has a nicely crafted aroma of chocolate and roasted malt, it doesn't smell fake or sweet but a nice dark chocolate type aroma, touch of dark fruit in the nose as well.  Taste is a mix of roasted malt and chocolate malt, coffee-like bitterness, not much of a hop presence which is not surprising, the strength is very evident with a slight burn on the tongue and a warming sensation in the belly, definitely needs some time to smooth out, creaminess is decent, slight dark fruit on the sides, carbonation is spot on, full-bodied yet not cloying which is a fine line to walk.  One of the best examples of a RIS, right up there with Old Rasputin. The fact that this beer is widely available during the winter months is also quite the achievement.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ms11781,4.2,"Winter 2010-11 on bottle. 12oz bottle poured into a snifter.  An aggressive pour produces a one finger light brown head that quickly reduces to a thin tan ring around the glass. The beer itself is as black as black can be. Even when held up to light there is a hint of dark brown where the foam meets the liquid but it's all black. Each sip leaves a good bit of foamy lacing that doesn't stick to the sides, but does take a good amount of time to drip back down the glass to meet the head.  The nose yields a huge dose of bitter chocolate right out of the gate. Roasted coffee and dark malts are here as is a surprising amount of dark fruit. There is some vanilla and some smokiness as well. It's rounded out by an alcohol presence just strong enough to burn the nostrils a tad when inhaled deeply.  Tons of flavors in the taste. Actually starts off with a bit of sweetness, some dark fruit and a touch of milk chocolate. Dark chocolate and some roasted coffee come in before a huge dose of roasted, or to be more exacted charred malt makes for a bitter finish. There is also a fair amount of booze in the finish, but it's warm in the back of the throat and is quite pleasant.  Mouthfeel is interesting. It feels rich, creamy and smooth yet at the same time the ample carbonation makes it feel pretty light for the style. Enjoying the fact that a stout can feel this full without actually being so.  Drinkability is outstanding for a beer of such a high ABV. Most likely a one and done but it's possible to have a couple if spaced out correctly. A very enjoyable experience and a beer I'd love to see again with some age on it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,EricCioe,4.12,"This pours black with a nice two finger tan head that dissipates into an island and a ring with no lacing. On the nose there is dark chocolate and espresso, pretty standard, but lurking under are some figs or other dark fruit that kind of set this apart within the genre for me. In the mouth the chocolate asserts itself most with the dark fruit and espresso coming in underneath, maybe some caramelized sugar too. There is a prickly mouthfeel that works really well with the big body. For a big stout this is quite drinkable, a very good example of the style with some nice stuff going on behind the ubiquitous coffee/chocolate.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

M: Medium bodied, adequate carbonation, great smooth, mouthfeel.

45,680,SirRuss,3.95,"Rhettroatcive East Coast Series (respect to the man)....  I'll keep this brief since i'm writing retrospectively.  A -Great color, great head. Retention is a little fleeting, and the lacing is acceptable, although nothing outstanding.  S - Superb expressions of (surprise surprise) chocoalte - bittersweet to be precise. Vanilla lends a creamy note, and hops flutter floral impressions in the background  T - Pretty good. Nice expressions of espresso bean and dark chocolate. The vanilla also presents itself well while remembering its place on the backseat. Finally, the roasted malts own the back palate for a biting finish.  M - This one's a bit of a contradiction. A distinct creaminess imparted by the brew, but the high carbonation and a slightly hollow profile results in its dilution, and a thinner-than-expected overall mouthfeel almost leaves it in the upper-end porter range.  D/O - A decent chocolate stout. It was slightly disappointing to not see greater emphasis on the chocolate notes, and a more substantial mouthfeel would have really taken this brew to another level. Although BBCS cant punch like the big boys in its category, it's definitely worth a try. Assuming the price point is reasonably assigned, I'd have no qualms returning to this one as a lighter end to an evening.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

A- opaque, light tan 1 finger head settles quickly.  S- Chocolate notes with some additional dark fruit. ABV is detectable in the nose.  T- I'm getting lots of the tartness of the dark fruits again on the front end, seems to be more dominant here than in other RIS. These fade to a very nice chocolate near the finish.  M- full bodied, absolutely outstanding here. Seems to be silky soft with just a touch of carbonation that brings out the chocolate.  D- This seems to be a well-crafted beer, the body is absolutely amazing. I'm wondering if some age on the bottle would have mellowed some of the dark fruit a bit and brought out more chocolate and roastiness. I wish I would have grabbed 2 bottles, now I may have to hunt for one.  08/09 Version generously provided by DrDog, can't say enough about that guy. Reviewed 3/17/11  A- hasn't changed a bit, very nice.  S- Dark fruits are big in the nose again seems to be slightly less tart than the 10/11. Chocolate is present but muted.  T- Flavors seem to be better balanced with the age on it. Tartness is still there, but is balanced by the chocolate flavor.  M- still feels fantastic, very smooth, still the best part of this beer.  O- glad I was able to try this, if I was tempted to buy more of this I would definitely let it continue to age as the balance does improve.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Dark chocolate and espresso upfront, with dark/candied fruits and molasses (or roasted malts) in the middle. Boozy warming finish, but relatively well hidden considering the ABV. Slight smokiness. Overall quite complex, and quite delicious!  M: Well rounded viscosity with a bit of creaminess. Lighter mouthfeel than I was expecting, but still very pleasant. Mild carbonation.

Flavors are assertive bright semi sweet black coffee and black chocolate. Full roasted grain flavors that are more sweet coffee/sweet bright acidic espresso that chocolate. Appealing and inviting.

45,680,CMB2012,4.5,"12oz bottle from the winter 10-11 release, batch number 0141 0905 (couldn't find any info for the meaning behind this). Poured into a pint glass. Served at cellar temperature.  A- Pours a nice jet black with perfect two finger nutty brown head. The head dissipates slowly in a pocketed pillow fashion.  S- This beer smells great! Starts out with a mix of milk and dark chocolates, followed by a very nice roasted grain and coffee. Smells slightly sweet at the end reminiscent of vanilla, and there is some alcohol to this vanilla as well. The overall effect of the last two reminds me of vanilla flavored yogurt balls.  T- Much like the aroma, this beer tastes a very balanced mix of roasted, coffee, and chocolate flavors. The vanilla is not as noticeable in the taste, but there is a slight alcohol warming at the end, which works for me in this style. The balance is so well done in fact that it is tough to mark exactly when each flavor makes contact with the senses. Oh well, the outcome is delicious.  M- The mouth on this one is near perfect for the style. Not too abbrasive, a nice amount of carbonation so that it's not too thick, but plenty of body to allow those roasty flavors to bloom and seep in to the taste buds. I dig it.  This is the third beer of four that I have drunk, and sadly the last (the fourth I shared with my dad, cause I'm a nice guy... sometimes). Only now, though, did my dumb ass bother to drink it at the right temperature. It does wonders for the complexity of the beer and all yous should keep that in mind for when drinking this beer - and the style in general for that matter.  I hope many get to try this wonderful brew, cheers!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,RBassSFHOPit2ME,4.42,"What a Phenominal Stout, courtesy of dogfishandi  A - Standard for the style  S - almost as much vanilla as there is chocolate. I wouldn't say Dark chocolate either. I'd say a nice mix of milk and dark chocolate in the aroma  T - drank at cellar temp and was all chocolate and vanilla. Sugar chocolate chip cookie. Freaking delicious. Not too roasty and SMOOTH. Hops are present in the middle and finish to dry out this stout some and make it easier drinking...at least for me. I could only imagine how silky smooth all the characteristics I'm getting now would be if I would have let this age a year and 1/2 or 2 years.  M - Pretty nice. Better than average. Oily slick.  D - If this were a bomber, I'd have NO problems handling it. Great for the style. Not too heavy and not at all thin for the style. About perfect.  Perfect way to chase two 10 oz pours of PtY.

The mouthfeel is thick and rich of flavors and some carbonation, very smooth and creamy with a little bite from the alcohol in the end.

45,680,amcmaho1,4.12,"Big thanks to injuredreserve for getting this beer to me. 2010 vintage, poured into oversized wineglass served cool, and is wonderfully warming up and showing off it's complexities.  Appearance: Seems pretty typical for a R.I.S, in that there's a very opaque black/ dark dark brown body, with some delicate coffee-colored head. As it pours, the head definitely has some gusto, and sticks around for a bit before mellowing out to bordering the rim of the glass. Definitely a very attractive beer!  Smell: Right off the bat there is some definite cocoa/ chocolate, along with black licorice, tobacco smokiness, lots of roasted malt obviously, and a little bit of alcohol heat. Seems to be really nicely balanced, or at least not chocolaty to the point of overpowering the other nuance-flavors there. Nice hop profile as well.  Taste: Nice amount of chocolate in the middle and after-taste, along with more roasted malt sweetness and some smokey almost tobacco like taste. There is a little bit of alcohol heat in the aftertaste, perhaps just a typical burn, but it seems mild (dangerously so). Again, the hop profile is assertive, but not overpowering. The chocolate seems to be most prominent on the aftertaste, which i like, for it allows all the other flavors here to shine through.  Mouthfeel: This isn't necessarily the highly viscous, oily, and tarry RIS that many seem to gravitate towards. This beer has a medium heavy body, still holding it's own and staying true to style, while remaining smooth and devoid of any cloying sweetness or stickiness. With the amount of hop bitterness present here, there's not one single flavor taking control, and that balance holds out to the mouthfeel too. Balanced, full, and not tormenting.  Drinkability: I can definitely see why this beer is regarded as highly as it is. It exemplifies the style with some smoothness and swagger, and makes for a very accessible RIS. I will certainly seek out future trades for more of this beer!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BeardedRiker,4.2,"The most recent brews I've had from Brooklyn Brewing Co. have been their #1 and #2 ales. The Local #1 was really good and the #2 was up there too even though I'm not the biggest Belgian fan. This time I picked up their Black Chocolate Stout. It's getting cooler and darker outside every successive day, so I, and everyone else, need to be drinking beers for the season. Most chocolate stouts I've had are decent but not great. Most sacrifice overall flavor and robustness for the chocolate flavor. No me gusta. Anyway, that's enough NOT talking about the Black Chocolate Stout!  As Charles Barkley says, ""Lemme tell ya sumthin"", I knew this would be a good beer as soon as I poured it and my nose became tingled by the chocolaty, roasty, liquorice aroma.  Color is like a very dark chocolate and it turns a lighter brown/chocolate color around the edges when put up to light. The head on it was frothy and tan. A thin film of frothiness stays for awhile on top of the beer.  Unlike most other chocolate stouts I've had, this one has a more cocoa chocolate taste to it. It's not too sweet. It's actually got quite a bit of bitterness that took me awhile to understand and get used to, but the overall flavor is pretty good. At first tasting you are hit with the chocolate bitterness and alcohol. The bitterness later on is balanced with the sweeter chocolate and a roasty coffee flavor as well. I'd prefer that there be less chocolate/coffee bitterness at the beginning, but this is one of the better chocolate stouts I've had.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The head receded fairly quickly and left a light streaky film.  The smell was sweet and chocolatey, with a subtle hint of rubbing alcohol. There was a mellow roasted malt aroma as well. Just barely a hint of coffee.  The taste was pretty choco-centric. Behind the chocolate again was the roasted malts, followed a slight hop bitterness.

The smell is composed of dark fruits, roasty chocolate malt, coffee, and a touch of alcohol. The first sip yields vanilla, roasted malts, and dark chocolate, then dark fruits and just a touch of hops jump in the mix. It finishes very dry and boozy, with a nice very dark chocolate flavor to finish it out. Well done.  The mouthfeel is very thick and sticky with a medium amount of carbonation.

45,680,midworken,3.95,"Poured a deep, opaque black body with hints of brown. Head was a dark leather that left a substantial amount of lacing. Upfront aromas were of sweet chocolate that left with dark chocolate and lightly roasted coffee. Was there some green bell peppers that I smell, too?  Taste very well complimented the nose, while sweetness was in the aroma, the taste was more of bitter/dark chocolate. This is the first time I've really noticed these two (aroma and taste) complimenting each other with such great synergy, and I think it sets a mark of where a beer should stand in these two categories. I was constantly smelling before the taste and smelling after the taste because it was so pleasant (I do this most of this time, but I was purposeful in doing it for this beer). The taste wasn't complex, but it was still very good. I really thought this is a great beer to have 2 or 3 in one night.  Definitely not a session beer, but it's drinkability was very high and the mouthfeel was just right.

Doesnt change the 4 just adds a depth of flavor  *edit* 11/1/11 Mouth- A medium body with a medium carb level bordering on low feel. Was a bit creamy with a bitter aftertaste.

45,680,rowingbrewer,4.38,"This beer pours a dark brown to black color with a think off white to tan colored head that goes away pretty fast. the smell is roasty malts up front followed by some sweet dark fruit notes that linger. the beer was cold form the tap and its strange that alcohol presence was more noticeable when the beer was cold, I think this was because the other flavors were muted. as the beer warmed the hints of chocolate came out, along with dark fruit flavors and a little sweetness from the unfermentable sugars. the mouthfeel felt slightly thinner when it was cold, but again as the beer warmed it was fuller and smoother. this is a very drinkable beer especially when served a cellar temperature.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,victory4me,4.24,"Poured into a Duvel Tulip. 2009 vintage.  Pours dead black with a half to one finger head that lingers nicely. Nice lacing, thin coating of bubbles just hangs on the glass. One of my all time favorite smelling beers. Combination of bitter dark Belgian chocolate and wet paint.  Taste is of bitter chocolate, cocoa, and a mild roastiness reminiscent of coffee. I think I may prefer this beer fresher as the age has allowed it to sweeten up a good deal. Mouthfeel brings a coating of silky sweet chocolate. Drinkability is good.  Brooklyn BCS is one of my favorite RIS' of all time. I do think I like this one a little fresher as I really enjoy the alcohol burn and stronger wet paint aroma when this is less than 6 months old.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,cavedave,3.45,"Winter 10/11 release.  Pours a darkest dark brown, topped by a surprising amount of light brown foam. A swirl leaves oil slicks and small bubbles on the glass. Has a look just shy of motor oil. A small skim stays for the ride.  Nice nose, some deep herbally bitter frames the expected chocolate, some roasty char, hints of coffee, even a hint of tart yeasty cherry in there.  Excellent flavor fronts the sip in this, some cherry chocolate grabs some bitter roast and syrup sweet through the start. As it warms the chocolate becomes very dominant, both sweet/candy-like, and bakers chocolate flavors. It ends with sweet chocolate dominance, cherrybomb with insufficient drier notes, resulting in an overly sweet brew, even for style, that becomes mediciny. Too bad.  Thankfully this isn't even more viscous, but it is unpleasantly resinous as the glass empties, with progressively less fine finish. Nicely low carb. best thing I can say for the feel.  Drinkability is average. Taste is better than some other oversweet offerings in this style, but far less fine than the best. Good enough to enjoy, but not to crave.  Impression: Perhaps the others in cellar will come together in future years, the oversweet diminish. No desire to revisit until then. Not recommended, with Aphrodite, and choc.

45,680,liquidsunshine,4.25,"Pours a deep black in color, as the label would indicate. One finger of tan brown head sticks around and leaves a pleasant lacing. This beer smells like fire, but that is most likely due to the fire and not the beer itself. The dark rich malt and roasty scents balance well with the pleasant burning wood aromas. The flavor is deep and varied, developing well over the palate. In the front comes the malt, followed by the semi sweet chocolate and rounded off with a gentle bitterness from the hops. The mouthfeel is not quite as creamy as I would like for a stout, but the otherwise overall excellent quality of this brew compensates for that. Definitely recommended.

45,680,bwiechmann,4.23,"Scored this brew from a great BA. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter.  A well-crafted imperial stout. Pours deep black with a nice mocha head. Nose and taste are of deep, rich chocolate and roasted malts. Noticeable alcohol but no over-top-burn here. Mouthfeel is full with good carbonation. Drinkability is good for the style and the ABV. Well worth seeking out.  UPDATE  Sat on a couple bottles for a year and can't get enough. The heat dissipates, chocolate comes to the forefront even more than when fresh. Any harsh edges are smoothed out and the flavors come together remarkably well.

45,680,marty21,4.5,A: 09-10 Version. Pours pitch black with a fingers worth of brown head. Settles to a solid brown cap and leaves lots of lace.  S: Dark roasted malt and tons of dark and milk chocolate. Maybe a little fruit in there as well. T: Lots of chocolate but there's also a big hit of sweetness right in the middle. Finishes with some more chocolate and dark malt. Can't taste any alcohol. Might be because it's 1 year old.  M: Light carbonation with a full body.  D: This was a great beer. The first sip hits you hard but then you get used to it and it's great.

45,680,jayhawk73,4.08,"Pours a jet black with a thin caramel head that quickly disappears to a thin strip. The smell is that of malt, chocolate and coffee w/ a hint of alcohol. I'd really like the smell to be more present and bold, like the taste- but it's still good. The taste is really nice, with chocolate, coffee and malt and a tad too much alcohol taste for me. It is a 10% beer, but I'd like the alcohol taste to be a little more stealthy. Mouthfeel is great- very smooth and silky. Nice aftertaste, which lingers for a while. This is a strong beer w/ a high ABV, and I wouldn't drink more than a couple in a sitting. Really good beer, but the alcohol presence keeps it from being truly world class.

45,680,CwrwAmByth,4.15,"I'm very much looking forward to this one having heard good stuff about it, so here we go. Upon the pour I am greeted with a torrent of thick, dark brown, foamy liquid, settling in the glass well with a nice tall head, sticking to the sides well. It smells good, really good. Chocolate is coming through very strongly, as well as malts and alcohol. The taste hits you rather hard at first with a malty bitterness, but then the chocolate comes through and tones it down a notch, and it goes down smoothly, bitterness coming through again slightly after you swallow, which is a nice touch, providing a crisp, dry finish, and a lovely warm feeling in your belly. If you don't like bitterness too much though, rest assured it dissipates as it warms up. The mouthfeel is always important on a stout I always feel, as if they are too watery it can sometimes let the taste down a bit. This does a good job, however I personally prefer the really thick, Black Albert types, but comparing the two is unfair, as this is not a small craft brewed beer. This one is very good though. Overall, this is a top notch drink, outstanding even, considering it is a mass produced stout. A lovely dark, creamy taste with a bitter kick, this one will surely warm you up on a cold night.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Jadjunk,4.29,"#87. Brooklyn Brewery's Black Chocolate Stout is a pretty popular RIS. Having never tried it before, I was excited to find a single for a fairly reasonable price at the local bottle shop. This is a limited bottling - Winter 10-11. It took a long time to warm to a decent temperature!  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a pint glass at room temp.  (Appearance) Pours a two finger depth milk-chocolate tone head with a frothy, airy appearance. Retention is about average; it's not holding back much but it's also not dying rapidly. It slows slightly when it comes to a surface cover at about 1 finger depth and holds well. Some receding lacing graces the side in unpredictable patterns but unfortunately doesn't stick. The color is 1 shade lighter than pure black with some very slight light getting through the edges. Nonetheless, the beer looks thick and full. There is no visible carbonation on the edges of the glass but I can't see much beyond that. The appearance is decent. 3.5  (Smell) The bitter end is pure creamy chocolate cocoa with a slight touch of nutty tones and quite possibly some earthy hops too. The sweeter end balance comes from some other arrangement of dark malts. It balances the nose out very well. Beyond the balance is a satisfyingly thorough and potent aroma that is truly captivating. There is not much else to say about this complex beer. It smells excellent. 4.5  (Taste) At least as complex as the aroma, the first bit of this beer has a detailed wash of chocolate tones and sweet but heavy flavored dark malts and I can feel the pure cocoa resting on my tongue. If there are any hops included in here, they round themselves out through the entire beer, as there are bitter qualities in every part of the drink. An excellent bitter, charred smoky finish is at least as astounding. I would never have gotten that from the nose. Thoroughly flavorful and complex. My review here doesn't even begin to describe it. 4.5  (Mouthfeel) A bitter but slightly crisp primary sip and a surprisingly brutal dry end. Alcohol is well concealed and the beer is thinner than the average Russian Imperial but doesn't manage to get too bland in any area. This is a full bodied brew for sure. The bitterness and dry finish slows the drinking down significantly and puts an interesting sizzle on the tongue. It does well as long as you don't mind complexity. 4  (Drinkability) The issue with multiple drinks is that this is just a filling stout. The bitterness and dry qualities of this beer are enough to slow you down to enjoy the drink and to let your palate let you know you're full. As such, I couldn't have more than two at a single sitting. The ABV certainly doesn't help, but as long as it's well hidden, as in this one, it's more than welcome. Great complex taste and a pleasing aroma and appearance to boot. Surpassing limited drinks the one I have I know I will savor. This beer is a winner. 4  Verdict: This beer manages to hit many great keys with me and I praise it for it's complexity and flavor (of which the taste is slightly more varied than the aroma). Drinkability is great in small numbers and the appearance could use some very slight fine tuning (in terms of head retention and lacing), but have no doubt, this is a solid stout.

45,680,Mancer,3.98,"The bottle poured out a dark brown body with a three finger high light brown head. The head was a thick foam that eventually dissipated into a thick and sticky lace that smothered the glass. The initial aromas were of dark fruits, roast, malts and a huge helping of prunes. Frankly, the prunes are quite overwhelmingly.The initial flavors were of prunes, bitter unsweetened chocolate and roasted barley. The beer had a full body with light carbonation.  Overall this beer is pretty spot on for the style, however I am not a huge fan of the prunes and after a while they seemed to get a bit tedious. Interesting beer, but not quite in my alley for a stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,SkeeterHawk,4.17,"I have had this beer for a while and I just reviewed the ""Lump of Coal"" from Ridgeway, and I seriously need a good beer to wipe the taste out of my mouth. I remember that this beer was really nice, so it would be good to end my beer drinking evening on a high note. Here we go...  Appearance: Pours black as motor oil with a small head of tan bubbles on top after an aggressive pour. The head faded into the beer within about 20 seconds and left a very small ring where the beer meets the glass.  Aroma: I get plenty of dark malts and chocolate with some evident alcohol as spiciness. There is some hops evident here as a floral component to the aroma, but they are supporting the whole malt ensemble.  Taste: The flavor is really malty as well, but the beer is relatively thin on the palate for such a big beer. There is lots of chocolate and other dark malts, and a pretty well defined dark caramel component. The hops are present in the flavor, but are very reserved compared to the malt and alcohol. The alcohol in particular is a big player in this beer by adding spice and mouthfeel in the beginning of the sip and then fading into a lingering warmth on the back of the throat. As the beer warms up, there is a Rauch flavor starting to become more noticeable and contributing a pretty significant amount of oiliness that sticks on the back of the throat. Overall the beer is medium bodied with low carbonation. It is well attenuated, so the body isn't too syrupy as a result.  Opinion: This is a really good beer. I like the balance of malt and hops, and the stout makes a solid showing without ending up too acidic on the palate to linger. That said, it could use a bit more carbonation, and it ends up a bit dry in the finish for my personal preference, but it is still a very easy drinking beer and one that I will definitely try again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,TheJollyHop,4.27,"2010-2011 Vintage  Nearly black, viscous pour yielding a mousse like light brown head, with scents of bakers chocolate, toffee, tobacco, coffee beans, toasted bread, black licorice, and alcohol. Wow, complex and engaging nose for an imperial stout.  Creamy, rich chocolate, roasted grain, caramel, warming alcohol throughout the taste, dark fruits, and some ashy like char as well. The bitterness barely breaks the sweet malt surface, and one there is promptly overwhelmed. Ends silky smooth with a lingering dark chocolate taste; very close to drinking chocolate. There is no harshness or excessive bitterness in the flavor profile that you might find in West Coast Imperial Stouts.  The mouthfeel is great as there is just enough weight on the tongue, and the carbonation reduces the intensity of this sweet stout. Exhibits a tongue coating characteristic that just begs to be renewed. One of the most well crafted, sweet Imperial Stouts I have had to date.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mjn5036,4,"2010-2011 Vintage  Poured into White Birch glass. This one pours jet black with a small mocha/tan colored head that quickly dissipates. A pleasant cascading affect is nice. A small ring of lacing is left around the circumference and some sticky lacing is left clinging to the glass. The amount of lacing surprises me considering the abv on this one. A really nice looking beer overall.  The nose on this beer is chock full of chocolate with hints of coffee, roasted malts and alcohol. I also pick on on sweet dark fruits. Not really complex but a good example of its style.  The taste is really quite good. An impressive amount of chocolate on the palate considering they only use chocolate malts to give the flavor. A little on the bitter side, like coffee made with too much of a water:coffee ratio, causing it to be bitter. Alcohol is present in the taste as well. Again, not a lot going on in the flavor, but still enjoyable.  A pleasant amount of carbonation makes this high abv beer quite drinkable. Alcohol bite is noticeable, so while this 12oz bottle is fairly high on drinkability, I don't think I would want more than one glass.

This slowly distills itself into a condensed layer of foam across the top, like swamp water. The lacing is there, in lines sheets and webs.  S- Ah, such an inviting beer. Aromas of chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, dark cherries, cherry cordial, cream chocolate, light espresso grounds, dutch cocoa.  T- Ah, such a delicious beer.The taste is less sweet than the aroma leads me to, more minerals and roast to go along with the chocolate. But still a lot of the same- chocolate, vanilla, espresso (here fading into more intense turkish coffee).  M- Somehow, sweet and dry and at the same time. I guess it's sort of sweet in the front of my mouth and dry by the time the roast and hops hit the back. Not a lot of syrupy, which is ok, but I think I'd prefer some more just so the beer shows off it's power. Certainly the alcohol is well hidden.

Maltiness and sweet all around.  Pretty thick on the palette, heavy bodied. Fairly wet, too.  Well for the 10% it's pretty drinkable.

The color of the head was a dark chocolate color not very dense. The aroma was full of Dark Chocolate with a roasty coffee background. Taste was along the same lines as the aroma mainly chocolate with a dry roast coffee flavor. The Coffe in the background pushes the chocolate flavor threw and drys it out a bit. The mouthfeel was exceptionally smooth and the abv was well hidden but their pushing flavors threw.

The taste is of sweet milk chocolate, burnt coffee, and alcohol, alot of alcohol. It drinks smoothly but could be considered a little light for a RIS. I don't find this to be as good as advertised. The alcohol comes out far too much in the taste and after taste. The booze lingers and it's a little too sweet for my liking.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,brewerburgundy,4,"12oz bottle, Bruery tulip, 2010-11 issue. Thank you drabmuh, this was something I really wanted to try.  I cannot see through this beer. It looks a bit oily, and very black. There was a quarter inch of head from the pour, though it quickly retreated, giving me only a small, oily ring of dark brown bubbles.  The nose is slightly charred malt, plump dark fruit, brown sugar or treacle sweetness, graham cracker, and only hints of dark chocolate. Slight solvent as it warms.  While I didn't get the famed alcohol heat in the nose, it shows up once I've taken a sip. Bitter cocoa, the charred malt, graham cracker, bitter and only slightly hot alcohol are evidenced in the beer. The dark fruit quotient is much lower here. Solvent creeps up as it warms.  The mouthfeel is medium-full with a slickness that seems to come from the copious alcohol and eventually a bit of tongue numbing from it. Small bubbles lend it a creaminess too.  For all the stories about this beer often being very hot fresh and even aged I think it's rather tame. I even think this vintage is quite drinkable for a 10% beer. I'd buy it if I was in market.  2011-12 Bottle on 7/8/12 There is more chocolate and alcohol in the nose for this year. Otherwise, wonderful and better than I remember.  2013-14 Bottle on 11/30/13 Rich, stark chocolate with little to no booze in the nose even this young. Definitely some in the taste as well as rich ripe fruits.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JohnFatAss,4.75,"Saved this for a cold, snowy night.  Poured this into a glass, almost pitch black in color. Lightly carbonated, thin brown head.  This is a thick, heavy and syrupy drink. It has a sweet, chocolatey smell. I could sense the alcohol in the smell.  Sweet chocolate taste, with a bittersweet finish. Slight taste of alcohol, but it does not take away from the experience.  More of an after dinner drink than a beer. I drank this with some brownies, and wow! The flavors explode in your mouth!  For such a strong drink, it is surprisingly smooth, but this is a drink that should be sipped, savored and enjoyed slowly.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,duffcalifornia,4.25,"Poured into a pint glass. '10-'11 vintage.  A: Looks like dark roast coffee - dark in the center, burnt mahogany on the edges. Poured very little head, mocha colored, some lacing.  S: Smells of dark chocolates, a hint of cherries, maybe a hint of vanilla. Very inviting. Upon lifting the glass to drink, smelled perhaps a whiff of alcohol aromas.  T: Tastes faintly like dark chocolate, with hints of coffee and alcohol on the finish.  M: Medium mouthfeel with a bit of a oily texture. Low carbonation, though I can't tell if that's normal, or my bottle was just low (due to almost nonexistent head)  D: This is an excellent dessert beer. It has just a hint of alcohol taste to it, which is impressive given it's 10% ABV. Despite being chocolate flavored, it is not cloyingly sweet, which is welcome. It would be very easy to enjoy a few of these over the course of an evening, which would be dangerous.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ColdPoncho,4.52,"A - it exudes power. the pour is the darkest brown with red tinges, the body is opaque black. The head is medium brown with varying bubble sizes and it stays.  S - you can smell the heat on it, kind of surprisingly. bitter coffee, biscuity notes, and loads of creamy chocolate. Great balance, and great things in it.  T - after my first sip I said, out loud, to myself ""I think this is really fuckin' good."" Big creamy chocolatey flavor with a brilliant woody/rawhide drying character. Theres the right amount of bite from the coffee. It's a brilliant beer, I should say. I'll have to pick up more for the cellar.  M - Big and smooth and creamy. You can really feel the thickness as you are trying to swallow it. It's just the right thing for the style.  D - Since it's only 10%, it's not ridiculously hampered by it's booziness. That said, it's a big beer, and as much as I might like to drink it, gotta keep it under control.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BeerdedEric,4,"Body is completely jet black. The head is almost dark brown. Some lacing. Looks good.  Dark chocalate, cherries, vanilla, toffee and booze. Very sweet aroma.  Tastes really good. Booze is almost completely masked by the flavors. Toffee, cherries, chocalate are all there. Really tasty, not as boozy as Imperial Stouts that I have had.  Body is medium. Quite smooth. Not as carbonated. Slight alcohol burn on the way down. Doesn't leave the mouth dry. Feel good.  Drink ability is good for a ten percent ABV. Feels smooth goes down easy for a sipper. I am gonna crack another one open though... and sip it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mavbrew,4.03,"A: Pours a deep brown/jet black color with a nice creamy, two finger thick, mocha colored head that leaves some nice lacing retention.  S: The nose has some dark chocolates, coffee beans and a little bit of dark fruit.  T: The taste has dark chocolates up front with some roasted malts as well. This flows into the dark fruits and the sweetness of the malts. There are some slight bitters in the taste but they are faint, as well as the alcohol. The finish has roasted malts and chocolates that are still lingering from the beginning.  M: Full bodied with average carbonation. Very thick mouthfeel, roasted and alcohol flavors linger in the palate.  D: I always look forward to picking up some of this every winter. It is one of the better RIS, not the best, but a very good one. The alcohol is faint but not totally disguised for a 10%, drink safely.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ianjsullivan,4,"ST: 12oz poured into a chalice.  A: Black with a very thin raggedy dark brown head (swirling the beer a few times does bring that beautiful brown head back). It leaves nice spotted lacing on the glass.  S: Chocolate cake or milt (of course), roasted malt, smoke and coffee.  T: Gentle smoke up front rolls into roasted malt and coffee in the middle. By the end, strong chocolate (bitter, not sweet), alcohol, some roasted coffee bean, and smoke take over the finish and stay there (a very nice long finish).  M: Heavy, creamy in the middle, though the finish is drier (the hops balance out the beer).  D: High abv and heavy body does not make this a beer to be consumed in large amounts.  Overall: An excellent winter beer. This is not the first time I have had Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout, but I never reviewed the beer until now. This stout is heavy, complex, and full of flavor. Even better, it is balanced well. I buy this every winter, and it has not disappointed me (except for when they changed from a six-pack to a four-pack).",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

It smells of roasted barley, sweet toasted malt and dark bittersweet chocolate.  Nice chocolate taste with malty sugars with a nice hop bitterness to balance the sweetness out. It's nice that it doesn't have a strong alcohol taste even though it comes in at 10% ABV.  Not too thin, not too thick, carbonation is right on. Definitely a nice stout, especially for a cold winter day.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ebby82,4.33,"Pours a deep roasty black into a tulip glass with a fair amount of head. It's only slightly cold because it's been sitting in a room in my house.  The aroma is of toasted malts, very sweet, with some coffee as well.  The taste is fantastic. Deep, roasted malts, roasted coffee, with just the slightest presence of alcohol. The aftertaste is very much coffee, and there is certainly a chocolaty flavor as well, but not as much as a Rogue Chocolate, for instance.  It's thick, and slightly chewy, but so delicious that it doesn't really need to be a sipper. Easily one of my favorite stouts, and I was happy to get a case this year.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,PeprSprYoFace,4.1,Got this beer from Starrdogg. Thanks man. I've had it before but never reviewed it.  Pours a deep black. Thin brown head but dissapated fast. Very little lacing.  Aroma of roasted malt and dark chocolate. Little bit of dark fruit and toasted caramel sugars.  Tastes just as it smells. Nice roastyness with a nice butter chocolate taste. No fake chocolate like I expected (nesquick). Little bit of toasted sugars.  Mouthfeel is nice. Nice carb.  Overall a good beer but I don't know if it's top 100 in the world worthy. Id have it again if it was on tap or local to me.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TAMU99,3.12,"Used half to make a glaze for ham - delicious, couldn't let the rest go to waste! Poured a black clear - dull red if light squeaks through. Thin, dark tan head left little lace. The scent is delicious. Chocolate and dark caramel, brownies and other baked delights. Taste is dark, bitter chocolate. Biting hops and a burnt or charcoal aftertaste. Pretty heavy mouthfeel - like a slavic man with an ushanka slapping you in the throat - with that smoke taste clinging to the back of the tongue for a little too long. Overall a powerful beer that I likely wouldn't choose to drink, however the cooking value is certainly higher than the taste lets on.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,SkunkWorks,4.37,"I've had this in the bottle before, but this is a review of the tap version. Had on tap at TJ Finleys in Bay Shore, NY. Served in a stemmed pokal glass.  Look: black body and I couldn't discern any highlights, which might've been helped by the darkness of the dark. Thin, less than a finger thick, mocha colored head sits at the top and retains quite well leaving a little lacing, but not a whole lot. Spot on for a Russian Imperial Stout.  Smell: sweet, roasted malt with a bit of coffee and chocolate. Nothing in the way of alcohol or hops in here.  Taste: follows the nose with sweet, chocolate malt and some coffee notes as well. This is probably as chocolatey as you can get without brewing with actual chocolate. There's a bit of alcohol bite in the finish but its not that strong and my mouth is left tasting chocolate after each sip.  Feel: medium to full bodied, lightly carbonated, not much alcohol is obvious except a slight bite in the finish, and a chocolate inspired aftertaste lingers for awhile. Not as thick or chewy as I would like from a Russian Imperial though.  Drink: one of the more drinkable Russian Imperial Stouts out there. One could easily drink several of these in a night and would enjoy the experience, provided they survived it.  Overall, a very good beer. I haven't had it in a long time and have always had the bottled versions. I'm usually skeptical of big stouts on tap but this was quite good. I'm very happy with this beer. I highly recommend.

45,680,pburland23,4.2,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my Great Divide Brussels glass.  I've been drinking Black Chocolate Stout for about a decade now, but am just getting around to reviewing it.  Beer pours an almost opaque black with hints of a rubyish brown around the edge. The head is thin and camel colored. It's an attractive pour.  The smell is dominated by dark chocolate and intense coffee aromas. The taste features coffee upfront (very assertive coffee...espresso perhaps) and then finishes with a rich, dark chocolate taste.  It's a well carbonated imperial stout and the mouthfeel is thick and full. The drinkability is dangerous as this beer hides its 10% abv incredibly well.  Black Chocolate Stout is a winter tradition that has stood the test of time. I look forward to enjoying it for years to come. As an added bonus, I've decided to cellar a few bottles to see how this year's version evolves.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The beer underneath rising up to diminish the head is complete darkness. All black, not a ray of light gets through.  S- The nose smells of an incredibly rich dark chocolate. Great roasty malts but not burnt. Loafs of bread come to mind, and nose finishes with vanilla hints. Smells great.  T- Flavor is dry roasted malts covered in dark chocolate. Alcohol is present with a spicyness to it. The tiniest bit of dark fruits hits me somewhere in the aftertaste.  M- Fairly creamy, a little on the lighter side of medium bodied. Some what drying but not over the top.  D- Would make for an excellent dessert beer. I think this might actually taste better when its cold. I let it warm for awhile and it lost a little bit I think, more chocolate flavor when it was right out of the fridge.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S - bitter dark chocolate, but also some sweetness. some alcohol too. kind of smells like bailey's irish cream. very appealing, makes my mouth water.  T/M - chocolate up front, not a lot though, some coffee and roasted malts too. very creamy. washes out with a bite from the alcohol which is good (warms you right up). full bodied. mild, but pleasant aftertaste (like you've had a good chunk of bitter chocolate).  D - I found that my glass was empty before I knew it. Surprisingly drinkable for it's thickness and it's 10% ABV. But overall a very pleasurable beer.

A - Pours a complete pitch black, with a thick, creamy, dark tan two finger head that recedes quickly but leaves some amazing lace behind. Its almost not fair to call it lacing, cause its not very laced, more like a solid curtain on the sidewalls of the glass.  S - Dark chocolate, cocoa, espresso and caramel malts dominate this beer. I've sat on this beer for over a year and i think thats is really mellowed out, at least from the smell. I'm not getting any booze in the aroma.  T - What can i say? A year does wonders. This is easily one of the best tasting RIS's that i have had to date. So mellow its not even funny. This is like drinking a 60% dark chocolate bar. Its dark, but still creamy. Amazing balance of dark chocolates, caramels, and coffee. There is ZERO alcohol burn. I bought a six pack of this beer and have been enjoying it every time, but this is the best i have had it to date.  M - Thick and creamy. Very smooth with excellently light carbonation. Very well balanced.  D - Besides Chokolat, this is the easiest Russian Imperial Stout i have had to date. This is so good that i dont want to drink it fast and am finding myself sipping it, not because its a sipper, but just cause i want this to last. I will try to trade for this years batch and sit on it as well. A wonderful dessert beer. Having this with chocolate brownies.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The head is a very dark tan color, almost brown, and leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass. This beer looks awesome.  On the nose you can pick up on some roasted notes from the malts and an ever-so-slight hint of chocolate. Smells pretty mild.  Flavor wise, the chocolate is definitely there. Its an unsweetened chocolate that lingers around for a while. Nothing extremely complex or unique about the flavor, but its just a very nice roasty tasting chocolate. Its on the thick side, with low carbonation, alcohol is not very prevalent, especially given the 10% ABV this thing packs; I am really surprised, its masked very well. Gets increasingly roasty and toasty as it warms, a good winter beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Yoonisaykul,4,"Poured into tulip. First thing I'm consuming today after a toothpasteless brush of the teeth. Dedication? Yes.  A- Looks and sounds heavy as it flows into the glass. Dark tan, creamy head sits ontop of pitch black. Can barely, (really) see some brown highlights. Looks very right.  S- Underneath a slightly sharp, hot alcohol, lies a real chocolate smell. A smooth, delicious, real cocoa powder chocolate milk. Cocoa oils/fats and all. Then underneath all of that I seem to be getting more vodka-like alcohol smell. It all blooms into a little bit of dark fruit as it warms. Something reminding me of marshmallow candy.  T- Definitely not as much chocolate here. More of a basic RIS taste. Almost no wateriness or metallic notes lke many other RIS which I really appreciate. Alcohol is still here and kicking though.  M- Very full, low carbonation. Not too sticky. For some reason, the first sip seemed super thick and velvety smooth but it all got thinner as I continued drinking. Oh well, now that I think about it... it's probably because of the head.  D- Good. Fun to drink.  Kind of disappointed about the lack of chocolate in the taste after such a promising smell. Still a very, very good beer.

Taste is pretty nice, some chocolate and roastiness, but seemed to have more earthiness from the hops than I liked. I think this would be eliminated with aging, and would increase my score. Medium to full bodied, medium carbonation. Was a bit disappointed with this beer despite the hype surrounding this beer... I just expected more.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,dragonWhale,3.85,"from the dismal depths, a dark frothy liquid appears. Murky at first, then murkier. The light dances away from the glass, afraid to enter the realm. Chocolate booze emanates. Delights. Entrances. I am a captive. Some roast beckons below. The nose, however, deceives the tongue. A light creamy chocolate with no more giant alcohol molecules to back up the flavor. A bit rusty, slight metallic twinge to it. Damn, the taste is disappointing. I've had before and liked much more, but this review will reflect real life. Not memories. (year old bottle)  betting fresh is better 4.5-4.5-2.5-2.5-2.5  Update: 4/20/11 The last statement has been rendered foolish by the events of the day. 1997 BCS at the Blind Tiger event. Totally ridiculous. Black, very low carb, but next to none on the oxidation. Chocolate and roast aromas seductively lure me in. The flavor is smooth, only a touch sweet, and an absolute achievement in an aged imperial stout.

Taste, a chocolate one trick pony, but seems to be more about the chocolate malt than any candy type of chocolate to it. Kind of a dry ending to it. It was definitely a good beer, but really nothing about it sets it apart, or allows for its inclusion in a top 10 (maybe even 20) imperial stout discussion.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Dark fruits are very apparent with dark chocolate.  Taste begins with dark fruit; moves into a dark chocolate and finishes quite boozy. Feel the warmth in the chestI can see this mellowing if cellared.  Mouthfeel is somewhat thick.  Due to the hight ABV this is certainly not a session brew and drinkability is having one of these every now and then.  11-1-2-12 - Cellared this one for a year and must say could have cellared a bit longer. The alocohol is still very prevelant and must say it has a somewhat freshness to it. The appearance was dark brown almost black with a chocolate head ring which hung around. The nose is of milk chocolate and dark fruit, prunes possibly. The taste is like a chocolaty expresso mix and the mouthfeel is a medium. Overall this is a solid stout. Was interested to see if the alcohol would mellow after a year and it didn't. Have to cellar another for a longer period to see how it mellows.

The head was about 3 fingers off the tap, but the bartender let it go down some, then served it to me with a solid 1.5 fingers of thick dark brown head. It was almost like mousse atop the beer.  S - For a beer apparently brewed without chocolate, this beer smells like chocolate. Bittersweet, like a nice 85% cacao chocolate bar.  T - If you melted dark chocolate and put alcohol in it, this is what it would taste like, I think. I am a huge chocolate lover, especially the dark variety, so this was unreal. I spent about 45 minutes with this one tulip, enjoying every sip.  M - Perfect. Light carbonation that perfectly accented the flavor.  D - Yikes, I was feeling just one of these.

The smell is pretty blasting, and nicely full of malts, a bit of coffee and chocolate, but also covered in booze. The taste is the same way, with booze present start to finish despite its well-crafted chocolately-profile. Hops kick in it too, working with the dark chocolate to bitter the finish.  Drinkability isn't its strong suite, but its tasty enough to return to, and the mouthfeel is about how big Russian stouts should normally feel.

S: Plum and cherries, mild alcohol, a slight hint of coffee, and some cake-like chocolate. Maybe a hint of leafy herbal hops.  T: Dark fruit esters own the palate first with tastes of candied cherries and plums. After that, malt rules the roost. Great depth of malt flavors. Rich chocolate cake, fresh roasted coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa powder, faint smoke, and a slight woody/nuttiness. Maybe a faint tobacco-like herbal hop spiciness hidden within all this. Long finish of chocolate cake with a slight hint of smoke.  M: Medium bodied, creamy, and smooth.  D: Very drinkable, considering the style.  Notes: The breadth of malt flavors here is amazing. Great stuff. Maybe the best tasting RIS for the price and availability. This has been a regular in my ""cellar"" since my very early craft days. The extra time on this bottle brought out some acidity and alcohol that I don't remember being there when fresh. I also don't remember the leafy spiciness being there when fresh, but I haven't had a new bottle of this beer in a while. Age does add some extra dimension to this beer.

45,680,ElGallo,3.8,"12 oz. bottle poured into a balloon glass. Bottle was cellared since October '09.  Big fluffy mocha head on the pour. Looks like a nice dollap of chocolate mousse. Actually makes me want some Jell-O chocolate mousse. Remember when Bill Cosby did Jell-O ads? I miss that old bastard... and Jell-O pudding pops, but I digress...  Nose is very nice: lots of dark chocolate, roasted dark malts, espresso, and some bitter earthiness, like when you slide head first into second base and get a face full of dirt... and then the ump says, ""You're out!"" I know that feeling, I know that taste, and it is here, mildly.  Taste is of bitter roasted malts, some coffee, dark chocolate, figs, molasses, and unabashed awesomeness. Brazen, yes, but I like that - a beer that loves itself but cares nothing for you. Like an ex-girlfriend that verbally beats you down but does circus tricks in bed so you keep knocking on that door every Saturday night. It's okay, embrace it, savor it, and pour yourself another glass.  Mouthfeel is smooth and easy going. The roasted malt bitterness is strong in the taste but it doesn't linger in the mouth - very easy to give this one the Listerine swish.  Overall I liked this one a lot, though I'm not sure this makes my list of top-tier imperial stouts. The bitterness was a bit distracting at times. Also not sure if aging this for a year made much of a difference - kind of like waiting another year to ask a certain girl to prom, but she doesn't develop like you hoped.

I taste a slightly sour fruitiness with each sip ... or maybe it's the hops -- either way that doesn't work for me. Kind of bland. This beer leaves me unsatisfied.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,thagr81us,4.35,"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured pitch black with a minimal tan head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, brown sugar, and dark chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, sugar, caramel, and dark chocolate. It had a heavy feel on the palate with low-mild carbonation. Overall this was quite the excellent brew. There were no sharp intrusive flavors present at all which made this one very easy drinking. Had a very nicely well balanced flavor and good aroma as well. This one is a definite must try.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,gabedivision,4.28,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle to a Sam Adams snifter glass. Pours pitch black opaque swirls with a frothy brown head that stains all ends of the glass. The smell is amazing, smells like sweet roasted coca beans, with a hint of coffee. The taste is exceptional, dark milky feeling in the mouth. This beer screams drinkability, however, you can probably only have one or two or you will loose the ability to do anything else. This beer is fantastic from start to finish.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,SnowGoon99,4.42,"Serving type: bottle into a Stella Artois glass  Pours an opaque black with a dark tan head that's almost brown. Head doesn't last very long and there's no lacing down the glass. Aromas that come through are roastiness, chocolate, and dark rum. In a blind taste test you could've sworn it was a liquor.  Flavors that come through include roastiness with more of the dark rum but with more alcohol than the nose. Can definitely tell this is a big beer. Notes of toast, chocolate and espresso are also apparent. A lot of levels to this beer. Mouthfeel is awesome. Really couldn't have done any better. But due to all the flavors and the alcohol content this is definitely a sipping beer. Not very easily drinkable.  Overall this is an incredible beer. It just has so many layers in the nose and on the tongue that it's just awesome. Only criticisms would be the head retention and the drinkability factor. But both of those are negligible next to the flavor and aroma.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,spinrsx,4.3,"12oz Bottle  Appearance - The beer pours a syrupy opaque black/brown colour with a very large frothy light brown coloured head. I can't see much carbonation due the darkness of the beer and there is some very nice lacing running in stages down the sides of the glass. The head lasted for several minutes before it began to dissipate.  Smell - chocolate, malts, coffee, roasted/toasted notes, slightly metallic  Taste & Mouth - The beer has an average amount of carbonation and feels very creamy. Most of the taste consists of chocolate, coffee and malts. The alcohol is well hidden and there are also some light hops. The beer finishes with a bitter coffee aftertaste.  Drink - A delicious and flavourful chocolate beer that I am going to go buy some more of tomorrow. I like that fact that it isn't too over the top in the flavour department, leaving it highly drinkable. I'd like to have a few bottles cellared so I can taste it again with a few years on it.

Afterwards lacing slid down to join the rest of the beer and leave a nice thin ring on the beer as the drinking continued. Small islands of foam on top of the beer present after the head dissipated.  S: Lots of rich roasted malt with some burnt sugar, oak and figs lingering in the background. Slight alcohol aroma detected but not too potent.  T: Slightly sweet with deep rich malt and chocolate dominating the taste almost immediately. The finish is loaded with malt and a subtle bitterness.  M: Oily, full bodied, creamy almost velvety with a slight carbonation level felt.  D: Very tasty stout but would not want too many of these in a night. A definite one to sip and savor.

45,680,anakar,3.88,"Look - Poured (terribly) out of a bottle it comes out a dark brown, kinda like chocolate with a big brown creamy head  Smell - Coffee, chocolate and yeast. All very strong and rich  Taste - Bitter, chocolaty, again coffee but also a bit of an alcoholic sting (it is a 10%). That sting got this one down from 4.5 to 4 in my book. Great and long aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Good but nothing more, goes down nicely and has very little carb.  Drink - Be careful, it's 10% and it's very heavy, you might just lose your wits and do something stupid",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,grover37,3.84,"A 12oz bottle each of the 08-09, 09-10, and 10-11 vintages. Poured into large snifters.  Appearance (3): Black with dark brown around the edges. About a finger and a half of head on each of them except the '10 strangely. Must have been the pour. The cream colored head reduces to just a ring around the outside and a patch in the middle. No lacing.  Aroma (4): The '10 is solvent and roasty. The '09 is chocolatey and still boozy sweet. The '08 is very chocolatey and mocha. Most of the booziness has faded away fortunately.  Taste (4.5): The '10 is a very intense charred chocolate and almost oaky flavor. The piney and earthy hop flavor is very strong in the finish as well, although not terribly bitter. Very intense flavors as I've come to expect. The '09 is much less solvent and creamy with strong chocolate and mocha coffee flavors. A vanilla or oak flavor lingers a bit and there is a still a little bit of the pine hops in the finish. The '08 is even more smooth and creamy with the chocolate taking center stage with a bit of a burnt, roasted edge to it. Surprisingly, a lot of that pine flavor still sticks around. There's some strong vanilla notes here without the oakiness. Great, full flavors all around but especially the ones with some age on them which are less solvent and sweet, letting the abundance of dark malts shine.  Mouthfeel (4): Medium carbonation, which is a bit more than many in the style, and medium to full bodied. Sweet but not cloying. Usually very harsh and astringent, but the vintage versions are creamy and smooth as they progress.  Drinkability (2.5): Definitely a sipper. I wouldn't recommend drinking more than two of these. Not to mention it's pretty sweet and boozy fresh. You wouldn't know the older vintages were 10% though.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,VinnieVanGogh,3.87,"Pours black, and completely opaque, with a slight dark tan head. A little coffee and a little more chocolate in the nose. Taste is a cross between dark and bittersweet chocolate with a malty bloom, and a clingy, quite pleasantly bitter finish. I thought that considering the ABV, the alcohol was pretty well hidden. (...but not completely, although this did not bother me in the least.)  I really dig this, but I could probably only drink 2 or 3 at a time.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S- Cocoa, dark chocolate coffee, caramels, malty, hints of hazelnut and a whiff of booze.  T- Slight burn of booze, but pleasant. Strong, bold malty flavors like a RIS should be. Nothing overpowering. Nice balance of dark chocolates, caramels, and coffee. Hints of nutty flavors.  M- Thick and creamy with a slight boozy burn. Very smooth and balanced. Can't stop drinking.  D- Slight booze burn might turn off some, but I can't slow down. Creamy, chocolately flavors make me want to keep sipping. It is a definite sipper. Rich and bold. A definite after dinner dessert beer, but not overly sweet or cloying.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Chadpaq,4.4,"Bottled 2010. Poured into Crate&Barrel tulip (Oh yeah!)  As I crack it, I'm standing about two feet above the neck of the bottle and I instantly smell tinges of alcohol wafting from the top of it. Mmmm....  Dark as night. Terrible simile. I don't care. Hardly any head, but what's there retains its small splendor.  Coffee, chocolate, malty as hell, and mild alcohol as I really get the nostrils in there.  This stuff is THICK.  WOW. Oh man. I bet this stuff would be splendidly smooth with a little age on it. As it stands, this is as fresh of a bottle as one can get. But it's still spectacular. Premium dark chocolate mixed with a tinge of hazelnuts and finished with some warming dark liquer. I feel as though I'm drinking royalty.  The beer itself looks so elegant residing in my tulip, I almost don't want to drink another sip. But after each, the resounding chocolatey aftertaste implores me to do so.  I'm trying to drink this stuff slow to explore the complexities of it as it warms, but it's so hard to take my time. This really is what an RIS should be, in my opinion. It's not overly-heavy, adding to its drinkability...and its lack of intimidation. But it's so extravagant on top of that. I really do love this beer.  I'm glad that I only have this twelve-ouncer here in front of me. I'm not even halfway through, and I feel myself slowing down. This is no slight to the taste; it's just heavier than I expected, and hitting me with a great deal of oomph. But keep the abuse coming, BBCS. I love it when you tie me up and talk dirty to me. Is that the alcohol talking? At ten percent, it just might be...  This is the ""Everyman's Russian Imperial Stout."" Prior to this relatively inexpensive brew, I didn't know if such a beer existed. This baby has proven me wrong, and changed my opinions of all that it is to be an RIS. If you don't have this beer readily available in your area, seek it out! You must have a taste of this glorious stuff.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Bunkles,3.92,"10-11 vintage, bottle poured into a pint glass.  The bottle pours pitch black with little head. A fairly aggressive pour coaxes out a tan, two finger head which receded quickly and left very little head. The beer gives off a large boozy smell, with definite notes of chocolate and a fainter toasty coffee smell. Some boozy heat comes through immediately upon taste, followed by a mellow chocolate and roasted malts. The beer sits well on the tongue, keeping that faint alcoholic heat at the back of the throat and chocolate sitting on the tongue. It drinks fairly well, though it's high alcohol content definitely is a limiting factor.  Overall a nice beer, though a bit disappointing. It tastes a little boozier and less flavorful than I remember last year's being. Still though, at around $8 a four pack, it remains a nice value for the RIS style.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

There is no light getting through this one. A small medium brown head formed during the pour, spreading to a thin light caramel color ring around the inside of the glass.  S: This has an immediate boozy aroma, followed by dark bitter chocolate/expresso scent. This is one great smelling RIS.  T: It does taste like it smells, dark bitter chocolate, roasted expresso coffee, with a hint of caramel.  M: Very creamy, lightly sweet backbone, light carbonation. Truly fantastic RIS from start to finish.  D: I could have one or two of these every night. Certainly not a session beer but one to truly enjoy by sipping every so slowly. There is no hiding the alcohol, but Brooklyn does a great job by attacking the palate from all angles to make you forget, even if for a brief moment, that you're drinking a bold full-bodied RIS.

Some alcohol is also noticeable.  The taste is big on roasted malts. Hints of bitter chocolate and dark roast coffee are also present. Some bitter hops appear on the back end. This beer perfectly accents any dessert containing chocolate...cake, cookies, cheesecake, whatever.  Mouth feel is smooth and velvety. Thick bodied and light carbonation.  Drinkability is relatively high given the 10% ABV. It is a great sipping beer on a cold night and pairs well with many desserts.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,StoneTSR,3.77,"Live Review #2. Still from Timmy O'Tooles on Ontario and Fairbanks in Chicago, IL.  APPEARANCE: Deep black with a very thin off-white head resting on top. Interesting lacing, a ring around the top was left where the initial head was and then very little remained stuck to the glass below that.  SMELL: Smells very smoky with a hint of coffee. Surprisingly, I don't smell much chocolate.  TASTE: The smokiness is almost non-existant in the taste - just a hint. The chocolate, however, does arrive with the first sip and is the highlight of this beer, although it is a bitter, dark chocolate-like flavor. A smoky flavor returns with for the aftertaste, which seems to be much more full and complex than the actual taste.  FEEL: Smooth and mouthcoating like a good stout should be. Warms as it goes down, there is certainly some alcohal in the Chocolate Stout.  OVERALL: A very nice, easy to drink stout. I tend to like a little smoke flavor in my stouts, but not to have it overpower the beer, and this one delivered on that front. I don't often drink stouts, but when I do, I will consider this one again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

A. Dark black. Transmits absolutely no light. Small, ¼ inch molasses head dissipates quickly. Insignificant lacing.  S. Sweet, chocolate, grape, cinnamon. Obvious alcohol presence.  T. Attack is heavy on alcohol. Potential chocolate gives way to strong, bitter coffee notes. Minimal sweetness. (Similar to Siberian Night.) Alcohol is obviously present, but mellows as it warms.  M. Smooth, creamy, gives way to carbonated feel that tingles on the tongue with the bitterness of the coffee. Lingers. As it warms, becomes more buttery in mouthfeel.  D. A definite sipper.

S: dark chocolate, some dark fruit notes  T: wet plums, mixture of dark and milk chocolates, no heat (huge difference from fresh BCS). Complex tastes, in addition I get plums, almost like chocolate covered cherries and lots of different chocolate flavor notes, a hint of coffee pokes through.  M: full and creamy, not quite world class for RIS, but nice  D: nice, not ridiculously drinkable (would't necessarily want it to be at 10% abv), but had not trouble finishing my 12oz",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Slight, mocha-colored head when poured which quickly disappeared.  S: Bitter chocolate, coffee, and some sweetness.  T: Rich chocolate and espresso. Bitter up front, then sweentess, then leaves a nice, lingering coffee feel in the mouth. The malts come through towards the end, as does the alcohol, but all is trumped by the coffee/chocolate.  M: Low carbonation, long finish with the chocolate and espresso mostly masking the alcohol.

45,680,nhindian,3.97,"12oz bottle poured into a Stone IRS snifter.  What better way to warm up on a not-so-cold Winter day while watching the Steelers!  A - Pours an absolute pitch black with a huge, 3.5-fingered, frothy, rocky dark tan with excellent retention. Lacing is insane as well, as it completely coats the glass and leaves intricate webbing all throughout. A truly beautiful looking beer.  S - The smell is of strong, bittersweet chocolate and freshly roasted espresso. Sweet smelling yet easy to notice this is a strong beer. As it warms up and it is swirled and inhaled deeply, there is a surprisingly alcoholic smell to it, almost fusel in characteristic and similar to rubbing alcohol. It's faint, but certainly noticeable.  T - The taste of this beer is bold and powerful with the roasted malts leading the way. It's bitter chocolate is a motif that lasts throughout the beer, which is nice as it's a great flavor. Hints of espresso roast are more mild here than in the nose, but add an additional complex layer beneath the chocolate. Thankfully, it has a bit of a hoppy finish which helps diminish the alcohol which was so noticeable in the smell.  M - Mouthfeel is heavy with low carbonation. It's not syrupy but it does coat the mouth and impart a very long, sweet yet bitter finish. The alcohol heat is more felt than tasted in the throat long after the beer is swallowed.  D - Drinkability is moderately high. While I was a bit worried about this beer after the overly alcoholic nose, the flavors are strong, complex, and enjoyable enough to help defer the alcohol in the taste.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,smcolw,4.02,"Near black color where only the faintest of light can pass on the edge. Leaves a moderate head and minimal webby lace.  Not a harsh smell, much closer to a dark chocolate. As an aroma, it seems more like a porter.  Rich bodied with decent carbonation. This beer is full flavored with darker dry malts, unsweetened chocolate, faint bitter hop. I don't taste any alcohol warmth. Great aftertaste that begs for black forest cake with sour cherries.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DrinkingDrake,4.04,Pours pitch black with a very creamy tan head. Dissipated pretty quickly and left almost nothing on top.  Smells of dark chocolate and coffee. the 10%ABV is apparent.  A very smooth drink. The chocolate and alcohol dominate that taste without being overbearing. It finishes nicely without a real bitter chocolate taste you get from some chocolate stouts.  For being 10% and the alcohol being a major part of the aroma this drank fairly quickly and easily. Straight up solid chocolate stout.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,IPA4LIFE,3.86,"A- This beer is very dark. It is pitch black unless held right up against light, and even then it is only a very dark molasses color at the edges. Very small brown head comes with and aggressive pour, but it is a half inch at max, and settles quickly. All in all, this looks just like a stout should.  S- Pretty strong chocolate smells (what a shock!) Also some coffee and maybe just a little burnt caramel. Alcohol is also present.  T-Dark, dark chocolate for sure. A little smokey, with more chocolate. A solid taste of alcohol, followed by more chocolate. The aftertaste is really interesting, making me feel like I just got done eating a high quality dark chocolate bar.  M- Low carbonation, slides right over the tongue. Nice.  D- Strong and heavy, this beer is only for certain occasions. I would not have more than one at a time, although I would enjoy one once every few weeks.  I like the fact that the chocolate is really strong and present, but not quite overpowering. There are just enough other flavors to keep the chocolate in check. I also enjoy the high ABV, which is covered by the extreme flavors. The aftertaste is very pleasant, leaving you wanting another sip.

Unique for a RIS aromas - takes on plenty of deep vinous, almost Belgian Strong Dark characteristics. Alcohol burn is apparent.  Fairly creamy up front on the palate. Flavors of dark chocolate, black licorice root, roasted coffee, and a nice level of hops create a lightly bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy - as expected for the style - but also carries a wine like finish that gives it a distinguished character.

As it warms it becomes more chocolaty, but the alcohol sweetness remains present.  M-Pretty thick.  D-The alcohol seemed to be more noticeable than in bottle form, which cut into its drinkability. For the style however it isn't that complex, which makes it easy drinking.  Overall, I prefer this beer in a bottle.

On top is a finger of brown foam.  The smell is a bit subdued. It's not overwhelmingly chocolate, but that scent is obviously there...similar to hot chocolate.  Wow, the taste is more in line with what you would expect as opposed to the subdued smell. The chocolate notes are sharper, though again not overwhelming.  The alcohol in the finish cuts into the chocolate flavor and gives a complex mouthfeel. It starts off slightly sweet before giving way to some bitter from both the chocolate and the hops. In the middle, you feel a creaminess before finishing with some bite and heat from the alcohol.  This goes down pretty easy. There is both a smoothness and a bite to it, so it should appeal to several types of drinkers.

S: Dark roasted coffee malt, dark chocolate, with just a little peat.  T: Peaty, roasted malt. Bittersweet chocolate. Not much else.  M: Hearty, robust body. Strong alcohol palette. Peaty aftertaste lingers long and hard. Not as dry a finish as you'd expect, given the alcohol.  D: Very good slow sipping brew.  Atmosphere is very good. Deep, dark, intimidating appearance.

Forms a bit of a light brown head that quickly gives way to some nice lacing.  Smell is pretty much what I expected, roasted malt coffee, and chocolate.  Tastes fairly close to what I expected, with one noticeable exception. There was a sweetness there I wasn't expecting, it's almost the candy sugar flavor I expect in a Belgian dark ale. There is chocolate and coffee as well, and a little burning at the end from the alcohol.  For pouring so thickly, the feel was a bit thin. Not bad, I just anticipated a bit more.  Considering the strength of this one, was fairly drinkable. While potent and not for the weak of heart, went down easier than other strong ones I have had.

S: Not much going on here until it gets almost to room temp. Once there, it starts to come alive a little. Chocolate, dark fruits. The alcohol is slightly present.  T: Same as with the nose, the taste really pops when it's been out of the bottle for about 45 minutes or so. Like the nose, chocolate, dark fruits, roasted tastes. Alcohol is there, but not in a distracting, burning way..more warming. Rich flavors. Pretty nice.  M: Smooth and a little thin, but not too bad. Dries the mouth a little more than I would expect.  D: Again, the alcohol is present, but in a good way. With that said, it still will slow you down a bit which is a good thing.

The aroma is great, roasted coffee, some chocolate and dark sweet fruits to round it out. Slight traces of alcohol, but that's going to be tough to hide in a ten percent beer anyhow. Really what I would want out of this flavor-wise. It's big with sweet bitter chocolate flavor mixing well with bitter espresso finishing with a bit of heat from the high ABV. It's not the most complex thing but in this case less is certainly more. The mouthfeel is full thick and chewy, good carbonation. Solid beer but I'd be hard pressed to have more than one.

T-Basic RIS flavor profile, but not as complex as others in this style. Alcohol is also present in the taste a bit more than normal, although very warming.

45,680,bagpiper2005,4.2,"Pour: This beer is so black you can't even see through it. Completely opaque. One finger of brown head that dissipated somewhat quickly and left minimal lacing on the glass.  Smell: Roasted malt with hints of coffee and chocolate. Some alcohol as well.  Taste: About like drinking melted dark chocolate - lots of bitter chocolate in the back. Some hints of coffee and roasted malt as well. Finishes with a fair amount of alcohol warmth and no hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly thin (read: more of a medium body) for the ABV. Moderately carbonated, creamy, and smooth.  Drinkability: Good for the ABV. A sipper but isn't taxing on the palate or hard to swallow.  Final Notes: A very good beer, and probably has the most chocolate flavor of any chocolate beer I've had. This would make one hell of a beer to pair against vanilla ice cream (hell, might even make a good beer float). Recommended.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Very nice.  t-bitter dark chocolate. It's like having chocolate with super high cocoa content. Coffee notes much more prevalent in the taste then the smell.

45,680,Johnnyfacelift,4.6,"This is one of my favorite stouts which is darker than the night sky. You can't see through this brew, even while holding it right up to a light! Not a huge head, but enough at the pour to get some great aromas.  I don't have the most developed sense of smell, but I definitely pick up the high alcohol profile. A big malt essence jumps out at me along with some nutty notes. Very enticing!  The smell and the taste go hand in hand for me. I pick up the alcohol, but it's not over powering. I don't pick up a huge chocolate flavor, but I think it comes through in the mouthfeel.  Nice and thick mouthfeel. You know your drinking a big bold stout with every sip. Coats your mouth with flavor, but does not linger... which I enjoy!  Of course with a big beer like this, ""session"" should be avoided! But saying that, it's such a tasty brew your glass becomes half empty faster than you'd like.  Overall a wonderful winter time warming stout. Highly recommended.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,codewarrior,4.25,"12oz from a 4-pack, poured into a tulip pint, label indicates the Winter 10-11 bottling.  Memories ... living in Brooklyn, you could find 4-packs and single bottles of this in just about every corner store. Every bar would have this on tap throughout the winter and you just sort of come to take it for granted. There is no other beer in my mind that is more representative of winter than Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. My fondest memory of this beer was at a Dinosaur Jr. show at Brooklyn bowl, when the barman poured my Black Chocolate Stout, and while giving me my change said: ""Be careful with that, it's 10%."" Anyway, enough about me ...  L: Jet black with perfect irish-cream head in droves ... at least 4-fingers on a somewhat aggressive pour. The look here is nearing Old Rasputin territory (... a very good sign to my eyes).  S: Smokey rich mealy malt-bomb-itude. Deep, deep nose with a lot of booze providing ample back-up.  T: Most striking is a thinness compared to the nose, but still great. Malt with crisp burnt-ness, fading into a booze-bomb which burns and lingers, and is quite welcome to do both.  F: Great carbonation, great feel, a touch thin, but just a touch.  D: Yes, please. Missing my corner store right about now.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Tifore,4.13,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter.  A - Pours from the bottle like a syrupy motor oil. Very very dark brown to basically black in color with a thick viscosity. A very small 1/2 finger head with a deep tan color develops and fades quickly leaving no lacing.  S - Very upfront smelling. Lots of chocolate and coffee right off the bat with some lingering carmel and roasted malts. Toffee notes as well. Smells robust and very thick tasting.  T - Tastes immediately of bittersweet chocolate and spent coffee rinds but quickly turns sweet with the carmel and toffee notes coming in. That lingers for a while and then you are left with a slight boozieness that is well accepted by me. Its not over the top, just lets you know its there in the back of your throat.  M - Very smooth on the tounge and full tasting. Pretty syrupy as well with a good amount of carbonation that holds up to the big flavors of the beer.  D - Very drinkable. I'm glad I have a few of these in the cellar and that its still for sale at my local bottle shop.

You're the boss!  I'm thinking stout... Dark. Nice and dark. Opaque. Creamy tan head of 2 fingers-- good retention. Solid retention. Minimal lace. 3.5/5  Smells roasty. Cocoa-- dark cocoa. A hint of coffee... A little black licorice... Some booziness... This must be an RIS... 4/5  Tastes good. Has enough flavor to enjoy it-- but not too overwhelming. The spicy licorice is jumping out more and more as this warms... The alcohol also becomes increasingly noticeable as the beer warms. Not bad, by any means, but not really the flavor profile I go for most often. 3.5/5  Feel is great. Full body. Low carbonation. A creamy feel with a slightly oily finish. Works pretty well. 4/5  I finished the glass pretty quickly for an RIS... The beer isn't bad, by any means-- I guess I'm just picky. Enjoyable, but forgettable. 4/5  ---reveals bottle to be Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout.  Ummmm... I've had this before. I remember being more impressed by it. I am unsure what vintage this is...

45,680,Thanby,4.33,"Pours black as tar with a little bit of dark brown head that reduces but hangs around and leaves nice lacing.  Wonderful dark roasted malt aroma, the dark chocolate really comes through but is offset by a malt bitterness, some cocoa, balanced very well.  The roasted malt dominates, of course, it has a very pure dark roast clarity to the flavor. The chocolate fills out the middle of the body, giving a little sweetness, but then the cocoa kicks in and bitters things up again for the finish.  Cocoa lingers in the aftertaste, created by the roasted quality, but the body finishes fairly clean. The ABV is a little apparent in the aftertaste, which is probably what washed the palate dry, but it's not estery or boozey like most 10% brews.  Absolutely wonderful brew, easy to drink for such potent characteristics, a little creamy but not too much, this is one of my favorite RIS's.  [Hooray for being the 2011'th review!

Dark Roasted malts with some chocolate coming through. A little caramel finds its way through as well.  Roasted malts are the first thing that hit the palate with semi sweet chocolate following right behind. a little bit of coffee bitterness closes it out combined with A nice little bit of warming from the high ABV but not off putting at all, it would be a great beef on a cold winter night.  Creamy and sticks with you for a bit. Medium to full bodied lightly carbonated. Again something i would crave on a cold winter night.  Drinks easy for a 10% abv beer but it does have some bite to let you know you are drinking a high ABV brew but not enough to deter from the drinkability.

T: Chocolate and roasted malts in the beginning give way to licorice and dark fruits on the finish with an aftertaste of coffee bitterness. Only the slightest hint of booziness. The chocolate really comes out as the beer warms. M: Very soft mouthfeel with only a slight bit of pickling from the carbonation. Very full beer that coats the mouth.  This is a very good beer.

The theme of this brew is black. BCS has the darkest malt I've ever come across. I wish the chocolate was a little more prominent, but not a bad job with the aroma.  T: The flavor is a little less complex then I'd like. There are a few chocolate tones that are dynamically playing against each other strength. Bitter dark to milk chocolate. I commend Brooklyn for brewing a RIS that is not hot with alcohol, or overly sweet.  MF: The mouth feel is creamy, full, and smooth.  D: Again, because this RIS doesn't suffer from the flaws that many do, this brew is pretty dam drinkable.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,r0nyn,4.18,"Poured from a growler into my DFH snifter. Assuming this is the Winter 10/11 release.  Pours the deep, inky blackness of good imperial stouts, completely opaque and darker than night. Very minute tan head that leaves some sticky, spotty lacing. A wonderful looking beer by all accounts. Smell is initially roasted malts, with a touch of sweet caramel and maybe just a slight tinge of alcohol. As you sniff it some more, the underlying dark chocolate becomes more evident, the aroma of cocoa mingling with the rest of the scents to provide an enticing smell.  Taste is just like the smell, with roasted malts kicking things off along with some very slight notes of caramel and vanilla. The dark chocolate then takes over, providing a taste that's full of bittersweet cocoa and some figgy fruity nuances. There's also a bit of coffee in the flavor as well, providing some of the mild bitterness; it's almost like an espresso taste, but not quite. As the brew warms, there's a slight bit of alcoholic heat at the end, but it's still pretty subdued. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, with minimal carbonation and a medium body. Finish is a bit less dry than I was expecting. Silky smooth sipping experience.  Drinkability is really rather good, especially for a Russian Imperial Stout. Oh yeah, you're gonna feel the 10% ABV, but it's a pleasant and tasty way there, so you're definitely not gonna mind the ride. I'd love to see what this is like with a few years on it to mellow the flavors out and add a few levels of sophistication.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Pours almost pitch black with a nice 1 finger mocha head on an aggressive pour. As the beer goes down, there is a little lacing. This is almost opaque black in the glass, with some light around the edges.  The smell is of roasted grains, and some bitter chocolate in the back. hints of some coffee and fruits as well. alcohol comes through a bit. its almost like a liqueur.  The taste is deep and rich, with massive roastiness, some heat from the 10% abv, and bitter-sweet, but not too sweet chocolate in the back of the throat. again, hints of chocolate and dark fruits. Also, some acidity throughout the whole thing and an odd but not off-putting ""zing"" to it.  Mouthfeel is a little on the prickly side, but that helps cleanse the palate. Certainly is viscous and sits in your mouth for a while being a little slick.  Drinkability is great; for one bottle. having a couple in an evening could easily knock you down. take on, take it slow, and sip it. It's delicious.  Notes: most of this beer was sampled alone, with the latter bit being accompanied by some chocolate cake for the sake of finding a solid pairing. Chocolate cake has been found to pair almost perfectly, highlighting the notes of the beer perfectly.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Deep roasted chocolate malts along with a plum-like aroma... No hint of booze... Faint aroma of some citrusy hops but they're just an afterthought...  Smooth creamy deliciousness here...

Taste: Roasted malt comes through strongest with breakthrough of chocolate flavors. Burn of alcohol in nose ad mouth as it goes down.  Mouthfeel: Great roasted malt flavor lingers. No chocolate and thankfully no alcohol presence remain.  Drinkability: Probably not my favorite stout, but for the price and the uniqueness of flavor it is definitely worth getting.

The chocolate was not as pronounced as I expected but did become more noticeable as the beer warmed up.  T - Roasted malts, chocolate. Hot.

Body is, essentially black though there is just a bit of red along the sides when held to a light.  The smell has a little burnt malt edginess, slight alcohol awareness and a touch of cocoa.  In the taste the chocolate/cocoa flavor makes itself known right away. Sweet, dark chocolate lingers on in the taste and finishes off with a light amount of burnt, roasted malt and coffee with just a dab of bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium tending toward full.  Except for the 10% ABV, there's nothing to detract from a good, high level of drinkability and enjoyment is high regardless of the alcohol level.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,StarshipPoopers,4.21,"A - Rich and opaque black with a creamy tan head. A moderately hard pour produced about a finger's worth of head. Retention dies down to a ring, but hangs around for several minutes before that.  S - Nothing out of the ordinary. Dark chocolate, a bit of freshness from hops. Smells fairly subdued, has a less unique smell compared to a lot of other stouts.  T - Taste is good with a nice amount of complexity. The backbone seems to be a sweet milk chocolate, but it is complimented by notes of dark and bitter chocolate, very faint traces of roasted coffee, and hops that present a fair amount of bitterness and bite. The alcohol is also notable as it warms up, never overpowering or stealing the attention away from the other flavours but certainly asserting itself. Good flavour.  M/D - Body is a bit lighter than I expected, still has some weight to it though. Drinkability is fantastic, a very enjoyable drink from start to finish.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S: dark, sweet, bread-like malt, Germanic yeast funk, molasses, coffee and chocolate in the background, wisp of vanilla. I swear this smells just like a Dopplebock!  T: the funk flashes right up front, then a luxurious blackberry, cherry, plum, and malty sweetness hits, the middle starts with an alcohol burn, quickly followed by coffee, chocolate, molasses toasted oak, and licorice, the long finish features a lingering caramel sweetness, a smoked wood finish, and a gentle but persistent herbal and orange peel hop note. Smells like a Dopplebock, tastes like a great RIS should. The alcohol burn keeps this from getting a 5.  M: full-bodied, almost syrupy, moderate carbonation. Beware, this beer is a palate crusher!  D: There is so much that I love about this beer, but the alcohol taste is off-putting. The way it overwhelms the palate puts this beer in the realm of 2-hour sippers.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,SpdKilz,4.08,"A big thanks to Drazzamatazz who sent out this special beer. Cheers!  To preface, I do have last years at home (this beer is the current year). However, I found it fitting to drink this tonight so here goes!  Appearance - Pours into my Bell's Tulip with an utter dark chocolate (pun intended) color. Over two fingers of dark mocha head is achieved with a moderate pour, that dissipates at a moderate pace, leaving nice looking lacing.  Smell - Heavy bittersweet cocoa. To be honest, it reminds me somewhat of the aroma from SA Chocolate Bock. Roasted malts, coffee, and slight hops come through.  Taste - Similar to the nose, though honestly, more chocolate. This is much more chocolaty than I remember last year when I had it (I'll have to revisit it when I am home next week). Smokiness ensues the initial chocolate flavor, followed by slight bitter hops. Quite easy to drink if I say so myself.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, lower to moderate carbonation.  Drinkability - A bit sweeter than I remember. Great having it on this 40 degree Southern California night. But one and done. Granted, at 10% that isn't a bad thing...and on that note I taste almost no alcohol presence whatsoever (even with it being so young). A great Christmas beer.

45,680,StormKing47,4.07,"Enjoyed on tap at my local establishment, reviewed from my napkin notes since I refuse to carry my book around when I'm out just to hang out with friends, and away we go...  A- Pours a faint black bordering on dark brown. It already looks like its a little thin, but we'll hold judgement on that one for later. It's accompanied with a dark brown head that is full of a steady stream of bubbles, very appealing, but I have seen better looking stouts.  S- Right away I am greeted with the oh so familiar dark chocolate sweetness accompanied with a burnt malt background. The roastiness of the malts are very pleasant and with further warming I am picking up very faint hop smells that add a touch of citrus, reminiscent of a chocolate covered orange slice. Very enjoyable.  T- Damn, a smack of boozy alcohol right away and a great dark chocolate sweetness to cool the booze burn down. I am also picking up a fruity finish along with the sweetness from the hops that is very interesting and surprising from a big stout. Loving the chocolate finish the whole way through the sipping!  M- Extremely warming from the high abv and definitely coating. A bit chewy which is expected from this style and is very palatable. It's a thick, syrupy, chewy blend that I thoroughly enjoyed.  D- It's definitely able to be finished by yourself, but the abv is not hidden well and it could become annoying as it warms because the heat comes out more and more. The chocolatey delight saves this one and makes it very pleasant.  A nice seasonable brew to enjoy that is great for the cold weather and is readily available at most places.

Only a hint of the dark fruit from the nose. Wonderful chocolate finish. Warming alcohol taste left in the mouth.  M - Thick. coats the mouth and is a bit cloying. Boozy warmth is divine.

A: Pitch black, completely opaque, even when held to light. 1-finger dark tan frothy head that dissipated fairly quickly.  S: Chocolate, coffee, alcohol, lots of roasted malt, sweet dark candy.  T: Bittersweet chocolate and medium-dark roasted coffee dominate the flavors. There is a lot of dark roasted malts present, but nothing overly bitter. There is an essence of dark candied fruit that blend with the caramel/molasses sweetness. There is a little hop character in the background. All the flavors are well balanced. Alcohol is fairly noticeable throughout, though it comes through stronger in the finish. It isn't offensive at all. Finishes dry and a little boozy. This is complex and delicious.  M: Extremely viscous, motor oil like. Smooth and creamy with a thick body. Has a dry finish, boozy finish.  D: While I can't put this glass down, it is definitely a sipper. No problem here. Finishing a bottle isn't difficult despite the ABV, body, and boozy finish.  Overall this is one of the best stouts I've had. While it can be a little boozy, it actually blends in well with the complex flavor and adds a nice dry, warm finish. This is something I'll be looking for every winter.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JunkYardJake,4,"12oz bottle to tulip. Befitting jet black color with a thin brown head. Smell is earthy and roasty with some alcohol. Taste is intense. Dark roasted malts bring out fig and chicory flavors. Dark chocolate and a warm, boozy finish rounds out the palate. Velvety mouthfeel with a mild dryness. Fairly high drinkability for the abv. Very nice chocolate RIS overall and is certainly worth trying.  2/19/12 Edit: Just had a bottle from last years batch (fall 2010) that I cellared. I didn't do a side-by-side but this bottle seemed much improved over the fresh version. Time really brought out subtle dark fruit flavors and mellowed out the booze. Cellar worthy brew for sure.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mrnobody,4.25,"355 ml bottle poured into a Duvel tulip.  A: Pours pitch black with one finger of coffee coloured head; some lacing.  S: Smells of coffee, chocolate and alcohol.  T: Tastes pretty much exactly like it smells but it is very well balanced.  M: The mouthfeel is full and creamy.  D: The alcohol is reasonably well hidden so the drinkability is pretty good.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Chico1985,3.97,"2009 bottle, bought a case of these last year.  Pours black with a tan head that turns to a ring and cap quickly, but retains well as that leaving some nice lacing.  Nose is chocolate syrup, roasted malts, some alcohol and dark fruits.  Unsweetened chocolate is the main thing going on, caramel and roasted malts as well. Booze warms the throat on the finish but doesn't really feel hot. Some hop bitterness is there but the only hop flavor is slight grassy notes. The nice dark fruits in the scent doesn't really transfer to the taste unfortunately, and seem to fade in the scent too. Improves as it warms.  Good creamy mouthfeel, carbonation is medium-high. Still a bit boozy after a year but I don't mind.  Drinkability is decent, not sure I'd want more than one but one is definitely not a problem. This can't hang with the big hitters of the style, but this certainly is a great imperial stout for the value (I think the case was around $40.)",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Sam21,4.45,"2010-11 edition. 12oz bottle into snifter.  Appearance - Pours thick and as black as one can imagine. Brown head with good initial retention. Leaves a small collar, but nothing more. Great big legs on this beer and virtually no lacing. Looks like one hell of a stout.  Smell - Big malty nose. Surprisingly, the first thing I notice is dark fruit. Specifically, I'm picking up figs and dates. Also, some black licorice. Behind that is a lot of milky and bittersweet dark chocolate and some alcohol, which I expected. I am impressed with how well the 10% is masked. Roasted malts are also noticeable, but are more in the background behind the dark fruits and chocolate. Very prominent nose that leaps out of the glass, although I was expecting the chocolate and roasted malt to be more commanding.  Taste - Roasted malts hit first with the dark fruits taking up a supportive role. The sweetness from the fruits round out the bitterness of the malts. The finish is dry and full of roasted malt and delicious black chocolate bitterness. Alcohol is slightly noticeable early in the finish and doesn't let you forget that you are drinking a BIG beer. Long drawn-out finish with waves of velvety chocolate and an almost espresso-like bitterness that lingers on the back of the tongue long after each sip.  Mouthfeel - Medium-full bodied with a silky feel. The carbonation is perfect and the beer seems to glide across the mouth.  Drinkability - This is one big and complex stout with flavors and smells ranging from ripe dark fruits to freshly brewed espresso. The chocolate is definitely present in this beer, but does not beat you over the head with each sip. Instead, it plays a balancing role in the overall experience. All of these complexities and high ABV make this beer a great candidate for aging. I'm excited to see where this beer will go from here, especially as the alcohol mellows out. This is the ultimate winter beer that will warm you up on the coldest days.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,otto251068,3.11,"Included as an extra from a trade with drez77, thanks! Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Chimay goblet. ""Winter 09-10"" on the neck label, it looks like this is almost a year old.  Appearance: Pours an oily black, not much light getting through this one. A quarter inch of dark brown, dense head appears, then fades slowly. A nice dark brown blob of head is left with a ring hugging the glass. Nice head retention after the pour, no lacing.  Smell: Roasted malts is what hits me right away. A kind of funkiness to it as well, not a fan of that. Maybe it will change as it warms. Kind of confused on the aroma, I get a little cinnamon and dark chocolate. Okay, it has warmed and now there is a ton of dark chocolate, much better. Definite sweetness from the chocolate or alcohol. As it warms the alcohol really comes out.  Taste: The dark chocolate is the dominate flavor in front, an unsweetened dark chocolate. There is also black coffee, and with that comes some bitterness, it doesn't come close to balancing the chocolate though. Plenty of roasted malts here as well, with some burnt flavors lasting throughout the drink. Plenty of bold flavors in this one, with dark chocolate taking over. Alcohol comes out as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Huge body with a medium carbonation. The body has a sticky finish, almost chewy. I like the carbonation on this one. The bitterness from the burnt flavors lingers in the back of my throat a little more than I would like.  Overall: The alcohol comes out a little strong for me. This beer took me forever to finish, and it is a definite sipper. 12 oz is filling, and this stout would be a great substitute for dessert, but drinking two is out of the question.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smell - Oranges, Coffee, Sweet Malt, Whiskey, Kinder chocolate  Taste - Well balanced, tangy with dark rich coffee and chocolate flavors. Hints of rhubarb, banana, blackberry and raisin. Smooth, mild bitterness with some tangy malt in the after taste. Quite sweet and fruity with burnt overtones. Moderate alcohol presence.  Mouthfeel - Rich and creamy with crisp carbonation.  Drinkability - Good beer, love the coffee and chocolate over tones. Moderate weight, maybe 4 pints would be the limit. Really like it, would have more of this",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Justin23060,4.25,"Very dark brown head which disipates but clings. Little to no light gets through this (just a very slight red around the edge). Chocolate dominates smell. Taste is mostly smokey/roasty at first then chocolate and coffee. When drunk by itself alcohol is masked well. With food, however, alcohol becomes a bit much. Its bitterness is all from the roastiness but the sweetness is well balanced too. Mouthfeel is quite creamy. One is enough for me 'cause its pretty heavy.  As an aside... the bottle says Brooklyn Brewery, Utica, NY. That means its really contract brewed by Matt Brewing, the makers of Saranac...

Taste and mouthfeel is wet, very light bodied giving way to cigarettes and ashes. Alcohol is still present and not hidden giving way to some heat on the finish. If you put chocolate on the label, I should be able to taste/smell it first... so where is it? Also some carbonation in the palate.  Drinkability...

Nice sticky lacing with a minimal light brown cream colored head.  S: Wow, I get a large pop of chocolate on the nose of this tap version. Also notes of roasted malt, burnt coffee, and some slight earthy hops.  T: The chocolate just jumps out in the tap version, so much more so than the bottle. Roasted malt with darker flavors then come in with the burnt coffee, dark chocolate, some caramel and toffee sweetness and some bitter earthy woody hops. The alcohol is present, but blends with the nice bitter finish. Good beer, I like this better than bottle.  M: Full, creamy at first which turns bitter, alcoholic but welcomed, carbonation is perfect.  Overall I enjoyed this so much more from tap than bottle. Its less alcoholic and much smoother.

A deep & rich malt is first experienced followed by a some sweet chocolate and possibly some dark fruits. The scent of alcohol is pretty well hidden.  T- Super roasty. Rich coffee, molasses, roasty malts, and of course, chocolate. This one is pretty complex in flavor but seems to keep a decent balance between flavors. I expected a bit more of chocolate prominent tastes but it still makes for a tasty brew. Along with the bitterness on the end there seems to also be a bit of smokiness involved as well. After the great flavors dim, the powerful 10%ABV shows it's face.  M- This one covers the palate pretty well and makes for a pretty full feel. Moderate carbonation also contributes to the quality of the mouthfeel  D- The alcohol content is pretty well masked by the complexity of this brew which makes it dangerously drinkable.

Poured beautiful black in color, which no light can pass through even when back lit, and sat on top was a dark khaki head that stayed around for quite a while and left sheets of lace down the glass.  Smell - Hints of chocolate, deep malts, some booze...the nose on this tells me that the 10% is definitely going to be noticable...we'll see.  Taste - WOW! I think I've finally found my favorite stout! I can't believe that this is 10%...it is incredibly hidden that I don't notice it one bit. I would have to say I didn't think it was over 6%. This beer is incredible....taste dark roasted maltyness comes over the palate, with perfect coffee notes coming through, just enough hopes to finish the operation. The hops are not over whelming in this and I don't consider this bitter at all. What a wonderful balance for a stout!  Mouthfeel - Very creamy, carbonation is just enough...there doesn't need to be anymore. The beer is great when you get near the end of the glass and most of the carbonation has receded.  Drinkability - It is amazingly drinkable at 10%...dangerously so. I could have a few of these without any problem whatsoever. This is such a great winter brew for winding down a cold winter night. I will definitely be purchasing more of this for when those nights come around. This is the stout that I've been searching for and I'm glad I've found a stout that I like a lot.

A - Pours the expected midnight black, with a thin half-finger of mocha head that only sticks around for about 30 seconds before receding to a ring around the glass. No lacing to speak of.  S - Loads of dark chocolate and roastiness. Hints of tobacco and leather. Quite nice, making me want to keep my nose in the glass.  T - Like someone liquified a dark chocolate candy. Lots of roast, coffee, sweetness around the edges, and dark, dark chocolate. Some alcohol in the finish, but none of the earthiness that I had expected from a RIS. But overall very nice.  M - Silky at times, but too much carbonation. It feels a little harsh, almost acidic.  D - The flavors are nice, but the carbonation and high abv bring this aspect of the beer down a bit.

45,680,Bouleboubier,4.1,"This is a review for their 2010 edition. This might be the first beer that, year to year, I noticed changes in - in flavor and body.  Gotta drink this at damn near room temp. Finding this out with a lot of ('high gravity') brews.  Ranks among the blackest beers around. Often starts with a swell of foamy mocha head (if poured well) only to collapse under the weight. Can't recall significant lacing from any of the 174 bottles of this I've consumed. The blackness wins me over.  Heavy booze should be the first thing you detect. When warm, a stark and enticing blend of dark bitter roast - somewhat coffee-ish - and some thin molasses and black licorice waft noseward. A little tough to tell if some of the bitterness comes from the hops, but it's pleasant all the same.  The flavor is what you might expect and hope for from a well-crafted, workman-like RIS - this 2010 is not the best I remember. Much of what I described in the aroma hold at a similar moderate intensity in the taste, with the light yet rich molasses sweetness and, of course, ethyl coming to the fore. Wouldn't say there's true 'chocolate' notes in there, and that's something that seems to vary year to year.  Luckily, despite the dominating presence of alcohol, it never stings or burns (even in the finish) and the smooth and thinly velvety malt base helps balance it all out wonderfully. A digestif or special treat is the best way to enjoy this. Can't beat the price, either.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The nose smells: Semi-sweet and unexpectedly fruity... candied cherries and dark cooca... like dark chocolate cordial cherries. Also some lighter berry fruits, strawberry or raspberry, and a little boozy warmth.  The mouth says: Tastes pretty similar to the smell. Dark chocolate with a ton of fruity cherry and berry aspects, simultaneously dry and sweet, plus some pretty subtle alcohol pepper and heat. Feel is thick and resinous. The taste has a bit of sweetness but the feel is totally dry. A little bit of vanillin, charred malt, and coffee also are present.  Like chocolate cake soaked in cherry liquor.

45,680,shredsofautumn,4.4,"Appearance- This beer pours a color that would reflect that of an oil change being performed on a lawnmower that has not been used in 3 seasons. Deep black, the small 1 finger head on a gentle pour shows a deep mocha/cappuccino color. The head reduces quite rapidly to show off this black beauty in its full body and character.  Smell- Tons of Dark 85% cacao chocolate, Toffee, Espresso, The smell of opening a box of fresh raisins, Some Sherry, Quite a bit of Molasses.  Taste- Raisin & Chocolate start upon entering the mouth. Upon the ""Kentucky Chew"", I taste quite a large amount of Espresso & Molasses. The Finish is a bitter Leathery, Black coffee taste. The alcohol bite shows through and warms the esophagus, bringing with it a lasting table wine-esque warmth that seems to last and last.  Mouthfeel- Warm & Coating. Feels Maple Syrup- like in texture, yet goes down like water. Nothing bitter stays in the mouth, only its palette coating characteristics of Coffee & Chocolate.  Drinkability- A delicious meal in a glass. I could down several of these, but would wind up acting like a fool as a result. It's a beer of distinct character & body (russian imperial stout comes to mind, as this is what i would call it in every way), and is a beer to be savored fireside as you ward off the winter and work to stay warm until Spring comes.

45,680,TheBrewo,3.65,"We pour a syrupy brew that is the deepest brown in color, and entirely opaque. It maintains a one and a half finger light brown head. This dissipates down to leave a layer of foam right on top of the beer, with coloring in the center lighter than on the edges. Thick lacing appears down the sides as this occurs. Whiffs reveal heavy malt character intertwined with bittersweet dark chocolate. There is also the suggestion of dried cherries. The taste begins with a light malty flavor with hints of vanilla. This is swept away by leathery bitterness that could be lent from either the roasted or chocolate malts, or any hops added to balance out the complex grain bill. The flavors that dominate into the aftertaste are certainly lent from bitter chocolate and roasted grain. Through the end of the sip there is also the warming palpation of alcohol. The mouth is left dry, despite the creamy full body of the beer and lack of any strong carbonation. The drinkability is stifled a bit by the borderline offensive aftertaste and the high abv.  Overall, what we liked most about this beer was the rich and delicious creaminess of the mouthfeel coupled with the stark appearance and aromas. This brew delivers all of the flavors it promises and then some.

45,680,JizackFH,4.1,"A - This one pours a very dark brown color, and has a small dark tan head. Very dark beer, no light is able to pass through it. The head also left decent lacing on the side of the glass.  S - The smell is sweet and boozy. There are notes of chocolate, coffee and caramel. This beer smells pretty good.  T - Roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate up front. There is a good sweetness to it which is balanced by a good amount of roastiness. There is also some alcohol presence that is noticeable.  M - This has a rich and creamy mouthfeel. It has a full body, and good carbonation. It goes down smooth, and has a slight warming quality.  D - I think this is a really drinkable beer. It has a full body, but it seems to go down a lot easy than some stouts. It doesn't have the rough bitterness that I have experienced with some other stouts, and also it masks its alcohol content quite well. I will definitely pick more of this up",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,oregone,4.14,"A: Pours a very prodigious head of tan atop a deep brown/black body. Two fingers of head that really stick it out leaving residual up the side of the glass at least a half inch and in the glass until near the end. S: Smells like cocoa. Straight up. Like expected and as should be. Not hot chocolate, actual decent cocoa powder. Some malt, and distinguished heat. T: Baking chocolate. Bitter chocolate flavors that are right up my alley, but as the sole driving force of the beer lack complexity. A thoroughly satisfying taste experience, but not great. M: Carbonation (rare) is a bit much on this for a heavy stout. Great richness, but the crispness intrudes on the expected richness of a great stout. Very good, and very characterful though. D: Excellent drinkability. Could absolutely sip on a few of these in a night.  EDIT: WTF! This is 10%? Just bumped the drinkability to 5 for the fact that... well see above!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Not much carbonation evident, as you cannot see anything through this.  S: Really deep dark chocolate smell. Definitely a bitter dark chocolate and not so much of a milk chocolate. Get some trace aroma of alcohol but not large amounts.  T/M: Taste is right away of bitter chocolate that is very rich and smooth. Then get some alcohol on the back of the tongue, but not an overwhelming amount. Ends very nice and smooth with not apparent dryness.  D: Really like the flavors in this beer. Great robust style and chocolate notes here. I can see how this one would benefit from some age, but does not necessarily require it!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Transatlantic,4.43,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into snifter glass  A - Looks and pours about how burnt motor oil would pour. Thick, blacker than black, and with a thin tan head.  S - Right upfront, you are hit with a strong roasted coffee and dark black chocolate smell. Floral type hops kindly creep in through undertones.  T - Thick roasted coffee, a bar of dark chocolate slowly melting, and a splash of bourbon in a mug is the perfect summarized explanation for the taste. This is about all you need to know.  M - Very thick and very creamy full bodied beer. The taste sticks to you at a medium rate.  D - As a thick imperial stout, you'll have no problem sipping this guy down. If you're grabbing for another bottle, be careful is all I say.  Beautiful beer!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Nice pour, dark espresso undertones with a thick and rich half a fingers head.  Taste overall is immediately as the bottle states, Black Chocolate. Coffee/Mocha is there as well along with a slight hint of alcohol. Very traditional yet interesting Russian Imperial Stout.  Overall the complexity is there; bitter, roasty and medium/moderate mouthfeel. Terrific stout. Drinkability wise it's a great way to end the day.

T - Some sweet coco up front followed by some raisin notes with a touch of bitter chocolate. a little bit of a boozy taste evens it out.  M - Way too much carbonation. Takes away from the flavors.

45,680,MetalHopHead6,3.8,"Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is warming. delicious, and bubbly.  It poured black with no head, a milk chocolate ring, and no lace. The flavor had strong notes of dark chocolate and coffee up front with a dark fruit-flavored finish. As it settled and warmed, dark fruit flavor pushed to the front. The feel was bubbly, with a sting left on the tongue. It was not creamy or smooth.  BCS is a nice, if too highly-carbonated, cold weather beer; warming yet easy to drink with great dark fruit notes that overpower and exceed the chocolate first impression.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Aromas of dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malts. Great big flavor of dark, bitter chocolate. Some lesser flavors of the roasted malts and a bit of a coffee aftertaste. This beer is drinkable in regard to it's high abv isn't noticeable, but it isn't overly drinkable due to the big chocolate flavor.

45,680,Heritage02Rider,4.18,"Got me a growler of Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout at the advice of the local growler master. I asked how it compared to Southern Tier Chockolat. He was adamant that it was better. So off I went with my prize.  Once home, I pulled out my frozen pint glass and poured me a glass. First though, not real chocolaty. I was expecting something similar to STB, but this was different. So, while watching Auburn beat Bama, I figured I would review this mighty fine brew.  A - Black (as the name states) and opaque. Held closely to a light and it does not glow. Initial head is stouty type foam, almost dense enough to float, even from a growler.  Smell - Light odor of beer. Nothing indicating chocolate or stout. Nice and unobtrusive.  T - First sip definitely was indicative of the 10.6% ABV, but a couple more sips, it became unnoticeable. No bitter aftertaste you get from some high octane stouts or other high octane beers. I would say enjoyable for a high ABV beer.  M - It is not bitter, nor is it sweet. I would say a well blended stout. No bitter aftertaste. It is smooth with a low carbonation making it easy to drink.  D - Now, two down, I will easily be able to drink this down without effort. I may pay for it in the morning if I crush this growler, but hell, this is pretty good beer. I say, drink up!  I would say this is a very good beer and well worth the $9.99 growler price.

It is thick but unlike most chocolate stouts this gives you just the dark chocolate taste not the milk chocolate.  Heavy, just like an imperial stout should be.

S - strong, robust dark chocolate malts, roasty, toasty, and soul-warming. hints of dark chocolate, stale coffee, and some faint dark fruits....raisins and figs.

M - medium, just slightly slick body gets cut into by some sharp and pinchy carbonation. pretty dry through the finish, with a very minor alcohol burn (especially considering the high ABV). light bitterness and chocolately sweetness through the finish.  D - very well executed beer, especially at the price point and availability. though there are beer ones on the eyes, nose, and mouth out there, this is solid all around. dangerously drinkable for the high ABV. once had this at a beer dinner hosted by the infamous Garrett Oliver himself, served alongside a Strawberry Rhubarb crumble, and it was as devine as it sounds.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,elgiacomo,4.1,"12oz bottle, 2009 vintage. Reviewed Nov 27, 2010.  Pours black with a one finger brown head that leaves a nice network of intricate lacing and holds a small cap.  Aroma is chocolate, milk chocolate, coffee, roasted malts. Mostly chocolate. Very little dark fruit unlike the '08 bottle I had the other night. Moderate strength.  Flavor is rich chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, some dark fruits such as figs, plums, and a bit of cherries, very little alcohol, a year of age worked well in this department as it is not often one will enjoy a 10% ABV brew with little to no noticeable alcohol taste.  Mouthfeel is medium to full, creamy and rich, medium carbonation.  Oh man, so much better than the '08. Dunno if I had a bad bottle or what but this is fantastic stuff. Gets an extra bump in drinkability due to being a good value in the Imperial Stout category. Will be reviewing a fresh '10 soon.

Poured a dark almost syrup consistency - Reminds you of the motor in a lawn mower that hasn't had it's oil changed for a couple of years . Nice two finger head that dissipated quickly leaving behind a thick foamy tan lace .  Smell - I didn't get much - some burnt coffee hints with maybe a little chocolate  Taste - This is where the stout made up for the smell - Coffee was almost immediate ,hints of burnt malts , the chocolate was evident in the aftertaste.  Drinkability -very well blended and balanced, it's high abv% is hidden well in the flavor - Extremely drinkable - recommended as a desert stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,WestValleyIPA,4.37,"Thanks to Tieman for sharing this with me. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my Chimay goblet. Black/cherry cola hybrid color. Very small amount of head from my small pour. Maybe a half finger that died almost immediately. A lot of toasty coffee on the nose. Light hints of chocolate and some sweet malt. On the mouth, insanely roasty toasty bitter coffee. Dry. Some dark chocolate flavors. Warming alcohol. Some near sour aspects due to the dark chocolate flavors. Mouth drying chalky mouthfeel. Pretty damn drinkable for 10 %. My 1st experience with Brooklyn (other than Hopfenweiss), I'm impressed.  Edit: After further warming, a lot of licorice coming through on the palate.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,waterintobeer,3.84,"This beer shows very well. Very dark black with slight hints of crimson along the edges of the snifter. Very little head but what little is there, is a dark tan. There is a little lacing on the side of the glass, more reminiscent of a scotch than a beer. The smell is of mocha, roasty malts and a spicy hop flavor. My complaint is that there is way too much alcohol smell. The taste is better than the smell with more bitter chocolate flavor being more pronounced and less of an alcohol taste, but it is absolutely still present. It reminds me of a 70% coca bar dunked into some hard alcohol. There is some malt characteristics but i find them to be pretty subdued. The mouth-feel is pretty good. There is a fair amount of carbonation and the beer finished pretty dry. All in all this beer is weighing in at 10 abv so some alcohol is expected to be present but the current recipe doesn't do well in covering it. I think that this stout would be much more enjoyable if the alcohol were dropped a few points or if more effort were put into covering it up.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jbertsch,4.67,"Hadn't had this one in a while and forgot how fantastic it is.  Not sure I've had a better, pure-dessert chocolate stout than this.  Pours pitch blac and looks like motor oil at first. I thought I wouldn't get much fo a head so I poured more vigor, and voila - a huge tan head.  Aromas scream chocolcate of high quality. Molasses and cream are also noticed. The taste matches the aroma with added coffee and an overlying roastiness that just gives you the impression all the ingreidients are singing together as one. Teh alcohol is masked very well. But it doesn't provide some warmth.  Drinkabtility? I couldn't put it down... Mouthfeel was silky smooth.  This was my dessert after a steak dinner, and it was perfect. I look forward ot my next one!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,yeahnatenelson,3.67,"Anno 2010.  Appearance -- Pours a ruddy dark brown, incredibly dark in the galss, with a slim sudsy tan head.  Smell -- Dark chocolate, cafe mocha, burnt breadcrusts, dark dried fruits, faint woodsmoke. Alcohol is a bit sharp on the nose. Overall, a rich, dark, proper RIS.  Taste -- Very rich and roasty with dark chocolate, coffee with cream, molasses, anise, licorice, dark fruity tang, and woodsmoke. Finish is burnt breadcrust, black coffee, and dark chocolate. The alcohol is a bit strong, though not the worst I've had. That said, it was just enough to be distracting.  Mouthfeel -- Full-bodied, velvety, with moderate prickly carb. Good deal of alcohol warming.  Drinkability -- This stout is quite good. Not at all cloying as the name would suggest, but actually quite balanced with plenty of acrid malt roastiness. However, the booziness is a bit distracting. Had the beer possessed more depth of flavor and nuance it would have been more forgivable. I wish I had a bottle with three or four years on it, as I'd imagine it would be positively decadent.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Dreadnaught33,4.3,"A beer I've known and loved for years, heres my take on it. Poured a Winter 10-11 bottle into a snifter.  A: Black Body with a great pinky of mocha colored head that settles slowly to a nice ring with swirls of tan bubbles in the center. Leaves some lacing. Very good look.  S: Tons of barley roastyness mix with dark/milk chocolate that is sweet and savory almost like a mousse of sorts.  T: Roast mingles with a dark chocolate bar with notes of molasses flavors prominent as well. Nice roast to finish that lingers. A little alcohol warmth up front with a definite lactose presence throughout as well. Solid.  M: Creamy and very milk-like IMO, maybe because of the lactose flavors I'm getting. Nice carbonation, Medium feel.  D: You might never guess it was 10% until you stand up! Very solid stout overall and amazing that it's so widely available and distributed. Another stout like Old Rasputin that is great but gets looked over because it's not hyped up like one off releases are. Awesome beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,AgentMunky,3.95,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a wine glass. Winter 09-10. Best before October 2012.  A: A thin but heavy head is a dark tan -- almost orangeish -- eventually breaking into a marvellous pattern of tracing across the surface. Heavy lacing. The body of the beer is a dark unknown -- an indeterminable black-brown completely unwilling to suffer observation or the impudent imposition of the smallest amount of light.  S: Alcohol. Coffee. A harsh bitterness. After ages, milk chocolate. Mellow malts. A strong, in-your-face smell. Deep, complex, and rewarding.  T: A tad fierce and overwhelming. Even after a year, this beer tastes unaged and untamed. A rough alcoholic beginning has an almost sour coffee-bitterness that puts me off, before mellowing into a robust and uncompromising imperial stout. The aftertaste is coffee-grounds bitter, with an almost milky, alcoholic sweetness ghosting the edges. Interesting, but not my favourite.  M: Something akin to carbonation comes from somewhere, and a smoothness coats my cheeks. The chocolate nature of this stout is most obvious here.  D: A bit too strong -- in character and ABV -- to be drinkable, but not to be disparaged. I was craving an imperial stout, and I got one. There are, in my mind, much better examples to choose from, but the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is not disrecommended.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Greywulfken,4.35,"I've bought this the past three(?) years, so I'm amending my previous review to keep it on the real...  A: pitch black, baby. C'mon, you know you can't see through it. As expected, oil black, dark tan head of foam; thin froth lid remains for a while, as do the lacings along the sides of the glass (a tulip)  S: massive chocolate wave, sweet black coffee notes, blackstrap molasses and marshmallow  T: all the chocolate, coffee, and molasses from the nose; bittersweet, notes of dry cocoa, dark roasty malt, and pinpoints of anise  M: bold, oscillates between dry and sweet; some stickiness, full-medium bodied, subdued carbonation; creamy milk smooth  D: you can drink this without getting sloppy - the richness of the brew will naturally curb your speed - enjoy: trust the beer to work with you. It isn't a contest. The journey, not the end. The journey, not the end.  Gotta respect Brooklyn Brewery - this brew is a staple winter stout, and is among the best. Has a sharper, more potent palate presentation than some other Russian Imperials I've had. Less subdued than say, an Old Rasputin, approaches the sweetness of a Bourbon County coffee stout (sans the bourbon, 'natch).  Brooklyn in the house.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,SolomonGrundy,3.96,"Another stout today, so awesome! Pours inky dark black, a small finger of dark tan head dissipates into a tiny rim of foam, not much lacing. Aromas are alternately sweet, then dry. Lots of dark chocolate notes as would be expected. Some hints of spiciness is in there, too. Maybe clove and licorice. Not super exciting so far, but good. Flavor is very unique. Super robust, very tangy right upfront. Lots of sweet chocolate malt, roasty roast-o goodness provides a sharp tang. This melds into a middle that strikes me as sweet, but only for an instant. This rides a nice long wave into what appears to be Hershey's Hot Cocoa mix. Mouth is wonderfully creamy and velvety. Finish is also super long and breaks into some hoppy hop bitterness and some of the cocoa notes. Great, complex and unique flavors roll around in this and the 10%ABV is wonderfully masked. Probably expensive, but this was a trade so I have no idea. I'll assume middle range price. Not sure you could sit through more than two of these as it is such a rich brew, but I would try on Turkey Day while watching football. I'll bet this tastes awesome with pecan pie, or even pumpkin pie/cheescake.  What I Like most: The beautiful, unique and complex flavor profile.  What I like least: The average pour and appearance.  Verdict: Awesome, robust unique ale. Must find if you can.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DoktorZee,4.5,"Drunk out of a smaller glass since (less than a pint), and due to the fact it was at a beer-tasting event I didn't check the bottle for a best-before date.  A - pitch black with tan colored head; stays around for a while and provides some moderate lacing. No light passes though this delightful beer.  S - smokey and chocolate nose with some definite malt notes.  T - extremely well balanced and rounded; while you'd expect some severe bitterness it certainly is intense, but it's not bitter or really wrong in any way. The significant alcohol is managed well, and it provides only a slight warmth. Solid chocolate notes througout, and some smokey/peaty overtones. [On retasting a year later I would note a larger presence of dark, tangy fruit in the midpalate carrying through the finish - just sticks at the back of the throat!]  M - mild carbonation gives this a heavy but not overpowering mouthfeel. It's solid, but not too heavy.  D - shockingly drinkable for a 10% powerbomb; you could easily put a few of these back in the course of an evening  Overall this is an exceptional beer: [bitter up front] and intense smokey/chocolate combined with an enduring malty aftertaste. Well rounded and just plain awesome.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

T - Almost the same as the nose but with a slight earthy, hickory sensation. Ends with a nice Arabian coffee taste.  M - A good balance of malty body and carbonation. Although it is somewhat thin for an imperial stout.  D - When I think of an imperial stout, I think if this beer. For some reason, I didn't expect a taste like this.

45,680,BuxMontBeerLover,4.4,"Purchased at Wegman's in Warrington, Pennsylvania Purchase Price - $8.99/4pk Served in a Dogfish Head Signature Glass  A - Dark, opaque (almost black) color. Very little head but a nice, brownish, cream colored ring around the edge. Nice lacing left on glass on the glass as I drink it down.  S - First aroma is that of coffee. The alcohol is also very noticable right after pouring. As it warms up, the other flavors (malts, chocolate) begin to make an apperance.  T - Nice combination of coffee, molasses, and a smokey (burnt malts?) taste. The chocolate taste is noticable but not as much as I would have expected from the name. Alcohol is right up front during the first sips. After it warms up, the alcohol is noticeable although not as much.  M - Nice amount of carbonation. Not overly heavy but since it is a stout, a naturally thicker feel on the tongue.  D - This is a really good stout. Not a session beer by any means but a beer to be enjoyed slowly. I tastes even better as I let it warm up.  Overall - A hit with me. IPA's are still my favorite but a nice, dark stout is always a good thing to offset that hoppiness that I enjoy. This is a well balanced beer that I will be purchasing again. A pleasant surprise since I purchased it without reading any of the previous BA reviews.  Cheers!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JToad,4.28,"Had this on tap at Bar Louie last night. One of my favs, I just finally got around to reviewing this.  Came to the bar in a tall thin glass, pitch black with a minimal milk chocolate colored head. Instant roasted coffee aroma.  Tastes of roasted coffee beans, tobacco and an slight hint of chocolate on the finish. Moutfeel is full and creamy, yet with some nice carbonation. Sticky sweet on the tongue. The tobacco becomes more present as the beer warms.  Simply delicious. I look forward to this every year. The alcohol warms your insides as you make your way thru this monster. Very complex and well balanced, one of my favorite stouts of all time.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,scelesti,4.33,"Pour from bottle into a wine glass.  A - Deep black, with maybe a little bit of brown. This is about as dark as beer gets! Very little head.  S - Rich cocoa aroma, mixed with clean maltiness. I'm picking up on a bit of the alcohol as well.  T - Chocolate, coffee, and toffee notes. There's some warming from the alcohol as it goes down, not surprising for the ABV. Very well balanced and smooth. Very little roasty bitterness.  M - Creamy, silky mouthfeel, with noticeable carbonation.  D - Way too drinkable for the ABV!  This brew is everything I expected and more. I'll be tucking a couple of these away to revisit in a few months to see how it ages. Perfect for a cold winter's evening next to the fire!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,cetherid,4.32,poured into a pint glass.  A.  very dark. basically black. a little bit of brown head that dissipates rather quickly.  S.  smells awesome. Nice sweet chocolate...a little roastiness and a touch of coffee. Perhaps a little dark fruit in there. Like chocolate covered raisins.  T.  great as well. sweet chocolate with a touch of molasses and coffee. a little boozy and bitterness in there as well.  M.  medium to full bodied. perfect carbonation. A little bitter/dry finish in there. perhaps a little alcohol burn in there but nothing too bad.  D.  fairly high. great tasting but the booziness might be a little too much to have a couple of these. Plus it being a seasonal beer you better stock up. Be a great sipping beer when the weather gets cold here.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,zoso1967,3.9,"Pours dark as night with a mocha colored head. This beer is just about as black as they come. The head fades quickly and leaves just spots of lace.  The aroma is quite sweet with plenty of fruity notes. There is a definite alcohol component that goes along with rich cocoa and some coffee. I am quite surprised at how malt forward this aroma is, with sweet raisin and dark cherry notes trumping the chocolaty and roasty ones.  The flavor has a wonderful balance between all the flavor components. Sweet caramel and dark fruit hit the palate first. Then rich dark chocolate and some vanilla. As I swallow the flavor transforms to reveal dark roasty malts and some juicy hop character. There is much less alcoholic warmth in the flavor, but it is definitely still present.  The mouthfeel is on the full side of medium, and it has a pretty spiky carbonation to it. The beer finishes much drier than I had expected and leaves a good amount of bitter roasted malt and hops flavors on my tongue.  This is a sipper of a stout and a pretty nice one at that. I let it warm quite a bit to see what other flavors it might bring out, but it pretty much tasted the same. This would be much better if it did not show the ABV so easily, but it is still one of Brooklyn's better offerings.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,CaptDavyJones,4.7,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with ABV on the bottle. Poured pitch black, with a nice tan/coffee head. Head retention is not very good, but should be expected from brews with 10% ABV. Aroma is predominantly dark chocolate and roasted coffee. Mouthfeel is exceptional. Gets even better as the beer warms up, the ABV is not felt as much. Silky smooth stout, the taste is dark chocolate with a perfect blending of coffee and some roasted malty after taste. The mouthfeel, as i said earlier, is truly exceptional and so is the drinkability. It is an excellent stout from Brooklyn Brewery, which every stout lover must most certainly have. Highly, highly recommended.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Pretty inviting  T:Sweetness up front and in the middle followed up by coffee and chocolate coating the palate afterwards leaving a coat across the palate.  M:Goes a little down here but not that much, body is slightly thinner than expected from the look and could possibly loose a little carbonation. There is also quite a bit of warmth for the alcohol down the chest which is not horrible but could mellow out just a bit more.  D:Pretty nice drink on this with just a slight bit of burn in the chest. Flavors are developing quite nicely and seem to be on the right track with a little more age to them.

Molasses and roasted malt. T- deep complex roasted malt flavors. Alcohol is present throughout. Has some bitterness, tastes of tar and the crust of brown bread as well. M- The bitterness and alcohol permeate mouth and linger for a bit. Not unpleasant mouthfeel. Viscous. D- 10% might get the best of some. This is a well-brewed stout. I'm happy, it's easy for me to get.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,paulozanello,3.81,"Pours a pitch black opaque color with small mocha head that recedes fairly quickly leaving good lacing. Aroma is chocolate, molasses, roasted malts and some alcohol. It could be stronger. Taste is very malty with chocolate, caramel and molasses upfront. This has a strong alcohol finish and it is very warming as you swallow it. Aftertaste is very mild for an imperial stout. Mouthfeel is creamy and mooth as far as texture goes. The alcohol is a bit excessive though. Overall a good beer for the winter but there are better ones out there.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Hopfenpeter,4.15,"I am drinking out of a crystal beer mug. The beer poures black with a small brown head , which recedes rather quickly to a thin lacing. The smell is a strong promise of rich chocolate taste, which is certainly fulfilled after tasting the beer. Very rich dark chocolate, bittersweet with hints of coffee. The roasted malts give a dominant character. The mouthfeel is a dry finish . A very drinkable beer for the cold season, especially with the combination of a good meal.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Magpie14,3.45,"A: heavy brown and black hues fall into murky darkness. Crowned with creamy mocha foam. A small smattering of sticky lace can be found in a few locations. Overall lacing is rather meager  S: nose is chockfull of malts. Some cocoa and coffee is present as well. Very dark and heavy in the nose. This heaviness includes a splash of alcohol and some fruits of the darker variety. Whiff after whiff and yet no hops detected  T: the predominant flavor is a tonnage of heavily roasted malts. Some bitter coffee grounds, dark chocolate shavings, and a pinch of brown sugar gather force with warming. I have noticed a slight astringency popping up laden with dark fruits (in the realm of prunes and figs). Overall I find this beer raw in character, not very refined in some ways. A blunt force of dark cocoa, alcohol, coffee and malts  M: good standing here with smooth and slick notes all around. The body is pretty heavy. Pausing between drinks for a minute or more leads to a persistent grain alcohol zing on the tongue  D: it works. I don't mind this brew. Not a top choice for the style and probably wont grace my fridge door again. In any event, a good-natured brew",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smell: Strong coffee & molasses with a whiff of alcohol and a hint of something lightly burnt.  Taste: Slightly carbonated with a rush of rich dark roasted coffee with bitter dark chocolate overtones, followed by the slow burn of the alcohol, finishes with the lingering taste of burnt toast.  Mouthfeel: A little to light for the flavor profile. Slightly watery expected a little thicker beer.  Drinkability: Definitely a winner year after year.

Leaves plenty of spotty, ringed lacing around the glass with nice retention.  Some roasted dark malts, molasses, toffee, dark chocolate and a hint of alcohol in the nose.  Bittersweet dark chocolate right up front, with some caramel and molasses swirls. Heavily roasted malt provides the backbone, with hints of coffee beans. Truffle-like sweetness pierces through, with some firm alcohol warmth. Finishes with a touch of hoppy bitterness and boozy heat.  Somewhat thinner feel than you might expect, with plenty of stickyness. Fairly smooth, creamy touches and decent drinking, although the 10% is still fairly apparent even with a year of age on it.

T: More smokiness then I was expecting. Light chocolate notes. Not nearly enough to be called a ""chocolate stout"". Finishes sweet with roasted coffee bean notes.  M: lots of carbonation. Pretty smooth almost creamy on the tongue. Not alot of alcohol presence.  Overall: A pretty run of the mill stout. Your basic chocolate coffee roasted maltiness.

Taste: Noticeable alcohol taste at first followed by dark chocolate malt. Each sip gets better and I begin to notice stronger hints of coffee. No sweetness but I guess that's indicative of the style.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, rich, and smooth. Little to no carbonation.  Drinkability: I must admit I haven't sampled many Imperial Stouts.

Appearance is pitch black with a no chance of any light permeating through. A moderate coffee colored head makes makes an all too brief showing but leaves behind a healthy looking lace.  Aroma is chock full of chocolate coffee goodness, like a good mocha. A slightly fusely alcoholic presence suggests that this one packs a punch.  Flavor is up front with a robust roasted barley flavor and chocolate malts. Taste is a bit hot with the alcohol, but this should settle down with time.  Mouthfeel is full and smooth.

Taste has definite notes of chocolate and roasted malts in the body followed by a little bit of dark fruit. Finish has a bit of alcohol showing through, and has a lot of bittersweet chocolate. Some astringent bitterness from the roasted malts is there as well. As the beer warms, the alcohol really shows more.  This is definitely a chocolate forward, thick beer.

It has some slight chocolate in the taste, but to be honest, I get a lot more chocolate taste from many stouts that don't have ""chocolate"" in the name.

Chocolate, espresso, and dark fruits help mellow out the roasty flavor. One of the best readily available chocolate stouts on the market today.  M - Fairly creamy with medium-heavy body and flavor.

S - Aroma of sweet delicious chocolate malt as well as some nice caramel and brown sugar. Slight cinnamon hints as well as licorice. There i some awesome fruity and boozy esters as well that are warm and inviting. Nice milk chocolate and cocoa powder notes dominate.  T & M - Starts off with some nice sweet chocolate hints as well as some dark bitter chocolate. Very well struck balance between dark chocolate and milk chocolate. There are some nice burnt and roasted malt hints in the middle portion after the explosion of chocolate that give the sweetness a nice balance. There are also some good alcoholic esters that are warm as well as sweet. The sweetness can be interpreted as caramel s well as brown sugar but they are not to overwhelming either. A complex yet balanced beer. Mouthfeel is perfect with nice oily consistency but nothing overwhelming as well as perfect carbonation balance and boozy warmth.

Taste - The taste is pretty good, the chocolate isn't as intense as I thought it might be, some green apple and other fruity flavors in the background. The malts aren't as robust as some beers of similar style giving it a more mellow flavor.  Mouthfeel - Creamy, carbonation was just right, was a little thinner than I expected, but not too thin.

Before the head recedes, this looks like a good, serious stout.  Smells like cocoa, roasted malt and chocolate. Bittersweet chocolate.  Tastes rich. The chocolate is not overwhelming at all, and it's not very sweet considering it has chocolate in the name. It's a dry, bitter chocolate flavor that blends in well with the usual stout flavors. A bit of alcohol on the end, but less than you might think; what at first struck me as an alcohol bite was in fact bittersweet chocolate. As it warms, the flavors blend even better.  Mouthfeel is a bit creamy, but not as thick as I might expect a 10 percent alcohol RIS to be.  Imperial Stouts aren't my favorite, but this is a great example of the style. Glad to have this so widely available around for the winter season.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mjurney,4.33,"Look: Pitch black, can't see through the beer. Very creamy brown head, lacing looks very nice on the glass.  Smell: Dark fruit, molasses, some roasted malts, a little sweet chocolate.  Taste: Dark fruit and mild roasted malts up front, I could dectect some burnt caramel in the taste. There's chocolate in the middle of my palate, along with molasses. Alcohol is present, but not overwhalming.  Mouthfeel: Very complex and full.  Drink: Very smooth finish, leaves a nice roasty aftertaste. It's a sipper beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S - dark chocalate smell mixed with fruity raisin  T - BIG dark chocalate taste and I mean BIG, some roasted coffee with slight caramel and dark fruit. Roasted malt up front then ends with a slight hop bitterness. Alcohol is present but not overpowering for 10%ABV.  M - Very smooth and silky on the palate, with that nice hop bite at the end.

45,680,liamt07,4.53,"From a bottle picked up at the LCBO, seasonal release. Into an oversized wine glass. Winter 2010-2011 vintage.  Pitch black in the pour, with a finger and change of dark tan head with a reddish tinge to it. Falls to a fat collar around the edges and leaves some magnificent lace. Awesome. Aroma is some coffee grain, dark bitter chocolate and some roasty malt. Everything is well balanced and integrated here. Can't smell the booze, but I knew it was coming. Roasty chocolate notes and booze hit the tongue and throat first, with some molasses-like sweetness following. A drying coffee finish tops it off. Body is thick full and creamy, and the booze is here, but not overpowering. Would definitely smooth out given some time, glad I've got a 4-pack of this stuff. A sipper at 10%, but that's expected. 5/45/45/4/4  Edit: Revisiting this one after a year in the cellar, still 2010-2011 vintage. Still gorgeous as fuck. Loads of molasses, brown sugar, bitter coffee and espresso. Great sweetness and balance. Almost liqueur-like flavours. No alcohol and a lovely, creamy feel. Downright brilliant; amazing what time does to this. Sadly my last bottle of this vintage. 5/45/45/45/5",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

This is a must-have winter stout for the East Coast....sorry West Coast, you already have enough legends out there, we get to have one now!  There is so much going on with the aroma. Myriad aromas are wrapped up in a blanket of oak. The first prevalent aroma is maple, as if you smelled maple syrup poured onto pancakes. Lastly the roasted malts show up, but don't completely cover the hotness of the alcohol. The taste is the same except for the touch of bittersweet chocolate that is mild enough not to mess with the maple. DRINK THIS BEER.  Be back in 5 years when I can do a 5-year vertical review, expecting the alcohol to become a little more mild over time.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,exanimo,4.03,"When does feeling overcome taste? This is the exact question I ask myself over and over whilst drinking this year's (10-11) Brooklyn Brewery ""Black Chocolate Stout"".  About a year ago I came across a case of Voodoo Brewery's ""Big Black Voodoo Daddy"" in Philadelphia and still have some sitting in my basement. Everytime I drink that beer I think to myself that it is THE epitome of what a stout should be. But when people ask me what my favorite stout is, it's always the same answer; ""Brooklyn Brewery's 'Black Chocolate Stout'"".  As I pour this year's installment, I think I've figured out why; It's the FEELING that rests within the bottle rather than just taste.  I first tried Brooklyn's interpretation of the imperial stout back in the Winter of 2007, that very same bottle still resides on top of my dresser. It was a special year for me because I had just started getting into beer and was sharing an apartment with my best friends, one of those years you just don't want to forget. Before this stout the only stout I had ever drank was Samuel Smith's Oatmeal stout, an incredibly smooth and mild work of art. But Brooklyn came along that winter and showed me that there was much, much more to a stout that I had enjoyed it with many dinners along with my friends.  3 years and several ""Big Black Voodoo daddy""'s later I look at the pitch black stout sitting in my pint glass with very little light brown head. I'm reminded of the first time pouring it into a glass in the apartment, putting it to our exposed bulb in the kitchen and exclaiming how little light showed through it.  I close my eyes and take a big whiff of it, the conversations with my pals come back to me along with the familiar boozeyness. Booze, Sweet malts, chocolate, charcol along with subtle coffee and wood notes. Nothing too spectacular. But the thickness of this beer on the lips and in the mouth is wonderful, one of my favorite things about it.  While I may love this feeling, I sit back after tasting and am pretty unimpressed with the overall flavor. It's not bad by a long shot, but after having many other impressive stouts it's just .. meh. With a strong booze and dark chocolate flavor with a bitter bite to the finish it's a harsher (in a good way) stout for sure, but has no real depth to it..  ..Even though the alcohol content is 10% it hits me harder than other 10+ beers for some unknown reason, and after finishing a bottle it put me right in the mood for one of those cold winter nights in my freezing apartment with my friends.  For me, the feeling, the warmth of the booze, and the memories are the saving grace of this beer. It pushes it beyond the just the flavor and beyond ratings .. It just puts me in a good state of mind.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,gopens44,3.73,"A - All kinds of pitch black. No light making it through even the edges on this one. The head was pretty fluffy, and receded to a thin layer of bubbles.  S - Lots of coffee and barley.  T - Bitter with coffee and chocolate notes. There was some sweetness in the back end that reminded me of molasses.  M - Creamy, smooth and not overly carbonated. Good finish with only a touch of bitterness lingering around on the tongue.  D - Not my favorite RIS, but I'll continue to mix this in with my ""go to"" favorites since it's a seasonal dig.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Bmoyer0301,4.53,"Appearance:  As I popped the cap on this gold and black ornate bottle there was a copious amount of hissing and carbonation gas escaping from the neck of the bottle. On the pour I decided to go straight on then back off and tilt because the bottom of my glass has a shark etched in on the bottom of the glass which will create a steady stream of bubbles and a larger head. This baby pours a jet black with a beautiful mocha colored head that is very thick almost coming to the rim of the glass. As I hold it up to the lamp there is no light passing through and just a tiny flow of bubbles from top to bottom and in the swirl there is a fair amount of viscosity clinging to the walls.  Smell:  Perfect! This is what I think of when I think of big imperial stouts, just loads of chocolate and roasty coffee grinds are swirling around my glass. A touch of brown sugar and raisin sweetness balances out all the dark ashy aromas that want to take front and center.  Taste:  It doesn't get much better than this. Right off the bat, I am getting the sweetness and not just cloying sweetness but rather balanced dessert styled flavors. Although there is no real chocolate in this beer it really mimics dark Belgian bakers chocolate and coffee with some caramel thrown in. If I had to describe it, I would say that it's creamy and medium on the palate not showing the high alcohol at all, almost like carbonated chocolate milk or brownie mix. In the finish you are left with some of the slight bitterness from the hops and the burnt malts that makes it appear dry. Ahh this is the complete dessert beer in a bottle or even a wonderful night cap to a cold evening.  Drinkability:  Overall, this was a knockout beer. I have been waiting for this one for quite some time to hit my local store and I am sure Al was getting tired of me calling him every week. In my opinion Brooklyn really does not make super wild extreme beers but they make so many styles to a tee and this one being no exception. I am glad that I have three more to enjoy over the next few months and I will be saving at least one for next year to see how it does with a little bit of time on it. I would say that you should not miss getting this beer. Seriously, go out now and look for it because it will go quickly and you will regret it. Well until next time....",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,perrymarcus,3.98,"12oz bottle served in an oversized wineglass.  pours your standard jet-RIS-black with a really nice finger-plus of a creamy, mocha toned head... very respectable retention and outstanding walls of lacing. presentation: simply A+... well done, exactly what i look for.  in the nose i get a ton of dark chocolate, roasted malts, and maybe a subdued dark fruity note or two in the background. great aroma.  taste is good but slighty disappointing, though on the latter count mostly considering the build-up of its appearance and smell... flavor mostly follows the nose though has some bitterness to it. alcohol is present, but although others have noted it excess, i feel it's relatively tame considering the 10% ABV.  moutfeel: not bad, but for an RIS (an arena teeming with worthy foes), a bit - a bit - on the watery side; doesn't have the velvety-ness i look for. adequate carbonation... decent drinkability, more a sipper than something you'd want a few of, but a beer i'll definitely seek out again (especially considering its very reasonable price).",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,soze47,4.5,"12 oz. 2010 selection.  Appearance: Black as the night. To poach from another recent reviewer, a khaki froth on top. I'm not getting much head on a somewhat aggressive pour.  Aroma: I get a big charcoal scent up front, along with the expected chocolate and espresso notes. Unlike others in the style, this seems to be a little stiffer in the nose and very wham bam. The smokey/charred quality to this gives the chocolate tones a somewhat unique character.  Taste: Dark chocolate and smoke qualities are powerful off the bat. Not bitter, which is a big credit to the malt. Sweetness is great here. There are some rather dark chocolate and charcoal forces in play, but it is balanced off nicely. The lingering characteristics are pleasant too with the bitterness coming forward to keep the sweetness from being too oppressive. Remarkable that there isn't more heat from the booze on this one.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy. It isn't thick or viscous, which is somewhat unique for the style. Considering the robust ride of the flavor, my tongue isn't too tired either.  Drinkability: For the style, very high. Not a trace of boozy heat or full feeling that comes from other Imperial or double stouts. A great year-round nightcap that would even be do-able on a summer night.  Overall- This one really grew on me as I drank it and had a chance to ponder all of its unique attributes. At first, it seems like many other chocolate double stouts, but it really has some great qualities that separate it from others. It has a low booze presence, light body, and nice smokey/charcoal quality that makes this a great option for the style.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Wonderful chocolate scents come through immediately, along with some coffee and dark fruits. Wow, this tastes really good, with the sweet and bitter chocolate dominating the flavor profile. Thick and creamy in the mouth, with very little heat (if any). I really like this stout with some age on it. This is my first experience with a 2 yr old BCS, and will continue to stash some of these away on a yearly basis.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MbpBugeye,4.15,"Ive had this one many times, I just havent gotten around to reviewing it. I actually havent had it to myself yet, its always been when I have been out with friends hanging out. Ive actually been known to drink this from the bottle on occasions where glasses werent available.  A- Nice tall, frothy khaki colored head leaves absurd lacing. Its more like a thick coating of primer that goes 3/4 of the way around the glass, only parting where I tilted the glass to drink. The head fades down, but remains a thin film with a thick pad in the center, supported by the laser etching in my glass. The beer is a super dark, opaque black.  S- Really great smelling as well. Its very raisiny. Much like chocolate covered raisins. Coffee and creme, charcoal and roast, brown sugar, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, semi sweet chocolate and a sting of alcohol.  T- More bitter than the nose suggests. This is from a huge roastiness. Big levels of charcoal, ash and roasted malts. After the initial wave of roast breaks, a dark fruit sweetness comes in toe with a strong essence of licorice. The licorice becomes stronger until the finish which yields a little bit of drying cocoa powdery chocolatiness.  M- Full bodied, slick, faintly sticky. Alcohol is perceivable but it is by no means challenging to the palate.  D- Im pretty glad I got multiples of this, but really one is enough. This is a rich beer and it makes a great dessert or night capper.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,geryeb624,4.35,"12 oz. bottle poured into my DFH Signature Glass. Winter 2010-11 bottling.  A- A brown-tinged dark black with a thin tan head, actually an impressive amount for a 10% ABV RIS. Fades into a tan slick of foam and a ring around the edge.  S- Slightly boozy with big hits of chocolate and some roasted malt and dark fruit. Not much coffee aroma, which I'm used to in RIS. Smells sweet for the style.  T- Not nearly as sweet in taste, with bitter roasted malts and some bittersweet chocolate and coffee dominating. None of the fruit from the aroma comes through in the taste, which I'm actually glad about. This is a chocolate coffee bomb, which I love.  M- Smooth and a bit chewy, but thin for the style. Nicely carbonated, avoids that motor-oil feel some high-ABV stouts can get, which wouldn't work here.  D- Insanely drinkable for its ABV. Goes down easy, and isn't too hot or boozy. Very nice stuff.  This is really good stuff IMO. A very nice, pretty easy-drinking RIS I'm glad to have around for the winter. Not quite up to Old Raspy, but darn good. Gonna lay some down for a year or two and see what happens I think, I'd like to try it and see if it gets a bit sweeter, more chocolatey.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

There is the slightest hint of coffee and licorice there too.  T - Taste seems to follow the nose, but with much more of a roasted character present. Slightly charred/burnt finish and a nice hop presence as well. The chooclate is sweet and really takes center stage here. Slightly bozzy taste, but not one that is offensive.  M - A little watery for what I feel an RIS should be. Overall though, nice medium body and a smooth carbonation on the palate.  D - Quite drinkable even though it is 10%.

45,680,Stoneyrok,4.4,"Bottle poured into a Weizen Glass (pilsner like glass)  A = nice black rich look with beautiful tan head, about 1/2 inch. Did not remain, but didn't care. Didn't notice much lacing, but there was some.  S = chocolate, alcohol, sweet, rich, and hint of hops for me.  T - My first thought was ""creamy"", and a beautiful subtle chocolate somewhere between a sweet milk chocolate and a gourmet rich bitter chocolate, so it was very good for me. This still tasted like a ""beer"" with a nice backup hops, and deep flavored malt that was sweet, but not too sweet. The alcohol was there, and warming, but be careful because it was not too noticeable but present. The mystery was the sweetness, but the dryness and Chocolaty aftertaste which remained. usually sweet, and dry do not go together in my many years of homemade wine. I love a chocolate/coffee/toffee stout/porter, and have had many, this ranks up there with the Founders breakfast stout, but a touch sweeter and dryer.  M = great, creamy, carbonated very well, not prickly, just right for a beer.  D = well, I had this beer, and then a Trappistes rochefort 10, and then one more black choc stout. I am not sure I would want a third due to the richness/ABV, but I am seriously thinking about going to get one more. 10%abv, the trappistes 11.3ABV, Another BCS 10%, and contemplating another 10% is difficult, but I might just go down and get one more. I think a four pack of the 10/11 is fine with the % ABV.  I recommend this, but have to say that I would have a hard time deciding which is best between a heavy seas peg leg stout, a founders breakfast stout, a flying dog gonzo imperial porter, and a great lakes edmund fitzgerald porter. Those other three are some of my favorites, so at least this is in the same ballpark. I'd probably rank in order the following: founders breakfast stout and great lakes stout = same peg leg imperial stout, and this beer the same, perhaps I like the peg leg a touch more. the ABV is very high and keeps me from drinking extra in this beer, where I can comfortably enjoy and extra peg leg without the high ABV.  I hope this helps. Get this since it is limited... since the ABV is high, save one for six months or a year down the road and see what you think about it as it ages some.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mfunk9786,4.85,"This is one of the beers I look forward to every year. Even though they've gone to four-packs, Brooklyn prices this very reasonably, and a $45 case isn't hard to come by. It's worth every penny, this is one of the best beers on the planet. Drinking a fresh Winter '10/'11 bottle. It's as tasty as I ever remember it being. Not as roasty and big as '08/'09, not as thin-tasting as '09/'10 (judging from my notes, anyway) but a lot more drinkable and delicious.  A: Ink-black with a light brown head. Definitely a big-looking beer, intimidating you with its look. I don't know what the heck is going on with this beer though, because the look is a lot bigger than the final product ends up being. And I mean that as a compliment!  S: Smells of baker's chocolate and faraway espresso. Definitely not a coffee flavored beer, but smells of the roasty character that coffee stouts usually carry, only without the coffee.  T: Tastes beautiful. The best balance of any beer I've had. There are other beers that are more drop-dead delicious, but they abandon their beer character for sweet chocolate-milk deliciousness. And there are other beers that are stronger and more bitter (Storm King, for example), but they give up some of this sweet, tasty drinkability for that. This is the perfect blend of chocolate, roast, and dark anise/dark fruit/hop character. The perfect beer, taste-wise.  M: Smooth and tasty with just enough chocolate sweetness and bitter hop finish. The 10% alcohol is dangerously imperceptible.  D: Maybe the most drinkable Russian Imperial Stout out there. The heightened dark chocolate character makes it more drinkable than most beers of this style, and the fact that it isn't a coffee stout or the fact that it's missing a lot of bitterness is something that can be counted in its favor, as it makes it a very unique beer that I haven't ever experienced a duplication of. Sure, there are other amazing stouts out there, but this is a delicious interpretation of a RIS that I hope never goes out of rotation at Brooklyn Brewery.

Taste: There were definite roast qualities, but chocolate really took the center of the stage. There was hoppy bitterness, but it was in perfect balance. Residual sweetness and coffee flavor were both present. There was an alcoholic presence, but it was not offensive in the least.  Mouthfeel: The beer was full bodied, but the carbonation was on the higher end of the style which seemed to work perfectly to keep the beer full bodied, but not feeling like motor oil on the tongue.

S: Definitely getting milky chocolateiness, along with prunes, and malty roastiness. The cocoa builds even more as the beer warms.  T: Sweet and somewhat boozy, but the chocolate nibs candy-coat the alcohol granules making the drink enjoyable. The Willamette hops definitely give this one a very earthy flavor - maybe too much even....I'm kind of missing the wonderful cinnamon-like aftertaste that I commonly associate with RISs. Still, this is a damn tasty chocolate drink!  M: I wish this thing weren't so dang sweet, but I have a gut feeling that Brooklyn was going for more of a dessert type of brew with this one, so I'll give it a pass somewhat. On the plus side, the sweetness DOES kill the bitterness. I actually don't find this one bitter at all.  D: The 10% ABV is definitely detectable, but I enjoyed the session.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with smooth carbonation, slightly watery.  Overall, a very nice imperial stout. It's pretty well balanced.

S: Smells of chocolate and very little else. It's not very strong but the scent is there without needing to completely submerge the nose.  T: It tastes very chocolaty, and roasty. There is very little bitterness, and no offending alcohol burn (10% ABV). I can pick up some of the alcohol flavor the more I drink it, but it's hardly noticeable in the blend of roasted grains and chocolate flavor. I need to especially note that it is blended very well together. The beer as a whole is very complete.  M: It definitely feels present in the mouth. There is very little bitterness, so it's very easy to follow up with another drink. It's not quite as creamy or smooth as other stouts I have tasted.  D: As mentioned numerous times before, it is not very bitter and the alcohol isn't as present as many other high ABV beers in the same class. This is a coy beer, and it is easy to get ""pulled under"" the weight of the high alcohol content.

Aroma is roasted coffee, toasty malts, barley and coffee.. bit of a metallic tinge which isn't all too pleasant, but its not prevalent. There isn't a lot of complexity I'd say right now. It's rather green and kind of sour? Taste is mostly roasted malt, coffee and tobacco. Boozy. Hop bitterness is really starting to coat my tongue as the glass empties. Mouthfeel is about right. Very full and creamy. Drinkability is okay but I wouldn't have a second right now, this needs some age.  If you're a coffee aficianado and know how coffee tastes when you brew it below the proper temp this BCS is very similar.

On to the beer:  Actually, I did want to try this beer on-tap on a trip to Boston three years ago, but the pub I went to tapped out of it before my arrival. Finally, I can take notes on this one. This is black with a capital B with a tanned head of rich thickness and impressive retention. Interesting nose we got here; fruity, smoked chocolate malts, and a hint of BBQ sauce. The taste goes more in the chocolate direction than the aroma; chocolate malts hit, some toasted action, and a light drizzle of smoke. Its alcohol is hidden well underneath my favorite part of the ride, the thick, creamy mouthfeel BCS provided.  My curiosity of BCS has been fullfilled.

Also you can smell the malt as well. I would seriously buy a candle that had this smell to it.  T: Amazing taste. The notes of choc, espresso, and vanilla go VERY well together. The strong alcohol content really compliments the espresso flavor. Personally I love the higher alcohol content beers so this one really does it for me. Cannot stress the espresso enough.  M: The chocolate taste goes down very smooth. However the higher alcohol content gives the beer a little more bite than I would prefer.  D: While I love the higher %, it makes the beer harder to drink overall. I would only be able to have 1 or 2 of these and I would not want any more beer.

Has enough carbonation that it kind of offsets the stickiness.  D: Im trying really hard to drink it slow because of the ABV. It's difficult.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mattgreger,3.45,"Poured into a pint class a solid black color with a nice off white 1 inch head. It had decent retention and some lacing that followed.  There was some strong aroma of roasted malts and a very strong lingering of chocolate.l Notes of caramel, vanilla, espresso, and fruit.  The flavor of this brew is pretty good. Its very complex. There is all kinds of flavors that hit up front. The roasted malts and the cocoa hits you at first, but then they slide in with a bit of almost a dried fruit that give it a bittersweet and tart flavor after the sweetness of the malts and sugars in the brew. There are some other flavors present in there as well. Some caramel and spices that help tingle those taste buds. The finish has a bit of a alcohol hit, that doesn't hurt the brew to much...but is almost to much if you aren't drinking this as after dinner brew.  This is decently drinkable beer. Some might have some issues from the heaviness and the higher ABV might be to much for some people who aren't used to these Russian Imperial Stouts. Still a good brew. Very creamy which helps give a few more points in the rating systems.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,chrisgn,3.65,"A- Black with a coffee colored head. Some lacing on the glass, not excellent.  S- Alcohol and dark chocolate.  T- This beer is actually pretty bitter, tastes like dark chocolate. Taste improves as it warms. Hop character is definitely present as well.  M- not very rich and creamy, but still full bodied. Lingering alcohol burn after each sip.  D- This is a well made beer for sure, but the bitterness and 10% abv make this a sipper. Certainly better RIS's out there. Not very much a fan of the bitterness.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Notes of caramel, vanilla, espresso beans, and dark fruit and a touch of alcohol. Very Nice!  T - Mostly sweet roasted malts at the front, caramel, bittersweet cocoa notes ( a little less than I was hoping for ), dried dark fruit, vanilla, with kind of a bitter coffee/hop combination of the back end with a little more alcohol present than I would prefer.  M - Pretty well balanced, a little lighter than I expected from the look of it, but smooth and creamy nonetheless.  D - Very enjoyable to drink, alcohol is a somewhat present as a reminder of the ABV, but I could enjoy a few without any problems.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Caramelly sweet malts, toffee and dark dried fruit flavors. Medium high bitterness accentuated by the dark malts. Light alcoholic warmth. Medium full bodied, slick and thick. Medium low carbonation.

Taste: Chocolate, roasted malts, and floral hops.  Mouthfeel: Medium-heavy, but not like syrup.  Bottom line: This is a very well crafted beer. It is very hard to tell that this is 10% ABV by how smooth and flavorful it is. To me, it seems like a much more flavorful and alcoholic Guinness.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S - chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and a touch of malt sweetness.  T - good, but a little soft. The chocolate is there, but not as pronounced and I would've liked. Coffee and vanilla in the middle, then some hop/espresso bitterness on the back, as well as a small bit of alcohol warmth.  M - good carbonation and smooth on the palate.  D - it's pleasant, but could use a year to let the alcohol and hops mellow out and maybe allow for some more of that chocolate to come forward.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,vandemonian,4.49,"Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout beer is black as space. The head was short lived and had a medium brown colour; only a tiny amount of lacing remains. As soon as a poured it I smelled malt, even from 3 feet away. When you get closer you also smell sweet coffee. The first flavour I got was coffee changing to sweet maltiness. The aftertaste was of bitter black chocolate. As my palate grew accustomed to it, the taste grew more uniform and I mainly tasted milky, bitter chocolate. This beer has a milky feel and is surprisingly light for the style with very little carbonation.

The chocolate flavor intensifies as it warms. Also some vanilla. Very nice.  M/D: Medium to full bodied with nice carbonation. Very easy to drink and leaves a nice aftertaste.

45,680,Bonis,4.23,"A - A black as night brew pours with an inch of creamy mocha head, which settles to a ring of bubbles around the glass. A nice lacing is left, something I have not noticed before with this brew.  S - Smell is of sweet dark chocolate, robust dark malts, and hints of bitter chocolate, coffee, and a dose of alcohol. An earthy characteristic lingers as well. Nothing is too powerful. The aromas are subtle and play together nicely.  T - Both sweet and bitter chocolate dominate at first, and then give way to some dark fruit flavors that I don't often see in a stout. Bitter coffee notes creep into the mix as it warms, as well as some earthy cacao bean flavors. The alcohol is there throughout, but not too powerful, as the flavor complexities of this one tend to hide it. A very rich and robust brew and very well balanced. This is a solid example of the style. Very, very tasty.  M - Wow this one is big. Alcohol explodes in the mouth and leaves a coating of chocolate alcohol goodness. It isn't bad, quite nice actually. Smooth for the ABV and not much carbonation.  D - This is an intense beer that is not meant to be really drinkable. That being said, it isn't bad for an RIS.

45,680,Phelps,4.17,"Poured from a bottle capped in winter 09 into my perfect pint glass. Thanks go out to CooperEllis for including this in a trade as an extra.  Looks: after an absolutely perfect pour (if I do say so myself), the dark chocolate liquid coalesces into blackness with a glutinous one-finger head of cinnamon. The beer's crown quickly collapses to a chunky, filmy layer of light tan that grips the sides of the glass in thick, webby sheets.  Smells: lovely. Lots of licorice, dark chocolate, molasses, graham crackers, old-fashioned syrup, cocoa powder. Little bit of toast and charcoal in the background. Sweet prunes, raisins.  Tastes: shifty. The flavor begins with sweet dark fruits: prunes again, figs, boysenberry syrup. As the flavor opens up, notes of dark chocolate, espresso and maple syrup take hold before a lingering roasty, toasty finish. The transfer from sweet to bitter roastiness happens quickly and so smoothly that it's hard to pick out when one drops off and the next begins. Very, very nice.  Feels: filling. Amidst a low yet rumbling carbonation, the body is fantastic -- medium yet super smooth and creamy. The alcohol is powerful, noticeable in the mouth, the back of the throat and as a a warming sensation that builds in the stomach. Very nice.  Drinks: wait, you guys are telling me that this stuff is available right off the shelf on the east coast? Like, you don't have to wait in line for three hours or anything to pick this up? You guys got it good over there. If I had steady access to this beer, I don't know if I'd ever not have some in my fridge. For its availability, one of the best RISes out there.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,CooperEllis,3.85,"12oz into dfh snifter  The color is dark, the pour is not viscous. Very little head, some lacing - both are carmel.  An obvious chocolate aroma, but very little complexity.  Chocolate/cocoa nib with a lightly roasted malt. There is a nice hop flavor underneath that compliments the cocoa, it is more of a hop bitterness than a chocolate bitterness. The flavor rounds nicely, and the finish loses the chocolate which I find to be a positive.  It drinks well, a bit light on carbonation, with a coating sip and a crisp finish I would normally associate with a much lighter and hoppier brew. Although at over 10% it's tough to enjoy more than one.  (24)",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,thebeerdoctor,4.03,"This came my way sort of by default. A convenience store owner who I do consulting work for, had a case shipped to him, a couple of weeks ago. Thinking it was this winter's edition, I thought it was odd that it would be appearing in September. Turns out that this is the 2009-2010 winter of last year, where a four-pack was plucked from a completely sealed case box. So what does a year old vintage Black Chocolate Stout taste like? For one thing, it thickens somewhat. As black as can be, with tan foam. This Russian Imperial style has that dark currant raisin plum like depth, and the alcohol strength of 10% becomes apparent, especially if served too cold. Nevertheless, a classic American take on a world class sipper, although I will never understand the idea of having this with a cigar. Adding nicotine poison to this malt showcase, seems to me to be an incredibly stupid nullification.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

T: Pretty much follows the nose, but there's a little bit of surprise sweetness in there as well. I would say this is a mix of dark chocolate, raisins and brown sugar. A pretty good tasting beer, though I would like a little bit more intensity of the flavors.  M: Too thin for my liking. Otherwise nice carbonation, aftertaste, and weight.  D: Excellent drinkability considering the ABV. The alcohol was not nearly as noticeable as I would have thought based on the smell. This one really goes down easy.

Lots of chocolate malt with caramel and some roasty bitterness.  T. Lots of bitter chocolate with roasty coffee/espresso character. More sweetness in the nose than comes across in the flavor. Little perceptible sweetness due to the bitter from both hops and roasted grains.  M. Full bodied with a high level of almost biting carbonation. The carbonation here takes a bit away from the mouthfeel for me; it makes me want to swallow rather than appreciate the flavor medley.  D. Surprisingly a bit hot even though it's almost a year out and not terribly high abv in the first place. Good, but not excellent.

Head sticks around longer than your typical RIS with such a high ABV. Leaves some fantastic lacing.  Aroma - Dark chocolate and dark fruits with alcohol. Typical roasted malt as well.  Taste - Up front you are hit with alcohol and the dark fruits. Midway through the dark chocolate notes come into play with the roasted malt leaving a lovely dark chocolate after taste. Finishes very smooth. Uncanny how much it finishes with dark chocolate - like after eating a piece of dark chocolate with a high cocoa percentage.  Just an absolutely fantastic dessert beer. Would pair very nicely with vanilla ice cream.

Pours jet black with a light finger of foam. Light sips leave traces of brown lace.  This is a big rich beer. Like a boozy glass of espresso chocolate cake. It's delicious through the glass, with each sip varying in intensity between chocolate and coffee. with plenty of malt diversity along the way. Light notes of sweetness and banana endure. Unlike some other stouts, I think the booziness is more than apparent but this one is so flavorful that it doesn't take away from the focus of the drink which is the big chocolate malty flavor.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

I've had it once before and remember it got better as it warmed.  Served into a pint glass, Black Chocolate Stout really does have a black appearance everywhere except the edges. The thin head settles quickly.  Aroma is very strong. Usually my nose doesn't do much for me but here I can smell all sorts of goodness. Huge roasty dark malts and a good dose of dark chocolate. It also has what I would associate with a bourbon barrel aged beer - primarily oak but also alcohol.  Flavor is intense as well. It starts off sweet and doesn't seem so big and scary. Then it gets big, dark, roasty, and bitter. The middle of each sip is dominated by dark coffee and baking cocoa. The finish is dry and a little harsh.  The mouthfeel is full bodied and low in carbonation. It has a nice smoothness but the alcohol dries my mouth and starts to burn.  Overall I enjoy this beer but it's not one of the best in this crowded style.

T - Powerful malts blast your mouth with the chalky flavors of coffee and chocolate as well as plenty of dates and figs. Quite a bit of booze as well. Needs to be consumed at the proper temperature.  M - Nice and creamy but it seems that the alcohol gives this brew a bit of a bite.  D - Goes down pretty easy regardless of the booziness of it. I'd like to have one with a few years on it. Would probably seek out different beers to try, but this is worth a shot. Drink it warm.  EDIT: 12/1/10 Having a year old bottle now. This beer mellows wonderfully and is an extremely good value even if you have to sit it in your cellar for a year to make it better! I have to do some number adjustments.

45,680,davod23,4.26,"This bottle is about three years old. Poured into a Bruery tulip.  This is pretty. Very dark, near-black, with a cascading tan head that culminates at about two fingers. The head recedes to a thin cap, but a swirl causes it to stir from its slumber. Tilting the glass results in a slow ascension of the head to the top of the beer. Very, very nice.  Smell is good, though not great. Perhaps I have been spoiled by barrel-aged brews and other massive stouts. Dark chocolate, some roasted coffee notes, slight anise. The booze is completely hidden, which is impressive. This aroma is just not as aggressive as I'd like to have in a big stout.  The taste is nice though. Bitter, dark chocolate, roast, coffee, toasted malt in perfect balance. Booze is nonexistent. This is slightly sweet, but is balanced by the roasted coffee bitterness on the tail end. This is nearly 11%? That's almost unbelievable. Well done, Brooklyn.  Mouthfeel is okay. Medium-bodied for an imperial stout. I honestly wish that it was a bit more viscous. This is fine, but damn, if this was a bit thicker I would be a much happier drinker right now. Appropriate level of carbonation, finishes reasonably dry.  Drinkability is off the charts. Seriously, I could drink gallons of this stuff. It's very tasty and very balanced - the moderate level of sweetness and the dryness of the finish would allow for copious amounts of ingestion. I don't know that I've had an imperial stout of this strength with greater drinkability than this one.  Quite good, and considering its price and ubiquity, is a great buy.

Smelled of rich roasty, chocolaty malts. Lovely.  Tastes of semisweet chocolate, lots of booziness, and some strong underlying dark fruits like raisin, figs.

T - Deep roasted bitter chocolate, toasted malts, coffee, and vanilla cream. The flavor is consistent throughout the entire sip with coffee and bitter chocolate dominating.

45,680,Jeffo,4.02,"This was a seasonal release at the LCBO last winter. My buddy Logan did the grunt work and picked up a few for me. Thanks a lot man!  From a bottle into a snifter.  APPEARANCE: Pours dark brown and produces a small ½ finger medium looking mocha colored head that quickly fizzes down to a half wisp and ring. Sits jet black in the glass with no carbonation evident. A ring remains and leaves a few dots of lace down the glass.  SMELL: Mild strength nose of roasted malts, dark malt, smoke and some dark bitter chocolate. Not as bold as I'd hoped, but nice non-the-less.  TASTE: Much bolder flavors. Roasted malts all over, with some black licorice and dark chocolate notes of course. A bit of spicy alcohol in there along side the roasted and chocolate notes. A medium strength and shorter lived aftertaste is roasted and alcoholic with some chocolate notes still. Plenty of black, dark chocolate, but nicely balanced as well with the roasted and spicy qualities. A bitter-sweet finish. Very tasty.  PALATE: Medium-full body with medium carbonation and creamy enough on the palate. Goes down smooth and finishes slightly mouth-coating.  OVERALL: A solid brew I'm glad I had the chance to try. The chocolate comes out more as the beer sits, but because I serve most of my beer at room temperature, I don't think it had much to do with warming up. A very tasty beer that needs a bigger nose as well as a thicker pour and more impressive head to bring it up a notch. Non-the-less, a tasty treat for sure.

45,680,StephenRich,3.98,"Its a beautiful thing for me when fall and winter roll around. Not for the weather, I really love summer and always hate to see it go. But the colder seasons do bring about the big stouts again. Its a seasonal thing, and I understand, but I still think that you can enjoy a nice big stout on the hottest of days. Just last week on a steamy Friday afternoon a friend of mine and I sat down and enjoyed the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout.  I did already mention it when writing about a beer dinner that I prepared, but I don't think I gave it as much attention as it deserves. This is a big stout made available by the Brooklyn Brewery from October through to March. It is brewed as an Imperial Stout reaching 10.1% abv in regular 355ml bottles. I do wish that it came in the larger corked 750s, but I'll survive. I have only had this beer fresh, but I recently put four bottles of it in my cellar to see how they mature - and I am expecting very positive results!  Being a big Imperial Stout, you could enjoy the Black Chocolate Stout warm around 14c (54F), however I have a lot of experience with this beer, and I like to start it off a touch colder around 10C (48F). The hoppy character in this beer will react very well as the cooler temperature, but the warm cloying thick malts will be perfect warmer - so this way you get the best of both worlds!  I have a Brooklyn pint glass so I poured it gently in. It flows smoothly out of the bottle in a very creamy and silky manner building gently in the bottom of the glass. About a quarter of the way up a rich brown foam starts to build on the surface of pure blackness, so I raise the bottle to enhance the action. By the end of the pour a medium brown, milk chocolate 1.5 inch foamy head is lifted showing dense carbonation and fluffy airy texture. It is perfectly constructed and shows excellent head retention.  The beer it is resting on is black as night shinning deeply with only a very faint touch of garnet or ruby along the sides of the glass when held into the light. With a light twirl the beer shows smooth ink-like thickness - a perfect indicator of things to come.  The nose shows much malt complexity and right away brings rich deep flavors of roasted barley, dark malts, bitter chocolate, a hint of molasses and touches of alcohol. Dark roasted coffee shows up after another smell, and a slight touch of hops come in with a floral finish. Hops don't stand much of a chance here on the nose; the rich flavors of dark malt and roast are easily dominant showing strength and power along with the beer's 10.1% alcohol.  Go in for a drink and let the Black Chocolate Stout sooth your palate. It really does exactly that. It glides in gently with silky smooth sweet malts and big and round roast chocolate. The malts are rich and dark showing a lot of sweet upfront power, but slowly rest into a gentle, more mellow sweet flavor. Caramel candies, dark brown sugar, a bit of molasses and mulled dark berries are present on your tongue while the soft bitter chocolate floats past your tongue and onto the cheeks.  A hint of smoke, most likely just light roast, also shows up, with a soft finish of bitter hops. Overall the hops add bitterness to the roast and bitter chocolate, but are not overpowering in any way. The alcohol is relatively apparent, and the strength of the beers body comes out with it. It is just a big roasty and dark chocolaty stout with huge depth. It is not really the most complex, so it fits a very nice niche in the Imperial Stout category.  The finish is warming and smooth showing slight hops, rich roast and soft chocolate. Very soothing. I do think with 1 or 2 more years this will mature into perfection, but only time will tell. The best thing I have ever had this beer with is creamy cheesecake - wow, the creamy textures are so elegant next to each other. But chocolate cake or vanilla icecream work wonders as well. In any case, enjoy the Black Chocolate Stout when you need a simple and deep chocolate stout - it will treat you right.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,Ryan011235,3.53,"Poured into a snifter on 1/4/10  Winter 2009-2010  Pours a very dark brown/burnt crimson; settles black. Almost two fingers of porous, light brown head. As it's riddled with pores, it quickly settles to 1/2 inch, leaving pretty good lacing. Swirling keeps alive thin retention throughout. Splotchy lace.  Smooth aromas of roasted dark malts. Chocolate is most notable. Undertones of dark fruits, especially raisins. A touch of booze on the peripheries. On the whole, the nose is more subtle than I'd expect.  Lots of dark, roasted malts offer a something of a sweet quality. This is offset by a large amount of dark chocolate that tends to be bitter. Mild hits of hops around the edges. Tastes pretty good, though not particularly complex.  Full bodied with smooth & creamy carbonation. Negligible alcohol heat coming through, if any. Hints of roasted chocolate linger.  As mentioned earlier, this isn't the most complex example of the style. It tastes pretty good & is ultimately enjoyable. For some reason, I imagined this beer would be more righteous. Maybe it needs a year or two.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,nickd717,3.88,"Notes transcribed from 2007, re-tried again in 2010 to validate score. 12oz bottle both times.  This beer is in fact black, with a small brown head, but I wanted to see a little more chocolate.  Roasty coffee-ish aroma with a hint of chocolate.  Flavor is rather subtle for the style but very good, with roasted malt, coffee, and a little dark chocolate. Considerable alcohol presence, especially when fresh and/or cold.  Palate is decently full but I would like a little more. Fairly creamy on the mouthfeel.  Solid offering but not quite as complex as some of the other imperial stouts out there. It's a hell of a beer overall though and gains points for its subtletly and balance.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,billab914,4.33,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Bruery tulip. Poured black in color with a half inch, dense, tan head covering the top of the beer. The head settled down to a thin covering where it left some great lacing on the glass.  The aroma shows some very good chocolate flavors to it. It has both a roasty bitterness and a milk chocolaty flavor to it at the same time. Smooth and balanced aroma to it overall.  The taste has a lot of good dark, bitter-sweet chocolate flavor coming through. Some roasted, slightly burnt flavors come through more towards the finish. It has a sweetness to it though that really helps balance it out some. The chocolate is very nicely done, the bitterness and sweetness of it really comes together nicely.  The mouthfeel is on on the thicker side, but probably middle of the pack for imperial stouts. Carbonation is also moderate for the style. Drinkability is very good, it has some great flavors to it and was a very tasty beer for an after dinner drink tonight.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Sjokvistarn,4.45,"A: Pours dark, but pretty straight, and easy out of the bottle with a thick, high head that lingers for quite some time before it disappears smoothly.  S: Dark, cacao rich chocolate, possibly the kind spiced with flake salt, some coffee. A discreet warming smell of alcohol shines through.  T: Creamy, thick, mocha chocolate, hints of raspberries and red currants. Not quite the obvious salty taste as I would expect, but it's there alright. Warmth of alcohol shines through but in a very pleasant way. The mouthfeel is nice thanks to the minimal amount of carbonation and bubbles, another sip is very hard to resist.  Overall impression then? Well, given the price, which was a bargain at 19.90 SEK this is nothing short of a fantastic beer.

Chocolate and alcohol dominate the aroma with a healthy dose of roastiness and a noticeable amount of pine with a little bit of dark fruit and slightly vinous. Flavor is lots of bitter dark chocolate and coffee with lots of alcohol. A little more dark fruit and banana up front than the aroma with quite a lot of hop bitterness. Body is a bit thin for an imperial but fairly full. Loads of prickly carbonation break up the mouthfeel too. Just a bit too much alcohol coming out that seems to hide some otherwise great flavor and aroma.

It pours a straight jet black topped by over a finger of light tan foam. The nose comprises molasses, chocolate, brown sugar, roasted malts, and a hint of maple syrup. The taste is very similar, with the roasted malts taking center stage, followed by a strong chocolate powder contingent. The rest comes in in a nice dark melange in the finish. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a very smooth feel. Overall, this probably the most readily drinkable widely-available stouts around.

45,680,Khazadum,4.74,"I received this as part of the Blind Beer BIF, it is a 03-04 vintage courtesy of Prufrock. Poured into Brandy Snifter  Vision I've never had a problem creating head before but this one pours without a single bubble appearing on the surface. My jaw drops as I think this is a beer with no carbonation, but giving it two seconds a rush of half a finger of foam rushes to my rescue. The color of this head is not the crisp wedding dress that was the last two beers but milk chocolate and coffee mixing together ( Mocha, yes? ). It quickly loses itself to the atmosphere that is my apartment and leaves not even a skin behind. As I pick the glass up, the disturbance generates that ring of mocha on the perimeter to define just where the glass is. I wish I could tell if bubbles are flowing up within the murky depths of this beverage, but it is jet black... oil slick black.  Bouquet The smell is amazing. Its reminiscent of many other stouts and screams aging in some type of way. My tasting partner says whiskey, I say bourbon barrels. Its so sweet that its almost nauseating but it stops right before it goes over the line. Earthy undertones may balance this from causing me to find it over attenuated. Bitter chocolates perform the careful waltz that is an imperial stout with charred grains. I thought in the beginning I caught vanilla, but alas it was a fleeting dream as I can't find it anywhere again.  Flavor Profile I realize I am a goofy taster after I told my tasting partner to mimic me today. First, I took a sip and let it rush past my tongue and into my belly. Pow! Burnt grains and a smokiness that is MILES above what I was expecting.  With that in mind, the simple sip and wash down over the tongue leaves me convulsing in joy at how great this is. I find this to be my favorite smoky texture of any beer thus far in my admittedly small tasting experience. Now, the next taste I do is to take a decent sip and perform a figure eight with my tongue. Allowing this beer to linger in a rave like atmosphere of my mouth brought out two distinct flavors. The first was what I imagine burnt grains taste like. Its not the smoky nature of before, but possibly what happens when the smoky flavor particles saturate their respective receptors and move on to different pastures. Its a creamy brother to burnt grains. As the liquid bends around my mouth milk chocolate jumps inwards from my cheeks and glomps my tongue. It surprises me and causes me to literally exclaim ""Mmmm!""  The finish of this beer is driven by the haze of smog roaming in the body. It finds its way into my oral membranes and hides from all degradation. It performs the buddy system of yesteryear with chocolate, however. At first you can revel in that fantastic smokiness, but as it is peeled away to move onward chocolate peeks its head out. It is very small and only momentary before the pair is whip lashed away leaving me with a quick stab of bitterness. As that bitterness, I can only believe it to be the alcohol doing a second walk through, fades I find myself dying for another sip to relive these flavors. It is a vicious cycle of undeniable joy followed by endless longing.  Oral Sensations I find this beer to be a conundrum. If I'm not careful, I can lick my lips and find the lingering flavors of it without even noticing it sticking to my lips. When I sip it and let my tongue explore its hidden natures, I find it to be slightly under what I want for its body. I want it to be thicker, almost more syrupy. I imagine that with this body it can't possibly display the coating capabilities that it does. It is impossible for it to hang around as it does. It is impossible for it to leave a residue on my lips. It is impossible for it to give resistance to my efforts. And yet.. it does. It could be a touch heavier, but maybe it doesn't even need to be and I'm just searching for some error here. I noticed an interesting shock, literal one, this beer gave me. When I pressed some of the fluid to the soft palate of my mouth I felt the stab of alcohol to make me jump as if it scared me. Of course, it is gone and impossible to replicate exactly, but sometimes I find the alcohol in the most interesting of ways. There is no carbonation, no fizzy nature, no bubbles to speak of when drinking this unless I swish it around vigorously. Even than, that probably isn't carbonation but my own air bubble generation.  Conclusions Hot damn! This beer was the most fun I've had with this hobby as to date. It is delicious, it is intriguing, and it is not overpowering. I would drink this again in a heartbeat. Hell, I'm probably going to go looking for more of this if I can.  It has that pleasant generation of a 'stomach furnace' as I like to put it. Even the faults I can find are probably strengths to others. I almost want to proclaim this beer my favorite beer. I thought this was bourbon aged, but I can't find enough of it for it to be anything recently aged.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,halo21,4.5,"Appearance: I poured out this blackest-of-the-black liquid into my Duvel glass, capped off by a creamy, thick, tan head, that provided lacing the whole time I was drinking this, which I nursed for a good amount of time. No light can shine through this beer at all; opaque as can be!  Smell:A very aromatic beer, with french roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate, and a hint of yeast esters and heat. One of the best smelling foods on earth  Taste:A flavorful stout, pretzel upfront and full of roast - coffee and malt - and baker's chocolate. Complex earth notes, that warms up to sweeter tones of dried fruit, esters and heat. Full flavored and rich.  Mouthfeel:A heavy bodied brew, with creaminess from the head and a smooth milk body.  Drinkability/Palitability:Medium - it is a beer that goes down well as a nightcap. Not something session-able, but the one bottle is easy to consume.  Notes: This is an exemplary example of an Imperial Stout. A great dessert beer paired with chocolate.

M - Pretty smooth with light carbonation. Felt nice on the tongue and wasn't overly thick, which was nice.  D - Overall, pretty tasty. I couldn't take down more than one of these at a time, but definitely worth a try.

Sweet dates, but bitter dark chocolate. Well balanced and not overly fruity.  Taste: Opens with sweet fruits- cherries and plum, but quickly darkens into roasted malts. Bitter dark chocolate going down, with a roast coffee aftertaste.  Of course, that could be said about any RIS, so what makes this one different? Unlike the overt sweetness of Southern Tier's Choklat or even the smooth mocha of Portsmouth's Kate, this beer throws around a bitter baker's chocolate to offset the sweet nose. Less of an alcohol taste than an Old Rasputin, and no less satisfying.  Feel: Medium bodied and creamy. Low on carbonation, but not a milkshake either.  Drink: This one is a sipper, though I've had a fair amount of sips for this review. Don't let the high alcohol content scare you off, as the bitter chocolates will force a little self-moderation.

45,680,beernoobreviews,4.43,"The Brooklyn Brewery Black Chocolate Stout is an incredible beer. Here are the details.  Appearance: This stout was black with ever so slight tinges of red on the bottom of the glass. Some brown but not much. Almost pure black. There was no head on this beer and like most stouts, when you look at it from the top it looks like an espresso. There was great lacing on this beer that reminded me of swirling a wine glass.  Aroma: The aroma was wonderful. I got a nice roasted chocolate scent mixed with deep-roasted coffee. I could pick up the malt also and some nuttiness. This beer had a slight swaf of sweetness. And whoa, I could smell the 10.1% ABV on this beer.  Taste: Wow. This beer has a fantastic taste. Though this is a chocolate stout, I picked up the deep-roasted coffee first. However, as I swallow a nice cocoa flavor coates the pallete. The chocolate is not a sweet chocolate but a semi-sweet cocoa. The coffee and chocolate are very well balanced with one not overpowering the other. The beer finishes with a hint of bitterness but it's the perfect amount. This beer blends everything together in perfect harmony. This is a full-body beer with a creamy mouth feel. This beer is dangerously easy to drink at 10.1% (which is a compliment).  Overall: What a wonderful beer. I enjoy stouts and this is likely one of the best stouts I've had.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The back end consists of loads of dark, tart chocolate and a hint of smoke, leaving an excellent, bitter aftertaste. A little heat on the end becomes more prevalent as time passes.  M - Really complex and somewhat contradictory at different times - big & chewy without being overly thick, some sips seemed to border on thin. Likewise, it mostly reminded me of a creamy, dark chocolate milkshake in consistency, but a sip here or there felt syrupy, as well.  D - The alcohol hurts a little, and the bitter helps a lot. I'd drink two, but not three.  I've had Black Ops, which I enjoyed quite a bit, but I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it is.

The aroma is very malty, as one would guess. Deep malt with a bit of, like, port running through it. Some nice chocolate tones, too; more milk chocolate than dark chocolate. Not very roasty. This smells pretty good, if unusual from the impy stouts I tend to drink.  Black Chocolate Stout is unusual on the palate, too. This isn't a bitter, roasty stout. It is malty and smooth and fairly clean. Much more malted barley flavor than chocolate. Coffee just isn't there. Ghosts of dark fruits that link up with the port smell. Some cardboard flavor shows up... this and the port quality make me think there is some oxidization going on. Anyways, different? Yes. Good? Almost.  Way too thin for an Imperial Stout. This is super-light. Oddly thin. It isn't satisfying. The only reason that this doesn't get a 1.0 is because the light flavors of the beer go well with the mouthfeel. But I am rating to style, so... The drinkabilty is consequently good. This is a stout that you want to polish off a few of in a session (though at 10% ABV you shouldn't).  I suppose that I am disappointed by this beer. It isn't to my taste. It is decent enough but if this were available locally to me then I wouldn't be rushing out to buy a 4-pack when it comes out each year.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,CHickman,4.5,"Pours opaque black with a 1 finger creamy light brown chocolate milk-like head that lasts a while; good lacing that slides down the glass. A very nice beer to look at and admire.  Smells of cocoa, chocolate, coffee beans, caramel, sweet malt, faint hops, vanilla, toffee and mild spices; the aroma is like a sweet coffee treat or hot chocolate.  Tastes of chocolate, coffee, cocoa, roasted malts, sweet caramel, faint hops, vanilla, brown sugar, toffee, burnt wood, some mild spices which gives a slight hop nip towards the dry end; nice smoky flavor mixed with the sweet malts. This is an extremely flavorful beer that hides the alcohol well and really goes down easy. The beer ends dry and smoky with peat, charcoal and roasted malt in the crisp finish. Very tasty and enjoyable; it's light for a stout, or at least feels light and full of flavor.  Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth, very mild to no carbonation and a shake like creamy feel on the tongue; this went down smooth and had an overall nice smoky flavor.  A great stout that I've enjoyed many times in the past and will seek out again. Very tasty and I recommend drinking this as a nightcap or desert beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,Amalak,3.73,"I had at a dive bar somewhere in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Didn't really even know the name of the place at the time. A-- Black, basically completely. Some light seeps through at the bottom. Even the head is a deep, deep tan. S-- Has a chocolate scent. It comes through. T-- Very rich, sour chocolate taste. Kind of a chestnut undertone. The chocolate comes through toward the end. A bit too alcohol taste.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,RobertTh3Texian,4.85,"The tan head forms up nicely and stands proud as if to say, ""I am Brooklyn, and Brooklyn is Stout."" Black does not even begin to describe this brew. It's advanced darkness that seeks light (lite) of the world and swallows it whole. The nose is as fruity and toasty as the first taste is. The body isn't too heavy and it leaves a good fruit flavour that I love from a good stout and only comes out in the best of chocolates. Good beer all around, a must buy if ya got it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,axeman9182,4.43,"An aggressive pour into my Duvel tulip yields a beer that is absolute black with a good sized milk chocolate cap. Head retention and lacing are both well above average for the style. The nose is intoxicating, chocolate covered expresso beans. The taste isn't quite as balanced unfortunately, as the rich dark chocolate notes dominate and any coffee flavor is merely an afterthought. Appropriately low carbonation for the style, and the body is almost perfect, full and impossibly creamy. This beer is ridiculously drinkable, tasty and a great mouthfeel with no alcohol heat, which is impressive for a 10%+ beer (note, I've learned to take this beer out of the fridge about 20 minutes before I'm going to drink it, if you drink it at fridge temperatures there will be some boozy heat to it). I still see why this is the beer that made me love craft brews.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,wcintula,4.55,"A- Starting with the 'executive' looking black label ('09-'10)spangled with stars, I anticipated a badass beer. I poured this baby into a Sam Adams glass(what was available) and daaamn, that beer is fine. Nice black opaque body with an excellent thick head.  S- Sweet. Sweet chocolate and roasted malt aroma. After you smell it, the beer pulls you in face first.  T- Awesome!!! Tastes like it smells. I tasted it in correctly the first time I tried it. When sipping I get a very metallic taste, but when you gulp it, your mouth is filled with sheer awesomeness.  M- A thicker feeling liquid with regular, not-too-prickly carbonation. Alcoholic dryness on the way down.  D- I drank the beer in less than 3 minutes. I'd consider that drinkable. I just wish I had another.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,slimstout,4.15,"Winter 09-10  Appearance: Thick, black (and still black when held up to light). Four-finger head.  Smell: Chocolate, malt, a lot of fruity scent (like plums), vanilla, booze.  Taste: The taste improves and grows richer as it warms. Dark chocolate (as might be expected), malt, booze, vanilla, caramel, toffee, prunes.  Mouthfeel: Mildly carbonated... much less than what I'd expect with the amount of head I poured. It's thick and fairly smooth. The mouthfeel also improves as it warms, it feels more smooth and mellow as it gets warmer, less sharp.  Drinkability: It's disappearing surprisingly fast.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

D- This is a great beer, alchol is just right for warming you up on a cold day.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,FreshHawk,4.38,"A - Pitch black color throughout with a large, thick, creamy, light sandy tan head. Very good retention which settles into a thick, creamy layer of lacing.  S - Fairly typical RIS smell with lots of dark malt. Dark chocolate is the most prominent of the stout flavors, but there are hints of coffee, dark fruit, just a little vanilla, and a bit of alcohol.  T - A lot of dark and semi-sweet chocolate throughout. Initially there is also some coffee and a touch of date and some other general dark fruit. Some sweet and some bitter flavors mix together. Mid sip a touch of alcohol and tartness comes out, but the dark malt and chocolate are still quite prevalent. It finishes similar to the start only slightly sweeter chocolate and a hint of vanilla. The chocolate, malty slightly sweet and bitter taste lingers on the tongue for a little while.  M - Medium to full body with a bit below average carbonation. Velvety smooth and creamy that goes down quite easy. Just slightly warming, especially considering the ABV.  D - Quite a drinkable stout and makes a nice dessert or night time sipper. Well balanced and has a nice assortment of flavors. The body also really helps the drinkability. Alcohol is definitely present, but it isn't that strong, especially given the ABV.  Notes: Vintage Winter 09-10. A very nice, chocolate forward stout. It isn't as chocolaty as Young's Chocolate Stout, but the chocolate malt is front and center. Good solid example of the style and made for a nice beer to sip to finish the night. Right on the cusp of being an amazing beer; it's not quite there but it is a very good beer that I would love to drink again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,silentjay,4.05,"pours a deep brown with mahogany hues. very dark, almost black. small khaki colored head laces a bit.  smells of black chocolate, yah, but also licorice, dark roasted coffee, raisins, dark fruits.  tastes a bit of black chocolate, but more of a dark roasted coffee character is prevalent, and just like in the scent, there is some dark fruits and licorice. a bit of bitterness is there and alcohol is apparent. chocolate comes through more as the beer warms. a powdered hot cocoa flavor that dries the tongue.  mouthfeel is nice and creamy with just enough carbonation to let you know it is there. nice.  drinks well now, but even better with age I would assume. alcohol is a bit hot, but not much more than expected.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TCgoalie,4.03,"Notes from 4/30/10  This beer presents itself as pitch black, a nice tan head, very pretty, with good lacing.  Roasted coffee and milk chocolate are predominant in the smell. There is some sweet toffee coming through...I think there is more, but the bar is impeding my olfactory glands.  Rich coffee and chocolate take over this brew. It is a pleasant combination to my palate. There is also a roasty taste throughout with a pinch of toffee sweetness. The roasted coffee taste seems to be the signature of this beer.  This is full bodied with a smooth quality and subtle hop finish. It leaves my mouth nice and sticky making swallowing more difficult than usual.  I would say this is average drinkability for a 10% brew. Normal RIS drinkability...definitely the best Brooklyn Brewing Co. beer I've had.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Solid 1.5 finger coffee color head that dissipated to a solid 1/8 inch head covering the surface. Easily stirred back up to a solid 1/4 inch head.  S - Drinking this one about 3 months after my first from this batch and the aroma has change sufficiently. The first time I drank this it was very fresh and there was a huge chocolate presence from what I recall. I remember being hugely surprised at what a chocolate scent there was. Now there is some dark chocolate upfront with roast coffee and maybe a hint of brown sugar.  T - Dark chocolate with roasted coffee some sweet dried dark fruits, possibly some prune.  M - Light carbonation and light on the palette for a big stout. Still a bit hot at 3 months since the last time but it has definitely been subdued quite a bit and mellowed out.

About a three finger darkish-tan head that sticks around a while.  S: Malts and chocolate. Quite pleasing.  T: As the beer's name might suggest, the first thing I notice is the chocolate. Dark chocolate. Very nice. Malts and a little bit of hops.  M: Syrupy, but not too syrupy. Carbonation just right.  D: If not for the 10.10% I could drink this all day long.

Alcohol is barely noticeable, if at all. As this warms up the chocolate really starts to shine.  Mouthfeel: This is a very smooth beer, with the perfect level of fine carbonation.  Drinkability: I could drink these all night if I could buy them in Las Vegas. Its incredibly smooth and the alcohol is hidden so well.

The nose is surprisingly lighter than I was expecting. I get sweet caramel, chocolate and faint hops.  Ahh, the taste is much larger than the nose. A gentle, sweet mix of milk chocolate, caramel, dark chocolate and coffee grounds collide in the front of the tasting. This is wonderfully smooth and not too sweet.

This is not Rogue, Youngs, or Southern tier, so don't expect yoo-hoo but expect a nice chocolate undertone.  Mouthfeel: Heavy yet finishes very crisp and clean.  Drinkability: Probably one of the most drinkable heavy stouts available (ie non milk/cream stout or dry irish stout).  Note: This is definitely ""old reliable"" for me, it's always on the shelf.

Lacing is abundant against the walls of the glass, but falls rapidly with small clusters of bubbles remaining.  The aroma from this is incredible. Intense sweetness fills the nose with notes of fig, plums, honey, brown sugar, coffee & dark chocolate.  Taste is a carbon copy of the aroma - not much else to say about it, it is excellent.  This beer coats the tongue with a syrupy-sweet layer that hangs around for what seems like forever. As it gradually diminishes, a bitter aftertaste reveals itself.  10% ABV? It is so well hidden, I get no burn or anything in the nose to tell me it's there. Drinkability is outstanding; it would be easy to overindulge in this.

Sweet upfront with just a hint of bitterness at the end.  M: Creamy, rich, really thick, but smooth.  D: Whoa! This is certainly a sipper. Far too rich and thick to take a gulp. Actually, it's tough for me to finish a 12 oz bottle because it's just so rich. Much better than I expected, though. I would rather drink this in a half dose.

45,680,theboozecruise,4.12,"Found this one at the 'Butcher' restaurant/deli/meat market in New Orleans, they served it ice cold with a frosted whiskey sipping glass, which was unusual. I like the small glass for the beer, but frosted was strange. Fortunately I had to wait for the food so I let the beer warm up some and the glass defrost before drinking.  It pours a dark brown, almost black color with a small tan head... nothing special, but I know this isn't really the optimal glass for the beer. I think in a pint glass where the head could develop during a full pour this would be a better looking beer.  The smell is bitter chocolate, delicious. The taste is more of the same... it's still a little colder than it should be but I can taste the bitterness of the chocolate with hints of spice and a slight sting of alcohol. Definitely a good one.  As for drinkability, would I order another one? I didn't this time, but in the future, absolutely I'd go for another one of these.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Daniellobo,4.13,"Nice roasted malt-chocolate RIS, which out of the blue on an unexpected tap serving felt rather mighty.  Presentation: 16 oz draft serving. All that the table attendant was able to articulate was ""Chocolate Stout"" and added ""Brooklyn"" after asking if that was the brewery. Served into a pint shaker glass.  A - Black body, small dark brown-ruby edges with a small brown frothy head. Average retention with rich touches of lacing. I personally do not like pint-shaker glasses, and if at all possible I try to avoid them. But this is the best looking brew I have seen in one of these in a long while (Two-Hearted ale notwithstanding.)  S - Chocolate notes over roasted aroma and a touch of coffee, boozy hint.  T - Rich roasted flavor with chocolate highlights and a bitter finish capped by the alcoholic note.  M - Full body, creamy and thick feel with small but adequate carbonation.  D - A nice RIS, rich in character and a great sipper. A bit excessive on a pint glass and yet there was a second one coming.  Notes: Rich and reliable, a nice stout and a solid offering from Brooklyn, and quite a surprise on tap being rather rich and remarkable.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The smell is very distingt. It filled the room right away. Except from the obvious chocolate there's some dark fruits, some coffee, honey and a very vague hint of orange.  I taste chocolate and figs up front, maybe some raisins as well. Then there's some alcohol, coffee and a dry tone of cocoa beans.  The mouthfeel is oily and dry with low carbonation and a bitter after taste. Calmness is a word that comes to mind.  This beer is quite filling and I can't see myself drinking another one tonight. But that's not a bad thing in my opinion, it only makes you drink it at a lower pace and abra-kadabra, this great beer lasts longer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

I like this very much but big alcohol. Only had two this day. I want cousin to send me more Black Chocolate Stout.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Jesstyr,3.71,"Enjoyed on St. Patrick's Day - even if i don't like Irish beer, I at least went for a stout. Poured in a Fuller's pint glass.  Pours a deep, dark chocolate brown, nearly black, and entirely opaque. Head is as brown as I've ever seen and is over an inch. Lacing stays strong to the last drop. Nose is entirely roasted coffee - not really diverse, this could be anything if not a beer.  Taste is much like the nose, heavily coffee, toasted malt, exceedingly dry. Not a hint of chocolate, but a nice heavy full body, roasted. Mouthfeel is smooth and full, very dry and defintely with an alcohol bite. Nice and drinkable, but definitely needs to be paired with food.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

I hope to try it again and re-review someday.  A - Dark brown, near black in color, and opaque, even when held to the light. Dark beige head disappears quickly, leaving a slight ring of foam. No lacing.  S - The smell is on the maltier side. Roasted malt, licorice, and chocolate. It grows more malty as it warms. There is also a strong vegemite/marmite smell that doesn't go away, presumably from the yeast. I didn't smell any hops.  T - Also malty, but with the hops coming through more in the flavor. Roasted malt and roasted coffee. Lemony, citrus hops emerge in the finish. There is a slightly sour aftertaste. Some sips had a slight cola taste.  M - Medium-bodied with light to medium carbonation. There is little residual feel, which I expect from an RIS.  D - Don't notice the alcohol for 10% ABV.

A - Just like the label says Black with some nice foam on top and some  S - Some chocolately note with roasted malts and coffee, not as strong smelling as I was expecting.  T - Decent combination of chocolate malts, burnt sugar, some coffee, and maybe just a bit of hops, but it masks the abv very nicely and goes down very smoothly.  M - Medium bodied, smooth and creamy. Coats the mouth like molasses or syrup would.  D - It hides the alcohol great but overall this is a pretty middle of the road RIS in my opinion. It is pretty inexpensive and if you haven't had it it is worth a shot.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,silentbob44,4.32,"At my local bar, this has been on-tap all winter, much to my delight.  A- Very dark, but not as opaque like some stouts that I've had in the past. When held to light it still shines through. The head is not pronounced and dissapates almost completely in about 10-15 mins.  S- Very strong and robust. You can smell a bit of the chocolate, along with a bit of the alcohol, though it is more masked by the other flavorings.  T- Primarily chocolate. Very dark chocolate, with an intensity that really masks the alcoholic content surprisingly, which makes this beer very unique. Smooth on the way down, but still can taste the alcoholic content.  M- High carbonation but smooth. Not as abrasive as other stouts.  D- Sip. Really only sip, though the smoothness is tempting for the imbiber to indulge too fast.

Malts upfront followed by coffee and dark chocolate bitterness with slightly nutty aftertaste.  M - Full bodied with high carbonation.  D - Easy going and abv is well masked but very filling.

45,680,EbPhrygian,3.98,"The weather's getting a little warmer, but still I thought this would be a good choice for mid-March. Starting to become intrigued by the stout style in general, and particularly self-proclaimed ""chocolate"" varieties. Poured from a 12-ounce bottle (labeled: Bottling-Winter 09-10) into a snifter.  Appearance: Pours a very dark [opaque] brown with one-finger mocha head. Retention is limited to a few small bubbles around the edge. This is a certainly a pretty beer to look at, as it is a lovely color.  Smell: Fairly strong aroma overall. Not much chocolate in the nose, but I'm anticipating that to be more of a property of taste. An earthy woodiness  Taste: Medium-bodied. Rather lengthy taste profile that begins with an earthy, woody bitterness. Gives way to a malty, roasted taste of creamy mocha coffee and finally finishes with a strong milk chocolate after-effect. All the while, a subdued hop quality is noticeable, too. Only as the beer warms slightly can I begin to taste the alcohol, so the 10% ABV is masked very well. Black Chocolate Stout is so satisfying to drink the whole way through.  Mouthfeel: Pleasant and smooth, not syrupy or overly sweet like I might have expected. Here I can savor the nice balance of [low] carbonation, bitterness, and sweetness  Drinkability: High, and probably its best attribute. Not that anyone should want to throw back several of these, but there's absolutely nothing getting in the way of finishing at least one, and this has been a problem for me when sampling other beers of this style. This beer is complex but easy to appreciate.  Notes: When I bought this four-pack of Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout I was deciding between it and the somewhat similar Southern Tier Choklat, which was only available in a bomber size, wasn't refrigerated, and was very overpriced. I think I made the right choice...",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,dqrull,4.15,"Jet black with a moderate creamy brown head leaving some creamy lacing.  Smells big of milk chocolate and fruits, hazelnuts and a soft spicy breadyness, cinnamon rolls maybe, red wine as well.  Taste starts of mildly sweet, the milk chocolate is there, together with a nutty nougat and a hint of grassy hops. The taste moves on to a semi-sweet fruitiness, dried red berries and some fruit candy, especially the ones supposed to taste of black currant, and in fact, the brew finishes with a light to medium bitterness paired up with what I imagine a curant cookie would taste like, with the alcohol present and warming behind it all. There is also during the whole taste a roasted note, almost like charred wood, or maybe charred bread, but it fits in well with a bitterness that otherwise would be lacking.  Carbonation is soft and pleasant, but the beer has a sting to it, cant really place it, but I dont believe it to be the alcohol, but it makes the lizuid feela bit harsh at times.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Some smooth chocolate and roasted malt and raison flavors on the nose but not too prononced. The first thing that hits me is the raison but once that fades the chocolate flavors kick in with bitter dark malt flavors similar to coffee. Pretty smooth mouthfeel that helps this beer go down quick.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Arbitrator,3.65,"Lightly chilled 09-10 vintage into a glass, courtesy of ericwo. Thanks Eric!  A: Pours black in the glass, essentially opaque in the center but just translucent at the barest edges. A finger of dark mocha head adorns the glass for a minute or so, receding in clumps until a thin film covers the beer. That's gone in another minute. Some bubbles attempt to lace during swigs, but nothing sticks.  S: Sweet, dark malts. I expected this to be like a melted Hershey's bar, but it's not. It's simply chocolate-forward without being ridiculous about it. Still has plenty of traditional RIS characteristics, like coffee and hints of dark fruits.  T: More chocolatey than the nose suggested. It doesn't have the cloying sweetness of some other chocolate stouts, but it definitely brings a lot of bittersweet cocoa beans to the table. They're fleshed out with bitter espresso flavors and a general feeling of char (though it's not exactly ashy). Try as I might, I could not pick up the dark fruits I smelled.  M: A bit of a warming effect from the ABV, but it's pretty well-hidden and smooth. Carbonation is modest, and the body is full in flavor, medium-full in heft.  D: I liked it, but I'd need to sit down and have it again before I could really make up my mind on where it falls in the chocolate stout spectrum. Expect a re-review of this one.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,kwjd,3.97,"Pours very dark brown, verging on black. Small tan head without much lacing. Smells mildly of chocolate and roasted malt.

This was from a 2009 bottle. I have several other bottles and I'll be interested to see how it ages.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

I wouldn't say this is a bad beer but it just comes across as simple to me. Sometimes this is a good thing but I expect more from a RIS.

Decent lacing and little carbonation evident.  s - Smells of chocolate, but smells somewhat mellowed out. Also smells of roasted malts and a little bit of coffee, but not was much as other people seemed to have smelled.  t - Tastes strongly of chocolate, roasted malts, and coffee. The coffee comes out a lot more in the taste than the smell. Tiny hints of alocohol and bitterness in the aftertaste.  m - Pretty thick and creamy. Full bodied with low carbonation.  d - I really like this beer; it's one of my favorite Brooklyn beers. Looks great and has a wonderfull full chocolate taste to it.

Great stout that I will certainly be trying again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Not very balanced, however. The carbonation is lopsided.  D - Not very drinkable because of the high ABV. It's also hard to drink fast because it's so potent. A decent beer, overall, but somewhat overrated in my opinion.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,rarbring,3.59,"The beer is dark brown, near black, the head is surprisingly small, beige leaving some lacing and curtains.  The smell is sweet dried plums, some sour milk (sic), burnt bread, woodsmoke, coffee and chocolate roasted beans.  The taste has the sweetness from a ripe cream sherry, roasted malt flavors and really bitter roasted seeds and coffee beans. The bitterness is rather sharp, and stays for quite a while.  This sample had low carbonation, but rather tingly small bubbles, and a dry finish.  It is a well made beer, but a bit to coarse bitterness, could benefit from a few years storing for my taste.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The coffee and chocolate blend really well together. I knew this was going to be a great beer from just smelling it. So many imperial stouts try to do this and some succeed and some ultimately fail.  Taste of coffee, CHOCOLATE, chocolate, and more chocolate. Barely any hops noticeable. Just a really smokey beverage.  The beverage is chewy but very smooth. The only thing that threw me off was after the first sip, it felt weird swallowing and most likely, that was due to my own fault of something I had to drink or eat earlier on. Either way, just a good brew.  Black, chocolate, coffee, smoke, goodness.  Drink up.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Appearance - Poured a deep and rich earthy darkness. Thick and foamy mocha colored head that was about an inch and a half thick. Remained strong for the duration of the consumption of this fine beverage.  Smell - Instantly picked up on the rich coffee and chocolate scents, along with nice dark roasted malts. The coffee smell however, pretty much overpowers all the other smells after it has been sitting for a few brief moments.  Taste - Tastes very chocolatey, almost like a carbonated chocolate coffee, with touches of malt, a very small touch of hops, and some rich dark fruity undertones.  Mouthfeel - Feels thick and creamy, just the way a proper stout should. Some excessive carbonation, but it dies down as the beverage sits.  Drinkability - Despite being 10% ABV, it goes down very smooth. The sweet tastes definitely mask the decent ABV. However, because of it's limited availability and sometimes steep price range (depending where you go), multiple drinks may be out of the question, but if you have the opportunity to drink this one, don't pass it up!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The aroma has a nice bit of fresh hop scent with dark chocolate and caramel.  The flavor profile is very nice, full of dark roasted grains, dark chocolate syrup, brownies, creamy caramel, raisins and dark plums. There is a pleasant bitterness on the finish and the alcohol is very well hidden and mixed into the flavor profile.  Mouthfeel is full, smooth, nicely chewy and creamy with ample fine carbonation. The feel is a touch chalky as well.  Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is one of the tops in the RIS category and this past years brewing is no exception.

45,680,ommegoose,4.25,"Winter '09-10 bottling. I thought it was a bit hot when it first came out, so I'm hoping a few months have helped.  Good start. About as black and thick as the style requires, although I have seen thicker and blacker. The head is more tan than brown, but it holds at a steady sheet.  Sweet and roasty. More milk chocolate than black. The nose of the bottle smelled like a Baltic porter, and some of that syrupy molasses character stayed with it. Could be stronger.  This is a roasty stout with nice dose of chocolate, but it pales compared to Choklat, which is the king of chocolate stouts. Hopping lends way more bitterness to this particular beer, but it goes well with the roasty flavors and doesn't impart clashing grapefruit or other citrus. This is a nice, balanced imperial stout. Definitely does show some black chocolate on the finish, with a pleasant dryness. Pretty nice. Borderline 4.5, but it's really quite an enjoyable beer. Rich roastiness is the highlight.  Smooth and nice, and the hotness has left for the most part. It fills the mouth well and has very soft carbonation. Not the thick tar of other stouts, but it's perfectly creamy.  Some aging has definitely done this well and mellowed the heat, I believe. Also, I think this benefits from being a bit cooler than I typically drink such strong beers at. The flavor is not as bludgeoning as a lot of 10% beers, so it goes down easy, and the flavor is not too huge. I'm a little disappointed they cut down to a four-pack, but this is still quite a good value and a beer worth buying. Easily worth the dollar more than Old Rasputin.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Dark brown hues can be seen when held up to the light. Nice thick light brown head lingers for a bit.  Smell - Toasted dark chocolate malt. Mouth watering to say the least.  Taste - True to it's aroma and it's name, nice toasty dark chocolate with some light nutty undertones. This is exactly what I hope for in a Russian Imperial Stout. As close to perfection for this style as I've had.  Mouthfeel - Mildly carbonated, which suits the style. Thick and heavy; a bit oily.  Drinkability - This is a bit of a tough brew to drink. It's very heavy, and for me, one is enough in a single sitting...definitely no more than two. Of course, this is to be expected with such a rich beer with a high alcohol content like this.

45,680,VikingBeer,4.03,"This is a review transcribed from the notebook I thought I lost last year and just found, which gave me the push to start reviewing again. 12-oz bottle of the '08-09 vintage, kept in the fridge for about a month and poured into my Duvel tulip.  A: 2-stage pour yields 1"" dark-tan head, receding to 1/2"" that stays in the glass and leaves thick lacing. Beer is black as hell and almost totally opaque.  S: A deep sniff opens with a blast of bitter/burnt chocolate malt, boozy alcohol, and a touch of STRONG Turkish coffee. The aroma lingers and evolves, with touches of rum, port, and dark cherries (chocolate-covered, perhaps?).  T: First sip brings a big hit of bittersweet chocolate and burnt malt upfront leading to boozy navy-rum flavors in the middle, with a sharp whiff of fusels going up my nose. On the back of my tongue comes the sweetness, with a slight ruby-port flavor and a hint of more cherries. Coffee notes prevail throughout, akin to the darkest of espresso beans covered with 85% chocolate. Aftertaste displays yet more complexity, with hints of dark-fruit Jelly Beans (whatever the hell those purple ones are). Hops appear mainly as a slight spiciness in the aftertaste, with hints of cinnamon, clove, and allspice. Subsequent sips seem to reveal a greater sweetness under all the sharp, bitter burnt-chocolate flavors.  M: Mouthfeel is excellent; smooth and slightly viscous, with just the right hint of carbonation.  D: Definitely a bit raw, especially compared to an aged '07-08 I had a few weeks ago (I reviewed it, but I lost the damn notes). Though I would only drink one of this fresh batch in a sitting, BBCS is still dangerously smooth-bodied and warming.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bbeerman,4.61,"A..A gorgeous dark brown, bordering on black. Reminds me of velvet.  S..Hints of chocolate and roasted malt. A slight hint of hops in my glass.  T..Amazing taste! The very dark chocolate taste hits at the beginning and the end of each sip and appears to evolve throughout the sip. This has to be the best chocolate beer I have enjoyed to date (compared with others like Young's Double Chocolate Stout, Ommegang Chocolate Indulgence), perhaps because I prefer dark chocolate...or perhaps because it is just that perfect. Dark malt flavor is also present.  M..Nice and heavy like a Russian Imperial Stout should be. This brew keeps getting better as I drink.  D..Easy to drink for a heavy Imperial Stout that has a 10% ABV. I would advise to take it easy since the ABV is so high, but that is easier said than done considering the marvelous taste of this near perfect recipe.

There's a slight bitter coffee and hops aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated (maybe slightly too much, though?) and warm going down. It's amazing that the ABV doesn't show through more given the high carbonation for the style.

A lighter black bordering on dark brown, with dark amber edges. When backlit, nearly half the body is transparent. The smell is good, but not as pungent as I like it to be. Lots of roasted and chocolate malts. Some black licorice perhaps, and some sweetness. A hint of hoppiness as well.  This one is a letdown. I'm not impressed at all. Very average RIS. The chocolate is much too bitter and seems to compete with the hop profile on that account. The beer is too roasty all the way through, not allowing for any sweetness to add complexity. Super dry all the way through. Some tobacco notes. Not very complex, and not very interesting.  The mouthfeel is thicker than it looks, and even a little bit more carbonated than the lack of head would allow you to believe. It's decent, but leaves the palate and the tongue really dry. For drinkability I've averaged the taste and mouthfeel scores, because both contribute to how much I would drink of this beer, and neither is particularly outstanding.

The taste follows the nose fairly well with the dark, bittersweet chocolate dominating, and coffee and roasted malts hiding in the background. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, and fits well with the rest of the flavors.  The mouthfeel is fairly smooth, but does have a decent amount of carbonation. This finishes with a good alcohol burn, and you can feel it go down your throat, and warm you as you drink.

Not as complex as the nose, nor as inviting, but still quite enjoyable. Covers the mouth thickly and lingers. Lightly carbonated. Makes an enjoyable sipper on a Friday in winter.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,irishking1977,3.65,"A: Evil looking black liquid with a small tan head that disappears, leaving moderate lacing. Above average looking RIS.  S: Mild, bitter chocolate notes. Some malt as well. Sweet, sugary aromas are barely perceivable, but it's there nonetheless.  T: Smoky/sweet maltiness and some bitter chocolate. Caramel and coffee finish. Decent RIS, but nothing earth shattering. They should probably put the word ""chocolate"" in really small print, because other than chocolate malts that were probably used, there is no substantial chocolate taste to this brew. Just mild bitter chocolate notes.  M: Chalky and less than moderately carbonated. Not as filling as it appears. Which is a good thing.  D: Surprisingly drinkable, even with a 10% + abv. Alcohol is completely hidden, which means to me that this one is brewed with balance in mind. Deceiving brew, good balance, but lacking a bit in taste. Would probably be a good introduction to someone attempting to get into stouts.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,rtratzlaff,4.08,"Reviewed in a Duvel snifter with a 6 oz. pour from a 12 oz. bottle.  A rather hard pour produces a black body that opaque along with a tan billowy head that isn't chunky, but flat.  Aromas of roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, not really any hop aromas.  Tasted is bittersweet chocolate and dark roast coffee. Initially sweet and and bitter on the finish. Some alcohol heat is noticeable in the finish. Perhaps a hint of smokiness as well. The alcohol heat builds with warmth. I would love this aged, but right now it drinks a bit rough.  Mouthcoating is tremendous. Full bodied and chewy. After recently having Sexual Chocolate, this beer is not quite as big and full, but they are similiar beers. Aging about a year or so does them well.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,alkemy,4.38,"Dark opaque brown pour with a darkish tan head. Dark burnt orange highlighting on the edges of the glass when held to light. Lots of sweet malt in the nose. Dark fruits like raisin, fig, and cherry. The scent gives off the aroma of a high ABV brew. I've got to honest here, I didn't get any chocolate aromas until after I had a drink. I get a sour cherry note first and a lingering coffee/espresso last. In between there is some roasty burnt goodness and more of the dark fruits...maybe a touch of prune juice. Alcohol is supremely well hidden. This is very smooth and rich. I really dig the taste...probably because it's a slightly different interpretation of the style.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mostpoetsdo,4.43,"A: An incredibly dark brown, with big, thick, frothy, tan head that leaves behind great brown rings of lacing.  S: Big chocolate aroma, followed by some major boozy notes.  T: Huge flavor of chocolate and malt, just great. Nice roasted flavor, a hint of coffee backing, more mocha, I guess. Can't say enough positive things about this. Slight after taste of booze at the end, in a good way.  M: A great full body, excellent creaminess. The high ABV is masked incredibly well.  D: It doesn't get much better than Brooklyn BCS. Incredibly enjoyable, watch out for the 10%+ ABV. Sit down on a cold day and drink away.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,steve8robin,3.95,"Been trying this one for a while. Decided to do the official review...  A: Perfectly pitch black with a tiny mocha head that quickly fades.  S: Smells good. I get chocolate, raisin, and oakiness upfront. Not as strong of a scent as I'd like, but a great scent once I get a handle on it.  T: Good taste. Hops upfront with a hint of subtle chocolate on the backend. Good brew.  M: A hint too much carbonation for my taste, but still decent.  D: Goes down fairly easy. Hops make it a little heavy upfront, but otherwise good.  All in all, this is a good easy-to-attain brew. If you're looking for a dark brew that is easy to drink and still get a nice buzz, then this is definitely your beer. Awesome to get a 4 pack and cherish on your taste buds.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mothman,4.15,"Winter 09-10 bottle. 10% abv.  Poured into Bruery snifter.  Pours about a finger of tan head. Fades to a thinner layer, but leaves some really nice lace walls. Color pours a dark copper brown, but in the class it is completely black.  Aroma: Lots of dark chocolate and cocoa right off the top. Some cherries, raisins, roasted malts. The aroma is very sweet, almost like candy. There is also some bitter hops in the background. I am really enjoying the aroma of this one.  Taste: Very roasted and toasty in a good way. It is a cold winter night and this beer is keeping me warm. Lots of rich coffee and caramel malty flavors. The grassy hops are a lot more present in the taste. Some light tart cherries are present along with a hint of molasses. Again, a sweet taste, but not as sweat as the aroma. It is almost a delicate RIS and I like it for that.  Mouthfeel: Bitter and roasted. Pretty full bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. Ends very dry and roasted.  Overall, this was a very solid beer. I drank it near cellar temp which was a good idea. I got a lot of flavors and it seemed to be a more unique RIS. I really liked it and can't wait to see what a year will do to this one. Fairly drinkable as well.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Has a dryer finish with a lingering notes from the chocolate malt.  M- Creamy, smooth and very full.  D- Definitely a top-notch RIS; great with some Stilton blue.

45,680,Richardberg,4.01,"A - poured into a pint glass. Thick and absolutely jet black regardless of lighting. No head at first but as the pour settled a small, dense, dark brown foam appeared. Didn't last very long or leave any lacing though.  S - dark chocolate syrup, hint of black cherry  T - strong character of roasty boozy malts. bitter side is more coffee-like than chocolaty. has some syrupy sweetness counterbalancing things, though, and even a slight fruitiness toward the end. definitely finishes bitter though.  M - thick, heavy, sticky...in short, decadent. A little more creaminess (a la oatmeal stouts) would make it ""perfect"" (to my personal preference), albeit outside the RIS standard. As a straight up style exemplar, its feel is darn near perfect.  D - the ABV is definitely noticeable but there's nothing gratuitous about the strength. Just the right match for this depth of flavor, without becoming hard to finish. Wouldn't have more than one, but that's not the point.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,morimech,4.17,"My bottle is the 07-08 vintage.  Pours very dark almost solid black with one inch of dense mocha colored head. The head did not have the greatest retention before settling to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass.  Rich aroma of roasted and chocolate malt. Hints of dark fruit, coffee, and brown sugar. Alcohol is barely noticed.  The flavor was not as robust as the aroma but it still is quite good. More coffee than chocolate. Bittersweet throughout. Faint whisps of smoke. Hints of cherries and dark fruit. Alcohol remarkably is kept in check and does not get in the way of the malt flavor.  Big and bold in body. Very nice texture. Silky and smooth.  For such a big, high ABV stout it is remarkably drinkable. My bottle had a couple of years to age, and it aged well.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Chocolate comes through as well. Alot of stuff going on here. Notes of sweet dark fruits.  T: Mmmm, dark chocolate flavors with the traditional roasted barley. Not as dominate of stout flavor as others I've had with the same ABV. I couldn't really detect the alcohol at all. Rich sweet flavors with a minimal hop bite in the finish.  M: Creamy and thick. Feels like a dessert going down.  D: Tough to say I would want more than one of these in a sitting.

45,680,zac16125,4.3,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: A , pours an opaque almost jet black, with a massive 2+ finger width coffee colored head, that was very bubbly. Decent retention that dissipated to a thick film. Moderate lacing.  Smell: A , Strong milk chocolate and coffee aromas. Wonderful aroma.  Taste: A- , The initial sip is packed in with flavor. Strong expresso character with an earthy malt balance. After the initial sip the malt characters being to take over giving an earthy, grassy taste to the beer. The milk chocolate I expected from the smell never really comes outs, but as the beer warms in hand the roasted flavors begin to come out, and the dark chocolate characters strengthen to balance out the unpleasant grassy accents that dominated earlier in the drink. This beer definately gets better as it warms. The coffee flavors finally come back towards the end of the drink, and the alcohol that was masked very well also shows towards the very end. Finishes very strong, which was a pleasant surpirse.  Mouthfeel: A, medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation, and a smoothness towards the end that I really enjoyed.  Drinkability: A , it does a good job of hiding the ABV and is very drinkable despite the strong complex flavors.  Overall this is a very good beer. Not my favorite RIS but its up there. Definately worth a try, and I will be sure to try this one again in the future.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S - Roasted malts and cocoa dominat the nose, with a very noticeable alcohol aroma throughout, as to be expected of an IRS.  T - Roasted malts and chocolate malts mixed coat the palate. Very thick. The chocolate malts do not come through the mix nearly enough though. The alcohol content becomes very apparent in the finish. As far as IRS's go, this one does not hide the alcohol as well as others. Very delicious flavor overall.  M - Heavy bodied with a bit more carbonation than expected. Very smooth considering the carbonation and abv.  D - Not the best IRS available but still highly enjoyable. Great flavor and smooth thick body. I thought there would be more of a chocolate malt presence in the taste, but IMO the roasted malts dominated the flavor.

Aggressive pour created espresso cloud with lacing that dotted the glass throughout. Smells of coffee, and deeply roasted almost burnt malt. Hints of dark chocolate, but neither chocolate nor coffee is overwhelming here, more dark roasted malt, which I prefer over the Founders Breakfast Stout, which is more overt with coffee and chocolate.  Good mouthfeel, more carbonated than expected, and noticeable alcohol, definitely a one-per for me.

45,680,Beertracker,4.28,"Brooklyn BCS pours up with a lively carbonation that creates a incredibly inviting tannish-mocha colored head that completely envelops the opaque brownish black body. Simply marvelous! The heavily chocolate aroma is quite complex with notes of rich toffee, toasted walnuts, cocoa nibs & plenty of coffee/espresso notes. A touch of fruity cherry-vanilla & a noticeable warmth add to the overall complexity. This one just gets better as it warms in hand. The smooth flavor starts off with an initial rush of caramel & chocolate sweetness that gives way to a solid roasted graininess with coffee & espresso notes marked by a light underlying bitterness. This one continues to grow on the palate, but dries out slightly towards the bittersweet, warming finish. This medium-full bodied Imperial Stout has long been one of my favorites. I've had this one many times before, but it still continues to impress. Garrett Oliver's BBCS is a hallmark of consistant quality which others can only dream. ""Imperialism at its strongest!""

Chocolate- bittersweet and milk chocolate flavors. Lactose is fairly noticeable along with coffee and dark fruit hints.

45,680,Andreji,4.05,"Purchased at the food emporium in NYC.  Pour is a classic stout body, very dark skinned and opaque with little visible carbonation and a tan head much worthy of the cocoa-ish style its meant to portray.  smell is probably the best thing. it's definetly chocolatey, but rather like hershey's dark chocolate moreso than perhaps a cote d'or. semi-synthetic feel but i grant them it's a fine example because pulling off the chocolate feel isn't an easy task i'm sure).  the taste, instead, isn't chocolatey enough. nonetheless it's a dark roasted malt and coffee feel all over, very deep and bitter nonetheless palatable and certainly consonant with the style. props, however, a bit lacking on the chocolate (i'm personally biased since i've had the xocoan birracao).  full bodied nonetheless, for us cocoa drinkers this is quite a decent experience. kudos to brooklyn, impressed twice in one afternoon.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,NightINgale,4.35,"355ml/12oz bottle poured into a small snifter...  A - Very impressive! Creamy brown head over an opaque dark brown body. Very impressive lacing and decent head retention.  S - Obviously very chocolatey-smelling. Strong hints of vanilla, some roasted coffee beans, and a touch of smoke. Very low on hop character, unsurprisingly, though there is a slight floral scent.  T - Starts out with an impressive chocolate taste, with a sweetness well-balanced. Espresso-like coffee notes follow, then making room for some dark fruit notes. The sweetness sort of carries through into the after-taste, which is very well-balanced in terms of bitterness. After a few moments, the beer also develops a smoky flavour to it. What impressed me the most is the chocolate flavour, which was achieved solely from a variety of malts, with no flavourings or extracts...  M - Medium-to-full body to it. Initially the carbonation is quite high, but then it quickly drops in level, making the beer very smooth. The alcohol taste becomes quite apparent after a while, which is yet logical for a 10% beer.  D - Good, as long as you drink this in moderation. A very good Imperial Stout, this beer is indeed a perfect winter warmer. Try it with vanilla ice-cream, or with some quality dark chocolate.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Pahn,4.47,"12oz bottle into Duvel tulip.  Appearance: Moderate pour yields a 3/4 inch pillowy tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves small rings of lacing. Color is black with reddish edges when held to the light.  Smell: Dark chocolate, hot alcohol, espresso, with a hint of raisin.  Taste: A sweet hit of roasted malt, mocha coffee, some raisin notes, then back to roasted malt. The malt profile is smokey and deep. Each sip is characterized by subtle shifts in dark flavors ending with a beautiful marriage of alcohol warmth and smokey roasted malt. Occasionally quite sweet and often rich, but very well-balanced. Small hop bite in the middle.  Interestingly (to me at least), there's chocolate present in most of the flavors, but it never tastes like a chocolate drink or chocolate bar; here's some chocolaty coffee, here's some chocolate caramel, here's raisins infused with chocolate, etc. Everything is accented with chocolate, it's beautiful. Also beautiful is the way each flavor seamlessly blends into each other flavor, creamy and smokey, ending with a nice alcohol warmth that doesn't overwhelm the malt finish.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy, with bright carbonation balancing the mild thickness.  Drinkability: Excellent. It's very easy drinking despite the high ABV; the alcohol is noticeably present, but not burning or aggressive. I would (and do) buy this beer often.  Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is a fantastic beer. It delivers exactly what I want from an imperial stout: enticing aroma, big, complex, but balanced flavor, creamy mouthfeel, with some pleasant alcohol warmth.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S: Lots of dark chocolate with mild notes of dark roasted malt and alcohol.  T: VERY good, but not as complex as I expected with the label comparing it to (or labeling it as?) a russian imperial stout. Sweet, chewy malts up front, followed by dark and milk chocolate notes and a nice alcohol presence. Finish has a nice dryness to balance the initial sweetness with a hint of baking cohcolate like bitterness.  M: Full bodied with moderately high carbonation - more than is typical of the style, but I like it. Finish is clean.  D: For 10% ABV this is definitely drinkable.

Quite black, but not inky dark. You can just make out some brown at the edges of the glass when held up to the light, but just barely.  Smell: Starts off chocolate (almost cocoa like) but then you get a strong raisin and maybe just a hint of spice (cinnamon?) at the end. Can't place what is at the end, but the whole thing is quite appetizing.  Taste: Starts off tasting like a chocolate covered espresso bean, but with some alcohol notes at the end. It's like drinking a chocolate liquor at times, but more satisfying in a swig than a sip. Really quite impressive.  Mouthfeel: Just a hint of carbonation on the tongue, and quite creamy and smooth. A pleasant thickness.  Drinkability: I view this a desert beer at its finest. You could have it with a meal (like a burger and milkshake type of thing) but I think you want this to end the meal on a good note. The alcohol content is too high to have more than one though.

Its very complex and rich. Unfortunately, a heavy metallic taste about midway through the taste that also shows up in the finish. Its too bad because it really takes away from the taste.

Nose was fully of chocolate and a smooth roast, with a hint of coffee. this was very appealing after some of the other seasonal stouts I had this year. Once I tasted this, I was far from disappointed as this is easily the best winter seasonal of this year I have had so far.

45,680,feelmefoam,4.46,"Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass.  Brooklyn's BCS pours a thick, inky midnight black with no highlights to speak of, even when held up to the light in my living room. The beer surprised me a bit by putting up over an inch-and-a-half of thick, creamy mocha-colored head that took a long time to dissipate, but when it did it left beautiful thick rings of tan, sticky lacing clinging to the outside of the glass. The awesome head bumped this brew up to a 5 on the looker scale.  The aroma boasts rich dark malts laced with cocoa and black coffee, but it's kind of subtle. Not too much hoppiness, but that's quite alright for this style of beer.  When BCS hits your tongue, you can understand some of the hype surrounding this beer. Dark malts present up front are accompanied by chocolate-covered espresso beans, which bring a bit of sweet bitterness into the mix. A fleeting amount of dark fruit flavor is present as well, but is very short lived. A warming alcohol tingle follows the beer down your throat, giving a pleasant sensation as you finish each sip, but certainly not overpowering the flavor of the stout.  The mouthfeel is just what I would expect of a big, flavorful RIS. Thick, syrupy, and smooth at the same time, with the light amounts of carbonation complementing the slight alcohol tingle given at the end of each gulp.  This is a very well-done beer, put together by a brewery who I haven't had much experience with as of yet, but will certainly look for more in the future. Drinkability is only inhibited by the high ABV, otherwise I would be tempted to have several of these in a sitting. Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout is a bold yet sweet sipper of a stout that is inviting from the pour to the last drop.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

It looks particularly interesting.  The s,mell is filled with rich, sweet dark scents, chocolate, alcohol, sugar, roasted malt, and a hint of coffee.  The flavor has a bit more coffee than the smell, but there is also a nice hit of chocolate and roasted malt. The mouthfeel is decent, not the best for a Russian Imperial Stout but it is ok. The alcohol isn't that noticeable cranking the drinkability up slightly.  It is a pretty good beer, in the middle of the pack for RIS, it was better the first time I had it, but I will save some bottles, this one will age well.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

It poured like thick syrup and tasted divine.  12/18/14 Review 12oz bottle in a large snifter at fridge temps. This is the second time I'm reviewing this beer. I have a few more to cellar. The date on this beer is Winter 2014/2015.  Appearance: poured like viscous motor oil, black as night with no light penetrating, no head to speak of at all, I can not believe how black this beer is.  Nose: chocolate, nutty, barrel aging, alcohol, toasted oak, slight coffee  Taste: creamy mouthfeel, velvety, chocolate, coffee, toasted nuts, just enough hop bitterness to cut through the rich texture. Very slight carbonation, just enough to lift the heaviness of this beer off your tongue. Warming alcohol finish.  This is truly a master's class in Imperial Stouts. Garret Oliver spent time in England studying brewing and it truly shows in this classic English style stout fit for royalty. My only gripe would be the lack of carbonation. I feel it needs a little more considering the weight of the brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,WhiteOak,4.08,"Batch brewed for Winter 09-10  Glass- Riedel 6416/07  A- Opaque black/brown. The head is a nice, very dark brown with some lace.  S- Choclate covered raisins, cola. Faint vanilla note, which faded.  T- Big, extracted, sweet roasted malt (and, I applaud, NOT burnt to a char). Bitter espresso, black coffee. Good, straightforward flavors. Lingering finish is dominated by bitter coffee flavor and a touch too much hop bitterness.  M, D- ABV masked. I found the CO2 to be heavy-handed and fizzy.  Comment: This year's batch I found to be better than a few I have had before, those exhibiting a weird moldy off-smell. The Winter 09-10 seemed cleaner in this regard.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,eljefe21,4.2,"A: Black, opaque liquid with a tan, light brown head. Liquidy, fine bubbles lace the sides of the glass.  S: Alcohol and chocolate flavors hit the nose and warm the chest. I'm a little hesitant to taste this.  T: Strong, dark chocolate flavors fill the mouth. The slightest hint of alcohol, but nothing like the nose of the beer would led me to believe. I had this one before and wasn't thrilled, but this time around I am.  M: The thick liquid is heavy and coating. Smooth and barely carbonated. Warming and relaxing.  D: Faced with a cold winter day? This is a beer for you. Not as sweet as some other chocolate stouts I've had, and which I like better, but a great imperial stout none the less.  Served: in a cervoise glass.

S: Bittersweet chocolate, booze, licorice, bready burnt caramel malt.  T: Huge chocolate flavor profile, lots of depth, starts with a harsh bittersweet, then fades into milk chocolate and then into a black licorice mixed with a boozy alcohol and a lingering finish of bittersweet chocolate.  M: Heavy body that starts off very smooth and then the carbonation kicks in and comes on strong with the flavors and then finishes smooth.  D: This is a very smooth RIS and pretty drinkable, the booziness is there but only adds to the complexity.

45,680,mooseisloose,4.85,"This brew caught my eye walking into TW, so let's give it a whirl. Popping the top yields a great butterscotch smell characteristic of HG brews. There are also hints of red licorice. The brew pours to a jet black with a tan multi-sized bubble head. On the taste this brew is heavenly to say the least. Chocolate is indeed the forte of the flavor and it is evident from start to finish with different flavors throughout. The brew starts with a black licorice and semisweet chocolate flavor folllowed by a more tart and flatter unsweetened chocolate flavor and finishing with a bitter but sweet milk chocolate with a licorice kicker. This is one HG brew, all throughout the taste the AC is warming and evident not unlike a chocolate licor, hence the licorice flavors. I think I could stand outside naked in -20 degree weather drinking one of these brews and not bat an eye. This is a serious stout, the flavors are beyond incredible.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,robobor,4.2,"I love this beer. Pours dark and smooth, with a head whose color reminds me of peanut butter. Smells darkly sweet with chocolate and faint licorice. Tastes similar to the smell, dark chocolate, nicely sweet, but with an unfortunately burnt bitter taste on the finish. There's some very slight licorice on the mouth too, but not cloying sweet licorice like Good and Plenty, more like fresh fennel. I highly recommend this beer and am hoping that the couple of bottles I put aside benefit from some aging.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Two-finger caramel head rides the top all the way through the first half of the glass, then some nice lacing for the second half.  S: Some malts, some chocolate. Slightly sweet but was hoping for more.  T: A wave of semi-sweet chocolate with a slightly bitter roasted malt aftertaste. Not too much of an alcohol presence for a beer clocking in at 10.0% ABV. Gets even better with repeated sips.  M: Not too thick, not too watery. Just right.

Some (rye) whiskey flavors as it warms.  M - Big bodied, creamy.  D - Pretty boozy, big bodied, definitely a sipper. I was looking forward to trying this one and kind of got let down in the end.

A very strong malty aroma with small chocolate smell. The taste starts malty and finishes with a bitter coffee taste.

45,680,jampics2,3.44,"Beer #4 of my 2010 Winking Lizard Beer Tour.  This great looking beer was brought to me in a chalice. Black body and small head. Looks great!  Smell is OK. Not too heavy on the roast, molasses, chocolate. VERY noticeable alcohol in the scent. Caustic ethanol singes my nose. WTF, how is this SO hot?  Thankfully the taste wasn't as bad as the nose indicated. Dark malt, chocolate patent, nice overall flavor profile. Unfortunately, as this warms, a very strong taste of vodka in the aftertaste. This needs to chillax for a few years, but almost annoyingly hot in its young form.  Nice mouthfeel. Perfect carb and nice density.  If it wasn't as hot, I would rate this MUCH higher. Still lots of classic tastes and overall profile, but needs to cool its jets.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,BeerFMAndy,4.4,"12 oz bottle poured into an Imperial Pint. 10% ABV, ""Limited Bottling Winter 09-10""  Thanks to Sweemzander for this awesome bottle!  A - Clear dark brown on the pour and black as midnight in the glass. Even with the tall pour, it was silent, almost like syrup flowing out. A small bit of cascading lead to a damn-near three-finger dark tan head with solid retention and beautiful clumpy lace all over the glass.  S - Dark and heavy roasted malts on the nose without the sharp, dry bitterness. Cocoa and bittersweet chocolate with a touch of molasses and a pinch of brown sugar. A light-handed addition of hops gives a very faint aroma.  T - Thick and rich dark roasted malts give off the dry bitterness the nose was lacking. A touch of coffee bean with molasses and a good helping of semi-sweet chocolate chunk is in here too. Almost no alcohol is present which leaves the finish with a dry bitterness of coffee.  M - This is as full-bodied as they come. Rich and thick, the carbonation is the only thing keeping it from feeling like syrup. The finish is dry and bitter and the only bit of alcohol comes into play later when it warms up your stomach.  D - Sipping one for a while will suffice nicely. It's a fantastic brew I haven't had in over a year. Very nicely crafted and amazingly delicious. Much thanks to Sweem for this one!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Hypersomnia,4.3,"Poured into a Samuel Adams Boston Lager Perfect Pint glass.  Black as night, light brown head, good head retention.  First impressions just sniffing it from the bottle is ""YUM, tons of chocolate!'. Nice dark chocolate aroma, hard for me to describe much else but it does smell like a really good Russian Imperial Stout. I really like the smell of this beer, pretty awesome. I keep detecting a yeastiness in the background that I quite like.  Just sipping the head at first I'd have to say this is extremely good. Taste is much lighter than I was expecting but extremely good and the mouthfeel was really nice. Tastes quite a bit like chocolate (dark not milk). After taking the first real sip my reaction was, ""Mmm... that's pretty good"". This beer is quite tasty, though still surprisingly light (but that makes it a bit more drinkable, because it's not thick and overpowering and overbearing).  Finish is nice, light chocolatey / coffee flavor but not very strong.  Holy crap, just got lots of ""Mmmm""'s out of me. Wow this is really good now that I let it warm up to what I believe is the right temperature. I'm very impressed. This is an excellent beer.  The warmer the better on this one, the warmer it gets the more tasty it gets.  Highly recommended, particularly given the price point.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,nokes,4.42,"Poured into a Belgian ale glass, nearly opaque and very dark brown. Thin tan/brown head of small bubbles, looks fine but not overly impressive, though it leaves nice lacing on the glass.  Smell...ooohhh...yummy. Deep earthy tones of bittersweet chocolate and coffee, roasted grains, and toffee that's reached just the right temperature. Very nice.  The taste is the same as the smell, but moreso. Rich dark chocolate, with just the right blend of sweet and bitter. Wow...I like this beer rather a lot. 10% alcohol? Really? Yeah, there's some there, but 10%? This is very dangerous beer.  This beer is smooth, velvety, very nice overall, though a little thinner than I might have expected. Not sure that's a bad thing...it lightens up what could have felt perhaps too viscous.  Drinkability is superb. Like I said, dangerous. Not a quaffing beer, of course, but a person could sip this all night. I found myself wanting to just nurse it along endlessly, a few little munchies to cleanse the palate, and then have it again, like it was the first sip, over and over. Really nice.  This is a beer I would happily drink again. I think I'll go look around to see if I can get a few more to carry me through the winter. Recommended, definitely.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jeffthecheff,4.22,"Coming out of the bottle this is black, with some light coming through making it dark brown. Once it hits the glass it is all black. The head is a dark tan color and ends up becoming a thin ring around my Brooklyn tulip.  The aroma has a huge, charred character to it from the roasted malts. It smells like the malt is still being cooked. Behind all the roast is the expected dark chocolate notes, and a hefty but pleasant fruitiness.  The beer is sweet in the middle with some big chocolate notes along with some sweet fruitiness. It reminds me of a chocolate covered cherry or raspberry. The finish is somewhat dry and roasty with some solid bitterness contributing some slight coffee flavors. There is also some lingering dark fruit flavors in the finish.  The mouthfeel is smooth and silky with a big, mouth coating body. The moderate carbonation lightens the impact on this beer quite a bit. When I shook out most of the carbonation, the beer seems a lot bigger and sweeter, and the drinkability suffers. I'd love to try this with some chocolate covered raspberries.  Aging notes:  I had a vertical of this beer going back 6 years, and from memory I think one year is the sweet spot. After a year, there is a slight mint character that gets stronger and stronger with each year. It's a positive attribute after two years but gets weird after that. After over a year, it loses it's vibrancy and becomes duller, with oxidation notes getting stronger, which isn't a good thing.  I took notes from a side by side with 2009 vs, 2008, and I found the year old bottle to have more of a dark fruitiness in the nose which seems to bring out the dark chocolates more. The fresh version has more vibrancy in the nose. The flavor of the 2008 has more dark chocolate notes with a smoother mouthfeel. It seems a bit thinner, and the alcohol is very well hidden. One or two years max on this beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MrIncognito,4.12,"A - Black as night and I really couldn't get any light to come through. Thick tan head that leaves incredible lacing. Thick and oily body.  S - Big dark roasted malts with dark cocoa powder in the back. Mildly bitter hop aroma and light alcohol that is drowned out by the other smells.  T&M - Dark roasted malts come out first but a bit sweeter than the smell. Bittersweet dark chocolate powder and light alcohol. Thick and oily mouthfeel with medium-light carbonation but more prickly than expected. Slightly bitter lingering aftertaste that carries some sweetness with it.  D - I didn't know what the ABV was when I drank this and I definitely didn't think it was over 10%. Alcohol is masked very well and very dangerous. A delicious beer and the chocolate really adds a nice dimension. Doesn't come across as a chocolate drink or as a syrup additive.

T - Sweet roasted malt and coffee with a hint of chocolate. Alcohol is detectable but not overpowering.  M - Smooth with a slightly bitter finish.  D - A very solid stout.

Just got in from having my car towed to the repair shop in -20 weather and I needed a good strong beer...  Pours an inky black hue, leaving about an inch of thick, light tan head. Slow to dissolve, leaves lots of good lacing. Fine retention.  The smell is definitely black everything: black, dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts. Maybe a bit of fruit near the back.  Starts with roasted malt at the front, coffee and chocolate, followed by warming alcohol. A touch of butterness to the finish.  Viscous, almost chewy. A bit stingy, but my lips are chapped so I won't blame the beer.  Very impressed with this; one of the tastier RIS I've had in a while. Good stuff, looking forward to more from this brewery!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Minotaur,4.35,"Black and dense with a nice thick looking white one finger head. It dissolves quickly to a beige foam ring and skim. Little light passes through this brew.  The smell is of bitter cocoa and coffee; it is heady and dense smelling like a dessert.  The flavor is less sweet and chocolate and more of a earthy, bitter like espresso. it is layered with just hint of sweetness, roasted flavors, and a vague spiciness. There is some bitter hop presence that adds another layer of sourness and sharpness that greatly compliments the bitter cocoa flavors.  It is thick and rich in the mouth: milky and smooth that gives a sweet finish.  The alcohol is present in the warmth and finish but it is all in all a highly drinkable stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,advill88,4.32,"Appearance is pitch black with a thick mocha colored head.  Smell is dominated by roasted malt with rich characters of chocolate and hints of bourbon.  Taste is again dominated upfront by roasted malt with a good hit of bitterness, followed by hints of bourbon and caramel, with maybe a touch of vanilla. Cycles back around to the roasted malt at the end, but showcasing a little more of its sweet character. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, and the carbonation is a little higher than I'd usually expect from such a heavy stout.  Highly drinkable RIS; at 10% ABV, the alcohol is well-hidden.

It dissipated to a solid cap and left sheets of lacing behind. Very nice. The smell is all dark sour fruits, alcohol and chocolate malts. It's good but not as good as the taste which is a big dose of chocolate, coffee and malts. Lovely.  Mouthfeel is spot on I think.. velvety smooth and goes down far too fast for a beer of this strength. This aids drinkability.. you could have another before the full potency even hits you.

45,680,MaxBrews,4.33,"I've tasted both a both a 2008-09 and 2009-010 vintage and I'll compare them in this review.  Poured into a pint glass.  Pours with a big 3 finger brown head if you pour it properly. Beer is pitch black, the lacing dissipates slowly and a nice tan lacing sticks around and clings to the glass.  The 2008 vintage is slightly less alcoholic smelling then the 2009. Both feature plenty of roasted malt in chocolate. More chocolate and raisins come out in the 2008. The aroma smells of dark chocolate, licorice, raisins and roasted malt.  Taste is much of the same. Strong alcoholic taste, followed by dark choclate, raisins and alcohol. A lingering chocolate taste.  Carbonation is that of a stout. This beer ends pretty dry due to the levels of roasted malt and high alcohol content. Overall hop bitterness is very low.  The aged version of this beer drinks like a good stout. You'd want to session it, but it'll do your head in. 2010 version is a bit overwhelming with alcohol, you know you're drinking an RIS. Overall a strong stout with plenty of flavor. The perfect beer for a cold night or to curl up in bed with a book.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Mouthfeel is medium-full with a decent amount of carbonation.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TerryW,2.62,"I'm afraid I have to go against the grain here as I didn't find this to be a particularly good beer. I usually enjoy Brooklyns, but this one just came across as a poorly put together effort. Its got too many harsh extremes without a lot of the good stuff of a properly made chocolate porter.  Out of the bottle it looks beautiful. Dark walnut colour with a monster big, good looking head. The head settles to a film and offers up some nice lace as you're drinking.  Nose is dark fruit, malt, chocolate and coffee, but its marred by aggressive notes of alcohol. Smells a bit like a barley wine. Slightly syrupy.  The brew has a very sharp sour bite to it early on, and is not anything like most other porters. That softens after the beer sits for a while, but is really off-putting. Mellows out, but still fairly harsh. Tarry in character and still too boozy.  Just too disjointed. Doesn't hang together in any sort of interesting way. Not for me, definitely not an introductory brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,demcorhip,4.05,"A good looking stout, almost one finger worth of head formed on the pour, very reminiscent of the crema atop some espresso. Retention isnt that great, it breaks down to leave a thin collar.  The nose is very interesting, nice roasted notes, has me thinking milk chocolate and espresso. Some fruity esters also present, black grape and plum like. Hint of nutty malts and some leafy hops also present.  Damn good stuff. Much like the nose, but there is a nice hint of anise and char near the finish. Creamy chocolate covered raisins, or perhaps chocolate covered grape bubblicious. Interesting and very tasty.  Good mouthfeel, full body, and nicely balanced. Once again im impressed.  This is pretty drinkable for a big beer. Their are hints at the ABV, but most of them come from the warming effect, which is welcome on the second last day of December. Somewhat restrained compared to other versions of the style, which helps its drinkability, as well as demonstrating the talent of the brewer. This one isnt hiding behind tonnes of molasses or hops. Certainly recommended. Also quite the bargain, relatively speaking.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The aroma is slightly of choclate, but it is not a very strong smelling beer.  The taste is much more subdued than I thought it would be. Almost more sour than sweet. I had a Young's double choclate stour earlier this week and the two beers aren't really that close in taste at all. Light tasting for a high abv beer, it tastes similar to a standard bock instead of what I associate with a RIS.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Has an oaky presence to it. Smells sweet like molasses and burnt caramel.  Lots of chocolate with a good backing of bitter hops. Sweet molasses and hint of maple syrup with deep toasted chocolate malt. Pretty light on the coffee which is fine with me. Can taste some oaky bourbon barrel in this too.  Creamy smooth mouthfeel, but maybe just a hair thin for the style.  About as drinkable as an RIS can be. This is an all around solid beer. I will have to track down some more of this in the future.

Deep, dark chocolates and roasted coffee notes singe the nose. Other notes waft around...bourbon?! It can't be, there shouldn't be. Dark, dark cerry-esque smells in the back? There is some sort of fruit present, call me crazy.  T- Yup, just as I remember it...dessert in a glass. There is a velvetiness to the chocolate taste that while not masking, actually evens out the dark-bitterness very well! That velvetiness continues on the second sip, and the beer is still quite chilled. I wonder when it warms a bit...eek! Roasted coffee, dark nuts and fruits come to mind with this beast.  M- Umm, if you've been reading you know I'm sensing a ""velvety"" character in this beer. Mouth-coating and all-encompassing.  D- A sipper by the book. Let this one warm slowly, more characters find their way into it's story and twist the plot so fiendishly. She's 10%...be aware.  Mr. Oliver, well done sir.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,augustgarage,4.3,"Obtained in trade from ShogoKawada (many thanks!). 2009 vintage, 10% ABV. Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass.  Lightless seal brown liquid with very faint mahogany highlights around the edges. Dense, creamy, camel layer of foam with tiny equal bubbles receding to a sticky upcurled collar and a few larger bubbles punctuating the surface of carbonated oil slick. Pointilist lacing no real legs...  Chocolate malt, roast malt, cocoa puffs, vanilla bean, cinnamon stick, toasted rye bread, and hints of steel-cut oats in the nose.  Light-roast coffee, deeply roasted chocolate malt, black bread, burnt rye whiskey, and an almost steak-like savory char mid-palate. Hints of 20 year old+ dark rum. Dry, roasty finish, well balanced by the hops. Not nearly as sweet, nor as bitter as I imagined. Reminds me more of a fine dry export stout than it does a RIS. Miles away from the overwhelming layers of flavorful potency on display from The Abyss for example, but don't mistake the elegent simplicity for a lack of character.  Immense, chewy, very warming mouthfeel with perfect carbonation.  Big, hearty, brash film-noir of a beer - great work from Brooklyn brewery. Looking forward to seeing how this ages - thanks again ShogoKawada!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BruMeister,4.6,"An excellent beer in my opinion. This beer is one to be respected due to it's high ABV (10.1%). Not an easy one to follow, so I usually make this one the last of the evening. The hops nicely round out the maltiness of this full bodied Imperial Stout. I have the good fortune to have it available on tap at two of my favorite bars.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,vacax,4.07,"12 oz. bottle, 2009-2010 release. Pours dark brown with one finger of light brown head. Fair retention and little lacing. Smells of chocolate malts, chocolate cake, dark fruits, grapes, and a touch of heat. Tastes generally sweet chocolate malts with dark fruits and wine grapes. Bittersweet cocoa on the midpalate with loads of bready malts. Finish has more cocoa and some bitter roast. Full bodied with a medium carbonation. Overall drinkability is pretty high, full flavored and good tasting, but not extreme. I could imagine having a couple of these, and buying it a couple times a year if it were available.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,dnjmed,4.68,"Chocolate brown head stays even to the last drop in your glass. Delicious brown black milkshake smell and taste does not quite hide a hint of nuts and fruits, or the powerful alcohol content, a pleasant bonus. Creamy texture and smooth, full, body. Fantastic winter stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,callmescraps,3.35,"I hear about this one every year from folks back east. Time to try it for myself.  Appearance- Black, obviously. A full inch of cocoa colored head. Lacing nicely.  Smell- Lots of roast. Almost a coffee aspect. Sweet dark chocolate. Almost like burnt coffee.  Taste- Hurm. Starts off with a nice chocolate note. Very nice. Chocolate, a hint of dark fruit. Almost raisin. Finishes with roast bitterness. Then it lingers. And lingers. And lingers. It's just so damn bitter and burnt. Hint of alcohol, while we're at it.  Mouthfeel- On the thin side.  Drinkability- No thanks. That bitterness just won't quit.  Chocolate? Really? More like burnt black coffee. Now, I am not a coffee fan, so that's a pretty big negative in my book. I was hoping the chocolate would balance it out, but it is a dark unsweetened chocolate, and it doesn't even show up much. This is a miss for me.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,caddybuyer,3.81,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Winter 09-10 release.  A-Deep dark motor oil with a thick rocky head with awesome looking lacing.  S-Not a lot of nose on this one. Poured at cellar temperature and I expected a bit more. Roasted chocolate malts, coffee, no alcohol detected.  T-Bittersweet chocolate malts predominate followed by a bit of astringent hop bitterness and alcohol detected more in its numbing effect than in the taste. Pretty good, but feels a bit raw, although to be fair I've been drinking aged RIS all week so it can't compare. I'm guessing this will be pretty special in a year, and I'll put the balance of the 4 pack down and see how it does.  M-Medium mouthfeel with balanced carbonation. Not as full or chewy as I thought it might be.  D-I like this, and the potential is definatel there, but it really needs some age to make it a really great beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ShadesOfGray,4.2,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Westvleteren chalice. Dated 09-10. Very dark and rich, not super oily thick like some Russian Imperial Stouts. Tan thin head doesn't last very long, but laces quite nicely.  Aroma isn't strong, but stout-like. A little espresso, bitter, sweet...boozy. Notes of bitter chocolates too.  Very tasty. Roasted malts, dark sugars, lots of chocolate and espresso. Heavy on the roasted characteristics.  Creamy mouthfull and chocolatey. For 10% ABV, very will hidden.

Chocolate isn't that present, more of an afterthought, but that's okay. (It turns out, that no chocolate is used in the making of this beer.)

45,680,MissLynx,4.88,"This is the first review I've posted here - hopefully I'll do it right!  I knew I had to try this beer when I read a rave review of it in the Toronto Star - I'm a big fan of stouts in general, and this one sounded wonderful. But it took some searching to find it. Most of the smaller LCBO stores were either sold out, or didn't have it in the first place, but I finally found it at Summerhill, one of the larger LCBO stores in Toronto, where you can often find things the smaller ones don't have, and bought six bottles.  I'd intended to bring them to a Christmas gathering at a friend's house, but couldn't resist trying one ahead of time, and oh my gods - I think I may have to go back to Summerhill and get more. Like as many as I can carry. Yes, it's THAT good.  It's smoother and sweeter than I'd expected, but still with a rich, complex flavour... There's a smokiness to it like lapsang souchong tea, and I can definitely see why the chocolate reference in the name, even though it doesn't contain chocolate as such - it tastes like the beer equivalent of one of those super-rich 70% cocoa dark chocolate bars. Or maybe the truffle equivalent, because it's got a smooth, almost buttery creaminess to it. There's just a touch of that earthiness you get in things like St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout, but it's just there enough to ground the sweetness.  It is also, as a few other reviewers have commented, scarily drinkable. It doesn't taste like it has nearly as high an alcohol content as it does. If I hadn't noticed the number on the label, I could see myself happily drinking several of these and then wondering why I was suddenly unable to walk.  All in all, this is definitely a top favourite. I'm not sure it could quite unseat my beloved Trois Pistoles or Young's Double Chocolate Stout from being tied for number one, but it's certainly a very close contender. Since it's only here temporarily, I am going to have to try to resist the impulse to visit every large LCBO store and buy up their entire stock of this. Seriously, if you like smooth, sweet stouts, this is the nectar of the gods.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BetterDarker,4.76,"09-10 Winter Vintage from 12 oz bottle poured into snifter.  A- Pours motor oil black with a thin tan head. Small bubbles running up the sides of my snifter. Fantastic looking beer.  S- Slightly bitter chocolate aroma, some booziness, but not nearly as much as one would expect from a 10% beer.  T- Great chocolate and burnt sugar flavor with a dark fruit (cherry?) in the finish. As this beer warms up, so do the flavors. WOW, this is fantastic. I can't take credit for the phrase, but this is nipple rubbing good.  M- Unbelievably creamy mouthfeel. Slight carbonation.  D- Dangerous. No other word for it, super smooth, alcohol is well masked, making this an easy drinker all around. Both sad and glad I only bought one 12 ounce bottle, but I will be getting more.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,curasowa,4.5,"Pours a dark mahogany, almost black color with 1 finger of dark tan/brown head that lingers a while. Smells of roasted malt, slightly medicinal, with notes of cherries and brown sugar. Tastes creamy and smooth, with lots of sweetness and good malt and dark chocolate flavors. It has a nice warming sensation before a lingering finish of dark chocolate. This beer is a real treat!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mnrider,4.26,"12oz. brown bottle. Winter 09-10  A: Pours a darkness not unlike a black hole. The thin head looks like hot chocolate. The light lacing leaves chocolate streaks down the glass.  S: Very malty with chocolate. Smells like the beers label.  T/M: One of the smoothest RIS i've had to date. Malts are amazingly tasty. Chocolate is ample and really makes this beer special. The 10% ABV is hidden very well. However it does become more noticeable as the beer warms. The bitterness is minimal.  D: Excellent brew. Very enjoyable. I will be looking forward to this beer every year. I may even store a few away, to see how it ages.  Cheers!!!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ronhocker,4.53,"Had this on tap at the local option in Chicago.  The appearance was as expected, very used motor oil dark brown. Head stayed around nicely, which is not common for this type of beer in my experience.  The smell of chocolate and malt is very present.  The taste was so very smooth. No bitterness from the dark malts, no astringency, no hop bitterness. It is almost like complex chocolate milk! Usually when a stout gets this smooth, it starts to taste like water. Somehow this one has in your face malt and chocolate flavor, while maintaining a very smooth taste.  Overall this was one of the best RISs I've ever had for my palette, and I've had both Dark Lord and Surly Darkness.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,goldbot,4.01,"This is the winter 09-10 Black Chocolate Stout, 12 oz. bottle. Purchased 4 bottles, of this beer, as it should improve over the next year or two from what I've heard.  The beer poured a very dark black, almost completely opaque, with a thin, nutty brown head which dissipated rather quickly. The beer exhibited almost no lacing. Aromas of deep roasted malts, not quite burnt, a hint of chocolate and molasses, and maybe some raisin. On the front is the taste of heavy roasted malt, some coffee bitterness, and a hint of caramel or toffee. The finish was really where the dark chocolate flavors stood out compared to the other malt flavors. Not too much hop presence throughout, but a nice full body with decent carbonation. The high alcohol percentage went almost unnoticed until the back end, where it was well balanced by the chocolate notes. This made it a very drinkable beer in my opinion, although the alcohol and heavy body would dissuade me from drinking much more of it in one session.  This was overall a great beer, although there was not as much chocolate flavor as I was expecting. The roasted, almost burnt malt flavors definitely override most of the chocolate.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Lunch,4.28,"Served from a 12oz. bottle purchased at The Perfect Pour in Columbia, Maryland (11/09/09) into my Brooklyn snifter at a seemingly appropriate temperature for a RIS. After having a disappointing experience (for the first time ever with this beer) I grabbed a 4pack and it did not disappoint. My old friend was indeed back. (I almost forgot to post this review)  A: An extremely dark brown that is nearly black capped off with a one finger espresso colored frothy head that stayed around for quite some time. Lacing remained for the duration of the beer. A very nice looking beer indeed.  S: After smelling really nothing but chalk while having it earlier on-tap, the roastiness was back. Some dark chocolate was present and some hop bitterness as well. Not as great as I remembered from years past, but still nice.  T: The roastiness hits the palate first along with layers of dark bitter chocolate, creamy milk chocolate, some dark fruits, brown sugar and a roasty dark malt. The chalky taste that dominated it earlier on-tap is completely gone from this from this one.  Ml: A fairly thick beer with a heavy gritty mouthfeel and appropriate carbonation.  D: Quite drinkable for the style, but it can become a little heavy at times.  Overall I am pleased that I revisited this beer again this year and it basically stood up to what I remembered from years past. Not sure what exactly happened with my on-tap sample, but this was back to its old tricks. Recommended.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Kaiser81,4.06,"Received via trade from Mora2000. Also received as an extra from rmaia when he just decided to ship me a beer for no reason other than it being on my Wants List.  I am beginning to fight a cold, so taste/smell scores might be slightly off.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my Stone IRS tulip glass (finally get to use it with a stout!)  A - pours a black color with a fingers worth of mocha head. It hangs around nicely for a few minutes. As I drink it, there is some light lacing on the glass, and the head settles to a nice ring that sits atop the beer.  S - Dark chocolate, roasted malts, dark fruits - probably plums/prunes stands out the most. There is just a touch of molasses in there as well. Stupid stuffy nose is not letting get as much as I want of this!  T - The dark fruit hits the pallet immediately, but it is followed up very nicely by the roated malts and then the dark chocolate on the finish that really lingers for a bit. Truly a great example of a stout. As it warms up, the chocolate really comes out as the dominant flavor. It changes from a dark chocolate to just a touch of milk chocolate...a tad bit sweeter and less bitter than when cold.  M - Heavy body with nice and light carbonation.  D - I could easily have another. If they released this in CA, I'd be all over it. It'd pair very well with a chocolate dessert",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,glid02,4.03,Bottle from a four-pack purchased at Green's on Ponce in Atlanta.  Pours one shade from black with a one-finger light brown head. The head recedes into a thin layer on top leaving thick lacing.  Smells of strong roasted malts with good amounts of unsweetened and dark chocolate. As it warms the chocolate aromas sweeten a bit.  Tastes very similar to how it smells. Roasted malts with very light hints of coffee and much stronger hints of dark chocolate. Midway through the sip the roasted malt flavors fade a bit leaving room for the chocolate flavors to take over and carry through to a solidly bitter ending.  Mouthfeel is good. It's got a solid thickness with moderate carbonation.  Drinkability is good. I didn't have a problem finishing the bottle and won't have a problem polishing off the rest of the four-pack.  Overall this didn't taste quite as complex as it remember it tasting on-tap however it's still a very solid beer. Well worth a shot.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,alcstradamus,4.08,"Pours black with a creamy finger of head that camps out for a while and leaves a bit of lacing.  Smell is bakers chocolate up front with a nice roasted malt profile. The chocolate comes through very strong here. Some floral hoppiness as well. Only real knock is that there is a bit of a bright metallic element present.  First sip reveals a huge roasted malt profile. Some cocoa powder, burnt toast, resiny hops, marshmallow, a faint coffee bean bitterness.  The body here is full to medium and extremely creamy. If not for a tad bit of carbonation sting it would be perfect. Overall, I feel that this beer is a wonderful example of a Russian Imperial Stout. Just one or two more layers of complexity could have put it over the top. Still, definitely superior to the Black Ops in my opinion.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,CBlack85,3.9,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass  Pours black with lots of ruby highlights. It doen't appear to be as thick as some of its peers. A very small tan head with a good amount of lacing  First smell is of alcohol with a faint aroma of chocolate, and just a whisper of coffee. Roasted malts provide a nice almost smokey aroma  Initial taste, like the smell, is of alcohol, it seems as though they did not try to mask it at all. Once you get past the booziness is a very nice chocolate flavor with a hint of roasted malts. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated. This seems to be a sipping beer a little too much burn to be very drinkable.  Nice silky mouthfeel, once you get past the initial alcohol it is really quite good. Definately a good desert beer, or a nice sipper on a cold evening.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,AndyAvalanche,4.07,"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. This beer is good looking beer. Black in color, hence the name, with some dark brown highlights that you really have to look for. It's pretty dense looking This beer has a dark tan colored head that goes away pretty quickly and very little lacing to it. The smell is very good. Smells of bitter chocolate and coffee along with some burned malts. The hops make themselves known after the beer sits for a bit and warms up a little as well as a touch of alcohol. The taste is also very good but a little more intensified, everything is a little bit stronger, with the exception of maybe the burned malts. Starts off with the bittersweet chcolate and coffee. Once it's about room temperature it really has an excellent, well balanced flavor. The hops and alcohol balance extremely well with the chocolate and coffee and the more subtle burned malts. The mouthfeel is good, very full bodied. There's a bit of a bite from the alcohol, none from the carbonation though. Starts smooth and finishes pretty clean at the end. This beer's pretty drinkable for a beer with such a high abv.

45,680,devilben02,4.04,"I always look forward to this release. Pours a deep, dark brown (almost black) with a thin, medium-brown head. There is not much to the aroma, but what is there is full of bitter chocolate and coffee with a caramel sweetness and a bit of straight-up booze. The flavor is delightful, with the bitter chocolate being featured, and there is a bit of a spicy character (some combination of hops and alcohol). Full bodied, but silky-smooth. There is quite a bit of alcohol heat when fresh, but even then it give a nice warming feeling rather than burning.

It doesn't have much of a head while the nose on the beer is quite robust, with lots of chocolate and alcohol notes. There are plenty of the coffee like aromas too.  The taste is as advertised, with a thick, chocolaty, roasted to the point of being almost charred, dark malts. There is a full palate of flavors going on here.

I suspect Bitter....But Lets see.  Taste: Talk about smooth. I'd go more sweet than bitter for a stout, but this is my kind of stout! I find some stouts just have far too much hops in it, This has a smooth almost mix of milk/dark chocolate with subtle spiciness. Like a chilli dark chocolate.

45,680,jamiesessions,3.68,"Darkness surrounds my glass as the thick black liquid fills it. A tan head that leaves a good looking lacing starts this beer looking off good. The smell of chocolate is present, as is the coffee and roasted malts that one comes to associate with a good RIS. The taste is a very strong alcohol. Normally beers with a high ABV will try to hide the alcohol, but this one is liable to knock you on your butt pretty quickly. The chocolate taste is still there, but the taste is also quite burnt. Oftentimes I will hear people describe stouts as ""like drinking an ashtray"". This is what they were talking about, and while the burnt taste and the hit of alcohol are a bit of a detriment, the chocolate and espresso still makes for a great tasting brew lurking just beneath the surface. The body is nice and full and the aftertaste is quite good.

It's readily available around here, but I also got it as an extra from Lunch as both a good beer to drink and a joke since he was sending a bunch of Bourbon County Stout, and I kept referring to it as BCS, since they have the same initials, and I opened the box with those on top, hilarity ensued.  A: Pours a nice 1.5 finger dark brown head that fades semi slowly. It's pitch black with no light coming through.  N: Lots of dark malts first hit, accompanied by lots of roasted malts and chocolate. It adds that familiar dark malt fermented booze aroma that is nice in a good strong stout. Some light sweet aromas dance out with some rich dark fruits. The roasted malt quality is very nice.  T: Starts with lots of dark rich chocolate and creamy tastes. It has a taste of dark chocolate melted with a little cream and brown sugar. Lots more roasted malt flavors come through and add a nice flavor. Some sweet malts, caramel, and heavy fermented sugars that turned into some boozy flavors, warming alcohol and that overall strong Belgian ale like experience. The stouty flavor adds a slight charred earthy roast flavor for more goodness. Some lighter dark fruits come through, almost a fig or plum. It has a nice warming fruit and sweetness on the front of the tongue that sits there and makes you feel warm and tingly.  M: Semi thick, little warming alcohol and good carbonation.  F: Finishes pretty bitter, part being a nice hop addition I think, and also a strong bitter quality from the charred earthy scorched roasted malt flavor, stout like. It's pretty dry on the finish as well. THe slight warming alcohol sticks around for a bit that is surrounded with a thick syrupy chocolate malt flavor that sticks to the mouth. It also has this succulent finishing flavor I can't put my finger on, but it's very enjoyable.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Very slight hints of hops in the background  M: Heavy bodied with very low carbonation. It's very thick, rich and smooth in the mouth making a creamy texture. Roasted/dark malts leave a pleasant bitterness and the alcohol makes an appearance on the way down.  D: This is a great stout which has a nice blend of coffee and chocolate. There is more alcohol apparent in this than others I've had, but it's not off putting.

Chocolate dominates the nose, with hints of vanilla, bready malt, but the hops are pretty well hidden. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla dominate the syrupy taste profile, this is certainly one of the most chocolately beers I've tried. Chewy mouthfeel but alcohol heat impedes drinkability.

S- Loads of dark chocolate and espresso, very faint traces of alcohol as well.  T- Chocolate, espresso, and roasted malts throughout. A little bitterness from the hops and bittersweet chocolate. The alcohol is a little more noticeable in the taste, but not nearly as hot as it was when I first purchased this.  M- Full bodied, chewy, and extremly smooth.  D- This one is a sipper for sure, but I could have another.

Lacing is very nice as the head slowly fades.  S: Firm notes of roasted, sweet malt, with hints of molasses and dark fruit. Vibrant notes of dark chocolate fit this beer's name. A spicy alcoholic aroma is definitely also present.  T: A big, roasted malt sweetness up front. A strong dark chocolate character is present throughout, and it really shows its teeth into the finish, where it lingers nicely. Hoppiness is low, but there is a roasted/burnt bitterness. There are hints of coffee and perhaps dark fruit lurking in the background. Alcohol is plainly evident, but also not unwelcome.  M: Full-bodied and chewy for the most part. Carbonation is light, lending a pleasant smoothness. An acidic, burnt drying finish.  D: This is a tasty, chocolaty RIS from Brooklyn. I hesitate to call it an excellent version of the style though, as it lacks a three-dimensional complexity that many other imperial stouts can boast. Make no mistake, this has a very appealing dark chocolate character, but aside from the chocolate (and a kick of alcohol), this is merely very good.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TheManiacalOne,4.18,"2009 release, on-tap 12/13/09 at Doherty's East Ave Irish Pub in Pawtucket, RI, served in a tulip glass.  A: The beer is a deep dark black color, with a short light brown head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is of dark chocolate, dark fruit, roasted malts and a faint touch of hops.  T: The taste starts out with a bitter-sweet flavor of dark chocolate. Then a faint but complementary flavor of dark fruit flavor comes in. The roasted malt character is very hearty and there's no trace of the 10.10% ABV. The hops presence is very mild as you would expect from this kind of beer. The after-taste is slightly sweet.  M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, light-to-medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.  D: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, slightly filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, although there are other big stouts that I would pick first, this is a very good beer to drink for a long time.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,pez000,3.93,Not much for long reviews. But this years is a lot more drinkable than last years with out having to let it sit for months. really sad that this year it comes in a 4 pack rather than a 6.

45,680,tlinner,4.4,"One of my all-time favorites! Dark brown peripherals, black in the center, with a nice frothy brown head. The smell and taste are exactly what you'd expect: chocolate. But there's not too much of a sharpness to this one that I've found with other strong stouts. It's sweet and flavorful, not harsh and bitter. In my opinion, Brooklyn's is THE quintessential chocolate stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,webmanspidey,4.08,"12 oz. bottle poured into a chalice. This is pitch black, fizzy, with light beige/brownish head. The smell is semisweet, with some dark chocolate, raisin, sparkling grape, and definite alcohol.  The taste definitely has the chocolate presence, but also something sweet and syrupy. Alcohol is present, but not over the top bothersome. Taste finishes slightly bitter.  Mouthfeel isn't too thick for the style, and pretty fizzy. Very drinkable.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,deaconoflove,4.37,"Ap. Very dark, impenetrable brown with a very brown head that didn't last long. Some lacing as I go. Sm. Sweet chocolate, like fudge or chocolate cake batter. Not a candy smell. A very rich smelling brew. Love it. Ta. At first like cold hot chocolate, but with a malty cast and nicely bitter finish. Really nice balance of sweet and bitter...good flavor! Mf. Smooth and full. Rich, but not thick. Dr. Easy going. The ABV is not apparent. I'm liking this one very much.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,kiddynamite920,4.25,"09-10 Winter Vintage. 12 oz bottle.  Pours jet black with a gorgeous tan head that looks almost as comfortable to sleep in as my queen sized bed. Black. Aromas are rising out of my glass and hitting my nose from feet away. Smell is exceptional. As this beer ages the boozy smell dissipates rather quickly I have noticed. A very deep dark and fruity aroma develops next to the chocolate aroma that is most prevalent. Everyone knows chocolate and fruit pair extraordinarily well, so this one is smelling out of this world. Sweet chocolate pairs up with some plum and sweet cherries. Considering this is my favorite Brooklyn brew, its hard to review it subjectively, especially considering the quality I am reviewing here. Everything about this beer is world class, especially the taste. Huge chocolate and burnt sugar flavor. Good dark fruit character. Super creamy mouthfeel makes this beer even more luxurious. Really a homerun for Brooklyn. Watch yourself with this beer, as it will catch up to you even after one. Quite a big stout, with a flavor and aroma that would make you want more...but beware.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,sidetracked,4.08,"Pours jet black with a thin brown head.  Smells of bourbon... a bit sweet as well.  Tastes sweet and of roasted malts. Finishes with a bitter dark chocolate taste that lingers on the palette. Not the overwhelmingly chocolate flavor as I'd presumed based on the name, but it's definitely there.  Has the thick, chewy mouthfeel that you'd expect from an Imperial Stout. A good drink, but I think I'd be hard-pressed to have a second.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BillyBoysPie,4.56,"From a bottle into a snifter.  Pours a spectacular opaque black with not a sign of any hues. It's black. A quarter inch of toasty-tan head that dissipates (with 10%, you can't expect it to just hang around) and leave a significant amount of lacing - nearly coating the glass.  Rich chocolate and malts come through on the nose. Not sweet smelling, but very, very rich. A touch of buttery diacetyl and a tiny bit of spices.  Yum! Chocolate and toasted barley with a touch of caramel sweet and prunes/figs. You can tell there are varieties of malt in this beer, but they're all married together - a touch of butter and toasty malt works with the sweet fruit, and they're both counterbalanced against the bitter chocolate taste. Tasty stuff.  Low carbonation typical of the style, heavy mouthfeel that approaches the sticky, syrupy mouthfeel of super-heavy beers, but stays in a nice heavy dense mouthfeel. I don't feel the alcohol at all - but it's a nice warm beer.  Really, really exceptional beer. Well worth the annual 10.00 or so. One of Brooklyn's finest.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,PangaeaBeerFood,3.85,"Went to the Brooklyn Brewery last night specifically to try this highly regarded beer. Unfortunately, the bartender told me they no longer serve Black Chocolate at Happy Hour because, at 10% ABV, it was making the place too roudy too fast. Lucky for me, the second bar I went to down the road, Barcade, had this on tap.  Poured into a 10 ounce wine glass, it looks as expected. Blacker than the blackest black, with a thin mocha colored head. Very syrupy that clings to the glass when swirled and slowly slips down the sides.  The smell is great. Reminds me of a really good Irish Coffee. The dark roasted aromas come through at first with the alcohol really making itself known at the end. Very very rich and decadent scent, which is exactly what I want (because it's goddamn freezing outside tonight). Very inticing.  The taste is not at all what I expected. Fairly low on the bitterness scale and much drier and less sugary than most 10+% ABV beers. It is very smooth and creamy on the palate initially. That being said, because there is less residual sugar and bitterness, the alcohol is VERY present at the finish. You can taste it and feel it warming the inside of your body as you swallow. It is so rich, with flavors of dark espresso and bitter chocolate that are so complex. I'm finding new things with every sip. Great on a cold winter night, but alcohol is way more present than other beers in it's class. As the beer warmed, by the end, the alcohol was a bit overwhelming. Very hot for the last 2 ounces or so. Too hot, they were difficult to finish.  The mouthfeel was great. Very thick with a winely mouthcoating effect and light carbonation, which, like the rest of the beer, gives you the impression that it's even stronger than it is. I love it though, and it is so appropriate for the cold weather.  Drinkability is average, at best. With the dominance of the alcohol in this beer, I could enjoy one 10 ounce glass, but wanted something less intense for my next beer.  Overall, this is a beer that shows INCREDIBLE potential. The flavors are so complex and rich with simultaneously less sweetness and less bitterness than other Imperial Stouts I've had, which gives you time to appreciate every nuance. That being said, the alcohol was just too dominating. Since this is being served at a bar down the block from the brewery in December, chances are this beer is as fresh as fresh could be. A beer this bold needs more time to let the booze integrate and mellow. I'm going to try to find myself a four-pack of this and cellar it. I'll have one every few months and see how the flavors develop. If I had to guess, 6 months down the road this will be fantastic, and by next christmas it will be heavenly, but now it's just too hot.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,Cabadrin,4.52,"Good lord, this is a powerful stout. All of the chocolate appears in the aftertaste. After the intial tasting, it's like eating a dark chocolate bar and having the bitter, thick aftertaste sitting on your tongue.  Pouring from a chilled (45 degree) bottle into a pint glass, there's practically no head and only a thin layer of foam which quickly dissipates. The color is a deep, dark black, with no brown coming through the edges. There's a very slight lacing up the glass, but not much to look at. The taste is great - bitter but full for the first taste, then it fades to a thick chocolate aftertaste for many minutes afterwards. This is definitely something you want to savor during and after a meal, and especially with something that's rich in flavor, like a steak or a thick fall vegetable spread. Highly recommended.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,oceanman,4.22,"Vertical tasting of 07/08, 08/09, 09/10 (ratings based on year-old bottle)  A: fresh bottle pours near black, older bottles fade to dark chocolate brown. thin off-white head.  S: older vintages have wonderful aromas of smores, hot chocolate, marshmallows. touch of cherry, booze evident in 07/08. fresh bottle is much weaker on nose.  T: obviously, big chocolate taste in all vintages. 07-08 bottle is surprisingly boozy (and perhaps slightly oxidized?). 08-09 seems to be in perfect balance.  M: older vintages are now very soft thick and creamy. fresh bottle has a much more lively carbonation.  The year-old bottle wins out here. Balanced carbonation, richer aromas, and subdued alcohol.

45,680,bobsy,4.03,"Pours a velvety black with a large creamy head that billowed to the top of the snifter, and elegantly dropped to a substantial film, leaving patchy sheets of lace. Truly a beautiful imperial stout, that ties in well with the wonderful label design, and emphasises the decadence of this beer. The aroma is also a killer, as nice chocolate notes jump out, but don't dominate, and are then joined by a light coffee roast, raisins, figs and alcohol. As with all imperials this becomes stronger as it warms, and asides from the evident alcohol it makes for a tempting drink.  With many chocolate themed beers, the chocolate is poorly done, because its over-emphasised and can often end up tasting like extract, even when its not. Not so with Brooklyn, where the dark chocolate is expertly integrated into a formidable imperial stout profile. Lots of dark roasted coffee, rich stone fruit and raisin mix in with some awesome dark chocolate. Its an incredibly drinkable concoction and the only detracting factor is a slightly apparent alcohol, which dies with age. Even with a year on it this beer is phenomenal, and more is gravy, but fresh is still commendable and a fine imperial stout. This is all aided by a full and slick mouthfeel which amps up the decadence and matches the flavours excellently.  Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is seen as a classic, and deservedly so. It has an immense reputation for it cellar potential, it's a darn site cheaper than a lot of other highly regarded imperial stouts, and it drinks like a doozy. Bobsy approved.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,WeedKing4,4.15,Bottle pours a dark black with two fingers caramel brown foam lacing the glass. Smell is of dark malts and chocolate.

S- Ok I get dark chocolate, dark fruits, espresso bean candy, and alcohol.  T- Ok we got some dark chocolate but not over sweet. Roasted malt is big with some dark fruit hiding in the background. Some coffee bitterness to balance the job, with a splash of good ole alcohol.  M- This beer is slick on the tongue, but very smooth. Carbonation is there, making this one easy to pour down your throat.  D- This one is easier to drink then most beers in its style. But do not be confused the alcohol is there and will creep up on you.  N- This is not as big and bold as some Imp stouts but it is an easier brew to have more then two at a time.

Big dark chocolate, dark fruits, dry espresso, black licorice, and alcohol dominate the nose with a few loaves of bread stuffed in between. The nose makes me want to eat this stuff rather than drink it.  Smooth and rich dark chocolate, roasted malts, very light dark fruits, all capped off by a dry and bitter espresso like finish and a noticeable but not offending warming alcohol presence, which both work together to compliment the sweet chocolate notes.  Slick, smooth, and coats the mouth. Excellent level of carbonation. Not as intense as other RIS's I've had, making this a nice drinker.  Overall, an excellent beer from Brooklyn, and the best RIS (based on the few that I've had) I've had yet.

Great head retendion and medium lace down the glass. Pitch black color, no visibility through the brew. the head is a dark mocha/cappacino color.  Smell: Smells like rich dark melted chocolate, bittersweet. Has an aroma of burnt espresso with a few roasted almonds in the background.  Taste: Tastes rich and vibrant. A little bit of upfront acidity followed by a huge dose of dark bitter chocolate with some roasted coffee beans. On the backend it gets a little bit bitter but is saved with the good malt character.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly thin on the palate. Doesnt leave a huge aftertaste to me. A little bit too carbonated than I would like in a RIS. Nonetheless a good mouthfeel, just not what I expected.  Drinkability: Despite the ABV, its easy to drink. Very strong upfront flavors limit this from being a quick drink. It would be a lot better at a closer to room temp but overall its a solid brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,soulgrowl,3.88,"Ah, Brooklyn BCS. If memory serves me correctly, Gordon Ramsay famously spat this beer out when he tried it on TV, proving that we needn't take cues on matters of taste (or etiquette) from him. Or was his disgust justified? We shall see..  It is indeed black, one of those rare beers that really lets no light through at all and has an oily malted-milk brown head. It also does smell of chocolate, but it primarily smells of sherry, vanilla, and stewed prunes. The alcohol is quite hot. The flavor is lush and chocolatey with harmonies of espresso and raisins and a spike of hot, spicy, spirited alcohol. I do think the alcohol is much more pronounced than it needs to be, especially in the aftertaste, where it numbs the tongue with a vaporous medicinal quality. However, I am impressed with the level of chocolate flavor here without using any chocolate malts; it does taste quite a bit like cocoa.  Thick, rich, hot, and heavy, this imperial stout makes an impact even to a jaded geek like me. That said, it isn't a personal favorite in the style, but even so, Ramsay was a complete idiot to spit it out.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

I get a sweet dark chocolate like taste upfront with a medium roasted coffee bitterness following it from behind to even out the sweetness, slight cola like taste finishes it up.

45,680,OldSchoolGamer,3.78,"One of Brooklyn's winter seasonals. I have had this one in the past, but never really cared much for it. Lets see if my opinion has changed within the past year.  A: Pours a pitch black color. Head is minimal, and lacing is non-existant. Looks pretty typical for a stout.  S/T: The aroma stings the nose slightly with its alcohol presence. Along with the alcohol, slight chocolate and caramel notes are present. The taste is much more satisfying than the aroma. Alcohol is present in the taste, but only becomes bothersome when paired with food, in my case a chocolate-pretzel bar. Chocolate, caramel, molasses, and a nice roasted malt backing are all there in full-force. A little harsh due to the alcohol, which remains upfront and not blended in with the rest of the flavors. Better than I remember, but not the best stout available.  M/D: Mouthfeel is full-bodied and creamy. The alcohol kind of hurts the drinkablility somewhat. Definetly a sipping beer.  Without a doubt, this is the best beer in the Brooklyn lineup that I have tried. While what is here is very good, there is room for improvement. Worth picking up, and is a great value for what you get.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Donerik,3.94,"A - jet black, light escapes the gravity at the edge of the event horizon, but barely.  S - Not much scent, only a little burtness, aroma smelled by 3 people to make sure it wasn't me.  T - Great, bitter bitter roasted malts, with a chocolate finish. Like 92% dark cocoa bars.  M - Smooth going down, well carbonated.  D - one was just about right, but I could have had more, I liked it, so I'd have gone back to it if need be.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,hayesez,3.91,"2009-2010 bottle received in trade from nyrangerfan - thanks for the brew!  Produced a thick, dark-black pour with a half-inch mocha colored head that dissipated slowly in my standard goblet. Small amounts of garnet light came through where the beer met the head. A sticky lace is left as I slowly drink this one down. This a good looking beer!  The beer did not smell as complex as many of RIS's. An obvious mixture of darker chocolate, malts, and alcohol is present.  Again, the chocolate and alcohol are prevelant in the first drink. Once again, I got impatient and popped this sucker open instead of letting it age for a while. Virtually wihtout exception, I appreciate the more mellowed-out, aged versions of these stouts as opposed to drinking them the year they come out. While the roasted malt flavor of the beer was nice, I prefer the alcohol to be a bit more masked. As the beer warmed up, I caught a bit of bitter coffee on the back-end...pretty indiscernible througout the rest, however.  A bit thinner than many of your heavier RIS's, but the beer still left that oily coating in my mouth...I have certainly enjoyed this one.  Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. Had it smoothed out a bit, I have no doubts I would have scored it better. I will certainly edit this one after I drink the 2008-2009 aging in my basement right now.

45,680,BeanBone,4.13,"Appearance: A thick, inky black body that blocks all light from passing through. Up top, there's over a finger of tan head that sticks around surprisingly long and leaves great lacing.  Aroma: Lots of dark, toasted malt character accompanied by some sweet chocolate and a fair share boozy notes. Clearly a Imperial Stout.  Flavor: A rich dark malt body featuring lots of bitter chocolate, dark roasted coffee, and some dark fruit notes. There a nice alcohol component throughout, and it pairs wonderfully with the rest of the flavors. The aftertaste is boozy and toasty.  Mouthfeel: Medium-full bodied and nicely creamy with good carbonation and plenty of heat from the alcohol.  Drinkability: Clearly a beer meant for a slow tempo, this is a perfect companion for dessert and conversation.  Verdict: I've been waiting to try this beer for many years, and I have to say I'm not disappointed. Black Chocolate Stout is a big Imperial Stout with lots of character, and also quite bargain. Now, to find a new white whale...",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,krisandajt,4.28,"Appearance: The pour is black. I'm talking jet black. There's no light getting through this bad boy at all. There is a very small amount of coffee colored head that fades fast leaving a few rings of soapy lacing.  Smell: Big on chocolate (huge shocker given the name, right?), with a bit of coffee and the slightest tinge of alcohol burn. This one has the makings of a big brew.  Taste: Like the smell, big on the chocolate. The alcohol tinge I picked up in the nose isn't really apparent in the taste. It's obvious you're drinking a big stout, but I think the booze is hidden fairly well for being 10%. There's a bit of coffee and some mild roasted malt going on in the back. Quite tasty.  Mouthfeel: A nice thick, viscous brew. Carbonation is light, which makes the beer very smooth going down. It has a great body and a good texture to it.  Drinkability: This is a big stout, there's no messing around with that. It's got some good flavor, nice texture, and is a very well done brew. I think the only thing that hurts this brew's drinkability is the 10%ABV...you just can't do too many of these in one night without having to bow down and pray to the gods of porcelain. That being said, I will be slowly sipping on this bad boy the rest of the night, and looking forward to cracking open another one tomorrow night.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,northaustin,4.18,"poured into a schnifter. pours a thick glorious black with a fat finger of chocolate brown head which disappears rather fast and leaves almost no lacing.  smell: bigtime roasted chocolate malts and a good amount of alchohol.  taste i like alot. nothing is overpowering and if it makes any sense its really intense while still being very mellow. lots of chocolate flavor but it tastes like there is also lots of that classic black patent and dark crystal stout flavor goin on. as well as a fair amount of alchohol heat.  mouthfeel and drinkability: it is a tad syrupy, but nothing too unexpected from the style. depending on what kind of night youre trying to have this beer could be very sessionable. it is very powerful and certainly should be a staple for fans of big beers.  as a side note i had this one night ran through a randall full of cherries that had been soaked in knob creek. it was awesome and props to sam at the austin saucer for a plate of the bourbon soaked cherries too.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Reinheitsgebot71,4,"I've been looking forward to this one since it was announced as a winter seasonal release earlier this year, time to dig in.  A thick mocha coloured head quickly builds from the pour, very reminiscent of frothed milk on a coffee. The body is very dark with hints of ruby on the edges; it almost completely obscures the light.  The nose summons aromas of coffee and chocolate, followed by a pungent alcoholic whiff though not in a negative way; very akin to a fin port or brandy. Scents of cherry and dates appear now and again mixed with a subtle sour note of a lactic, ripe fruit character.  A smooth alcoholic punch is the first thing that gripes my taste buds. Quick on its heels are big roast malt flavours, molasses, caramel, brunt bread and brown sugar. The 10% ABV is very present here but very refined, plum brandy sense. It brings warming and biting sensations which mellow and smooth out as the beer warms. Astringency is caused and balanced by the fin black malt flavours, cocoa being predominant along with roast coffee beans. Hops are nearly nonexistent save for a minuet amount of bitterness in the finish. It drinks very smooth the body much akin in texture to skim milk, especially as it warms.  This is great and powerful stout definitely fit for a Czar. It will be interesting to see what some age on it will result in.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TheSarge,3.38,"All right, my first RIS, and it's a doosey.  Pours a finger thick chocolate milkshake looking head. This has great lacing along with a jet-black colored body.  The aroma is of coffee and semi sweet chocolate, and the ethyl is detectable in the fragrance too.  Okay, in the taste is the chocolate dominance. I'd say semi sweet to baker's chocolate.  This is a tough cookie of a beer, and is not like something I've had in a long time. Overall very enjoyable, and I'd like to pair this with a good chocolaty desert sometime.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bruachan,3.34,"welll...it's opaque. the fizzled to a firm film with haste (why the rush?). lacing was OK, though  i smell hops and heat first (with the fusel wining out), and some chocolate astringency follows. very earthy  the beer itself tastes deeply nutty while chocolate is minimal, and most malt flavors don't quite stand up to be counted. hops make a huge appearance again, in terms both of flavor and bitterness. a little burnt thing going on, and some coffee (chicory?)  good mouthfeel. the heat and less-than-robust flavors suggest the brew could use some time in the cellar, as they can't quite stand out to stand up to the heat  to postulate on the genus of chocolate brews, this one is decisively opposed to the Young's Doubles of the world. because of this lack of sweetness, don't think you're gonna make a killer pairing with a very sweet dessert",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,OneDropSoup,3.71,"On tap at 6 & Save in New Kensington, PA.  Poured into a tulip a solid black with a finger of fluffy mocha head. Left webbed, tapestry-like lacing.  Is this chocolate? At first I smell nothing but passion fruit -- if blindfolded, I would've guessed this was Sam Adams Imperial White. The chocolate shows up later on, but the fruit smell is still really dominant. Whuh?  The taste is the same story, at least at first: peach, passion fruit, but then with a roasty, almost astringent follow-up. It seemed to skip the chocolate altogether & go straight to the burnt flavor! As it warms, some booze creeps in, then a kind of buttery flavor, then subtle chocolate (there it is!), some dark fruit skin.  Mouthfeel is thick & oily, but also on the tannic, acidic end of things. This one's sticking to my tongue & not letting go.  This was a big, complex beer, but a little more challenging than I would have liked, not as comforting as I'd like a chocolate stout to be. May I was looking for the wrong thing, but I hardly got any chocolate out of it, more the peripheral sensations. I wonder if this would be better aged to mellow it out some, in which case tap is not really the venue. One was plenty.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,myost88,4.68,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into Tulip style glass  Appearance- A slow pour yields a thick viscous black body topped by a three finger dark tan caramel colored head. Head stuck around for a minute before fading to a nice floating thin layer. Patches of lacing are all over the glass. Head was smooth not clumpy like many RIS. Overall a very appetizing beer to look at.  Smell- Chocolate is very evident hear. Almost like the smell of a Hershey's dark bar. Backed up slightly by a roasted scent. Very little coffee is apparent in the scent.  Taste- Taste is much more complex than the nose and it serves this beer very well. Dark chocolate is dominant again followed by a well balance roasty malt background and some raisin flavors as well. Not too sweet like many chocolate stouts. A hint of bitterness at the end makes this an extremely balanced and well rounded stout.  Mouthfeel- Smooth and creamy, but not as thick as many RIS. Closer to a heavy porter than a real thick oily stout. I thought the lighter body complemented its complex flavor very well. Many times when drinking an RIS I get this milkshake type feeling. Not here though smooth and not too heavy.  Drinkability- Well there isn't a lot too say here other than at 10.6 % this is no session stout. However it's such a good beer you may truly want to. I found myself taking nice gulps rather than small sips.  Overall- I flat out loved this beer and will gladly keep my fridge stocked with it as long as its here in TX.

45,680,farrago,3.82,"Aggressive pour yields over a two finger head of dark brown foam with an island of larger bubbles in the middle, takes a good while to work itself down to a steady half-finger level, nice web of lacing along the glass walls. Onyx black in color, actually since black is not a color it's colorless. The nose has a pleasingly explosive nature to it for the category, licorice, anise, Brazil nuts, dark chocolate, molasses, caramelized brown sugar, rum raisin ice cream, plum, blackberry fruit, you never feel it is devoid of hops but they are hard to isolate. In the mouth it's a touch alcoholic at first but the espresso bean, bittersweet dark chocolate, mocha accompanied by licorice and pine. At times has a fruitcake kind of thing going on. Toasty, the hops have an oven warmed grain quality, like 19th century shit. At times it's grapey, definitely you get apricot, black cherry fruit.

45,680,TheMattJones88,4.52,"Here goes my first review.  I bought a four pack of the 09-10 BCS about a week ago, and I found a sixer of 08-09 today, so I suppose this will partially be a comparison.  Both were poured from a 12oz bottle to a pint glass.  Appearance: The beer poured an almost solid black for both years. The 08 had a slightly larger (1/2"") head, which had a reddish/brown tinge to it. The 09's head was only about 1/4"", and was a nice cream color. Both dissipated after about a minute.  Smell: The 08 smells like a bar of dark chocolate with a small twinge of hops in the background. The 09 is a bit more black-coffee like and the hop smell isn't really noticeable at all.  Taste: I suppose this is the one that REALLY matters. The 08 literally tastes like I'm biting into a bar of really great Dark Chocolate. The flavor sustained in my mouth for roughly 30 seconds after each sip, and was incredibly smooth. The 09 doesn't have the same chocolate notes of the 08 unfortunately, however, that may be due to the lack of aging. Neither of the beers were all that ""hot"" tasting considering their (relatively) high ABV, however, the alcohol taste was just the slightest bit more noticable in the 08.  Mouthfeel: Smooth Smooth Smooth. Only a minimal amount of carbonation, but that's all I want in a stout.  Drinkability: Incredibly drinkable, a great dessert beer. The alcohol is hidden very well, and if you don't remember that this is a 10% beer, you might knock it back a bit too fast.  Overall, I enjoyed the 08 more than the 09, but the 09 was no slouch.

45,680,CharlatanSin,4.21,"Well well well. We meet again, Brooklyn Black Chocolate. I'd had you on tap a couple of weeks back, but didn't have my handy dandy notebook and didn't get around to a review. Flair Beverages had a bunch of new 4 packs on the shelf. Let's see how tough you are out of the bottle.  Poured from a 12oz bottle into my lovely Hold Steady pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a deep space black. It's questionable whether light can escape from the glass. A gorgeous thick tan head that leaves major league lacing accents what is a beautiful beer.  Smell: Bitter chocolate dominates, with a bit of coffee. It's all a little weak, though.  Taste: Again, delicious bitter dark chocolate rules the day, but its supporting cast comes out more than they did in the smell. The coffee's still there, and it's roasted and flavorful. There's also some dried fruit...plums I think, or really dark raisins. You can definitely taste the alcohol, much more strongly than I remember from my on-tap experience.  Mouthfeel: Silky smooth, low carbonation. Body's definitely thinner than I'd have guessed.  Drinkability/Overall: Delicious taste, and a gorgeous beer. However, the alcohol taste is way stronger than I remember it being on tap, and I doubt I could have more than one in a sitting. That being said, I'd drink it frequently. Another job well done by Brooklyn.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MeisterBurger,4.2,"Pours a deep, dark jet black topped by a tan head. It looks like a glass of liquid evil. As things go along it dies down to a ring of head and leaves very small amounts of splotchy lacing.  Aroma is of raisins, plums and dried dark fruits, mocha, roast and chocolate notes are at play too, as is a smidgen of mashed banana. Alcohol is present, but in a good way.  The taste is rummy, there's something akin to brandy or cognac about it, with raisins, malt, roast and melted dark chocolate, all this sweetness is kept in check by just the perfect dose of bitter herbal hops. There's an oak like dryness in the finish. Really, this almost feels more like drinking a fortified wine than a beer, and no bad thing.  Mouthfeel is thick without being cloying, but it lets the rich flavors cling to your tongue so you have no choice by to savor them.  This is just a sophisticated, delicious introspective beer to have by a fire on a cold winter's night. Maybe not quite chocolatey enough to warrant having chocolate in the name. But that's a minor quibble at best. But yeah. This is the reason I drink beer. For those times where you can take sip after sip and contemplate and slowly peel back all the subtle layers that work together to create such a complex marriage of flavor in perfect harmony.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

A dangerous brew, but very tasty.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Vengeance526,3.82,"Pours a dark black color with a small brown head that fades away quickly without leaving much lacing.  Amazing aroma of semi-sweet chocolate, roasted coffee, dark fruit and a hint of cinnamon.  I found the taste a little hard to rate. Taste starts off peppery with mild chocolate, vanilla and oak, with a spicy, slightly alcoholic finish. Not bad at all, but for me, the taste just didn't live up to the excitement of the aroma.  Smooth mouthfeel, perhaps a little thin, but not bad. I typically wouldn't drink more than one of these in a night but I will come back for more on another day. This one was reviewed fresh, but I've had it at one year and found it to be a bit better.

45,680,jrallen34,3.93,I drank this from a 12 oz bottle into a Rochefort glass.  This beer is black with hardly any brown in the light. The head is about 2 fingers of medium tan head with decent retention and a very nice creamy look. The lacing is strong.  The smells is very weak for a ris with only light notes of sweet chocolate detectable.  The taste is also weak just like the aroma. It tastes more like coffee than chocolate but thats all you get. I want more flavors and complexity here.  For a ris this is not very viscous or lasting.  The best thing I'd say about this beer is for its alcohol you can't taste it and I could crush it all day long.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

T - Mostly roasted malts and some coffee taste. I'm not really getting much chocolate here, although it is slightly present. The dark fruity taste is there, but gets fainter the longer you drink. The beer gets better as you go, but it tastes pretty ordinary. Alcohol is pretty present.  M - Little thinner than expected, and not particularly carbonated. Not all that great.

Smell: Chocolate and roasted coffee. Mild alcohol smell, hardly noticeable.  Taste: Chocolate coffee with some alcoholic burn.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, very low carbonation.  Drinkability: According to the description Russian Imp Stouts are chocolate with burnt malt flavor, low carbonation, high alcohol. This does all of them and fits the style perfectly.

45,680,sjccmd,4.35,"Winter 09/10 release  Pours thick almost black with brown, maple syrup highlights. A vigorous pour yields an inch and a half voluptuous tan head that leaves a trickle of lacing down the glass.  The smell is rich and roasty. Dark chocolate, roasted, malts, dark roasted coffee grounds, some oak, dark fruits, licorice, a hint of alcohol that increases as it warms.  Dark fruits mingle with roasted flavors in an interesting way. Neither flavor profiles dominate, and they compliment eachother very nicely. The problem that I find in RIS's is that a lot of them, while still be very good, don't taste very unique. While this beer doesn't scream uniqueness, the balance of dark fruit and roasted malt/coffee/chocolate flavors is particularly interesting.  Initially the mouthfeel felt thin and over-carbonated. I believe it was just too cold, because it evens out decently as it warms.  This is pretty easy drinking for the ABV. Towards the end the alcohol starts to take over the flavor, but it's more of a nice warming sensation than a metallic chemical flavor. I think a 12oz serving is the way to go.  Overall a very good, very flavor beer. Sticks to the style very well, but still has a unique flavor.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The flavor is very similar with sweet malt beginnings and vinous backbone. The flavor is strong and overpowers the subtle chocolate flavor.

This beer smells awesome! Sweet, but not too sweet flavors of chocolate, banana, molasses, roasted barley, & roasted coffee show through a long finish with a clear citrus/slightly pine bitter hop finish.(necessary for awesome balance) Great, creamy carbonation. Overall, this is an amazing beer that is extremely smooth...esp. for a 10% abv beer. There is a definite warmth to this beer, but I'd never guess that this is a 10% beer...again...very smooth.

T: Ashy, dark and bitter chocolate, molasses, black coffee, and some raisin flavor. Burnt grains are a bit dry and acrid in the finish but appropriately so and not off balance with sweet malt tones. Again a bit of peppery spice from hops and alcohol and added bitterness but not a big player.  M: Full bodied and smooth carbonation. Some alcohol warmth present.

Taste has some dark chocolate bitterness along with a bit of almost tannin flavor to it, quite interesting. Has a bit of a burnt taste but it works. Very drinkable for an almost 11% beer!

The beer is dark brown, not quite black, and completely opaque.  S - Chocolate, specifically a cocoa powder aroma, leads the way, but I'm struck by how much fruit there is in the nose -- most notably raisin and fig. Underlying the chocolate and fruit are notes of espresso and sherry. No hops detectable.  T - Plenty of chocolate on the palate, pleasantly sweet, with just enough roasted character and hop bitterness to keep the beer balanced. Fruit is there, but not as pronounced as the nose would indicate. Some flavors of coffee and sherry, as well as a bit of warming alcohol. Very cohesive and delicious.  M - Full bodied, no question. Viscous and smooth.  D - A worthy stout, one I'd certainly like to drink again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,sisuspeed,4.03,"Dark, black, no light coming through this one. Decent bubbly head sits on top, leaving silky lacing down the sides of a tulip glass.  Well roasted malts and bit of alcohol come through on the nose. Further inspection leads to some hoppy earth notes mixed with chocolate syrup, but the chocolate notes are fairly subdued.  Burnt, bitter, dark malts ride in on a fairly smooth, creamy body. The chocolate malts are definitely in full force, but the actual chocolate flavor does not really appear until the end of the taste. On the finish, as the warming alcohol clears, a nice, dry, almost chalky, dark-chocolate taste balances on my tongue until I tip back the glass for another taste of this delicious stout. Not really sure what hops were used in this brew, but they jump in and out from time to time. Never really taking the main stage, but leaving a touch of earthy bitterness that pairs well with the dessert like qualities of this beer.  The mouthfeel is quite good. Maybe a little thinner than other RIS's around the 10% ABV range. However, this beer is very drinkable. There is enough bitter flavor to play down the richness of the beer, which allows you to have more than one of these in a sitting if you like.  All in all, I think Brooklyn Brewery did a great job with this beer. They managed to straddle the chocolate stout / RIS categories and come up with something that is very enjoyable. I've only got one of these left, so hopefully I can pick up a few more next time I'm at the candy shop. A tasty and classy brew for the winter holidays.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Tastes strong, sweet, chocolaty and with some serious black malt to back it up. I usually don't like picking up on the black malts, but here it's ok. Carbonation is fine-grained and mouth-filling in what is without it still a pretty heavy body. Very present alcohol. This beer is basically edible in texture. Nice malty bitterness and roasty-ness to round everything out. Mouthfeel is a little grainy from the carbonation, but it goes down smooth. Very easy on the tongue for an RIS.  For what the Black Chocolate Stout is, it's very decent. I would have it again... and again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,Berthold,4.8,"Poured this black beauty in a tulip. Black at SRM40+, the thin dark tan head is supported by low carbonation. Moderate legs and sheen on glass noted. Aroma is roast malt, stone fruit and chocolate. Flavor is a dark roast, slightly biscuit, complex stone fruit with a low bitterness. Mouthfeel is very full bodied with a sweet finish. Warmth from alcohol is noted.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,brokensail,4.15,"Thanks to TheKingsofHops for hooking it up with a couple bottles of this.  A: A 2009-2010 bottle poured into my Cigar City snifter. The pour is a beautiful, viscous, jet black with a thin layer of tan foam.  S: This beer has a very intense nose. A lot of chocolate, coffee, black licorice, roasted malt, and some alcohol. Maybe a bit of maple syrup in there as well.  T: The taste features many of the same characters as the nose. A lot of bitter chocolate, coffee, licorice, and roasted malt. The alcohol is there but not all that noticeable.  M: The body is quite full, as you would expect from an imperial stout. The carbonation also fits the style, as it is low.  D: The ABV is quite well hidden in terms of the taste, but it's quite apparent upon drinking a bottle. Still, the beer is quite tasty.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ditch,3.86,"I'm reviewing a fresh '09-'10.  Poured an impenetrable black with a thick 2 finger tan head that fades slowly to a chunky covering of the top of the glass. Lacing is pretty thick all the way down the glass. I think this is amazing considering the style.  Smell is of sweet dark roasted malts, dates and raisins, slightly smokey.  Taste is chocolate and molasses, with a bitter espresso finish. A slight citrus peel finds it's way through. Alcohol is light and fitting. The flavors come through as it comes to room temperature. Be patient. =)  Mouthfeel is slightly oily. Carbonation leaves a slight sting.  Drinkability is great for this style. If it wasn't for the alcohol content, you could drink this all night. Sits relatively light. But, it's a sipper.  This is going to be a great ager. Fresh is decent but I'm guessing a year or three will make this an outstanding beer!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Gosox8787,4.13,"Presentation: Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance is opaque dark brown to black. One finger mocha colored head with decent retention. Nose is filled with big dark chocolate notes and sweet dark fruits, complimented with some booze. Taste is big chocolate and espresso notes, burnt sugar, and dark fruits. Some smokiness is imparted in the brew as well. Nicely balanced. Mothufeel is full bodied, creamy and chewy. Some carbaonation adds a little bite. The drinkability is average for me. It can be a bit boozy at times and the alcohol content is really high.  Overall, a big chocolate stout with good, balanced flavors. A little age woiuld make this beer even better.

45,680,MVotter,4.08,"A - The Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout pours into a chalice with the appearance of black coffee ... it produces a minimal brown head.  S - Alcohol, sweet malts, molasses, brown sugar, maple syrup.  T - Wonderful ""sweetish"" roasted malts, alcohol, some black licorice and coffee flavors.  M - Medium-heavy with a velvety effervescence ... you know, the kind of bubbles that you don't taste at first because it's a thicker texture ... then you sense thousands of tiny, compact bubbles and fizz on ""a delay.""  D - For 10.50% abv, this is astonishingly balanced and dangerously easy to drink. Absolutely delicious.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Its not hot at all.  M-Rich, creamy, full bodied with what I consider to be a perfect carb level, i.e., not too heavy.  D-For such a big beer, this is easily drinkable.

S: Not over powering in the least, as with most stouts. Mild bittersweet chocolate, toasted malts were present.  M: My favorite part of drinking this beer. Smooth, full bodied, almost creamy. Enjoyed every sip.  T: At the front of your tongue you get the malts, right away. There were several layers of malts all working together wonderfully. In the middle to you get the slight hint of alcohol, just to let you know its there. The back of the mouth and aftertaste is of chocolate, toffee...but not too sweet. Perfectly balanced.

T: Dominated by malts, with a complex range of roasts all standing out individually and blending well: bready, caramel, toffee, and a hint of vanilla with coffee and chocolate coming through at the end. Perfectly balanced in bitterness and residual sweetness. I couldn't help but think ""liquid cake,"" but not candy-sweet. No hot alcohol at all.  M: Creamy and rich body.  D: Incredibly drinkable for 10% ABV. Could be dangerous ;)  I've never been one for the RIS style, but after this beer has encouraged me to explore the style a lot more.

45,680,kegger22,4.2,"Poured a dark brown (OK, black), with a respectable head that rapidly faded to a collar. The aroma was chocolate - duh. The taste was also chocolate but with a bite, both from the alcohol and a surprising amount of carbonation. The feel was full bodied with a lot (just the right amount), carbonation. Drinkability was good for a 10+ ABV. Very good brew.  For some reason, all of my instincts are screaming at me to do a side by side with Lion Stout.

Smell- Roasted malt is powerful, with a faint toast, dark chocolate, and a good hop-dryness to balance.  Taste- Dark chocolate is evident initially, followed by some very tasty toasted black malt, faint coffee and a great hop bitterness. Dark chocolate lingers on the palate along with a slight tinge of alcohol.  Mouthfeel- full bodied, with a satisfying, creamy texture that complements the flavors well. Appropriate (not a whole lot) carbonation.  Drinkability- Heavy and bold, but a well-crafted brew. [with a nice price tag]",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,david18,4.5,"Brooklyn is a surprisingly good brewery and one that's often overlooked by me. They brew perfectly to style and also offer A LOT of unique/extreme beers. The Black Chocolate Stout has a perfect combination of malt and alcohol and the right amount of hops to keep it at the Russian stout level rather than the more extreme American Imperial Stout.  Aroma is great, flavor is very dark grainy with a definitely chocolate overtone, great carbonation, mouthfeel is also great.  I hope they have this around all winter.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Mavajo,4.13,"Poured into a pint glass.  Appearance is absolute black with a moderate tan/brown head. Lacing is moderate, spotty.  Nose is of roasted caramel malts, chocolate, coffee. Taste is primarily of chocolate with some coffee, and layered with dark caramel malts. Sweet, not particularly bitter. Alcohol taste is noticeable, but not overbearing.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, slightly creamy with a good amount of carbonation. This brew is very approachable and the alcohol is not nearly as overpowering as in many other imperial stouts. It's filling, as to be expected, so that tempers the drinkability.  All in all, a very enjoyable brew and one of my favorites of the style to date.

45,680,woosterbill,3.73,"12 oz bottle, winter 09-10 vintage (10.0%, not 10.6), into a Duvel tulip.  A: Deep black body with garnet highlights against the light; two fingers of light brown head show good retention and a full blanket of fine lacing.  S: Roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, and ripe dried fruits. Pretty nice, but surprisingly understated.  T: Anything but understated on this front: intense chocolate, fruit, and alcohol form a whirlwind of in-your-face flavor. The chocolate and alcohol come together nicely on the finish, but that's the only place where any harmony exists in this big, hot beer. Maybe some age would help matters, but as it is this is an engaging (albeit ultimately unpleasantly overwhelming) brew.  M: Beautiful - rich, full-bodied, with tons of nice, soft carbonation. Just a little warm and syrupy on the finish. Perfect for the style.  D: Too much heat and an unbalanced assault of flavors keep this from being truly drinkable, but it's certainly intriguing on enough levels to keep me interested.  Notes: Great beer to try, but I was hoping for more straightforward chocolate dominance. It may also have suffered by comparison, as the last RIS I had was FBS (which absolutely blew me away); this was good, but by no means great.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The pour is a dark, opaque brownish-black with a fluffy tan head and a lot of lingering lacing. This has 10% ABV but you would not know it with the aroma. The smell is of mild chocolate malts and neutral hops. A full bodied mouthfeel dances on my tongue and down my throat. As for the taste, it is true to the enticing aroma.

45,680,kzoobrew,4.13,"Black as a cloud covered midnight. No highlights, no gleaming no hint of light sneaking through anywhere. Some of the darkest beer I have ever seen. Creamy head measures about a finger and a half. Retention is rather decent and lacing exceptional.  Sweet caramel, chocolate and smooth roastiness. Pleasant boozy aroma I have grown to enjoy and expect from the style. If anything is lacking from the nose I would prefer to have a stronger roasted, charred malt presence.  Sweet chocolate and roasted malt flavors show first. Warming alcohol stops short of coming of as hot. Coffee flavors show up on the back end. While the hop characteristics are picked up the bitterness plays off the roasted characteristics providing more of a coffee like bitterness.  Full but not heavy body. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. My preference for the style is for a ever so slightly thicker body I feel that the body and flavor mesh remarkably well.  Fantastic brew, thank you to UA8 for supplying the opportunity to enjoy this one. I would love for this to be a winter staple but unfortunately it is not available in my area.

S: Roasted malts, dark fruits, cherries, burnt coffee, and some alcohol. I also smell the chocolate, but it's much more subtle than I expected. Pretty standard aroma for a sweet stout I'd say.  T: Espresso and mocha most apparent along with some sweet dark fruits. Bitter chocolate on the finish. It's pretty good, but doesn't really taste significantly different than lots of other sweet RIS I've had. As with the nose I was expecting a more distinct chocolate.  M: Very smooth, creamy feel and a nice full body. This beer really shines in this respect. Alcohol hidden fairly well, but you definitely feel the warming effects.  D: A pretty good RIS. However, for a limited release the emphasizes chocolate in its name I was a little disappointed.

My god does this have a bitter chocolate after taste  Mouthfeel: Thick molasses and syrupy texture with a heavy overall body.

Smell consists of a dark fruit presence upfront, with some mild chocolate and coffee notes sitting in the background.  Taste is not actually as chocolate-y as I had anticipated; burnt coffee tends to be a more dominating flavor, along with a molasses and brown sugar character. A mild bitter chocolate note comes through on the finish.  Mouthfeel is a little light for a Russian Imperial Stout, but there is still a full quality to the beer.  This is a decently drinkable beer, overall. The ABV is certainly concealed well, but I can't help but feel like there are other RIS's I'd be inclined to pick instead.

Appearance: The color is jet black and definitely opaque. It raises a tall tan head that is thick, creamy and hangs on very well. It slowly fades down to a tight cap of foam that makes lots of splotchy lacing on the glass.  Smell: For a big 10% beer there is very little suggestion of its alcoholic strength. I get more roasted barley and grain brown sugar and molasses. Light notes of alcohol just seek into the background.  Taste/Palate: I'm hit with a big rich sweetness up front with notes caramel, brown sugar and molasses. Next comes gooey dark bitter chocolate brownies and deep roasted barley and grain notes. Solid herbal/leafy hops finishes thing of along with a gentle warming alcohol. The palate has a good full body with a slick texture and just enough carbonation to keep things from getting cloying or to syrupy.  Notes: This is a truly outstanding BIG beer.

Smells of espresso, dark chocolate, small hint of raisin, fig dark fruit, but very minimal, just the way I like it. Very bold, but mellow. The sweet darkness engulfs your mouth. The chocolate malt is evident with a bitter faintly hoppy finish. It has a very commanding presence on the palate, but no where near overbearing. Notes are mainly coffee, raisin and fig. The finish leaves some smoke and fruit. This is a full bodied beer, black velvet! This beer is a high-wire balancing act. Not too heavy, but it is a deep dark menacing beast.

45,680,beerwolf77,4.23,"I was planning on sitting on this bad boy but everytime I looked at my beer stash this one begged to be drank.  Poured into my pint glass the beer is black as night. Maybe a slight tint of brown can be seen when holding it directly in front of a lamp. A careful pour gives me about a half inch of light brown head that dissipates leaving lace rings all around the rim.  The aroma is roasted coffee beans, burnt malt, dark chocolate with maybe a hint of dark fruit from the high abv.  The flavor is a fantastic mix of rich coffee dark and milk chocolate and toasted bread. This is spot on RIS. The dry bitter coffee blended with the chocolate make for a perfect balance of flavor. The high ABV can hardly be detected at all.  Medium to full body. A touch slick for my tastes. A decent amount of carbonation.  A mighty fine RIS in my book.

This beer is truly black as night, even when held directly in front of a light bulb there was no lightening whatsoever around the corners of the tumbler.  S - Robust alcohol aroma is primary, with secondary notes of chocolate, fermented citrus, roasted malts, coffee, and tangy molasses. Interesting.  T - A bit sharp and biting at first with a strong mix of roasted malts and chocolate competing for primacy with smoke, black cherry and coffee. As I travel farther down the glass the alcohol relocates and softens the bite backwards to a mere barbecue-esque, molasses driven tang in the throat. Its like eating a bouyant chocolate steak.  M - very nice combination of creamy texture and carbonation. lays right across the top of the tongue, but isnt afraid to bust out in bubbles if jostled enough.

As you tilt and rotate the glass, you can see the beer has just a little bit of ""legs"" to it.  In the aroma dark chocolate predominates, along with some roasted notes, and a small touch of alcohol.  The mouthfeel is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The beer tastes like dark chocolate and roasted grains initially, followed by a substantial bitter/roasty bite.  This is very easy to drink for a Russian imperial stout.

Smell seems a little on the subdued side, though there is a rich chocolate aroma, a little roasty malt, and a small cherry note.  The chocolate flavor is improved upon as I sip-- it becomes a bitter but tasty mixture of coffee and chocolate. After a few sips, I recognize hops accompanying the chocolate-malt goodness, and the presence of alcohol just makes itself known at the end of each sip, but only slightly so.  Mouthfeel is quite creamy up until the hop flavor lays down on the tongue with a drying effect.

Very malty, roasty, slightly bitter with alcohol hints. Chocolate rounds out the finish.  Coffee and some sort of dark fruits are the first tastes. Slight hop bitterness, roasted malts, and bitter dark chocolate end it all.  It's medium to full, with a nice coating feel.  Fairly drinkable. It's a pretty good brew all in all, not something I would load up on. Glad I tryed it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,katan,3.26,"12 oz into a goblet - the 2009 version (10.0%)  A - Very dark, opaque. Just maybe, in the right light, some amber highlights. Head formation is more of a quick film than a foam, sitting there with a few bubbles. Certainly has the viscous look of a stout.  S - Malts are the most dominant characteristic. A two-row dominated beer, but I can detect some caramel and chocolate malt notes. Roasted barley, of stout fame, is very light, hardly perceptible.  T - Starts off with a malt sweetness, but it is immediately overcome by a hopping - unknown which kind, and a very biting alcohol hit. Viscous - biting - grabbing. Amazing amount of phenolic tones throughout this beer. Stouts should be very capable of hiding alcohol - this beer is not. The roasted barley comes through after that, with some almost acidic, cold coffee press type flavors. Aftertaste is the real bittersweet chocolate I was hoping for, slowly dissipating on the taste buds.  M - Moderate body - not off the charts either way for a RIS. Certain seems more driven by carbonation than by a developed beer body. Leaves behind a very oily, clinging film that only reenforces the flavors - which in this case was not good.  D - Nothing drinkable here. The near acidic old coffee flavors combined with the whammy of alcohol in both flavor and consumption make this nothing near a session beer, let along a 2 beer evening from a four pack.  I am going to age my other 3 from the 4 pack to see if 2009 settles down. In this state, I wouldn't want to drink another again. Very disappointing considering it comes from someone I admire so much, Garrett Oliver.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Great hop presence, great mouthfeel I am putting the last two of this four pack in the cellar to age. Drinkability I have to give a 4 because I wanted a second but fear what would happen if I drank all four.  Great job by Brooklyn Brewery, I really enjoy their brown but have not had this before.

45,680,natelocc787,3.6,"This beer didn't live up to they hype IMO. Appearance was common RIS with a slight gold dust effect in the head. Nose was was chocolate, booze and roasted barley. The taste was nice and trying to be complex but not too much to this stout overall. Chocolaty, somewhat bitter, medium hop presence for the style, some alcohol in the finish. Tasted like it could really benefit from a year or two in the cellar. Needs time to mellow, too fresh maybe. Considering it's only .6 points away from the Rasputin's average score-I don't agree. Not near as well crafted.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,infi,4.07,"09/10 release.  Poured into a snifter.  Smoothly pours out like a typical stout and releases a thin tan head that lingers for a few seconds. A total dark and opaque color in the glass with small amounts of rising and bubbling streams around. Nice spotty lacing throughout also. Aroma is beautifully roasted and full of sweet chocolate, malts, a bit of alcohol and surprisingly coated with cinnamon. Cinnabon in a glass essentially - really appealing on the nose to the point of intoxication. Such a beautiful fragrance resonating from the glass.  Taste is moderately roasted - not as potent as other RIS's I've had in the past. Begins with a nice malty presence then enters a cocoa and chocolate element and finally finishes on a slight bittersweet chocolate astringency and warmth from the 10% ABV, which was masked incredibly well. Not a whole lot of big appeal on the flavor component, but it's textbook RIS in terms of the actual flavors.  The mouthfeel is smooth, yet light-bodied with mild carbonation. A bit lacking in the overall feel for an RIS, but other than that it's easy drinking. Drinkability is fair - not as tasty and flavorful as I was hoping. Not really worthy to drink all four in a night's session, but probably best to set some off to add some age. Not bad, but not incredible.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Vonerichs,3.88,"Looks like a RIS should. Dark brown to black with a slight cinnamon colored head. Moderate lacing.  The smell is definitively dark chocolate and roasted malt, but is subdued and not as strong as most RIS.  The chocolate is center stage in the taste, but not overdone. There's a light bitterness and roasted malt in the middle. The aftertaste is a bit sour, which is a little odd in a stout. I did notice that as this warms that sourness is replaced with much more bitterness and a coffee aftertaste.  Creamy, thick, and mild carbonation.  Drinkability is above average for such a high abv. Alcohol is barely detectable.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,prattmeister14,4.1,"I had this beer on my 21st and thought it was the best beer I had ever had or will ever have...since then I've beefed up my beer resume and realized that while it's pretty good, its not the best.  That being said its s pretty good RIS. Its thick and complex a little chocolaty in the smell, but not overpowering in the taste. It has the little extra kick that a RIS should have over other stouts. It's a little more complex it has a little more of the undefinable substance that is needed in a RIS. The alcohol flavor is there (its 10% for crying out loud!)  One beer was plenty and the drinkibility suffers from the high ABV (but then again its a RIS, what did I expect).  Overall: Good to try, nice product, but with so many other RIS's out there, why stop here.

45,680,Brenden,4.03,"I'm initially concerned that it's almost finished pouring without forming a head, when, toward the end, I get a beautiful cascade effect forming a near-perfect one finger head. This just off-white head never fades to less than half a finger and leaves a patchy sheet of lacing over a black brew that lets in almost no light. The aroma is first like sniffing cocoa powder out of the can, then some roasted coffee notes come through with some dark fruits underneath. The chocolate lingers all the way through the sip underneath a dominant malt flavor involving a combination of various malts in near-perfect sync. A hops presence is noted that adds balance without taking away from the chocolate, and the dark fruits sit just beneath it all. Alcohol is evident the entire way, sometimes overcoming the flavors in the sip and especially toward the end. Some may consider the feel a little thin for the style, and it may be; it is, however, thick and rich and well-complimented by a little bit of a crisp feel.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

A bit of alcohol and a definite warming sensation. Medium-full body with fairly strong carbonation.

45,680,mbudner,3.88,"'09-'10 release. Poured from bottle into a stemless red wine glass.  A- Very little head, which dissipated almost immediately. Deep black, completely opaque with a tan head.  S- The aroma is dominated by a deep, roasted, bitter chocolate. I'm definitely picking up some of the heat of the booziness in my nostrils, but nothing alarming or unnatural from an RIS. As it warms, I'm getting a sweeter smell, which I still associate with the chocolate.  T- The very first taste I notice is bitter and/or burnt flavor. The booze is much hotter than I remember from previous years or than the aroma would have you believe. The malts taste of roasted bitterness and the chocolate character becomes much more apparent the brew warms and the alcohol becomes less apparent.  M- I must begin by admitting that I have trouble not getting hung up on the mouthfeel of an RIS. I love the attribute often described as being ""chewy"" and this stout does not fit the bill. This beer a little thin for my preference for an RIS and slightly too ""prickly"" or effervescent in its carbonation. Just having a little trouble getting past the lack of body.  D- Not very high, unfortunately. Bear in mind that this is in large part due to the how new the beer is. I have had it several months old in years past and have not found the ""hotness"" to be as big of an issue with a few months under the belt of this beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

T: Does this thought make you drowsy? Maybe a little overwhelmed by the notion of eternal damnation? Well try and not cry in your stout. You have already lost your soul. The least you could do would be to enjoy the burnt cocoa nibs and coffee flavors. Don't worry, the unholy bitterness will not mislead you into thinking that there is some escape from your fate.  M: Speechless, I see. A brew this smooth is not allowed in heaven. No no, but there is plenty of this where you are going.  D: Not that you will be able to imbibe too much of this, as I see the roughly 11% ABV is catching up with you. This is a doozy of a brew. Take your time.

Some beers just change with age, BBCS is better in pretty much every respect with one year on it. The sweetness, bitterness, alcohol, and roastyness are just about in perfect balance.  Judging by the change from a year ago, I don't think this is one of those RISs good for 10 years. I'm guessing it will still be damn good for another year or so, and then it will start going down hill.  There is a slight possibility that the dark fruits I am picking up that were totally not there a year ago will get a lot stronger. If that turns out to be the case, then in 2 more years we could have something magical on our hands - I kind of doubt it, though.  All-in-all, I will be picking up some of this every year from now on. It's great, but not ground breaking.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

I also got a single 08-09 bottle from BA Beerlando, thanks Bryan!  09-10 version poured into a tulip.  Pours a deep black color, completely absorbing all light cast into it. Thick brown sugar colored head is produced after an aggressive pour. Initially, I poured this one carfully and I didn't get any head, so I tried again a little less careful. Great retention and excellent lacing, covering the entire glass.  The nose on this one is excellent. Roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate (and yes I know it's not brewed with real chocolate), dark fruits, and even a bit of roasted coffee beans. Excellent smelling RIS.  Taste is similar to the nose. I get a nice roasted barley character - although it's much more mellow in the taste, I also get the bitter bakers chocolate and roasted coffee. The dried dark fruits come out a little bit more in the taste, which surprised me, but I find it very tasty.  Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, with a very smooth and creamy finish. Excellent stuff. Drinkability is amazing. The 10% is hidden expertly. I could drink this all night.  Overall, a very solid RIS. Excellent drinkability and a boat load of flavor and substance.

45,680,natasharai,4.22,"Appearance: Poured with a creamy tan head that dissipated leaving some lacing toward the top of my glass. The beer is black and lets no light through at all.  Smell: Sweet molasses , toffee, a little chocolate, roasted malt, some sweet dark fruit like dark cherry and plum. Small alcohol aroma toward the end, but not much considering it is 10.6% ABV.  Taste: Sweet toffee, molasses, very strong roasted malt flavor, sweet raisins, very small chocolate, slight smokey flavor, very small alcohol flavor toward the end.  Mouthfeel: Medium/thick body, medium amount of carbonation, very smooth, a small amount of dry feel from the strongly roasted malts, leaves mouth pretty sticky sweet.  Overall: Really good drinkability for the ABV. Very sweet and strong roasted malt are most prevalent. Very little chocolate, but this is about 8 months old. Very yummy stout though.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MenamenaDooDoo,4.85,"Really beautiful pour, its as black as it promises with a nice tan head. The aroma is sweet with dark chocolate, a little coffee and roasted malt. The real victory here is the mouthfeel and taste. I love Imperial Stouts, but sometimes they can be over the top with the alcohol and its burns or warms the throat too much, while not providing enough flavor. The Brooklyn Brewery delivers!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BarrelO,4.03,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Winter 09-10. 10% ABV.  A: Body is black as coal. Giant tan head fades to a thin film and leaves quite a bit of lacing.  S: Licorice, dark fruit, bitter chocolate, and a bit of tobacco.  T: A brutal assault of slightly sweet but mostly bitter chocolate. Kind of like biting into an 80% cacao chocolate bar. Aftertaste is smoky and fruity. Fairly noticeable alcohol.  M: Not as heavy as other examples of the style, but reasonably heavy.  D: It took me a while to get this beer, but now that I do, it's a very solid RIS. Definitely a cigar beer. I'd like to try it with some gourmet chocolate sometime.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mikey711,4.06,Poured into a Perfect Pint Glass.  A: Dark black and syrupy with an espresso head on top. Head retention is very good as a thin but frothy head about a quarter of an inch thick remains on top of the beer. Lacing is excellent  S: Rich chocolate smell with some bitter roastiness. Also a little bit of fruitiness.  T: Dark chocolate sweetness balanced by a nice roasted bitter note. Also has some nice toffee and espresso notes.  M: Great creaminess with only a mild hint of alcohol.  D: This is a pretty heavy beer and one that sips nicely over a long period of time.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,digr,4.3,"This is a beer from the 2008-09 winter bottling.  A- Pours a thick bodied stout with a slight thick brown head. Similar to some other Imperial style stouts. The carbonation waits until the end of the pour to raise the bubbles and head.  S - A nice smell - not strong, soft mild malty smell - almost like chocolate. Lives up to the name.  Taste - The taste is surprisingly mellow. LOTS of malty chewy goodness. No over the top burnt black patent flavor, which is a nice surprise. As the liquid warms the flavors evolve. There is a definite sweetness that rounds out the dark malt and roasted flavors. You can't really notice the hops, but they must be in there to add to the balance. Initial sip has some alcohol hotness - however by the second sip the overall balance covers that up. The aftertaste may be the best part - leaves the taste of the malts in between your teeth and on your tongue. Yummy.  M - Great mouthfeel as long as you like them chewy. Really - I like beers of substance and this one has it. It is almost like dessert, but a fine one at that. Thick but smooth like a well made mousse that slides down and coats you with velvet.  D - Ok so I started the with a 3.5 becuase it is so stong, but since the beer is now more than 50 % consumed it easy easy for me to drink. Not that one should drink too many of these at 10%ABV... But I think I could.  This is a beer from the 2008-09 winter bottling. This may have added to its pleasantness since these types of beers take to maturation well.  This is the second time I had this beer, and I liked it even more the second time around. Great Job BB!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,astout,4.32,"inky thick and black appearance with a thin layer of tan head that dissipates into a nice lace with good retention around the rim.  Plenty of sweet dried fruit; dates, figs, prunes along with an espresso chocolate aroma. Almost reminds me of a combination of glossette raisins and espresso.  Quite sweet on the palate with a lot of warming alcohol behind the espresso chocolate up front. Mid palate you got almost a chocolate zucchini loaf type sweetness and bready flavour. Finishes with a drier espresso and cooca nib profile with a slight hop presence showing through. Warms at the back of the throat all the way down to the chest, very nice winter warmer.  Creamy and thick syrupy texture with very little carbonation. Reminds of either the weight of creamy frothy espresso or real hot chocolate (probably as much do to the flavour as texture). Lingers pleasantly and seems to coat the whole mouth, along with the lingering cocoa notes helps the beer last forever.  Despite the weight and the alcohol I can see being able to drink a lot of this, and that definitely speaks to the way it carries the heavy array of sweetness, cocoa and booze. The slight hop presence and cocoa nib bitterness on the finish definitely help in relieving that. Overall surprisingly drinkable, perfect winter warmer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DawnL,2.79,Brown lacing atop a jet black brew.  There isn't very much on the nose.  The palate has some cocoa and a wooden hops character. It doesn't seem to go with the style.  The finish is very bitter and not very chocolatey. There is a chalky character from the cocoa?  I found this brew rather disappointing.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,scootny,4.85,"A beautiful black browness. Opaque with a generous head and good lacing. Sticky. A thin covering and a firm ring on the edge.  Sweet delicious chocolate malts. Sweet alcohol. Molasses and chewy dark breads. Imagine bottle of stout meets Godiva chocolate box.  Taste is just unreal. An alcoholic chocolate syrup that blossoms into a balanced though hot, stouty dark malt breadiness. Firm and multilayered hops give a good balance to the goings on in the glass. Cocoa and mocha fade into coffee here. There is a good lingering charcoal presence that cuts into the rather sweet body at the finish helping the hops to make a statement.  Feel is silky with a light syrupiness. Carbonation is smooth, balancing the high og and breaking up a thick, girthy brew.  This stuff is way to easy to put down. A growler is just so smooth compared to the bottled version, unless it is cellared. Nonetheless you can just about chug this one if you want but it would be such a waste. Savor this one folks.

Aroma-Almost equal between chocolate and coffee but chocolate prevails. Coffee is subtle and mild. No burn't flavors in this brew that usually show up in many imperial stouts. Dark fruit and alcohol makes it more complex. Flavor-Very complex. Coffee takes the lead this time ahead of chocolate with strong but smooth alcohol tones backing it up. For dark fruits I get raison. Very nice. Roasted bitter finish. I'm sure hops are involved but hard to tell with the roasted malts. Mouthfeel-Full body.

45,680,wl0307,4.35,"""Limited Bottling - Winter 07-08"", 10.6%abv., served cool in Gulden Draak's tulip-shaped sniffer.  A: a force pour results in a 5cm thick creamy brown head sitting on top of a jet black body and semi-lively streams of fine bubbles. S: sweeter than your (or my) usual RIS, the aroma is packed with sweet treacle, chocolates, with a touch of vanilla; equally pronounced is the input of American flowery hops that lifts up the body skilfully. As the froth retreats and given a good swirl, there're hints of sweet nuts and black prune jam, but not quite assertive to be able to challenge the thick malty and lively hoppy theme. T: oily smooth, almost lubricating comes the foretaste, full of bitter-sweet chocolaty+treacle-ish malts to start off with, yet it's quickly surrounded by milk-cocoa-like sweet nuttiness that lingers pleasantly in the long but un-imposing aftertaste, while dry-ish roastiness, delicate black-prune jammy fruits and a faintly burned nutty edge are closely behind. The medium level of hop bitterness catches up in good time, along with the tarred malts, render an aromatic yet also slightly spicy/peppery finish. M&D: more smooth and elegant than the 08-09 vintage tasted six months ago, this slightly more mature bottle shows a very good depth and marvellous drinkability. The lingering bitterness keeps my tongue really ""busy"" way after each sip is done - the depth of bitterness and aroma truly is remarkable. Not a very bold example for an American RIS, but a somewhat balanced and likable one.  * Tasting Date: 18/02/09 ""Limited Bottling - Winter 08-09"", at 10%abv., served cool in De Dolle Oerbier's long-stemmed goblet. 4 A: nearly black with a little brown hues when seen against light, coming with rather light carbonation and a well-lasting thin layer of tan froth. 4 S: thickly malty with lots of oily dark malts (with the roasted nutty edge), melted black sugar, a rich chocolate aroma, a light hint of winey sourness, and also plentiful hoppy scent of American flowery hops, while a layer of alc. seems to hover in the air... If the alc. edge could be milder, the aroma would've been more enticing and complex. 4.5 T: the initial sip shows rather fine and oily texture with very restrained level of carbonation, featuring semi-sweet jammy dark-fruits, bitter dark chocolates, and assertive malt syrup that show up pretty quiet and elegant on the palate, but then in no time a wave of deepening bitter hoppiness, burned walnuts, Chinese smoked black prunes with a faint touch of licorice-flavoured bitter chocolates expands freely, rendering a harmonious aftertaste where one can sense the balance reached b/w nuttiness, dried Chinese root herbs, bitterness from hops and roast malts, a dry-ish palate and a kick from sour grapey-fruits. Of course, the bitter elements would outlast the others, but only just... 4 M&4.5 D: medium-bodied, oily on the texture, richly flavoured but never too alcoholic to jeopardise the harmonious palate. All in all, I find this vintage more interesting and complex than my previous encounter, but this bottle is served less cool and also consumed well after the ale was poured (40 minutes) - maybe ""decanting"" actually helps to bring out the best?! Marvellous beer!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,apbarwood,4.6,"Appearance- Almost menacing. Jet black with a fluffy brown head. Truly a thing of beauty.  Smell- Roasted with a hint of sweetness. Coffee and chocolate mostly with some dark fruit flavors lurking deep in the background.  Taste- Dark, dark chocolate and cocoa powder, with a bittersweet taste with roasted coffee flavors with a slightly hopped quality.  Mouthfeel- Warm and thick. Very full-bodied.  Drinkability- The alcohol can be a bit much at times but it ages exceptionally well as a result and mellows over time. Upon release it's pretty forceful and may scare away the faint of heart but after you've had a glass you'll never be the same. Definitely works well as an after dinner beer either with deserts or by itself. If you're a beer cocktail kind of person, drop a scoop of ice cream in and make a float.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,washburnkid,4.25,"I had an '07 and '08 side by side. They're two pretty different beers in my opinion. Score will be based on the '07.  '07 A small tan head over a very dark brew, black with mahogany edges. Aromas are fruity, with dark berries and even banana. Not as much chocolate on the nose and no alcohol present. Flavors bring in chocolate with a bang! Tons of milk and dark chocolate. Still some dark berries in there, too. My favorite flavor profile in this beer though is the heavy oak/wood flavor that covers the palate. You would have thought this brew was barrel-aged. Some roasted espresso in there, too. The body is pretty thick, but still easy to drink as the alcohol is hard to find.  '08 A slightly bigger head results from the pour on this one. Dark fruits are discernible, but not as present as the '07. Alcohol is much more noticeable on this one...it's actually pretty hot. There is chocolate and espresso in the flavor but it is not as clean, it actually gets lost in the alcohol. Thinner mouthfeel and a drying effect, which is something I did not experience in the '07.  Overall, a good beer that I would highly recommend. A bit of age does wonders for this stout.

T- Chocolate, alcohol, toffee, a bit of roasted malt on the finish. With time the chocolate has mellowed, giving way to a raisin/toffee/roasted flavor. Definitely a different beast than before. Alcohol still apparent. A bit spicy on the finish--almost oaky.  M- Creamy, but lighter than I had hoped for. Astringent finish.  D- Fresh on-tap or aged, this is a damn good beer.

Though the head is course, retention is excellent. Upon dissipation, lacing along the glass is amazing. This is the type of lacing you only see in commercials of beer  S: A strong chocolate and molasses scent covers the alcohol well. A hint of dark fruit can be detected also, though this is fairly faint compared to the other rising odors.  T: Sweet molasses and dark fruit on opening, the milk chocolate becomes more apparent upon warming in my mouth. Aftertaste is of toasted malts. You smell the alcohol in this brew but I almost never really got the overwhelming alcohol flavor I expected which is definitely a plus. Though the flavors are moderately complex, there are certainly dominant tastes that come to the forefront of this beer.  M: Silky with low carbonation and deep bodied.

45,680,PEBKAC,3.84,"32oz growler from New Beer.  Began prepping for a little stout tasting tomorrow. Have plenty of this aging/dying in the basement, but I don't recall having one in a couple years actually. Don't drink too many stouts willingly. I'm trying to get the taste back for this style, but it's been pretty sticky out here with the on & off rain. Maybe not the best time for a growler of motor oil, but I'm not working tomorrow. :)  Pint glass pour. Inky black, with a tall, slowly receding, sandy tan head.  Smell is of baby powder(?) & really dark, rich chocolate. An indication of butter cookies & less noticeable macerated cherries come through. Butter is not something I recall. Nothing very intense, except for the expected alcoholic fumes.  Taste is creamy with lactose & more residual sweetness then I last remember. Not quite velvety though. That rides for a while before the middle-end, which turns quite bitter with roast & light coffee grounds. Finish is full of bitter, leafy greens & soy ink(think licking your fingers after thoroughly flipping through the NY Times). Carbonation is subtle, but I can feel it trying. Alcohol is so obvious. A very stout beer.  Tasted like a sweet stout to me. Not what I believe it is in the bottle(or it could of just been tweaked again), but I just might like this version a little better. Actually added 5oz to a little cake batter earlier, so I could be burping this up by the time I'm chewing on that. :D",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The alcohol is still well hidden in taste but mouthfeel is flaming hot. Mouthfeel is actually pretty thick on this one, not sure what I was thinking back in the day, bumping it up to 4.0. The fresh 09 is much hoppier and aggressive than the one year aged 08. The 08 tasted like chocolate chips straight out of the bag. Definitely looking forward to aging this one.  Original Review 7-23-09 (4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5) Found this one today at my local store, good find IMO, 2008. Poured pitch black into my pint glass with a dark tan one finger head that disappeared within a minute or two into a blanket on top of the beer. Light to medium lacing throughout the glass. Smelled of chocolate, roasted malts, a bit of alcohol and maybe a hint of fruit. Tastes of dark chocolate, roasted malts, some sweetness, smoke. Maybe a bit of coffee in the smell/taste too. Mouthfeel fell a bit short on this one, a bit on the light side for an imperial. Alcohol hidden very well, good carbonation and smooth feel. Drinkability is good here because the taste is very good and the beer doesnt feel too heavy, no alcohol notes either makes this stout go down good.

Secondary malts, like coffee and butterscotch provide good complements, but this one's all about the chocolate.  M: Not as heavy as I expected from the Imperial, but still respectable with a good, lasting finish.  D: I can have many of these without noticing the high ABV.

45,680,eat,4.43,"Obtained as part of a recent trade (today) with ritzkiss. Thanks! 355ml bottle dated winter 08-09.  Pours a viscous, oily black. No light shines through this one. The head was slow to rise but eventually showed up with full force. An incredibly thick, mocha coloured head; the consistency of frothed milk. Good retention and lacing.  The smell is beautiful; freshly baked bread, dark chocolate, cappuccino, molasses, dark roasted malt. A little weaker smelling that I would like.  The flavour isn't what I was expecting but is great nonetheless. Dark roasted malt and molasses are up front with some equally balanced background notes of dark chocolate and dark roasted coffee. It doesn't taste as much like actual chocolate as other chocolate stouts I've had but is impressive in that it contains to actual chocolate. For being made with barley, hops and yeast this is a great effort. I might rate this a 4.5 on taste if it didn't call itself a chocolate stout as the chocolate is not all that pronounced. Only the slightest hint of any alcohol; probably the best disguising of any 10% beer I've ever had (not 10.6% as listed here). The alcohol is perfectly blended with the other flavours. This is a very well balanced beer.  This stout has one of the best mouthfeels I've ever sampled. Full bodied, bready and so thick; the feel highlights the subtle flavours in the best possible way. This is usually my main complaint about otherwise good stout: they aren't thick enough. Not so with this one, though. I wish all stouts felt like this. Very lightly carbonated. Perfect for this beer.  I could sip on these all night. This is a tasty, interesting imperial stout that won't knock-out your taste buds like some others in the same category. 0.5 off only for being so strong in the ABV; you wouldn't be able to finish many of these before they finish you.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

I expected more chocolate flavor from this beer on par with the Smuttynose Robust Porter, which I think is the most Chocolately beer I've had.

Alcohol peeks in as it gets warmer but isn't overbearing.  Taste starts off very sweet on the front of the tongue. Dark fruity sweetness reminiscent of a nice belgian quad. Good rich dark and milk chocolates with a well-balanced roastiness at the sides of the tongue. A bit of warmth in my throat.  Good carbonation. Thick and rich.

Beer was completely opaque and topped with a quick thick brown head, which sustained surprisingly well.  S-Aromas of chocolate and heavy roasted barley dominated, with hints of dark fruity esters as well. As I expected, though, the name says it all: chocolate.  T-This is one indulgent brew :D Thick with chocolate flavors, dark and dry, at times almost bitter chocolate. This deep chocolate character pairs beautifully with the in-balance roasted malt flavors. In with it all, some estery, almost sweetish flavors make themselves apparent.  M-Fully, creamy body, at times somewhat oily, but really more like a thick milkshake. Wonderful. Carbonation was low, playing well off the full body.  D-This beer is a winter seasonal, so I didn't expect to have an opportunity to drink it while I was in New York. However, the Peculiar Pub had bottles of it, and knowing it's high ABV would allow for increased shelf life of this brew, I went for it.

S- Strong aroma of dark chocolate, roasted malts, a touch of dark caramel and I really can't pick up any hops. Just a bit of alcohol here too.  T- Taste of chocolate, caramel and roasted malts. Some drinks taste really sweet while others maybe a little bitter. Quite a bit going on here and complex.  M- Medium to full in body and low carbonation.  D- A very solid brew and a sipper for sure.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

To me this drinks way more like a Baltic Porter than a RIS. It is very sweet, but not in a good way and the alcohol is too pronounced.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,dancinwillie,4.42,"Bottle reads winter 08-09. Poured into the only clean glass I had, a goblet. Black when pouring, black in the glass. Darkish tan creamy head, with light tan around the edge.  A lot going on in the nose. Chocolate, both sweet and bitter, seem to dominate. A small dose of vanilla also. A little toasted scent underneath.  Chocolate in great measure. Milk, dark, and bittersweet. Some vanilla, some caramel. A wonderful roasted flavor underneath. Some light hopping, slightly bitter, and no guess as to the variety. I don't notice any alcohol bite, no fusels, but a pretty good warming in my chest. Once this hits the back end of my tongue, it tastes almost exactly like a moist devil's food cake.  Incredibly smooth, medium long sweet finish. I have 3 more of these delicious beers, thanks to JoeMayo for the trade, and I think I'll save them for a rainy day. To emulate Mr. Oliver, I'll think I'll try and pair this with some food. Perhaps with a chicken with mole sauce from my local Mexican joint, and I'll have another one for dessert! Cheers!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DannyS,4.23,"Served in a Duvel tulip, poured from a 12 oz. bottle.  A - A rich, inky black with a coffee brown head that settles quick but leaves a nice foam collar and lots of sticky, spotty lacing.  S - Lots of dark, roasted malts with a very subtle hop character, backed up by chocolate, coffee and a hint of smokiness.  T - The rich, bitter chocolate comes through, backed up well by the roasty coffee malts. It's surprisingly mellow on the bitterness, finishing cleaner that most RIS's, yet still lghtly bitter and smoky. The bitterness comes through more as it warms up, taking on more roasted coffee characteristics.  M - Velvety smooth with just enough carbonation to give it an absolute perfect body and weight for the style. Lovely.  D - The bitterness stays moderate throughout drinking, and the alcohol is hidden very well. Great drinkability for such a big beer.  Overall - For everyday drinking, I'm a pale ale/lager/hefe guy. But sometimes, you just want a big bold stout to sip and savor. Another great beer from the magic man in Brooklyn. Thank you, Garret Oliver.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

This one tastes of bitter, dark chocolate and has a definite roasted character, some malt sweetness on the front of the palate and a dry, bitter finish. The mouthfeel is thick and viscous, very full bodied.  Drinkability: more on the bitter than the sweet side, and quite strong for a chocolate stout. Perhaps a dessert beer to complement a sweeter dish.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

A bit malty. Really delicious and smoky.  M: Big taste, full and warm.  D: A sipper. Big alcohol taste, but really delicious if you're into imperial stouts.  Overall, a really good beer. I've been into stouts lately and I really enjoy this one, it's strong, but not too bitter or alcoholic.

45,680,05Harley,4.2,"Bottled during the Winter 07-08  Purchased @ Julio's Liquors, Westborough Mass  Price - $42.99/case  I enjoy this beer on a regular basis and so as a stout fan I chose this for my first review.  Appearance: Pours black with no light penetration. The name says it all. Tan head initially but dissipates quickly. Some lacing present but more of a sticky appeal.  Smell: Heavy smell of delicious bitter chocolate, yum.  Taste: A rich bitter chocolate taste. More on the dry side in my opinion. If you looking for sweet, look elsewhere.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with very little carbonation.  Dinkability: Highly drinkable. I prefer it on the cool side at a temperature of 50 degrees. Closer to 60 degrees and I get a slight alchohol burn which is no surprise at 10%. I love this beer.  What's nice is I can buy this localy in NH, Maine and Mass.

T - The chocolate is bittersweet in the taste. Roasted malt accompanies a slight caramel flavor. Finish is bitter alcohol if that makes any sense.  M - Smooth, medium body with nice carbonation. The aftertaste hangs around for a while.  D - The alcohol in the taste doesn't really do anything to take away from the enjoyment of this beer. Goes down easy.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smells nicely of burnt coffee, chocolate and some cascadeish hop tones.  The taste is superior to the smell in this one, really wonderful taste of fudge, caramell, coffee and of course chocolate. The cascade hops (or similar American hops) makes this one stand out. Great mouthfeel.  A great imperial stout, but there are lots of better imperial stous out there!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Pours BLACK with a thin tan head, not much carb remaining.  Smells like an old strong ale with notes of dried fruit, most of the roasty aroma is gone  Tastes like a nice roasty mixture of cold strong coffee, dry bittersweet cocoa and dried fruit  Mouthfeel is creamy and full with low carbonation.

Smells are of chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, brown sugar, and alcohol. Taste is pretty pungent, chocolate in the front with the malt and a little ABV push in the back. Slick on the palate, moderate carbonation making the experience lively. Great sipper and a rep of the style. Will come back soon.

Smells of chocolate, malt and booze. Taste is decadent chocolate with a roast coffee back taste and a nice, boozy aftertaste. Nice and thick with good amount of carbonation that pleased the palate. Definitely a rich drink that I don't think I could frequently consume. Very enjoyable though.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Big chocolate aroma, full of roasted malts. Some alcohol heat in the nose.  Starts out sweet, bittersweet chocolate. A touch of hops, and then a very roasty coffee finish. Heat in the middle. I like it...I think.  Very thick, rich feel. Completely coats the inside of the mouth. The texture is the highlight of the beer.  Very hard to drink more than one of these.

Dark chocolatey roasted malt definitely. Smells promising.  T - Definitely a roasted chocolately kick in the mouth. Not a bad aftertaste.  M - Slightly thick mouthfeel....coats the mouth and throat slightly, not bad though.  D - This is a good beer. Personally I probably couldn't drink more than one, but that's just me.

Chocolate is noticeable first, then roasted malt, burnt marshmallow, and a bit of coffee. Chocolate takes precedent, but aroma is well-balanced and very inviting. Taste follows the aroma with chocolate coming through first, followed by an ester sweetness, soft notes of roasted malt, a bit of burnt marshmallow, coffee, with more chocolate in the finish. This beer is thick, full-bodied, and smooth. Velvety.

45,680,ffejherb,4.33,"12oz. bottle into shaker pint on 4/14/09.  A - Poured an oily black body with a finger's width of creamy tan head that settled into a quarter inch of retention and yielded thick, decorative lacing around the glass.  S - Milk and semi-sweet chocolate, licorice and earthy bitter notes. Some vanilla creeps in, giving the nose an almost bourbon-esque character. However, the alcohol presence is pretty subtle in the aroma overall.  T - Aside from the obvious chocolate presence, I also sense hints of licorice, dark fruit and vanilla. The sweetness then segues into a slight sour character paired with an earthy bitter hop profile, which lasts into the finish. Some alcohol notes creep into the mix, adding a bit of warmth in the midst of all the sweet and bitter chocolate notes.  M - Medium to full-bodied with soft carbonation and a slick, oily texture resulting in a pretty chewy mouthfeel. Finishes with a slight astringency and tinge of alcohol warmth on the palate.  D - I enjoyd this more than when I originally had this perhaps two years ago. Maybe it's because I've been on a big stout kick lately. Either way, this is a pretty bangin' RIS that wears its drinkability on its sleeve. At 10.6%, this remains extremely drinkable throughout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Plenty of alcohol comes through as it warms...smells potent and delicious.  The taste is delicious and rather potent that starts off sweet. Loads of chocolate, prune, fig, molasses, black licorice, oats and wheat, with a big backing of the still present alcohol. Very tasty indeed.  The body is a little thinner than expected, the carbonation is spot on. A good smooth mouthfeel with a nice warming from the high ABV.

A big espresso flourish with every sip. The 10% alcohol is present but doesn't overwhelm.  Medium-to-full bodied, smooth and creamy, and lightly carbonated.

45,680,photomike,3.75,"Received in a great trade with MtGoat. My first!  Pours a VERY deep black into my chalice, with a one cm head even on an aggressive pour. Was still quite cold when I poured it though. Tan swirls form on the top in a pretty manner...you can blow these around, and it's actually kinda fun. Some lacing, but not a ton. Little tiny patches.  Smell (even after letting it warm) is big time licorice. More licoricey than any beer I've smelled to date. A good deal of a black coffee/espresso here too.  Taste is more coffee and very dark chocolate than licorice, but there is a good deal of that here as well. The alcohol is very prominent, as is significant bitterness. Complex and tasty, but rather harsh on the palate...seemingly unbalanced. Needs some age on it.  Mouthfeel is rather clean, but the alcohol burns a bit. There is a bit of a puckering caused by the bitterness, which I think is causing some of the ""sour"" comments by some BA's. I don't think there's really any sourness going on here, but the mouthfeel is somewhat like that from a sour beer.  This is not very drinkable for the style, it is really busting up my palate, and not in the best way. The 10% shows, and this beer is a sipper for sure. Will not reach for a second.  In fact, I'm gonna throw my second in the cellar.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smell- Roasty malts and warm alcohol.  Taste- Chunky dark chocolate, roasty espresso coffee, sweet molasses, bitter hops and a long lasting bitter finish. Great with a cigar.  Mouthfeel- A mouthcoating and chunky brew you could take a bite of.  Drinkability- Delicious and oh so full bodied, yet the 10% ABV will diminish how many you'll be able to enjoy, though enjoy you will.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,Genghis22,4.15,"A - Pours very thick with about a quarter to half inch coffee brown head. Beer is absolutely jet black.  S - Smells like a great stout, with little hints of cocoa, but not overwhelmingly chocolately.  T - First sip is full of big typical stout flavor, with a sweet chocolate finish, but the aftertaste reveals a lot of coffee and a dry alcohol effect on the tongue.  M - This is a beer you can take a bite out of. Nice and thick, very chewy with low to medium carbonation.  D - This beer is highly drinkable, and at 10% quite potent as well.

Smells of molasses, caramel, alcohol, and chocolate malts. Tastes of alcohol, both milk and dark chocolate, mocha, coffee beans, caramel, molasses, rich roasted grains, plums, and more cocoa. Rich and full bodied with medium carbonation. Even after a year plus in the bottle, the alcohol is still quite apparent from start to finish.

45,680,BringusKilkenney,4.17,This beer is a great imperial but at 10.6 it is hard to hide the alcohol. The appearance is midnight black with a dark brown small head. The head becomes very small and lingers for a while. The smell is of bakers chocolate and malts very aromatic but the alcohol can definitely be picked out of the aroma. The alcohol is very prevalent in the taste too as to be expected in imperials but maybe a little more than some are used to. The flavor that pops out the most is dark to bakers chocolate obviously but the malts definitely add to the smoothness of the taste. The mouthfeel is smooth and light this is one of the best qualities of the beer in my opinion. hard to drink more than two or three of these at a time but i will definitely be going back to this beer again next winter could be great aged too.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

I get a rush of caramel, espresso, dark chocolate, and that smelt roasted malt doesnt leave the palate immediately, in fact, it lingers like how a well written song dancing in the recesses of your mind. Im going to let 2 of these age for a while and see if they get better over time. This is winter 08-09 in 12 oz bottles picked up in Brooklyn.

45,680,Wetpaperbag,4,"Alright I'm tasting this as a vertical with my brother. 05-06, 07-08, 08-09. Review was based on the overall of the three.  A- For all three they are all dark jet black. The head goes from a thin film on the newest, to spotty on the middle, and none on the oldest.  S- 08-09 has a roasty caramel smell, very buttery with a touch of bourbon. Reminds me of GIBCS smell wise. 07-08 the smell of alcohol is very present with this one. The roastyness is there, but definitely some mellowing. 05-06 this one has the most mellow of smells. There is some vanilla and molasses in this one. Slight roastyness, but it isn't there as much.  T- 08-09 Very rough around the edges. I would have hoped for some more chocolate taste in this one, but it is a very bitter dark chocolate. Some coffee taste and lots of robust roasted/burnt malts. 07-08 More chocolate taste, less burnt flavor in the malts, and a touch of chocolate. Not much else. 05-06 This one is very sweet. Lots of molasses taste, a touch of vanilla, with very little burnt malt flavor, more lightly roasted. I'm getting a slight fig taste too.  M- For all of them they feel good, the older it gets the smoother it becomes.  D- All of them are fairly drinkable, but the older it gets the easier it becomes. The heat is still there in the older one, but I don't mind it.  Over all the one everyone liked the best was the 05-06, then 08-09 and the last was 07-08.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bsend,4.28,"Poured this beer from a 12 oz. bottle into a standard pint.  This beer looked gorgeous from the pour. It poured a jet black color with light carbonation. It provided a nice dark mocha chocolate head about a 1/2 finger. It slowly dissapated demonstrating gasoline swirls. Holding it up to light it was impossible to see through the beer. It was completely opaque.  The smell was definitely admirable. We get heavy roasted malts, followed by sweet sugar, rich cocoa, and definite alcohol.  The taste was impressive. This beer has bitterness to it that clears off to a nice roasted malt flavor. Cocoa powder tastes like pleasant baker's chocolate. The sweet beginnings come to clear alcohol finishes with the heavy 10.0% abv.  The mouthfeel is clearly viscous. A heavy almost sludgey texture left the flavor on the mouth for a while.  The drinkability is decent however I wouldn't be able to drink more than a few of these. The heavy alcohol flavor provides an amazing brew however a couple are good for me.  Final Thoughts - This brew is incredible. Brooklyn Brewing company produced an excellent Russian Imperial Stout here. Incredible is the only way to explain it. Try one!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,drtth,4.33,"Lightly chilled and poured into Duvel. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. Winter 08-09 Bottling  Appearance: Pours black with dark tan 1"" thick dark tan head composed of fine bubbles that recede slowly leaving lacing on the glass and a ring of foam with a thin layer of foam on the surface. Sipping leaves nice lacing pattern on the side of the glass.  Smell: Strong aroma of dark chocolate from the roasted malts, a hint of dark caramel, no hops noticeable. The alcohol shows itself only in a faint prickling sensation in the nose.  Taste: As expected from the aroma, the first impression is of semi-sweet dark chocolate with undertones of caramel and/or burnt roasted malts. Sweetness comes in and then fades again into a faint hop bitterness in the finish. Some sips leave both sweet and dark roasted flavors bouncing around the palate at the same time. This is a complex beer!  Mouthfeel: Smooth, medium bodied with nice creamy carbonation. Finish is medium long with faint dry bitterness.  Drinkability: As with most imperial stouts I find this quite sipable but not something I want to consume more than one of in one evening. Each sip leaves me wanting a bit more both to enjoy and to try and pin down the different flavors, etc. It will be interesting to see what a year or more of bottle age does with this beer and how it comes out with a 3 or 4 year vertical tasting.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,johnmichael712,4.28,"Appearance: Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into a Chimay goblet. Bottle has ""Limited Bottling - Winter 08 - 09"" written on the top label. This beer pours an inky black color with a nice, dark tan, almost cinnamon colored head that required a very vigorous pour to achieve. In my experience this is necessary of most Russian Imperial Stouts I've tried and this one doesn't seem any more or less carbonated than most examples of the style. The head is very sticky for the high ABV (unlike the description on the site this year's BBCS is 10% ABV) and leaves behind a good amount of lace for the ABV. Overall this is a gorgeous beer and is one of the better looking Russian Imperial Stouts I've seen.  Smell: As soon as I popped off the cap and began to pour the beer I was hit with intense aromas of roasted malts and of chocolate. Swirling the glass and bringing my nose closer allows me to pick up the incredibly sweet nose this beer has. As mentioned before the nose smells strongly of dark chocolate and roasted malts and is complemented by aromas of coffee and, very faintly, alcohol.  Taste: The chocolate taste of this beer is incredible and huge, and Brooklyn has done a great job utilizing the chocolate malt. This beer starts off sweet and chocolaty, moves to very rich, spicy, and intense, and finishes with the wonderful tastes of roasted malts. It also finishes very mild compared to other Russian Imperial Stouts I've had and doesn't have too much in the way of hop bitterness. This beer also finishes with a significant amount of alcohol taste and warming effect, but in my opinion this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it might not be everyone's cup of tea. BJCP guidelines for Russian Imperial Stouts mention them having a ""noticeable alcohol presence"" and Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is definitely a good example of that.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is big and full-bodied and feels very smooth, a good example of the style, but not the best. The carbonation is fairly heavy, but still a very big, chewy body. Overall the mouthfeel is pretty darn good  Drinkability: Because of how strong the alcohol in this beer is I wouldn't recommend drinking too many at a time. The taste, however, would make it possible if I were in the mood.  Notes: After sampling this beer a few times for this review I also paired it with a brownie with nuts, something I recommend doing. Michael Jackson recommends eating it with the Viennese desert Sachertorte, something I'll have to try some day. Overall this beer is good, but it isn't great. I'm anxious to lay down the extra six-pack I bought and try it in a year and so in hopes that the strong alcohol flavors will diminish and the taste will smooth out. Look for another review in a year or so.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Reagan1984,4.18,"08-09 vintage  I finally have a chance to review this one. I've enjoyed several bottles, but never had the chance to sit and contemplate a review.  This is a very nice beer, starting with the appearance. I love how the head erupts from within on some of these Imp Stouts. This one is no exception. A wonderful tan head rise from within. Lacing sticks all over the place and is surprisingly thick. The beer is basically crude oil... lots of brown tones. Maybe better described as the dirty oil you take out of an engine when changing the oil. I don't mean that in a bad way.  Aroma is a touch musty, but also charred grains, and cocoa.  I really enjoy the depth of flavor here. The malts are deep and layered. There is a burst of dark roasted goodness, certainly some chocolate tones. The more you drink it, the more the chocolate flavor comes through. There are some creamy tones as well.  The mouth feel of this beer is unreal. Thick, creamy and just a touch of texture... Not grainy, but something is there.  Lovely drinkability. Lovely beer!!!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,biegaman,4.32,"07-08 Vintage - sampled 14/03/09  Raven black with negligible (where any) highlighting; there are no concessions when it comes to opaqueness, which really, is only appropriate given the persuasive suggestions in its name. Equally personifying to its title, a surprisingly ample level of cocoa butter is lathered atop. It appears creamy and fully capable of enduring the entire tasting.  I know it isn't, but this smells bourbon-barrel aged to me. Then again, for a product that must contain literally hundreds of aromas I don't think I could be considered wrong for imagining any of the flavours that are found swirling around my consciousness. On that note, I'll also add espresso, Zambuca, nuts, dark berries, and again, a whole bunch of aromatic wood essences normally traced back to the inside cavities of a well-worn barrel.  Attention flavour technicians: study this beer. It offers such a myriad of flavours that it can be difficult to identify exactly what the taste is foremost, especially when not every flavour comes to fore with every sip. I would place the most prominent feature - chocolate - as being a cross between a dark, bitter, heavy concentrate of cocoa and a sweetened milk chocolate with the balance, perhaps, just in slight favour of the former.  Due to the prominence of very biscuity, almost cookie-dough like malts the beer embodies an English confection, something to be had alongside afternoon tea. With its rich, unyielding bitter persona, however, I'm reminded more of an Italian digestif espresso and tiramisu dessert. It's also as rich as a French or Belgian truffle. The more North American staple of a bittersweet milk chocolate is also tasted. Altogether, it's hard to determine the inspiration for this Black Chocolate Stout, but as far as the 'chocolate' is concerned, it's covered its bases.  Instantly, I can see the appeal of cellaring. Not only can I sense the beer has all the might and character capable of enduring years of aging, I feel it might stand to use a couple more. This batch, brewed last winter, still has enough warming to carry one through a cold winter's night. Fortunately, it's strength is more than equaled by complexity and this remains decadently rich with long-lasting notes of bourbon, truffles, and vanilla.  Chocolate has been drank since its discovery, some 2000 years ago (it was not until 1849 that the first solid chocolate went on sale). To the ancient Mayans, chocolate was used as an aphrodisiac, it was given to warriors prior to battle, it was a unit of currency and was an important part of religious rituals. It is a product that has long been associated with powerful psychoactive, erotic, and commercial properties. So on that note, I'll leave you with the words of international confectionery historian Tim Richardson...  ""... and when we have gobbled the chocolate we become calm and sated, almost as if we are a different person, although the craving can return again quite quickly. Perhaps this repeated sensual cycle, from extreme enjoyable stimulation to employable satiation to relaxed serenity, is one reason why sex and chocolate are so readily linked. As with sex, the desire for chocolate ca be sudden and overwhelming.""  ... and so too can the desire for Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,kels,3.93,"Finished off my evening at the Comet with one of these on tap, poured into a tulip.  Appearance: Pours black as night with a short, tan head that fades immediately to a skim. Dark, viscous liquid provides no visibility.  Smell: Very present alcohol in the smell, accompanied by sweet cream, chocolate and vanilla.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Very great balance of tastes come through, from creamy, bitter dark chocolate to the light, sweet, roasty malts. The bright hop finish is a little sharp, but it adds uniqueness to the beer compared to others of the same style. The feel is creamy at first, followed by a slight wet effervescence. The big alcohol definitely creeps out in the taste as it warms.  Drinkability: Phew - take it slow.

S- smells chocolatey and roasted, with lots of toasted grain aromas as well, like putting chocolate syrup on some raisin brain. a touch of smoke and dark tart berries, raisin, prune, and fruity alcohol. charcoal, espresso, and some earthy and piney hops.  T- very intense flavor but not insanely bitter, hops are about right on par with the burnt bitterness and together they seem to perfectly balance the big cocoa sweetness. cocoa powder, dark chocolate that transitions to semi-sweet chocolate, hershey's syrup, pipe tobacco, strawberry, sandalwood, big colombian coffee flavors. mid way a tart, liquor soaked fruitiness sets in and from there it's roasted black grains and spicy almost peppery hops.  MF- just under medium carbonation, the body isn't quite as full as i suspected it would be. from something with this much flavor i expected like melted chocolate in my mouth. still great, perhaps the carbonation is a bit too aggressive to present this type of sensation. either way, palate is coated with grain powder and burnt stuff.

45,680,bamadog,4,"This was the final beer of the night, so it was nice to finish up with something sweet. This beer is wonderful, pretty complex and of course, like many stouts, much better as it warms. Poured from the tap into a tulip glass.  Appearance: Dark, viscous. Looks chewy and even a little sticky - interesting to say the least as there was a slight lacing that was holding on tight to the sides of the glass. Came with a very short dark tan head that faded very quickly into a thin skin.  Smell: Dark malts, a little caramel-esque and a bit of burnt sugar. A slight roastiness as well somewhere in there, but not a very overwhelming sense of it. Alcohol is definitely present and as it came to me a little colder than what I would have preferred, I just know it's going to come out a lot more as it warms in my hands... Yep, it's warmer now and the alcohol is all over this...  Taste: More of a hoppier presence than what I would have expected - very nice, not quite accustomed to the hoppiness in a stout of this caliber, but it's definitely there and it adds a dimension that is kind of unique. Chocolate is there, but subdued, as is the alcohol (at first anyway, see notes above regarding the alcohol presence in the smell as it's the same here in the taste department as well). Carmelly goodness starts to crepp in as it warms, and then a ""chocolate-covered cherry"" type of flavor becomes more and more present as well... Very interesting... I'm noticing this more and more in certain stouts, most recently Yeti Oak-Aged...  Mouthfeel: A dry and sticky mouthfeel - the higher alcohol has to be what's drying the palate, but the additional hoppiness is making it a little more sticky as well, very interesting as well. Leaves a very thin coating and lingers a bit.  Drinkability: With the higher ABV, nothing beyond one serving for me. An amazing beer though and I will definitely have it again. A great way to end the night.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,LordHammer,4,"A: Pours a deep black, totally opaque, with about an inch of brown head.  S: Roasted malts, a tiny bit of fruit, a bit of hops, and some alcohol. If it tastes as good as it smells, then this is a winner.  T: Lots of roasted malts out front, a bit creamy, and some significant hop bitterness at the end, all of which is lovely. The burn in the middle is a bit rough, however. Definitely smooths as it warms into a lovely beer.  M: For something this strong, fairly heavy and chewy.

45,680,therica,4.02,"My apologies but this didn't impress us as much as our expectations. There's no comparison between this and the outstanding Southern Tier Choklat (also an Imperial Stout) if you want a true chocolate beer that's more akin to refined milk chocolate as opposed to pure bitter Swiss dark-chocolate taste.  One cool thing is that once this has gone flat, store the unused leftovers in the bottle (if there's any left) for some great cooking for stews or sauces. It's excellent.  A= dark dark black, with a dirty-brown head and modest lacing.  S= liqueor and roasted malts, very robust.  T= very nice for an Imperial Stout but a bit heavy on the alcohol aspsect, to be expected at the 10%ABV. The chocolate malt flavor is more like a 90% pure Swiss dark bitter chocolate, definitely not Hershey's/Ghirardelli style at all. Basically a very dark burnt-stout with a chocolate-bitter taste. Some hops florals apparent.  M= brandy-esque alcohol residue, very dark burnt chocolate and black malts and some dark chocolate residue.

The smell is a sour sweet bitter smell. I cannot pin point my exact description of the smell, but it is not the best smelling beer in my opinion.  T - The taste is of roast, chocolate, malt, and alcohol. The dark malted barely delivers the biggest blow in the flavor. Backing up that, is the dark chocolate, with an smooth alcoholic finish.  M - The mouth feel is very carbonated, with a creamy texture. Hard to explain, but it is rather pleasant.  D - For the high ABV, this beer is highly drinkable.

One of the most opaque beers you're gonna find out there. A real imperial stout that is not to be messed with. Not a great session beer due to the strong flavor and the high alcohol content, but the upshot is that one beer will get you drunk, so it all turns out okay in the end. The intense alcohol flavor cancels out some of the richness a bit - I prefer some of the richer, more mellow stouts for the most part.

Thick, black, opaque, almost syrupy in appearance. Serious red-wine like fingering down the sides of the glass. Alcohol and chocolate dominate the nose with hints of toasted malt.  Full, rich, roasty flavor. The alcohol has definitely been subdued over time and really takes a back seat to the roasted malt. Not much hop flavor, but the bitterness has remained so that the beer does not taste very sweet at all. Mouthfeel is thick but not syrupy.  This is a very drinkable RIS.

45,680,Phillyduke,3.52,"Winter '08-'08 bottling served into a snifter.  A: Beer is an opaque motor oil black (without the motor oil viscosity) and sports a thin head of mocha colored foam that quickly recedes to a thin rocky cap. Some fine lacing gathers around the meniscus and clings to the glass in round clusters, but that too fades eventually.  S: HUGE nose of rich chocolate and dark roasted malts. A noticeable whiff of alcohol stings the nostrils.  T/M: The bitterness is what strikes me first. Bitter dark chocolate followed by the syrupy sweetness of dark roasted malts cutting through the bitterness. There is a slight raisin-y metallic taste that's a bit off-putting, and the mouthfeel is a little on the thin side. Towards the end the syrupy sweetness becomes a tad cloying, which saps some of the enjoyment for me.  D/O: This is a beer that needs some time, IMO. It's a little too hot and one-dimensional right now, with the dominance of the sweet chocolate flavor really overpowering whatever else might be trying to reveal itself. I'd like to see a bit more balance from a roasty flavor to offset the sweetness.

It pours out very black with a mocha colored head that rises rapidly, but controlled, at the end of the pour. The aroma very heavy on the burnt sugars, molasses, and sweet cocoa nibs. The taste comes through a bit hot on the alcohol and the maltiness shines through. There are definitely major layers of roasted malts, but it becomes a bit messy at times. The flavor is clearly evident but the balance is lacking. I would have liked a little stronger roasted profile to tone down the sweetness.

The alcohol was noticeable as the beer warmed up; at times it gave off more of a Scotch aroma than a straight up astringent alcohol aroma.  The taste was very good. Followed the nose really good, well balanced, with some hints of the alcohol, again after the beer warmed. Certainly not as much chocolate as one would expect.

Appearance: The pour is black, just one step away from being opaque, with a surprisingly small (half a finger) light brown head that settles quickly and leaves basically no lacings.  Smell: Mostly dark chocolate. Although it has less sweet aromas than many other imperial stouts, there are still some notes of blackcurrants and faint vanilla here. Gentle hops and a good deal of roasted barley finish things off.  Taste: Big flavors of dark chocolate hit the palate and stays on right to the very end of the finish. The chocolate flavors are definitely on the bitter end, leaning towards cocoa, but every now and then notes of sweeter chocolate appear as well. The taste of roasted barley is also quite immense and it blends beautifully with the chocolate. Some fruity flavors (plums?) and maybe some vanilla are to be found as well, somewhere among the chocolate and roasted barley. But still, the sweetness in this one is really restrained. From a few sips, I get a slight acidic flavor, but this might be the bitterness from the chocolate and the roasted grain that's playing a trick on me. The alcohol, although well hidden, provides a pleasant twang before the finish, which is quite bitter and contains some restrained, yet distinct, hops and long roasted flavors. Not the most complex imperial stout, but still a delightful beer with it's astonishing chocolaty character.  Mouthfeel: Quite a lot of carbonation considering the style, but thanks to a full body it manages to come out rather smooth.  Drinkability: I've had this beer quite a few times, and I'm always amazed by the fact that it's made solely from malt, hops, water and yeast, and no chocolate additives. How one can make ingredients such as these to taste this good is quite astonishing.

45,680,xenolithic,4.48,"25th review (woo)  Poured almost a jet black with a roasted caramel 1/2 finger head into my pilsner glass. Little to no light penetration, even in this well lit room. The head retention on this is very good even though it has such a small head. As you drink it leaves significant residue on the side of the glass, and it establishes legs.  The smell upon first sniff is of dark roasted chocolate. The smell comes across as bitter baking chocolate. There is some definite alcohol characteristic towards the back of the nose. It may have died down since this has been in the fridge for about 3 months since original purchase, but who knows. This one smells less alcoholic than the fresh one I had months ago.  The taste has bitter roasted malts at the forefront. A little roasted coffee and bitter bakers chocolate comes through on the end. The chocolate and alcohol come through more so as the beer warms.  The aftertaste lingers for quite some time, and the most predominant flavor is the bitter bakers chocolate.  The drinkability on this is good, but it is most certainly a sipping beer to be had at ""special occasions"", whatever those might be. I however will agree with the others and say that after one of these, I am done for the evening.

This has a creamy sweet profile, and you can tell it is a massive stout but hides the 10% pretty well. For everything good here, this lacks a bit of complexity I was expecting for such a massive tour de force in beer making. The finish could be longer for my tastes...",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,allrizz,4.1,"Being originally from Brooklyn and a Stout lover I just had to try this beer. ABV 8.5% This glass was from the tap and very dark. A pleasant aroma with a hint of chocolate. I loved the way it tasted, bold with a hint of coffe and chocolate, two of my favorite flavors. A Russian Imperial Stout that has made it to my list of regular favorites.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,twiggamortis420,4.6,"Pours black as night with no light penetration. Creamy, fine light brown head. Supreme lacing and decent retention.  Smells like hoppy, malty cocoa pebbles cereal. Fruitiness is there as well - strawberries, currants and raisins. Smells good fo sho.  Not as thick and rich as I was expecting, not necessarily a bad thing. Very roasty, pushes the roasty cocoa bean limit but never crosses the line (is there one?!) Coffee notes are noticeable as is the hop bitterness. Hides the ABV quite well and I like the fact it is not as sweet as TenFidy and Yeti. Great drinking RIS straight off the line, no aging necessary. A very well crafted beer, just delicious.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Brianmerrilyn,3.9,"I have had the pleasure of sipping this creation down since the mid 90's and have no idea how much Garrett has tweaked the recipe over the years but I'm still a fond fan.  A: Poured black with tints of ruby around the corners but overall almost ""jet"" black creating a dark tan massive two finger plus sticky head with nickle size shavings of lace giving you a wee peak on the abv en route.  S: Nose is sweet dark roasted malts, chocolate of course, followed by coffee and if there were hops, I didn't whiff 'em.  T: Initial bittersweet dark chocolate candy bars to my sheer delight, however the ABV cannot be hidden and unless you enjoy heavies, this will be hard to handle. Burnt malts and toasted bread comes afterward. Improves with warming no doubt and I recommend taking your time on the initial sip to enjoy the inner complexities like the dark fruit which helped me find the hops buried underneath it all.  M: Very thick, dry finish, wonderfully rich and smooth, but a tad astringency .  D: Not the best in the style, however not too shabby. Imperial is clearly defined for this brew and perhaps some masking of the ABV may be in order to smoothen the rough edges.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,apintofknowledge,4.58,"A must pick-up seasonal every year, I just realized that I've never taken the time to review it here. It pours a deep warm brown, almost black, the color of over-roasted coffee beans, with a frothy, foamy head, the texture and consistency of the foamed milk on a cappuccino, but with a cocoa hue. The aroma itself is warming on a cold winter's night... roasty and sweet with notes of bourbon.  One of my favorite qualities of this beer is the mouthfeel. It has enough thickness to be full and substantial without being syrup-like, and just enough tiny bubbles of carbonation to balance the thickness.  The taste may take a little warming to... both figuratively and literally. This is a beer that should not be served straight from the fridge; coldness dulls the complexity and highlights any harsh flavors. It is also a beer that grows on your palate. What can be initially strong and stringent becomes enjoyable and warming after a few sips.  The taste itself starts with a molasses-like sweetness, continuing into a potent dark chocolate middle (think 85% to 90% dark chocolate that would shock those who only eat the milk variety). This grows into a mix of bitter root (like the kava I enjoyed in Fiji) and strong over-roasted black coffee, and finishing with a subtle warming alcohol burn.  The chocolate in the name is misleading in a way for those used to beers actually made with chocolate, like Young's Double Chocolate Stout or Samuel Adam's Chocolate Bock. Yet, it shows amazing chocolate character for a beer that has no actual chocolate content.  With this in mind, I find this beer isn't one to pair with chocolate, with the flavors both melding but overpowering on one side or the other. It works much better as a counterpoint, with cheesecake being an excellent companion.  Overall, an excellent, memorable, and unique brew, and one to come back to every winter.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,dakid618,4.33,12oz bottle received in trade compliments of kiefdog(thanks Kevin!) Poured into pint glass. Pours jet black with a half finger of tan head. Smell is very light but chocolatey and roasty. Taste is immediatly in your face chocolate backed up by toasty malts and cocoa with a slight hint of coffee. Mouthfeel is fairly thick and coats the tongue. An extremely drinkable stout. Alcohol is very well hidden. I look forward to having one of these again.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,linnet,4.35,"Pitch black colour, creamy brown head, nice lacing. Aroma is heavily roasted with notes of coffee, dark chocolate, sweet licorice and honey, the ABV is also present in the nose. Flavours are the same as in the aroma with bitterness and a powerful aftertaste with some astringency. Mouthfeel is oily and very smooth. This Imperial stout is very good and maybe the best value for money you can find out there.

45,680,SirSketch,3.41,"This beer ranges in color from dark brown to black with dark reddish hues at the bottom and sides. Smell consists mainly of milk chocolate, graham cracker, and very light burnt coffee beans. The alcohol is very apparent, but it comes off more like paint thinner.  Much darker chocolate and coffee taste then the smell suggested. Bitterness seems to come from both hops and chocolate, but no hop character otherwise. Some toasted bread notes as well. Medium to full bodied in mouth feel with little carbonation and a dry aftertaste.

45,680,spointon,4.03,"I poured this one from a 12oz brown bottle into a tulip pint glass.  A= Poured jet black with zero light penetration and a 1"" chocolate tan head. The head retention was incredible and left gig sheets of lace down my glass.  S= I found dark roasty malts, burnt coffee, dark ripe plums and figs, and a nice chocolate liquor alcohol note.  T= All of the aromas carried into the flavor, with the roasty chocolate malts and alcohol most dominant. I also found the rich sweetness of the fruit to be there balanced against an earthy hop bit I was not expecting. Finish did dry a bit, and was full of warming alcohol. Flavors were a bit rough around the edges, but still pleasant and showing great promise for aging.  MF= Heavy bodied with a creamy feel and just enough carbonation to stop it from being a tongue-coater.  D= This is a great beer that can certainly use some aging. For maximum effect, this beer needs to be served just slightly cooler than room temp. I think that if the roughness of the hops and the bitter roastiness mellowed a bit in the cellar, this would be a world class beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Multilayered: dark fruit, toasted black forest cake, coffee and wine fruit alcohol are held together by the chocolate and dark malt. I can taste every bit of the 10.6% abv.

A 3 inch tan head forms that quickly recedes to a lattice-like lacing.  The aroma was subtle and included the dark chocolate/malt sweetness, we all know and love. It also included a mild hint of dark cherries. Minimal coffee is present.  The taste was quite complex and included the dark chocolate and coffee, but also a nice caramel and peppery mix that is very good. The bitter components and hops are present but not overwhelming.  The mouthfeel displayed a medium body with a high carbonation. The finish is silky and ends dry on the tongue.  Overall, I think this is a very good imperial stout and will definitely keep my eyes open for this and other Brooklyn beers.

Taste- bitterness fades into a more distinct 'dark chocolate' flavor, with a noticeable alcohol bite to it. Swallow is strongly chocolaty, and fades into a dry, nearly hoppy, alcohol finish.  Mouthfeel- considering everything, it is fairly light, though by no stretch thin. Creamy, smooth, and satisfying are the primary textures.

As it warmed, dark fruits recede, syrup disappears, roasted malt and chocolate comes to fore. Slightly bitter finish. Greatly improved as it climbed into room temperature. Also worth noting that this beer changed significantly over the last two or three months -- another bottle from the same sixer three months ago was significantly hotter and more sough-syrup like.  Mouthfeel is thick, fairly syrupy, and lightly carbonated.  Nice beer to have on a fairly regular basis.

Smells of dark roasted malts and, obviously, chocolate, but also has definite sweetness coming from the back.  After one taste it is clear that this is the most well-balanced Chocolate beer I've had. Great dark, roasted chocolate flavor with some brief coffee notes, which does well to drown out the alcohol that is hiding in the background.  This one feels heavy and smooth in the mouth, without much carbonation.  Very drinkable, but a little heavy to be a session beer.

The head is creamy and dissipates to a dark tan ring around the snifter.  Nose: A wonderful dark chocolate, with heavy roasted malt, and coffee. There is a nice subtle fruity esters in the beer. There is a nice dark fruit note in the beer and some toffee, burnt sugar, phenols, and molasses sweetness notes.  Taste: A rich dark heavy roasted malt and chocolate. There is coffee, fruity esters, raisin, and burnt sugar. There are hints of a toffee, molasses, phenols, a nice toasted bread, alcohol, and floral.  Overall: OMG, this is such a complex beer with so much going on but yet so sophisticated. The chocolate is evident but mingles so well with the rest of the beer. This beer is right up there with Rouge Chocolate Stout. The mouth feel is chewy and rich, with a slight astringent hoppiness and an alcohol warming.

The head very slowly dissipates and is still hanging around at the end. Nice lacing.  Not as aromatic as I'd hoped for, but a pleasant combination of coffeeish and chocolatey black malts, with some dark fruit and alcohol.  Taste and mouthfeel are really nice. All those malts make for a great combination of bitter and sweet chocolates, with some dark fruit and raisin flavors. Just a bit of hop bitterness. Moderate carbonation is just right to usher in a velvety finish of bittersweet chocolate and a nice lingering alchol burn.  Even at this high ABV, drinkability is not a problem at all. I'd drink this stuff for hours. Can't wait to see how it ages.  Overall impression: Thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end.

The initial sweetness lingers for awhile then is washed away with a blast of coffee bitterness. ""Calm, Cool, Collected"" Nice crisp carbonation. Quite a remarkable beer.

45,680,TheycallmeTim,3.73,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into an oversized stemless wine glass.  Brooklyn BCS pours up a thick, almost wet looking, black crude oil. Pretty much opaque, with just a hint of garnet when held to light. Head is the darkest I've ever seen on a beer, and roughly the color of some porters or brown ales I've had. Seriously dark espresso foam on this, maybe half a finger that holds nicely. This sucker also pours /out/ distinctively, as this stuff is viscous--it's not accident it conjures up analogies to oil. Yowza.  S--Very vinous, fortified winey, like port or its close cousin madeira. There are also some toffee notes and a bit of bitter chocolate.  T--Much like the nose: lots of warming alcohol that rounds out with wine notes and, to me, a little dark chocolate but much more black coffee, or espresso. Big, big beer, that does not bother hiding the liquor punch. Finish is bitter and a little like looking on the Montana horizon--in a word, neverending. Just lasts and lasts, and if it's a little warmer not only does the toffee come out, but also some raisins and, most of all, bitter roasted malt. Finish is the best part, as it's complex. Up til that point this beer is just big and boozy, which I'm guessing would change for the better with some aging. Have you ever had goobers? Imagine goobers that use dark chocolate instead of milk chocoate and dunked in coffee and kahlua. That's how this tastes to me.  M&D--Mouthfeel is excellent, silky velvety mongrammed Barry white sheets. Drinkability? Who cares. It's winter, so let's warm up. Not something you'd wanna drink before Christmas or after St. Patrick's day, but in that window it makes the snow shine a little brighter in the sun.  I like this beer, but I don't love it. It may be my unfamiliarity with the style, or my nagging sense that Brooklyn brews big beers rather than better ones. Often I feel like they're high end offerings gimme a black eye.

It holds onto the side of the glass pretty well. s : Smells like chocolate, alcohol, and raisen in that order. Doesn't have as much aroma as some other imperial stouts I have had, and the alcohol is a bit more noticeable here. Pleasant smell. t : Raisens are the most aparent flavor in the beer followed by coffee and then the alcohol finished the beer with a warming sensation. The chocolate is more apparent when I swish the beer around my mouth and after I swallow. m : Coats the mouth well, and makes my tongue happy as it digs through the maltiness to get to the chocolate undertones. A little thin, in my opinion for an imperial stout. d : I can only drink 1 of these a night and only a couple times a week. That said this is my 6th Black Chocolate Stout of the season so I certainly enjoy the brew.  I bought this beer at the same time as Southern Tier's Imperial Choklat Stout. I think that they are both great showings for the style. I wish this beer had a bit more aroma. Other than that I think that this beer is quite nice to drink on cold nights (like tonight).

Taste- Slight chocolate tones with strong coffee and burnt malts, almost a nut or almond flavor as you are hit with the delicious burnt malts. A fabulous smooth taste.  Mouthfeel- Very smooth yet full bodied feel in your mouth, definitely enjoyable  Drinkability- Shockingly drinkable and delicious considering the high alcohol that is extremely well hidden. So drinkable I would say that its dangerous cuz you'll be passed out before you know it.  One of my favorite seasonal stouts and a fine chocolate stout as well. Brooklyn does not disappoint with this walloping of 10.2 percent alcohol which tastes so good you would like to keep drinking more then you should.

S- Strong chocolate aroma with a underlying alcohol tone.  T- Heavy presence of roasted malts followed by the chocolate then a semi-sweet/bitter dark chocolate aftertaste. Warming effect of the alcohol follows quickly rising from the stomach to the back of the throat and then to the cheeks.  M- This is one big tasting beer. Heavy, creamy, and chewy, low in carbonation a meal in itself.  D- Probably not going to want more than one or two of these at any one sitting as the 10.0% ABV will stop you there. They do go down easy though.  Review is from the ""winter 08-09"" bottling. This beer ages well and is a little raw tasting when first purchased.

Body is bold, but not overly.  Drinkability - One of the best I've ever had. Could possibly use more body and smoothness, but at 10% ABV and for the price, this is an unbeatable RIS.

45,680,BamaBeerBuff,4.43,"2008 vintage.  A: Pours a jet-black color with a large, stiff, creamy milk-chocolate colored head that retains excellently and really lays down some nice lacing on my glass. Retention is slightly under expectations, but that's a most minor complaint.  S: Big time roasted barley, chocolate, and coffee aromas. A hint of molasses-like sweetness, but not a lot else. Added strength and complexity would help things here.  T&M: Yummy. Big time roasted chocolate flavor, some coffee, a hint of black currant, molasses, and vanilla. Bitterness comes in very nicely on the finish and mellows out some of the sweetness. This really is a great beer! I've heard many complaints of the alcohol being too hot, but I really only noticed it slightly on the finish, and it wasn't a detriment to the experience in the least bit. Body is medium, a lot thinner than others in the RIS style, but the carbonation is also measured, which gives it SOME smoothness. I'd prefer a bit more silkiness and a bigger body, but it works in its present form.  D: Definitely THE most drinkable RIS I've had, which is dangerous. The ABV can sneak up on you, and it's really easy to drink so you've got to watch it!

45,680,ThreeWiseMen,4.4,"Got this in a recent trade with fogdog. Thanks Kevin!  Bottled in the Winter of 2007-2008. Poured into a New Belgium wine glass-type-thing (closest thing I have to a snifter).  Appearance: Pours out with the color and consistency of motor oil. Creamy brown head sticks to the top and clings to the sides of the glass as it slowly dies down. Looks gorgeous when swirled!  Smell: Sharp vanilla extract, bourbon, dark chocolate, roasted malt, and burnt sugar. Cool yet pronounced. Bourbon notes come out more as it warms. Very rich and enjoyable.  Taste: Chocolate malt greets the taste buds first, followed by smooth vanilla, caramel and burnt sugar, wood, and finally big, bad, bourbon. Bourbon and burnt sugar hang around in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Syrupy and full-bodied. Light carbonation allows for a bit of creamy-smoothness as well. Coats the mouth very well, and produces a nice amount of warming in the mouth and belly. Finishes dry, but bourbon and sweet notes hang around and are very pleasant.  Drinkability: A sipper for sure. I (Nick) only had about 7-8oz; the remainder went to wiseman/roommate Zach. This beer reminded me of Bourbon County Stout: really thick, syrupy, and high in ABV with big, bold flavors throughout. I wouldn't ever drink anymore than one bottle of either beer, but I'd enjoy the nice, long sesh. All in all, I'd prefer something a bit more like Old Rasputin when it comes to drinkability. Still, very, very good.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Nice course lacing S - Not too much initially..a little cold. As it warms I start to get the sweet malts T - Sweet, some coffee followed by dark chocolate. The dark chocolate lingers as an aftertaste and then I get some dark fruit. M/F - Full bodied and smooth. Beautifully carbonated. D - This was a delicious after dinner drink. I was happy to try it on tap.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,fightingirishcmk,4.37,"A: Pours pitch black with a moderately dark head. The head retention was a bit short, but plenty of lacing was left on the glass. Beautiful. S: Chocolatey sweetness (of course!), almost like a glass of chocolate milk. T: Chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and a bit of sticky sweetness all come together as a luscious treat. A little bitterness helps to even it out. M: A perfect amount of carbonation, medium bodied, and not quite as thick as other RIS examples, which I find to be a good thing. D: For a RIS, this is quite drinkable. I mean I wouldn't have more than two in a night, but I could find myself craving this.

45,680,KeefD,3.88,"Had a vertical tasting of this (review below) and now have come into possession of a sixer of 08-09 bottles. Review scores reflect fresh bottles, as I felt this beer didn't age well.  Pours a very dark brown, almost black color with a nice tan colored head and decent lacing. Aroma is of dark rum-soaked fruits, a little bit of roastiness, very light coffee, but barely any chocolate notes and strange underlying burnt rubber note. Taste is sweet, chocolate comes out more in the flavor than in the nose, but is still subdued, lots of roasted malts, some dark fruits, raisins in particular, a bit of molasses. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, fairly smooth, light carbonation bite on the finish. Perhaps I was wrong in my original thinking. Maybe this beer does age better than I had expected. Alcohol isn't noticeable, but the flavors are just too sweet and fruity. I like my stouts dry and on the chocolate side. For a ""chocolate stout"" there isn't much chocolate in the flavor. Good, but I've had much better imperial stouts as of late.  ---  OLD REVIEW, 3.8 Overall  review from notes, '05-07 vertical  After all were tasted I enjoyed the 06/07 vintage the best. Felt like this beer didn't age particularly well. Chocolate notes became less prominent with age and alcohol became surprisingly more prevalent. The younger/newer bottles had more chocolate/dark fruit/sweet flavors. 06/07 review:  Dark brown, almost black, ruby highlights  Smell: Dark fruit, chocolate, roasty  Taste: Roasted barley, light chocolate, very light coffee,  Mouthfeel: Alcohol is a little more hidden than older ones, creamy texture, fuller bodied. Easy to drink, tasty fresher",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jkendrick,3.51,"Appearance: Dark brown to black with large pillowy head after an aggressive pour. The head recedes more slowly than I would have thought leaving nice lacing.  Aroma: There is not a strong smell coming from this. I don't smell too much chocolate and the alcohol is definitely evident in the nose. Mostly malt with some hints of coffee.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and with a moderate amount of carbonation. I would like it to be just a touch thicker.  Taste: The cocoa is there in the taste right up front. It is a dry bitter chocolate. It is bitter, but I think that is from the chocolate more than a strong hops presence. The alcohol is very evident and warms in the finish. I would have liked the alcohol to be a little more well-hidden.  Overall impression: This is a good chocolate stout, but could stand to have the alcohol a bit more hidden. That said, whereas many chocolate stouts have a desserty character, this is a chocolate stout for grown ups!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,masterhomebrewer,4.07,"Props to Brooklyn Brewery for brewing this bad boy and making it available for a song (less than $2 each!).  A -- Black as death. Milk chocolate head of about 3/4 inch fades to an appealing pond scum.  S -- Aroma of a boozy, chocolate pound cake slathered with Hershey's Syrup.  T -- Big, dark chocolate, coffee, toffee and butter from the get-go. Booze pops out toward the finish, and closes with a roasty finish.  M -- Think and chewy, no doubt, but a slight letdown against the huge mix of intense flavors. Points subtracted for a mouthfeel that struggles live up to its dynamic taste.  D -- A leg up on other Imperial Stouts, as I could actually drink two of these in one sitting.  Overall a kick-ass IS for its huge flavor, drinkability and value.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,taylorhamrick,3.37,"This was the last bottle that I bought from this past years release.  It looks nice really. Perfectly black with a nice brown head that sits on top. The head kind of fades to just a few rings and swirls of bubbles. There's a tiny bit of lacing and bubbles cascade down as you drink. The smell is decent, you get a hint of alcohol with some chocolate and roasted malts. The taste was kind of harsh, even a few months after I first purchased it. I remember thinking it was nice and sweet at first with a nice taste of chocolate, and its still there, but after finding lots of other imperial stouts, I realize that this one doesn't quite make it to the top. There's an intense bitterness and burn from the alcohol and the dark roasted malts. It's kind of smooth, but I get this feeling that's like eating a slimy fruit or something. I can't actually tell whether this beer is thick or thin. It actually drinks rather quickly, and I enjoy it, but it could be better. Try it some time.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Nesued,3.95,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle on a cold wintery day in South Carolina (yes, we have those).  Appearance - Deep brown/black pour. A slight head formed upon the intial pour and resolved to a 1-finger remain. A bit of lacing formed after letting the beer sit for a few minutes to warm. No light passed through this black hole and the mild carbonation can barely be seen.  Smell - Candy sweet malt nose with the appearance of a coffee/chocolate nose. The roasted aroma is present here, along with a brief bit of a hop nose (not much).  Taste - Big coffee/caramel initial offering, a good smooth middle, and a slight hop bite at the end. A good roasty malt entry continues on the second sip. The alcohol is present in the middle of the taste and quickly leaves no trace by the end.  Mouthfeel - Suprisingly big for what I was expecting. There is a bit of a chewy body to this beer that is fed by the carbonation. It does weigh on you and is a good sipper.  Drinkability - No more than one a night on this offering. I good presentation and interpretation of the style. I would think aging this would have some merit. I may give that a try. Sure, I'd have this again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Boozy, molasses, licorice. At first more boozy than anything, but this mellows. Some malty sweetness and bitter chocolate eventually become more pronounced. Has long legs.  Boozy again, at the start, but this fades into complex blend of bitter chocolate, molasses, and roasted malt. Smooth, balanced, rich. Mild lingering bitterness. Far more complex than the nose.  Nicely restrained carbonation, thick creamy coating, full bodied, smooth, with a hint of warming.  This is a creamy, rich delicacy that is hard for me to nurse.

45,680,Jmoore50,4.16,"Got this in a trade and just to tell anyone that is reading this, I am drinking both a 2007 and 2008. I am comparing both of them, and so far they are both incredibly tasty.  The appearance is just stunning. It pours like silk, just this great smooth 'motor oil' type liquid pours so so smooth. Both brews came to a two finger head that was the color of light chocolate. It left a really weird lacing that is sticky and spread all over the sides of the glass.  The smell is great, something that I have started to expect from a good stout. The latest 2008 smells sweeter than the 2007. Really smells like chocolate and liquior, I also get a slight spice in this brew.  The taste is pretty good. Now, the older brew has a ABV of 10.6% and the new has 10% ABV. Again, I am thinking that the new is tastier. It has more life and the malts are more vibrant, they bounce and dance on the tongue more than the aged. Overall good.  The mouthfeel and drinkability are common for a RIS. Really great on the tongue and really great on the overall drinkability. Deff. a dessert beer and one for the end of the night. This is third or fourth in my quest for perfect chocolate stouts. Would buy again, but not if there was a Rogue Chocolate there also.  J",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

It's a very robust and hearty beer. The taste is of a bittersweet dark chocolate. The beer is thick and has an elevated abv which contributes to a very well-rounded stout. The mouthfeel is excellent.

45,680,Thesoundandthefury,4.18,"A- Dark, very dark....black. No light coming through this brew! Pours with a finger and a half of chocolate milk colored head.  S- Roased Malts, bittersweet chocolate, roasted coffee, burnt sugar and a hint of alcohol.  T- Loads of flavor in this great beer. All of the smells come through in the taste. bittersweet chocolate, wood, big roasted malts, burnt sugar, hints of coffee, some hoppy bite, creamy bit of sweetness comes in and out of the flavor spectrum. Finishes with an ever so slight alcohol taste with bittersweet chocolate being the dominate flavor.  M- Smooth and oh so creamy, heavy body, medium carbonation. All in all, this comes together perfectly!  D- Good drinkability, especially due to the creaminess and great mouthfeel. I think 2 in 1 sitting would be enough for me though.

45,680,Mazeraski,4.1,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Middle Ages imperial pint glass.  A - Pours a pitch black color with no tinting around the edges, along with a finger-width creamy dark tan head that dissipates sort of slow leaving a bit of sticky lacing around the glass.  S - Big and slightly bittersweet dark chocolate hits the nose first, accompanied by a hint of floral hoppiness, roasted malt, caramel and molasses with perhaps a hint of cinnamon. As it warms the brew smells sweeter.  T - The molasses, caramel and dark chocolate combine initially for a smooth, chewy and savory first wave that washes over the palate. This is followed by a flashing bite of hops and thick roasted malt that leaves a slightly dry and bitter taste which disappears quickly and is replaced by a creaminess as a result of the initial wave of combined flavors.  MF - Full-bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. Also quite thick, smooth and creamy as a whole.  D - Taste-wise I'd say very drinkable however it suffers in this department from the high ABV and heaviness on the stomach.  Notes - Quite a good brew overall I would say. I like the fact that there's a bit of hops in the taste, although this detracts from it's smoothness a bit (despite the fact that I still think the hops add a bit of character and depth to it). Well-crafted and very delicious.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,discovolante65,4.2,"Poured into the Duvel glass fairly aggressive. Absence of light blackness flows from the bottle. Nice size head with a mocha color. Head dissipates within a minute or so leaving a nice thin ring around the top.  Smell is dark/unsweetened chocolate. Little sweetness like a molasses smell to it as well. Slight alcohol presence as well.  Sweet chocolate taste that turns slightly bitter but blends with the malt and hops taste to balance out, finish is a little warm with alcohol. I taste something else in here that I cannot put my finger on. Prunes?  Thick and heavy, and that ain't a bad thing. Slight carbonation. Just the way a stout should be.  I think it is balanced very well, but only to a point. I enjoyed sipping this, but felt rushed after a short period of time due to the alcohol overpowering the rest of the flavors. That would be my only knock on this one. It is definitely drinkable, I just need to enjoy it a little faster I guess. This is actually the second six of this I have purchased, so it's not like the alcohol is stopping me from buying more.

Not too overpowering but still enough to let you know its there.  T: Same dark chocolate taste with an underlying coffee flavor. Bit alcoholy.  M: Mmm my favorite kind of stout. Nice and thick. Good carbonation and a little bit of hops in there.  D: I would love to drink a lot more of this! This isn't the greatest stout ever but it definitely deserves its good marks.

S - Dark chocolate first and foremost, along with roasted malt bitterness and dark fruit tones. A slight soy sauce aroma is present also. Alcohol definitely shines through as well.  T - A little smoky bite of roasted malt goodness at the front. As the carbonation settles around the tongue, bitter dark chocolate takes over. Black coffee, alcohol heat, and a slight fruitiness finish it off. This is a big, flavorful beer!  M - Thick, rich, and syrupy. Just enough carbonation to keep things lively.  D - Flavor wise, this is a very balanced and drinkable stout. If you're the type of person to down several RIS at a sitting, then this one should fit the bill. I personally enjoy savoring one bottle and that's about all I can handle due to the richness and ABV.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Onenote81,4.3,"Pours a jet black that allows not even the brightest of lights to penetrate. Very small tan head on this one. I poured as I always do, and this one gave me nothin'. Some weak spotty lacing. Smells of cocoa, bread, alcohol, and slight yeast.  Bam! This is one fine tasting brew! I could sip this all night...or afternoon, as is the case today. Powerful chocolate flavor, with some pumpernickel, dark fruits, and just a touch of alcohol bite. Mellowed bitterness and smooth as all get out. This is so creamy it just begs to be drunk, and drunk, and drunk...be careful though, this beer does not feel like 10.6% ABV, at all.

45,680,Natural510,4.48,"Jet-black pour with creamy, dark brown head which descends beautifully into a ring of brown lace on the side of the glass. Smells of sweet chocolate, dark fruit such as plum & raisin, and a hint of coffee. The flavors blend together very well, none being too predominant overall. There is plum, cocoa, molasses, coffee which are brought out by a deeply roasted malt and residual hop character. Creamy and vibrant in the mouth; exactly what you expect from the style. Extremely drinkable, for not only flavor reasons but the masking of the alcohol content. Many in this range carry a ""hot"" quality, but I can barely denote the difference between this Russian Stout and a regular milk stout as far as ABV is concerned.

Slight fruitiness and alcohol in there.  Has a very sweet and roasted malt flavor. Bittersweet chocolate, dark fruits. I can pick up the alcohol only slightly, which is surprising. Some slight hops in the background, but very little.  Very smooth, full bodied and sticky. A slight warming sensation when swallowing.

45,680,Finkel,3.68,"This beer has been named appropriately as the color is literally the same as crude oil. Furthermore, the consistency sort of looked like oil in the way it moved; there was some obvious viscosity. Still, it looked really good and was complimented with a thicker, pillow head. Bubbles were streaming up from the bottom of the glass - this one's highly carbonated.  This beer is complex. Hops, dark chocolate, espresso, and alcohol could be made out with only a few whiffs.  The taste was definitely chocolately with roasted flavors backing it up. However, a malty, bitter flavor was strong as well as the 10% ABV. The alcohol bled right through which was EXTREMELY disappointing. I definitely liked the taste but the alcohol killed it. Maybe I got a bad batch or something, but I couldn't finish my glass.  Typical of the style, this beer was on the thicker side, which also hurt it's drinkability rating for me.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smells of strong chocolate, roasted ceder and raisins in the background. Tastes of very strong chocolate up front melding to a fig and raisin flavor ending with a nice roasty characteristic. Finishes sweet with a slight chalky taste. Chocolate has a great bitterness and doesn't taste artificial unlike other beers (see Harpoon's stout). Alcohol is pretty well hidden as well. Mouthfeel is very creamy with moderate low carbonation.  A great RIS. The chocolate in this works perfectly with the roasted malt. Plus for the price, you can't beat this deal.

45,680,jpiper,4.05,"Appearance 4.5 Once poured, my sifter becomes a solid, glossy ball of delight. It's extra-black with not a hint of light coming through - like a cue ball with a tall tan head. The head slowly recedes, leaving a thin layer and some foam on the edges of the glass. Smell 4.5 The smell is delicious and inviting. There's tons and tons of chocolate, some roasted malt, raisins, and booze. The alcohol is pretty apparent - even on the nose. But it still makes me want to bury my nose into my snifter. Taste 4 The flavor is very, very rich and pretty complex. It completely coats the mouth with warm, roasted malts. There's dark chocolate and coffee mainly, but other slightly roasted flavors. Also a little tartness in the front. There's a good bit of bitterness on the finish, which is accompanied by a warm maltiness and a boozy flavor. Mouthfeel 4 Thick, smooth, and clingy. Not chewy, but somewhat heavy - not quite like drinking an 8 ball. Drinkability 3.5 The booze contributes to making this a sipper, but there's not much else holding this back from being an extremely inviting sipper. Overall 4.15 Quite a beer from Brooklyn.

45,680,yeastsipper,3.6,"Received as part of a trade with Blazer06. Enjoying a back to back tasting with the Terrapin Wake and Bake Stout on a cool night in the middle of nowhere Georgia. Notes from 12/29/08:  Beer pours black with legs that look like a dark red wine. An attractive looking beer.  I pick up, besides the obvious chocolate notes, notes of roasted coconut. This surprised me a bit, but this was repeatedly the dominant scent. There are also notes of raisins and red wine vinegar.  The chocolate flavor dominates. It is a somewhat bitter, dark chocolate, which I like. Roasted malt is prevalent on the back of the palate. Coffee flavors are more evident as the beer warms.  The mouthfeel is a little lite. Ideally, the beer would be a bit thicker, but I am reminded more of a porter than a stout. The alcohol warms the back of the throat.  The BCS is full of flavor, but the chocolate I was enjoying on the initial sips I enjoy less as the bottle nears its end.  All in all, a very solid beer. I would be happy to have more in my fridge (they are not available in CA) but I would not seek it out.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BARFLYB,3.58,"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter after a long day at the job. 08-09 bottling. Pretty fresh.  A- Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout pours a very dark black. The liquid looks fairly thick and has some shiny slickness to it. This pour yielded a 1&1/2 finger light tan head that was packed tight and stayed throughout the session.  S- BBCS has a very roasty smell to it which gives off a bunch of flavors including chocolate(big surprise!)an array of malts and a bunch of dark fruits. The alcohol makes it self known and actually detracts from the other smells. I was a little off put by the initial smell but it improved with a little warming.  T- Sippin on BBCS the maltiness of this stout pretty much dominate the other flavors and the dark fruits are ever so present. Not as much chocolate as i would like. Some coffee is thrown into the mix. The hops come through in the end slightly, but make BBCS a slighty bitter tasting stout. The alcohol is present throughout the drink, but the chocolate comes out with warming.  M- This stout is quite thick and a bit creamy, very full-bodied, but rough around the edges. One and done for me. A nice warming effect from the alcohol. BBCS is quite slick and stays on the tounge for a bit.  D- The harshness of the alcohol and over abundance of dark fruits was a bit off putting and i would have trouble cracking open a second. I hope the chocolate comes out more with some age on it.

The aroma is sweet, roasty, very raisiny and malty, like sweet, dark fruit. It is not very strong though, it could serve to be a bit stronger. The taste is sweet. quite chocolatey- dark and milk. A raosted taste, especially in the aftertate. A lot like dark fruit, again. A slight pinch of bitterness in the aftertaste, otherwise it is mostly sweet with a viscous, chewy mouth.

I was with some annoying people and thought it could help.  I was a little dissappointed. I definitely tasted the alcohol. There was no way to hide that.  I did not taste chocolate (if I was supposed to).  It was not full bodied, which is why I gave this ranking.  Overall, it wasn't bad. It went fine with the Carnita Burrito (which is sensational for anyone ever going to Mad Mex)  Peace out.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,darklordlager,4.1,"Pours an oil black, with no highlights when held up to the light. A good 1/3"" dark tan foam layer formed after the pour. 4 Smell is of chocolate, booze, some dark fruits, a little bit of smoke.  Taste is BIG chocolate up front (big surprise), very sweet, almost overwhelming anything else. Finishes with an acidic/bitter flavour reminiscent of dark chocolate.  Mouthfeel is syrupy and coats the tongue with each sip.  Drinkability-Limited by the sweetness of this brew, and the ABV.  Delicious, very sweet--definitely a dessert beer. Not all that complex, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bkilpatr,3.91,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an Ommegang chalice. 01/02/09. Winter 08-09 version.  Pours nearly pitch black with about on finger of dense dark brown head. The head stayed around for nearly forever, and left some nice lacing around the glass. This is a very beautiful beer. Aroma is full of dark roasted malt and dark chocolate, with a hint of coffee.  Taste starts with heavily roasted malt and plenty of dark chocolate. Some caramel, vanilla, milk chocolate, and hints of dark fruits and cherry. Slightly sweet up front with a nice bitter dark chocolate finish. A hint of hops in the finish as well. The alcohol is pretty well hidden in the taste, but still noticeable. Overall, the taste is heavy on the roasted and bitter side.  Feel is smooth and creamy with ample carbonation. It's full-bodied and slightly heavy. Slight warming from the alcohol. Drinkability is decent for a heavy beer and the alcohol is fairly well-hidden.  Overall, a pretty tasty beer. A bit rough while fresh though and would probably benefit from a bit of age. Definitely worth a try though.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,scifan,4.41,"Pours pitch black from the bottle to form a small brown head that dissapates very quickly. Leaves some lacing after first few small sips. Not getting much on the nose but what I do smell is good. Lots of coffee, of course the chocolate come through quite well with a bit of alcohol also. Lots more flavor than the smell was giving me. Intense roasted barley, a bit of coffee, and chocolate flavors coming through together to please my palate to complete satisfaction. The only criticism would be the alcohol isn't well hidden but at over ten percent i guess it gets a little hard to hide. Overall a fantastic beer that i can't get a enough of while it is still here for us to enjoy this winter season.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,matt062286,3.93,"Appearance - pours very thick and black. Thick mocha colored head. Very nice lacing and decent head retention.  Smell - Cocoa powder, dark chocolate, caramel, a little bit of cherries, and alcohol. It smells great, reminds me of English chocolate, far superior to the chocolate in the states.  Taste - surprisingly not much chocolate initially. Tastes more of dark fruits and alcohol. A lot of higher ABV's have something to try and mask the alcohol but this one does not. The aftertaste on this one is of espresso and dark chocolate, which makes up for the average initial taste.  Mouthfeel - Pretty thick, but not quite syrupy. Higher carbonation than expected.  Drinkability - The first one went down pretty easy, but the ones afterwards were much harder to drink. The 10% ABV and heavy body make this a one and done in most cases. Can't beat the price either, I got this for $10 for a 6 pack, compared to $15 around here for a sixer of Mad Elf which is only 1% higher.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TMB0424,4.2,"Pours a thick black motor oil body with a coffee colored head, nice sized, but didn't retain too well. Nevertheless, damn good looking beer. Good lacing strewn through my glass.  Smells is extremely rich. Dark, toasted malts. Bitter, dark chocolate. A slight hint of fruitiness masked by an extremely pleasant smoke aroma. Excited to try.  Taste is of dark chocolate, slightly bitter - slightly sweet. Nice balance. Chocolate is followed by a ripe fruit, yeasty taste. Hint of coffee. The finish is probably my favorite part - long lasting, bitter, coffee/dark chocolate mix. Great.  Creamy mouthfeel, went down a little bit better than I had expected. Alcohol is obviously there, but it doesn't intrude on the beer at all. It only provides a nice warmth during the finish. Medium-full bodied.  At 10% ABV, obviously you wouldn't want to wack down too many of these. But it's very smooth going down, perfect to accompany a nice dinner or dessert. Recommended.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mphopkins99,3.98,"Pours a deep black, with a small reddish head that leaves very little lacing.  Alcohol smell is prevalent. Some malt nd yeast notes, with a hint of coffee.  Great taste. The alcohol hits first and the subtle caramel and chocolate notes linger in the aftertaste.  Very smooth, lightly carbonated.  While it is delicious and very drinkable, it is a tad on the heavy side and the 10+ abv makes this a better sipping or dessert beer. Can't imagine drinking more than two of these at a sitting.  A very good stout that I will seek out again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,haz77,3.11,"A - Pours almost opaque very dark brown, with a finger of dark tan head. This falls slowly to a thin ring. Not able to see any carbonation.  S - Liquorice, molasses, chocolate, prune. Not as much going on as I'd hoped for.  T - Molasses/liquorice at the front with some toffee breaking through in the middle. Herbal hops begin to come through, then some bubblegum in the background, towards the finish. Aftertaste is smoky and quite bitter. Alcohol well masked.  M - Creamy, medium-full body and pleasant soft carbonation.  D - Fairly easy to drink given the masking of the alcohol, but found it overall to be quite average.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Left beautiful lacework on the glass as the beer was consumed.  S- Definite notes of chocolates and sweet malts. Very pleasant.  T- Wow! What a surprise. The chocolate flavors and malts were definitely noticeable. What I enjoyed most was the mysterious finish of what seemed like dark fruits.  M- Thick and viscous with some carbonation.  D- Definitely a sipper, but amazing taste. Very drinkable.  Overall, this beer was awesome on-tap. I was not expecting the taste to be so smooth. The chocolate and dark fruit just added to the wonderful complexity of this beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Walken,4.25,"Brooklyn: Black Chocolate Stout (08-09') (Tasted 01/01/09) 12 oz. bottle, poured into a snifter.  Appearance: Black, slick liquid pours out into the glass, opaque, as far as I can tell. Mocha head forms up quickly then fades down into a thin cap and crown, leaving near solid lacing. Odor: Blended dark & milk chocolate, overripe strawberry and acrid charcoal aromas sit on a full, rich background of toasted bread aroma, hints of earthy hop too. Consistency: Very zen. Obviously, we're talking about a full bodied beer, but it's heavy without feeling too heavy. Acidity, roasty dryness and slight carbonation make this beer extremely drinkable for big stout. Taste: Bittersweet dark chocolate kicks things off, yeasty fruitiness compliments. Balance seems to come from two sources in equal amounts, roasted malt and clean hop bitterness. Despite the acrid roasted aromas, the roast malt doesn't provide nearly as much bitterness as in many other beers of this style. Alcohol throws down on the back of the tongue, bringing a bit of warmth into the finish. Fruity alcohol, bittersweet chocolate flavors and earthy hops linger on for a while.  Booyah. I've loved this beer since the first time I tried it 3 years ago. It's balanced & drinkable with a whole lot of complexity. Can't wait to try Black Ops.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,beveritt,4.7,"Presentation: Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into a large snifter. Label says that this was made in the Winter of 2008-2009.  Appearance: Pours with 1 finger of dark tan head. This settles slowly, first just compacting, but eventually retreating to a thin coat of foam, a ring around the glass, and an island in the center. Decent lacing. The beer itself is black, simple as that. No sediment in the bottle.  Smell: Smells of bitter coffee and sweet chocolate, with the slightest whiff of licorice.  Taste: Coffee and roasted barley present themselves immediately upfront. As the beer warms,definite hints of oak develop. A slight alcohol presence, manifested as a cherry vanilla finish. Long, lingering , semi-sweet finish.  Mouthfeel: Average carbonation level. Tremendous body; you know it is going to be good as you pour this syrup out of the bottle.  Drinkability: Yum. Very impressed. I have the remaining 5 from the six pack and some of these are definitely going in the cellar. At $8.99 for a six pack, this is nearly half the price of some of the other RIS I usually age.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

If I would have reviewed the oldest sample that I had on this evening (04/05), this beer would have gotten no higher than a 2. Doesn't cellar very good at all!!!  A - Dark brown to almost black.  S - As it gets newer, fresher smell. Chocolate. Bitter. Coffee notes.  T - Smooth when drank within 2 years of bottling but after this....forget it. Horrible taste 3 years or older.

45,680,thekevlarkid,4.09,"Out of a bottle this beer was a completely opaque black color. The head was one finger of maple brown foam. The retention was moderate, the lacing about the same. The aroma was a rich blend of caramel, toffee, chocolate, roasted malt, ripened fruit esters and hints of alcohol. The flavors were at first rather sweet, the caramel and toffee being up front. This then mellowed out and became more chocolate, coffee and roasted malt based. Hints of dark fruit peaked out in the middle along with some alcohol heat before leading to a long, bitter espresso finish. Complex, rich and well balanced but not overbearing for 10% (!). The mouthfeel was slightly above average, the soft carbonation perfect for the style, the body full. One of the better beers this brewery makes and worth the shot.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,biboergosum,4,"355ml bottle. The most recent release - winter 2008/2009, a nice potential prep for tonight's New Year's festivities.  This beer pours an opaque black hole, with ever so slight trapped cola edges and one fat finger of light brown head, which leaves some nicely threatening storm front lace around the glass as it slowly recedes.  It smells strongly of semi-sweet baker's chocolate, roasted caramel malt, toffee pudding, weak coffee, a soft musty hoppiness, and bristling alcohol - a lot like those boozy chocolates at one's family gatherings this time of year. The taste is bittersweet gritty chocolate, toasted bready caramel malt, salty toffee, black coffee, a not so strange perception of boozy wood, more musty leafy hops, and a sidling alcohol warmth.  The carbonation is quite low, but not so sedate as to shirk its structural duties, which include, amongst others, contributing to the generally smooth and creamy mouthfeel. It finishes fairly sweet, the chocolate, malt, and alcohol all mixing and matching, simmering, yet nothing is overwhelming.  A very tasty strong stout, but not one for cycling through the four pack in one sitting. The chocolate is deftly rendered as well, so this is also a stellar accompaniment to any of my Mom's care package of Christmas confections.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Very 'roasty' with hints of coffee and smoke.  Big roasted malt flavor. Nice chocolate flavors, both sweet and dark. Slight coffee notes. Hints of smoke. Sweet caramel and dark fruit notes. Some toasted nuttiness. Very light spiciness on the end. (Is that from hops?) Very smooth and well blended flavors.  Sadly, I find this to be slightly too thin. Should be a little creamier and more full. Just a touch too waterey.  The 10% ABV is very well hidden, making this a very drinkable brew. Very smooth and tasty.

Heading sits for a while with beautiful lacing. Taste of chocolate immediatley tasted with smooth mixture of coffee. Moutful of the same with a touch more caramel.Settles very nicely in the gullet and could drink another but because of the alcohol content I will take it easy. Thanks to cliffnorm I tried this with a piece of chocolate and it does taste awesome.  Re-Review on Nov 1 2009. Almost been a year since I had this and thought I'd re-review it. Poured into a snifter. Pours an opague black with a very thick light brown heading. Very heavy and thick looking with crazy lacing and legs clinging to th glass.  Smell is much more chocolatey than last. Heavy roasted malt aroma is dominate with slight touches of coffee and vanilla.  Taste is a little different than last year as well. The heavy roasted and chocolate malts are immediate. The warming alcohol kicks in shortly thereafter with a slight gritty coffee filling the palate.  Mouth is super smooth with a thick full body and very creamy texture but does break up do to the warm alochol feel.  Drink is decent a bit heavy for a sesion brew but a definite must taste and now more than ever one of my true favorites.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Roasted grain character. Some dark chocolate notes enhanced by a tinged bitterness from hopping I presume. Port like-vinous. Boozy. Dark chocolate bitterness.  MF: All sorts of alcohol warming.

It is so dark and so chocolaty, it's unbelievable. This one definitely lives up to its name.   Mouthfeel - This beer is full in the mouth, was very big with an amazing smoothness. lipsmacking!

Light in body but cumbersome in carbonation; it stings the palate a bit. Flavors of chocolate, wood, alcohol, roast, and coffee notes. The alcohol is masked pretty well but this beer has a carbonated water feel to it rather than milky as I prefer.

Dark as night, zero translucence with a dark tan head that quickly dissipates with no lacing.  Smell of chocolate, coffee and cherries. Alcohol is definitely present in the nose as well with a hint of wood.  Taste is an excellent follow through with the smell. Chocolate and coffee are the primary flavors. Nuts and fruits come through as well. A bit of a heavy finish with bitter hops punctuating the experience. Alcohol is there, but certainly blends into the flavor so well that you might forget its there.  Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. A nice thick stout that holds well against its peers.

Tons of lacing is left on the sides of the glass after each sip. S- Dark chocolaty roasted malts, light hops and more dark fruit than I expected. T- The taste is what you'd expect from the smell. Roasted chocolate malts and dark fruits. The hops are present at the end and in the lingering bitter aftertaste. M- Thick and creamy. The 10% abv is not particularly noticeable D- Very high for a RIS.  I found this on sale at my local beer store for 8.99 a six pack which in my opinion is great for a RIS.

Lots of dark fruit backed with hints of espresso, coco and dark brown sugar. The alcohol hovers in the background, but never becomes obtrusive. The chocolate is definitely subordinate in the taste profile.  The mouth is thinner than I expected for a beer this big. This is a wonderful beer to have on this cold snowy evening.

The Taste steps it even further. The dominant sweet flavor is chocolate. The bitterness is rich, strong, and dries off the sweetness from the palate. The alcohol is spicy and warms the belly.

45,680,dasenebler,4.35,"Pours like a good imperial stout, that is, like motor oil. Totally opaque, decent dark tan head when poured into Murphy's stout glass. Aroma is kind of tangy, with licorice and malt, along with a bit of alcohol.  Taste is awesome, though I do think it could be bit more smooth. First impression is very bold, strong, and somewhat alcoholic. Aftertaste is great, deep roast and dark chocolate. Overall, tangy and pretty bitter, just like a good piece of chocolate. Luscious, heavy mouthfeel, which coats the mouth and then some. Some carbonation, but ultimately not a whole lot. Great lacing. Not very ""drinkable"" since it's 10% and really heavy, but my overall impression of the beer is that it's delicious and outstanding.

45,680,DVTO2,4.35,"The first time I tried this I got a quick thumbs up from my local retailer and brought it home to compliment my chile. The chile was hot enough that I didn't really taste the alcohol and I couldn't understand why my ears seemed to be flushed after only one glass of beer. It wasn't until I read other reviews that I learned it has a hefty 10.5% alcohol content - this is definitely a sipping beer.  The beer is dark and pours nicely into the glass with a full light chocolate head. The brew lives up to it's name as chocolate dominates the tasking notes from start to finish. In all honesty, I would probably rate the beer a bit higher if it had less alcohol, maybe just because I'd feel freer to drink more than one. Tonight I'm snowed in and am not going to bother plowing the driveway, so I can drink with confidence. However, I do think the alcohol detracts from the taste just a tad, enough to keep it out of the exceptional catagory. The brothers seemed to split on their impression of this beer.

Smell is 3 things at once; chocolate first, malt second and alcohol third. Nicely balanced, but these three stand out. Very inviting smell, pretty much what you would expect of the style.  Taste is similar to the smell in that you notice the same three things, in that order. Chocolate doesn't overpower as I expected, but is somewhat balanced with the malt. Slight alcohol burn comes on shortly after swallowing, but at 10%, you'd expect that to some extent.  Mouthfeel is not the most impressive part of this beer, but it's smooth & creamy and the alcohol gives it somewhat of a warming feel.  Drinkability is about average. For one, I don't think many of us expect to session a 10% stout, but this is one I wouldn't have more than maybe 2 of in a sitting.  Overall a very good beer from Brooklyn, and worth trying this winter.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jiggahertz,4.43,"My first try at a chocolate stout. Picked this up in a six pack for ~$10.  A: Inch and a half amber head turning brown from an aggressive pour just bellowing over the top of a pint glass. Head sticks around forever and resembles chocolate mousse at first.  S: Chocolate. Malt comes through as the head begins to dissipate.  T: Chocolate at first, then the malts really come through with coffee and nutty flavors. Finishes incredibly sweet.  M: Flavor sticks around for a while. Mild carbonation, can't tell it's 10.6% ABV.  D: The taste has a lot of subtleties that keeps me lifting the glass. Probably wouldn't want more than one in a sitting, but makes for an enjoyable sipper.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Spidey13,3.98,"Black Chocolate Stout pours a deep, dark black with a small brown head. On the nose, there is a lot of roast and coffee notes. A bit of alcohol and chocolate and a good amount of dark fruit.  The taste have quite a bit of dark chocolate flavors, roastiness. A lot of bitterness and astringency on the back, which reminds me a lot of dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is thick and a bit creamy with low carbonation.  Though the thick mouthfeel and high alcohol make this a slow drinker, it is quite tasty.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,f0gg,4.85,Pours a DARK black with small layer of head on top. Amazing chocolate smell with a hint of malt and coffee. Great mix of chocolate and coffee flavor that has a bit of a bitter taste to it. Mouthfeel is slightly carbonated and seems to stay with you with a coffee aftertaste. This is not a beer to drink quickly its something to sit down with relax and enjoy for a little bit. One of my favorite beers that I have had recently and would definately purchase again.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,biggred1,4.5,"Very dark brown, impossible to see through. Big pillowy chestnut head that lasts long after the pour, leaves some cocoa colored lacing on the glass. Smell is predominately chocolate and rich roasted coffee very little hop in the nose. Tastes like it smells chocolaty and rich, some bitterness but in a semisweet chocolate sort of way. Really gains complexity as it warms, an almost vinuous,raiseny quality. Thick kind of chalky mouthfeel.Coats the tongue and throat. Delicious and highly drinkable, the alcohol is only slightly perceptable for such a strong brew. One of the best winter seasonals for my money.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Duhast500,4.35,Color is a dark black. When I poured it into my glass it had a very small light brown head about a millimeter in height. When held up to the light it completely opaque.  Smell is heavy chocolate with a roasted malt flavor. A light hop smell brings out the sweetness and a bit of a coffee smell as well.  Taste is of chocolate but is not too overpowering. It is also a bit bitter taste with a coffee flavor on top of a burnt malt aftertaste.  This brew does have that lingering after taste but it is slight and not very strong. It does take a sip or two to get used to. It is bit strong and can overpower you a bit if you are not used to a beer that is this high in ABV.  It is worth the try is you like Stouts. I will be harsh on the palette at first but it is a very delicious offering from the Brooklyn Brewing company. I plan to comeback to this again in the future.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,everetends,3.73,"12 oz bottle thanks to the great IBUnit. This one has been eluding me for quite some time so it was nice to see it as an extra in that box. Served this one up in my Terrapin snifter.  A: Pours a . . . you guessed it, dark ass black. Pretty damned black that lets only a little light through on the edges in the form of dark brown that lets just a touch of light through. When poured, I got a good finger of mocha head that had pretty good retention even though I nursed the hell out of this beer. Lacing was somewhat sticky, but this beer is so slick it coats the glass and all of it slides back into the liquid. Good looking brew.  S: Smell is of some serious chocolate. The impressive thing is that you can smell some much chocolate. Dark, milk, cocao all coming out clearly. The malt is roasted, smelling a touch like some wood. Hops bring out a bit of bitterness. Coffee comes out as well.  T: Taste is of chocolate. Pure and simple that comes out loud and clear. All varieties named in the nose. The malt seems to be a bit burnt and a touch unappetizing. Coffee is dark and bitter as well. There is also a heavy alcohol flavor that seems to take a bit away from this. Bit of a shame but still enjoyable.  M: This is a full bodied beer . . . big time. Carbonation is low but a bit higher than expected. This beer is very thick, chewy and slick. Very nice. Really coats the mouth. Aftertaste is mostly of burnt malt and alcohol. Alcohol is a bit high, but does have a really nice warming character that somehow avoids burning the throat and warms from the stomach. This is good cold weather brew.  D: This was enjoyable but due to the alcohol level and burnt malt it is a sipper. I can't imagine poundinng this beer, it would hurt. I made it through an entire game of Trivial Pursuit (taking notes throughout) while drinking this one. Still it has its high points and it absolutely stands by the black and chocolate it references in its name. Pretty good stuff.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bc2208,4.69,"The six pack is just so inviting, I was excited to try this.  Pour: Pours a thick black abyss, with a dark tan head. Could have used more out of the head, which dissipated rather quickly, but no complaints.  Aroma: Massive malty smell - robust coffee and dark chocolate smells, few other nutty and roasted malt flavors in there.  Taste: Exactly as anticipated. Very well balanced taste - chocolate reigns up front, roasted finish, and a sweet coffee aftertaste. Flavors are strong but not overpowering. This beer is high in alcohol but it's hidden well. Great for a long, relaxing sipper.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation isn't too strong, but present enough to distinguish this from Kahlua!  Drinkability: Y'know, it's hard to see drinking more than 3 of these, but at 10% ABV there's not much need. I'm looking forward to another already.  This is a top beer for me.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Bung,4.18,"Black/brown pour with a brown head. Real good with the chocolate and grape type fruit aromas. Roasted malt and chocolate present throughout. Roasted coffee with a clean bite at the finish. Alcohol let's you know it's there, but not overpowering. By far, Brooklyn's best offering.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,StarlightSeraph,3.93,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Very dark brown and thick coming out of the bottle, looking almost pitch black in the glass. No light comes through. Poured with a one-finger chocolate-brown colored head, with lacing that lingered for awhile.  Smell: Hints of alcohol, and lots of chocolate and maltiness. I barely detected any hop aromas, though hints of them began to come through as the beer warmed, as did hints of chocolate and raisins.  Taste: Roasted coffee was the first taste in my mouth, and it exploded out of the glass. The alcohol taste is strong, unsurprising due to the 10 percent APV. However, it does lend somewhat of an astringency to the beer that is mildly unpleasant. There is some chocolate in the background, but coffee is the overpowering flavor. As it warms, the flavors begin to meld together.  Mouthfeel: Thick and rich, exactly what I expected out of this beer. Nicely carbonated as well, which kept me from drinking this too quickly (which is a good thing!)  Drinkability: An outstanding beer for sitting my the fire on a cold winter night. It's not something I can drink more than one or two of, however - but it's also a beer where it's worth savoring every sip.  I've heard some people say this isn't nearly as good as previous years' editions. This is the first year I've tried Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout, and it is definitely an enjoyable beer, and probably one of my favorites. However, I don't taste the chocolate nearly as much as I thought I would. This beer also gets much better as it warms.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,rabsten,4.38,"2008-09 vintage bottle to an East End Brewing pint. Black as coal, thick, Cocoa colored head with large bubbles, decent retention and good lacing.  Somewhat sweet aroma with a definite alcohol presence. Light anise hanging around in the background.  Starts with an indefinite sweetness. Is it chocolate, like the name? No. Caramel or toffee? No. Honey, sugar, .no, no....you get the idea. Some toasted grain and alcohol. As it warms a licorice note emerges and replaces the sweetness. Much better as it approaches room temperature. Alcohol is prevalent from start to finish; there's no questioning that this is an ""adult beverage.""  Hits the middle of my tongue and upper palate. Slight alcohol burn going down. What I want from a high ABV brew.  Smooth enough to be very drinkable, alcohol and all. I've had two over the last two hours and could easily drink more were I not cutting back.  BL: Very good Imperial Stout. It's not Storm King, but nothing else is, is it? Well worth your time. I'm going to get an additional six to age to see how it works out.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BigJim5021,3.9,"Pours jet black with a nice tan head. Decent lacing, but nothing too outrageous.  Smells of bittersweet chocolate and burnt malt. You can detect a hint of alcohol too. Smells a bit like booze-drenched fruit.  Flavor is more bittersweet chocolate and bold black coffee. Boozy at times, too. Tasty.  Mouthfeel is good, though not quite as viscous as I was expecting for 10%. With an RIS at that level, I expect Castrol GTX. Don't get me wrong, this shit is certainly thick; it's just not -- say -- Expedition Stout thick.  Drinkability is decent given the amount of booze you're dealing with. This certainly makes for a good warm-up on a cold winter night.

Hold off, buddha, nose goes first, & it says nice. My poor wife sniffs, but she has to work tonight, so she slinks away unhappily. The expected chocolate, a nice tip o' the coffee pot on the backburner, very dry, almost an Irish stout taste to this black boot. Initially a touch thin, but seems to thicken up as it warms.

It certainly is that, it is darn near opaque and appears as if someone has filled your glass with tar. Fortunately for us though, the flavor beats tar in a landslide.  Chocolate. Yup, maybe even coffee type flavors too. I find it rich and decadant as a flourless chocolate cake. It's got that dense, deep flavor to it that you really need to think about as you enjoy it.  Stout. Wonderful brown-ish head while carrying that great stout ""dryness"" in terms of mouthfeel. It's roasty and perfect for a cold winter night.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Brownies, brownies, brownies in my notstrils. Semi-sweet milk chocolate i believe with a soothing and inviting alcoholic warmth. Dry brownies, semi-sweet chocolate chips in watery cream. Evening blend coffee on the finish and also showcases the alcohol very well. Great nightcap, sipping beer. Just a lovely RIS.

45,680,yesyouam,4.16,"Rerate - 12 oz. bottle from winter '05-'06 Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout pours thick and black with a small brown head. Good lacing and retention. The aroma is a little sweet-- chocolate and salmiakki are present. It is thick and chewy in the mouth. There flavor has mellowed and has a little port wine quality. The salty licorice flavor is up front and the dry chocolate flavor comes at the end of the flavor. Well bittered and well balanced. This improves a lot by sitting around in the cellar! (rated May 14, 2008)  Previous review (Jan 22, 2007): This pours frighteningly black. It is a black that the Hubble telescope could not penetrate. It has a brown head that is very slight but can be brought back to life with a little wiggle of the glass. It has the smell of coffee, but not a dark roast. It smells more like Folger's or something. The aroma scatters from there: banana, bubble gum, toffee, brown sugar, alcohol, Coke syrup and... a first aid. The latter is something I could have used after drinking three of these. It has a moderately acidic and salty flavor. It's not the saltiness of sodium chloride. It's more like ammonium chloride. It is full and syrupy with a lively carbonation. The bitter aftertaste persists... as does the hangover. This beer is to be treated with respect.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

With three bottles in my possession, I can safely drink one. Or two. Or three. Review is of an '07-08.  Pours pitch black with a dark mocha head of moderate retention. Ok.  Smell of blended malt flavors. Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, chocolate chocolate.  Thick as the L.A. smog cover. Taste leans toward the dark side of chocolate. Other stuff in their too but I just wanna drink it. Can't taste the alcohol but you can sense it with the force. Actually I'm sensing it without using the force. Warming brings about some cocoa flavor and maybe, just maybe, a hint of black licorice.  Just a bit on the rought side; dryness. Not a deterrent for sure, but an imperfection.  Overall: glad I have more",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Mouthfeel: This one hits the pallet kinda heavy and slightly syrupy. light to medium carbonation. Slight creaminess.  Drinkability: With the ABV at 10% you can't have too many... ones gonna do it for me.  Overall: This is one for the cellar. I have 11 left and wanted to taste one fresh just to see what age will do to the rest. The cellar should work wonders on these bad boys.

45,680,saradad,4.4,"The first thing I noted was the smell of alcohol immediately upon opening the bottle. Pouring this into the glass releases more of the alcohol and then the chocolate just seems to overwhelm it completely. The head forms dark tan over an opaque ""used, burnt motor oil"" colored body. The scent now is all roasted chcolate and sugar or caramel. The taste is a chocolate-lovers dream with a slight fruit note on the side of the tongue (cherry? or maybe more of amaretto?) the alcohol is there but subdued. The mouthfeel is very full, like a mouth full of whipped cream (the real stuff, not the crap in plastic tubs!!) and the finish is dry in the mouth with a chocolate aftertaste having a stronger alcohol presence. The drinkability is very good but at over 10%ABV restraint must be shown. I put some of these back to age and hope to try them later.

45,680,TheDoorman,3.95,"2007-08 Bottle. Aged one year.  Pours like motor oil. A forced pour is necessary for a development of a brownish head that dissipates slowely. The nose is one serious roasty malt bomb. You can tell this beer packs a serious punch. Alcohol is present from the pop of the bottle. Beer pours like silk from the glass to my mouth. Creamy, delightful, thick palate. A touch of effervesance, but carbonation is extremely low. The taste is roasty maltiness throughout. I can feel the alcohol after just a few sips for this review. This beer has some serious warmth too. Great for the winter.  The roasty malt sweetness really defines this beer throughout. A great RIS. I'd want this if I were stuck in Siberia. But one per night is the limit.  This beer is consistently reviewed as an elite-elite RIS. I feel it is somewhat unbalanced as the alcohol dominates in places, but overall, its an absolute pleasure to drink.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Taste: A rich thick very tasty beer, best drunk slow until warmed to room temperature. The taste is all chocolate with a healthy dose of roasted barley. Dry in the finish which is good. But there is a touch of soy sauce flavor, not as bad as some doppels but noticeable. A very good beer and a good deal at 10 for a sixer.  Mouthfeel: Nice and creamy.

Plenty of head with respective staying power with the body's color lending itself to the head  Aroma: Dark chocolate with fancy coffee aromas wandering around in there.  Taste: Delightful. Tastes like it smells, with alcohol nipping at the taste buds and the top palate. Warming all the way down. One of the best after-tastes of any beer. As it warms you notice the alcohol more but still remains enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: Along with the 10.6% ABV getting your attention it doesn't distract you from the flavor and is somewhat soft.  Drinkability: It is a slightly heavy beer with tremendous flavor but for a beer meant for sipping it is suited for a casual drinking session within the limits of a six-pack.  Notes: I keep trying to cellar sixers of this tasty brew but as the winter progresses I find myself attracted to it and the next thing I know I only have a few left.

After the pour the head continued to grow and trace down the outside of my glass. I thought the head had great retention. The lace is the same warming brown and the thickness is measurable.  Smell: I get a strong aroma of burning chocolate with undertones of coffee. I can picture a Hersey's Special Dark candy bar. Not a sweet chocolate smell, but definitely has the bitter smell of dark chocolate.  Taste: The bitterness of the chocolate takes command of the palate. I also sense a nutty malt that is quite enjoyable. The coffee lingers on the tongue following the swallow, and the alcohol speaks loud and clear.  Mouthfeel: Exceptional, thick and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. After swallowing, my mouth is still coated. Good representation.

S = Deep aromas of semisweet chocolate, baking cocoa, light hints of burnt Sonora pine bark with a slight vanilla bean underneath.  T = Great balance with bitter dark chocolate mixing contrasting with fresh brewed French Roast coffee that has lots of cream and sugar. These flavors predominate up front in the mouth and into the midpalate where some lightly floral hops flavors appear in addition to the already present bitterness, nice long finish.

45,680,HitokiriNate85,3.58,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle.  Appearance - Pours inky black with a barely covering chocolate head that turns from a light froth to more of a real light, creamy covering. There isn't much of a head at all to lose, but what little there is stays throughout. Doesn't leave any lacing as I make my way through the glass. A bare 60W bulb can't even begin to penetrate through.  Smell - Some dark chocolate, but not in-your-face like I was expecting from the name. Sort of a dark fruit smell that I've found in other RIS's. Kind of reminds me of raisins/prunes/black cherries. There's some alcohol in the smell as well.  Taste - Wow. Now the name makes sense. While I didn't get a lot of chocolate in the nose, it was about all I could taste in the first sip. It's sort of what I might expect if I put really, really dark chocolate cocoa powder in my mouth. After that, alcohol cuts through pretty sharply, leaving my mouth dry and hot. That fruit taste comes through with the alcohol, but it's only there for a split second. The alcohol definitely blends in with the chocolate, though, even in the swallow. I can definitely see why people age this, and I'd fully expect it to get better.  Mouthfeel - Pretty smooth and kind of oily. As strange as it sounds, as it warms the feel turns a bit creamy. It doesn't leave as much of a coating as I expected, though.  Drinkability - One. It goes down fairly smooth, but the alcohol keeps it from being easier to drink. I can't imagine pouring myself a second one directly after. It's a big beer, though, and couldn't be further from the term ""sessionable,"" which is fine. It being bigger is fine, and I personally can't imagine knocking off drinkability points for that. However, the strong alcohol taste does.  To sort of conclude, I like it, but it definitely feels like it needs aged. There's just too much alcohol present in the taste, and I've had RISs that were better.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Little alcohol in relation to the abv it has. The mouthfeel is smooth and more crisp than I would imagen with the style and abv.

45,680,Dodo2step,4.32,P- Market Cross Pub in carlisle  A- pours a thick viscous creamy dark chocolate opaque color. A beautiful burnt nut brown head with a nice spotchy lacing.  S- cocoa and espresso beans. Also some dark fruit rounds it out but it is faint.  T- a dark chocolate flavor with the added bitterness. Light on the malts as well. very well hop/malt balanced. Espresso and prunes or raisins are the other tastes.  M-full bodied and very creamy. A very smooth and heavy beer.  D- This bad boy is high in ABV but this is a good brew. I could do two or three of these in a day. A nice winter beer for when it is snowing out. Instead of hot chocolate grab this bad boy.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bonkers,3.88,"I poured a 12 ounce botttle into a SA pint glass. It pours jet black with a fluffy tan head. The head leaves quickly, leaving pleasant streaks of lacing. The smell is more muted than I would have hoped. There are hints of chocolate and coffee, but they are faint. The overiding scent is alcohol. The flavor is good. It is a mix of alcohol, chocolate and coffee. The finish is of lingering alcohol. The beer is full bodied and hides the generous 10% abv well. A solid RIS, but it left me wanting more.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Buebie,4.34,"What better way to celebrate black friday then with a Black chocolate stout!  Bottle courtasy of Finnman, thank you.  This is a winter 07 bottle, I have an 06' bottle that I'll be hanging onto for a few more years.  Poured from the 12oz brown bottle into an oversized snifter. Served at 45 degrees. Dark brown 2 inch head sits atop the beer. Black in color with no light penetration. Sticky long streaking clumps of lace drapeing my glass. Retention is grand with a nice quarter inch layer and assorted bubbles.  Aroma is of chocolate grains, liquid chocolate extract, molasses, dark roasted coffee beans, chocolate cake batter with an eggy white flour aroma. Some alcahol notes at the nose. Absolutly perfect in the aroma department.  Smooth and creamy mouthfeel with a slick inky texture. Some carbonation up front, quickly melting away to smoother softer texture. Molasses in the flavor mix, with hints of brown sugar, roasted coffee, its sweet at first. Becoming bitter with chocolate flavors and notes of lingering bitter grassy hops. Alcahol warming throughout, not at all boozy, just a warming sensation.  This is definatly a sipper and not at all a sessionable brew. Its thick, heavy and filling. Two of these would take me to drunk town in no time. Its an exceptional brew and a perfect example of a chocolate ris. Mouthfeel is not as thick and creamy as others I've had and there is a bit more carbonation up front then I'd hope for. Aside from these things it is a terrific beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,misterdmac,4.22,"Hmmm, what a treat this is.  Pours not-quite-black, with a creamy coffee colored 1-finger head fading into a nice web of lace.  Nose is of sweet toasty malts, lightly roasted coffee, and milky chocolate sweetness. I was anticipating more bitterness but she has a sexy sweetness in the aroma.  That sexiness carries right over to the tongue. Darker chocolate right up front, with a bitter roasty finish. Alcohol warmth is ever so slight, this is just a fantastic drink for a winter evening.  The body was lighter than I expected for a 10+ beer. Silky carbonation and velvety warmth. Drinkable enough to share a pitcher with one buddy at Mellow Mushroom in Charlottesville the next night. But after around 32 ounces of this stuff, I was ready to mix things up.  Overall, this is just a great reason to look forward to winter. Stay righteous.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,theBubba,4.4,"Yum. I look forward to this one every winter. Beats the hell out of the overpriced, over spiced, Anchor holiday offerings.  Pours black as coal...not really, but you get my drift. Nice mocha colored head and a lingering lace in the glass. Do a sniff and you'll detect a little French roast coffee, a little cocao, and a bunch of banannas. The mouthfeel is yummy and the alcohol kick is apparent, especially if you've just had a crap stout like LaBatts prior to popping this baby. What you taste is exactly what you expect from the ""swirl and smell"" maneuver. Just check every review here at BA for this one and you'll get the idea. There's lots of agreement, and all us BA's can't be wrong.  On the downside, I wish the folks at Brooklyn gave this baby a label a little less slick and cosmopolitan looking. It doesn't belong on a RIS. Looks more like a Starbuck's Caffe Latte Malt Liquor.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TLove,4.33,"This flagship brooklyn brewery masterpiece is one of my favorite winter beers. Served from a bottle, it has a black, viscous color with great substance to the brew.  The beer smells and tastes of bitter chocolate and dark-roasted espresso bean, with the harshness of a heavy IPA and the smoothness of a wannabe irish dry, which happens to be a great combination.  Unlike its cousin, the smooth and welcoming Brooklyn Brown, this beer is just no holds barred, balls-out front with a classiness that is ahead of its time. There aren't too many stouts that would risk combining the bitterness of espresso bean and dark chocolate with the burnt dryness of a russian imperial and throw in some light cherry overtones and a wrenching 11% ABV.  A great winter brew for those looking for a substance-driven stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,damienblack,4.38,"Pours thick and viscous, with a head the color of cocoa powder. Lacing sticks around the glass. Jet black, this beer looks alive, with good carbonation. Smells strongly of chocolate, but not overpoweringly so. Also Hints at coffee and ever-so-slight fruit (banana?) to follow.  The initial taste is indeed coffee, though well in balance with the malt sweetness. Chocolate comes through more on the back palate, as the beer is on its way down. Pretty no hop profile that I can detect, which is just fine by me given the style. As the beer is warming, the sweet chocolate profile comes out more and the coffee takes a back seat. BCS coats the palate, and the chocolate taste lingers, though just enough to hint at what you just experience without being overpowering. There really isn't much of a ""burnt"" characteristic either, which is a pleasant surprise for me. If anything, while hard to put into words, this reinforces the ""live"" feeling my nose and eyes get as well.  Most surprising for me is the drinkibility. This is a very drinkable beer. It's carbonated enough to keep it from feeling stale, and the alcohol presence, while detectable, is subdued enough to make drinking easy. Some cellaring time can only reinforce this. Kudos to Garrett and the BB crew for an immensely enjoyable RIS.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,CHADMC3,4.38,"This RIS pours an oil slick black with a pillow like light tan head which patiently subsides to just a thin lacing.  The aroma pours from the head of the beer. The immediate scent is of overripe bananas, but after allowing the beer to settle the more traditional sweet chocolate and roasted malt aromas are apparent.  The flavor offers a very impressive sweet chocolate and smokey malt combination that is very pleasant. There is just a slight alcohol bite at the finish, but is masked well by the sweet chocolate malt that is more pronounced as the beer warms.  This medium to heavy brew is slightly chewy, creamy, and a bit hearty, yet easy to drink.  Yet another slow sipper for a quiet evening, this beer is completely satisfying to all of the senses, and warms the body.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The head looks outstanding-- insanely dark coco powder color. The glass looks identical to a glass of espresso. Smells of strong roasted malts and alcohol. Maybe some bitter chocolate in the back.  Tastes much like the smell description. Incredibly malty up front-- the roasted flavor is great. The alcohol flavor is disguised well, but you can definitely feel it going down.  I can't see having more than a couple of these... just too much for my stomach to handle.  I'm gonna save a bottle of this stuff for long-term storage.

I love the dark coffee and chocolate aromas. Toasted malts and rich deep chocolate fill the nose. I can detect a light hint of alcohol as well. Upon first taste I can tell this beer is well hopped and deeply roasted. I don't get as much chocolate as many other people have mentioned. I get lots of coffee. The Chocolate is definately evident in the nose, but not in the flavor (to me). I love the hop character of this one. I have alway enjoyed the RIS style because it gives you the stout flavors with plenty of hops and alcohol to boot.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Aroma is espresso, chocolate, burnt toast, berries. Mouthfeel is slick, medium-bodied, a little rough due to medium carbonation. Taste is roasted malts, black coffee, bitter chocolate, toffee up front, then a bit of hops and finishes with a strong alcohol warmth. As it warms the alcohol becomes almost overwhelming. Drinkability is moderate due mostly to the prevalence of the alcohol.

Filmy, chunky lacing behind it, like skeleton hands. Awesome looking beer.  S: You smell front and center the chocolate, a bitter chocolate scent and some type of nuttiness.  T: Strong coffee and alcohol and not much of the bitterness I detected in the aroma. The coffee undertones are both smooth and subtle. Vanilla starbucks coffee with boatloads of alcohol burn.  M: Pours and coats the mouth like NyQuil and a film is left in the mouth.  D: Not great but tasty. The alcohol is very out there and makes you take it slow and steady. The alcohol is too detectable, past the point of warming.  This is the most chocolate bar like RIS Ive ever tasted.

45,680,RicoBrew,4.45,"A- Absolute Pitch black, brown head that disappears quickly. It pours out in viscous manner, like a watered down syrup.  S- A rich, vibrant malt smell with a dark chocolate nose melded in.  T- Rich is the only way to describe it. You want to serve this beer at a little colder than room temperature to get the chocolate notes on your palate. The malt comes through and when it hits the back of your tongue, the chocolate comes through. A fair amount of alcohol warmth, but it's not overpowering. It's just there to remind you that you're drinking a RIS.  M- For having as high of a abv that this beer has, it's remarkably light on the tongue. No carbonation felt on the tongue, but the flavor lingers for a long while.  D- You don't want to sit down and drink a whole 6-pack of this by yourself. It's a dessert beer. Perfect with vanilla ice cream or a light fruit sorbet.  A huge recommendation for this beer is to serve it at around room temperature to get the full chocolate experience!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,chefdaddy18042,4.07,"A very tasty Russian Imperial Stout. It poured out with a very subtle head. Almost seasoned to have the characteristics of chocolate and deep tones of espresso. The drinkability surprised me. It had a great and easy palatability, but the 10% caught me off guard. The alcohol is barely detected,which is different thatn most beers with higher ABV's. Delicate sweetness is evenly distributed throughout the beer. Overall, i truly do enjoy this beer...more so once in a while rather than often.

Much more predominant as it warms up a bit.  T: An excellent combination of chocolate, coffee, espresso coffee, caramel and alcohol. Blends really well together and the alcohol, although noticeable, is not overpowering.  M: A full body beer. Thick, creamy and slick. The taste of chocolate is left on your tongue and mouth.  D: The ABV is 10%, so it is not a session beer, but it is a phenomenal beer to drink.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S- Chocolate dominates but is accompanied by rich roasted malts and hints of caramel.  T- Chocolate flavor comes in first but is swiftly backed up by a roased malt flavor. A very slight alcohol warming note quickly follows a light caramel sweetness quietly fighting against a pleasantly earthy hop bitterness which carries through the end.  M- Wonderfully viscous, my lips are sticky.  D- If you can get this and want some stuff from New Glarus, BeerMail me (if my trading budget allows).  For me, Imperial Stouts are hit or miss.

A bit of chocolate and some slight alcohol and thats about it.  T. Very wonderful. Layers of mocha, chocolate malt, cocoa powder and grains. A flash of hop adds a long standing bitterness. The alcohol in the smell is non-existent in the taste. Finishes a bit sweet. Still a lot of depth, layers and deliciousness.  M. Flawless. Outlandishly creamy and smooth.

Inky black in color; opaque, with no trace of light coming through. A small, somewhat creamy head of espresso foam appears for a brief period before settling to a thin cap, leaving behind a few traces of lacing on the walls of the vessel.  The nose is highly reminiscent of a barleywine, with notes of figs, dark chocolate, coffee, toffee, and a bit of booziness. Wonderfully sweet and powerfully inviting.  Body is full, with a mouthfeel bordering on syrupy but just holding off, with a palate full of sweet dark chocolate, dark fruits, bitter black coffee and slight hop bitterness, and a nice warming alcohol presence that carries through into the finish and down the throat.  Deceptively drinkable, this stout's high alcohol content is hidden very well, and the delicious bittersweet flavors and nice balance leave one pining for another.

Aromas of alcohol, chocolate, toffee, and some roast. Taste of bitter roast and hop up front then some alcohol and then a bit of ash. Lingering ash and roast bitterness in the aftertaste. Sticky and creamy mouthfeel. Thick body with light carbonation. Great stout with lots of potential, but fresh it seems a bit alcohol hot. Would like to see this with a couple years in the cellar.  Winter 08-09 bottle sampled 3/13/2011 Pours a solid black color with a smallish mocha head that slowly dissipates to a ring on top. Smells like chocolate, lots of dark and milk chocolate, caramel, faint herbal hops and hints of alcohol. Taste is sweet chocolaty with caramel, faint dark dried fruits, and a touch of alcohol. Taste is really smooth compared to fresh, it seems the flavors have had time to get happy happy together. The alcohol is still present, but not as overpowering and adds to the whole experience. Syrupy, creamy mouthfeel, medium to thick body, light carbonation. Great brew that ages wonderfully.  Winter 09-10 bottle sampled 9/30/2012 Pours a dark chocolate with a decent tan head that leaves a little bit of lace on the way down. Smells of chocolate, caramel, and roast with a hint of wet cardboard and ash. There's still a bit of alcohol in the nose. The flavor is caramel and milk chocolate up front that melts into some roast and ethanol then finishes with a bit of ash, earth, roast, and chalk that linger on the palette long after every sip. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet slick almost syrupy mouthfeel.

45,680,TheMistler,4.37,"Poured pretty thick. Not viscous to the point of being oil sludge, its a pitch black, nicely fluid brew that displayed only a little of dark tan head. An odd, spotty, multi-hued film remained, adding to the oily impression.  From the bottle I could very definitely detect dark chocolate on the nose, but also some creamy notes. The pour revealed a distinct spicy alcohol aroma.  Tastes of dark chocolate, of course, and that flavor remains throughout, though with evolving levels of bitterness and other flavors (especially as the glass warms). Dark fruits. Coffee bittering. Enter hops? The dry finish, combined with an alcohol spice and kick that hovers near - but does not get to the point of - astringency, left me feeling parched. Definite alcohol warming sensation.  Somewhat thick and creamy, this is a heavy and heady brew that will knock you on your ass, but taste damn good doing so.

Smells of some bitter chocolate and a little bit of alcohol. Roasted malt is also apparent.  Taste is lots of chocolate, some bitter chocolate. A touch of roasted malt, and maybe even a slight hop presence in the background. Very sweet and chocolately in the middle. Finishes with some alcohol. Leaves an aftertaste of dark chocolate.  The body is a touch below what I would expect for a beer of this size, but the carbonation is great. You do get a little bit of heat from the booze though.  This beer went down really easily. I was shocked to see the 10.60 ABV on this. Not to mention that a 6er is 10-11 bucks, which is a good price for a beer this big.

It's pretty balanced beer, even though alcogol is very noticable, thick and silky.

Some coffee, and lots of bitter dark chocolate. Again a substantial hop twang. Though, unlike other RIS with lots of hops, it stays in the back and does not overpower.

Nearly full bodied, smooth and creamy, a deep, strong if not complex taste, with exceptionally well hidden alcohol, with loads of sweet chocolate, unsweetened coffee to balance it with some roasted notes, some earthiness and spiciness.

Throughout consumption, alcohol odor becomes more prominent. Interestingly (perhaps), the now empty bottle smells like a delicious dark chocolate.  T- Dark coffee/espresso on the front, then a bit of cocoa on the end. Bare minimum of sweetness noted. Alcohol presence is conspicuous, though it mellows considerably as the beer warms .

There is some brown hints around the edges when held up to light though, making me guess that this is on the lighter side for a RIS. A decent one finger head that quickly dissipates and doesn't lace.  S: For a beer called ""Black Chocolate Stout,"" I am not discerning much chocolate in the nose...well, not more than any other RIS. There are some hints of chocolate, roast, dark fruits, and some vinegary scent noticeable.  T: Slightly disappointing with this one, but perhaps that is because I set my standards through the roof. The chocolate was only on par with other stouts, and the roast and bitterness really didn't cut it either. The vinegary aspect showed up as well. This masked the alcohol magically though, so that's a plus.  Overall, expectations were high for this one, and afterwords I was disappointing slightly.

45,680,Mauerhan,4.77,"thank you to turbine aka jerimiah for this awesome beer.  pours midnight black. with a one finger chocolate brown head. medium lacing. head lasts for a few minutes then falls.  smell is nothing but a symphony of chocolate and roasted malts. i wish they made soap that smelled like this. this smell can be summed up in one simple word. heaven. seriously new yorkers know how to do a chocolate RIS.  taste blows me away. a nice balance between the malt and the chocolate. very sweet but also very smooth. i dont get ANY alcohol. which shocks me. seeing as it is in the double digits.  mouthfeel is awesome. this is smooth, creamy, lush, and many other adjectives that describe something comforting. its like it wants to rock me to sleep.  drinkable is an understatement. this beer is AWESOME",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,SusurusIgnoramus,4.68,"Dark dark dark, no light coming through, coffee and cream colored head that dissipates sooner than I would expect. Swirling brings it back, not a lot of lacing. There's sweet chocolate malt, and coffee nose, hint of bitterness, can smell the alcohol warmth The bitter coffee taste is balanced by a mild sweetness. This gives way to hop bitterness and alcohol. It definitely earns the ""Imperial"" title. Mouthfeel is thick, but not overly so; smooth, and creamy. Substantial Slides down the throat slowly. Very pleasant.  It's too heavy to have a lot of, but it tastes so good I could see myself throwing back three or four before realizing what hit me. Then I would stand up, and the floor would hit me.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,wiseguy142,3.8,"Pours black with a nice dark brown head that disappears quickly leaving little if any lacing. Smells of alcohol and dark fruit with some light, sweet smokiness to it- nothing overpowering though, unlike some RIS's, but attractive nonetheless. The taste is also pretty mellow- moderate alcohol up front with more of a ""twang"" to the dark fruit that could be construed as oxidation, although I don't think it is. Maybe a little metallic as well. Since it's so mellow, it makes for an easy drinking beer. The lack of anything really ""extreme"" in the beer is nice to see in a RIS.. sort of bringing it back to basics, but it does show some of its flaws a little easier.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,roadhouse,4.12,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, 08-09 bottling, into a snifter.  Appears an opaque black with a half inch dark tan head. Sinks down to a spotty film and leaves some spotty lacing to go along with it.  Aroma has lots of chocolate, some coffee, rum soaked raisins, figs, and molasses.  Taste has lots of dark chocolate up front with the rum soaked raisin note right alongside it. Midway through some coffee-like roasted flavors come out and it becomes increasingly bitter with a nice hoppy flavor to finish it off.  Mouthfeel is medium-full, not as thick as some RIS but it's still quite nice.  Overall this is a very solid RIS. It's nice to have something this good that is easily attainable and doesn't require camping out and bottle limits to obtain.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,kasper,3.93,"2007-2008 Vinagte (Approx 1 year old)  A: Pours an oily dark brown; few shades shy of black. Creamy chocolate milk head, with grain lacing riding the sides of the glass like grains of sand.  S: Dark fruits, alcohol soaked dark chocolate raisins, hints of dark chocolate, but for the most part the dark chocolate aroma has aged into dark, dried fruits.  T: Really similar to the nose, but there's a roasted component and you definitely taste the alcohol. It's somewhat of a trademark of this brew. Slight bitterness on the finish.  M: Full, and moderately carbonated, somewhat oily.  D: I love this beer, but after aging a case I'm kinda interested to try the fresh 2008-2009, as the year-old lost a lot of the dark chocolate component.

45,680,Ineedabeerhere,4.08,"I had this last year and thought it was a bit hot but this year's (""winter 08-09"") is much better.  Poured into a DFH snifter, nice one finger tan head. I drank this one over a period of about 40 minutes. Initially it smelt of roasted malts and chocolate. As it warmed up, the alcohol became more present, but even at its peak, the 10% was scarily well-hidden. Incredibly smooth, and became much more chocolate-y as it warmed. I'm not going to say that this beer is thin, but in comparison to some other stouts of similar ABV, it is thinner-feeling (which, IMO, adds to its drinkability).  I really enjoyed this, and for the price I found it at, you cant find a beer of this quality and high ABV that is comparable.

Chocolate flavor is very evident which makes this beer go down way to quickly. The alcohol seems to sneak up on you after you've finished off the bottle and it packs a bit of a punch.  Overall just an excellent beer, really looking forward to having a few more when the snow starts to fall.

Pours very, very dark, really dark brown head that lasts only a few sips :( Smells unbelievable - really strong aroma full of dark chocolate, sweet fruits, and some coffee. The smell is practically a meal on its own with this beer. Taste is similar to the smell, but actually not as interesting. Still great, though. Good carbonation for my tastes, but I think I may have liked it the general feel of the beer to be a little thicker. Alcohol is blended well, also. I just got a single bottle, and while I really do like this beer quite a bit, I'll probably end up buying an Old Rasputin pack over it, but that's just me.

Not as viscous and oily as some of the other stouts I've encountered.  S - I get more of a coffee flavor than chocolate, although there's certainly a hint of dark chocolate in there. There's also a hint of milky-cream as well.  T - This is where the real dark chocolate flavor comes out. There's also some roasted coffee taste. I'd probably rate this higher if I loved coffee or chocolate...  M - Lighter than I expected. Creamy and smooth.

45,680,thespaceman,4.35,"Purchased a 6 pack from Valley Discount Wine & Liqour in Waterbury, CT. Recommended by an employee there, so far positive reviews let see how it goes.  Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass  Appearance: Dark, almost black. Good coloring, with a generous head and beautiful lacing.  Smell: Espresso beans come to mind. Very rich smelling, deep cocoa malts appear on contact, a slight hint of butterscoth hops appears yet its very distant.  Taste: This one is like having your cup of Folgers with a kick in it, if only Starbucks can re-invent this into a coffee I'd drink it every morning. Again, a great coffee bean flavor with a kick of chocolate in the backdrop, this beer is enticing! Charcoal notes give away the alcohol taste you'd expect from a 10% ABV but it isn't too much. Nice balancing of flavors to alcohol content.  Mouthfeel: Mild carbonation gives away to a bitter yet highly hopped aftertaste. Smooth, creamy and decadent. A nice feel for something with this high of a ABV.  Drinkability: This one is a slow sipper, yet very drinkable without the alcohol content flooring it to the wall. If you like coffee or mocha flavorings you'll easily be able to throw back 3 in a hour. This beer is a ""creeper"", easy to drink due to the suttleness of the flavors but it does it's work in the end. A great job by Brooklyn, easily one of their best brews! If you see this in your cooler, grab it, you won't be dissapointed.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,oriolesfan4,4.23,Bought a single of this for $2.19 last week.  Let me preface this buy saying this is a damn good beer. It pours like motor oil with a nice tannish/white head. Smell is of chocolate malt and some alcohol notes. Taste is of the same but the alcohol taste is subdued. It definitely warms you for sure though and it's a definite sipper. The chocolate taste is very well present but not overdone so it makes for a great tasting beer. I enjoyed this one a lot.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The taste is similar, but not excessive chocolate. Any time I have a beer with ""coffee"" or ""chocolate"" or ""creme brulee"" in the title, I always worry that the flavors are going to go overboard.

The aroma is of roasted malts and heavy chocolate and a little candy like sweetness with a bit of alcohol. Tastes are of roasted malts and big chocolate as the name of the Stout implies. Also flavors of espresso, dark toffee and a little burnt toast are present. Mouth feel is smooth and medium in body-lighter than one might expect from a brew this dark.

The head retains at a broken sheet that leaves webby speckles of lacing on the glass.  The smell is chocolatey with a nice coffee backing, but a huge plummy, raisiny whiff of alcohol threatens to take over the aroma profile of the drink.  The taste features (or suffers from, depending on your perspective) the same dark-fruity alcoholic character as the nose, with charred malt, dusty cocoa and rich dark-roasted black coffee working hard to be known above the boozy, fortified-wine-style heat of this drink. Red apples macerated in dark rum notes emerge as the drink warms further. A nice earthy dryness denotes the finish.  Full-bodied and nicely carbonated, it seems to me that this year's edition Brooklyn's BCS has lots of potential and would benefit greatly from aging. Very boozy and hot right now with extremely limited drinkability as a result. I'll let the rest of the sixer age a while, give it a whirl again, and, if necessary, revise my review accordingly.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Settles to a nice surface coating 1/4 inch thick several minutes after being poured and eventually to a this surface coating along with a medium sized tan ring lining the inside of the glass. Pretty good lace. Robust aromas of deep roasted coffee, chocolate and malt along with a small hint of alcohol. Flavors of rich, sweet chocolate immediately hit my palate followed followed with some somewhat bitter roasted coffee. The sweet chocolate becomes more pronounced as the beer warms and the beer also becomes easier to drink as the beer warms a bit, with the taste of alcohol fading.

Little visible carbonation but who would know? Wicked thick.  Oily, brown sugar/cinnamon scent topping deep, dark but mellow roasted malt. Loads of depth and hearty coffee and chocolate texture with grass/pine from hops on deep background.  Grassy hops emerge here with the overzealous (not a bad thing) roasted malt. This one rolls a little hot, though - maybe needs some warmth and time? Excellent, however.  This deal beats the palate like a rented goalie. Balance in overabundance is an understatement. Carbonation actually makes an appearance on the finish with warmth to cut the heft a bit. Finish is surprisingly clean and tight for something so blessedly huge.  A sipper. A very good sipper. Very very good. But it needs time.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smell is chocolate, a little coffee, some molasses.  Taste is a little sweet, a little bitter and a lot of dark maltiness and is that a bit of fruit I taste coming through. There's some chocolate in there somewhere, but not enough to live up to the name. However, that said this is still a tasty stout.  Mouthfeel is probably the most lacking aspect of this beer. It's good and thick enough, but just a bit on the flat side. This doesn't kill the beer, but could use just a bit more carbonation.

Serious chocolate taste, but the harshly bitter espresso flavors detract from it a bit. These should smooth out with a little age, hopefully.  Six month update: This one has blossomed fantastically now that it has a little age on it. The aggressive alcohol notes have faded, giving the espresso and chocolate flavors even more room to shine.

Drinkability is not great, due to the high alcohol content and heaviness of the beer, but it is delicious.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,barleywinefiend,4.33,"Big thanks to Drunkmonk for this! Poured very thick, dark black with a brown creamy head that impressed me. Nose and taste of rich roasted malt with hints of cocoa and coffee. It had a great malt ptofile and the strong ABV was well hidden. Excellent brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,midweb23,4.12,A - Dark black color with a thick 2 inch head that leaves multiple lines of lacing.  S- Strong smell of chocolate and coffee.  T - A strong roasted malt flavor that leaves a slight chocolate aftertaste. You can really feek the high alcohol content which leaves your throat and chest warm.  M - Very thick and creamy.  D - A great brew for its style!,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,paulthebeerguru,4.4,"A: snifter. pours an abyss like black with a huge tan head. good head retention rate and great, sticky lacing.  S: Wow! Huge roasted malt aroma. big chocolate flavors, coffee and toffee. some bittersweet chocolate. some raisins as well.  T: some nice roasted malts, which brings out some serious chocolate, coffee, and some black currents and raisins.  M: full-bodied. mild carbonation level. very creamy.  D: amazing both fresh and aged. solid brew and well worth a try.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JohnGalt1,4.03,"12 oz received as a plethora of cool extras from PEBKAC more than 6 months ago now... decided to crack one tonight as my ongoing cellar clearing project... enjoyed from my Kasteel tulip.  Jet black brew of course... head looks creamy like foam atop an espresso.. but lasts alot long and leaves picture perfect spotty lace.  Aroma is impressive mix of chocolate and yeasty fruitiness.. cocoa and subtle coffee notes.. a little bit of mild sweet cherry.  Flavor is dark chocolate and coffee... fairly dry throughout... lingering finish is reminiscent of chocolate covered dried cherries.. a little nuttiness is also present... body is less than expected for a brew of this ABV, but it is still fairly viscous with just the right amount of carbonation.  A pretty class brew from a class act trader... Adam we must do it again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,kinger,4.54,"Unique Imperial, well crafted. My first sampling was with the '04-'05 batch and I've been enjoying this every year since. Pours an incredibly thick jet black with a nice tan head, there is a medium amount of lacing that sticks to the glass. Rich velvety aroma of chocolate and red wine with other dark fruits and roasted nuts. This inviting scent is unique from the other imperial stouts I've had thus warranting the high score. Mouth feel is smooth and sweet. When fresh the sharp alcohol is dominant, but after some age the burn fades and you are presented with a tangy, dry creaminess. Black Chocolate is an applicable name for this one although the standard roasted dark malt and coffee flavors are present there is a nice blend of chocolate malt that seems to take over. This isn't milk chocolate either, dark dense sweet chocolate makes this beer a thing of beauty. Nutty with notes of raisins and sherry wine. Like the aroma this flavor stands out in a unique way. A year in the bottle does wonders for this complex brew. Big bonus points for being somewhat unique comparatively as well as being such a bargain. I stock up every season when this hits the shelves. //Additional notes and rating on 12-14-07 after enjoying a well aged bottle.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,phattysbox,4.08,"12oz bottle poured into Duvel goblet. Amazing 2 inch head (brown) that reduces slowly, nice lacing. Black as night.  Booze is first evident followed by bittersweet chocoloate and toasted malts. Taste is very boozy... But interestingly when this brew warmed up it had a completely different profile - alcohol profile melded more with the malts and the bittering hops and bitterness from malts came out more.  Very nice brew once it warmed up. Serve at cellar temp or warmer or the alcohol stings too much. Fantastic when you get to the last 1/4 of the glass!! Definitely seek out again",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,johnd513,3.73,Thanks go to JasonA for this one.  This beer pours dark black and smells of dark chocolate. The taste is smooth and creamy but is hot on the palate from the high abv which is also present. The drinkability is moderate because of the high upfront abv. Overall an excellent RIS. Not my favorite but its one ive been wanting to try for some time now and im glad I did.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,CamuMahubah,4.11,"Black...tan little tiny bubbles...  Smelled a bit like a red wine with chocolate...a touch of coffee...  The taste is very complex and strong, as the alcohol is everywhere. A nice almost cherry like accent to the chocolate with coffee overtones. An Old World charm...  Heavy...  Alcohol is to prevalent to drink many of these, though I don't believe that was ever the intention. Wait a minute! As I finish this one I start to wish for another!  This was an extra from a trade with sincereNc. Thanks Bro!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Ragingbull,3.73,"Dark black color with mocha colored foam head that slowly dissipates. Some prickle that dissipates as well. I have smelled some characteristics of the nose in other imperial stouts. I can smell the chocolate malt but there is something in the nose that makes me think of an irish stout or red ale. Faint hints of smoke. Very lush and very thick mouthfeel. The malts are roasted pretty fully as I almost felt like I was eating roasted corn. Still some smoke at the finish and hints of coffee. The elusive scent presents in the flavor and continues to elude me. Perhaps it is the black malt alluded to on the label. Smoky finish and warm with alcohol. Very strong and powerful flavor. I would rate it B- on straight up flavor and all, but that is me.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,RoBotGod,3.41,The nose and the appearance were about the same all around. It smelled like black liquorish and looked like it as well. I didnt get a whole lot off the nose. It had a hot and just over the top malt aroma but not a whole lot past that. I pick up some tar smell. The tate for me as a little unbalanced. Most of what I taste is thick heavy malt and alcohol. This probably means I should have let this beer age a little but it was already a year and a half out. The finish is very sweet at first and then is wrapped up by dry bitter malt in the end. Didnt really pick up a whole lot of dark chocolate flavor.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,perfectkaos,4.32,"Picked this one up in the mix a six pack case that has been plagued by old stale beer. this one is from last winter, but hopefully should have aged well.  reviewed from notes  pours very black with a big foamy black head.  smell is all coffee and chocolate. a hint of alcohol  big malty taste with chocolate dominance. alcohol is distinguishable.  a great desert beer. Brooklyn's best.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,santa109,4.33,"Had this at L'autre-oeil in Gatineau, QC.  A: Poured pitch black with 1 finger of tan head into a snifter.  S: Wow, chocolate is very dominant on the nose. It's hard to get passed it.  T: The taste follows along the aromas with dark chocolate with perhaps a bit of coffee. There is also a touch of alcohol but this very pleasing. The chocolate taste lingers on forever but was also not overpowering.  M: Smooth and creamy with a medium body and an average amount of carbonation which suited the taste perfectly.  D: This stuff is dangerously good and addictive. Although the alcohol makes its presence felt, it didn't get in the way.  Overall, I was very impressed by this beer that I wanted to try for some time now. It was more subtle than other chocolate flavored stouts and it definately felt refined. This was the highlight of the evening.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TheDeuce,4.02,"Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout...  Appearance-Pitch black color, sticky fizz hits the sides of the glass, doesn't rise that high, but carbonation is still there.  Smell-A barrage of scents, chocolate, coffee, sweet malt, hops, alcohol notes, everything but the kitchen sink.  Taste/Mouthfeel- Lots of sweetness up front and then the flavors kick in, sticky malt adds a rich taste, chocolate flavor certainly dominates, decently smooth, probably would be even smoother if given more time to age.  Drinkability-great with the mint cake I paired it with, makes a nice night-cap drink. Very alcoholic, but that's expected for the style.  Overall-A very good RIS with great flavor, not necessarily out of this world and not my favorite, but it's a well done version of the style and certainly worth a try.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,HopDerek,3.65,"Winter 2007-08 edition  Pours a smooth black with 1 finger of creamy coffee tan head, good retention and lacing. Smells of dark fruits, chocolate, roasted malt, alcohol, and a touch of coffee. Tastes of vanilla, roasted malt, dark chocolate, dark fruits like cherries and rum soaked raisins, smoke, and alcohol in the finish. Full bodied with low carbonation. Smooth and creamy with lots of bitter sweetness, dark fruit notes, roastiness, and lots of alcohol presence. With there being more flavorful Russian Imperial Stouts that either mask the alcohol better or offer more in the flavor department, this is a RIS that I'll get if I see it and have no other desires offered, but I wouldn't race out to procure some.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,thickerfreakness,4.34,"Thanks to geuzelover for this 06/07 bottle. I imagine that puts it right above 1.5 years old now. Been looking forward to trying this beer for a while.  Pours with a quarter inch mocha colored head. This beer is as dark black as they come. The head quickly fades to a small layer of foam and leaves a little bit of lacing.  Wow, the smell reminds me of an 05 Stone IRS I had a month ago. Just an absolutely decadent dark chocolate smell that draws me in every time I bring it to my nose. A little bit of vanilla, dark fruits, and roasted malts in there as well. I really just can't stop smelling this RIS.  The taste is similar to the smell but a little more muted. I would love to try this with a year or two more on it to see if the chocolate in the nose translates more in to the taste. Its a nice vanilla, chocolate, roasty, dark fruit taste with a slightly bitter finish still.  The mouthfeel is nice but not anything spectacular. I enjoyed it.  This is a really easy drinking RIS. Hardly any alcohol was apparent for me in this aged version. I have only had this aged bottle but I imagine it would be good at any age. A winner for sure.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,gford217,3.91,12oz bottle poured into a snifter.  A: Pours pitch black with a big two-finger tan head that shows good retention and lacing. It's a very good looking brew.  S: The smell is pretty tame on this one with sweet roasted malts and chocolate dominating. There is also a definite licorice aroma there as well  T: Taste is mainly the big chocolately goodness with a hint of coffee and dark fruits. The roasted malts are in there as well and a faint hop bitterness in the finish.  M: Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with solid carbonation.  D: This is a very good chocolate stout which doesn't let the cocoa overpower the rest of the brew. Very nice.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BullCityB,3.48,"Pours a pitch black, with a thin coffeeish head that is almost immediately gone. It's alright to look at, but I could have used a little more head.  The aroma is a little skimpy. It's got some dark chocolate, a little alcohol, and a little sourness from the roasted malts. Once again, it's ok, but not all that great. I expected something much bigger.  The flavor is better than the aroma. It's rich and chocolaty - well named. There's a touch of the dark fruitiness I love about big dark ales like this one, but it's quickly beaten down on the finish by bitter chocolate and espresso, in conjunction with a little alcohol as it warms up. Not much in the way of hop flavor at all, but that's ok, I like my Imperial Stouts a little less hoppy than most. It's not really dry, too big bodied for that, but it does not leave the drinker with a lot of sweetness.  It's smooth in the mouth, not a lot of carbonation here. I guess that explains the lack of head retention. Somewhat creamy, though not nearly as much as, oddly enough, a beer like Duvel.  I'm only going to give this a three on the drinkability scale because, to me, this beer isn't balanced. If it were served with a rich chocolate dessert, the two would compliment each other beautifully, the sweetness of the dessert being tamed by the espresso like bitterness of the ale. But, on it's own, it lacks the intensity of dark fruit flavors that I love in this style. The roast character dominates this beer from start to finish.  It's odd - in three days I've reviewed two Imperial Stouts. The first, a Belgian example, was, if anything, too fruity and not roasty enough. This, on the other hand, is the opposite. A little more fruitiness would go a long way towards balancing this beer and making it a great one, other than a merely good one.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bbothen,3.97,"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter.  A - Pitch black with a dark cocoa color head. Tiny tight bubbles in the head.  S - Smells of sweet chocolate, coffee, faint smoke, & slight booze.  T - Chocolate of course. Along with a nice balance of coffee/espresso & sweet malt. Has a nice bitter hop bite in the finish as well.  M - Medium & smooth. More carbonated than I expected. I like it, very nice feeling brew.  D - Good. 10+%, you could share the bottle with someone over a desert, or even better, as a desert after a nice meal.  An enjoyable brew. Good nightcap or desert beer. Nice work Brooklyn.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Lexluthor33,3.95,"Pours pitch black with a decent head and a nice lace. The aroma is of alcohol,chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is malts,chocolate,coffee,some hops and some bitterness. The overall feel is syrupy,heavy and surprisingly creamy and smooth. I say surprisingly because it poured like oil and molasses. I envisioned it would stick to my throat. Well,it was carbonated correctly and the taste is pretty good as it warms.  Notes: Serve at cellar temp and this is a good beer to cellar so put a few away. I have to say that I have taken the same approach with this beer as with ""Monster"". Do not want to sip on them. The alcohol is just too strong. Some bottles taste burnt. I will wait.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Strix,3.93,"Almost black with a decent head with some retention.  Smell is pleasant, roasted malt, chocolate and alchohol, but somewhat muted.  Dark chocolate definitely present in the taste, along with roasted malt and a very strong bite of alcohol in the finish, maybe too strong. Depth of flavor on this is a bit lacking for me, seems like they could do more with it.  Mouthfeel nice and smooth, coats the mouth nicely.  Heavy, but pleasant. Not the best RIS I've had, but enjoyable.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,turbine2475,4.3,"Thanks to EGledhill for this trade: A - Pours opaque black that formed a dense mocha head that exploded out of the glass even after a careful pour. Head dissipated slowly leaving a spotty lace. S - Smells of nice roasted coffee and dark chocolate with a surprisingly grainy back end. T - The expected notes of chocolate and espresso but the grainy nature present in the nose gave way to a sweet taste that I can only quantify as a citrusy bourbon. M - Smooth with a decent amount of carbonation and an alcohol burn. D - Good beer.

45,680,Donnie2112,4.58,"appearance: very typical of an imperial stout just better with a gorgeous brown tinged head and lace  smell:sweet, rummy, raisins, vanilla and just a touch of perceivable chocolate  taste: Just a hint of vanillla, coffee, toast, caramel, there is something a bit like sour cherries or currants in there, it finishes with a dark roasted malt flavor. The over all flavor profile of the beer could be scene as similar to the flavor profile of a dark chocolate that is more lightly sweetened. I find no flaw in the taste of this beer.  mouthfeel: moderately carbonated, lacks the 15W50 consistency that I'm used to, but it isn't even close to watery and is in fact a bit oily. There is a a certain tannic astringency that almost reminds me of a particularly acidic cabernet sauvignon  drinkability: this stuff is really fun to drink but it's also rather filling. I think you could sit and analyze this shit all day long. That said it's filling and I don't see it playing well with others, except of course for specific deserts. So I'll knock just a bit off.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,cyrenaica,4.5,"12 oz bottle 10.6% ABV I tried this beer on February 29, 2008 at the 'Beer Bistro' in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured black with no head.

The flavour was malty, chocolatey, with a little bit of hoppy bitterness.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DIM,4.47,"note: This was th 05-06 vintage.  a: This was absolutely pitch blask. It poured with a small, dark mocha colored head.  s: Smells strongly of very dark chocolate. Also some aromas of dark fruits and nice touch of alcohol.  t: First impression is a strong taste of granular cocoa and dark chocolate. These are mildly bitter. There is some cherry flavor as well and a superbly warming alcohol finish.  m: Great texture and a fantastic bitter chocolate flavor that sticks around for a while.  d: This is an absolutely world class brew that can be had for the bargain price of around $40 per case.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,SchmoTerp,4.06,"A - Pours pitch black with thick, bumpy, tan head. This one dissipates somewhat slowly but looks very nice.  S - First smell of toffee, and figs. There is some chocolate, but not as much as you would expect given the name. Still...smells very nice and mellow.  T - Sweet, chocolatey, and with some distinct alcohol at the end...nice! Still, I think there could be a bit more to this one, even if it the taste were merely more pronounced.  M - Very smooth with just a tad of carbonation finishing off with the alcohol feel at the end.  D - All this combines to be one drinkable beer. This one makes for a great night cap on any evening. Will buy again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,GFSchwab,4.42,"Such an impressive drink, fits the profile of a BIG RIS to the point.  My favouriite aspect of this beer is by far the fact that there is no choclate in this at all, the flavor is derrived from the skill of alchemy and a brilliant interplay of malts.  The aroma is purley burnt oak, blackk choclate, and notes of a Robust, dark cigar.  That taste follow soon after, with the lingering bitterness of choclate bing presented by the choclate and roasted malts, most likely mingling with the english hops used in this guy (AWSOME).  This beer would easily be considered an excellent exapmle for what artisianship means in the world of craft brewing.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,sfoley333,4.2,"Poured from 12oz bottle labeled 06-07 into New Belgium snifter. Poured a black coffee color with a finger thick tan head. Smell is a mixture of herbal anisel, sweet dark fruit, coffee and a slight chocolate scent. Taste does contain a chocolate bitter profile but not overdone, also a coffee flavor with a medium roast profile. The full body and moderate to low carbonation really heightens the drinkabilty. Overall a pretty damn good stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jayrod20,3.85,"Pours an absolute onyx black with a generous two finger khaki colored head that leaves a thick lacing on the sides of the glass. This beer looks perfect, the creamy layer stays forever...what a great looking brew. First whiff, smell is pretty booze-like. Dark fruits follow of figs, raisins, dates, and grapes. Not as much chocolate in the nose as I was hoping, but there is some present. Taste begins with a big roasted barley flavor and a rich french roast coffee tingle. Smokey vanilla and wood with a hint of caramel malt as well. The chocolate finally makes an apperance in the dry aftertaste. Full, thick, and creamy mouthfeel with a subtle carbonation.

Mouthfeel: Huge full body, chewy with very little caronation feel, real subtle hoppiness on the edges.  Taste: Roasty and chocolately, mainly chocolately, bittersweet chocogoodness. That alone is impressive. It's fairly straightforward but what it focuses on is incredible. Mild and smooth roastiness on the finish.  Drinkability: Smooth and warming, this is a sip and savor stout.

Overall this beer is very enjoyable.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Patrick999,4.19,"Paired with dessert at the Brooklyn dinner. Poured into a flute an inky black with a little head that died down quickly.  Smell? Intoxicating and exceptional. Chocolate-y, with rosewatery alcohol fumes. Undercurrent of pure vanilla.  Taste - Wow, this is liquid dessert. Sweet, of course, but not overbearingly sweet. Big bitter dark chocolate presence as well as some hop; I can't really tell to what extent the dark chocolate and hops are contributing the pleasant bitterness. Has that vanilla-latte undercurrent noted in the smell, reminds me of a fresh, hot oak-aged Yeti.  Feel - Inky, but we are dealing with nearly 11% here. There's enough carbonation.  Drinkability - while it's *very* good, to me drinkability on this one is quite limited. It was quite enjoyable, especially paired with a fruity dessert, but finishing off even a flute glass of it was tough sledding. It's just that big and bold; to me it very nearly crosses into DFH World Wide Stout terrirory.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MICAMD,4.82,"This is a review from the 06-07 bottling.  A-Very black, with just the slightest bit of light making its way through the edges when held to a light. The head is small and orange, but creamy looking with good retention. For close to 11% this is outstanding.  S- Wow, this has aged nicely. The chocolate aromas really come out along with some coffee and licorice and a dark fruit complex. Absolutely wonderful.  T- A massive amount of complexity without being overbearing. This is very tasty and complex. The alcohol is very well hidden, with only a slight warming aspect after the swallow. Time has done this wonders.  M- Very smooth, but maybe just a bit thin. The alcohol is still hidden to an amazing degree.  D- This is an absolutely amazing beer. Age has done this some good. This could quite possibly be the best value in the beer world.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MiScusi,4.38,"This is the winter 07-08 release. Pours the standard stout black color with no light penetrating at all. Big brown head forms very easily and is regenerated quite well upon swirling. I learned to not drink this cold. As it warmed up the big roastiness and chocolate malt character came out very nice. The chocolate was not sweet but roasty, bitter... all barley. I wouldn't even want to put this in the category of a ""chocolate beer"" especially compared to many of the newer sweet chocolate beers that are coming out now, but just a plain old Russian Imperial Stout this is one great beer, maybe one of the top 2 RIS's I've had.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

A: Very dark, black, with a thin light brown head reducing eventually to thick ring of bubbles around the glass and uneven bubbles.  S: Alcohol is the first thing that assaults the nostrils followed by some intense chocolate and coffee malt flavors. There is a sort of sweet smell given off as well, something like dates or figs. The overall impression is rather complex and interesting.  T: The smooth texture is foremost as the slippery fluid slides over the tongue and washes the palate with intense mocha flavors that are punctuated by the sharp alcohol bite. The finish is very long and with a bitter coffee linger and some significant warmth as gravity pulls it down.  M&D: The mouthfeel is absolutely silky and heavy at the same time. Tiny and light carbonation aids in bringing out the creaminess of this brew. Very warming. Very smooth. Very good.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jmalex,4.25,"This winter's release. It's probably about time to start getting into the half case I bought.  APPEARANCE: Pours inky black into my Delirium tulip. The head is only a small surface coating of latte and cream brown bubbles and immediately drops to a thin collar with a few rogue bubbles across the beer.  SMELL: Now this is a big time imperial stout. The aromas run the entire gamut from caramel to chocolate to massive amount of roast coffee with some dark fruits and licorice mixed in. The one other thing that's plainly apparent is alcohol.  TASTE: Far less roasty in the mouth (though some coffee flavors still shine through), but chocolate and dark fruits are definitely still there. Shockingly, the alcohol is nowhere to be found.  MOUTHFEEL: Carbonation is nicely low, but the body seems a tad thin, though it's really just splitting hairs at this point.  DRINKABILITY: Definitely drinks far easier than its 10.6% ABV would indicate. And I imagine it'll only get better with age.  Sure, this one has a few months on it already, but this is one heck of a beer, and it'll be drinking well for a while to come.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

It was black - that had head that was so offset by the beer, and the head hung around. The alcohol volume caught me by surprise, I knew I was in for quite a treat. The chocolate flavoring was faint and bold all at once. The alcohol aftertaste was there but didn't leave as much of an impression as the initial taste. I think I may become a stout fan!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

And yes, the pour cranks out a blackie beer with a tan marshmallow head. Top notch.  This is all about stout - big, black and full of roasted malts. Chocolate is there, but subtle and sneaky in the background. Herbal hops balance out the sweet maltiness. Even a pop of anise - com'on, this is RIS in a sheep skin! Edit - well, duh, see it's listed as such on BA.  Wow, great beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ATPete,4.2,"Pours opaque black with a small brown head. Smells of toasted chocolate malts with hints of coffee. Smooth and creamy, chocolate does not over power this beer, for there is in fact no chocolate used in the brewing process. A blending of (i believe) 6 different malts creates the subtle chocolate taste and aroma. This is a very balanced brew. Nice heavy mouth feel but by no means 'thick' with a pleasant roasty lingering finish. Watch that 10.6 ABV though because these babies are dangerously drinkable!  My most recent serving of Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout was at a beer dinner hosted by none other than Garrett Oliver himself. The Black Chocolate Stout was paired with a slice of chocolate layer cake at the end of the 6 course meal. Excellent dinner, excellent beers!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,hyland24,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  This beer poured a creamy pitch black with absolutely no light shining through. It formed a 1 inch dark brown creamy head and left sticky brown lacing throughout the glass that stayed put.  The smell is strong with an initial blast of alcohol followed by a clear chocolate, roast malt combination followed by a heavy smoke finish.  The taste is awesome. The initial taste also starting with alcohol and roasted malt but allowing the smoke too creep up along with hints or espresso and coffee grinds. The alcohol taste stays true throughout due to the 10.6 ABV but does not overpower the sweet smoke and malt.  The mouthfeel is silky smooth, creamy and slightly thick. It leaves a sticky film all over the inside of the mouth and a warm alcohol feeling following the swallow. The beer is so sticky and sweet it leaves your lips feeling like you just drank hot chocolate(with a shot of whiskey). I highly recommend this beer to all but its definitely too strong to pound.

45,680,Pencible,4.52,"This imperial stout poured pitch black with a little bit of dark tan head. It smelled like burnt chocolate malt mixed with robust coffee. It tasted like milk chocolate and bitter coffee blended with earthy malt and a slight alcohol taste. It was very thick with no carbonation and a bitter coffee aftertaste. Overall this was a very powerful but balanced beer, so it was strong but very drinkable, just the way an imperial stout should be.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,indiapaleale,4.03,"It pours black, dark black. Its thick, rich and black. I don't think light could get though this, it reminds me of crude oil. The head on this clings tightly to the side of the glass and is the color of espresso foam. This one also has the oily look on top of a high octane shot of coffee.  First whiff is alcohol but quickly followed malty sweetness, chocolate, licorice and very, very cooked, sweet apples. You can really really tell that this is a high alcohol beer, its kind of hard to disguise a beer thats almost 22 proof!  Tastes amazing. I can't imagine how much malt goes into this beer. How do you get such a dark beer that is so rich in taste and high in alcohol without dumping an absolutely ridiculous amount of malt into the mash. Wow!  After lots of small sips the head of this beer is still present. I love that. Each taste of this beer really shows its complexity. Its a strong bitter chocolate taste followed by an alcohol aftertaste one second and then some black coffee. Its incredible how much is packed into each little mouthful.  This is NOT some weak ""chocolate-flavored"" stout. This is a hardcore, pitch black, alcohol-enraged tribute to the Czar!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DHGranstrand,4.43,"Special thanks to RblWthACoz for the Beers!!  Pours black with excellent dense creamy head. Great retention with nice lacing.  Nice aroma of malt, licorice and alcohol.  Exceptional balance for a 10.6% alcohol!! Molasses & licorice up front with alcohol & bitter chocolate finish.  If you are a brewer and looking for mouthfeel, try to imitate this beer. Exceptional mouthfeel!! Very smooth and velvety. Did I say exceptional?? Exquisite is more like it!  I am not sure how many of these I could drink but I'm sure a six-pack would go down great!!  Excellent!! I love this beer.  Thanks again to RblWthACoz for the excellent trade!!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MerkinMan,4,"A: BLACK. Thin brown head. Elegant bottle.  S: Faint hop aroma. Alcohol notes. Not much malty smell  T: Kaboom! A rich malty stout with some chocolate tones along with an almost leathery aftertaste (not bad leathery, mind you). This is very complex. More aroma hops would be nice, but overall a nice tasting beer.  MF: Nice rich body that thins out on the tongue  D: A very drinkable stout. I will buy more.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Tolann,4.12,Thanks wasach for the trade on this one! Already I can tell I'm going to enjoy it! I hope my high expectations don't let me down.  A - Very dark black/brown in color. Seems opaque. Pours like almost like motor oil and looks kinda syrupy. I poured real slow and didn't get much head on it. The little bit I did see was more of a brownish foam and far from white. It's what I'd expect of an RIS.  S - I'm getting more chocolate than roast. It's not overly sweet like the syrupy appearance may lead you to think. I think more of a semi-sweet chocolate rather than a dark chocolate or milk chocolate.  T - I'm almost afraid to taste it. It took me too long to finally open. I don't want it to be gone. What if my nose is too stuffy and I don't get all it has to give? OK... Wow. Not too sweet super good RIS. Chocolate I think is more in the smell than the taste. Little bit of sharpness on the sides of my tongue. More roasts come out now in the taste as well. There's a bitterness at the back of my tongue I don't know how to describe.  M - Little bit of carbonation bite; I like that. Booze kinda hangs and warms your breath. Little dryness in the aftertaste. Medium body. Taste hangs and warms the back of your mouth and your throat.  D - The alcohol feel will slow drinking this down. Don't know I could have more than 1 or 2 of these on a wild nite (note the ABV and you'd need a 'wild nite' to have more than 1).,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,callmemickey,4.15,A: Deep brown-black body with a moderate tan head.. long lasting head.. good carbonation.  S: Yumm.. chocolate! lots of rich chocolate powering through..  T: Chocolate malts clearly dominate.. nice balance with the hops.. very sweet... slightly bitter finish.  M: Smooth and creamy. Fiull bodied.  D: Smooth and sweet. Heavyness and sweetness hold back the repeatability of the beer.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bilyboy65,4.62,"This was poured into a pilsner style glass.  A: Poured smoothly only causing a thin 1 finger width head that was a dark tan color. It The head seemed to remain for the entire glass. The carbonation could be scene dancing in the head. The beer was almost a black color. Could not see through it.  S: Instantly from the pour the chocolate aroma hits your nose. Smells very sweet.  T: The chocolate malts come together nicely to achieve almost perfect balance. Causing the beer to be not to sweet. The chocolate malts are complimented nicely by the hinting of hops to bring out the taste. The only drawback on the taste was a kinda bitter after taste. It isn't strong, but enough to taint the ending.  M: Very smooth to the tongue. Not a lot of carbonation. Actually seems to have a lot more characteristics of a nitro beer.  D: This is very sweet. Goes down very easy. Some may find this beer hard to drink more then a few because of how sweet it is.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JDV,4,"Bottle courtesy of davehoward Black, oily pour with a nice brown head that lasts for a bit. Smell is nicely rich, dark roastiness, and some dark chocolate as well. Alcohol is well hidden in the nose, I thought. Taste is dark roast, and a noticeable amount of acidity and light tartness giving it a uniqueness from other Imperial Stouts. A bit of a prickly carbonated mouthfeel at first, which subsides later. Slightly thick mouthfeel, with a dry dark chocolate finish. Just a hint warming. Ever so slightly tart, dark chocolate flavor as it warms. Overall a really good imperial stout that I would like to try again, especially aged to see how it differs. Thanks a lot for the bottle, Dave!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Lothar666,4.37,"A- A very cautious pour kinda screwed this one up for me- I have seen better pours yield much better results with this beer as far as head is concerned. Other aspects still did not disapoint.Body was midnight black and let no light shine through- head was thin and dark brown and creamy but receeded quickly, leaving a sticky coffee colored lacing on the sides of my goblet.  S- Smell is dark roasted malts, bitter bakers chocolate and a hint of espresso, backed by powerful hops and the sweet aroma of strong alcohol.  T- Dark roasted malts, dark rich bitter chocolate and black coffee. Well balanced by uber hoppiness like an imperial stout should be, the aftertaste is all bitter dark bakers chocoalte and roasted coffee acidity. Very complex for an RIS. Lovely.  M- Rich, full bodied, smooth and creamy with a slight acidic touch from the strong coffee and the alcohol. As is always the case in a good imperial stout, this one coats the tongue and throat, leaving a slick, oily feeling in the mouth long after the initial sip.  D- So smooth and delicious that the strong ABV does not hurt the drinkability at all, requiring caution lest intoxication sneak up on you after only a couple. The powerful delicious flavors are still something that demands this beer be a slow sipper lest they go to waste, but each sip leaves the mouth craving another.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Goliath,4.23,"This was an extra in my first trade with nflmvp. Thanks Steve, it was great.  Pours black and completely opaque with two fingers of rich mocha colored head sitting on top of the glass. The head slowly receeds to leave a thin layer around the glass and a thin coating on top of the beer.  The aroma of this beer is fairly strong with chocolate taking the lead. Notes of roasted malt and a slight bitterness are also present, but a strong alcohol scent leads the more subtle flavors.  The taste is big. Roasted malt and bitter dark chocolate steal the show to be followed by a slight bit of alcohol. This beer is really quite delicious.  Mouthfeel is full and fairly thick with an adequate level of carbonation for the style. This carbonation mellows through the experience to eventually create a warm, thick, still stout.  Drinkability is fairly low in terms of strength of alcohol and amount of flavor. However I've rated drinkability as good due to the fact that it's smooth drinking, and the alcohol I've noted does not interupt the drinking experience. Quite nice.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DavidSeanNJ,4.15,"Picked up a single bottle for 1.99...  12 oz. bottle poured into a chalice...  A- Thick black opaque liquid. A nice tan head emerges after the pour leaving an incredible amount of lacing on my glass.  S- Smell was of chocolate, oak, and some vanilla. Some hops present in the nose as well.  T- Taste was very bitter. Hops, roasted malts of all types and flavors- chocolates, cocoa, coffee, and others. This is not for the faint at heart.  M- Mouthfeel was harsh and left a burning sensation for the duration of the entire consumption. Sticky and thick a long the tongue and lips.  D- This beer is a great treat with a dessert. Do not drink more of two of these in a sitting unless you plan on going to sleep. Highly tasty.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,argock,4.18,"Served on-tap in a clear pint glass  A: Black and beautiful with small-to-medium tan head and some lacing. Not bad on the head and lace for 10.5% ABV.  S: Mostly bittersweet chocolate domination with a bit of burnt coffee grounds in there too.  T: Loads of chocolatey goodness with some faint coffee and dark fruit (Raisinette?) touches and quick jab of hops bitterness to smooth everything out. While there's a lot of chocolatey goodness, there's quite a bit more going on too.  M: Very smooth without feeling overly syrupy. Good balance of sweetness and dryness in this big-bodied brew.  D: Very drinkable because of the mix of sweetness, fruitiness, hops bitterness, and smoothness, but I would love to try this in the bottle owing to the service of this one being way too cold.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,oconman,3.91,"Pours like a fine vintage used motor oil (no really that's a good thing), black and just about opaque. Fine dark bubbles, a good solid head the color of milk chocolate that has good staying power. The aroma is mostly roast malt and some chocolate, with very little hop, and that tannic aroma like a sherry.  The flavor is intense, of course, but the strong alcohol isn't evident, except the warming power is there as the sip is swallowed. Body is slightly thin for so much flavor. The roasty, coffee and malty flavor, with strong hop bitterness to balance, isn't so much chocolate except in the lingering soft texture on the tongue. One of the best chocolate/coffee stouts I've had, but actually not the very best.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,andrewt960,2.86,"Let me start off by saying I am one of many who didn't fall in love with this beer. Perhaps it was the hype. I read so many positive posts and talked to my beer guy, thought it was going to be gold in a bottle. A- Poured a dark black, with a nice head that faded quickly. The head was chocolate brown in color that had minimal lacing. I was very excited to taste based on looks. S- Smelled of hazy chocolate in the distance, however more roasted malts, and of alcohol. T- The taste was a bit surprising in the sense that it had a lot less chocolate that I had anticipated. I wasn't expecting chocolate milk, but it was totally over powered by the strong alcoholic smell. M- It wasn't bad in the mouth, but the alcohol was too strong. Laced the mouth and stuck around in the throat. D- I think if I was more into sipping, which this beer is intended for, it may be nicer. I didn't chug it, but I may have sipped too frequently to let my pallet adjust. I have 5 more to try and get it right. Overall, I think I'll stick with the hoppy kick that I've been on, and leave this behind.  Footnote- The second was nicer, a klittle more gentle, and enjoyed a little more.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jph424,3.41,"Bought as part of a $7.99 mix a six at Mac's.  A - Black black with a small light brown head  S - Different than I expected. Cherry, caramel, and alcohol.  T - I taste sour cherries, some brown sugary sweetness, alcohol, and some really dark chocolate hints.  M - Terrific! Full bodied silky smooth with light carbonation.  D - A terrific sipper but certainly not a beer to drink all night.  I am going to pick up another and lay it down for a year or so as this one is really fresh and I think this could use a little aging.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,aromatorio,3.95,"Received as an extra in a trade. Unfortunately, not sure if it's from beerhandy or markgugs, because I got both boxes at the same time... Thanks either way!  This beer pours oily black. Not syrupy. The head is probably the darkest mocha color I've encountered so far. It's is tight on the bottom but fluffier at the top. Fades away after a minute, lacing floats on for another minute or two more. Taste is shockingly chocolate. I have some 85% cacao dark chocolate, and this tastes almost identical. The chocolate flavors are so overwhelming that I can barely discern any malt underneath, and I'm too blown away to note any hops. Mouthfeel is smooth, but like the pour, thinner than I thought. Where's the alcohol? Drinkable? Sure, it goes down well, but for me you must partake of chocolate in moderation.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

M/D: an altogether very good beer, the chocolate label at least for me was a bit overstated but regardless i really enjoyed the beer, and maybe i just could not detect the chocolate malts or whatever it was",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,PhxHorn,3.95,"Pours a very dark opaque brown, not a lot of head but what there is hangs in there. Smells of coffee and chocolate. Taste is a nice blend of chocolate, coffee, roasted nuts, malt, with hops in the background. No single flavor sticks out at you, and in fact the flavor could have been a bit more intense, but the coffee was a bit more pronounced than the chocolate. Could have use a wee bit more carbonation, maybe. Overall, nice and smooth, very drinkable.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,NCSUdo,3.96,"12 oz bottle, 2007 version  A: Pours a very dark black under an inch worth of brown head. Spotty lace and good retention. Very good looking beer.  S: Smells of a certain sweet creaminess, a little bit of chocolate and a little nutty. I'm not getting a lot of roast character and the chocolate that is there is not very big.  T: Again, I'm getting more of a creamy character with some roasted malt and chocolate in the back. No hint of alcohol except for the maybe the slightest warmth. A medium sort of chocolate lingers around in the mouth.  M/D: Mouthfeel is really nice. Full bodied, velvety and smooth, carbonation is light to medium. Drinkability is OK on this one, 10.60% takes away from it obviously, but it's still easy drinking.  I think I had a bottle from the same 6 pack maybe 4 months ago.

45,680,Douglas14,4.7,"Wow. wow.  This beer is absolutely incredible. I have been drinking the BCS's over the past couple of months, whenever I could find them (pretty easy to come by in Manhattan) and promised myself to save the last BCS for this review.  It pours a shiny, deep, dark black color with a thick tan head that resides pretty soon and leaves little lacing. It smells of sweet dark fruits, malted barely, coffee, caramel, and chocolate...not just one type but many different varieties of chocolate. The taste is more roasted, with malts, coffee, dark fruits, oak and chocolate coming through - there is burnt chocolate, dark bitter chocolate, and even chocolate syrup. Hardly any hops noticeable over the intense sweetness of this beer. It has a silky yet thick body with a perfectly balanced amount of carbonation.  Truly one of the best Russian Imperial Stouts...it saddens me knowing that if I am convinced this is the last BCS I can find that I will have to wait until next year for another.  Please do yourself a favor and buy a sh*t load of this beer and drink it (not all at once, obviously)...you will thank me.

45,680,JMH_,3.88,"The 07-08 version pours a dark as hell, basically black colour with a booming tan head that falls over the glass a bit from my overly harsh pour. It dissolves to a medium sized lace and leaves a good amount of residue on the glass.  The aroma is a mix of slightly roasted malt, bitter chocolate, dark fruit, a bit of coffee and a heavier than expected dose of alcohol.  Flavour is quite similar to the aroma: dark fruit leads the way in each sip before blending with a more subtle chocolate flavour. Alcohol blends in mid way and sticks with you for through the finish of each sip. Granted this is a high alcohol beer, but the alcohol presence could have been hidden a bit more for my liking. It just cuts into the other flavours a bit too much. Mouthfeel is full bodied and, once again because of the alcohol, is a bit too ""hot"" at times.  This is a very good beer that's on the cusp of top tier for the style but just falls a touch short here and there in my opinion. I'd like to try it after it's mellowed a bit with some aging. Still, it's a nice on to try as is.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,AleDrinkToThat,4.3,"Appearance: Opaque, very nearly black hue, with a one finger tan head that stays to the end.  Smell: Roasted chocolate and caramel malts.  Taste: Roasted cocoa, raisin, licorice all hit in rapid succession, with a low alcohol bite and the hops are barely present.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and tart. The roasted malt and alcohol leave a dry finish.  Drinkability: Wonderful RIS. Brooklyn's always been a solid brewery as far as I'm concerned, and this is one of their more excellent selections. Too much will land you in oblivion, but it's a great ride.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,goochpunch,4.43,"07-08 bottling.  This is one of the best looking stouts I've ever seen. Absolutely opaque black with a viscous body. The head is really thick, especially considering the style, and has a cocoa powder hue. Leaves some thick lacing which is, at parts, scattered and decorative, and at others, totally solid. Aroma is pretty heavy on the dried fruits and chocolate, which I love together. Some coffee helps to support this along with some apropos alcohol. Little bit of soft earthy hops in the background. As with the aroma, the flavor is big on chocolate, of course, and raisins, reminding me of chocolate-covered raisins, naturally. There is also some smooth tobacco interwoven here, which reminds me of some more European-leaning stouts. The roastiness is not that pronounced, but works as an accent. Hops are a little harder to find in the flavor, but they lend some hints of earth and herbs somewhere close to the finish. Finishes sweet. I find that this has a wonderful balance of sweetness, alcohol warmth, and mild lactic acidity from the black malt. Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and smooth as velvet (or velour). Drinkability is overall pretty solid, but the sweetness can put the brakes on having more than one of these.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,blackheartbilly,4.37,"Decided to try it, poured a 12 OZ into a pint glass...gorgeous, sipping it as I write the review.  A: Very dark with a mocha colored head, 1 inch that quickly gave way to a tiny head.  S: Heavy roasted coffee followed with a heavy alcohol presence, didn't notice too much chocolate. Heavy malt, no hops what so ever.  T: Like a mix of Baker's chocolate, dark chocolate, with a coffee aftertaste. In that aftertaste there is the alcohol, which I think with this brew is like 10%, pretty heavy. Definitely a ""dessert"" beer. The alcohol is heavy but not in the same sense that it is in say, an Imperial Stout...  M: Extremely rich, like eating a cheesecake with fudge. Reminds me of a dessert mixed drink, heavy in alcohol and heavy in chocolate.  D: I think I will have these one at a time. Way to much alcohol to have ""a few."" Enjoy this brew after a meal, and be careful this beer will sneek up on you. An alcoholic dessert...",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

This has a great smoothness on the tongue. This is a great texture, however personally, I think (especially with the abv) this could stand just a little more ""chew"".  The taste is a very balanced chocolate, nothing overpowering here, though more chocolate than some others who claim it in their name.  Goes down great, even with the potency, I could take down 3 pretty easily, without getting bored.

A: It poured a black body with a moderate dark chocolate head that receded quickly to a few bubbles on the surface and a ring around the collar. There was a decent lacing with thin lags that did not last long.  S: It emitted massive roasted and smokey malts, as well as chocolate and coffee.  T: Nice blend of several chocolate flavors including bakers, mike, and burnt. The roasted sweet dark malts add to the character and the gentile coffee bite lingers in the background; only coming to the front in the aftertaste. It is supprisingly not a clean a finish as I expected but more reminicent of a warm hot chocolate flavor that lingers after each sip. The alcohol is well hidden, warming rather than intruding on the experience.  M: It was full bodied but smooth, rich and creamy. It gives off a blend of flavors that entertain all areas of the mouth but does not finish as clean as I expected. Nice warm, sticky sweet finish.

Some dry bittering hops in the finish. Big roasted coffee, burnt chocolate, dark licorice and sherry all combine in a beautiful example and complexity of flavors in this well rounded, balanced and full bodied beer.

Strong flavor, as to be expected. You definitely get the alcohol bite, but it doesn't overpower the chocolatey smoothness. I get a bit of coffee bitterness and malty caramel and some more raisin on the tongue as well.

45,680,esv,4.6,"12 Fluid oz 10.6 ABV. Served to cold. From a cold fridge in a cold house. Last month's heating bill, $300.  Thick brown head off of a stiff pour into an over-sized snifter. Would you believe it is black? Darker than a black steer's tuchus on a moonless prairie night. The bulk of the head dissipated quickly with minimal lacing but the head was present till the end.  Raisins, ripe plums and alcohol in the nose. Wafts of chocolate becoming far stronger as the beer warmed.  Cigars, high alcohol and candy-sweetness hit the taste buds. Bitter chocolate and burnt malts rest squarely on the tongue. I can taste that crusty brown sweetness from a raisin and from the corner of the raisin box. The symphony of flavors round out nicely as the beer warms.  A swallow washes over your tongue and the mouthfeel continues to swell like a tsunami over the higher ground. You can't understand where it's all coming from and why it doesn't recede. Sticky, but not too, considering its royal lineage.  i love It.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,steelcutoats,5,"This is by far my most favorite stout of all time. I remember the first night I tried it, it was love at first sip. I have since gone through two cases of it this winter and am cellaring a 6 pack for enjoyment and comparison next season.  Truly an epic beer to behold. It poured into my RIEDEL crystal snifter a perfect 10 waiting for tasting. There was a thick mocha head that slowly dissolved. The nose was very complex with notes of coffee, chocolate and toffee. The taste was outstanding, not overpowering, but a sublime chocolate and malty mix. Often when I tell people about this beer I try to compare to eating a handful of chocolate covered espresso beans. It's just that damn good. I want to try and mix his stout with a cherry or raspberry lambic and see how it turns out.  After it's all said and done, I would recommend this beer to anyone who wants to try a stout but is too afraid too. It is not overpowering at 10.6 % ABV, but a very mellow and warming liquid, worthy of a nightcap. Definitely a keeper!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,markgugs,4.72,"2006/07 vintage, poured from 12oz. bottle into a tulip snifter (consumed 2/12/08)  A: If you were submerged in a vat of this beer, I imagine it'd be akin to being blind, that's how dark this is. Pours like motor oil, with slight ruby edges, just about 100% opaque. A lovely 2-finger dark beige head rises up and begins to immediately leave decent lacing.  S: Smells like a steaming cup of hot chocolate, only it's cold. I detect sweet fig newtons, some roasted breads, plums & dates, and of course, rich chocolate and cocoa! As it warms, it takes on some minor sherry-like aromas as well.  T/M: Bam! Rich, rich chocolate and cocoa right up front, I'm talking huge, chunky chocolate flavors, rich like truffles. The roasted malts are right in your face, and as the beer warms, the dark fruits - raspberries & cherries mostly - begin to develop. An intoxicating bittersweet cocoa finishes things up. This beer is thick, viscous and chewy, with just the right amount of carbonation, just like a brilliant RIS should be.  D: This beer is awesome x 1,000. It's actually too easy to drink, a dangerous sign given the 10+% ABV. Go easy (but get some)!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BeerLover729,4.11,"A: Black as the darkest night with a brown not tan, dark brown, head.  S: The smell is just mildly aromatic like a subtle dark chocolate with mildly detectable roasted barley notes.  T: Mmmm. Dark chocolate, with smooth not bitter or sharp coffee undertones. Complex but smooth and easy malt profile.  M: This beer is silky smooth and velvety soft with light but apparent carbonations and a heavy but not over powering body.  D: A little on the sweet side, but with the right pairings it goes down quite nicely. Great after dinner drink.  Notes: This beer is absolutely sensational in the right context. I love it a lot. Mine's from winter 07/08. Yum.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ajr24,4.23,"Bottle from the Foodery into the pint glass... Pours deep and opaque black with a medium dark tan head that'll shrink into a dark tan skin over the beer that leaves good lacing. Smells like a RIS, that's for sure- coffee, caramel, robust roasted malts. Tastes like dark chocolate, toffee and then the roasted malts hit. Mouthfeel is smooth, velvety, even with the alcohol presence. I really wish I had bought more than one of these.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Absumaster,3.7,"Thanks to northyorksammy for this beer. Appearance is deep black with an off-white small head.  Smell is roasted with coffee and pure chocolate. The roasted notes are subtle and the beer smells sweet.  Taste is roasted with notes of chocolate and coffee, followed by a light molasses taste. The alcohol is quite strong and balances the sweetness. Bitterness is a combination of maltbitterness and hops. No real hop aroma in the beer though. I am not sure I really really like this beer. It isn't really complex. Not that it is bad, but it doesn't stick out.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Gmann,4.32,"Pours a jet black color with an average brown head that dissipated into a light ring around the glass. The smell is of big roasted and chocolate malt, rubbing alcohol, damp wood, and vanilla. The taste starts off with pruney/wine grape flavors, followed by a wave of alcohol and a roasty chocolate. A nice procession of flavors that blend very well. Not much in the way of hop flavor. The feel is well bodied, fizzy yet has a creamy texture, and finishes slightly sticky and bitter with a small alcohol burn. A very good RIS. You can notice the alcohol but the flavors come around to mask it fairly well. I like that it comes in 6 packs.  Ages very well, drinkability goes up.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,nasty15108,4.15,"I have been drinking Brooklyn Beers for ages, but for some reason this one always escaped me. I have always been happy with the quality of Brooklyns brews and after researching Imperial Stouts I figured I had to give it a shot. I got myself a sixpack of Winter 07-08 bottles and I have to say I was impressed. I like stout and I guess I drink it pretty regularly (usually opting for Young's Chocolate, Smith's Oatmeal or old reliable Guinness). The look, smell and taste of the Brooklyn Chocolate Stout were top notch. I drank it from a small brandy snifter (which I highly recommend)and I was was totally impressed. This is not a brew to be swilled while watching the game, (it is filling and strong) but to be enjoyed in small quantities, much like a fine brandy/cognac. I recommend it with dessert or by itself with a nice cigar.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,gwong,4.37,"Winter 07-08 Release  A: Pours jet black with a thick, creamy brown-tan head. Significant lacing remains on the glass.  S: Roasted malts and chocolate pleasantly fill the nose.  T: Sweet, roasted chocolate dominate.  M: Smooth and creamy when it hits the tongue with a nice smooth, silky finish.  D: Its high ABV does not lend itself normally to high drinkability but it just tastes so darn good! Ok, maybe one more...",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,CrellMoset,4.18,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, marked Winter 07-08, into a tulip glass.  Appearance is thick, dark, and black. No light penetrates this brew, which pours with a small, creamy brown head that dissipates rather quickly and minor, pale brown lacing that rains down the sides of the glass.  Smell is primarily of alcohol, but the roasted and sweet malts do come through in the background. Chocolate, caramel/toffee, hints of coffee (although this could just be the roasted overtones).  Taste is where this beer really shines. The alcohol is very warming, and it's definitely prevalent in the flavor profile, but it's balanced well with the roasted malts. No bitterness, and the roasted flavors become stronger as the beer warms (as would be expected). In fact, so does the alcohol. The entire beer just becomes more intense as it warms. Very tasty.  Mouthfeel is thick, rich, creamy, and smooth. Flows all over the palette, with mild carbonation that's perfectly balanced with the texture. Exceptional.  Drinkability is good, but the alcohol definitely isn't hidden. An above-average imperial stout, an exceptional warming seasonal, and one of the better beers from Brooklyn.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,SierraGS,4.2,"I was SO happy when I wandered into Alibi's (Carlisle, PA) for an after-work treat and found this on tap! It was served in a 16 oz glass with a creamy tan head.  The beverage itself was pitch black and had a wonderful aroma of slightly over baked chocolate cake. The flavor, however, imparted more of a burning alcohol bite on the tongue than the smooth, sweet chocolate I was anticipating (at over 10%, I should have expected that, but the aroma threw me off.) It was more like a warming liquor than the crisp, hoppy beers I usually favor, but I really enjoyed every sip.  This certainly isn't a thin beer, but it wasn't so thick to be described as chewy or coating. The flavor perfectly filled my mouth and lingered on for some time, as did the lacing on the glass - from top to bottom, remnants of the caramel head lined the sides.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,hwwty4,4.7,"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Chimay chalice. Poured a jet black liquid. This beer lets no light through. Jet black, with no head, and no lacing. Aroma is molasses and coffee with a bit of toffee. Taste is dark chocolate up front with coffee, dark fruits, molasses, vanilla and finishes with bakers chocolate. What I was amazed with is it hides the 11% alcohol better than any RIS I've drank to this point. Mouthfeel is great, full with an oily coating the lets your mouth soak in the beerdom. I will probably try to get a bottle of this in every trade I do with someone from NY. Great beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,largadeer,4,"Appearance - Black with a toffee-colored cap of thick foam. The head retains fairly well, eventually dissipating into a crown.  Smell - Molasses and caramel, a bit of fresh roasted coffee and cocoa. Pleasant.  Taste & mouthfeel - Full-bodied and bittersweet. The flavor shifts between rich, creamy dark chocolate and espresso. Wonderful complexity. The finish is a combination of toffee-like sweetness and bitter burnt bread, with the toffee flavors ultimately lasting a bit longer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,birchstick,4.08,"This poured black opaque into my glass, with a small dark brown head. I could smell it as soon as I cracked open the bottle, obviously there were chocolate tones, with some toffee, coffee, and malts as well. It tasted much like it smelled. Very sweet upfront, with a nice blend of chocolate and and coffee at the end. The alcohol was very noticeable as it went down and warmed me instantly.  Overall, this was a very good stout and was very glad I got to try it. It was even more enjoyable after coming in from the snow.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,imaguitargod,4.53,"I tried the 20707-08 batch and I am quite impressed. It reminds me of Bison Chocolate Stout which is the best chocolate stout I've had to date and this beer falls into my #2 spot. Dark black in color with a very distinct, real chocolate taste upfront. A little bit bubbly on the tongue with a smooth aftertaste.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Hoagie1973,4.25,"This one was recommended to me by kbnooshay.  Pours almost completely opaque black with barely perceptible reddish-brown edges. Thick creamy tan head, good retention and sticky lacing all the way to the bottom.  Mouthfeel is very creamy with extremely light carbonation.  Robust roasted chocolate malt flavor; nicely hopped, but not overpowering like some Imperial Stouts. Insane ABV is well blended for the most part, but can be a touch harsh at times. Not for the faint of heart. Leaves a nice warming sensation in the back of the throat and down the esophagus. Perfect beer for cold Rochester Winter evenings.  This one's worth every penny. Looking forward to cellaring a few bottles.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jbphoto88,4.83,"Super black beer with a small tan head that peaks out of the lagoon of dark liquor. That me trying to be poetic but basically saying its a pretty brew. Smells of sweet chocolate malts, dark fruit and a little molasses. Delicious but a little light for my preference. Taste is up there with some of my favorite beers. There is a complex layer of flavors that starts with roasted and chocolate malts. Followed by a nice hop bite with a dark fruit chaser and then... sweet Jesus, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. The after taste is all chocolate and it lingers forever on your tongue and the sides of your mouth. There is also a nice warming of the pallet from the higher ABV, and it stays with your sip all the way down to your stomach. I think I am in love. I doubt I can wait and cellar this beer even though I know it will be even better after some age.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jobyone,3.94,Tasted with 5 other Imperial Stouts. Pours black with creamy light brown head. The aroma is sweet caramel and some chocolate. The taste has definate notes of Alcohol along with the sweetness. Not much bitterness. Definately the sweetest stout of the night.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,phishgator,3.35,"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Almost black with a brown head. The head dissipates to leave a thin film around the glass edge. The aroma is of dark bitter choclate and a slight hint of alcohol. The taste is a bitter and astringent. Too much bitter chooclate and hops? The roasted coffee/toasted malts never come through. The alcohol is high so after one you can feel the warmth. I still try it ever year, but not my favorite big stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Kegatron,4.32,"12oz bottle into a Duvel Tulip.  Pours a dark black with a little over a finger width of creamy tan head. This retains into a fantastic looking creamy layer that left thick swathes of lace all over the sides of the glass. The aroma is lush is dark chocolate, coffee, burnt bitterness, fresh hops, citrus, and a little heat.  The taste is deep with chocolate sweetness and roasted tones. Finishes with a lingering combo of burnt tones, hop bitterness, and dry heat. The mouthfeel is a heavy medium with a slick, creamy feel. Alcohol is present but adds to the body, providing it with warmth and some extra beef.  This perennial holiday favorite from Brooklyn doesn't disappoint. With deep chocolate notes, a rich, roasty body, and alcohol warmth, it's perfect for Wintertime sipping.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,shabbtastic,4.4,"A - Poured a pitch black with a density so thick no light what so ever passes through.  S - Full chocolate roasted malts we dominate, sweet and inviting up front with toffee tones in the back.  T / M - Like silk! Full, creamy and oh so delish! Coffee and chocolate notes fill the month with full creamy texture, the finish is smooth as well.  D - One of my favorite RIS. I love Brooklyn's styles and this one is top notch. I would have given this a 4.5 or 5 but the ABV @ 10.6% it's reserved for a one and done session! Highly recommended.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BeardedBoffin,4.28,"This beer is black as the name suggests. The brown and creamy foam dissipated quickly with some lacing remaining. The aroma is very chocolaty mixed with coffee and some fruity notes.The palate is initially coffee-like with some chocolate flavors from the strongly roasted malt. Winy flavors move in as the beer ends with a fruity and warm finish while a light flavor of hops linger.  The thoughts above were recorded while tasting only the beer. After recording my thoughts I finished the beer while enjoying a gooey, rich chocolate dessert. The beer complimented it perfectly. The beer made the dessert better and the dessert made the beer taste better. The chocolate in the dessert accentuated the roasted malt in beer and subdued some of the more vinous and alcohol notes, which, in my opinion, further improved the flavor.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,GRPunk,4.32,"Bottle poured into a tulip glass.  A- It poured a dark black with a thin tan head that turned into a fine lace that left some sticky spots on the glass.  S- Somewhat sweet. It had some raisin tones along with an alcohol aroma and a touch of chocolate.  T- Chocolate tones, but not as readily apparent as the name would suggest. It was sweet like the aroma. More of the raisin and warming alcohol flavors.  M- Very smooth. It had a full feel and was on the lighter side of carbonation.  D- It's a nice sipper. It seemed to warm up my cold winter day. Flavors were more pronounced as it warmed.  Overall- A good representation of the style. It's a beer I come back to every year in the colder months.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BuffaloBill91,4.55,"I have already bought several 6 packs of this one. Was happy to see a display piled to near the ceiling at my local beer store (which was quickly gone down) figured it was time for a review... I had these at cellar temp... cant see drinking this cold it would be a waste. Bottle says brewed for winter 07-08  A- It poured Black with a slight ruby hue when put to the light..its oily but not thick- with a 1 finger tan head the settles very slow.  S- Alcohol,dark fruits and chocolate  T- Dark chocolate and fruits- a lot like the smell- with a perfect warmth from the alcohol in the brew- dark roasted grains with a surprisingly sweet taste -the hops are well blended with the other flavors because it doesn't have a bitter bite at all- excellent layering of flavors.  M- Its very slick not chewy and it might be a bit on the thin side for a imperial -it takes away from mouthfeel but adds to the drinkability...Has more carbonation than other imp stouts Ive had but not to much..  D- Top notch, I love imp Stouts- this one is probably the most drinkable for this style Ive ever had Ive had a couple that taste better maybe but those were 1 and done beers- this I can actually have a few and only the 10.6% stops me. I just cant get enough of this one..which I think thats pretty rare and I had to give this a 5 for drinkability.  I have been meaning to get some more of these to keep around and age for a while- but every time I go get more I seem to end up drinking them. I cant see why some people haven't rated this one higher-- maybe this years brew is better than others...",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Not much lacing  S - Nothing overpowering but mostly malts and hints of chocolate.  T - Dark chocolate, coffee and malts, it's really smooth and the alcohol is not very noticeable. Gets better as it warms.  D - This is a really enjoyable beer but I couldn't drink more than a couple at a time.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,hopsleeroy,4.42,"Thanks to LittleBreeze for this bottle.  Poured jet black and very viscous. Very little head retention and minimal lacy but still looks good. Smell of bitter chocolate and a faint smokey/coffee flavor. Taste is really fantastic. Taste is roast, dark chocolate right up front. It coats your mouth like a mik stout but doesn't have that overriding sweetness. As it warms, some type of fruitness is in there as well. Reminded me of dates that aren't overly sweet. Really nice touch. Lots of flavor but still very clean. A litte bit of fizzy carbonation that threw off some of the smoothness flavor. The alcohol starts to bite a little more at the end but in a pleasurable way. This is a treat!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,saintwarrick,4.85,"Been achin to try this and it does not disappoint. This brew lives up to the name as it is a solid black with a creamy tan head Aroma is milk chocolate, cereal, cocoa and molasses. Taste is tremendous; loads of dark bitter chocolate mixes in with a good bit of burnt coffee and cocoa. Very thick, more like chocolate syrup than hot cocoa. Alcohol is also prevalent but not distracting until it catches up to you.  A rare treat and another world-class brew from Brooklyn.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,atrus138,3.95,"Poured this from a 12 oz brown bottle. No expiration date was found, but the ABV pretty much proved that it didn't need one. Pours straight up black with ruby highlights. Thin head, but a very dark brown. No real lacing. Smell offers a smack of alcohol with sweet malts, mostly chocolate with some dark fruit. Taste reminds me a lot of the chocolate-covered liquor-soaked cherry I got my betrothed a couple of Valentine's Days ago. Very sweet tasting and surprisingly fruity. The alcohol is a bit much and isn't very well masked. Mouthfeel is thin for an imperial stout, though is medium-bodied with higher than average carbonation.  This is a solid, if not outstanding, imperial stout. The fruity flavors really set this one apart. I'd be interested to see what a few years in the cellar would do to this.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,trkerrigan,4.06,"At first I thought the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout came in a special black bottle... but I was wrong. To say this stout is dark is a complete understatement. This brew black hole black! When held up to the light absolutely no light passes through... This is then topped off with a rich dark tan head, which unfortunately dissipates quickly. Aroma is nice... nothing overpowering maybe some fruity notes. Taste is great. Dark chocolate is the obvious flavor; the high alcohol content is also prevalent. As the beer hits the front of the tongue maybe even a hit of sweet fruit notes. Mouth feel is ok, carbonation is high... The Black Chocolate Stout is the perfect desert, as the finish of this is probably the best I have experienced. The taste of chocolate will linger on the back of the tongue well after the beer is gone.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,AKBelgianBeast,3.93,"Thanks to LittleBreeze for the trade.  Pours jet black with little tan head. smell is of chocolate and alcohol. Taste is of some chocolate, alcohol, a little bit of dark fruit. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, but could be thicker. Drinkability is a bit off, because of the high alcohol taste, I think this will be much better with some cellar time.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,gunnerman,3.48,"Poured into a snifter, pours an impressive pitch black with a carmel colored head that leaves nice thick fat lace. Smell is very sweet I can smell a bit of smoke in there as well, like sweet smoked candy, the smell is very inviting and asks to be drank. The taste was a bit dissapointng, I drank this at a little colder than room temp. all I could really taste was a bit of a sweetness in there, like a tarty sweetness, I did not taste anything else, this could of been that it was very new and not yet settled, other than that I was a bit dissapointed.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Lothore,4,"A- Pours a deep, murky, black hue with a small coffee head which fades quickly leaving no lacing.  S- Very malty and smooth smelling with hints of chocolate.  T- Toffee, mocha, lighter than expected, hints of coffee but not overpoweringly so. Deep and rounded.  M- Not as thick as I would have expected, super carbonated.  D- A sipper for sure, but excellently decadent and rounded, good for desert.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Proteus93,4.18,"A: Poured a thick, deep black. No light through this one, with a beautiful, rich, and thick brown head.  S: Chocolate up front, as expected. Very malty, very smooth and rich. A very nice smelling glass.  T: Roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate flavours. Some notes of dark fruits - raisin, specifically, and alcohol. Somewhat comparable to plump raisins, steeped in alcohol, and coated with a rich, dark chocolate (or perhaps Cassis filled chocolates).  M: Not as thick as the pour might suggest, but still quite rich. Not quite creamy, rather a bit oily, but not quite syrupy, either. - which I would think would make such a brew unpleasant. Very nice, soft carbonation for a little bit of life.  D: One to allow to warm, and really open up. Something similar to a fine chocolates or candies that you would want to enjoy in gentle moderation... a nice dessert treat.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,sjohansen,4.08,"Pours like motor oil. Black with a one finger head the color of the inside of a 3 Musketeers. The head dissipates quickly, leaving spotty wisps on top of the dark black brew. Very sparse and spotty lacing appears in places on the snifter.  The alcohol is prominent in the nose, it comes through as hints of rubbing alcohol. As it warms, the chocolate malts come through.  Sweet on the front and middle, finishes with a slightly bitter taste of dark chocolate, aftertaste a little sweeter then what preceded it. Slightly powerful, has the pepper taste of alcohol, but it is masked well with the strong malt backbone.  Mouthfeel is smooth and silky.  Always will be one of my favorite Imperial Stouts. Although it is high in alcohol, its very well balanced which makes for a complex taste that hides the power well. And it doesnt disappoint by calling itself Black Chocolate Stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,L4t3rg4t3r,4.45,"Appearance: A thick black motor oil pour into my glass. With a nice tan head that fades in a few minutes. Is it just me or does this beer sound really good as it pours?  Smell: Strong notes of black Chocolate with roasted malty undertones.  Taste: Heavy dark chocolate with just the right amount of bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Full, but not over the top. This is a fantastic sipper.  Drinkability: IMO this is a fantastic example of a Chocolate Imperial Stout and is one of my absolute favorite beers. I think that this is a real standout and is definitely worth trying for anyone.  The perfect nightcap after a long cold winter day. Cheers!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,CrescentLake,3.54,"Beautiful pour, the head retention was immaculate and the color- wow- a tan-caramel/toffee hue. The body was a perfect consistency for a stout, slightly thick towards the end of the bottle, but an all around outstanding appearence. Not neccesarily down hill from there, but the pour definitely set my expectations pretty high. The smell was cacao and roasted coffee beans, but I could smell the alcohol...but in brooklyn's defense it is 10 and a half ABV. The taste was similar with some dark fruit notes, strong alcohol kick. Good mouthfeel, what you might expect from a solid imperial stout. Drinkability is average, you only need a couple of these bad boys to get you pretty tipsy, that is, if they don't put you to sleep first. I did score a six pack from Whole Foods NYC on 24th St, on sale for $7.99 from it's typical $11.00... so with that in mind it's the best bang for your buck in NYC, if you can cash in on this deal.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,slvrmon82,3.17,A very heavy very dead of winter beer. Will warm you up almost right away.  A- Very dark heavy black. Very thick. Not a lot of light can penetrate it.  S - Smells of wonderful chocolate and toasted malts.  T - Lots of chocolate with lots of toasted malts. Tasty but to thick for me.  M - Really thick and really heavy with a little cream feel.  D - One to two is all I can ever drink at one time.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,allergictomacros,4.2,"Pours out dark, dark, dark... well dark. Even the head is darker than your average beer. Aromas are rich dark fruit, alcohol, and chocolate/espresso. Taste is sweet and rich, with tons of fruitiness and roastiness. I'm getting coffee and chocolate, raisins, prunes, grapes, molasses, dates, apples and cherries. There's enough flavour that I almost didn't notice the astringency which is objectively fairly pronounced. Mouthfeel is creamy, with carbonation giving just a light prickliness. Drinkability is good, in moderation. Not sessionable, nor expected to be, but delicious and well worth trying.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,younger35,3.8,"Received this brew from YonderWanderer and drseamsu in a BIF and Suicide Pool. This is my first brew from Brooklyn and cant wait to try it. Drank from my Black Butte Pint Glass.  Appearance- Pours black as black allowing no light to pass, even around the edges. Very nice one finger dark tan head forms that is foamy and recedes fairly quickly. Excellent cap and collar are left behind an zero lacing. Smell- Not as chocolaty as I was expecting but this is a Russian Imperial Stout. Chocolate is definitely present though along with loads of caramel. A bit of vanilla is lingering along in the background with lots of alcohol vapors. Not any fruit in the aroma which is a good thing (for me) because a lot of the Stouts Ive had lately have been pretty hoppy. Taste- Nice chocolate taste that is subdued a bit, more milk chocolate than pure cocoa. Like the nose theres plenty of caramel and a bit of raw vanilla bean. Some concentrated dark roast coffee is evident and helps cut a bit of the sweetness. The alcohol is very pronounced and I wish it was toned down a bit. Obviously some time would help and luckily I have a couple more! Mouthfeel- Ridiculously creamy, rich, smooth and silky. Nice mild carbonation that is exactly what Im looking for in a RIS. Definitely the best trait of the brew IMO. Drinkability- This brew doesnt exactly fit my definition of a RIS (in my tiny brain anyway) but whatever it is, I think its pretty tasty. The alcohol definitely needs toned down or hidden a little better but Im sure thatll come. The soft chocolate and mild sweetness are pretty damn tasty.

45,680,jakeaustin,4.13,"Poured ultra black from a 12 oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. very thin head. Smells of dark chocolate, milk chocolate, coffee and alcohol.  Taste is good although not overly complex. Lots of chocolate, but the alcohol present in the smell doesn't come through in the taste at all, which makes this stout very drinkable, especially for 10%. Roasted malt flavor on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is top notch. Nice and thick, but goes down very smooth and easy.  Solid beer from Brooklyn. If you like chocolate, this one is for you.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,beerking1,4.55,"Pours heavy, thick, and deep black with garnet notes and a very dark brown head of dense moose. Completely opaque, this is the black hole of beers. Aroma is strong dark, even burnt malt, with notes of the alcohol and some dark fruits (dates, figs, currants). Hintsof anise come through in the aroma as well. Flavor is more dark (burnt) malt, bitter chocolate, and some very slight sherry notes. Finish is pleasantly dry and dark, with subtle reminders of the alcohol. Body is thick and oily, but very smooth.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,blakesell,2.86,"Winter 05-06 bottle right after they ramped up the alcohol, year old 12oz bottle poured into a Belgian tulip.  Appearance- Solid black with a thin head of tan foam. Lacing is like glue and leaves legs on the sides of the glass.  Smell- Chocolate and espresso with much roasty malts and some hop bitterness. A bit of lactose creaminess in the nose, but not too much. The bulk majority is the perception of milk chocolate.  Taste- Wow, everything that was previously great about this beer is now gone. The big chocolate flavour is now just a lingering memory. Alcohol burn and hop bitterness is most of what is left. The smooth creaminess is gone and now we have a very difficult to drink stout in our glass.  Mouthfeel- Sticky and cloying. Creaminess that should be there is hardly there at all. Bittering hops seem to have replaced this and make this much less of an enjoyable brew.  Drinkability- Nearly a drain pour. For some reason when they ramped up the alcohol they decided not to taste test the batch and this beer has suffered. This year's batch (06-07) is much better still having the big alcohol but retaining it's previous chocolate character.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DrainBamage,4.13,"Pours a syrupy black color with a lace of head. Smell is very malty with lots of chocolate aroma. The taste is full of alcohol and quite bitter. I'm kinda disappointed with the taste though, because the label says chocolate and the smell of full of chocolate, so naturally you'd think the taste would lots of chocolate, not here though. You can only taste a little chocolate here. Mouthfeel burns a little, as it should with such high alcohol. Don't get me wrong this is one fine Russian Imperial Stout, but if you're hoping for chocolate flavor you might be disappointed.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The smell is rich, roasty and enticing while the flavor is complex and rewarding. This is a very big beer and the 10% plus abv, although ever present, is well balanced by the chocolate & burnt malt flavors and the dry finish. This beer seemed medium bodied with a prickly fine carbonation that made the beer seem lighter. A nice after dinner sipping beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,irishkyle21,4.47,"The bottle says winter 07/08 so its rather fresh. It pours with a nice tanned head, good retention as well as lacing. Has a deep black color.  Smells of roasted malts, molasses, chocolates, burnt coffee (in a good way if thats possible) and some fruits.  The taste has lots of roasted malt, chocolate and coffee. Another great winter brew and another great beer from Brooklyn.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,alexgash,4.11,"Served at cellar temp. Deep, dark, almost black body with a large, thick, dense, creamy, milk chocolate brown head. Great lacing. Roasted barley, licorice, herbal-medicinal alcohol, dark sweet sugary fruits, and coffee on the nose. Roasted coffee bitterness at first, and then rich, rummy-sweet fruits flanked by herbal, warming alcohol notes. Dark, bitter chocolate settles in and the coffee and chocolate bitterness increase in the warming, numbing finish. Full-bodied with a velvety smooth feel. Will have to age a few to see if the bitterness settles down some.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DrinkinBuddy,4.11,"Pours a complete 3000 mile motor oil black. Smell is that of roasted malts, chocolate and alcohol. Taste is mainly of bitter chocolate mixed with a combination of roasted malts. A very strong alcohol taste is present. I wish they would have masked the alcohol a little better. Maybe next year. Mouthfeel is very full and thick. Very pleasing for a stout. Drinkability isn't the best because of the very apparent alcohol presence. A pretty good stout, and I'd try it again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,maddogruss,3.95,"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a glass mug.  A: Pours a thick, black body with a small, half inch head with ok retention. Slows to a small lacing along the top later on with some lacing along the sides of the glass, but not too much.  S: A nice, roasted smell with chocolate undertones. Reminded me of a chocolate liqueur chocolate ball.  T: A nice, roasted chocolate taste with a bitter, dark chocolate aftertaste. Alcohol was not too evident in the taste.  M: A thick, velvety mouthfeel. Almost like melted chocolate or chocolate syrup.  D: Ok drinkability. A little too thick to drink a lot of these in quick succession. A very good session beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,enki,3.98,"Poured literally pitch black into a pint glass with a thick brown head; almost like espresso crema, which dissipated to a light brown ring around the glass, and some lacing.  Smelled like chocolate, malt, alcohol, and a bit of coffee on the pour. Not overwhelming at all.  The taste was (as my wife said), like a sledgehammer to the mouth. Molasses, DARK chocolate, coffee, dates, and alcohol. Sweet too, almost too sweet. This is a strong beer, and it tastes that way. Thick mouthfeel too. Somewhat overwhelming.  Overall, this is a good beer, but a little over the top for me. The mouthfeel and strength are more in line with a barleywine like Old Crustacean (although the flavor is obviously totally different); and this from a guy who generally likes dark beers.  On that note; this is by far the darkest and most opaque beer I have ever seen. I held it up to a lamp, and no light came through. I was so surprised that I went and got my ludicrously powerful LED emitter light (brightest thing you have ever seen; built the switching PSU myself to drive a luxeon emitter for all the electronics nerds out there) which I stuffed into an old plastic LED flashlight.  In comparison, a Guinness looks like a dark amber with that light behind it.  Insane; this light will leave you unable to see indoors for at least a minute if you look at it. Think about it ;)  edited: I have grown into some of these bigger beers, and this beer is a lot better than I gave it credit for.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Morey,4.02,"I've had this beer on-tap several times on my way home from work. Pours pitch black with a thin goldish-brown colored head that hangs around til' the bottom of the glass. Superb head retention!  Smells of semi-sweet chocolate (although no actual chocolate is used in brewing) alcohol, ripe figs, and coffee.  Alcohol content was bumped up to 10.6% this year, and it's noticeable. Strong flavor of roasted malts up front. Just a hint of hop flavor. This beer doesn't have the bitterness that many other RIS do, which I don't mind. There's a slight fruity flavor in the finish as well.  Mouthfeel is silky smooth with a fairly low carbonation.  A very nice IS for the price.  Morey's Bottom Line: Alcohol is noticeable, but it's OK as long as you're in the mood for a big beer. Definitely a good choice for a Stout during the winter months. It'll warm you up, that's for sure.  **NOTE** This beer ages really well. I recommend buying two 4packs....one for now, & one for the basement.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,csmiley,4.11,"A - Pours a dark brown, opaque color. Got a little less than an inch of head that stuck around for a while. Lacing was great. Picture perfect.  S - Chocolate comes across first but is quickly backed up by roasted malt. Espresso seems to round out the aroma profile.  T - Taste follows aroma. Chocolate - roasted malt - espresso. There is also a strong alcohol flavor. Pretty good balance considering the 10.6 %.  M - This one is really pushing the full bodied envelope. Carbonation is great.  D - It is big and strong. Proceeding with caution is a good idea. Having said that, I consider this beer to be really good...in moderation.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Graham5161986,4.23,"A: pours a jet black with a nice 2 1/2 finger creamy, tan, head - good retention and leaves a nice sticky lace.  S: Dark chocolate, ripe fruit (raisins, plums, cherries)  T: chocolaty up front with a soury-sweet fruity tang and a subtle mocha flavour on the finish Nice and complex, very intriguing. the 10.6% ABV is hidden very well.  M: thick and creamy with a good kick of carbonation and a silky smooth finish.  D: This is a great beer. It has a really nice bouquet of complex scents and flavours and has a higher ABV than most popular stouts.

The first time this thing hit my tongue, I did a little dance on over to my sister to try who has recently got into stouts (cuz she read some magazine article that stout is good for women cuz it has a lot of iron in it...well...whatever it takes). Flavor is smooth and even, though she says it is kind of bitter on the end. I personally dont think it is bitter, I just think it is robust. Feel? Like silk. The first sip was amazing. Definitely drinkable, especially for a Russian Imperial Stout. I am always weary of trying to uber-hyped beers, but this one delivers. I guess it is good I will be living in Brooklyn shortly. Killer. Try it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bluemoonswoon,3.76,"12oz bottle (limited botting winter 07-08) poured into an imperial pint glass.  A: A fairly virorous pour yeilds quite an impressive head four inches at first then cascades beautifully into a two inch fluffy coffee colored masterpiece of a head that stays a cap for the length of the tasting. A jet black beauty with suprisingly sticky lace. Very inviting, almost seductive when the glass is paired with the bottle.  S: Chocolate for sure (so the name fits) but is not as overpowering as in other beers, there is a sweet plum and prune dark fruitiness here that almost takes over the chocolate aromas.  T/MF: A bitter sharpness strikes the tongue like baker's chocolate and stays on for quite a while, just a very bitter chocolate taste (i suppose this is why is is called BLACK chocolate stout), really hardly anything that the nose would have indicated. The brew is thick and heavy on the tongue and the alochol heat is very easy to sense as it just hammers away at the taste and leaves the tongue ragged and a bit dry. The taste is sort of difficult to distinguish as the heat from the alochol covers it up a bit; dried fruit like plums and raisins come out a bit near the finish and the chocolate character becomes a bit more pronounced in the long and drawn out aftertaste but the beginning and middle of the beer are sort of lost on me.  D: Really sort of disapointed in this one, I mean it is nice and complex and I do enjoy that warming alcohol sensation but this beer left me wanting a bit more and compared to other beers of this style there are a number I would reach for before grabbing this one.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Chocolate overtones with smooth caramel, vanilla, roasted grains, whiffs of alcohol and burnt marshmallow.  T  Very smooth. Tobacco leaf with strong chocolate. Some alcohol taste present. Flavor deepens at the finish with herbs and roasted grains rising to a slight bitterness balanced with lightly sweet vanilla and chocolate. Not heavy on caramel or chocolate. Bitterness is smooth and subtle. Not syrupy. Fairly neutral balance with predominant middle tones.  M  Smooth with medium to light body for an RIS. Carbonation is pleasant. Sticky without being syrupy. Alcohol is very palatable.  D - This is a very drinkable beer. The alcohol hides while the taste enhances with each sip.

M- The mouthfeel is thick and smooth on the palate.  D- This is definitely a sipper, the drinkability suffers from the high ABV.

45,680,erosier,4.2,"Pours an excellent black color from the bottle with a thick caramel brown head that sticks to the sides of the glass. Really strong aroma of heavy roasted malts, light hops, and even a little alcoholic aroma to it. The taste is excellent! Strong earthy malts combine for a complex malty chocolatey flavor with an aftertaste that is kind of chocolatey and a little bit alcoholic. The mouthfeel is good, especially of something of high alcoholic content. Amazingly it is very drinkable and I had a few of these before I called it a night.

45,680,Gambrinus1184,4.42,"Poured from a 12-ounce bottle at G.W. Tavern, Washington Depot, Conn.  A: Poured a jet black cocoa color with a nice covering of tan foam. There is a slight ruby shine when held to the light, but this thing is so deep and dark, it's almost scary.  S: Smells of deep roasted chocolate and caramel malts with a smoky charcoal characteristic.  T: Sweet, warming chocolate malt flavor. Very deep and interesting imperial stout. The use of sweet chocolate malts goes great with the chicken pot pie I had, but would be better served as a dessert beer.  M: Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy, but not too heavy that it's a chore to put down.  D: I had two with dinner, and I have a feeling this would go great with dessert, or even as dessert. The ABV is up there, and it's a heavy brew that might blow out your palate for anything else, but it's worth it to have a couple of these.  Great winter brew and a delicious variation on the style.

45,680,jdg204,4.51,"After passing up a shot at this hard to find winter offering last year, I scooped a 6'er up as soon as I found one. It was my second Brooklyn offering of the week and let's just say, I'm becoming a quick fan.  Appearance - A thick, syrupy brew pours pitch black with beautiful coffee color head.  Smell - Very nice dark roasted chocolate smell with a bit of liquor undertone.  Taste - Very interesting balance, first comes across as a nice high cacao dark chocolate (especially the roasted undertone) mixed with a bit of hops. Then you get into a bit of bourbon/vanilla undertone which really gives this a nice sipping quality, similar to a barleywine.  Mouthfeel - The roasted flavor leaves a wonderful aftertaste, leaving the mouth quite satisfied. Take your time on this one to give your tastebuds a chance to savor, I recco a tulip glass for slow sipping.  Drinkability - Second straight winner from Brooklyn and maybe the best RIS I've had yet. The biggest difference, they didn't overdue it with the hops and they let the roasted malt do the talking. I've finally found a competitor worthy of Storm King, I'll have to do some comparisons with West Coast brews now to see if this really is the champ. This brew lives up to the hype, grab it if you get a chance!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jeonseh,3.93,"Very dark and opaque with a thin head that leaves a bit of lacing down the glass. The head is a mocha color with a slight red tint.  The smell is a lot of carmeleized sugar mixed in with chocolate; A lot of sweetness coming off this guy.  Taste is actually kinda a sweet, a good mix of toffee, dark chocolate,caramel and coffee....actually feel like i can taste pure sugar in this too, which is nice buy almost makes it overly sweet. At the end, get a bit of the sugar sweetness that fades away into a bitterness that almost numbs the mouth; really no hint of the high alcohol other than that  Mouthfeel is kinda thick and leaves a nice coating on the tongue; overall very little carbonation in this one and a mix between being either thick or thin within the mouth.  Overall, a good beer to enjoy maybe with dessert but not one that I would go back to repeatedly; I feel as if it is overly sweet and can't get past the sugar taste...to me, it's not chocolate that dominates but just pure cane sugar.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TheodorHerzl,4.35,"Pours a dark brown almost black with soft ruby accents. A small brown head started the beer off, but quickly dissipated and left minimal lacing on the glass. The nose is as expected by the title of the beer. I get alot of bitter chocolate with plenty of roasted malt and coffee. I also can barely smell some alcohol coming through as well. The taste is robust and full of bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and espresso. I also get a good dose of rum soaked raisins as well. I don't get much hop flavoring even though the grain bill says it has fuggle hops for flavoring. The mouthfeel on this beer is my favorite aspect. It is thick and coating, but still somehow remains a certain silky smoothness that is really remarkable. This has a high ABV, but the drinkability is really a nice surprise on this beer.  Overall I think this is above average for the style and such a well made beer. I can't wait a year to taste the ones I've saved from this year.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,williamherbert,3.65,"2007-08 version...  Look is black with only a hint of brown. Enormous, puffy cocoa-brown head. Thick gobs of brown lace.  Roasted but also sweet. Robust dark coffee aroma. Hints of dark chocolate. Smells dark and thick, burnt and harsh. There is a touch of dark grape smell.  Blast of burnt malt, chocolate layer on top. Heavy strong coffee with a shot of strong whiskey alcohol flavor.. Alcohol flavor gives a sharp bite akin to a barleywine.  Feels thick and oily. Leaves a sharp, alcoholic film. It's a hard swallow. It's not a smooth, creamy stout. It's harsh, strong and full of alcohol.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Slynger,3.41,"Pours a jet black with a mocha head. The smell is somewhat faint considering the ABV. Semi-sweet chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is of the same semi-sweet chocolate and roasted malts along with some bitter coffee. Really not as much to this one as I had hoped. Mouthfeel is full but not overly smooth, creamy, or chewy. I was really not that impressed by this one. Not as complex as it could be for the style or ABV. Not bad, but slightly over-rated in my opinion.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,kimcgolf,3.55,"Not quite as hyped on this one as others are. I may have gotten an older bottle.  Poured to a used motor oil black with medium-thick dark brown head that lingered awhile and left okay lacing. Aroma was some bakers chocolate, coffee and a hint of licorice, but too muted to tell much. Mouthfeel okay with a medium body, but not spectacular and the flavor was drowned out by the taste of the 10.6% alcohol coming thru.  Not bad, just not as good as I was expecting.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,beeroclock,2.7,"Pours a deep dark black, little to no head, no lacing, just black as night. Smells of chocolate and coffee, maybe some nuts. tastes are muddled, but definitely too much of the burnt coffee present with the taste and dominant in aftertaste. Some chocolaty alcohol in there, but the burnt coffee is too much for me. I gave away 3 of my 6 pack.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Not much carbonation. The beer coats the tongue nicely. Goes down very smooth.  D: I kinda think this beer will be sooo much better in 6 mo to a year.

45,680,AgingWarrior,3.82,"I popped the cap on the bottle and my nose was treated to the wonderful scent of chocolate and caramel malts. The aroma of this brew is great! The pour produced a dark brown, almost black liquid with a one finger medium brown head with some lacing.  The first sip was pretty darn good with good mouthfeel. The after taste is a bit harsh with the sting of too much alcohol. The heavy alcohol taste pretty much ruined this brew for me. If they backed off a bit, this would be excellent.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Poser,3.73,Appearance is dark black with an almost perfect dark tan head. Aroma is strong chocolate and dark malts.

45,680,eberkman,4.4,"Pours a thick, thoroughly opaque jet black. Fairly thin deep-mocha head that diminishes to a ring pretty quickly -- I expected more of a head, but I also gave it a somewhat gentle pour.  The nose is a welcoming array of roasty, coffee-like malts, pungent fruitiness and the scent of alcohol.  The taste is brilliant -- dark coffee, bittersweet chocolate, buttery toffee, dark, ripe fruits, and the slightest trace of bitterness at the end that fades into a coffee-grounds sensation on the back of the tongue, leaving the alcohol taste at the rear roof of the mouth. Wonderful complexity.  Mouthfeel is thick and chewy -- little carbonation to speak of, just all-out satiny smoothness.  Exceptionally drinkable as an evening sipper, especially at its power level.  Definitely one of the superior Imperial stouts I've had.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Domingo,4.25,"This is the last of the Imperial stouts I've been trading for lately. Pours a murky black color and coats the glass like few others do. No light's getting through this one, although you can get a little bit of a chestnut color around the edges. It has a decent amount of brown head for a boozier beer, and it's actually got pretty impressive lacing, too. Smell's like bakers chocolate, roasted coffee, and I'm even picking up a little bit of a smoky scotch type scent. Tastes like what it claims. Semisweet chocolate and roasted nuts. A little bit of liquorice, too. The finish starts off sweet, but ends completely dry. It's almost like you just took a sip of coffee. I normally like the sweeter stouts, but because this one has a finish that's both sweet and then dry, it's an exception. Mouthfeel is standard per the style, if not a little thicker than normal. Drinking one of these is no problem, but I'm not sure if I could have more than 1-2. As this beer warms, the alcohol comes out a little more. Pretty solid Imperial stout. I'd say it's middle of the pack, BUT considering my opinion of the style - that's still wonderful.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,davidt,4.33,"Pours midnight black with ruby red light making it through only at the edges. Thick cappuccino-colored head that fades to leave persistent lacing. The aroma is of dark chocolate. The alcohol comes through in the aroma. Theres also a slight dark fruit, sherry like aroma on the nose. Fine dark chocolate comes through in the flavor, along with some expresso. Mouthfeel is very smooth and full of body. I look forward to this beer each Winter.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Ig0r,4.46,"When I poured the bottle a deep brown head shot up and then disappeared almost completely. The color is deep, absolutely opaque black. The smell is slightly sweet with a bit of coffee bitterness. It feels a bit thinner than expected, but the mild carbonation gives it a nice smoothness. Chocolate is apparent with a slightly sour finish. The flavor is well-balanced with the higher alcohol content. It really coats the mouth and provides a lasting, smooth bitterness.  It is snowing vigerously as I am writing this, so the stout gives a welcome foil to the bitter cold outside. I didn't know what to expect when I got it, but this is really what I like to find in a stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Shaw,4.28,"I've read many raves about this beer here and was excited to see it at my local Whole Foods. A bit pricey at ~$10.50 a six-pack, but let's see if it's worth it.  As you would expect, this is a totally black beer. It's so dark, even its head looks like milk chocolate. Impressive.  It smells sweet and strongly of alcohol, like chocolate and coffee soaked in rum.  The taste is sweet and even smoky with a nice warming from the alcohol flavors in the swallow. This isn't a dry stout at all. It's quite creamy.  It has a wonderfully creamy body that just glides over my palate. Wow.  Overall this is an excellent beer, another winner from Brooklyn, who have yet to make a beer that isn't good. This is a great beer from one of the best breweries in the nation.

Not a definitive flavor but a cloudy coffee smell. The head was reasonable and had a nice creamy tone. My first sip tasted fantastic but yes it did indeed feel thin. The alcohol is not pronounced, which did make it easier to down the entire pint. As it warmed it should have gotten tastier but the thinness was more obvious than it was cold. Overall okay, but Ill try the bottled version when I get a chance.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,cabsandking,3.38,"Poured like straight black oil with not much of a head, some tan surface lace. Sweet dark chocolate, roasted coffee, a touch of dark fruits, and slight alcohol esters. Dry, roasted espresso, burnt malts, slightly tart fruits, prune, and quite a big bittering and fruity hop addition that maintains a good balance. Alcohol moves in midway through and is a bit hot, gets in the way of the fainter notes and pulls out a chalky astringent. The finish is bitter cocoa powder and chalky, with some anise notes. As it warms the alcohol does back off a bit and reveals some vinous characters. Mouthfeel is smooth and fairly thin for the style and for what it appeared to pour, not bad at all though. Carbonation suffers from aggressive alcohol.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,becktone,3.49,"Eye: Black in color, motor oil, what can you expect...this, yes. Head is poor; tan in color it has very little retention, formation, and doesn't look like it is promising any lacing....this brew provides some decent lacing.  Nose: Alcohol is evident. Dark fruit and roasted dark grains make up the majority of this brew's aroma profile also small hints of chocolate malts. Not much more than that, overall the aroma is pretty good, though I wish that it were a bit more potent, more room filling.  Tongue: Not as complex as the Bell's Expedition which I just drank a few minutes ago, however it still has a large variety of flavors. Chocolate flavor doesn't come through as much until the aftertaste of the beer, it really shines there. Alcohol is detectable. Roasted flavors are also here, though they don't seem to be all that strong. This beer's flavor is more well rounded than the Bell's, whereas the Bell's was a bunch of different flavors providing depth this brew seems to have but one flavor, with little depth-much of the different flavors associated with the style combined into one blanket flavor.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Medium on the palate though it seems to me that it is leaning towards the lighter side of medium...the higher levels of carbonation in this beer reinforce my opinion. Finish is dry and leaves a chocolate flavor in the mouth with an alcohol associated flavor in the air. This is a brew I'll drink but won't be excited to buy again. I much prefer the Bell's Expedition over this one. Don't get me wrong its a great beer, but the flavor is not up my alley.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smells of sweet apple and darker fruits raisins, plums, and a slight vanilla. tastes complex of raisins, dark chocolate, and charcoal. Finishes with an overpowering charcoal taste. Carbonation is a bit overpowering for this style, mild carbonation works better in a a stout, in my opinion. This one is a bit too dark for my taste, and should be noted. Although with a 10.6 alc my down sides are worth overlooking. and i would have another one if offered.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,hellcatsjg,4.23,"Appearance: Dark black, not seeing any light coming through. Finger of brown head forms after a hard pour.  Smell: Alcohol is at the forefront, along with sweet chocolate and vanilla aromas. There is a bit of an oaky smell as well.  Taste: Sweet and chocolatey at first. This gives way to a malty flavor that transitions to a slight alcohol flavor which sticks around after each swallow. Leaves a nice bit of alcohol warmth as well.  Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy. Coats the mouth well but is not overpowering or too sticky. Very nice.  Drinkability: As with many Imperial Stouts, this beer suffers in this category just because it is very heavy. Within the style, however, this beer has a lot of good flavor without being too heavy. Definitely worth seeking this one out during the winter release each year.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,biking4beer,3.45,"07-08 Vintage 12 oz bottle enjoyed on a cool winter day after hitting the slopes in Breckenridge.  Pours a pitch black with a nice brown head. Good lacing.  First whiff brings the obvious to the nose. Chocolate. Roasted malts. A hint of some bitter baker's chocolate. Even a touch of pine, or is that the blue spruce I just put up for a Christmas tree?  Milk Chocolate up front on the palate. Some bitter dark chocolate too. Is there lactose in this one? It has a slightly milky taste and feel. The taste ends on a tart/sour note that is slightly unpleasant. There is also too much hop bitterness in my opinion.  Mouthfeel is the highlight of this beer. Thick and creamy. Perfect carbonation.  This is a good beer, but I feel the latest incarnation is still a bit green. I have no doubt this well become a finer beer over time. If you have plenty to spare, try one now and save the rest.

Pours a beautiful pitch black with a brown 1 finger head that sticks around mostly for the entire drink with some nice lacing on the side of the glass  Chocolately dark aroma with a bit of burnt coffee taste, but not too strong.  Malty, chocolatey, and with a bit of sweetness & bitterness comes through the taste. Relatively well balanced with only a bit of alcohol kicking in-nothing too much. Very thick and tasty.  I didnt drink this with anything to eat, but I could imagine that it would be nice to go with a dessert. Very drinkable and smooth to enjoy for such high ABV.  This was a great beer and I will jump at the chance to try another.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,tkarsies,4.25,"This review reflects 2 tastings from the same 6 pack a couple months apart. 1st tasting A:Very dark, nearly opaque with faint brown tones. Tan Head. S: Some roasted smell, boozy T: Lots of alcohol in the taste. Hints of roasted malt with some bitterness. M: Light carbonation with thick, smooth mouthfeel D: Very drinkable, dont notice effects of EtOH but the taste of it is WAY too prominent. Some age should mellow the alcohol and let the other flavors shine.  2nd tasting A: Same as 1st. Initially a little cold so minimal head S: Less boozy in the nose. Roasted malt aroma still predominant. T: Alcohol much less noticeable, even after just 2 months. Roasted flavors and chocolate are very evident now. This has become very nice. M: Same as 1st. Very smooth D: Much more drinkable now that the alcohol flavor has subsided. This is already become a much better beer, and I hope will continue to evolve over time. I cant wait to try another in a couple months.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Mudpuppet,4.3,A- Poured from a 12oz bottle into my sniffer glass. Pours a dark black with no light penetrating.  S- Red grapes and coffee. Slight alcohol on the nose.  T- Strong grape and prune flavors that give way to coffee grinds flavor. Very tasty and complex flavor.  M- Not overly carbonated. Flavors and sensations across your entire tongue.  D- This is one that is great in moderation. Intense in flavor and alcohol. Delicious one I look forward to when is begins to get cold.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ThatWineGuy,4.28,"Winter 07-08 version. Poured very black with an impressive dark-mocha head of different shaped bubbles, quite dense, about a half finger on pouring. The head eventually flattened across the surface of the glass to reveal numerous centres of rapid, small bubble carbonation, a good sign indeed. Good lacing.  Smells very rich, aromatic strong coffee with flashes of hazelnut, slightly Frangelico. The taste is bitter dark chocolate predominant, aromatic coffee, rich and powerful, with a strong roasted malt finish. Very full bodied, dense mouthfeel yet a creamy and buttery texture. I got distracted prior to opening the bottle and it warmed a bit, so the high alcohol content was quite pronounced. However, it did not detract from delightful taste experience. This beer was still a major treat, great with dessert, or to have as dessert, something to savour.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,prototypic,4.28,"Appearance: Pours a gorgeous dark brown (practically black) color. Head is off white and a generous two fingers. Retention and lacing were top notch.  Smell: Initially it has a very rich, dark chocolaty malt smell. Blends very well with an expresso aroma. Neither really overpowers. But, clearly chocolate and espresso are the primary features. It has some slight dark fruit notes and a bit of a toasted smell to it.  Taste: Again, dark chocolate and an espresso-coffee taste are the main features. They are blended extremely well. It does have a bit of a vanilla taste that I didn't pick up on the nose. Dark fruit flavors round it out, as well as a touch of hops.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium to thick bodied. Carbonation is very good. It's strong at 10.6%, but very drinkable nonetheless. Clearly not a session beer, but very smooth and easy to drink. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Highly recommended.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ksbrainard,4.3,"Appearance: Pitch black (of course). The head is brown with tints of purple in it, comes in relatively sturdy, and sticks around on the edge of the glass. There are even bubbles around in the middle of the glass.  Smell: Roasty and burnt. I can pick up some black cherry maybe, and some milk chocolate and even dark chocolate. There is a hint of alcohol.  Taste: Alcohol is there, and somewhat strong, but not in an overbearing way. The dark malts balance it out very well. There is bitterness at the end, comprised of malts and alcohol. Dark candied fruit stays with you as the beer warms you from within. There is maybe a subtle chocolate flavor, with a hint of nuttiness.  Mouthfeel: Very dense and solid. Carbonation can hardly be felt, and might actually be the sensation of alcohol on the tongue. There is a slick feeling sticking to the roof of my mouth. It is dried out a bit at the end, but only on the tongue.  Drinkability: This is very enjoyable. I especially enjoyed it after dinner, just sitting around and sipping gently here and there. Try it with some chocolate cake, or even a yellow cake - sweet foods bring out a rum-like character.  In case all this isn't enough, according to the receipt, this cost less than the average craft six pack, at $7.99 (+tax and deposit). If that's right, Brooklyn is leaving money on the table, this is totally worth more. Simply stated: if you see this beer, buy it!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Biscuit033,4.61,"A: Black as night with two finger brown head with nice lacing.  S: Spruce and pine hops upfront, sweet malts and hints of dark coffee.  T: Spruce, chocolate, smoky malts, pine, toffee, molasses, and licorice. There is a lot of flavors in this beer and all are delicious.  M: Smooth and creamy and thick like syrup with a long warm, bitter and clean finish.  D: This a beer that I would never turn down. The alcohol is evident but balanced well by all of the other flavors. This is a great sipper for after dinner.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,sethmeister,4.3,"Bottle which says Winter 06 / 07and has been stored in my cellar for a bit shy of one year.  Impenetrable gloss black in my pint glass topped with a foamy taupe head (2 fingers) which slowly recedes leaving hints of lace.  The scent is immediately roasted grains and soft bitter chocolate.  Taste is much the same. Smooth and creamy with a long finish of soft cocoa dust. I find a faint hint of molasses in there as well. The 10.6% ABV listed on the bottle, if correct, is hidden remarkably well. Hop presence is minimal, though of course this bottle has aged for as much as a year.  Mouthfeel is creamy and rather full, though not thick.  Drinkability is very high.  Very nice smooth subtle RIS.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,rallison,4.5,"05-06 Bottling. Thanks Joey - you're the man!  Pours a dark black with a 1/2 finger tan head that quickly dies but leaves some lacing.  The smell! I got some chocolate from a few feet away when opening. Smelling more closely gives me dark chocolate and dark fruits. Nice!  The taste is a wonderful blend of flavors - dark chocolate, espresso, roasted malts, dark fruits - with a beautiful roasted finish. This is a most excellent RIS indeed. I love the coffee and chocolate in this one - would make for a great dessert pairing.  Mouthfeel is rich with just enough carbonation to keep it from cloying. Very well done.  Drinkability I would say is very good on this.  Highly recommended. Definitely one of the better imperial stouts out there! I'd put a few ahead of this, but this definitely gives the best of the best a run for their money.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,thartman,4.06,"Served up a Winter 07-08 vintage in an English Pint Glass. The color was black with a thin, light brown head. There were nice sticky lacings on the glass.  I noticed a smell of dark chocolate and cherries, somewhat sweet smelling.  The taste was complex, bitter like espresso coffee and unsweetened chocolate, roasted barley and malts, and a hint of chocolate covered cherries. There is a definite alcohol hit on the back of the throat. The flavor is bold and there is medium body..., and it mellows a bit as it comes up to room temperature, a very nice cold weather winter beer. I think I'll stash a couple away for next season.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Ieatlambfries,4.18,"Pitch black in color with a beautiful three finger light brown rocky head. As it slowly dissipates it leaves a dense blanket of fine bubbles on the walls of my glass.  Roasted malts and cocoa on the nose. Slight suggestion of licorice with an undertone of brandy like alcohol.  Up front flavors of dark dried fruits, figs and raisins. Followed by roasted cocoa and burnt espresso with a hint of toffee. Boozy alcohol in the finish with a hint of hops.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with an oily slickness left on the lips and tongue. Very quaffable, rich in flavor and a joy sip and savor. Great beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,montageman,4.58,"Poured into a pint glass. 07-08 bottling.  Yet another fairly new addition to the Michigan beer scene, my only other Brooklyn Brewing experience was at the Chip Shop in Brooklyn. Oddly, I had this beer in Brooklyn as well. Pouring a thick, viscous black with a nice cocoa head that goes away fast and leaves some lacing. The alcohol is very present in the nose along with some vanilla, coffee, and chocolate. This tastes like any Imperial stout should chocolate, coffee, dark fruit, and some vanilla - perfect flavor that will only improve with age. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Aside from the nearly 11% ABV, this is very nice stout. Mellow with just a slight alcohol burn. Highest recommendation.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,willjansen,4.45,"Winter 06-07 release, 10.6%ABV, served in snifter.  Appearance: Oily, viscous black with milk chocolate head that doesn't stay around long (presumably because of the high ABV)  Smell: Vanilla comes across strong along with strong, sweet, creamy coffee (sweetened with evaporated milk). Caramel notes and of course chocolate. Hints of licorice coming through as well. Very complex and difficult to decipher.  Taste: Creamy, dark cocoa throughout and towards the end. Almost as complex as the smell. Aftertastes of licorice and strong creamy coffee. Distinct lack of roastiness. Alcohol present, but well-masked by for the high ABV. Very well crafted and balanced.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, milky mouthfeel. Smooth and silky throughout with perfect level of carbonation for imperial stout.  Drinkability: Held out very well for the 1 year that it was cellared. Alcohol is a bit high for anything but an occasional sipper. Excellent Brooklyn offering - an American classic.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Risser09,4.54,"12 oz bottle poured into a large snifter - '05'-'06' vintage served at cellar temp.  Appearance: Pours out and india ink black with a dark brown head. The head is only about 1/2 and inch in size and has various bubble sizes. Swirling creates a bit of lace but it eventually succumbs to gravity. The head dissipates within a minute.  Smell: Wow. Chocolate malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, espresso, caramelized dark brown sugar, pipe tobacco and lots more. There are dried fruit aromas of fig, cranberry and cherry. This smells like one sugary beer. Alcohol is hardly discernable from the smell.  Taste: Wham, right in the tastebuds. An almost blistering maltiness hits my mouth and has a coffee-like bitterness. Flavors include 85% dark chocolate bars, dark cherries, hershey's syrup and espresso. Following those up in the finish is an espresso flavor. The lingering flavor in my mouth is burnt toast and burnt popcorn. This one is super malty. Not as much sugary sweetness as I expected from the nose.  Mouthfeel: This one is big and bold, with a bittering coffee feel. The chocolate is not as sweet as expected and the booze is well hidden. It does make an impression with my stomach, however. This is a tremendous winter beer, and is well worth the below $30 price tag that a case carries.  Drinkability: This is a sheer winner in terms of value, strength, appropriateness and even drinkability. I can't believe this is the first time I've ever had this one. I should make it a point to purchase a case every winter. Very nice.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,drseamus,4.08,"Did a blind mini-vertical with an 06-07 (i'll call it the 06) and an 07-08 (i'll call it the 07). Individually based on the look of the beer, the smell of the beer, and the taste of the beer, I was able to identify the older vintage. It was a very significant difference.  The '06 had about half as much head as the '07; but both had ample mocha colored head atop a jet black body.  The aroma on the '07 had more yeast esters and especially a prominent banana aroma. The '06 had a more chocolaty aroma and was incredibly smooth.  Taste wise, they were closer than aroma. The '06 was very smooth with chocolate and roast malt character. The '07 was significantly more bitter and the alcohol was more present, but had the same chocolate and roast behind that.  The mouthfeel on both was very similar. Pretty heavy bodied with a long aftertaste.  Drinkability is weird to describe. In a way, i want to avoid drinking this to let it age. However, the older it gets, the better it tastes. Really a good RIS but it needs age to get there.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Hints of raisins or prunes...along with a small whiff of warming alcohol..very inviting  T - The taste was very complex..strong notes of coffee and bitter chocolate along with a sweetness of fruit and currants...a nice dry hop finish round out the taste experience giving an overall taste characteristic that can only be described as rich  M - A thick, viscous feel of this brew coats the mouth and the alcohol warm the mouth and throat  D - Certainly what I call a ""desert"" beer or a night cap beer..this is to be sipped and enjoyed and should in my opinion be the finish of the night...but it's a damn good finish",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Slatetank,4.25,"I poured this at a cool temp into my snifter. Purchased the '06-'07 version at Thirsty's in York, Pa.  A - Deep ebony w/ a thin tan head and decent lace.  S - Sweet, fruity esters w/ a roasted element and pine scent of hops, there is a rummy full sweet alcoholic not in the nose.  M - Viscous, sweet, complex in depth w/ spiced acidity and full carbonation.  T - Luscious plum and date sweetness w/ roasted coffee and dark chocolate character and acidity. Sweet w/ prune type dry fruit and stone fruit notes. A rich malty taste that is punctuated by a piney hop acidity and spiced character. Slightly drying w/ a full alcoholic essence - a relaxer, smooth on the tongue. Something to look forward to tasting each year, but doesn't attempt to hide its 10.6% stature.  D - Great Stout, outstanding flavor and feel, A very good example of the style, but not one to drink multiples of.

T: As the smell, big on the dark chocolate - with burnt malt and alcohol. It's quite bitter. Unfortunately, the alcohol interferes with the other flavors.  M: Rich, full body. Low carbonation. Smooth with a dry finish and a lasting bitter chocolate aftertaste.  D: Surprisingly drinkable despite the pronounced alcohol.

Hides the alcohol quite well.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bassmantin,3.63,"Pours a deep brown with a moderate brown/tan head. Very appealing. Smells of roasted nut and chocolate flavors.  Taste is very intense, with strong alcohol flavor throughout, especially in the aftertaste. The taste is rich in chocolate and very sweet up front, but it soon gives way to the overpowering alcohol taste.  Overall: Somewhat intriguing taste but intensity hurts drinkability.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Adamdc,4.33,"Aroma is chocolate mixed in with some alcohol. Absolutely opaque with a light brown head. Mouthfeel is nice, not too aggressive. Alcohol shows up at the back of the throat but it's all malt and chocolate before that. Very nice drink. Definitely allow it to warm up before drinking----my last sip was much better than the first.

45,680,morebeergood,4.08,"Picked up a six pack for after Thanksgiving dinner. Poured into a pint glass, and the color seemed to be midnight black. One of the darkest beers that comes to mind. Very minimal head and carbonation. The smell was of roasted coffee. When this beer is served a bit on the cold side, the taste of bittersweet chocolate is prevalent. But as this beer warms up, the chocolate flavor mellows out a bit, to somewhere between cocoa and milk chocolate. At over 10% abv, I do not understand how easy this brew goes down. But that small part of my brain tells me not to have more than a couple. This beer is a perfect after dinner drink, or with dessert, or as dessert itself.

45,680,rye726,4.48,"12oz bottle '07 release poured into a goblet at 45F.  Nice looking beer, near black with a creamy espresso brown head. Excellent lacing.  The nose is of chocolate, molasses, sweet roasted malts, coffee, molasses and delicate floral hops.  The taste is again strong with sweet chocolate and roasty malts. There is a coffe presence surrounded by a slight bittering hop character, fudge, caramel and dark pitted fruit.  Full body and nice mouthfeel that silks over the palate. A complex, but very well balanced beer that can be enjoyed anytime.

Smell: Coffee, chocolate, toffe with a tinge of booziness.  Taste: similar to smell great chocolate taste, but not too sweet like some chocolate stouts, nice little alcohol sting.  Mouthfeel: A little less creamy than I like a stout to be. Moderate carbonation, which is good for the style.  Drinkability: Very good for the style and alcohol content.  A very good imperial stout. I will definitely be buying more. I beleive it is only a winter release, which is fine because I think this will cellar very well.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

When cold, tastes mostly of smoky coffee and some mellow chocolate. As it warms, the chocolate flavor comes more to the front, yum. Mouth feel is good, with active carbonation. Wow, at 10% my first one is starting a buzz. Delicious to drink alone, or even better with rich chocolate cake. Rich, but drinkable, although not many at one time for me.

S - Big aromas here. Some alcohol cutting through a smell that has a vinous, wine-like kick of fruits smell mixed with chocolate.  T - Delicious taste of roasted dark malt. Dark chocolate flavor comes through with alcohol making a bit of a presence here. Finish is very roasted with an alcohol tinge aftertaste.  M - As always, Brooklyn had a achieved a nice full feel with their BCS. Also has some tiny carbonation dancing around that is present but not overdone.

45,680,clayrock81,3.65,"Got this black chocolate stout on black Friday (sorry, I had to put that line in). Poured a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass and this picked me up during this cold Virginia winter (I've spent the last 2 years in Florida, 50 degrees in Nov. is cold to me). No head whatsoever, as this is midnight black color. Imagine Coke SYRUP - a good sign from a stout. Upon smell there are hints of chocolate and coffee, and upon that first taste the malt kicks in. You can definitely realize the high ABV, which makes it slightly less sweet and smooth compared to Rogue's Chocolate Stout (which I think the ABV is in the 6 or 7 range), but is not as thick or leaves that somewhat malty, bitter aftertaste like an Old Rasputin does (which is still a very good beer). I think the reviewer before me, or the person in front of him mentioned how the high ABV limits the drinkability and I concur. I have had one after leftovers and I might have a second one, if that. This is a very good beer, more on the stout side than chocolate, so if you're looking for something very sweet you might want to pass. But if you are a beer lover, you'll have to pick this up and just have a nice glass (preferably after a meal so the 10.6% doesn't hit you) to warm you up during winter.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The rest of the 6 pack went into the black hole that is my cellar.  A. A beautiful beer. Dark motor oil black with a durable 2 finger head. Can't see through this brew no matter how much light you put behind it. Curtain like lacing that endures throughout the entire pint glass.  S. Dark chocolate and coffee malts. A bit more muted than some others I have recently tried. Still a good balanced RIS.  T. A little more bitter than most. Chocolate, coffee and mild finishing hops. The alcohol warmness is still there. Hopefully this will mellow with the aging.  M. Very smooth, creamy and viscous brew.  D. As with most high gravity beers the abv limits the drinkability.

S: Strong notes of coffee, cocoa beans, dark malts, earthy grains and moss. Somewhat sweet, but not cloying. Nice.  T: Very palateable for a RIS; notes of dark malts are enhanced by a powerful dark chocolate flavor. Mild molasses flavor with touches of smokey wood.  M: Hearty. Full. I think I drank a brick. Very dense, slightly sticky. Well rounded.  D: Average. This isn't an everyday or even every week beer.

Taste migrates from sweet to roasty and finishes with a heavy hand of warming alcohol. Certainly a sipper. Thick mouthfeel amplifies the roasty chocolate flavors. Complex dark fruit flavors along with more of that dark coffee.  Remarkably smooth for a imperial stout, but could use some aging before consumption. (This is a 2007 bottle).

Pours an absolute onyx black with a generous two finger khaki colored head that leaves a thick lacing on the sides of the glass. This beer looks perfect, the creamy layer stays forever...what a great looking brew. First whiff, smell is pretty booze-like. Dark fruits follow of figs, raisins, dates, and grapes. Not as much chocolate in the nose as I was hoping, but there is some present. Taste begins with a big roasted barley flavor and a rich french roast coffee tingle. Smokey vanilla and wood with a hint of caramel malt as well. The chocolate finally makes an apperance in the dry aftertaste. Full, thick, and creamy mouthfeel with a subtle carbonation. Alcohol is clearly present in the nose, but it doesn't seem to appear at all in the taste. What a great RIS that's easily available in the Syracuse area.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,holzmann,3.86,"This beer pours pitch black with minimal head (I suppose I expected more of a creamy head on top). The color definitely lets you know what you are getting into. It has a very nice chocolaty nose, however this is accompanied by a fairly strong alcoholic smell, that almost gives this brew a cheap character. Feels full bodied on the tongue and has a strong, yet not overwhelming chocolate taste that finishes with smooth notes of dark, almost bitter, chocolate. My initial thoughts were that calling this a ""beer"" is a bit of a stretch. So much of the experience that this brew provides makes me think ""chocolate barley wine?""

A completely black opaque liquid wont let any light through the glass. Looks like black velvet bliss.  A nose of sweet caramels I often associate with Trappist ales and a distinct aroma of cacao.  A super smooth mouth feel is complimented with a superb balance of the supple texture with the perfect touch of dark chocolate bitterness in the finish. Brilliantly balanced.

45,680,wheelinshirt,3.48,"Black, very dark black motor oil looking stuff pours out of the bottle, topped by a medium dark brown head that fades (probably due to the alcohol content). Smell is mostly roasted dark malts with a good helping of booze--could use some aging to get rid of the alcohol smell (and taste).  Taste is pretty boozy, bitter malt (not much hops). There is some chocolate in there, but not in the forefront. I don't know what would happen with this if it aged (i actually broke the bottle that i was aging, bottom fell out of the cardboard four pack). I would hope that the booze would die down and let the chocalate shine through with the malt--that woudl be nice.  Mouthfeel is perfect--not too thick but medium high with enough carbonation to liven it up. Too strong for me to consider very drinkable. Very good candidate for aging, should mellow out a bit. Very good value. Buy a couple and lay them down for a couple years.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,jdmorgan,4.2,"Looked interesting, so I bought a single bottle. It poured a motor oil black with a thin brown head.  The smell was soft and full of roasted malt body and chocolate/coffee aroma. The taste had a full body and a soothing chocolate taste as well. I was really surprised by this one. Chocolate tastes were dominant into the aftertaste as well, and the hop profile was medium/low. Carbonation was low, and consistency was nice and thick. I was impressed by how well the high alcohol content merged with the flavor. Much better than others of the style that I've tried.  Wow. I Wasn't expecting a truly authentic chocolate flavor. This was a well-balanced, hearty, stout. I enjoyed it thoroughly and would reccomend it to others. This would make a good winter warmer indeed. Drinkability is good, although it probably should be kept to reason instead of ""pounding"".",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bigeyedfish,4.6,"Winter 07-08 poured into a pint glass.  Pours an absolutely jet black(maybe the classic black bottle has something to do with it, but at least to me, this looks like shear squid ink) with a pretty decent size head that is almost a light orange; it's the closest that a beer has come to looking like a Halloween Oreo. Pretty intimidating looking beer. The head dissolves at a steady but not alarming rate leaving a pretty much solid, glass encircling lacing.  Milk Chocolate, Milk Chocolate, Milk Chocolate, Milk Chocolate. Probably should have expected that with the name of the beer (hereee's your sign) but this is worth re-emphasizing. It smells like a ton of chocolate. There's some coffee in there as well, and i'm afraid to say it, but there's a slight hint of cooked ground beef. I'm not sure if I like it or not, and I'm not sure if the only reason I smell it is I've spent a good two minutes smelling this beer; I'm just saying this is probably one of the more interesting stouts, at least on the nose, that there are.  Milk chocolate, then an orange slice and a shot of espresso, in that order. There is a ton going on in this beer, and to be honest, I'm not sure just one review will do it justice. There is even some chocolate fudge ice cream bars going on deep in the finish that is really nice. And now there's even some citrus fruit going on. Yeah, this is one beer with a ton going on with it. And now the citrus fruit I had is now coconut/pina colada. And now I've got some banana. Frozen banana...from a chocolate stout? I believe so. Wow. Really nice mid-palate, that's where I'm getting a lot of the banana/coconut/pina colada, really nice finish with the chocolate absolutely exploding. This is a beer I could drink an entire case of and still not get everything. Let's move on before I lose my mind.  Well, let's see what we've got going on in the mouthfeel. There's a lot going on, it pretty much grips the entire palate. Each region has a different flavor going on(the mid and side have the banana/coconut, the rear palate has the chocolate/espresso intensification, the front of the palate has milk chocolate which then switches to coffee which then switches to a combination of the mid/side palate flavors and the rear palate/finish flavors. So in short, yeah, this feels pretty good. Smooth as anything, an absolute epic in each sip with more going on than an episode of Lost.  Drinkability, well, yeah, it's almost 11% ABV, so it can't be that high. It's a sipping beer that almost defines sipping beers. There's so much going on that the enjoyment of one of them is as much enjoyment as two or three of any other beer(with the added bonus that the alcohol is almost equivalent to the aforementioned beer that you drink two/three of). There's a lot going on, and it only gets more complex as it gets warmer. But with it's high ABV, and the time it takes to drink one, it's hard to imagine drinking more than one in a night; this compares with any of the great, complex after dinner beers and is something that the thought of aging brings delusions of grandeur. Probably the most complex fresh beer I've ever had and an absolute winter staple from now on.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,garcia2a,4.2,"The cold weather is now welcome, Mr. Oliver's magic brew has landed.  Pours out with an opaque ruby-brown tone and a thin lacy head. Just enough residual malts and sugars for the beer to rim the glass when swirled. Very faint carbonation, just enough to catch your attention for a moment.  The smell was once again magnificent. Pronounced hints of malt, grain and chocolate. The first sip of this year's was slightly different than the past few years. This beer was a bit sweeter, as I surmised from the rimming. The sweet and the chocolate gave this a very crisp finish, probably the crispest I can remember, although I have a 95-96 bottle in the cellar.  Mouthfeel was great, as the grains and the chocolate really gave the old taste buds a workout. The sweetness added an interesting dimension.  This is a highly drinkable brew that I believe will improve with age. Have a few this year and put the rest away til 2012.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,fank2788,4.03,"Sampled on tap at The Spot in Bethel, CT Very nice appearance deep black with great lacing on the glass. Pretty typical on the nose nothing great but it hits all the major points chocolate, caramel, dark roasted malts with spicy hops underneath. The taste is nice fairly sweet but well balanced by bitter hops not a typical american RIS it is much more subtle in the hoppiness, which I like. The mouthfeel is nice also, mine was served too cold but as it warmed the fullness and smoothness of this beer began to come through. Drinkability is good also the 10+ abv is well hidden here in a balanced beer, I've had better but this isn't bad",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JamesS,3.41,"Pours a great dark black with good head and decent lacing. Has a slight chocolate scent, along with a bit of roasted grains, but it's not very strong. Taste has little (bitter) chocolate, little roasted grains, and little of anything beyond the heavy alcohol. Goes down all right for an imperial, a little rough. Nice to try, but nothing outstanding in it.  EDIT/UPDATE: Much better. Don't know if I had a bad batch, my taste buds are craft beer better, or something else, but I've really enjoyed this beer much more. Nice chocolate and stout tones without being too alcohol hot.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jasonjlewis,4.4,"Thanks to NCSUDO for the sample. I tried this at the GABF and wanted a full 12 oz. sample so I could explore it further and review it.  Pours a 2 finger head with good retention. Black in color.  Smell of caramel malts, chocolate malts, undertones of roasted malts.  Taste is perfectly balanced. Nice sweetness from the caramel malts and there seems to be a flow into the chocolate malts, the roasted malting is just an undertone for balance and is not in your face and abrasive. Finishes with a nice hop bitterness. This beer is total balance. Everything mends together so well.  Mouthfeel is slightly creamy and moderately carbonated. The malts are thick and almost syrupy.  Such balance makes for a great session beer. I don't care that this beer is 10.6% alcohol. I can't tell. I wish I had another one.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BEERchitect,4.18,"Enjoyed on Nitro-tap at Pazzo's Pizza Pub. Although I have drank my share of this beer in the past, I couldn't pass up an opportunity to have it in it's nitro-fused version. The beer is delivered to the bar with a heavily viscous black with a tan, mousse-like froth resting at the top of the glass. Tough to fight through the foam and obtain that first sip. Meanwhile, filling aromas of highly roasted malt, espresso, malty / nutty scents, and an unusual lactose fill the round out the olfactories. Flavors of espresso, cocoa powder, and an underlying sweet maltiness set the base for the brew, the show some light caramel, vanilla, pecan, and light esters of dates, figs, and grapes. The nitrous seems to mellow the flavors considerably, while giving a sharp tart taste -- akin to lactic acid. The mouthfeel, while initially very creamy, later resides to normal levels and is as easy to drink as any other versions of the beer. Always a fantastic beer, but the Nitro-tap did not hold the luster that I had anticipated.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,dalepryor,4.18,"i've done areview on this before but i felt the need to sit down and do it properly, pours a beautiful oily black. nice brown head that fades quick but it still gives a good presentation, the smell is of choclate, malts and well more chocolate and some alcohol. anxiously i lift the glass and pour into my mouth, very smooth, very think and velvety. i taste roasted chocolate, i taste sugar, i taste lots of alcohol, and some hairspray??? joking but... theres something potent there. best winter beer out there best stout i've had so far. i recomend for everyone atleast once..",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Deus1138,4.03,"I tried this last night and had mixed feelings. I decided to try another one today, then review it.  I'm enjoying my second bottle much more than my first.  I poured this into a standard pint glass. This stuff is thick and dark! It looked like chocolate syrup! The head was thick, dense and dark brown.  I smelled mostly chocolate, coffee, and toasted/burnt malts.  The taste doesn't hit you all at once. Lots of back and forth between chocolate and coffee. Strong after taste of coffee. Alcohol is slightly noticeable.  This is a great seasonal brew. I could enjoy it in the summer, but I think this would be best enjoyed near a fireplace after a few hours of skiing or snowmobiling.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,neobassman,3.96,"This is a stout that drinkers will love or hate, I imagine. It is easily the darkest, most alcoholic, and most assertive stout I tasted on a roundup of several domestic stouts, including several imperials. Upon opening the 12 oz bottle, I was immediately confronted by a Hershey's syrup smell. The pour was viscous and black, with a sinister, shiny, tan head - so far, so good. The head disappeared quickly albeit with substantial lacing. The taste, of course, is what will divide the audience. Imposing roasted malt flavor, more chocolate than coffee, with not much bitterness. There's a significant alcoholic presence, which is not surprising considering the 10.6% ABV. The taste is truly complex and continues to evolve on the tongue well past the swallow.  Each taste seemed to leave me with a different impression, from inticingly unique to wincingly harsh. For this reason I rated the drinkability lowest. I still don't quite know what to think, but I don't think I will rush out to buy a case to keep on hand. I would be really curious to see what this tastes like on tap - I suspect it is more appealing ""live."" So how does it compare to Guinness, the stout standard? I prefer it to Guiness for it's complexity and lack of Guinness's burnt, salty taste. However, it is ""hard core"" and like hardcore, perhaps too much of a good thing.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,w5baron,4.88,"This dark beer does wonders to the taste pallet. It is a rich malty beer but does not over do it.

I aged the beer for a year, did change the beer a little but either way its great just as if it just came right from the brewery yesterday.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bosco7,4.18,"Nice looking label. 2007 vintage.  Pours thick and opaque with a brown cloud like head.  Booze, liquorice, coffee, but not too much chocolate in the nose.  Whoa. First thoughts upon tasting: Big, chocolate, and smooth. Starts sweet with plenty of dark chocolate then a hit of cherry and blackberry in the middle. Finishes with espresso, roasty, and liquorice flavors.  Full bodied big ass beer with a chewy texture. The finish is surprisingly light almost dry. Alcohol is quite apparent making this a sipper. Highly recommended .",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bboven,4.46,"Whew. I didn't see this one was over 10%. Better take it easy.  Beautifully black body. Light to medium brown head that stayed even after 10 minutes of decanting. Loads of lacing.  The stout is there but there is a huge caramel/toffee aroma. The chocolate comes in third and the stout characteristics bring up the rear. There's got to be a lot of lactose in this beer because there is no alcohol aroma whatsoever.  The stout show up a bit more in the taste; still loads of lactose and chocolate flavor. No alcohol until it starts warming in your stomach. Starts like a dessert and finishes like a stout.  Thick, creamy and coating. This is where that lactose comes into play. Hell, that why lactose was invented. Carbonation is low but full. Never had a better example in this style for how it should feel.  My only complaint is that I wish the normal stout flavors had a bit more presence. But, that's just if I had to complain. I'm bringing a couple bottles of this one down to my father in law's for Christmas to break the ice for sure.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

I enjoy stouts so I thought it was a perfect combination between the mouthfeel and taste.

Goes down easy.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TheTrevor,4.2,"This beer poured an opaque black with about a three finger dark tan head. The smell is of roasted malts and a fruitiness that's hard to put my finger on. Maybe raisins or plums or something. The taste is very strong with a definite alcohol presence. That 10.6% is making itself known. The taste predominantly bitter-sweet chocolate with alternating sips giving away to other flavors like malts and maybe molasses or prunes. A very complex beer worth sitting down and savoring. The mouthfeel is very thick, almost like a watery milkshake with slight warming from the alcohol, a very pleasant drink.

Ends with some hop bitterness, adding depth and balance.  m: As full bodied as you can get, feels like oil or syrup, very thick and creamy yet smooth. Sticks to the tongue.  d: It's filling, rich and potent making it a sipping beer that's as far from a session beer as you can get. Would not want more than one in a sitting.

45,680,Bitterbill,4.35,"I got this one in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John!  First off, I've had this brew before, years ago, I remember loving it but it was at a time that I wasn't in to reviewing beers. So, here goes:  It pours from 12oz bottle(label says: Limited bottling-Winter 06-07) an absolutely pitch black with a very small head of foam, typical for the style. After a few minutes, the foam recedes to just a ring around half of my glass. Yep, one half has some foam, the other half has no foam at all.  The smell has big notes of chocolate,(duh) sweet and roasted malt, dark fruit, and alcohol.  The taste is very chocolatey at first, overpowering everything else but...the next sips reveals roasted malt, toffee, some dark chocolate, raisin, plum, molasses...very complex. Just what I want and expect from a RIS. Yummy. It's medium bodied and the carbonation is lightly done and it finishes with that almost heavenly dark chocolate bitterness. I have to say, the alcohol definitely gives me some warming during and after the swallow but it doesn't interfere with the actual flavour at all. Great sipping brew, as it *should* be. Man, I love the style and this one carries the banner very nicely. I'm *so* glad I got a chance to try it again. Thanks again, John!  Bottom line: A very tasty and palate pleasing RIS that I can only highly recommend. My hat is off to Brooklyn Brewing.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jjboesen,4.29,"During a Halloween visit to RFD in Washington DC, I tried this wonderful expression of Russian Imperial Stout. What says ""trick or treat"" like a pint of chocolate?  Served in a goblet at the correct temperature, this stout introduces itself with an inch thick head of beige foam; eventually, it ebbs down the side of the glass leaving in its' wake a thin lace along the side. The settled product is pitch black and waiting...  Initially, I detected the bitter traces of dark chocolate with a slight hint of the molasses. Velvety smooth mouthfeel with malty aftertaste. The one flaw was the lack of nose, but then this has never been a strongpoint of mine either.  In any case, I enjoyed this one. While it cannot compare with my favorite Russian Imperial, Old Rasputin, it is an exceptional quaff that, like anything from this great brewery, is always worth seeking, finding, enjoying and reveiwing.

45,680,DefenCorps,4.1,"2007-08 bottle, refrigerated and poured into a Duvel tulip. Purchased for 8.99 a 6-pack at the Village Pump in College Park, MD  A: Pitch black with a tan head  S: Chocolate, alcohol, dark malts. I want to say i smell dark fruits - figs being the biggest. Alcohol becomes prominent as the beer warms up.  T:Chocolate, alcohol.I can taste both, a sweet chocolate and a bitter chocolate. heavily roasted/burnt malts maybe? This burnt malt does add a lovely dimension to the beer and is the aftertaste.This years bottling seems a little hot right now. I'm going to give the rest of this 6-pack a few months at least.  M: Feels great.Mildly tingly while retaining the thick consistency on the tongue  D: Not as good as the 06-07 when i had it fresh, simply because the alcohol is a little harsh. Still, a very good sipper.  **Edit 10 Jan 2012** I saved a few bottles of the 07-08 release, and am finally getting to revisit this beer. The nose is delectable, with a blend of dark and chocolate, a little licorice, some anise, a little vanilla, a little chalk. A little alcohol is apparent as well, lending a mildly fruity character to the nose. A little bit of sherry like oxidation is also present. The palate is also very, very good, with a blend of licorice, anise, cocoa and coffee. Oxidation is moderate, with some sherry flavors. None of the cardboard that I'd feared (I guess Brooklyn knows how to package beers, eh?), though the finish is a little thin and lacking in depth. Fruitier on the finish than the nose would lead you believe. The carbonation is also a touch high, lending an acidic bite that works with the mild grainy acidity that's also present. This beer has aged very gracefully, I'm upping my score for the taste and overall impression from 3.5 to 4, smell from 4 to 4.5 and dropping the mouthfeel score from 4 to 3.5  **Edit 17 Jan 2014**  My last bottle of the 07-08 bottling. The nose does have a mild cereal/ cocoa puff character along with dusty cocoa, a touch of spice ( anise, pepper)some sherry, a touch of prunes. The palate is a blend of roasted grains, a touch of tartness/ grainy acidity, some cocoa, a little bit of earth, some spice. A little bit of fruit is also present, bit this seems to have dulled a little bit. Still, a very good straight up RIS. 3.5/3.5/4",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smells strongly of hops, a little alcohol, smells exactly like the inside of a brewery.  Wonderful full thick mouthfeel, bitter hoppy black coffee bite, no alcohol zing. Smooth and creamy. Not as chocolate as I thought it would be, the roasted malt flavor is dominant. Nice sipping beer. This is the 07-08 release.

The sweet yet bitter chocolate appears in the middle and carrys thru the finish.  M: Nice and full bodied. A very rich creamy beer.  D: Nice for an RIS, not even a hint of the ABV on this one.

There was very little hop flavor... this one was mostly thick and malty, just as i prefer.  the mouthfeel was creamy, thick, oily, and mouth coating, just as a RIS should be.

Spotty lacing around the glass. So far so good. Smell is dominated by alcohol. Some burnt malts and chocolate. As for taste, disappointingly boring. Lots of roasted malt, some chocolate, prevalent alcohol...thats really about it. Nice velvety smooth mouthfeel with just a little bite at the end. Warming effect from the alcohol. I've had plenty of stouts that were better. I'm going to let this one age a bit. It begs for it.  Same Winter 07-08 bottling after 7-8 months at 65 F:  Alcohol has toned down a bit. Dark chocolate has really come in. Almost tastes like baker's chocolate. It seems this beer needs a couple years at least to peak. Knowing Garrett Oliver and food, maybe he just brewed this for rich dessert recipes.  Fresh Winter 08-09 bottling.  Have I really just developed that much more of a taste for these big RIS's or have they really worked on this recipe? I really like this better than last year's. Alcohol is much less dominant. Same big roasted flavors but more pronounced coffee and chocolate notes to complement it. Not bad at all.

45,680,Phormula,4.43,"Decided to grab this beer on a whim while shopping at a local beer and wine emporium nearby. It was my first of any Brooklyn beer, and in result of drinking this masterpiece; I will be trying as many of their brewings in the near future.  A - The blackest of blacks. This beer looks like it could be used as an alternative fuel source for the winter months. It's head is espresso-like, very dark. It's a mighty fine brew to admire against the light (even though barely any light makes it through).  S - Roasted, toasted, and boasted with bold aromas. I'm getting mostly bitter-sweet chocolate, espresso notes, roasted malt, and perhaps a slight subtlety of fruitiness (cherry).  T - Absolutely wonderful, all around. It's not nearly as bitter as most stouts, and the alcohol isn't as up front as I expected it to be being so high of an ABV. Pretty much the same as the smell in the taste department, although a bit more sweetness comes through. Very nice.  M - The highlight of this beer is how smooth and creamy it is. It's like velvet on my tongue, with just a sight carbonated feel. Perfect.  D - As much as I'd like to say I'd like to session with this beer; I couldn't. It's just a little too strong and heavy to have more than a couple of these.

I, of course, don't have anything to compare this to as fresh, but let's see how it's held up however they've stored it.  A - Pours a super black color with absolute opaqueness -- the light to moderate head is an interesting brown that dissipates into a film floating on the black tar of the beer. Leaves a thick lacing when washed around the outside of the glass.  S- Chocolate and cherries. Sweet and malty - a little bit roasted, but no burn scent whatsoever. -- no alcohol smell as other reviewers have found. Don't smell much in the way of hops.  T/M - Creamy and sweet. Malty chocolate, but I also taste a lot of fruits -- cherries and prunes. Tastes really pretty good -- not a heavy coffee flavor or burned at all. Very smooth. The hops are very light, and they don't leave much impression except as a comparison with the heavy malt flavor.

No light escapes this beer, it's a black hole in a glass. A one finger brown head came forth on the pour. The head was so dark there was a bit of purple tint to it. The head did recede rather quickly (not surprising due to the high abv.) to a skimming with a thick collar. Leaves drink lines after each sip. Looks like a stout should look.  The aroma is heavy upfront with dark chocolate and heavy in the middle with dark berries. Dark chocolate and a lactic creaminess show up first and, while they do fall to the back, are present throughout. In the middle comes a sweet dark berry character that compliments the chocolate and cream nicely. The middle reminds me of some of the better Baltic porters I've sampled. There's hints of roasted malts gliding through there.  Flavor goes right along with the nose on this beer. The drk chocolate is up front and in your face with a smooth bitterness. There is some heat on the finish that adds to the complexity and, in my opinion, rounds out the flavors nicely. Quality stout. I'm in between the 4 and 4.5 here for the flavor rating. After some contemplation it deserves the 4.5.  The mouthfeel of this beer is out of this world. Heavy bodied with a luxuriously velvety mouthfeel. I couldn't ask for more in a stout. The heat gets your cheeks warm after a few sips.  It's a little bit of a chilly night and this beer is going down way to easy. On a downright cold night I can't think of many things I'd rather drink than this beer.  Another great brew from Brooklyn. I'm going to head out and buy a case of the 06-07 and the 07-08 tomorrow. Can't wait for a vertical in a couple more years. I can imagine this beer changing a whole bunch over time.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,gmcfarre,4.6,"12 oz bottle poured into New Belgian chalice Opened in honor of Garrett Oliver's NY Times editorial today (10/19/07)  A - Pours not unlike motor oil - a rich and incredibly dark, slow-moving ale. Color is of dark chocolate, nearly black with a thin layer of light brown head. This beer is opaque. Lacing is nice when tipped, but non-existent otherwise.  S - Scent is reminiscent of bitter dark chocolate and espresso beans. A slight hint of burning alcohol. Mild hop activity. A rich, sweetness develops in complement to the breaded malt flavor.  T - Dark chocolate (hence the beers name I suppose) with intense roasted espresso flavors whose bitterness is confusing: is it the coffee/dark chocolate flavors that leave the bitter aftertaste or is there a strong hop presence that I am missing? Sweet, dry breaded malt. A light touch of juicy, dark fruit, plums perhaps. A complex beer that doesn't disappoint.  M - Full bodied with a molasses effect on the tongue. Slightly drying and bitter aftertaste with a touch of alcoholic burn.  D - A strong beer that shows its power well into the 12 ounces. Incredibly delicious, and worth seeking out. Just make sure you enjoy it with a meal.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Jerzdevil1116,4.42,"Beer was purchased at Joe Canal's on Fire Rd. In Egg Harbor Twp., NJ. First time I've had this beer. Winter 07-08 Bottling.  Appearance: Rich, dark black color. Did not retain it's head well. Little to no visible carbonation.  Smell: Chocolatey just like its name. Also earthy.  Taste: Malty and chocolatey first taste. A little sweetness. Alcohol finish.  Mouthfeel; Very smoothe and velvety. Coats the tongue.  Drinkability: Spent too much time on this review and less time enjoying the beer. I think it's time for another.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,franksnbeans,4.5,"Glugs out a motor oil black with minimal chocolate brown head. Smells of big chocolate, a minor hop, minimal coffee and the chocolate covered cherry alcohol scent. Taste is huge on chocolate, delicious. Cocoa, minimal coffee grounds and a bite at the finish. Some alcohol is apparent but not nearly as much as the ABV suggests. Smooth as silk in the mouth and a delight to taste. A sipper but in a very good way as you should savor this one. A little hot right now but with a little age this thing should be a classic.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,timtim,4,"dark as night with a thick, dark tan head that has okay retention and tons of lace. Smells of roasty malt and choco choco choco malt. Super faint hop scent. The lack of hops is ok by me. Not every beer has to be hopped up. Taste is dark, unsweetened chocolate, burnt toffee, roasted malt. Full body, but not a silky as I had hoped. Nice little bitter finish. Pretty darn good. High abv will get ya. Not my favorite imp stout, but not bad at all. I can't wait to see how this one will be at the end of the winter.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,wagenvolks,4.31,"12 oz. bottle (07-08) into a tulip glass  A viscous, opaque body pours as dark as night and leaves a slowly forming, well-retained dark tan head. Lacing is impecable, nearly coating the tulip (doesn't happen very often). The aroma is obviously very malty, with dark chocolates dominating the smell. Notes of coffee, alcohol, and hoppy florals also present.  Great flavor to this one: Roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, some alcohol and hops as it warms, and fruity notes (dark cherry, mostly). Mouthfeel is thick and smooth, but leaves one hell of an alcoholic/dark chocolate bite to the finish. This is a standout brew, probably one of Brooklyn's best. I can't wait to see how the BCS ages.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,hchinaski,4.25,"12oz. bottle found on a random trip to CapitalAleHouse to meet up with the wife and her friends after work. Not on the menu, i think this just came into stock today! Though not entirely cold, i did let the bottle set on the counter for 30+min. before opening.  A-Jet black pour into my Chimay Goblet. Half-finger, tan head that lasted from the kitchen to the living room. Good deal of lacing painted on the glass for the remainder of the drink.  S-Um, chocolate. More chocolate, little bit of alcohol, and i think that i can catch some coffee. Did i mention some chocolate?  T-Chocolate. Smooth, not quite creamy, yet not strong in any sense of alcohol-taste. Deceptively strong, even knowing what the beer was capable of.  M-Not quite heavy, but a slight sweet lingering on the palate.  D-Already on #3 for the night (one at the bar a couple of hours ago, and just popped the third) i don't think i could handle much more. That being said, i like this just as much as i did last year, maybe even more so.

45,680,iconoklaztor,3.58,"Thanks to kmpitz2 for this brew! Cheers  This beer is a beautiful brew. Its appearance is great. It pours a pretty small head but its a nice color. The smell is decent with a strong alcohol smell. You can really note coffee, chocolate, and booze. The mouthfeel is full and powerful. This makes it a little hard to drink. Its definately better at warm temps.  Grab a few and age it. Its pretty nice",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,seaoflament,4.35,"This is an 06-07 bottling edition; I got this one from BeerBeing from the ""I Want THAT: round 3, BIF"".  Pours dark and with a good finger worth of coffee colored foam. Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, chocolate covered cherries, coffee, dry smell of cocoa, vinous characteristics from the alcohol, a very good aroma overall.  Tastes very similar to the aroma. Chocolate and coffee upfront with a nice roasted malt profile. A nice little complex mix of flavors going on here.  The aftertaste is dry with some cocoa and roasted bitterness. This one would definitely benefit by ageing and I can't wait to try my 05-06 beers.  ****update 9/7/08****  I got this beer a while back from MrBURTON55, thanks.  This beer pours as dark as chocolate syrup and a half inch of tanned foam. Head doesn't retain for more than half a minute and then reduces to a ring. (4)  First I get a chocolate flavored liquor aroma with some strong anise and licorice. After I finish pouring I can smell a wonderful mixture of dark fruits, chocolate covered raisins, dates, figs, cherry, dry prunes, vanilla, toast, chocolate malt, roasted barley, brown sugar, molasses, maple syrup, and malted milk. There is also a subtle salty and meaty aroma, makes me think I might need a fork and knife to finish this one. Something just falls a bit short for me for a higher score but it is pretty solid. (4)  Nice roastiness upfront with a mixture of bitter-sweet chocolate, fresh bread, toast, a bit of vanilla, licorice, raisins, brown sugar, and a bit of alcohol. Very woodsy with some oak flavors in the finish and aftertaste. I also taste some cocoa in the finish. (4)  Syrupy feel initially but surprisingly there is still a good amount of carbonation that helps pick this one up in the finish. A good semi-dry finish helps balance this one out from being too sweet, nice roasted barley dryness. (4)  Alcohol is pretty well hidden behind the roasted profile so it is fairly easy to drink. (4)  I'm pretty satisfied at how this one has held up so far.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,yngvar,3.86,"Bottle. Vintage 2006. Pours with a little happy laughter and a big smile on my face. It (the beer, not my face) might have a little brownish hue, but it wouldnt be fair to call the beer ""Brown Chocolate Stout"", as it really is as black as the original sin, and topped by a small but dense, tan head. At the very same moment the beer started to show itselves in the glass, heavy aromas escaped the glass, leaving coffee, dark chocolate, burnt and roasted malt, a vague note of dried fruits and even more chocolate, a bit sweet, in my nose. Even though its a lovely aroma, I wouldnt say no to even more complexity. Maybe some hoppyness, which is quite distinctive in the flavor, but the alcohol that comes when sipping it, Im happy to be without in the aroma. In addition to the elements of the aroma, and the fore-mentioned hops and alcohol, theres some licorice as well when tasting it. It has a good dash of bitterness in the finish, especially from the hops, but also coffee-like bitterness from the burnt malt. Its maybe a bit thin on the palate. Not that it is thin, but I expected it to be more chewier, yet it is quite sticky. The beer really suits the cold winter months, with its warming alcohol and lots of heavy flavors and aromas. Next time though, Im hopefully having a cellared version, as I believe it could use to have its corners rounded a bit. Well, now the beer is gone, all that is left is some nice, tan lacings and some flavors in my mouth. And the memory, off course. By the way, are there some cigar or cigarette smoke as well? At least there was something in the last drop. (070908)",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MrBen,4.9,"About as good as it gets. I've enjoyed this brew for the past couple of years, and it just keeps impressing.  Pours totally black, somewhat thick, and tosses up a dark tan head. Smell hits hard with a tingle of dark roasted malts -- chocolate -- plus sweetness of raisins and other savory, dried fruits. Some toffee, coffee, nutty delight, and general toastiness. I have to dive in! Smooth mouthfeel, coating the piehole with massive maltiness.  Flavor is enormous. You just have to drink it slowly. Flavor of big malts take over, with a fantastic background of flinty, grainy black patent and choclate malts. Superb. Warmth from alcohol sneaks in once in a while, but the complete riot of tasty treats sits on top of any alcohol flavors and farts on their heads.  This is a giant among stouts and a titan among beers. It's up there in the ABV department, so sip carefully and respect the hell outta this amazing beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Three-quarter inch mocha-colored head dissipated into an oily slick with some concentration around the bowl of the glass. Sheets of lacing with decent retention present during the tasting. Scent of chocolate, malt and molasses. Taste similar to nose with a touch of dark fruit. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied with very little carbonation and a bit chalky at the finish. Alcohol was very well-hidden, but this brew definitely packs a punch after a couple. Nice go to RIS if you're looking for something with a little less viscosity.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Minimal lacing. S: Surprising citrus tones, a lot of chocolate and caramel, raisins and spice. Hops are pretty distant. T: Delicious mocha up front, a lot of roasted malts, coffee, caramel, with some darker fruit, red wine and citrus around the finish. You can feel the alcohol at the back of the throat but it's not overwhelming. Really wonderful. M: Thick, gooey, chewy. D: Even though you get a sense of the alcohol, it doesn't feel like a 10.6 abv at all. I could drink way too much of this way too fast. Good thing I only have one bottle.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

M - Thick and creamy with a smooth mouthfeel and a dry finish that lingers.  D - Slightly boozy but very good. I was lucky enough to try a 5 year vertical a few months back and the 2 and 3 year old versions were sublime.

45,680,zerofear13,4.17,"After a second tasting, I have decided to come back to re-review the much sought after chocolate stout. I picked up this brew at Community Beverage in Elmhurst, Queens. It doesn't seem to be widely available every where, but my store said it was stocked pretty much year-round, as I am not too far from Brooklyn, and am not too concerned as this brew was a) in the fridge, and b) meant to be aged.  Poured 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. A very deep black, with thin head that retains well, but leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Smells very much of chocolate, roasted malts and hops, and coffee. Probably one of the best smelling beers I've ever smelt. The taste is a bit overwhelming. The 10.6% alcohol is not to be underestimated. The chocolate and coffee taste is delicious as an after taste, but not before you are rushed with the heat of the alcohol. Be warned, this brew is not for the faint of heart. Rather light for something labeled as an imperial stout, and goes down really smooth. Overall, I'd highly recommend this beer for a beer tasting, but probably wouldn't session with it, as it would take you out quick. Delicious, but strong brew!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,yodaseo,3.68,"bottled in the winter of 06-07, the sexy looking black chocolate stout beckoned my name from the fridge. i withstood its calling for about 30 minutes before cracking it open and pouring what seemed to be an interminable head. impressive for a 10.6% beer. the smell was full of chocolate (obviously) and heavenly sweet malts. and as i enjoyed a big whiff of my pitch black brew, a wall of alcoholic fumes singed my nostrils and abruptly brought me back to reality. the first sip revealed the smooth and creamy taste, but the burning of my digestive tract soon became too distracting. this was infinitely less drinkable than the speedway. i feel that it needs to mask the brutal alcohol a bit more, or just scale down the abv. maybe a year or two in the cellar might have done the trick, but i only bought one bottle. i guess i'll never know...",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,StargherKing,4.03,"I was a little confused on this one, expected a Chocolate Stout, but it's listed as a Russian Imperial on here.

Coffee, malts, cocoa...and hops. Russian Imperial it is, haha. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, with just a hint of an oily feel. Drinkability is good, especially for such a rich beer.

Dancing dark chocolate and coffee flavors with a hint of fruit and of something dry and grassy; warming alcohol that helps dry out the finish to slightly bitter dark chocolate and coffee flavors.  Big, thick, and chewy; thoroughly satisfying.  I'd have to call this my absolute favorite. I doubt I'd have more than one at a time, but with a beer this good, there's no need to.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

A-pours a very rich dark brown with a small but fluffy mocha head. good lacing for a Russian Imperial Stout  S-Dark chocolate, espresso and roasted malt are present as is a nice dose of the alcohol. When you stick your nose in it you get some dried red fruits.  T-That sweet chocolate taste hits you at first spreading wonderfully over the tongue follwed by a roasted coffee like malt. As it goes down your chest it warms you and you can feel the alcohol which isnt in the taste too much. A nice underlying bitterness is there which nicely balances the sweetness from the malt.  M-In a word-chewy. If someone would ask me how a beer is chewy, i would direct them here.

This Imperial Stout poured a totally opaque black with a nice big dark tan head that resulted from an aggressive pour. The head slowly faded away, leaving behind a thick, heavy lacing around the glass. The aroma of this stout was very lightly roasted malts and some chocolate. I was expecting quite a bit more out of the aroma. The flavor did not dissapoint , however. It was made up of nice roasted malts, chewy bittersweet chocolate, licorice, and a bit of molasses. The mouthfeel was definately full-bodied. Very thick and chewy, with miniamal carbonation. This was a very nice beer that I would like to revisit at some point in time.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Durge,3.48,"I have to begin by saying that I had a bottle of this at a friend's house and it was obvious that it had been sitting in the back of his fridge for at least a year I would say. That being said, this brew looked incredible when I poured it into my mug. Solid coffee black, but the head was disappointing, perhaps due to the age of this bottle. The smell was very different, not as overwhelming as I would have thought but I picked up roasted pecans and a lot of prune. You could detect a high alcohol content. The first sip comes on as heavy and coats the tongue with a bit of coffee and a heavy raisin flavor. There is a liquor feel and the carbonation faded pretty quickly (in this old bottle). I get a little charcoal at the finish but I am surprised to miss the chocolate. This seems to be all about the raisin/prune idea and it seems like some prominent chocolate flavor would really tone this down more to my liking, but I didn't get that here. Again, perhaps a fresher bottle would have done the trick. A few friends gave it a try and everyone found it to be a taste experience. Not really up my alley too much, though.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bark,4.23,"Vintage 06-07, ABV 9.6%.  The beer pours slowly and completely silent. The liquid is black; the finger thick brown head slowly sinks down to a lid leaving some very nice lacing. Floating luxury  The smell fills the entire room: Heavily roasted malts, black coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa and bitter almonds. Some notes of wood ageing and matured strong wine.  The almost overwhelming taste is strong, balanced and extravagant. Dry bitterness blends with creamy roasted chocolate/coffee/nut flavours. The aftertaste is surprisingly bitter with some notes of red wine, expensive chocolate and coffee liquor. And you know what? Not a trace of all that alcohol  The carbonation is very strong. Lots of microscopic soft bubbles fill my mouth. The liquid is very smooth and creamy.

And Brooklyn beers final made it to Indiana.  Make no mistake this is how beer should look, 3 fingers of chocolate brown head, thick and foamy, sits on top of a beautiful ink black body. Leaves nice lace. Nose is of rich roasted malts, and dark cordial chocolates = like a bakery meets a chocolatier. Enters the mouth sweet like Godiva. The cordial hints come thru on the way to a nice long dark chocolate/burnt malt bitter. Alchol is slightly up-front. Nice belly warmer.

The head stick around for a very long time, and leaves behind a thick sheeting of lace.  Smell; dark roasted malts, chocolate, molasses and coffee. Some hints of soy sauce and licorice are present as well as some dark fruits. There's definitely plenty going on in the aroma of this one.  Taste; lots of bittersweet chocolate at first, then coffee, licorice and a touch of that soy sauce I noticed in the aroma. A bit of rum soaked raisins is present, but over all the alcohol is a bit more tame than I was expecting. Could be due to that fact this has a few months on it.  Mouthfeel is full bodied with a velvety smooth mouthfeel, and a good drinkabilty.

Smells of mocha and espresso, with a hint of brandy soaked cherry. Very appetizing.  Roasted and chocolate malts wallop the palate, echoing the smell and adding a vague spiciness and possibly apricot and raspberry.  This beer is very smooth and rich, but the bitter bite at the end from the roasted malt keeps the finish dry and prevents it from being syrupy.  Can't taste the big 10.6 abv, delicious enough to have another. Great offering from Brooklyn.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,peabody,3.8,Pours out very black and with one finger of dark tan suds. Smell of coffee and chocolate with a yeast that burns the nose. Taste is bitter chocolate with dark raspberry and cherry. The bitterness comes through at the end. Drys out the mouth and makes you come back for more. Kind of a dirty mouthfeel but in a nice way. This is a good beer from a great company. You can't really tell the 10.6% here so this might be a good session beer if you were trying to pass out! Still a great beer.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Taste is big and bold too, with huge chocolate taste mixed with blackcurrants and licorice, and the big ABV noticible in the finish. Mouthfeel is thick as all get out, and with noticible carbonation, and drinkability is pretty good, though tempered by the alcohol that starts to catch up by the end of the bottle.

Sweet esters of fresh fruit, prunes and raisins. Some aggressive chocolate tinged alcohol on the finish (similar to a good Irish whiskey like Redbreast 12), a slight vinous quality at the end also.  A big bold aggressive stout. The black chocolate is a fitting name as it really contains an awfully lot of rich dark chocolate aroma and flavour.

45,680,YankChef,3.78,"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter  Appearance: Pitch b;ack with a dark tan/yellow colored head about 1/4 inch thick head that quickly dissipated leaving a little foam around the outside  Smell: Scent of sweet espresso, heavily roasted malt and chocolate  Taste: Flavor is of very rich, extremely dark bittersweet chocolate and a linger flavor of espresso and roasted malt. Alcohol is extremely well masked  Mouthfeel: Very low carbonation, very smooth  Overall: Black chocolate is a great description for this stout, very dark unsweetened chocolate flavors as well as espresso flavors make this a complex treat. Alcohol is very well masked, this one is definitely a sipper however. For a buck 50 a bottle this beer is a steal.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MCDuhamel,4.75,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a brandy snifter at cellar temperature. 2006 bottling.  A: Poured pitch black with a very thin head that immediately collapsed into a thin ring around the edge of the snifter. Very little lacing; none, really. Not surprising for the style, but not a particularly pretty beer.  S: Wow. Bitter chocolate is immediately present, with a slight spiciness, much like a Mexican drinking chocolate. Really remarkable.  T: Again, bitter cocoa, followed by dried fig and a deep molasses flavor, supported by just enough bitterness and carbonation to prevent it from becoming cloying. There is a very pleasant dry and bitter lingering finish that offsets the sweetness of the first impression. Absolutely wonderful; heaven in a glass.  M: This is a HUGE beer, and it fills the mouth and palate immediately. Despite its enormous presence, it avoids being sticky or unpleasantly coating.  D: This is a great sipping beer. One is plenty.  Overall: This is my favorite imperial stout. It is an immense beer that manages deftly to avoid the cloying chewiness of many other American attempts at the style. I wish I had the patience to see what years in the cellar would do to this beer, by I have trouble keeping a 6 pack around much longer than 5 months. Mr. Oliver has proven once again that he is a true grand master of the art of brew craft.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BeerBelcher,3.71,"This beer is much less chocolate-y than others with that word in their title, but that is not a bad thing. This is a stout with a bit of sour and oaky flavor, which make it quite unique.  Appearance is extremely dark with a good amount of tan head. Aroma is extremely caramel malty, with some chocolate and bourbon notes...the maltiness definitely comes before the chocolate. Flavor is somewhat sour and oaky, with some bourbon notes. Chocolate is definitely less pronounced than most beers that have the word ""chocolate"" in their description, but that's not a bad thing. Mouthfeel is slightly sticky and yet astringent at the same time. This is a very interesting beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,sloejams,4.28,"I keep liking all these stouts as you can see. This one I acquired from the Secret Bunny BIF (thanks Alkey). I remember drinking this back in my eastside days. It's pretty damn good.  This combines the best of the Russian Imperial Stout and the Sweet Stout to one particular thick and creamy tasty beer. It's thick and resiny, with a slight cappuccino head. Dark chocolate and espresso dominate the nose. Very full with little subtleties. The taste is quite filling - full of the chocolate and coffee flavors with some roasted malt and even a bite of vanilla.  This has become an East Coast classic. Worth looking for this one.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mountdew1,3.88,"06-07 vintage poured into an imperial pint glass. Very dark brown, almost opaque black color with a nice rich brown head. Lacing that lasted the whole pint ringing the surface, as well as clinging to the sides. When I first poured I caught whiffs of coffee, chocolate, and yeast. Last sniffs picked up some sweetness, and still some chocolate. Initially very bitter and almost acidic. As it warmed up, either in the glass or my mouth I could definately pick out chocolate flavorings. The warmer it got, the more chocolate came out. Reminded me of a dark chocolate, and was slighty bitter like a good dark chocolate is. The bitterness/acidity lingered on the tounge and in the mouth too long for me to completely enjoy the beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,smurphy77,4.28,"Beautiful beer. Sampled this beer at Tria and from the moment the server began the pour (from a good distance away) I could smell the complexity. Actually caught a whiff of bananas which didn't resurface again...  Foamy cappucino colored head when poured that dissipated relatively quickly. What was left was a very dark brown beer, almost but not quite black. First of all, I have to say that this beer is a mouthfull. The body is wonderfully thick without being the least bit syrupy. Strong accents of chocolate and coffee augment the rich roasted malt flavors. The high alcohol wasn't obvious to me. Fairly bitter aftertaste. Very nice interpretation of the style.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bigman147,4.16,A: Poured into a Imperial stout glass. Pours a dark black slightly syrupy. The head is full and thick fading a lingering creme like a great espresso. Lacing on the glass is wonderful.  S: Smells of roasted malts and slight coffee. Alcohol is present on the nose and tends to help offer up trace dried fruits (dates and cherries).  T: Taste of roasted malts with some chocolate. The sweetness tends to help balance the palate and help to create a creaminess that is not readily present. A sharp bitterness of coffee (caffeine) and carbonation. Slight alcohol burn in the throat makes you remember how high the alcohol content is. Its a pleasant warming though.  M: Creamy with good carbonation that has a sharp bite to it.  D: It is as drinkable as you can imagine from a 10%ABV Imperial Stout. I could imagine drinking one (maybe 2) 12oz bottles in a session but beyond that this beer would be hard to just sit and drink. I am impressed and pleasantly surprised.

Massive and firm dark tan colored three finger head. As the head gradually recedes it leaves spotty chunks of lace on the glass.  S: Big aromas of bitter dark chocolate, espresso roast coffee, roasted malt, alcohol, cherries, and caramel.  T: The bitter chocolate strikes first, followed by cherrry, espresso, molassas, raisins, plums, figs, roasted malt, alcohol, toffee, and some bitter hops in the finish thrown in for good measure. The finish starts tart and bitter and ends up pretty sweet.  M: Big and bitter. Tart and fruity. Quite slick and sticky.  D: Very drinkable for the abv, but, look out!

45,680,objectivemonkey,4.25,"Into a pint glass, pours a very dark black brown, dark tan head that recedes to a thin film, bubbly, lacing falls down in sheets, doesn't stick. The aroma dark and chocolaty, of course, molasses, roasted malts bequeathing coffee, and some of hopped bitterness.  The taste is long awaited, much appreciated. Dark, malty, good deal of chocolate going on but not a ton, which I can appreciate. The balance here in stouty goodness is marvelous, bittersweet, espresso coffee grounded great great great. The mouth is pretty damn smooth, a bit chewy, very full in body, lovely. This isn't quite my favorite big boy stout, but I'm so very glad I traded for a sixer of it. A classic, for sure.

45,680,trevorwideman,4.12,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Thanks to vanrassel for this bottle and the other one I'll try in a year or two...  Pours black as a foggy moonless night with a 1/2 inch lovely tan coloured head. Subsides slowly leaving some nice lacing. Intense aromatics! Dark fruity aromas that meld into herbal and medicinal aromas. Bassett's Liquorice Allsorts, brandy, chocolate, roasted malt, a bit of alcohol. Wowee wow, and it's all there in full force, no subtlety here.  Taste is no less than the nose suggests, big and bold and brash and flavourful. Sour notes meld well with the bold roasted malt and dark chocolate/cocoa flavours. Fruitiness in the background, plums and raisins. Medicinal and herbal notes are prevalent as well. The flavours are there and they are amazing, but I find they don't meld together as much as they complement each other. Mouthfeel is about right, not overcarbonated, but enough to push the flavours around the mouth. Heavy heavy body as expected with a drying finish. More than one of these will knock you on your ass and make it hard to get up in the morning I'd think, but it goes down pretty well I'd say. I'm excited to see how this ages, well done Brooklyn.  Jan. 27, 2009 - Aroma is still intense as ever, but the carbonation and head have deadened quite a bit. Flavours are still balls-out with a slight hint of the papery edge that beers begin to get after a few years. Still a very enjoyable sipper though for a cold winter night.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,tapman,4.45,"Ah, an exceptional Imperial. Not for the faint of palate, I drank one 12 oz. bottle per day for 6 days and found something new every time.  A pitch black body wears its russett brown head like a crown, which it wears for some time.  Burnt rye toast with New Dark Chocolate Nutella covers the smell pretty well (what can I say, it just came to me one day...dark chocolate nutella is popular in Germany for sure, yum.)  Upon tasting this brew I discovered that there was less burnt as there were roasted malts. Also, I noticed less chocolate in the taste.My nose had been deceived. Am I to believe that burnt and chocolate combined in mid-swig? I doubt it. It is the time spent pondering this conundrum that makes this beer truly great for me. The alcohol is pretty strong, though. What chocolate there is does a great job of masking it while tangy hops and roasted malts sit at opposite ends of the taste spectrum from alcohol. Malts and hops act as mediators with the chocolate kicking some ass in a 1-2 combination of flavor.  Thick and syrupy!  Like I said earlier these brews were enjoyed over a longer-than-average time span is exquisite, but due to a 10%+ ABV after 2 of these I could see the senses dulled enough to not get your money's worth for this beer. Truly a brew best enjoyed in moderation.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BDTyre,4.58,"I find American interpretations of imperial stouts tend to be hit-or-miss. They're either just right or seem to come off as over done.  This falls into the hit category. Abyss-black with a very thin deep tan head. Even held up to the light, there are no ruby hints.  Vinous, roasted malt smell with a strong presence of coffee and cocoa. Bitter, dark chocolate and coffee bean taste. Slight winey hints and barely detectable traces of hops.  Nice thick and chewy mouthfeel. Carbonation is very light and only barely detectable. The only downpoints are that this is not as chocolatey as I had hoped for and as it warms it can become a bit on the bitter side. Drinkable, but with a powerful ABV.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,CharlieMopps,4.02,"A: From a vigorous pour, nearly two fingers of dense, light brown head atop an impossibly black body, with no light whatsoever getting through. Looked pretty damn tasty.  S: Nice deep cocoa tones, with a slightly alcoholic and coffee-like smell also present. Seemed to be some sort of dark fruity aroma that lurked in the background as well.  T: The intro starts out unassumingly enough, with inviting roasted and burnt malt goodness, but yields quickly to a surprisingly sharp taste in the middle. An alcoholic and hoppy bite take over toward the end and deliver a smooth aftertaste that washes away most of the syrupy texture. This is an interesting and tasty twist, and this stout keeps it lively.  M: Carbonation level seems just right to suit this beer, and the mouthfeel transitions with the flavors, which is nice. At first a creamy and bubbly beast, its other characteristics slice right through and offer a crisp, pleasant aftertaste.  D: Because of the possibility of being bored with another run-of-the-mill stout, this one surprised me and did so with its unique flavor transition. Reminded me of other strong style stouts, but had its own flair, and for that, I give it a salute for keeping my tastebuds awake while masking the alcohol in a good way.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,SacoDeToro,4,"Vintage 2004 bottle.  The beer poured a deep coal black with a small brown head.  The aroma of the beer was full of rich chocolate, roasted malts, black coffee, and some faint vanilla. The high alcohol helped carry the aroma brilliantly.  The flavor of the beer was full of intense flavors that transitioned well from one to another. Coffee - Chocolate - Rich roasted malts. The hops were there in good presence, but reasonably mellowed.  The mouthfeel was thick and slightly syrupy. It coated your mouth with a ton of flavor. The carbonation seemed dialed in well.  This is a great beer and a very drinkable RIS.

45,680,jackorain,4.1,"This beer pours an amzing pitch black color with no light getting through. There is a nice 3/4 inch head that stays around for a few minutes until settling to a nice thin cost and ring that leaves some lacing on the glass.  The smell is of roasted barley malt, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, strong coffe or even a starbucks latte. There is a minimal aroma of green hops.  The taste is very complex with chocoalte, roasted malt, carmel malt, chocolate, strong coffe, baker's chocolate. Most of the bitterness (which is not high) seems to come from the roasted malt. There is only minimal hop bitterness showing through. In the middle there is a sweetness that is not to much on the pallete but seems to offer some balance to the other flavors. The finish is of semi-sweet choclate or dark choclate.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and extremly creamy  Drinkability is not that high as the alcohol on this one is quite high and well hidden. After one 12 ounce you are already strting to feel the buzz.  Overall: Excellent-This is a very complex flavored beer with a great mouthfeel and fantastic aroma. The taste while complex, does not seem to offer the level of hop/roasted bitterness I expect from a Russion Imperial Stout (storm King, Old Rasputin, etc.). The well hidden alcohol is both a positive and a negative. It is a positive because it is not as boozy as some in this style (Storm King) but it can sneak up on you quickly.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Initially, it was way too cold and all I could smell was chocolate. As the beer warmed up, it became much more complex, with layered chocolate, some black malt, vanilla, molasses, and a little bit of coffee.  Tastes like it smells, but even more chocolaty and with some phenols and alcoholic spiciness that complement the flavor and body nicely.  Mouthfeel is heavy and slick.

Obviously, I was selective about drinking it...I wanted it to last.  Poured into a nice big mug. Minimal tan head which subsided quickly. A bit of tan lacing as you go. Smells of chocolate, naturally, and some coffee as well. Tastes of dark roasted malt, some chocolate and espresso undertones. It feels a little thick in the mouth, but not annoyingly so. Goes down nice and easy.  Overall, an oustanding stout, on par with the best of them.

T - More of espresso than coffee with a hint of chocolate and alcohol  M - Warm but dry, due to the alcohol content  D - The finish was dry with a lasting espresso roast into the aftertaste.

Soft tan head pours one finger thick and quickly dissolves into a micro bubble ring aroung the edges of the glass.  S: Roasted coffee. Dark chocolate. Burnt grain. Dark fruit. Alcohol.  T: Deep roasted coffee and dark bitter chocolate dominate the front end of this brew. Hops flash in quickly and are taken over by an astrigent malt character. Sweetness of dark fruit is swallowed by more chocolate. Beer finishes with a strong warming alcohol.  M: Smooth and full bodied. Minimal carbonation. Warm and dry.

The same nice black body with thick head, but this one settled down much quicker than the previous batches'.  Nose is baker's chocolate with a bit of fruityness that I am just not a fan of. It's a nice nose, but a bit funky homebrew character.  Taste is full, rich, bakers' chocolate and a slightly bit toasty. Bold flavors up front but a slightly green-tasting aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is nice and thick and shallowly-carbonated, and drinkability is OK for a beer this big, but I've had much better.

The flavor is nice, loaded with cholocate, cocoa, licorice, dark toast, and coffee. The bitter finish hangs around in the mouth. The alcohol is present, too, and lends itself toward a fermented cranberry note too. Overall, very yummy. Appropriately, it's very creamy and chewy, nicely carbonated. It's easy to drink, as it's so delicious, but the alcohol becomes more obvious as time goes on, so I couldn't pack these in.

I had been holding off on a review until I was sure that I could do it justice, but after tonight, which was my fifth tasting, I think I've got a good idea.  So tonight, from a 12 oz 2006-07 release, it pours a gorgeous obsidian black with about a finger and a half of leather-colored head. The head remained for about four minutes or so, before receding into lace. This is really surprising given the 10.6% ABV.  The smell. Oh man. Molasses, rum, vanilla, ripe cherries, and booze.  As for the taste, it has a gorgeous chocolate taste. Not overly chocolatey. Not cloying. Not artificial chocolate. Just good, dark chocolate. But it is so much more than that. Well-defined and well-balanced notes of molasses, dark rum, and plums are also at the forefront. Vanilla and possibly anis dance around my palate.  Delicious mouthfeel. Just the right amount of heavy, slick body for a Russian Imperial. Viscous, meaty, and velvety smooth, it goes down super-easy for 10.6% ABV.  As far as drinkabiity, you're not going to play Beirut with this. But that would be blasphemy anyway.  Outstanding.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Cwrw,4.15,"Winter 06-07 edition.  Comes in the 330ml black bottle and logo, and indeed the Brooklyn beers are fairly plain in appearance. And then coming in the equally unimpressive style of their six pack, I wasn't expecting much. That is, IF I didn't know of the reputation of this stout. The neck label gives a little blurb about imperial stouts.  The beers pours into my snifter a SOLID ebony, with only hints of ruby or dark brown near the edges. This is no faux-black beer. The head is substantial and more red than brown. Absolutely impenetrable colour and a rich red head makes for a lovely looking elixir. Good lacing as icing on the cake.  The smell is ambrosial: first and foremost is a strong licorice/sweet rum aroma. The alcohol is definitely popping its head out of this one, but it's masked nicely by hints of blackcurrant, maple, and massive hits of strong black espresso. Dusty malts here, almost like sniffing pepper. But besides all this are the dark fruits of dried prune, plum, and plenty of red grape. Coming in later as the beer warms even more are some lactose, sweet-cream aromas.Yes, wine-like. But damn better than any red I've tried. Absolutely full of all the maltiness an imperial should have, and more. Near-perfect.  The fullness of the beer hits before the taste does. This is a syrupy, velvety, full feel alright. Adorable. It hits that perfect balance between being cloying, and being cloud-like on the tongue. The malts tower above any other taste like Zeus above the gods. Wow, dry and dusty, almost tannin-like aftertaste. Tons of coffee similarities, and red-grapes. The chocolate was not so detectable to me as the full on mocha/espresso tastes. A great deal of salinity here too, from the roasted malts. But unlike some imperials, this one does it in balance...I'm not left gagging for water after each sip. But the finish definitely shouts ""fresh coffee beans."" Nice.  The beer will deceivingly catch up to you pretty quick, so easy does it. The beer is easy to drink, but it IS filling. Oddly enough I found the saltiness of the malts caught up with me forcing me to stop. Still, this is one hell of a stout, and the alcohol is masked ever so nicely in the taste. World class.  Paired well with a roast beef sandwich and a slice of brie, incidentally.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,cichief,4.14,"From the 2006-07 vintage.  I have loved this beer since 1995. It pours jet black, with a beautiful brown head of foam. It smells sweet, of chocolate and coffee. The taste is powerful, sweet, but balanced, with espresso and chololate overtones, a little licorice in the finish. It is quite smoothe in the mouth, surprisingly little alcohol burn for a beer of this strength. At 10.6%, it is not a beer to be consumed in volume, but enjoyed sip by sip. A prize to be found.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,matsputis,4.37,"Pitch black with light brown head. It didn't foam up much, but it laced the glass well. The smell was mostly chocolate... lots of it, sweet caramel maltiness, and a slight prickle of alcohol. The taste was incredible. It had this awesome strong bittersweet chocolate taste. Very far from cloying, yet it was almost like drinking a dark chocolate bar especially with the thickness. The mouthfeel was very full, heavy, extremely rich, velvet. And as far as drinkability goes, I could drink the whole sixpack but I think I would get full after two - so rich. I couldn't detect the alcohol because the chocolate was so rich.

Very chewy as to be expected, but the carbonation level seemed a bit high compared to other stouts I've sampled  a definite dessert beer and a good one at that..will put the other 5 in the cellar to sample a few years from now.  tried one from the cellar and wow! after a year the beer has mellowed by a factor of 5 at least.

Aroma of dark roasted malts, chocolate, ripe plums, raisins, and alcohol. This is one rich beer. Creamy Chocolate malt and coffee flavor gives way to dark fruits and warm alcohol as I work through the glass.  This is a full bodied, thick stout with minimal carbonation. A nice sipper to say the least.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BMoney575,4.37,"Sampled on 3-2-07 Winter 06-07 bottling  Pours a pitch black with slight tan head that doesn't stick around. Not much lacing to speak of.  Smells of dark chocolate, molasses, with a good smokiness.  Taste is very good. Chocolate malt is very apparent, but without being sweet. Strong malt character with good smoke flavor. Only aged for about four months, so a good hoppy finish still remains.  Mouthfeel is also very good. Thick, chewy, this is a stout that doesn't disappoint.  Drinkability is good for an RIS, although the flavor reallt build on the palate.  Overall a very good example of a beer brewed with chocolate malt. Not overtly chocolaty and with alot of other flavors as well. This is a standard in my cellar.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Erdinger2003,3.64,"Pours a beautiful big head that looks fluffy and strong. Reminds me of the Rogue Chocolate Stout. The color is jet black and lets no light through whatsoever. Leaves a great lacing behind and the head doesn't fall and break away hardly at all. Smell is a little light. I smell a little bit of chocolate and some coffee. There's also some vanilla. There seems to be a bit of an off flavor, but maybe it's just in the smell. Nope, somthing's up with this beer, I can't taste any alcohol burn, but there is a burnt toast flavor that is in the aftertaste after some sweet flavors, and that's not great. It's a very burnt flavor mixed with a green characteristic, not a lot of chocolate I noticed. The mouthfeel was very good, something to remember, overall I will try this again in a year, I have more, and see how it's doing, but it's not too impressive right now.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,pgenius,4.35,"A: Completely dark with a nice dark brown head that lingers for a while  S: Very strong malty chocolate aroma  T: Full of bitter sweet chocolate flavor, nice malts and roasted barley.

45,680,Phocion,3.83,"This one courtesy of MotoRacerX36, 06-07. Poured a deep coal black with the lightest hue of red when held up to the light and a thin but creamy dark beige head. Retention leaves a bit to be desired, but very beautiful lacing around the glass and an appealing crown.  Aroma is....not that I should be surprised, but overpoweringly cocoa. Espresso present as well, but noticeably devoid of any hoppiness.  The taste echoes the aroma rather well. Dark, rich chocolate with a strong somewhat burnt coffee taste following. Still no hops present, but the alcohol is definitely not trying to hide itself. Just the slightest hint of a sweet malty finish.  Very thick and creamy mouthfeel, velvety-smooth. The taste seems a little raw and unrefined, but nonetheless a good example of an imperial stout. I definitely won't be afraid to try it again, and it did hit the spot perfectly on a cold winter night like tonight.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mmcave,4.4,"Good bye bells you will be sorely missed, in return hello Brooklyn with a strong start. Purchased this recently available brew at sam's.  Batch Winter 06-07 I was told not to chill, but I did and then I let it sit out about fifteen, served just below room into a nonic, head rose and fell I will assume its my glass wear (got put in the dishwasher). Head is a dark kaki, gray color, with thin yet sticky lacing. The body is oily mahogany and completely opaque. Smell is robust, with great complex rich malt notes, hints of coffee on the outer edge rounded out by a well blended chocolate, and raison character, non of these are too pervasive, they simply add to a bigger better complex flavor. I get some toasted dark malts with hints of anise and as it warms up it becomes smokey, salty earthy and great, like a delicious piece of bark (if that makes sense). Taste is meaty and chewy, very nice complexity, subtle and hearty blend of taste sensation. IBU is in a very drinkable place, balanced well and aids in the flavor perfectly. I am crazy about this beer especially, because a sixer is about 10 bucks, its delicious and strong. I will definitely by this again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BassAssassin,4.58,"--2006 Vintage--  A: Nearly black in color with a thick, tan head. Head disappears quickly, however, it leaves nice lacing down the sides of the glass.  S: Immediate scent of black licorice followed by burnt malt and hints of raisins. Faint, tea-like aroma of hops. Alcohol scent is well hidden.  T: Rich, complex malt dominates this brew. Taste is definitely on the sweet side. Roasted malt flavors shine through. Subtle hints of dried fruit and dark chocolate. Tea-like hop finish is perfect for this brew. Alcohol warmth is felt by mid glass. Its taste is well hidden, however.  M: Low level of carbonation lends a smooth mouthfeel to this beer. Thick and full bodied, just as an imperial stout should be.  D: A sipper for sure. This one is perfect for a cold winter's night. A sure bet year after year. This could possibly be my favorite beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BuckSpin,4.42,"Presentation: 11oz bottle in a classic Guinness style flared pint glass  This has been on my short list of beers to try for a while, and I finally get the chance.  Big nose of black, no, burnt coffee. Thick, traces of licorice, deep, molasses, ironically mild chocolate tones initially but they become more apparent as it warms, warm raisins, nuts, wood, deep malts yet soft, some alcohol sharpness and hop bitters dance.  Head was a crazy 2 fingers of lively, bouyant, tight mocha foam that settled to about a 1/4"" of cover, lacing the sides in splotches. It poured thick, viscous, oily, the deepest ebony burnt umber-black, maybe some ruby port light peeking thru at the glass bottom.  Oh, this is luscious. Smooth, velvety is the best term to describe the feeling on the tongue. A surprising, subtle quality of dried pit fruits like cherry. This is a sipper. It commands a little time, earning my respect. Its very even up front as the sweetly bittered malts, no, a seriously dark baking chocolate, play with the hops, a nice molasses quality to it. It softens on the pallete, allowing the malts to shine thru, some tannins are noticable. The finish is a nice left hook of alcohol as it rises from the throat thru the nasal cavities, opening up my senses to more experiences as a nice sweetness rises up and comforts the mouth before it disappears in a nice, dried fruitlike finish that coats what is not alreadt numb in my mouth from the high ABV.  A surprisingly smooth Imperial Stout. I've head some that were more brutish & raw (GLBC Blackout) and I thoroughly enjoyed this. Matter of fact, I am craving another one so that I might enjoy it slower, more relaxed. Thats the word - relaxed. If you are looking for a Russian Imperial Stout that is ""relaxed"" check this out. An outstanding beer, and one that will definitely move off the short list of ""got to try"" and onto the short list of ""must have every winter"". Highly recommeded.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,penguinjive7,4.22,"Pours an absolutely pitch black color with a small, light brown head and minimal lacing.  Smells like dark, unsweetened chocolate, molasses and alcohol.  The first flavor to hit the tongue is espresso followed by the powerful unsweetened chocolate. Alcohol is present, but not overpowering. A hint of bitterness towards the end along with a more burnt flavor.  Mouthfeel is definitely very full bodied, not not syrupy. Carbonation is perfect, and the combination is quite pleasing.  I definitely could not drink more than one of these at a time. This is a very heaving and mighty stout.  An excellent example of a Russian Imperial Stout. Mighty in every way. One of the best I have had to date.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,rohrbachsfan,3.16,"Appearance: Opaque black.  Smell: Like espresso roasted coffee but with strong alcohol/solvent-like odors present  Taste: Heavy roasted flavor.

45,680,mikesgroove,4.36,"Much thanks to jaxon53 for getting me this, been a long time coming!  Poured deep black as midnight with a huge creamy head the would not fade till the end. Thick gooey lace that stuck to and clouded up the glass. This looks thick like a milk shake, gottta love it. Smell was very nice big chocolate as you would expect but hints of alcohol as well. Caramel, sugar and vanilla round it very nicely, perfect dessert. This tatstes very yummy, deep dark chocolate flavors, with a slight alcohol warming, wonderful creamy feel. This is very nice. Dry finish, smooth and for 10.5% abv it is very drinkable. I only wish I was able to get more for the cellar, as I feel this will only improve with time! Great beer and glad I could try it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Liquids,3.59,"The pour may have been nitro, but this beer took five minutes or more to settle and was like a third of a glass of beer and half head after the first poart of the pour...totally thick and creamy. The head was ultra brown. Thing of beauty. Smell was hoppy imperial stout, with that slightly stale aroma I notice in a lot of brooklyn stuff--floral hops in style, but more of dying flowers. Taste was full and similar to the aroma, add a roasty smooth malt flavor that was appealing and very drinkable, but as it warmed the stringing alcohol, and dying flowers poked through. It's not that the taste was bad, but big beers and stouts, other than alcohol, tend to have the taste (and score) bias due to the intensity of flavors compared to paler-malted brews. This doesn't mean they taste better, they just stand out more. Given the style, the flavor here was on par and average for a typically above-average style. This does not mean it tasted bad, it tasted delicious, it just lacked a certain something to put it over the top in the catergory, flavor wise. Mouthfeel was unmistakably full, and points given for the beer-head-mustache I had on the first sip. This beer slammed me on an empty-other-than-peanuts stomach, and I didn't totally realize it was 10% until too late. Half the glass was still full after about ten minutes, but I had to put her down for 20 minutes and sip slowly after that, as I started floating.  I've had better, but this is a good brew. Of note, I didn't like it in the bottle when I tried it last year, but I would get this on tap again, despite the generally 'middle of the road' ratings.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ahking,3.99,"Needless to say, this beer pours a jet black. A beautiful tan head appears then retreats to the outer ring. Aroma is pungent with raisins, licorice, prunes, and chocolate. Flavor is ripping with plum, raisin, anise, and a citrus burst in the finish. Can't believe someone could make a drink like this simply from roasted malts. There is cocoa in the middle, but it doesnt resound with chocolate as much as Bell's Expedtion stout. Likewise the hop bitterness is slightly less here, however, well balanced. There is a slight trail off in fullness as you swallow which makes this beer more moderate and drinkable. However, with the ABV as high as it is, you probably would not be able to drink a whole six pack in an evening. Rich and complex with an alcohol burn. Completely recommended and I am putting a couple bottles down to age. I could see a bottle of this really coming into its own after a year or two.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,vanrassel,4.17,"This beer poured utterly opaque into my pint glass with a dense, one-finger head that reduced to a resilient creamy ring. Nice aroma of dark chocolate (duh) black cherries, coffee grounds and roasted barley.  Dark chocolate is definitely apparent in the taste, but it's cut with a bitter coffee jolt right up front -- though it's not necessarily a bad thing. The coffee's bitter, but not burnt. The alcohol is extremely well-hidden, though it does contribute to a considerable warming effect as you go. The taste gets a little grainy as it warms, but overall this is an extremely smooth beer with a silky mouthfeel.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,tempest,3.87,"Winter 06-07 Vintage  This is a beer with great potential. Looks pitch black with a tan head. Has a rich dark chocolate aroma, this is the best part of the beer.  Taste has a slightly grainy quality, similar to heavily toasted triscuit, mellow flavor overall with a little sherry-like cocoa flavor. taste finished with the same rich cocoa from the aroma with fresh dark-roasted coffee. Alcohol isnt completely hidden, and is still a little hot. Balancing bitteness, dry, similar to a red wine. Make no mistake this is a sipping beer.  Could use some aging. This is a beer with great potential, but the flavor feels like it is budding rather than flowering. buy a 6er and hide it your closet for a year or two. Its the only way IMO.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BlindPig,4.42,"A- Thin dark mocha head on a black body. S- Really big rich chocolate aroma. Very light hints of grass hops. T- Huge malt flavors flood the mouth. Chocolate, and light roasted malts. Hops are trying to balance out the malts and leave a nice medium bitterness on the tongue. This stays around with a nice chocolate flavor too. You get a nice warming from the alcohol. M- Low carbonation but still a tad to high for such a rich beer. I think it could be a bit lower. Big full body which fits the beer perfectly.

Anyway, served in a pint glass, a beautiful opaque black with hints of brown and a small dark black head. Excellent so far. Nose is heavy roasted malts, sweet chocolate, and the slightest hint of sweet ethanol on warming. Taste is nice thick roasted malts with hints of milk chocolate, and lingering bitter chocolate in the finish. A little bit syrupy. Full mouthfeel, quite smooth. Drinkability is good, but watch out for that ABV. I had no idea this was over 10%, the alcohol is very well hidden.

My palate is satified as a Sharpshinned hawk dives for a thirteen lined ground squirrel that has recently brought its heartbeat up brom 5 beats/min to 350 as it rides off the ground in the encircling tallons of the predator.  Like the birds of prey I swoop down on this RIS, fill my mouth and become intoxicated with the moment. Can't you smell that smell of roasted malt, chocolate, fruity esters and CH3CH2OH with chocolate taking the center stage of my 0.4L Rastal sniffer. The opaque dark Chocolate Stout topped with a fine bubbled rich brown head and lace with enough ABV to start to show some leg quickly kills the handsome head leaving only lace and a ring.  Rich deep and complex malts and moderately strong esters suggesting dark fruit combine in the flawless molten chocolate alcohol. The Stout answers the question of the song with a resounding YES - I will remember you tomorrow. Dry dark roasted malts with a nearly full mouthfeel and flawless alcoholic warmth is well carbonated allowing it to expand and fill the mouth. Just short of chewy mouthfeel it wants a bigger body especially as it efferescesses off its CO2 and warms bring on more complexity.  Sweet love! A Feeling of roasty, fruity and bittersweet (somewhat restrained Amercian version of RIS showing off hops and roasted malts) combine bitterness of Dark Chocolate's initial sweetness that transitions to lingering roastiness and hop bitterness that makes this a wonderful and classic example that is nearly flawless.

45,680,IronDjinn,4.03,"Picked a 6 of this up over the holidays at the Sherbrooke Liquor Store while in Edmonton. Available down here in Calgary as well. My last bottle, time to review...  A deep dark opaque stout if there ever was one, well along the lines of the style. Tall creamy tan head that leaves lacing even as it recedes to a thickish creamy cap.  Rich creamy roasted malts on the nose, dark chocolate, licorice root, then getting into dark dried fruits like dates and raisins, turning vinuous with the alcohol presenting itself.  Surprisingly the flavour of this whammy of an Imperial Stout (at 10.6% abv) is fairly subtle. Roasted malt, some licorice, some dark chocolate, hints of esperesso, but it's all very contained.  Smooth mouthfeel, medium-bodied for the most part, and very velvety.  Incredibly drinkable stout, especially for what it is, and that is a tasty time-bomb waiting to go off--the alcohol content isn't really noticable until after a bottle has been downed, and you're reaching for another one already. And then the trouble becomes apparent. Best to share this with friends.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

There is a very dark fruit smell to this beer and I do smell some phenols? I dont know if im using that word right.  Not as ""stout"" as other ""RIS"" The roasted taste isnt as prominant as other 'RIS"" ive had in the past.I taste more fruit then choco. in the aftertaste .Plum taste is very evident.

Booze soaked cherries throughout. Huge lingering notes of chocolate and coffee.  Mouthfeel: Amazing. Smooth and lush. Coats your mouth and glides off the tongue.  Drinkability: Suffers a bit with the high abv (10.6%) but very smooth and tasty.  Overall: An extremely delicious stout. I have had this many times over the years and have finally decided to get into the reviewing game.

S: Vinous and port-like with syrupy raisin scents as well as some burnt espresso beans at the end of the quaff. Dark, unsweetened chocolate drives the nose. Some dark fruits peek in and out, but the chocolate and burnt coffee bean scents are the real winners. An alcohol aroma throughout. T: The cellaring does wonders for this brew. It's powerful and tannic on the tongue with port-like flavors up front, syrupy raisins and slight wood following with strong burnt espresso beans in the finish and aftertaste. The dark unsweetened chocolate flavors drive the profile, sometimes in the back drop and sometimes in the forefront. Alcohol burn peeks through in the middle and puckers at the end. As it warms the chocolate and coffee flavors make their appearance felt further, with the port flavors dissipating slightly. The aftertaste is heavy on the burnt beans throughout. MF: Syrupy and medium thick. Overall: This brew ages among the best of them. If you like a fresh bottle of BCS, have some patience and cellar a few.

The taste, on the other hand, is a wonderful mix of sweet malts and roasted malt. It is exceedingly chocolatey. It is really like a fine piece of dark chocolate in my mouth. Delicious.

The taste is full of black patent malt and roasted barley, with a good amount of chocolately malt flavor to balance their astringency. Hop bitterness is quite pronounced, Im guessing these are English hops. As the beer warms alcohol heat and some soy show up, but are never overpowering. the mouthfeel is thick but on the lighter side for an imperial stout. The finish is long bitter and chocolatey.

45,680,malcontent,4.73,"06-07 version  Foreboding black mass of a body with a lush tan head. Even after the head has died down, tantalizing lacing lingers.  Obvious chocolate scent isnt as aggressive as one might imagine. Tobacco and unexpected hop scent blend with a creamy, lactic quality in the nose. There is an alcohol quality that, while usually something I enjoy in a strong beer, takes away from the aroma herebarely.  Wow! Richer (dont read better) than the 05-06. Luxurious cocoa taste with hints of caramel, marshmallow, coffee and smoke. Decadent.  Slight alcohol feel on the tip of the tongue is all that holds the mouthfeel back from perfection. It is creamy, thick and holds on to the palate which is great as the flavors are outstanding. While I couldnt drink more than two (Im stopping at one) the drinkablility for the style is phenomenal. A treat I look forward to every year.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,lehows,3.82,"Poured a solid and thick black color with a very small tan head that faded away. Left no lacing. Nose was of sweet dark chocolate, black coffee, and roasted malt. Flavors hits you with a sharp alcohol tinged sweetness, chocolate, coffee, dark alcohol-soaked fruits. Alcohol is very pronounced. Drinkability is still high considering the ABV. A good beer to kick back during winter and relax with.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Damian,3,"Drank from a 12 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Downtown Wine & Spirits, Somerville, MA  Poured a transparent black (thick like motor oil) with a small frothy film of mocha-colored bubbles which quickly disappeared.  Smell was sweet and complex, yet not particularly pleasant. Deep, roasted malts, port wine and soy sauce came through strong along with notes of raisins, brown sugar and a distinct oakiness.  Taste was sharp and biting. Port was once again noticeable up front before the huge alcohol bite kicked in. As the alcohol subsided, notes of brown sugar, dried fruits, burnt malts and salty licorice became apparent. Some hoppiness was noticeable on the swallow, which continued into the finish. The aftertaste was a mix of potent hops and deep, roasted malts, with a noticeable alcohol warming in the throat.  Medium-heavy bodied with a frothy, pillowy mouthfeel. The amount of carbonation was quite excessive and stung my palate.  This is a harsh and rather difficult to drink beer (even for this style). Worst of all, I could not detect any hint of chocolate in this so-called ""Black Chocolate Stout.""",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smell: Smell is tons of roasted malts, chocolate, dark coffee, a little alcohol.  Taste: Awesome. This is hands down one of the best. Tons of the roasted malts come together to form the chocolate flavor. Its a little sweet with an alcohol kick at the end. A little smoky also. Mouthfeel is excellent, nice and thick.

One-finger tan head dissipates quickly.  Smell: Sweet malty goodness  chocolate and some dried fruit.  Taste: Wow. Dark chocolate and coffee  mostly bitter but some sweetness sneaks through.  Mouthfeel: Very nice  smooth and creamy.  Drinkability: Perfect for a winter brew  its 20 degrees in NYC today and this goes down very nicely.

45,680,nase,4.5,Winter 06-07 Bottle to Tulip Glass (no freshness date)  Chocolatey Alcohol Scent. Tan head with great retention/lacing. Taste and mouthfeel are remarkable.

45,680,Gatch,4.4,"Man this stuff is good. 10.6%, what? Really can't taste it, it's just a subtle spiciness at the end.  Pitch black. One of the darkest I've seen in the pour, not in the glass. It looks like any other stout, but that's expected. Big medium brown head.  Smell was of malt and molasses with a hint of chocolate.  So smooth. The chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee complimented each other so well.  Mouthfeel and drinkability were great. The chocolate and roasted malt stayed on the palate for a while after. After a few of these, you would be feeling pretty good. I need to pick up a few to age although nothing needs to be subdued because the flavors are not overwhelming as it is. Love this Imperial Stout.  Update 4/12/13: been five years since I've had this...second bottle of a 4-pack purchased at the end of 2012. 10.0% ABV. Definitely improved as far as depth of flavor but the body is still relatively light and easy drinking. Nose is quite strong, full of roasted malt, wood, and dark chocolate. Sweet but balanced and a great finish. A seriously good beer at a seriously good price.  9/7/13: Third bottle of the 4-pack from the Winter 12-13 bottling. Pours magnificently. Beautifully thick, creamy, frothy, medium brown head with plenty of lace and great retention. Nose is all roasted and chocolaty malt with a bit of spicy booze. Flavor and feel is so thick. Robust, roasty, charred, almost dark-earth-like. Seriously dark, deeply roasted malts and a bit of sweetness. Booze is very faint and contributes a warming sensation. This stuff is seriously delicious. But I must say...still a little hotter than I expected. I'm hoping the last bottle, which will be saved until the end of this year, will have the smoothness, sweetness, and lack of booze that I've been hoping for.  4th and final bottle of 4-pack consumed on 1/14/14. Now well over a year old. Gorgeous pour. Huge, frothy, sticky, medium brown head. Super mellow with massive malt, chocolate, and wood flavors. Nose and taste are spectacular. Still some booze present but it's only complementary at this point. Incredibly smooth with proper carbonation and a fantastic finish. As expected, this is the best bottle yet.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,quasimoto,3.4,"A - Deep black color, cant see through it. The head is frothy fingers worth, and leaves lace. Looks good.  S - Strong notes of chocolate start off this beer. There is a slight background of roasted coffee, molasses, and a slight alcohol presence.  T - Starts out with a strong coffee grain flavor, and some alcohol. It all covers the chocolate flavor.  M - Big and viscous. The alcohol warms up the mouth feel. There is some bitterness, but it blends with the alcohol.  D - I'd give it a year. This was brewed for winter 2006, so I'm going to age the rest.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Dark espresso-froth head that collapsed slowly into a thin layer (just above the event-horizon :o) . Aroma was rich and balanced, dark chocolate and a hint of oranges. Tastes creamy and rich, mouth puckering, with a bitter chocolate/orange twang at the finish.  I love my coffee strong and black, but I can't touch caffeine after 3pm if I want to sleep at night.

Some burnt coffee malt coming through.  Taste has the dark malts shining through rather nicely. Hints of dark bitter chocolate, melds nicely with some slight hop bittering.  Mouthfeel seems pretty light considering the abundance a malt & alcohol  Drinkability is dangerously high, considering I only picked up 2 singles, the other will age for a year.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,edskirk3,4.6,"Now I have the 2006 - 2007 vintage.  I must say, I much prefer this beer fresh over when it is aged. I want my chocolate malt flavors and aromas to be in-your-face, not mellowed.

Smell is all malt - roasted, chocolate and a bit of coffee. I can smell the alcohol in this, as well. Taste is much the same, lots of malt sweetness, and a tad bit of fruit, as well - raisin and prune. Slick and creamy.  My biggest problem with this beer is the ever presence of alcohol, particularly in terms of taste. It's a big beer at over 10% but I just don't feel like it's hidden very well. It's especially present when cold, but even as the beer warms I still get more alcohol on my palate than I'd like.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

There is some dark fruity thing lingering in the background, and the alcohol is a bit stinging, reminding me of... hair spray... The hair spray isn't all that apparent, but it did make me drop my drinkability rating down a bit.  Mouthfeel is rather creamy, pleasent for a brew of this gravity.  Finish is edgey, leaving that hair spray around.  If you see this, give it a try. It has a nice hefty flavor worth experienceing.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TheBierBand,4.38,"OK... so here you go.... this is a LIVE REVIEW. I just bought this six pack from one of my favorite beer stores... Jungle Jim's in Fairfield, OH... great beer selection. I purchased this for a little gathering we're having at the house this Saturday.  But, I decided to crack one open tonight to give it a try. I review this as I sit at my computer.... so this is AS IT HAPPENS!  It poured out nicely into my pint glass. I started it about half way down the side of the glass to prodce a perfect 1"" head but it didn't seem like it was going to cooperate, so I stood the glass straight up and oops.... wound up with about two inches. But it has settled down now to a nice 3/4 inch already leaving a nice thick lacing behind. Black as the night with a thick frothy tan head.  The aroma is rich with a creamy maltiness with definite chocolate and coffee. Can't wait to taste!  Oh WOW!.... nice taste! low carbonation. And WOW!... very bold malt. Hoppiness is present just to let you know this beer is the boss. The alcohol adds a good flavor. Nice coffee follow through as the dark chocolate and a woody taste are all dancing around in my mouth!  Mouthfeel is excellent! It leaves my mouth coated with the woody taste long after I swallow. And a thin film is left in my mouth.  Drinkability.... WELL.... I really like this beer! It's not one for mass consumption... because it'll put you in your place! I'll be having two maybe three tomorrow when guests are here over the course of the evening. IF I can save that many back for myself!

It fades away after a couple minutes to leave a thick, nectary apperance.  Smell: Wow. This beer has so much chocolate malt character. A slight bit of fruitiness is present as well. I almost didn't want to drink it after smelling because the aroma was so delicious.  Taste: Slightly sweet, rich, malty, roasty. Definate chocolate and coffee notes Everything you could want froma stout. This one is pretty high in alc. but it is pretty well hidden. It brings a sweetness and fruitiness to the beer, but does not taste alcoholy.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation level is low-mid range in intensity, just perfect for the style. As it goes down, there is a slight alcohol burn that brings a warming and pleasant feeling to the mouth.  Drinkability: Because the alcohol is so well hidden and the flavors are so dynamic, this is a really drinkable stout. The alcohol's effects can sneak up on you(put me to sleep, damnit!), but this is definately a 2, possibly 3 bottle(12oz) in a night Imperial Stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smell  First off the roasted malts make a big impression. I also get whiffs of alcohol. On top of this there is a nice coffee bean aroma complimented heavily by dark chocolate. Very nice.  Taste  This one starts off heavy on toasted flavors with lots of coffee. There is some sweet licorice as well with a whole bunch of heavy dark chocolate. To finish there is very strong alcohol character and a slight bitterness.  Mouthfeel  Thick and chewy and a medium to low carbonation. Almost perfect.  Drinkability  Pretty good. It is a big beer but it goes down easily.  A great brew! I cannot wait to taste a couple of these aged.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Popsinc,4.47,"2000-2001 Limited Edition bottle courtesy of Malto (Thanks!).  This bottle poured a dark black with only a small, tan head. The aging seems to have taken away some of the carbonation. The nose was very nice and highlighted by obviosuly chocolate hints, although subtle. The taste is where this beer makes its mark: A puff of semi-sweet chocolate off the top that turns only slightly bitter towards the end of the sip. A decadent chalky cocoa follows and the combination lingers long and pleasantly. Coffee bean undertones & roasted malts. Mouthfeel was exceptional. Although the pour revealed little carbonation, the body was lively enough to offer up some fresh mouthfeel and mix in a creaminess off the back end. I don't have a newer bottle of this beer to compare it to but this aged bottle is simply outstanding. Superb in every aspect.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,elricorico,4.57,"Winter 06-07 bottling. Black, very little light peers through the very edge. The head was a gorgeous milk chocolate colour, but didn't stick around.  When I first smelled the bottle, after popping the cap, I thought this beer might have a 5 for smell. All I got was rich dark chocolate. Once poured, alcohol heat competes with that delicious chocolate, taking away from the effect for me.  In the mouth, dark chocolate again makes the first impression. As it works its way across the tongue, roasted malt starts to take over. Alcohol heat pops up sharply, and the finish has plenty of smoke and ash. Really complex and tasty.  Thick and chewy, with lowish carbonation, this feels like you would expect it to.  Dangerously drinkable, I have to keep reminding myself it is a sipper. I may have to pick up another six pack of this year's version before it is gone.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Mouthfeel is full, creamy and a bit syrupy. Drinkability is very good, it's nice and smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a very, very good beer.

Very little retention. Looks exactly as you would expect an Imperial Stout to look.  S: Heavy chocolate (as expected), caramel, molasses, alcohol.  T: A little sweet and syrupy. Dominated by the dark chocolate. Ends with a nice bitter swoop, like a bite of bitter chocolate. Nice interplay between the chocolate and the alcohol.  M: Thick and creamy, with a sharp bite from the alcohol.  D: Sip it slowly because of the high ABV%.

Smell is heavy on espresso with some chocolate and maybe licorice. Taste is as advertised: chocolate at the front with coffee finishing with milky chocolate. Mouthfeel is creamy and carbonation is not very noticable. Not the most drinkable ale I've had-- its nearly 11% ABV is too much to mask and more than two in one sitting would be a bit much.

45,680,CortexBomb,4.23,"06-07 Edition.  Pour stout black, no head at all though, only a light trace. Only the lightest lacing. I have to knock its score here, because I expect either head or heavy lacing in my Imperial stouts and this one was not impressive in either department. Smell is roasted malts, Belgian like notes as well...plums...interesting.  Flavour, softly roasted malts give way to major dark fruit effects, sweet dark fruit effects at that...figs...sugar, and, of course, chocolate. This is a really unique flavour for a stout, quite depthy. Alcohol is most noticeable on the finish, a light warming, some flavour of it peeking out.  Mouth on this, it's ok. This isn't a big, imperial thickness, and its hop action is nothing special either. It is relatively full though. Drinkability, really good for a beer of this size. This is as easy to drink as a standard oatmeal stout with 1/3 of the alcohol...easily one of the best in its style at this.  Overall: I like this beer quite a bit, I was prepared to be disappointed after pouring it because of the lacklustre appearance, but everything else about this beer was either decent or quite good. I find the combination of Belgian dark fruit flavours and traditional stout are quite unique...",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Served in a snifter looking very dark brown to black with a little chocolate brown head. Odor is bitter cooking chocolate and some indecipherable dark fruits. Smells delicious and tamer than the fresh version. Taste is a fantastic chocolate with slight bitterness. Some cherries among the chocolate. Coffee on the finish. amazingly well balanced. velvety smooth. a deluxe drink experience. A year's aging does wonders for this already fantastic brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Had a nice dark head that settled down to a constant foamy film with good lacing. Mouthfeel was good but but as creamy as I would have expected. The smell had the obvious chocolate malts smell with sweet malts in there as well. The 10.6 ABV also came thru in the smell which I normally don't like since leads to high alcohol taste which this one had but not too bad.

After it's settled a quarter inch of dense tan head sits atop the surface.A slight tilt of the glass reveals legs for days.  Nose is milky chocolate and syrupy burnt caramel.

45,680,ppoitras,4.47,"12oz bottle received in trade with kmpitz2, thanks for the opportunity. 04-05 bottling.  Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed an partial skim of bubbles over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Bubbles seem to just swirl around, not really any growth or diminishing of head, with light lacing that falls very slowly. Aroma is tanninish creamy black malts, with some hops character as well. Taste is a duel of dark sweetness and bitterness, with the bitterness losing until the hops come on and even up the score. Vinous fruitiness pops up throughout, and alcohol warming quickly takes effect. Mouthfeel is so easy it seems almost thin, and drinkability is very high once you get a little bit of the warmth going on.

45,680,gueuzeonhigh,4.38,"This bible black brew cascaded into my glass with a presence that foretold of the taste extravaganza to come. It's tan brown head remined me of bread dough rising with a sculpturing that was a delight to behold at every ensuing sip. The flavor was everything this beer's moniker heralded-- hops with a bitter start, toasted malt with other flavor spangles here and there-sweet maltiness comingled with a tad of coffee perhaps. The 10% ABV makes it self known both in the nose and flavor. (I haven't opened my 2nd bottle yet). The finish is a long lasting copy of the start and a neverending flavor that leaves me wondering when it is going to fade.. At last the finish fades a clean diffusion leaving my tastebuds tantalized for the next sip. The mouthfeel was so cordial as if my palate claims ""this is where I belong"" -- the feeling of a heavy bodied all encompasing substance that fit so perfectly it makes me sorry to see the bottle and glass empty. Drinkability is exceptional even with a 10% ABV-- maybe because of the flavor and mouthfeel, I didn't tend to noitce the alcohol's affect on my constitution.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,hreb,4.68,"Side by side comparison of this year's (Winter 2006-2007) purchased a month ago, and last year's (Winter 2005-2006) purchased a year ago. Both are 12 oz bottles with slightly different markings on the bottle. I've never aged a Black Chocolate Stout before; I'm hoping it was a good idea.  Both beers allowed to warm slightly after coming out of cold storage and poured into large, identical snifters. For both, the pour is slightly oily and a beautiful, deep brown, beyond the color of cola. Nearly no head on either pour, just some faint wisps of a much lighter brown color on the surface. In the glass both are perfect pitch black with just a hint of brown on the edges. This is not a fair comparison, as the two are at opposite ends of the spectrum, but...the only more beautiful beer that has ever been served to me is the W.12 at the Moan & Dove.  First sniff: this year's. Complex nutty and toasty barley aroma with just a hint of sweetness. Last year's: a distinct note of sweetness above the malty odor. Not as nutty as this year's, but more aromatic. Hard to say which one I like better. The sweetness in the aged one is definitely more powerful, but the new one has a curious complexity to it which could actually be more rewarding.  First sip: this year's. A mouthful of cream with fine bubbles. Slightly bitter with a hint of chocolate. Bitter like espresso, but without any coffee flavor in the malt at all. As I swallow the complexity really comes out: it's like a whole different beer in my mouth, with nutty and chocolately flavors everywhere. Good stuff. The finish is of burnt toast (and that's a good thing).  Last year's: more complexity up front. Slightly fizzier. Chocolate flavors more immediate. There's a sweetness in the front of the tongue that the other doesn't have, but it's very delicate, and not what I was afraid of based just on the smell. Definitely not as creamy, but still milky, and leaves a powerful bitterness clinging to my teeth to let me know I've been drinking high quality stout.  This year's has a little bit of a fresh hay kind of flavor to it, which gives it a certain autumnal quality.  The level of hopping in the beer is in between what you'd expect from an English stout and an American. Storm King Stout and Stone's Russian Imperial Stout are both much more highly hopped, and to my taste, suffer for it. There is a hop bitterness to these beers but it's both subtle and complex. I'm not nearly savvy enough to identify the varieties of hops in these. I think there's more hoppiness in this year's than last year's.  I will also mention that unlike other chocolate stouts such as Rogue's and Young's, all the chocolate in this beer is from chocolate malt -- not from cocoa. I have no prejudice against added chocolate but this beer doesn't need it and the malt shines on its own.  Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the alcohol content of this beer. It's exactly where it should be (10.6%). There's a very faint alcohol flavor that might bother some not accustomed to drinking high-alcohol-content brews, but it does nothing to damage the flavor and does a lot to bring out the natural flavors of the malt. As the beer warms, there's more alcohol in the aroma, and more sourness.  This is obviously one of my favorite beers of all time, of any style, and I look forward to drinking it all year. It's very smooth and palatable but two bottles is probably as much as anyone should really drink at a time. As for the 2005 vs. 2006 side by side experiment, I like the mellower hop level in last year's better, but everything else about this year's better, especially the texture, but not by enough of a margin to affect my scoring either way. I can't say if aging affected the beer in any meaningful way, except to say that it survived the year despite the abuses of being moved around and pushed to the back of the refrigerator every time it tempted me.  Enjoy it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The nose is sligthly licoricey, sweet roasted malts, some hops hovering around, and lots of chocolate/toffee. The taste is awesome of sweet roasted malts, and chocolate, the finish is clean.

Highly recommended.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,terrabyte,4.1,"Pours a dark brown or black with a small brown head.  Aroma has a very strong chocolate smell, followed by quite a bit of booze.  Flavor is strong in chocolate as well, with a slight amount of booze. There might be a hint of roasted chocolates, but suddenly the aftertaste takes your breath away with booze burning your lungs. Its a toss-up whether or not the bitterness comes from the chocolate or coffee.  Mouthful is creamy and foamy.  Drinkability isnt very high due to the alcohol taste sweeping away the chocolate flavor. If its going to be that strong, youre going to want stronger flavors to catch up to it. Let alone try to mask some of it. On top of that, the flavor that was there was sort of rough and tough.  It should be noted that this beer was tasted right after trying a Goose Island Bourbon Stout. Thats hardly fair for Brooklyn. I did enjoy this beer, its much more affordable, and Id be glad to have another.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mmmbeer,4,"Original review: 2004 vintage, 4.6 overall rating. 2006-07 upped the alcohol almost 2 percent. It pours into the balloon glass inky black with a half-inch brownish head that recedes quickly to a collar, leaving some wisps of lace. The aroma consists of chocolate, pale, and roasted malts, dark fruits (currant, blackberry?), anise, smoke?, green apple, bubblegum?, and citric/tropical hops with hints of Fuggle. On the palate it is roasty/vinous, with chocolate and burnt malts, coffee, tobacco?, and citric, piney, minty?, cedary? hops which meld with the roasted malts to create a medium to high bitterness. The body is tingly at first, medium-thick, with a medium to long finish. Overall it's not as good as the 2004 - I think it needs more body and less alcohol, with the malts at the forefront. The alcohol needs to be an afterthought for this beer, not the premise.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,cameraman,4.03,"Poured a opaque black, very syrup like as it pours into the glass. A small beige to caramel colored head forms, but slowly dissolves away. A deep chocolate aroma almost smacks the nose out of the glass, there are sweet malt scents and dried fruit aromas blending in at the end. That chocolate stands out in the flavor as well, and attacks the palate, then slowly the malt comes foward, with a smack of bitterness right at the end. A thick and syrupy feel, very heavy on the palate. This is a very good beer, with a very good aroma and strong flavor, make this a joy to drink.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BeerSox,4.35,"12oz bottle into pint glass. I usually reserve these beers for snifters or wine glasses, but I didn't even realize this was a Russian Imperial Stout.  Pours like motor oil, with a brown head that slowly settles to a razor thin cap.  Very dark roasy malts with a little bit of walnut, and some dark chocolate. Warming alcohol can be detected.  Thick bitter malts along with a little bit of nut and bitter chocolate. Some hop bitterness resides in the back of the mouth. The bitterness of the malts sticks to your cheeks and lingers for a while. The alcohol is well hidden.  This is the first RIS I have had out of a pint glass, and I must say it's a fitting beer vessel. Very full of flavor. Just be careful not to get overwhelmed by the alcohol. At 10% ABV, this beer lets it sneak up on you. Recommended",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,beerphan,4.18,"12oz bottle -&gt; imperial pint 2006-2007  Pours black with a huge dirty hazlenut brown head. Half head, half beer off a standard pour. Wow, this head is thick. The massive heads slowly recedes to a lopsided pillow and leaves behind dark spiderweb lace.  Nose: Dark fruit, alcohol, and burnt malts.  Taste: Sweet chocolate burnt malts, along with some tastey dark fruit. A mouth warming alcohol kick is tamed by a semi dry chocolately finish.  Mouth: Thick and creamy, just about perfect to style.  A great winter sipper that is not brewed to be drank by the 12 pack, but very drinkable for a RIS. I will be sitting a few aside to try next year as i bet it holds up well after a year or two.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,rayjay,4.4,"'05-'06 vintage. Dark and thick appearance. Rather oily body, with sharp funky plums and thick chocolate malts upfront. Vintage-tamed hops, although they still have quite a presence. Old-school russian imperial stout, it's no tame Samuel Smith, nor is it a wild Storm King. The mouthfeel is equal parts sludge and silk. Notable alcohol presence similar to red wine. Quite a luxury beer. Thanks to zrrbrrt for the trade. Cheers!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jbramley,4.68,"Winter '05-'06 bottle.  Pours out like used motor oil. Has a rich, roasted malt smell. Minimal head, but what was there was a dark tan. Hints of coffee and cocoa in the nose. Has a strong roasted malt taste that ends in chocolate flavors. A hint of sweetness and alcohol when it first hits the tongue is quickly surpassed by bitterness. Chocolate notes come out as the beer breathes and warms up to make this a very pleasant sipping beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JasonA,3.73,"Pours a oil black with little to no head. Some lacing which seems to be a dark coffee in color. Looks tasty.  Smells initially like roasted alcohol. Can smell the ABV easily. Hint of coffee. Maybe some hops, barly, but really the alcohol.  Initial hints of chocolate and coffee which get over powered by a bombaredment of alcohol nose biting flavor ... ABV tasted. Not a bad alcohol, but a flavorful one. Hoppy finish which seems to be more of the american stout style. Full finish in flavor with staying power.  Medium to full bodied, great amount of carbonation for the style. Sits nice in the mouth until you swallow.  Overall I think the ABV is a bit overpowering for the flavor of this Stout. I think it could be masked a bit with more roasted malt for this to be considered stronger for the style. I dont think I could drink many of these. Not sure this is one I would come back to for East Coast RIS. Its too bad as Im a big Brooklyn fan.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Marty,3.98,"Pours a very dark reddish brown with a dense, craggy dark tan head that takes a moment to foam and dissipates very slowly, leaving a solid sticky layer of lace on the glass.  Not especially aromatic, but tastes somewhat like a rich chocolate mousse with hints of coffee. Sweet and rich. Finish is not too dry.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MrHurmateeowish,4.33,"12 oz bottle from Florians. Complete opaque black body with about a half an inch of tan head and a fair bit of lacing. Smells like chocolate and coffee. Tastes very roasty and malty, coffee and chocolate dominate. Little bitterness to speak of. Some alcohol warming and flavor too. Full bodied - among the best mouth feels of any beer I've had. Full flavored and pleasant. Goes down really smooth. Malty sweetness with some roasty coffee on the finish. Wow, I'm impressed with this beer. A new favorite stout. Glad I snatched up two 6-packs! Glad it's in Maine now!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

T: Wow...boozy, initally. Reminds me of a liquor, Godiva-like. Leaves a burnt walnut-like taste, like if I were to eat the ashes of a campfire. Alcohol becomes even more present after it warms.  M: Silky, creamy with a heavy charred and booze aftertaste.  D: A true sipper that lacks any ability to be consumed en mass.  BBCS is a huge beer, the biggest I've ever had. More complex than Rasputin. I am going to cellar some to see how it is after the alcohol is tamed.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DarkerTheBetter,4.59,"Thanks to warriorsoul for this '04-'05 12 oz bottle.  This beer poured a deep, dark black with a brownish tan wide collar that left a few spots of lace.  Smells of milk chocolate, maple syrup and a little bit of coffee with some bready barley and a nice blend of alcohol. There was also a little tart cherry and red grape in the background. Marvelous.  Tasted of smooth chocolate and sweet barley that was followed by a slight wave of green apple dryness and a nice alcohol. Finished with a little bit of charcoal.  The mouthfeel was light, but smooth with a thickening mini-carbonation. Seemed a little on the dry side.  I really liked the chocolate in this one, but the charcoal was a little bit of a deterrent.  -Edit-  This one ages remarkably well.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,Estarrio,4.15,"This bewitching brew is pitch black and completely opaque. The medium, coffee color head retains quite well, with sticky, intricate lacings.  Sweet malt, coffee, chocolate, caramel with hints of vanilla and toffee, this incredible brew smells like a festive holiday pudding.  The flavor is of sweet, roasted malts, bitter chocolate, coffee, and burnt caramel with some buttery tones. There is a huge, chewy bread/yeast consistency that tapers off into a bitter aftertaste with hints of alcohol.  This is a heavy beer with ample carbonation, though not as creamy as I might like it to be.  This is a fine seasonal offering from Brooklyn Brewery that I've been eager to taste for some time. I think the flavors would benefit well from a bit a bit of aging, though it is still a tasty brew when fresh.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,chadspivey,4.07,"thanks to gpcollen for the opportunity...winter 2006.  A: yup, it's black. very small head that becomes just a ring in seconds... the head is light brown.  S: whoa! I believe this one might have some alcohol in it. definitely can smell the dark chocolate, also grapes, prunes, other dark fruits. Smells really complex.  T: tip of the tounge is apples. Turns bitter in the middle, and finishes with a smooth, not too strong, chocolatey, kinda dark fruity taste. can definitely taste some alcohol here, but it belongs.  M: very smooth mouthfeel, really nice. kinda thick, like a stout should be. Almost perfect. I can't find anything wrong with this mouthfeel, but to be perfect, it would really have to stand out.  D: not so drinkable. I mean, not bad for the alcohol percenge, but I probably wouldn't drink another, not even for free. It's not a bad beer at all, don't get me wrong, but one's enough for me.  From the look of the label, I would never think this to be an excellent beer. hmmm... they deceived me... With a beer this good, I guess they don't need a fancy, or cool label.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,claytron,4.63,This is my first review inspired by a wonderful beer. I received this one in a seasonal pack from my liquor store. As a lover of dark beer the mere sight of the bottle made me want to try it and the alcohol content intrigued me even further. Pouring it from the bottle into the glass revealed a dark black brew. The head was almost non existent but a nice lacing is present.  The best thing about this beer in my opinion is it's drinkability. Each drink goes down extremely smooth as if it were a 5-7% beer. I would definitely pick this one up again in larger quantities.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,InsolublePancake,3.65,"A- Pours thick and viscous from the bottle; the darkest of browns, nearly black with a small, short-lived tan head.  S- Sweet malt and alcohol in the nose. Dark fruits, caramel, and toffee aromas abound; smells almost like a barleywine rather than a stout as the roasted malt is barely evident.  T- Very sweet and boozy upfront. Incredibly rich. Alcohol and rich caramel are the dominant flavors here. Roasted malt doesn't really even come into play until a charred flavor comes in on the finish.  M- Very thick, almost syrupy mouthfeel. Carbonation is minimal.  D- Not great. I'll be able to finish the 12oz bottle, but that's it. This brew is thick, rich, and makes no attempt to hide its alcohol content. A sipper for sure.  An enjoyable beer but the alcohol is a little overpowering right now. It overshadows the roasted malt profile and makes it difficult to pick out too many subtle nuances. This is one that I can pretty much guarantee will get better with age. Good now, but could be great in a year or two.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JohnnyM2002,4.25,"Sampled from a 12 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at 50 degrees. One previous review last year, before my tastes developed.  A - Pours a very dark black with a small brown head.  S - Powerful aromas of dark, unsweetened chocolate (similar to baking cocoa) and dark-roast coffee beans.  T - Strong blend of the coffee and cocoa, and as with the smell, no real sweetness or maltiness to it. I detect a slight hint of raspberries or black cherries...not enought to carry its own flavor, but it highlights the unsweetened chocolate very well.  M - Creamy mouthfeel, but not overly thick. Alcohol isn't overbearing, but is detectable as the warming sensation takes you.  D - The first time I tried this RIS, I didn't enjoy it...this was about 10 months ago. As I could tell my tastes were developing, I couldn't wait to try it again, and it was more than worth the wait. Would make for a wonderful addition to a session tasting and I plan on cellaring the rest of my case for enjoyment in the years to come.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mjd83goblue,4.57,"12 oz bottle, 6 pk for less than $10 out the door if I remember correctly. 06-07 bottling.  A: Black as it gets. Small brown head that leaves a ring quickly.  S: Lots of chocolate malt, some coffee, and maybe a touch of dark dark fruit, like raisons or prunes.  T: Tons of chocolate throughout. Big roasted super sweet malts. Some black coffee. The alcohol is no where to be found until you feel it going down your throat, and then, just warming enough that you know its there.  M: Not quite as thick as some (ie Bell's Expedition), but the perfect blend of carbonation, body, and creaminess. Slightly dry on the finish.  D: The perfect nightcap and winter beer.

45,680,NolateM,4.48,"Poured into a Maudite tulip glass. Darker than the blackest depths of hell!!! This looks like OIL when you pour it. Leaves a very small brown head that turns into a decent ring. Pretty good lacing going on as well.  The aroma is pretty boozy. And coffee-like. Two good things.  Holy stouty goodness! Roasty espresso-like flavor, with a rush of hoppy bitterness as you swallow... but there's a very sweet and fruitlike finish to it, almost like pomegranate. Even though it's not actually made with any real chocolate, it sure does have a dark chocolate flavor, with a bit of molassesy maltiness in there as well. It's got all the flavors that I hope for in a good, solid RIS.  Mouthfeel is a bit drying, in my opinion, but definitely not enough to take away from its deliciousness.  As far as drinkability goes... well, it's just not fair to rate an RIS this strong on drinkability. Don't get me wrong, the alcohol is VERY well-masked, but still... one is enough. It's fantastically drinkable for what it is.  This beer isn't just good for its price... it's TOO good for its price. A beer this good and this strong at a regular six-pack price is not something you'll see very often. Buy it before it runs out at your local liquor store... I've seen it happen in my area already. I'm excited to see how well it ages.  PS (a little edit) - pour this with a generous head. I've NEVER noticed such a drastic taste difference as when I poured this with little to no head, and when I poured it with a generous head. It was infinitely better when I poured it into a stemmed pilsner glass (of all things) with a 'whoops, I sort of over-did that' head.  About $9 a six-pack",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,scooter231,4.36,"Re-review! It's about time, and I thought it might be handy to compare this side by side to Dragonslayer, since it is my highest scored so far in this category.  I repeat myself in saying this is a beautiful, beautiful beer. Dark, no light, deep tan head, lacing- gorgeous. Nose is chocolatey and sweet- deeply so, like hot chocolate and espresso. Malty. Sweet. Taste is sweeter than the Dragon, chocolatey, missing the bitterness I enjoyed in Dragon, but sweeter. Not necessarily better or worse- just different frames of mind. Mouthfeel good, drinkability good- again, a very tasty brew. Sweet, tasty, chocolatey, dessert beer. Dessert, in a beer. This batch is definitely more well-balanced. Good stuff. And sneaky alcohol content- boys, give your girls this- you'll thank me later.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,pavandal,3.85,"Beer poured from a bottle labeled winter 05/06 into a pint glass. No head at all, even when I poured half of the bottle straight down the center. Would have received a higher appearance rating if it had something on top. Laced icicle shapes down the glass as I enjoyed.  Smell was very nice. All chocolate, with some espresso notes on top. Not bad at all.  Taste.. Very chocholate-y. This Stoudt is named correctly! Chocolate overtakes the palate, and a very slight grapefruit like bite to it. The aftertaste is similar to roasted coffee beans.  Heavy in the mouth, slightly overtaking due to the high alcohol content in this beer. Not bad by any stretch, but it's definately a sipper.  Overall, a pretty good beer, and a fine representation of RIS.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Thick and smooth; Easy to drink for such a strong brew. The chocolate and nut flavors really come out. This is my favorite Russian Imperial Stout so far, but I havent had many types. After first trying a bottle I went out immediately and bought two six packs for fear they would sell out too quickly. When I first went to Bierkraft for it, they were out. Get it now or you will miss out this year, but don't worry there is always next year.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Umbra,4.03,"Poured a dark black with dark tan head. Retention and lacing within the large wine glass was stunning. Aromas of roasted malts and cocoa. Big dark chocolate and bitter espresso notes. Bittterness sort of sat there on the tongue, without enough caramel from the malts to throw it off the couch. Came off less creamy than I had expected, yet still had a very light mouthfeel as it was considerably less viscous than other examples.  Overall, I unfortunately received this and the Young's Double Chocolate at the same time to share. The creamy, vanilla goodness of Young's was really what I was looking for at the time, which detracted from my overall enjoyment with the Brooklyn version. Very good nonetheless.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Damaged,3.97,"Straight from Bottle.  A-Little to no foam, and as for the foam that was there, it was a warm cocoa color. The beer was a deep black with a nice deep brown on the lip.  S-Goddamn is this appealing, a very attractive aroma.  T-Not as bitter as it is strong, however, the aftertaste is rather odd.  M-Very creamy, it seems to just flow freely throughout your mouth (and then down your throat!)  D-Apart from a strange aftertaste every so often, I could drink this non stop.  Highly Recommended, but I would not go as far to say this is the best beer on the market. ALSO, the bottling is VERY attractive.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Toddv29424,4.25,"This beer pours a dark-as-night black color with a moderate head. The smell is hard to tease out, but is much like alcohol and dark malts. Just a hint of something sour, although I am really not sure what it is... The taste is very special. It takes a little while for it to develop on the tongue, but its mostly like the same dark malts with just a hint of hops. The aftertaste is overwhelmingly like coffee, and lingers on the tongue for a long time. Many sweet notes as well, but I cant place where they would come from. This is a terrific beer, and well worth seeking out.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Too much alcohol in the nose, but there is also hints of chocolate, coffee, and dark fruits.  More impressed with the taste fomr the tap than from the bottle. The flavors were much more complex, and seemed to dance on the tastebuds for a longer period of time. Black coffee, baker's chocolate, a hint of bitter hops all to be found. Mouthfeel is chewy and a bit sticky. It's a high ABV, so drinkability isn't great.

Aroma is full of chocolate, molasses, caramel, brown sugar, and coffee with a large nose of bourbon for a backbone. Full bodied with a slick, syrupy texture. Alcohol level is present as it numbs the tongue. Sweet caramel flavors and tons chocolate. Sweet, creamy, milk chocolate at first then a dry, dark, bittersweet, baker's chocolate.

45,680,hunteraw,4.2,"Appearance: very black in color, some head but not much in the way of lacing.  Smell: Appealing. Lots of chocolate in the nose - I think I got some up my nose I was trying to sniff so hard.  Taste: Too bitter and ""not enough chocolate"" for the relatives I shared it with at Thanksgiving, but their loss - it's delicious. Lots of dark chocolate flavor, some espresso in the background, and a not-insignificant amount of hops bitterness - you can tell that the bitterness comes from hops, not burnt grain, which I always appreciate.  Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy. Good.  Drinkability: Solid RIS, although a bit less hop character than there could be.

Taste is pretty nice, some chocolate and roastiness, but seemed to have more earthiness from the hops than I liked. I think this would be eliminated with aging, and would increase my score. Medium to full bodied, medium carbonation. Was fun to drink, and would like to get more, but would like to age it to see how it develops.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Onibubba,4.05,"To quote Blix, this beer is ""Black as midnight, plack as pitch, blacker than the foulest witch..."" Very little head to speak of, which settles into a patchwork of foam riding the black. Smell is roasty coffee beans and chocolate. Taste has none of that coffee smell, but the chocolate stands out. Also less of the bitterness I've come to associate with Imperial Stouts like Yeti and RIS. A very light carbonation had me hoping for a creamier mouthfeel, but it is a tad thin. The killer is the alcohol. Make no mistake, this stuff is HOT. The alcohol really asserts itself and takes away from both mouthfeel and drinkability.  This is a very tasty stout that just needs some time to mature and tame the alcohol (I hope). At around 7 bucks a sixer, this is an incredible bargain. I suggest buying a few for now and a few to put away for next year.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The head is 2 finger thick, tan smooth and creamy it fades is a light lace.  The small is deep dark roasted malt, coffee and chocolate notes.  The taste follows but delivers more, this beer is sensational. Dark roasted malt is crazy delicious. The beer is good cold, warm or left over from the night before, not real sweet but just enough to enhance flavor but biter hopy enough to retain an delicate dryness.  The mouthfeel is the best. The beer feels so good I don't want to swallow. I like swishing it between my teeth. Very creamy with great carbonation and no bitter or stale after taste.  The drinkability is awesome at 10.6 ABV (and you would never know it) the beer just gets for sip after sip.

45,680,CWiggins,4.72,"I had a bottle of Victory's Storm King Stout in hand when an employee of the local beer shop approached and stated that while my choice was good, Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout was really good this year. I took his advice, and, while I still have yet to try Victory's offering, I'm ecstatic over this beer.  It pours like so many in its style: black and thick. Not as thick as some, but thick. A thin head of tan bubbles formed, but they quickly dissipated and were replaced by a lace around the edge. The aroma is wonderful; it's full of malts, coffee, and chocolate, with hints of sticky dried fruit.  The taste is something to behold. It commences with a smokiness combined with dark, bittersweet chocolate. A nice espresso hue fills the middle, and the finish is slightly hoppy with hints of pine. The sweet fruitiness was only detectable by me after the beer had warmed considerably. All variations on the flavor during its time in the glass were appreciated.  I like the mouthfeel. It's full, but not too full, a little sticky, and the aftertastewhich is mainly of coffee and dark chocolate with some bitternesslingers for quite some time. This is great beer, and a great model of the style. Cheers to Brooklyn Brewery!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BeerHonky,4.55,"This beer has been significantly improved over the past 5 years. It has become an awesome example of what I know to be a Russian Imperial Stout. Bought a six pack of this at Wegman's back home in Syracuse, NY. Enjoyed in a nonic glass. Hard poured it to get some of that dark brown head and lacing on the edge of the glass. As far as aroma and taste goes, there's only one word and that is MALT! Sooo much awesome malt flavor in this beer. Mouthfeel is sticky but smooth. Perfect amount of alcohol warming as well. I had three of these during Thanksgiving day...I felt so at home.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,battlekow,4,"I'm having a mini-vertical here, tasting the 04/05 and 05/06 simultaneously. I think I got these bottles from autumnaldave a long, long time ago, and it's time they were drunk.  Appearance-wise, they're obviously very similar. Attractive creamed coffee heads and stout black bodies.  The 04 actually smells stronger than the 05 to me. Getting my nose right in the former, I get a melange of chocolate, dark fruits, roasted malt and alcohol spice. Raising my nose a bit from the glass, the chocolate really floats above all else magnificently. The latter seems more muted.  They taste markedly different. The initial taste on the 04 reminds me of chocolate licorice with some anise and transitions into a delicious, mellow roasted finish. A slight hint of burnt cereal remains long after you've swallowed. The 05 lacks the dark chocolate spike at the beginning; its initial taste is more straight fruitiness. Similar finish to the 04. This seems more like a traditional RIS. Both have a bit of a sour tang, but it's more pronounced in the 05. Overall, I think the 04 has a bit of a ""fuller"" flavor than the 05.  The mouthfeel on both is outstanding, nice and gooey. I'm having a very easy time drinking the 04, less so the 05.  My overall rating will have to be a synthesis of the two years, which I would break down independently as:  04/05: Appearance: 4, Smell: 4.5, Taste: 4.5, Mouthfeel: 4, Drinkability: 4.5  05/06: Appearance: 4, Smell: 3.5, Taste: 3.5, Mouthfeel: 4, Drinkability: 3.5",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,smcyrone,4.56,"First sampling of the Winter 06-07 edition, noting a whopping 10.6% on the bottle. Fans of this brew know it for it's deep black color, no light's getting through this one. A creamy foam head sticks to this beer all the way down, leaving it's lace on my glass. Don't let it's smell mislead you, smells medicinal, almost chemical...Once it hits your tongue it is a complete sensory overload. What first amazes me is the creamy, rich mouthfeel. This beer is like drinking silk. Up front is a warm, dark chocolaty smooth flavor. The maltiness is what hits you first, and is quickly followed by an incredibly pleasant hop bite and some alcohol as you swallow, leaving a roasted chocolate hop flavor to linger in your mouth. I wouldn't have guessed this was 10.6% by the flavor, but you definitely can taste the alcohol. This doesn't bother me, i feel it adds to the flavor in this case. The complexity of the flavor is almost impossible to describe, you'll have to get your own and make your own judgements. I could probably ponder the flavors of this beer all night but after 2 or 3 it's lights out! Such an amazing accomplishment for American beer, I'm really surprised this isn't top 100 material on BA. Thanks Brooklyn!!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bigdeuce,3.99,"I am not a big brooklyn fan, except for the historic Dodgers, but this is an outstanding brew. Pours a huge creamy almost whipped creamy head. Has lacing dripping down the glass. Malts dominate the beer, with chocolate, coffee, and whiskey. Finishes with a slight whiskeyish finish. Slight hoppiness at the end. Is dark black in color. Terrific price and an even more terrific beer!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,WeisGuy,4.25,"06-07 edition  a - pours deep black and thick looking, one-inch tan head from an aggresive pour, retention around the edges, great lacing  s - big roasted malt and chocolate aroma, alcohol noticeable  t - sweetness right up front with strong bitterness following, lots of chocolate and roasted malt with some espresso on the end with a strong alcohol taste as well, very complex  m - full-bodied, not much carbonation, dry finish  d - might be a little big and hot to be overly drinkable at this point, some age would probably smooth out the alcohol a little bit making it slightly more drinkable  Very impressed with this stout, and it's a great value to boot. I could see this brew getting a lot better with some age as the alcohol is still a little bit harsh, but I'm enjoying it right now.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Rudgers73,4.43,"Poured into a short chalice from a 12 oz bottle.  A- Deep, dark brown/black. Thin reddish tan head that settles to a ring.  S- Very burnt and charcoal smell. Bitter dark chocolate. Malty.  T- Starts out smooth and warming then the bitterness shoots down the sides of the tongue. Dark chocolate, well blended with a dark roast coffee taste. Sweet and malty, a little dry to finish. Really complex and nice.  M- Sticky, but thinned due to the high alcohol. Just the way a RIS should be, IMO.  D- Strong but soo good. Drink it late after dinner on a winter night.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ColForbin,4.4,"Sampling the 06-07 edition. Pours a completely opaque black with a very thin dark tan head. Aroma is melted chocolate, with some spicy hops and some sour fruitiness as well. Taste is dark roasted coffee, unsweetened chocolate, with some hoppy bitterness that melds well with the chocolate flavors in the finish. Some sort of sour fruit, too, but I can't quite place it - maybe black currants? Super slick mouthfeel, with very little carbonation evident, and leaves a thick coffee syrup aftertaste, but that's what I'm looking for in an Imperial Stout, so it's good. Very drinkable, and I appreciate that the bottles are 12oz, so if you drink one you don't get completely hammered.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mcallister,3.68,"Midnight color with a large frothy mocha head, good retention, and a layer of thin sticky lace devours my snifter.  Dark chocolate is obvious in the nose with hints of dark fruits dominated by plum, hints of currant, and black cherry as well. A good amount of alcohol is also present in the nose.  Well I'm not sure this is a fair review. This beer is way too young to review. This is big and everywhere. Needs time for things to settle down and meld together. However I will do my best interpratation. A thick bitter chocolate fudge is most noticeable and leaves a unpleasant bitter taste on the palate. Like eating a 90% cocoa bar. Also there are the dark fruits that add a layer of complexity too the brew. The same plum domination, black currant, black cherry, and a slight bit of hop. Hints of alcohol on the long finish.  Mouth is full and discombobulated. Again I think this will age into a winner. I will review again in 2 years.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,kirok1999,4,"Pours a very dark black, slight red around the rim. Very little head or lacing. Smells first of chocolate, slight vanilla, just traces of citurs hops. Tastes first and foremost of chocolate. Bitter, dark, lingering chocolate. Hard to overcome the blast at first. It lingers like glue and overwhelms most other notes. Once you're used to it you can begin to pick out the vanilla, toffee, bitter coffee, espresso notes. All around a good beer if you're in the mood for a chocolate experience.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ericj551,4.4,"Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout pours a deep opaque black with a cream brown head. Huge aroma of chocolate, dark malts, toffee and raisins. Flavor is more of the same, a big malty backbone of roasted and caramel malts. It's sweet, but not overly so for its strength. There is a strong hop bitterness that barely balances the beer. Alcohol is definitely present, but very well hidden for almost 11%. A steal at $8 a six pack.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jdoherty,4.23,"Finally got my hands on this year's model after rave reviews from everyone. I was not disappointed  A: Deep, dark jet black color on the pour. A little bit of thick brown head at the top which would leave its mark on my glass the whole way down. Opaque as opaque can be.  S: Chocalate and carmel is the strongest scent you get. There are coffee notes as well and a bit of alcohol because well...it is 10.5%  T: Thick taste of caramel and coffee, not as blatently chocalate as expected, but it was delightfully subtle. A lot like rauchbiers in the sense that you could get some burnt flavors as well.  M: The only way you could coat your mouth any thicker is with liquid hershey's chocalate. Its a mouthfeel you can savor for a long time  D: To be drank one at a time, save a couple, impossible to be chugged so you don't have to worry about jackass friends stealing it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Alkey,4.35,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle a thick black with some dark brown foam that dissipated quickly to a thin layer over top the beer. Smells of alcohol, dark chocolate, and a bit of sweetness. Taste of alcohol, unsweetened bitter chocolate, and some burnt flavors. The mouth feel was thick and creamy. I like this brew a lot but the high alcohol keeps me from enjoying a few of these at a time. A great winter warmer I'll have on those cold days.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jwc215,4.75,"Made in winter of '05-'06 - tasted in mid-November 2006.  Pours jet black with a thin tan head. The head thins to barely a covering, and leaves some trails of lacing.  The smell is of robust dark chocolate wrapped around dark fruits with coffee notes.  The taste is incredible. Semi-sweet, creamy dark chocolate and dark fruits. A bitterness that comes in the form of espresso beans offset some of the sweetness. Rich, robust chocolate-covered dark fruits remains in the foreground, while the coffee notes intermingle. It's full-bodied with just the right amount of carbonation to make it smooth and not overly thick. A nice warming alcohol touch is noticeable, but does not interfere in the tastes, esp. considering the high abv.  It's silky smooth and, almost too, easy to drink. There's a nice, full, chocolatey, complex aftertaste. This is a wonderful dessert/nightcap brew!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,OStrungT,4.73,"This beer pours a jet black color with a fluffy, brown head. The head fades very slowly, leaving many thick laces.  This beer smells strongly of burnt malts. It has a sweet caramel aroma. I can smell some bittersweet chocolate also. A slight coffee aroma is present. If I look deep enough, I can ever so slightly smell the alcohol.  Wow. This beer is so smooth. It tastes of chocolate up front. Behind that I get a slight coffee flavor. It has a sweet calty flavor also. It also tastes of dark fruits. Plumbs, and raisins. It has a slight alcohol like taste also.  This beer goes down very smoothly, leaving a bitersweet chocolate aftertaste on my palate. It is low in carbonation, but perfect for the style.  This beer might make a good session beer, if you could watch out for the 10.5% ABV. It is so smooth, and the flavor is not overly agressive.  Overall: This is the Winter 05-06 release. Thanks to HimerMan for hooking me up. He also sent me the 03-04, and the 04-05 releases. I will be reviewing those as well, to see how this beer ages. I really liked this one, so I have high hopes.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,cheers2beers,4.53,"Thanks to Blitheringidiot and TheDarkertheBetter for giveing me the chance to try this winter 04-05 Black Chocolate Stout.  Appearance: This beer poured a super dark black,no light can be seen through this whatsoever. The tannish bubblely head rose up just enough to cling the edges, creating a minimal amount of laceing and a few bubbley spots here and there.  Aroma: The aromas are most infused with dark chocolates, cocoa bean, fresh coffee grounds, vanilla extracts, a strong sweet bourbon is definitely there as well.  Taste: At first splash on my palate, its instant alcohol with a sudden change to dark chocolates intertwined with coffee. Some vanilla notes are all throughout the palate, and then the alcoholic fumes come right back. Perhaps some dark fruits in there as well? A very splendid delight indeed!!  Mouthfeel: Thick bodied with low carbonation. Instant sweetness on the tongue followed by alcohol vapors. Leaves a nice sweetened film in my mouth to last. Super smooth, wonderful, overall this beer rocks!!  Drinkability: The best way to sum this beer up in one word is...Wow!! I am very impressed.

45,680,msubulldog25,4.45,"Received a couple bottles in a recent trade with froggyfrog - thanks JE! Dated: Winter '05-'06. Poured to a pint glass.  A: Nearly black (extremely dark brown), a thick-looking pour resembling motor oil. Capped with a rusty/tan head, nearly 2 fingers-worth, which faded gradually to a film. A brown-ish film coated the glass, with nice lace banding  S: Rich chocolate malts, coffee, sweet fruit, maple, leather, tobacco, peat, hints of alcohol and a tinge of sour citrus and balsamic vinegar. Complex aroma - wow!  T: Malty dark-roasted coffee, chocolate fudge: those are the two main flavors I got. Robust flavor also includes some ripe & slightly sour cherries. Finish has some smoked wood and a tangy bittersweetness. Alcohol is well-masked. This is a rich RIS and a very well-balanced one.  M: Full body and mouthfeel. A smooth coating covers the whole mouth, not being too sticky; it envelopes the mouth with a warm smoky/roasted malt bittersweetness.  D: Simply an excellent beer. It was wonderful to try an example that had aged a year, bringing out the depth of the flavors and aroma.

This beer poors jet black with a decent brown head that slowly fades away. Smell is fairly sweet with chocolate/roasted malt overtones. Taste is very smooth with a dark chocolate sweetness to it, slightly syrupy and plenty of the dark roasted malt. Overall it is well balanced between sweetness and bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick with plenty of alcohol packing a punch, although it is less than you would think. Finish is dry and slightly bitter. Overall a solid brew and a great value.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Neehan,3.78,"'06 Pours a very near-black with a nice coffee foam head. Very nice. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, although it is more designed for aging. The high alcohol (10.6%) is a bit too dominant in the smell and taste and is the only thing (though very minor) to hold this back from being priceless. Still, this has a wonderful combination of coffee, chocolate, and burnt-nutty malts. Very complex and a wonderfully balanced mouthfeel. I'm very eager to see how this one ages.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Backer2004,3.78,"What a pleasant surprise tonight. Found this at my favorite BP for $2 a single. What a steal! First time trying this one. Label said 10.5% ABV, but you can not tell with all the chocolate malts. Bitter like Hershey's Special Dark, this one is an enjoyable and affordable RIS. Does not equal Bell's or Stone, but a worthy experience. Worth getting a good number of these and see how they age.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smell: Nice roast malt and chocolate notes that make you want to taste it. Slight alcohol smell that tells you that you are drinking a serious beer.  T: So many different flavors hit you that you don""t know where to start. First, a dark chocolate note, followed by the burnt malt, and then the warmth of the alcohol.  M: This beer is rich from the start. I felt a burn as I retained it, but enjoyed the complex nature of this beer.  D: I would (and will) get this beer again.

45,680,MaxxDaddy,3.57,"Poured a beautiful jet black from the bottle with a somewhat thin, creamy tan head. I may have poured it too cold and the aroma was faint. Smelled like chocolate, coffee, and alcohol. Tasted like chocolate at first, then coffee and a hint of nuttiness. Finished chocolatey and alcoholic. The mouth feel was very nice, oily and slick. This was my first impy, so it was quite an experience. As it warmed up, the aroma was more pronounced, but toward the alcohol side. Some people seem to be of the opinion that sitting on this for a bit is best. I agree with that camp.

AP:Very deepest brown, nearly black thick and heavy looking. Created a very active mocha-brown colored head that dissipated to a scattered 1/8"" covering rather quickly for the style, I like the head to stick around longer and be a bit fatter overall. Not great retention for a RIS.  Nose: Sweet maple sugar and dark roasted chocolate-like malt scent dominates, coffee bean, and cream with some minor alcohol detected in the nose.  Taste: A dark chocolaty&gt;oaky&gt;oaty&gt;semi-bitter roasted coffee&gt;leafy hop finish and a bite of alcohol as it goes down.  MF: a syruppy, slick and heavy feel (just like it should be!)

45,680,SupaCelt,4.2,"This is my first experience with this brew as Brooklyn Brewing just became available to us in Michigan earlier this year. This lovely brew pours out with a fantastic viscosity and a deep brown colour capped by a chocolate coloured head of good resilience. Lacing is decoratively hung making this thing look even more lovely still.  The nose is chocolate laden. It smells creamy and rich with a bit of roasted graininess layered beneath the sweet chocolate tones. This one smells like a dessert. A tiny bit of alcoholic flair gives this a slight feel of an expensive liqueer or whatever you call them.  The taste is nicley chocolate based. It is not overwhelmingly sweet or cloying. There is a nice bitterness that gives it a coffee sort of feel although not highly coffee flavoured. It has a bit of dairy creaminess and again, the grain textures from the six varieties of malt are evident as they were in the nose. A very nice roasted ambiance overlays the entirety of the flavour scape. This is just delightful. I am surprised at how delicate the thing is especially with the 10.6% abv. This is a deceptive little number.  The mouthfeel is a heavy medium. It has a great texture. A bit dry in the finish and quite smoothe early.  The drinkability is excellent for such a hard hitter. The flavours meld well together and there is not one thing that stands out as overdone or misplaced. This is very well crafted and it will surely be a yearly tradition in my household from now on. I am glad we have this at our disposal now. Also of note, this bottle was very well priced for something in this abv range.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,tommy78,4.72,"I was finally able to try this beer on tap, and it is truly excellent. The appearance of the 06-07 version was a consistent chocolate colour. The smell is what makes this beer great. It had a more intense coffee aroma than the bottled version. In fact, I would go as far as saying it had a bite. The aroma definently drew me in. The taste matched the aroma: a combination of coffee malts and sweet cocoa. The mouthfeel is mostly smooth, with some kick to it. Given the high alcohol content, the drinkability is exceptional. I ended having three pints in one sitting, and I barely noticed it. It is worth the price of admission!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smells like dark chocolate with rich coffee malt.  First taste is dark, moreso than most chocolate stouts that I've tasted. Flavors of bitter dark chocolate are prominent, but there's definitely some coffee in this one. It's a biter brew, but it's tasty.

45,680,cproioi,4,The beer pours a beautiful black body with a dark tan head that stood rather proud. The aroma was full of chocolate and roasted malts with a nice backing of hops. The taste of this beer was huge first came a little hops flavor to wake the tounge up and then all the malts just rushed in giving it a huge flood of flavors. The flavor that came out mainly was of a bittersweet chocolate and some fusal alcohol note present in the taste. The stouts finish was a lingering dry one that left with a warming alcohol note that left me wanting another one. This was a wonderful beer that was served with Kentucky Chocolate Bourbon Balls and 80% Cocoa Dark Chocolates. The Bourbon Balls melded wonderfully with the stout.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Head never developed, but a collar of graham-cracker-colored foam stayed for a few minutes then nothing of the head remained.  Smell was subdued. Chocolate covered raisins or maybe raisin bread. I could not pick up more.  Taste was mildly sweet. Not cloying. Cocoa. Bittersweet chocolate. Peppery. Malt and hop presence, yet primarily cocoa. Alcohol hints came out late, rather well hidden. Rich with a lingering bitterness in the finish. Interesting but not especially complex, but I will age this one and taste it later.  Mouthfeel was smooth. Fully bodied and filling.

Aroma: chocolate and rasted malts.  Taste: Reminds me of unsweetened chocolate completely throughout. The warming alcohol shows itself in the middle as well. The finish is bitter and chocolate, along with come caramel flavors.  Mouthfeel: Thich and almost chewy, yet surprisingly smooth for such a high Alcohol content. There's very little carbonation to it at all, though, but that works well for all the flavoring.  Overall: Extremely complex, this one tasted great on a cold night.

The '06-'07 on tap, though... when I was pouring it at the Real Beer Expo in Rochester, it had a nice roasty chocolately slightly musty aroma, what I expect in a Russian Imperial Stout. I had it on tap more recently, though, and it has a very strong diacetyl note in the aroma. Quite jarring. Not what I'd expect. I should note it was served at way too cold a temperature, though.  Appearance: quite dark, marvelous head, good retention.  Smell: butterscotch dominates. I can barely make out some caramel and chocolate notes.  Taste: Was served too cool for me to really judge. I detect some roasty notes amid the maltiness.  Mouthfeel: Good and thick, as I'd expect. Full body, slightly syrupy feel coating tongue.  Drinkability: After one of these, I was drowsy.

45,680,dhchatfield,4.72,"This is my first review of this style of beer. 05/06, received as part of Birthday BIF (1), thanks to froggyfrog.  Poured at cellar temperature into my Sweetwater pint glass.  A - Black, pitch black. Like used motor oil. Like octopus ink. Like the absence of light. Really dark. Am I getting through to you? Very little head. What little there was was a caramel brown.  S - Wow! No mystery with this one. C-H-O-C-O-L-A-T-E. The only other aroma I caught at first was a whiff of bourbon. As the glass lowers, a dark plum/cherry/molasses melange arises.  T - See the caps above. Also a strong coffee presence. The alcohol is there as well, to me more in the stomach than in the mouth or nose.  M - Smooth and creamy, we like smooth and creamy. Just enough bitterness to make you want to get more liquid on your tongue.  D - As a novice to this style, I'm not certain what makes a stout drinkable. As a lover of this particular beer however, there is no mystery whatsover.  An excellent beer. It's the coldest night of the year so far here in Northern Illinois. I have a nice fire going, it was my day off, and this is one fine way to spend the evening. I am looking forward to a Winter filled with beers of this style. I only hope I can match the impression this one has made on me.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Doomcifer,4,"Scored an 05-06 sixer last week along with some 06-07. Gonna review both and compare/contrast the two.  05-06 Release:  Pours a thick, used motor oil, midnight black with a ridiculous, frothy, caramel brown head that retains fairly well.  Aroma is of sweet milk chocolate, sweet roasted dark malts. Smells like malty Hershey's Chocolate Syrup. Like desert in my glass. Not much alcohol is detected in the nose as I remember it when this first came out last year.  Taste has mellowed out a lot, already. Still a mild alcohol warmth present but when these babies were fresh last year, I remember them being very harsh. Extremely chocolatey, very sweet, coffee flavors all over the place as well, caramel, toffee, cherries. Very dry and incredibly roasty finish that stays in your mouth for a long long time. Extremely tasty and would serve as a tremendous apertif beer.  Mouthfeel is extremely rich and heavy. Thick like mud soup or my '92 Toyota Tercel's engine oil right about now after it hasn't been changed for about 6,000 miles. Just enough carbonation for this beer. This is a meal, and serves well as a desert. Hence, it isn't ridiculously drinkable but it sure is damn tasty.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mjc410,2.52,"06-07 bottle - 10.6% ABV  The pour into my big ol' snifter raises a one finger light brown head that recedes quickly to a surface littered with large bubbles. Lacing is thin and sudsy. The body is utterly black, even when backlit. I'll let the head retention slip by, considering the extra alcohol. The nose reeks of roast and alcohol, with strong coffee notes and subtle hints of chocolate. Seems fairly one-dimensional, though - not much depth. The taste is sweeter, more acidic, and less roasty than I expected, or what I recall from last year. It's tasty, but here too, there's no depth. It does hide the alcohol well, though. The mouth is more than medium, but not the thickest I've ever had by far. Overall, an easy drinking strong beer, but without much to call me back. I'm glad I didn't buy a case like I originally planned...",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,kernalklink,3.73,"Had heard a lot of good things about this stout and was not dissapointed. The brew poured thick dark black and left a creamy head. First sip was sweet, followed by burnt caramel and hints of coffee. The sweetness did not let up, as the first sip's flavors stuck to the tongue. The back end provided a slightly smokey character which blended well with the high alcohol content. After 3 bottles had to switch to another another standby before tastebud destruction- too bad because it was cold outside and this stout was the perfect warmer. Overall a very tasty beer- well done.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,GimpyCane,4.32,"Found a six of this gem at our local store for $6.99, what a buy. Poured a thick motor oil black with a small mocha hue head that left no lacing. The smell of chocolate is instance, also got a nice blast of roasted malt and burnt caramel. A hint alcohol is also present. What you smell is what you taste. Robust semi-sweet dark chocolate flavor with a hint of roasted malt followed by a hint of alcohol. The texture was thick, creamy and had a soft and subtle carbonation feel. Careful, this brew packs a punch at 10.6% ABV which is well hidden. I personally drink two and move on to something different. Buy a six and enjoy, it won't disappoint.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,AzAleC,3.98,"A: Poured from a 12 oz marked 06-07 into a pint glass. This bottle says 10.6% ABV as opposed to the listed 8.5. A deep, dark black. Pours like warm syrup, approx. 1/2"" copper/orange head, good retention with notable lacing.  S: Whoa, alcohol. It overpowers the hints of mocha, malt roasty/sweetness, toffee, and the bit of hops.  T: Strong alcohol sharpness, roasty malt flavors go well with the chocolate and coffee flavors which are both heavy. Hints of toffee.  M: This one is thick, definitely notable based on the ABV. Astringent drying can be noted on the tongue after swallowing and just before the syrupy nature takes over again and sticks to the mouth.  D: For those of you living in cold areas, this one could be good to keep around if you got snowed in. It's very warming. More than one or two could easily send someone who isnt a seasoned veteran in high ABV brews over the edge. Definitely an interesting addition to the imperial stout world.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MaltyGoodness,3.88,"12oz. bottle 06-07 edition  Pours a coal black with a small dark chocolate head that fades. Mild lacing on the glass.  Aroma is dominated by roasted malts with some espresso and light cocoa tones. There is a noticeable booziness to the aroma, even at a colder temperature.  Rich roasted malts upfront giving way to layers of espresso and cocoa flavors. Slightly bitter, it finishes with another helping of roasted malt. Even as it warms, the booze noted in the aroma is very hidden in the taste.  Full body, light carbonation.  Even with the elevated ABV, this is much more drinkable than last year's version. In fact, I think this version is superior in every way. I'm looking forward to seeing how this one ages as I suspect it will continue to improve as it matures.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,FtownThrowDown,4.35,"Pours a very dark brown, if not black. Almost no head, somewhat of a lacing ring around the outside of the glass and that's it. Smells of chocolaty syrup and alcohol. Some roastyness, burnt taste on the back side. Taste is identical to the smell, with the alcohol being more present. And a stronger roast/burnt flavor left in the mouth. Mouthfeel is too thin for a imperial stout in my opinion. I prefer it to be more thick and heavier on the mouth. This is a fairly sessionable beer. The alcohol is quite high and is very noticable in the taste. I'm going to put a few away in the dark to let them mature. It's a good winter brew that if you haven't tried is well worth it. I personally like the alcohol being elevated in this years offering, and due to that, will keep plenty around all winter.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mnj21655,4.15,"12oz. bottle winter 05-06 edition  Pours a deep black with a minimal light brown head and no lacing. Smells of chocolate, caramel, and roasted malts. Tastes of bittersweet chocolate and roasted malts with what was almost a smoky flavor at the finish. Nice mouthfeel, its was somewhat creamy and velvety. Good drinkability, not my favorite RIS but an enjoyable brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,LarryV,4.38,"This review is for the fall 2006 release. Pours an inky black color with a lacy tan head. Smell of roasted malt with chocolate overtones.  Taste is heavenly with hints of roasted malt and semi-sweet chocolate, no cloying sweetness. Alcohol is hidden very well. Creamy lush mouthfeel with a lingering taste. Love it, this is the best BBCS I've had yet, absolutely delicious.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,plaid75,4.03,Poured a dead black hue with a 2 finger pillowy tan head. There was good retention and lacing.  The smell was a strong upfront coffee and chocolate aroma. Good toasted grain element as well.  The taste consisted of a sweet chocolate and caramell ballanced by a solid coffee and burnt grain. Not overly sweet. ABV was hid well.  The mouthfeel was heavy and chewy.  Overall a very drinkable imperial. ABV is hidden well.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jaxon53,4.04,"Bottled in the Winter of '05-'06 so it's got a little age on it. Served slightly above room temperature, in a pint glass. Poured a deep, rich, black that no light could pass through. Had about a half inch of bubbly tan head that dissipated quickly , and left very little lace on the glass. Smelled of dark chocolates, oak, bourbon, and roasted coffee beans. Tasted heavily of chocolate/coffee with a trace of vanilla extract, and a smooth , smokey alcohol finish. A little sweet but very easy on the palate. I'd definitly get this stout again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,techdiver,2.52,"Pours opaque black with no head, and pretty much no carbonation. Smells like it should be tasty, but it just kind of underwhelms you with a dense flat unfulfilling taste, more coffee than chocolate. Certainly one is enough for me. I gave away the rest of the case.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,NJpadreFan,2.95,"Brooklyn- Black Chocolate Stout  Appearance- Dark black with a dark tan head. Good loking lacing at the top of my glass. Smell- Sweet chocolate, heavy with the sugar. Taste- A chocolate coffee blend with 10 scoops of sugar! Too sweet. Mouthfeel- The sugary sweetness is just too much. It hurts the cheeks. Warming and slightly bitter in the end. Alcohol is hidden.  Overall- If you like your Stout's packed with sugar this is your cup of tea, otherwise I'll pass.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,msolar,4.18,"Appearance: Black, with a surprisingly dark head that dissolves fairly quickly.  Smell: Not nearly as chocolate smelling as Youngs Double Chocolate Stout, but it had a nice smell of chocolate and coffee.  Mouthfeel: Very good. A top stout.  Drinkability: Very good. Not as sweet as Youngs (the last chocolate stout I had) which arguably makes a better drinking beer.  Id highly recommend this if youre looking for a good stout with a bit of chocolate smell & flavor. If youre looking for a really chocolate flavored beer, try Youngs. Both delicious.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Bouncingsoul1682,4.56,"This was a gift from a friend, and came highly recommended...Poured into my favorite pint glass with a wonderfully dark color...nowhere near transparent...chocolate colored creamy head. I enjoyed this brew with a piece of chocolate to enhance the flavor of the chocolate notes. Not as chocolately as Rogue's Chocolate Stout, but the subtleness of the cocoa made it that much more enjoyable. At the higher end of ABV that I prefer but it was not noticeable and didn't detract from the flavor. If you're a true stout fan....check it out if you come across it.  Just got my first sixer of 06-07 before it was supposed to be released and I can't wait to age it a little bit to enhance all those awesome flavors",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,tattooedtolley,4.2,"Appearance: Incredibly black, no light passing through this one. Brown head that lives shortly and leaves nice lacing.  Smell: An overwhelming amount of dark roasted maltiness, some coffee notes, and as expected the chocolate aroma came through.  Taste: Nice big roasted mlats up front with a hint of coffee followed by one of the best chocolate tastes I have had in a beer. The alcohol peeps through more than I expected but it is warming and pleasant.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with the typical lower carbonation that is found in the RIS style.  Drinkability: Not what I would call a session beer, but it is certainly more drinkable than many larger RIS's.  Overall this is my favorite offering from Brooklyn so far, I will pick it up again next release.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Da1nonlyBD,4.4,"I just had some from the 6 I bought back in Dec. This Stout ages VERY well. The taste was a bit mellower than before. Not as sharp as the day I got it. Smell was good.

I still have three left, but I'll wait a while to see how those come out.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,IntriqKen,4.7,"Tonight I yearned for a decadent desert after a wonderful dinner. It's the middle of August, but I decided to crack open this bottle given to me by Ev from PA. (I was only able to resist it's pull for a week). Oh my gawd! Pours like old motor oil with a small dark tan head that turns to very sticky lacing. Aromas before room temperature are definately dark chocolate...bittersweet dark chocolate. As it warms a toasted malt presence becomes known along with the hidden alcohol. Very slight alcohol comes through in the aromas on the end, but does with fine dark chocolates too. Taste....ah...taste.... Bittersweet rich thick (incredibly thick) smooth chocolate...hint of coffee....very slight hop bite at the end. Aftertaste is warming chocolate and coffee. This is very unlike any RIS I've ever tried....this is an incredible desert. How can it be so sweet yet without any cloying stickiness on the tongue afterwards? This was a wonderful, wonderful brew. I am definately going to enjoy the next hour or so finishing this off. Thanks Ev....wow. *** It's room temperature now....aromas still delicious....taste is even creamier than before...surprisingly, the sweetness never became cloying or sickening...the hops on the end keep this brew fresh and clean in the mouth. Still wonderful...still a perfect desert. It's been one hour and I've only about 4 sips left. I don't want another one...tonight. But am very, very sad that this is the only one I have. This is something I would like to have in my cellar for anytime I wanted something very, very special and decadent. I would also like to see how well it ages...although I doubt these stay around long enough for anyone to ever find out.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The smell is of black coffee, pruned, slight unsweetened chocolate and dark bread.  The taste is beautiful, huge coffee, slight nutty malt with a creamy caramel sense. all in all the only big blemish is the really slight body texture, I expect more from a Imp Stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,51mmz0rz,4.43,"'05-'06 release, poured into a Duvel tulip.  A: Totally opaque black, even in the light; the way it should be. Mocha color head with good retention. It fades after a couple minutes to a layer of lacing that sits on top. Beautiful lacing on the sides also.  S: Strong dark malty sweetness; Also coffee and of course, chocolate. There is a slight alcohol scent in the background, and maybe a dark fruit, but this could be dark malt sweetness. The alcohol seems to get stronger as it warms.  T: Alcohol warmth at first, accompanied by a dark malt sweetness. Then hit by big chocolate flavors and burnt malts which linger and fade into bitterness. The chocolate remains on the palate for awhile.  M: Relativity low carbonation, small bubbles and a full mouthfeel.  D: The alcohol is certainly there. This is not one to take down in gulps. As much as I like it, with the huge flavors in this beer I don't know if I would want another.  Great complex flavors here, but the alcohol overpowers sometimes. I'll have to age this for awhile and see where it goes.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,SilentSabre,4.53,"One of the best I have had in quite some time. Poured absolutely black with nearly no head. Just some sand coloured foam. This actually looked thick as it poured into the glass. Smell is dark roasted malt, baker's chocolate, and espresso beans. I cannot smell any hops. This is fantastic, so far. Taste is unimaginable! There are virtually no hops I can detect in the taste. THIS is what a beer this thick and dark should taste like. Sweet, dark roasted malts, coffee, and lots of it. There is chocolate and a bit of bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is heavy yet smooth. Very little carbonation present here. I am totally blown away by this one. Just delicious. Thanks to Ding, for allowing me to try this.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BlueHammer,4.03,"Wow is this a thick beer! It poured very dark opaque brown from the bottle with a thick dark tan head. It smells sweet and syrupy and malty. It has a balanced flavor, starting sweet and ending with a biting kick! The head fizzled to a thin layer, never quite disappearing and leaving a beautiful lacing on the glass. Very drinkable, it went down pretty fast without really noticing quite how fast!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,rarevos,4.62,"Poured from bottle into snifter.  A: Opaque chocolate brown, almost black. One finger of tan head with good staying power. Once it dissipated, a solid ring of brown foam around the edge of the glass persisted, with little lacing.  S: Oh, man. Dark, rich chocolate hits first and dominates. Like very dark, very rich chocolate syrup. Not Hershey's. Something dark, bitter, and expensive.  T: Chocolatey, sweet, a little bitter in the finish. Dry and roasty. Completely decadent.  M: Full-bodied. A little syrupy.  D: I'm confused as to what I should put as a score for the drinkability. Would I have another? I don't think so, but that's because it's really strong and the first was so damn good. I couldn't do much more than sip this, but it was divine.

This ale is dark as night, and thick to boot.  Aroma:  Sweet plum/fig newton with chocolatey goodness that is tinged with a subtle caramel laced coffee aroma.  Taste/Mouthfeel:  This beer has substance!!! Thick and chewy with an immediate plum sweetness that blossoms into an alcohol infused cocoa as it warms on the tongue. Coffee presence is apparent on the finish as is a touch of port. Better than previous years, this one is superb.

45,680,bklynbeerbaron,4.46,"On tap at the Lazy Boy Saloon, White Plains. Poured into a Brooklyn Brewery weizen glass.  Appearance: Pitch black, ain't no light gettin' through this sucker. A gorgeous, tan, creamy head that lingered to the bottom of the glass. What every stout should look like.  Smell: A sweet aroma of roasted chocolate.  Taste and mouthfeel: No hop flavor here, just plenty of roasted malts, which creates a flavor similar to a piece of really good bittersweet chocolate. Alcoholic bite comes across similar to a liqueur-flavored truffle and is slightly warming. Finish is vaguely smoky. Mouthfeel is superb: smooth, creamy and rich without being cloying.  Drinkability: Yeah, it's a sipper. A beer I could sip all night, 8.5 ABV be damned.  Notes: Just a big, bad, beautiful stout.

45,680,dragonbrew,4.38,"Tried this one recently at the brewery. Right up front I'll say it, a fine beer, my absolute favorite from Brooklyn. Even had to take a few bottled versions home, same results.  Fantastic black beauty with deep brown head that virtually stuck to the sides of my glass. Looked and felt like I was drinking an ice cream float, only tasted much better.  Robust roasted malt hints overwhelm the nose right away, leading right into the taste, which was fenominal. Hard for me to separate the two since the olfactory sense is hard to divide into two with this one. Chocolate and black java are the key tastes. Dry hop after taste is very remarkable finishing touch.  This one is velvety smooth even creamy in the mouth. Not for the faint of heart, a heavy beer great in the fall and winter.  It's hard to hide that I'm a huge fan, so I'll admitt it, I'll have again and again and would recommend it to any fan of big stouts.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Gaisgeil,4.05,"1yr old aged bottle.  This is about as easily approachable an RIS as I've ever seen, slightly subdued compared to other example, but still a massive brew. Pours a deep black with a shortlived but creamy tan head. Nose is of cocoa and dark roasted coffee beans, some wafts of vague fruitiness as well. Taste is very similar, quite chewy and full. Alcohol is slightly distracting, but not very much so. Some dark fruit and brandy in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is great, just a tad light for an RIS, but respectably so! Drinkability is pretty high for the style, this went down fairly easily.  Slàinte!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The aroma is big on chocolate and roasted malt with some alcohol. There is a bit of molasses in there too.  The flavor is of chocolate, roasted malt, molasses, dark fruit with a nice alcohol warmth. You really notice the chocolate with the first few sips and then once you are used to it there is molasses and dark fruit that present themself.  The mouthfeel is full bodied with medium carbonation.  This is a very drinkable beer and I highly recommend this one to anybody who likes big stouts.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,trep,4.1,"Pours black from the bottle labeled '05-'06. Roughly 6 months old. Black like liquid coal with a chocolate chip cookie head that fades to a mere ring around the glass.  Very rich wine-like alcohol smell. Of course, roasted malt and other typical Impy stout aromas. Dark fruitiness smells fantastic and a little chocolate to be smelt as well.  Very smokey, with domination from the dark chocolate. Not as fruity as the aroma but still quite complex. Starts out rich and sweet, roasted malty with a hint of chocolate bittersweet. Fades eventually with a nice acidic transition to the juicy dark fruits. Finishes with a nice earthy smokiness and a bit of bitter.  Solid mouthfeel, not thick and heavy like I like my Imperial Stouts but still quite good. Carbonation is just right but the thickness is medium/full. Excellent drinkability for something so robust, complex and high in alcohol. Mm, this was heaven paired with a chocolate chip cookie from Max 'n Erma's.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,StoutHearted,4.28,"Had it in a bottle and it pours slighlty less thick than syrup. It retains a dark-as-midnight color with a half-inch caramel head, which gives off a strong chocolate malt smell. After sticking my nose over the glass, I got a strong impression of coffee ice cream. Drinkability was slow, as the alcohol hit me pretty quickly, and the beer was mighty thick. Cold, it tasted like bitter hops. As it warmed up, the lactose kicked in, but retained a strong bitterness. Most milky stouts I've had come off too sweet, but this one was like dark chocolate: thick, bitter, and black. Once fully room temperature, I could detect more sweetness, but overall, it was like a dark chocolate milkshake. Very enjoyable, and the taste of it lingers pleasantly on the tongue well after drinking it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

It's quite simply gorgeous.  Aromas are so strong: dark chocolate, roasted malts, caramel notes. They are a good preview of the taste. The alcohol has been noted alright. It warms you all the way through.  This is a heavy and filling beer. Couldn't have too many of these before I'd start to feel it's effects, or fall asleep.

45,680,BillyB,4.6,Someone spiked my chocolate milk shake with whiskey!  Appearance is Black as night during a full eclipse.  Sweet chocalatey aroma like I've never smelled before. You'd think that Hershey brewed this beer instead of Brooklyn.  Taste is nothing short of amazing. Chocolate meets sharp alcohol in an amazing balance!  Mouthfeel is incredibly full and creamy. Drinkability is up to you. It's a very big beer but I say bring it on! My friend had this on tap in his house and we worked on kicking it for a while. It was hard work but we did it. Try it with a brownie and some vanilla ice cream.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,normZurawski,4.38,"Hot tuna this is a good beer! Rich, creamy, full, and loaded with goodness. Thick maltiness characterizes this well done beer. Prevalent taste of alcohol is not a detriment, but works well within the confines of this. Certainly a cold weather beer that I'm able to sneak in on a cool spring evening. Light hop flavor rides this, gives it a nice tinge towards balance. Hint of bitterness towards the back of the tongue.  Appearance is almost perfect, something that seems impossible to really attain. Pours black with a small, richly colored dark head. Smell is the only non-4.5 element. Basically ""just"" good, nothing more. Mouthfeel is rich, well done, meaty. Easy to drink this beer, very easy. Just not too many.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,Kendo,4.35,"I poured a 12 oz bottle from 05-06 into a pint glass. The result? A motor oil-like, viscous liquid ventures forth. I'm talking used, black motor oil, not that clean, golden brown Pennzoil stuff, but rather the kind of oil that's seen its share of engine wear and tear for 5, 6 or maybe even 8 thousand miles as you make excuse after excuse for why you haven't changed your oil in awhile. A 1.5 finger mocha-colored chocolate milkshake-like head dissipates ever so slowly. As I sip it, chocolate lacing clings to the glass and shimmers in the light. Thick lacing clings to the side of the glass during the whole experience. Nice. Very nice.  Scent: I write down the following as I sniff in the essence of this brew: Raisins. Prunes. Licorice. Dark Chocolate. Malts. Slightly burnt coffee. Lots going on. I'm impressed.  Taste: At first it's all coffee, overpowering any other subtle nuanced flavors, but as it warms and I make my way down the glass, I keep thinking port -- which reminds me of raisins, prunes and maybe even figs. If you know a port lover who's not a beer drinker, have him/her try this. Anyhow, that chewy, raisiny malt flavor predominates, with a moderate bitterness finishing the assault. It's more like coffee bitter, though, than a hoppy one, and all in all, there's a decent balance between malt and bitterness, even if it doesn't remind me of a hoppy beer bitterness. A nice alcohol warmth finishes it off -- not the harsh burn of Listerine ethanol but rather the cozy heat of, say Jagermeister or [insert your favorite liquor here]. Here it is a fairly warm night in late May and I'm thinking this would be a perfect sipping companion by a winter fire. Oh well, I have a few more in the cellar; I'll try and do that one night next winter. . . .  The mouthfeel is about what you'd expect for an Imperial Stout: it's heavy with a slightly grainy feel predominating, but not in a bad way. I wonder if aging would help to mellow and mingle the flavors and give it a little more smoothness. Like I said, I'll find out next winter. . . .  As for drinkability: this is a heavy beer, in terms of being full-bodied, flavorful and high in alcohol. I like it a lot as a sipping beer, but honestly I couldn't see myself putting back more than one at a time, and thus I gave it a lower score for drinkability than other categories.  All in all it's a winner if you like Imperial Stouts. The only drawback is that despite the name, it's not all that chocolatey. After having quite a few Rogue Chocolate Stouts over the last couple weeks, there's a noticeable difference between the Rogue Chocolate Stout and the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout when it comes to chocolate flavor. This brew is not nearly as sweet, but it's more complex and ultimately just as rewarding.  Additional notes, 11/5/07:  Did a vertical this weekend, with the 05/06, 06/07 and new 07/08. The 05/06 was the most aromatic, but the consensus was the 06/07 tasted best -- there was a strong taste of black licorice in the 05/06, especially when it was cold; the 06/07 was more chocolatey; the 07/08 was bland when compared to its older brothers. . . which says a lot, as this is not a flavorless beer! The verdict/lesson: Age this for a year and then enjoy.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Westsidethreat,3.95,"A: Oh wow, now this is a stout. Pours like motor oil. Its like a black hole, no light is getting thru this beer. Slow fading dark tan head sits a good half inch of the beer. As it falls it leaves a lace of webbing from the foam on the sides of the glass.  S: Smells of roasted malts, black cherries and chocolate milk shake.  T: This stout engages the full palate of the tongue. Lots of roasted grains and coffee tastes. Bitter sweet chocolate flavors with an after taste of port and alcohol. Gentle milk chocolate lingers on the palate for minutes after   M: Velvety with the carbonation not very aparent.  D: Well certainly not a lot of chocolate taste going on. But a great stout non the less.

Beautiful lacing all around the glass. Hellofa good looking RIS.  S: Smells of chocolate with some hints of coffee. Roasted malt is also dominant. Very strong aroma, but very good smells.  T: Delicious. Sweet, but not overly sweet. I like the fact that is has a deep dark chocolate taste and not much coffee taste. A good aftertaste of the dark chocolate is a nice addition also.  M: Superb for a RIS. Not heavy and motor oily but a good full bodied beer. Carbonation has been done correctly none of overcarbonated fizz attack, but enough so it does not taste syrupy. Im glad Brooklyn didnt do what many other brewers do and go off the deep end with a ultra thick beer. Bravo.  D: Very tastey and the alcohol is nicely hidden which means I am constantly returning to the glass for another sip. Am very glad I bought a six pack of this.

Amazing dark chocolate flavor that is not too sweet. Hints of mocha and roasted malts comes through and balances this perfectly. Bitter dark chocolate aftertaste persists.  M: Smooth and creamy, perfect feel  D: Very tasty and not too sweet, definitely enjoyed as a desert beer watching the game.  This stout quickly moved towards the top of my list of stouts.

Aromas of dark fruits, alcohol, a tad bit of coffee and chocolate, but mostly roasted matliness. Flavors are dominated by a smooth and yet slightly bitterness from the chocolate malts. Chocolate flavor is subtle, but the finish is super fresh cream creamy, mmmm, lingers a while. Alcohol finishes the twang of this delectable brew, just at the end. I had one of these back in December when it was fresh, and this one has already seen some mellowing in the 5 months. One of my favorite RISs, and I was fortunate to have a friend drive a 6er of this from NY as it's not available in these parts.

45,680,garymuchow,4.4,Sample courtesy of SS '05. Many thanks to beergeek279 and cupbeerman for all the fine bottles.  Version '05-'06 Aroma is rich and malty sweet with dark fruit and a vinous quality. Very nice intensity. Nice roast character. Pours fairly heavy and thick. Thin but very dense head that is dark. Black and no light shines through. Heavy lacing. Boy is the flavor nice on this. Heavy roast without excessive dryness. Again with nice dark fruit and a vinous quality (which seems curious with minimal aging). Moderate bitterness that is pleasant tasting and precedes an equally tasty dryness. Just short of very heavy. Very nicely carbonated. Fine bubbles and not too many. Very warm in stomach. This one hit the spot. It's been a while since I've drank a top 100 beer. To think how low on the list this one sits and to know how good it is is mind boggling in how many exceptional beers there are.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,tfinn,4.15,"2003-2004 bottling. consumed April 2006.  high viscosity pour with low carbonation and only a few clinging bubbles. opaque. if I had to give color, it would be deep chocolate (high cocoa solids) brown, bordering on black.  very strong chocolate scent, with ethanol hits, and a motor-oil / truck exhaust element that reminds me of baltika. plum without the sweetness. and a bit of stinky high-fat cheese, or kelp. other than the chocolate, it's all somewhat muted though; probably the age. I was expecting more oxidation. there is some there, but it's well integrated(?) with the rest of the flavors  taste is the smoothest high-grade milk chocolate. never cloyingly sweet. it hits the tongue and hazes out the mind, revealing fuzzy outlines of chocolate and roasted malt, although the roastiness stays beneath the sweetness, and some bittering hops of unknown variety keep it in check. more chocolate than coffee, although as it warms a mocha comes out. esters? blackcurrant. buried beneath the chocolate, of course.  mouthfeel like silk. there's a consistent juicy malt thread that pulls everything to it and while the sensations of roasty astringency and bittering meander around the tongue, it comes back down to that dark malt which fades. incredible, really. like a narrator weaving a story in your palate.  drinkability? and how! it goes down almost a little too easy, and I'm actually starting to feel _full_ in my tummy from this, like a rich dessert. I also have a bottle of the 2004-2005, but based on how this one has held up, I think I'll save it for around this time next year. for the style I think the balance is just about perfect, as the youthful astringent and hoppy bite has peeled back revealing the deep dark brown chocolately soul of this brew. I will seek this out in the future.  a toast to Ben (dv8) who left me this sample. as good as this is, I bet Valhalla's is better.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,HimerMan,4.33,"12oz bottle; 03/04 Batch (Cellar aged for 2-years)  Perhaps the first beer that truly attracted me to Russian imperial stouts. I remember searching for this beer for a very long time, even calling various distributors - eventually one came through and I bought 3 cases. Well worth it.  Pours extreme black with a magnificent head that is sticky with a burnt chocolate and very mild coffee aroma. Alcohol present, especially towards the end of the bottle - however, in the aged ones almost non-existent. After I aged them, the alcohol is more mellow with a sweeter finish.  Mouthfeel is excellent - though, a lingering carob flavor seems to come out the longer you sip the beer. I prefer this at colder temperatures; the beer loses a bit of its black chocolate edge at warmer temperatures, in my opinion.  Highly suggest trying this beer, well worth the find - and truly a unique brew...brewed by a world renowned brewmaster.  Enjoy this one!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,hoppymeal,4.09,"A rapid pour reveals a reddish tan head that rapidly fades back into the opaque black beer. Fairly complex aromas going on here. At first I get some tart tart apple then the chocolate comes thru in the background. As it warms the smell is almost like an old ale or english barley wine as I get some sweet raisiny and alcohol scents, but there is some roastiness there too that reminds me this is a stout. Tastes are heavily roasted with a little milk tanginess and more chocolate but in the background like it was in the smell. It is soft and smooth on the palate and not too thick. Overall a complex aroma and very drinkable beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,GreenWBush,3.88,"Drops into my chalice a glowing black/ruby with a spectacular 3"" cascade head-reduction. Lace peninsulas fog the chalice.  Intensely chocolately on the nose, with roast and anise. Cocoa and raisins. Reminds me vaguely of Samuel Smith's interpretation; rather English. Not quite Le Coq's Imperial in girth, though. Finish is raisins and vanilla.  Taste is strong acrid coffee roast with chocolate roundedness. The bitterness and twang of the roast is matched and balanced well by a big maltiness and a nice Eng-hop bite. Has a vague smokiness.  Sits amazingly on the tongue - a choco-lovers dream. Moderate to above-average drinkable.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

S: Alcohol is really up front, with some underlying chocolate and fruity esters.  T: Dark, bitter chocolate and dark roasted espresso. The alcohol is quite assertive as well.  M: Moderate body is a little chalky. Carbonation is on the light side of moderate.  D: This one's a sipper.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,PeatReek,4.02,"Pours a nice dark black, very little head to speak of (might be over-chilled), but a lace of deep brown foam. Aroma is oaky and winey. Taste is a deep dark cacao/espresso flavor. Yum! A bit winey, aged fruit flavor. Very complex and delicious. Only problem with this beer is that it's discernably strong enough that I could probably only have one at a time.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Chadbrew,4.2,"This was a couple years old but I must say I think it held up rather nicely. There was definitely some oxidation present but mostly just in the nose and the flavor was good enough to make the oxidation seem unnoticeable in terms of taste. It was nice and chocolaty, with plenty of roast and sweetness. No one attribute was overwhelming although the chocolate was prevailing. Amazingly well balanced. There was a number of things going on here but I think it was kept simple enough to not be over the top ""throw everything in the pot"" RIS, thanks... I'm sick of them. Good 12 oz package which is just enough to enjoy without wasting or getting wasted.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,PatYoda,4.07,"Pours dark brown with a bit of foam around the edge of the glass. Leaves a few bubbles of lacing as I drink.  The smell is superb - deep rich chocolate and ripe dark fruit intermingle with sugary molasses and caramel. Vanilla too. Not much detectable alcohol here, unlike in the taste.  The taste doesn't bring quite as much to the table as the smell. The rich chocolate is somewhat subdued here compared to the smell, but it's still there. Same story for the wonderful fruit found in the aroma. Also the alcohol is a bit strong in this bottle. I've found some slight bottle to bottle variability among the same six pack, with this bottle being about in the middle in terms of quality, so this is what I'll go by. The taste adds a mild roasted quality which rounds things out nicely. A minute amount of hop bitterness is detected in the finish, plenty enough along with the roasted character to make sure this doesn't turn into a sugar bomb.  The mouthfeel is thin for the style, not quite as mouth coating as I would prefer. Overall I liked it, but would take Rogue Chocoate Stout over this any day.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Metalmonk,3.95,"[received in trade from jabocu]  Winter '05/'06 batch.  The head disappears in a flash. Ends up looking like an ultra-dark port or brandy in the glass. One of the darkest of the dark, as stouts go.  Spiciness and hops mingle with the chocolatey aroma. Liqueur-filled chocolate-covered cherries come to mind. Alcohol spike in the back reminds you this is the Russian Imperial version of the style.  Tastes like: if you took a bunch of chocolate-covered cherries, soaked them in fruity holiday liqueur, melted the whole thing down and tossed the goo into a stout. It's quite good, but very bold, with the mellow spiciness and thick chocolate fighting for control.  Feels thick in the mouth, with very little carbonation. Again reminds of melted chocolate. Maybe too sticky.  Good thing Brooklyn does this around the holidays, the perfect time for something roasty, toasty, thick, warming and sweet. A real sipper. Woe be to the drinker who guzzles a couple of these in the hot July sun.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,kmpitz2,4.82,"05-06 batch. Pours a black color with just hints of brown around the top from light that is able to come through at the edges. A finger of dark tan head falls quickly to a full film over top. Nose is rather fruity, with chunky, sweet, and chewy fig aromas with a very creamy, almost cocoa chocolate. Roasted charate is very light and subdued. This one is all about the sweeter sides of the malt in a stout. Flavor starts fruity and figgy, but moves very quickly to a sweet chocolate with moderate coffee undertones and just a touch of alcohol. There is a light bitterness on the finish that helps emphasize the coffee tones. This one has definately started to chage a little since the release. I originally found it to be very fruity, but those fruit tones are now playing second string to the chocolate and coffee. I like it better. Feel is thick with a light carbonation. Its got a light slickness to it, but its not detracting. This one is as good as ever. The alcohol is only slightly noticable in the flavor, but nothing that lessens the drinkability. I wish this was easier to find.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Franchise,4.32,"This offering from Brooklyn pours a onyx black with a cascading body that leaves a thick brown head that stays with the beer. The nose is so complex (alcohal, chocolate, brown sugar, vanilla, cool whip-mashmallow) a very sweet pleasing nose. The taste is fantastic starts with a espresso hop bitterness that is smoothed by a sweet syrup dark chocolate feel. The body is surprisingly light and drinkable but don't let that fool you cause this high ABV hits you and warms you up. Love this beer one that I come back to every winter.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,cracgor,4.34,"My pint was a stark black beer with a little ring of dark brown head. Not very impressive looking at all. Just a run of the mill look to it. It did have a nice floral, burnt malt smell to it. Not as fruity as it was just a sweet fragrance. The beer itself, had an awesome taste to it. Like milk chocolate, with a good hint of spicy hops. It is definitely an american version, but not over the top with the hops like some others I like much less. The beer is velvety smooth, like a chocolate shake. No hint of alcohol on it. Drinks very well. Maybe not enough complexity to drink all week, but enough good taste to keep me wanting a second.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,DaggerEyes,4.5,"Pours the deepest shade of brown you'll ever see that settles into the black of a moonless night sky, with little to no head.  The dark bitter sweet chocolate scent is clear as day on the nose, this beer earns it's ""chocolate stout"" branding. Also on the nose are hints of strong black coffee and alchohol can be slightly detected.  The taste is an incredibly complex one, yet the dark chocolate and coffee tastes are the most notable.  It has a medium to full body with a fair ammount of carbonation.  This beer is like dessert in a glass and while incredibly smooth it is also incredibly rich and a beer that should be appreciated and savored. While this has to be one of my favorite beers right now, there is definately a time and a place for it.

45,680,rousee,3.97,Nice dark black-cherry color. The small head of foam is dark tan with a reddish tint.  Smell is a dark chocolate maltiness with some elements of cherries and berries. The chocolate is quite pronounced.  Unfortunately the nice chocolate aroma is not as powerful on the palate as it is on the nose. It tastes quite vinous but is still pretty true to the style. Its good here but not great. There is a bit of a stickiness left behind which is a negative. To be expected to some degree for this style though. Its a good beer-- I dont agree with outstanding as it is labeled on the site though. There are far better RISs out there.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,falloutsnow,4.58,"Winter 2009-2010 bottling, sampled on a rainy 2012-04-13 A three year aged version of Brooklyn BCS. Poured into a standard US pint glass.  At three years of age, this still looks great: a tall brown head of very fine bubbles that descends to a thick cap atop the beer, leaving generous lacing all the way down. (5.0)  The aroma, however, has lost nearly everything and is a mix of sweetness and slight roasted character with obvious ethanol. (2.0)  Taste is primarily sweet and nondescript, with mild roasted malt character and some acridity. Perhaps a bit of vanilla around the sides of the tongue. Ethanol has mellowed, but still present and surprisingly strong. Sweetness persists through each sip; not sure where this is from, but it is cloying. Only the lingering aftertaste presents a bit of interesting roasted flavor. (2.0)  Mouthfeel is still good: medium-heavy with carbonation that makes this foam up quite nicely on the palate. Slight bit of ethanol burn on the tongue and in the nostrils. Would be easily drinkable if it tasted good. (4.5)  ---  Winter 2010-2011 bottling, sampled on a cold 2012-04-12  Fresh, I thought highly of this beer. Now, aged two years, it's rather average or even below average. This was cellared since purchase, so I don't think any spoilage has occurred. I have many older bottles to test, but going forward, I beginning to think I'll only purchase enough for the winter season.  Pours a tall (&gt;2cm) head of small dark tan to brown bubbles, which descent in a minute or two to a medium-sized ring around the beer and a few islands of foam atop the body. Some lacing and spots linger around the sides of the glass. Body is an opaque dark brown to black, with brown-amber highlights. Carbonation is visible, rather active, and can be seen rising across all sides of the glass (4.0)  Aroma is of mild chocolate, a bit of plum-like esters, and a bit of organic solvent (light acetone). No trace of alcohol, but two years in, this has not held up that well. (3.0)  Taste offers some roasted malt bitterness, residual sweetness, and very mild chocolate flavors. Gone are the washes of chocolate syrup and coffee that this beer had fresh. No ethanol is present, though the loss of other flavors seems like an unjustifiable trade-off. Mid-palate offers some roasted barley, residual sweetness, and mild chocolate. Lingering aftertaste of roasted malt, slight chocolate, slight coffee grounds, and a bit of a ""wood aged"" component.  Body is medium-heavy with moderate carbonation. This leads the beer to foam up initially on the palate, but when the carbonation fades out, this is smoothly felt across the tongue. Ethanol burn is still felt in the back of the throat and slightly in the nostrils.  ---  Winter 2005-2006 bottling, sampled in 2005 A: I note a pleasant viscosity as the beer pours from the bottle into a pint glass. Primeval midnight black in body color (forget about attempting to discover this one's carbonation level through visual inspection), a 2cm dark tan rises from the depths, settling into a thin film of foam for the entire drinking session. The deflating head and sipping lead to sticky, excellent lacing wherever the beer touches.  S: Beautifully crisp nose with massive amounts of chocolate, roasted, and caramel malt scents. Plums and dried figs are the fruits being expressed here, quite rich and full in their presentation. Some alcohol burn is detected in the back of the nose as the scent fades away in the nostrils.  T: An intensely complex beer, pulling major influences from roasted and smoked malts, black coffee, dark/bitter chocolate, caramel, molasses, and even some nuttiness. The richness of all these pulls together into a near-brownie-dense (a bit of a hyperbole, but not by much) concoction with emphasis on the roasted malt and chocolate flavors. The alcohol presence in the finish is pleasant and well-placed towards the back of the throat. Aftertaste of bitter chocolate and black coffee, somewhat acidic.  M: Medium to full bodied with a modest amount carbonation that allows for some foaming in the mouth, which results in a pleasantly soft, yet full effect on the palate. Dry finish with the bitterness of the coffee-chocolate combination.  D: An exceptionally well-crafted imperial stout that I wish was available from fall through spring. All the aspects of the beer come together in a fashion so near perfection that it may be as close as I'll ever get to a manifestation of the concept. Highly drinkable as a sipping dessert or after-dinner beer, something to close out the last few hours of a day with.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smell is of the finest dark chocolate and coffee notes. Smells sweet and rich. Taste was just as rich. Very strong chocolate and coffee flavors. Roated barley is the major theme and all the different types blend very well. Lots of bite, but still smooth. Alcohol is a little apparent, but adds a nice warming effect.

45,680,yelterdow,4.18,"Winter 2005-06 vintage. Purchased a case in November and I am sampling one of these tonight, at cellar temperature.  Served in a *really* oversize brandy snifter after dinner at midnight on 3/2/06.  Appearance- Look at the color of this head... it is brown, not tan. On a good pour, the crown stands three fingers high on a pitch black viscous liquid. Even after several minutes, the foam is still unbroken... a maze of lacing lurks behind, stuck like tape to the sides of my glass.  Smell- The most dense, concentrated, intense display of aromas I've yet to experience in a Russian Imperial Stout. I'm getting blackstrap molasses, chocolate, booze, and alcohol... yes, the last two are the same but not really... this is a strong mother of a beer.  Taste- Intense, driving exhibition of the darkest, stongest, most bitter chocolate... combined with molasses and fudge, and of course, alcohol. As flavorful and brutally domineering as this beer is, I would guess that a year or two in the cellar would benefit the flavor integration.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Downplayed by the intense flavors, the mouthfeel serves as a soft backdrop to the beer's character. Unassuming and soft, it allows the transgression of heavy malt and chocolate to its eventually bitter hoppy finish... this is a sipper, make no mistake. I suggest a pairing with dessert, chocolate cheescake maybe, and don't rush it. Savor every moment.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,brewdlyhooked13,4.5,"Original review on 3/31/03 4.5 I love a good, dark beer; this seems like the ultimate choice. It did not disappoint. It pours out thick and syrupy, no splashing. A tan, creamy head with pretty good staying power. It's taken me an hour to get to these final few ounces and there's still some trace foam around the edge of the glass. I started this too cold, let it get closer to room temp. It's always part of the experience to have a sip or two when it's cold, then nurse it along so you can taste how it develops as it warms up.  Tasted cold, the primary sensation is the chocolate malts, the surprising and pleasant carbonation, and the hop kick which I don't find as prevalent in stouts. There's a lot to taste, looking forward to this one as it warms up!  These last couple ounces, the beer's close to 60 degrees by now, there's maybe a slight buttery presence, the mouthfeel is smoother (maybe due in part to the decreased bubbles by now), a little more cloying to me (raison), and the aftertaste of espresso, hops, and a touch of smoke hangs on for a good 15 seconds afterwards. If I started this beer out at 55 degrees or so, it would take me an hour to drink it anyway. As much as I enjoy a good beer tasting, this one would really be an ideal candidate if you drink a 4 or 6 ounce sample. It can take a bit just priming your palate to get into the depth of this beer, the sampling could take 20 minutes (but it'd be a fine 20 minutes). Glad I bought a few of these...  *** From the 02-03 bottling season. 3.80  Appearance - pours out thick and black, a deep mocha head color is thin and fades rather quickly but holds at a partial covering and laces pretty well. 4.5  Aroma - a heady nose of chocolate, rum, and raisin. Fantastic. 5.0  Taste - much of the balance has left this beer, what's left is extremely smoky, charred, and bittersweet. Vinous flavors mix with the charcoal taste, most of the chocolate and coffee has disappeared. On the swallow, most burnt flavor, and finally some roasty espresso flavors peek through. The aftertaste eventually shows some chocolate, but it's a wait. 3.0  Mouthfeel - good as ever. Thick, viscous, coating, subdued carbonation. 4.5  Drinkability - better when fresh, IMO. This shows some better balance as it warms but for my palate, this beer's best days were some two years ago. 2.5",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bossmanjg,2.65,"This was the first Imperial Stout that I have had, and feel that I may want to stay away from this style of beer.  Appearance: It poured black, aesthetically not bad for a stout beer.  Smell: A mixture of chocolate, some vanilla with hints of coffee. And the part that I think turned me away was the alcohol scent. It was just too strong for me. I dont feel that beer should smell like the alcohol.  Taste: The taste was strong on the chocolate, more bitter dark chocolate that milk.  Mouth feel: Average, kinda watery.  Drinkability: This is, for me at least, not a session beer. I cant see myself drinking this brew on any occasion.  I guess you cant like al the styles of beer. Too bad for me right  And as always remember the immortal words:  Beer is proof that God loves us, and wants us to be happy.  ~Benjamin Franklin",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TongoRad,3.63,"First off- this is a serious looking beer, from the viscous dense black liquid to the rocky brownish head sitting on top of it.  Numerous strong elements hit your nose simultaneously- coffee, spices, figs and dates, caramel, cocoa, maybe some heavy cream, and a platform of alcohol to give it an overriding maturity.  The palate, however, is a bit problematic. Unfortunately the bitterness, roasty astringency and alcohol cross the line into unbalance. Just a touch more residual malt would have done a world of good.  This beer came from the second sixer that I bought this season. Past years have been wonderful, hopefully next year will bring this beer back to its past glories.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,atozymurgy,3.77,"The last of a six-pack I bought about a month ago (stored in cellar). Here goes...  Pours jet black, with a tiny and short-lived coffee colored head. Just a little lacing left after 30 seconds. This is less than I'd like in a stout.  Powerful roasted barley in the nose, almost too powerful, but it still allows other aromas to get through. There's plenty of black patent there too, and hints of chocolate. No hops in the nose - some aroma hops might balance the roastiness, and wouldn't have been inappropriate in this style, IMO.  This beer gets better in the mouth. Roasted barley's still strong, but there's a pleasant sweetness that offsets it. Rich and chocolatey. There's not quite enough hop bitterness to balance the sweetness and roastiness, but almost.  Mouthfeel is really full and chewy. There's a bit of a bite from the carbonation that's not quite right for the style, just a little too fizzy and not creamy enough. Still, a pleasant body, with a tiny hint of alcohol warmth in the swallow.  Overall, quite a good stout. IMO, it would be better with a tad less roasted barley, and just a little more hop in the flavor and aroma. I'll be getting this again next year!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mattpetti,4.5,"Of the winter seasonal beers that come out each year this one is one of my favorites. Pours pitch black with a small off brown tinted head. Smelled like roasted malts, lots-o-chocolate, the bittersweet kind. I picked up on a bit of smokeyness as well, but that just could have been me. Taste was amazing. I had no idea that this was an imperial stout. There is so much chocolate and creamy flavor to this beer (yet not nearly overwhelming) that it astounds the senses. Very little carbonation and lack of excessive bitterness gives this beer an amazing mouthfeel. Coating upon coating fills your mouth. This beer is incredibly drinkable. I had 2 of them and was feeling content to having a third, but then the alcohol kicked in alittle. On that note you taste none of the 8.5 percent. This beer kicked ass. If you can still get your hands on some go for it, it is well worth it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bignick,4.52,"Winter 2005/2006 bottle:  This is some rich and wonderful stuff. It pours pitch black with a mediocre head. It has the typical rough chocolate/coffee smell of a great RIS (ie: Stone, Victory, Yeti, Thumbsucker, etc). However, once this beer hits the lips, it is just bliss. The deeply complex, but not overwhelming chocolate taste is incredible. It reminds of the scene from the movie Old School in which the character played by Will Ferrell take a sip of his beer and yells ""it tastes so good when it hits the lips"", or something like that. This beer is very full-bodied, but it is so smooth and delicious that I could keep throwing it back all night.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,geexploitation,4.23,"This Imperial Stout reminds me a lot of the Sam Smith's version of the style. Pours pitch black, with a dark tan/brown head. The aroma smells of burnt chocolate and dried fruit. The flavor has the chocolate in attendance, but also some bubblegum and a ton of roasted malt bitterness settling on the back of the tongue. This is a very thick, substantial beer, that rubs along the mouth with a phenolic scrubbing feeling. Not a mouthfeel for the faint of heart, but that's par for the course with this style of beer. This sipping beer is a sumptuous treat that has ""dessert course"" written all over it. It's not the best exmple of the style I've had, but it's very good. Recommended.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,doppelmeup,4.2,"I got this beer in a Brooklyn variety pack. It is the 2005/2006 batch.  Poured a nearly black glassfull to drink with a chocolate fondue after dinner at a friends.  Not a lot of head, and only slight lacing as I drank the beer.  Aromas of chocolate, dark coffee and some burnt toffee. Nice aroma.  Tasted very good. Not too sweet, more like bittersweet cocoa and french roast coffee. Alcohol content very well hidden. A nice compliment to the chocolate fondue.  Moderately thick and syrupy mouthfeel. Clean finish.  Nice beer to have with dessert. Couldn't 'drink a lot of these in a row, but one of them at a time with dessert is nice way to savor this beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Chocolately, coffee-ish. Aftertaste of grassy hops. Interesting notes of vanilla, oak, alcohol. Strong hop bitterness balances out the volume of roasty malt in this beer.  M - medium thick mouthfeel, sticks to your tongue. Carbonation a little tingly, seems a little too high but could just be this bottle.  D - very tasty brew.

45,680,timtheenchanta,3.33,Pitch black with a medium tan head with a little bit of retention. Lots of thin webby lacing. Cooking chocolate smell with hints of alcohol.

Aroma of chocolate mousse spiked with bourbon, sugared espresso with vanilla whipped cream. Oil slick texture with medium body. Incredible alcohol-infused mocha flavor, all chocolate and coffee ice cream booziness. It's nearly impossible to believe that there is no actual chocolate in this stuff. Tongue-numbing buzz.

Tastes blend together fairly well on a creamy texture and create a nice warming effect as well. Fairly thick and somewhat oily. At nearly 9%, this one displays no hint of alcohol in the taste. A rich, flavorful stout that deserves to be mentioned with some of the best. Definitely one to drink at room temp..or hell, leave it out in the sun for a while.

45,680,Ego,4,"05-06 variety  eyes... dark and opaque, stout like silly... one finger of dark tan head fades out into a pangea and o-ring, light barely pentrates this sucker... nice. lace is also good, a consistent sheet of fine bubbles on a swirl up the glass and down with some stickiness  nose... the malts shine, toasty, slight burnt, choc sweetness, raisenettes (do they still make those things?)... the nose is in line with the name of the beer, to a tee...  taste etc... somewhat thick and creamy, leaves a trace on your lips, the carbonation makes it seem a touch thicker than it actually might be... the choc flavor is very apparent in the aftertaste along with some residual bitterness, the sweetness is abundant but not cloying or messing with the overall experience of this elixer, the carbonation is slightly more than other imp stouts I have been suckin on lately, and that isn't a bad thing. my personal preference is more coffee tones but this beer smells and tastes exactly what it should by the name on the label. nice warming sensation after a few sips of this. The alcohol doesn't prevent larger swigs so this isn't a total ""sipper"" like say the Goose Island Bourbon Stout.  Verdict? a solid 4 across the board which = damn good beer.

45,680,johnniemarg,4.5,"You can tell this is a thick beer as you pour it. It has the color and consistency of used engine oil that was way overdue to be changed. Very small head, but probably one of the darkest brown heads I've ever seen. Always a good sign. Very little lacing.  Strong aroma of mollasses or dark corn syrup and vanilla with some chocolate as well as almond liqueur (including the alcohol smell) and dark roasted malt. No hops that I can smell against all the sweet sugar.  The taste is generally in line with the aroma I described. Strong sweet mollasses to start with, dark chocolate, then some vanilla, some alcohol and then finishes with a strong, heavily roasted malt flavor that really sticks to your tongue. This is awesome.  This is as thick as heavy cream. Super thick and sticky. My lips are sticking together because of how sugary it is. The carbonation is there but I feel like it's all the malt that makes this so thick, not just the carbonation that makes it seem that way.  I could easily drink a few of these on a cold winter night.

S: The smell is defiantly of chocolate, malt and alcohol. Which is fantastic since I'm a huge dark chocolate fan. T: The taste does not disappoint. The first thing the hits you is the strong alcohol taste. I know this bothers some people but in this case it is perfectly balanced by the deep chocolate taste as well as the rich malts used in this brew. I also get a slight taste a raspberries I'm not really sure why but there it is. M: This beer just feels fantastic going down it absolutely coats the inside of the mouth with a great creaminess and well quite frankly just makes me happy. D: So I'm going back to buy some more of this brew to age as far and drinking more then one or two I probably could but it might be the start a disastrous evening.

Smell is of chocolate covered cherries and a faint alcohol smell. Taste is sweet chocolate up front, roasted coffee tasting malts through the middle, with a warming alcohol finish. Feels crisp and thick in the mouth with a nice alcohol tingle on the sides of the tongue. This is definately a sipping beer.

45,680,kkipple,3.78,"Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is an impressively black stout with a red-brown head that froths up as you pour. If this beer isn't pitch black, it's darn close.  The smell is heavy; thick cocoa, malt, and alcohol hits the nose. There's a slight sweetness and the overall impression is that this is going to be a very filling beer...  First impressions? If Mackeson's XXX and an imperial stout had a child, it'd be Brooklyn Black. This is a thick, syrupy beer that has no shortage of flavor. It really really reminded me of Mackeson's concentrate. Chocolate, roasted malts, espresso, alcohol, and a slight astringent flavor dominate. This is an intensely flavorful, bittersweet stout. The alcohol really jumped out at me, but I have to admit the chocolate wasn't nearly as prominent as I hoped. (see Rogue Chocolate Stout) The overall impression is of a Imperial Milk stout with a bit of chocolate added. Still, this is a very tasty beer.  Mouthfeel? Thick, heavy, warming. Rather smooth. The 8.5% is very present here.  Drinkable? At 300 calories per 12 oz serving (if correct) a pint of this is a meal in itself. This is a good sipping beer over a winters evening, but hardly a session brew.  Brooklyn Black is a very intense, tasty stout. Ultimately, the fact that it's a rather expensive seasonal brew works against it. Mackeson's is the ""lite"" version of this beer to me, and is available year round at half the price. Rogue Chocolate has a much more pleasing chocolate hit. I won't be buying this regularly, but by all means, try this if you like Imperial Stouts.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Pours like black India ink, thick and viscous with great legs. A draft pour produces a thick, whipped brown froth that clings like Cool Whip, before settling down to a tight cap.  Aroma boasts of expertly toasted dark malts, liquified chocolate, booze-soaked raisins and plum, espresso, fruity licorice, and bittersweet fruity hops.  Flavor is creamy dark chocolate covered raisins melting in a hot cup of fresh espresso. Massive malt complexity, burnt caramel, licorice, English toffee, plum, and creamy vanilla creme brule'. It's perfectly balanced by plenty of pine, fruity citrus, and sweet floral hops. No trace of the strength. This year's version tastes like it's allready been aged it's so smooth.  Body is full, but not huge. Mouthfeel is like liquid silk with a creamy, slippery texture that is a joy to roll around your tongue.

The taste is powerful and is dominated by chocolate with an ""on again - off again"" hoppyness to it.

Not nearly as sweet as one would expect, nor as chocolatey as the name would imply.  Not real heavy on the palate, especially considering the style.

Big notes of bittersweet chocolate/cocoa too.  Taste is similar with a good hop finish that keeps this from getting crazy sweet. Some toffee in the taste too, which is nice.

The finish has a nice smooth hop bitterness that goes well in supporting the malt. There are some very faint notes of dark fruit like prunes or dates but without the sugary sweetness.  M- This beer has a medium mouthfeel with some creamy texture and a bit of fizz in the finish. No alcohol warmth noticed.  D- This beer is a nice stout with good complexity.

The beer was totally opaque and I could not shine a light through it, basically the way a double/imperial stout should be. The aroma was of espresso, licorice, dark fruits, currant. The taste was very warming and complex, with notes of toffee, molasses and even a hint of dark rum. This brew was perfect for a cold evening in the NC mountains. The reason I scored the drinkability only slightly above average is because this beer is not for the faint of palate. At times I felt like I was drinking a mixed drink instead of a beer. I kept tasting dark rum and molasses, but I guess that's just me.

Some slight strawberries on tasting. No hops that I could detect... Bitterness mostly from burnt and roasted malt. Aftertaste was slightly astringent and unpleasant at times.  Very full and satisfyingly chewy mouthfeel. Great drinkability for such a beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The smell is like a shot of whiskey with chocolate notes. The taste is upfront alcohol. Not subtle at all. The rubust alcohol almost overuns the chocolate flavor but you can pick it up a little. The mouthfeel powerfull at first then fades to a good whiskey like aftertaste. I could drink these again. I would not drink these in session.

Complex flavor of espresso( ...a theme here ?), malt, chocolate....the semi-bitter kind....a hint of sugar with an amazingly heavy mouthfeel....like you should chew before swallowing...almost a greek coffee feel....like small particulates are suspended in there...this actually feels better than it sounds! One of these is enough...it's pretty heavy stuff. When they came out with this years ago, I used to buy cases so I could still have some after the season.

Very nice lacing around the glass. Deep and dark roasted malts, with strong whiffs of chocolate and coffee (you know, the kind you can dissolve a spoon in). Not as bitter or acidic as I was expecting though, which was a very good thing. Yet, there is a subtle harshness that transcends into the alcoholic warmth of the brew. Creamy after creamy sip hits you right at the back of the throat to let you know there's alcohol in this one.

45,680,dirtylou,3.88,"12oz single  2005/2006 release, hauled 1000 miles from raleigh by blackie  appearance: pours a black/deep chocolate brown color into snifter, a light chocolatey head forms but nothing substantial, not a whole lot in the way of lacing  smell: rich and roasty, sweet and creamy dark chocolate, mocha/espresso, faint alcohol, touch of dark fruit  taste: deep and rich, loads of roasted malts, sweet and creamy chocolate, espresso, alcohol is a little too noticable i think, figs, plum, cherrys soaked in alcohol, some very good things going on here but its tough for me to put it in the bells/founders/alesmith category...i'll hold on to my other bottle for a while probably  mouthfeel: a little on the thin side, but still silky and creamy  drinkability: quite drinkable, but the alcohol could be hidden better  been wanting to try this for a while...had a 6 pack in my hand in rehoboth beach last summer but i think i had already bought about 1000 dollars worth of beer on that trip so i put it back",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,medic25,4.62,"Sampled the '05-'06 vintage. Dark black color with very little head or carbonation. The aroma is amazing; a chocolate/coffee blend. Taste is also mind-blowing. Very complex flavor; again dominated by the taste of chocolate and espresso, with just the right amount of alcohol. Goes down very smoothly for 8.5%. One of the best stouts I've ever had the pleasure of trying.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Viggo,4.2,"Pours a pretty opaque black, some red on the edges, thick tan head, good retention and some nice lace. Smell is fucking powerful, cherries, coffee, chocolate, some alcohol, insane roast. Taste is some sour cherries up front, which disappears by the end of the glass, roasted coffee and chocolate, some alcohol, and a roasty chocolate finish. Mouthfeel was medium to thick bodied, with medium carbonation, lots of alcohol warming. The alcohol is a little hot but otherwise really nice. Thanks DrJay!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mzwolinski,4.39,"Winter 03-04 edition, reviewed January 2006  Pours opaque, black and thick looking, with a thinnish dark tan head that quickly fizzes away into nothingness. The aroma is surprisingly sweet and chocolatey -- it's amazing that they can accomplish this with malts alone! Flavors hits with a huge roasted malt flavor right from the start. It becomes a bit sweeter mid-palate, with something of a milky texture on the tongue, and finally blends (ever-so-smoothly) into a roasty and moderately hopped finish, leaving a nice tingly feeling on the tongue. Subtle in its graduations of flavor, this is a surprisingly complex beer that has stood the test of time well, without sacrificing anything in the way of drinkability. Yummy.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Birdiebeagle,4.42,"12 oz bottle At The Washington House tasting Poured a thick black with red tints. Had a dark head. Aroma of malty chocolate, carmel and raisins.

45,680,SaCkErZ9,3.52,"Winter 05-06 offering. Dispensed from 12oz bottle into a large, widemouthed wine glass. Possibly due to the glass shape, not sure, but the beer poured rather lackluster. A thick, motor oil consistency, pitch black, very small cappucino head that leaves almost immediately. I was hoping for a little more head retention and size, but glassware could be to blame for this.  Wonderful smell. Raisins, figs, alcohol, chocolate, coffee, dried plums. The main aromas that stick out in my nose are the chocolate and coffee with a strong consideration for the alcohol aroma. I would like the alcohol to be a little more subdued in the aroma to allow the other flavors to shine and make their presence felt. I hesitate to sample this one with that huge alcoholic nose.  Chocolate is huge in the taste. The alcohol follows behind very nicely. Alcoholic aroma is the bite and the taste is the bark; not bad. Sticky sweetness is in there as well. I fear this will become too sweet and alcoholic as it warms.  Sticky mouthfeel. Cloying as well. Drinkability is a hard one for me to decide on. I think this one missed the mark a bit overall.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MSchae1017,4.47,This beer was tasted in a snifter glasss from a bottle.  The beer pours a dark opaque black with a huge dark tan head. The head doesn't hold too well or lace too well but it is a nice looking beer. The beer smells of roasted dark chocolate malts. And that is the taste also. There is also a significant dryness attched to the beer. There is a fantastic thickness with a good carbonation. Overall this is definitely a beer that I would love to have every year during the winter.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DrJay,4.2,"'05-'06: Black beer with a mocha head composed of fine bubbles. Extended, spotty lacing and good retention. Roasty, dark chocolate aroma, a bit of nuttiness and significant alcohol. Bitter chocolate flavour throughout, with plenty of malt sweetness and roast. Plenty of bitterness, which lingers into the finish along with the chocolate character and a mild cherry flavour. Silky texture with a roasted dryness and fine carbonation. It had a fair bit of alcohol warmth in the finish. Quite tasty overall and it would go great with dessert.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ElGordo,3.56,"Pours a deep dark black topped by about one finger of creamy brown head that clings nicely to the glass. Rich aroma of dark, earthy malt, with notes of peat, dark chocolate, and soy sauce. Palate up front is an odd, slightly unpleasant blend of soy sauce and dark chocolate. A transition to rich sweetness comes next, with notes of milk chocolate and prunes coming out. Finish is rich and chocolatey, with nice warming from the alcohol. Body is thick, smooth, rich, creamy, and as close to perfect as you can get. An enjoyable, if strange, experience. Perhaps my bottle was a bit lightstruck.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,wingnutter,4.03,"Black as coal in the glass, and smells like an Imperial Stout - chocolate, alcohol, roasted malts, coffee.  Mocha and raisins/figs come through in the flavor. Very tasty.

Smell: Roased malts, with hints of chocolate and coffee  Taste: The dark malt really shines through here with complementary flavors of chocolate, coffee, and alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, silky mouthfeel. Very smooth  Drinkability:The alcohol conent of this make it a sipper. Make it the last one of the night and savor it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,weeare138,4.62,"This is the '05-'06 version... Appears black with a light brown hue when held to the light. Fluffy head slowly fades and leaves scattered lacing all over the glass. Smell is of roasted nuts, chocolate malts, fudge brownie, black grape, along with a mild hop profile that comes through. Taste is of the same aromas with that mild hoppiness that seems to be citrusy with a touch of mint. Mouthfeel is creamy with roasted sugary notes sticking to the tongue and swarming the palate with it's smooth richness. Drinkability- A delicious dessert brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,evh883,4.65,"Outstanding! I can't wait for the winter months to roll around each year so I can get myself a case of this to savor. As black and opaque as possible when put up to light, its appearance has a light brown head that follows the pour and gives great lacing. It has a strong aroma of coffee and deeply roasted malts. The flavor follows that up with more coffee, roasted and burnt notes and also has a very strong hoppiness. A tiny taste of alcohol is there too. The beer feels like oil in your mouth with carbonation that compliments it perfectly. Overall, this is probably the best beer I have ever had and it is an absolute must for anyone that likes craft beers!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jtell,4.25,"A - Reddish/Brown 1/2 finger head poured into an oversized wine glass. Head dissipates quickly. Beer itself is quite dark. Not much if any light shows through at all.  S - Roasted malt and chocolate  T - Alcohol is big. Chocolate, malts and coffee come through as the beer settles in my mouth.  M - Not too carbonated feels silky. Very nice.  D - Beer really needs a little while to mellow out. Had last years recently and it was unbelievable. I will buy some more and let that cellar for some time. Hopefully I will be able to find a place that has a couple of last years sitting around. If not, just need to find other beers to drink before this one is ready. Definitely buy it if you see it though.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,pentathlete,4.43,"Lightless jet with a creamy brown (not beige) head, minimal lacing. I haven't seen dirty oil this dark, just a perfect color in the snifter. Nose is roasted malt and dark chocolate with a touch of alcohol, not sure if this is a desert or digestif, we'll see from the taste. Slick entrance of malt, hops coming out to bitter the edges, and the chocolate, seeming both milk and semi-sweet blend it all together. This is an exceptional brew. Mouthfeel is creamier than chocolate cream. Too easy to quaff for the style and ABV. This is the 05-06 version. A pure winner. Get it. Love it. Wrap it in a heart shape box and give it to your significant other on Valentine's Day. Better than chocolate.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Winter,4.6,"Pours black with a creamy brown tan head. Vinous aroma consisting of roasted grain, milk chocolate and alcohol. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and coating. It's thick and sticky on the lips. Taste is simply amazing. Starts off with roasted grains and sweet chocolate and molasses. Super malty. Traces of caramel. Alcohol and dark fruit flavors convert to an almost rum-soaked cherry flavor that's rather intriguing and appears near the back. Alcohol is apparent, yet not overpowering. Best enjoyed slowly and as a sipper.  Special thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the opportunity to enjoy this masterpiece.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,matdot,4.63,"05-06 Picked from a Brooklyn Multi Pack.  Poured in a Tumbler with a two finger, thick chocolate color head. Wow, what an awesome color the head turns after being poured.

Exceptional Imperial, and another classic from Brooklyn Brewery.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

This is really good.  T - A strong chocolate malt flavor that is slightly sweet and complimented beautifully by dates. The aftertaste isn't powerful, but it has a little malt and floral character to it.  M - Thick, creamy, smooth, very good.  D - It is a bit rich, but I had no trouble finishing it. This is easily my favorite stout to date.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,bjohnson,4.38,"Pulled from the cellar and served at room temp.  A: Pours a jet black color with a caramel colored one finger head. Retention holds on the sides of the glass leaving nice lacing as it goes down. S: Deep chocolate malt notes with a slight grassy hop presence. Spicyness of the abv is noticeable. T/M: Thick and syrupy like engine oil, although very silky smooth mouthfeel. Chocolate malt notes with sweet caramel and dark fruit interludes. Bitterness in the dry finish with an unsweetened chocolate bitter aftertaste. Leafyness also noticeable in the aftertaste. High abv is noticeable, but not overpowering--spicyness can be detected but doesn't interfere with other flavors or mouthfeel. D: Very tasty RIS from Brooklyn. I've had it on tap and in the bottle seems to allow the flavors to come out and breath a bit. Not that it's bad on tap, because it's great, the bottle just allows you more reoom to breath. Also, at room temp is obviously better than chilled.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,daliandragon,4.4,"This beer has been around for years and I've been a local and Brooklyn fan for years and not until now have the twain met. I didn't realize until recently how famous this beer was so I'm almost embarrassed it took this long for me to try it. This brew is jet black with a decent hunk of tannish head. The nose is full of malt, mainly the described dark chocolate, rich and enticing...wow. The taste is deliciously dry and rich. Absolutely dripping with heavy handed malt and a brilliant chocolate and coffee aftertaste. Mouthfeel here is heavier than a lead weight and thicker than a homemade milkshake. You can practically hang your hat on this beer and its smooth as silk to boot. Yeah, you can see you're in the presence of royalty here. I never really thought I'd see a serious competitor to Youngs Double but Brookyln definitely does the borough proud with this offering.

45,680,EPseja,4.11,"Served from a 12oz. bottle at cellar temperature in a Duvel tasting glass.  A - Pours a deep, dark umber brown color with crimson highlights, leaving the bottle with a curious viscosity. The head is slow to rise but when it does, it puffs up to a full three fingers of cocoa colored micro-bubbled wonderment! As it *very slowly* subsides to an even carpet, the bubbles stick to the side of the glass with an incredible tackiness that eventually forms velour drapes of lacing. In the glass, there is no overlooking the opaque blackness from whence came that part of this beer's name. Absolutely fantastic!  S - As with the obvious ""black"" in the appearance, the chocolate nose is very strong in the smell. Also noticeable are hints of sweet pralines, molasses, a tinge of coffee, and a foreshadowing of the alcohol to come.  T - The chocolatey toasty malts jump out of the gate with serious conviction upon taking a swig. Dark, high cocoa percentage chocolate is the predominant taste in the middle. As this beer reaches the back of the throat, a pleasant bitterness dries up the mouth and a port-wine style alcohol becomes evident. The swallow is followed up with a sweet, but mild post-dark-chocolate cloying coupled with an interesting licorice-herbal essence.  M - This beer goes in with a serious viscosity that's ladened with a pleasant, tingly effervescence. In the mouth it transforms into a chewy whipped foam remesniscent of a light chocolate mousse. The finish is throat coating and big, leaving a light tingle on the bitter part of the palate as well as a warming alcohol in the belly. Oh so nice!  D - This is a fantastic and very satisfying beer -- without a doubt one of the best in the Brooklyn stable. What it lacks in taste and smell complexity (which isn't that much at all) it makes up for in superb look and feel. This beer should be a definite inclusion in everyone's winter beer stash.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Phatz,4.66,"This is on of my absolute favorite beers. It has become a staple beer to have in my fridge. I have used it for cooking regularly as well. In brownies it is fantastic. Cooking some pork chops in it is divine, but of coarse there is nothing better than enjoy a pint next to some chocolate truffles. Mmm.  Appearance: WOW! This is as black as they come. I thought I had seen a black beer before but ... this is truly black. Great 3 finger head in my pint glass. Superb lacing! Overall; exceptional appearance.  Smell: The name says it all! Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout, not surprisingly, smells like chocolate. It is neither bitter nor sweet but blend of the two. The smell of roasted malts and toffee hide behind the chocolate, and hang in the back of your nose.  Taste: Unbelievable! This is perfectly balanced bitter-sweet roasted chocolate malts. Then there is a slight hint of a coffee mocha in the aftertaste. Thats it! As unexpected as it is, I found this to be a surprisingly simple taste. But its one that demands: ""Accept me, I'm perfect."" I usually prefer more complex and thought provoking flavors; however, this smooth dream-come-true shouts ""Throw a log on the fire, put your feet up and watch the snowfall outside, because it is ALL good in here""!  Mouthfeel: This is perfection! It's the most soft, fluffy, creamy, full, hearty yet gentle mouthfeel I have encountered to date!  Drinkability: While this is one of the easiest beers in your mouth, it would be wrong to waste the experience by drinking it too fast. Also, insist on letting this one warm up to just below room temp or you'll really miss out. Respect this beer. It is a marvelous creation. It goes down so easy that before you know it your picking up the pace. Slow down. Sip this while you relax with the family on a cold winter night.  Hope this is helpful.

Once poured the alcohol become more evident  T - Nice roasted maltiness. The chocolate is just right not too much. You also have some bitterness and of course the alcohol kick  M- Bold and solid definatley feels like you drinking something hearty  D- Drinkability is high becuase the alcohol isn't too much and the chocolate isn't too sweet and overbearing.

45,680,charlottebeerguy,4.08,"Poured out of a 12oz brown bottle labeled winter 05-06  Drinking this beer out of a brooklyn snifter. served at about 45 degrees.   This beer pours a midnight black color with a 1/2 inch light coffee colored head. The head seems to disappear fairly quickly, but still leaving a thin layer above the liquid itself.  The nose is of chocolate currant and alchohol, also some other dark fruits.  Taste the chocolate very well, a sweet and bitter blend which seems to mask the alchohol on the tounge better than on the nose. There also seems to be a hint of sour tartness on the finish, leaving you with a slight pucker..The over all finish is smoothe and well balanced.  I would say this is a fairly full bodied stout, with great characteristics. Will drink again for sure.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,qcitydarkstar,4.25,"When I first poured this beer, I could smell the chocolate and heavily roasted malts from across the room. The appearance was an opaque black with an inch of creamy head. The smell is indicative of the taste, as this is one is all semisweet chocolate and malts. This is a fantastic brew, but the mouth feel is heavy, as if I was drinking chocolate milk. I've never been a big fan of Brooklyn Brewery, well until now that is.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,doubleipa,4.6,"Yum. Great aroma of molasses and chocolate. A very creamy head that lasted a long time with great lacing. Black color, of course. There is a moderately acidic intial flavor that lessens a bit. Palate is medium-full, syrupy with a moderate alcoholic finish. Finish is loooong. Can't wait to see what a year in the cellar will do for this. This is really an outstanding double stout. Probably my favorite Brooklyn beer in the bottle.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,andjusticeforale,3.86,"An aggressive pour to a pint glass leaves a 1 cm fast-dissipating head of dark tan with ruby highlights. The beer itself is black with a reddish underglow, a ruby bottom.  There is a roasted smell but also a predominantly caramel aroma, rounded out with malty goodness.  The taste at first is smooth and infinitely deep. There is a soily earthy quality to the middle, with some smoked/roasted malts and flavoring hops. The end game is all about alcohol, moderate bittering hops as well, and a smooth, mocha breadiness. I searched ans searched for more chocolate flavor, based upon the brewers claims of chocolate taste, but I could not find it. I ended up saying, who cares this was smooth and completely drinkable, chocolate or not.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,pbr85,4.5,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Black as black can be, with a nice, two finger, coffee ice cream colored head that diminishes slowly. The lacing is phenomenal.  Smell: Strong presence of roasted malts, chocolate, and a little bit of alcohol.  Taste: Coffee and chocolate dominate through the first sip. After a few sips you can start to detect alcohol flavors towards the end with strong roasted coffee malts and bitter chocolate. There are hints of hops midway through the sip.  Mouthfeel: Great carbonation, it feels like the chocolate is melting in your mouth.  Drinkablility: For a stout it is very drinkable. I probably couldn't drink more than a few, but that is true for all the stouts I've tried.  Notes: Looks great, smells great, tastes great. I highly recommend this stout, it is one of the best.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MattBrooks,2,"I wanted to rate this lower, but just couldn't bring myself to do it. Not at all the beer I remember from years past and certainly not a Black Chocolate Stout. Pours pitch black with a brownish rim and absolutely no head. Had to really concentrate to get any aroma at all, and I still can't place what it is. Finally, this beer has a metallic taste; like I was drinking nickels or something. I'm curious to try it again, because this is a beer I used to like, say four-to-five years ago; but I was completely unimpressed this time.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

A very nice beer indeed.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,clabaugh,4.23,"Appearance: A majestic beer. This stout pours a thick, creamy, tawny colored head. Thick lacing coats the side of the glass all the way through this beer. Completely opaque, this beer presents a dark black color.  Smell: Roasted coffee bean and dark chocolate. A full maltiness pervades as one inhales: sweet and certainly full of chocolate. The smell of alcohol announces itself as well, reminding the nose of a liquer. Rich and aromatic even before tasting it, Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout is a pleasure for all senses.  Taste: Dark chocolate maltiness, with roasted overtones. One is also reminded of flavored coffee. Strangely, a faint trace of oily hops manages to infiltrate the intense maltiness. Decadent chocolate and some oily hops yields a refreshing stout.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and silky body with a slightly carbonated finish. Pleasantly light for a stout, but light in a truly satisfying way. A bit watery at the end, but not so far as to detract much from the beer.  Drinkability: Very drinkable for a stout. A very sensual beer that is satisfying in all respects. Despite not being a stout connoisseur, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

While I have always enjoyed this one from the bottle, the draft version is almost PERFECT. The coffee and chocolate flavor is very much pronounced, but not overwhelming. While the bottle version ""hides"" the high ABV; the draft is even more dangerous, as you cannot really feel the alcohol until afterwards. The carbonation is very soft.

Chocolate and rich coffee taste along with raosted malts in this heavy stout. Syrup like body that goes down very smoothly. There are sweet tastes of raisins. The hops are fairly tasty and add to this complex brew. As this goes down there is a warming feeling but the alcohol is hidden well. I would like to try this beer again in a year or so as it could only get better. Very good beer and it follows with a well rounded aftertaste of darker malts.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jslot38,4.43,"Presentation: 12 oz Bottle from the 2005-06 winter.  Appearance: Head is magestic. A hard but balanced pour produces a large head that slowly fades to an inch or so. Colour is black ink, jet fuel even. Head is light brown mocha, tan if you will. Lacing also stands up for as the head reduced a layer of lacing was already forming. Could probably go on forever about this.  Smell: Primarily chocolate and mocha coffee stand out in this wonderfully aromatic beer. Absolutly love the deep and dark chocolate aspects of this smell, though the backbone of chocolate covered coffee beans - espresso, make this smell very intriguing.  Taste: Easily reminds me of why I love this style. Rich flavors of baker's chocolate, unsweetend, but certainly dark. As a stout there is a minimal hop presence (but its there), and there is a great dark and deep roasted barley taste. After taste is phenomenal as the chocolate transforms to have many complex coffee bean undertones.  Mouthfeel: As said before, hold on... uh... I have to mention that the lacing orginally formed after the pour is quite literally clinging to the side of my glass as I am half way through this beer. Now, back to the mouthfeel; it is quite literally roasted, but smooth with minimal carbonation. Goes down cleanly, yet entices the palate so well.  Notes: Easily at the top of my list for not only stouts, but beers in general. Great with deserts, oh my... what it must be to enjoy this with a hunk of chocolate mousse. Death by chocolate... no, death by Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout. I give a 4.0 to drinkability for I am a chocolate and stout lover, so the combination of the two makes me believe I could drink a few of these, and there isn't an alcohol presence (even at 8.5%) that turns me away. A great, amazing, brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,LuckySkuff,4.63,"I'll try to be succinct; I've honestly acted quite unwisely and have had three of these in the last two hours (quiet night at home, I'm allowed). Terrifically, absolutely delicious, and the ABV really sneaks up on ya - the mouthfeel is so rich and the body is so perfect, you can barely taste the alcohol.  Poured a dark black/brown hue with a little chocolate brown head. Very little to no carbonation to battle the pleasantly thick mouthfeel. Smells of tasty roasted malts, faint chocolate, mildly alcoholic; the taste is exactly what you'd expect - warming and creamy, and chocolatey. A lot like Bison Chocolate Stout, just a little richer and a bit more alcoholic. Easy to fall in love with.  As I said, this one goes down smooth, so be careful. Sorry to be so succinct; just try it if you haven't.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,barknee,4.71,"Winter 05-06 Vintage... Pours espresso brown and totally opaque confirmed by using all types of high lumen output devices! Pours with a generous 1/2"" deep mocha brown head with admirable retention. Agitating the glass after the head settles rejuvenates it to its original poured state! Outrageous, although slightly repressed aromas of bittersweet dark chocolate and rich lightly roasted malts dominate the nose, as does the alcohol which smacks you gently in the face as it ascends from the glass. The taste is fantastic; with essences of slightly sweetened concentrated imported dark chocolate, well malted with the perfect balance of hops; adding the absolute perfect balance of hop acidity that keeps this stout crisp & vibrant. The mouthfeel is primo; creamy, lively and satisfying, extremely well balanced. Drinkability is unexpectedly superior; this is no overweight slug here! This Brooklyn Bad Ass will offer fans of the style an undeniable and unquestionably enjoyable quaffing experience. Like all ""Vintage"" products, expect each edition to vary somewhat as the formulary may change as does the quality of the ingredients available to the brewer each season. Although earlier ""vintages"" of this brew received lukewarm marks by some, this current Vintage is completely off the hook; this would be challenging to dispute! Very highly recommended!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,akahn,4.03,"Let me start out by saying that this is my first imperial stout, my first chocolate stout, my first beer remotely like this. The first one of these I had I didn't really like. But it grew on me. Here is my review.  Marked for winter '05-'06.  This beer is very dark, nearly obsidian, but with some faint red hues. It pours into my tumbler with a modestly-sized creamy brown (as in brown sugar) head with lots of crazy lacing.  The nose is spicy, bitter chocolate and nutmeg.  The taste is bitter, bittersweet chocolate. This, mixed with the spiciness (nutmeg, cinammon flavors? maybe brown sugar too?) makes it like mexican chocolate. At the finish, the alcohol comes to the fore. It is warm and spicy -- the interaction of the spiciness of the alcohol and the spiciness of the actual flavors in the beer is interesting. Notes of caramel and some roastiness, too.  Low carbonation, very full body and very smooth.  This beer is so sweet that it leaves my lips feeling sticky (it is more of a richness than a sweetness). I don't get that with most beers I drink (granted, I've mostly drank paler beers).  This is a tasty beer. It took me a few to get acquainted with it, but in the end, very good. I like. I recommend. And it was good with Thanksgiving pumpkin pie, too. It's so rich that I can't give it very high marks for drinkability, but one is certainly good.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,klewis,3.83,"2005-2006 release  A: Poured dark black with a modest dark tan head. Lots of sticky lace on the glass.  S: Aromas of dark fruits, and a little bit of chocalate  T: I remember last year's tasting much different (and better). This one has an interesting earthy flavor mixed with banana and an interesting lack of chocolate flavor. Lots of hops in the flavor, but there's also a slight sweetness to it. Espresso-like flavors in the finish.  M: Typical of a stout.  D: I remembered this being so much better. Still a good beer though and at a good price.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Dithyramb,3.41,"Perfectly pictured stout pour--jet black, no light peering through, dark tan everlasting head with perfect lacing--from this season's (2005-2006) version. Came out in the classic oil like delivery.  Feel the nose and the taste were one sided. Heavily influenced by the bitter range with super dark malts and chalky bitterness. Didn't feel it had the necessary depth that one would expect from something that is supposedly a classic.  Perhaps some bitter Turkish coffee grind flavors, but little to no sweetness. Dark chocolate was here, but only in the lingering mouthfeel. It was initially bitter, but as I sat and talked with those around me, I definitely picked up some expensive dark chocolate notes, but not in the overall flavor profile. Alcohol esters, some old molasses, and bourbon touches are here as well. Just felt a bit one sided to me.  Rich, full flavored brew, just doesn't seem well rounded enough for several.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JerzDevl2000,4.57,"Picked it up recently, this year's edition just got stocked in my local liquor store within the last two weeks. I like most of the Brooklyn beers, so I eagerly anticipated this offering. This beer met and exceeded my expectations, which is something I don't say very often!  Poured a standard textbook stout color - nearly black and opaque. Not too thick, but the head nearly filled up to the top of my pint glass and took a bit of time to settle down. Notes of toffee, currant, espresso, coffee, and black cherries add loads of depth to the various flavors of chocolate which form the backbone of this brew's notes. The various flavors work wonderfully together and never overpower any of the senses and additionally, the regular and dark chocolate base lingers wonderfully with each aftertaste. Very smooth and only a trace of the alcohol can be felt in between sips, which isn't bad considering it's 8.5% ABV content!  The bitterness is present a bit during tastings, swishings, and in between sips. It's more than balanced by the full melody of flavors, and this beer is very difficult to chug down due to it's richness and warmth. Brooklyn Brewery shouuld be commended for a concoction that is worth looking forward to during the winter, and worth savoring during the cold nights of the season. A must-have for the stout enthusiast!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Stimack,4,"Have the 2005  06 version from the variety pack. Brew pours to a pitch-black color, not much if any light coming through this brew. Has a medium sized dark brown head that has fair retention and leaves quite a bit of lace around the top half of the glass. Aromas of chocolate, charcoal, black/burnt malts and dark fruits are highly noticeable. Taste is of dark malts, chocolate, slight alcohol burn mixed in a very dry feel. Very nice tasting brew, good drinkability even with the 8.5% ABV. This is the first time I have had it in bottles and I think I like it better than on tap. Will allow the other one I have from the pack age and then re-review.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,twelvsies,4.17,"Another solid beer from the Brooklyn Brewery. This is pretty much your textbook stout, fits the style perfectly, but yet has it's own personality. Blackish brown color, little to no head though. I love to smell paint in a beer, and I smell it in this one. Nice. There's also a ton of roasted barley and chocolate malt scents combining with hints of dark cherries and raisins. Taste is very delicate and desert-like. So sweet, with a nice chocolate quality stepping up to the plate, but not dominting the whole beer. Richly complex. I can definately taste the ""double"" in this double chocolate stout. A nice kick of warming alcohol as it goes down the throat, but not really detectable in the taste. Velvety smooth creamy mouthfeel, excellent. I've had this one on draft too which gives it a little more carbonation, which might slightly edge out this bottled version. Either way, this is a sturdy beer that would be pretty hard for any beer drinker to find fault in. Good stuff.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,sinistrsam,4.25,"I had yet to try anything from Broolyn when I stubled upon a cache of Brooklyn Beers on special at a bar. I carefully selected this double with no predispositions and gave it what I would call a very fair test. Here were my findings. It poured very dark, absolutely opaque, with a somewhat fizzy dark tan head. I use the term fizzy to distinguish it from the faomy head some people might be expecting from a Murphy's/Guiness style. There was little lacing left behind after the head dissapated. The smell was very intense; roasted malts and chocolate assault the nose. Also alcohol, and some coffee. The taste was certainly chocolaty, once again with plenty of roasted malts, coffee, possibly some subtle fruits. You can definitely taste the alcohol, but it is masked well with a good balance of ingredients and tastes. It finishes smooth and defintiely warms you up. Brooklyn, I'm impressed.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The aroma is none other than....you guessed it chocolate! There is also a hint of alcohol and the malty goodness that is to come.  The taste is knock you out chocolate with malts in the middle and a nice warming effect from the alcohol. Not overpowering but just as the name suggest a black chocolate stout.  The mouthfeel was id say medium but i do dring a lot of double stouts. Great though i thought it was going to be a bit more watery but i was plesently surprised to find that is was at a happy medium  Drinkabilty is high but i only scored it a 4.0 because after 3 or 4 your spent  Overall i had waited for this brew and the wait was well worth it.

45,680,auntfloyd,4.16,"Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout, Winter 2005 release, poured from a chilled 12oz bottle into a Brooklyn Brewery snifter glass reccomended for this beer,  Appearance: BCS pours nice, thick, and black. Not the heaviest stout I've seen, but still plenty of heft to it. One finger of medium brown head, which disappears quickly.  Smell: Scents of chocolate, coffee, alcohol, in that order, with the alcohol somewhat overpowering the others.  Taste: Where Brooklyn Chocolate Stout shines. This is a truly excellent stout in all respects. Deep, dark chocolate flavors, with a distinct coffee/roasted malt aftertaste. A stout drinker's stout.  Feel: Thick and smooth, with very little carbonation. Very nice.  Drinkability: Very drinkable for its style. Definitely not an everyday beer of course. Nice for dessert.  Overall, the 2005 release is an amazing beer, and an excellent showing from Brooklyn Brewery. A major improvement over last year's version, if you tried that.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Beersignal,4.15,"This is one I have been waiting several years to get my mitts on. I used to read tasting notes on this one and drool, always wondering when I would get a chance to take my own notes... here I go.  Like most stouts I drink, this one is nearly coal black and lets nary a ray of light poke through. The head is generous enough, thick, creamy and lasts admirably all while leaving a handsome lace behind.  The aromas are subtle, harmonious, and complex enough to yield fresh nuances at nearly every whiff. From malty charred notes up front followed by hints of coffee and licorice to a mild hoppy bite in the finish, one finds traces of spices and some stewed fruits in the mix. A mild vinous character binds the aromas in a harmonious manner and makes the experience quite pleasing.  It is in the mouth, however, that this beer really shines. Firm and bold in body, it is rich and filling and makes no apology about this fact. The flavours are as complex as the aromas but are in your face and very robust. Malt, chocolate and coffee flavours form the sturdy underpinning on which the balance of this beer rests. Some notes of bitterness permeate the complex of the above flavours and bind with a delicate but present tartness reminescent of a mulled Quelque Chose. The finish is dominated by a charred and heady bitterness that lingers, accompanied by traces of oak.  This is surely one of the most flavourful and complex stouts I have had the chance to review. Such a heady and full bodied beer lasts a long time and doesn't constitute a session beer. However, I would definitely indulge in two bottles of this at desert (thus salvaging the drinkability score) This is by no means available in Québec... I had to rely on my uncle to bring me back a 12 of this so I should be good until x-mas.  Merci André.  Santé  SMD",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jakester,4.5,"This is from the new Brooklyn Party Pack sampler case. Date notched on the label. I drank it in a goblet.  Pours a totally opaque black with a one finger head of light brown foam. The head falls to a coating and a ring, with good lacing.  Aroma is sweet chocolate, vanilla, black sweet coffee, dark cherries, and currants. Maybe some spices like black pepper, vanilla, and even cayenne.  First flavor is sweet dark mocha coffee, some bitter chocolate, fruits like cherries and prunes, and spices like pepper and vanilla. Flavors are big and sweet. Aftertaste is awesome dark chocolate, thick and rich, with a lingering hop bitterness. Hop flavor is earthy and floral.  Mouthfeel is thick and rich, smooth and creamy. Carbonation is soft. Residual sugar is pretty high. Slight alcohol warmth in the finish.  This is one hell of a delicious pounder. Big, dark flavors, fruity, chocolatey, malty, with a good alcohol kick.

45,680,PBRstreetgang,4.15,"Winter '05 batch. Pours pitch black, with ruby highlights. Light brown three finger head, dense and bubbly. Outstanding retention and patchy lacing. Dark fruit alcohol vapors and burnt malt hide a gentle hop aroma. Sweet roasted barley and chocolate malts make up a bittersweet and well rounded flavor, and american hops dry the aftertaste to improve the balance. Full thick body and low carbonation keep the big flavor velvet smooth. Alcohol becomes evident in the finish, but never harsh. Residual, intoxicating, and very satisfying.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Initial taste is of chocolate, then some roastyness then some bittersweet. I also detect coffee, but not a great amount of coffee bitterness. Nicely balanced.

The flavor is impressive, big chocolate and coffee notes as well as some blackstrap molasses that is checked by some floral and mineraly hops bitterness, as well as tobacco and a smokey character. The finish has notes of cherry brandy with a mild alcohol character. The mouthfeel is rich and full without being overbearing and drinkability is surprisingly good for a double stout.

45,680,blackie,4.45,"appearance: The pour into my snifter creates a low, tan head that quickly dissipates, leaving only a few carbonation-fed islands on the calm surface of the liquid. When they named this beer ""Black,"" they meant it. No light whatsoever makes it through this baby.  smell: A very distinctive and pleasant bittersweet and milk chocolate aroma is present, and in just the right amount. This stuff smells great. Some roasted coffee like flavors, are present, though the coffee charateristic is slight. There is also a slight earthy tobacco/molasses like characteristic, almost like chewing tobacco. A nice, low to moderate hop aroma comes through to provide some balance. The smell is sweet like dessert, but not cloyingly so. Only a little ethanol is noticeable, which is ok since this one weighs in at 8.5 percent.  mouthfeel: Carbonation is a nice cross between low and medium, just right in my opinion. The body is on the lower end of the heavy range.  taste: The chocolate is not as obvious on the tongue as on the nose, but is still there. The roasted flavors, however, are more apparent here...though they only offer a slight hint of coffee. There is even a slight smoky taste to the beer. Just the right amount of hops. Finish is roasty with a slight hop bitterness. No ethanol detected at all. Damn good.  drinkability: Just about as drinkable as a double stout can get.

Smell: Strong chocolate smell. Slight alcohol armoa but not overly so.  Taste: Strong notes of coffee, dark chocolate, a tangy sort of prune flavor. Espresso flavor aftertaste.

45,680,ChainGangGuy,3.7,"('05-'06 release)  Appearance: Pours a soulless black from which no hope can escape. Looks good!! Tan, cocoa-ish head with little to no lacing throughout.  Smell: Reminds me of Kahlua 'Especial' coffee liqueur if anyone here is familiar with that. Espresso, fudge brownies, and a twing of smoke. You can also detect the delightful zip of alcohol in there.  Taste: An unstoppable coffee-chocolate juggernaut. The flavors hit hard, full, and quite unforgiving. Moreover, there's some hints of biscuits and syrah. Finishes leaving behind a bitter coffee essence to punish the tongue.  Mouthfeel: Holds very solid in the mouth, but maintains a good creaminess.

45,680,TurdFurgison,4.35,"Poured from a bottle into Stone Ruination glass (kind of mini-pint glass). Dark black color with brown (chocolate milk colored) foamy head.  Smells fruity and malty. The first taste is sweet, with a nice bitter after-taste. The chocolate comes through in the after-taste mostly. You can taste some roasted malts too. But not too burnt, which would be gross. There's a lot of carbonation which adds to this beer's drinkability. That's a problem I have with many stouts, they're too flat. Not this one!  Recommended. This is very good stuff.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,nickss,4.27,"Pours a pitch black with perhaps the darkest head I've ever seen... not even a khaki, but an intense brown. The head itself is fairly thin, maybe 1/8"". Nice lacing as well.  Big chocolate aromas. Slightly bitter, but with a HUGE berry aroma. Reminds me a great deal of Storm King, albeit with a bit more mocha than the Victory brew. All the same... glorious odor... I love it.  Intense mocha flavour with a large amount of chocolate bitterness. The berries that were in the nose are prominent in the taste as well, but not so obvious. You can definitely notice a bit of alcohol in the finish, but nothing too strong or overwhelming. There is a significant roasted malt flavour to this one as well. My only concern from the taste is the seeming lack of complexity. It is a huge mocha slap to the palate, but not much more.  Not quite big enough in the mouth to match the huge chocolate flavour.  Moderately drinkable... the more I drink of this bottle, the more I want to keep drinking it.

Deep chocolate and toasted malt aroma with an undercurrent of spicy alcohol and dark fruits. Stupendous flavor! Chewy sweet malts lead into tasty burnt toast and dark-roasted coffee with nicely drying and long-lasting toasted bread and warming alcohol finish.

I assume you can, and, if not, go back to school. It smells so delicious, I can't wait to get it to my mouth.  Taste: It's good, just not great. I really enjoy drinking this brew. The chocolate flavors predominate. It's tasty, just not quite as complex as other beers of similar style.  Mouthfeel: I was expecting it to be too syrupy, but it wasn't at all. Smooth and highly penetrating, but only in a good way.  Drinkability: I could drink these all day. So easy to get down. I just wish there was a bit more too it.

45,680,chOAKbarrell,3.9,"The title ""Black Chocolate Stout"" is a bit deceptive, as this is really an Imperial Stout.  It has all the usual characteristics of an imperial - the deep black hue, very present alcohol taste, mocha and chocolate flavors.  This beer also has a pleasant creaminess to it which I found delicious. I'd prefer for the always-present alcohol flavor to be disguised better, but I suppose if it was, I wouldnt be drinking an imperial stout - it would just be a regular stout.  This is a powerful beer. I dont think I'd really want to have more than 1 or 2 at a time.

Taste: Hey oddly enough taste like darkly roasted coffee, cocoa, good malty backbone with a complementing hop after taste.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is a very easy to drink beer.

Oddly, it tastes of Coffee, chocolate and raisins - go figure. No bitter or burnt notes, no alcohol tones detected and a mild vanilla finish.  Very creamy and smooth. Low carbonation so it feels like your'e drinking a mocha milkshake. No bitter or oily aftertastes.  Very drinkable, big enough that it ought to be served as a desert course all by itself.

This beer sort of confuses me. the bottle says it's a chocolate stout, BA calls it a double stout, the brewery calls it an imperial stout...which is it? I don't know, possibly a combo of all three. The appearance is pitch black with a medium brown head that doesnt stick too much. Body is medium to heavy with smells of fudge-like chocolate,espresso and hint of rum. The taste is mildly hoppy with a bit of roasted bitterness showing up towards the end. When i first sipped this beer, i wasn't too impressed, but the more i drank, the more i liked.

Not as sweet as I expected. Quite the bitter chocolate instead. Not unpleasant at all. Smooth but a little uninspiring. I expected a bit more from this however...

45,680,DevilDogBeer,4.36,"The Black Chocolate Stout offering from Brooklyn Brewery for the 2005-2006 winter continues a great tradition from this New York Micro. The pour of this ebony stout is the picture of color for a black chocolate stout. The head that forms on the glass is a deep brown that starts strong and fades as the beer sits. The smell has a very malty nose with toasted overtones and a distinct alcohol aroma form the multiple mashing. The taste is bold with a roasted flavor up front fading into a chocolate undertone with distinct alcohol warmth. The selection of hops are ideal for this brew as they do not pronounce themselves in the taste or the aftertaste but keep the sweetness of the beer at a superb balance. This beer has a full-bodied texture that is smooth and satiny. This beer is a great drink to relax and unwind with as the days begin to cool and winter sets in.

45,680,AltBock,4.75,"12oz. bottle that was vintage winter of '04-'05. Although a year old, this beer ages well.  Appearance: Poured a thick black color that reminded me of motor oil. It was so thick you couldn't see through the beer. The head on it was about an inch thick and tan in color. A small amount of foam lasted the entire duration of drinking pleasure.  Smell: A pleasant aroma of sweet caramel, roasted coffee beans, that was all wrapped around in an roasted dark chocolate background. A nice treat!  Taste: Let's just say that they're telling the truth on the label. The tastes in this were dark roasted malts, roasted coffee beans, sweet caramel, and of course, dark chocolate. After being overwhelmed with these fine flavors, there was a pleasant bitter chocolate aftertaste. Another nice treat!  Mouthfeel: A big, powerful, full bodied beer that didn't bother to hide that 8.5% alcohol content. Although full-bodied, this beer goes down nice and smooth.  Drinkability: An excellent beer at an afforable price. I got a six-pack of vintage Black Chocolate Stout for only $7.99.

Smells of kahlua, smoke, coffee, chocolate and coffee. Chocolate and fruitiness ride the alcohol scent that makes my brain and nose say coffee liqueur.  Taste is a big hit of chocolate and coffee in the very first sip. Nice chest warming sensation from the alcohol level. Brown sugar makes an appearance as does fruit and toffee. Long lasting bitter after taste from the hops and dark malts but I am unable to identify exactly what this is very smoothly mixed. After 4 mouthfuls this smooths out and becomes just pure ambrosia to drink.  Milkshake thick and creamy probably the best mouthfeel I have experienced to date.  Drinkability is pure peace of heaven here. The only fault here is that the smell could be a bit more complex but it is debatable that it is not possible in a brew this strong. I have found a new favorite beer after drinking this. Now I just have to figure out how to get some more in California!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,fdrich29,4.34,"Well it's looking like a day of stouts and I just happened to have a Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout on hand, so I figured what the hell.  Body is pitch black with a thick, creamy tan head. The smell is absolutely amazing with strong waves of chocolate fudge.and coffee.  Tastes of chocolate, malts, bitterness and strong coffee. The mouthfeel is quite smooth.  I found this to be a wonderful beer to sip away at while keeping an eye on the football scores. Highly recommended.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,silver1audi,4.59,"First I'd like to say Hi to everyone.... I'm new here and fairly new to the craft beer scene, BA is great.  About this beer, I really enjoyed it. I picked up a 6 pack at Wegman's for $6.99 and broke into it as soon as I got home. It pours virtually black into a glass. It smells great; It actually smells a lot like dark chocolate. I don't even like dark chocolate and this beer made me want some! It tastes great too with a very strong flavor that is great late at night while relaxing after a long day.  I will definately buy this beer again, it's the type of beer that for me, a 6 pack will last a little while. Very enjoyable, but I would probably only have 1 or 2 of these in one setting. 6.99 wasn't that bad though for a beer like this, considering that Guiness costs over $8 for 6 beers. The only problem I have with it is it doesn't maintain much of a head.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,beerkeeper,2.86,"Found a bottle of 02 in my cellar. poured into a glass still maintained a substantial head the nose still has a nice roasty chocolate presence, but one gets a bit of sourness intermingled. in the mouth one still gets a good dose of carbonation, but these beer has passed its peak. the sourness on the nose comes through on the palate and coats the side of the mouth while the chocolate malts slide over the tounge. the aftertaste is much better than the initial flavoring, leaving behind a roasty flavor. just came back to this beer after 30 odd minutes the noose got stronger but hte palate definitly fell apart. this beer works much better as a two year old",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,beermanbrian,4.17,2004/05 version  Pours black as expected with a thin head. Looks tasty. Smell is chocolate/coffee and tons of toasted malt with a slight alcohol overtone. Taste has a strong chocolate edge as expected with a mocha feel to it. Very smooth and creamy on the tongue with a noticable alcohol warming on the way down. Strong brew that lives up to expectations. Highly recommended.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Puddleglum,4.61,"This was a nice experience. I was happy I had chosen this even though it was a little early in the year for me to indulge in an imperial stout. The color was black as pitch although the head was not very impressive. It did lace down the side of the glass nicely though. The smell was, as is to be expected, that of chocolate, coffee, sweet brown notes of all varieties as well as burnt and toasted malt. Yum! The taste pulled through with all the flavor the smell let on. The carbonation was a little low but this stout went down easy. Give it a spin if you have the chance.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,HopHeadKen,4.35,"I Like Stouts ! and I especially want to thank Steelreign for this trade ! !  Small Pfftt when the cap comes off, and it pours BLACK with a thin dark tan head, quickly fading to an island of thin lacing and a ring about the edge of the glass. I have to look hard in bright light to find the traces of deep amber on the fringe.  No sediment in the bottle, so it is unlikely that this is bottle conditioned.  This is a stout, so I automatically drink it at cellar temperature, which is about 70 deg in early September in Indiana.  Smell is roasty carmel malt; First taste is SMOOTH - roasty sweet carmel malt with a well blended subtle hop bitterness and alcohol warmth in the finish.  Throughout the rest of the glass this remains smooth and sweet, chocolate and plum with carmel and molasas. And something that I often find in stouts is a coffee flavor, but I do not get that here.  Nice mouthfeel, just the right amount of viscosity without being syrup (not thin); with warming alcohol on the tongue.  I wish I had a case of this ! Very nice. . .",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Head lasts throughout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BrewMaster,4.2,"Appearance: Murky black with the look of used motor oil as it pours from the bottle. Yikes. No light is coming through this bad boy. The head is a tan chocolate color with excellent retention.  Smell: Chocolate (surprise!), roastiness, candy sugar sweetness, and a mild sandy scent.  Taste: Rich and dry chocolate flavor backed by toasty licks of syrup sweetness. Moderate bitterness in the ending with floral and chocolate aftertaste. Very tasty though not terribly complex. The ending is thin and short and lacking the punch and flavor with which the flavor opens.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, full bodied, creamy.  Drinkability: This is a good beer with a rich and toasty smooth flavor. It is well balanced without any alcohol flavor that I could taste. Slightly warming. Definatley a dessert beer unless you eat chocolate cake for dinner.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,GClarkage,4.92,"08/11/05- Received bottles in trade from Connecticutpoet and Jetsbeer.  Presentation- 12oz bottle, 2004-05 release. Poured into a random pint glass.  Appearance- Super black pour, chocolate colored dirty brown 1/2 inch head and nice lacing. Pours out like goop.  Smell- Ranks right up there with any double or imperial stout I have had. Huge super dark chocolate and roasted malt nose.  Taste- Damn, this shit is good. Mega roasted malt, nuts and any other malted flavor you can think of. Smooth and I mean smooth dark chocolate flavor. Maybe a touch of coffee as well.  Mouthfeel- Oh so close from being perfect. Just a touch too much carbonation to be as smooth as it could possibly be. Super creamy and goes down with the greatest of ease. Do they have this on cask??  Drinkability- So glad I still have one of these left. Think I will toss it in the cellar and forget about it for a year or two. Can't imagine it getting much better than it already is, but what if it does?",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,jmc44,4.53,"Winter 2004-2005 Brew Pours a very dark black. Dark tan head, which dissipates quite quickly for a stout; that was the major disappointment.  Aroma is light; noticable is scent of chocholate and a bit of nuts.  Very strong chocolate taste to start. Aftertaste of roasted nuts.  Full-bodied.  Overall, an excellent beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Naes,3.18,"Appearance is black with a large brown head.  Aroma is malty sweet and chocolaty.  Taste is of alcohol and chocolate malt. Its much stronger in flavor than the aroma implies.  Mouth feel is medium bodied and a bit syrupy.  This beer is one for sipping, it's alright but nothing spectacular.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,blitheringidiot,4.35,"2004-2005: Onyx opaque hues as dark as Darth Vader's cloak, topped off with a spumescent khaki desert sand head that is clinging to the tulip, leaving sticky lace painted to the glass.  Initially scents of toffee and toasted malts. Boozy when warmed.  First swigs: Cocoa and dry Bisquick flavors. Esters of awl-kee-hawl and lightly floral. Some baker's chocolate. Dry ephemeral aftertaste. Some lingering boozy notes.  Full bodied, you bet, with lip smackin' stickiness.  Last swigs: Not as chocolately as last years version, but still keeping the rating digits. More of a cocoa stout.  2003-2004: A BROOKLYN Winter 2003 offering as per the label notes, this chocolate stout escaped from a 12 oz. browner to a pitch tar black pour with tan halo lace and scant head, probably due to the respectable ABV.  Cherries and mocha almond scents meet plenty of prescent awl-kee-hawl scents.  Dark stouts-aplenty roasts, esters that become more pronounced with increasing warmth. A bitterness that equates to a slight vegetable Earthiness a la buiscuit and red bell pepper.  Oily, buttery, solid & bisk body. A good drinkability factor due to the eccentric complexity of BROOKLYN'S Stout.  Last swigs: Good chocolate stout. Period.  Beer is good. Happy dark, chocolatey, stouty beering.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,granger10,4.67,"Quite an experience with my first Brooklyn Brewery beer. Pours intensely dark (motor oil darkness) with a large dark tan head that holds longer than I thought it would. Aroma is of dark chocolate, roasted grains, and a little fruit like whole strawberries. Taste has a really strong deep dark Belgian chocolate flavor. Quite nice. Espresso looms large and so does a roasted nut flavor. Sharp acidic twang toward the finish. Body is lucious and thick. Almost Expedition levels. Alcohol is well hidden but I'm still surprised it doesn't reach the double digits with the warming sensations and thickness of this beer. With about 4 ounces left I brought out the Ben and Jerry's Vanilla Ice Cream and these two matched beautifully. Really a great accompaniment to dessert. Great beer all around.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Ricochet,4.77,"When I pour a beer, and I smell a wine like smell, it's going to be something special. Few beers I've tried have smelled that way, and when they do, man, they rate high.  This poured perfectly black with a slight head that left a bit around the glass. It's black. No light came through. Outstanding. Smelling this was wonderful, with winey notes, dark malt, and chocolate. Damn. Then, for mouthfeel, I had a hard time rating this beer because I kept swallowing. All I can say is, wow. It will make you drink rather than swish.  Taste: What can I say. I'm wowed by this. There are so many different flavors, perfectly balanced, this is outstanding. Dark roasted malt, deep chocolate flavor and winey alcoholic notes.  The bonus, the first stout I'll give a 5 for drinkability. This would be a beer I could enjoy with food, with good friends, over a good video , anything. Highly reccommended when it's available. It doesn't suffer from the ""bottled stout"" syndrome. The flavors are fresh tasting as any. I want to sample other Brooklyn beers now. Bravo.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,watermelonman,4.4,"This poured to a nice, thick black with a small head that shrank to a ring and stayed that way. There's only a few dots of lace.  The smell is very good, with chocolate highlighting the dark malt base. The taste is chocolate up front, then malt takes over, while chocolate and hops take over the finish. The mouthfeel is strong and appealing while the drinkability is good for the strong content.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,malty,4.15,"Winter '04-'05 vintage.  Poured black with a khaki head that descended to 1/8"".  Scent of sweet black licorice, vanilla & molasses. And, oh yes, chocolate. Alcohol is apparent also.  Flavors are sweet and robust. Bitter dark chocolate with soft coffee notes. Pointed notes of charred toffee bathed in powdered sugar. Very liqueur-like.  Mouthfeel is very soft with perfect fine carbonation. Medium bodied, which made this a fine partner to a warm summer night. Nice dry finish to counterweigh its inherent sweetness.  Drinkability is very good. Not a stout to knock you off your feet. Very refined and articulate.  Overall a great version of a style that sometimes tends to be a bit heavy-handed. I drank this at cellar temp. which seemed to me very fitting for this ale. Would gladly incorporate this into my winter repretoire. Great stout from a great brewery.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,lackenhauser,4.59,"Pours a deep black color-Theres no way any light is getting thru this sucker. Small head and a slight trace of lacing. Low aroma-slight licorice and roasted malt comes thu for the most part. Big roasted malt flavor. Nice grainy and burnt flavor. Hints of anise,licorice and treacle. Very slight trace of sweetness. Nice body-very full and quite bold. A freakin killer beer. One of the best going. Whether its your first or last of the day-impressive all over!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,kwakwhore,4.5,"Pours like some kind of motor oil. Really dark and viscous. Thick mouthfeel, definitely a plus. Dark chocolate and espresso notes combine to make a really tasty beer. An extremely drinkable beer for the amount of alcohol, but 8.5% probably makes this a nightcap kind of a beer for me. Gave a couple of these away but the rest of the six pack isn't going to last very long.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Pegasus,4.12,"Release 2003  2004  Appearance: Deep mahogony in color, no light passes through, with a medium dark tan head, which retains well, and excellent, thick creamy lacing.  Aroma: Profound, rich aroma of coffee and bittersweet dark chocolate, lesser notes of dark fruit, very pleasing and potent.  Taste: Rich and deep bitter chocolate taste from start to finish, this lingers on and on and on, very pleasntly, though. Late in the taste, there is a warming alcohol note.  Mouth feel: Smooth, rich, syrupy, and very full, little carbonation noted.  Drinkability/notes: A superb beer, probably best enjoyed in cold weather, although there is precious little of that or beers like this in Central Texas.  Thanks to HardTarget for this most excellent treat.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,horndecker,4.57,"This was brewed in the winter of 03-04.  Blackest night, inky, with the occasional purple tinge around the edges. It has a coffee-brown, fine foamy head which is short and short-lived, but the carbonation is there, ready for action with each sip.  The smell is all bittersweet chocolate, burnt malt, a hint of prunes or raisins. Pretty fabulous.  The taste doesn't disappoint. Ruthlessly chocolatey, with a bit of coffee-ish bitterness, warming alcohol, silky smooth and creamy like a milkshake. Each sip fills your mouth with a fine foam that roils up and dances around your tongue. The aftertaste is cocoa powder and rum cake.  Had this with vanilla ice cream. Yes yes.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JackTheRipper,3.84,"Winter 03/04 A: Black, really black, laughing at light black. Head was initially 3/4"", dark tan color. Not so good now, seemed to fade away too quickly. S: Dark malts, rich chocolate aroma, some coffee smells but not much. This smells like they used more hops than the other stouts I've been drinking the last two days. T: Bitter dark chocolate taste. Again, more aggressive hops than I expected (yum). Burnt coffee taste. If there's malts here to be tasted, they are escaping me. Aftertaste lingers and lingers. M: Full bodied without being too heavy. Strong alcohol feel. Real strong. D&N: No doubt about it, this is a big beer. A bit stronger (alcohol wise) than I'd expect, so no drinking a few of these, one is quite enough, but I'm really enjoying it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Litterbean,4.38,"Holy crap, this beer is black. The tan head is towering and the lace is thick and persistent.  Roasted malt aroma, coupled with hints of coffee and a heaping load of chocolate. Very faint hop smell at the end.  Warming sweet malts, with a slightly bitter coffee flavor and a lot of chocolate again. Cappucino and earthy flavors permeate. A bit chewy at the end.  Smooth as hell. Thick and creamy, this one eats other stouts. Very drinkable even at the high alcohol, it's hidden so well. Delicious to say the very least.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,maybrick,4.48,"This was sampled from the 1999 - 2000 12 ounce bottle. Wow, what can you say save for ""damn this is the real deal."" This is one of my favorite beer styles. It pours balc, black, balck, so black in fact there was no light being able to penetrate the liquid.  The aroma was of chocolate, malts, and just a touch of smoke and hop.  The taste is incredible. It is very powerful and I assume as this was cellared well for five years it has blended and mellowed. This is a wonderful beer and if you can find it - buy it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,FirstMan,4.62,"Black as night, this one. The head sticks around for a while and has a muddy light brown color. Eventually it unevenly diminishes into little mud-pot bubble-rings across an even layer that just covers the top of the liquid. Lots of heavy lacing on the sides of the glass.  The smell is strongly roasted, toasted grains, chocolate, coffee, molasses, and (my wife thinks) a little hint of soy sauce. Very rich and complex.  Right at the beginning a quick hit of alcohol esters immediately precedes a complex mix of chocolate, roasted malt, molasses, and smoke. Very rich and complicated. Slowly the variety of flavors wanes into a lingering smoky hop bitterness.  Big, chewy mouthfeel. Smooth tempered by tinge of carbonation. Smooth, but not nearly as much as your typical English Stout.  Overall an amazing stout. Highly complex and truly world-class.  My only sidenote would be that this is a one-pint beer for me. It's so good you want to drink it slowly and savor it. I'll stick to other beers for multiples.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,tgbljb,4.12,"presented as 12 oz bottle, limited bottling winter 04-05. poured a black color with tannish head. The smell is roasty with distinct chocolate overtones.

A truly enjoyable beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Buildscharacter,4.4,"I am a super big fan of this super dark beer. It pours out like liquid night. It has a good character to it, and the aroma...wow. I love opening one of these bottles and just smelling the sweet air inside. Wonderful.  As I said, it's quite quite dark, and stains anything it touches!! Be careful! Anyway, the head is a very dark brown color and dissipates quickly.  The smell is just wonderful, there's a reason they call it Black Chocolate. You can just smell the aroma of chocolate and malt in this great beer.  I'm not as thrilled with the 2003-2004 batch, but I am more more obliged to recomend the 2004-2005. I can't wait to let this baby age some. The 04-05 has a great smooth flavor and leaves a wonderful chocolate aftertaste. I have found that even people that aren't big beer drinkers love this beer. There is a definate coffee flavor burried under all that chocolate.  I find that warming this beer to room temp allows for the full bouqet of flavor and smells to be pulled from it. Great sipping beer. Wouldn't suggest having more than two of them, just for the fact that they're pretty strong.  One of my favorites.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,thesilverhand,4.48,"This is the '04-'05 version. Gorgeous! Thick and black as crude oil, with a beautiful brown head that dissipated, but left decent lace on the glass. The aroma is thick with soy sauce, burnt sugars and bitter chocolate...complex and inviting. There is a slight alcohol presence. The flavour is as dark as the beer itself...darkly roasted coffees, chocolate, burnt sugars and charcoal. There is also a nice touch of hop bitterness. The alcohol makes itself known here, too, but again, it keeps a low profile and doesn't detract from the overall flavour. This is an amazingly viscous brew, sticking thickly throughout my mouth, but has just enough carbonation to keep it from feeling too heavy. As I make my way through the glass, the alcohol feels more prevalent, leaving me with a bit of a boozy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a phenomenal beer, and I'd recommend it without reservation. Perhaps not more than one, however. Just getting through one has left me sated...it's like a good meal.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,warriorsoul,4.2,"Was really in the mood for a piece of chocolate, but I figured this may appease my craving...make that cravings...I also wanted a beer. Winter 04-05 offering... Pours a dark brown, bordering on black w/ a full finger and a half of heavy, cocoa-colored head...lacing is real thick, sticks to the side of my tulip and goes nowhere. I am mostly smelling a very rich, dark chocolate with just a slightly sweet aroma...most likely due to the lacing under my nose. The taste is fantastic! Nothing overpowering...just a well balance double stout. Sweet cocoa and carmelized malt w/ hint of coffee and touch of hops. Mouthfeel is pretty darn thick, reminding me of World Wide w/out the burn (a good burn mind you). Carbonation is nice, not flat and not overly dry in its finish. The alcohol is well hidden in this one. Drinkability is decent for its style...I could put back a couple of these w/ little effort. Only my second brew from Brooklyn...glad to see my selection getting better.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,brentk56,4.37,"Release 04-05  Appearance: Pours a dark, muddy black color with a small mocha head that leaves some splashes of lacing  Smell: Bitter chocolate and coffee notes dominate, along with prunes and a hint of alcohol; slightly smokey  Taste: Very complex. Starts out with the roasted malt flavors, lots of chocolate and coffee then, the prunes; after a few seconds the first wave of bitterness takes over; then you get a burst of alcoholic warmth which stays with you as the chocolate, sweeter this time, returns in the finish  Mouthfeel: Thick and viscous with a modest amount of carbonation  Drinkability: This is so rich and alcohol-laden that it is hard to drink the whole bottle. Forget about a second.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,arguemaniac,4.8,"Note: Having had this amazingly complex brew before, I decided to forgo using my usual pint glass and instead opted for a snifter in order to review this one.  Appearance: Utter and absolute darkness, this brew is entirely opaque (even held up against a light the color does not change). Also, a thick, creamy brown head (with some minor ruby hues) that sustains for quite a while. The viscous oiliness of this beer is also very impressive (it has that somwhat rare coats the glass quality).  Aroma: A number of aromas emanate from this brew: chocolate, roasted coffee, burnt fruit, alcohol hints, and even hop bitterness. Nicely earthy and complex.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Two basic, overall flavors dominate this brew: bitterness and roastiness (or, more accurately, a burnt flavor). The former comes from an array of the beers flavors such as bitter cocoa, hop flavor, alcohol bite, etc., while the latter stems from roasted coffee, burnt fruitiness, espresso, etc. All of these varying tastes complement to create a very rich and very complex brew. Also, the sweetness has a port-like character. In addition to all this, the finish is long and robust. The mouthfeel is exceptionally thick and oily, with a nice carbonation tang as well.  A number of words could be used to describe this truly outstanding beer  rich, robust, delicious, complex, earthy, etc., - but I think one simple word does it best: amazing. Easily my favorite stout, but also one of the best out of all the beers Ive ever tasted, regardless of style. The one very minor drawback, IMHO, is that its richness makes it somewhat difficult to finish off more than one or two of these at a time (I been drinking the same glass of this stout for almost a half-hour and Im still not done!), not to mention its alcohol kick (an 8.5% hammer). But, overall, no serious craft beer drinker can afford to not try this one. Highly, highly recommended!!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,kaszeta,4.62,"Finally procured a 12 oz bottle (still looking for tap, they haven't had this one at recent festivals I've been to).  Pours with a deep black body and a nice light tan head that lingers. Smell is mostly hoppy, with some sweet malty notes and just a hint of cocoa (like opening a tin of cocoa powder).  Taste is mostly that of a darker stout, with some nice, creamy sweetness, a bit of bitterness, and just a hint of cocoa and chocolate creeping in around the edges. The chocolate taste is done quite well here, applied sparingly and not with a sledgehammer. Taste lingers, with more of a hops flavor than anything chocolate. Good, substantial mouthfeel. Delicious and drinkable  Quite good, and that's coming from a guy that doesn't usually like specialty beers.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Schwarzbart,4.47,"Appearance: Black with tiny tiny little carbonation bubbles that run up the side of the glass. Small head that dissipates to a nice frothy/creamy, tanish brown covering with great lacing. Smell: Just great. Lots of chocolate malts with hints of coffee and I can smell the alcohol just a tad. Taste: Bitter and sweet. Taste like espresso beans with unsweetened chocolate liquor. A roasted flavor is present that I just can't quite figure out, but it is good. Mouthfeel: Creamy Drinkability: I will definately be drinking this one again, especially considering I have 3/4 case in the basement.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ski271,4.77,"Appearance: Black! I mean not a speck of light showing through. Head is small, brown, creamy and most-diminishing by the time you get a couple sips in. Good lacing coating the glass all the way down.  Smell: Sweet & malty. A wonderful chocolate aroma that is so rich and deep, accompanied by a light smell of freshly roasted dark coffee beans and an earthy, oak-like aroma. I cant really describe it well, but it has a smell that is just so inviting and comforting.  Taste: Wow! Now thats a fine imperial stout (but its classified as an American Double Stout?). Lightly hopped over a beefy, solid, roasted malt backbone. Flavors of dark chocolate and coffee are rather pronounced, along with smoke, molasses and a slight fruitiness like black cherries. The finish is medium-long in duration and lightly bitter with a hint of vanilla (or is that just my imagination?). Theres a slight warming sensation from the alcohol, but otherwise it is hidden very well.  Mouthfeel: Creamy texture, medium-full body (lightly syrupy but not as heavy as I expected), soft carbonation, and a crispness that comes from that very nice finish.  Drinkability: I tried to slowly enjoy this bottle but ended up plowing through the glass in a matter of minutes. One of the best beers Ive been introduced to this year! I highly recommend seeking out a bottle of this. It is truly remarkable.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,redmosquito,4.2,"Opaque black, with red highlights, and a reddish brown head that quickly dissappeared. The aroma is full of roasted, coffee, nutty oak, caramel, hintsof chocolate and an almost sherry like aroma as it warms. The taste is smooth roasted malt with solid bitterness and a lingering chocolate finish. This beer isn't dry, but rather it's sweet and warming. An obviously well made beer, surprisingly on the light side of the style, but so well balanced that it will shine over it's alcohol laen peers.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BadBadger,4.4,"This beer pours nice and dark. A thick tan foamy head forms and lasts for a relatively long time. The smell is firstly of wonderful chocolate roasted malts. But then slight hints of alcohol start to come through the malt and chocolate aroma. The taste follows a similar pattern: thick, chocolate and malty, very slight tinge of alcohol. This is definitely far better than average, and certainly worth trying. This should be searched out and savored. This is a fine beer which continues to grow on my palate. Enjoy.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,dmbfrat420beers,3.94,"Presentation - 12 oz bottle with ""Limited Bottling - Winter '04-'05"" label on it. I am drinking it in the March of '05.  Appearence - Poars very dark. Small, but tight, tawny head that dissipates fairly fast but leaves a nice lace on the glass.  Smell - light fusel alcohol aroma. faintly fruity odor that reminds me of currants or perhaps a brandy/port type beverage.  Taste - up front, is much like dark chocolate in its bitterness and slight fruity tartness, reminding me of rasberry, though I doubt they actually used rasberry in this brew. also some spicy alcohol notes. interesting in that it remains quite tart in the mouth but some hoppy bitterness clings to the lips. changes character quite a bit towards the end, revealing a lot of roasted malts and sweet notes. overall, quite complex and a nice warming feeling down the throat. nonetheless, this is not the best I have had, though that may owe to personal taste rather than anything inherent in the quality of the beer.  Mouthfeel - fairly mild carbonation. otherwise, nothing particularly special, although it certainly feels lighter bodied than its appearance would have suggested.  Drinkability - the tartness and the alcohol in this beer really catch up to you fast. Had this previously as part of a drinking ""session"" and did not appreciate it as much...nor did my stomach. i suggest it be drank in the same 'limited' way that it is bottled.  Final Notes - There is no reason not to try this beer and I very much enjoyed it. However, other imperial stouts are better, however, in particular I would recommend Weyerbacher's Heresy.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ommegangpbr,4.15,"12 ounce bottle from the winter of '04-'05 batch poured into a chalice. I think this started out too cold 'cause the beverage distributor I got it from had it in the fridge. At first I didn't think it any different from Guinness, which is pretty good in my book. As it warmed its characteristics really started to break through. People that do not like dark, somewhat bitter chocolate are NOT going to like this brew. People that dont like strong, black coffee are NOT going to like this brew. Both of these scents and flavors are prevalent in Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. Bittersweet. The mouthfeel could stand to feel a little bit thicker but it has a decent viscous quality as it stands. Beautiful black color, a mild head, sweet but not cloying. This is really 8.5%? After having one I believed it but I certainly couldn't detect it by taste. It's good to see a fellow nyc borough producing something of this quality. Cheers.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,Phyl21ca,4,Bottle: Poured a pitch-black stout with dark brown foamy head with medium retention. Aroma is comprised of chocolate with strong malt and some subtle coffee in the back. Taste is very enjoyable with some chocolate being easily noticeable with again strong malt and a coffee and bitter ending.

45,680,mobyfann,4.47,"Paid $8.99 for a mixed 6'er...  Limited 03/04 edition  This beer pours the blackest stout I have ever seen, with a medium-large dark brown head, exceptional retention and a few marks of lacing at the end. The aroma gives away some nice stout characteristics... starting with it's core of chocolate, and seconary characteristics of roasted malts and a dark-roasted coffee, one of the darkest!  The taste is very impressive, not only does it continue with the above aroma characteristics, it also has a hint of creme and vanilla embeded in the taste, very powerful and unique! The mouthfeel is also in its own class, the creamy taste characteristc seems to flow this beer straight through your mouth, leaving a smooth delivery. As this beer settles it's a very drinakble beer, I might have another since this beer attributes a lot, also the 8.5%abv is nowhere to be found, even right after the pour as some beers give off.  Final Thought: As you let this beer settle you notice a remarkable taste change... it's up there for stouts, period!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,stjarnflikka,4.68,"Vintage 04/05  Pours a totally (read: totally) black beer with an impressively high chocolate coloured foam on top that stays unbelievingly long.  Nose hits with choclate, dark malts and a lot of roasted tones which brings forth a lot of coffee and alcohol. Nice, smooth smell thats temptingly chocolatey. A touch of wine in there as well.  First sip brings a ton of dark, dark chocolate with a nice dark bitterness and soothing alcoholic presence. Burned and sour flavours comes in strong with dark chocolate. Anyone that has eaten chocolate over like 70% will know how this tastes. Some carbonation lifts this heavy lid to create a velvet like sweet chocolatey and wonderfull flavour that ends bitter, warming and somewhat dry.  This was mighty, heavy and long lasting. Took me over an hour to finish one bottle and i could match this up with any chocolate dessert anytime. 4 bottles will be laid down until next year, just wait and see ;)",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,gotbeer,4.42,"This is a great stout. The appearance is black as night, and it smells of coffee and toffee. The taste also hints of dark roast coffee, as well as dark chocolate. The feel on the mouth is smooth. Really interesting, complex malt flavors. I found out after tasting that it is 8.5 ABV, and this also surprised me. The alcohol doesn't overpower the great flavors, and it could even be a good session brew. I very much enjoy this beer. A very good interpretation of a stout with chocolate malts- Very good, and worth a try!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,soulfly967,4.7,"2004-2005 edition.  Poured a deep, dark, evil black with a nice dark tan head that stuck around for a bit, leaving some lacing. The smell was dominated by coffe and chocolate notes. The taste was amazing, slightly sweet at first, then bittersweet chocolate, roasted malts and coffee slowly fade into a hint of hops. The mouthfeel is excellent, creamy, thick and begging me to drink more! The drinkablility of this beer was great, I could so easily put down a few of these. Overall, this is one excellent beer and I cannot wait until I can get my hands on another case of this!  Note: I drank this one after seeing Soulfly and Morbid Angel in Cleveland, so that made it THAT much better!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,nvsblman,4.28,"Pours pitch black with a thick coffee colored head. Loads of coffee and chocolate in the aroma, along with some alcohol. Tastes of roasted espresso and dark chocolate with some alcohol warmth in the background. There is a slightly hoppy aftertaste before the hops are overwhelmed by the coffee flavors. Thick and syrupy, this is a very nice beer! The only knock against it's drinkability is that it would be pretty hard to drink more than a couple in one night!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ChowHound,3.03,"I love an imperial stout, and this one at first glance and whiff appeared to be a winner. Very dark with a creamy looking tannish head. Aroma of soft chocolates, dried beef, and roasted nuts had my mouth watering. Carbonation was too low in my estimation, and the flavor, while rich with chocolate malts, was too sweet and the texture too thin for an imperial stout. Also, a very strong taste of alcohol was always present, not something I like in a beer. Nasty aftertaste as well. For all its reputation, this brewery should be putting out better beers.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Who would have thought... Lots of chocolate. Definate coffee notes as well. Some roasty smells, but pretty well masked by the chocolate.  Taste: Creamy, malty almost syrupy. Very smooth. More roasted malt taste than was in the nose. The alcohol is definately there.  Mouthfeel: Smooth with lots of body. Minimal carbonation. Very thick.  Overall: Very good. I am not a big chocolate stout drinker, but this was pretty tasty. Pretty drinkable. Definately recommended.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,mynie,4.36,"I told myself I was going to let this one age--I really did. But I gave in, as usual.  This is probably the blackest beer I've ever seen. Deep, opaque, inescapable black.  Saucy smell. Very strong. Lots of malt and coffee and a hint of chocolate.  Incredibly powerful flavor. Deceptively simple upfront, rather MOR Imperial Stout flavor of strong alcohol malt and coffee, followed up quickly by a tremendously complex blend of coffee and roasted malt, making way to a deep, rich chocolate that warms you up and is dances all the way down into your stomach. Wonderful.  This is a surprisingly drinkable beer, and a beer that I'm sure would age well...if only you could keep yourself from drinking it. Try it warm.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TackleDummy,4.49,"The beer looks like used motor oil and leaves a very thin dark tan head. The stout tastes sweet and chocolatey, and the roasted malts blend well with the alcohol. The beer is pretty thick and doesn't have a whole lot of carbonation, which is a good thing. It doesn't feel heavy on the way down, but after you finish the bottle you might get the feeling you should take a break before the second one.  If you can get your hands on some of this, give it a try. Black Chocolate Stout is just plain good.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,carln26,4.37,"Very deep black color with a thin tan head. The snifter glass I poured the beer into usually encourages foam development, so I was surprised by the how thin this was. The nose has deep chocolate and roast malt character with a hint of hard candy, and some alcohol hints on the finish. A light ring of lace develops as the head settles into the beer. Great chocolate richness up front in the flavor with more of an alcohol warming than I sense in other chocolate stouts. The hop lends an almost minty character to the flavor, amazing. Nice, velvety mouth feel and a good drinakbility. This may be the signature version of this style. Great job Garrett.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,whartontallboy,3.83,"Lookin' good, boys. Nice black pour with a thick tan head that hangs around for a few minutes. Burnt malt, chocolate, coffee beans, and some fruity sweetness are all in the aroma. The taste has a lot of dark chocolate, but there's also lots of coffee flavors and burnt malt in there as well. Thick chewy mouthfeel complements the big flavor nicely. Drinkability is not so great. The beer is tasty, don't get me wrong, but I had a hard time finishing the whole bottle. I'd almost like to get this one in a 7 oz. nip so the sweetness wouldn't knock me around quite so much.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Dakotablue,4.95,"Wow! I have had Brooklyn's offerings for the past 4 years available down here in Chapel Hill, but I had to sneak this one over the state border because of our 6% cap.  (2004-2005 offering) One of the strongest initial hits of aroma that I have ever encountered with any beer - heavy chocolate and burnt malt smell. Enough to make my mouth salivate. It is a very dark black color, no chance of seeing through this one. The head retention is about a 1/2 inch for a minute or two before slowly dissolving (dark brown head). The taste is a heavy espresso chocolate taste with undertones of noticable hops. The alcohol is well hidden for the first few seconds, but then rears its head on your palate. Leaves a bit of a dry mouthfeel, due what I believe largely the carbonation and the amount of tannins in the beer. Would LOVE to see this as a NITRO. I could drink this all night - definitely a top ten to 20 beer. Cheers to Brooklyn Brewery.  Now if I could actually get this at the store down here instead of making a 6 hour round trip to Virginia. You would think that NC would be a bit more lenient...",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Jacobier10,3.78,"What a fancy looking bottle.  Pours out black with a dark tan head. One of the darkest colored heads I've ever seen. Looked like motor oil as it made the journey from the bottle to my glass. Burnt malts coupled with some moderate hops made up the aroma. Nice taste. Molasses, chocolate, and coffee are all present here. The alcohol presence could not go unnoticed though. And, honestly, it made it a little tough to drink. I enjoyed this beer, but I wouldn't be able to drink too many. Probably would be ideal for cellaring.  ***Update*** (2/10/06) - I brought down the Smell and Mouthfeel each by 0.5. I just tried it again and it really just leaves a very bitter finish. A little tough to drink, but it still tastes pretty darn good.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Couldn't be farther from the truth. Very smooth mouthfeel and an unbelievable chocolate flavor that all but hides the alcohol. Very drinkable for such a seemingly heavy beer. Slightly bitter with a pleasant complex after taste. Definitely in my top ten!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,santoslhalper,3.72,"2004-2005 edition.  Appearence: Pours a normal black with decently rich fomay head.  Smell: The roasted malt smell is wonderful to sniff. The bottle claims this beer uses 6 different malts, and I believe it.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The taste of this beer is a kind of mediocre chocolate flavor, but with other ingrediants that compliment that. The chocolate taste isn't too good, but the malty sweet goodness is excellent. The focus of this beer should not have been the chocolate, but it still tastes good. The mouthfeel is full and creamy.  Drinkability and Overall: Not a bad beer, but can't hold a candle to Rogue Chocolate Stout. I enjoyed it, that's for sure, but probably couldn't enjoy another one. This is a beer you have to be in the mood for.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JackStraw22,4.79,"This is the 2004-05 edition. Pours a typically black body, with a nice dark, caramel head, reasonable retention. There's a wonderful sweet aroma, tons of chocolate. Also some fruitiness. The taste is awesome. For as sweet as this is, it isn't overbearing, and the high alcohol doesn't make an appearance in the mouth, what a delight. The mocha taste in this is really good, and just a hint of bitterness to give some balance. I could drink these all night.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,SaunaKing,4.03,A pitch black stout with a wonderful coffee colour head. Smells of rich quality chocolate. Taste of course is choclate too. But a little bit too much alcohol burn in it. Its pretty easy drinking but you can really tell you get a little extra in this beer. The alcohol is a little too close to the surface. I prefer it felt but not tasted. This is however a pretty good stout with a rich chocolate taste and only the aftertaste brings it down a little in my opinion.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Erix,4.82,"From bottle poured in pint glass. Appearance: Well, its hard for an Imperial Stout (or American Double Stout?) to look much better than this. Absolutely black, with a dark, slowly developing head. Looks nice and thick. Smell: Wonderfully dark, sweet chocolate. Hew did they ever get this much chocolate scent in here without using chocolate? Truly fantastic. Taste: Bitter burnt chocolatey goodness all around! Wow, this is delicious. I've worked my way through about half the case despite my best attempts to pace myself, and it grows on me more with each bottle. Sweeter than you expect, the hops really play around with the roastiness to accentuate, rather than overwhelm, this malty backbone. Finishes with a soft, thick, coating malt sweetness. Well hidden alcohol. Mouthfeel: Smooth and almost creamy, the bitterness doesnt pucker your mouth and shrivel your tongue like I often anticipate in a beer this color and strength. Great stuff. Drinkability: Very easy to down this beer. A beverage this great and a budget as small as mine make it a must to never have more than one bottle chilled at any time.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,maccroz,3.83,"I was amazed to find out that this is an 8.5% ABV beer. It hardly tastes of alcohol at all.  This beer pours like motor oil. It appears to have the same color and viscosity of used engine oil with a dark tan frothy head to top it off.  The first taste was a bit surprising. It's not bitter like most beers its color, instead it tastes of a chocolate syrup with a chalky texture. It's quite sweet, and has a complex lingering aftertaste.  Six of these beers will be more than enough for any advocate as they are more of a dessert beer than a drinkin' brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ram3139,4.43,"Appearance: Dark and forboding. Opaque black with a dark tan head. Head was thin and didnt last too long.  Smell: Not too strong, roasted coffee/chocolate with a very slight whiff of alcohol.  Taste: Excellent. Starts out with a blast of coffee, chocolate and a bunch of others i cant put my finger on. Nothing really dominates until the end, when the chocolate lingers on the palate indefinetly. Drink a few, and you can almost taste it for the rest of the night. A little bit of alcohol warming at the end, but not much.  Mouthfeel: Very good. Not watery by any means, but with medium carbonation it doesnt have a real 'heavy'.  Drinkability: As I said, not a real heavy beer, but it did fill me up. A few is no problem, but I don't think it would be a great sesssion beer, at least not for me. But with ~9%abv, you wouldn't want to down it like guinness anyway.

45,680,connecticutpoet,4.47,"Winter 2004-2005 bottling.  This was a VERY deep brown, almost opaque beer with a one finger tan head. It looked promising.  The aroma was of rich dark roasted malt, with hints of cocoa. Quite interesting, something I have never noticed before, even with Sam Adams Chocolate Bock.  The taste was of smooth roasted malt and bitter chocolate, with a coffee aftertaste. Some alcohol was noticeable, but it didn't taste like an 8.5 % ABV brew.  This was really an excellent stout, and if you can find it, do yourself a favor and get some.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,necoadam,4.28,"Poured out a blacker than black color with a nice tan head that went to lacing eventually. I thought the beer was going to swallow the light in the room with it being so dark.  Smell was nice. Roasted malts with a nice underlying aroma of coffee and dark ripe fruit. A tad of hops hiding at times to give it a balancing effect.  Taste was nice. Roasted malts along with some roasted coffee beans strike the palate first. Hops are present and welcoming actually. Towards the end the chocolate kicks in and really balances this beer very well.  Mouthfeel was full bodied and carbonation was low to medium. Flavors really came through.  I'm sorry I didn't grab a six pack of this stuff last year. I saw it but decided not to get it. Dumb move. I'll grab a 6 of this every winter. Great, great stuff.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,sulldaddy,4.46,"04-05 bottling. I am drinking in a flute glass at room temp. The beer pours a pitch black into my glass with an immense tan creamy silky head foaming up 2.5 inches. Leaving some tight latticework as it fades to a robust surface layer. Aroma is chocolate, raisins, white grape, some espresso and a hint of roasted malt as well. First sip, introduces a sublimely smooth and creamy concoction onto my palate. Such a rich brew and so easy to imbibe! Very mild rolling carbonation almost gives the impression of a cask ale. Flavor starts mild with some roasted malt and chocolate, this rolls to some sweeter chocolate and finishes with a bit of espresso bitter mixing with the sweet chocolate, I guess similar to a mocha. Very nice mix and definitely a malt lovers paradise! This brew is rather large and I find it incredibly easy to drink. This year's batch isnt as bitter as others, and I rather enjoy it.

45,680,hustlemuscle,4.38,"The neck label says Winter 2004-2005, and ""Brooklyn Brewery, Utica, NY.""  Pours solid black, with a finger's width of cocoa colored, dense looking head. As I wait for my second to warm, the head has receeded to a thing covering- but left a nearly opaque lace as it went down. Very pleasing, it brings with it a fine sense of anticipation, and does not disappoint.  Except for the nose. A bit acrid, it smells as it the roasted malts were a bit burnt, and a touch too much of alchohol. Sugery and fruity alchohol. At least that is what I thought of a cooler version. It mellows nicely as it warms, and gets an extra half point.  Very smooth chocolate toasted coffee malts, molded into a very smooth and complete package. A nice fruity touch, plums? comes out as it goes down.  I wrote in my notes 'very smooth, with a tiny touch of alchohol tang at the end' but with another in front of me, a bit warmer, the tiny touch becomes almost nothing.  Very smooth, silky, velvety, whatever metaphore you want to use for it. Goes down very nicely, wich makes it a great sipper. Certainly a very, very nice beer.  That said, I just stuck one in the closet, to see how it tastes next year! Interesting also to see it's hourly evolution as it warms, as well.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smells strong with heavy roasted malts, hops, and chocolate at the end of the nose. Minimal carbonation. At first, you taste the roasted malts. Then, the bitterness comes over your tongue very strongly, first hops then the cocoa. Very genuine cocoa taste, but also quite bitter. Bitterness lasts with you after your swallow due to the thickness of the brew.

Purchased from Norm's Beer & Wine (near DC) in fall 2004 and consumed in December 2004. 12 oz bottle poured thick and with a half-finger brown head that quickly settled to a partial ring around the inside of the mug. Pitch black, couldn't see through this one at all. Smelled chocolate, some roast, licorice, and a faint grainy and alcohol-ish kind of 'barleywine sweet'. Thick mouthfeel. Coffee roast blended really well with a rich chocolate. A fine chocolate, not a dry or waxy cheap chocolate. Plum was noticable as was molasses (with some searching). Dry start, followed by the dry rough roast and finishing somewhere between sweet and dry. Boy, this was a nice stout. The flavor persisted just a short time, as the thick beer clung to my tongue, allowing me to reflect on this beer with a pleasant chocolatey flavor.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Hibernator,4.7,"Brooklyn Brewery Black Chocolate Stout Limited Bottling - Winter '04 - '05  This could be the most excited I've been about a beer in a while. Always a highly anticipated winter time classic for me, I was glad to pick up a six pack this evening.  When my friends and I were about 20 years old, we ordered a log of this from the Brooklyn Brewery. We served the beer with Hershey chocolates and strawberries. It was a great night and really opened my eyes to the wonders of the craft beer movement. We had friends who rarely stepped outside the Budweiser box and were drinking pints of this that night and loving it.  Little did I know then that my friends and I were ahead of our time as far as great beer goes.  As for this review...  I served the Brooklyn BCS in a tulip glass. This is one beer that will age well with time. Pours a very dark shade of black with an attractive tannish-brown head. Dirty brown sticky lacings cling all over the sides of the glass.  Strong whiffs of espresso, molasses and berries.  A creamy and full mouthfeel. Roasted coffee & imported chocolate flavors dominate the palate. Awesome smokey and roasted malts. Rasberry tartness interjects an espresso bitterness. There is a well represented hop bitterness with each sip, but the chocolate complexities take charge. A very slight alcohol warmth on the finish, but not as prominent as in years past.  What a beautifully well-balanced beer. One of the better imperial stouts I have ever had. Becomes more enjoyable as it warms up to room temperature.  A true gem and highly recommended.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Thick, wool blanket down of Silver Surfer head that receded and laced like a sputtering black hole. No moon blackest night hue, like the edge of the horizon on a winter night, in the dark, with eyes bolted shut. Chocolate and cocoa predominate on the mouth, with a Galactacus of sweet alcohol bite that shivers down to the metatarsals, practically splintering them. A bit further along, a prune and black licorice chutney gloms around and leaves a scorched earth policy down the tongue and into the throat; tonsils suffering from the plague. Almost a funky exoskeleton of malt that feels oddly wraith-like on the mouth. Generous, but lacking something.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,MuddyFeet,4.67,"Bought a six-pack of the '03-'04 batch over a year ago and put it in storage until this weekend. Such a good idea. The beer poured a midnight black with a thick, brown head that never went away. The lace clung to the glass extremely stubbornly the whole time while I was drinking it. As soon as I opened up the bottle aromas of chocolate and rich malts were wafting out. With the pour the aroma just got stronger. The hops are slightly bitter, but balanced with rich malts. Chocolate is (of course) ever so very present but coffee and molasses also come through on the tongue. I aged this a year, I can only imagine what it would've tasted in a cask. Do they have that? After two, I took notice that the alcohol is a lot higher than the flavor lets on. I limited myself to two, but because of how extremely rich this beer is I do not know if my palate cannot take a third without burning out.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Of course this beer is some poetic saying of holy shit it is black, but it does get a tanish head that falls back quickly. I have had several in one sitting but this beer is better enjoyed in small doses. Now to the taste of this large black stout.

That beautiful dark brown head that looks so amazing in certain stouts and porters, and plenty of it. Roasted malts in the nose. Strong roasted coffee flavor with chocolate. Enough hop bitterness to balance. Harsh flavors, a little like sipping through an ash tray, although that makes it sound bad when it's really not. Still, it could definitely benefit from some aging. Full mouthfeel. Nice warming from the alcohol, which feels like it is evaporating in your mouth.

Then I sent it via air freight to Moscow, where I finally consumated the courtship on 12/02/04. Label notes in several places that this is a limited bottling for winter '04-'05. Well, let me tell you that winter has more than started in Moscow, so I felt real good about popping this baby open.  Pours a deep dark brown under a 1/2 finger tan head that settles fairly quickly to film, leaving a touch of lace. Bit disappointed there. Not much in the nose at first, but as it warmed, chocolate and some mint (mint chocolate chip?) came through. Further warming yielded some nice roastiness later. The mouth is very prickly and fairly light - appropriate but not spectacular. Wonderful taste, though: chocolate is prominent, supplemented by caramel and a touch of roasted nuts and some plum. The finish features a strong flowery hop bitterness, enhanced by the chocolate but assertive on its own. The sweet and bitter walk hand in hand into the sunset of the aftertaste, leaving a very happy mouth. Very, very nice product.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

First sip is a upfront with a huge roasted, burnt malt flavor, in which lies notes of dark chocolate, ground coffee and molasses. Flavors explode on your tongue and don't hold back. Nice and thick with slight warming acohol notes.  Mouthfeel is velvety creamy with a wonderful body and good carbonation.

45,680,dippy,3.9,"2004-2005 bottle Upon pouring this beauty I fell in love with the head. It looked like frothy chocolate milk. Nice dark beer makes my mouth water.  Smells sweet an chocolaty, fitting, given it's name.  Tastes like a dark dark chocolate. Slightly espresso. A little sweet from all the malt.  Very warming.  I think I would limit myself to maybe three or four of these a night. Not a session beer. This is too be enjoyed infront of the fire. It is my new seasonal drink.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,asabreed,4.23,"Picked up a case last year for around $28. I have about 6 left after just cracking this one open. The case is also from the Winter '03 - '04 batch, so this sucker's a year old.  Appearance - Opaque and full bodied with a thick brownish-white head that sticks to the glass pretty well.  Smell - Complex malt and dark chocolate. Worth getting right in the glass and taking some deep breaths. I think they use 6 kinds of malt, and it definitely shows.  Taste - Like the smell, the taste is even more complex, and I applaud Brooklyn for this. Burnt Burnt Burnt is the key. And of course the unsweetened dark chocolate. Sometimes I want to say the malts aren't balanced enough, but with this one at cellar temperature I think the balance is much more evident. Definitely don't have this cold.  Mouthfeel - Sometimes it can seem a bit thin, but it coats the mouth pretty well nonetheless.  Drinkability - I swear the ABV got higher since I had it last year. I wonder if letting it sit a year does anything, but it's probably my imagination. But since it IS a year old, I feel that's why it's more complex in its taste; aging this beer is definitely the thing to do. Don't make this a session beer as it warrants aging and sipping. Goes well with desserts in addition to being enjoyed by itself.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,blitz134,4.2,"Poured black as can be with no light coming around the edges either. Very little tan head formed on top, just enough to be able to call it something.  Smell was slightly sweet malts and lacked much of the typical toasted aroma I was expecting from a stout. A good dose of caramel sweetness with vanilla overtones. Good kick of vinous dark fruits as well. Strong alcohol nose as well.  The taste is pretty good. The first flavor to be picked up was the toasted flavor which the aroma lacked which quickly turned into a slight bit of chocolate, very pleasant. Towards the end I could pick up the alcohol, but being a winter warmer brew this was expected. Although it does come across a little harsh. The taste hung around for just long enough, coating like a thin oil...very reminiscant of the pour leading to a good thick mouthfeel.  Drinkability for this brew is good. The only thing bringing it down a bit is the harsh alcohol taste.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Rastacouere,3.75,"Almost black in colour. Head is initially light brown, 1cm tall, nicely laced for an imperial stout. Strikingly malty from the start, proposing a rather complex roasty base on which builds up anise, chocolate and vegetal flavors. The roastiness at the end is a definition of stoutish balance though I didnt enjoy the raw vegetal green hop aspects, almost citrusy. Oily mouthfeel has a fairly moderate carbonation level and lets show a good trace of alcohol toward the ending. I was a bit underwhelmed by the chocolate tones to this, while they are to be found, I expected more focus. As it is, this is a well crafted imperial stout that seems a bit basic, yet a good foundation to shape better beers after.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bultrey,4.68,"Ohhhh baby. I've had this so many times before, but I finally decided to review it to give it just dues. This is a spectacular beer, and in my opinion, by far Mr. Oliver's greatest creation and the best stout I've ever had. Pours a dark, dark night with a thin tan head that recedes to just the tiniest ring around the edge of the beer. The smell is at once burnt and vinous, almost as if a fine, sweet, dark chocolate were slightly burned, as it tends to smell at the end of a fondue pot. The sweetness of this smacks you upside the head up front, with chcocolate-covered strawberries and other ripe red or dark fruits, but is quickly decimated by a wonderful charcoal bitterrness and the slightest hops character. But hops only serve to provide balance here...the story is the dark, roasted, chocolate malt. I also percieve a vanilla or molasses-type character. The thing I love about this stout is that it seems to combine all the finest characteristics of every style of stout: milk, sweet, dry, and imperial. The mouthfeel is exceptionally creamy and smooth, and the drinkability is dangerously high. The alcohol isn't apparent in the taste, but is apparent in the pleasant warmth that slowly engulfs your body. Must be served at cellar or room temperature. I will drink this all winter. I'd be curious to see if aging can make this any better. That would be an impressive feat.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,merlin48,4.23,"Limited Bottling, Winter 03-04. Pours a dense ebony with a tighlaced and ample cocoa head. Nose is of roasted malt and burnt coffee. Thick and creamy in the mouth, minimal carbonation. Taste is deep and rich, very stoutlike, a bit smoky but dominated by roasted and burnt malt. Lots of dark roasted coffee notes, but I'm missing the chocolate. Maybe some hints of bittersweet chocolate as it reaches room temperature, but I was expecting more from a ""Chocolate Stout"". This is a nice imperial stout, but given its rating I was expecting more. Update: Winter 04-05 version, thanks to clvand0. Same, strikingly beautiful, ebony appearance as the 03-04, but the aroma has plenty of the chocolate that I found missing in last year's vintage. The immense aroma has cocoa, coffee beans, vanilla, dark fruits, and a hint of the high alcohol, which has a rum note. Flavor follows suit, with dark chocolate notes in abundance, complimented by burnt roasted coffee and dark malts. Dark fruits of prunes and raisins add to the beautiful complexity. An excellent imperial stout. Scores adjusted accordingly.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,NEhophead,4.15,"12 oz brown bottle. Winter '04-'05.  1"" very creamy, coffee colored head with great retention. Condensed and thin lacing scattered throughout the glass. A deep and rich opaque black in color.  Chocolate syrup, vanilla, coffee, and hazlenut tones. A bit of an oat aroma, as well as the 8.5%abv coming through. Very chocolately and rich aromatics.  Dark chocolate and light hazlenut. A moderate, chewy maltiness accompanied by some mild dark fruit flavors: black cherry/plum. A moderate bite of hops giving somewhat of a dark tasting bitterness. A very pleasant coffee flavored aftertasteee. The alcohol flavor is very evident and takes away a bit from the stout's natural flavors.  Full bodied; smooth, semi-chewy mouthfeel. A very low amount of carbonation yet not syrupy.  Low in abv% for the style, yet the alcohol flavor is not hidden well. An old favorite of mine; definitely worth a try. IMO, probably Brooklyn's finest offering.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,SCW,4.42,"I think I've had most of Brookyn Brewery's offerings. Does this one stand out from the rest? Absolutely.  For me, this beer has the most ""craft"" taste to it of all their offerings. Granted, I think the pilsner and brooklyn lager are fine beers, but they don't quite have the ""micro"" taste to them. This one definitely does.  It was a real treat to pour this one, it was pretty fresh. Pour a deep, opaque black. Had about only 1 to 1.5 inches of head, which dissipated rather quickly. The aroma was mostly dominated by malty, chocolately, and nutty overtones. There was a faint whiff of hops.  The beer had slightly less carbonation than your average beer, but I think this works nicely with the fuller body and richer flavor. Overall, despite its strength, it's a very drinkable brew.  Does anyone know where I can find this baby on draft?",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Southernbrew,4.02,"Pours black as night with a small, khaki head. Lacing all the way down.  Hints of chocolate blend with coffee beans as well as dark fruits, alcohol and a faint sweetness.  Medium bodied, velvet smooth. Tons of flavors here. Rum and alcohol show up first moving into a dark fruit, probably plum flavor. Melds with a brown sugar sweetness and then finishes with a bitter-sweetness and alcohol flavor.  A fine double stout, quite complex. I would like to see the alcohol flavor toned down a little, but that's why God invented aging, right?",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ybnorml,4.15,"This beer pours black as ink. It's like a black hole ""no light escapes when held up to the light. Has a big creamy dark tan head. The heady aroma of alcohol rises from the galss as you pour. As the beer settles the aroma of chocolate comes to the front with a little hint of coffee in the back. The chocolate flavor gives way for an almost esspresso like coffee hit. Definitely a very, very tasty treat. This bottle was marked "" Winter '03-'04 "".",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Turbohio,4.06,"Well, it is black alright. Even when I hold it to the light, like you are not supposed to, it is still black. Very good for a moderately priced imperial stout. The smell is so sticky it coats my nose. Coated with the aroma of coffee, espresso, dried fruits, I do not wonder why this style has remained named Imperial Stout. Tasted like chewy chocolate coffee but without the tear on the stomach. Mouthfeel: chewy in the Chewbacca sense. Drinkability: If you like Imperial Stouts, drink up. This is a great buy, because it is served in a sixer not a 22oz. bomber. Of all the types of beers I drink, I enjoy Imperial Stouts the most. This is the first Imperial Stout served from a 12oz bottle that compares on the level with the great 22oz bombers. Be it the over the top Averys or the dominating Stone and Rogue.

45,680,FormatKid,4.55,"Thanks for grabbing this one for me Blake, Ive been looking forward to it.  Classy looking bottle dated Winter 04-05. A really nice black pour, not even direct light penetrates. I get a nice sticky head composed of small bubbles with some big bubbles coming through the middle creating that oatmeal like look. The smell is nice, I pick up berries, dark chocolate, plum, roasty and scorched smells and a rum like alcohol aroma tickles my nostrils. This beer tastes even better then it smells. Again I pick up on the dark fruit flavors, espresso , charred malt, the alcohol character is definitely thereits more vinous then I first detected in the smell though. I dont want to forget about the namesake chocolate,to me I pick it up more as dry, dark cocoa powderdelicious. Bitterness clings to my lips which is another thing I love about a big stout. The alcohol comes out a lot more once its warm. The mouthfeel aint bad, but when it comes to big stouts I say the thicker the better and this one falls a little short of the very best big stouts Ive had. An awesome beer, I really wish I had more than six of them",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

What I notice the most is of course the chocolatey burnt coffee flavors. More importantly is the warm tingle it gives you! First sip and BAM!!! Well maybe this is just me, but damn! It is a combination of all the wintery cocoaEY coffeish flavors that are o so delightful.  I happen to think it is very drinkable, especially on its own. A great chillout beer.

45,680,Suds,4.57,"Had this one recently, as a desert, while out to dinner with some friends. Served on-tap, it was presented in a tall, pilsner style glass, with a thick brown head. The color was absolute obsidian: complete and solidly black. The aroma is intensely coffee-like, with a serious chocolate malt character. As the beer warms, a bit of alcohol creeps into the smell, along with a subtle ripe-fruitness, which add a lot of depth and complexity. The beer is full, thick, and substantial. A big front-end malt sweetness is balanced with roasted flavors that come out in the mid-taste and finish. Its a soft, creamy, and almost silky beer, with a hell of a lot of flavor. This is one beer to remember and seek out.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,frazbri,4.06,"Pitch black body topped by a tall, creamy mocha head. Fruit and chocolate with a little raisin aroma. Chocolate, coffee, raisin and rumcake flavors. Creamy but with low carbonation.  This is a complex, tasty stout. Chocolate is the most noticable flavor aspect, but it doesn't dominate the beer. There are a plenty of fruit notes. It's a good mix of flavors. I could drink this on any fall or winter evening.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,talkingpoints,3.05,"Just brought home the Brooklyn Chocolate Stout and was ready for that famed experience that the limited bottling implied. The pour was impressive as a dark chocolate filled my beer mug, the smell was pretty good with those hints of chocolate coming to bear. The taste, this part gets tricky. At first I thought it was exceptional on the mouth but then this taste of alcohol just overpowered the beer, which is weird since this is a chocolate stout. It was a decent stout but you couldn't drink more than one in a sitting. I will probably move on to something else for the winter without looking back.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Appearance: Black as pitch, black as coal, Black as my hard and evil soul. (Damn that's black.) The head is dark brown and lasting, though it does eventually degrade to a bit of sticky lacing.  Smell: Dark chocolate, sweet coffee, burnt toffee.  Taste: Slightly burnt flavor up front, dark roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate. Though a sweetness is evident on the midpalate, the finish is dry and slightly bitter.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and full bodied, with a wonderful smoothness  Drinkability: Beautiful drinking after dinner. This smoothed out fabulously over the last year.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,heidelbeerg,3.78,"This was a limited bottling - winter ' 04-' 05 . Poured a pitch black color with a nice thick brown/tan head. Smell is dark cocoa with a burnt/smokey scent. Taste was smooth and loaded with dark malt, cocoa, dried fruit and again a burnt taste. Very noticeable presence of alcohol. You can feel it in your chest. Too much in my opinion. Mouthfeel was rich, thick and very satisfying. Drinkability could be better if the alcohol wasn't overbearing.

45,680,taez555,3.76,"Winter 2003-2004 sampled in Oct 2004  This beer poured a PITCH black body with a very thick dark brown/tan head.  The nose was quite something. Alcohol, a rich unsweetened chocolate, cocoa powder, smoke, soft fruit, spice and even a touch of meat. What an interesting yet odd nose. Some soft roots smells along with the alcohol almost give it a belgian sort of flare. Sort of like a stout brewed with a trappist yeast. Interesting.  The taste was very thick, almost milkshake like. Theres up-front, burnt barley, taste. Nice big chocolate malt, a smooth milky texture mixed a touch of smoke. Its what I would image it was would taste like if I was licking the inside of a chimney then chased that with an unsweetened chocolate bar and glass of milk. Really not much bitterness or hops in this baby. Just enough to give it some balance but for the most part this beer is dominated by the big burnt chocolate taste.  This is one of those famous beers that everyone raves about. Personally I dont care for it. I can appreciate it and understand it, but its just not by cup of tea (glass of beer) The flavors just dont mix well and all of the positive aspects are canceled out by too much of an odd flavor mixed in.

45,680,rajendra82,4.3,"Opaque black and brown body was capped by a decent sized brown head, which dissipated soon. The aroma was roasty with chocolate and caramel. There was also a wine like alcohol aroma present. The taste was intensely dry, with the dark roasted malt, dark skinned fruit, chocolate malt, and raisins vying for attention. The alcohol provided a spicy warming backdrop. A very good 2003-2004 bottle via a trade from BeerAdvocate spritdeus, and thankfully now available in Georgia for a much cheaper indulgence.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,Beastdog75,3.88,"Winter '03-'04 bottling.  Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout is a great accompaniment to the cool weather. This is a beer that really does epitomize what a winter seasonal should be. If I had a fireplace I could imagine sitting by it, lounging back, and drinking a pint of this brew.  The brew pours a lovely near pitch-black color with some hints of sanguinous red to it. A dark tan foam forms, but thins out in a few moments after pouring. The smell heavily consists of the dark roasted aromas thanks to the burnt/black malts. Notes of espresso and some chocolate are noticable. There is a bit of carbonation in the beer, but not too much. The mouthfeel felt a bit sticky, adding to the ""rich"" persona of the brew. The flavor is thick and intense with notes of caramel early on followed by chocolate, but the dark roasted coffee notes were the most dominant. There is some alcohol presence noticable while tasting, but it does not take control of the brew. Mixed with the alcohol is a dark rum-like flavor. The finishes out with a dry, roasted bitterness which lingers into the aftertaste. There is a bit of alcohol burn in the end, making this brew quite warming.  The one thing I might say against this beer is that I would drink one bottle of it and it felt like it was enough. This certainly wasn't brewed for sessions. A sipping beer all the way, and one of the more intense stouts that I have sampled.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Aroma is lots of chocolate malt with light expresso aroma touch of dark fruity boquet with citrusy hops.

Good long aftertaste of sweetness and bitterness perfect mixture. Brooklyn did one hell of a job with this beer. Mouthfeel is right where it should be.

This is my ideal Imperial Stout as it had the ingredients that I usually desire. It had lots of deep rich malt notes rather than dark fruitiness that you find in some, yet I thought too much black malt was used in this one. Coffee, chocolate and mocha were present. For the style, this beer is alright.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Smell is roasted malt, chocolate and some alcohol. Taste is very smooth for a 8.5% ABV beer, though a tad sweet. Couldn't drink too many of these at once. Roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and a malty sweetness at the end. Very warming. Very pleasant aftertaste.

Pours storm-king black, with a small, milk-chocolate head.  The first hit on the palate is tangy & sweet with roasted malts. The tanginess fades out by the midsip and the roasted malts kick in, with the first hint of chocolate in the background. The aftertaste is like a mix of semi-sweet chocolate and yogurt: chocolatey and tangy all at once. There's also a bit of alcohol that comes through in the aftertaste, but it doesn't distract at all.  The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and nearly perfect. And drinkability is way too easy for 8.5%. I went through the bottle in the blink of an eye.  Damn, this is good stuff.

This is followed by a smooth chocolate and more roasted malts. Coffee is also in the mix and a slight nutty flavor as well. This beer finishes with a nice hop bitterness and a warm alcohol. YUM!

45,680,faernt,3.96,"I've been looking forward to trying this beer. Imperial Stout is one of my favorite styles and Black Chocolate Stout is highly regarded. This is a '03-'04 vintage and I chilled it to about 60 degrees F. It pours into the chalice in a silky stream that gives up a 1/4"" bronze head which subsides into a ring. The nose is slight. The taste is chocolate but rapidly delivers a surprise tang. The second taste and the tang is gone but the juiciness remains. This is an interestng sensation I don't often have. The result is a smooth mouthfeel.  The chocolatiness returns in the subsequent tastes and the mouthfeel is the silky sensation that matches the pour. I'm aware of the alcohol. This beer makes me curious.  I have other ""go to "" Imperial Stouts that are available locally that will keep me happy (Bell's Expedition, Rogue IS, North Coast Old Rasputin). This offering is similar to Victory Storm King. It's not the same as Storm King but it has the same attitude. I'll enjoy it again but I won't go out of my way to acquire it.

The head retention is fairly good as it sticks around for a few drinks and leaves a nice lace around the snifter as it is consumed. The aroma is reminiscent of Kahlua, with notes of coffee, dark chocolate and a slight hint of dark fruits. Taste is very much similar with a bitter sweet dark chocolate taste standing out front with roasted coffee and a slight earthy hop tone complementing it.

Aroma has some hints of caramel, cherry, black licorice, and roasted malts - but the overall scent I pick up is that of dark chocolate liqueor. This brew coats the mouth like syrup & is bittersweet. More licorice & cherry in the flavor profile, but also, of course, loads of dark chocolate. Alcohol is significantly more upfront than I would have hoped, though the brew becomes more well-rounded as it warms. All kinds of heavily roasted/burnt malt throughout. Finishes a little dry with long lasting chocolate truffle, espresso, & dark cherry.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,HardTarget,4.65,"Standard Brown 12 oz. bottle, vintage winter 03-04 Aroma: Rich coffee, chocolate malts and a slight bittersweet blend, very inviting. Appearance: I got a thin leather brown head that was fed by several streams of carbonation. A few small fingers of lace trailed after a very modest ring (I may need to take better care of my glassware). It looks like a glass of midnight; I had to put it right up against a bulb to get a few rays of light through that just showed clear black. Not brown, not ruby: black. Flavor: An oddly neutral taste while I hold it in my mouth, but as I swallow, the bomb goes off. First is a slight bitter spike, masterful use of hops. As that fades a sweet molasses soothes, followed closely by a rich, high quality tobacco taste that trails off into a wisp of smoke. As it warmed, I got a hint of alcohol taste but it was well hidden. Some nice toffee tastes came out late as well. The entire beer holds together as a complete package. Mouthfeel: This is one of the fullest beers I have ever put in my mouth, thicker than my heaviest homebrews. Almost syrupy, a heavy chew and it left about 7 coats throughout my entire mouth. It numbed my gums just slightly. Overall Impression: Glad I was sitting down, this stuff rocked my world. Beer for Russian Royalty? This is beer for the Gods! A superb Imperial Stout. As I check the BJCP guide for reference, Im not terribly surprised to find this beer listed as a classic example. Drinkability? While this beer slaked my thirst in a mighty way, I could probably drink another, and it is a beer Id be happy to acquire again. Many thanks to mattcrill (actually, his wife) for the bottle, I am indebted.

45,680,GuinnessSmurf,4.2,"This is a great imperial stout. As the name of the beer suggests, you get a bitter dark chocolate flavor in this beer. It is not overly sweet or sugary, but the chocolate remains the dominant flavor.  It has an appropriate amount of brown head that tops this heavy black/brown beer.

I'd drink it again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,dedalus,4.38,"winter 2003-2004 bottling  the beer looks great in a snifter, all deep black body and subdued caramel head.  the nose is stellar, full of roasted coffee, cocoa, and dark spicy notes.  there is a good bit of rough carbonation in the mouthfeel, which seems appropriate enough. i could have used a little more thickness in the body, but not too much.  deeply roasted espresso starts the flavors, followed by dark chocolate, black coffee, peppery alcohol, burnt raisins, and slight notes of hot tarmac. unfortunately, with the last three sips the roast became so harsh that it began to taste like rusted metal. that same metallic tinge makes me reticent to suggest that the beer is very drinkable. edit: i tried another bottle after a few days and the metal flavor was nowhere to be found. so, i tried a third ; ) and no metal. i've gone back and changed the numbers, and i recant my attack on the beer's drinkability. a truly decadent beer that shouldn't be missed. just hope you don't get an off bottle.  cheers,  s.d.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,wsouloa,4.44,"Stouts are not my favorite style but I am trying to taste more and more. I won't write any bad reviews for any stouts I have tried even if I don't like them because I feel I need to know the style better. That said, when I find a stout I like, I have to write a good review about it. Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is a great brew. Lets start with its appearance. Wow! Very dark brew and you cannot see any light through it. The head is kind of tan and dies down shortly after pouring. The smell is exceptional. Its really just what you would expect only better. It is a heavy aroma of chocolate and coffee. After taking a good whiff of the beer, there is no way you can wait to try it. Mmmmm chocolate. The beer has a bitter kick to it as well. I didn't really pay attention to the ABV and it surprises me that its so high. Disguised very well although you know you are having something over 6.5.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,abcsofbeer,4.73,"Well, even though a seasonal brew, I was able to obtain at the end of May. Brewed in the 03-04 season. I pulled a recommendation from the Brother's top 50 and went to one of my favorite brew stores to purchase. This was the only one available on my list.  Pours the blackest, darkest beer I have yet to see. Even when held up to the light, it remains dark and there is no seeing through it. Like oil from the can. A nice frothy, light brown head forms at the top, about two fingers, but dissipates quickly. Leaves trace amounts of lace that really cling to the glass.  The aroma is definitely malty and chocolate flavored. It has a wine-like aroma also. The taste is fabulous at first tilt of the glass towards the mouth. The nose gets a hint of the malty aroma first and then the taste kicks in as soon as it hits the mouth. Malty, bitter chocolate flavor fills the mouth. Even with the high ABV, there is no distinct alcohol flavor, a salute to the brewer goes out.  Once swallowed, there is left a nice bitter aftertaste that is really subtle yet distinctive. This is a fantastic and extremely good Stout. I will buy again and I highly recommend it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,shapudding,4.41,"First I just have to complement the label, it is just nice and classy, very stylish. It also lets you know that it has 6 varieties of black, chocolate, and roasted malts... nice. Poured pitch freakin' black, beautiful. Beige head reduced to a creamy but minimal ring around the edge of the glass. Amazingly what I taste reminds me of fresh red bell peppers, odd? but very good. Scents of roasted malts. (drank this in the same place with the annoying cigar guy lurking nearby, so he tampered the great experience of this beer... as much as I crawled away from him...) Tastes of chocolate and the roasted malts, godiva liquor (yummmm), black coffee... Not too thick or heavy, just perfect. Great mouthfeel and a nice lingering finish.

Had some nice bite to it, but the roasted/chocolate taste stood out the most for me Mouthfeel: Nice, thick body, almost velvety Drinkability:If you haven't guessed it yet, I would kill for this beer.

45,680,mattcrill,4.38,"Poured black as night with a small head that quickly dissolves. Very light carbonation but very nice. Smells of chocolate and nuts invade your nasal passages. Wonderful blend of sweetness (chocolate, coffee) and alcohol makes for a very smooth drink. I found it hard to enjoy b/c it was so good and I wanted to drink it too fast. Goes down easy and goes great with steak or hamburgers. For the price of a six pack, this could easily become a regular occurance for me. Just had another one today and oh my god! This is the stuff. Just a classic, complex, rockin' stout. This is definitely ""top 5"" in my book. If you see it, drink it.

The head is persistent and has a smooth creamy look and is composed of many tiny bubbles. There is something about the contrast in color between the body of a ""black"" beer and the head which I really enjoy--and so this beer from the start looks good to me. Strong aroma of chocolate (of course) and roast coffee. Very nice taste of chocolate and coffee malts with some nice hop bitterness in the finish.

Dark chocolate is also pickupable in the smell, as well as toffee. very rich scent...so well done, bravo Brookyln. The taste of this beer is absolutely orgasmic.  Taste of course runs hand in hand with smell, I'm getting an initial dark chocolate flavor, with a heavy cream coating....followed up by accents of toffee, hazelnut, roasted nuts, and dark coffee. In addition to this, a nice little jab of hops hits you at the end of all those flavors. The alcohol is hidden like mom's cookies, and this is crucial since the alcohol content is so high. Leaves you feeling warm and cozy. I can't praise the taste of this stout enough.  This beer comes highly recomended, from me that is....",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BeerResearcher,4.17,"12oz brown bottle. Brewed in Utica, NY. It pours a roofing tar color with a big, but fast fading tan head. A smoky sweet malt aroma has a strong smell of coffee and a good whiff of bitter chocolate. An extra heavy and rich malt is home to tastes of dark chocolate, sweet coffee, doughy malt, black licorice and molasses. High in a complex mix of hops, this brew has an edgy grapefruit bitterness and a hint of tea-like tartness. The alcohol, while not over-powering is certainly noticeable. This is a high impact brew!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,oelergud,4.9,"02-03 WoW what a beer! Like pouring the blackest night into your glass the head is a creamy brown, doesn't last long but looks great. The smell is strong and robust, alcohol and chocolate very apparent, I thought I could detect a hint of almond/marzipan which probably isn't there but it's the closest I can get to it. Sweet and thick, this brew goes down easy, little to no acid or bitterness shows itself until you let the after taste manifest, the alcohol gives the stout a good kick making the beer have a strong presence about it. Good chocolate taste throughout. Only regret I have about this beers drinkability is the high alcohol % which makes is hard to indulge without getting drunk off your ass  Oelergud - Cheers!  03-04  Been storing this bottle in the fridge for about 6 months. Beautiful black brew with a chocolate head, doesn't stay long though and almost no lace. Impossible to determine level of carbonation as absolutely no light gets through this beer. Smell is semisweet chocolate, strong spice, alcohol and earth. Very apparent alcohol tones in the taste but overpowered by the rich chocolate flavors, swirling earth and dark roasted coffee beans. Subtle hops underneath the malts struggling to be noticed Thick and full body, almost syrupy, creamy and leaving a nice sweet coating on the tongue. Each swallow sends waves of warmth through your being. Strong robust and demanding attention and respect, this is still one hell of a beer.  -Oelergud  04-05, 11/12/04  Black tar goodness slowly oozing out of the bottle, beautiful effect on the edge of the beer as bubbles go up and down, tan creamy head decent retention and great lace leaving rings after each draw. Strong roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate and alcohol makes up the nose. strong malts overwhelm the hops. Taste is liquid dark chocolate with an alcoholic charge pinning the tongue to the ground. Rich and powerful maltiness and some faint hops dominate the aftertaste which is smooth and lasting quite long. Mouthfeel is perfect stout thick, chewable indeed.

45,680,PopeJonPaul,4.48,"This was the first beer I had when I first visited NY in June 2001. I'm still drinking it, and I still joke that it impressed me enough to get me to move out here.  This beer has the expected dark chocolate color and a thin head the color of swiss milk chocolate that fades quickly, but leaves a chocolate ring on the glass. The taste is outstanding, the strength of the chocolate flavor is perfect, with a sharp hint of the 8.5% ABV underneath. Goes down smooth, with a bit of a coffee aftertaste (a bit too much, which detracts a little from the drinkability as you'll want a glass of water afterwards.) Ranks up there with the best IMO.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Pours a dark, rich brown, very thick, very creamy, with a nice creamy, tan head. desert in a glass. Smells like roasted mocha (yeah, I know...) very nice.  It is appropoe that chocolate is the main taste in this bear. yeah there is malt, and some hops, but the chocolate definately shines through here, mixed with a spice, roasted malt flavor. Other people have mentioned this, and it is true, the chocoalte is overpowering, but it is still done in a nice way.

It poured, much to my surprise almost flat, then toward the end of the pour a show of chocolate brown arose from the dark bottom to cascade to a nice, soft, full one inch head. The aroma of dark chocolate and roasted malts greet the nose. The taste follows the same route but with rich detail. This is a heavy player among beers but the mouthfeel, though sharp with dark chocolate, is pleased. Drinkability is good for the higher abv. Overall a good annual treat. I'll look forward to next years batch.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DaveGood,3.65,"This beer poured a deep dark black with a nice head. The head slowly diminished, leaving a nice lacing that remained for the duration. The aroma was filled with roasted malts and chocolate. The taste was true to the aroma as it was also a nice combination of dark roasted malts and a dark chocolate. The drawback here is that the chocolate taste is overwhelming and it takes away from any of the other flavors that are hidden in there. The mouthfeel was relatively thick and heavy but the drinkability was good. Overall, this would make an excellent desert beer but I couldn't see drinking a couple of these over the course of an evening.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Bruiser81,4.08,"I've been holding on to this one for a while now. Thanks to Fishbone for sending this one out. I can't tell if its black or extremely dark brown, either way it looks delicious. Big thick creamy head the color of chocolate milk. Aroma is pleasant but faint. Definate alcohol spices, roasted malt, and a sort of earthen smell. Maybe a bit of raisans as well. Taste is very good. I expected more of a strong chocolate flavor. Instead its a very subdued unsweetened chocolate, hidden behind tons of roasted malt. A little bit of sweetness, almost with a dark fruit like quality. A small tinge of alcohol on the finish but it leaves a nice aftertaste. It sure is going down quick. Real smooth and creamy, but I could only handle one of these babys at a time.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Swirl released rich roasted malt aromas and a bit of alcohol. Body is smooth a medium-full for the style, with a gentle carbonation. Malts upfront, chocolate and roasted flavors, developing with a slight hop profile on the way down, and a nutty chocolate aftertaste, alcohol becoming more apparent as the glass drains.

45,680,Mitchster,3.5,"Winter 03-04' Made with 2-row English Malt, Wheat Malt, Chocolate Malt, Black Malt, Black Barley, and Roasted Barley. East Kent Goldings, Cascade, and Willamette hops. Alcohol: 8.5% by volume.  Pours out completely opaque with nary any highlights when held to a halogen lamp, forming a rocky dark-tan head with good retention and average lacing. Carbonation is mild to moderate, perfect for the style. Aroma is complex, but not as rich as I would expect, with notes of sweet milk chocolate, vanilla, a hint of light-roast coffee and with swirling, alcohol, prunes, and a faint vegetal hoppiness. As it warms, it takes on more barley-wine characteristics, with prominent dark fruits, esters, and alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium-soft with a dense body. Taste begins much the same as aroma, but the middle and finish are completely different. The middle is predominated by a semi-ruddy English hop flavor and a disconcerting level of metal off-taste, then the finish has a pronounced herbal alcohol twang, an acrid tone of oxidized black patent astringency, alcoholic esters, vanilla and grain husk (exactly in that order). Pronounced chalkiness on the lips, most likely secondary to mineralifaction (is that a word?) of their water source.  I was really looking forward to this brew based upon the other reviews here. While fervently complex, sadly, it doesn't hold a candle to my other favorite stouts (Shakespeare, Kalamazoo, Rasputin). The off-flavors are simply too much and severely limit it's drinkability. I would pass on this one. Fermented with a different yeast, this might be a winner. I expect much more of my stouts.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Bighuge,3.78,"'01-'02: Pours black with a big and dense dark brown head. This baby's got some retention too. Laces nice rings all the way to the bottom of the glass. Roast and chocolate malt on the nose. Fairly light in body for an Imperial. Not a light body, but not full bodied by any means. I would say it is medium bodied. Nice roastiness in the taste. Slight coffee-like bitterness. And a little alcohol. This does not have the deep complexities or the body that an Imperial should have.     03-04:  Pitch Black. Small brown head with great retention. Lacing is excellent as well. Nice aroma of chocolate, burnt malts and cocoa. The taste is nice and chocolatey. Bittersweet. And a little fruity as well. Currants and dark cherries. Rum soaked raisins. Body is about meium. Highly drinkable. This beer is good, but doesn't have the guts of some of the Big Boys. Good brew though.

Roasted chocolate and tangy hops bluster out this heavenly aroma. The taste is again the roasted chocolate with a smokey undertone and balanced with slightly tangy hops and a dry powdery cocoa finish. This is a medium bodied brew that finishes with an warming alcohol end.  Notes: Although a very solid chocolate stout, but pales in comparison to Roque's version.

I'm glad that it didn't dissapoint. It pours a jet black with a 1 finger tan foam head. Smell is very rich and full of roasted malts. Taste is super rich too, malts all around. A few hints of dark fruits (I'm thinking plum) also pop up. Mouthfeel viscous but the taste sticks around so that helps a little bit.

45,680,99bottles,3.49,"Looking forward to this for a long time. Winter '03-'04. I wish I could have found an aged one. Pours black as the night itself. Small tan head that quickly....disappears? I have it at a good stout temperature. I wonder why there's no head? Anyway. Smell: Oooooh that's nice. No hop bitterness in the nose. Faint alcohol over rich chocolate. Really pungent malt smell. Taste: Smooth. Dark chocolate. Quite sour. No discernible hop character over the heavy chocolate malt. The label mentions imperial stouts. This seems very boderline. Very bitter aftertaste in a very different way. Not hop bitterness but more like...unsweeted baker's chocolate bitterness. Mouthfeel is a little thin for me, especially for a limited edition winter stout. Lack of head and hops really disappoints me. Usually it takes me a long time to wash a glass that had an imp stout in it. My roomates bitch at me because I bring down pint glasses with week old sticky Storm King lace crusted from top to bottom. This beer's microscopic head didn't even stick on the sides. I guess drinkability might be ok, but I really can't see myself wanting another. Sorry, Brooklyn but I feel let down.

45,680,canucklehead,4.38,Thanks to Malto for this sample. This is a 01/02 bottle  Big and dark this beer has a vinous nose that shows the age in the cellar for this example. The interesting thing about this beer is that it starts off intense and hoppy and slides into a smooth chocolate comfort zone. It's almost as chocolatey as Rogue Chocolate but this beer is malt only no adjuncts. I want to eat cheescake and smoke a Romeo y Juliet with this great beer. Storm King might be more intense but this is one of the great classy big beers in the world.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Fish113d,4.38,"When I opened this bottle and poured it into my brand new goblet, it poured and left a nice edge of head, which clung to the glass after I tasted it.  However before tasting, I noticed a nice robust dark malty chocolate-T smell eminating from the glass. I also got a hint of mochachino coffee from it. Upon tasting, the carbonation really came through, which I found weird considering I drank it at room temperature. However, the chocolate came through nicely w/ a bit of a smokey roasted malty taste, which really made me happy!

Taste begins with rich chocolaty malts and espresso along with some fruity notes of ripe prunes. A bit of black liquorish then makes an appearance with a touch of acidic hop resins and finally some winey notes in the end.

Appearance: Obsidian black topped by a smallish dark brown head that's rather short-lived. A thin ring of bubbles was all that was left after about a minute. Still, that ring was sufficient to leave small wisps of lace as I greedily imbibed this elixir.  Smell: Powerful roasted malt aromas. Thick dark chocolate and hearty espresso. Mild notes of prune-like fruit.  Taste: Bittersweet like a teenage gothling imagines their soul to be. Chicory-laced black coffee earthy and bitter dark chocolate aftertastes. Umbrally dark prune notes.  Mouthfeel: Thick and chewy with hearty aftertastes aplenty. Hits the spot.  Drinkability: Black as night, Sweet as love, Strong as death. Nummilicious. I know of no one who has had this that didn't like this beer, and I've been handing it out to neophytes (or at least people that wouldn't consider themselves overly knowledgeable).

45,680,bditty187,3.53,"Black hue. Opaque. The russet head is simply gorgeous; it reached a modest finger in height before slowly collapsing to a half finger then to a soapy cap. There was no lacing, disappointing. Still this is a damn pleasant looking stout. The nose is dry with deep chocolate notes and well-rounded roasted malts, vague hints of alcohol toward the back. The potency is good, it doesnt really punch you in the nose but it is strong enough to say, hey, jackass drink me! I am a good listener. The palate is much more complex then the aromas indicated. I am surprised at the fruitiness upfront, notes of cherries really standout and they dance a sexy dance with the roasted malts. Burning alcohol is blunt in the middle; the malt is quite dry now. In the finish a mellow suggestion of coffee and chocolate develops, as does some sweetness. This is offset by spicy alcohol. The hoppiness is as subtle as Storm King is blunt. Overall the taste is very good but I cant help thinking more burnt malt is needed, maybe even a little more hops. And, in all honestly, it does fall apart at the end. Medium-full in body, at times it did creep awfully close to medium, which I dont think is appropriate for this beer, the carbonation is modest and very natural. The mouthfeel is sufficient. It is drinkable as a nightcap; the biting alcohol is too much for me. Maybe my sample is too young (03-04 edition) but I wanted to try it now! I believe there are better Imperial Stouts on the market but this one is worthy of your attention but maybe not its lofty reputation.

45,680,PartyHatjo,4.46,"2003-2004 Edition This beer pours a very dark brown--nearly as black as an oil. Very viscous for a beer. The head was about a half an inch of dark tan creamy goodness, but dissipated very quickly to a monolayer of head.  The aroma is inherently roasted malt, with no hint of hops at all--it's chocolatey and somewhat burnt.  The taste is roasty-malty with hints of chocolate, raisins and prune. There is a slight tang that lingers on the back of the tongue. The bitter aftertaste is a welcome after the somewhat sweet initial flavor.  This beer is very smooth. It practically rolls off the tongue. Carbonation is high enough to break out new flavors, yet not so much that it crackles in your mouth.  For a higher alcohol beer, this is one that I can take a few of.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,UnionMade,4.08,"2003-2004 edition. The beer is a very deep, murky umber, pretty much black, topped with a thick, dusky olive hued khaki froth. The head dies out to a thick film, but keeps for the remainder of the glass. The aroma is hugely roasty, with a mellowing smoothness that blends everything seamlessly. The malt is slightly husky, with loads of chocolate and coffee. A bit of burnt toffee sweetness, with a touch of charred wood and smoke. A thin layer of fig and prune esters are spread over the malt, with a dash of date and light chicory. As the beer warms, a bittersweet baker's chocolate becomes readily apparent, consuming the air within the snifter. Very mild alcohol, mostly masked by the burnt, roasty malt. The flavor starts immediately with mellow, bittersweet chocolate malt, a bit of chicory adding a woodiness that pervades throughout. Pleasant esters are spread over the malt, lending a gentle fruitiness that hints at prune, fig, banana, and black cherry. A touch of blackberry into the finish, meeting mild, balancing english hops. The bitterness is mostly derived from the heavy roastiness, a charred woodiness and black coffee stretching out the finish. A slight alcoholic twang in the swallow. Coffee and chocolate linger in the aftertaste. A very nice year. I missed last year's version, but this year seems much smoother that I recalled from previous versions. Surprisingly easy drinking for such a massive beer, with an excellent bittersweet chocolate flavor.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,bigjohn,4.57,"2003-2004 Edition I have never tried it before this year, and I must say I was highly impressed. This is one of the best stouts that I have sampled. It is flavorful and smooth, and in my opinion, right up there with Storm King. In fact, I would almost prefer this to the storm king because it is far more drinkable in my opinion. The beer is extremely dark, it is opaquely black when held up to the light, not allowing any to pass through, with the faintest red tinges around the edges. The taste is excellent, and the alcohol is extremely well disguised in my opinion. Overall, I would say that this is one of my favorite brews. In my region (New Jersey) it is quite easy to find, but I would recommend others who cannot find it locally to seek it out through a trade or other arrangement because it is certainly worth it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Bierguy5,4.13,"12 oz. bottle of this year's batch. Pours a dark, almost completely black liquid with a tan foamy head. Looks good so far. Smells of chocoalte and almost black licorice. Stron hops, cjocolate and almost like aprune taste. I could really feel the higher alcohol presence. Good mouthfeel, maybe a touch thin. Probably couldn't have more than one or two of these. Still a good imperial stout. I had some success cellaring last year's batch and it turned out very well, although I didn't review it. Anyway, don't pass this one up.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,GnomeKing,4.5,"This seasonal gives me a reason to appreciate winter, even though I hate the cold and snow. The beer has a strong, pleasant smell of malt. It leaves minimal lacing as you sip mouthful after tasty mouthful.  There's a sharp, hoppy aftertaste, followed by a second aftertaste that is malty and sweet. The first taste gives the impression that the beer is simple by the standards of stouts, but the complexity comes out in the after taste. The head is thick and creamy. It's surprisingly drinkable for a beer with 8.5 ABV.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,GCBrewingCo,4.55,"The beer poured motor oil black with just a slight ruby highlight. The head was brown and huge, lasting to lace the glass.  The aroma was huge roasted and chocolate. Just a slight hint of alcohol and plenty of fruitiness. A complex assortment of aromatics.  The flavor was smooth with plenty chocolate. In the background is intense bitterness to balance the malt. Also some dark fruit in the flavor.  The finish was dry bittersweet chocolate. The body was full.  A complex, very enjoyable brew.  12 ounce bottle. Vintage '03-'04.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BuckeyeNation,3.6,"Ink black with the barest sliver of ruby at the edges. BBCS is as close to absolute black as it's possible to get... without quite getting there. The expansive crown is dark tan in color and appears sticky enough to have some staying power. There's isn't much lace, though small ragged sheets are seen.  The aroma is redolent of sweet dark roasted malt, with the usual RIS overlay of chocolate and black coffee. The former is more prominent than the latter. Hops don't make much of an olfactory splash.  My first impression of the flavor is that the alcohol is more evident than it should be. It isn't masked well at all. There's plenty of bittersweet chocolate, which is nice. It's like drinking a melted Hershey's Special Dark chocolate bar mixed with espresso and vodka. Too bad it's a little too raw and burnt/charred.  This beer doesn't have the power, the depth or the complexity of Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout or Bell's Expedition Stout. Masking the alcohol more completely would go a long way toward letting the flavor profile free to do its thing. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth. No complaints there.  I don't know if cellaring this relatively fresh Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout will soften it a little, but I'll give it a try since I have five bottles left to drink.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

The huge head to beer ratio doesn't get me down, though, because I've been waiting to taste this one for a long time.  Aroma was smooth, with chocolate peaking through here and there. Upon tasting, I found a very smooth brew with a soft finish full of bitter chocolate and earthy tones. I thought this was really drinkable for an imperial stout, though a touch thinner in the mouth than I had anticipated. It also had a nice crispness, thought it also meant the chocolate only stayed with me for a short time.  I had huge expectations for this beer, and it mostly lived up to them. All around, a smooth, subtle beer (especially for an imperial). Very good.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,PhantomVodoo,3.93,"'03-'04 bottling. Pours a dark brown to black. Opaque black in the glass. Nice brown head. Aroma shows plenty of roasty malt and coffee. Some chocolate and alcohol as well. A bit of earthiness.  Taste shows an imperial stout with plenty of roasty bitterness. Roasted malt and coffee are predominant. Alcohol is pretty evident. Slight chocolate notes. Solid balance. An overall earthy character.  Solid body and mouthfeel, but not as thick as lots of other imperial stouts. Drinkability knocked down a notch due to the prevalent roasty bitterness and alcohol.  Overall, a good imperial stout, although I prefer my imperial stouts sweeter than this one.

45,680,Mangus,4.38,"I had this on tap at Market Cross Pub in Carlisle, PA last night with my wife's uncle. He treated me to a celebratory beer(s) in honor of our son who was born a little over 2 weeks ago.  The waitress brought me a black, light-tight beverage with a nice tan head. It looks thick and rich.  Smells are roasted malt with definite dark chocolate and coffee overtones.  The first sip brought a rich, creamy, smooth, roasted molasses flavor. The second sip was gloriously chocolate and coffee-like and left a lingering sweet tickle on the sides of my tongue. This is one awesome beer!  I wouldn't suggest having this beer with a meal. Instead, have it all by itself and enjoy each delicious mouthful.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,RoyalT,4.47,"Appearance  Ill actually call this black in color (which I seldom due) with a decent head.  Smell  This is as roasty as it gets. The malts and chocolate are super-dark, reflecting the color of the ale. I can actually pick up several types of chocolate here, a fine dark style being the most prominent. The roasted malts are burnt and lovely, showing a lot of depth in character.  Taste  This is like drinking dark chocolate coca powder. It is so dark and so chocolaty, its unbelievable. This one definitely lives up to its name.  The malts are equally as mature, complimented at the tongue with some nice fruiting that I failed to pick out at the nose. I particularly enjoy the prune and cherry mix that Im getting here.  Mouthfeel  This was not full in the mouth, but it was very big with an amazing smoothness. It will most assuredly pucker your mouth with the bitter dark chocolate character.  Drinkability  I thought about eating a Hersheys with this just for kicks, but decided to enjoy the flavors all on their own. This was incredible.  Comments  A big thanks to OldFrothingSlosh who sent me this just for the hell of it after we did a previous trade. This was an enjoyable and very unique experience for me, and I greatly appreciate the gesture.  BeerAdvocates rule!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,Hagbard,3.6,"Pours a dark black, it looks just like chocolate syrup. It left a minimalist light-tan head that didn't stay around for long. The aroma is very powerful, reaching my nose after the pour, before bringing my glass up off the table. It smells of chocolate, like a chocolate milkshake. Not much else, as far as I can tell. The taste is similar, starts of very chocolatey and the chocolate sticks around through much of the sip. As I swallowed, and especially when I breathed out my nose, I noticed a sharp bitter metallic taste, which wasn't especially pleasing. The alcohol is hidden extremely well behind the chocolate background. The mouthfeel is very heavy and syrupy, but seems very appropriate for this beer. The carbonation level is nice. Though the pint went down easily enough, I couldn't drink more than 2 of these in a sitting and 1 per sitting seems more appropriate.  I liked this beer, but was a little disappointed with it. Chocolate stouts have been hit or miss with me, I love Young's but didn't like Rogue very much. This falls in the middle. The chocolate taste was not overwhelming, like Rogue's, but there isn't much else going on. It is not as smooth as Young's. The BBCS is a very nice dessert beer...actually skip the dessert and just drink this! I was a little surprised that this was an imperial stout, as I didn't notice the complexity I normally do with the style. I also didn't really notice the alcohol at all.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Malty caramel aroma, some alcohol sense, overall sweetish and milk chocolate though. Mouthfeel is excellent, smooth and consistent and well-composed. Impression is chocolate-based to be sure, a touch of roast and coffee, but overall, very sweet. Pleasant aftertaste. In many ways this beer falls short of Imperial fire and comes off a tad too saccharin for me.

45,680,ngandhi,2.47,"2002-2003 vintage  Who put highland scotch in my glass? The nose on Brooklyn is alcohol muddied by stale mocha and what the wine world would call ""funk."" Deep with earth yet ready to burst with hops, the stout smells like a true Russian IS mixed with the overhopped American intepretation. Either that, or it smells like the reason Russia needed its own IS -- by the time the 3abv British stouts made it over to the Ukraine, they had begun to rot.  The taste is thin. I'm immediately pressed with bitterness -- some from the hops and some from an overuse of burnt grain. The main taste isn't chocolate or any variation of chocolate malt; it's cola and alcohol. And somewhere within all of this is a shot of sherry finished highland scotch.  I would say this beer is young, but the weak flavors, low alcohol, and overall washed out quality makes me think this stuff wouldn't stand a chance in the cellar. And, if the alcohol really is under 10% in this vintage, Brooklyn does a miserable job of masking it.  Relax, relax. ng",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Good thing I got another bottle today from ManekiNeko in my BIF 4.0 package, gotta let this thing age for awhile and try it again. I just couldn't get through this.

Little to no head, giving way to a clear view into the darkness of the beer. It smells exactly like chocolate or dark patent malts. The roast is everpresent. The taste however, highlights this roasted smell. Imagine the darkest chocolate you've ever eaten mixed with coffee but without the bitterness. Until the end of the sip, when you have an aftertaste of the alcohol with a lingering roast. This is definitely a sipper, as it is full of flavor as well as a high ABV.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,clvand0,4.58,"Been waiting to try this one. Pours an extremely dark color with a thin tan head that leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was mostly just malts, but there was a faint hint of coffee and a little less of chocolate. Now for the flavor: Initially I got a burst of dark chocolate flavor, followed closely by a sweet malty flavor, then it finished with a strong alcohol tone. A lot more smooth than I had first imagined, but it could be more so if they could mask the alcohol a little better. Still a wonderful brew and the initial burst of chocolate was superb. Loved this one. I think it took me nearly 40 minutes to finish it because I kept just sipping it to get the most of the flavor.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,RocketWidget,4.43,"Reviewed from notes.  A dark, straight black in color, with a thick brown cream head. Has a roasted, malt like smell. Taste is eloquent (if that is proper English), tasting like burnt chocolate, but lingers with a dark chocolate aftertaste. Surprisingly, this brew is quite sweet and malty for a stout. Hoppy and delicious. The carbonation seems especially strong. Very easy to drink, I love this stuff! Thumbs up.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,irishmoss,4.35,"Poured a thick, ebony body with a dark tan head that dissipated rather quickly (even with a vigorous pour). Small bits of lace we sparsely scattered around the glass. The aroma was all malt with espresso and chocolate, but not as chocolate as I expected. The taste was amazing, a little un-sweetened chocolate chip flavor up front. This gave way to bitterness like coffee beans and dark roasted malt. Can still taste the chocolate hare, but this beer never got sweet like I may have expected it to. Finishes crisp and dry with a little hoppiness that made this damn near perfect. Great chewy mouth feel and dense body. The alcohol warms a bit, but is not overpowering. This chocolate stout is a little more drinkable than I expected it to be. Well done.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

It's slightly sour even which is a great contrasting flavor that gives this a lot of depth. The alcohol flavor is amazingly hidden.  Mouthfeel and body are great.  A very tasty beer that I am so, so glad I bought when I was out East. Comparing this to Young's Double Chocolate Stout is worthless, they are too different, but both are awesome.

The head disappointingly faded away quite quickly.  The scent? Not as enticing as I'd hoped - mostly just esters and alcohol, and no chocolate or malt.  But the taste? Mmmmm. Almost like biting into a piece of very dark chocolate. Yum. A lingering burnt wood taste, almost of burnt nuts stuck around, causing me literally to say outloud ""My god that's delicious"" without realizing it (I was alone at the time). A smoky, burnt taste lingers even more, reminding me slightly of peanut butter for some reason. As it warmed I even detected a bit of cherries in there, along with the malt and chocolate.

45,680,Foxman,4.35,"It pours a rich, dark chocolate brown, until the glass is full, when it becomes a light-proof black. There's a dense, creamy tan head, retaining well, then settling to a mottled, oily crust of tight bubbles. A fine veil of lacing slides slowly back to the pool on the sides of the glass.  There's a strong dark malt aroma, roasted in nature, and a very real chocolate presence. There's a sweetness that carries the whiff of alcohol, and a trace of hops fighting through the fog of grain.  A sip brings a sweet shot of roasted malt, tasting almost baked, like bread, with a nasal spritz of alcohol. There's espresso seasoned with dark chocolate, and an alcohol glow as it works its way down. There's an understated hops flavor that comes on slightly stronger at the very finish. Interestingly, also at the finish was a taste of what I could only identify as fine leather, like a good wallet, and while that may sound bizarre, I can tell you it was not at all unpleasant.  It's not as heavy as I expected, but well heavier than medium. It coats the mouth teasingly, lingering like a tasty oil, and finishing with the anticipated bitter hops tingle.  The hops play an especially understated role in this beer, but with the density of complexity of the malt component, the uneveness is actually a good thing, keeping it from becoming too busy. The high ABV comes through clearly, but that's a necessary by-product of the prodigious grain bill. In spite of the alcohol, I could easily have one or two more and still function happily. Well, OK, I wouldn't be operating any heavy machinery, but I would be wearing a simple satisfied grin.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Alcohol warmth adds another layer.  Smooth, although Young's Double Chocolate has the edge here.  Great dessert. Fitting for a winter stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,Boilermaker88,4.7,"Winter '03-'04 edition. Poured from a 12oz. bottle. Had an inpenetrable jet black color with a firm, lumpy mocha head that left little lace. Smell was a noseful of black malts, dark fruit, chocolate and alcohol aromas. The taste was a plethora of roasted black malt, lightly sweetened with some black currant and prune notes. A hefty dose of baker's chocolate and a hard alcohol punch finished off each taste. There was a long bitter chocolate and burnt grain taste and a warming alcohol kick. The feel was full, rich, and chewy, with a dry finish. A real potent brew that isn't afraid to show off the alcohol content inside. Drinkability took a minor hit as the prominant alcohol taste kept me from knocking this beer back in short order.

Some chocolate malts, plums, dark roast coffee beans on the nose, quite pleasant. An incredible first impression beverage. Big bodied brew, almost syrupy up front; the initial twange is a combo of burnt/roasted malts, chocolate, coffee beans and a touch of alcohol noted. As she warms, the alchol is a bit more noticeable, a citric hop character comes through, dark fruit notes as well.

There are earthy, musty notes of wet wool mittens, wood and iodine. Burnt molasses turned into rum aged for a century in charred port barrels. Black rubber flip flops on hot asphalt. Too fizzy to establish a chocolate fruit flavor, there is an over-extracted coffee impression that remains from beginning to end.

There is definitely more of an aroma of chocolate than of roast malt and coffeee, thogh these aromas are here as well. Quite a bit of toasted biscuit aromas serve as a back drop to the chocolate.  Quite flavorful and malty. I get coffee notes in the middle and the finish is, surprise, all chocolate. Some what sweet, though this sweetness is quite subdued by all of the dark-malt flavors. The alcohol is farily hidden, though perhaps there is a hint of it in the finish. This beer fits perfectly right now in my hands, on this chilly desert night. As the beer sits in my glass a bit, I can pick up the alcohol in the aroma. This is quite good, quite enjoyable.

45,680,Loki,4.68,"Sampled from a 12oz bottle with the wrapped neck label that reads ?Limited Bottling ? Winter 03-04?. No freshness date or strength listed.  Appearance: Brooklyn Black is a misnomer. Brooklyn ""Void of Light"" or ""Black Hole"" Chocolate Stout would be more appropriate. Light simply vanishes in the creamy void. The only light comes from the cocoa colored, cream head. Good lacing and great retention.  Smell: Simple, but effective. Overly roasted, almost burnt, not quite toasted malt with dark, unsweetened chocolate.  Taste: Mythical, stuff borne of legends. This elixir enters the mouth as an invading horde of burnt malt and dark chocolate, quickly supressing all with its rich, thick, chewy body and flavors. As if a heat source in itself, it warms the mouth and body with alcohol and tastes as if someone had roasted the malt and melted the dark chocolate in your mouth.  Mouthfeel: Thick, dominating and yet smooth and creamy. Solid and liquid all at the same time. Wonderous.  Drinkability: As long as your not driving it is suppurb. Fill this the body, mind, and soul with a warmness and bliss rarely found in a brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,CharlesRiver,4.2,"Since I am having this on tap and it is 2003, I am guessing this is from the '03 vintage. Solid black with no sign of light. The head is about 1/4 inch and is tan. Doesn't seem to be moving much, just a couple of bubbles here and there.  The smell is full of chocolate, malt and coffee. This is just what I expected. Upon tasting it seems different than last years. The hops seem a bit more present as well as the coffee. Once again, the alcohol is completely hidden.  Watch out, this one will get 'cha.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BrewDoctor,4.68,"12/13/03 - My lucky day! I was able to try this one on tap recently while visiting my wife's family in Long Island. After looking through a long list of beer's at Croxley's, I couldn't pass up this beauty.  Appearance: Black, dark and malty. However, the lighting at the bar did not allow me to really analyze the color The medium sized head was a dark mocha like espresso and remained in tact for the first few minutes.  Smell: A variety of rich roasted malts that say 'get ready, here I come' . The hop character was strong enough to rise through the malts.  Taste: Simple delicious! A symphony of roasted malt flavor, chocolate, and caramel to add a perfect level of sweetness. The alcohol flavor adds some spice, but it's not overpowering. It is relatively complex and leaves you savoring each distinct flavor. Like the smell, hops make a mild showing and add a great balance.  Mouthfeel & drinkability: A smooth, yet moderately powerful brew. There was light to medium carbonation which seemed to fit perfectly.  Overall: One of the best stouts I've ever had. Hands down, this is the best Brooklyn product I've tried to date.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Realale,3.88,"Opaque black. Very fine light mocha head.  Well-balanced, slightly bitter nose. Good dose of malt, chocolate leading the way. Overall its a bit subdued.  Nice in the mouth. Again, the balance is there. Chocolate leads the malt parade. Mouthfeel is good for the style, and the length is quite nice. A very good basic stout.  Tasted blind at the 12/14/03 St. Louis BA tasting. The above is my note prior to revealing the identity of the beer. Obviously, its not a basic stout, but it sure drinks like one. Don't know where they hid the alcohol. Not really up to Imperial standards in taste, but a very tasty brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,FranklinPCombs,3.41,"Typical of the style, this beer pours jet black out of the bottle, with no light escaping through the liquid. There is a good amount of bubbly tan head, which recedes slowly in to a thin collar and a churning froth on top. The smell is quite odd to say the least. The only words that come to my mind when the smell hits my nose are salty raisinettes. There is very little scent of hops or malt because they are over powered by this off-chocolate fruity smell. The taste is more pleasant than the smell is. It is a smooth beer to drink, although it leaves a slightly chalky feel in the mouth. The taste is that of burnt malt and a little coffee and chocolate, hiding the hops underneath. The smell of this beer is strong enough to influence the initial taste as it hits your tongue. The aftertaste is very subtle roast coffee. Although there is alot of flavor to this beer, it is a bit unbalanced. Regardless, its not bad at all.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TheLongBeachBum,4.38,"Presentation: Well Ive been staring at this beauty for a few days now, over a week actually. It sat in my fridge looking like one of those expensive boxes of Chocolates. A tall thin 12 ounce bottle, the obverse label has an expensive looking black and gold label with some splashes of white. The wrapped neck label states that this is Limited Bottling  Winter 03-04. No freshness date or strength listed.  Appearance: Pitched Tar blackness fools the eye from a distance. Closer inspection reveals a true Black Body impervious to all but the stray Neutrino. A dark brown cocoa head smoothly forms once the nitrogenous turbiduous activity settles. A smooth looking 'milk colored with chocolate rice crispies' head slowly settles to a thin covering  Nice lacing with good conditioning.  Nose: Burnt, roasted and toasted malts mixed with dark Belgium unsweetened chocolates. Simple but impressive.  Taste: Imperious is a great word, which is often bounded about willy-nilly  but this Stout IS imperious. Massive roastness and lots of rich deep thick melted dark alcohol fused dark chocolates. Astringent finish that has a mild sweetness right at the end.  Mouthfeel: Has a mouthfeel bigger than I expected, its very thick and smooth on the oral senses. It sits in the mouth like a fresh fluffy flannelette blanket. Viscous and lube-oil like, the carbonation helps to spread the beer around the mouth and assists the Drinkability no end. Solid and Bold.  Drinkability: EyeChartBrew had a Six-Pack of this and shared it out amongst a few BAs. I am not sure if I am more impressed with this huge act of kindness or the fact that I am ashamed to say that I need to the visit the homes of those who have yet to drink theirs so I can pinch them. This is a very smooth easy drinking Imperial Stout.  Overall: A present from San Diegos own Cross-Eyed Mary. Well this time, Greg Koch, erm I mean Todd Bissell a.k.a. Squire EyeChartBrew of the Hop-Burping province really parted with something special, and its very much appreciated. I always feel like the beer love comes North from San Diego way too often and is always one way  so Im glad I found a good beer recently to reciprocate with during our next collective Beer Tasting  a 1999 Alesmith Grand Cru anyone?  better start soaking the Brats and blending the Cheese BigDog.  An excellent world class Stout - Wouldnt it be great if tomorrow, for just one day, every Guinness tap around the world dispensed this. I swear Brooklyn would be inundated with requests for this Imperial Stout until their ears bled.  This was Bloody Marvelous  Many Thanks Todd!!!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Quaffer,4.12,"Bottle states, ""Winter '03 - '04."" I'm a little confused by one of the other statements on the bottle: ""Brewed and bottled by the Brooklyn Brewery, Utica, N.Y."" Utica!? What the hell?  Appearance: With some coaxing, I was able to produce a dark tan, one-finger head when I poured this viscous beer. It was jet black, and I mean jet black. The head was gone quickly, dissipating into just a few isolated patches of bubbles floating on the pure ebony liquid. There was no lacing at all.  Smell: A great smelling brew that had the very distinct odor of cocoa. Not pure chocolate, mind you, but powdered cocoa. This was strongest right after the pour, but then subsided to allow the other aromas to shine through and join in. There were the burnt smells of dark roasted malts, a sweetness that seemed to come more from the malt than the chocolate, dark bitter coffee, a light smokiness, and a hint of cream that only showed itself when the glass was agitated.  Mouthfeel: On the high-end of the medium-bodied specturm. There was quite a bit of tickle on the tongue, which surprised me, but not to the point that the beer felt rough. After I had been drinking this one for awhile, I definitely started to notice the tingle of the 8.5% alcohol.  Taste: Aside from a tart, somewhat astringent quality that pervaded the flavor from start to finish, this beer was chock full of dark malt flavors. The burnt, smoky taste of black roasted malts completely filled the mouth. I could only detect the slightest hint of chocolate malt in the mix, and that came across as dark, bitter chocolate. The finish was a continuation of the aforementioned dark malt flavors, combined with a good dose of hops. To me, the hops had an English quality to them and seemed slightly muddled in flavor.  This beer gave me the hat trick of the well-known chocolate stouts. In my mind, this beer, along with Rogue and Young's, is one of the big three chocolate stouts that permeates the American market. However, I have learned that this offering is nothing, and I repeat nothing, like the other two. While the others actually use chocolate in the brewing process, Brooklyn's is an representation of an imperial stout that uses chocolate (and other) malt only to create its flavor. Overall, a good beer, though there are other ""big"" stouts that I would rather drink.  Thanks Bruiser81!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,WVbeergeek,4.15,"Appearance: Deep black can't see any light coming through whatsoever with a nice sized tan head leaves nice even ring of lacing. Aroma: Dark roasts bring about hints of chocolate and seared fruit with alcohol notes around the edges this is a complex big imperial stout. Taste: Creamy chocolate tone quickly nulled by a streak of alcohol like a shot of liquer infused with cherries and other fruit notes this is one big beer here, nice and alluring just a bit overwhelming one glass at a time not a session by any means. Mouthfeel: Full bodied thick syrupy mouthfeel this a big stout. Drinkability: I am much more proned to a Young's Double Chocolate if I'm going after a chocolate character in my stout this one has alot more of everything alcohol, malts, and chocolate just may lack some balance with the searing alcohol burn in presents.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

There is lots of lacing left on the glass. The smell is very rich with cocoa, coffee, and caramel. A brilliant sweet aroma that fills the nose well. The taste starts with burnt malt and chocolate. Sweet, but not a bit cloying. Coffee and toffee are also present. The finish ends with a tad bit of hops. A very well balanced stout. The mouthfeel is very thick, yet silky smooth, just wonderful. The drinkability is fairly good for being 8.5%. I could sure enjoy at least a couple on this cold winter night.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,pio,4.18,"the brawney head was dark tan with a slight ruby/cranberry tinture. very foamy and staying, nicely aroused in the glass and leaving a great amount of clingy reminant lace. oh yeah and the liquid was black as anything could be. on to the great scent of this beer. hops that smell sweet like candy and candied fruit, cherries and a number of chocolate tones. milk chocolate, cocoa, creme de cacao and so on. on the taste, whoa, what alot of coco! people might think this has some coffee but it's not more than a hint, that is cocoa, dry dark chocolate. it's totally rocking and greatly dry, it just dries up the palate like mad. there are hints of cherries here on the palate as well. it's very warming and i didn't know what the abv was until now and i'm not amazed other than how well that was cloaked by chocolate on the nose and on the palate. quite a creamy mouthfeel, full bodied and very complimentary to the beer. the drinkability i rated in accordance to the idea that this is certainly a one at a time beer, a special time. i can't go putting one of these down because i feel like a beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Beer pours ebony black and as clear as a night dweller with a blindfold.  Head is low, brown-tan and gone in a flash.  Aroma is intensely roasty with an oily espresso character. that is both slick and harsh on the tongue. Nutty Chocolate tones like a broken and slighty burnt dark chocolate ganache round out the palate with just a hint of alcohol.  Flavor follows suit with a starting touch of roast and CO2.Coffee roasts start to pick up with a large molasses backing. Hard dark cocoa builds and takes over for the coffee before a final finish hop fights the remaining sweetness down.

45,680,AtLagerHeads,4.25,"The thick black body was crowned by a humongous beige head that lasted and laced with gusto. The engine oil look was matched by a feel like a very viscuous lubricant wanting to ease my pain. The smell of roasted grain and chocolate is very pronounced and the taste was a lovely blend of coffee and dark chocolate with an overlay of alcohol. Limited by its ABV, the drinkability can only be rated as moderate as this is very strong stout. Lovely, but with pronounced, muscular biceps.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Bierman9,4.5,"Mini-vertical tonight (28AUG08), with a bottle of '02-'03 and an '05-'06. Nothing different between the two with regard to appearance - both jet black and oily, with thin glass-rimming layers of tan bubbles. Both with a raisiny, portish-like nose, though the '02-'03 has more fruitiness. Older bier has gotten a bit thin, though still medium, with the younger bier having more weight on the tongue. As with the aroma, the older bier tastes a bit more fruity - dark fruit that is. Raisins, black currants, some roasty choco, with a floral hoppiness still well evident. The '05-'06 has the fruitiness as well, though a bit more restrained, with some choco notes still coming forth. Less hoppiness here, too. Quite strange, as hops tend to fade as they age. Older bier here has more florality. Still, both are tasty, though right now the '05-'06 is a bit better, overall, than the '02-'03. It's my last '02-'03 and '05-'06, so no big-time vertical, as I had suggested back in '03. NBD....  (Side-by-side on 06DEC03....) Comparing an '02-'03 vs an '03-'04.... Both biers have a great look...identical dark, oily black biers, with thin, mocha hued toppings and decent lacing... Aroma is about even in strength for both, with the '02-'03 showing more dark fruit hints, and the younger exhibiting more chocolatey aspects. Both biers are medium to full bodied, but the older bier has a smoother texture, the newer a bit more carbonation. The '02-'03 definitely shows more dark fruit flavors than this years version, though the newer has more roastiness and chocolate than the 1-year old bier, plus a smidge of bitterness. Definitely would not turn down either, but the older bier is smoother, and fruitier... Verrry nice stuff, and still $6.99/six. I will try this again next year, with an '02-'03, an '03-'04, and an '04-'05 for a 3-way vertical. Zum Wohl!!!  overall: 4.5 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | mouthfeel: 4.5 | drinkability: 4.5  *** ***  (Original review of 09FEB03). I had some of this months ago on tap at the Sunset Grille, but I never got around to reviewing it. Well, here goes, for the bottle version, vintage winter '02-'03. Poured into the glass and I thought I had a can of engine oil! Damn, how thick and black can you get? Light is completely unable to escape this black hole! The head was a deep mocha color, though thin. A miniscule layer of tightly packed bubbles does manage to layer the top of the bier, with some lacing leftover. Nose is not overly strong like some biers, yet there is a pleasing roasty quality, along with some essence of dark fruit and a bit o' hop character. This baby has my kinda mouthfeel! A body bordering on full, and a nice creamy feel on the tongue! Almost perfect... Very flavorful concoction, here! Has some big roasty attributes, with plentiful dark fruit flavors, like black currants, figs and raisins! Finish is rounded out by some floral hoppiness, with a bit of a lip-smacking dryness accompanying the aftertaste. A nicely crafted bier (especially at $6.99/six!). (4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5 = 4.5) Prosit!!  483",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Hints of ruby along the edges, oily bubbles dancing along the top. Plenty of aroamas of rum soaked raisans, plums, figs, and burnt fruit along a super bitter base. Taste is nice and rummy, lots of roasted fruit flavors. Chocolate taste is subtle not up front, but I think alot of that flavor has settled maybe in nearly 2 years. Plenty of Imperial Stout flavors, well balanced and burnt bitterness finishes up. Medium to full bodied, well carbonated as well.

Black patent and chocolate malt aromas, together with coffee and toffee and other smoky and burnt aromas make for one tantalizingly smooth smelling stout. Big, big, big malt taste with a nice balance of hops in there, too. Heavy on the chocolate malt, finishing with a bitter malt tartness and a touch of fruitiness. As thick as used motor oil, yet to me maintains a certain drinkability despite it's beefy ABV.

45,680,Starchild,4.4,"03-04 Winter Edition.  Brooklyn pours impenetrable black with a nice tan foam head. I smell some alcohol, some chocolate, and some toasted malt. Smells like an imperial, which of course is not very descriptive. First sips, revel big bold silky texture of chocolate masking alcohol underneath. Alcohol dominates the flavor, but is not unbearable. Its almost a shame to review such a new imperial. I bought a case, so Ill do another review at 6 and 12 months. Hell, maybe every two months because I sure love this stuff. As my beer sinks, the tan foam clings in the side of my pint. Mid-pint I start to taste the slightly bitter chocolate against the crisp malt backbone. For some reason, the taste brings me back to Hair of the Dogs Adam maybe due its complex flavor. This is truly a fantastic winter warmer. Why do people drink warmed brandy.they should be having Black Chocolate Stout. For such a young imperial, Im impressed; the chocolate sure helps a lot with the flavor. In six months Ill be blown away. The alcohol reveals itself in the last sips of this beer, but isnt that always the case with imperials.

45,680,mschofield,4.62,"'03-'04 bottling The aroma is chocolate and coffee, and it's strong it hit my nose as I poured in into a glass at least 2 feet from my nose. Dark opaque black with a small head the color of lightened coffee. Black chocolate is right... coffee comes out in the aroma as it warms, and there is a little bit of chocolate covered fruit. These secondary flavors are hitting me as cafe mocha, and chocolate dipped oranges. The bitterness folds perfectly into the chocolate taste and aroma, perfectly integrated. It's like a liquid chocolate cake. Full and creamy. I've had better Imperial Stouts, but this one captures the black chocolate name wonderfully. Drinkability is a double-edged sword - yes it's easy to drink, but with the high abv you can't drink many.

45,680,WaltTrombone,4.6,"'02-'03 Bottling  I had purchased a few of these back in March, and back then thought it was a bit harsh. Now, after sitting in the basement for 8 months, I decided to crack one open, and was amazed at the transformation.  It poured a deep, inky BLACK (Naturally!), with a fluffy, medium brown head. The aromas were chocolate and espresso, and the taste was sublime! Chocolate, espresso, prune, port, grapefruit, with lots of wispy lace. The mouthfeel was smooth and medium creamy. It finished with espresso and citrus, with a hint of cocoa powder.  OUTSTANDING!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,byrd,3.82,"03-04 Bottling , Sampled Nov, 2003: Small dark tan head of small bubbles that reduce pretty quickly to a thin lace. Solid black in color. Not an overpowering aroma, but good. Nose is slightly sweet with roasted notes and chocolate. Some slight sweet notes of currant may also be intermingled on the nose. Short slight sweetness in the start with a slight currant fruitiness. Very deep roasted and coffee notes quickly take over the palate. Bitter chocolate and hops finish and linger for a long period. The roasted notes are very strong, even leaning towards the burnt end of the spectrum. Theres a slight warming sensation. Good brew, but this one is a bit harsh for me at this young age. Smooth is definitely not in this beers profile right now, and its not quite as drinkable as I expected.  I wasnt nearly as impressed with this one as most folks usually seem to be. Ive had a few of these now, and always come to the same conclusion. Good brew, but it just doesnt knock my socks off. Ill take a Samuel Smith Imperial Stout, Storm King, or even an Old Rasputin over this brew any day of the week. I've set a few of these aside to age until next winter. With a year of aging under their belt, I may come to a very different conclusion in the future.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Aromas of chocolate and coffee. Flavor lets me down. Not as big and bold as other imperial stouts. It's good, but several notches from being the best. Lots of velvety chocolate in the flavor. Mix in some espresso and some bitter hops. No alcohol noted. Nice bittersweet flavor at the end. Some smoky flavor as well. Interestingly, the sourness I detected from the tap version is not as present. Still a great sipper. Curl up by the fire and grab a book.

45,680,jed,4.58,"Appearance: Pours jet black with a creamy brown head w/lace that sticks around.  Smell: Chocolate, a little bit of coffee. You can also catch a whiff of the alcohol, but nothing overpowering.  Taste: One of the best stouts I've had. Initial bittersweet chocolate with some hop bitterness, gets sweeter and sweeter as it warms without becoming cloyingly so. Nice malty aftertaste with a hint of fruit. As I got to the end of the pint I started to taste the alcohol, but again, not enough to be come unpleasant.  Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Nice and smooth with light carbonation. While this isn't incredibly heavy, I couldn't see drinking more than two or three of these  the 8.5% alcohol will catch up quickly.  Kudos to the Brooklyn Brewery for creating an immensely drinkable chocolate stout. While this isn't quite as good as the Rouge Chocolate Stout I sampled, at $6.99/six pack it's probably the most affordable brew in the BA Top 50. I plan to buy a case to cellar.

The taste starts off malty sweet with a strong chocolate component, followed quickly by a hit of roasted malt and an alcohol warmth. It finishes with an almost harsh bitterness, which suggests most strongly to me that this beer is young. This brew seems to be a bit heavier in the alcohol department, and I'm guessing that a bit of aging will help it immensely.

45,680,aaronh,3.5,"Winter '01-'02 bottling. Essentially a black beer with mahogany highlights, it pours with a syrupy sound, a velvety look, and a toffee colored head. The head fades quickly, and leaves a mild lace on the glass. The aromas are chocolate, roasted malt, with some bourbon overtones. There are also vanilla notes and and some spiciness. Absolutely a treat. The first sip coats the tongue with a luxurious silky feeling. This beer is incredibly smooth, exactly what my ideal stout would feel like. The taste is heavy on the roated malts, with a strong chocolate note and some nice peat smokiness. For 8.5% ABV, the alcohol is not noticable. Some fruity sweetness creeps in on the finish, and the hops are present, but not overpowering. They simply present a nice bitterness on the finish, which is remarkably clean considering how thick this beer feels. This is definitely one of my favorite brews.  Don't see my notes on the '02-'03, but it was equally impressive as the previous year.  Ratings at this point: 4.5 - 5.0 - 4.5 - 5.0 - 4.5  '03-'04 version:  Still looks great, smells pretty good.  The taste is a huge let down. Taste has a strange ""moldy grain"" component. And as ithaca baron intimated, a bit of a burnt tobacco note on the finish.

45,680,ithacabaron,3.11,"'03 bottling.  This pours the color of burnt oil that's been let out of an old engine during a change -- slick, deep, rich and black, black, black. The head settles comfortably on top with fairly large bubbles, and swirled, multi-toned highlights.  Smell is pretty good as well, with aromas of dark, burnt candi sugar and burnt chocolate...very rich, even in smell.  Unfortunately, for me, that's where this fell apart for me. The stout has good dark chocolate flavor through it, but the chocolate seems a bit chalky, and dry, instead of smooth, as if it were made with chocolate baking powder. Additionally, the aftertaste is one of ashed cigar...not wholly bad, and an aquired taste, but, in my mind, not a positive for the beer by any means.  Mouthfeel is very rich and smooth, with a drying end, well fitted to the style.  Due to the tasting notes, I can't give this a real high drinkability rating.  Incidentally, just 12oz. of this stuff got me buzzed. Should be noted.  One important note...I tasted this, and then, noting the similarities, cracked open an extract chocolate stout I had homebrewed, using some adjuncts and malto-dextrine...I could barely tell the difference -- knowing what was in my beer, and the fact that I can replicate it for a fraction of the cost with low-grade ingredients, how can I give this a really great grade?  Anyway, maybe I got a bad bottle, or maybe I missed something with this one. I'll probably try it again for that reason, and I encourage others to give this at least one try -- they might like it a lot more than I did.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,philipt,4.57,"My brother's favorite beer...who can blame him?  This is one of the best imperial stouts available. It pours with a smallish head and minimal lacing. The beer itself is black. I cannot find any reddish tint to this beer. Good start. The aroma is incredible. Perfectly roasted malt, subtle coffee/expresso, and hints of chocolate stand out in the aroma. There is an initial burnt, but nice malt flavor. It is borderline bitter, but before it one really focuses on the burnt flavor there is a burst of sweet malt and chocolate. Perfectly balanced. I cannot imagine a better balance between chocolate and traditional malt.  I am stocking up on this beer. I doubt I can wait Spring through Fall for this one again.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,skar,4.15,"Foreword: 12 oz bottle - Limited Edition '03-'04 - Serving at proper temp  Appearance/Head: Very dark color, rather opaque. The head was a nice ebony, but I was disappointed by how little head there was until I started pouring from a foot above the glass.  Aroma: Dark roasted malts, mocha, with a bit of dark fruits.  Taste: It started with a very nice, rich creamy head. It is a full bodied elixir with a bittersweet cocoa flavor. The aftertaste has some nice burnt taste and perhaps a late sourness. I would have guess the abv at around 6.5 instead of 8.5 .  Bottom line: A nice beer from Brooklyn that I'm sure I will enjoy many times this winter. The flavors are a little light for an Imperial Stout, and I think there are a number of better examples out there.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,DagFishHead,4.85,"2003 edition... if fall has to be here already, at least we get to enjoy all of the great brews that come with it. I must confess that this is the beer that ""converted"" me to micros...  Appearance is gorgeous. Jet black, luscious, almost viscous looking pour of melted dark chocolate. Impressive, amazingly dark brown head (probably looks better from a tap...can't wait to find out). Big malt, clearly chocolate and mocha nose. Hop aroma is subdued. Some nose tingle from the alcohol. Taste is ""truly"" exceptional. For me the taste and mouthfeel are a single entity with experiencing this brew. I love the simultaneous carbonation/alcohol tingle that carries a creamy, lush, slick, smooth and slightly sweet blend of malt and chocolate. Served at the correct temperature, the interplay of flavors is a near religious experience. Drinkability: This IS Imperial Stout! To me, you save your ""5"" ratings for the very, VERY few that are truly stunning... this brew rates.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,grynder33,4.21,"I heard so much about it, impossible to pick up in Wisconsin, finally got it over the internet. Color was sinnfully black, the aroma was chocolately malty, but not very bold, then POW, the heavy chewy dark chocolate taste, nice roasted chocolate malt aftertaste, seemed to get a little sweeter as it warmed, and a lot creamier texture.Just wish Mr. Oliver would not make this wonderful stuff so hard to get.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,BierReise,4.14,Finally got a chance to sample this thanks to a trade. Limited bottling '03-'04. Dark as night with maybe a tinge of garnet at the edges while held up to bright light. An inch of tan head is settling down quickly. Sensational aroma of bitter sweet chocolate and roasted malts with a hint of licorice. Creamy and delicate mouthfeel. Flavor is definitely semi-sweet chocolate with a dry finish. This is a very nice stout and deserved of its praise.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,silks636,4,"Poured from 12 oz. brown bottle. 02-03 batch. This one sat for a year and I cant wait anymore...  Thick syrupy black in hue with a slight foamy mahogany head. Lacing in large sheets. Nose is all dark chocolate with traces of alcohol (rum?) soaked fruit. A mellow burnt coffee aroma present as well. A sip of this almost knocks you over. Heavy creamy mouthfeel and smooth as silk. Heavy unsweetened chocolate up front with overtones of alcohol and plum. Some bitter hops are detected but very understated. The unsweetened chocolate continues with light roasted coffee flavors. The alcohol seems to vanish and the burnt chocolate charcoal aftertaste kicks in. A peppery twang hits momentarily at the finish.  A gorgeous stout. Very tasty, heavy, and warming. One best enjoyed as a dessert brew. Since this one packs such serious flavors, I probably could not drink more than one at a sitting. Best at cellar temperature. Laying this one down for a year or so is definitely the way to go - if you can resist the temptation!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,HonestWeightBeer,4.2,"03-04 batch.  Poured a deep inky black with a huge deep tan/brown craggy ead with good stickage. The scent is chocolate malt with roasted grain , slight fruit sweetness, alcoholic noted. Taste is roasted malts, heavy on the chocolate finish. Lesser hop presence, warming alcohol in the belly. Mouth is smooth, medium full to full bodied, chewy, sticking to the palate, light to medium carbonation. Very drinkable for its style, high abv, means you aren't likely to go overboard. Quite tasty, for dessert, or with dessert.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ecoboy,4.16,"I am pretty sure the Atkins diet lot would run screaming at the first taste of this beer. A dessert stout from a man who knows his food pairings. Drinkability issues fly out the window with such a rich end-of-night concoction such as this.  Big firm plush head, one of the most impressive I have ever seen. Opaque black hue as expected.  What was both unexpected and impressive: the fruity esters and notes: with the dominant chocolate and creamy cappucino notes came banana and black cherry with a touch of sour. The touch of sour replaces the bittering in the balance equation.  Roasty sweet carbs. Heavenly for those who want their cake and drink it, too. Thanks to pournutha1 for the sample.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Stubbie1,4.85,"03-04 bottling. This is one beautiful stout. It pours a dark black color with a dark brown head on top. The head stays for a spell and slowly gives way to a thin sticky lace. The aroma is of burnt coffee, deep roasted malt and a slight sweetness in the air. There is also a faint wisp of alcohol roaming around. The taste is wonderful; Deep roasted malt combined with the coffee and the hints of sweetness (plum, raisin?) attack the tongue. There is a slight warming of the lips with a slight presence of the alcohol. Also present is a smooth creamy feeling in the mouth. It is a very enjoyable and defiantly easy to drink. I need to get more before it is all gone!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,edchicma,4.28,"Dark, almost black with beautiful creamy brown head. Smells of malt, smoke and alcohol...nicely blended. Taste is strong on alcohol, but tempered well with a nice malty, chocolate-smoky flavor. Mouthfeel was good, but high alcohol content reminded you to sip. For a high abv, extremely drinkable....a definite strong stout all should try.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,yankeeheel,4.6,"There is a reason this is a top rated beer. It is everything a big, strong, imperial stout should be. Pours as black as possible with a huge cascading espresso colored head. Served at a lovely 65 degrees. 03-04 vintage.  Smells of chocolate, smoke, malts, chocolate, figs, chocolate....you get the idea. The taste is something to behold. Just a massive attack of dark burnt malt, creamy chocolate, oak, and alcohol. Hopped up like crazy but it works with all the dark stuff going on. I equate the taste to the realm of a single malt scotch. It should be sipped, savored, and revered.  Just incredible. The other 5 of these lovelys are going to the cellar for a while. Thanks to JahNoth for the hookup.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ViveLaChouffe,4.26,"12oz bottle, the remnant of a case I picked up in Eastern PA in mid-February 2003.  This is more like it...  Pitch black. Pours a thick brown head that quickly swells to 2 inches and then recedes to 1/4 inch. Lacing is evident.  Aroma is complex. Nutty and chocolatey, bitter and sweet. Hint of bananas and cream.  Taste lives up to the smell. Sweet nutty chocolate gives way to bitter roasted malt. Hint of nutmeg. Big beer. Lingers on the back of the tongue. One of the better stouts I have tasted.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,cokes,3.53,"'02-'03  Dark, muddy brown bordering on blackness. Good sized tan froth on top. Roasy, mocha nose. Not quite Imperial, but good nonetheless. Flavor is full, but somewhat limited, breadth-wise. Chocolate hits up front, then stays away. Roasty twags of Black malt appear. Just minor suggestions of the burnt dark fruits and anise that I adore in the style. Turns woodier and nuttier late. Just enough green-ish hops for dryness. Well-structured body, but could use some additional heft. Not an overly complex Imperial, but a nice stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,hyuga,4.83,"Thick coffee black with an equally thick cocoa brown head. Heavy roasted overtones mixed with the perfect amount of chocolate sweetness in the aroma. Very thick and creamy in your mouth, as it should be. Heavily roasted and chocolaty sweet at the same time. Hops are present, leaving a leafy aftertaste near the back. Extremely enjoyable beer, very highly recommended. A different take on the style, but right up there with the best of them. Thanks again to francisweizen for this and the other Brooklyn brews!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Ellbert,4.56,Appearance: Wonderful dark brown/black color that I look for in an Imperials Stout. Wonderful brown head that is huge and settles after a while to a nice layer on the brew. It sticks to the glass like no ones buisiness.  Smell: Very caremelly and alcoholic. Can smell roasted chocolate and coffee.  Taste: Very complex. Same taste as the smell with more roastiness and chocolate. Alcohol lingers in the background to give you a sublte spicy bite at the end of your taste.  Mouthfeel: Exceptional. It is nice and thick and has a wonderful consitency. Not too suryp like. Nice carbonation breaking throught the thickness.  Drinkability: This is unusually drinkable. The 8.5% will knock your socks off if you have a few but you don't notice it much when you drink it. This is dangerously delicious and drinkable.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,beerinator,4.05,"Appearance- BLACK, creamy brown head.  Aroma- Sweet coffee bean smell, with a slightly burnt aroma. Like cold coffee beans.  Taste- Strong alcohol up front. Cold coffee taste, smoky. Full body, with slight lingering bitterness.  Notes- Great beer for coffee lovers who have healthy livers. Not a beer for session drinking. I could see myself enjoying this with a nice bowl of Breyer's Vanilla Ice Cream.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Coffee and toffee, anise, plums and cherries flavors, but it really chocolaty. Some hop bite. Very nice stout. Well balanced. Smooth and roasty. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,TheDM,3.64,This brew pours an opaque black colored body with a large creamy head. It had a strong coffee aroma. It also had a strong alcohol flavor with strong coffee notes. I am hoping the chocolate referred to the color and not the flavor because I did not get any chocolate in the flavor.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,SlowTwitch,4.43,"This is not a dark beer, this is a BLACK beer. This stygian brew had a very interesting head that at first appeared to be a rust color, but slowly transformed into a creamy walnut color as I continued to pour. I was amazed at how dark this beer actually is. It is almost completely aphotic when held to a light. Perhaps the best embodiment of a stout that I have ever seen.  This beer has a subtly spicy smell, dominated by chocolate (obviously) and coffee. A powerful scent that was noticed (positively) by other drinkers sitting nearby.  It clings stubbornly to the side of the glass when swirled, not quite like a New England Maple Syrup would be, but close enough where the ebony color is still easily noticeable when the glass is placed down again.  This beer is more like a food than a beverage. The chocolate flavor melts into a molasses type taste and mouthfeel, with a very mild hopiness to balance out the forceful, yet not overdone, roasted malt. I can taste what I can only identify as the ever so carefully blackened exterior of a steak in the malt. I am left with a continued flavor of spicy molasses after finishing this mouthful of beer. An experience not unlike eating a rich, moist piece of chocolate cake.  This is a beer best enjoyed in limited quantities. It is a complex beer that lingers pleasantly and can be enjoyed long after having been swallowed. Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is not really a thirst quenching beer, but could be easily used as a meal or dessert unto itself.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,euskera,4.67,"This brew is a choc-o-holics delight. The chocolate malts are intense and delicious. Explodes on the palate to deliver a smoky, malty mouthfeel that is exquisite. Just enough alcohol in the back to perk up the taste buds, but not too much. Hops are well defined, but not too spicy. Bravo..",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Stingray5,4.28,"12oz, winter '02 - '03. Poured blacker than black with a huge, long lasting tan head. Grassy, earthy aromas are complimented by bitter chocolate and fruity malt. Thick, low carbonated mouthful is followed by sticky sweet malt heaven. Slight port qualities. Hints of prunes. Finish is dry with an alcohol warmth that feels even bigger that its 8.5%, and a long lasting bitterness. This here's a STOUT, baby. I put 3 in the cellar, we'll see how it is in a year or two.  '03-'04  Much like last year's, but I think it needs a little more time to mellow. Very hi-octane in the alcohol, and the bitter chocolate notes aren't as defined. Yet...",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,steelreign,4.83,"Wow, this is one of the finest representatives of this style available! The beer pours black as night, and a smallish, coffee and roasted malt smelling caramel head ensues and then dissipates quickly. Malt, malt and more malt!! Simply unreal flavor overwhelms the mouth, bursting with chocolate and all things roasted, malty goodness. The finish is all malt with a slight hop kick. Not bitter in the least. Just a sumptuous mouthfeel, and the drinkablilty is supreme with this one, although just make sure you aren't driving after a few of these! I will absolutely seek this out again (and again...).",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,rastaman,4.43,"A nice one. Lots of chocolatey roasty malts. The palate is bittersweet, with some sweet chocolate at the start and then a bitter roasty, almost ashy finish.

45,680,mike1290,4.58,"Luckily I work in Brooklyn so that I can stock up on this brew when it's released. Pours black as night and as the name suggests. Smell is of chocolate (obviously), coffee and also a slight fruity edge. Medium consistency made thicker by extreme chilling. At first the taste is quite overpowering and may turn off most people. Extreme chocolate and roasted flavors with a sweet alcohol laden finish. Realistically you can only drink 2, maybe three max in one sitting due to the severe character. Good choice.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,MJR,4.45,"An Imperial stout for lunch in June? Why not...  Winter '02-'03 Bottling...  Appearance: Pours a deep black that has a hint of brown when held up to a strong light. A reverse cascading effect gives way to a thick, brown head that slowly shrinks to a thin cap. A quick swirl brings it up again. Great lacing on the side of the glass.  Smell: Small hints of alcohol and diacetyl hide undeneath a massive blanket of roasted malts and chocolate. The aroma is extremely rich with the usual dose of dark fruits, but they take a backseat to the chocolate malts. Hops are practically nonexistent in the nose of this beer.  Taste: The flavor is extremely rich and creamy with hefty doses of chocolate and roasted malts. The alcohol is present from the first sip to the last swallow, but it doesn't really take the attention away from the grains. It merely provides a warming undercurrent and base for this brew to work it's magic. There's the usual assortment of burnt dark fruits: plum, raison, and black currant. There's a slight hop bitterness, but little-to-no aroma or flavor. Finishes with a burst of warming alcohol, which makes it seem like it's more than 8.5%abv.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and rich on the tongue, but a touch thinner than some of the other Imperials it's compared to. Still, there's a nice chewy quality that makes me delay each swallow as long as I can. Finishes with a blast of mouth-drying alcohol.  Drinkability: This is quite the drinkability Imperial stout. I would say that the slight thinness of body makes it more drinkable than some others, but the alcoholic flavor and mouthfeel give the impression of a stronger brew, so they sorta cancel each other out. It's a shame this brew isn't available in the Midwest, 'cause it's a damn good brew...  A big 'thank you' goes out to pbrian for sending me a few of these.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,purplehops,4.33,"2002 Vintage Black Chocolate Stout pours like it's name, opaque chocolate black with a brown frothy head that leaves a nice lace on the glass. The aroma is mocha latte with a dash of port wine and a hint of toasted grain. Taste starts with plenty of mocha and coffee flavors upfront and then moves on to include flavors of raisins, black malt, toasted grain and alcohol. The finish is smooth with toffee and dried fruits flavors played off against bitter black malt and the first hint of floral and citrus hops. Aftertaste is a pleasant lingering mocha flavor with just a hint of hop and roasted grain. Mouthfeel is creamy with warmth and attitude along with a medium-heavy body. Overall a very complex and enjoyable chocolate stout. It's big, it's full, it's rich, and it will put a smile on your face. My only change would be to pull back just a bit on the black malt and roasted barley to give the chocolate malts a wee bit more control of the flavor profile. Not enough to make it sweet like a milk stout mind you but just enough to round off the astringent edge. But now I'm just being picky.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,tavernjef,4.65,"Dark brown as it pours but settles solid black in the glass with a pencil width high head of tight creamy foam of light leathery brown color, much like light chocolate, which is fitting for this stout. Some strings and spots of lace. Smell is nose smacking gorgeous goodness of very sweet and rich chocolate with a nice dark fruit mixing in there of bananas, dark cherries, and starfruit. One great whiffer! Taste is more scruptious sweet chocolate, moderately twinged and tanged at first, a bit hefty and dark, touch of burntness, smooths out leaving traces of dark fruits and a super nice thick luscious drying sense. Some sweet tingly senses introduced as well in this flavor packed punch of a stout. Its not to complex, but its fulfilling in a simple sense and tone. Rockin' good! Feel is pretty heavy and full, lightly sweet hold at the start, goes smooth, creamy, and boldly drying and tingly into the finish. This is a supurb stout and highly enjoyable and I recommend it highly. I am very, very unlucky though, as it is not available here in Minnesota. Hopefully it will cross over the Mississippi some day soon, really soon. Those of you who can readily pick this stuff up, you don't know how lucky you are. Awesome stuff!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Brent,4.18,"Poured pitch black with a mocha-colored froth, like motor oil with 200,000 miles since the last change. Softly sweet chocolate malt aroma. Assertive dark-roasted malt bitterness jumps immediately to the back of the tongue - concentrated, cooked-down chocolate, coffee, prune and charcoal flavors dominate. Alcohol actually breaks things up a bit and the finish softens with a slight sourness. A well crafted imperial stout that could easily be raw, but manages to integrate the concentrated flavors quite nicely.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,GreatPondBrewer,3.7,The color of Black Chocolate Stout was similar to what I imagine the night sky would bleed. It had a huge frothy head and there is lace that is still sticking to the top of my glass. It smelled big and malty with some serious sweet aromas. The taste was like slowly mulled chocolate with a tad bit of bitterness to contrast the sweet caramel and chocolate taste although there was not too much in the way of coffee tastes. Overall a very drinkable stout especially for its high alcohol content.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Maestro,4.48,"This beer is the best stout I have had in a long time. The nose is quite tame but the hops and roasted malts come through. The head is two fingers that fades to less than one finger and lasts throughout the beer. The first taste is quite malty and has some sweet notes that almost allude to a milk stout. The faintest bit of chocolate is present alongside a coffe taste. The alcohol is disguised by the big flavors in this beer. It is hard to believe that she clocks in at 8.5% As you move through the beer there is a chewy, bread characteristic to the beer. A nice lacing is left on the pint glass and it retains the rich tan color from the head. The carbonation is perfect for this beer. As you get to the end of the pint the hops start to show through with a drying bite and the alcohol starts to warm your belly. This is definitely not a stout for the faint at heart. In fact, I think this is the best imperial stout I have ever had. And it makes a great 50th review.  P.S. Finishes quite smoothly.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,marc77,4.3,"Utterly absorbent pitch black. Uniform dark russet head settles into a taut layer that leaves sparse, lazy foam trails. Robust, enveloping combination of chocolate malt, smooth, warm, licorice laced alcohol and mellow dark caramel malt nearly saturates the nose. The aroma mellows slightly, allowing both light diacetyl, pruneish dark fruit and molasses to surface and add additional depth. Enticingly complex aromawise. Snap of date like sweetness in flavor is hastily tapered by a concomitant barrage of assertive hop bitterness and deeply burnt, carbonaceous roasted barley. Hints of tart, smokey black malt emerge along with pronounced, yet well rounded cocoaish chocolate mid palate. Subdued citric hop character merges with the pruneish undertone after a long deliberation brightening the overall character late. Fairly well attenuated, with a mouthfeel a notch shy of dextrinous and full. Finishes surprisingly clean, with mild notes of molasses and milk chocolate dried abrupty by clean roasted unmalted barley. Although it lacks the complexity and brute malt character of some other imperials, Black Chocolate possesses unique finesse and superlative drinkability. Worthy of cellaring. Delicious!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,marburg,4.15,"Blacker than the sight of a rural midnight from under a blindfold. Big brown head. Very aromatic -- chocolate, coffee beans, and black cherries with a light hint of alcohol.

A very tasty beer but definitely not one I could consume in mass quantities.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,dmarch,4.68,"What a gorgeous beer this is. Pours dark black with a big tan head. Looks like a stout should. I think the word chocolate might through some people off. In fact, I remember a Michael Jackson book that mentioned this achieving it's chocolatey taste with the use of malts. So I don't believe this actually contains chocolate. The aroma is a lot roastier and robust than expected. This is a stout that I expected to be sweet, but the taste is a more dry chocolate taste. I personally would not consider comparing this to Young's Double Chocolate Stout. Although they have similar names, this is a very different beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,longpondbeerman,4.25,"Pours like the label says: deep and dark--read: black. There a light chocolate brown head and negligible lace after all is said and done. The smell is a little like soy sauce with a hint of hoppy chocolate. The taste was definitely better than the smell--a good, intricately thick imperial stout robustness with a backdrop of musty, hard chocolate. A bit sweet for me on the aftertaste. I like this winter seasonal, though it is not one of my all time favorites.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Darkale,4.23,"I have heard so much about this beer, and was finally able to get my hands on a single at one of my beer shopping haunts.  Pours like oil out of a crankcase. Like all good thick stouts the head does not form as much as it emerges, almost having to wriggle up through the viscous black body of the beer. Very little light passes through this beer, and the head is a gorgeous cappuccino brown that lingers with good lacing.  Aroma is slightly malty, with nuts and sweet chocolate.  Round, chewy, creamy and bittersweet mouthfeel. This is one beer that you will be tempted to chew for several minutes. Incredible mouthfeel.  Full chocolate taste, sparkly and delicious.  Not the kind of beer that you could have several of, but a wonderful imperial stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

45,680,feloniousmonk,4.72,"In a taste test by a panel of experts (me, myself, and I) between 3 ""chocolate stouts"", Young's came on top as the chocolatiest, but this mamma jamma was deemed the superior stout! Rich mocha flavor wafts out of the bottleneck from the moment the cap snaps off! Oh, this is going to be good! The color is as black as strap molasses, with a rich bubbling, simmering, dark brown, puddingish head. THIS is STOUT! Already, it seems like a glass of melted chocolate! Aroma is gorgeous! Sublime! Soft, creamy, yet intense with cocoa, like sticking your face deep into a bag of the stuff, but still, somehow, subtle. Mouthfeel is powerful, thick, viscous, chewy. When people speak of smoothness as a supreme adjective for any sort of beverage, I reply that I like roughness now and then. (I am, after all, the inventor of The Gilded Platypus, a cocktail contrived of tequila, Yukon Jack, Irish Mist, and sweet vermouth!) This is what I'm talking about! There are several hurdles for the palate to play with, little bites and burps and gurgles, all the things that make beer drinking my favorite hobby. Many flavors mingle in the mouth, many associations gather in the mind, but largely the feeling is of a burnt cognac, a hot dark rum, and licoriceleatherespressoetceterainto infinity... Many waves crash again and again on the palate, many happy moments occur as the rough dealings of the day are forgotten and I am lost in this wondrous, darkly beautiful, and frankly ass-kickin' stout!

45,680,SamuraiJack,4.2,"Thanks to Fishbone, I get to write a review of an old favorite of mine. For a long time, this was my benchmark for American Imperial Stouts. Now that I've tried more stouts - and in particular some of the West Coast Imperials and Chocolates - I have to say that I don't know if I would categorize this beer as a true ""Imperial"" (though it's also not a traditional Chocolate Stout either). It, like the Storm King Stout, is its own beast. And, again like the Storm King, what a phenomonal beast it is!!! In this case, the bottle was from the Winter '02/'03 batch. It's still a bit raw, and should improve over the next six months. The initial pour shows a enormous tan and creamy head on top of beer of the deepest and darkest black. The head slowly diminishes to a quite thick and sticky lace. Aromas are of malted chocolate balls, toasty grain, alcohol and a hint of espresso. As good as the appearance is, the smell may even be better. Initial tastes are sweet and chocolaty - a rich almost ""fudge-like"" flavor that could be cloying in some beers, but is balanced by the crisp (and somewhat unexpected) carbonation, alcohol bite and the slight undercurrent of hops. The finish is of a tart and nearly bitter chocolate-malt that is dry and lingers seemingly forever. This is a great stout. Like the Storm King, I don't imagine anyone seeing it as a session beer. But as a treat - this is a wonderful one.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Denali,2.67,Package: 12-ounce bottle. Winter 2002-2003 vintage.  Appearance: Looks like black mud as it pours out of the bottle. Thick. Black. Thick tan head. So thick not even Superman can see through this beer.  Smell: Strong alcohol and chocolate aroma. Somewhat bready as well.  Taste: Very bitter and alcohol flavor up front. Tangy almost lemon-like zesty flavor is also present. There is an odd flavor that is present in the middle of the flavor timeline that I do not like but I cant quite identify what it is. I just dont like how it mixes with the other flavors. Chocolate malt flavor is also present. Roasted and burnt espresso aftertaste. Strong hop bitterness also present in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Thick and extremely chewy.  Drinkability: Super strong bitterness and alcohol flavor detracts from the drinkability.  Comments: For me it was not as good as it looked. I enjoyed the chocolate malt and espresso flavors but that odd flavor is just not my thing. Thank you Keith (stegmakk) for the bottle.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Running4beer,4.58,"12 oz longneck bottle, Limited ""Winter '02-'03""  Pitch black pour with a brown medium whipped head that diminishes rather quickly to a thin lacey layer. Aroma of dark chocolate, espresso and some alcohol. Tastes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee/espresso, light raison and some alcohol make this beer. Light carbonation and a smooth creamy mouthfeel along with its diverse flavors make this a good beer to savor and drink.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,UncleJimbo,4.11,"Sampled on tap at Redbones.  This stout poured black with good, light brown foam that left a coat down the glass. The smell was very modest: caramel malt. The taste was dominated by burnt, roasted malt, but there was some sweetness and some bitter chocolate taste coming through, especially as the beer warmed. The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth with modest carbonation, and a sweetish aftertaste. The drinkability was good.  After having just tasted this beer from a bottle, I was very anxious to sample it on tap (assuming it would be even better), but unfortunately, this is one case where the bottle was better. After talking to some people, I have heard that there are consistency problems with this beer, and perhaps I got a very good bottled batch, and an average keg batch.  Anyway, it was still good, just not as good as the bottle.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,nomad,4.5,"Black as night. Very small head accumulated, but some stuck around. The toffee colored head gave way to very thin lace. Nose was a smoky coffee with bits of dark chocolate. You might smell the alcohol at first, with a light fruit and phenolic backgroun. Hard to not say this but this beer is somewhere in the range of a doppelbock, because I detected an ounce of that wheaty but fruity type of roast profile. Indeed after an opening and a swirl or two the fruitiness of the hops comes through, as well as on the tongue.  First hit of taste was a creaminess in taste and texture, and then begins with dark chocolate and ends with coffee. A chalky bitterness at first, then you taste more of a fruit behind the bitterness, as well as the high alcohol. Had a long finish that (incessantly) turned me back to the chocolate taste and smoky, fruity, earthy coffee nose the first taste began with, all of which was supported by the bitterness in the back mouth.  You can feel the warmth in your stomach. The malts are so nicely roasted: enough to impart dark chocolate color and dark chocolate esters, but delicately enough to make a mature taste that is not too chocolatey. Good use of classic and current hops (East Kent Goldings, Cascade, Willamette) to undergird it all and not make it an overly malt experience (they do use 6 different malts). It may be becoming a larger production beer due to Matt, but that nose and long and complex stout experience is something to behold and enjoy every winter  sounds redundant, but eat some dark chocolate with it, like sno-caps, I'm serious!!!  After many sessions with this beer, lemme tell ya: let this one open up in a snifter, and swirl it around  a great way to end a colder day.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,cretemixer,4.13,"Thanks to francisweizen for this offering from Brooklyn. Pours pitch black with a honey colored head. The head settles pretty quickly to a thin layer after a few minutes. Aroma is all chocolate malt, well almost. I smell dark fruit and alcohol too. Flavor has coffee notes and a nuttiness too. Bitter chocolate quality that is complimented by the sweet fruits. Very solid, well balanced stout. Nice alcohol warmth and a lingering bitter finish. Nice full bodied beer with a good carbonation level. One very drinkable Imperial. Thanks again Francis.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92

Black,black and more black, dark brown head and a nice complex aroma profile of espresso,ripe fruit,raisins and cocoa.It has a nice creamy smooth medium body that holds a combo of bitter chocolate and fresh roasted coffee and a nice acidity in the finish.It doesn't have an especially long finish or real complex flavor profile but a strong roasted stout that is very good.And for a imperial, very drinkable.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,rotsaruch,3.78,"Vintage 2002-2003. Pours about as black as moonless, cloudy nite at sea. A pronouced tan head that quickly vanishes, but with linger lacing. A burnt malt aroma is quite noticable. Not suprisingly, the a chocolate and coffee flavor dominates the palate. However, I was disappointed with body and bite of this brew. There appeared to be sourness or acidic finish. May be this brew could benefit with some aging.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,HopheadEd,4.25,"An ' 02-' 03 version, this beer poured a pitch black color and the dark brown head bubbled and faded up the glass like a Guiness! Nice! Chocolates obviously overwhelm the nose as well as roasted malts. The first taste is that of chocolate but some coffee and smokey malts follow. Creamy, creamy mouthfeel that is silky smooth on the tongue, easy going down and very drinkable. Only wish I had more than two. Very nice beer from Brooklyn, which redeemed the last offering, as I know they have great beers.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,far333,4.14,"Pours into the glass inky dark, almost black. Thin head is dark dark brown, and dissipates quickly. The taste is intense, more like coffee than chocolate. It tastes nearly as strong as their Monster barleywine. This is not a session beer. The taste can be overwhelming to the palate, and two or three bottles will have an impact on your brain. Excellent beer, deep intense flavor. This is a great contribution from the guys in the historic brewery area in Brooklyn.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,HossMcGraw,4.72,"Finally I've developed a taste for this beer. I've got the 00-01 season and it is the most enormous beer I've ever had. I'd imagine that there are not too many beers that rival this as far as thickness and maltiness is concerned. It appears as if you're pouring black paint into a pint glass. It is so unbelievably thick. The smell of dark roasted malts and raisins is the best part of this beer for me although the taste is pretty bomb too. Similar malt and raisin notes here with a nice hop balance and hints of dark chocolate. Aftertaste will leave you wanting to drink three or four more of these, brush your teeth, and then pass out from the high ABV, which I'm about to do right now. This is the ultimate beer for a cold winter night.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,JohnnyDuvel,4.35,"This is as well balanced a stout as you will ever have. It is good in every way. Not too sweet or chocolaty, not overly hoppy or malty. Nice taste. Pours black, with a decent sized head, with some retention. Chocolate notes are certainly present, but they do not overwhelm the beer. Alcohol well hidden. This is not a stout that will immediately knock your socks off, but I can't imagine anyone not liking it. Thanks Joe!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Dantes,4.43,"Package: 12oz. bottle, no ABV listed; &#8220;Limited Bottling-Winter &#8216;02-&#8216;03&#8221;. Classy but busy gold and white lettering on a black label. Neck-label describing Imperial Stouts.  Cost: $1.49 (single)  Presentation: Imperial Pint glass at 50º  Appearance: Generous gunsmoke. Poured beautifully, generating a dense, voluminous, dark-brown head studded with some larger bubbles. Glass displayed a beautiful, long-lasting cascade of bubbles as head built. Foam persisted throughout the beer, generating heavy curtains of lace and thick rings at each swallow. Looked like a nitrogen-draught stout! Held to light, only the faintest glow existed at the edges.  Smell: Restrained aroma, despite head and carbonation activity. Definitely some sweet, roasted malt; with hints of caramel coffee and some alcohol licks. I was disappointed that there wasn&#8217;t any indication of chocolatey notes, but I didn&#8217;t have to wait long!  Taste: Wow! The chocolate was right up front, lined with an espresso edge. Further tasting revealed the sensation of plums preserved in eau de vie, a woody fruitiness, and the bitter-chocolate edge. Reminded me of Venezuelan El Rey 99% bittersweet chocolate. No overt sweetness, but an overall impression of rounded flavors. Alcohol was well-integrated, extending the sensation of flavors in the middle and finish.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy and viscous, staking a firm claim on one&#8217;s tongue. The extremely fine but persistent carbonation generating that beautiful pour really improves the flavor and my enjoyment of this beer.  Drinkability: Astoundingly drinkable! I could easily drink three of these without a problem (except for subsequent locomotion). It was satisfying, refreshing, intriguing, and inviting.  After the Storm King, I thought that I wouldn&#8217;t like this very much as it is not as well-rated (thus the single bottle). Boy was I glad I tried it. I found this to be a really enjoyable beer. I thought that it was smoother, more complex, and more flavorful than the Storm King; with a better appearance and mouthfeel than the Sam Smith&#8217;s Imperial Stout. After my SK experience, I began to doubt my ability to appreciate Imperial Stouts, but I&#8217;ve found another I like and my current benchmark for the type. Putting my money where my mouth is, I bought 2 sixes of this for immediate consumption. On draught, this would be a 5 overall!  Backwash: Even my mother liked this! What else can I say?",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Bcant,4.55,"This sturdy stout pours black and has a rocky creamy head. Its remarkable chocolate flavors, derived entirely from the malts (rather than from real chocolate as in some stouts) are well balanced by enough hops to avoid over sweetness. Other detectable flavors light caramel notes and a hit of smokiness from the roasted malts. A cold winter's night feels complete with a pint of Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,WanderingFool,3.58,"This beer is pure darkness in a bottle. Light can not penetrate it and only a chocolate mousse colored foam head let's you know you have not fallen into a black hole. Above the beer hovers an aroma of alcohol, malt, and cherry (reminds me of a port wine). Each sip of this full bodied beer begins rich and malty. Coffee, chocolate, raisin (or cherry?), and alcohol are all present. A sticky sweetness with fruity overtones are left behind.  The fruity esters and alcohol flavor were a bit of a turn off for me. However, the malty characteristics and smooth mouthfeel make this an enjoyable beer.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,vitesse,4.48,"This beer just pours so beautifully -- performance art in a glass. The carbonation just cascades so smoothly and the head comes up to a creamy, tan foam. The alcohol in it seems to hit the tastebuds hard, but in a pleasant way- a way that tells you ""respect me, fool!"" The taste that is most prominent has to be the malts. The maltiness is so good that you won't long at all for hops bitterness. This is just a perfect winter dessert beer. The only thing that takes away from it a tiny bit is that once the beer settles in the glass, it seems to lose some of its creamy texture (but that's a small price to pay.) This is a serious, heavyweight beer -- and one that is probably one of the most affordable in beer stores.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,avylover,4.43,"One look at this brew is enough to get you drooling. Pours solid black with a huge deep tan/red (yes, red) head. Smells of burnt coffee & floral hops.

Great brew!!",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,beerluvr,4.7,"'02-'03: Poured with a deep mocha colored head atop opaque black liquid. Nose is dark fruits, roasted barley...rich and deep. Taste is powerfully malty and roasty, roasty, roasty! Espresso-like tones mingle with notes of alcohol and a healthy hopping that almost balances things out. Finishes long and bittersweet and powerfully tasty...not as good as last years' rendition, but still a bold Imperial Stout.  '01-'02: This beauty pours black as can be. The tan head settles into a fine bubbled lace. Nose is heavily roasted malts, chocolate (true to it's name), and slight yeast fruitiness. First taste is a bit tangy followed by more roasted malt, alcohol, bittersweet chocolate, fruitiness and a long dry finish. Hops are there, but I think the malt profile elbows it's way to the front. This beer is amazing..due to it's ever-changing, long-lasting finish. an American classic! Others may not agree, but IMHO this is the best vintage to date. -- '00-'01: Oh man, put on the seat belt for this one! It's one helluva roasty, toasty, hoppy, strong roller-coaster ride.

45,680,JISurfer,4.31,"This is the best Imperial Stout I've ever had. It's appearance is stupendous. Dark black, with a dark red head, that was huge, but after a while it died down. It has a little of a alcohol after taste, but it's hardly noticeable with the chocolatey taste. It's soooo smooth! I couldn't believe how it just ran down my tounge and coated my throat.

45,680,jward,4.01,"Reviewing the 01-02 edition, which has been sitting for about ten months. I believe that this beer is better now than it was in early March when the six-pack was purchased.  Black with a dark tan, mocha-colored head that is decorated with an array of swirling browns and peppered with differently sized bubbles. A beautiful beer. The aroma suggests sweet molasses and raisin, with only a hint of chocolate. Alcohol is also present in the nose. The initial flavor displays roasted malt, with what I would describe as dark, even burnt, coffee. The chocolate flavors are at first rather faint, but more noticeable as the beer warms, especially at the back of the palate and in the nasal passages. At no point, however, would I describe this glass of beer as especially chocolately. There is a slight sourness at the finish.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Admiraldinty,4.35,"Inky black with a dark tan head. I found this far tastier than the Luxury Double Chocolate Stought (probably because the Brooklyn is an imperial stout while the latter is not). The chocolate was also far more apparent in this beer. Of course other flavors were present: coffee, etc. The mouthfeel was not quite as good as the Young's, although it was certainly quite good. This is definitely a beer that must be respected, and too much of it at once is not a good idea.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Wildman,4.45,"This beer fooled me with it's name. I didn't know it was one of my beloved Imperial Stouts I hadn't tried. Well, it poured like a Guiness, black as night and a rolling foaming dark tan head that left circular lace as it subsided. An aroma of burnt malt, coffee and chocolate, which seems to be the most powerful aspect. Might account for the name. The flavor was of malt, coffee and chocolate. It had a medium body and a bit of sourness to the finish. This is one that may do better with some cellaring. A good imperial, but not up there with Expedition or Stone.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,goz,3.51,"Jet black pour, with small hot chocolate looking head. Aroma had roasted malt and an alcohol kick to it. Taste was initially roasted coffe, bitter chocolate - quickly turning to a tongue coating dark chocolate sweetness that lasts and lasts and lasts. Although the alcohol is in the aroma it sneaks up on you in the brew. My second tasting of this wasn't quite as enjoyable as the first. The aroma was more astringent, and the alcohol aroma and feel in the mouth was much stronger and less pleasant.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,francisweizen,4.5,"2002-2003: An Excellent Russian Imperial Stout! This beer pours a thick, motor-oil black into my stout chalice. This smells of chocolate, malts, and smoke and roasted barley. This tastes chocolaty, boozy, and narcotic...absolutely wonderful. This has a very thick and rich mouthfeel, and I feel that this beer should be drabk at 50degrees or so to fully experience this luscious mouthfeel. This beer also has a nice good drinkability, and it is a classic of this style IMO.  2000-2001: This aged version of the BBCS poured a dark black colour with a gigantic dark brown head. The aromas were of ALCOHOL, CHOCOLATE, roasted malts, and hops. The taste was a wonderful mix of booze and chocolate. This stout had a very roasted flavor and the mouthfeel was exceptionally creamy, full and excellent. The drinkability? Excellent as well. This brew ages very well!  2003-2004: Not as strong as previous years offerings. A light chocolate aroma with a bit of booze, and some hops. The taste is of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, and booze.

The head was a thick creamy dark beige brown color and lasted quite a long time. The aroma was of chocolate, chocolate, coffee, raisins, alcohol and some roasted chocolate. The taste was nice and creamy. Flavors of chocolate and coffee seemed to dance together throughout the mouthful, but I did notice that chocolate seemed to lead. I also noticed that during the ballet in my mouth the raisins and alcohol would try to cut in on the other two dancing and seemed to get in a step or two, first raisins, then alcohol, then raisins again before the other would ask for there partner back. At the end alcohol seemed to get the last dance with the chocolate. I personally loved this limited edition 02-03 beer.

The cascade of tan bubbles (ala Guinness) lets you know that you have a treat ahead of you. A substantial head builds up, creamy on top, course underneath. It'll eventually die down to a quarter inch leaving rememberances of lace along the glass. The aroma is one of my favorite parts of this beer. Chocolately, fruity, winey, with some alcohol presence... makes you just want to take a taste. Initially thin feeling, this beer thickens and becomes creamy as it moves to the back of your mouth.

Dark chocolate in the nose, along with a nice dark fruit aroma - plum & grape - that doesn't seem as noticeable in fresher samples. Hops and alcohol detectable as well.  The mouthfeel in this 6 year old beer is exceptional. Still subtle carbonation but wonderfully full and rich. This really has aged quite well. Maple syrup notes compliment the mild chocolate and dark fruits. Finishes sweeter than I'm used to - an enjoyable milk chocolate candy-like sweetness that subsides into alcohol warmth.  Excellent @ 6 years old. Thanks to yen157 for this...glad I waited another year after receiving it. Superb stuff.   '02-'03 bottling, sampled 12.22.03 - Not so chocolatey as it is hoppy!

The middle is full, creamy, rich, thick, and hearty. Finishes dry, spicy and has some notes of espresso. The bitterness in this brew comes from the roasted malt, hop presence is not noticeable.

45,680,shirfan,4.38,"'02-'03: Pitch-black opaque with a moderate, carmel colored head. Smells like woodsmoke and burnt malt but not overpowering nor offensive. The suds didn't last especially long, but that's not what this beer is about.  Alcohol makes its presence known immediately, giving way to a complex and strategic battle between roasted bitter malt, sweetness, coffee notes, and a hint of chocolate (although it is not an ingredient).  All the while, a warming, bubbly mouthfeel attacks the tastebuds and reminds you that Guinness is a sissy drink in comparison.  I recall last year's batch being less up front about its high-octane kick, and slightly sweeter, although the 02-03 vintage is brand-new at this point. I'm hoping that a few months will take the edge off the slightly-too-powerful alcohol flavor.  This is my favorite winter beer, without a doubt. A couple of these in the fridge are the perfect answer to the snowstorms which are only a matter of time.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,allboutbierge,4.63,"'02-'03: wow, I read yen157's review and picked up a few of these at the beer store earlier. Its a wonderful stong stout with a nice choclate aftertaste with a strong flavor of burnt malts and some coffee taste in there. It poured a BEAUTIFUL fluffy head with a unique ruby tint that shined through the heavy lace it left on the glass. Its is dark, i mean really DARK, almost the color of tar or oil but that ruby tinted head makes it a very attractice beer. I didn't notice much of an alcohol taste immediatly, but once the beer warmed a little, it was evident no so much by the taste but the feelign of my noise. I did not detract from its drinkablility rating due to its heaviness; I assume that if you drinking this you like imperial stouts, but due to it's alcohol taste that i guess just comes along with a beer that's 10.6abv. Besides that, its a wonderful beer and if you're a strong stout lover you will love this, try it.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,yen157,4.73,"'02-'03: I've waited months for this to come out. Finally, it's here. Available from October through March, this is a real treat if it's available in your area. This beer poured ink black with a nearly cardboard-brown head. It smelled of chocolate, burnt grains, malt, and strangely enough, strawberries. As for flavors, it had a charcoal (probably from black patent malt), chocolate, malt, and alcohol. It had a burnt toast / charcoal aftertaste. The bitterness from the hops combined well with the bitter and slightly sour taste from the blackened grains. Excellent! Once again, this beer will top my list for the coming months.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,aracauna,4.44,"'01-'02: Pours perfectly black with a beautiful deep tan head. The head is slow to form and disspipates quickly however. The Aroma is chocolate, espresso, burnt toast with a bit of fruitiness that makes it seem like the burnt toast has jelly or jam on it. The aroma floods the nose and starts the salivary glands. Burnt toast flavor and a thin bitterness from the hops dominate early on switching to espresso and unsweetened black chocolate later on and a lingering, bitter finish. That's while cold. When closer to room temperature the flavors mellow with the sharp burnt and espresso bitterness become less sharp sliding under a sweeter more chocolately taste. Mouthfeel is slightly oily, but not as thick or gritty as some other imperials. One of the lighter beers of the style.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,NeroFiddled,4.03,"Winter '00-'01, which makes this roughly a year old at this point. This beer is possibly the best ""bottled"" beer from Brooklyn - I think we all know that the non-contract draft beer coming out of the brewery is much better! This beer pours a very dark brown/black with ruby highlights. There's a nice, light tan/brown head around the rim of the glass, although no Belgian-lace is produced. The aroma is of a bittersweet chocolate and candyish malt, but without hops, which is OK for the style. The flavor starts with alot of chocolate and roastiness followed by a clear alcohol, a bit of hop flavor, and eventually mellowing into very nice coffee notes. The finish is really wonderful! The carbonation level is appropriate and the body is nice. There are no off-notes to speak of. Overall, a very nice example of the style, although I distinctly remember prior year's samples as having a bit more malt and a somewhat smoother character. I hope this will mellow a bit, but I also fear it may pick up some innapropriate oxidative flavors.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,goindownsouth,3.58,"'01-'02: This is a pretty good stout. The only downside is that it is not as chocolatey as I would have thought. Other than that, the aroma (coffee maybe), color (pitch black), and head (not too thick), which makes this stout a decent pick. Another solid brew from the Brooklyn Brewery.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,WilliamPhilaPa,3.76,"'01-'02: Starts by pouring a jet black, your unable to see through it, with a nice dark tan head that settles with deep fluffy pockets. On the nose there are aromas of roasted malts, several tones of dark chocolate with the alcohol poking through also. Exactly the same can be found on the palate, with a bit of alcohol warming from the back of the throat to the gut...a slow sipper. A nice winter brew / imperial stout. Pretty sweet... but enjoyable for me.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Coach,4.28,"'01-'02: I really look forward to this every winter. This past year I split a case with a friend. I loved it, he still has a few. For me, this is perfect when I only want to drink just one brew and chill out for the night. It is heavy and strong - just the way it should be.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,sponberg,3.65,"'01-'02: Sampled: On tap, pint glass  Aroma: Roastiness, chocolate, and hints of alcohol. Starts out with a slight tang amongst the roasted flavors, which quickly subsides to leave a big, roasted malt and chocolate taste with a decent (not huge) body to it. The alcohol becomes more pronounced as it goes down, but doesn't ever come close to overpowering the roasted coffee/chocolate/burnt toast(?) flavors. A very nice brew that, with the addition of a bit more body, could be incredible - albeit less ""I'll have another, thanks!"" drinkable.  Me being me, I had the bartender give me a 5 oz. glass and mixed this half-and-half with Middle Ages Druid Fluid barleywine. THAT rounded the flavor out.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,RonfromJersey,4.08,"'01-'02: Black body with big tan head, which too quickly disipated to a thin topping. Chocolate, liquorice, and alcohol in aroma. Roasted malts, chocolate and coffee tones in taste. Enough alcohol in taste to know this is not a session beer. It is a nice evening topper.  '02-03: To the above, I will add a big heaping of dark fruits, particularly raisins.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,WORT,3.97,"A nice chocolate aroma, a deep chocolate flavor. Poured smoothly and had a decent foam time. Would like to try it on nitro.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Thrasher,4.15,"'01-'02: This is the first time I've tried it so I can't compare to previous years. Initial taste is alcoholic, although other flavors quickly surround it upon subsequent sips. Great mouthfeel, heavy but not sluggish; sticky, but not cloying. Head did not last as long as I would have liked. Overall satisfying, though, and I would very much like to shelf it and taste it again down the road.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,pbrian,4.37,"'01-'02: A bedtime treat. Nice burnt coffee/cocoa flavors. Viscous mouthfeel that I believe could be balanced with a little more hops. Finishes with a warming acidic burnt malt bitterness. Aging usually rounds out the rough corners, but it's still good complex brew young.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,ZAP,4.01,"'01-'02: My first experience with a Brooklyn Brewery product. (Not that it factored into the rating, but it has a great classy looking bottle)..Smells of high alcohol, and has a bit of a high alcohol taste to it...Nice imperial though...very rich and thick but nowhere close to Belle's Expedition in this area...tastes of bakers chocolate thanks to some nice complex blackened malts...(I don't believe this beer adds any real chocolate to it)..I had heard a lot of positives about this brewery, and my first experience is a good one...Above average Imperial Stout..",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Jason,3.4,"Presentation: 12 oz brown long neck bottle with ""Limited Bottling - Winter '00-'01"".  Appearance: Ink black with a light brown and quite impressive lace that retains like a champ.  Smell: Dark chocolate covered espresso beans and a mild ripe prune fruitiness.  Taste: Full bodied and very smooth, a tangled mesh of dark roasted coffee and dark unsweetened chocolate. Hops are vague amongst the roasted barley bitterness, some sweetness prevails with a fruitiness attached of prunes. Roasted and chocolate flavours linger just about forever. Alcohol is certainly there with its feeling of warmth to the throat and chest.  Notes: Layered and complex, a strong foothold on the taste buds with the roasted character. This brew will get even better towards the end of the winter with some age. -- Presentation: 12 oz brown long neck bottle with ""Limited Bottling - Winter '99-'00"".  Appearance: Close to pitch black, thick and creamy tan lace with a sufficient head retention.  Smell: Fusel alcohols near to a cooking sherry aroma, twang of roasted and charcoal in the nose also.  Taste: Massively creamy with a thick bold body or malt that is close to being syrupy. Smoothness is quite incredible. Burnt fruit and some fusel alcohols give a twang and kick respectively. Roasted flavours are intact with a slight acidic flavour that melds well with the fruitiness. Alcohols are a bit too much and tell you in one way or another to respect the brew. Hops are faded and a touch herbal / leafy in flavour amongst the roasted prowess. Vagueness of wet paper shows a touch of age from oxidation, not in a bad way though.  Notes: Best consumed at cellar temperature, alcohols are a bit too much and if the oxidation could hold out for a year or more this beer will mellow out to be a great vintage brew.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,hooligan,3.76,"Excellent beer... I haven't had an aged one, but I have split a 12oz with a friend and I must say, throughly tasty. Very strong in the ""roasted"" section, mild hop bitterness, and a sweet chewiness. The finish was slightly too alcoholic for me, the vapors alone cleared my sinuses... but all in all, great Imperial.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,AaronRed,4.76,"'01-'02: Wow, this beer knocked me out! For a while, all I could taste and smell was alcohol. But after it warmed, the rich texture of the chocolate and malt became evident. This beer really warms the inside of your belly and is perfect for this time of year. -- '00-'01: What a brew! I saved a bottle from last year and it evolved into an even more spectacular beer. It's like velvet, but sweet and with a kick. You can't go wrong.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,John,4.9,'01-'02: This is one of the beers that's consistently in my top 20 or better. One of the most complex and delicious brews ever made. I love BBCS as a nightcap or a special treat on it's own. -- '00-'01: Simply one of the best Imperial stouts.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,QXSTER1,4.76,"Boldest, most complex stout I've had to date. Enhances chocolate desserts immensely.",Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
45,680,Todd,4.78,An incredibly tasty and powerful stout. Best use of chocolate malt that I've ever seen for the style. It's high alcohol and rich flavours also make it a perfect canditate for aging. Have a 99-00 that I am waiting to review. Yummy stuff.,Brooklyn Brewery,"New York, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,92
