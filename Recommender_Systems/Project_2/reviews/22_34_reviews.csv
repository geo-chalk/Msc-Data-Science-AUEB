22,34,Pivopijak,3.79,"can into glass Thick 'n' creamy alabaster head, which is slow to recede. Translucent, light orange and some amber, for the look. Bright, a tiny bit of a sour note, fairly subtle coriander and clove, with a little touch of lemon and banana, along with a very subtle background of medium light toasted barley, for the aroma. Taste kicks off with bright and somewhat tangy character, of a hefeweizen sort, with a firm edge and a lemon/clove and slight malt flavor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,DFred,4.5,"Clear, golden color with a medium head. Nice balance of sweetness, bitterness, and spice. Fruity aroma with hints of banana, pear, and citrus. Spicy, slightly bitter flavor that complements the beer's sweetness. Nice effervescence which adds to the beer's overall light and crisp character. Smooth, medium-bodied mouthfeel that is easy to drink despite its high alcohol content. A great tripel!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,GStone899,4.66,"Best at cellar Temp. Pours golden with a ton of head and lots of lacing. Flavors of honey, dark fruits and biscuit. Finishes dry. For 9% alcohol you can barely taste it. This could be dangerous. Great beer to drink with food. I'll go with crackers, summer sausage and cheese because I'm poor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mpruden,4.66,"Well within its date range, poured from a 12-oz. bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance: Pale orange, huge head that dissipates at a moderate speed, leaving slight lacing.  Nose: Sweet alcohol, very inviting.  Mouthfeel: Nicely medium heavy.  Attack: Follows the nose, complex and very pleasant, true to style; adequate carbonation.  Finish: Alcohol evident, bitterness nicely balances the attack.  Overall: Please don’t try to drink this beer at refrigerator temperature just because it’s lighter in color — the nose and terrific flavor come out only as it warms. This beer deserves its high marks — a wonderful sipper — we especially enjoy it with St. Andre cheese on bagel crisps, as well as with Smoky Potato Corn Chowder with Chicken and Bacon, and coarse-grind cornbread topped with honey.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,Bluerabbitbell,4.24,"1/15/23 Poured from 12oz bottle bought from Washington Beer Store.  Poured a hazy amber with lingering white foam  Aroma.... Fruity sour like unripened kiwi, fresh bread, honey, and a hint of spice.  Flavor.... Immediate brighteness on the tongue, malty-bready, toasted cracker, white wine, honey and an interesting yogurt ending with a dry finish.  Yummy!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,HowfarisZanzibar,4.48,"Poured into a snifter. First noticed the robust head - almost 2 fingers thick and audibly frothy. I rarely hear a beer fizz like that. Don't have much to say about the smell, smells like a Tripel. Taste is a bit underwhelming after having St. Bernardus Abt 12 over the holidays. This has less sweetness, and is predominantly in the front of the mouth. Still a great beer overall and I'm thoroughly enjoying this bottle as I sip my way through it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,txaudiophile,4.23,"Pleasantly surprised by this excellent brewery. Haven't had a bad beer from them yet. It reminds me a little of the Chimay Tripel in terms of bitterness, but it is unique in its own way. Well-crafted.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Mugman8,4.46,"Bought a four pack of bottles at Total Wine. Nice price for a Tripel. Golden amber color on the pour, with a thick white head, but little lace. Aroma is fresh dough and banana. Slightly boozy with the first sip. Taste is complex -- bread, caramelized malts, banana, apple, clove and coriander. Follows is sweet and bready finish. This Canadian is right up there with the best Belgians I have had. Will be buying again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Light aroma, some yeast and non citrus fruit.  On tasting, smooth and clean, abv well hidden. Sweet. Some light fruit notes.  Mouth full, finish sweet and lively.

L: Pours medium dull apricot gold w bright edges, a smooth rounded creamy 1/2"" or roughly 12.6.5mm white head, very good retention, very active lively carbo, random spotty lacing. S: Yeast, a hint of pastry dough, banana, clove, light alcohol w warming. T: Lots of palate flavor, yeast, grains, caramelized malts, banana, clove, a hint of peach, green apple, moderately fruity, a suggestion of yellow bread, light alcohol w warming. F: Fizzy, lofty, med-heavy and slightly assertive feel w a med-length finish that is moderately drying, clean over all and slightly warming. O: A full flavored and beautiful tasting Tripel with an elegant feel & finish. Though clean and less earthy, it is up there with some classic Belgian Tripels. It is world-class in its style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,FeelsBadJuju,4.35,Pretty mild flavors and large head but fantastic sipper. Honestly the best beer for the price. I've found it in so many shops so it's always easy to pick up. Do not even think about buying it in a can though. Completely different beer when it's bottled versus in a can.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,IvoryBilledWoodpecker,3.58,"Hazy and golden, huge head dies at moderate rate, sits there at low level for a hot minute. Smell is good, nice hops.

22,34,defunksta,4.3,"Appearance: Pours a clear, deep and rich orange color with a strong white head. SRM of 10. (4.25)  Aroma: Strong and complex aromas of orange citrus, bread, bananas, and Belgian spices. A candied sweetness underneath.  Flavor: Strong flavors of rich bread notes, a sweet yeast that leaves flavors of citrus, grapes, banana, and Belgian spices of clove and coriander. A light astringency. Then a sweet and bready finish.  Feel: A heavier-body. Strong carbonation and yeast. A soft, full mouthfeel. Surprisingly clean for the sweet body. (4.25+)  Overall: A top-of-the-line Tripel here. I haven't had a good one in a while. This one reminded me what I was missing. Authentic. Nails the aromas and flavors. A nice balance of citrus, banana, and bread spice. A full, soft, yet clean mouthfeel. All aspects are top tier here. (Rating: 4.30)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,augustgarage,4.27,"Best before 5/28/2024 - consumed on 3/27/2022. Poured from a caged-and-corked 750mL bottle into my Unibroue tulip.  Lightly cloudy sunglow body supports a lasting finger of baby powder crema. Fine, dense lacing; no legs; superior retention.  Sweet gentle aromatics suggest honey, ripe pear, and hints of spice (cinnamon/coriander/clove/white pepper?). A touch of banana as well.  Palate entry follows the nose, but is followed by a hefty malt note, more phenols/spice, and a low but lingering bitterness. Earthy/grassy/not-quite-floral hop flavors emerge once in a while. House yeast character is present, but by no means dominant. Medium finish with a hint of curaçao (orange), overripe banana, and alcohol.  Medium-bodied, well carbonated, and fairly warming.  While lacking the complexity of the better Belgian examples, this remains one of the best domestic/North American renditions available.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,sulldaddy,4.49,"Sampling a cellar temp 750 ml bottle that I picked up at the store 2 weeks ago. Date stamp of best before 04-19-2024 on this corked and caged bottle. Pouring into my snifter, the beer is a bright gold color, almost champagne like out of the glass. A creamy bleached white head foams up 2 cm and rests as a sturdy surface layer that remains through the tasting. I also have dense clingy lattice when I swirl the glass or take a sip. Several very fine streams of carbonation rise to the surface of the glass. The aroma is some biscuity malt, a little bit of fruit note with pears and green apple and some white grape. I also get a little lemon and maybe some coriander. No real booziness giveaway. First sip reveals a medium body with a bit of crisp texture and fine tingly and fizzy carbonation. The bubbles foam up in my mouth with no swirl. Definitely a little prickly carbonation. Flavor is some sweet fruit with pears and white grape moving to cloves and coriander and then a little black pepper the bites on the finish. No warming booze, but the bite seems to be abv related. Finish is very dry and encourages me to take another sip. the flavors on this beer are bolder than some other recent tripels and I enjoy the combination of tastes. Quite a solid beer that will sneak up on you with well hidden booze.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JZH1000,3.93,"Poured from 12oz bottle  The look is highly carbonated with a dark golden lightly hazy body. 2 finger head on the pour larger bubbles, shrinks down to a one finger head of fine bubbles. After sitting for a bit carbonation is still quite lively. Some lacing.  The aroma iels essentially all belgian yeast with a light crackery malt on the back end. Slight funk sort of makes me think of an older bottle of an AAL, the funk however fits this style much better than a lager, but still throwing me off a little bit. Some fruity esters also detectable.  The flavor is quite similar to the smell, some light citrus notes followed by banana esters and some hints of clove. Perhaps some of what I'm picking up is the spice it was brewed with as the bottle says. I'm not sure what the spice is. After the ferment character once again some crackery malt shines through. The malt is also sweet and present on the first sip before being overwhelmed by yeast character.  Feel is dominated by the big carbonation. The head doesn't make this one creamy so much as carbonation bite dominates. Despite that the beer is not at all watery and sticks around on the palate for a while.  Overall a good belgian style trippel. I wasn't actually aware it was Canadian however until looking on BA here which docks the score a bit, but the beer itself is a good take on a trippel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,redresonatedragon,4.59,"A lively carbonated, highly quaffable trippel. This is one I always revisit over the years. Less sweet than most, but still full of those fruity esters, a beautiful floral bouquet awash with lingering spices. Tons of rich flavors are enlivened by the effervescence, more of a gulper than a smooth sipper. I could drink more of these in one sitting than I should",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,AlexandraDen,4.18,"Pours a hazy, light orange-yellow with a nice thick two inch head, that slowly recedes into one inch of a thick bubbly ring. Lighter than I expected — or maybe the Belgian Tripels I’ve had so far are just darker than usual.  Spices, cloves, and stone fruit. The aroma is more spice and fruit forward than malty or yeasty, so if that’s your thing for Tripels, you are going to love this. Oh, definite coriander on the nose as well.  The flavours are somewhat mild for the style but pretty complex. It follows the aromas pretty tightly, but I get a little more malt and wheaty bread like notes here, to be expected. Nothing like Rochefurt Tripel or some other Tripels, but still a pleasant malt backbone. Which makes it finish relatively sweet, but more peppery than you might expect. Some nutmeg and caramel here as well. As always for this style, recommended to not serve ice cold, or to sip slowly and let it warm up and enjoy the evolution of flavours. The finish noticeably lengthens as it warms, and the malty notes in the back are strengthened as it decants. Some candied pear flavours come out here as well that I didn’t notice when it was cold!  Surprisingly light bodied, there is strong carbonation that foams with each sip, which brings out that peppery feel for sure. You will not taste the alcohol whatsoever. Finishes dry and sweet, and unlike a few other reviewers, I did not notice much acidity or bitterness whatsoever.  Due to the lack of ability to import, and LCBO restrictions, Ontario is not the best for international beers. But the one best thing about living here is access to Unibroue. All their beers are great and you can always get them fresh. My bottle was only a few weeks old.  Overall, compared to some of the Belgian Tripels, you might notice it’s a bit less sweet and more balanced in flavours. The malt and yeasty notes are there, but fairly mild. The fruity esters and spicy notes are more of a feature here. If this is your style for Tripels, I can see why this is ranked at the top. If you like serious malt, yeast, sweetness, some of the Trappist beers from Belgium dial it up more. This is still an absolute top tier offering and an absolute must-try for anyone who likes Belgian beers or tripels no matter how you prefer the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,MrOH,4.76,"Deep orangish-yellow, white head, decent retention and lace Pear eau de vie, pepper, cloves, green banana, green peach, vanilla aromas Pretty much tastes like it smells, minus the vanilla, peppery finish Light bodied with appropriate carbonation Forgot how good this is",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,md3kcn,4.83,"Purchased as a single bottle from The Blue Door for $6.00. Poured into a tulip glass.  L - Pours a dark & hazy goldenrod with a two-finger pale white head. Lacing is excellent; great legs. S - Coriander, stone fruit, yeasty breads. Lemongrass, and nutmeg. A bit of white grape, as well. T - Taste follows nose. Also getting a bit of raw sugarcane, clove, and citron. Finish is surprisingly dry, and peppery. Fairly sweet until the finish, but well-balanced flavor-wise. F - Medium-full body with medium carbonation. Refreshing, and scarily easy-to-drink - I didn't even realize it was 9% ABV until halfway through the glass and I looked closer at the bottle! O - Easily one of the best beers I've had; a must-try for everyone. From the color to the flavor, this brew sets the bar for non-Trappist tripels. Spicy, complex, and extremely satisfying. A bit on the sweet side, but the flavor complexity makes up for it. I do intend to purchase this one again, and would highly encourage one to buy it if they see it - even if the price seems a little high for a 12oz bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,UnoBeero,5,"Nose: citrus fruits, apricots, mild grape, minor malt and alcohol smell. Easily one of the most appetizing beers I have experienced.  In the Glass: Beautiful medium/ dark amber. Pour with a good head as a Tripel should be enjoyed.  Palate: beautiful rich aromas become sweet and complex, FULL bodied, for a 9% alcohol Tripel there is no bite or harshness to La Fin Du Monde. I cannot stress the how full of citrus and sweet fruit this beer is, it is unbelievable that a beer could be this complex. Sweetness mixes well with the malt body. What a great experience  Finish: In the throat the sweetness leaves and moves into a smooth and somewhat more sharp finish. Once again I would never have guessed this is a 9% abv ale.  While this Tripel is extremely pricy in Ontario Canada, I urge all those who are into beers whether it be Belgian ales, wheat beers or IPAs, this is truly a great experience. This is the only beer or beverage (I review a lot of single malt scotch whiskies) I would give a perfect rating.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Byron28,4.54,"A great Tripel beer similar to Chimay’s Cinq Tripel. It is full of flavor with hints of coffee, chocolate, and clove. Would be considered one of the best Tripel’s the world has to offer, much less Belgium.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BeerAndGasMasks,4.01,"From the bottle, it pours a clear light yellow-golden color with a nice white head that eventually diminishes to a nice ring.

22,34,dano213,3.96,"12oz bottle purchased from the fridge as a single, don't remember the price. ""BB 02-22-24"" and there is some kind of a date code B22211845QFL. Whatever.  Look: This is a bit darker than I expected. It is a pale amber color and has a subtle haze. There is a half pinky finger of frothy khaki-colored head. After pouring the yeast, the head became much bigger and frothier and the beer became hazier and a touch darker in color. Nice lacing. Beautiful appearance.  Smell: The nose is not so bold. Strong aromas of clove, some banana, and alcohol-soaked raisins. Some other spices like cinnamon, pepper, coriander, and ginger also. There is definitely a yeasty/doughy component.  Taste: Up front, it's very sweet but that doesn't last long. The mid palate is malt-forward with banana and notes of fruit compote, and then the spices and dryness take over on the finish. It's interesting. It's also hard for me to describe because I need to reacclimate myself with the style. The finish is super dry and spicy with tons of clove, some nutmeg, ginger, coriander, and pepper.  Feel: Appropriately carbonated. The bottle conditioning gives this a soft, smooth mouthfeel.  Overall: It's been years since I have had this beer. I'm not sure how much I like this; it's a style that is a bit foreign to me because it has been so long. The spices are just so strong. Somehow, it works in this beer but it still tastes a bit ""hot"" to me not so much in alcohol but in spice on the finish.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Buttercookie,5,"I like everything about this beer so I'm giving it a straight 5 across the board. It's delicious and although I think gluten-free is better for a body, flavor-wise and for the kick of 9% alcohol, this beer is hands down the best.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Dark fruits like dates and raisins show up.  The actual liquid is thin but it fills your mouth with bubbly, foamy carbonation. The finish has that funk but also draws out with a fruity bitterness.  There's a reason why this is the top ranked triple. It's extremely delicious. I give it a 5.6 out of 6.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The best blend of a triple I've ever had and it used to be one my most sought-after beers. Not sure if I missed this or never wrote a review. The spices are really incredible. Not sure how this could be improved. It's not too sweet and a joy to drink. I shall get more of this and keep this in the aging case. BB date 01/07/24.

22,34,TheRatCage,4.37,"L: foamy/soapy two finger white head. Rather clear gold in color. Some lacing. Big carbonation appearance. Very nice.  S: coriander and spices foremost. Apple and sweet fruit next, purple grape, hint of prune. Sweet malt ties in with that. The sweetness of the smell overwhelms any barnyard hops or yeast sadly.  T: Apple and banana. Very apple sweet. Close to tripel karmeliet in that profile. Some clove. Some pear. Hides it’s alcohol content well. Not extremely nuanced, a tiny bit of spice at the end.  F: medium bodied. Seems to thin out as it warms up but still holds its character. Nice finish, not overly dry.  O: Well, I finally got around to this review. As said previously, I find this most similar to tripel karmeliet for the tripel category. It’s very good, deserving of its top 3 spot as of right now on the rankings. I just wish it had a little more yeast character to balance out its sweetness. Overall, recommend this highly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,colts9016,4.28,"Review 1543 Scanning my reviews, I discovered this beer was not there. The beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour created a beautiful two-fingered off-white head. The head is airy and creamy with excellent retention. The head dissipated slowly, leaving chunky lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 7, goldenrod with amber hues. The clarity of the beer is mostly clear with some carbonation bubbles dancing within the liquid.  The initial aromas are floral, fruity esters, white pepper, and malty sweetness. Nosing further, I detect cloves, oranges, biscuit, toasted malts, a hint of banana, and some hint of pharmaceutical.  The flavors in the beer are banana, cloves, oranges, toasted crackers, fruity esters, spicy hops, pepper, malty sweetness, a touch of band-aids, biscuity, caramel, and leather.  The mouthfeel of the beer is tannic, warming, and slick.  The body of the beer is medium, medium-high carbonation, and a full finish.  The interplay with the hops, yeast, and alcohol is above average. Good harmony in the beer with a firm backbone. I was not a fan of the higher than usual alcohol warming I was getting on the finish. I did enjoy this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

What starts out spicy and yeasty develops characteristics that are floral, fruity and honey-like. Taste initially relies on the spicy, fruity, yeasty base but it, too, is more complex. The malts add a supportive backbone and the alcohol adds depth without becoming a distraction.

The taste is what really kills this thing for me. I don't know if my palette is off or something, but this was like insane spice/coriander taste and nothing else. I got a 6 pack because I thought it would be great but I'm gonna end up gifting the rest lol. The mouthfeel is quite pleasant actually. Nice carbonation and medium body. Kind of fluffy feeling.  Overall, this beer is worth trying for sure as many people like this. The flavour profile is just way too much spice/coriander for me. Really hard for me to enjoy this sadly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BPVandenbroek,3.8,"La Fin du Monde is slightly hazy and a pale amber color with highlights that remind me of very light peach jam. The head is rocky, bone white, and lasting. The aroma is malt forward, smelling like lightly toasted fresh baked bread. There's also something reminding me of fresh earth mingling in, lending support. This is where I get faint, but noticeable aromas of ripe pear brushing up against those of freshly toasted bread. Finally, hiding in the background is just a trace of Belgian spiciness. Taking a sip, La Fin du Monde is smooth and crisp. Carbonation is a little spritzier than I prefer in a beer of this type. The flavors give me toasted bread, fresh earth, and a somewhat more prominent Belgian spiciness than I found on the nose. As with the nose there are subtle notes of ripe pear lending its own sort of through note to the overall flavor profile. The finish is dry and only slightly lasting. All things being equal, this really is a wonderful beer and very respectworthy example of the style. Here's where I have issues with this beer. First, the carbonation. La Fin du Monde is, in my opinion, slightly more carbonated than it needs to be. Also, the Belgian spiciness could do to be a little more pronounced. And finally, I would like this Canadian made Tripel a little more if the flavors were a little more bright and brassy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,PathofChaos,4.84,"Appearance: Straw gold under a perfect white plume of marshmallow fluff. The head doesn’t lace so much as it retains its structure and slides down the glass. Solid retention.  Bouquet: This one’s got quite a lot going on: first, a sizeable wallop of tangy Belgian yeast and lemon rind. Then a tailcoat of cardamom, coriander, and golden wheat, punctuated by a peppery zip.  Feel: Quaffable, light, and airy. This refreshing ale seems to pass by instantly, like a cloud being driven before a swift storm. Leaves a drizzly, spiced yeast, lingering in its wake.  Taste: An autumn fruit basket with a side of bread: sour apple, crisp green pear, and ripe banana with an undercurrent of cracker-like malt grains. The consistent overtone of Belgian yeast finishes with a backlash of clove and that same, white pepper spiciness from the bouquet.  Overall: Complex. Balanced.

The smell is good, get a nice aroma of flavors, thought it was reminiscent of a strong Hefeweizen. The best part was the taste, unbelievable.

Look: Thoroughly hazed orange-gold color with a head like meringue that lasts and lingers leaving lots of lasting lacing. It drags sheets of thick foam down the glass that cling endlessly throughout the entire experience. When a light is shone through, it looks like an Indian Summer sunset.  Smell: The aroma is extremely complex with orchard fruits including apple, peach, and pear balanced by a light spice of white and black pepper followed by banana esters, phenolic compounds, smooth dried apricot, sourdough bread, baked biscuit, honey, orange, and clove. It is enticing and mouthwatering, more appetizing than any Tripel I have ever encountered.  Taste/Feel: A rich and silky smooth mouthfeel delivers flavors of Red Delicious apple, Red Anjou pear, dried apricot, white pepper, banana esters, phenolic compounds, baked rustic bread, orange blossom honey, mild bubblegum, and a warm kiss of alcohol. The flavors evolve and resonate like an orchestra across the palate.  Overall: The absolute archetypal Tripel!! It is sippable, smooth, rich, and delicious. It really tastes like a textbook style-defining Tripel! Absolutely delicious and complex at every moment.

22,34,woodychandler,4.36,"How in the flying fudge izzit that I have NEVER reviewed this beer?!? OMFG! Unibroue's head brewer, Jerry Vietz & I go 'way back! There are some tales to which I have been sworn to secrecy so fair dinkum! Here's one on me: It was PHL Beer Week in its earliest iteration, Year 1 or 2, in late-Spring & it was still bitterly cold out. Jerry & I had crossed paths at several events over the course of the day & now, it was my nightcap at Fergie's as I headed to my nearby hostel. I engaged with a pair at the bar & then, according to Jerry, since I was no longer there, I lapsed into fluent French! 8=O The couple could no longer understand me, but Jerry acted as interpreter! I could not remember a whit of it, but Jerry assured me that I was appropriate, that my tongue & mouth had not one word of English in it & that I was far more fluent than he had believed. 8=O  I had four (4) years of French in Middle & High School, despite my protestations that Spanish would be more useful. My first overseas liberty port in the Navy? Barcelona, Spain! 8={} I am apparently a natural for languages & pick up on them very quickly. I soon learned to (ahem!) procure my (ahem!) date for the import period for the duration of our stay. We would eat & drink on the local economy, go to a movie or two & she would teach me her language. My mother was once shocked by an offhand comment & inquired as to how many languages I speak. I have ~ thirty (30) & I will lapse into some of them without thinking, hence her question. My tour as a plankowner onboard the USS Normandy (CG-60) had us in France so often that by Marseille, Christmas 1991, our chargé (local ambassador) requested me as her liaison! A billet normally reserved for an officer, but my fluency was tremendous. Years of disuse have rendered it poor again, but send me to Quebec & watch!  From the Bottle (!): ""Belgian Style Triple Ale""; ""Ale Brewed with Spices""; ""Bottle Refermented"".  Pop! the cap time! Blast! It was one of those screwed-up screw-off caps! 8={} I mustered up all of my self-control & began a slow, gentle C-Line pour into the awaiting glass. Man, if there is one thing that I hate more than bottles, it is screw-cap bottles! It foamed up beautifully to create two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, French Vanilla-colored head with excellent retention. Color was a deeply-hazy/lightly-cloudy Amber (SRM = > 7, < 9). Nose smelled like Spring - flowery - orchids, daisies, honeysuckle; honey; black pepper; old newspapers from the attic for recycling. Mmm. Mouthfeel was medium, seemingly light, but on-par for the style. The taste, while spicy, was imprecisely peppery. Coriander, perhaps? Star Anise? Lots of honey, perhaps from the malt. Plus a flowery, perfume-y sweetness. Mmm. 9%, you say?!? Unbelievable! It was entirely smooth & so easy-drinking as to render it about as dangerous as I have encountered in a while. This was definitely one to remain full aware of throughout! Finish was dry, largely due to the inclusion of spices, but even then, it might have been fairly dry on its own. It might be interesting to have them brew a non-spiced batch, just for comparison purposes. I'll inquire of Jerry on our next meeting. YMMV.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Nutty, earthy, caramely malts create a firm base, while bits and pieces of cardamon and nutmeg come sprinkling through for a little additional depth. Alcohol is modest, but does come poking through towards the finish. Mouth feel is thick and filling with a soft, fuzzy texture that is reminiscent of a well-worn, comfy wool sweater.

22,34,beergoot,4.24,"Extremely clear, golden amber body; robust carbonation; head is very dense and creamy, sticky. Sweet and spicy aroma; pear. Deceptively light malt taste; excellent hop bitterness; sweet and fruity esters; alcohol presence is there yet nicely balanced in the mix. Heavy body; coarse and rippling on the palate; a touch of sweetness but noticeably dry overall.  I understand why this tripel is world class. I hardly drink them, mainly because I have it in my mind that they are rough and hot on the palate. This beer certainly has some alcohol punch, but it's nicely offset with some fine, relatively delicate sweetness and excellent fruit-like quality (I'm again thinking pears). This is a beautiful beer, bold and complex with added subtlety to keep things interesting.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,altstadt,4.6,"Look: Slightly hazy dark gold color. Pours a dense thick head that takes several minutes to evolve some large bubbles, but never really collapse to less than a finger. Leaves lacing far up the glass. Smell: Sweet dried fruit scents with a touch of spice. Swirling the glass just bumped the scents up a little in intensity, probably because the thick head prevented direct access to fluid. There was a bit of yeast much towards the bottom of the glass after the head finally dropped down. Taste: Sweet and complicated. Lots of dried fruits, like dates and figs. Gingerbread and associated spices. The flavors are all boosted in the aftertaste. This is a rather light flavored Belgian beer until you swallow it. The high alcohol content shows up as a light burn long after the aftertaste has faded. Feel: Immediately foams up to full cream and then evolves to larger bubbles. Never really breaks down. Overall: Complex flavor with some light fruit. A little sweeter than most ales, but right in line with typical Belgian tripels. There is some sediment in the bottle. If it is stored upright, you can pour a clear glass until the last ounce. Use a goblet for the first 90% and pour the last 10% into a small glass so you can try two different beers from the same bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,Gadzook,4.38,"L: Lightly hazy pale orange/gold. Two inch head in a tulip that left nice lacing and kept about a 1/4"" of foam throughout.  S: Some sugar, yeast (with hints of banana), spice (clove, nutmeg), citrus notes. Nice breadiness to it.  T: Sweet up front. Malty backbone that isn't overpronounced. Citrus peel is clean and crisp near the back end, accentuated by the spice that stays in the mouth for a moment after the sip. Just the slightest hint of the ABV. Well-balanced and very tasty.  F: Vibrant carbonation creates an almost creamy feel. Finish is very dry and clean. Medium bodied.  O: This is one tasty tripel. Not too heavy, balanced taste, beautiful aroma. I'm not the biggest tripel fan because I tend to enjoy the darker malts of quads and dubbels, but I thoroughly enjoyed this, and will definitely make it a staple.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Dark amber/gold color with a thick dark tan head, that quickly turned to lace, and good carbonation.  Smelled like a freshly baked fruit bread; yeasty, fruity (apple, pear, plum, raisin...), spicy (nutmeg, sugar, clove), with a little lemon & orange zest.  Tasted like it smelled with the addition of a multi-note malt. Feels full in your mouth and almost too sweet before the citrus kicks in and cleans everything up with a dryish finish.  This is a complex beer meant for savoring rather than quenching your thirst (although it will do that).  Possibly the best North American tripel and probably the best widely available tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Notes of yeast, banana, lemon rind, pear, sugar, and honey are upfront, followed by much of the aromatic notes mentioned.

S: Nice, bright citrus - orange, lemon rind, spice. Some bread malt in there with a nice sweet yeasty aroma.  T: Citrus peel and light fruits dominate, along with a slight bready malt in the back. There is also a light banana and pineapple note in there, and more varied fruits and spices come out as the beer warms a bit more.  F: Crisp and carbonated.  Overall: This is a solid tripel, but not my favorite either in style or from this brewery. A good version of the style; accessible and very drinkable for its strength.

22,34,Karpuk,4.44,"Unibroue's flagship beer, packed with flavor and mystery. A pretty unique tripel with a whole-mouth feel and strong aromas.

Never drank 3, 750 ml's, I would not dare. This is by far one of my most delicious favorite beers, by Unibroue, I love the fruitiness, like apples, pears, some banana, corriander, which masks the strong alcohol.

Poured into a tulip class from the less popular 341mL bottle over the larger true brainbuster, this one is a true tripel with massive collar and extreme effervescence just the way I like it with soft golden hues with only slight opaqueness - grand. Smells as a tripel should - grassy hops but far subtler than many triples so it eases you in to it's embrace. The taste evolves over time. The longer you go, the softer and fruitier the taste. Enjoy in soft pear, apple balanced with malts and slight spice - a truly balanced yet complex range here. Finishes exceptionally smooth with a low ABU of 18 but don't forget a 9.0 on the Richter Scale. At 10 dollars for 4 I find this a steal.

L: An 8-oz pour from a 750 ml bottle into a goblet delivers two fingers of light soapy head on top of a hazy orange amber body. Hazy silhouettes are discernible through the partially transparent liquid.  S: Upon first sniff, I get the expected banana, nutmeg and clove, but I also get a juicy yellow nectarine that flows into a smooth white bread with touches of honey and pear. Surprisingly simple and light for the hype, and for the abv.  T: Wow. Peach, banana and vanilla are up first, but lemon rind and honey balance each other out in the middle. Yes, it does seem like a great addition to a black tea. I can't believe this is 18 proof. I thought Golden Monkey hid the booze well. This sticks the booze behind the furnace in the basement.

Smell is a bit weak, but very sweet and full of Belgian qualities. Taste is that perfect refreshing, sweet tart-apple and pear/honey flavor.

Initial pour results in white, mostly foamy head, which takes a few minutes to settle. Each subsequent pour brings back the head, but less in volume each time. Patterns of lacing are left behind with each sip. Aroma of pear, banana, melon, cloves, light vanilla, and bready malts. Taste has green apple, pear, banana, melon, citrus lemon, light vanilla, clove, and grassy like malts. Toward a full mouth feel. The citrus at the end makes it a little dry. High carbonation levels.

The smell was unique - I call it, ""Wheaty sweet"" and I really liked it. Mouthfeel was full-bodied, quite carbonated, but it had a creamy texture that the carbonation could not deny. At 9% ABV, the sweetness I smelled still came through the boozy flavor adding something more to it that I found appealing.

T: Tart apple, pear, banana, lemon, orange, hay, biscuit, sugar cookie, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, white grape/white wine, and vanilla. Dry on the finish with hay and clove. Well balanced. Neither too sweet from the malt, nor too dry from the phenolics.  F: Highly carbonated. Feels so smooth and pillowy. Extremely well rounded. Finishes dry but not bone-dry, oh so well balanced.

Smell is light fruitiness, some yeast, light phenol and clove.  Taste is very good with pleasant light citrus and tropical fruit flavor, flavor then transitions to blend of light malt with biscuit and wheat notable, yeast with phenols and dryness, almost some weizen like flavors. Strength hidden very well by the flavor profile.  Mouthfeel is a highlight of this beer - pleasant with moderate carbonation, light sweetness and just enough dryness - nothing to detract.

I love a Triple, but this is not as hoppy as I am used to. This is a wonderful beverage. I am very glad I got it and found it in a corner at my grocer. I probably could not drink a lot of these.

Taste: The fruit and the sweetness are very dominant. It's 9% ABV and that's very noticeable (at least for my palate). Feel: Has a very rich and creamy feel. Just the right about of carbonation.

22,34,Atlas1,4.05,"Considering all the Uibroue beers I've had over the years, I was stunned to learn today that I've reviewed zero. While the Maudite was my first Unibroue beer consumed so many years ago, La Fin du Monde is my first review. Not a bad place to start.  Poured into a red wine glass, this beer is a hazy gold color with little head and no lace. It's a beautiful shade of yellow that is emboldened when held up to natural light. The nose is buttery lemon with earthy tones. Taste follows suit here, with a strong lemon/citrus presence, and noticeable clove as well. Distant pepper with a buttery finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth.  Perhaps not your classic Belgian tripel, this beer is delicious and is an easy drinking delight. While it may be 9.00% ABV, it's not at all boozy and in fact comes across as almost light at times. Would be just at home drinking this on a hot Texas summer day as I would sipping on a snifter of it sitting next to the fire place in February. Really good stuff.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,KingTen144,4.12,"Golden-orange color with adequate head. The smell is of tart fruit, and for me is the best part of the beer. The taste is initially very classic for a spiced ale, with a definite clove contribution to the flavor. The aftertaste is where is the tart fruitiness becomes more apparent.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Scott17Taylor,4.25,"Pours hazy honey orange with large fluffy white head that sticks around for a while. The aroma is floral clove and fruitiness. The flavor is much more fruit forward than the aroma the aliceynes doesn't really come into play until the finish. It's fairly estery, but the sweetness overplays it. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with frothy carbonation. It's not overly bubbly, but is still very noticeable. Overall, it's overly sweet. I haven't had a ton of tripels and need to make the effort to branch out into the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,thwinger,4.84,"Straw-amber color with gorgeous white head. Yeasty citrus smell that's is not overpowering yet is robust. Tastes of a strong ale, alcohol mildly noticeable, citrus notes with a pleasant yeasty presence and a spicy finish. Overall very good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,raychennebeul,4.93,I never drink mainstream American beer. After drinking La Fin Du Monde it is the only beer I drink. I compare it to the popular Belgian beers.

Available here for less than 3$ Canadian in most food and corner stores. It is a delicious triple ale in the Belgian style. Lots of complex flavours, fruit pale malt,s light hops, some bitterness on the final. It is a bit on the sweet side. Don't overdo it!. Better sipped. Well worth a try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Aromas of fruity pear, estery banana and pepper, bready yeast, candy sugar and sweet malt. Medium light bodied with effervescent, tangy carbonation and mellow warmth near the finish. Flavors are similar to aromas. Estery banana and light peppery notes, sweet sugary malt, light fruity pear. Medium, earthy, tangy hop bitterness through the middle. Finished semi-dryly with light boozy heat, yeasty and light fruity notes. Booziness is wonderfully masked making this dangerously drinkable. Fantastic array of complex flavors. An excellent triple.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

A: Pours a very hazy, amber color, resembling an unclarified cider, with very exuberant head formation, leading to a two to three inch head initially, but only modest head retention and soapy, limited lacing. S: Pungent. Aromas of caramel malt, cloves, and fruit (apple, peach, and banana), as well as complex spice notes. T: Cloves meet the palate initially followed by a complex mix of the elements of nose. Bitterness present but subtle and nicely in balance. M: Full bodied and thick in the mouth; solid persistent effervescence causing tingling on the palate. O: I first encountered this in Québec in 2008 and have enjoy it many times. Really a world class Tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,AmeriCanadian,4.3,"For full disclosure, I love dark Belgian beers and the dark fruits, woods, and chocolate notes they impart. But I struggle with pale Belgian beers because the banana and clove characteristics of the classic Belgian yeast are fairly unappealing to my palette. So I'm rating La Fin Du Monde as fairly as I can against the actual category, not against what I naturally gravitate to, taste-wise, and with that perspective the beer is very, very good, but possibly doesn't live quite up to its phenomenal reputation. Pours a pale, translucent gold body with a beautiful and effervescent head that holds well and laces minimally. Expected aromas of banana, bready yeast, wet straw, lemongrass, some lemon citrus, and strong phenols dominate the nose. I get a lot of mineral notes and a little stone fruit on the back end. Taste follows with familiar banana and clove, which on the first few sips is overwhelming but mellows over the course of the glass and opens the way for other characteristics to muscle through. Rye bread, brown sugar, lemongrass, pithy grapefruit, and just a little bit of piney resin show their faces mid-sip and on the back-end. Very delicate and smooth but also noteworthy and evolving. Feel is substantial for the look and pale coloring, with a viscosity (but not texture) that makes you conscious of each sip but not weighed down by it, despite the ABV. Alcohol is almost invisible and the beer drinks like a farmhouse ale. Again, not necessarily my favorite style, but for the category I can't imagine too many beers better.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,DragonsMilk,2.63,"I dont know how this is rated as the top Tripel, Its not a bad beer but it is far from great. Tastes like so many other beers that try emulate Belgian Tripels, Quads, and Saisons and miss the mark. So cloyingly sweet it ruins itself.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

M - Full bodied Belgian Tripel with a good amount of coating stickiness, medium amount of carbonation. O - This is one of my favorite Belgian Tripel's (made in or outside of Belgium).

I don't agree with all of Unibrou's offerings, but La Fin is truly one of the best representation of Belgian ale brewed outside of Belgium. And, a lot cheaper.  750ml bottle purchased all over the USA.  If there's any detraction, it would be it's sweeter than some would like. But say you're trying to convince someone to move from a fruit beer to something better, give them this beer. It's full bodied, very malty, very carbonated, very high ABV. I'll grab this beer over and over again...and share with friends!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,b__a,4.71,"Nearly perfect, in every way.  The beer pours a hazy golden-orange with a creamy white foam, but who really cares? The action is in the nose and flavor.  The beer opens with incredible boozy, spicy, banana, and tropical notes. More importantly, the beer offers such an inviting nose. I cannot quite place all of the individual components, but you just know from the outset that this beer will be incredible. In short, the smell is intoxicating.  The flavor is so complex that it's hard to describe. You open with this tingly and citrusy flavor. It tickles the palate and opens it to the flavors that follow. Right after, you get this spice and orange---mostly allspice and nutmeg---that swell and envelop the palate. After, its a slightly sour citrus note---not unlike orange pith---with a substantial boozy component. Your palate is left with a delicious coat that suggests winter holiday fruitcakes, but distilled and clearly superior.  All told, this beer may indeed be one of the finest in the world.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,ASoftMachineMan,4.93,"This is my go-to Tripel-style beer. Widely available yet top-shelf quality, a must-have for any fan of Belgian style ales.  Look: Pours golden with one-finger head which rapidly dissipates to thin lacing. A slow pour yields a much more minimal head with slightly better retention.  Smell: Grass, malt, yeast, tropical fruit all present up front on the nose. Very well hidden alcohol ester lingers in the sinuses.  Taste: Absolutely outstanding. Sweet tropical fruit (banana, mango), brown sugar, malt, grass, and spicy alcohol. Everything a tripel-style ought to be.  Feel: Super smooth with decent carbonation, does not feel its 9% abv at all, which makes this a rather dangerous beer indeed.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The aroma is of yeast, spices (coriander and pepper mainly) , and mild banana/clove. The taste follows suit, with only a slight bubblegum sweet addition to the mix. The mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is medium to medium high at the start, and mellows out as it warms. Always wanted to try this one. I like how the taste is well balanced and not quite as in your face. Recommended if you like Tripels.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Vetbidder,4.37,"I've been wanting to try this beer and I was not disappointed. Clearly the best Tripel that I've had so far. Beautifully hazy and orange tinged with a nice white head. The scent was Belgian yeast with slight spice. Where this really stands out is the flavor, there is some sweetness and the banana/clove and a wonderful spicy smooth finish. This beer has a unique distinct flavor. There's less carbonation but it's just the right amount for this brew. Creamy and smooth. This is 9%...what??

22,34,Lone_Freighter,4,"Into a chalice, the appearance was a nice golden amber to somewhat orange color with a nice one finger white foamy head that dissipates within less than a minute. The smell had a super nice allocation of iced apples, coriander, some peaches, and a nice Belgian spicy sort of yeastiness invading my nose. The taste was sweet and spicy and said a lot about a somewhat invading pear-like flavoring over top of the apples I previously smelled. I didn’t get any aftertaste but I did get a dry finish. On the palate, it sat about a light to medium and showed a decent sessionable characteristic about it. The carbonation seemed somewhat smooth but still had a decent sharpness running about it. Overall, in my opinion, this was a good Tripel that I would have again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,PlinyMeNow,4.16,"Pours hazy golden and a bit frothy in appearance, which translates into a velvety smooth and somewhat creamy feel. Big rocky white head with lots of lacing. Aroma is of ripe banana and a bit of apple, some yeast and clove. Taste includes banana and bready biscuity malt, yeast, spice, and a little hop dryness but nevertheless treads a tad on the sweet side of balanced. There is a hint of a soapy quality to the taste that is faint and not unpleasant. The finish is extremely balanced and does not linger. Overall: Wow.

Aroma is cloves, bread, and sweet fruit tones (banana, possibly apricot) as is typical of a Belgian style tripel. Smells just slightly boozy.  Tastes a bit more bitter than I was expecting. Not too fruity, definitely taste clove and bread with a hint of sweetness. Does not hide the 9% ABV.  Feel is light and dry but somewhat malty on the finish. Carbonation is pretty high.

22,34,jack_attack,4.47,"Exceptional tasting experience. Was a recommended pairing by the bartender on tap at Hogwash in SF. Being from Washington State it reminded me very much of our exceptional ciders, with somewhat high carbonation and light feel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bwood06,4,"Some friends of my wife and myself were over just a few nights ago and decided to pick this bottle up from a local bottle shop since the NFL games were not going our way. We figured spending our time catching up and talking was more worthwhile than watching two NFL games that were not incredibly fun to watch.  This tripel (spelled on the bottle as Triple) pours a cloudy yellow hue with very high carbonation readily visible, along with a frothy white head that dissipates slowly to a thin lacing that is retained. 4/5 The aroma is quite yeasty with the yeast esters really coming out strongly. White stone fruit, typical Belgian spices, banana, clove, and coriander really come out nicely along with an undertone of earthy hops. 4/5 The flavor is very typical of Belgian style beers in that it is spicy with banana, clove, and white pepper making their appearances. Along with these, notes of light caramel, yeast, white bread, and earthy hops all come out in a layered style. The booziness comes out quite strong initially but then diminishes over time. Bitterness is light and does not linger after swallowing. Although, the yeasty esters really stay around for quite some time. 4/5 A light carbonation burn (although not as much as expected) hits the tongue straight away, with the beer proceeding to then showcase its medium body and wet/coating nature. There is very little dryness and this dryness does not linger. 4/5 This is a very well layered beer that is surprisingly strong in terms of banana and clove for a tripel. The booziness is quite high, as expected, but it is not muted or hidden like many tripels attempt. Very good tripel here and would gladly come back to this one. 4/5",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Fourlives,5,"I used to take trips into Montreal to be able to stop on the way back and grab as much of any Unibroue products as I could legally bring back. Seriously, this is everything I look for in a beer. For being a Tripel, this could very much be a table beer, no matter the ABV, because of it's smooth drinkability, smoothness on the palette and just overall beer goodness. If this is the End of the World, then sign me the hell up because this is where I want base camp.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Appearance: A hazy golden orange colour with a one finger white head that settled to a nice creamy layer and left nice curtain lacing.  Aroma: Juicy orange and mango, biscuity malt with touches of honey and banana.  Taste: Biscuity, banana, honey and orange with a hint of peach. Clove and light peppery spice on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, medium bodied with moderate to low carbonation.  Overall: The citrusy orange was just coming on a bit too strong at times for me.

22,34,Holderness,4.7,"Pours a lovely hazy gold with a big solid white head that lasts, but with little lacing. Cider-like aromas meld perfectly with doughy yeast, honey, rosemary, and a faint maltiness. Remarkably balanced flavors that largely follow the nose. Well carbonated. Overall I would say this is my favorite beer, especially during the colder months. It brings the taste of Belgium to New England AND FOR ONLY $6.50/750ml bottle!  95/100  EDIT (11/23/17): Since last review, I've had this about once every three months and every time it's a winner. Doesn't matter the season, doesn't matter the event, this beer is always worth the money. Mouthfeel is a little more prickly and carbonated that I remember it being (current rating reflects that), but I think that's mostly because I've tried many other bottle-conditioned beers in the interim.  94/100",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Actually, I m not really into Tripel, but this is da bomb!! everything was perfect. good enough foam, carbonation, and mouthfeel was crisp, light, fruity, refreshing.

22,34,MeanMotaScootah,4.25,"Pours a straw - cloudy golden color with a nice three finger head. Aroma is spot on - tons of spice, dark orange, sweet yeasty malt goodness. Taste is incredible for the style. Coriander, cinnamon, plum/apple, candy sugar, and that patented Unibroue yeast with a touch of warm alcohol. IMO this is a strong contender with St. Bernardus Tripel. Everything comes together for this perfect Belgium triple. It's best consumed at 50 degrees - so let it warm a bit if it's been in the fridge with your other stash of beers. If you dig Belgiums - your life is not complete if you don't try this offering from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Aroma is Unibroue Belgian yeast notes of spice, fruity esters of apple, pear, apricot, banana & clove with notes of candied fruit, honey, coriander & alcohol. Taste is similar to the nose but sweet with more aggressive fruity esters. Spicy pepper, coriander & clove throughout the sip. Buttery, peppery & fruity with alcohol warmth & spice in the finish & aftertaste. As is typical the alcohol intensifies as the brew warms.

Apricot, pear, too.  Mouthfeel: Pretty boozy but not unapproachable.  Overall: Good representation of the style.

Mandarin orange.  Holy cloy. Some sickly sweet flavors of banana extract, apple, citrus...it all tastes like extract though. Hot flavors of alcohol and hay, and more extract. Did I get a bad bottle?  Feel is hot and carbonated, with a good dose of creaminess. Hot and dry finish.  Overall...I don't get it. This was way too sweet, artificial, and gross for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,m_hall,4.77,"Poured from a 12 oz Longneck into a tulip glass. a slightly hazy, golden ale, topped by a thick, pillow-y two finger head that falls quite slowly to a lovely film. Lacing is excellent  Nosing brings aromas of biscuit-y malt, fruits (banana, citrus rind) along with the coriander and white pepper tones you'd expect from a Tripel.  This one is very complex on the palate- notes of cracker-like malt come right at you, along with honey, sour apple, caramel, and ripe banana lingering all the way through on the tongue. Spice (clove and pepper especially) comes in a bit after, carrying through to a lingering, tartly dry finish with some woodiness and herbal hop notes (perhaps a bit more hops than I'd expect of a Belgian Tripel.)  Mouth-feel is medium, smooth, creamy, very drinkable. Carbonation is brisk and tingly. Alcohol, even a hefty 9%, is nigh undetectable.  I can't say this is the BEST Tripel out there (after all, I haven't tried them all) but I feel confident in saying it's up on the list- way up- and is definitely the best one I've tried that isn't from the style's homeland. In fact, it's better than most of those... a smooth, drinkable body, excellent nose, and wonderfully complex flavors show the high level of craft that has gone into this, as good as any Abbey brewers could hope for. A masterwork.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Rukeli76,4.46,"341ml bottle served in a tulip glass at cellar temperature.  Pours a slightly hazy light golden colour. Effervescent four-inch head with lots of lacing.  Aroma is dominated by spicy and slightly green stone-fruit yeast esters. Beautiful.  Spicy yeast is the first thing to hit me and lingers throughout each sip. The flavour has lots of fruit. I'm picking up pear and stone fruit (peach and dried apricot). There's an earthy and deeply satisfying over-ripe quality to everything. Nor is there any of the cloying candi sugar sweetness or alcoholic burn you sometimes pick up from tripels in this particular bottle, which has been very well-aged, but I do recall that in fresh bottles of La Fin du Monde in the past.  Prickly carbonation and light mouthfeel. Almost no sensation of alcohol.  What can you say? La Fin du Monde is a world-class tripel, superior to all but a small handful of the well-known Belgian abbeys. I don't drink it very often because the well-hidden booze tends to sneak up on me, but it's always a treat. Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,SargeMcCluck,4.5,"Pours peachy rose-gold. Three fingers of thick head leave islands of lacing.  Nose is unapologetic with the typical tripel aromas of Belgian yeast, mild orange zest, clove, coriander, honey crackers, white pepper, butter, nutmeg, and some sour pear. Partially subdued on the tongue by prominent medicinal phenols, but it does manage to carry much of the nose's promised complexity without any one flavour jumping out to mask the others. This improves vastly as it warms.  Very sweet, very cohesive, oh so drinkable. This is helped along by the mouthfeel - perfectly balanced between medium body, pillowy carbonation, gingery warmth on the breath.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,lwcreasy,4.38,"A beautiful, opaque, mysterious gold. 2-3 inch off-white head with fine bubbles. Solid head retention.  Aroma is quite complex. Start relatively modest (emphasis on ""relatively,"" using this same beer as a point of reference) then explodes. We've got grainy malt, a slight spice that evolves into white pepper, earthy and herbal hop tones, light pome fruit esters (pear is what I get the most on the nose), perhaps a touch of pineapple, and a very small trace of loose-leaf paper. Very interesting, you get something new with each whiff.  First sip... blast-off! Malt is grainy, bagel-like, and a touch toasty. Medium-high in intensity. Earthy, woodsy hops may be there- but some other flavors are winning the battle for prominence. There is the tasty malt, which dances with spiciness and fruit. Pome fruit esters follow the nose- notably a kind of apple tartness, and mellow pear. Each sip is followed by a wonderful aftertaste of spicy white pepper. Quite a mix.  Perfect mouthfeel. Medium body with good carbonation. Zippy throughout. Warming throughout. All of this enhances the glorious, piquant aftertaste. To reiterate- this beer feels perfect in your mouth. Best I've yet had.  I feel this is a beer I will love more and more each time I return to it. An experience!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,Tshane,4.74,"WARNING ⚠️: MEGA-DESCRIPTO-DUMP AHEAD!  Appearance: golden straw and apricot colors. What the heck, it's the same as all of the other reviews.  Smell: REALLY good. Great, even. I have pretty poor taste buds, therefore my sense of smell isn't as good as most reviewers apparently, but I know what I like. This is damn good. I'd have 3 in a row if I could afford them. Not worth a utility payment.  Taste: I sure wish I could taste those esters of banana and alcohol lingering at the back of the palate, the pepper and the spice and the citrus. Well I CAN taste the citrus, it's kind of a cross between grapefruit and lime... subtle.  Nothing about mangoes however. It's not like we went to a Whole Foods Market or a fresh fruit stand in Africa. We are drinking beer for God's sake. It tastes like beer and smells like beer but it's one of the best I've ever tasted. There's kind of a funky ""curl"" feel/taste at the back of each sip that kind of reminds me of wee Scotch ale. It's awesome. I don't know what that is. Maybe someone can elucidate. My coarse taste buds don't give me a visual, so to speak.  Sorry I can't add detail to that. My taste buds are screwed. Sorely lacking. And I'm going to say a version of that statement in pretty much every review I do. I feel inferior in some intrinsic physical way to those who can taste nuances.  Feel: Medium-thick, but of course it's a liquid so it's not that thick. It's not like a smoothie or something. Anyway I think people who drink beer will know what I mean. People who only drink smoothies won't. Sorry dudes, you need to drink some beer to check it out.  Overall: this is an incredibly drinkable beer, complex flavors that I cannot begin to describe even though I'm a word guy. Therefore that tells me my taste buds are screwed and I can't taste things as intensely as many reviewing here. But it's complex and dry but sweetish--but not overpowering sweet-- and citrusy and high alcohol which I totally appreciate! Loooove a buzz! Compared to a Bell's Oberon (not this style, I know), which has way too much bitterness-to-sweetness ratio, it strikes the right balance.  Awesome brew! There might be some things that could be done to make it a five out of five but I could not begin to describe what those are. I can sense them just out of the range of my perception however. Sorry Alstrom Brothers, I can't match your 5 out of 5.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Aroma is soft, very floral, fruity and herbal. I'd imagine this is what the first day of spring should smell like in a bottle. Almost too good for words.  Taste has a fantastic malty, baked bread, yeasty, straw flavour that lays the foundation for the fruity goodness. Apple, pear, nectarine, white grape, banana. Clove, nutmeg, coriander and a hint of ginger give this one a harvest-like feel. Would make for a fantastic holiday brew. Very floral and earthy in the finish. Smooth, creamy and clean.

It poured a hazy golden color with a multi sized bubble two finger head which very slowly dissipated leaving some very nice lacing. In the nose I detected some light nectarine aroma and possibly a bit of lilac. On the palate the carbonation was lively and crisp. In spit of the higher ABV it did not taste boozy to me.

Carbonation clearly visible, with the head rising, not dissipating for a few minutes after pouring.  Aroma: light spice of coriander and some sugary ester, with the yeast being the most prominent aroma here. Little bit of pear and banana perhaps. Either way, a very lovely scent and a light-smelling sweetness all around.  Taste: for a tripel, very light, with subtle fruit flavors all around. Not dark plum and Cherry flavors like you'd get of some traditional tripels, but banana, yeast, and honey. Sweet and malty.  Feel: full-bodied, but also moderate to high carbonation.

Taste - dry pear and coriander, some bready yeastiness, apple skin tartness.  Feel - a dry finish, very effervescent, but I would like more fluffiness in the body (maybe this is due to age).

The white head is thick and fluffy, standing tall but not leaving a whole lot of lacing. After a short while of drinking the head eventually fades out to a short cap.  Aroma: It has the sweet smell of coriander. I don't pick up anything else but the aroma is lovely.  Taste: The flavor of this beer is fantastic. It has a light sweet flavor that is almost like eating pears. I can taste the sweet coriander flavor and there is just a touch of tang but not like a fruity tang that some Belgian yeast has. The beer has very clean flavors.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied and effervescent. The finish is off-dry. It is a very enjoyable and easy drinking beer.  Overall: It is a highly enjoyable tripel. If you enjoy a tripel that includes coriander then I would recommend this to you. It is a bit on the sweeter side but it didn't impede drinkability for me.

22,34,FBarber,4.52,"Revisited on 3/26/22:  Pours a cloudy, mostly opaque light orange color. Thin sudsy white head forms on the beer before settling in and turning into a lovely layer of velvety foam on top of the beer That 1/2 of velvet foam just lingers on the beer and never really dissipates. Aroma is just lovely on this one - notes of clove, belgian yeast, some lemon zest, and some malty notes.  Taste follows the nose with notes of clove, pepper, banana, some bubblegum, with a nice underlying malt character. The spices come out especially on the back end with that pepper and allspice and clove leaving a lingering spicy note on the palate. Feel is remarkable for being very highly carbonated giving it this lively spritzy feel. The beer itself is medium bodied, smooth, and shockingly drinkable for a 9% beer.  Overall this one once again impressed me. Not so much for how good of a Tripel this is as much as the consistency they have shown in brewing such a good Tripel year after year.  _____________________ Pours a hazy golden color with a thick frothy white head. Two fingers that slowly dissipates down to a half finger white foamy head with thick frothy lacing along the glass. Very nice head retention overall.  Smell has aromas of belgian yeast, lemon zest, honey, fresh cut flowers and undertones of a pleasant spice and pepper.  Taste follows the nose with a pleasant mild yeast flavor coming through initially followed by notes of lemon zest and honey. Finish has some spice, clove, and pepper that balances the mild sweetness from the notes of honey. Hops provide a nice floral character to the beer with some mild bitterness on the finish. Really wonderful example of the tripel golden ale. Flavor hides the ABV (9%) dangerously well.  Feel is smooth and creamy. Dry finish makes for a very nice segue into the next sip. Medium carbonation gives the beer a effervescent champaign like feel.  Overall just an outstanding beer. Great example of the style (tripel style golden ale) and great beer on its own.  look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 = 4.34/5 rDev +0.5%",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Malt is prominent with no hop bitterness, and a subtle gingerbread lingers. Alcohol taste is not present.  The beer is very smooth with a light carbonation that lingers on the tongue. Medium body.  Overall, a very good, refreshing beer. Sweeter than Tripels like Chimay White, but not cloyingly sweet.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Wiffler27,4.64,"pours a hazy gold with a thick head. looks fantastic!  smell is nice, nice mellow clove to it. very belgian-y aroma in a good way. but muted, not pure bubblegum or banana.  the taste is amazing. a great combination of Belgian bubblegum yeast, slight banana and clove. very smooth and easy to drink. instantly my favorite tripel, this is some great stuff.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,sjccmd,4.09,"Spicy and fruity. Noticeable clover, white pepper, banana, juicy fruit, chamomile. Light floral honey and grassy hops. Perfumey. Some graham cracker malts. Apples, pears, and citrus fruits. A slight mustiness.  Pours hazy gold with a frothy white head. Good lacing and retention.  Sweet juicy fruit upfront. Pears, fresh apples, bubblegum. Bitterness increases with subsequent sips. Spicy noble-like hops. Honey sweetness. Lots of esters, but some clove and white pepper as well. Very fruit forward. Somewhat sweet.  Medium body, high carbonation. Somewhat silky on the palate, but with lots of tingling bubbles.  More fruit and malt character, less spice as compared to some of my favorite Belgian Tripels, but not a real reason to fault it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,smithnwong,4.87,Best by Oct. of 2017 This is clearly one of the best Belgian-style trippels. Hazy light orange color. Nice head that dissipates quickly leaving a nice web on the glass. Slight sweet citrus up front (or is that peachy?) with a hint of banana. Mid is a light spice with a mild sweetness. Finishes with a balanced malty spice. Great balance between the alcohol content and the sweetness. Just enough hoppiness. This one wants to be consumed while sitting at a tavern in front of a large stone fireplace contemplating the meaning of anything.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Resiferi,4.58,"Wonderful packaging, to start off with, the silver foil topper is a great touch on an already nice bottle.  Pours out with a heavy head that slowly dies down after around 4-5 minutes, leaving a thin foam on a rich straw yellow body. Smells citrus and spicy, hints of coriander and citrus zest dominate.  The taste reflects the smell well, sharp citrus zing with a strong toasted spice undertone, finishing surprisingly light. As other reviews have noted it definitely changes with temperature, acquiring a slightly more bitter edge as it warms, and a thinner mouth feel. Not bad, just a distinct change from it served around 10-12C.  Overall a delicious tripel, expressing layers of flavor as you drink, many more and more complex than commonly seen. Very worthy of it's rating, and as I found it for $1.60, a fantastic deal too.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

And it is! This strong Tripel (9%ABV) as pointed out by previous reviewers is drinkable as hell so watch your step if you're out in Montréal on a winters night.

22,34,KonigObHops,4.62,"The beer pours an extremely light, hazy copper with a pure white head that is about two finger widths that leaves ample Belgian lacing.  The aroma is yeasty with hints of citrus and banana. There is a mild hint of cloves.  The initial taste is sweet with the citrus hitting the tongue right away. In the middle the beer changes little except that the sweetness becomes more evenly balanced with earthy tones. The beer finishes with the a hint of banana and clove mixed in with a light maltiness.  The mouthfeel of this beer is crisp, light and refreshing.  Overall this is a really good triple. It is so light and subtle that you will not notice the 9% abv!

Smell- distinct, direct but light with smooth spices  Taste- Fresh, hints of coriander suttel spices that tie together with ease  Feel- Light, but fills the pallet with a gigantic taste but not overpowering, feels rich initially but then sits well, lushes.  Overall- Tastes like a beer I'd want to have a conversation with, a stranger, but feels like I've known you my whole life. Well traveled but not full of it self. Very interesting personality, has a lot to know and understand but doesn't throw it all at you right away.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

It head coats the sides of the class before gravity turns it into webbing.  Smell -- Strong banana and clove with hints of bubblegum. There is a malty breadiness and some lemony tartness coming through.  Taste -- Nice hoppy bitterness join the characteristics of the nose along with a warming alcohol that peeks through.  Feel -- Nice carbonation balance with the medium body and keeps it from coat or clinging.  Overall -- A fantastic tripel. If you like those Belgian yeast estery qualities and want something that packs a punch alcohol wise you should give it a try.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,trackerdave,4.63,"One of the best Tripels I have ever tasted. Tried it after reading positive reviews on BA. This is a bottle conditioned ale that (IMHO) needs to be poured like directed on Unibroue's web site; they recommend the yeast be mixed into the beer by gently turning the bottle upside down. Make sure you pour it into a glass that will not only allow an appreciation of the floral/citrus notes, but that will also accommodate a sizable head. Goes down very smooth, extremely drinkable. Turned my son-in-law, who was predominately an IPA fan, into someone who has now testing other Belgian ales by having him try this brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,HotDogBikeRide,4.8,"Poured from a bottle dated best by 10-26-18, so i'm drinking it really fresh it would appear. Pours a very bubbly bright white head and a golden lightly carbonated, wheat-beer body. Lacing is webby and sporadic. Smell is kind of like licorice and root beer hard candy, mixed with clove-like spices, but very ale-like and sophisticated, not gimmicky. Wheat-backbone carries the spiced, refreshing, fruity esters down the throat. Pears, maybe I'm just imagining, but this is a really next-level beer that always is peeling back another layer to reveal more interesting and unique attributes. Highly recommended, it's like a unique, spiced wheat beer that hides its alcohol better than anything I've ever tried. It manages to accomplish these things subtletly while maintaining OG wheat beer characteristics, unlike anything I've tried. Cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,princessbay710,5,"Licorice and root beer candies is what the first sip gives me. It reminds me of my childhood, drinking a old soda pop, but cutting the sugar. Grown up and sophisticated.

This is a future desert for me when I don't want something sweet.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Beginner2,4.26,"At the top of the Tripel category with 2,954 reviews and double the Hads as the Belgian masters, I'm highly unlikely to add much value in a review. I ditto those who favor this ale among Unibroue's fine collection.  But, I also will offer this comment: as the Fin Du Monde warms during the meal, it really becomes two distinct ales, though obviously related. When the food is spicy, the beer cools and calms the palate along the way. (I last had this ale with Thai pad thai.) But with more normal spiced/herbed European food, this tripel complements the food... particularly as the meal finishes. This ale's flavors get stronger as it warms and it boosts this process if you pour the yeast in at end of the bottle.  Interestingly, MJ's 1999 edition gave this 2.5 stars out of 4. (I wonder if this recipe and brewer has improved significantly in two decades... or if MJ missed this one.) MJ gave simple, short reviews (who I could learn from). For La Fin, it was: ""suggestions of honey and anise."") I interpret the master's reviews as saying: KISS, Keep It Simple & Short.  4/11/16 Tasted again... news flash... The alcohol interferes with the taste of the tomato/basil sauce; really overwhelmed the food at the end. Next time, I'll try this as prelude to the food. As for the 4 pack I just bought, I think I'll store the remaining 3 for the 2018 date and see if it cools off.  9/7/16 True to form, I did not save the rest of the 4 pack for another year... but that is just as good. I had the 4th with a pesto pasta dish and think that the five months did this ale well and the carbonation moderated so the food could stand on its own. Because of all the pepper, don't drink this beer young with mild foods. Let the beer's peppery flavors mellow a few months and pair it with spicier foods. There is good reason why this ale is so popular: great to drink, interesting to pair.  2/5/17 Again, a great dish to pair with tomato and herbal sauces. This bottle had a year left on its BB date and the bubbles were moderated.  6/9/17 Part of the my personal ""Best North American Commonly-Available Tripel"" taste-off contest that ended in the conclusion that this and Allagash's are in the same league as the best Belgiums; but I'm leaning toward Allagash on the basis of more moderate spicing. But, it really depends on the day's heat and meal.  5/28/18 Memorial Day picnic. For a bottle that had about 18 months left on its BB date (which I regard as this brew's optimum range.) You can't go wrong with Fin Du Monde. Everyone wanted a second bottle.  8/19/19 Fin Du Monde competes with my top 3 go-tos for table beers (the other two are saisons.) So I need to stop adding to this review and rewrite a review for this masterpiece... because now, it even pairs well with a mild Indian biriyani !  3/12/20 Revised reviews slightly. Great as La Fin is, it still has its only serious problem of concealing its alcohol as it warms.

Taste: opens up opens with a little bit of banana mixing with pear. phenols take over with a good amount of clove and a lesser amount of pepper. malts are nice and sweet, ranging from a pale/pilsner to a little bit of caramel. small amount of alcohol plays in near the end.  Mouthfeel: moderately bodied. easily drinkable but better when enjoyed slowly. small amount of warming and lingering alcohol. light lingering sweetness and yeastiness.

The head has a particularly interesting appearance to me, wherein rather than looking like one singular entity, it looks like it's composed of a large amount of small individual bubbles that just happen to interlock. Anywho, great appearance.  Smells of banana, caramel, Belgian yeast. The fruity aspect of this smell is definitely very present.  The taste is generally quite similar to the smell. Taste is subdued, yet very appealing. Mouthfeel is dry, with high carbonation.  I am not that familiar with the style since earlier, but the few examples I've had (Chimay White etc) have all been disappointing to me. This is not. Very satisfying taste, which is both simple and nuanced at the same time - with a drinkability that makes you forget the 9% ABV. Most excellent!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Taste threw me off because it didn't follow the nose as much as I'd thought it would. I expected more sour and yeast but was surprised by how sweet and mild it was.

22,34,BenGap,4.7,Poured a cloudy golden color with an opaque-ness that seemed to glow when held to the light. There was a very fluffy white two finger head that showed traces of unfiltered yeast in the foam. The smell was intriguing with a yeasty zest mixed with some fruity banana or pear and a hint of spiciness. The taste started out with some fruity banana notes again with a heavy yeast that faded into a excellent malt character with just a hint of hops.

As it warmed, I also tasted the banana that others mention. There's a little hop at the end. It's delicious. This ale is highly carbonated and the 9% ABV really kicks.

Infusing the brew with a heavy clove and citrusy flavour, the brew is finely balanced between sweet, fruity flavours and a crisp, hoppy kick. A hefty dosing of malts however builds up a thorough base for the rest of the flavours to sit on. If you haven't had one of these before, do not make the mistake of thinking that the fruit flavours are akin to macrobrewed ""Apple light"" pseudobeers. This is a 100% tripel through and through.  Perfect nose, perfect feel (while highly carbonated, the feel has a noticeable body), incredible smell. Do not drink this fine brew too cold, as the clove and alcohol flavours punch through a little too much at this temperature. Treat it as though it was a dark beer and drink at 8-13 degrees.  In homage to the great explorers who have discovered the new world; in homage of the great nation of Canada -- I raise you a filled glass of Le Fin du Monde. Cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Bluemarmot,5,"What a beautiful beer! Poured into a tulip and immediately I wish I could just climb in there and live in the glass. The Belgian trippel is my current favorite thing and this one is set to ruin me... Oh well. The smell, the taste, the feel...all off the charts. I had been looking forward to trying this one for quite some time and I am not in any way disappointed. Wow. Well done and a huge thanks to Unibroue!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,gotweid,4.83,"1st surprise was when I popped the cap off. There was such a force I thought it would gush out. Light gold in color with thick head and lots of carbonation. Aroma is without a doubt what you would expect from this style, malty, hint of spice. Taste is out of this world. Bold flavors of malt, spice, grain but not overpowering, just full of flavor. Goes down too easy considering its bold flavors & strength, this will knock you over if you're not careful. A beer to savor every sip. Perfection.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Justglkn,4.43,"Poured into tulip glass.  Appearance: Light hazy golden straw color. Foamy head that dissipates quickly. Delicate lacing. Smell: Smells sweet of Banana, apricot, peaches, pear ,apple, and sugar. Towards the end it smells strongly of peach. Taste: Sweet with lots of fruit notes. Banana, apricot, and peach. Mouthfeel. Crisp and smooth.  I absolutely loved this beer! Really good favors and smells incredible. The alcohol is very well hidden. Gets better and better the more you sip on it. More champagne like than other tripels I've had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Oh_Dark_Star,4.06,"Had to try this one with it's outstanding reviews. I love Tripels with some good carbonation, but this one was really carbonated to the point to tasting a little tinny. Overall a good Tripel and while I'm left wondering if they are as much my style as I've always though - I must conclude that this is the best of the beers I've had out of Canada so far.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,Back_in_the_Saddle,4.36,"Ah, the famous La Fin Du Monde. Ah, who hasn’t had this? Haha, no worries. I’ve had this more than enough times to say something on this. Here goes and just about every time I’ve had this into a chalice. The appearance was a nice golden amber to somewhat orange color with a nice one finger white foamy head that dissipates within less than a minute. The smell had a super nice allocation of iced apples, coriander, some peaches, and a nice Belgian spicy sort of yeastiness invading my nose. The taste was sweet and spicy and said a lot about a somewhat invading pear-like flavoring over top of the apples I previously smelled. I didn’t get any aftertaste but I did get a dry finish. On the palate, it sat about a light to medium and showed a decent sessionable characteristic about it. The carbonation seemed somewhat smooth but still had a decent sharpness running about it. Overall, in my opinion, this was a good Tripel that I would have again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Cmun01,4.43,"I have always loved this beer. Has been around before there were micro-brews. Nice abbey style triple ale. Light, and a has a little alcohol smell. Better than most high end Belgium beers. Cannot go wrong with anything from this brewery.

Nice banana and clove from the yeast. Little fruit notes, it don't really love the fruity notes however. Extremely smooth and crisp at the end. Nothing bad to say about this beer. It's just really good. Good job Canada, thought this was from Belgium!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,SitkaSteve,4.45,"This was poured into a chalice. The appearance was a moderately hazy golden orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than about a minute. Lacing seemed to spider web nicely. The smell had Belgian yeast coming across in a slight bready sweetness and spice. Banana, iced apples, a little bit of cherries and a light dose of pears make a nice sweet combination in this one. The taste took the sweetness of the Belgian yeast and re-branded itself into the flavor as somewhat spicy allowing the previously mentioned fruits to overcome and be the force in the flavor. There's a nice subtle sweet aftertaste of the fruits with a little bit of spice. The mouthfeel had a medium body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation seems to hit right as I get enough harshness on my tongue but nothing detracting from the flavor. Overall, hey hey hey, bombs away, a stellar tripel not from Belgium, but of course I'd love another. Now cue R.E.M.'s ""its the end of the world"" as we know while I go and drink another because if Fat Albert found out about this one, Unibroue might have to up their tank production of this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,JackieTH,4.46,"Hazy light golden brew with a big foam that fades quickly. Smells like banana bread and cloves, delicious. Taste is banana, clove, roasted marshmallow, bubblegum, it's very good. Mouthfeel is medium but it's very brightly carbed so it seems lighter than it is. Overall I can't say much more except that this is a very tasty well done beer par for the style IMO.

22,34,foundersfan1,4.55,"Appearance: Light orange tint filled with a full 1 1/2 inches creamy white head.  Aroma: The fruit and spices (especially) jump out of the glass for such a high ABV brew.  Flavor: Full of pepper with apricots and lighter fruits throughout, almost a green apple hidden in there.  Mouthfeel: Sweet and smooth all the way through, leaves a slight tingling sensation. This is nothing like the devastating mouthfeel of most american tripels that I am used to.  Overall: I can understand the insistence of picking this up as a starter to heavier belgian styles that is widely available. I am not quite sure this is the benchmark on anything and everything a Belgian tripel should be, I will do more research and report back.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,EricVonStein,4.58,"Rich cloudy golden sun, full of ascending bubbles. A ginger of fluffy white head sits and stays on top. A ray of sunshine.  Nose takes a minute to figure out. Really beautiful fruity and spicy yeast character, aside a buttery, apricot fruit. Promises of good things to come.  Banana, apricot, clove, even peppery with a nicely sharp tart yeast hit in the middle. Buttery character is there tying it all in. plenty of warming in the back. Nice and smooth, fuzzy fizzy carbonation dances all over.  Classic, complex, rich, balanced. Everything you want in triple - fruit, yeast and spice in perfect harmony.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BARx3,4.86,"I enjoy beers, and follow this site to determine which new beers to try. I generally do not like ""fruity"" beers.  This beer has a very obvious apricot taste. It is also very sweet.  Can't say that I have ever had a tripel before, but what I can say, is the only reason this beer does not receive a 5 in all categories is that the apricot taste remains with me all night no matter what beers I drink.  This is an absolute must try beer, and deserves every mark that it gets.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,Secondfiddle7,4.09,"Like all Unibroue beers, this one is highly carbonated, almost champagne-like. It is not an all occasion beer, at 9.0 ABV, but when it's right it's right. The packaging is impressive, I enjoy giving this as gifts, and it's got a certain undeniable something. I wanted to love this beer, but have to admit that while it is very good I do not know if I consider it a world-class beer. I am willing to assume that I am un-worldly. But I know what I like and there are many beers that I prefer. Each time I go back to it expecting to be surprised, I remember that it has let me down before. Your mileage may vary, and I honestly hope it does. I respect this beer, but I do not love it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S: Typical Belgian funk, some malt and biscuit with some dried fruits in there for good measure  T: Absolutely Phenomenal, begins with the typical semi-sweet malt, but it feels lighter and hits more across the palate, fades into a bit of hop/citrus, even kind of a witbier-like taste as well, and finally finishes with a nice peppery dryness  F: Its a bottle-conditioned ale, so expect a medium body with a high amount carbonation  O: All I can say is I have not heard a peep about this beer other than reading some review for another Belgian, so I got it on a whim because it was on sale. ""Holy S**t"" were the first words uttered after the first sip, this beer is amazing and needs to be hyped up because it is more than worthy of the praise. Probably the premiere example of the style as well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,Czequershuus,4.79,"This beer pours a slightly hazy(once you pour in the yeast, yum) deep yellow with a copious head. The aroma is classic - overripe banana leads the way, followed by clove, and rounded out by the always unusual bubblegum. The flavor leads with a sweet bubblegum, followed by a wheat like flavor, with a spicy clove and cinnamon finish. This is a beast of a beer. I love Tripels, and this is a magnificent example of the style. What else can you say about a modern classic.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Loco-JoCo,5,"For a long time this was my all time favorite beer. That was when I almost exclusively drank Belgian beer and Stouts. Although it has fallen from my top spot I still have to say it is my favorite Belgian style beer and in my top ten. The mouth feel, the gentle sweetness, the smell and color all do it for me and I remember the first time pulling the glass away from my lips and me saying ""this is the BEST beer I have ever had!""

It smelled good, looked great, and tasted great. Definitely a beer I would recommend trying if you can.

22,34,mkh012,4.6,"Pours cloudy yellow.  The nose is fairly mild. I get crisp yeastiness and spicy mulled fruit.  The taste is apple, pear, clove, white wine, and breadiness, maybe even some tropical fruit.  Nice medium-bodied mouthfeel.  This really is a world class beer. An instant favorite and one I'd seek out again. At 9% ABV, it is complex and hard-hitting but has absolutely zero off-putting qualities. The best tripel I've had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,303beer,4.59,"Pours a cloudy yellow with a thick rocky head. About 3 inches of head out of a bomber bottle. Has the classic sweet triple smell to it. Wow that's amazing. It has a very light awesome taste to it. Again it's light. It takes a minute to develop the flavor on your tounge. This is the lightest 9% beer I've ever had. So smooth. Can't taste the alcohol at all. It is fully developed and we'll aged. Just done right beer. Amazing. Leaves lots of lacing down the glass. If you find this, buy this. I found a bomber for 10 bucks. It's worth it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Trevor11,4.5,"Overrated, but it is possible that I am just not accustomed to the style of beer. It kind of leaves this filmy, undesirable after taste that I could do without, but otherwise enjoyable. I liked it but probably won't buy it again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Crisp and well carbonated  Overall: I am typically not a belgian fan, but between this and trois pistoles, Unibroue has turned me on to them. They are very rich and complex yet clean brews. It must be the yeast strain that i favor. Or perhaps that the sweetness balances very well with the yeast. I will be coming back to them when i want a belgian style beer",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,The_Kriek_Freak,4.04,"It pours golden and with a lovely creamy head of a very long retention. Aroma is spicy and sweet, with Belgian yeast dominating.

22,34,CanadianBacon,4.66,"Ok guys so funny enough this was my first craft beer way back now but I had never given it a full review because back then I was shy and just learning... so here we go.  Appearance - This beer pours a hazy golden orange in color the haze changes depending on whether you pour in the yeast (it is bottle conditioned) or not. It also pours with a duvel like huge foam head some times 4 fingers worth and that head doesn't fade for a good while. It is getting a 5 for looks because this is what I expect of a tripel.  Aroma - Banana, clove a bit of apple and bread Belgian yeast. my review here is short and simple but again what more can you ask for from a tripel, I do find westemalle slightly more complicated so its gonna get a 4.5  Taste - A zesty apple takes the for front of the flavor behind that comes banana, Clove gives almost an onion spice and the backbone again is fresh baked white bread from the yeast.  Feel - Mothfeel also keeps its 4.75 rating because it is so simple and perfect. It is medium, not too heavy not too light carbonation feels quite moderate considering the head that first appeared and it is mid range between dry and sweet.  Overall - I'm guessing this review may actually make my rating slightly lower but I will say this. This beer is a great starting point for most people. It is rated one of the best tripels in the world for a reason, because it literally epitomizes the style with its belgian counterparts. If you live in Canada as well you have the upside of this being an extremely affordable brew. For the price here in Quebec there really isn't much better.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Great for a Belgian, bottle-conditioned beer.  S: There are lots of clove, coriander, white pepper, and bread from the yeast. Also lots of lemon, orange, and sugar from the malt and candied sugar. Great.  T: Follows the nose. Lots of spices interspersed with sweet candied sugar and lemon and orange peel.  F: Nice and bready but also sufficiently crisp and well-carbonated.

22,34,untitledeuphoria,4.39,"Best Before 11.17.17. Drank 7.26.15. Poured from a 12oz bottle to a Tulip.  A: This beer can appear two different ways depending on whether you leave out the sediment or not. As for myself, I always swish it up, getting all of that cloudy goodness into the glass. That being said, it pours a deep golden straw with a fast riding three finger head. A wall of visible carbonation along the glass, riding to a slow fading head, leaving only a thick collar. Hold this up to the light and it damn nears glows.  S: Ripe bananas and spicy clove. Sweet malt (almost pear like?) buried by yeast... coriander, pepper. Aroma gets more interesting and complex with every passing minute of warming.  T: Spicy clove, sweet stone fruits, Belgian yeast, lemon bitterness, grassy. Enjoyable alcohol warmth. Improves as it warms, but starts to fall apart as it reaches room temperature... keep it chilled.  M:Medium body, very prickly carbonation, very noticeable alcohol warmth... and as others have said, it is an enjoyable effect.

Smells of an intriguing blend, featuring clove, cardamon, white pepper and slightly spiced dried fruit, especially lemon.  Has a high, very lively carbonation, enabling the peppery and sweeter spices and a very soft, dough ending. Drinks best in small sips, as for its intense spice profile.  Dough yeast brings peppery spices immediately to the palate, balanced by wild honey and spring flowers. Rock sugar adds to the prominent spices, almost creating a short burn, evoked by the high carbonation and the higher alcohol, gently coated up by the soft yeast. Finishes with rock sugar, amping up the spices even more, bringing back a flowery note and well pronounced clove.  Well working, old school triple, featuring a very pronounced spiciness, which defines the beer's taste throughout.

22,34,JackRWatkins,2.89,"i'm just gonna opine on this one since there's no basic description info I could add that has not already been said. I don't get the hype here, it isn't bad but it relies way too heavy on its yeast and has a very weak malt back bone, this causes the beer to both smell and taste fishy, it is not a bad beer, but I would in no way call it a good one, I've had quite a few tripels and I won't be buying this again, gonna age a few to see if it helps, but as I said before, this beer wears it's yeast on it's sleeve and allows it to do all of the heavy lifting, making the beer feel unbalanced, this beer tastes like three things, yeast, clove and banana, that's it.  Parting shot: if you've had tripels before and are considering this one. Don't waste your time. If you've never had a tripel before, don't let this be your first.

22,34,TH28,4.22,"330ml bottle. Appearance: Cloudy pale golden with a frothy white foam cap. Aroma: Strong clove phenols dominate over fruity esters of banana and pineapple. Taste: Sweet rich maltiness and banana esters up front. Strong clove phenols. Typical pear esters appear on the swallow. Motuthfeel: Medium body with some creaminess and moderately high carbonation. Not as carbonated as some other tripels, but also avoids alcohol heat. Finish: Clove spice on the swallow, but banana and pear esters longer long after.

22,34,doktorhops,4.3,"With R.E.M’s It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine) blaring in my own private stereo, aka my brain, I approach the beer titan that is La Fin Du Monde, a brew with a reputation so mighty that a bottle of this in Australia retails for an eye-watering arm-and-a-leg $11.50 for a single 355ml bottle, when you know that it sells for at least 50% less than that in Quebec. Anyway, the life of an arm-chair jet-setting beer blogger is a pricey one... nonetheless I have it and I’m gonna review it, and there’s nothing I can do to quell the mounting hype inside my head.  Poured from a 355ml bottle into a Duvel tulip.  A: Hazed pale gold body with a boisterous 2 cm fluffy white head that settles to a thin lace on top. Not bad La Fin Du Monde, or shall we simply call you ‘La Fin’ (laughing) for the rest of the review? Yes? Good. 8/10.  S: Aroma is more Witbier than Tripel with notes of coriander, candi sugar, clove and orange peel, not that I’m complaining, I love a good sharp Wit (I’m thinking of brewing a Witbier and calling it “Shakespeare’s Wit”, too much?). Hints of tartness lurk in the background and give the impression of a nice complex flavour profile. 8/10.  T: The Wit characters give way to that classic Tripel sugar rush, as the pumping beat of Röyksopp’s Compulsion (playing on my actual stereo) drives that glucose-induced high into my bloodstream. It’s not a massive sugar-bomb though, there is a certain restraint to the sugar hit not oft seen even from Belgian brewers. Rounding out the sugar are those coriander/clove notes, pepper, some orange peel, and a mild citric bitterness. Finish is a balance between pepper spice and bitterness, très bien. 9/10.  M: Medium bodied, a tad lighter than expected from 9% ABV but decent enough, with a medium sharp carbonation. 8/10.  D: So the question on everyone’s lips RE: La Fin, are we laughing now? i.e. does La Fin live up to the “World Class” hype? Yes and no, it’s a great brew, no doubt about that, but for the price Belgian brews such as Tripel Karmeliet trump La Fin completely, that is to say - there isn’t enough happening in La Fin to make it that much more worth it compared to TK. If the price were to drop down to TK’s Australian retail price of $6.90 then we would have a competition on our hands. As it is I’m glad I had the chance to try this brew, and I’ll stick to TK for my Tripel fix for now. 9/10.  Food match: Poached Loin of Lamb with Jerusalem Artichoke Puree or Poutine.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Classic tripel nose with a bit of clove and subtle sweet fruit notes.  Medium body with a bit of creaminess. Nicely carbonated with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a nice prickly rush in the finish.  The flavor profile is intense, somewhat complex and somewhat balanced. It begins with some fruit flavors that are quickly overcome by phenolic clove. Phenolic clove dominates from almost the start. The middle brings a bit of malt sweetness but never achieves balance. The somewhat dry finish has a medicinal clove characteristic that lingers. Alcohol also shows a bit of astringency as an aftertaste as it warms.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The effervescence though was strong and throughout the drink there was a stream of bubbles rising to the top. The aroma is very gentle. It has a gentle clover fragrance. It is like setting out a blanket in a park in a field of clover, but you have to stretch your head beyond the blanket to smell the fragrance of the clover flower. The beer has a slight pear and small orangy tinge of taste. The end of the taste though with each sip is spicy, but balanced to the touch.

22,34,dmgeng,4.3,"Finally got one of these. This is probably the most widely available and most acclaimed Belgian beer in the world.  A - Pours like champagne! Nice deep golden color. Huge white head with fine bubbles that explode out of solution even with a slow pour. Slightly cloudy from the yeast and the lacing/head-retention are ridiculous (just stays forever).  S - Lots of the typical Belgian yeast spice character (phenolic) predominant. Just underneath that is a nice sweet malt character, graininess, and some slight alcohol but probably just because of the effervescence.  T - On the tongue the Belgian character holds true but isn't the only player with lots of the sweet malt. It has great depth of flavor without being too heavy handed on any trait. It's a moderately complex beer that is very drinkable. The finish is mostly crisp with some slight sweetness but dry enough to quench the palate.  M - Medium mouth-feel. Extremely high carbonation. One of the highest carb'd beers that I've ever seen that didn't start gushing when I popped the cap. The higher carb lent itself to the drinkability making the body lighter and making the flavors pop, but in this case the carb seemed prickly on the tongue and did leave an acidic tang.  Overall, a tremendous beer. I would say this is probably one of the most stylistically perfect beers that I've had. I liked how the Belgian flavor was the show but there were so many other flavors that were balanced and individual but culminated into one very good beer. I would prefer Chimay White but this one deserves big respect and would always be a welcome beer.  Glass- Goblet",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

As I continued to drink, I realized more and more that there really wasn't any faults I could find to this beer. It was very enjoyable.

This is all balanced by mildly bitter grassy and herbal flavors and alcohol. Toasty, biscuity malt base. Peppery and slightly medicinal phenols. Powdery yeast throughout. Finish is doughy and herbal.  M: Medium-thick body. Full, round, and creamy-soft. Fine carbonation scrubs firmly but gently. Awesome texture, very well structured.  O: As close to perfection as it gets. Bar none one of the most well-structured and well-balanced brews out there. Its potency commands respect, and when sipped slowly and contemplated it offers a most memorable and rewarding experience. A must-drink for any enthusiast of Belgian-style beers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,arvidkoval,4.33,"Hazy orange. Small white head. Smell is fantastic; belgian yeast esters throwing out sweet banana aromas, maybe some funky apple and a hint of orange. This tastes sweet, banana like and just a hint of booze. Highly carbonated, and a warming sensation from the alcohol. This is an outstanding tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,10Crumra,4.38,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Best before date of March 14th 2016.  Poured a murky, light golden color with a 1-2 inch white head. Nice lacing.  Aroma is light and citrusy with some malt and fruit notes. I notice some grapefruit smells along with crackers.  A hoppy, fruity taste at the front is followed by stronger malty, biscuity flavors. Slight bitterness but nothing overwhelming. Has a medium-bodied mouthfeel with a decent amount of carbonation.  Overall this is a great beer that definitely hides its 9% alcohol. It really is quite refreshing for a heavier beer, almost like a lager or pilsner, but it has way more flavor than most beers in those categories.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,MaineBrewing,4.44,"A - poured a translucent haze of gold with almost two fingers of large bubbled fizzy white head. Head dissipated somewhat quick to leave little bit of a collar. Good amount of legs, no lacing.  S - aroma is very yeast forward with a nice peppery bouquet of Esther's with lots of fruit notes, mostly banana with some apple. Slight medicinally and sweet. Not too much alcohol but is present.  T - taste is just amazing, for a triple it is really sweet opposite of the supper attenuated versions I'm used to, not a bad thing... Tastes sort of like an imperial Saison without all the dryness I expected. Lots of fruity notes, mostly banana throughout. Ends in a nice quenching bitter, can't stop going back for more.  M - surprisingly crushable for the abv, this does not want me to sip it, I should have poured it in a pint glass... Drinks like a refreshing Saison or the like.  O - I think this is great, it is different from what I would expect in a triple, being hazy and more on the sweet side, but that by no means takes away from how great this is. It has a great complex fruity Belgian yeast character and is very refreshing. I had this first probably 9 or so years ago when I first started getting into craft, and didn't like it then.... Now this has got to be one if not my favorite triples.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,dcscientist,4.46,"Had this in a bottle and really enjoyed it. I've been getting more into Belgians lately, and this Tripel was a strong representative of the style. Great balance and very well crafted. It's dangerous because it's 9% ABV but you don't feel the alcohol, so be careful! But do make sure you try this if you find it anywhere, because it's well worth it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mabermud,4.05,"This is actually my second Belgian style beer I have ever had, so unfortunately I cannot really compare it to anything.  It's golden-orange with a white wispy head. It smells like champagne. Some funky, banana, and clove in the taste, all nicely balanced. This beer is chewy with fine dense carbonation.

I have opened up a whole new beer chapter.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,Andrew041180,4.43,"Finally giving this one a go - previously not a huge fan of Tripel style.  Pours hazy golden with a towering head considering how gingerly I poured. Bubbly visible carbonation helps to maintain the head for quite a while. Some pretty lace. Great aroma. Strength as well as quality. More of a grainy scent with very little sweetness. Taste follows the nose. Very well balanced in all directions. No one characteristic leaps out at me. Wonderful feel. Medium-bodied with a dry, tingly finish. No discernible alcohol at all. If you're scared off by sweet bubblegum Tripels this one is for you.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,ConnorLivings,4.7,"Heard noting but good things about this beer and have been wanting to try it for a while. Poured into a tulip. Nice 3 finger head that dissipated rather quickly with minimal lacing. Amazing nose, lots of clove, banana, cinnamon...and hints of apricot, pine, and orange.

Medium body, medium-light carbonation, a really delicious spiced beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Harvest06,4.5,"La Fin Du Monde is ""The End of the World"" in French.  12 oz bottle Served at cellar temp around 55F in a wine glass.  A: Golden color, slightly cloudy, large head, gong retention and sticky lacing.  S: Pleasant fruit and spice aromas of banana, cloves, no one aroma is overpowering. Very enjoyable aroma. Much less coriander aroma than in most triples, the banana and cloves aromas are also subdued.  T: Begins with pleasant sweet malt, middle is fruit esters from Belgian yeast, finishes with a slight warming and mild bitter finish with spices lingering for a slightly dry finish. ABV well hidden. Flavors increase as it warms.  M: Medium body, very high carbonation - but not too high for the style.  O: An everyday Tripel. Very good, very drinkable, abv hidden very well. My go to Tripel. Very affordable for the style. Not as complex or interesting as some Trappist ales from Belgium - this one is made by everyday brewers, not by monks, but this is very good and about the same price as a ""premium domestic"". Definitely my favorite Tripel in this price point and I like the simplicity of it.  These are bottle conditioned with high abv so could be cellar-ed. Weather they improve with age is unknown to me although the Unibroue website claims its best after 3 years in the cellar.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Franziskaner,4.15,"Straw golden colored with a murky complexity that is impenetrable to light. Aroma is Belgian yeast,orange peel,and coriander.

22,34,Bunman3,4.12,"Pours beautifully - cloudy gold in a glass with a substantial, frothy white head that lingers throughout. Yeasty nose - definitely leaning toward the blood orange spectrum for smell. This beer tastes delightful - akin to a freshly baked loaf of bread, but with a peppery and dry finish. The heavy alcohol content is well hidden and this beer sneaks up on you. This would be a delightful beer to pair with a Christmas ham, which is exactly what I plan to do.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,remy28,4.05,"The end of the world...a solid non Trappist tripel. It as good as it is ubiquitous, meaning it is the everyday tripel (if there can be such a thing). Heavy taste of banana and clove, mouth-feel is nearly perfect. Drank in the past, drinking now, and will drink in the future; not a perfect beer but a damn good one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,constantine_272,4.05,"Looks great. Nice bright vibrant golden color. Big pillowy frothy white head.  Smells zippy and citrusy. With a rich gaminess of mushrooms and maybe even fresh eggs. Some coriander is definitely present.  The smell deceives the taste as the spice and gaminess yields to more of a bread yeast flavor. Earthy richness rounds out the yeast and the finish is surprisingly salty. Frankly the bread yeast is a bit too bold.  Mouthfeel is syrupy and thick. Quite viscous and a big filling beer. Saltiness again adds to dryness.  This is a nice example of a triple considering it is actually Canadian. I'm curious where the yeast came from. Overall it might have been a tad too yeasty which took away from some of the drinkability.  Edit: First review was December 13, 2014; I bought another and cellared it for nearly 2 years. The viscous texture appears to have now thinned out which was my biggest drawback before. I now detect more tart fruit on the finish as well with pear and apricot and a buttery oak finish that contrasts with a lively prickly tart spicy finish. If you have the patience, I recommend cellaring a bottle, I really like the results. I may just give it another try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Very effervescent maintaining a 1/4 inch head throughout. Kind of a sour bready aroma. Taste was a bit more sour than I expected and lingered on the tongue. Nice round mouthfeel and well-hidden alcohol. It is a well-crafted beer but I don't understand this as the highest rated Tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Mouthfeel: light to medium bodied, frothy, with a slightly wet finish and some alcohol burn.  Flavor: lots of spice (mainly cloves & cinnamon), a bit of banana, bread dough akin to a sweet roll, some mild hops for balance.

22,34,fscottkey,3.69,A: [4.00] The beer is straw yellow with a 1 finger white head. The bubbles on the head are tight but dissipate quickly. Even after the head is gone there is great coating and lacing on the glass. The bottle lists the ABV (9.0%) and the best by date (not sure if it is April 12 or Dec 4th 2016)  S: [3.00] Wheat and yeast. Some alcohol.  T: [4.00] Out of the fridge - very typical Belgian wheat flavor. There is a wheat and yeast flavor and not much else. There is a slight taste of alcohol - it is not completely hidden. As the beer warms the sweetness of the malt comes out. The wheat and yeast flavors subside there are hints of bubble gum and banana. It becomes much more enjoyable. It is a totally different beer when it is warm. Really desirable.  M: [3.75] Nice carbonation level - feels rich on the tongue.  O: [3.75] Out of the gate this was a typical yeasty mess. But as it warmed the body and flavor came out. It was really enjoyable. I'd like to age a few of these and see how they change. This is a really good brew. The alcohol isn't totally hidden - but that is okay. The taste migrates away from the wheat/yeast bomb and has complex tones of banana and bubble gum.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,dd43,4.17,"What a difference a few years of beer drinking experience makes. The first time I had this, it was served cold in a mason jar at a bar which had no real expertise in serving Belgian style beer. I finally picked up a single bottle of this and poured myself a head capped tulip at 45 degrees and the experience was transformative in relation to the first time.  Beautiful in the glass. Nice fat head of medium sized bubbles, not dense but still substantial. Aromas of banana and Belgian candied sugar. There is a baking spice as well, can't decide between allspice and clove. I get a honey biscuit flavor in addition to that sweetness from the candied sugar, which is not to say that this is a diabetes bomb. It's not that at all. Belgian yeast is present in aroma and flavor, it's unmistakeable and appropriate for the style.  Mouthfeel is really nice, smooth despite being well carbonated. This beer is fun to watch in the glass, it kind of gives you a show as it fizzes for the duration of the pour. Booze notes are available if you concentrate on them but they're easy to gloss over if you aren't motivated to pay attention to that sort of thing.  If you want a Belgian tripel that wasn't made in Belgium, you have a few choices in North America and you wouldn't go wrong with choosing La Fin Du Monde. A well made beer that deserves your consideration.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,SHDoyle,4.27,"Description: Bright golden color with a finger and half of white head. Carbonation is apparent from the view alone, with lots of tiny bubbles rising. The smell is spicy and zesty although I don't know that I could pin it down to a specific smell. A bit of sweetness and fruit comes through on the aroma as well. Taste is consistent with the aroma: spicy with some hints of peach, apricot and floral notes. Just a faint bit of bitterness or grapefruit on the finish. It's light-bodied and highly carbonated, although it smooths out as it warms.  Suggested food pairing: Spinach salad with bacon and strawberries  If you like this beer then you should also try: Tree Bucket  Ideal time to drink this beer: Springtime, sitting outside a trendy bar or cafe on a busy street and casually people watching  Overall: 4.25 (This beer is good and I would likely drink it again) Some countries are wine countries (Spain), some are beer countries (Ireland) and some are liquor countries (Russia). I've always had a hard time putting Canada into one of those buckets. Obviously not a wine country, but not an obvious liquor or beer country either. I'd say that the most Canadian beers (Labatt's, Molson) are sub-par but I guess that's true of America too. Where was I going with this?...Oh yeah, La Fin Du Monde has to be the best beer to come out of Canada; it's one of the better ""Belgians"" I've ever had. Flavorful, balanced and exactly what a tripel should be. The alcohol is there but not overwhelming and this goes down quite smoothly.

There' s more fruit in there but at the moment I can't quite pick it out ( damn sinus infection) apples perhaps or pears. M: 3.75) Fair to middlin', an abundance of carbonation makes this beer feel light and airy. But after letting it sit on the tongue for a moment it thickens a bit. T: 4.75) As the nose suggest bread, bananas and spice dominate. With sweet and tart green apples on the finish. After swallowing bananas and bread remain in the aftertaste for some time. The 9% ABV is undetectable to my tastes. O: 4.5) Truly excellent. A bit more carbonation than what I prefer, but that is my only gripe. Yet another excellent brew from Unibroue that is suitable for all weather and/or occasions.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,BalancingBrooms,4.46,"Hazy deep golden orange with 2 finger white head that lingers. Aroma is bursting with Belgian yeast, pepper, and spice. Taste follows the nose with blast of Belgian yeast with floral notes, coriander, pepper, that melds to a citrus oil mixed with soft white bready malt. Body is light to medium with full carbonation. Ends dry with hints of pear and green apple. Overall an excellent beer that is the gold standard for a triple.

22,34,Renaissance_Man,4.5,"First beer of my Wednesday night session at World of Beer UCF. It has been a long week. This is a great triple that was poured from the tap. It has a hazy sunrise yellow colour with a small head that did not last. The nose was spice and huge amounts of orange peel. First taste confined the clove and orange with a hint of black pepper on the back pallete. Yummy creamy mouth feel added to the enjoyment.

22,34,Drogon,4.75,"La Fin Du Monde was a great ale for the price or even not considering the price it was great. Cheaper and better tasting than most from Belgium and America. Unique malt, yeast, and candi taste that was one of the most drinkable Tripels I have had. Maybe similar to St. Bernardus but it's been a while sinc I have had that.

22,34,archyquaffer,3.8,"Poured from a 25.4 ounce bottle with cork closure. The label shows a ""best before"" date of August 2016. An easy pour into a schooner glass produced about 3/4 inch of a creamy white and exceedingly sticky head, reducing only a little between sips. The beer is a hazy, pale golden color with a darker bronze in the center, and with swirling carbonation.  The aroma is funky, with subtle yeast and malt notes, but actually quite light. The flavor mildly funky and alcoholic, with strong notes of earthy barnyard, sour, fermented fruit, and grainy malts. The alcohol accentuates the pungency of the various aroma-flavors, and imparts a port-like quality. The finish is boozy and moderately lingering, with a tart, Kirsch-like quality. The body seems fairly light.  A beer well worth a try, but I've tried others of this general style which I think are superior. The funky flavors are within bounds and there is plenty of complexity to savor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Maybe even a little banana.  Good malt taste, with some fruit and slight booze. The alcohol mixes well with the fruit making it more of a citric acid type feeling than a boozy type taste. Definite oranges as well as some spice. I taste a little banana as well, like a weizenbock. Very enjoyable.  Mouthfeel is slightly creamy. Slight carbonation, but not overwhelming.  Good beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,vegassommelier,4.28,"Pale golden and slightly cloudy with medium sized bubbles. Aromas of dried fruit and trail mix, orange peels, candy corns, sourdough bread, lemon curd and almonds dominate. Flavors of dried apricot, lemons and oranges; candy corns, lees, almonds and macadamia nuts and chardonnay. A really nice long finish, and amazingly light considering it tips the scales at 9% abv. A really fantastic beer. I would drink this with just about anything, but grilled pork chops with apricot chutney feels like the perfect pairing here. I am continually amazed, being of a wine background, at how much complexity today's craft beers are generating. High marks for this great offering! Will definitely buy this again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,Metalbrew,2,"Had this beer a few times and I don't see why it's such a great beer. I've had my fair share of great beers, but La Fin Du Monde for me is an overrated beer, one that overshadows many other great Canadian beers such as Creemore Springs, which I think is a far superior tasting beer than this. Personally, I think this beer doesn't rival Unibrue's Blanche De Chambly. The taste is very fruity and it has a high alcohol content. This is one of my least favorite beers, and I don't recommend it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Well-balanced and full of flavor without an overpowering single flavor. Clearly crafted lovingly.  M: There is a bubbly, frothy up-front feel, with a Creamy, full-bodied middle, and a hot syrupy swallow. The head stays throughout and helps provide a nice feel.

22,34,BuckyBeerBeaver,4.39,"Believe it or not, some beers do actually improve with age. This was certainly the case with a 2 year old bottle of Unibroue's La Fin Du Monde. La Fin Du Monde was purchased as a 6 pack from the Beer Store, and came in 341 ml bottles with a production date of August 31, 2011. This Unibroue offering is 9.0% alcohol by volume and the price of a 6 pack works out to $2.49 per bottle. A warning if you're planning to age this beer for a while: when I opened the bottle, even though I was prepared for it, a large quantity of foam came gushing up the neck of the bottle and sadly some of this fabulous beer was lost to spillage. Let this beer warm a bit before drinking...you won't get all of the flavours and aromas if you drink it straight from the fridge.  La Fin Du Monde poured an opaque orange/gold colour, and because of the huge quantity of foam mentioned earlier, I had to wait for the off-white head to settle down to an acceptable level before drinking. Its aroma was wonderful, which I could tell right away just from the foam that spilled out onto my counter top. Apricot, peach, coriander, orange peel and yeast. The beer's flavour didn't disappoint either...it started off with sweet light fruits including peach, apricot and orange, which gave way to yeast and a coriander spiciness, finishing with a mild bitterness and warming alcohol. The sweetness was quite strong but was nicely balanced out by the spiciness and slightly bitter finish. The carbonation was much more mellow versus a fresh bottle, and I would describe La Fin Du Monde as medium bodied, hefted up a bit by its significant alcohol content. Unibroue always manages to avoid the alcohol burn associated with a lot of high percentage beers, leaving just a nice warming sensation in the finish.  If you're a serious beer fan, you must try La Fin Du Monde...ideally after having been aged in your fridge or cold cellar for at least 18 months. Unibroue appear to be the Canadian masters of bottle fermented beers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Eric_Standard,4.25,"Appearance: A very nice hazy orange with a fluffy white head.  Smell: Aggressive aromas of spices, malts, summery fruits, but most of all yeast.  Taste: Similar to the smell up front – lots of yeast, lots of malt. Some pineapple, pear and assorted fruitiness, as well as some spice-like notes. Big and bready flavours, yeasty throughout. A bit of sourness, especially in the finish. There is some pepperiness at the back of the throat. The alchohol makes its presence known more than I am used to in a Tripel, but it is still quite mild – hiding behind the sweetness up front and sneaking out in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, light yet rich; just a bit of pep in the carbonation.  Overall: Very good. This is missing a little bit of the subtlety and complexity of some of the better Belgian Tripels, but La Fin Du Monde is still an exemplary representative of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Also a good amount of malt and some grassiness.  T: 4.25 Big malty, yeasty sweetness up front with many of the same profiles as on the nose. The esters and citrus flavors work really well together. There’s some soft spice at the end that turns into a bit of alcohol burn.  M: 4.25 Nice carbonation and light, but not to thin. A little dryness on the finish. Very refreshing considering how sweet and strong this beer is.  O: 4.25 Great beer overall and an excellent example of a Tripel. Maybe not quite as much going on as some of the Belgians, but this is still right up there with them.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Tsar_Riga,4.29,"A - Cloudy golden orange, with a substantial white head fading out to lacing.  S - Big nose of yeast, with breadiness and mild spicy fruits, both apple and cloves.  T - The nose comes through with fruity sweetness and spicy notes, allspice and cloves, apple and pears. The middle is bread, mostly in the form of a yeasty dinner roll. Close is mild sourness, with more fruit and spice.  M - Smooth and full, crisp and clean, hiding the serious ABV underlying this fine brew.  O - Definitely lives up to the reputation as a world-class tripel. A delicious effort, full of flavor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Fear4Beer,4.04,"This beer gets really good reviews and anytime you have a highly hyped drink it can sway your judgement. I wanted to try this because of the recommendations. I'm not swayed on hype, I want results!  Served cold from a bottle in a witbeer glass.  When I first tried this my initial impression was to just judge the taste and no other factors. Just by taste alone it is good. Not great, but good. I'd drink it for sure but it doesn't blow me away. When you look at what's going on with this beer it become a bit more impressive. La Fin Du Monde has 9% abv and I surely couldn't tell that when drinking it initially... but boy will you feel it later on! That is quite impressive to me how they can blend it so perfectly.  LFDM definitely has a nice spice presence to it and it has the pleasant taste of fruits (apples, pear, and a little banana like you would get from a hefe). There's just something missing to me. I think its the mouthfeel. It just feels too liquid to me. I wish it had a thicker presence in the mouth like a good hefe. I think that would elevate it greatly for me. It's a good beer, but overhyped in my opinion. Of course many people may be judging this based on the ""stlye"" (tripel) and I'm not. I'm judging it as a drink alone. I haven't had many triples to compare it to to be honest but I'm sure its one of the best triples! Expertly blended!  Regardless, another beer tried! I have another Unibroue beer to review in a few days. Hoping for the best! :)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

It has a very nice white foamy head, which rises and drops quickly. I could not get over the light color of the beer, since most Belgian ales are more on the dark spectrum of colors. Aroma is good, smells like yeast, maybe some citrus and orange, and some spices. Taste very refreshing, the wheat is very clear, as is the yeast, and really is not bitter. Mouth feel is very nice, due to the carbonation, and the beer is light.  Overall is a great beer, and has a nice alcohol level. Nice tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,Beric,4.44,"RE-REVIEW Original: Served 24 April 2014, rated 4.39  Serving: Bomber into Corsendonk tulip glass Served: 1 November 2014  Appearance: Poured slowly, this one still yields a massive head that takes some time to collapse, but eventually does, leaving a soft shimmer of small bubbles on the top. Pours a hazy yellow with massive carbonation coming up from the edges.  Smell: Soft banana smell, a touch of sweet yeast, overripe pears and apples.  Taste: Complex play between the yeast and its banana esters, smooth sweet flavors from the malts, and an excellent assertion of white wine and pear notes to bring it a soft fruitiness. This beer is even better out of the corked bomber than the individual bottles. No booziness whatsoever, and the beer tasted great the moment it was poured, without needing any time to breath.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a soft, but high, carbonation.  Overall: I enjoyed this one much more out of the corked bomber. The beer seemed a bit fuller and a tad smoother, likely due to the differences in bottle conditioning. A marvelous beer and one I'll keep coming back to in the future. Would highly recommend.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,redearth329,4.42,"Poured ~50 degrees F into a weissen glass. Left about an inch in the bottom of the bottle, swirled it, then tipped in the lees.  A - the first one I poured had a perfect 2-3 finger head, the second one I poured looked like it was going to be OK, but then the head went crazy and towered over the glass by about an inch. It never spilled over though. The head was a light off white color, and very dense and frothy, like a freshly whipped meringue. The one that went crazy took a long time to settle down. The beer itself is a cloudy gold. I can barely discern what seems like a perfect amount of carbonation through the haze.  S - Not as much on the nose as I would like from a tripel, but I'm happy with what's there. A whiff of something fruity, like some vague citrus up front, but then I'm picking up mostly on baking spices. There's also a subtle hint of some barnyard tang and a quite noticeable dusty quality.  T - Drinks a bit like a kabinett riesling with notes of white grape and pear, the baking spice offered by the nose comes through. There's a little bit of bretty tang. The alcohol is well disguised.  M - Well integrated flavors, medium body, perfect amount of carbonation. Quick, dry finish. Quite like the mouthfeel on this one.  One of my favorite tripels.

22,34,AlpacaAlpaca,4.5,"A: If a golden trophy could swirl hazily, it would look like this beer. Lots of lacing.  S: The scent of bananas is most prominent. Then dates, soft lemon, almond, and little hints of sweet caramel.  T: The taste introduces itself unassumingly, with your standard blonde elements (light, spritely, fizzy), and waits a moment to unfold its more complex elements. The banana's there, along with the sweetness. There's a comforting oaty tinge to the way it goes down. It's got all the flavor diversity of a darker Belgian ale, but with an embracing lightness. Deep and warm, lulling and celebratory. A delicious and enriching beer.  M: Excellent. Lingering and complex, without leaving a cloying sweetness in your mouth. The alcohol presents itself and compliments the banana nicely, leaving a slightly acidic feel (in a good way).  O: I'm used to pretty one or two dimensional blonde ales, so it was a real pleasure to have one of such rewarding complexity. My personal favorite from Unibroue is La Terrible, but this one is definitely up there. It's perfect for a night where you crave a well crafted beer, but don't want to down something thick, filling, or hop-heavy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Pours hazy golden color with finger width foamy head, which doesn't seem to last long. Slight lacing on side of glass. Of course there are pieces of cork in my beer because it broke apart, trying to get it out. Not good. Smell of bananas and cloves with slight hint of citrus. The taste is very similar to the smell, but there is little to no carbonation and very slight hop bitterness. That is hard to discern as well. Very sweet taste. It is a good beer, but Tripels aren't really my style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BastardKing24,4.21,"My first Unibroue review, but I have had them all before.  Pours a light golden color with a small head that falls fast to a ring and lacing.  Smell is fresh apricot and pear, with a yeasty note, some clove and banana, and other spices. I'm detecting alc as well, which should be par for a 9% beer.  Taste is very nice with fresh light fruit flavors, a spicy component, and yeast esters. Apple and white grape are there too. Its sort of one dimensional, but it tastes good.

A: an agressive pour yielded a nice white frothy head that faded but left some lacing on the glass sides. Looks blonde with very good carbonation - steady stream of bubbles rises in the glass. Not completely clear, but I likely added some yeast sediment from the bottom of the glass.  S: medicinal and lemon peel. Clean smelling with yeasty esters. Wheat & bread dough malts. Delicate floral yet spicy hop aroma.  T: spicy & upfront bitterness gives way to wheat malts & white bread character. Lemon peel & orange flavors finish. Hop spiciness is delicate and complimentary. Sweetness gives way to overly dry character.  M: light bodied with upfront bitterness gives way to creamy finish. Way too drinkable for 9% alcohol.  O: an excellent beer. Super drinkable and oh so yummy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,FFreak,4.48,"Poured from bottle into Omegang tulip glass  Pours golden honey with a tight three finger pure white head - overflowed the glass. Spicey nose with cloves and pepper. Very subdued pepper and maybe cardamon spice combined with lots of honey and apricot/peach.

22,34,MartzMimic,4.18,"Pours a hazy light gold from the tap. Big, foamy white head that holds for a bit. Smells of hay and fruit. Nice blend of apples and pears hits the tongue, with a touch of white grape. Smooth, crisp mouth. This is an excellent tripel that is light and refreshing.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jwchestnut,4.72,"Haven't had this in years and was surprised by how much I loved it. Its a light orangey, yellow straw color with an incredibly soft white head and a little lacing. The smell is all stone fruits at first, Belgian yeast spiciness (white pepper, clove), banana, a little honey, vanilla and citrus peel. The taste follows the smell starting with strong peach and stone fruit notes, some candied pineapple, sweet honey, banana, and the spice profile grew as the beer warmed. A little bit of classic bubblegum flavor started to come out a bit too alongside of the clove. No traces of the booze. The clove was unique in that you would taste it and then feel all over the mouth like the way in which you feel clove. Really smooth with high level of carbonation. Could of drank this all night. Again, I had sort of considered this a gateway beer and hadn't thought of it much in a while but I was so pleasantly surprised with this one - really wonderful still.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,rangerred,4.19,"Poured into a tulip out of a 750ml bottle.  Pours a hazy medium orange with a huge four finger billowy head. It takes quite a while for the head to settle down in order to fill up the glass. Really impressive head retention and lacing.  Aroma is very fruity and spicy with orange peel and some coriander. Maybe even a touch of clove and pineapple thrown in there. Very nice.  The flavor continues the characteristics found in the aroma but there is an addition of a quick shot of caramel up front. A big rush of orange peel follows with some clove and banana. There is a moderate dryness towards the finish and the finish is fairly clean. Alcohol is completely hidden.  Overall, this is a very nice Tripel. Probably not the best I have ever had but it is up there. I would say this is the best non-Belgian example of the style I have come across.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,eclipse54,3.92,"Pours a straw color with voluminous eggshell-colored head comprised of small bubbles; moderate retention with minimal lacing. The aroma is of lemon and orange citrus, white pepper, faint straw/hay, and grass. Quite the emphasis on the citrus. The taste begins with similar citrus, but almost immediately gives way to a rush of funk and clove. There is some white pepper, straw, grass, and another appearance of lemon zest on the finish. Great belgian yeast flavor throughout. Mouthfeel is crisp, light, and refreshing, but does have a bit of a sticky, resinous finish. Overall, this is a very well done and traditional tripel that is very drinkable. The alcohol is completely hidden behind a nice, complementary bouquet of refreshing flavors.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Light lacing.  S: Fruity Belgian yeast with a touch of funk. A smorgasbord of fresh fruit notes, including peach, apricot, pear, berry, pineapple, banana and orange. Coriander and light clove. Vanilla. Black & white pepper. Biscuit. Something new every time you put your nose in the glass.  T: Slightly spicy, fruit-forward opening. Leads into a mild balancing hop and a fairly dry finish. Spice and carbonation tingle linger in the aftertaste along with fruit and pepper. Bold, robust flavor.  M: Crisp with a moderate to high carbonation. Moderate body with a creamy, yet effervescent feel.  O: Tripel meets wit. New layers of flavors and scents arise with each trip to the glass. Really meshed well with some spicy pork chili. Can't say it's the best tripel that I've ever had, but I'm very hard pressed to name one better out of North America.  Prost!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

There is so much carbonation rising for the first couple minutes that it looks like an underwater volcano. Nice persistent lacing. The aroma is lemon, a bit nutty, and yeasty.

Powerful at about 9% abv, yet tastes like blissful candy without losing the beer characteristic. It must be the delicate blend of fruit and spice.

22,34,WoodBrew,4.1,It may be the end of the world.....but at least I'm drinking a good beer. The appearance didn't score high for me....while it poured clear....there is not much head or lace.

Overall....very solid offering.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,gr0g,4.35,"A hazy, light golden appearance. Two-finger creamy white head that never entirely disappears. Some tattered lacing. Yeasty phenols upfront on the nose, kind of a Unibroue calling card as I've found -- Aspirin bottle and clove. Some bright fruity esters, too, yielding apple and even pineapple.  Really comes into its own once it hits the palate: very nice sweet/dry balance, becoming more bitter on the finish. Vinous, even Champagne-like flavor of light fruit. Less yeast character than on the nose. Texture is more soft and creamy once some initial prickliness subsides, rather than the sparkling wine-like feel sometimes encountered with tripels. Alcohol doesn't intrude into the flavor profile at all. Just very tasty all-around.  A benchmark Tripel, this is up there with the likes of Westmalle. This is Unibroue's crown jewel in their lineup.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Sweet orange candy, tropical notes, citrus on the nose, fresh orange. Slight pine aroma as well. Hard to describe but they all go together so well.  Bit of spice with tropical fruit and citrus notes on the tongue. Rather mild bitter taste, and pretty nice balanced. Refreshing taste. Bit of piney and earthy notes on the tongue.

22,34,dar482,4.43,"The beer comes in an extremely cloud deep golden orange, marigold with a big bubbly white head.  The aroma is extremely fruit forward. Pineapple, banana, mangoes, oranges, tangerines. It’s a very sweet fruitiness.  The flavor follows with dried pineapple and mangoes. It continues with some citrus peel, bananas, and clove. A caramel malt sweetness in the middle. The finish has some fruity sweetness and a hint of that spiciness. Alcohol is absolutely hidden.  The body has a champagne amount of carbonation. Tons of carbonation with a medium mouthfeel.  The fruitiness pairs beautifully with a sharp cheddar.  An extremely sweet beer for the style, but it is made up for how beautiful fruity this beer is. One of the best beers in the style.  (I had this blind taste tested with Westmalle and Chimay. This was first. One of the best tripels I’ve had. This is where you want to be if you want sweet and fruitiness for tripels.

Pours bright but peach-gold, with 1-finger, creamy near-white head, with good retention, dropping to a persistent film, but leaving little lace. Aroma of mild pepper off pour, then sweet, deep melon, and some brighter fruits and other, milder Belgian yeast spices as warms. Begins smooth and creamy, then moderate carbonation delivers some sharp fruit, and the continuing creamy body delivers nice, sweet malt, hitting at same time as noticeable alcohol heat, and revealing some stone fruit, before a sticky, still sweet, but slightly hop bitter, prickly finish.  Excellent, complex, classic Tripel, that especially commands your repeat, sipping attention by its exceedingly creamy body.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Redneckwine,4.71,"12 oz cold bottle into pint glass, unintelligible date code  Appearance - Hazy dark golden, 1.5 finger head recedes to thin foam cap and stays, decent lacing, looks enticing.  Smell - Just amazingly harmonius with fruity, yeasty, spicy goodness aplenty! It's got a unique smell to me... sweet bubblegum or something, but light and airy. Delicious.  Feel/Taste - Lively carb, tingly, full body but carb makes it seem much lighter. Where is the alcohol here? Very well hidden. Taste follows the nose perfectly with fruity yeast, spicy coriander, and relatively light bready malt. Alcohol becomes just feintly apparant as it warms, and finishes just off dry.  Overall - Delicious. This stuff is dangerously easy to drink with the 9% ABV hardly there. I haven't had a great deal of tripels, but this is easily the best so far. The flavor and body is just so harmonious.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Overall: I was a big tripel fan when I first got into craft beers, and La Fin du Monde was a favorite. I noticed I never reviewed it, so picked up a bottle. My tastes have shifted over the years, so I wasn't as impressed, but this is still a high quality beer. I think the bottle may have been a year or two old, which may have subdued some of the flavor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Taste is malt forward with a heavy background of fruity/spicy notes, apricot and banana with spice that balances it out very well. There is a note of honey that layers seamlessly on top and throughout. The flavors work together so beautifully, lingering past the finish.  Overall, this is a great, authentic tripel and definitely recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S: the aroma is spices such as coriander and yeast (oh the Unibroue yeast) up front followed by some nice banana and other fruits.  T: follows the nose. There is a maltiness that also comes through but not overpowering. It's the yeast and spice that make this enjoyable.  M: higher carbonation with a medium to heavy body.

22,34,MaximalC,4.24,"Pours a translucent golden honey color with a healthy cap of luxurious white foam. The aroma is light and fruity, smelling of clove, bubblegum, and Belgian yeast. Strands of lacing adorn the glass like streams of garland.  On the flavor front, the malt character is crackery with a touch of honeyed sweetness. This is offset by spices, featuring clove, and the ample zest of the yeast. The bubblegum alluded to by the nose also manifests in the taste, while a kiss of alcoholic warmth emerges in the finish. The mouthfeel is absolutely sublime; rich, velvety, and smooth, it affords the perfect complement to the flavor profile.  I tried this years ago and, for whatever reason, I found it to be the least impressive of the Unibroue brews. Upon revisiting, I have to say, this is damn good. Not groundbreaking in any sense, but just a really good all-around golden ale with great balance and a luxurious mouthfeel. It's crisp enough to be refreshing in the summertime, but it also has enough warmth to be appropriate in colder months as well. Another winning effort from the Unibroue crew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

There is a slightly sour, and slightly citrus smell.  Taste - Very malty, with almost no bitterness. Smooth taste with good balance. A strong hint of something fruity. Mild aftertaste.  Mouth feel- Heavy, with slight alcohol burn. Medium to high carbonation.  Overall - Tasty! I like the lack of bitterness and the maltiness. The color makes it almost look less tasty, maybe because I am used to liking darker beers, but the taste is really good. It is a pretty heavy beer, so I wouldn't drink it fast.

Here's to a year of gaining weight, drinking more and being less productive. La Fin Du Monde pours a dull, effervescent copper orange with fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Opaque body, not a whole lot of lace. Sweet and spicy on the nose, with notes of coriander, oranges, bready yeast and assorted citrus. One previous reviewer likened the scent to ""salt sea air and steel."" Sure, why not? Spices and citrus carry through to the palate in a big way. It's a complex profile that's hard to tease apart, with sweetness and spice and everything malty. Something about the moutfeel has always felt a bit off to me. Heresy, I know. My expectations for the style don't mesh well with the heaviness and aggressively carbonation. It goes down tasty but I'd be lying if I said it goes down smooth.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Nose is full of spices and fruits ranging from the hops to some apple and pear. There's also some clove and bubble gum somewhere in there. Nice fruity sweet start to the taste, malty and bready at first. The hops try to break through the sweetness and banana/apple character and do so subtly. The end is a very spicy clean taste almost like crushed pepper, warms the soul. Nice champagne-like carbonation is the perfect fit on this beer and one could be fooled into thinking it was more like 4%ABV and not the 9% that it is.

Smell- Spicy, minimal hops smell just on the back notes. Some dried banana smell. Perhaps the slightest hint of dried cherries?  Taste- Pretty much follows the nose, hints of dried banana and spice. It is sweet but the spice may be a touch too much for me. For a 9% it is incredibly smooth though and gives no hints of alcohol.  Mouthfeel- Very good mouthfeel. Medium and creamy.

Mellows out to a peppery, coriander flavor. Very carbonated and stays that way throughout the bottle. Gets a touch bitter at the end after warming.  O- Another sample for the cellar.

Food Pairing  This spicy young Tripel will pair nicely with... Pad Thai  This beer is a great little match with Pad Thai. The peanuts and coriander in the Pad Thai just opens up this offering when the beer hits 15-18deg C. Open at 10deg C, sip and let it open up to 15deg C and begin dinner.

This is a beer that I'll always enjoy, but it's a bit too heavy for me. Given its similarity to a hefeweizen, I'd probably grab a Weihenstephaner instead.

Not my typical type of beer, but a nice change of pace, and very enjoyable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,NiceTaps,4.46,"12oz bottle poured into a stemmed tulip glass.  A- Hazy golden-orange color, big and fluffy white-colored head. Minimal lacing. Carbonation bubbles rise, yeast sediment settles. Attractive.  S- Light fruits and spices, peppery and floral. The sweet and sour funky yeast aroma is direct from Belgium, per se. It's complex and powerfully aromatic.  T- Banana, pear, tart fruit and yeast flavors. Some spices, clove, sugary too.  M-Tingly and tart. Medium body and carbonation. Sour with a candied finish.  O- A lot of beers deliver 9.0 abv, this one completes the formula with the looks, aromas, and flavors of a true Tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BMMillsy,4.2,"Bottle at Ava's in Easton, MD. Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a creamy white head in a Chimay glass. Aroma of pears, spice, yeast. Flavor follows with lots of fresh juicy pears, honey, some spice, and lingering yeast ones on the palate. Medium bodied, slightly dry finish yet still juicy, adequate carbonation. Such am easy drinking really world class brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,CHickman,4.35,"Pours hazy yellow gold color with a lot of sediment in it and bubbles racing up the middle like champagne to a 2-3 finger foamy off white head that faded about average speed and left a foamy cloud on top and decent spotty lacing.  Smells of pepper, yeast, grains, clove, herbs, spices like coriander and tea leaf, fruit like an almost rotting pear and mild alcohol; a very yeast funk driven nose that is Belgian via Canada.  Tastes of yeast, pepper, sweet malt, grains, clove, herbs, wheat bread, floral hops, spices including coriander, cinnamon and tea leaf, fruit like an almost rotting pear and/or apple skins, funk (like a penny) and very in-your face alcohol that brings a mild burn but somehow turns sweet and malty and fades as it slides down. It’s tart, it’s sweet, it burns and yet somehow it’s very complex and tasty; the 9% ABV is not hidden and part of the experience, likely by design as this beer would be great an a Canadian winter warmer. More fruit and yeast draw out as it warms and other spices mix in as it seems to change with each sip. This beer makes you really appreciate the yeast and funk taste.  Mouthfeel is smooth and chewy at the same time, with a medium body, mild fizzy carbonation and a funky, slightly bitter finish that has heat but then fades and cools to a bready/grainy sweetness.  Overall it is a flavorful beer that is heavy and hits you hard with the ABV, but the taste, ABV burn and general composition are spot on for a Triple and this beer nails it. It is intense and has heat, but in a good way that reminds you of why you would drink a beer like this – because it is everything an Adjunct Lager is not: it’s complex, meant for sipping and each sip is different as the beer/yeast morph from exposure to air, temperature changes and fermentation. This is craft beer Monk style and not an attempt to mass produce a dull consistent flavor; this beer sits in the bottle and turns into an experience, and once again for me this brew was a great experience. A high recommendation, his is a great beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ISmith87,4.49,"A - 4.25 - The beer is a nice amber orange clear color with a white thick head that leaves a nice lacing. Very majestic looking bottle.  S - 4.5 - Nice belgian yeasty smell with bready, fruity notes. Banana, orange, cereal. Smells like candy in beer form :)  T - 4.5 - Same belgian yeasty/bready notes in the taste as in the smell. Banana, orange, white pepper.  M - 4.5 - Great mouthfeel, light - medium with slight alcohol warmth. Aftertaste is sweet bready banana. Very clean beer.

22,34,BVukelich,4.8,"Love, love this beer. The taste is phenomenal. The aroma makes my nose smile (if it could). The only reason it doesn't get perfect 5's is the high ABV.

22,34,1sophrosyne1,4.55,"Enjoyed immensely from bottles twice in tulip glasses; each over more than 30 compelling minutes. (Also tasted on tap shortly afterwards, with comparison notes interspersed below).  The color is a hazy peach-gold. A bubbly head falls fast in a tulip glass (even when poured on draught), but holds on milky to the edge, fed by lines of carbonation, such that lacing participates in slipping patches with every gulp. It smells of sweet cherry candy, salt sea air, banana, some pine, steel, and a touch of citrus. Malt stands nicely at the center (but somehow folds in the draught version). A little grass and coriander pops up with warming. The palette of scents is eclectic, but pointillistically well-blended with a wash of honey-wheat. Each gulp has a sweet start that's turned on the bubbles to a note of early spice. Then come bright citrus acids followed by apricot booze. All along, there's banana toffee, but it's balanced wonderfully by tartness, salinity (which is unfortunately not present on draught), pepper, and a clean grassy hop note. The mouthfeel is splendid--slick going in, then buzzy with bubbles that blossom into a richness that stays but doesn't stain. The backsides of the tongue still hold its soft oil while the belly is feeling the heat of ethanol. I've found a Tripel in North America that isn't merely a clumsy tropical cordial aged for funk--this is a true craft that I'd drink way too much if I could. Good news is that it seems to be better (stronger spice-stone fruit flavor, cleansing salinity, and right-tuned malt) with some conditioning time in the bottle, so perhaps it will travel well to me in the future...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,itsscience,4.34,"One of the first craft brews I enjoyed. Cloudy yellow in color with a two-finger white head that quickly disappears. It smells like banana and dried chili peppers. There's not a whole lot of funky yeast on the nose, as in more typical trippels. The taste is sweet with banana and maybe a little bit of mango flavor. There's also a spicy clove flavor and a low level of barnyard funk, but these flavors are rather low-key and it's much sweeter than your traditional dry Belgian trippel. There's huge carbonation in this beer and it has a medium body. Scarily easy to drink at 9%. It may not fit the style exactly but it is very good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,taxandbeerguy,4.46,"Finally saw this in the nearby LCBO, very excited to try and even more excited since 4 pack was $9.75 CDN, or close to a dollar less per bottle than the delicious Belgian Tripels. Reviewed bottle 2 of 4. Served fairly cold, but did allow for a bit of warming prior to consumption. poured into oversized wine glass.  Appearance - Hazy golden, luxurious honey brown color spills into the glass. Just enough transparency to see the outline of hand on the other side of the glass but not much else. 1.5 fingers of off-white head is poured and has excellent retention, leaving spiderwebs of lacing down the glass. It doesn't get much better than this.  Smell - Honey, sweetness, Belgian yeasty smell. Subtle spiciness and a bit of wheat. There is some booze present but smells more like a 6-7% beer than a 9% one. Caramel, molasses and candied sugar make up the other sweetness elements in the nose.  Taste - Sweetness that is delicious but not cloying, a well crafted Tripel, notes of caramel and fruit but very hard to nail down a flavor profile. Is extremely complex and the flavors actually seem to be changing the father into the glass I go. However strong enough use of hops and bitter malts to offset what would otherwise be a sweet beer so that the balance is exceptional. Booze is again subtle and a few spicy, peppery flavors at the end.  Mouthfeel - Rich, fulfilling mouthfeel, yet just simple enough that it doesn't overwhelm. Also to me was slightly light bodied, and consumption of multiple bottle would be easily possible. Medium / high and a slightly dry finish.  Overall - Delicious, well crafted tripel that may be my favorite I've had in the style. Complex enough in that it is fun to identify all the different flavors and features of the beer, but at the end of the day the most enjoyment from this beer is still generated by actually just drinking it. Should I ever be stranded on a desert island with only one beer until the end of time in an ""end of the World"" scenario, La Fin Du Monde is certainly one I could live with and enjoy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,hopsolutely,4.15,"A world class beer from Quebec. Pours a luminescent golden treacle colour with an attractive white head that leaves lacing throughout the glass. Warming aroma of caramelized malts with a Belgian yeast backbone and their cloves and spices. The flavour is well balanced, with malt and yeast depth from start to finish. Banana notes transition into caramel before a warming bitterness. The 9% ABV is scarily well hidden!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,philipsanchez09,4.4,"I wasn't a beer drinker at all until a friend recommended that I try this out. I usually went towards the whiskey because I felt that all beers tasted the same... Yeah, I know right... What do you expect when all I had was Tecate, Bud Light, Coors, Budweiser, & Heineken. I mean there isn't anything wrong with those, but I mean they weren't anything to be driving to the store for.  ""La Fin"" has a great and smooth taste. You can taste the light hint of orange & lemon citrus. The smell also reveals the same. The taste doesn't linger for too long but just enough to really appreciate this for what it is.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,RandomExile,4.82,"A: Freshly poured, a hazy amber/gold, leaning orange. Light, fine foamy head, dissipates quickly leaving a thin surface rim and floating remnants. Beautiful lacing in repetitive cascading patterns. S: Malty, coriander, sweet, orange T: Strong malt, yeasty, mild citrus bite M: Full, creamy, light, dry finish O: One of the most satisfying beers I've had. The flavors are perfectly balanced, and while it's easily drinkable, it has a respectable alcohol content making it an excellent social choice.  750mL / $8.99",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,CalgaryFMC,4.18,"This complex and heady brew pours a beautiful lemon drop yellow with ample haze and copious quantities of white foam that holds up well. The aroma is potent yeasty esters, apple pomace, doughy malts, a little citrus, candi sugar, and aromatic alcohols that hint at what's ahead. This is a boozy, spicy blast of a tripel, with apple and pear, sweet doughnut malt, orange, musky grapes, and black pepper all vying for your attention, with a more subtle backdrop of dark dried fruits and unripe green stone fruits lurking amidst the pungent alcohol. Fizzy. Smooth dry finish but some residual yeasty sweetness lingers for up to an hour post-indulgence. One of the world's finest and easy to find on the prairies. Hard to knock this masterpiece, maybe the alcohol is a tad forward but its a tripel after all.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,rdilauro,4.47,"Poured a light golden brown with a small creamy head. The aroma of fruit stood out from almost across the table. It was a very enjoyable bouquet. The taste was light and crisp with lots of good fruit coming through. I was almost prepared not to like this one, but honestly, I enjoyed it very much. I will probably hold off again from drinking this until the summer and warmer days  10-11-13: Its been a while since I have this one. Since those days, I have tasted many many beers, but still when I taste this one, I really do like it. Many of the triple's I have tasted over the years have been very good and clean. But what I think makes this one even more special is that it is so crisp and clean. I know a few that are NOT big fans of Triples, but this one, they would have a hard time not liking this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Chiefy770,4.82,"Poured into a Goblet from a bottle.  Appearance: A large foam head forms. The head slowly collapses and leaves sticky lacing. The body is a hazy dark straw.  Smell: Sweet and fruity. Alcohol esters sit behind an herbal array of scents.  Taste: The sweet and fruity flavors stand out after the first sip. The alcohol emerges in the aftertaste, along with the malts and spices. The malts create a smooth body for the spices to sit on.  Mouthfeel: Smooth body. Fairly carbonated, perfect for the style in my opinion.  Overall: La Fin Du Monde really stands out from other Tripel varieties. It packs an incredible amount of flavor. Certain friends of mine do not care for this beer because it can be a bit overwhelming. I pace myself when drinking this for a couple of reasons... One being the price, and another reason is because it has a complex flavor.  Bottom Line: Not wallet-friendly but definitely a brew that fans of the Tripel style need to try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

O - Overall this is a really strong Tripel, although I did feel the abv. provided a little too much distraction as I got towards the end of the bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,hermit990,4.75,"750 mL bottle, poured into a tulip glass. Bottled on 12/17/2012. Review date 9/30/2013.  Appearance: Pours a golden yellow color. Hazy, opaque appearance. Carbonation bubbles streaming up the glass. Approximately a finger of a creamy, white head consisting of tight, white bubbles. Recedes slowly, leaving a persistent lacing. Very good looking tripel.  Smell: The aroma kicks off with a pop of fruity sweetness, lots of grape character, a bit of apple, some underlying dark fruits (figs/raisins) and a citric tartness. Beneath this there are hints of malts and bready notes, cracker-like qualities. Finishes with some earthy characteristics and a black peppery spiciness. Very complex aroma as it unfolds in the nose.  Taste: Starts with a sweetness, less pronounced than the nose. Many fruit characters, some champagne-like grape flavors, some orange and green apple as the sweetness fades into a slight tartness. This is carried along the tongue as it fades into the malt flavors, some cracker and biscuit breadiness, leaving a spicy finish, notes of pepper and clove, some general baking spice flavors. As complex as the nose, a joy for the tongue to pick apart.  Mouthfeel: Good body to this one as it first hits the tongue, a powerful scrubbing from the numerous carbonation bubbles scrubs over the tongue, leaving a sharp tartness. A bit of a powdery feeling as the bready notes start to hit on the taste, which grow into a velvet smoothness as it finishes. Leaves a bit of warming from the alcohol at the end which just pairs perfectly with the spicy finish. Fantastic stuff.  Overall: This is an excellent beer. An absolute joy to drink. Perhaps best of all, it's so readily available and at around $8.49 a bottle in this area, it's greatly affordable for the quality. If this is the end of the world, this beer is not a bad way to go out at all. Wonderful stuff from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BaronRogue,4.65,"A triple that seems to stir triple the amount of conversation...  Pours an amazing golden yellow with a huge head that sticks around until the end. I certainly can't ask for more than that.  Smell is beer concentrate... spicy lemony bread, grains and earthy hops.  The balance of flavors in this beer are most likely the deciding factor in its reputation... such a nice balance allows a solid spectrum of spices, warm banana bread, grains, esters, sour cream, pears... really every sip has a few miles to it, as every flavor fights its way to the top.  Mouthfeel is ""float"" consistency of creamy fizziness.  A solid, oldschool, thorough sipper, and the benchmark for balance in the triple category.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Huge cloud of white head that leaves very nice rings of lacing! Smell - sweet citrus fruit, with a lean towards more lemon and orange zest. The yeast strain is faint, but noticeably present. Taste - oh my! This is phenomenal! Unbelievably easy to drink at 9% ABV and the sweetness from the nose is very well hidden, making this a smooth drink that is hard to put down! Feel - almost starts off too light and bubbly, but finishes off smooth and balanced! May I have another! Overall - much better than I expected, and I had high expectations!

Dry winey finish. Syrupy, but not in an unpleasant way.  m: Big and heavily carbonated,(small champagne like bubbles).  o: Very nice, complex beer.

There is a half finger head initially and very little lacing, the head dissipates after a few minutes.  SMELL: reminded me of champagne, apples/pears and peppery.  TASTE: In a word complex. Citrus and fruity with taste of pears and banana, yeast and pepper, the alcohol is present but very well hidden. The hops are subtle and in balance with malt.  PALATE: Sticky, medium bodied, effervescent.  OVERALL: I truly enjoyed this beer and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys the tripel style. I salute Unibroue for making a delicious beer and selling it at a reasonable price and for offering in a 4 pack or 25.4 oz bottle option. This brewery makes excellent beer and apparently has an outstanding sales/marketing department too. I can't wait to try more of your beers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S: Sweet and yeasty on the whole with strong pepper, cane sugar, and soap. Quite fresh smelling.  T: Rich and crisp. Peppery and heavy with yeasty goodness. It finishes fresh and floral with some citrus notes and a vaguely boozy twinge.  M: Prickly with a creamy head, it is a tad syrupy after a while but doesn't linger too bad and is pleasurable overall.  O: Really tasty Tripel. It verges on too yeasty but that is the only thing that I can think of that is even close to wrong with it. Really enjoyable beer. Better than one would think. Sweet but not sticky. Well-carbonated. Easy drinking. But don't be fooled she packs a wollop. Would have again. Worth finding.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Not much head, which dissipated quickly anyways  Smell: meh... average smell. smells citrousy, kinda sour. As it warmed up (20 minutes later), aroma finally came out.  Taste: this is actually where I like this beer a lot. Very complex flavor that is beyond my command of words (or my knowledge of beer). Citrousy, tart, light fruits, almost white wine to champagne like. The taste of yeast is very apparent. no maltiness or hops noted initially, but later becomes very apparent.  Mouthfeel: goes down easily, palatable. stickiness like a hefeweizen due to its yeast content. no strong alcoholic or metallic overtones noted.  Overall: very flavorful beverage, but i feel that it did not quite match my expectations (probably because I was unrealistically expected too much). I would try it again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Samuel906,4.1,"First impressions: Very, very good, a tart/sour belgian, lots of carbonation, and a heavy yeast flavor. As I get in a little deeper some more subtleties come out, some good and some detrimental. Pours a hazy gold, with a thick head that quickly dissipates to wet lacing. There is a lot of really great flavors to pick out in the nose: orange, lemon, banana, clove, coriander, some yeast and sour apples. Taste is similar, but with a huge bread and yeast presence, with a touch of honey. Lots of carbonation, but leaves your mouth a bit dry.  Admittedly, tripels are not my expertise, so as far as true to form I can't really comment. It was very enjoyable, and there were many fantastic nuances to pick out and examine. Another great brew from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Has a spicy smell of cloves mixed in with some fruits, apples and pears come to mind. The scent could pass for champagne.  While I can't pick up either apples or pears in the taste, I could pick up the tartness from the fruits. A bit of a peppery taste.  There's a real refreshing crispness to the beer. It tries to start off smooth, but with the spices and tart fruit, it ends with a bit of a bite that extends well into the swallow. A good drink year yound, but would be exceptional in the warmer months.  This is a good beer and it's easy to drink despite the spices, tartness, and the high alcohol that you'd never guess to be that high.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Kuaff,4.35,"I drank this tripel out of my snifter at cellar temperature.  Upon pouring, a large three-finger, pure white cloud for a head and a slightly hazy, bright straw-gold color. Looks like a Belgian ale, all right.  An aroma of green apples, grapes, yeast, and earth. Some flowers in there too. Pleasant.  The flavor, to me, is straight-forward and simple, but also excellent. 'Tis the beer equivalent of a perfect loaf of white bread, that basic food which is so taken for granted despite its necessity. Long into the finish, I also get a little taste of white wine.  It feels like a Belgian ale. What did you expect from a tripel? Bubbly.  Very nice. Nice enough that I'd drink this one anytime.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Taste: Sweet fruit flavors up front, some pear or nectarine with apples and honey. Very estery. If you really search for it, there is a bit of hop bitterness that rounds out the flavor, and probably helps with the dry finish. Pepper, cloves, funk, and a bit of banana help to round out the palate. very complex, a delicious beer.  Overall: This really is a perfect beer. Endless complexity, very delicious.

Flavors of banana bread forward, with another heavy dose of spicing that keeps the sweetness in check. More coriander and nutmeg, with some clove highlights in there, too.

22,34,edwado,5,Another 25OZ.bottle and another perfect score. There is no beer on this great earth that can compare to this in my unhumble opinion. Maybe i am short sighted but it is how I feel about this liquid perfection. I know people will jump on my behind for saying this-the greatest beer in the world. This is the third time I have reviewed it.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,1000lbgrizzly,4.42,"A: Fairly clear orange-straw body, looks crisp! Individual, singular bubbles rise- no streams, even weak ones. Big large-bubble cream-colored head forms fairly easily, spotty lacing.  S: Heavy on golden apples and bananas, some bready body in there, slightly yeasty. Clean. Only glimpses of spices.  T: MMM! Those great refreshing fruit notes, now with the addition of oranges, buttery biscuit, close-to-spicy spices like cinnamon and coriander. Almost floral. Some kind of herbacious/mineral notes on the finish, which transitions back to the apples. Great balance, depth, and complexity here, but not so complex that you're only trying to analyze it; it lets you enjoy it. No telling it has such a high ABV until you're on your third.  M: Smooth, creamy, with pleasant effervescence. Slightly mouth-drying, but still crisp. Combined with that palate of flavors and you crave another gulp.  O: The beer that got me interested in craft beers! Easy to enjoy, fun to decrypt, readily available, neat packaging, efficient inebriator, pairs well with many foods or by itself... scores high in all areas. A beer I go back to again and again, and am never disappointed by. Highly highly recommended!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,C3likesbeer,4.3,"A- Pours with a nice thick head with some tasty looking lace. Hazy yellow and copper appearance  S- Nice and refreshing balance of citrus, banana esters, yeast and very, very slight nutmeg spice note.  T- Banana and citrus blending very well together. Refreshing carbonation. Substantial but not overly weighty.  O- Great Belgian triple from Canada. Almost as good as St. Bernardus ABT 12 but at a fraction of the price. If you like this kind of beer you can't go wrong. Cool label too.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Roguer,4.41,"A - Super huge head, almost snow-white. Brew is thick and hazy, orange-golden color. Very thick and lasting lacing, and head retention is solid.  S - Thick creamy notes of banana, clove, coriander, spice, and candi. Slight acrid hop notes, as well. Just a ton going on in the aroma.  T - Sweet and creamy, following the nose. Pronounced sweet yeast flavors, while the spices come in on the back end. Again, bananas, some slight citrus fruit on the tip of the tongue, huge fruity malt character filling the mouth.  M - Full, clingy, oily; no sting, no foaming, no alcohol presence. Lingering aftertaste is pleasant.  O - This is not a subtle Tripel; there's quite a bit going on. Everything you'd expect is there, however, and every flavor is tasty. I can see what the (Uni)broue-ha-ha is about. This isn't my favorite Tripel, but it's very good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

A: Rich orangish-tan, nearly opaque, with a thin half-finger of light tan head and low visible carbonation.  S: Fruity yeast esters (bananas, apples and grapes mostly), cloves, roasted malts, and some booze. Some spice with almost a woody dryness here as well.  T: Fruity (banana, cherry, apple, grape) Belgian yeast esters, some toasted malts, cloves and spice, sweet but with a dry finish.  M: Medium body for style, a good bit of carbonation, and the alcohol is noticeable but doesn't seem overly hot.  O: This is quite good, although it doesn't quite stand up to the best in the style.

22,34,kaufmaal,4.74,"Several four-packs were on the discount kiosk at our local Publix and at a decent price, and since I hadn't had one in a few years, well, twist my arm.  It pours a cloudy, lemon-Jello color with some sediment floating around. When the light hits it at a certain angle, there's a neon quality to its appearance. Thin, off-white head that holds its own for the duration.  Some wonderful aromas: coriander, orange peel, banana, funky yeast, ripe honeydew. No alcohol.  This is a delicious tasting beer. The sweetness comes through powerfully, but not a sugar and heavy syrup that will coat everything and mask the flavors: melons, honey, tangerines, faint coriander, , buttery caramel. Very little in the way of carbonation, and no alcohol burn - the brew-masters are masters. There's a silky quality to this one, too.

The flavor is very rich and intense, maybe a bit confusing. Your taken aback but in a good way the first time you try this. As someone who eats green olives on cans of smoked fish and very much loves intense flavors, this is a gem of a beer.  After being thoroughly impressed with this beer and drinking many of them, I can say that I do not prefer this as a session beer. The strength gets too obvious after a beer or two and it is better left as a novelty for me, like I mentioned, being served with meals for special occasions  I hear the same things about this beer from anyone who has tried this beer, they cant believe its %9. It is rare to have people who do not usually like the taste of beer in general appreciating a %9 beer!

Fruit in the form of green apple, pear, lemon, and banana. Pepper, raw grain, and rye.  Medium body with medium+ carbonation. Dry and spicy on the tongue. Dryness is quite strong and lingering.

With the number of different types of beer and personal taste preference it'll take way more practice to truly identify the best of each bunch. Besides, what lies between ""outstanding"" and ""perfect""? Regardless, this beer was incredibly good. I'm realitively new to the Tripel and got LFDM because of the high ratings on BA. That said, the flavours of this beer were very distinct, well balanced and downright tasty. There were so many different taste regions affected on my palate that I had a very tough time identifying the medley of flavours. The malts were not in anyway overpowering as one might think of a Tripel and a 22oz. bomber at 9% disappeared rather quickly. I'd venture to say that this is one beer deserves a place on every beer rack and should be brought our to impress the advocates in your circle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Moose90,4.5,"12 oz bottle, best before 05-10-15. Silver foil cap. Poured into 16oz Odell snifter for review.  A – A hazy dark yellow/orange golden shade. Little bit of sediment floating within. Head is tall and fluffy, almost pure bright white. Head stays afloat thanks to beautiful rapidly rising bubbles.  S – Orange and fruity with spice notes. Banana, clove, and peppery Belgian style spices. Prominent and funky yeast aromas. Fresh bready notes, as well as some fresh cut grass.  T – Similar to the aroma, there is a welcome blast of pepper and banana. Some citrusy orange sneaks in and makes an appearance before the yeast strains come in and dominate nicely. There is a particular balance to this one, more spice and pepper come through towards the finish.  M – Medium/Full bodied. Texture is nice, and leads to a sweet and lingering finish. Very complex yet somehow easy drinking beer. The ABV goes undetected due to the huge influx of flavor.  O – Wonderful Tripel, stays true to the style. Does a good job of bringing lots of complex flavors to the table without letting any one of them overpower another. Great balance, and highly refreshing.

22,34,Sirdrinksalot,5,This is my first review but what can I say I am in love with this beer. The color is a nice cloudy golden hue. With a nice bubbly 2 finger head. The smell is fruity with spice notes mainly clove or coriander. The taste is amazing. It has a very nice fruity taste with a slight bitterness and hints of clove which for me the clove seemed to lesson after a few sips. It has just the right amount of carbonation and has a bubbly pleasant mouth feel. What else can I say this is a world class beer. I would drink again in a heartbeat. This has become one of my favorite beers.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BradtheGreat7,4.25,"12 oz brown Unibroue style bottle. Foiled. Beautiful bottling and label is spot on with great styling as usual from the Canadian brewer. Poured this into a stemmed Belgian tulip. Somewhat of a thinner style tulip rather than the balloons I have.  A - yellowish straw golden with touch of bright orange. Body has some haze and cloud too it. A small amount of sediment floating within its bright colored body. Head was massive and fluffy and sat nicely atop this Canadian Belgian style ale.  S - orange fruitiness with clove, Belgian style spices, and pepper spice. Magnificent yeast aroma as usual from these guys. Very fresh bready with a character of freshly bailed hay. Pear and lighter fruit make up the last wafts in the nose.  T - very similar to the nose with a blast of peppery spices and lighter fruits. Orange creeps up from no where and goes hand in hand with clove and the Belgian style spices. Yeast characters taste as good as smells. Fresh all over with an awesome funkiness to it. Slight fruity esters in the finish with some more spices.  M - medium bodied and a truly great Tripel. Excellent texture and stays true to the style. 9% abv goes nearly unnoticed in the mouth as the alcohol takes a back seat to the incredible flavors. Complex yet still balances the feel nicely. A very enjoyable sipper.  O - IMO this is the best Tripel made outside of Belgium. We all know Belgium brewers produce some of the worlds best tripels, but this one compares to many of them. It's done in a traditional Tripel style and has the class to back it up. Unibroue aren't playing around with this brew and Its honestly a must have for just about anyone. A great big abv brew for warmer weather for sure.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

I have since tried the Rochefort 6-10 and I will say that I'd take the 8 and 10 over this if I had to. The LFDM has a perfect smell (once you get past the mile high fizzy head) and its initial taste is spot on. However, this beer took my breath away from the pure alcohol finish.

22,34,ThePaintedGrey,4.21,"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass.  A: A cloudy honey-golden color with a sizeable white creamy head. Head eventually fades a bit (to about a 1/4 inch), leaving white lace down the glass. Pretty typical for a brew of this style.  S: A decent nose on this one. Sweet malts and coriander up front, slightly floral undertones, finishes off kind of spicy (cloves, I'd say) with a peppery alcohol tingle.  T: Starts off a tad spicy. Clove and alcohol notes tingle the tip of your tongue, but fade rather quickly. Sweet malt, coriander, hints of orange and SLIGHT twangs of other citrus seem to be the forefront of the flavors. Finishes off with a wave of warming alcohol. However, this is a lot smoother than one would assume for 9% ABV.  M: Tight, crisp carbonation even after pouring. A little more carbonation than the norm, I thought. Overall pretty creamy, with a smooth finish.  O: While the flavors on this one excel far beyond most, I'm just not flabbergasted by how good this one is. It's definitely a beer to be sipped slowly and respected. Well-rounded flavors and a smooth, creamy drinkability make this a wonderful beer to relax with an truly enjoy.

Overall: Too much of an alcohol taste. I don't know if I got my hands on a bad bottle, I wouldn't say it's undrinkable, I did finish the bottle, but it was way too boozy for my taste.

Hoppy, herbal lingering smell, and perhaps a bit of booze.  T: The initial fruitiness is a bit overwhelming, but then it is cut by spice and then lingers with clove. It is a very momentous experience in terms of movement of flavors. My complaint, though, is that there is too much clove -- so much so that the clove overpowers everything that comes before it.  M: Right amount of carbonation and nice, smooth drinkability.  O: This is an alright beer, though I do not like clove. That said, the clove is a little too much for me. I know I'm in the minority here, but I'm not a huge fan of this beer.

On the nose is plenty of yeast, sweet malt, sugary lemon and tangerine. On the palate it’s buttery smooth, spritzy carbonation and a little thin. It reminds you of a hefe with a little banana but it’s too sticky and the alcohol warms you and gives it away that this is a tripel. Short sweet finish, no hops on the palate at all.

22,34,StoutHunter,4.27,"I picked up a bottle of Unibroue's La Fin Du Monde a few days ago for $7 at Trader Joe's. I have had this beer before, but I thought it's due time to review it and I'm in the mood for a Tripel tonight, so lets see how it goes. Bottled on May 23rd 2012, so it's a little over a year old. Poured from a brown 750ml corked and caged bottle into a Belgian Tulip.  A- The label looks nice, it's got a clean and classy look to it, I like the name of the beer also, according to my brother who speaks a little bit of french, it means The End of the World, I like it. It poured a very hazy golden yellow color that took on a slight orange hue when held to the light with three fingers worth of white head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and it left some nice lacing behind. This a very good looking Tripel, one of the best looking ones I have seen.  S- The aroma starts off with a higher amount of medium of sweetness that had a slight candied sugar like aroma to it and was followed by a good amount of Belgian yeast that imparts a spicy aroma with cloves seeming to stick out the most. Up next comes some nice fruity aromas with some apple, pears, and banana like aromas coming through. Towards the end I get a light bubblegum aroma followed by a slight earthy aroma. The aroma was pretty good and very true to style, I liked it.  T- The taste seems to be fairly similar to the aroma and it starts off with a higher amount of sweetness that had a slight candied sugar like flavor to it and was followed by some Belgian yeast and a medium amount of spices with cloves sticking out the most. Up next comes some nice fruit flavors, I get some crisp apple and pears with some banana flavors coming through that are a little different then most tripel's and it tastes a little more like a real banana. The alcohol was hidden nicely. On the finish there's a pretty low amount of bitterness with a fruity and Belgian yeast like aftertaste. This was a pretty good tasting Tripel, it had some nice balance and it was very true to style, I enjoyed it..  M- Pretty smooth, very crisp, pretty dry, on the lighter side of being medium bodied with a higher amount of carbonation that was pretty fizzy. The mouthfeel was pretty good and it worked nicely with this beer.  Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and good example of the style, it had pretty much all the flavors and aromas that I look for in the style and it was pretty dry, might be the driest Tripel I have had and I thought it worked well with this beer. This beer had great drinkability, it was pretty smooth, the alcohol was hidden well, it was pretty crisp and refreshing, and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, this may be the most drinkable Tripel I have had so far, I would have no problem drinking a whole bottle and I don't think I would rule out having a couple glasses of this on a warm summer day. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style and balanced it was, it's just what I want in a Tripel. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I didn't like or would change about this beer, it's good just the way it is. I would buy this beer again, and I would for sure like to try a fresher bottle, it's priced pretty fairly for what you get and I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style and I think it would be a nice beer to introduce someone to Belgian beers. All in all I enjoyed this beer, I think it's one of the best Tripel's that isn't made in Belgium, it's very hard to compete with the Belgians when it comes to this style, but this beer can hold it's own. Good job guys, I really need to get around to trying more Unibroue beers, I haven't had a bad one yet. So far this my favorite beer from them and Unibroue is my favorite Canadian brewing company.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Look - Pours a pale golden with a copper tinge, slightly hazy, with a foamy/fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Very little lacing, maybe a pinky or so of retention.  Smell - Belgian yeast sour with malt backbone. Spices are prevalent. Fruits complex. Apple, pineapple and other tropicals like mango, banana, and also cloves. Lots there. Phenomenal aroma, right up there with Allagash Tripel.  Taste - Wow! A blast of juicy fruits, then sour Belgian yeast, then rides into clove spice. Dissecting the fruits yields pineapple, melon, banana, pears, maybe a hint of mango as well.  Mouthfeel - Somewhat hot in the mouth and tummy, but the 9% is otherwise quite well hidden. Remarkably light finish for a Tripel. Great drinkability. Medium carbonation.  Overall - This is a top-of-the-line Tripel.

It has a thin white head, but I can't see through it. its about 1.5cm. The lacing is maintained when tilting the glass.  The aroma is very fruity to the most part. I can smell the yeast, and it's sweet citrusy.  The taste is very sweet to my palate. I can definitely taste the belgian yeast blended with some plums or other citric fruits. The alcohol is not present. It is definitely a prime example of belgian triples. It tastes very similar to Wesmalle Tripel. It's pretty sweet and it goes down smoothly. It's almost like drinking carbonated plum, cranberry, juice.  Mouthfeel, very bubbly, highly carbonated. My tongue feels tingly as a result of the carbonation after taking a sip.  Overall this beer reminds me of their belgian counterpart; in particularly, it reminds me of Tremens and Westmalle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Roman5150,4.64,"bottle into duvel glass  appearance: cloudy orange with a 2 finger white head, very bubbly with lots of lacing, looks like an unfiltered IPA.  smell: clove, dark figs/fruits, coriander, bubble gum, banana, subtle vanilla, citrus  taste: So sweet and carbonated, it has the dark fruit qualities of a trappist with the sweetness of a Chimay to be specific, yet has some spice complexities that differentiate it from any other beer. Huge bubblegum flavors blast your tongue right away, followed by a herbal, fruity hoppiness that mixes with the sweet malt backbone in almost perfect fashion. So remarkably balanced, no taste of alcohol whatsoever, the finish is so refreshing you may think you're drinking a soda pop.  mouthfeel: highly carbonated, medium to thick bodied feel  overall: Probably my favorite from Unibroue. All of their beers are well crafted and do not disappoint, but this one is a step above the rest. Has characteristics of all the great trappists, if I had this blind I would guess it was from Belgium and brewed by monks. This was a steal at Trader Joes, for the price it is the best beer you can buy. Probably the best outside-of-Europe take on a trappist i've had besides Final Absolution by Dragonsmead (Michigan Microbrewery).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,DemoniChris,4.7,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  A - Deep golden orange hue with a brilliant bright 3 finger white head that lasts with good carbonation.  S - Light fruit esters with a bit of spiciness. Banana, orange, lemon and peppery qualities.  T - Extends from the nose. Awesome combination of banana and citrus. The Belgian yeast is also apparent here. No alcohol present whatsoever, even at 9%!  M - Pretty thin body with a lot of carbonation to smooth things along. Very crisp and refreshing beer.  O - Unibroue is an extremely consistent brewery and La Fin Du Monde happens to be the top of their game. This beer really sold me on the tripel style and has caused me to seek out others in the style. A perfect representation of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,carolinared,4.42,"Wow - what a good beer! Nice pour with good head, hazy in glass. Great aroma and great taste - impressed by how bold and complex both smell and taste were, but also extremely well balanced between all the fruity, spicy, malt, yeast elements. Only a hint of alcholol in the finish, but not a negative. Not heavy at all.  Overall, seems to me this was a ""power beer"" that one would enjoy sip by sip, but then, feel like drinking one or two more because it tasted so good and was not overtly strong or cloying (but, even one at 9% demands respect)  Now on my favorites list and will certainly buy again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Mr_Hoptimistic,3.04,"I was extremely excited to try this beer based on the raving reviews I've read. However, I was pretty disappointed.  A: Right off the bat I found this to be a rather unappealing beer to look at. I poured it from the bottle into a pint glass. It was a pale gold color with a very murky tint. The head was massive - about four fingers. Which is ok for a triple I suppose.  S: The aroma didn't impress me much either. I had a hard time distinguishing the scents I was picking up. It was a sour smell. Like old fruit.  T: It definitely tasted better than it looked and smelled, but it wasn't great. I picked up some fruity notes followed by some spicy undertones. A little hop bite at the end, but balanced with the malt. Definitely couldn't tell it was 9% abv. Alcohol is hidden well. It got better as it warmed, but still didnt wow me.  M: Full-bodied, high carbonation. Almost champagne-like.  O: Not a great beer in my opinion. Drinkable, but not great. For me, it was just ok. Probably won't buy it again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,karengarys,4.33,"pours nice and cloudy amber, nice fluffy head.  Smells quite fruity and clovey.  Taste is initially fruity, but converts to spice quickly.  Very rich. Nice body.

22,34,stella77artois,4.3,"12 oz bottle poured into pint glass.  A - Pours a hazy yellow-orange. Definitely some sediment action going. About a 1-inch head that dissipated quickly. Some carbonation evident at the bottom. A lot of people are turned off by the appearance. Doesn't bother me.  S - Fruity smells, pineapple comes to mind. Barley and just a faint hint of booze.  T - Oustanding. Smooth yet powerful. Just a bit of hop action evident, with a fair amount of quality malt. Also taste the aforementioned pineapple and a bit of melon. A sort of pear taste evident after beer warmed up a few degrees. The 9% ABV is hidden well, but still able to be noticed.  M - Solid, nothing outta this world. Crisp with acceptable amount of carbonation. Not dry or bitter.  O - One of the best rated beers in the world for a reason. Strong and bold yet slightly sweet, and incredibly drinkable. Won't exactly strain my hamstring running to the store for more, but I definitely see this becoming a regular beer for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,MattChaos,4.18,"By some fluke, I came across a case (six four-packs) of LA FIN DU MONDE for $30 in Boone, NC. Being a huge fan of the UNIBROUE brewery, I couldn't pass up this opportunity for a beer I've never tasted from a brewery I love. I'm a bigger fan of the DON DE DIEU, but this beer did not fail to deliver.  A- Negligible, sad to say. It poured horribly from bottle to pub glass which lend credence to the reviews I've seen in the past about the carbonation. This is not a pleasant beer to look at straight out of the bottle. I'm still watching my second glass settle. The lace looks like a vanilla milkshake. Not a show-beer.  S- I can't stop sniffing this beer with every sip. Coriander and...is that tangerine? From front to back, this beer smells even better as it warms and the fruit has made its way to the front.  T- Now I understand why fellow reviewers can't believe this is a 9.0% brew. I could easily finish a 4-pack before my liver reminds me that was a bad idea. The damned thing sips (doesn't taste, mind you) like a Hefe. I keep going back expecting a bite and it never happens. This is the subtlety of the variety of spices that have gone into brewing this piece of work. I'm usually a heavy smoker, and even heavier when drinking, but I don't even want a cigarette during this beer for fear of ruining the light and almost spicy taste of this remarkable tripel.  M- Nothing negative to say. No chop, no wince, a thoroughly enjoyable drink from neck to coaster. The fruit lingers not on the tongue, but in the entire mouth. What a joy!  O- My largest complaint is the pour. I've spent enough time in front of and behind the bar, I still can't find a way to pour this beer correctly. I'm sure out of a tap it's easier, but even on my third glass, refrigerated at a moderate 42 degrees, a 3-inch head settled into an inch and didn't disappear. Aesthetics aside, a top-notch beer for a great price. UNIBROUE never fails to deliver!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,kickplate,3.28,"Poured into an over sized wine glass and was very disappointed with a head that fizzled to nothing like a lemon-lime soda.  The taste itself was pretty good, but I was so surprised to see the head barely form and then disappear that I spent the rest of my time with this brew trying to figure out if I had a bad bottle.  Some other reviews describe a similar experience. Big disappointment especially since the flavors in this beer seem to be some of the best I have tested. But where's the head?",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,sadicarnot,2.28,"La fin du monde is a based upon a wonderful recipe.  But since feb 2012 bottle dates the bottle (750 ml) priming regime has resulted in a very large number of flat beers. I cannot recommend this beer to anyone, although i appreciate the fresh hop of winter batches.  Unibroue tried to reduce the gas in its product, but couldn't manage the variation which is producing a very large number of flat or very nearly flat beers. La fin du monde shoulld have some gas, enough to push the cork from the bottle. Their quality control has become pathetic, i am very sorry to say.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,IdeaSpeeder,4.54,"Serving Type - 341ml bottle poured into tulip glass.  Appearance - Pours a cloudy, deep yellow-golden colour. Almost verging on orange. A good three fingers of fluffy white head float on top, and dissipate at a medium rate.  Smell - A truly astounding and complex aroma. I'm sure I'm in over my head here, but here it goes: Light orange peel, coriander, heavy spices (specifically what I can't say exactly) and a good dose of booze.  Taste - Alcohol up front, wich gets even more intense as the beer warms. This is followed by some hints of citrus, mostly bits of orange. A heavy spice flavour is present from start to finish. Other reviewers have pointed out a heavy yeast flavour which I wouldn't have picked up on otherwise, but which is definitely there, in a big way.  Mouthfeel - Heavy carbonation leaves for a crisp, bordering on sharp finish. Mouthfeel is dangerously light, almost fluffy. The beer seems to glide on the tongue.  Overall - 4.5/5",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BobaFret,4.84,A - A hazy deep yellow with a white head that doesn't linger.  S - Smells slightly of bananas and spices. One of the best smelling tripels that I've had.  T - Spicy but not overpowering; the Unibroue yeast complements this beer nicely. Extremely balanced. I would not have guessed that this beer is 9% ABV.  M - You can definitely tell that this is a bottle-conditioned/refermented ale.  O - A fantastic tripel that's very easy to drink.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,RyFikes,3.74,"Take this review with a grain of salt. I've enjoyed many Belgium style beers, but after this one it's pretty clear that I do not like the Tripel style.  I don't really know what I was expecting, but La Fin Du Monde is dominated by the flavor of the yeast (eludes to this on the bottle). It is literally all I could taste with the exception of some citrus notes. It was like drinking a biscuit, and it sat really heavy in my stomach after. The bottle said it was brewed with spices, but those took such a backseat to the yeast that I could not pick up what spices they were.  All that being said I tried to review this beer with the style in mind, even if I don't dig it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mfanch8578,4.33,"So, there seems to be a love hate kind of thing with this beer, so I will be as frank as I can. The past reviews seem to be between 3 and 5. I give it a 4.25. This brew was on sale at kroger at 7.99, so I got one to drink and one to age. The one I drank opened with apricot and yeast. The fruitiness covers the 9 abv, but can still taste the booziness. This is one to age, in my opinion. For the here and now, it just doesn't seem ready to drink right off the shelf. not ready yet. Just tastes like a young barleywine, sorta. Of course, I will finish this bottle, but I look forward to tasting the one that I will age for at least one year.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

It poured a thin white head, with color like a ray of sunshine through the clouds at Diamond Head. Tightly carbonated with lingering head. Hay, black currant, and crisp alcohol notes dominate the initial impressions. Lingering flavors of balsa wood sans spice. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy but robust with aftertaste to spare. Overall, it stands out above most other Tripel's and enjoys an easy drinkability.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,JamesMN,4.34,"Date on bottle of 12/14/14. I'm never really worried about freshness with a belgian ale but it would be nicer to have a bottled on date instead.  Appearance: Completely opaque milky orange color with a one finger off-white head spread out across the mouth of a chalice.  Aroma: Despite my early disliking of the Tripel style, the succulent bouquet of sweet pear, apple, dates and a hint of spice in the nose really makes me realize how much I have been missing out on since getting into craft. A good mix of sweet and spice with a touch of alcohol.  Taste: Similar to the nose but more intense sweet and spicy notes. The flavor stays pretty consistent throughout with the peppery spice notes (no doubt from the yeast) held low and dark on the palate while the sweet fruit flavors (belgian candi syrup) ride high on the palate. The 9% ABV almost seems completely hidden until you get about a third of the way in and start to feel that heat building up in the back of the throat. There is a bit of hop bitterness that comes in one short blast at the beginning and then lingers just a tad in the aftertaste. A superbly balanced brew that is close to thirst-quenching.  Mouthfeel: Hovering around medium in body with a silky-smooth feel despite the streaming effervescence. Highly drinkable.  Final Thoughts: With beers like La Fin Du Monde, Tripels are giving Quads are run for their money as my favorite belgian style. Quite a good beer and one that every fan of belgian ales should buy given the opportunity. Would I drink it again? Yes.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TBoneJones,4.28,"Nice hazy bright yellow-golden with ample carbonation and a finger thick whitehead. Smells light but complex: corn, yeast, sweet spicing, citrus hint. Tastes bitter and bubbly with a sweet ale character I enjoy, and whatever spices are used here create a fine blend. Mouthfeel is perfect for me. Creamy and well carbonated, a bit sticky, the spice hits are very subtle on the tongue/ palette. Great triple beer here, and I'd have liked it even more if I was a spice-in-beer kind of guy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S-Spiced citrusy fruits, cinnamon apples, other spices, cheese, yeasty. Alcohol has a warming, but subtle, bite.  T-Dank cheese comes through at the front of the palate, followed by a warming spice at the back coupled with a boozy, spiced twinge at the finish. Fruits aren't as present as they were in the nose  MF-Smooth at first. Medium-sized body with a crisp finish.  O-Holy hell. Such a damn good brew.

22,34,THANAT0PSIS,4.28,"Unibroue La Fin du Monde  Appearance: Highly-acclaimed living legend tripel from Canada’s own Unibroue pours a very cloudy, light, golden hay-like color. The head is absolutely out of control, running wild over the edge of the glass, regardless of how gentle the pour. Retention and lacing are otherworldly as well. The carbonation is top-notch, especially for a bottle-conditioned beer. This is a great looking beer and a classic looking tripel.  Aroma: Honey, breadiness, a yeasty, black pepper spiciness, and very understated coriander and clove. It smells sweeter than expected, but that is cut somewhat (not entirely) by the spice character. Banana is also a key component here, adding further to the honey, bready sweetness. Not as much citrus as one would hope for, but still a great smelling tripel, if a bit weak in overall aroma.  Taste: Some very great stuff going on here, and puts the good nose to utter shame. There are definite apricots, pears and peaches here (somehow Unibroue even got the texture of these three fruits in there), a ton of honey sweetness, wheat-like maltiness, and, of course, a mild citrus tang combined with an extremely minimal spice character that together still stand no chance of cutting the immense sweetness of this beer. Unibroue has not even tried to hide the alcohol content here, and, at 9%, it is definitely apparent, though not in an off-putting or overwhelming sense. This is anything but a balanced beer, but like huge, hop-forward IIPAs, it is not trying to be balanced.  Mouthfeel: The beer has a medium body and is very sticky, with milder carbonation than appeared at first. As in the taste, the alcohol makes its presence known and is warm (though not hot) all the way through each sip; yes, this beer is definitely a sipper. The finish is quite dry, and does a great job to keep the drinker continually imbibing. It does its proper service to the rest of the beer, and that is all a brewer can aim for.  Overall: My first Unibroue beer was an excellent one. This beer is an excellent representation of the tripel style, and the famed Unibroue yeast only serves to improve it. As others have mentioned, it is the taste that is the highlight of this beer, though no other aspect is really a slouch. While the alcohol is noticeable, the beer still drinks less than its posted alcohol content, and could definitely sneak up on the drinker if he or she is not careful. Here’s to hoping the rest of my journey into Unibroue is as great as this one was. 17/20",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

I also get a good amount of banana esters.I don't get much clove spice, whih I would expect from a tripel.  T: This beer starts out with malty sweetness and banana notes. I also get some other fruity flavors like prunes and dates. There is a spiciness that presents itself after it hits the palate, but it seems more because of the carbonation than than the clove notes from the yeast. As it transitions to the middle of the beer, the prunes and bananas shine. The beer begins to tighten up in the back end with some yeast.  M: Medium bodied beer. Sweet, sticky, and syrupy to start. It coats the palate right off the bat. The carbonation catches the tongue and makes it prickly for a moment. Sticky all the way through the end of the beer, and the flavors linger on the palate for quite a bit after the beer is gone.  O: This is a good beer, and a good tripel.

It looks positively beautiful pouring out of the bottle, with the perfect lingering head that lasts for several minutes and leaves charmingly asthetic traces for up to 30 minutes, or so.  It smells wonderful. It's like an eclectic mix of the seasons that can be enjoyed year round.  There is a certain smooth thickness to it in the mouth. It is less viscous than other beers, but if you aren't calorie counting it is an amazing feeling.  The highlight of this beer is the taste. I don't think I've ever tasted a better tripel in my life. A variety of spices and fruits blend together smoothly in a pleasing manner that reminds me of cool fall afternoons in New England. It is completely unique and it must be tasted to be understood.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TheHammer,4.69,"Appearance: A beautiful golden semi opaque body with ample carbonation and a solid amount of lacing and retention, which excuses the pinkie finger of head the pour produced.  Smell: Fruity yeast dominates the nose which touches of biscuit malt and herbal hops with a peppery cloves and slight mineral undertone. Warming didn't really help it's case and while it's nice, a little more strength is needed here.  Taste: Wow, most Tripel's I've noticed require ample warming, but this one, well it seems that my fellow Canadians knew the norm for drinking beer in Canada. A flood of fruity yeast, apricots, pears, apples, clementines, honey, all accented but a beautiful blend of peppery cloves and herbal hopping. It doesn't transition, so much as it euphoniously blends.  Mouthfeel: As I stated, the transitioning is beyond anything I could ever hope for, and the carbonation is exceptionally well done. There is a slight alcohol dryness to it, that takes a little bit away from the fruity biscuit aftertaste and wouldn't think a 9% would have, but all in all, very few complaints.  Drinkability: This stuff is exceptionally dangerous given it's ABV. It's goes down smooth, sits down well, doesn't cause any gas issues, light bodied and could easily get me drunker then a skunk in a couple bottles.  Final Thoughts: As of the writing of this review, we have a new champion as La Fin Du Monde has unseated Peche Mortel & Weihenstephaner Kristallweissbier as my highest ranked beer. Unibroue has shown me the folly of not partaking in more of their beers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,barczar,4.1,"Best by 6/13.  Pours a hazy golden apricot with a frothy half inch ivory head that slowly dissipates, leaving sheets of lacing.  Fruity esters leap from the glass, with tangerine, lemon, peach and pear complementing confectioners sugar sweetness. There's a yeast funk that adds intrigue to lightly bready malt. Perfumey floral hop notes tie everything together. Metallic notes emerge as it warms.  Flavor reveals sharp peach notes underlying toasted, bready malt at the backbone. Pear , apricot, and tangerine emerge, along with a bit of yeast mustiness, leading to a slightly peppery, dry finish. The fruity notes are mouth watering, but stop short.  Body is moderate, with fairly high carbonation. Alcohol warmth is slight.  Very fruity, estery beer. Powerful flavors, but they're kept from being overwhelming by the bready malt and fairly dry finish. Sweetness balances well. Would've actually preferred the flavor to linger a bit.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,macbeer,4.82,"La Fin Du Monde was recommended to me by a respected beer loving friend after he heard how much I like Chimay (Blue and White labels - Grand Cru and Cinq Cents). I have to say that La Fin Du Monde is right there with Chimay white label. It truly has become my go to beer. We had a party at the house on the eve of the eve (of New Years) and I bought a wide selection of craft and high gravity beer. Chimay was on the menu as well as Sue from Yazoo, an IPA from Schafly, Brookyn, and others. La Fin Du Monde was by far the overall favorite. I have also found that it has a rare ability to appeal to women that appreciate good beer as well as appealing to men. That may be because you don't taste the alcohol like some high grav beers I am familiar with. That could be a good or bad thing depending on how familiar one is with high grav beer and how many you have!  If you are in Nashville sometime, La Fin is on draft at The Pharmacy in East Nashville. They have a number of other fine beers on draft, of course, along with a terrific beer garden out back to serve great brats, burgers, etc. You can find it by the bottle in most places that serve high gravity beers, including the Flying Saucer. The Saucer, by the way, also has Chimay on tap just in case you want to do a taste test between the two.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S-At about 40 F, strong aromas of clover and floral honey and spicy phenols jump out. Clean malt nose. T-Nice layers of complexity, starting with estery yeast with fruity sweet orange character, carried with a clean heavy barley malt bill gives into spicy phenols, providing a long finish with a pleasant alcohol warming. As the beer warms, the sweet honey character becomes more prominent M-Mouthfeel has high levels of carbonation, rich bodied with a warming finish.

22,34,Groomsy,4.44,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Orval chalice.  This famed Tripel pours a hazy dark yellow, bordering on gold. It is topped by a quickly dissipating head of soapy bubbles that fade to an outer ring and leave stringy lace down the glass. Streams of carbonation come from the bottom of the glass. While no head retention to speak of, at least the beer has good color... plus serving it in a chalice looks really nice.  La Fin Du Monde's aroma is absolutely wonderful. Unibroe's famed yeast strain is front and center, giving off scents of clove (and other spices), some banana, and just touch of ""funk."" There is a bready malt support to all of this, but the most notable aromas are that of banana and apple, potentially with some citrus in the background. A fantastic smelling beer.  The front of the palate is hit with some spicy notes, and coriander and clove specifically come to mind. Following that, a bright fruity sweetness kicks in, with flavors of orange, banana, and green apple, with just a little tartness and sourness underneath. This complex Tripel finishes on a note of residual bready sweetness and some dryness. Beautifully complex and sweet beer.  For such a big beer, the alcohol is very well-hidden, almost dangerously so. While this doesn't drink like a big beer, it will creep up on you. The effervescent and dry body is refreshing to the palate, and the sweetness of the flavor enhances this. The mouthfeel is a little chalky toward the bottom of the glass (due to yeast), but it maintains it pleasant nature throughout.  This is definitely a complex beer, and I'm glad I tried it. It is not for beginners by any means, but it is a must-have for any beer drinker. My introduction to the Tripel style, and certainly not my last.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Smells of strong Belgian yeast, cloves, apple, and pear dominate.  Such a great flavor. Tons of tastes roll around, all held together by a slight yeast bitterness. Cloves, banana, sour apple, pear, orange. Awesome! The yeast is my favorite part- it's not overdone, but really expressive, and brings all the flavors together well.

22,34,nmarsceill,4.85,"I had a chance to try this on accident. After eating dinner out at a french restaurant my party and I ended up at the bar talking with the owner. I expressed my fondness for beer as he had 4 bottles in front of him. He was trying new beers for his beer list - although this beer is from Quebec - I think the French name was more important.  I found the beer to have a crisp sensation, the flavor was earthy and only mildly sweet, while there was malt flavor I would not have pegged the ABV at 9% . I found the finish of the beer to leave only a subtle bite from the hops. I don't consider my ability to separate traditional flavor accents very good so I will leave it at that.  Overall, this is a beer I would drink alone or with a meal in a heart beat. I will likely pick some up next opportunity I have and were I to see it out a restaurant, I'd pay decently for it.  I ended up recommending this beer strongly to owner, especially given the traditional french menu.

Beautiful!  S: spicy hops, sweet juicy fruit esters, the slight astringent funk-twang of Belgian yeast. hints of apple peel and clove. Reminds me of Duvel, excellent.  T: big time clove taste, sweet juicy apple with a bit of peel tannin, pale malt body, some of the medicinal taste from the spices and the Belgian yeast. Opens a little sweet but the bulk or the flavor is perfectly balanced. Finishes off with a lingering noble hop flavor that is perfectly light and gives this beer a great finish.  M: right down the middle medium body. Not too thin so it feels insubstantial but not so heavy that it is taxing to drink.  O: worth the 3 months it took to get my hands on a bottle. Phenomenal tripple, I could sip this all freaking day. Words fail. By the way, that never-ending head is still there after like 10 minutes. I know a tripple and a strong are different but I would say that this is on par with Duvel but a little sweeter for when I am in a semi-dry mood rather than a dry mood.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The taste it a bit sour and the fruit flavors transfer over well from the aroma. I don't detect much hops, and there is hardly any bitterness. It's medium bodied on the palate.

Day before Super Bowl Sunday as everyone else went for the cheap light beers, I couldn't resist the Belgian allure. Brought this bottle home and introduced it to a tulip glass and got down to business.  A- Golden cloud with moderate bubble. foamy hat of about 1 finger or 2 lingers for less than a minute. so darkly blonde that nearly no light penetrates the glass. reminds me of Maudite of the same brewery, although not as red.  S- a very fruity nose, grapes, belgian yeast, spices, citrus and pear. again similar to Maudite but not as tart as it breaches the nostrils.  T- Fulfills the fruits captured by the nose. full bread with white grapes and citrus, maybe some apple, absolutely no bite of alcohol true a fantastic job masking the 9%. I really like how the fruit is very upfront however not overpowering or too sweet. This really makes a pint and a half easy to drink all the way to the end.  MF- Honestly could have had a tad more carbonation, just a tad though. However very crisp and complex.

It poured a bright golden color: very effervescent and lively with a very soda-like white foam head.  What struck me was how aromatic the beer was. I could smell some honey and fruit/berry scents: possibly apple and strawberry--very sweet.  The taste was much of the same. Very light on the mouthfeel and the 9% alcohol was masked nicely.

For best flavor, use a Duvel-like chalice and pour at an angle slowly until about one inch of head is achieved. Then pour rest of beer into glass after about a minute or so. It has a very distinct bitter-sweet taste, although once you have acquired a taste for La Fin, it goes down very smoothly.

I can totally agree with that statement and if the world's ending, grab a bottle of this bigtime Belgian. These Unibroue folks are giving Belgians a run for their money and they have absolutely perfected all styles. I cannot find fault in this beer, but it's not for the faint-of-heart. It pours big and frothy, with the hint of sweetness you would expect from the Belgian yeast. I poured it into a snifter, like you should, and I let it relax and warm for a few minutes before inhaling. It warmed me right up and gave me the feeling like that if the world did end there and then, this beer was taking me into a world of its own! I would say that this is a beer for someone who's open-minded. Someone who likes to sit and sip a beer or two while those around him/her down pint after pint.

Fruity and citrusy with good yeast/bread flavor. Lots of nice esters from the yeast. Not to hoppy with little bitterness.  M: Smooth. The alcohol content is hidden very well. Goes down like a 6-7 when its pretty potent. Deceptively smooth and clean. The head has a good feel to it too.  Overall: Amazing beer. The first beer I had that was not a macro-lager. Really my introduction to good beers and learning to taste and analyze flavors in beer. Life changing beer. :)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,babaracas,3.62,"Objective review time. Best by 1/15 you say? Pours a hazy gold color with fast fading white head, thin ring with no lace on the glass. Smell: candy sweetness, clove, pear note. Taste: clove infused pale malt, mildly spicy and alcoholic, pear, golden raisin. Light+ bodied, then the carbonation goes a little over the top, finishes drying with clove and a little lingering sweetness. I haven't had one of these for 4 or 5 years. It's totally decent and enjoyable, but, wow, is it massively overrated on review sites.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,MrCee,4.5,"Lemony taste. Nice and frothy. Goes really well with bready cheesey food. Does not overpower what you are eating and washes it down nicely. Nice light in color. Finish is pleasant.

Aroma starts with sweet white bread with allspice, cinnamon, and clove. Surprisingly lacking in the banana category. The taste is very white bready at the base with strong spices as listed above, some candied sugar, and the ever recognizable noble hops sugary nectar. The feel is very balanced win a super dry finish. Even though I think that the finish is too dry, it completely covers the 9% ABV. Remarkable beer.  This hits all the notes of the Tripel style and strikes a chord with your taste buds. It's classic and the standard, Belgian born or not.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BWED,4.52,"Tasted and reviewed on 12/21/12, in honor of the end of the world.  25.4 oz. bottle poured into wine glass  A- Turbid golden yellow-orange (yeah, lots of color) with a white one finger head that's quite fizzy. Dissipates down to little patches, yet a slight swirl enhances the head instantly. A little bit of lacing remains around the glass  S- Fruity up front, maybe peachy, and some light freshly baked bread in the background. Booze is fairly strong, but smells delicious.  T- Very sweet, and fruity. Bread comes up more so than in the smell, but all that yeast screams at you in the taste.  M- Quite thick but very smooth, velvety. The carbonation dances on the tongue and it makes me giddy! Perfect feel.  O- Delicious, complex (and baffling.) You know it's good when it brings a smile to your face every time you take a sip. A wonderful beer, and if I did know the world was ending, it might just be the beer I go out on.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,CBrotherton,4.08,"A 12-ish oz. pour from a 750 ml bottle to chilled glass. Not a tulip glass as suggested by the bottler.  Appearance: Slightly cloudy with many bubbles that slowly rise to the head. The head itself was about 2"" in height and is now approx. 1/8"" in height after resting for a couple minutes.  Smell: Had to close my eyes and get very close to find a smell (so close I got the tip of my nose in the beer). The best description I have at the moment is a subtle, bright yeasty smell. I've never smelled any beer quite like it to date.  Taste: I can taste the yeast more so than I can smell it. Bright. Distinctive acidic, citrus, almost lemon taste to it without the sourness of a lemon. Part of me wants to say lemongrass but I'm not 100% sure that applies. Overall, a memorable first taste that is vaguely reminiscent of Boulevard Wheat that quickly changes to something else entirely (still figuring that out). Bubbly at first and with a quick springy, flowery finish. Was looking for a longer finish or stronger opening with this beer.  Mouthfeel: It hits the sides of my tongue towards the back of my mouth. Drinking this makes my mouth want to leap a bit after each sip.  Overall: A great sipping beer. High ABV that hides a bit behind the yeast and bubbles upon pouring. It's still easy to notice its high ABV however. Not out of the park on taste; i was hoping for a more bold flavor that would be worthy of the label ""The End of the World"". It would be ideal for serving at a small gathering where conversation is intelligent, or (as many have done so far) toasting beer at End of the World celebrations.  This is my first review of a beer. I am supremely overjoyed that, having survived the new year, I can go on to review other beers.  Purchased 4-750 mL bottles at $6.99 about a week before Christmas 2012.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,brystmar,4.23,"Had this bottled countless times before, first time on tap. A fitting brew to drink for the impending apocalypse.  Silky smooth, creamy body approaches perfection.

22,34,Tusked_pinniped,3.95,"Poured from large bottle to regular glass (yes I ignored the tulip recommendtion but only becuase i don't have one!).  A: Cloudy and golden with bubbles rising happily to the surface. Lovely head slightly thinner than my finger shrinking but lingering for quite awhile.  S: Not quite sure how to describe this, its somewhat unique. Slightly yeasty I guess? All I know is that is seems to be come with all of the Unibroue products I have tried. Strange but I've come to appriciate it.  T: Sweet but not heavily like a porter or stout. Most of the flavors I notice come after I swallow. Kinda smooth and nutty fading into a lingering grape juice like sweetness that I really enjoy. You will also get the distinct Unbroue taste that comes withall their stuff. If impatient enough to sip while the head is still there you may find it very smooth and creamy.  M: Nothing too special about it. Its thin and bubble. Nothing wrong with it either though. If it was summer I might be more excited about it.  O: A nicely sweet and fruity brew with a decent drinkabilty. My only problem is that the taste of the 9% alc. does slip through now and again but the after taste makes up for it in my opinion.  Random notes on this beer: This is my second time having it. This is the brew that introduced me to the glorious world of Unibroue. Its not my favortie from them but more than worth having. I'm having it now because when I started drink it it was 12/21/12 and I made a pleadge to have it at midnight as the name itself apparentlly means The end of the world. Ultimately I used that as an excuse to have this agian.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,thehyperduck,4.61,"750 mL bottle from the LCBO; bottled May 22 2012. I picked this up a few months ago with the express purpose of reviewing it December 21st, which was probably a good call because I haven't seen it in stock recently. It's now after midnight, and we all know the Mayan stuff was bollocks - but in a happy coincidence, the first truly snowy, windy, wintery weather of this season has finally fallen upon Southern Ontario tonight. That's perfect big Belgian beer weather, making this as good a time as any to review one of the world's best-regarded tripels. This one was first poured well-chilled, but most of the bottle was consumed after warming.  Pours a cloudy golden-amber colour, topped at first with one finger of dense, creamy white head that withers away to a thin film and collar fairly rapidly over the next few minutes. Not the most impressive thing I've ever seen, but the aroma is positively heavenly, with a wide variety of intensely fruity, yeasty, floral, and especially spicy aromas - toasted wheat, tangerine, pears, apples and coriander comprising the bulk. The concentrated whiff of aroma released when you uncork this stuff is worth sniffing for... that's how good this stuff smells.  And the taste is equally worth savouring - with a rich, yeasty, fruity flavour profile as well-crafted as any authentic Belgian-made tripel. At first I can make out lemon and orange citrus zest, sweet Belgian sugar and wheat malt, pepper and coriander, with bubble gum and orchard fruit (mostly apples and pears) coming through as well. The finish is yeasty and spicy, with a good brush of heat from the ethanol. Leaves a sticky feel behind on the palate - probably the main contributor to the long-lasted aftertaste. Medium-bodied, with high levels of spritzy carbonation that helps counter the yeasty chew and spicy aftertaste a little. Drinkability isn't all that great - this is the sort of thing I'd prefer to drink before bed, or at least after a big meal, rather than on its own.  A great sipper for a cold night, and even though the serving size is a bit much for one person, I'll take the risk and polish off the bottle - a conclusion I'm sure any true man would arrive at naturally. After all, if that end of the world prophecy was actually made in Pacific standard time, I could still die horribly before morning arrives, and I'd prefer to be drunk should that happen. Consuming this beer has got to be one of the finest routes to the achievement of that noble goal.  Final Grade: 4.61, a virtually flawless A+. La Fin du Monde is one of Canada's finest beers, though I'm not entirely sure it would be my first ""last"" beer choice if I believed we were all completely doomed. It remains an unbelievably great value purchase for any tripel fan, both in terms of price point, quality, and wide accessibility/distribution. For these reasons, it is well worth a purchase for anyone interested in the style. I've had this before, and I'll have it again, and would recommend everyone else follow suit.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Siriusfisherman,4.44,"Served in my La Fin Du Monde Tulip glass.  Appearance: Pours a very hazy, extremely pale color with a four finger head that disappears quickly. As long as the beer is in your glass, there is an onslaught of carbonation streaming to the top.  Smell: White fleshed fruits, pear and apple, a little bit tropical, spicy yeast and some funky, cheesy notes as well. Very pungent and ripe all around.  Taste/Mouthfeel: The taste is similar to the nose, lots of the pungent fruit and lots of zesty yeast spice, and some underlying funk. The front is a nice carbonation kick that moves into a hit of bitterness and an onslaught of flavor and a smooth, sweet finish The fruit flavors linger more than the peppery notes, likely due to the sweetness. Not as dry as most tripels. Unbelievably complex, this beer has alot going on.  Overall, this beer is unique in the style and has an unbelievable amount of flavor, very hard to tame if you are not familiar with belgian ales, it is very complex. From start to finish this beer is incredible, make sure it is not served to cold.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Maxwell,4.17,"The beer pours an ugly piss yellow with hints of orange and with a very soapy head on it that fizzles away slowly, and sits over the beer as the color of soap bubbles. The beer’s body is cloudy like piss, but allows a fair amount of light through. On the nose, this beer smells of soy sauce and banana phenol notes with some very slight bubblegum hints. Fruity soy sauce is really what comes to mind when you smell it, though not in an entirely bad way. On the tongue, the beer tastes of creamy banana, soy, and some nice clove-like spice. The beer really begins with light soy notes that grow in fruitiness until they hit banana flavors, and all the while the spicy clove also builds on the sides of the flavor, and leaves the aftertaste to ring lightly of spice and slight banana. The middle of the taste is really where this beer shines, with big spicy cream banana notes that are quite pleasant on the taste buds. On the mouth, this beer feels quite fierce with carbonation, though the beer below it sits with a nice medium body that sticks to the tongue, and leaves the mouth clean, but with sticky saliva along the sides of the mouth. Overall, this is a nice tripel-style ale with some great phenolic notes, and some nice spicy complexity. A fitting beer to end the world with, I suppose, though it isn’t my favorite in the style. Still, this beer is worthy of a try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,StJamesGate,4.1,"Deep golden honey with just a sliver of white film, a steady line of bubbles up the middle and lots of speckles. Honeycomb nose with phenolic tang and vague herb and spice notes but no hops to speak of. Golden syrup, overripe pears and pound cake, yellow apple esters and clovey phenols, a hint of coriander and dried orange peel, then some understated lemon peel and lemongrass hops. Apple tart with a bit of band aid on the finish and numbing winter spice linger. Medium, silky smooth and soft, plenty of chew, warming.  One of the longest-held inhabitants of my cellar, with a 10.10.10 expiry date, so lots of time to mellow. And I have to wonder if it was maybe too long - hops are all but gone. What's left, though, is fairly lovely: plenty of residual sweetness up front and in the creamy body (a bit too much candy sugar, even), a pronounced yeast presence that never gets too funky, and echoes of spice. Others say banana; I could see that. I'm reminded of Karmeliet in that the classic tripel notes are there, but jacked up or given a twist. A sneaky ABV, too. It is missing a certain brightness - the sweetness and yeast are assertive enough that I miss the balancing bitterness - so I'll need to try it fresh, but an easy winter sipper.  Here's to the Mayans.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,kevanb,3.86,"12 oz bottle poured into a La Fin Du Monde tulip  The beer pours a wonderful golden hay color, hues of gold, dandelion, copper and orange, a big 4 finger white head, tightly packed bubbles, arises from the beer that has fantastic retention and great lacing. Hazy complexion with lots of bubbles rising to the top of the glass, this is the quintessential appearance for a tripel. The aroma is nice, banana, clove, hay, yeasty funk, some cereal grain, a touch of berry comes through, it's a bit muted by the yeast which doesn't let the other elements play as well. The flavors are definitely hindered by the overpowering yeast, banana, clove, a touch of vanilla, some berry esters come forward as well, but not as pronounced as the nose, lots of funky yeast, really starting to overpower with cereal grain coming though at the end, very dry yet soft finish. The body is good, abrasive at times, overly carbonated in my mind, very lively though, not offensive.  Verdict: A rock solid Tripel, one of the flag bearers of the style. Personally, I have other favorites, but this is definitely a go to beer as it is available nearly everywhere, cheers to Unibroue for this one, definitely a success.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Powdery yeast leads to a slightly dry and warming finish, leaves the most pleasant aftertaste of any tripel that I've had. Such a complex taste profile.  M- medium body, lively carbonation leads to dancing bubbles and a creamy mouthfeel on the palate, creamy and somewhat dry finish. Alcohol is dangerously hidden very well.

I'm getting some fruity notes along with a hint of cloves.  Taste: There is a nice level of malty sweetness here, it's prominent but not cloying. The Belgian spice shows up here too, but it's not as dominant as it was in the smell. There is a mild fruity note here as well. The finish is slightly bitter with some Belgian spice in the mix.

Lots of lovely bottle conditioned bubbles floating everywhere.  -Smell 4.0: Ah, this is a tripel (even though the label states it is a ""triple."" Ah, qu'est-ce que c'est). Nice, deep aromas of yeast and dry biscuit malt. Also a certain honey scent in the bouquet. Very nuanced and not over the top.  -Taste 4.0: Interesting. Front is dry and somewhat resiny. Middle is where the flavors come in: slightly sweet; a very subtle honey taste blended with that tell-tale Belgian yeast spiciness. Finish is smooth and dry with some high notes of clear sugars. Aftertaste is clean and almost non-existent. I can detect zero alcohol in the profile of this beer, which is remarkable.  -Mouthfeel 3.5: Right on the nose with the carbonation for this style.  -Overall 4.0: A very good tripel, triple, etc. However, I have to state that, to my tastes, it is a bit too dry and lacking in depth of flavor.

22,34,wekieboom,4.95,"By far one of my all time favorite beers and a first choice when recommending a new beer to a friend. To me the smell and taste has that familiar fruit, almost banana, like resonance of many tripels and some hefes but isn't over bearing as with some. Initially sweet with a hoppy finish, tons of flavor throughout and a lasting dryness as it parts. I am not so grandiose to claim notes of different tastes but the flavor is not a simple one, yet doesn't confuse my mouth as it typically grins after the first taste.  I love the head of this beer- thick and creamy and sticks to the glass... Never before had I appreciated such a thing before trying this beer.  I gave appearance a 5 because the presentation is is great and in a glass it looks a lot like a tripel, can not ask for anything more, nor can I find anything to fault.  The only fault I find is this beer tends to be slightly too carbonated, not over the top but just more than it needs to be.  A must try, in my book, if you are even slightly interested in venturing out in the beer world. Fairly easy to find and not overly expensive but be careful as you will not notice the 9% alc/vol as you are tasting this ""End of the World"" experience.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The banana is present, yeasty in the middle, followed by the clove but I don't get a whole lot more. The label reads ""robust flavour"" but I can't find it.

T: Lots of sweet fruit up front with a clean peppery bitter finish. Some floral notes from the hops, in the realm of Saison Dupont but not as pronounced. A touch of alcohol at the end but not much.  M: Champagne like in terms of carbonation. On the lighter side in body, and a little dry.  O: This is a great beer, no doubt about that.

Digging deeper reveals coriander with the cloves.  Yeast and a hint of wheat are very apparent at the start. Hints of grape follows and transitions into banana. Light hay, clove and coriander finish her off. It takes many sips to find all flavors, this is a very complex brew.  Very strong carbonation up front. The body is light-medium. Ending is lightly bitter.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,MCC,4.27,"An excellent interpretation of the Tripel style IMO.  Pours nicely, needn't be too vigorous to get a proper head. Said head is snuffable and quaffable, and it's worth doing both.  A: rather light, slight opacity, which raised my expectations. Good carbonation.  S: frankly this is my favorite aspect of LFdM: unusual (for our geography) notes of grass, hay, and other yeasty metabolites that coalesce to make it... oh, forget it - on to taste.  T: good but doesn't quite match olfactory. If anything perhaps too sweet; not sugary but cloying over time.  M: very smooth. Exceptionally drinkable. Good viscosity.  O: this has cracked my regular rotation of tripels (LFdM, Gulden Draak and Rochefort 8 (which I group with Tripels)).  Also worth noting, cost effective: $7.99 for 650mL. Plus you get to have the asthetic experience of uncorking a bier.  And then clarifying to any neophytes, ""No, it's not champagne.""  Prost, salud, cheers - MCC",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

This one is a liquid fruit cocktail. So many different fruits attack the senses that i'm sure i missed some in my review. For a 9% abv brew the alcohol is extremely tame, enhancing the flavor and leaving a somewhat white wine like flavor. Spices and sparkling apple cider round out this amazing brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,KickbacksSteve,4.45,"On tap at kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Huge white, fluffy head, high retention, soapy,sticky lacing. Aroma includes lemon peel, banana, clove, nice white pepper spiciness. Taste includes all of the same, also some candi sugar. Deliciously ""wispy"" and certainly deserving of all of its accolades.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,1Nrwyscotch,3.83,"750 ml bottle poured into a tulip glass  A. It pours a beautiful dark yellow with a thick white head which last for awhile, no lacing.  S. I smell belgian yeast followed by some sweet light fruit. As the beer warmed a little I began to detect some spice(clove) at the end.  T. It tastes like very sweet malt and has some sweet fruit in the back ground. It tastes more like a Belgian strong ale to me as i am not getting the complex flavors i expected.  M. Its pretty thin with some carbonation that fades quickly  O. I really enjoyed this beer but expected more complexity in the flavor. I would not hesitate to get another bottle as it is delicious.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Kremlock,3.83,"A: Pours a hazy corn/gold colour, frothy 1/2 inch head that stays through out, apparent high carbonation visible.  S: bubble gum, coriander, cloves, sweet oranges, ripe apples.  T: I get fruit cake. Good old fruits with spices and alcohol in the background. Cloves are present with some coriander. Yeast flavours dominate the palate with an undertone of bitterness. The finish is sweet.  M: Great carbonation, cleans the palate but does not have the puckering feel that other Unibroue products have.  O: This is a very well enjoyable beer. It's not overly complex, flavours are a bit hidden and it is sweeter then bitter on the balance scale. I think it's a great introduction to a Tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Geegmasta,4.7,"Poured into a tulip glass  Appearance- Poured smooth in a glass to reveal a cloudy, yet bright, orange colour. A mid sized, bubbly white head forms at the top and quickly dissipates within a minute or so, leaving no lacing.  Smell- Fresh citrus and fruit explode boldly into the nostrils. Very refreshing.  Taste- This beer really doesn't come off as complex but maintains a very steady and strong taste. A fruity/citrus flavor invades your tongue with hints of coriander with a slight hop undertone. The alcohol is very well masked but lingers in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel- Highly carbonated but dissolves into the mouth very quickly and finishes smooth.  Overall- Unibroue is one of my favorite breweries as almost every Unibroue drink I have had has exceeded my expectations by miles. La Fin Du Monde is no different. This is one of m favorite beers by them and one of my favorite beers in general. It's an extremely well made Triple ale on lees. If you took Blue Moon and made it 10x better, you would have La Fin Du Monde. I also enjoy it with slices of grapefruit (that's right, not oranges). I drink this beer regularly and recommend it to all beer-curious folk. Just be careful that hidden 9% ABV doesn't sneak up on you!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Imza,4.94,"This is my favorite beer in the world. Pouring it angled properly yields little head, sometimes I get a thick foamy white head. There are tons of sweet and fragrant aromas that I'm not so good at identifying, but it is quite pleasant. I know cloves are in there. The taste is similar, with many different flavors. VERY smooth, flavorful, yet robust with a well-hidden 9% kick that you feel in your head rather than your tongue. The label of the bottle is amazing, and the title is French for ""The End of the World."" For me, personally, this is the end-all-be-all of great beer. I also love the sound of the cork popping. These are now available at my local grocer (the nice one, anyway) for around $7 a bottle. Awesome deal.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,McD0uche,3.7,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass:  A: This stuff is really carbonated. Light golden color with big billowy head. Good retention.  S: Typical damp towel Belgian smell. Bell peppers, spices, malty earth, dirt, tomatoes.  T: Sweet, complex mixture that tastes nice. Dark fruits, spices, and malts play center stage here. Buttery.  M: Starts out by flooding your buds with flavor, then radiates on the back of your tongue. Light bodied, finishes dry. Invites more sips.  O: I'm still trying to find a spot in my heart for Belgians. Usually they are too malty and peppery for me, and I find myself disliking the flavor. This was a decent beer with an adequate taste that many would find very enjoyable, but what I really liked was the overall mouthfeel. Refreshing.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Initial taste shows how high the carbonation is in this tripel. Lots of yeast, bubblegum, citrus, cloves, and tropical fruit. Very smooth and creamy rather than watery and acidic. Alcohol is perfectly hidden. Refreshing, not too light, and awesome! One of the first beers I ever fell in love with.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,dbrauneis,4.3,"A: Pours a crystal clear pale golden yellow in color with heavy amounts of visible carbonation. The beer has a two finger tall bright whit head that slowly reduces to a thick film covering the entire surface of the beer evenly. Moderate amounts of lacing are observed.  S: Moderate aromas of light fruits, Belgian yeast, peppery spices, and lighter notes of floral hops.  T: Moderate to strong flavors of pale malts with some light fruit sweetness balanced with peppery spices and Belgian yeast. Additionally there is some candi sugar sweetness and just a hint of floral hops contributing a touch of bitterness that fades quickly.  M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Very smooth (almost creamy) with lots of dryness in the finish.  O: Probably my favorite beer in the style (Tripel) and a great example of it... The alcohol is extremely well hidden making the beer quite easy to drink but I know it needs to be sipped or it really sneaks up on you. Definitely one to have again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Darkmagus82,4.37,"Poured from 750 ml bottle into snifter  Appearance – Pours a hazy orange-yellow color with a two finger white head. The head fades over a moderate amount of time to leave a lighter level of lacing.  Smell – The aroma is bready and yeasty with a strong citrus orange and tropical fruit aroma. Mixed with these stronger aromas are some spice notes of a coriander and clove smell. Overall very Belgian triple like.  Taste – The taste begins of a smooth bready flavor mixed with some tropical fruit tastes of mango, papaya and some tangerine/orange. As the taste advances, a yeasty flavor mixed with spice flavors of coriander, lemongrass, and clove come to the tongue. From there the spice and yeast grown stronger as the taste moves further forward with the sweeter fruit flavors losing some ground. In the end an alcohol flavor mixes with the rest to leave a warming bready spice flavor on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is rather complex and is really quite interesting and nice. It begins very smooth and creamy at the start with the carbonation level seeming relatively light. As the taste moves on the carbonation seems to explode from the brew within your mouth with the body crisping up. The smooth and creamy in the beginning are great for the bready and sweet that are heaviest up front, while the crisp and carbonated at the end are fantastic for accentuating the spice and booze. The feel is very nice, I must say.  Overall – A very tasty and enjoyable to drink beer. This beer has one of the best feels of any beer I have ever had, as it seems to match and complement the flavor transitions perfectly. This is definitely one to try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,burns1066,4.75,"Holy Cow... Go Quebec! This is a wonderful beer. Fruity nose, but with no cloying, too-sweet flavors. You get the pears and tropical fruit, but when coupled with gentle hopping the flavor profile mellows into a balanced, pleasant drinkability. The hazy appearance is lovely and golden.

T: Fresh orange malt, pear juice, rich maltiness, some honey and spice (white pepper), with a warming alcohol flavor on a long finish.  M: Kind of a fuzzy mouthfeel, medium-high and somewhat sharp carbonation, and medium body.

22,34,TastyAdventure,3.87,"When I first had this beer about 9 months ago, I wasn't too impressed. It has been on my list of ""must revisits"" for a long time, because I guess my palate wasnt too developed back then.  A - glorious frothy 1 1/2 finger head. extremely hazy cloudy yellow, almost orange tinted body. decent amount of lacing on the glass.  S - clove, white pepper, yeast , touch of banana,  T - light but very present clove, yeast, maybe some pear fruitiness somewhere behind the strong carbonation, dry in the front, middle, and back, but not constantly just dry; the other flavors come through plenty.  M - very fizzy mouthfeel, carbonation dances on my tongue. refreshing, but the body is dense with a slightly chalky, yeasty heaviness. but the carb brings it up like champagne. very nice.  Overall - Unfortunately I don't prefer dry over un-dry, and this is probably why i didnt care for the beer the first time i tried it, but it is still very tasty, and the reputation is worthy. I did enjoy this beer quite a bit.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,RonaldTheriot,4.85,"La Fin Du Monde has a thin, fizzy, champagne-like, white head, and an initially clear, extremely bubbly, yellow-golden appearance, with a bit of lacing left behind. This beer really clouds up after one swishes and pours in the sediment. The aroma is of sweet, spicy, lightly bready malts, and the flavor is the same, with some sourness, grapefruit, sugar, hard candy, and spice cake (the taste of which grows after the swish & pour operation). Mouthfeel is light to medium, and La Fin Du Monde finishes mostly dry and pleasant. Alcohol is barely detected, and drinkability is super.

22,34,tectactoe,4.26,"Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Golden yellow, very vibrant color with a huge haziness that makes the beer extremely opaque. Very volatile, leaving an enormous, cloudy white head. The nose hits with some cooking spices, cloves, fruits and fruity esters, and a slight medicinal background. The taste follows through with heavy clove and banana up front, all based on the background of warming alcohol. Bubblegum comes through midway, as well as faint grape and orange. As the beer starts to warm up, I could taste some pear and sweet peaches coming out, too. Aftertaste is left with a nice helping of yeast and malty-bready flavors, along with a dash of clove and alcohol.  This is a well done tripel ale. Balanced extremely well and fairly complex - load of fruits and esters can be picked out of this one. Sweet, without being too sweet, and fairly mild on the palate for a 9% ABV brew.

A hint of grass.  T: Fruity up front with more citrus. Lemon and orange for sure again. Hints of melon. Sharp yeasty spices, mainly pepper and cloves. Grainy bread and grass. Long lingering aftertaste with that spicy yeast.  M: Higher carbonation cuts it a bit but it's still fairly heavy.  O: An excellent and faithful example of the style. Crisp and refreshing.

22,34,Jathorp,4.55,"This may be my favorite tripel; perhaps because it doesn't taste like any tripel I've ever had before. I've been told that there is some wheat in the grain bill, which is uncharacteristic of the style.  Pours a hazy slightly golden color. Small head, nice lacing.  Smells faintly of belgian yeast mild fruit, not much belgian funk. Also some clove, maybe some orange peel and a touch of coriander?  The taste is the strongest part of this beer. The yeast unibroue uses is proprietary and it has all of the fruit and phenolics that you'd expect, but they're very subtle. I think I can taste a little bread and a touch of corinader. very little bitternes.  To me, this tastes like a hybrid between a tripel and wit. The alcohol is hidden and it's very easy to drink. One of my staples.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S: I find Belgians difficult to dissect because they're so complex yet simple. I get candy sugar, malt and a bit of barn/straw/funk. Fantastic is one word.  T: Wow. I've never been a big fan of this style but this is special. Malty, sweet, sugary, floral, fruity. A joy to drink.  M: Very sweet but not cloying. Bright, fresh, malty. Big carbonation.

22,34,RussBecker1,4.68,"A- A cloudy golden composite. That is distinctive of a tripel. There is an ambivalence of character swirling throughout that is all brought together by a big clean head, making this one of the most sophisticated looking beers I have seen. The beer finishes with a nice deal of lacing as well.  S-Huge spicy nose that is highlighted by a lot of clove and a bit of sweeter scents (honey banana and cinnamon maybe a hint of nutmeg as well)  M-Nice mix between cream and carbonation to give the beer that much more character.  T-An absolutely fascinating blend of flavors. To me this is the perfect tripel, as it differentiates itself from the rest of the field. The abundance of flavors are impressive, but its the balance between all of them that amazes me most. Instead of being labeled as a tripel, it is simply La Fin Du Monde, a true work of art.

The fruit I expect from a tripel is quiet. It's there in some ways, but I just love the big passionfruit and honey flavors some tripels have. Now, this has some beautiful sweetness; banana, heavy in body, and inexact, but nice . . . just not that golden raisin, nectar-like, champagne sweetness I want. Spicy, clove, coriander, funk are in control.  Okay, it's a great brew. I just like other heavy hitting tripels a bit better.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

High abv is hidden well.Slightly tinney taste. But smooth going down.  Very carbonated but in a good way.  Mouth feel is smooth flavour dissipated quickly.  Overall OK. Would not purchase again as it is not my style. I am a hop head this brew was too sweet and reminded me of fallen fruit off a tree which is fermenting. Still more interesting than macro.

Man, this is outstanding. A hint of an alcohol presence, but that's understandable at 9% ABV.  M- The body is medium and carbonation plentiful, tickling the tongue and refreshing the pallet.

A violent display of carbonation continues throughout, long after I pour. The lacing is tiered perfection.  S - Big aroma of peppery citrus, banana, cloves, grassy hops, and loads of not-quite-funky yeast. Perfection for the style.  T - The flavor is sweeter than the nose indicated. Starts slightly tart with apple and pear and transitions to sugar/bready malts. Bubblegum sweetness on the back end with a spicy clove finish. As is typical within this style, the high ABV is very well hidden.  M - High carbonation is no surprise based on the appearance. Medium bodied. The carbonation is great to begin with, but the beer flattens out quickly. Maybe I drank too slowly.  O - This was one of those perpetually available, phenomenal beers that I pass up on every time at the store because it will always be there anyway. I decided to grab a single during a recent haul, and I was not disappointed. The aroma is amazing and the flavor is good, although I found it to be a little bit too sugary sweet at some points.

Great carbonation, although very little lacing. Still, beautiful.  S – The smell may even be the best part. Just so complex with layers of sweet apple, dark fruit, clove, varying yeast, a little bit of cinnamon and a hint of white grapes. There is also a very faint smell of alcohol. But it is truly just delightful.  T – Spice hits your first, and it’s somewhat surprising because you cannot really detect it in the nose. Clove, nutmeg, fruity elements and some yeast. It is sweet and yet spicy and a slight bitterness to it that makes none of the flavors become boring but balances all of them.  M – Great body on this beer, it is decidedly medium and yet the carbonation plays with it so that it would not be a stretch to call it light. The alcohol is really not noticeable throughout this Tripel which is very impressive.  O – Overall this is just one of my favorite beers out there. Great Belgian yeast going on it here, so spicy, mildly fruity, sweet and slightly bitter, and utterly drinkable. I love this beer. Probably in my top ten.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

M: Light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Leaves a strong lasting flavor of yeast and unripened bananas.  O: A good beer unlike anything I have tasted before.

S- Full Belgian yeast aroma with an effervescent backing and tropical fruit notes of pineapple, papaya and some mango. Sweet-smelling plus some herbal spiciness.

Smell: Banana and pineapple. Loads of canned pineapple. Unibroue yeast adds its typical compliment of spicy esters, ripe banana, and bubblegum. Some minor. Love notes. Incredibly fruity. Sweet pale malts. Banana bread. Peppery spiciness.  Taste: Unibroue yeast kicks in immediately. Big banana bubblegum. Mild backing spiciness. Sweet pale malts bring some bready elements to the party. Peppery spiciness. As it warms the yeast becomes aggressive and overbearing. Huge punches of pineapple and banana. Spiciness builds becoming sharply peppered. Sweet, incredibly sweet by the end. Cracker and bread crust.  Mouthfeel: Lively carbonation on a body that runs toward light but ultimately end up medium. Nicely dry. Slightly smooth.  Overall: You want Unibroue yeast, this is the starter itself!  The first sip is delicious. As it warms, any balance it could have goes out the window. Sweet, but not sugary. If you love the style, it's definitely worth checking out.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,shigg85,4.75,"Bought a bottle of this from M&R Liquors in Vernon, Connecticut. Poured into a Rochefort goblet. Beautiful light gold bubbly ale with a petry dish foam and a semi-clear consistency. Smells of green apple, clove, banana, pear, wheat, hops, and honey. Taste similarly follows with the green apple sweetness lingering in the aftertaste. The only flaw of this is how the flavor dies off a bit as the brew begins to warm (uncharacteristic of a stronger brew), and it has a bit too much excess gas. Other than that, this is an outstanding brew that is easily one of my all-time favorites. Enjoy!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,Scott_McCool,4.5,"Wow, I wasn't expecting this. Big sticky head. Cloudy yellow color. Tingles on the tongue. Slight hints of Orange Peel. Sneaky high alcohol content. Refreshing yet tastes great. My wife, with beer tastes very different than mine, also loved it. One of my new favorites.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Belgian-y, very Belgian-y. T-Wonderful triple, slight warmth, excellent maltiness. As others have said, this is textbook stuff. M-Hard for me to describe..but it's nice.  Overall this beer is a true winner in my book. It is without question in ranks as one of the best Triples in the world.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,snaotheus,4.5,"750ml bottle poured into a pair of large snifters  Pours cloudy straw yellow with a big fluffy pale head that fades to about a quarter inch dense layer. Smell is yeasty, bananas, funk, cloves, sweetness.  Taste is crisp but sweet with nice yeasty flavors and more clove and bananas. Slight tartness to accentuate the sweetness nicely. Tartness probably helps out with the impression of crispness.  Mouthfeel is light and pleasant. Overall, this is very good. A beer that I go back to time and again. I'm very surprised I've never reviewed it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,VelvetExtract,3.98,"A-Pours a hazy golden straw color. Head is fluffed and creamy. Head dies off a bit but laces very well.  S-Belgian by design. Fruited yeast notes. Light grassy Noble hop aromas. Sweet malty aroma too. Not exceptionally intense, but there lies a fair amount of complexity. A very textbook Tripel.  T-Also a bit lighter than expected. I enjoy that though, because I find many Tripels to be too yeasty and boozy. This is mellow and exciting. Grassy hops, fruity and yeast. Grains and light spice. Light bitterness. Lingering overall flavor. All-in-all quite tasty.  M-Lighter than the 9% ABV would lead you to initially believe. A bit syrupy, but the carbonation masks up the stickiness a bit. Moderately dry.  O/D-Have had this before. I can see why this is so highly regarded. One of the more drinkable Tripels I have had. Price tag is a bit steep, but its a classic. Canada does Belgium well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Nose carries notes of light fruit, peach and apple with Belgian yeast and sugar.  Flavor follows the nose in characteristics. Pretty malt forward.  Mouth is medium bodied and very effervescent with very high carbonation.  Overall it's a solid beer. Haven't had it in about a decade. Don't need to have it again any time soon.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Chickenhawk9932,4.58,"Pours a beautiful golden color with a frothy white head, good retention and nice lacing.  Smells of sour yeast and banana. A fairly clean nose.  Taste is banana up front with a nice chewy bready malt middle. A very nice sting from the carbonation with some bitter spice notes - clove. An excellent beer, maybe not a lot going on, but the few notes are played excellently and come together in a beautiful harmony of flavor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mick303,4.52,"Colour is a medium gold, very hazy. Tried without yeast then with addition, which proved a positive development. This had surprising little lacing, was expecting more.  Aroma has corn, maltiness, with plenty of nice spice. Alcohol esters are blended and masked with green apple, yeast, and berry aromas.  Taste and mouthfeel of this are exceptional. Maintains a nice crispness of carbonation hiding the alcohol well. Flavour is very well balanced, with strong malt, full bodied with a great complexity. Slight lemon, resin, slight alcohol esters.  Will get it again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BigTuna,4.23,"Pours light with a creamy topper that settles down nicely. This beer puts off a spicy aroma that knocked me off track at first, but I got used to it. My notes say ""almost gross, but not quite."" It's weird. However, the taste more than makes up for the smell of this little wonder. Tastes like a million spices mixed beautifully in one bottle, along with hints of acidic fruits (orange, lemon, etc.) and banana bread. It's difficult to articulate the taste. Carbonation level is relatively high, but it gives the beer a soothing drinkability.  Overall: an excellent, excellent beer. I was skeptical after my first sniff, but it still blew my socks off.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,DannyHartman,4.38,"WOW !!.... What a shock.... I'm not a big fan of lagers, but this lager is anything but.... The look of it as you pour it into a glass is that of an unfiltered wheat beer.... A thick golden color with a well balanced head.... It has a strong nose of citrus with a taste to match it.... Your mouth is left with a strong, yet pleasant, aftertaste that lingers.... I enjoy this brew as much as any from this Canadian based brewery.... A must have.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,drakkath,4.09,"341ml bottle into 32oz mug  a: dark yellow, 1/2 inch head from side pour. Lots of carbonation bubbles throughout drinking  s: very yeasty, some banna, ""spices""  t: fruity (bananas mostly) , yeasty, warm alcohol, some malty sweetness. The yeast and alcohol become more noticeable as the beer warms  m: well carbonated, light to medium bodied. Seems to feel thicker as it warms  o: Although a little yeastier than I personally prefer, but was my first Tripel foray and I was impressed. This took me around 1 hour to finish one bottle, and should be respected by drinking slowly. This is definately not my style of beer, but I respect the complexity of this brew enough to weed through my own personal bias and rate it on my interpretation of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Converge,4.54,"341ml bottle poured into a 16oz goblet.  A - Pours an effervescent golden-orange, with a surprisingly fizzy, short-lived head of white bubbles. Lots of haze hanging around in the glass from the yeast. I'm a little shocked at the total lack of head here after a few minutes; it just doesn't look right...  S - A little different than what I was expecting, and not nearly as pungent an aroma as I had anticipated. Still, the aroma present is very nice. Ripe fruits, citrus, bready wheat, and that distinct spicy/floral Unibroue house yeast. Less spices, grassy hops, and crisp dryness than I'm used to with this style. This reminds me a lot of two other Unibroue beers, in Blonde de Chambly and La Gaillarde.  T - Follows the nose quite a bit, although the flavors are a little more pronounced than the aroma. Fruitiness upfront, with apple, peach, and lots of citrus. Tons of yeast, spicy and floral, and delicious. Very bready, and less spicy than most tripels, although the dry spiciness does appear in the finish, along with a subtle grassy hop and crisp wheat flavor. Alcohol is minimal. Overall a delicious brew.  M - Excellent mouthfeel. Creamy smooth, yet crisp and refreshing. The body definitely carries some weight, but it isn't syrupy or oily at all. Bubbly carbonation, although not too much so. Yeasty residue builds up on the palate after a while.  D - A complex but accessible tripel from one of my favorite breweries. I can't help but feel a touch disappointed in the end though. While this is definitely a world class beer, and one of the best tripels period, this didn't totally blow me away, and it wasn't really miles apart from similar offerings from Unibroue. I would consider Blonde de Chambly, La Gaillarde, and Eau Benite to be, in ways, quite comparable to La Fin Du Monde. But that's no knock on this brew, as I've enjoyed all of those afformentioned comparisons immensely.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

All the aromatics point towards wit beer type spices. Taste is rather densent. In between a wit and tripel. Corrinder and celery seed with spice malts followed by smooth tripel action.

22,34,Founders_Fanatic,4.88,"I've been drinking this beer for a while. I had to acquire the Belgian taste, but I'm hooked. I bought a sampler 12-pack of Unibroue (La Fin Du Monde, La Gaillarde, Blonde de Chambly, Blanche de Chambly) in Montreal for $16, can you believe that price. Amazing! Now for the review. Poured into a tulip from a 341mL bottle. A: Golden yellow, 1 1/2 fingers of white 'pillow' head, great retention, lots of lacing, champagne bubbles, clear. The head of this beer makes it really stand out in appearance. S: Spices, floral, light fruit (apple, pear), yeast and lots of it. T: Spices, clove, slight apple, sweet honey, and yeast...lot of it M: Crisp, dry finish, sticky, medium almost heavy body. The body is very nice once the beer warms a little bit. O: Great beer, Unibroue does the best Belgian style beers outside of Belgium. It's amazing how they can distribute throughout Canada and parts of the US and Europe and still have this great taste. Will I buy this again? Absolutely.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Ilafan,4.29,"I really like this beer. The pour is quite light and yellowish. The smell is very clear with dominate fruits at its core. The taste was one of the best I've had. It is quite smooth, and despite 9% alcohol, it doesn't overwhelm the beer. The fruitiness (orange? apricot?) is very pleasant. There are also a slight caramel malt taste to it. Overall, those folks up in Quebec done did it good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TheCondor,4.42,"Obtained from a Sommelier Selection six pack of Unibroue beers. This was the crown jewel of the pack. I had no idea I was in possession of the top-rated Tripel on all of BA in this bottle until recently. Side poured with standard vigor from the bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance - Pours a cloudy yellow color with a nice, two finger pillowy white head that sticks around for a minute but leaves little lacing. Nothing special about the packaging. Heavy carbonation action can be seen in the bubbles inside the glass.  Smell - Smells wonderful, like a big, yeasty fruit bomb. All tripel, all the way.  Taste - The taste is very layered, with the initial creamy smoothness of breads and yeast followed with a slight fruitiness in the middle. Apricots, a little banana, and other fruits are all present on the palate. An excellent drink. There is a hint of alcohol, but nothing overwhelming. Just enough to let you know its there.  Mouthfeel - Finishes smooth and creamy, with pretty substantial carbonation.  Overall - I can see why this beer is so highly rated...it deserves it. Excellent from the time it is poured into your glass until the last drink. Highly recommended, I will buy and drink this again. This is a strong candidate for one of the best beers I've ever had, and I wouldn't be ashamed to show up at any beer party with this in tow.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

T: As with the smell it is very complex. All the same tastes as listed above but the finish pretty nice. There is a little must like with most tripels but it is overshadowed by fruity flavors. Also a good sweetness.  M: Very bubbly. While not being overwhelming it has a bit of a rough feel to it. Otherwise sits pretty good with a light medium body.  Overall a very nice showing. Certainly shines above most tripels. It's pretty widely available and worth checking out.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,Raime,3.88,"Poured from a bottle into a lager glass. Pours a light copper with a one finger head with carbonation bubbles rising steadily. Leaves decent lacing. The smell is of wheat, citrus, and perhaps a little bit of grapefruit. Tastes very much like a wheat ale, Although very pleasant without the lemon dish soap aftertaste. Some mild citrus, very faint hops, And light malt. The mouthfeel keeps the same flavors although it greatly opens ip the wheat. the citrus also comes through a bit more. Overall, It reminded me of a very good wheat ale. Would I buy it again? Yes, although I am not a huge fan of any beer with wheat flavor. But this one was good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Dreadnaught33,4.71,"This is a great beer, I pass this over way too many times, incredibly flavorful and looks amazing.  The beer pours a beautiful by the book hazy orange and gold color with a head that just will not die, a huge fluffy bone white beauty. Outstanding.  The smell is not huge, but has a nice yeasty mix of flavors with some nice fruity esters and bubble gum sweetness, a great spicy clove note too, it's really quite nice.  The beer just bursts with flavors, an outstanding note of clove and coriander with some great sweet and savory malt and taffy bubble gum like flavors, great apple, grape, banana, and stone fruit flavors too. It's super rich and the alcohol is covered in a delectably sweet blanket without any heat but only adding complexities and big flavors. I can't think of any tripels I've enjoyed more than this in flavor.  The feel strikes a great balance of bubbly and great medium body. No burn but only a long lingering complex flavor.  An outstanding beer, I can see why even though this is not rare by any means, this beer is still clinging to its place in the top 100.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Fruity, yeasty, delicious. Chalky sweetness.  Is this the best tasting beer in the world? If not, it'll do until the best comes along. It's everything I love about a Trippel. Sweet, tart, malt, yeast, all at once. Just enough hoppiness for perfect balance. The alcohol is very well hidden but certainly there.  Mouthfeel is perfect. Smooth with just the right amount of carbonation.  Overall this is one of my favorite beers. If you like tripels this is a must try.

However, La Fin Du Monde stands out as being a real perfection of the trippel style with that lip smackin long lastin delicious good taste of the CanadianBelgianFrench yeast strain. Don't let the appearance fool you; this is a pale, clearish straw golden beer with large-ish bubbles (it seemed to me) that were bolder than the measley, weakling bubbles produced by Cristal, for example. However it is no Pabst!! You'll notice it stinks; spicy is a good start but the banana and fruit really clobber you after that. Once drinking is commenced the Fin du Monde tastes like a perfectly spiced Indian dessert- cardamom and clove flavors are present. The carbonation is just about spot on. For my first ever restaurant-beer and a blind choice by me with no prior knowledge of Unibroue or La Fin other than a love of the trippel style, I'd rate this a 6/5.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The malt here is honey. Some ginger here as well. Flavor is amazingly well-balanced and in check.  M - Perfect. Medium-bodied. So well-balanced through the sip; the body is the same as it enters your mouth through the time you swallow it. Silky in feel.  D - Simply one of the greatest beers I've ever had.

The sweet malt sticks out a lot, along side the candy sugar. I am also picking up a strong raisin and citrus flavor.  M: This is the only part of the beer that I am not too crazy about.

A - A deep rich yellow which looks as if it were dense straw. The head is large and coated with small bubbles. Ample lacing makes this a beautiful Tripel.  S - An explosion of sweet banana and fruits alongside spices that tickle the nose. Comes together on the rear with some sweet malts.  T - Follows the nose with the addition of big malts, sweet honey and some citrus. This beer is not for every occasion, although if one is looking for a desert beer with big ABV and smooth taste, this is the one.  M - The hops burst and tingle the palette and recede as the carbonation eases off. Big bodied with a light crisp taste. Fantastic.

Appearance: I don't know if the fridge conked out or something, but there was an enormous amount of foam with this beer, even when poured sideways. When the head finally dissipated, leaving nice lacing, it was golden at the edges and a dark straw at the centre, and more than a bit cloudy.  Smell: smoky and quite spicy, which was unusual, faint sweet and fruity notes.  Moutfeel: a perfect balance of thickness and fizz, it goes down very well.  Taste: it delivers on the promises its smell makes, with a nice piquance in front and not excessively hoppy. It finishes a bit citrusy, and malty. Very interesting, and very smooth for its alcohol content (9%)  Drinkability: it goes down well without offending the senses, and while it is not to my usual taste, it is quite nice, with a pleasant buzz to boot.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,schoolboy,4.3,"Jun 29, 2012 This is a great, easy drinking tripel. It is complex and well made and is something I should buy more often.  It produces a nice head and great lace. There is a reasonable amount of haziness and little or no sedement (unexpected).  The taste is very light for such a big beer. The aftertaste is the highpoint - wonderful. I would like the beer if it were more tart, but I like it the way it is just fine as well. Recommended!  July 22, 2021 Had a few other Unibroues recently, then picked up a six pack with six different Unibroues although I had tried all but Ce n'est pas La Fin Du Monde. So I set up a back to back of La Fin Du Monde and Ce n'est pas La Fin Du Monde. One is a tripel and the other is a Belgian IPA with similar characteristics (yeast, hops, water but different malts?). Probably lots of tweaks.  By itself, this is a really well behavied. Mild for the style and easy drinking. It's so easy to forget how strong this is. You'll just have to look at Ce n'est pas La Fin Du Monde to see how this story ends.  July 28, 2022  It sure feels like the end of the fucking world. This brew tastes even better when you live in a fucked up country like the United States. We need a breathe of sanity. This brew is so clear in what it does, cleanly delivering great tasting yeasty deliciousness like only these French Canadians can. Highly recommended. I, of course, buy these on a whim any time I see them. They keep really well and age (improve parts of the character). My one trip to France I tried hard to drink as any Belgian style brews as possible. There were some clinkers, some good ones, but none as clean as Unibroue.

Medium body on this is still pretty heavy feeling, but it becomes lighter as it warms.  O: very good tripel, but I am just about done with spice as I've had a lot of spiced beers in the last couple of days. Will come back to it, but I don't think it's quite on par with the trappist versions.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The nose is full of fruity esters, notes of banana, heavy clove, some notes of lemon. Taste features more of the same as the nose. Very estery, lots of spice, and nice balance. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Overall, delicious example of style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,brureview,4.25,"Served in a tulip. This bottle has been cellared for about 6 months.  I have tasted Fin Du Monde in the past and I was very impressed.  This experience was slightly different. It's a great beer, but I have tasted other tripels since for comparison.  The beer poured a four fingered head. Beautiful light tan color.  The smell from the head is lemon with a strong clove scent. The smells get stronger with warming.  The mouthfeel is slightly carbonated but pleasant.  The taste is excellent- strong cloves and lemon, but a bit tart and slightly bitter. I recall slight bitterness in my last tasting, but for some reason, it seemed more pronounced this time. A friend who was drinking with me also shared the last session with Fin De Monde, and felt that it didn't taste as good as the last time. Not sure, but the cellaring could have had an effect- but the beer should have tasted better with slight aging.  Overall, a great tripel. Recently, I tried the St. Bernardus tripel, which is much smoother and more malty than the fin. I also like the Allagash tripel. So when it comes to tripels, one of my favorite styles, it is best to try a lot of them and rotate tastings.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

T: The taste is where this beer shines. Oh my, what a flavor explosion. I don't know where to start... tropical fruits, pineapple, bananas, mango, strong cloves and spice, alcohol warmth just at the end. Sweetness from what I would guess is candi sugar. This is easily one of the most complex beers I have ever had, but yet I'd call it fairly drinkable, although alcohol is definitely playing a part in the flavor profile. Excellent.  F: Light mouthfeel, very carbonated. If the carbonation was a bit lower on this beer, I think it would be better, but it might mute the aroma even more. Appropriate for style.  O: Most of the attributes of this beer are good, but the taste is just spectacular, world-class in my opinion. Great beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

While the alcohol scent is strong, it isn't bad at all. The taste is something else. Very floral and grainy. Belgian yeast gives it a nice flavor. Bananas, clove, citrus. So much going on here. Feels thick with medium carbonation.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,A_Phrance,4.7,"A: Poured into a pint glass, the beer has an appealing color somewhere between yellow and orange. It makes you think of the slightly citrusy flavor you will exoerience. Depending on how delicately and patiently you pour it, there can be a lot or virtually no head. I had about a centimeter of head that fizzled down to a thin layer that persisted throughout drinking.  S: One of my favorite aspects of this beer. Citrus and yeast with a slight malt scent and some spice. Very inviting.  T: Also awesome. Fruity and citrusy but with a spice (I assume this is actually from the 9% alcohol). Slight bitterness but not distracting from the overall flavor. Very satisfying and drinkable yet with a lot of flavor.  F: In my opinion this is the beer's weakest point. Still feels great, but some beers are certainly better. Almost creamy with a pleasant carbonation. The alcohol has a very slight kick, but much more disguised than you might expect in a 9% beer. Nice, but not quite perfect.  O: If you haven't tried this, you really have to. Very worth the positive ratings it receives. One of the best beers I've tried to date.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The aroma is really interesting - tons of melon and banana along with a ton of sweetness. Digging deeper there is some pepper and clove to be found as well.  Due to the aroma I was at first thinking that this beer is extremely sweet. And while it certainly seems sweeter than the average tripel, overall the flavor is much more balanced. There are some nice doughy bread notes and honeydew in the flavor.  Nice full body, and the abv hides well enough under the complexities of the flavor and aroma. Clean finish.  Overall this is a beer worthy of its praise... I know several BMC drinkers that claim this to be their favorite beer, and whom buy this for parties despite never considering any other craft options.  For myself, tripel has never been a style I got very excited about. I'd be happy drinking this at any party, but for my own buck, I'd just as readily spend it on some of the Trappist examples instead.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Beautiful beer!  The smell is phenomenal... Apricot, cloves, and bananas... With a bit of spicy, peppery notes as well. Lovely yeasty smell ties it all together so well.  The taste is exceptional... Smooth and malty sweet with wonderful fruitiness... A little spice comes on stronger as the beer warms a bit. Citrus and a mild hop bitterness comes in faintly as well. It's hard to tell this is 9% as the alcohol is very well hidden in this perfectly balanced triple!  Wow, this is a beer that lives up to the hype.. So perfectly balanced and tasty with the alcohol so well masked that you can truly taste the complexity. I need to try one of these aged maybe. A must try..

22,34,deadonhisfeet,4.18,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a proper La Fin Du Monde snifter. This is a freaking GORGEOUS pour. It's deep gold and crystal clear with cascading bubbles. The head is white and fluffy and fairly well-sustained. The nose is somewhat grapey and winey with notes of apple skins and pears.  The beer is medium bodied and has a good, firm mouthfeel. The flavor is something of a surprise. You expect to get the sweetness of a Tripel on the front of the palate, but you don't. You get an explosion of carbonation that makes you immediately think of champagne. Then, at mid-palate, you get a sizeable wave of semi-sweet grape and marmalade flavors accompanied by a pleasant, flowery dryness which intensifies to the finish. The high carbonation complements the taste very well, but I feel that it overpowers and hides some subtle flavors.  Before summing this up, let me say that Tripels are not my favorite style. That said, this beer is the perfect Tripel to complement Trois Pistoles (the Belgian Strong Dark Ale from Unibroue). Both have enigmatic flavor profiles that are difficult to wrap your head around. You think you know what's coming when you take a sip, but somehow the flavors seem surprising. This beer (and it's cousin) are not everyday pours, but definitely deserve repeated visits from every Beer Advocate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

A lot of head at first, but it dissipates fairly quickly. Beautiful hazy orange-gold color with beautiful white lacing. High marks.  Unibroue's wonderful Belgian yeast strain is front and center on the nose. Sweet fruits and candi sugar underneath. GOD this smells amazing.  The taste follows the smell very closely. Sweet without being cloying, with just a touch of bitterness in the finish. The 9% ABV is hidden INSANELY well.  Carbonation is spot-on, viscosity is medium-high. Really sticks around in the mouth.

22,34,SirPils,4.97,"Appearance: Golden and frothy with a quickly dissipating half inch head. Poured into stemmed tulip glass, nice lacing down the glass as it was drunk. Some bottle sediment leaked into second pour, a bit cloudy but still a beautiful beer.  Smell: An ephemeral experience, with clove, apricot, and banana notes. A spicy, almost pepper note was detected, but I can't really place it.  Taste: No obvious alcohol in the beginning, with a strong apricot and citrus note that gives way to a bit of spice as the beer warms up. Alcohol is restrained throughout the tasting, keeping the citrus and apricot front and center.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, but somehow bold at the same time. Almost creamy. Dangerously drinkable, I may go through three to four pours of this one before even noticing it.  Overall: My first tripel, and a wonderful departure from my days of college PBR. A beer I can easily see taking me from being a wine guy to a beer guy. I love it, looking forward to learning more.  For my inexperienced beer palate, it is the best I've ever tasted, but judging from the other reviews about this beer, I'm certainly not alone in thinking so.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

T/M: A vibrant carbonated tingle on the palate that opens up to funky esters, robust orchard fruits, bananas, and subtle spices. A small amount of smoked wood that compliments the dry finish of tangy apples.  O: Wow! This is truly a delicious tripel. I loved everything about it.

22,34,stakem,4.08,"12oz bottle into a cervoise. The brew appears a hazed golden yellow with 2 fingers worth of creamy off-white head. Rising bubbles of carbonation maintain more than a finger of froth atop the solution. As the cap fades, some patches of lace stick to the glass.  The aroma is spicy with yeast that comes across with some mild fruity notes like pear and apple that blend with some clove and pepper. The alcohol is evident with a fruity ester that accents the previously mentioned apple and pear and draws out more of a brighter citrus quality that is zesty.  The taste is yeasty with a spice of clove that blends into a bit of pepper before the onset of fruity notes of apple, pear and some melons. There is a solid grain inclusion that is light and almost bready that eases the transition between yeasty spice and fruity alcohol. For 9% the brew finishes surprisingly crisp but quite warming.  This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. For 9% it is easily approachable and enjoyable but carries with it a warmth that is to be respected. It has a good rounded character about it that makes it dangerously light and refreshing. I could see myself getting in trouble with several bottles of this despite the warming impact it has.

22,34,thecheapies,4.44,"Best before 07-27-14. Poured into a Westvleteren goblet.  Trapped much of the yeast cake inside the bottle off of the pour. Body is a hazy lemon yellow color. I poured this rather daintily thinking the head would be voluminous. Turns out, I only get a half-inch and it fizzled out. The beer looks pretty highly carbonated. 3.5  Bready, doughy yeast up front with a spice drop backing. Clove yeast esters with hints of banana and pear. Smells pretty superb. Not overly sweet (like some Belgians) or spicy (like many crafts) for a tripel, and I appreciate that. 4.5  Big yeast component in the taste (indicative of Unibroue brewing), but it fits the style and is almost matched by massively bready pale malts and a clove spice zing. Initial fruits imply banana, but the finish gets washed with flavors of apple and white grape. Still, the fruitiness is not the focal point. Quite the opposite end of the spectrum from Tripel Karmeliet. Reminds me a bit of Ename Tripel or maybe Chimay White. There’s the usual sneaky alcohol that shakes you up after two-thirds the drink. A fantastic tripel. 4.5  Medium-high carbonation, almost high. Deceivingly spritzy. Heavier than medium body. Feels big and bready and all the while dry and palatable. Nice feel. 4.0  More often than not, I have been disappointed with Unibroue as a whole. But, La Fin Du Monde is an elite beer, no question.

Slightly tart and fizzy on the tongue and it goes down smooth, with some yeast and breadiness on the end. A very very slight bit of heat coming through, but no taste of actual alcohol.

There is a fair amount of retention which reduces to a constant 8th inch head throughout the glass.  The smell is what is expected of a good tripel - banana, malt, ester, belgian yeast, sugars, mild citrius, and an ever present hint of alcohol. very pleasant and warming.  The taste is packed with complex flavors - a fruity/floral hop front which is balanced by a subtle malt back ground all encompassed by the typical, delicious belgian yeast flavor. There's a good bit of sugary flavor, but it's nothing close to cloying or overwhelming. Amazingly pleasant. There's also a slight bit of alcohol in the back end which warms everything up without being harsh or unpleasant.  the mouthfeel is medium thick and luxurious accompanied by plenty of carbonation. it's so satisfying and really begs for another sip. i have to admit it gets me tipsy quite quickly, but if I could, I would drinks all night long, glass after glass.

It is this observers opinion that this beer, along with the rest of the Unibroue line, are cheap imitations of noble beer styles, all with an artificial tasting backbone. I really don't understand all the acclaim this beer continues to receive, but there must be something wrong with me, as just about everyone from the uninitiated to the most seasoned beer enthusiasts seem to give it such high praise.

It doesn't have all the taste, but the initial body of the beer definitely reminds me of a wheaty/yeasty unfiltered.  There's a lot of subtleness to this brew though. Part of me wants to say there's a very subtle sourness around it (not a bad kind though), probably from the yeast. A bit of spicyness...a light fruity sweetness.  European beers always ring differently to my tastebuds. They always seem to have excellent balance and can easily flit between a subtle but bold body (how this one feels to me) and a complex but balanced beer (like say, Matilda, a Belgian strong).  This isn't a bad beer at all, but I don't really see it being the most addictive beer I'll ever have per se.

An incredible city, but it's still not in Belgium. Anyway, here's the math half:  Appearance: gorgeous.

Mouthfeel is near-perfect as well with semi-sharp carbonation offsetting the lack of bite from the taste - this thing tickles the physical mouth at proper aggression level while soothing taste buds in a stealthily satisfiying way.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,alexipa,4.62,"This one took me by surprise. Poured out of a bottle into a standard pint glass.  Appearance: beautifully hazy orange-yellow. Reminiscent of any great light belgian.  Smell: fruity, fantastic. Nothing more to say here...  Taste: What the heck?! This beer is nearly flawless. I can definitely taste the 9%, which is the only drawback I see for it. It's creamy, light, and dangerous.  Mouthfeel: Carbonated a little more than I would have liked. Still fantastic.  Just try this beer. Another hit from Unibroue, they are shaping up to be one of my favorite breweries.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bluHatter,5,"A: Light cloudy dark yellow or very light orange in color, with a nice gentle foamy head that very slowly dissipates, leaving behind perfectly beautiful lacing.  S: Spicy yeast, a bit of fruit - sourdough. Banana bread. Complex nose here.  T: Sweet and spicy, with a hint of whipped lemon meringue. Yeast, sourdough bread. Loads of complexity here - every sip is different and grows on the last one.  M: It looks light, but still waters run deep. It has a distinctive whipped quality that makes it feel almost like you're drinking cream or meringue. It's frothy and smooth with just a slight alcohol bite - but really the 9% ABV is hidden so expertly here that you hardly notice it at all.  O: What can I say, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this beer, at all. It is incredible. True to its ominous name, if the end of the world were truly upon us, this is the beer I'd want to be drinking when it all went down.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Dave1999,4.35,"This beer is a cloudy yellow/orange with a tiny thin white head.  The smell is sweet,cloves, banana and bubble gum. Pretty subtle though.  The taste is sweet and heavy on the cloves with a bitter after taste.  The mouth feel is quite thick and creamy with a medium level of carbonation.  This is a really good beer, the alcohol is well hidden and is very drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Nice lacing that fades Real fruity with all kinds of things going through nose. alcohol in smell but not noticeable in taste. Spicy in nose and taste, rounds out with yeasty aftertaste.

22,34,blackbyte01,4.65,"Bottle to pint glass (leaving yeast sediment behind)  A: Light Golden color with medium haziness. Pours one finger of thick white head with great Belgian style lacing.  S: Very complex aroma, mainly characterized by spicy phenols and fruity esters: a great combination of pepper, citrus, cloves, and some bananas. A soft alcohol smell is hardly noticeable but still present.  T: Very yeasty, biscuity, and malty sweet flavor (perhaps some candi sugar). Begins with cloves and citrus, already present in the aroma, and finishes dry with some moderate hop bitterness. The alcohol is well hidden and only noticeable by a warm feeling in the throat.  M: Medium bodied beer with high effervescent carbonation.  O: An excellent beer. This is probably one of the best examples of non-Belgian tripel I've ever tried. The hidden alcohol taste makes this beer highly drinkable: a lovely marriage of complexity and drinkability. If you loved this beer, I suggest you try the Dragonmead Final Absolution as well (similar in style, quality, and provenience).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Light and refreshing.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Hopdaemon39,3.82,"Marked ""Best before 10-11-14"" on the bottle. This was a difficult beer to review. I had this several times long before I got into beer and have not had it in several years.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip- pours a yellow golden color with a three finger head, which quickly dissipated, and left almost no lacing.  Smell's very sweet. I smell some banana, a little bit of yeast, and a little bit of booze (very subtle).  Taste is also very sweet- not like the tripels that I know and love (Delirium Tremens, St. Bernardus, De Dolle Dulle Teve). Definitely sweet malts and a little alcohol coming through along with a bit of yeast. There's an additional characteristic to the sweetness that is hard to describe- for me though it's too sweet without enough Belgian yeast backing.  Mouthfeel is excellent- medium light body with excellent carbonation. This doesn't taste like a tripel to me- all of Unibroue's beers have a unique characteristic. I wish I knew the ingredients and the process.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TappaKeggaBrew,4.08,"A: Cloudy, pale golden color. Head was 2 fingers of frothy off-white, with decent lingering and nice lacing.  S: Sourdough bread. Also some floral and spicy pepper notes. Almost a cross between a Lambic and a Belgian Witbier.  T: A little sweet when it first touches the tongue, but the sour notes quickly dominate. The grains don't really come through at all. The finish was a little dry, with late and lingering bitterness.  M: Very crisp and heavily carbonated. The alcohol burn was present, but very mild despite the 9% ABV.  O: A solid contender in its class. I'd have another, but I wouldn't spend a lot of money to get one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,monique,3.5,"A - nice colour  S - banana, yeasty with a hint of sweetness  T - clean crisp with no aftertaste.  M - no bite, drinks nice  Overall, a nice fruity drinkable beer.

22,34,Yeoman9459,4.5,"Poured in a La Trappe glass.  Appearance - brown colour with read around the edges. Bright white head that turns in to a thin layer ontop of the beer.  Smell - typical tripel yeast smell, banana, candy sugar.  Taste - sweet maltiness, banana. Follows the nose fairly well but not as much candy in the taste. The alcohol is a warmind sensation but there isn't any taste of it.  Mouthfeel - As it warms the carbonation becomes less apparent. Medium bodied.  Overall - this is a great beer, great brewery. Fortunately readily available in Ontario, considering we don't get many exceptional beers this is always ncie to grab from the beer store.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BlackBelt5112203,3.81,"12 oz bottle poured into a La Fin Du Monde tulip glass at cellar temperature.  L - Pale gold color, hazy, with a 3 finger white creamy head. Looks like you could eat it with a spoon. Crazy good retention and nice lacing.  S - Spicy yeast aroma, almost witbier-like, which kind of caught me by surprise, citrus aromas like orange and lemon, and some other spices as well.  T - Follows the aroma with a spicy yeast bite, the sweetness and tanginess of the citrus flavors, and more spicy flavors like cloves coming through. Slightly bitter at the finish. No alcohol noticeable at all which is remarkable for 9% ABV.  F - Medium-bodied, definitely well-carbonated, with a crisp and dry finish. Creamy, mouth-coating texture especially if you swish it around in your mouth a little bit. Still no sign of the alcohol, which is astounding.  O - I've heard a lot of good things about this beer and it was definitely tasty. I'm not going to say I haven't had better Tripels, but one sure positive regarding this beer is the way it hides the alcohol. No sign of it anywhere at any point. The major downside is that it just smells and drinks way too much like a witbier for my taste. Nevertheless, it is highly drinkable and seems well-suited for a hot summer day.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The smell is amazing. clove, lemon, probably some wierd herbs, and a candy smell.  The taste and flavors are layered at levels that are hard to describe.

The smell is outstanding. Clove, lemon, all sorts of herbs, light candy. Tastes like it smells. Not boozy at all for a tripel.

Apple, pear, clove, black pepper, yeast, and booze. Getting some earthy tones off the first sip, that black pepper is back also. This beer definitely doesn't hide the fact that it's 9%. This beer is smooth at first, but i'm not digging the carbonation on the way down. Overall a very very solid Tripel, but I've had better.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S: Pungent soapy yeast, bright pale malt sweetness, poached pear, juicy nectarine, little bit of pineapple. A hint of horseblanket.  T: Sugary blanket of soft, yeasty esters. Vanilla bean, golden raisin, angel cake, white peach, cloves, coriander. Spicy phenols give way to some subtle yeasty funk. A little metallic in the finish, with a breath of fresh pale malt, spices, and a little alcohol.  M: Almost thick-bodied, creamy.  O: Incredibly smooth, complex, and balanced. It should be hard to find a better tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with lots of good carbonation. Slight fluffiness to this body.  Overall - Good representation of a tripel by Unibroue.

Yeast and spice aromas present as well. Slightly bready and estery. I also get notes of lemon.  Taste initially follows the nose with prominent banana, clove and spice characteristics. Lingering clove and spice. Slight grassiness. Yeast and bread characteristics also come through. Finish is lingering clove and spice with slight esters.  Mouthfeel is tingly from the effervescence. Highly carbonated, medium full body.  Overall, quite impressive. Love the champagne-like quality of the carbonation, makes it an interesting drinking experience.

Bright, fresh, fruity aroma of lemons, apples and pineapple. Banana and cloves. Lots of yeast but perfectly balanced in the nose. Perfect amount of spicy hops. Alcohol is nowhere to be found.  Incredible flavor. Hoppy ginger and lemon bite in perfect balance with wheat bread and fruity malt backbone. Sweet and tart at the same time. Hint of menthol. Delicious and smooth through and through. Yeast flavor in the finish is smooth and solidifies the whole experience.  Exceptional feel with medium body and smooth texture. Excites the tongue with a subtle yet lively carbonation. Finishes on the dry side with residual yeast texture.  Everything about this beer is awe inspiring!

It looks slightly hazy in the brown bottle and I can see some sediment.  A- Pours a slightly hazy gold color into a snifter with a one inch head that quickly dissipated to a foamy cap. Many lines of tiny bubbles.  S- What a magnificent nose. Sweetness, probably the alcohol but under that the malt and a hint of hops. Fresh fruit and floral notes. Deep, rich and persistent.  T- The taste is amazing. Mango, pineapple, mildly sweet up front giving way to a cider like tang at the finish. Some yeast notes in the finish.  M- Full bodied, carbonation is noticeable like a good sparkling wine. Carbonation yields to a velvety texture.  O- This is a very complex, well made triple with a huge flavor profile. I really want to give this a 5 but I didn't get the big creamy head that is supposed to be typical for this style. I'm not sure it is reasonable to expect a creamy head since this is bottle conditioned with carbonation that reminds me of fine Champaign.

It’s a bit hazy with about two fingers’ worth of thick off-white colored foam that dissipates somewhat slowly.  Smell – a rich, spicy/herbal type of smell..thick with complex malts and hops.  Taste – as with the smell, it has a very rich and complex taste. It has a mix of herbalness and spiciness. The bitterness from the hops starts in the middle of the taste and slowly blends to a mild intensity in the finish, but the aftertaste is a little bubbly like champagne.  Mouthfeel – very well balanced, leaning neither on the watery nor on the creamy sides.  Overall – very interesting brew, with a very intriguing taste.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,DirtyPenny,4.31,"Poured into a Birra Moretti goblet. Burping added a little interference to this one, as I'd had beer brats made with a few bottles of Narragansett for supper earlier (and they were delicious).  A: Honey golden with light platinum gold highlights. Rich stuff. Poured with two+ inches of creamy white foam which shrank away quickly. Foam clings for dear life to the sides of the glass. Attempts to retain free will as individual glob of foam. Some does for a while, but all are re-assimilated back into the colony eventually. There is no escape.  S: Yeasty with notes of banana and citrus.  T: Sweet banana and cloves with a little hop spice on the backend, all amid a faint haze of alcohol, with a citrus tingle that hangs around at your house after the party is over and shyly asks if you want to make out. Flavors sharpen as the brew warms.  M: Creamy and a touch on the thick side.  O: Been a while since I've had a really fantastic beer. I mean, I got a lot of good beer over the holidays, but nothing that really made me crave another one immediately afterward.

Smell is yeasty, with lemon zest and spice notes that make me happy. Some apple skin is also present.  Taste is at first citrus and tangy yeast. The middle has some malt, and the whole taste has a nice peppery flavor.  Upon first drinking there is a lemony bite to the tongue. Other than that, the beer is nice and smooth. A medium body is lightened up by great bubbly carbonation.  I have enjoyed this beer for years, and will continue to do so. A classic taste, and a great beer, with some power to boot.

The beer has this incredible floral, fruity aroma. Spring fruits, strawberries and peach blossoms, and a little citrus zest—citron, some orange zest. Smells wonderful.  Tastes amazing. Each sip is a new treat that the palate unwraps. There’s a zesty bite but it’s not a big hoppy beer. More fruit, more floral, more layers of lightly nuanced flavors. Orange peel, coriander, and those springs fruits all in perfect tandem. Crisp, sharp, and fantastic.  Absolutely resplendent.

Lacing is present and it follows the beer down the glass.  S: Bursting with aroma. I could smell it long before I put it under my nose. Heavy clove, less heavy coriander, bready yeast, biscuit and grain, pepper, light fruit, lemon and orange peel.  T: Tremendous balance...the many flavors really meld together. It’s is so unified that it makes it a challenge to dissect the flavors. The yeast, clove, pepper and coriander are there. Also, lemon, orange peel and grain. Starts a little sweet but finishes dry, featuring a warming alcohol sensation.  M: Very dry and tingly. Body is medium-light. Carbonation is high and cuts some of the dryness and adds to the enjoyment.  O: I kept finding scents and flavors in La Fin Du Monde. The dryness keeps it from being my favorite tripel, but I can’t deny that it is a wonderfully complex and well designed beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,FondueVoodoo,4.42,"A: Hazy, aged pine wood yellow. Poured a full 3 fingers of soapy giant bubbles collasping down to a lacy rim of bubbles lasting even an hour post pour.  S: As always with Unibroue, the unique yeast is definitely the first scent. Afterward, you may smell pale dried fruits like dried apricots and peaches as well as spices of cloves and fennel. The smell is complex and layered fantastic to just smell nevermind to drink...and on to that...  T: Bready yeast typical of Unibroue is abundant, a butter pastry like flavour. A combination of malt and sweet fill the mouth followed by a complex spiced mix of cloves and fennel. A balanced combination of sweet, malty and spicy.  M: A medium body, smooth aftertaste on the tongue. The bubbles burst to the surface and tingle on the tongue, this is as close to a champagne as a brew can get.  D: La Fin du Monde is a crisp and dry offering from Unibroue that is reminiscent of a dry bubbly champagne and is easy to drink. I think of this as a champagne like beer, drink in moderation for optimal enjoyment. Try with spicy thai red curry soup. The malty sweet and sharpness of the carbonation balanced off the sweet and salty. Also paired with a more classic french dish of creamy potatoes, pan fred trout and asparagus. The full flavour and dry aftertaste compliment the fish and butter in the dish - great offering.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,themind,4.49,A top notch beer! poured a nice head and the peach type aroma was strong and desirable. I would say this is a top 100 beer in the world..no doubt.

There's definitely a high sweetness level here that is cut nicely with some doughiness, in both flavor an taste: yeast, banana, pear, apricot, spice. The doughiness cuts into that sweetness nicely and allows me to really enjoy what would otherwise be a overl sweet beer for me, personally. A nice medium bodied, maybe even a little heavy creamy moutfeel. I had tried one Unibroue offering prior to this and really disliked it and almost wrote the entire brewery off.

22,34,JohnnyHopps,4.12,"I have had this beer several times. While I am impressed by the beer, I am not as overwhelmed as others. Poured from the bottle, the beer radiates a pleasant sour but fruity aroma. The scent gives a positive hint of what is to come. Giving a moderate head, the color is a cloudly golden color. The initial taste is a nice fruity sour flavor. It almost seems like a orange flavored Belgian. For some reason, I feel like the taste should be somewhat more complex. Being a Tripel, it is somewhat thick. Some might even describe it as being slightly chewy. There is some degree of spiciness in the aftertaste that is accompanied by a slight warming sensation as the beer goes down. While the aftertaste is mild, it does leave a pleasant reminder.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,magictacosinus,4.68,"Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a chalice. All the other times I've had this were out of 750ml bottles. Freshness date is “08/12/14.”  This beer is a beautiful golden-straw colored haze with a small, modest head and plenty of carbonation gliding at the rim of the glass that appears to be endless. Despite cloudiness, it's possible to see the alcohol swirling around this one, that's for sure! Quite inviting, yet more in sense how Duvel invites you only to whack you on the head if not careful with consumption. As they may tell you in Québec these days: ""Bienvenue à la fin du monde : dernier arrêt, la sobriétée !"" [""Welcome to the end of the world! Last stop: sobriety!""]  The central aroma is a combination of candy sugar and sweet maltiness, as well as plenty of spices and citrus. White grapes and apricots are prevalent here, although it really is a paradise of candied fruitiness overall for me to describe it too much in detail! This is extremely complex stuff, yet wholly enjoyable.  A delicious grape ester prevails overall in the taste, yet there are lots of other flavors coming out of this one. The sweetness is definitely a major factor, yet there's a spicy delightfulness that's present here that no tripel I've ever had featured. The hops and spices really sting the tongue and the lips, and the alcohol warms up in a dangerously fun way. Drinking this too fast could have adverse effects on sobriety indeed. However, what really shines is the thick, carbonated body of this beer. Extremely juicy and full, this is probably as thick as tripels get (yes, even more than Westmalle's, in my view).  To me, this transcends not only the tripel style, but beers as a whole. There's something really magical happening here amid the purposefully over-the-top recipe that makes you sit back and relax and enjoy life. No matter how insane and alcoholic it is by the end, it's a balanced beer unlike anything else. I'm having trouble describing it myself. However, it's a good pairing with any cuisine – especially spicy Mexican or latin food. Thai food could also work well. If not pairing with food, I recommend that it be consumed with patience and respect. This is intense yet marvelous stuff.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,gkunkle,4.27,"Pours a cloudy gold/straw color with a one finger white head. Retention isn't great but that is to be expected with a 9% ABV beer. Smell is bready, and of apples, and cloves. Taste first comes through with soft and sweet wheat, a hint of apple, A touch of alcohol, smooth sweet malts. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy. This is a fantastic triple, though not my personal favorite.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,NardiByNature,4.65,"Cloudy dark-yellow out of the bottle into a goblet. A luscious and creamy white fluff swells and settles into an even, perfect looking half cm covering. This is one noble-looking beer with its steady stream of champagne-like bubbles lustering away in the goblet by the window.  Smells like soft apples, cloves, warm rising bread, and then the banana. The nose builds as the beer warms, lingers and disappears from the glass.  Taste is baked apples, croissant-like buttery bread, soft alcohol. It has a crisp resonance on the tongue from the carbonation that I think is truly awesome in the way it balances out both the beer’s pillowy softeness and alcohol content. La Fin Du Monde’s tasty characteristics certainly place it ahead of the pack. I tried a Green Flash tripel last week on tap and it was good; this is much better.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JizackFH,4.52,"A - This beer pours a hazy golden yellow color. It has a little more than two fingers of fluffy white head resting on top. The head has good retention, and it leaves some scattered lace behind clinging to the glass.  S - The nose has a nice banana scent to it right off the bat, as well as a good amount of coriander. There is some bready malts and belgian yeast as well. Also there is a good amount of fruitiness, and some vanilla, pepper, and citrus.  T - The taste follows the nose. It starts off with some bready malts, clove banana, and coriander. There is a nice green apple flavor and some citrus. There is also some vanilla, pepper, caramel, and a light hop presence. The booze is pretty much unnoticeable. All of the flavors seem to be present in the finish.  M - This has a medium body and a little higher than average carbonation. It goes down easy and has a really smooth mouthfeel. The carbonation seems creamy and there is some spice presence. There is a little bit of dryness on the back end, and a bit of warmth in the finish.  O - This has awesome drinkability. I could drink this all night. It is just delicious and the feel is great. I really enjoyed this beer, and it is a wonderful representation of the style. I should not have put off trying this beer for so long. I highly recommend trying it out. I will be picking more bottles of this up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,AlHavanuther,4.75,"Poured from 12oz. bottle into a tulip glass. Or dirty old sock. Tastes and smells like pure bliss, either way! Just kidding, of course. I do have an actual review, please read on. But whether or not you like this beer, if you have any sense of humor at all, please visit the Unibroue website and view the videos of the ""legends"" of this and other Unibroue beers. The sommelier has been chosen directly from Quebecois Central Casting and is an absolute delight to watch and listen to.  My review:  A: slightly cloudy honey with an initial thick head (or ""collar"", per the sommelier) which dissipates into lace which lingers for a long time.  S: wheat, malt, a hint of the high ABV  T: pepper, wheat, honey. a hint of cloves, coriander.  M: delightfully effervescent for the duration; this is when you really get the hit of alcohol. Malty, full, comforting. As my friend and I are fond of saying, ""it tastes like liquid wheat"".  O: excellent. The only possible knock I can place on this is the high ABV. It is so highly drinkable that it's easy to overdo it. I guess that's why they sell the 12-oz bottles in 4-packs only :-)  I tried this beer once several years ago on a whim, just to try something different (I was amused at the name and graphic depiction of Quebec). At the time, I thought, ""this is the best beer I've ever tasted"". I have tasted many fine beers since that time, always thinking I'd find something better. I haven't yet, but I have held off a few points on the off chance that I will, someday. But if I don't, I'll still die happy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

At 9% abv the alcohol smell is hidden by the richness of the floral sweetness.  Taste: As the smell dictated the alcohol is hidden well and the floral sweetness is the best way to describe the taste. Very soft on the pallet and yet complex.  Mouthfeel: Extremely light, would like to see a little more texture and density, but maybe that is part of why it tastes so good and brings out the floral tastes so much.  Overall: Solid 4 out of 5.

Some citrusy spice, pepper, yeast, and a faint hint of alcohol.  M: pretty crisp, definitely good, can feel a bit of alcohol which would be expected at 9%.  O: a great belgian-style. I would recommend this beer, though personally would choose something different in the future for myself: I think Allagash Tripel and Curieux are both similar and better than La Fin Du Monde.

Relatively aggressive pour (deliberate) yields a massive white head that sticks around nicely. Hazy goldenrod body and nice lace.  Lovely fruity nose, lots of tart apple and yeast.  That fruit sticks around-- dang, it's been too long since I've ahd one of these. Apple, white-raisiny grape-- it's almost like juice but dries out at the finish.  Mouthfeel has a bit of fizz, but once you get into it, it's hefeweizen-level thick. The soul of a tripel and the body of a weizen? You can have both (think a Belgian Aventinus).  A magnificent tripel, and one of my personal benchmarks of the style. I think I've had this bottle a while (in the fridge albeit), and it still drinks great.

Judging by the strange name and label, I dismissed it in the past. It had a price of $7.50 for the 750ml bottle. I was in the mood for something different with a high ABV(had a bad day).

The color was a bright orange-yellow with a one finger head. It aroma was glorious, with citrus, clove, and the obvious high ABV. The first sip was a revelation.

The cap is craggy and loaded with small bubbles.  The cloudy body is the color of sunflowers. The beer leaves behind no lace.  Smell- This one is full of Belgian fruits. There is banana, red apple, and a little clove. It is very clean, but at the same time, generic Belgian notes.  Taste- The palate follows the nose pretty closely, and that is usually a good thing. So much clove, banana, and herbalness up front.  It also has some citrus quality to it mid-drink and in the finish, lemon being the most obvious. This is pretty good!  Mouth feel- A solid medium body with a little zip from the carbonation that is a nice touch. This is not the kind of beer that you want to be flat.

A: Pours a three finger head of no cream, bad thickness, and pretty good retention. Colour is a nontransparent light honey-gold.  Sm: Pleasant light malt, moderate crystal malt, honey, heavy lemon peel, and clean barley. A moderate strength aroma.  T: Heavy lemon peel throughout, with some light tame spices that I quite fancy.

The lemon is a bit overdone, in fairness. It is quite estery. Nicely balanced excepting the lemon. The yeast on the finish is lovely. Well built for the style, but it does resemble other styles (as afore noted).  Mf: Smooth and wet, but actually a touch too thick. Suits the flavours pretty well.  Dr: Very drinkable, especially for the high ABV - which doesn't come through. I'd like to try it aged, but I don't know that it'd be best on-draught. A nice little tripel that deserves revisiting.

22,34,PeerlessMark,4.43,"My first review! What amazes me most about this beer is that it is made in large quantities by a brewery owned by Sleemans, yet it is every bit a beautiful craft beer. And it can be bought at the Beer Store in a case of 24 for $46.95 making this just under 2 bucks a beer. It's not often you can enjoy a beer this good for that little.  Pours beatifully into a snifter leaving tiny lacey bubbles after the fine white head dies down. Thick slow legs. Swirling it around a bit excites the bubbles again and opens up the banana champagne aroma.  Tingles at the front of the tongue, opens up spicey and sweet then recedes at the back of the mouth into hints of banana and a kiss of alchohol that is very subtle at 9% ABV. I get a citrusy cream soda taste throughout that is just delicious. I'm very glad it is so easy to get a hold of these beers and I'm introducing all of my friends to it.  Merry Christmas all!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Luigi,4.97,"Cloudy orange color with a foamy think head. Awesome head retention And lacing. Sticks to the glass the whole time. Put it up to a light and you can see carbonation bubbles rushing to the top. From start to finish this Tripel looks great!!  Very crisp aroma. Hints of orange peel, coriander, cloves, bread, and some sweetness from the alcohol.  A fruity tartness hits the tongue at first. Tart like a fresh orange. After that hings of cloves, bread, yeast, and an almost sugar like sweetness. But, this ale has a great balance because the yeast and the grains just pull through.  Light body made refreshing and crisp from the carbonation. At 9% abv they do a very good job at hiding this because is a very very! drinkable Tripel. Probably one of the best damn Tripel ales I have tasted.  Hands down you must try this Ale and now it is easy to find (at least in my state). Can I have some more?",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Jparker37,4.1,"Poured into perfect pint glass. Best before date of 3/8/14  A - Deep straw golden color. Pours a big off-white head with medium sized bubbles that receed to a nice cap of foam.  S - Has a great lemon zest smell to it. Some quieter spicy phonolic notes. Mild candy sweetness. The alcohol becomes aparent after the beer warms.  T - A little bit of lemon citrus comes across right away but begins to be sugary sweet. Finishes a little alcoholic but is hidden well throughout. Also a pretty dry finish.  M - Hits the heavy side of medium for body and has a nice prickly medium to high carbonation.  O - I enjoyed this beer alot. I tend to shy away from tripels, am usually not a fan but I have enjoyed this over other tripels I have had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JerseyKirk,4.14,A: unfiltered creamy butter with hint of orange. 1 finger white head dissipated quickly.  S: Belgian yeast. No fruity esters. Slight banana.  T: Tastes like a really nice Belgian ale? Good. Alcohol is extremely hidden. Balanced.  M: Spot on and crisp finish. Cleanses palate but not spicy.  O: Great balanced hi octane Belgian style strong ale. Really well hidden booze makes this an easy drinker but will cloud judgements 3 times as fast.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JTSbeerislife,4.35,"22 oz bottle, cork and cage, date code on bottle but undecipherable, purchased 7/2011 from a reputable bottle shop and well stored in temperature controlled conditions since.  Poured into a Duvel Tulip Signature Glass.  Pours a nice frothy one finger head, which slowly reduces to a thin cap which lasts. Beautiful straw color, with very lively carbonation, small bubbles stream from the bottom of the glass.  The aroma first hits you with very refined and classy yeast, followed by some very light citrus and even fainter malt. After warming some orange peel and coriander come forward. While very enjoyable the smell could use a little more intensity.  Crisp delicious entry on the palate of yeast and toasty malt. Very refined, elegant flavors that remind one of champagne. Orange peel and banana flavors and a slight hoppyness develop as this ale warms. Medium full mouth feel with a wonderfully refreshing carbonation.  Good finish of citrus, yeast, and light hop/malt.  This is undeniably delicious ale, but after having their Trois Pistoles which blew me away, this leaves me a little underwhelmed. That being said this is an excellent Triple, with very refined aromas and flavors. Excellent balance and skillfully brewed. The 9% ABV is never even remotely noticeable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S: Bold aroma profile--yeasty and fruity, with scents of orange peel and some spiceyness as well. there is a nice mellow sweet fruity toffee aroma as well that is very good.  T: Banana, pears, clove, lemon grass. Wheaty malt holds strong before drying out on the finish. Mild hops provide a spicy grass character  M: Smooth and easy to drink with only moderate carbonation  O: My favorite tripel by far, don't know why it took my so long to try this brew but I'm glad I did. It's awesome that it's so easy to get too!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jtierney89,4.3,"pours a very very pale golden color with lots of visible carbonation and some cloudiness. Big bright white head is active at the top of the glass.  Nose consists of lots of spicy clove and bubble gum as well as some sweet cereal malts. Smell is heavenly actually.  Extremely clean and full bodied. Flavors are very well blended so hard to pin point. There's definitely a big spicy clove presence on the front end of the tongue. Tingly after taste, effervescent. The flavors keep escaping me but probably because of how clean of a brew this is. Your tongue feels like it's gone through work out after a sip that's for sure and not in a bad way.  I dont know what it is about this beer. It's just a really solid drinker.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Cru,2.83,"Cloudy yellow pour with a fair amount of sediment in the bottle.  Moderately strong fruit aroma. Heavy lacing, well carbonated. A banana, clove, fig kind of nose. Definitely dominated by the banana flavor. Best by date was 02/12 but something seemed a little off with this beer. It did not taste skunked, but the flavor combination reminds me of a beer that's been sitting in the sun for a while. Not my favorite Unibroue.  That strong malt profile combined with an overpowering banana ester flavor left me looking for something a little dryer. Like maybe a glass of water...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ThisWangsChung,4.47,"Seeing this bad boy in Guenther's was a pleasant surprise, and it was on sale, so you know I'm gonna pounce all over this. Poured into a snifter.  A: Pours a yeasty, cloudy golden amber color. This one doesn't have much of a head...what's there is a .5-finger eggshell-white affair, with poor retention and good lacing (both of which improve if you let the beer warm a little). In addition, it also features faint trails of carbonation bubbles, and if you let it sit in the glass a while, some yeast sediment.  S: Banana, cloves, and bubblegum. The ale esters really take this one over. No alcohol on the nose.  T: The bubblegum flavors are the first thing that stick out to me, with the banana, cloves, and yeast blending very nicely with the wheat base. The balance between the sweetness and tartness is excellent, but the best (worst?) part is how stupidly easy it is to drink. Apart from a slight warming on the back end, I refuse to believe this is 9% ABV. Fer chrissakes, it goes down easier than some 6% beers!  M: The carbonation is high, but it's only 'high enough' to make it superbly refreshing. The sensation plays incredibly well with the buttery smoothness on the tongue. Terrifyingly easy to down.  O: Wow is all I can say. This is a beer that where you WILL need self-control so as to not down the whole bottle in 10 minutes, lest you face its alcoholic wrath. It's an amazingly refreshing and flavorful drink that will lull drinkers into a false sense of security (seriously, this is 9% ABV?) Needless to say, it lives up to the hype.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,chinchill,4.15,"12 oz bottle dated ""best before"" 7 Sept., 2012 (revised with BB 5-2016 bottle in July 2015 and in January 2023 with a bottle BB date stamped September 2024).  Pours with a white head. Plenty of sediment in the bottle, much of which remains despite a light swirl mid-pour, but some of which comes out at the end of the pour tainting (aesthetically) the center of the white head. Head has excellent duration but leaves little lacing. Liquid is a cloudy yellow-gold.  Mainly fruity yeast and (apparent) spices in the aroma, with a touch of hops and hints of apples, bananas and pears. The taste is also quite yeasty-fruity, with hints of apples and apricots, and even some dark fruits. The high ABV is well hidden in both the aroma (until it warms up) and the taste. Seems like there is more flavor in the finish than earlier on. Lightly tart.  Mouthfeel: refined, champagne-like feel, although with more body.  Overall: not my favorite style, but quite enjoyable nonetheless. I can easily see others giving this a very high rating. Flavorful and refreshing, but better as a slow sipper than as a session brew. Complex aroma and flavor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mactrail,4.27,"Aroma is very nice. Fresh banana bread with lots of spice. Sweet, richly flavored, very tangy. This does seem like too much of a good thing, and so many crippled tripels could use a dose of that flavor. Lots of fruit flavors, seems to have pear and champagne to me. Possibly a touch of hops, but the bitterness seems to come from the yeasty mix. Every sip renews the strange complexity of this stuff. Bitter aftertaste that renews the desire for another sweet sip. Hot and sultry stuff.  I've had this 12 oz bottle for a year, and a screw cap, no less. It still says ""best before 05-27-13."" Years to go, according to these optimistic Canadians.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,brugge2004,4.42,"If you consider price and availability there isn't a better tripel. The spice note in the aroma and follows into the taste is something special, almost peppery in the aftertaste,i don't get alot of fruit in this one although there is definitely a sweetness back there somewhere, hard to go wrong with Unibroue and this is their best.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Kinsman,4.09,"Time to revisit La Fin for a proper review.  Pours a bright but hazy golden yellow with a nice bubbly appearance. Dense white head caps it off nicely but fades a bit too quickly and leaves no lace behind.  Lots of fruitiness in the aroma with a juicy character and some candy-like sweetness. A bit of clove spice in the background.  A nice bright fruity character up front with some apple and pear notes and just a but of juicy citrus as well. A bit of a bubblegum flavor as well. Spicy yeast notes offset the sweetness with some peppery and clove-like notes.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and bubbly with a bit of dry finish. Overall, La Fin Du Monde is hard to beat for the style and a great value at $8 a bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,paperbackfoster,4.72,"Poured from 12oz bottle into tulip glass.  A - Opaque, light honeyed bronze. Pours a frothy two-finger head that, even while pouring, fizzes quickly out of existence. Bright and active. The carbonation held to the narrow curve of the tulip, shooting up to the disappearing head.  S - Rich florals and spice. Heavy on the coriander and citrus, as well as tropical fruit and a bready backbone.  T - Wild, sour yeast hits with a juicy, candied sweetness. Pervasive spice. Big fruit flavors break down into subtle hints of orange, mango, and a bit of pineapple. Bitter, grassy hops round out the profile. Bold and complex, but fresh and lively.  M - Both zesty and creamy, this one's spot on.  Overall - Obviously an astounding beer, and one that could easily please even the most discerning. Big tripel flavors meet up with qualities of a real hefeweizen, and even a bit of the freshness and unique spicing of a saison, to bring a sweet, sour treat. Enjoy it slow. Then enjoy a few more.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Nice 2-inch white creamy head fades down to form a thick lacing, which remains throughout the entire session. SRM: 5-6  Smell: Banana, melon, pineapple, pepper and clove. Juicy fruit bubblegum all the way through. Super spicy yeasty esters presentation.  Taste: Lemon zest, a bit of cream and mildness from the thick powdery yeast. Straw like chewiness and weak cotton candy-like strawberry; sweet, lingering flavour with slight wheat tartness.  Mouthfeel: Medium to high carbonation. Exceptionally warm and dry finish, considering suggested sweetness from fruity aroma and flavour. Well-balanced alcohol.  Overall: At 14 ºC, this is the greatest tripel from Quebec that goes beyond the style and expectations. Could be considered too delicious to become a classic, but it certainly exudes hard to achieve complexities.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,thisismyname,5,"Poured into my Unibroue glass.  This brew pours an inviting hazy dark golden hue with visible flakes of yeast floating around. Produces a large creamy white head which sticks around til the end. The lacing left some peculiar designs in my glass. Beautiful!  Smells of mixed yeasts and some sweet malts in the background. The smell makes you rather thirsty...  WOW this tastes fantastic. A symphony of cloves, bananas, earthy grain, a hint of spice, and sweet creamy malts and the slightest hoppiness on the aftertaste. Reminds me a lot of a hefeweizen. For a 9% beer, the alcohol is hidden impressively. Extremely refreshing.  Carbonation is perfect. The alcohol is completely hidden yet it still warms your mouth. It's soft, thick, creamy, everything a beer should be.  Brilliant. I am definitely coming back for more of this.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

T- it has a great wheaty/yeasty quality here with a great banana/clove character that doesn't hit you over the head. Some triples just have too much of that bubblegum intense flavor, but this is a cleaner, more subdued version, which I seem to like more. Lots of juicy orange brings both sweet and tart dimensions.  O- this beer is quite good, I mean really really good considering it is in pretty much every beer store around and it is definetly the best triple I've had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,salivar08,4.08,"A while ago, I received a recommendation to try a few beers before I die. One of them, La Fin du Monde, was readily available at my local grocery store. I decided, ""Well, what the hell, life is short, let's just get this and see how it goes"" when I went shopping for laundry detergent. A funny thing happened when a Haggen employee came over to the beer section to attempt to re-stock a beer. For some reason, she asked ME if I knew where a beer was so she could restock it. Did I know where it was? Of course I know where it was. (Might want to tell you guys that as of today I weigh 225.6 pounds, down from 261.4 at the beginning of the year. Not that you didn't believe me) Uhm, here's my review of the beer.  Initial assessment: ""This will be the best beer you've had in your life.""  Initial red flag: The diagram on the bottle has a picture. One is of a stout glass. The other a pilsner glass with a red ""X"" over it. Uhm, that's the only beer vessel I have to drink out of, bottle.  It's a corked top, which I have issues with. Last time I uncorked an alcoholic beverage (champagne) the cork blew out of the champagne bottle, hit the ceiling, probably hit my roommate and bounced wildly. That's the last time I tried a mimosa.  Vessel chosen for consumption: Pint glass  Aroma: N/A. I have a bad cold and don't want to hold my nose over the glass for too long or something bad will happen to my $9.50 beer.  Appearance: Deep gold color (like an unpolished, old gold medal) with a cloudy consistency.  Taste: Mmm, tasty tasty. Usually, when you have a beer, you know the aftertaste will be heavily alcoholic and sometimes ruin your beer. Here, there's light notes of that at the very end of the sip, but heavier notes of fruit (can't identify which ones) and a very smooth taste.  Rings around the glass: Whoever thinks this needs to happen in every beer they drink is an idiot and should be shot. Counting rings in your glass? Wow, you must be really fun to hang out with at bars. ""Look, there's, like, fifty individual rings around my glass!"" Rings should only be seen on fingers. Even then it's debatable.  A picture of ""her"" showed up as I was drinking this and I almost cried. WAIT, that's an emotion, not a category.  ASTMO -- random letters you shouldn't guess on Wheel of Fortune.  I'm pretty satisfied with my choice of beer tonight. Didn't try to mask it with any food because then you have popcorn beer and what fun is that, really? I don't know about the long-term options for this beer... I'm more of a steak and potatoes kind of dude when it comes to beer. I like it, just put it in front of me and let's see what happens. Don't care too much for fanciness of it when, in my current state, drunkenness will do just fine. But this really is a good beer, you should try it and try to get a hold of it.  But for me, Captain Cheap, I'll stick with my guns and receive quantity over quality.  GRADE: B, but secretly leaning A-  --Keith",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ummswimmin,4.57,"Unibroue was one of the earliest craft breweries that I was introduced to since arriving in New Jersey, and I was very happy to have been introduced to their brand.  There is a very healthy head when it is poured. And it smells very good with bubblegum and banana.  It smells very good as well. I really enjoyed savoring this bottle.  This is an excellent example of a tripel. I recommend it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,olfolxholme,4.38,"5  A - 12 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. A pretty cool graphic on the front label, classy foil covers the cap. I like how on the back it has several graphics indicating that they use natural ingredients, bottle conditioning, and also which glassware to use. All those things promote beer literacy - something that i always support!  The beer pours like velvet. It's cloudy light amber color and forms a nice thin layer of head that is persistent. Only some lacing, but it bubbles a little after every sip. There's an ""it factor"" to the look of this beer. It's a nice light amber color, but no light gets through. You can't see bubbles moving through the glass, but you can tell they are making their way up to the top. I could go on - it's an attractive beer.  S - You can smell the beer before you even put your nose up to it. The initial aroma lasts for quite some time - an enticing mix of fruity yeast, dried fruits, alcohol, some buttery diacetyl notes, and maybe a touch of funk. Intoxicating!  T - Tastes even better than it smells. All of the above but more intense. Just delicious.  M - Very smooth when swirled over the tongue. A little hot, but I don't mind it one bit. You just want to keep drinking it to get the smoothness back!  O - An easy go-to beer that I've had many times. I don't buy this as often as I should, because I'm always trying new beers. After I discovered Chimay, this was kind of the ""next beer"" to continue expanding my horizons. Maybe not for ""everyone,"" but it should be! Highly recommended.

The smell of the beer is a little citrusy and has some sweet grainy aromas too in there. The beer smells refreshing, very lively. The taste of the beer was a little spicy, a little fruity and had a nice amount of bready yeast in there too. The mouthfeel was smooth and rather easy to drink, even for a strong brew like this one.

22,34,tonyf55,4.6,"From a 750ml bottle into a Tulip glass.  Visual (4) - Very foggy, golden in color, thin quickly dispersed head (for a Tripel). Gives the appearance of an unfiltered wheat beer, except without the active head.  Aroma (4) - Spicy, malty, alcoholic undertones. Fine sweetness hidden under the initial sniff  Mouthfeel (5) - Spiciness continues, more-so than the initial smell. Beautifully complex. Yeast creates an active coarse feel.  Taste (5) - Instantly complex, spicy and interesting. The alcohol is initially masked by a spicy, herby flavor but still kicks at the end. True to the Belgian Tripel style, the flavor lingers at the end  Overall (4.5) - I was hoping for more head (especially from a Tripel in a Tulip glass) and the aromas seemed to dissipate too quickly, especially compared to the fantastic, lingering and complex mouthfeel and taste of the beer itself. This is a fantastic tripel and one of my second or third favorites in the style. Very much worth picking up a bottle (or two) to savor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,tjkinate,4.32,"Have seen this beer on many a shelves, but never gave much thought about grabbing one. Finally I did and man was I missing out.  A: Pours a honey yellow with a slightly deeper core, topped off with a 1+ finger head that displayed little retention. Nice bubbles continue to rise throughout, but little to no lacing was exhibited.  S: Overall sweet, scents of banana, lemon, with nice floral notes. As the scents fade the smell of coriander and some spice dominate, slightly tingling the nose.  T: Wow, best Tripel I've had to date. Tastes were bold but never overwhelming. Typical ingredients like banana, citrus fruits, herbs and spices were present, but I have never drank a beer of this variety that was so balanced. Crazy how much that makes a difference.  M: Medium/light, coats the mouth in a light silky film, tingles the throat when swallowed.  O: A great beer that I will definitely be drinking again in the future.

Citrus, peppery, fruits - esp banana. The 9% blends in well and gives a slight bite that matches up with the spiciness.  M - Plenty of carbonation. Quaff bubbles off middle of tongue vigorously, finishing quickly and leaving a smooth, buttery texture in the mouth.  O - A good brew.

The mouthfeel has an up-front, heavy carbonation that quickly fades to creamy, then fades again to a refreshing cling on the tongue.

T: Sweet on the front of the tongue, initially citrus-y; the 9% ABV makes itself apparent with a (inoffensive) metallic twang. Matures into notes of cherry and phenolic cloves and pepper. Leaves a warm feeling and a bitter, dry aftertaste.  M: Smooth and soft on the front, with a satisfactory weight. Carbonation tingles the back of the throat.  O: Wonderful.

One finger head that disappointingly dissipated into absolutely nothing. No lacing present at all.  S: a phenomenal explosion of well-balanced aromas are present in this beer. Some of the predominant characteristics on the nose are wheat, citric fruits, but also at the same time very sweet scents. Some spices and slight cinnamon present as well creating a complex yet amazing aroma. It almost makes you regret drinking the beer when it smells this good.  T: tastes very much like a heavy wheat and malty beer. Some sweet estery tones are present at the beginning followed by citrus tones and pepper. Alcohol is present in the taste as well which I expected considering the relative high ABV.  M: medium to heavy body, very high carbonation and dry finish. Alcohol is felt thoroughly.  O: what can I say, this is an excellent beer that is best enjoyed by drinking very slowly as it is on the strong side (sipping beer I guess).

The head lasted several minutes and left a bit of lacing on the glass. Lots of little carbonation bubbles.  S: The first smell is as impressive as it is complex. I get fruit and citrus smells: it reminds me of grapefruit, lychee and rambutan (SE Asian fruits). There is a yeast scent as well. And a bit of sugariness.  T: This beer has an almost fizzy yet complex taste going on. There are the citrus/fruit flavors and some other flavors that I think are from the yeast. The alcohol is also present on the aftertaste. The malt is there in a sweet way. It finishes dry with an aftertaste of yeast on the roof of my mouth.  M: I find this beer to have a slightly fizzy mouthfeel but a complex taste. I suppose it’s light to medium. I actually really like the bit of fizziness. It suits the complexity well.  O: An awesome beer. I like the complexity of the flavors and the awesome nose.

Taste is a complex and focused blend of nutmeg, creme, cinnamon, and ""Unibroue game-yeast"" (eludes other description- an odd feeling of game or raw meat that is present in all of their beers.) Perfectly balanced dryness/sweetness. Incredible profiling of flavor, incredible sense of what it wants to be. I have no complaints.  Mouthfeel is soft, pillowy and creamy. Perfect.

Taste opens with fruit esters, particularly tart apples and pears with a bit of sugar syrup. Yeast and black pepper follow this, with a light hint of ethanol near the finish. Aftertaste is mostly sweet, a little herbal or spicy. Good balance between sweetness and tartness/bitterness.  Mouthfeel is fairly heavy, perhaps medium-heavy.

Taste: Tastes like a somewhat malty wheat beer, with a pronounced fruity sweetness to start (especially banana) that ends in a stronger malty finish (but not overwhelming). Tastes good to me, for a medium light beer.  Mouthfeel:This is a little bit on the light side, but for a Belgian style tripel, it has a good mouthfeel. A fair amount of carbonation, and a medium light thickness.  Overall: This is a good beer.

Sweet malts.  T - Similar to the aroma. Initial flavor is of citrus, lemon, and sweet malts. The finish has a strong yeast, bready type flavor. A hint of sourness. Alcohol is masked but evident.  M - Medium bodied, creamy, very lively.  D - A well rounded brew. Good example of the style, the taste is excellent. This is a perfect sipping beer. Although the drinkability is nice, the alcohol is present and will sneak up on you fast. Just another impressive offering from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,MattyG85,4.77,"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Bottle says best by 03-30-13.  Appearance: Cloudy golden yellow with lots of bubbles sticking to the glass and a light amount of floating particles. Decent one finger white head that fades into a patchy layer. Light amount of lacing.  Smell: Strong aroma of Belgian yeast and wheat with plenty of fruit including banana, apple, orange, and lemon peel. Strong presence of cloves and some coriander and pepper spices. Also has some sweet bready malts and a hint of honey. Complex and enticing.  Taste: A strong burst of yeast and wheat up front is followed by the mentioned fruits and spices. Banana, clove, apple, lemon, orange, coriander and other spices. Solid presence of bready malts throughout. Finishes with a little heat from the alcohol and some more fruity sweetness. Very tasty.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Has a light alcohol burn but everything still feels pretty light for such a high abv.  Overall: A great tasting and complex brew that has a great balance of sweet fruits and spices.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,LaneMeyer,4.2,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip  A- Golden amber in color, one finger white head  S- Citrus, lemon, barnyard funk  T- Big citrus notes, sour apple, yeasty, bready notes, lemon zest  M- Nice carbonation, very light,  O- Nice example of a Belgian Tripel, very refreshing on a hot day",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,kkoz,4.02,"Appearance & Aroma: It was a slightly hazy golden-orange color and appeared to have a good amount of carbonation in it. There was a decent head when I poured it, but it fell pretty quickly to a thin layer of bubbles across the top. There was a fruity aroma along with some yeasty, bready, and honey like aromas.  Taste & Feel: The body was medium and the mouthfeel was smooth, but slightly crisp. There was a sweet fruitiness in the middle, reminding me of peaches and apricots with a hint of yeastiness. The fruitiness continued into the finish, accompanied by a belgian-like spiciness and an alcoholic warmth. The aftertaste was a bit dry, sweet, and fruity.  Food Pairing: I think this would go nicely with a turkey dinner because the turkey would help to bring out the yeasty and bready flavors and temper the fruity flavors and belgian spiciness.  Overall Impression: This had a complex fruitiness to it, and seemed to fit the tripel style nicely. It was pretty drinkable despite the high ABV, which was only noticeable in the warmth of the finish. Overall, I thought this was a good, complex, Belgian style beer. However, while I appreciate Belgians, they’re not my favorite style, but if you’re a fan of the style, you’ll really like this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,fsvan,4.8,"Bottle poured into New Belgium globe. Best by of 1-12-2014.  A- Murky yellow. Billowing textured white head. This is bottle conditioned, and it's pretty obvious from the carbonation.  S- Where to start? Light fruit, like under ripe apples or pears. A bit of Belgian yeast. A little bit of sweetness, bready like malts. There is so much going on here, it's hard to describe, and it all just explodes from the glass. Just an exquisite smelling concoction.  T- Again, some under ripe green apple, that brings a tart, but not sour flavor. Clearly present, chalky, Belgian yeast. A subtle bitterness on the end. Fantastic.  M- Heavy of medium. Lovely carbonation from the bottle conditioning.  O- I've had this beer many, many times, and it never disappoints. It is widely available, not overly expensive, perfect by itself or with food, and for my money is better than the Belgian forerunners of the style (Tripel Karmeliet, St. Bernadus Tripel, Chimay), and it isn't often (in fact it is damn rare) for a North American brewery to pull of an Abbey style like this. I like tripels quite a bit, and this is easily my favorite. The praise this beer gets is well earned. Due to all of that, and trying to judge for style, I don't know how to not give it a 5 overall.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Erish,4.72,"I poured this 12 oz. bottle into a Chimay chalice. Best by February 2, 2013.  A: cloudy honey gold color, the white head quickly falls into a fine Belgian-style cap with good lacing.  S: banana, plenty of Belgian fruity esters, apricot, clove, spice, the malt aroma alternates between bread and cracker-like, the hop note is floral (honeysuckle?).  T: there is an explosion of ripe and overripe fruit up front, including banana, apple, apricot, and grape, the middle is rich, spicy, and has a vanilla/oak core, the finish is long, luxurious, and spicy/earthy. This is exactly how a Belgian Tripel should taste.  M: medium-bodied, ultra-silky texture (imagine the bed linens at a 5-star hotel), and moderate to plentiful carbonation with a pleasant dry finish.  O: a fabulous rendition of the Belgian Tripel, and one that I will definitely seek out again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Morlup,4.58,"I've had this one on multiple occasions, and is a great candidate for my first review.  A - Poured into a Lindemans flute. Wrong glass, I know, but it's okay. Cloudy deep-yellow with lots of carbonation. A two-finger creamy white head left relatively small amounts of lacing in the glass  S - Hard to get a good sniff in such a narrow glass, but straw, bread and alcohol notes are apparent.  T - A delicious bread and booze right off the bat that melts into a nearly creamy malt flavor. So yummy, so easy to drink.  M - somewhat thin with lots of bubbles and a nice and not overpowering alcohol zing.  O - A great beer in all catergories. If this had a lower abv, I would drink it constantly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,OCBeerBaron,4.47,"I didn't know what to expect from this brewery for this Belgian but I must say I was impressed.  A- Nice golden color that almost glows while sayin'don't be shy, drink me.' The head falls quickly but shows it's mark.  S- Awesome clove smell that previews the spicy goodness that's about to hit your pallet. It has that faint 'banana' smell which I notice in Belgian styles like this.  T- Wow... I'm in love. This beer starts with a wonderful rush of goodnessnin the mouth followed by enough bite to satisfy anyone looking for a nice buzz worthy drinking session.  O- This has become a favorite of mine now that I know my local store sells it for $2 less than Delirium Tremens. I'll be reaching for this one on a weekly basis!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Scotchboy,4.13,"Corked & caged 750 split into 2 New Belgium snifters with a mate. Opened with a reassuring *pop* of carbonation.  A: Pours a cloudy, brilliant straw yellow with an amazing creamy off-white head.  S: Clove spice, Belgian yeast characters, slight phenolic alcohol notes, and soft fruit flesh.  T: Starts peppery with the clove, morph's into a bready Belgian funk bomb with some grassy notes and green fruit sweetness. Well rounded and smooth, the alcohol is nearly invisible.  MF: Creamy, soft carbed mouthfeel that let's you know it's bottle conditioned. A touch of dryness in the back of your throat.  O: An enjoyable lighter beer with plenty of Belgian character and phenolic notes with some softer hints at sweet fruit.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BeerAmbassador,4.62,Pours a hazy bright yellow with a nice creamy white head. The head is almost mousse-like which makes me happy. Stone fruit aromas with lots of other ester and banana aromas and some spicy phenolic notes. There is a lot going on here. A little spicy on the palate with a bit of warming alcohol behind that. A nice medium body with a really creamy mouthfeel from the very tightly bound carbonation. Long finish with that characteristic stale (read; subtle) hop finish that I look for in a Belgian beer. This is a delicious beer that I haven't had in a few years and almost forgot how much I like it. Especially when you consider that the Unibroue beers are generally pretty well priced when compared with a lot of American Belgian-style beers this might make it's way into my regular rotation.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JoeBCBC,3.49,"12.oz bottle from a 4 bottle ""taster pack"" poured into a 16oz. glass.  A- Pours a nice cloudy gold with a fluffy 2 finger head that sticks around. Appearance is typical for the style.  S- The smell is faint and hard to pick up on. Might have served this one too cold. From what I can get, it's bananas, cloves, and grassy hay.  T- The taste is very good actually. Complex and just the right amount of fruit and spice. Bananas and black pepper, with some cloviness and hints of muscat grapes. Fairly complex.  M- Good carbonation and medium body. Matches the style and the abv and makes this easy to sip.  O- This is my first Unibroue beer and one of the better tripels I have gotten to try. They aren't really my style and I like this anyway. I'm definitely looking forward to trying the others from the taster pack.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Thickfreakness,4.54,"A- Cloudy golden amber sunshine. Two finger fluffy, bright white head that lingers for a little while, then fades away almost completely. Decent carbonation with tiny drips of lacing hanging on.  S- Insane depth and complexity. Huge notes of wheat, banana, fresh cut apples, clove, yeast, black peppercorns, and a touch of lemon peel. No one particular smell dominates... it's just a wonderful blend of each. I wish I could get a candle with this aroma!!!  T- Wow! Spicy! Nice black pepper, clove and banana hit you right up front. Crisp, fresh apple with a squeeze of lemon juice. Lively and yeasty. Nice touch of alcohol burn and carbonation on the tongue.  M- Crisp, refreshing, fruity and delicious! No one taste overwhelms the tongue. Perfect carbonation, nice fresh fruit and citrus on the tastebuds. I love the way belgian yeast lingers and lets the banana, clove and pepper rest on the tongue.  O- Who doesn't love this one? It's a near perfect example from one of North Americas best brewers. I love how they stay true to the roots of this fantastic Tripel, while adding a riff or two of their own.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,axeman9182,4.59,"12oz bottle, allowed to warm before being poured into my Duvel tulip.  La Fin Du Monde pours a darkened goldenrod, almost 100% opaque. The pure white head only rises up to about a finger and a half in height, before very slowly collapsing down on itself. Lacing is a bit of a disappointment though. The nose is absolutely textbook tripel. It's redolent of apples and pears and white pepper and clove, all in relatively equal mesasure. The flavor is, quite simply, perfection as far as a tripel goes. There's a pale fruit sweetness (but not too sweet) to kick things off, and it's where the apples and pears from the aroma come in. The pepper and clove yeast phenols come in for the second half of each sip, and it's all held together by a subtle, warming, and pleasant touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is just a touch off to me. I don't know if the body's coming across as too heavy, or the carbonation as too low, but the result is a mouthfeel that's not quite as light and bubbly as the best brewed Belgians. La Fin Du Monde is possibly the best tasting tripel I've ever had, but some of the odds and ends (looks and mouthfeel) just don't quite live up to the same level.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,weller1js,4.2,"appearance: pours a very cloudy yellow-amber, light carbonation, slight creamy foam leaving a slight similar ring of lacing; when held to light, near the edges of the glass it almost appears to be a translucent white.  smell: velvety spiced scent that one would expect in a tripel, light and wheaty as well as fruity and yeasty.  taste: begins predominantly wheaty-malty and yeasty, which is clearly segregated in the palate from the essences of fruit and spice that present themselves as quickly as they blend with the hop characteristics, yielding a sweet, complex tangy-ness that carries on well beyond the finish.  mouthfeel: velvety and medium-bodied, serves to enhance the complexity of the taste.  overall: prime example of the tripel style, highly acclaimed for good reason, very complex yet grounded, very drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

T ~ House yeast follows through...Pineapple rings, maraschino cherries, nectarine & pomander make up the fruit-filled body. Touch of jam mango & cinnamon-like spice-note that (for a second) reminds me of a candied apple. Grass & hay on the back of the throat.  M ~ Soft yet lively carbonation that creates balance amongst the complex fruit notes. Full in flavor with a crisp finish.  D ~ A classic in my/anyone's book. (One of) My go-to Tripels.

22,34,TheSupremeAJ,4.49,"Cloudy golden color with thick bubbly head. Doesn't retain well. The aroma of the spicy Belgian yeast and sweet malt hit me as soon as I cracked the bottle and is magnificent! Taste is very balanced and compares favorably to some Belgians I've had... Mild fruit esters compliment the sweet, creamy malt. Slightly dry finish. Mild pepper notes. Mouthfeel is luxuorious and carbonation is medium to high, standard for the tripel style.

22,34,mdaschaf,4.42,"Review from notes. 12oz bottle. Have had this beer a few times, but never took the time to write a review for it.  A: Pours a cloudy yellow with a very large, foamy head on top, just off-white in color. Really nice head retention, remains rather thick for a while. Leaves behind some sticky lacing.  S: Great aroma of banana, apples, Belgian yeast, cloves, and a bit of pepper as well. It is a bit sugary, but extremely pleasant.  T: The banana comes through very strong, as do the spices. There is a good bit of both clove and nutmeg, and to a lesser extent some pepper and the typical Belgian yeast characteristic. There is a little bit of bruised apple and white grape. It has a nice sweet flavor as well. Very balanced with a bit of graham cracker like malt.  M: Medium bodied, but drinks so easy and smooth. Nice carbonation with very little heat at all.  O: A fantastic beer, and a classic in the style for sure. Dangerously drinkable for being 9%, but probably not a beer I want to have multiple of in a night. A nice sipping beer or one to pair with a meal.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,RedHunter,4.6,"Here it is! Review Number Three of O!Red's Brew Tube!  Here's a Belgian Tripel in celebration of being accepted as a volunteer at this year's up and coming Night of the Funk and Belgian Beer Fest! I'll be giving you all the what's up September 9th and 10th with some insider info & short reviews from the fest!  This Tripel comes from Unibroue in Chambly, Canada! La Fin du Monde! Or for you lazy bums who can't type in French Dictionary into Google, The End of the World. 9% ABV YUM!  A Tripel is a 3x extra malted beer and La Fin du Monde is also Triple Fermented! These ""BIG"" beers have some high ABV's but hide it amongst the big malty sweetness and balanced hop flavor. Expect these to contain flavors of complexity. Good thing it comes in a 750ml (or 1 pint 9.4 fl oz for you lazy ones)!  Poured from/ 750 ML bottle with cork /into/ Red Wine Glass (for lack of Goblet or Chalice).  The eyes get a nice big head making it's way down from 3 fingers to present lace all around the glass. The fizzing is loud and the effervescence continuous. The lacing sticks nicely round the curves. The bubbles rest on a hazy golden brew.  This beer smells just like it should. Banana, sweet fruit maltiness. Hops not highly apparent. Mostly sugary goodness with a hint of alcohol.  The first taste reveals its true nature. Very bready. If I didn't see that it was beer I figured I could roll some pastries with it. Banana remains prominent in the flavor. You definitely know this is a Belgian style. Already I feel the warmth of the alcohol hitting my gut. One thing they do right, hide that burn as if this was malty cream soda. An earthy quality is present and lingers after I put down the glass to type.  My mouth feels awesome. Not super dry, not needing to have another satisfying sip, but there's no reason why I wouldn't. Bubbly up front, hops coming through in the back with that earthy taste. This may come from the yeast. So pleasant to drink.  The Belgians I've had in the past have definitely been great beers. Very different than what I originally considered beer, but nevertheless it's so damn good. I think because of geographical proximity, MA is very much in love with Belgians and I can totally see why. La Fin du Monde doesn't shake things up so much as it gives you a perfect example of the style. This may not be Dogfish Head, but remember people, Dogfish head would not be successful at creating such UNIQUE Beers if not for the jumping off point provided by good craft beer that people already love!  If you are from Belgium and speak Dutch, op uw gezondheid! If you speak Francois, a votre sante! And for you lazy buggers, gosh darn you get on my nerves sometimes... it's Cheers! Or as O!Red likes to say, Raise your glass! I'd Tap That!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,chilidog,3.51,"Bought this to prepare to give as a gift. Also had the chance to try on draft. About the same,  Pours a golden haze, fair carbonation with a strong white head. Lace is fair and sticks.  Aroma of malty spice of clove.  Taste is strong, assertive of hop, spice, clove, pepper with malts, earth and alcohol.  The mouth is left dry yet coated with a spice malt coat.  Drinkable yes but alot going on here with the spice, malts and alcohol.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,gatorbreath,4,"Pour is golden with a white, formidable head. Smell is of spice and a crisp brew. Taste is crisp, finishes clean, and resounds of malt and spice.

22,34,SarahRenee,4.45,"This is one of my favorite beers to beer. It's spiciness is perfect for a cold winter night, but it is still crisp so it is refreshing enough for a scorching summer night.

22,34,jrenihan,4.49,"Pours a golden straw colour, with a ton of thick white head that begins to dissipate quite rapidly.  The smell is noticeable even while pouring, and it is fantastic. Banana, clove, sugar, pepper, orange... a really intoxicating combination. Stellar.  Taste is similar to the nose but not quite as explosive or dynamic. The banana, clove and pepper are present, and the yeast imparts its flavours nicely. A bit of a malty background to the beer, very slightly bready. Finish is a little dry. with a light bitterness. All mixed up together very nicely. Great.  Body is also great. Medium to full bodied, a nice chewy feel, and considerably less carbonation than I expected from the way the head built up. Feels great.  Overall, a tremendously good beer. I remember while I was a university student in Montreal people used to talk about how terrible this beer was (not 'la terrible'!). Neither I nor any of my friends knew anything about beer at the time. Can't believe what I was missing out on those years!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,justintcoons,4.47,"A: Pours a hazy, orange-tinted gold with 1 finger of head that dissipates slowly. Decent lacing and moderate carbonation.  N: Barnyard, wheat, citrus, banana and clove.  T: Heavy wheat flavors and barnyard (that delicious Unibroue yeast) upfront. This is accompanied by lemongrass, clove, banana and perhaps some pear. The clove carries over to the finish along with coriander and floral hops.  M: Medium bodied, creamy, tingly and dry.  O: This has always been one of my favorite Tripels. The flavors are robust and complex with no hint of the 9% abv. FLAVOR is the key to this one. It's PACKED with FLAVOR! This is not a gateway beer and is meant for the more seasoned beer drinker.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,zac16125,4.69,"750 mL bottle poured into a snifter Best before: 04-08-13  A: Pours a bright golden yellow with 1 fingers width of bright white head, that dissipates rather quickly and leaves no appreciable lacing. Lots of carbonation bubbles can be seen rushing to the top of the glass. It looks refreshing and inviting.  S: Aromas of banana, citrus in the way of orange, tangerine and even a hint of lemon zest. Lots of clove and peppery spice as well. The scent is so strong that I can literally pick up these aromas while the beer is sitting across the table. Fantastic.  T: The first sip goes right along with the nose as you’re hit right off the bat with all kinds of flavors; spicy, sweet, and citrus. The taste is complex, but does a nice job of balancing everything out. In general there is a big clove and pepper spiciness upfront, with a malt sweetness on the back end and a banana flavor lingering in the aftertaste. There are also hints of citrus on the tongue, but mostly just a subtle orange character. I think what makes this beer stand out above the other Tripels is the awesome spice presence. The heavy clove flavors are so damn good, but somehow manage to not overwhelm once the sweetness comes in on the backend.  M/D: Medium bodied with lots of carbonation. A lively mouthfeel and very easy to drink with almost no hint of the high ABV. Sipping this brew would be wise, but I can’t resist drinking it faster than I should.  O: Overall, fantastic. It is the best example of one of my favorite styles, and all-in-all, one of a handful of my all time favorite beers. This is why I love craft beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TheWhiskerReview,4.39,"Pours a murky golden-orange with a 2-finger white head. Retention and lace are mild.  I'm sure the French-speaking Quebecians would scoff and swiftly boot me back to America for saying this, but the combination of the big malt and the fruity esters on this smelled to me, no joke, like Captain Crunch and Crunchberries cereal. Add some incredibly fragrant orange zest and orange blossoms, some clove and coriander spice, ripe pears and a deeply hidden alcohol, and you have the nose on this magnificent brew.  The malty palate has a bright carbonation and some earthy yeast tones to its clover honey vibe. The bitterness is mild, while the finish starts on the sweeter side of boozy (flavors of pear) and ends spicy, dry and somewhat grainy. As that all disappears I'm left with a nice, juicy mandarin orange flavor.  Overall, I was incredibly impressed with this juicy and delicious beer. And it's always nice to have one of those eureka moments when it dawns on you that you're smelling something so ludicrously awesome as Captain Crunch in a beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,seabass87,4.3,"Poured from 12 OZ bottle into chalice glass.  A- Pours a soft golden haze. Medium pour reveals almost no head.  S- Banana bread, oranges, sweet Belgian yeast, coriander, and white pepper. A background of darker fruits, maybe a hint of fig and plum? Sweet and spicy; well balanced and inviting.  T- Sweet, chewy Belgian yeast comes out front, followed by a variety of fruits... A very complex taste. I'm getting caramel apples and oranges, with suggestions of a darker fruit profile, like figs. There's a slight bitter fruit taste at the finish. All of the fruit flavors are contained well in a sweet malt envelope. Aftertaste is of spiced bread and nuts.  M- Medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation that gives it a bite. Finishes slightly dry.  O- A fantastic tripel, and an amazing beer all around. Also, a fair amount cheaper than an actual Belgian tripel import (about half as expensive at my local store). This one lives up to the hype and is extraordinarily good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Kuromaru,4.88,"Appearance--Pours a very cloudy, completely opaque pale yellow--almost white. An aggressive pour yields a full two-finger head, which dissipates quickly and leaves just a tad of lacing. The appearance of this beer is absolutely stunning.  Smell--Pretty much exactly what one would expect from a Belgian Tripel; heavy, swirling esters of earthy/ bready yeast, lightly toasted malts, exquisitely delicate spices. The alcohol presence is there, but is hidden very well, deep in the background. Though the yeast presence is the most prominent in the nose, it is soft around the edges and balances well with the spices and malts. It is very, very inviting.  Mouthfeel--Balanced, surprisingly light (but not too light) body, and surprisingly well carbonated for the style. Unbelievably refreshing, given the style.  Taste--The alcohol presence comes through stronger in the taste than in the nose, though it is still very buried and really only appears a bit at the finish. The yeast presence is not at all dense/ ""mushroomy"", as a tripel can be. This beer is not at all over-sugared or syrupy, as can be the case with some Belgian-style beers.  Overall--I again cannot emphasize enough how refreshing this beer is, given the strength and style. This beer is absolutely exceptional. The only things that I can think to improve upon would be simply matters of personal taste. As far as that goes, I like a tripel with a very strong spice presence in the nose, which is a tad lacking here, but again that is no reflection upon this beer, but my own personal taste. This beer is an absolute must-try. Nearly perfect.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Alieniloquium,4.12,"12 oz. bottle poured into a goblet.  Appearance - Hazy golden straw colored body with a nice, but fleeting, white head. A bit of lacing, but not much to speak of.  Smell - Yeasty and citrusy aroma. Exactly what I like to smell. Not much sweetness at all, but a strong orange kick.  Taste - What I like about this tripel is how spicy it is. It has very little malt sweetness and a nice spicy finish. Wheat flavors in the middle lend to a nice citrus flavor with a slightly bitter finish.  Mouthfeel - Very highly carbonated. It makes it taste lighter, but it masks some of the initial flavors. Dry finish, so the flavor is there and gone quickly.  Overall - Great tripel. I would love to see a bit more complexity and less carbonation, but a great go-to tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,andrao,4.33,"La Fin du Monde by Unibroue, poured from a standard 341mL bottle purchased in Montréal.  A - Rich; hazy; golden. Looks fantastic with a two finger head that is maintained throughout, while leaving slight lacing. Carbonation readily visible; this beer is alive and well.  S - Smells of a true Belgian tripel; Karmeliet comes to mind. Apricots, bananas; delicately spiced.  T/M - For 9% a.b.v., the taste is refreshingly subtle. The visual carbonation lives up to expectation with a nice effervescence accompanying malt and fruit flavours. Alcohol only evident with a familiar warming soon to follow. In short: delicious.  O - Given that a six pack is down the street and fairly priced, this is a beer I will have the pleasure of tasting many, many more times. A superb tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

A: Cloudy yeasty, yellow ochre / dark golden color with big fluffy white head that remained throughout the whole beer.  S/T: It's got that belgian tripel aroma, done really really well. Slightly spicy, very malty, with light fruitiness, yeast and alcochol all mixing into a heavenly scent and flavor experience. There is a definite alcohol warmth that mixes with the spicy finish.  M: Highly carbonated, light body, and has a warming finish.  O: A delicious beer. I haven't had a good belgian style in a while, and this was the perfect beer to fill the void. Everyone needs to try this beer. My favorite for the style, hands down",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Rijtjeshuis,4.25,"Served in a chalice  LOOK (4.5/5) This poured a darker golden color with some orange tones when held up to the light. It was a little more opaque than some other beers of the style, particularly the Westmalle. However, I think this was a really nice venue for the rich color. The only flaw in this category, I think was the brew's white head that rose quickly, dominated by larger bubbles than I would have liked, only to fade at a somewhat disappointing rate.  SMELL (4.5/5) The smell was initially dominated by the yeasty esters and phenols. The bouquet was pretty fruity, but was followed quickly by some deep spicy overtones and some citrus. There was also a nice wheatiness to the smell.  FLAVOUR (4/5) As with the smell, the beginning was dominated by the sweet fruitiness, which was balanced nicely with some very subtle malt flavors. The only problem here is that the brew took a quick turn towards the harsh alcoholic flavour before the yeast spices overpower that. Some great warming, not too hot.  FEEL (5/5) Very effervescent on the tip of the tongue in the initial taste (almost reminiscent of the more carbonated Belgian Ales, like Duvel in this respect). This transitions to a wonderful fullness as it washes to the back of the mouth. This balances the spiciness of the esters.  DRINK (4/5) super tasty and very drinkable - its dangerous because of it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Sean9689,4.23,"Finally getting around to this tick. 750ml bottle into Bruery tulip.  A - Opens with a nice ""pop"". Pours a golden yellow/orange color, nice frothy white head that reduces down to a thick collar with a thin cap.  S - Sweet citrus, fruity notes that remind me of pears, mango, pineapple. Not overly sweet, just right. Lots of tropical notes, slight malt as well.  T - Lots of sweet fruit and tropical notes: pears, pineapple, mango, apple. Excellent sweetness, malts, but mostly lots of fruit, bananas too. The 9% is very well hidden...ever heard of a 9% beer that's refreshing?  M - Light to medium body, good carbonation, fruity dry finish.  O - A very impressive Tripel, no doubt about it. The alcohol is hidden wonderfully and all the fruit going on with this beer is refreshing and just plain excellent. Worthy of the high praise and would buy again for sure.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jimboween,4.63,"hello: the end of the world. poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a nalgene at the fancy gap KOA in virginia. after an 815 mile drive and before a 587 miler.  appearance: cloudyish coppery goldeny goodness. if you took all the ""fun"" blondes are supposed to be having and melted it down into a liquid, it would look like this.  smell: it smells like a la fin du monde. this is good because usually when i smell la fin du monde, it means i'm about to drink la fin du monde.  taste: when i first tried it, i was trying to drink it like a natty ice. back then i bought it for its abv instead of writing an english paper. it was tough then, but now...its beautiful. peppery sorta, and spicy warmth from the alcohol backs up the pepper impression, but it balances impeccably with clove and malty sweetness.  mouthfeel: this one bites back. sip it and it warms your mouth and throat. blame the 9% for that. it is very bubbly too, though not so bubbly as it's belgian role model, duvel. this bubbliness i speak of adds to the bite.  overall: i love this beer. it emulates a duvel, at a relatively more modest price point and with an infinitely broader availability. its around enough to encourage you to drink it willy nilly, but it will catch up to you, i've met weaker wines than this strong boy. perfect when you want one before bed, or something to stand up to a steak. or even a cigar. njoy!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TheYeagermeister,4.83,"A--Pours a rich golden apricot color. Has a thick smooth head of about 1 1/2 inches, which retains well and leaves some lacing. Very appetizing from the start.  S--Heaven. The same apricot from the appearance, along with strong biscuit, yeast, and dough. I also detect some banana and clove.  T--Essence of sweet and ripe light fruits--pear, apricot, papaya--but it's not markedly sweet or cloing, by far. The biscuity, buttery yeast provides the perfect backdrop and rounds it out into a beautiful dry finish.  M--Smooth, rich, and creamy, it coats the palate and allows the complex tastes to linger for miles.  D--The alcohol is remarkedly well hidden, though the warmth is there. This could kick your butt if you're not careful.  Overall, this is one of the best belgians I've ever had. It is frickin beautiful. Stellar example of this style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Eriktheipaman,4.37,Poured a fairly light yellow with little white head.  The smell was great. Spicy from the yeast but very balanced from malt.  The taste was on par with the smell. A nice amount of spice esters from the yeast but VERY well balanced by the malt profile. Some caramel hidden in there as well.  I was lucky enough to find a great bottle list of Belgian styled beers at a french restaurant. I had this paired with some garlic and scallion muscles and it was perfect. I couldn't have asked for more.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S: Fruity sour esters, pale malt, candied sugar,spice, and slight citrus hops.  T: Starts with large sweat bread malts and shifts to earthy yeast and sour fruit. Citrus pine joins sweet spice and warm alcohol in the finish that lingers.  M: Heavy body and smooth.  O: I have had this beer quite a few times (it is one of my favorites), and I was shocked to see that I had not rated it. This is an amazing beer that defines rather than represents a Tripel. It has a great color and a large head, wonderful complex aromas and flavors, nice body, and balanced use of alcohol. I really enjoy the earthy flavors that add another dimension to this brew. It is called world class, and it deserves that title.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,FrankenBeerStein,4.35,"Pours out a light gold color, slightly hazy texture, with a light head, maybe a half finger. Pretty good head retention as well. Smell is very light, some minor hint of floral hops and light malts. Taste has some light malt sweetness and finishes with a hint of hop bite. Mouthfeel has a comfortable thickness to it, slightly reminiscent of the texture of a light hefeweissen. Overall, a very refreshing beer without the overpowering ""Belgian funk"" that one gets with the Belgian yeasts. Also hides the higher ABV% well. Definitely a ""must try"", and one I would drink again, as well as getting to share with others.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,blackcompg,3.9,"Purchased a 4pk, poured from their 12oz bottle @ 40 degrees into a 12oz beer glass - nice looking bottle, colorful label, like the silver foil. Had a Duvel last night, looking forward to this, inverted the bottle & stirred up the sediments, let it rest, here we go...  Appearance - Wow! Very audible carbonation, nearly 3 quick fingers of tiny, tight white bubbles, down to just under a finger in 2 minutes. Color is a completely opaque warm amber, yellow to orange hilites when held to the light, barely visible steady bubbles rising within. Appearance reminds me of a hefeweizen.  Smell - From the bottle: Fresh bakery banana bread, yeast, honey, citrus, smells great. From the glass: Same as from the bottle, but now also some floral and grass notes, very slite minerals. Really a wonderful smell, complex, inviting, time to sip...  Taste - Lots of flavors going on here, but the taste doesn't completely follow the smell. Pretty big banana, citrus and yeast up front, some tangerine, pears and plums at the middle, finishes to a floral meadow, then long minerals and alcohol. There are many nice flavors here, just not quite balanced in my opinion, and with no hops to hide the alcohol, booze is the longest flavor on the palate. Not especially surprising at 9% ABV.  Mouthfeel - Medium mouthfeel, a little juicy, a little sweet, somewhat low carbonation, drinkability is good overall.  Overall - I wanted to like this beer more - I was very excited at the appearance and the smell, and while I liked the taste, it just didn't come together for me personally. It was like shifting 3 different gears - sweet fruits, floral meadows, then booze. Don't get me wrong, it's still a very good beer, and we all have our personal preferences. Try this and see if you like it, there are many excellent reviews on this site for this beer. This beer reminded me alot of Sam Adams Imperial White actually.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,theJollySin,4.8,"A - I usually snub ""appearance"" as being an important factor in what makes a good beer. And perhaps it was after a few beers that I decided I loved the way this one looked, but I do. It has a wonderful dark, vibrant golden color.  S - The smell is great. It smells hoppier than it tastes, which is a bit off-putting, but generally strong with fruity undertones.  T - A wonderful combination of delicate and strong, complicated but not overly so. A hoppy yellow ale with strong notes of fruit and something I can't place. The end effect is particularly pleasing.  M - Good. Thinner than a stout, but thicker than a lager. Just a bit thicker than an October fest brew with a good amount of natural fiz.  O - Overall, great. This has been one of my favorite beers for years. While I don't think it is easy enough to be as popular to drink as Guiness, I think it has a perfectly balanced flavor, at least for my tastes.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,tripelhops,4.2,"poured into a tulip glass, color is a hazy straw color. Initiaal glass had 3 fingers worth of white head that faded quickly and left little behind. 2nd pour was less frothy. As said very little alcohol presence, until feeling it later on. Decent to high carbonation, big mouthfeel. Belgian yeast, bananas and bready malt are aromsa out of the glass. while cold, spice and bitterness is tasted immediately, but as the beer warms up, those traits fade away slightly. Excellent triple and very easy drinking.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Taste of yeast, bread, malt, some sweet fruits, hints of clove and a very slight touch of alcohol.  Mouthfeel is light leaning to heavy body body, low carbonation. Very crisp and smooth drinking beer, the alcohol is well masked and eventually sneaks up and smacks you on the side of the head.  Overall this is a top notch tripel, very enjoyable and another good beer from Unibroue.

22,34,claytong,4.17,"i was thinking this was overrated a bit when i first sipped this beer (i had it five years ago when i was 18 and went up to montreal for the summer and do remember liking it for its name and taste) so yes, the name is cool, logo lacks a bit. i know quebecoise are a proud bunch, but is quebec the end of the world cause thats what it makes it look like. anyways enough rambling...  appearance - nice head, lacing lingers head does not, crystal clear gold with minor amber hue, now poured second half and its hazy as hell, cant see through it at all.  smell - when cold just got the yeast but now apple, and some caramel, minor pepper and hops come and go  taste - belgian yeast when cold, when it warms, get some minor spices, and some grape, surprised theres no alcohol in there at all, really complex, if i liked the style more im sure this would be a 4.5  mouthfeel - incredibly smooth, wheres the alcohol? feel it a bit when its down in my belly  overall - when i go back to quebec, which im sure i will, this can be a go to drink. i remember it being ridiculously cheap there, too (i was poor theres no way i wouldve bought it otherwise)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,GrizzlyBeer1282,4.85,"Look: This beer pours a beautiful golden-orange tint with a medium laced, sparkly white head that slowly fizzles as the beer settles in the glass.  Smell: This beer has dozens of subtle aromas that combine for a very unique scent. I detect some citrus in there (mainly orange peel), a spicy-peppery scent, some caramel, little bit of bread and a hint of alcohol which is well balanced with the malt. There is a very slight hint of hops but with very little bitterness. It’s truly a very interesting combination of aromas.  Taste: At 9% alc./vol. this beer may be the best I've tried at masking the taste of the alcohol. You would never know that this is a highball beer because there is virtually no alcohol presence on the palate. It is very easy to consume too much of this beer because it has such a delicate combination of flavors that come together to conceal the liquor. For the most part it tastes like it smells, but a bit more tangy. There are hints of orange citrus, spices, caramel, very malty, slightly peppery, bread and a very slight hint of hops but without any of the bitterness. The way the combination of flavors combines to cover up the alcohol taste is truly extraordinary. This is a very insidious beer and you'll find it very hard to wake up the next morning after 3 of these bad boys so be careful.  Feel: This beer has a dry, prickly feel with a spicy, warm and toasty finish to it. It is very light and smooth for a strong pale ale but also packs a little bit of bite which I find appealing in a pale ale. I find it hard to even call it a strong ale but going by the alc. content it would fall into that category. This is definitely a slow sipper, perfect beer to just relax and enjoy on a nice hot summer day.  Overall: This is an easy drinking, very complex and transcendent beer with many subtle characteristics that come together very nicely to form a smooth, clean, dry and fresh ale. This is one of my favorite styles and easily one of my favorite beers. A must try for the golden ale lovers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

T - Pine, fresh cilantro/coriander, orange zest, and white bread. Alcohol is noticeable a few seconds after the drink.  M - Smooth, just prickly enough to accentuate the bitterness of the hops.

Color is golden yellow.  S - yeast notes and faint sweetness dominate the smell of this beer. Other than that there is not much of a smell to speak of.  T - Very good. Not the best beer I have had by far, but still some pleasant notes detectable in this beer. Can definitely taste some yeast funk in here with some sweet notes. Some dried fruits are present as well, but not to a great degree. Near the end of the sip there is some definite hop bitterness that becomes present.  M - very smooth mouthfeel to this beer. Some slight carbonation notes can be detected as well.  O - Overall there is not much to set this beer apart from other beers out there. The one thing that it does have going for it is that it is very drinkable and smooth on the palate. There is some hop bite near the end of the sip that makes a little less enjoyable for me, but overall it is an above average beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Mouthfeel is luxurious, so seductively smooth and drinkable.  Overall, an outstanding version of the style. This beer would be a perfect pairing with so many foods, strong enough to stand up to anything but never dominant. Just a world-class beer that I think anyone would enjoy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Stretch270,4.77,"Served in a tulip glass from 750ml bottle.  Appearance - a nice cloudy, golden yellow hue with a very creamy looking and dense head, almost blanket like with some very dense bubbles.  Smell - the heavy yeast really came across first for me. After the yeast I got a nice fruitiness. Something almost like a spicy apricot.  Taste - this is a really fantastic beer as many have previously stated. For me, it comes ti down to the heavy yeast flavor that makes for a nice complement to the malt which comes a little later. The crisp fruitiness also makes for a very well balanced beer that is just a joy to sit nd relax with.  Mouthfeel- the first word that comes to mind is the texture f the beer. The creamy, dense head makes for a lucious texture that combines with a refreshingly light feeling body.  Overall - this is just a phenomenal beer that really gives a delicious yeasty and fruity flavor, but yet has some complexities that I will have to try it many more times to decipher it all. An amazing beer, a pleasure to drink.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Overall, best Tripel I think I've had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,DaveBlack,4.77,"One of my favorite Belgian style beers, and by far my favorite that I've had from this brewery. Just now getting around to reviewing it, though.  A: Cloudy, rich yellow color. Head is maybe 1/2 a finger, and falls down to a thin layer relatively quickly.  S: Belgian yeast, Candy sweetness, stone fruits. Alcohol comes through as well, lending a richness of aroma. Amazing smelling beer.  T: Sweet malts hit up front with a slight ester fruitiness. The sweetness gives way to a slight bitter taste and a punch from the alcohol that keeps the beer from being cloying. Overall impression is that of a sweet beer that is wonderful balanced with the other elements.  M: Pretty heavy on the carbonation, medium bodied and slightly sticky.  O: As I said: One of my favorite Belgian style beers. Infinitely drinkable, it balances all the flavors nicely and not only keeps the 9% alcohol from overpowering the taste of the other elements, but actually incorporates it into the balance. Really a great beer, worth going well out of your way for.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Smell: Pepper spice, cloves and some fruityness to go along  Taste: Right off the bad incredible. Very sweet upfront with a lot of malts that translates into a spicey clove taste. Slight hoppiness to finish  Mouthfeel: Extremely smooth. Alcohol is masked pretty darn well until you finish and realize it.  Overall delicious beer. Definitely coming back for more and more of this.

T&M: Mouthfeel is very crisp with a slightly dry aftertaste. A lot of carbonation. Taste is very fruity and a little sweet. My most recent foray into this style was very boozy in taste, so I'm impressed how the alcohol is hidden beneath the malts in this brew. A very nice taste, not too heavy, tastes great on a warm summer night like tonight.  O: I purchased this one after my last try of a tripel when I saw that this was the highest rated in it's style. It definitely is very good, I can't saw with certainty that it's better than all others in this style, but still very tasty.

22,34,Tford,5,"A: It pours an opaque light yellow-brown with a creamy two finger head that hangs around for a while before subsiding.  S: It smells of fruits and malts; there is no scent of the 9% abv.  T: This starts as malty, and then gets fruitier but the malts are still present throughout; there is a quite bitter aftertaste. It is also sweet, but it is not overdone to the point of sugarcane. Alcohol is present in the taste, but it is not overpowering everything like so many other high abv beers.  M: This has a lot of carbonation causing it to have a light body. It kind of feels like a pilsner, but it’s an ale, so it’s quite unique in that sense.  O: This is a fantastic beer, the only one so far that has truly lived up to its hype.

22,34,Bouleboubier,4.92,"Probably the biggest shock to my senses from any beer, having this for the first time about 10 years ago. I don't know what was most unique or strange beer I had had up to that point - maybe Delirium Tremens or Skull Splitter. But this made me make a face. By now I've adjusted, shifted to accept and enjoy flavors and sensations a bit further out towards the fringes from this. ""La Fin"" still excites and just about overwhelms me to this day.  Textbook explosion of Belgian carbonation - egg-shell white spongy foam, slow to fade, but fade it does. Dawn-light yellow-amber juice, heavenly haze. Scent of delicate flowery-perfume and fresh herb green leafiness (cilantro?). Honey-kissed lemon butter cookie, ambiguous enlivening citrus, and chased with residual bottom-dwelling yeasty gunk. Silky and spicy, potent and bold (like the smell) on the tongue. Honey (up front), clove (in and around), and banana tincture (late). Dessert malty along side. Can't underplay the super jolt of young orange/lemon 1/3-sour tang and shaved-sharp herbal rush holding on. The spiciness seems to mask or actually contribute to a restrained, snail-snow rising warmth. Hmmm...it's so smooth and cold-clean, drops off sudden dry - nothing.  Still my favorite beer - love the label, love the post-liminal. (On-tap - a dream unfulfilled)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The smell is is wonderful with belgian yeast notes up front with the floral spiciness following and finishing with malty breadiness. the taste is very similar to the smell with a great belgian yeasty spiceness up front and a bread like sweetness to finish it off. the mouthfeel is amazing as the beer seems pretty dry at first then in the finish rounds out with a little sweetness, and nice carbonation. overall this beer is an A+",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

A sprightly mousse that fades to nothing almost immediately.  S - Light malt, with a hoppy hint. Really sets you up to enjoy the taste.  T - A home run of taste, again the light malt hits the tongue, blends easily with a citrus and slight sweetness. If you find Delirium Tremens too sweet, this is a tripel you should try. Each sip invites another immediate sip.  M - The carbonation keeps it light in the mouth. It has that Westmalle Tripel mouthfeel that takes me back to La Morte Subite in Brussels.

Well after reading countless stellar reviews here on BA, I finally grabbed a 12 oz bottle. Best before 12/16/13 on back of label, poured into Duvel Tulip...  Pours a gorgeous unfiltered, golden honey colored hue with around a finger's worth of luscious, white, frothy head. Great retention and plenty of decorative lacing as the head slowly dissipates.  Nose is full of various aromas that blend together beautifully. Belgian yeast mustiness, light fruits such as apple and pear, mixed spices; predominantly white pepper, and some slight booze.  I'm not exactly sure how to go about adequately describing this, but I'll give it my best shot. Lots of spice, mainly pepper and clove kick it off, leading way into some boozy warmness. Fruit flavors and malty sweetness are more apparent in the back end, complemented by the slightest hop bitterness. Finishes off nice, crisp and semi dry. A Very complex and really nice Tripel.  Medium bodied with plenty of carbonation and a nice creamy consistency. At 9% this obviously isn't a session beer, but is too damn drinkable to be a sipper. Drink with caution.  Overall, this thing is fantastic. At around $12 a four pack, its real affordable as well. One of the best Tripels I've ever had, hands down.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

A sweet symphony of various flavors all combined flawlessly and seamlessly. Malt, spice, hints of fruit. A ton going on, but never overwhelming, nor cloying. 9% alcohol masked extremely well.  M: 5.0 'nuff said.  D: The great thing about this brew is you can choose to ignore the complexity and session it (at your peril), or revel in the menagerie. Unibroue leaves it up to you.

22,34,Interfectus,4.08,"In the interest of full disclosure, I'm not fundamentally opposed to Tripel's, but they're not really my first choice in beer style. However, this one is just delightful :) The color is pretty beautiful, pouring as a opaque golden color. The head was a bit foamier at first (as with all Belgians) , but it soon settled into a nice, thin, creamy blanket resting on top. At 9% the alcohol content is relatively high, but the sweet honey flavors, malts, and yeasts balance each other very well, effectively masking any overwhelming taste of alcohol. Carbonation wasn't overbearing (my usual complaint with Belgian beers). Probably the best Tripel I've ever had. Definitely worth a try, even if you're not a fan of Belgian style beer (which I'm not!).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mryuk,4,"pours an unfiltered gold with two fingers of head.  smell is a bit sour and very fruity. all malts.  taste is sour and sweet, smooth with very little alcohol.  mouth is medium bodied. very smooth for a 9.0.  pretty good light belgian. not my favorite attempt but good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,schlimenhaumer,4.2,"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass at low altitude.  A: Pours a nearly opaque honey color with a large foamy white head that dissipates quickly. There's a lot of carbonation floating up to the top of the glass.  S: Dark fruits, floral smells, yeasty notes and a hint of booze in the background. Definitely piques my interest.  T: Wheat and yeast notes up front give way to a fruity sourness that reminds me of slightly under-ripe cherries. The booze doesn't come through whatsoever in the taste.  M: Dry all the way though as you'd expect from a tripel. Spot on for the style.  D: Not something you'd drink every day, but I drank the entire bottle by myself without any trouble.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,musicforairports,4.12,"Cloudy, on the lighter side of golden. One-finger head leaves minimal lacing.  Smells spicy and full of Belgian yeast. Pepper, clove, banana, apple, some mustiness.  Taste is smooth and comes on strong in the last half. Very spicy in a peppery way. Sweet and fruity. Finishes with some alcohol and lingering banana flavors.  Mouthfeel is medium, a bit creamy on the end. More carbonated that the pour would suggest.  This is a very solid beer, and very easy to find. Unibroue makes quality stuff.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,vfgccp,4.2,"A – Cloudy, pale tan-yellow. Almost like banana juice. Fine bubbled head with nice retention and lace.  S – Earthy, Belgium spices: coriander, pepper corn, orange zest. Dull edges. Touch of booze.  T – Slow to ramp-up. Black pepper, nectarine, booze. Herbal bitter middle with coriander and faint banana. Warm booze on the backend.  M – Nice, medium body with a bright carbonation, and a boozy sweet finish.  O – A nice, complex brew that’s easy to drink at a slow-to-moderate pace, and easy to pair with a broad range of foods. A good cocktail-party beer if you will.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,July2Nov,4.35,"Appearance: Beautiful cloudy, orange-brown in color. Had a finger width of head on it after the pour, but went down to a thin lacing after it set for awhile.  Smell: Very fruity smelling (ripe granny smith apples).  Taste & Mouthfeel: Nice taste of raisins and apples. Gets a bit bready after the initial tasting. Some carbonation comes through. Has a rum raisin bread flavor at the very end. Aftertaste is mild and the high abv is very well hidden with just a touch of heat letting you know it's there.  Overall: This is always a go to beer for me and I finally got around to reviewing it. This is so highly rated that I can't really add to much more to it other than; If you haven't had it before...do yourself a favor and get it. So many people can't be wrong!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

I know its not quite the perfect glass for it, but it will work tonight.  a- pours a slightly hazy golden color with a big almost 2"" white frothy head. it faded fairly quick, but left a bit of lacing down the glass  s-fruit and Belgian yeast. i smell raisin, banana, a little clove some green apple maybe, brown sugar and some biscuit.  t-again with the yeast and fruit. raisin, banana, dark sugar and some hops and dryness at the end  m-a lot more carbonation that i remember but it works very well for this style. it lets the flavors bounce around a bit. doesnt feel like a heavy beer at all, it goes down smoothly, but the 9% abv is nowhere to be found  overall, every time I try this, I remember that it is one of my favorites of any tripels out there...and from Canada no less. Unibroue consistently puts out an incredible brew that I will always seek out. And for $10 a 4-pack, I dont mind purchasing whenever I find it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

T: Pine nuts with grapefruit and a boozy aftertaste that is smooth.  M: One of the best carbonations of a beer I have ever tried. World class mouthfeel that is medium bodied and extremely pleasant.

About 1 finger of bright white head which reduces to a thick ring, leaving some good lacing behind. Some carbonation is coming off the bottom of the glass.  S: Nose is of cloves, some bananas, small citrus notes, and some esters.  T: Spicy and sweet. Light fruit notes with some faint pepper notes in the background. I'm also getting some very small acidic notes, dry finish.  M: Light/medium-bodied, good carbonation which cleanses the palate well. The 9% ABV is almost non existent. A very easy drinking tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BarryMFBurton,4.15,"La Fin du Monde: “The End of the World.” It seems more than fitting, considering the absurdity of last Saturday. I’ve been in a Belgian sort of mood recently, and this has been one I’ve been wanting to cross off my list for a while now. If anything, just for the wire cork cage on top.  A: The body is a rich, cloudy gold. There’s a familiar Belgian foaminess that brings a bubbly white head to about an inch, sending fizz up from the bottom of the glass. Pretty good, for not having a lot of head.  S: Very acidic; phenols rising big in the nose. Grape, mandarin, peach are interspersed throughout. Booze and clean wheat at the back end.  T: Thankfully, not as acidic as the nose. It’s quite smooth – not jarring, like many phenol-heavy offerings in this style. Clovey and herbal, with more than a tinge of esters. The fruit isn’t strong, but peach/apricot and grape are the most evident. The palate is not incredibly complex, but nonetheless satisfying.  M: The sparkling body leaves nothing to the imagination. This particular Belgian seems too viscous to be that effervescent, but it’s not incredibly out of place.  O: For now, I can only say I like this one - although at times, I love it. At this range of wholesome beer goodness, it's tough to decipher my feelings. But, as it stands, this is not one I’ll be talking about for a while. That being said, it’s a great example of this style, with a clear emphasis on yeast and esters. This would be the perfect introduction to someone who’s new to this type of beer, or Belgians in general.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,beerprovedwright,4.57,"Less head than I had expected, but quite thick one finger float. Lace is light but clingy. Color is a slightly hazy 5 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is intoxicating, with sweet aromas of apple, melon, grapefruit, cranberries, and malt. Taste is fruity/flowery, with flavors of apples, grapes, figs, melon, grapefruit, and warm spices. Mouthfeel is a little bit sticky, but creamy with ample amounts of carbonation. Just a bit of drying on the sides of my tongue and soft palate. The warming effect from the ample amount of alcohol sort of hits you like ever increasing waves of the ocean. One of these will give you a great buzz. A little sweet to drink them one after another, but a great beer to sip while enjoying conversation or a good movie.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,gc4hokies,4.27,"Pours a cloudy golden color with a tint of orange. Has a fluffy white head, fairly large bubbles, dissipates fairly quick.  Aroma is of clove and orange with some other fruity esters that I'm not quite sure of. Very nice.  Taste is pure Belgian goodness. I get the same clove and faint orange peel with alcohol warmth at the finish. Mouthfeel is fairly light for a 9% abv beer. Easy drinking. Dangerous!  Overall, excellent.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jifigz,4.62,Bottle poured into a tulip glass.  A: A nice hazy yellow/orange color. Nice head upon pour that disappeared rather quickly leaving small amounts of lacing.  S: Extremely fruity in the nose. The smell is of raisins and ripe bananas and of certain white wines.  T: The taste is very sweet on this beer. The finish is a little dry due to the ethanol and very slightly bitter. The dominating forces in the taste are the fruit like flavors and the alcohol and a lingering white grape juice type taste is noticeable for a long while after each sip. Very enjoyable.  M: The mouthfeel is a little over carbonated which doesn't promote huge sips that would burn the mouth or throat such as a soda. It helps me drink this one slowly and really enjoy this beer. The body of this beer is not too heavy.  O: This is easily one of my favorite tripels. Unibroue most certainly makes some of the best Belgians outside of Belgium and this one is at the top of their list in my opinion. Great stuff and I enjoy one every chance I get.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Rifugium,3.8,"First had: bottle at Washington House, Sellersville, PA  Pours a cloudy yellow-orange with a small white head that disappeared almost instantly. Yeasty aroma with lots of fruits, and a bit of spice. Bready taste, malty, light sugars, a touch of spice, fruit salad: banana, peach, pear, and a lot of sour orange and grapefruit zest, giving an instant drying effect. Medium mouthfeel, a bit syrupy, with a crisp, dry finish. Pleasantly drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,neophilus,4.42,"Corked and caged, this beer pours a golden straw color, the light seems to get trapped in the cloudy body and brightens up the glass. A thick white head crowns the top of this beautiful pour and hangs around till the glass is half empty.  A heady aroma floods my nose- spicy, peppery, and fruity scents mingle quite pleasantly. It is strong, but clean and not overpowering. The belgian yeast character really shines through here.  The taste delivers everything that the aroma promised. The hops balances the yeasty spice, the bitterness dancing around the edge of my palate. Crisp, robust yeast flavors take center stage, hiding the malt sweetness.  A medium body with a good dose of carbonation cleanly washes way the fruity yeast flavors, leaving a lingering peppery flavor before the crisp finish.  This is everything I could want in a Belgian style Tripel. The funky tones of the Belgian yeast are in full force without overpowering my palate. The body is not too thin but washes down quite easily. Everything is in perfect balance.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,calcio360jrd,4.5,"The cream of the crop of the unibroue beers in my opinion. 9% beast that drinks like a session beer.

S – Fruity esters are prominent as is a spicy, clove and coriander aroma. Some floral hops shine through as well.  T – Sweet up front with some mild bitterness from the hops and alcohol toward the finish. A juicy, tangy bite hits the sides of the tongue from the Belgian yeast. Toasty malts are also present.  M – The mouthfeel is where I think Unibroue excels. This has a medium body with just enough carbonation to compliment the higher ABV and big malt body very well. Finish is only slightly sticky.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Not as strong or as powerful as I've experienced in my other favorite tripels. I smell pear and lemon and spicy yeast.  Similar to the nose. Everything is right, but not quite as strong and powerful as I was hoping to see. Bright, lemony, yeasty, tangy along with some bitterness.  Wonderful, smooth, airy, bubbly, light yet full mouthfeel.  A great, affordable, available, delicious tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Mouthfeel: Medium body, high carbonation that is typical of a tripel.  Overall: One of the best tripels out there, especially for the price. Love it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ngeunit1,4.5,"A - Pours a slightly haze bright golden-orange color with a big two fingers of super frothy white head. The head fades slowly down to a think ring leaving behind lots of lace.  S - Aroma is full of citrus fruits (orange) and banana and Belgian yeast. There is also some bready aroma, some light spices, and a touch of other sweetness.  T - Starts off with some tart lemon flavor and some light yeast. There is also a bit of spiciness in the background and some bready malt. Through the middle, the fruit flavor gets stronger with some banana flavor. The finish is a mix of citrus flavor and some tartness/sourness and some yeast and spices and a touch of alcohol that lingers very nicely.  M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Really smooth and crisp without being even a touch watery. The finish is a really nice blend of flavors with just the right amount of lingering tartness.  D - Very drinkable. The 9% abv here is dangerous, since it is hidden so well. Everything feels very well balanced and blends together very nicely.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,gonzogrover,3.96,"Poured into a tulip glass. Pours a bright yellow with a small white head that goes away fast. The scent is of some spicy yeast with a sweet, bready background. The taste brings out more of that sweetness and the spiciness is right there with it. The bread flavor is lying around back there but isn't as prevalent. The mouthfeel is very carbonated but it doesn't feel over the top for this beer. I enjoyed this beer quite a bit and will keep it in my fridge at all times.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TMoney2591,4.33,"Served in a flared pokal at Bliss.  Not really sure what something like this is doing at a Cinco de Mayo tasting, but I'm not gonna argue with good beers being served to me. It pours a lightly cloudy straw topped by a tall tor of stark white foam. The nose comprises black pepper, clove, banana, orange peel, wheat, and cardamom. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some light candi sugar and light caramel. This added bit of sweetness and minor complexity boost really makes everything come together nicely on my tongue. The body is a hefty light (or a really light medium), with a moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, a great beer, one of the best tripels currently on the market. Get some!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,oglmcdgl,4.1,A bottle poured into a sick la chouffe tulip.  A- a firm pour yields two fingers of bright white head that holds for a little then settles to leave a solid ring and a few wisps on top. Slightly hazy golden sunshine yellow in color.  S- funky spicy yeast with a banana and biscuit flair. Other fruits and bready touches here and there.  T- nice back and forth between fruity esters and slightly funked up yeast. Malts a bone dry and scone like. Lots of spice and sweet.  M- just about medium in body with a nice smooth yet bright carb.  O- its been to long since I've had one of these.

Finishes bright and crisp, excellent fine carbonation and creamy mouthfeel. Overall a killer Tripel, good standby selection.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JCaweinstein,3.95,"Poured a burnt orange into a snifter glass. Creamy white head dissapates fairly quickly but there is a nice lacing left on the glass. It smells sweet, citrusy like oranges. You can tell the smell is a large part of this beer experience. Taste is first crisp and tart followed by sweet malts. Finish is citrusy like lemons and is very refreshing. This is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. At 9% ABV I cannot detect much alcohol presence making this tasty brew rather dangerous. This beer looks good smells good and has some complex flavors. Again, with the high abv and the beer itself being very smooth makes this beer very good. One I will have again, looking forward to having it on draft.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,MattyV,4.32,"I'm surprised it'd taken me this long to review this beer, it was one of my gateway craft beers...  Pours a hazy golden-apricot colour, a bit lighter than I expected/remembered, with a 1 finger frothy white head that has decent staying power. Nose is predominantly yeasty aromas from the Unibroue house strain, a good mix of fruit, cloves, and pepper with a touch of alcohol. There's a light fruitiness again in the taste--peach, pears, apricots, and banana, which give way to peppery spice and faint almost citrusy bitterness. Very suitable medium body with prickly carbonation. Drinkability is dangerously high considering the ABV. Although I am rather fond of the entire Unibroue lineup, I consider this to be my favourite. Picking up a heavily disocunted six-pack makes the occasional bottle return/refund at TBS all the more worthwhile.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Mario61Aler,4.7,"Opened the 341 ml bottle and poured into a tulip, was a cloudy lt. gold, that had a nice head that reduced to a very nice lacing.  The aroma was complex light hints of spices and fruits and alcohol, well balanced.  Tasted as the aroma suggested no surprises here mild fruits, spices, honey, barest hint of alcohol that left hardly any unpleasant after taste.  Medium to thin body, medium carbination, that leaves the mouth clean!  Overall I will revisit this one often it could become a favorite.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,KYBrewgrass,4.14,"A- 3.5 Though the pour is a rather bland, straw golden color that is perfectly transparent, this brew has a tremendous fluffy white head on the pour that makes it look OK. Very smooth, slippery lacing.  S- 4.5 This reeks of clove and spices and yeast, combining to form a sweetness similar to bubble gum. Banana also comes to mind. Very pleasant.  T- 4 The taste of La Fin Du Monde is heavier in wheat than I expected from its smell. It does have a nice touch of clove. It's not as sweet as i gathered from the aroma, and the yeast is present. There's the slightest bit of lemon citrus on the finish. Pretty well-balanced taste, really, as nothing overpowers the others.  M- 4.5 A touch high in carbonation, but very smooth and it has a creamy feel on the way down. A shade under medium in body. No heat at all in this brew.  D- 4 This is a very solid offering from Unibroue. It is well-balanced, smooth, and not very heavy at all. The flavor is not my personal top choice in profile but it is good. A few of these would be certainly doable. All around, a good wheat brew worth trying for certain.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Mouthfeel - Carbonation is nice and the beer is a little creamy after a few seconds in the mouth. Pretty good stuff here.  Overall - A good beer with A LOT of flavor.

No lace on the glass.  I don't know but I think I smell Musk, maybe beacause of the Canadian influence but I do smell Musk.  Taste is otherworldly. I never tasted a beer like this. It has a perfume taste to it. I don't think I like it. The aftertaste smacks of citrus and seems to linger.  Mouthfeel is not pleasant.  Overall I would not buy this beer again.

The smell announces fruit in various forms as well as a bread, dough flavor. The taste up front confirms the presence of fruit like peach, banana,, pear and little citrus. In the middle we meet the taste of bread and dough, keeping the sweetness in check. Malt is there as well.

Sweet breadlike aromas followed by apple, pear, banana. The usually spiciness of a Tripel comes through as well.  Taste is funky and fruity at first, followed by the sweetness from the nose. The familiar banana/clove/bubblegum of a Belgian shine through in this one, but the fruitiness is more complex, with apple, pear, white grape coming through. Belgian yeast really does is job well with that nice spicy bread-like flavor coming through as well. Very sweet finish. Excellent.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good bit of carbonation.

In addition to lemon zest, orange, and some yeastiness, there's a bit of pepper as well. Perfect for the sun.  m: on the higher end of carbonation for the style, but it works well for this beer. Nice crisp feel, appropriate viscosity and a great aftertaste.  o: this is an amazing beer for spring/summer.

S: Spicy, fruity, sweet, yeasty malts. Pepper is the main spice, banana and pear in the fruit spectrum.  T: Pepper and cinnamon, citrusy (mellow orange) fruit, smidge of apricot, sweet malt. All the notes you expect in a tripel, in splendid balance. Long and lingering finish maintains the spice and sweetness together. Some soft minerals, as well as a slightly whipped cream flavor, tie the flavor and mouthfeel together.  M: On the light side of medium body, excellent carbonation gives a creamy and billowy mouthfeel. Suave.  O: Pure delight and joy.

Subtle spicy and citrus notes, but pear is the predominate aroma.  Taste: For 9% alcohol it is very well hidden, but that could be a bad thing because it is also exceptionally drinkable. It is a touch spicy and finishes dry. There are citrus notes that compliment the spiciness derived from the yeast.  Mouthfeel: Very light and lively. There is a lot of carbonation in this beer, which makes it very drinkable and very refreshing.  Overall: An excellent beer from our brothers from the north.

22,34,ElCommodoro,2.23,"Poured a cloudy opaque light brown colour with a tan head. It smelled yeasty and citrusy. The taste was strongly of cloves. There were also citrus notes and peppery hops. It was somewhat sweet and had some yeasty notes. Not as overbearing as I feared from the smell. However, the clove taste was too strong to be pleasant. It was the primary character of the beer. The actual ingredient was probably coriander, I suppose, which is frequently used to flavour trippels. However, I found its overbearing character unpleasant. It didn't form a piece of the beer's character. Rather, it was probably covering many other notes it may have had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Tons of carbonation streaming from the bottle of the glass.  S- Strong citrus, tropical fruit aroma, bubblegum, and pear  T- Very strong orange citrus flavor that is very juicy (almost just like tropicana orange juice), tropical fruit, pear, yeast, coriander, and a little hop bitterness.  M- Champagne like due to the high carbonation, finishes dry  O- Quite possible the most drinkable beer I have ever had, especially for 9% ABV. This is dangerously drinkable. There are so many delicious juicy fruit flavors in this beer and at this point in my craft beer drinking time this is one of the best tasting beers and best overall beers I have ever had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Settles to a solid cap and left lots of lacing around the top of the tulip glass with a specs of lace around the lower half.  S: Lots of lighter fruits (pears with cloves and some spiciness. Quite of bit of yeast in the aroma as well.  T: Lighter fruits with some orange peel in there too. Decent amount of yeast in the taste. Finishes with some spices on my tongue. No taste of alcohol at all.  M: Medium carbonation with a medium body.  O: I’m starting to get more into this style of beer and this was a great beer. I will definitely be buying this again.

The head comes recedes after a couple minutes to form a nice dusting and thick ring around the edge. The lacing attempts to hold onto the glass, but falls victim to gravity and only thickens the foam ring throughout consumption.  Green banana, pear, and golden apple aromas mingle nicely with a sweet maltiness and clove spiciness.  Black grapes and grapefruit up front. A light but sweet peppery maltiness fills in. The sip then ends with lemon and green sour apple. A dry bready aftertaste follows in after a minute or two.  Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer washes over your tongue nicely, delivers its pleasurable flavors, then finishes without being watery.  The flavors are bold but not overwhelming, as La Fin Du Monde would pair nicely with a number of foods.

22,34,dirtyskunk,4.21,"This is a great looking beer, it fills up my snifter with piles of white head that stays around forever and leaves thick, heavy lacing clinging to the sides. The color is a warm hazy orange with a good deal of visible carbonation.  It smells sweet and yeasty with orange zest (I can even detect a little bitter pith) and bread and a little caramel or booze in the background.  This is a very solid tripel, sweet but not overwhelming, toasty malts, minimal hops. For some reason it reminds me of french toast. It has a lot going for it but not quite enough depth of complexity to merit a 5 from me.  The mouthfeel of this beer is what really stands out to me. It's full and syrupy, almost a custard consistency. The real accomplishment is that this doesn't detract from the drinkability or overpower any of the beer's other characteristics. Otherwise the beer is quite good but unremarkable, but the overall package delivered by the taste and mouthfeel is what makes this a great beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The taste is very dry, again a mix of spices and fruits. The flavors are well blended, such that it's hard to pick out specifics. The alcohol is a present, but welcome, giving the beer body and strength, without becoming too noticeable.  Overall, this is a good Tripel, but very dry. I would have liked a bit more sweetness to it. There's a very nice Belgian complexity to the beer, such that I rarely find in beers made outside of Belgium.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S- slight notes of pepper some light soft fruits come through with peach, apricot, and bananas.  T- Bananas are more prominent in the taste with the other fruits taking a back seat, more of a sweet apple flavor present as well. Alcohol is not noticeable at all. Spiciness is more evident in the nose.  M- Medium bodied, carbonation is very fine and releases more flavors, finishes sweet, but doesn't hang around too long.

This beer has great legs and it's surprising given that there just isn't any lacing.  Spicy, pear and hop aromas. Yeast, almost bread like (boring bread) in nature. Like most of these unibroue beers it is hard to get much aroma from it.  Spices dominate this beer, followed by dry yeast, and wheat flavors. There are some light citrus flavors trying to be heard from but the yeast and spices are just drowning them out.  Over carbonated in the mouth, but the body seems just right. A really refreshing beer given the 9% which just doesn't show up. I'm not a huge fan of this much carbonation, but it works just fine for this style.  I really don't like this style. I like this beer about as much as others I've had. I don't get it, I don't think I want to get it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Tons of beautiful creamy white head with only a modest amount of lacing on the glass. It's very fragrant and smells sweet with some fruitiness (peach? apricot?) and spice in the scent. Drinking it makes you feel warm. You get a lot of the spices (cloves?) along with a deliciously sweet maltiness. The fruit still plays a big part in the taste, and the warmth comes from the alcohol content which is definitely more present as you swallow the beer. The beer is super creamy in your mouth.

On the back there is an Enjoy By Date of: 11-17-13.  Appearance- Golden orange color, very cloudy (can't see fingers on other side of glass), 2 Fingers of HUGE bubbled head that dissipated quickly. Lacing was very thin and rings formed around head as well. Nice appearance!  Smell- Tons of banana and alcohol. There might also be a hint of clove or spice as well somewhere here.  Taste- Quick taste of heavy yeast and then bananas for sure. There is a bitterness that is also present which has a lemon type of contribution. Almost tastes like a Banana Ale.  Mouthfeel- Medium bodied, pricks the tongue with carbonation, but yet smooth! Goes down like candy.  Overall- First time writing an OVERALL (section of reviewing) a beer. I would say this bottle really sells by the appearance and then being one of the easiest beers to drink, this only makes you want another one! I will be buying by the 12oz instead of the bombers so I will know how many I've had in a night! Great!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

A: I am expecting a world class beer here and I get a slightly cloudy (perhaps this is my fault - I knocked the bottle off a three foot ledge earlier in the day). Regardless it is a straw yellow with hints of orange hue along with a fizzy white head that you hear buzzing away and disappearing post-haste leaving nary a dab of lacing. Very disappointing start.  S: Initial the beer is overwhelmed by a yeasty french bread sort of aroma. Fruty esters come through slowly delivering an enjoyable nose. Alcohol and a faint musky earth finish. Enjoyable, though a touch more muted at times than I would like  T: Belgian funk, best described by myself as the rind of a brie really plays well on the palate, though not too dominant as to overpower the rest of the body of the beer. Slight hints of bread and a light sweet finish on the beer keep the beer balanced. Nominal bitterness that grows over time in the finish helps cut the sweetness, though it is the sweetness that lingers. The sweet finish is strongly reminiscent of apple juice...  M: Slightly prickly, well balanced, could have been drier for the style.  O: A very enjoyable beer. Not as sensational as I recall it being, but having enough definitive character to keep me interested.

Smell: A smorgasboard of fruit flavors, massive esters, a very strong aroma.  Taste: Small hop flavor up front, very fruity - apples, pears. Light but complex.  Mouthfeel: Very carbonated, nice and airy.  Overall: Certainly an interesting beer/style. Not my favorite style, but still very good. Great looking bottle btw.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Green Apple mixed with Bananas.  Taste - Light and refreshing at first, then a big fruit taste, followed up with a mild hop finish. Slight Warming from the 9% ABV, but not offensively strong, just enough of a warming to let you know this is a Triple.  Mouthfeel - Creamy and Delicious, very smooth with a very nice fruity aftertaste.

Smell:Sweet smell that develops as it starts to warm, reminds me of unripe peaches.  Taste: Lots of flavour here, hops are upfront with a crisp green apple-like bite, but this comes with a matching sweetness keeping this beer well balenced. I like flavour in my beer but this beer maybe have a bit more than most standard beers people may be used to.  Mouthfeel: is smooth easy to drink but really a sipping beer for most people.

Poured to the trusty La Chouffe tulip.  For all the fine beers I've reviewed over the years, hard to believe I haven't written up this one before...  A: Glowingly golden but a little on the hazy side, even a fine dusting of hanging yeast (and that from the top 250ml of the bottle). Plenty of head, a 2-finger bounty of white froth, and cascading carbonation. Only fair head retention, though; a creamy ring and a little swirling after a couple minutes, with broken and non-sticking lace.  S: Vibrant doughy sweetness, lots of spice and sugary pear/apple. Honey and flowers, hardly a whiff of hops.  T: Upfront fruity notes: candied apples, sweet berries and spice... even a not-so-subtle clove/spice-filled 'bubble gum'. Concentrated 'ale on lees' yeast gives a biscuity flavor, honey-sweetened and there's an orange cream/blossom in the finish. It's a roiling cauldron of sugars, starches, and spice - always developing, always interesting.  M: Mouth-filling carbonation, active almost to a fault before gradually mellowing. Still, each sip send sparks flying for a few seconds before a stickier yeast envelopes every orifice of the mouth. Lip-smackingly malty.  O: Really a fine Tripel, among the better ones I've enjoyed... and a shame to have so often neglected this when it's so readily available... and nicely priced! A sipper at 9%. No real flaws, just a solid version of the style, start to finish.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

T The taste is quite crisp with hints of fruit especially apples what I think might have been grapes coming through. The alcohol is very well masked as it is relegated to a hint on the finish.  M Its a little heavy on the carbonation, but otherwise a very light refreshing beer.  Overall I thought that this is an excellent tripel.

M: Full bodied but not bitter. Alcohol is well balanced and warming throughout. Fully carbonated retaining fizz throughout.  O: A very fine beer overall. This one really stands up as a true Belgian.

Overall, the smell reminds of candied fruit especially banana and maybe apricot.  Taste: Sweet malts and I can taste the yeasts used to make it. The candied banana and apricot flavor make their presence known, which makes it sweet and slightly sugary. However, the finish tastes a little bit watered down but I don't know if that's only because of what to happened to the beer I was drinking or what.  Mouthfeel: A nice crispy feel with medium carbonation on the tongue.  Overall: I'm fairly happy with the La Fin Du Monde and is a pretty decent (cheap) alternative to the Tripel Karmeliet.

The color also has a light pink hue which is kind of a plus. With a light pour it produced about a quarter inch of head, which dissipated in about a minute.  S: Light Citrus notes. Not much going on here. It smells to me like a slightly more complex hefeweizen than the Blue Moon standard. I guess that makes it slightly above average in this category.  T: This is where this beer really shines. At first taste you will definitely taste the citrus and the coriander in the beer. The best part of the beer in the complex aftertaste which really can't be described easily. The first taste is the best because your taste buds haven't yet adapted to the flavors and the alcohol, which is noticable but not a dominant presence here.  M: When pouring the beer I noticed that it poured thicker than your average hefeweizen or pilsner, which tend to be watery. Well, there's no arguing it now. It has excellent mouth feel.

Wheat character fills out the malt profile nicely with softness and a bit of a bread note. Slight alcohol tinge on the backend with a faint shot of hops. This is really about the yeast  M - full bodied but more on the dry side with a nice texture.  D - good drinkability for me - but it does sneak up on ya!

The flavor is more impressive, with a combination of yeast, lemon, unripe pear, orange rind, and clove again, the overall impression is a wonderful dry, dull fruitiness combined with a characteristic Belgian-style yeast. The texture is creamy and delicate, but not in any way thin-bodied.

Smell: Belgian spices, clove, pepper, fruity smells of pears and peaches, and a hint of citrus peel.  Taste: the fruit from the aroma stands out with hints of spice and a bit of alcohol. There's a bit of a phenolic taste as well as some orange peel. Its sweet without being cloying and there are some yeast flavors in here too. Nothing here is over powering and it all works together nicely. Well balanced tripel.  Feel: medium bodied, nicely carbonation, hides the alcohol well.  Drink: easy drinking and you could have a few of these if it weren't 9% alcohol.  Overall, a pretty good tripel. I've yet to have a tripel that particularly impressed me but this one comes close. I can see why this is such a popular tripel. I would recommend giving it a try. Cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,evanlarkin,3.28,"Thanks to ngeunit1 for this.  Appearance: Pours a hazy yellow/orange color with about an inch of head that dissipates quickly, like a cola. Carbonation is easily visible.  Smell: yeasty and dry, but fruity. Very soft and mild smell with some amount of light fruits, like white grapes and a lot of pear. very smooth and champagne-y.  Taste: Again, soft. A lot of pear flavor and a bit of grape in the background. A bitterness similar to fruit peel.  Mouthfeel: Sharp carbonation and with a creamy feeling behind it.  Drinkability: I don't think I'd have more than one of these in a night, partially because of the ABV and partially because I'm not really into this. It's a decent belgian, but it just doesn't quite click with me. That being said, I can recognize it as a quality beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Brunite,4.17,A - Poured into a tulip glass. Beer is a hazy golden yellow with lots of active carbonation. A decent head gives way to a white collar with some light lacing.  S - Smells like champagne. Lots of white fruit....grapes....apple...banana....some pear. Lots of spicy and herbal notes as well.  T - Taste is like it smells. As it warms....things mellow out and the carbonation is minimized by each swirl.  M - Initial buzzing carbonation gives way to a medium body....almost some creaminess like you get with a swirled Quad each time you do so. Nice and dry on the finish with lingering sweetness and tartness at the same time. Crisp.  D- ABV is very well hidden. This goes down tasty and easy. A fine example of a Tripel and one that is reasonably priced and available....last I saw was 8.99 for a 4-pack.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,larsenju,4.12,"A-Nice pale yellow, a few specks but overall pretty clear. 2 finger brilliant white head that drops quickly leaving light lacing.  S-Very fruity initially with some pear and apricot along with just a little (not tart) apple. The fruit gets backed up by some caramel like malt sweetness and a little bit of clove. I also was getting some higher alcohols and mineral like yeast, especially as the beer warmed.  T-Sweet peach and pear hit right away quickly moving into some very nice phenolic spice that plays quite well with the alcohol heat. Moving back the esters picked up and I got some ripe banana along with a biscuit malt profile, I also got a little bit of raisin, and again a chalky yeast note that picked up on the finish leaving a nice blend of yeast and phenolic spice.  M-Very fine and moderately high carbonation coupled with a fairly dry body.  D-At $7 this is really a great buy. Pretty complex and well balanced, possibly a little hot, but it blends in quite nicely. Well done Canada.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,OldIronLungs,4.45,"Ending the 4-pack review with the original - one of the first beers that sold me on crafts. Poured into une verre du La Fin Du Monde with a moderate foam building up then quickly burning off on top of a perpetually fizzing hazy golden blob.  Smells of sweet malts, light cider and yeasts, oh and some of the 9%. Beautiful sweet, crispy, dry carbonation and a fresh peppery spice. Just such a neat balance of factors that make it a nice beer you can start strong (since it's clean and the abv is so well fit) and finish as a sipper since it's got that sweet flavor.  I think everyone should enjoy the end of the world.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Dmoore07,4.67,"A- Honey color. 5mm head.  S- Very sweet and inviting. Yeasty.  T- Very well balanced. Initially quite sweet, giving way to refreshing hop spice.

It might take a few!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,SHODriver,4.8,"A: Pale and cloudy yellow with an ample fluffy white head. This beer looks amazing S: Very sweet and grassy with some nice fruity notes. It smells great and you almost want to keep smelling it to find what else lurks inside. T: Peppery and spicy flavors mostly predominate to me. There is still an underlying sweetness and a bit of breadyness. A sweet and fruity aftertaste is left behind. M: Champagne like effervescence leaves this one feeling a tad on the thin side but there's still plenty of body. D: Delightfully drinkable and it will be a pleasure to drink the 750 of this monster from the North.  Overall: A fine example of a Trippel from one of my favorite breweries. A word to those that have yet to experience Unibroue in quantities would be that their beers sneak up on you.

22,34,CuttDeez,4.44,I went into this beer knowing that it would be complex and I made an effort to slow down and enjoy this one. Take time to think about each sip.  A - Yellow gold. It is cloudy with a nice white head on the cup. It really is golden and inviting.  S - I can't get enough of the smell. So sweet and floral. Distinct clove and a hint of cinnamon. It smells sugary and that brings in the notes of fruit in the back end of the nose.  T & M & D - The first thing I was struck by was the sweetness on the front end. Then the malt filled the palate. There was a fizz that filled my mouth and opened up to peppery notes. I also agree with most reviews that the only indication of the abv content is the slight warming sensation on the back end. I really enjoyed just sitting and enjoying every sip of this beer. I enjoyed all aspects (appearance and smell) before taking a sip and I urge you to do the same.  Cheers,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Some sediment present and the lacing was fair.  Smell: Loads to discover; orange mixed with clove is up front with some pears. There's some pepper and heavy yeast that is bready. Hard candy, vanilla -- very complex.  Taste: Spicy, orange, clove lead to an alcohol warmth with a hit of pepper. Finish is sweet and slightly bitter, very long. Nice balance and incredibly complex; you discover different flavors with each sip.  This is a beer you take to a wine party and convert some folks with.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,DovaliHops,4.5,"Love this beer! Finally reviewing it. Pours a very murky golden straw color with a big white head that slowly diminishes. Scent is nice and SPICY! Tons of spices and a good amount of pepper with some yeasty notes. I also pick up some hoppiness and white grapes. Taste is OUTSTANDING, as usual. This beer is so complex and full of flavor, it's ridiculous. I get delicious yeast flavors with some fresh bread. Tons of fruit: apples, bananas, white grapes, melon, and a hint of orange. There are some tasty peppery spices along with clove and some bitter hops. Mouthfeel is very crisp and dry. Very complex and full-bodied. Drinkability is very high considering ABV is well hidden.

Cloves/banana,fruit (apple), bitterness of hops, sweet malts, oranges. Very complex and exceptional. I could keep coming back to this. Plus the alcohol does hit you like a ton of bricks.

In the taste, dry candy sugar, a nice fruitiness, and a small yeast presence, but very clean. A small bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry candy sugar in the aftertaste. Hides the alcohol, and feels lighter. nice mix of fruit notes to dry yeastiness.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,zeledonia,4.53,"From notes, tasted December 2010.  Pours a golden straw yellow, cloudy, with an irrepressible head that I had to wait to die down to pour the full glass. Head slowly withdraws to one finger (where it stays), but the strings of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass persist. Smell is sweet, like champagne, citrus, or apple juice and honey, and powerfully yeasty, but a lovely combination that's quite different from most beers. Taste is delicious, again fairly sweet, but complex. Hard to describe - a lovely light combination of peppery, sweet, citrus, and mild hops. The high carbonation, which is surprisingly not disruptive, does a really interesting thing - it bounces the flavors around, making them come in bubbly waves. It's a really odd sensation, like the bubbles are alternately masking, carrying away, and returning different flavors. Mouthfeel is nice, but rather light for a tripel, and carbonated as much as it could be without being too much. Alcohol kick is absent, despite it being 9%! All in all a delicious and very enjoyable drink; a fantastic combination of taste and tactile sensation.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

A: hazy corn kernel appearance with limited head (this time, unusual). the surface remains scattered with fine white foam on the edges and rimming the edge. Little lacing.  S: Lots of banana, clove, cardamom, coriander. All spice and fruity esters. Light grain in the nose.  T: All the spice crosses through and offers more of the same. Banana more evident on the finish here. Finish also offers the peppercorns to show a bit. Some corn as well.  M: Light for the style, but lively carbonation. Leaves the mouth slick. Decent.  D: Drinkable, but not the best in show IMO.

Belgiany, with a bit of dark fruit (despite the light color), and mild citrus... of the EXTREMELY over-ripe kind.  T: Tons of spices: Coriander for starters... honey, tons of malt, and that certain bit of Unibroue funkiness that only the brewers and God can describe!  M: Creamy for a Tripel, yet still very champagne-like in its carbonation. Sure, I could taste the alcohol, but I could detect the yummy spices even more! The lacing left on the glass was moderate.

Smell- To me it was the standard tripel smells of a nice earthy yeasty with some crisp minimal citrus notes.  Taste- Has to be one of the classics. It was crisp and clean with that up front yeasty flavor with a grainy, wheaty citrus finish.  Mouth- Has a smooth aftertaste. The ABV is evident on the finish. A medium body with a higher carbonation to it.  Drink- Gone before I knew it. Sneaky good. A 12oz bottle is just not enough. A very good beer that could be enjoyed over a couple bottles.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,confer,4.33,I had this bottle in my basement for a while. There was about a year left until the date that was stamped on the side. The color was gold and hazy with a small amount of sediment. The carbonation was constantly racing to the top which kept a frothy cap hanging around. The main aroma I get is oranges. The flavor is hard for me to describe except that it is deep and sweet with a faint alcohol burn at the end. The 9% is fairly well hidden. This is a great sipper and it really gets a lot tastier as it warms. The last swallow which included the sediment was the sweetest and tastiest of all.. I think I will pick up a few more bottles and start the cellaring again.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JMad,4.28,"I had a 12 oz bottle, or it may have been an 11.3 oz bottle, and I poured it into my tulip glass...  The liquid was murky, golden-yellow with a pillowy, towering, white head. It smells like a bouquet of fruits, I noticed lemon, banana, orange, peach, and spices. When I took a sip I did notice some alcohol on the back of the tongue. The taste was dominated by lemon and wheat, it was a bit sour and has hints of clove. This is a full bodied beer, the soft carbonation lightens it up creating a pleasing experience. I am not big on triples or wheat beers, but this one is on another level, the alcohol is hidden extremely well and I would love to have it again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Very light and pleasant though... The taste has a little more oomph to it. It's a pretty sweet beer, but good. Not much alcohol taste, and at 9% ABV, that's impressive. I'd actually like to taste a little alcohol burn with this one. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Nice fruity, light aftertaste. Drinkability is pretty high. I could drink several of these before the alcohol would catch up, it doesn't taste like a high ABV beer. Overall, this is a good beer that borders on great.

Very nice looking...Like Sophie Marceau (yea, yea I know she's not Quebecoise...get over it)...Elegant, beautiful and timeless...  Aromas are chock full of good stuff...I get sweet malt and Belgian yeastiness right away - very robust. Some coriander...Some fresher notes, too, like lemonade way in the back. Nice and balanced...This is looking like a World class ale so far...  Flavor is luscious, like Sophie's very feminine body...The head and body of this beer are creamy and flavorful...Carbonation swells up initially, but there is a fine malty creamy texture to it that is a pleasure to feel. This gives way to an early middle that starts off tangy, and then immediately moves into a warm series of flavors: nice malt component balanced very nicely by the yeast...they meld in perfect harmony. This is a less spicy version of a Belgian ale...But something about it is more subtle and nuanced. The malt and yeast dance around a little, until they finally give way to a slightly hoppy and understated bitterness that lingers for a good long time. Excellent beer. It's around $9/4-pak, so it ain't cheap or expensive. ABV is awesome at 9% and completely and totally masked. This is wonderful and drinkable to a fault. Many people would get very hammered off this ale. It's excellent on all fronts and hardly any fault to it. Must find and drink. Perfect any time of year, also...  What I like most: The beautiful, nuanced flavor profile, beautiful appearance, wonderful nose...pretty much everything.  What I like least: the price, and just barely a fault here.

CANNOT believe I haven't formally reviewed thi sbrew yet. I've enjoyed this offering from Unibrew for many years now.  Poured into my Chimay chalice - stirred yeast and all. The audibly fizzy bright white head starts loose and lumpy, then settles to a thin-edged perimeter with a convex mound in the center. The dirty orange colored brew is alive with carbonation. Fine and boisterous bubble action is making me salivate. Drooping lines and splotches of lace sporadically present.  Such a succulent and yeasty smelling ale. Tons of creme fresh notes. Mostly sweet, with just a touch of yeasty-tart tinge. A fresh bouquet of vanilla and fresh sourdough bread is prevalent. Reminds me of vanilla (batter & frosting) birthday cake. Upon smelling this for a few minutes, I do feel like it's my special day.  Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm. And Mmmm. The scent purely and accurately translates into the flavor. A hint of white pepper from the belgian yeast cloaks any discernible alcohol notes. The yeasty sourness is restrained enough to not take center stage, but does provide a perfect balance to this luscious, sweet elixir. Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with the perfect amount of ultra fine and tongue tingling carbonation. It coats and penetrates all surfaces and crevices in the mouth, giving life to everything it touches. The finish is slightly spicy and a tad dry.  Drinkability is PERFECT. The 9% ABV is very deceiving and could prove weighty if over indulged. Good thing I'm nursing this 12 oz. bottle.  Canada does Belgium proud with their masterful rendition of a Triple. I prefer this to many Belgian offering, as a matter of fact. The softness. The sweet warmth. The marvel.

Buttery and caramel-like malts (a little sweet in nature) form a base upon more zesty spices (coriander, pepper) and citrus fruits. despite this, the tastes meld pretty well together. Alcohol warmth hits pretty quick towards the back end of the tasting, yet the overall presence of alcohol is pretty well-hidden. Mouthfeel: Fairly full-bodied, but smooth; finishes a little on the dry side. Drinkability: ABV will inevitably limit consumption though it would be easy to drink one too many if allowed.

Not a whole lot of lacing with mostly soapy looking foam. Smells like a strong wheat beer with notes of carapils, not sure if they use carapils with this or not because I know very little about belgian beers.

22,34,Smakawhat,4.19,"Been awhile since I had one of these, would love to see if it still measures up since then. Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass.  A real nice looking white head, a bit soapy, but holds with lots of retention. There is a lot of rising carbonation on this with the classic slow rising carbonation crawling up. Body color is a bit hazy with a sort of dull apricot orange and yellow. Fairly decent tripel appearance.  Nose is a mellow sweetness, mixing with a sense of light honey. There's a sense of crisp coming off this, but there's not much sense of Belgian candi sugar or doughy like malts compared to other tripels. There is some sweet like malts that peek out just a tad. It's otherwise pretty solid and enjoyable and balanced. Smells very clean and carbonated.  Palate hits with a lot of carbonation, but manages to stay in control. Finish has a little bit of sweet banana, but then some classic Belgian like candi comes out. Carbonation on this is very high, and it even brings some tonic water and herbal like qualities to the beer. Sweetness doesn't get too out of control, and coats well in the palate.  Overall it's a solid tripel, but I think I would grab other favorites in this style instead. Nice to go back and review this one.  Old review (Feb 26th 2011) ---  Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass.  A straight forward soapy clean white head of two fingers, falls fairly straight but not too fast. Body shows a nice carbonation from the bottom through a somewhat 50/50 opaque eight carat gold body. Not much of a collar left on the glass after the head falls but it manages to stay.  Bouquet is a slight musty barnyard smell with yeast. Buttery lemon sweetness also, and some sourdough bread. Dental almost toothpaste medicinal in the back on the nose also. Lots to find here, all clean, and all very enjoyable.  Great body upon taste with a bold lemon and honey. Mouth finish is a slight club soda but tolerable. Chew texture and highly teeth coating, faint bread like wheat also on the aftertaste.  Inexpensive to boot and makes for great drinkability.

22,34,SnowGoon99,4.25,"Serving type: bottle into a Stella Artois glass.  Pours a dark yellow, straw color. Not a thick head but one that stays down the glass for some nice lacing. Only thing that dings it is actually probably my fault in pouring the lees into the glass by accident. So i didn't get the full effect. Aroma is killer with some Belgian esters standing out. Nice fruity aromas with some sweet type aromas.  Flavors are kinda all over the place. On one hand there's some nice malt sweetness with some fruitiness. But on the other there's some hot alcohol which i guess can be expected with a high alcohol beer with Belgian yeast. That's the only ding i have in flavor. It's also kinda weird in the mouthfeel in that you can tell it has a lot of body but it's cut by the carbonation. But this also could be a characteristic of the style. Still makes for a very drinkable beer.  Overall a really nice beer. It's not one you could have a bunch of and survive a night.

Smell is very orangey and apricot like with some candy sweetness and a light clove like spice to it.  Taste is more or less the same but the accentuation is more on the apricot and candied sugar notes. Also the spiciness becomes a little closer to cinnamon.  Medium bodied with a somewhat creamy mouthfeel and quite a bit of carbonation somewhere between prickly and foamy. Lasting sweet finish as well as a solid bitter footnote in the middle.  This beer is very drinkable despite it being a very big beer.  La fin du monde is an amazing beer from an excellent brewery. I also enjoyed trois pistoles and maudite.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,beerlove82,4.94,"A: Mildly cloudy brew with an amber appearance and a off-white head that lingers for about 5 minutes to a nice lace for the remainder of the glass.  S: Talking complex! Spices, yeast, hint of wheat, hint of alcohol, note of honey. Delicious!!  T: Flavor that doesn't stop! Alcohol is masked extremely well for 9%, Notes of cloves, yeast, caramel, wheat, honey, mild hops. Maybe a slight nutty sorta cinnamon note in the aftertaste.  M: heavy complex body, tart dry aftertaste, sweet start, perfect carbonation.  D: Very easy to drink, especially with a steak meal or seafood. high alcohol with a low alcohol taste that will get yo in trouble after a few. (I'm starting to feel a buzz already) Love this one! Recommend it to all at least once.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BirdsandHops,4.85,"A: Pours a hazy golden yellow, cloudy from the yeast (I prefer to add the yeast). Head retention is very good, starting out with nearly two fingers of head and retaining fairly thick white cap throughout the entire beer. Good lacing as well.  S: There's a lot going on here, but it all blends very well together to create an amazing nose. Coriander and Belgian spices up front followed by sweet fruit aromas--white grapes, pears, and bananas. Backing it all up is the Belgian yeasty aroma.  T: Similar to the aroma, there's a lot going on. Spices up first followed by sweet pears and white grapes. The finish has a chalky yeast flavor that pleasantly lingers in the mouth along with a very light alcohol burn.  M: To me, the mouthfeel in a Belgian beer is very important. There should be a light crispness to it that conceals its high gravity nature. Many attempts at Belgian beers fail to get this characteristic, but this beer nails it head-on. Light body, but with high carbonation that really provides a bite to go with the sweet fruit and yeast flavors.  D: With such a great taste and mouthfeel, this beer is dangerously drinkable. Very light and crisp yet bursting with flavor. With the alcohol hidden well, it becomes very refreshing.  Overall, this is close to, if not the best trippel out there. Very, very good beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

It quickly goes in to a really nice long matching after-taste. The after-taste seems to be more potent than the rest of the taste. This is a really balanced and clean example of the style. its really refreshing!  M-a good medium to heavy carbonation with a very crisp finish.  D-wow...this is dangerously drinkable.

I was very excited to try it after reading all of the reviews on BA, but I found myself disappointed. I have reviewed and re-reviewed it since then. While I can understand why someone would enjoy it, this beer is simply not for me. It's too tart, too acidic, and the yeast funk is too overpowering.

22,34,joelshults,3.8,"Appearance - Pale yellow and a little cloudy. Small off-white head. A nice hiss of carbonation when I opened the bottle.  Smell - Different. I'm not too familiar with the Belgian style beers; I've had a few, but not enough to really know what they are all about. The smell is sort of fruity, malty, and yeasty but also has a sort of spicy funk to it. A little hint of phenolic medicinal smell.  Taste - The taste really matches the smell of this one. Sort of a fruity and malty taste with a heavy taste of yeast and peppery spicyness. Slight alcohol burn from the 9% ABV. It has a nice hop balance that is just shy of balancing the malt but lets the other flavors come through.  Mouthfeel - It has a good heavy body that hangs around in your mouth. It has a little bit of a tongue numbing effect after you've had a few healthy swallows.  Drinkability - Very nice. Definitely a sipper and not a gulper. When doing one of these tastings for BeerAdvocate, I tend to take very frequent sniffs and sips while I am writing. This one has already gone to my head before I can even finish typing the review and I still have half of the glass left.  I remember buying one of these once when I was traveling on business, before I started home brewing and really getting to know craft beers. I didn't remember much about it's flavor other than that I thought it was very strange and not something I'd want to drink much of. Now I can appreciate a lot more of the style and unique flavors these Belgians have.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ThaCreep,4.32,"Color slightly veiled, like a wheat beer but darker and supported. Bouquet of Fruits, which are identified fairly exotic mango and pineapple and honey. The mouth is a bit hoppy, with fruity notes already mentioned above but you will also savor the spices, including cilantro. Quite drinkable but with a rather peculiar aftertaste, both bitter and very malty, giving it substantial power. It recalls both the Belgian Tripel Dubbelwit that it is probably the best compromise.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Morey,3.95,"Pours a golden-yellow color with a one finger white head. Pretty significant amount of carbonation bubbles rushing up towards the surface. Decent head retention.  Smells of clove, banana, and rock candy come to mind.  More of the same in the taste. Extremely fruity and fairly sweet. The flavors change as this beer lingers on your palate. Pretty complex flavor profile. There is a drying effect in the finish.  Medium body with a pretty high carbonation level. Almost too high for my taste. I know that Belgians often have bigger carbonation, but this was a bit overdone.  I am fully enjoying sipping on this beer.  Morey's Bottom Line: Pretty good example of the style. I'm certainly not the ""be all...end all"" on this particular style, while I definitely enjoyed this beer, I wasn't completely blown away by it either.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,dgilks,4,Hazy golden colour with a big fluffy white head.  Spicy and citrussy with lots of clove from that great Unibroue yeast. Notes of orange and apple. Very enjoyable.  As in the aroma. This is always an impressive beer. Whether this is fresh or aged is somewhat irrelevant the quality shines with the main difference being some increased smoothness with age.

This is joined by a spicy tone, reminiscent of cloves.  Taste- Very complex. I get fruit in the taste, but different ones. I sense dried fruit like prune and raisin, as well as the banana and citrus peel. Yeast in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel- crisp, light, the high amount of carbonation makes it dance on the tongue.  Drinkability- extremely drinkable for 9.0 abv. Doesn't do a harsh number on the taste buds and is smooth from beginning to end.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Smell: Warm, relaxing, makes you feel that instead of wafting the bottle or glass underneath your nose a few passes, you would stop it and push your face in and inhale deeply.  Taste: It's fair to say this beer gives quickies to all your tastebuds as it gently slithers down. The aftertaste is present for a great deal of time, allowing to savor each part of the taste (fruity, spices, hops) individually.  Mouthfeel: Sharp, not tangy-like but cold refreshing sharp. This isn't to say it is the same as drinking ice water while chewing mint gum but it is crisp, and makes its presence known immediately after flowing past the lips.  Drinkability: As said above and below, this beer is dangerous.

Citrusy hop bitterness holds back a lot of sweetness. Some very slight tart favors and bitter sours in the backround but blend into a yeasty finish.  mouthfeel; very fine carbonation and cream, somehow I get visions of a sauce that is not quite at ""Nappé"" consistancy. Loose and slick on the way down. A bit sticky on the palate and numbing to the tip of the tongue and back of lips.  drinkability; really complex but light and smooth.

Served in a Great Divide balloon glass with the yeast from the 12 oz. bottle poured into it... just like they suggest on the youtube videos.  The beer pours an opaque yellow with orange flair. The head is initially fluffy and invitingly white... but it dies down a bit too fast. A better looking beer than some, but not breathtaking.  The nose is spicy and fruity. The fruits remind me of pears and apples. The spices have Belgian and peppery kicks. There's also an extra sweetness there. Overall, it's a wonderfully nice nose.  The taste is right along the lines of the nose. The fruit is sharper because of the wonderful carbonation. The beer is also appropriately thick to deliver each and every flavor. The mix of spice and fruits blend together wonderfully well to keep me interested, but it's welcoming enough to draw in a new beer drinker (I've used it on newbies before).

The taste is the best kind of fruity: like some kind of hand soap or chapstick you wish was the frosting on your cupcake (see: Pre de Provence Agrumes soap: Grapefruit laden with sugar.).

Smell: Combinations of citrus, banana, vanilla and clove/cinnamon like flavors that are mild but noticeable.

Definitely an acquired taste, my first bottle was about as enjoyable as chewing broken glass. Tried again a week later, not unpleasant, but not something I enjoyed. Tried it again today, was rather enjoyable. This beer seriously benefits from multiple tastings.  M: Very thin, and watery at first, but becomes almost jelly-like when it warms up in your mouth.

Pours an opaque, golden orange, with three fingers of frothy white head, which leaves a modicum of sticky lacing around the glass as it dissipates.  While it doesn't look particularly novel, it does appear quite refreshing and appealing.  Smells fruity -- apples, pears, lemons, oranges, white grapes, etc. -- and a bit sweet, though the backend is balanced by the bready yeast expected of the style. The alcohol is there, too, though it took awhile to discern. Again, the nose is great, but not unusual.  Tastes awfully similar, with the addition of spices, and finishes a bit dry with the predominant flavor of Belgian yeast; the fruity notes linger substantially, as well. Well-balanced, not too sweet, crisp, and clean. The alcohol is barely perceptible, but makes itself known as the glass progresses.  Lots of exhuberant carbonation and a medium body make this beer very refreshing.  La Fin Du Monde is an excellent Belgian-style pale, though no aspect of it is necessarily unique, save for its refined eleagance. It's a pleasure to sip and, I would surmise, be perfect on a hot summer's day.  Unfortunately, it's freezing outside right now, but the 9% is quickly making itself evident and it's certainly feeling warmer in here.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,OldGrowler,3.91,"A pungent, interesting and complex beer, but I'm not sure all the flavours match. I spent half an hour trying to pinpoint that delightful, mysterious peppery slightly sweet/slightly floral aroma from memory, then remembered my mom's Biryani recipe ... which uses lots of ... CARDAMOM spice! The aroma translates to the taste too ... definitely CARDAMOMmy. Sadly, a pine-needle, junipery-aroma overpowers the delicate cardamom.  Taste is predominantly citrus, but there's an overpowered peach too ... again, sadly. GOOD but not that drinkable really --rather a very sharp, strong, spicy beer that you have to be in the mood for. In an excellent value 750ml bottle, best for sharing. Personally I don't care for the slight meaty/gym-sock pungency and the sour aftertaste.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied; lots of tingly carbonation; and a pleasant cleansing from the alcohol. Feels good...  Drinkability: Stays interesting in flavor for the whole drink.

A: Beer pours a kind of peachy color with a very light colored two finger head that subsided in about 5 minutes. Some yeast crept into the glass which clouded the beer a little, but some good bubbling is still visible.  S: Aroma is most decidedly fruity and estery. I got a little banana and clove notes, as well as some biscuity malts. Smell is more in your face than other tripels.  T: Good grief these Canadians at Unibroue have done it right! A perfect mix of breadiness, esters from the yeast, and floral/herbal hops. There is some pepper-like spiciness and a noticeable but not overwhelming dose of alcohol.  M: Feels very bubbly in the mouth as the carbonation carries those wonderful flavors. It's a little creamy as well. Finish is very drying.  D: Should a tripel go down this easy? Easy to finish a 750 in a night. Dangerously drinkable. The 9.0% ABV does creep up on you, however.  O: In my honest and humble opinion, the best tripel in the world, even better than Westmalle.

Poured, as usual, into a Duvel tulip.  A - Hazy, burnt orange. A flat-topped 2-finger foam head forms and is retained very well, leaving nice, if somewhat spotty, lacing behind.  S - Citrus, baked bread, and slightly funky yeast, none of it overpowering.  T - Everything present in the nose is present here, but a touch more refined. Generic citrus becomes mild grapefruit and tangerine, the baked bread is now a piping hot wheat loaf, etc. Also there is a hint of cloves and black pepper, presumably from the yeast.  M and D - Creamy, medium body with consistent carbonation and a dry, slightly hot finish due to the otherwise-masked ABV. Very easy to drink.  This is a go-to, readily available beer, and I really like it, but I don't love it.

22,34,nataku00,4.4,"A beer that helped push me into craft beer, but I've never reviewed it since I've been trying all these new beers instead. A two year old bottle that was sitting at the back of my beer shelf, poured into a tulip glass. Unibroue recommends that you include some of the yeast in the pour, so I swirled the bottle with the last third of the beer to pick up some of the yeast caked at the bottom. Beer is a hazy dark orange that you can barely see any shadows through it. Initial finger of snow white soapy head dissipates within minutes, leaving minimal lacing. Lots of small bubble carbonation slowly ascends from the bottom of the glass, which bodes well for the mouthfeel as it doesn't look too aggressive.  Nose is spicey, cloves, coriander and pepper, with sweetness from biscuit malts, banana and orange fruitiness.  Spices follow through on the tongue, blending well with the biscuit malts, banana and sweet citrus. After two years, I don't get any alcohol presence on this beer, which further helps make it balanced and enjoyable. Finishes with a slight sweetness and a bit of floral hops.  As expected, just enough carbonation to round out the medium bodied beer and sweep your tongue clean. Very gentle carbonation that tickles your tongue.  Decently drinkable tripel style beer, that doesn't finish as dry as some of its Belgian inspirations. Still an excellent beer, a beer that I've used to entice non craft beer drinkers into trying a well made beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,diabecktic,4.73,"Appearance: The head of this beer is absolutely beautiful. It's a thick, creamy texture with lots of air bubbles. Retention is good, as ~3 fingers of head slowly dissipates to yield a thin rim which laces quite well. This golden, straw-colored beer is quite cloudy on account of the plethora of yeast.  Smell: As one would expect with this style, the aroma is dominated by notes of yeast. Light, fruity notes compliment a spiciness that is marked by cloves and pepper. Though very strong, it's not overpowering.  Taste: The complexity of the aroma is also present in the palate. A sugary malt which features apricot is apparent up front, while clove, pepper, and yeast notes balance the sweetness towards the end of the tasting. Hoppiness is minimal, but the complexity, expansion, and balance of flavors is exceptional.  Mouthfeel: I find the body to be fairly thick - likely on account of the heavy, sweet malt. Yeast and spices tingle the tongue and the aftertaste is quite pleasant.  Drinkability: Some might the thickness offensive, but I don't find that this hurts drinkability because you have to consider that this style will feature beers with both high alcohol content and density. For a beer with 9% ABV, it's extremely easy to drink because the alcohol is well-hidden. This beer is meant to be sipped - with good reason.  Summary: I can appreciate that certain people might find this style to be too ""strong"" for their liking, but this is truly a world-class beer. The craftsmanship required to brew something with such complexity is astounding; the diverse assortment of flavors is balanced, but each is still distinct upon tasting. I don't get a chance to try Tripels or Belgian Ales too often, so I relish the opportunity to enjoy these beers when I can. My only gripe is that hoppiness seems to be a bit restrained, but I would probably attribute this to the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

This is going to be quite positive as this is one of my favorite beers.  My favorite La Fin story occurred one night in Boston at Gas Light. (Nice place) I was with 4 total couples (including me and my wife) Nobody else was a beer geek and they were mostly planning on drinking wine. For our first round I got a bottle of La Fin and everyone kept asking about the beer. After everyone samples the beer 4 of the other 7 people switched to drinking this for the night. I'd hate to admit how much we spent just on this beer that night.  Poured into my Smuttynose tulip glass and a finger of spritzy white head forms atop a slightly hazy golden/brass colored beer. A slight dull sheen to the beer. Some active carbonation rises.  The aroma is always wonderful. Full of yeast notes. I always think of hay, grass, vanilla and a touch of clove. Some fruit notes as well.  The flavor is just stupendous and I love exploring the complexity. Candied sugar, pale malt, white pepper, yeast notes, lots of spice. I always think ripe pear when I drink this along with some white grape. Still a finish of vanilla for me. Very smooth. While the abv is hidden, there is sense of what's going on. You just feel happy.  While it feels light in your mouth, the actual body is a touch heavier than it lets on. Carbonation provides a kick but remains a background player.  I love drinking this beer.

Light, crisp and bright but full of flavor. Lemon, apple, and pear sweetness along with some spice in the finish -- Not clove-y but similar. though cleaner. A clean bit of bitterness at the finish just to crisp up the palate. Certainly one of the 2 or 3 best Belgians brewed outside of Belgium that I have tasted.

Mouthfeel: Nice dry finish coupled with almost prickly carbonation really make this a nice memorable beer.  Drinkability: Being 9% ABV, you could have a few of these but not too many. The taste is so good you could rink many but your head might not thank you in the morning. I am glad our sad state does get Unibroue, and this one is an excellent example of a Tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,stoepsel,4.02,The end of the world is near... ...and it smells like cherry. Its' color is something between orange and yellow and it is covered with a shallow cap of dense foam. Taste is relatively light and dry with a champagne-like mouthfeel which successfully cloaks the apocalyptic 9% of alcohol. The finish is dry and yeasty with a slighlty lagging bitterness. Rock-solid art of brewing!,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mweso2000,4.94,"Appearance-Pours with huge lacy white head. Unfortunately I do not have a tulip glass so I had to pour into a standard pint glass. Hazy golden yellow color. Head quickly dissipates and does not cling to glass.  Smells of yeast, fruit, cloves and spices.  Taste-Very sweet taste in the beginning with fruit, cloves and bready flavor. Slight citrus taste. Finishes with a nice bitterness to balance out the sweetness. Beer improved with time. Do not serve overly chilled. Flavors really come out as beer warms up.  Mouthfeel- Very crisp and refreshing. Nice dry feeling in the mouth. Not overly carbonated, nice and smooth.  Drinkability-Extremely drinkable! 9% abv is well hidden so watch out!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,KAP1356,4.35,"A 750 ml. bottle, with a Best By 1/12/13 marking, poured into a Duvel tulip...  A - Really nice ever-so-slightly hazy golden-orange color with a HUGE 3 finger fluffy white head. An incredible amount of carbonation is visible in this one. Bubbles are flying all over the place at an incredibly quick pace.  S - Yeasty with a nice aroma of clove out front. Citrusy and floral as well. There some other fruits there as well; some pear and green apple. Some slight spice and peppery notes as well.  T - Sweet tasting with floral and fruity flavors coming out. The pear and green apple make themselves known as do the cloves. Slightly more bready than I thought it would be. A little bit of pepper and citrus round things out nicely. Slight hop bitterness and belgian yeast mix nicely with the sweetness. Ends with a nice buttery finish.  M - Smooth and creamy with a slightly carbonated bite at the end (much less than I expected based on the appearance ofthe beer). Medium bodied with a nice dry estery finish.  D - Quite drinkable even with the ABV, although it does start to catch up with you after a bit. One bomber was enough for me, but was quite an enjoyable beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,cb102348,3.46,"This beer smells like dirty locker room socks after a hard day on the gridiron...but delivers in the end when it counts.  A - Pours nicely with two finger head and settles well.  S - As metioned before, in our experience, this beer smells like Bigfoot's dick - maybe we got a bad bottle, but it was enough to turn off even the most experienced beer drinker. Grassy notes, pear, some clove(?). Overall was not pleasant.  T - Taste was satisfying. Compared to the smell, this beer delivered. Really can taste the pear and other earthy/fruit notes.  M - Light and crisp - well carbonated but not overpowering to the point that it ruined the beer. Still able to get the flavors.  D - Maybe had a bad bottle, but don't let the smell deter you from enjoying this beer. Goes down smooth with little effect from the alcohol content. Flavors in the beer really come out after it warms up a few degrees.

A beautiful cloudy orange color and you cannot see anything through it thanks to the wonderful bottle conditioning.  S: Peach, pineapple, pear, clove/coriander, belgian yeast  M: Well carbonated and surprisingly creamy  T: Exactly like the smell. Tons of ripe fruit. I get mostly peach and pineapple with a good amount of spice (coriander?). It is extremely smooth and not in the least bit bitter.  D: Dangerously drinkable.  A world class beer and definitely the best tripel I have ever tasted. I have had many Unibroue beers, but this one stands out!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,SKMO,4.67,"I am not big into reviews as I do not feel qualified but this brew kicked my arse in every respect and brought tears to my eyes.  Upon opening the bottle and inhaling the aroma I was salivating like Pavlov's Dog. It smelled luscious. And it tasted as good or better.  Everyone else here has described the nuances of the taste/aroma. I can't begin to tear this beer apart taste-wise other than to say it hit all my sensory g-spots. I had a beergasm.  Let's just say it is one of the best beers I have ever experienced. It is delicious, not a word often used to describe beer. I also appreciate the high ABV which hides itself perfectly.  Perfect beer Karma in my opinion.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S: Clove and spices, very similar to a hefeweizen without the banana. T: The spiciness of the nose comes through in the taste with a hint of alcohol. This beer masks its 9% abv very well but you can tell that it is there.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,haazer,4.2,"Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice.  A- Pours a little more than a finger of white head. The brew is an orange marmelade color, with apple core highlights on the sides. Fairly opaque liquid, with a good amount of bubbles rising in the glass. Personally I think this might've looked better in a tulip.  S- Great combination of yeast/fruit aroma's. Picked out mainly Berries, apples, and grapes.  T- Excellent, very complex tastes, as most Tripels have. Hard to pick out the distinct flavors so I'll speak in generalities. Tastes include fruit and candy, but is not at all overly sweet. Can pick up on the malt taste in the background, and the alchohol is masked fairly well.  M- Smooth but bubbly mouthfeel from the carbonation. On the lighter end of a medium bodied beer. Alcohol is slightly warming, but welcomed especially at this time of year.  D- A sipper, and thats not to take away from its drinkability. A sipper to savor the great taste and complexity. I can see why this is so highly rated. A plus is that this is very easy to find, and its actually a quite cheaper then most other Tripel's out there.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The head dissipates fairly quickly. Mouthfeel is very nice and smooth and very drinkable for the abv. I've exposed many a Blue Moon honk to this wonderful beer, I say that because that's what most tell me when I have them taste La Fin Du Monde. No orange needed, the wonderful all natural citrus taste comes standard.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,DesMoinesMike,4.82,"Congrats to our northern neighbors for creating this amazing brew that I now have on my favorites list.  It's a dark golden color with a boat load of white foamy head that doesn't die easily. It's rather cloudy, and this one had a few chunks of dark sediment that my first one didn't. The aroma is mostly fruit with a bit of wheat. The flavor just blew me away. A bit of wheat, then lemon, orange, cloves, spices. A rather complex mix that are strong and plentiful. It knocks your taste buds out and makes you ask for seconds. It finishes just a tad tart but still sweet.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Arkofsax,4.35,"A- Beautiful golden orange coloring with a huge head (I prefer to pour a little extra head and then let my beers sit for a minute so that the temperature can balance while there's still some head left)  S- Smells like an odd balance between a spicy scent and the distinct maltiness of the style.  T- Incredible! The malts give it a very interesting flavor. I would almost describe it as being vaguely nutty compared to other takes on it.  m- If my taste buds were ever stressed, then this beer would be their masseuse. The malts provide a wonderful soothing effect as it's held in the mouth.  D- While delicious, finishing one of these with a meal would be the most I could ask anyone.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,HopJ,4.77,"Time to actually review one of my favorite beers. What can be said. An incredibly complex beer that is priced well and can always be found. The mouthfeel is full with nice acidity to keep it alive. Bold dry malt right in the middle. Just a hint of the alcohol but this is so drinkable and refreshing, it could be dangerous.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,turnerr79,4.13,"La Fin du Monde, aka End of the world.  Full foamy head, a good two fingers.  Beer pours a summer yellow, slight cloudiness.  Sweet malty nose, with a hoppy complement.  First sip is sweet and definitely on the malty side. Not cheap malt liquor malty, but European ale malty, a bit lager-ish.  Wheat in the mash shines through. Gives my palate images of fall harvest on the farm. Med heavy mouth feel, but the carbonation balances that out.  9% abv, but there is not a sharp taste. Good after taste that keeps the wheat theme on the forefront.  Great comfort beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,KickInTheChalice,4.35,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip.  Appearance: Bright like an orange sunrise, Fin du Monde is slightly cloudy from a bunch of Belgian yeast just waiting to impress me. A calm white head forms upon pouring but fades rather quickly and does not leave any lacing.  Smell: The spicy Belgian yeast pops out of the glass and into the nose. Pepper, cloves, green apple skin, soft pear, and sweet sugary bread all make themselves present.  Taste: Sweet, especially up front. The first taste is of spice and candy, with the apple, pear, and more complex flavors stepping in a bit later. The flavor is a bit tame compared to some of my favorites, so I swirl the bottle and add all of the yeast to give it more pop. The finish is a light floral hoppiness, a touch of alcohol, and more sugar sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Less that medium carbonated, slightly sticky sweet, all in a medium body.  Drinkability: At 9%, this can really kick you if you let it. However, there are a couple of tripels I like better than this. To be fair, this is still a stellar beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ryantaussig,4.64,"Split with a friend into a Duvel and a Gulden Draak Tulip. He's sitting in on this review.  A: Beautiful golden straw color. Relatively hazy, giving a nice translucence. Head consisted of medium to large bubbles leading to less than satisfactory retention. Still leaves a decent lace.  S: Fruit comes forward right away with blueberries and citrus out in front. A slight hop backdrop sets up the plethora of malt complexities. Yeast esters and alcohol at the end.  T: Lots of malts, some roasted some not. Notes of toasted bread and cloves in the front of the palate. Alcohol and yeast noticeable at the back end. Hop character is lively providing a good balance to all the malts.  M: The feel is pretty much the representative for a tripel. Just about medium with a definite level of smoothness to it, ending with a dry estery finish with a bit of heat.  D: At a high ABV and a standard bottle size that's in the bomber category means I'm done after two. I could potentially drink it all night, but it's not likely.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Candy coated a'njou pears and apple peel.  T: Sour apples, pears clove, pepper and spicy yeast. Very sweet on the finish.  M: Medium bodied and smooth. Tons of tingly carbonation. Good drinkability.  Overall: This is a pretty good triple. Not the best I've ever had but very enjoyable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S: Buttery, bananas, cloves, yeast, a touch of pepper and more fruits.  T: Sweet and smooth. Bananas, cloves, a bit of pepper and citrus. Pears and apples. Ends with a nice creamy, buttery finish. The sweetness is balanced by the belgium yeast and an ever so slight hop bitterness, very nice. It tastes pretty much how it smells.  M: Medium body. Active and lively carbonation, yet its still pretty smooth.  D: Very good drinkability for being 9% and a Tripel. ABV is hidden pretty well. I wouldn't think I would like this beer this much, I was way wrong.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

One of my favorite representations of the style.  MF: Bubbly and light. Very inviting drink.  D: Extremely high. Really love this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,airheadmtrcycle,4.65,"I knew I would like this beer. It's been in my cellar (closet) for months. I kept denying myself the pleasure for some reason. My shrink says I do that a lot. Opening the bottle was not an easy task; I ended up using a corkscrew. It poured beautifully from the 750 ml bottle into a Sierra Nevada pint glass. It's a beautiful hazy golden color with a foamy head that disappeared a little faster than I would have preferrered with little lacing to speak of. Next time I'll go for a more aggressive pour as in the Unibroue video on their website.  But oh the smell is spectacular! Fruity, rich and malty with some booze. The taste is more restrained with the booze, which is a good thing for me, but the fruity yeast, and rich malty flavors are far beyond my greatest expectations for this fantastic tripel. This is definitely a sipping beer, and as it warms the flavors are getting more pronounced. I'm in love! How do they hide 9% ABV?!?!  The mouthfeel is medium, which is surprising with all the malts that probably go into this ale. Its downfall is it's too drinkable for an ale with 9% ABV. :-)  Next to Duvel this may be my favorite beer I've ever tasted. Sorry for gushing beer vets, but I feel like I've crossed some kind of threshold of flavor that I didn't know was possible for a beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Delicious!  M- Medium, slightly dry body. Bubbly at first but kind of disappeared by the time i got to this time in the review. I must add, a bit of alcohol warmth is coming through now and really bringing out some subtleties.  D- Much easier to drink than the 9% led me to anticipate.

The taste is fairly smooth and has notes of grain/wheat, pineapple, peaches, clove/yeast and some tartness. It begins with honey and biscuity malt and moves into light fruit with a hint of bitterness/light sparkling cider quality. The yeast gives a slight pepper note as well. This beer is very complex and some of the flavors are hard to place. The mouthfeel is coating, with moderate thickness and high carbonation.

22,34,TheBrewo,4.42,"When poured we find a cloudy pale golden-yellow colored brew, with a light and mobile one and a half fingered head. The aroma is a mix of clove, yeasty wheat, and a fresh sweetness. As we taste we start with a spicy organic array, including clove, coriander, and a mild black pepper. This gives way to a tart, grainy finish. By the end of the sip, the mouth is left slightly dry, and with a faint reminder of the generous abv. It remains fairly medium bodied and, while noticeably carbonated, it goes down smoothly.  Overall, what stands out most is the odorous punch to the nostrils when the bottle is first cracked, the freshness of both the aroma and the following taste, and finally the smoothness of consumption.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Starts out with a little bit of spice that quickly dissipates to make way for the sweet taste of citrus, yeast, and malt. The finish has a very slight, hoppy bitterness to it. There is a light alcohol warmth present throughout, which feels a bit stronger at the finish. The spice makes a noticeable return in the aftertaste.  Medium in body. Excellent carbonation level - crisp and effervescent, but not too bubbly. Coats the palate nicely.  A top-notch triple.

The flavor is outstanding, and this beer is one I could see myself having to many real quick of I'm not careful. Only thing hat would hinder it's drinkability would be the price!

It is just that it's a bit watery for a Tripel. I'd like more substance, more hearty goodness. As it stands, it can't really match up to the same range of foods that a traditional Belgian Tripel could. It's best drunk on its own, really.

S: Bread malt comes through very strong, along with the yeast, tiny bit of hop, ester alcohol, over-ripe fruit (almost old peach, maybe a bit of sweet, soft banana).  T: Tastes as it smells, though a bit more mellow. Floral yeast, heavy bread malt, tiny bit of hop background with almost no bitterness,over-ripe, sweet fruit essences. Has a mellow finish with just a little taste of alcohol, but not overpowering.  M: Medium body, but is really smooth and light. Very crisp with light carbonation that almost disappears after about 15 minutes. A tiny bit chewy due to the heavy malt and yeast presence, virtually no bitterness, finishes very clean and warm.  D: Extremely easy to drink for 9% ABV, alcohol doesn't overpower anywhere and is balanced and soft in the finish. Very smooth. I could drink this all day!  Overall it was a good beer.

22,34,melloashello,4.55,"I have experienced this beer many times before. I realized, however, that I have yet to review it. This beer really is an experience. Deliciousness. Amazing. Pours a beautiful yellow-orange color with a nice head. Smells like greatness. I know that is not that great of an adjective in terms of beer but it is the truth. Smells great, tastes great. This is one of the finest tripels outside the trappist world. Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,chaz410,3.83,"Got this bottle at the flying saucer in Charlotte NC. Pours a bright yellow hazy body with a nice froathy white head that disappears pretty quickly but maintains a thin film. Smells of dried apples, sweet funky esters, dried grassy hops and lots of tart belgian styled funk. Taste heavy of caramel, corn husks, grassy undertone and a hint of raisens. There's some definite sweet, belgian ester and dextrins floating in there making an hard to describe sweet, funky blend. Finishes moderately dry and a little tart. Very smooth and drinkable for the abv and over all style",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Jaxxon61,4.75,"This...beer...alas, a Belgian tripel...is so delicious. I could waste your precious time with the pedantic musings of others as to its clovey-sweet, perfectly-balanced super excellence. But there is no time for hyperbole. Time to drink, voyageurs! Time to quaff this mysterious bitch-goddess from La Belle Province! Bow to its wondrous, inexplicable enchantments! Drink it...like you know you like it!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,dcook11,4.55,"A- Hazy yellow with a medium carbonation and minimal lacing. This tripel displays a penicil thin head and some fine bubbles that aid in its formation. Adding the yeast at the end of the bottle adds somewhat to the head formation and lacing.  S- As I open the bottle hops are the first thing thats stand out, folowed by a malt sweetness and a belgian yeastyness. Although canadian, unibroue imitates the belgian style wuite well. As the beer warms peach and nectarin become very prominent as does the high level of alcohol. Further, as the beer neers room tempature a type of cloying sweetness makes its appearance and sticks around until the end of the bottle.  T- Hops followed closely by a malt sweetnes. Next, a predominant peach and nectarine taste make an appearance. Candied sweetness also adds a bit to the masking of the beers nine percent. As the beer warms up bitterness becomes more noticable. When the yeast is added a baked bread taste is conveyed. The cloying sweetness is one of the only things holding this beer back from a perfect score.  M- La Fin Du monde is medium bodied with a very slight bite from the carbonation.  D-Very smooth drinking, although the sweetness is a bit too much at times. Definitly a sipper at nine percent.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Swedes21,4.42,"341 ml served in a chilled glass..  Appearance - Very nice pouring beer! The beer pours with a nice off white head that appears to be very ""rich""/foamy. The beer is a cloudy gold colour, however, i can still see a decent amount of carbonation. So far, minimal lacing is occurring.  Smell - amazing smelling beer, right away you are hit with a nice fruity banana based smell followed by a decent hop. The alcohol is well hidden here, you would have no idea your are drinking a 9% beer.  Taste - Strong aftertaste that is very smooth, you know your drinking a good beer here. You can taste the balance between the fruits, citrus and spices. It is a totally balanced beer.  Mouthfeel - Increased levels of carbonation add to the overall taste of this beer. I found it to be light yet creamy on the pallet and the aftertaste is still strong, but smooth.  Drinkability - I have been excited to try this beer for a long time, and it did not let me down. The beer offers a solid and well balanced taste. I am looking fwd to stocking these and enjoying them one night by the far. Great beer for great times!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

T - Plenty of sweet cloves and bananas with some white wine like flavours, the booze is well hidden.  M - Medium body with spritzy full carbonation. Well balanced.  D - There is something in this beer that does not quite make it authentic Belgian, although it's the best take on the style that you could hope for outside of Belgium. Not a patch on a Westmalle or Chimay Tripel though, as it does not have the depth in body or flavour of those beers. Not sure this should be classified as a Belgian Tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,StephenRich,4.7,"The story goes that a intrepid group of explorers from Europe were searching the world as they knew it for spices, and when they came to the shores of North America they believed that they had encountered the end of the world. La Fin du Monde does mean the end of the world, but I would not take that so literally when considering this beer. Really, this beer is better suited for celebration rather than crisis - but it's name, style and execution is right up Uniqboue's alley.  La Fin du Monde is Belgian Style Tripel - a rich, spicy, effervescent, and pale golden beer. This is a very historic traditional Belgian Style of beer which is mimicked all across the globe by thousands of breweries; so you will encounter many takes on this classic brew. Unirboue's is a classic interpretation, and one of the best I have ever had - especially after it has been left a few years to mature. It is 9% abv, perfectly golden and crisp, and packed with spicy aromatic flavors that are masterfully reminiscent of the Belgian ales that inspired it.  This beer is honestly something special. When I was younger and first getting into real beer I wasn't really able to appreciate all of its complexities, delicate flavors, and supreme construction. But now, with a seasoned palate and a greater appreciation for beer and flavor I have come back to La Fin du Monde with an open heart - and the beer rewards. If you havent had a Fin du Monde in a few years, grab a bottle from the LCBO or your local liquor store and enjoy one with a friend; this beer has a lot to offer. Better yet though, buy several bottles and put some away to age - this beer will mature in a cellar for up to 5 years and really starts to hit its stride after 2. It is remarkable.  I opened La Fin du Monde up at cool around 10C (50F) and poured it gently into its own tulip glass. The pour was rich and lively building a frothy white head instantly on top of the golden yellow beer. The roaring excitement from the beer crashing into itself created a large pillowy head that stood a good 3 inches high. It was pure white with tightly packed carbonation and a creamy cap. The beer was lightly hazy with a slight transparent glow. It shone in pure gold with bronze streaks and pale yellow straw bending through it. Its a perfect depiction of a Tripel so far, and I couldn't wait for the scent.  The nose is rich and spicy with large fruity perfumes and delicate pale malt aromas. It is bright and crisp on the nose showing green apples, honey, coriander, earthy yeast, dried papaya, apricots and a hint of citrus. Get your nose right up to the beer and breath in gentle cloves, warming pale malt sensations, hints of sugary caramel and a touch of ginger cake. It is softer and less tart than many of the Belgian versions, and thus easier on the palate. It also brings a hint of fresh floral hops and a quick finish of pepper - if you let this beer age, any speck of alcohol that you find falls out and brings forth warmer and creamy fruit and malt aromas.  The first sip is pungently reminiscent of the nose; crisp and clean spices match a lightly tart-sweet yeast character that quenches your palate from the start. This delicate but snappy spice is very welcome on the beers overall character because a smooth wave of pale malts and fruity esters will melt in over your tongue to balance off the whole experience. Hints of caramel and sugar candy blend in with oranges, apples, apricots and mango. Honey and sweet grains float litely in the back, and a soft tropical fruit sweetness glides into citrus and shows the first crack at hops.  Hop bitterness is gentle and used to balance, not show up at the front end. It works with the coriander and pepper note very well, but is soft and playful just in the back. The smooth effervescent nature of the beer helps everything - every inch of its flavor is accentuated by the mouthfeel which is somehow crisp and creamy at the same time. This aids a dry and spicy sweet finish that again, quenches your palate with ease.  La Fin du Monde is far less wild than the Beglian Tripels, and much more civilized than most American interpretations. This all comes together to create a uniquely Quebec style Tripel that is worthy of everyones enjoyment. Enjoy la Fin du Monde alone, or pair with all sorts of funky cheeses, fish, shellfish, game, sausage, cheesecake or roast turkey.

22,34,wmtxbb,4.15,"Appearance: light caramel color with lots of carbonation sustaining a decent sized head.  Smell: Apples, oranges and malt.  Taste: Fruit flavor, some citrus flavor, some malt character, finishing with a nice touch of alcohol. The 9% abv is incredibly well hidden. Beautiful flavor that isn't too light or too heavy.  Drinkability: At 9 percent this is a dangerous beer because it drinks like a session beer but has the flavor of the tripel style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jlandis,4.77,"A - Hazy straw golden in color with 2 cm white head that slowly fades to a thin rim.  S - Bright apples, bananas, white grapes hit you right up front as the clove and anise start to kick in. This is a beautifully fragrant beer.  T - Rich flavor that exactly mirrors the nose - apples, bananas, white grapes and cloves. There is also a well balanced sweet malt in the finish along with a subtle alcohol presence.  M - Medium body with decent carbonation.  This is one of my most favorites from Unibroue, and with a name that translates ""The End of the World"" how could you go wrong? Everything is blended together so fantastically and each flavor compliments the next. Sophisticated in one sip and kick you in the face ballsy in the next. I love this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,QuestionableScum,4.52,"Pours a hazy deep golden yellow with some hints of orange. And a one finger near frothy head. Very effervescent.  Smells quite yeasty, and a little tart. I get lots of fruits including apple, pear and a little bit of banana. A little bit of clove and pepper.  Taste is much like the smelll with lots of bready, slightly tangy, yeastiness, fruity notes along with some spiciness and little bit of funk at the end. The fruity notes have element of apple, pear, a little bit of banana and perhaps apricot . Clove and pepper are the predominant spice notes. Quite well-balanced and a good introduction to the tripel style, as this one is substantially less funky and quite a bit sweeter than many other tripels.  The mouthfeel is good although I prefer it when tripels are a little bit drier.  Alcohol is very well-hidden, and the beer is super-drinkable. If you did not read the label that this was 9% it would not be at all evident.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,flannelman808,3.91,"A: Pours a mildly hazy soft orange yellow almost peach color. Soft hues of lightened pink... its actually a gorgeous color. Bone white head tops off the glass (Duvel for this taste) great retention on what looks like latte foam. However minus points on lacing, which was almost nonexistent for the record.  S: This beer is all about the combination of subtly. And I say with out thinking twice that it is the hardest beer to describe in a what's that flavor/ aroma sort of way. Anyhow here goes... cardamom spice black pepper maybe.... not overwhelmingly powerful but spicy more than anything else. I think I get a mild sort of pear like quality as well.  T: Once again this beer is insanely in balance. Annoyingly actually, I would actually prefer to get more umph in one direction or another. Its like imagining a utopian society as peaceful but boring as hell. Not that this beer is boring, it's not its good. Just annoying. Predominant flavors here are in the way of; cardamom, clove, black pepper lavender, raw sugar, as well as a kind of herbal sort of bitterness that shows from what is probably a light amount of hopping. Its not too sweet and not too dry but more important, as a good triple aught to be it... This one is predominantly dry finishing. Mild sort of fruity esters hit the front of the palate first and scream sweet flavors, just for a second or two and dissipate rapidly. Almost like a sugary melon sort of flavor but again very mild.  M: again annoyingly balanced... carbonic yet smooth.  D: INSANELY HIGH. This is a 5 our of 5 with out thinking twice and if there were a way to rate higher I would. I have had this beer with all walks of life and not only does everyone love it from people who want ""light"" beer to people who want ""dark"" beer, but the fact that this is 9 % abv is unreal. Not to mention that It is still very inexpensive for the quality of the product. I have never written so much in the drinkability category before but the end of the world deserves it... even if it is french canadian.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,andrenaline,3.88,"I've had several other Unibroue offerings (I think I take it for granted given the readily available spread of offerings from Unibroue) but I've never tried their flagship top rated beer.  A - Pours a hazy golden orange colour with a thumb of light egg white head which quickly dissipates leaving some fine lacing.  S - Scent is a bit chalky with spices and burnt roasted malts masked by cardboard cork presence. Not terrible, but I was a bit disappointed with the nose on this one. The chalky scent dissipated after about 10 minutes revealing some cloves and cinnamon, which was nice.  T - The flavours are much like the scent, with the spices dominating (cloves, cinnamon and bit of pepper on the finish), followed by burnt malts. The alcohol is noticeable and definitely lingers a bit, leaving a warming feeling on the finish.  M - Mouthfeel is medium bodied, bursting into big bubbles on the tongue, followed by a smooth finish. No complaints here.  D - Overall, this is a very tasty offering from Unibroue. I find some of the true Belgian offerings a little less harsh, but don't take that as meaning this isn't worthy. It's a very tasty tripel, I've just found some others that mask the ABV a little better.

S- Very light and fruity in smell. Quite yeasty in smell with a nice bit of malts as well. The smell also has the distinct bottle fermentation smell; which in this case smells a bit sour.  T- Amazingly light and fruity in taste, like guava and pineapple. The yeasty flavours also come out quite strong, combined with the malts quite nicely. The aftertaste is quite a bit bitter, with a small hint of sourness.

It feels light and crisp, the flavours mixing perfectly and leaving a dry Prosecco aftertaste.  D: Excellent drinkability. I had no problem finishing three of these in thirty minutes and only the 9% kept me from drinking more.  Overall: This is an exceptional brew. It is a very smooth, very drinkable brew.

The taste was similar to the smell...dominated by orange and lemon zest, but the cloves were much more present in the taste than they were in the smell. The spicy Belgian yeast was also evident.

The taste didn't seem like it aligned with the smell. The yeast stands out, but I was expecting more of the spicy/fruityness to come through.  It had a good mouthfeel - medium, carbonated.

22,34,lacqueredmouse,4.5,"Possibly one of the last bottles to reach Australian shores, at least for a while, sadly. Chilled to cellar temperature and served in my Unibroue tulip, avoiding the lees.  Body is an absolutely beautiful cloudy but burnished ripe pear colour, deep yellow with hints of orange in its depths. Head is billowy and frothy, boisterously foaming up when poured. Pleasantly light body and thick sheeting lace as the head collapses. It's a wonderful looking beer.  Nose is crisp but round, full of spicy, earthy Belgian yeast notes, with hints of dark fruit, fig compote, pickled orange rind, and whisked vanilla essence. Such wonderfully blended and outrageously sophisticated aromas. Gorgeous.  Taste is smooth and round, but with a central vector of fruity acidity that cuts pleasantly through the sweetness. Spicy Belgian notes come up through the back, along with a subtle but structured spirit bite. Mouthfeel tingles with subtle heat and acidity throughout, just livening up the palate wonderfully.  Yes, this is a very good and very well-crafted beer. Extremely flavoursome, but so well balanced and light enough that it's supremely drinkable.

22,34,mariposafan,4.72,"From a bottle into a Duvel tulip.  Starts with about two fingers of soapy head, larger bubbles than I'm used to. The head dies back to a thin film that persists through the drink. Light amber and translucent - almost reminds me of apricots, for some reason.  The smell is very much banana and bubblegum, with some alcohol adding a little heat.  The taste is still banana and bubblegum, but the alcohol is absent and there's a yeasty note that adds some wonderful depth along with some mild tartness that rounds things out wonderfully. Not sweet, but not really dry either, with a minerality that almost comes across as lightly salty.  The mouthfeel is moderate to thin, but the carbonation adds a level of creaminess.  This could be dangerous! I don't feel the alcohol at all until I go to move, then the 9% slaps me up alongside the head.

22,34,shand,4.18,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass, best before 3/26/13.  Appearance: Pours a hazy straw color with about two fingers of head. The head doesn't stick around for long though, leaving just wisps of retention. This is probably due to my incorrect glassware. The carbonation looks very nice here, a good stream of rising bubbles.  Smell: Smells a bit strange, to be honest. Smells a bit like fruit, and a bit like corn. Not exactly the most appealing smell. Thankfully, as it warms up the smell becomes a bit more appealing. The corn scent goes away, leaving straw and fruits.  Taste: Thankfully, the taste more than makes up for the smell. This stuff is very complex tasting. It goes in very smooth and fairly non-descriptly yeasty, but the aftertaste is a hell of a ride. Fruits (pears and apples) come in, then malts, then just a bit of hops make this awesome. The hops are a bit unexpected, this is hoppier than other beers I've had of this style. There's a bit of lemongrass flavor to hold this all together. Overall, it's a very sweet beer.  Mouthfeel: Hits the mouth nice and light, but coats the throat on the way down.  Drinkability: For it's ABV, this is amazingly drinkable. Dangerously drinkable, if you will. Alcohol is almost completely hidden, with just a hint coming out in the late finish.  A great trippel available at a pretty great price for the style. Not quite as good a deal as Golden Monkey can be found for, but worth the premium.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

A handsome warm, golden, cider haze. A fuzzy, white, two finger head that fizzles down to a constant layer of pretty bubblies. Great sticky lace as well.  Whoa nelly. Dis smelly da good stuff! Fruity...strong fruits. There's a sharpness to it as well.  First off, nice boozy kick. Aftertaste of apple/cider. Cloves, spice, strong, slightly acidic.  Medium body with a smooth and dry finish that delivers a sting to the back of your throat.  Any beer that tastes this good, smells this good, and has this high of an ABV, I'm down to drink.

22,34,Lauthaha,3.6,"Poured from a 25.4 ounce bottle into a nearly-fluted glass as per the bottle's instructions.  Appearance: Looks a lot like a pilsner. Golden bordering on straw, with not a great deal of head. Slightly cloudy with mild carbonation.  Smell: At very first, all I could smell was a corny, hop-bare scent reminiscent of PBR or Budweiser. Pulling the glass back a touch reveals some hop action and a sweetness somewhat like honey. Possibly some herb action as well. Would have a better score if there weren't that corny pre-smell.  Taste/Mouthfeel: The candy sugars coexist with bitter herbs (possibly anise or licorice even) in a somewhat pleasant way. Very light carbonation make you work to gather all the flavors, but in the end it's worth it. Rinses nearly clean with herbal colors remaining after imbibing.  Drinkability: Eh.

An awesome looking dark yellow, somewhat orangeish hue that glows ominously when held to a light source. Quite hazy indeed, but no obvious yeasty chunks so it looks good. A bright, pillowy white head that looks oh so creamy sits on top, beckoning the drinker to come hither. Retains a big head throughout, and the lacing is coating the whole side of the glass and sticking well.  The aroma is musty, like a dark cave cellar that hasn't been opened in years. Quite horsey, lots of barnyard funk. Also a good bit of peppery clove character and maybe the slightest hint of banana. Super complex, and definitely holds my interest, but it's missing a few of the fruity aromas I've come to love in the classic Belgian Tripels.  The up front taste is quite funky. A lot of that same horse/barnyard character from the smell. Fortunately though, that gives way to some nice fruity flavor that includes peach, apricot, banana, and even some tropical fruits like pineapple that are buried away. Those awesome fruity flavor are balanced out by the spicy clove and black pepper kick near the end of the sip. The combination of funk, fruit, and spice are in great balance and complete a very interesting experience for the flavor profile.  Spot on mouthfeel. Well carbonated, lively, yet smooth and creamy. Coats the palate extremely well, and has a good medium thickness that you can chew through. Head texture is extremely soft and creamy.  Overall this beer is definitely a classic and a hell of a Tripel. Revisiting this beer has reminded me that Unibroue does hold up to the great Tripels I have had in the past few years, and brings an excellent funk to the table that seems hard to find in the other examples. Literally no alcohol presence here either, making it easy to drink and enjoy. I would recommend this beer with Pad Thai, which I have paired numerous times with great success.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,brewmudgeon,4.1,"la fin du monde  a 3.5-4 light hazy golden hay. a finger+ foam that is assertively maintained by rising bubbles of at least medium girth. for some reason i thought this beer was a dubbel, but it sure doesn't look like one.  s 4 lemony, fresh cut hay and crackery aromas. some sweetness is evident. esters, touch of clove. smells somewhere between a tripel and a saison.  t 4 tangy, bright, belgian yeastyness. some clove and bready lemon zest, sour apple. this is surely a tripel with perhaps saison tendencies.  m 3.5-4 a bit too effervescent for me, but that's easily remedied (at least partly). would prefer the carbonation to be finer.  d 4-4.5 dangit i was more in the mood for a deep, brooding dubbel. still, this cheerful and zippy 9% (!??) brew is amazingly well behaved for its strength. its popularity appears deserved. wow, you could hand this to someone who just finished the yardwork and he/she could probably drink it on down assuming it to be some sort of summer wheat refresher.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,carpezytha,4.15,"Poured into tulip.  A: White head descends rapidly to a tiny island in the middle of a honey-golden slightly murky body. S: Wet wool, new leather, grass. Wet concrete. T: Active carbonation brings out malts and sugars under a tangy yeasty bite. Funk/caramel ratio makes this a winner. M: Well carbonated despite the anemic head. Helps bring forth a lot of flavor. D: For such a high ABV these are easy to quaff, so I would say yes on the drinkability and yes on the watch out.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,tewaris,3.92,"La Fin Du Monde (The End of the World in English) Triple-style Golden Ale (from Brewer's page) 19 IBUs 12 oz bottle with a freshness date of March 30, 2013 poured into a tulip on October 1, 2010. Since their sommelier recommends an age of 3-5 years, and adds that it peaks at 3 years of age, I would guess that this is around its best at two and a half years! The pour was as instructed by the sommelier: the bottle was agitated to dissolve the yeast. Yet, I poured a little separately at first to examine the clarity.  Appearance 4/5 Pours golden amber with a big creamy head. Although the beer is clear unagitated, the recommended pour causes an obvious haze. The head is quick to recede and in that respect, the looks are not as impressive as similar beers, say Westmalle Tripel. The lacing is quite good though, but I must say that the head was disappointing.  Aroma 4.5/5 Aroma is fruity, and dare I say, perfumy? Very soft and enticing, with a touch of spice. No hint of booze. But it's a little too weak. A few swirls release a toasty malt aroma time to time.  Taste 3.5/5 Slightly malty sweet, with mild fruitiness and slight bitterness. Finish is clean and slightly bittering which is a surprise considering the low IBUs. The aftertaste is long with a malty creaminess but not sweet or cloying. Some alcohol warming.  Mouthfeel 4/5 The body is medium but the effervescence of the style is missing.  Drinkability 4/5 I expect more in other departments. Yet, the 9% is not noticeable at all! Amazingly done!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TCgoalie,4.22,"Notes from 8/28/10  Thank you BuckyFresh for sharing this with TCHopCraver and I.  Pours a hazy golden yellow with a pleasant white foam head, the lacing is outstanding.  Apple, clove, banana, and a sour lemon smell radiate from the glass. There is also some yeast, black pepper, and pear. This is very fresh smelling and well balanced.  The yeast is forward in the taste which transitions to apple, lemon, and orange. The spicy-ness that was in the nose is very understated in the taste. There is a yeasty hop aftertaste. Overall, I thought the flavor would have more of a bite as evidence of the smell. The flavors seem a bit muted.  The mouthfeel is light with a good coating of the tongue. This soon fades to some drying with a clean aftertaste.  This is an easy drinker for %9 as the alcohol is well hidden. This is a good summer ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,gportale,4.77,"I am a big fan of Tripels, but this is an amazing beer. Served a bit below room temperature.  A - golden yellow color with about a half an inch of head. S - smelled delicious with a hint of citrus T - unbelievable, absolutely amazing taste. Strong, but not over-bearing with a taste that was foreshadowed by its smell, and a malt finish upon swallowing. M - Very smooth, not too much carbonation, but enough.  I would drown myself in this beer. I could see myself skipping a meal and just drinking as many of these as I could.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BuckyFresh,4.1,"Enjoyed with TCGoalie and TCHopCraver. Split the 750ml bottle three ways.  Appearance: Poured into a large wine glass. Looks like sunshine pouring out of the bottle. A white, frothy, one-finger head results from the pour. Good retention and lacing as well. Surprisingly opaque given the light straw color. Decent carbonation agitates the yeasty buddies floating at the bottom of the glass.  Smell: Funky lemons and sour bananas are what greet those who sniff this brew. Fresh fruit and clove are there as well, with a decent amount of pepper spicing things up. I'm also detecting a mineral-like quality as well. This beer's aroma would make a nice glade plug-in.  Taste: Light-bodied and sunshiny. Lemon and yeast with a nice fruit flavor. There is also somewhat of a grassy/hay character present. Not a ton of complexity in the flavor department, but the flavors that are there are well-balanced and refreshing.  Mouthfeel: Light/medium-bodied. Finishes pretty clean, but there is a bit of hotness from the ABV.  Drinkability: This beer seemed to evolve a bit throughout the drinking experience. The brightness seemed to decrease over time and the pepper flavor seemed to become more pronounced. Gave me pretty bad heartburn towards the end too.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Hoescheg,3.98,"A: thick golden ale with a little head. S: light fruity, some spices in there. T: good belgian triple flavor, but doesnt linger, cant taste the booz.

Mouthfeel: Very smooth. Drinkability: Low due to the lack of complexity.  At the end of the day I'd rather just be drinking a garden-variety amber or sour. Not sure what this beer brings to the table, honestly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,zhanson88,4.08,"Appearance: Golden straw color with tons of pure white head. Retention is very nice, and the resulting lacing is tight and abundant.  Smell: This beer smells of grass, cloves, slight citrus, and phenolic alcohol. There is a slight smell of pepper, but a sugary sweetness that is more prevalent that I was not expecting. It seems a bit out of place compared to other tripels that I've had.  Taste: Slight pepper at the front, but once again there is a pretty strong lemony sweetness that takes over a bit. Grass as cloves as well, and I can definitely detect the alcohol going down.  Mouthfeel: Pretty smooth, with light body. There is quite a bit of carbonation, but that's to be expected.  Drinkability: Overall I liked this beer a lot. The sweetness kind of threw me a bit, but other than that no complaints. Definitely worth a try and another solid effort by Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TCHopCraver,4.12,"Reviewed from notes on 8/28/10 with BuckyFresh and TCGoalie. Thanks for the bottle, Bucky!  A: Pours a light gold with a pure white, 1 finger head into a snifter. The carbonation and color combine to give this beer a highly effervescent and glittery look. The lacing is good and reminds me of spindly tree limbs.  S: A cornucopia of fruits and spices reside in the smell of this beer. Lots of spicy Belgian yeast, lemon, lemongrass, prickly pear, pepper, golden delicious apples, clove, mineral water, and numerous other aromas waft out of the glass. This smell is fresh, fresh, fresh, and sings of a golden, dewy spring morning. Warning: Do not suck this beer into your nostrils. It feels very uncomfortable.  T: The dominant taste in my mouth is lemon. This is backed by grassiness and a peppery zing. Spicy yeast and fresh pear also grace my palate. This is a very bright and shiny taste which wears on my palate a bit as time slip slides away. In all, though, it is pretty well balanced with a nice emphasis on the spicy yeast.  M: Nicely clean and tingly on my mouth. However, it was a little thin and watery for the style and quite bright on my palate.  D: The bomber split three ways was probably enough for me. I enjoyed it very much but the brightness and faux sweetness of the taste was pretty wearing on my palate. This will be a once in awhile treat for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Beejay,4.23,"A: Pale yellow, very hazy, a small white head on top.  S: Sweet, bready, and hints of banana. A hint of clove, and some yeasty notes.  T: A nice sweet tartness, ripe fruits and berries; especially strawberry. A hint of citrus and clove in the finish, with yeast rounding it out. The tartness fades a bit as it gets warmer. The booze is well hidden.  M: Light bodied, dry, and very highly carbonated.  D: Another dangerous brew.. very tasty! I would definitely have this one again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,fiver29,4,Bottle pours cloudy dark golden color with white head. Aroma is yeast. Has a medium light mouthfeel with a lot of carbonation. Flavor is yeast. Not as strong as some of the other brews by this brewer. But it just dominates all their brews. That dark strong yeast aroma and taste is just too much for me.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ThePorterSorter,4.4,"Appearance: This beer poured a light yellow amber with good head formation and great retention. Highly carbonated and...who doesn't love a French labeled pint with a cork you get to pop off at your roommates?? In a tulip glass it has decent lacing and looks like a honey amber or a liver failure yellow.  Smell: Smells light and aromatic, hint of citrus and hint of the 9%abv. Cherries, tangerine, orange citrus, and a hint of yeast. The beer, by appearance and smell, seems balanced and inviting.  Taste (warmed from cool to RT): This is definitely a much lighter triple, very refreshing and something I did not expect from an area as cold and dark as Canada (no offense, but I'm geographically related to Que & can joke like that). I am almost reminded of a summer wheat, yet it still holds on to the basic essentials of a Belgian style triple. This beer is buttery smooth and has a lingering citrus/champagne linger. The taste is followed by sweet honey and distinctive yeast. Very scrumptious.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation is heavy, possibly too heavy, but distinctive of the style. I wouldn't be happy with a Triple that didn't rocket the cap into outer space and follow every gulp with bubbles lifting you off your seat. Therefore I hail politely. The mouth has no complaints about the upfront sweetness or the slightly bitter finish. Like I said, similar to the feel of a summer ale.  Drinkability: I split this pint with one other person and already wouldn't mind getting out a hose and siphoning it from within their gastric system just to grab one more sip. It almost didn't last this review. It has such nice flavors and such a light composure. I will remember this beer and compare other beers to its drinkability.  Cheers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bohemiandonut,4,"Well it *smells* how I remember: Apple spritz, clove and Belgian yeast. It's easy to forget how much I like this cold, to treat every beer like it is a barrel aged imperial stout - a critical error in my opinion.  General Pear makes his appearance along with more tropical fruit on the pour, revealing a cloudy lustrous bronze nectar. This beer has a great mellow funk, nice and woody, deep earth tones beneath the fruit, mud and frost.  Tastes like that too. (Is this a cop-out?) Okay, the floral flavors really come through, making this a rather sweet Tripel on the wetter side of dry. The finish is wet and juicy.  I prefer a drier Tripel with less clove, more oak and sour fruit, and a foamier mouthfeel. Regardless, this is top notch, a huge value, and perhaps the only continental Tripel to get it right (that I can afford anyway... ahem *ALLAGA$H*).  At a grocery store this would often beat out a 6er at $7.99. For a Tripel craving I would have to seek out that bastard Westmalle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BBP,4.57,"A- Banana gold with medium carbonation.  S- Like a Tripel should smell. Spices up front with a bit of sweet fruity smell. Tons of things to pick up on.  T- Banana, cloves, spices, belgian yeast, slight hops, notes of apple, pear, a tad of malt, and some very subtle hints of the alcohol in the aftertaste. Hides the ABV extremely well.  As it warms up the alcohol strengthens slightly and the fruit tastes become more vivid, leaving you with a very nice aftertase. I think it hits it's best as it begins to warm up a bit.  M- Fairly full body and very smooth. The carbonation fits the bill and compliments the body very well.  D- One of the easiest 9%'s to drink that I've discovered. I could see myself downing the whole 750ml beast very quickly if not for self control.  I bought four of these after I tasted my first in this review, and I plan to get 4 more.

I've confirmed that this beer has changed in taste compared to when I used to drink it plentifully years ago. I get an off-putting strong metallic pang that comes through in the aftertaste. Yucky.

22,34,DKter,4.8,"A few of my beer-geek friends were sitting around drinking beer (of course), and talking about some of our favorites. The question came up about which beer we choose if we could only have one beer for the rest of our lives. Being a malt-fiend, I chose some huge dark beer like St. Bernardus Abt. 12, but three folks--without hearing each other--independently came up with La Fin du Monde from Canadian brewer Unibroue. I thought that was an odd response, but I had one for the first time since that conversation--in Montreal with a giant plate of poutine, no less--and I get why they picked it.  La Fin du Monde is officially a ""triple fermentation Golden Ale."" Like the best Belgian tripels, it's a strong pale ale that perfectly blends malt and hops. It's a big beer at 9% alc./vol., but not overpowering. It flavorful but not too spicy. It's certainly not the very best beer in the world, but it would be hard to find one that better incorporates all the best things about beer. ""This beer is brewed to honour of the great explorers, who believed they had reached the end of the world when they discovered America,"" Unibroue says on their website.

It has a crisp fruity taste where I picked up some citrus, maybe a hint of banana, and a great hops after taste that wasn't too overbearing.

Very sweet lacking the tang of more domestic Belgian style ales. Decently strong alcohol content, yet it barely hints wards this. Mild, not overbearing (read New Belgium Tripel), coriander flavor.

Alcohol is dangerously hidded - you want to chug it but it'll hit you if you do. I didn't notice an alcohol flavor until I would breathe in after swallowing a mouthful. As it warms more pepper shows itself. The mouthfeel is what really gets you with this one. Very creamy feel. Great beer.

Everything about this beer is balanced and you are able to taste and enjoy each flavor. Citric fruits add a bitterness, the yeast adds sweetness, and the malts add a bold wheaty flavor. Alcohol gives some nice warmth in the finish.  Mouthfeel - The first thing you get is the sweet fruits coating the tounge. Loads of grape and lemon. Some spices and yeasty sugars comes in next. Palate gets more of the same along with some wheat malts, and warmth alcohol. The finish is sweet, warm and fruity.  Drinkabilty - Simply amazing, such a tasty, well balanced and enjoyable beer.

S - Smell is very fruity and yeasty. Lots of light fruits dominate this aroma. Peaches, apples, maybe some cherries. Yeasty malt aroma is in the background.  T - Taste is much different than the aroma. The fruits are still there but the malts dominate right off the bat. As the taste progresses, this changes, but the initial taste is all malts. As the malts fade, the fruits come into play one by one. First the apple, then some cherry/orange, finishing with the peach tartness. The beer rounds out with a bready/fruity combination.  M - Light to medium boded with lots of carbonation. Tart mouthfeel all around, but not lambic or wild ale tart. This is the perfect balance of tart and sweet with the flavors involved. Carbonation enhances the tartness giving your mouth a nice fizz throughout the taste.  D - Great drinkability. I had a few friends who had tried this and didn't like it.

Mouthfeel is nice and well-bodied, with those little fizzy bubbles providing just the right amount of carbonation to make the entire experience really quite nice.  Drinkability is great, thanks to the delectable taste and mouthfeel, which are tempered by the hefty 9% ABV. La Fin Du Monde is the beer that first got me into drinking craft and I wanted to give it justice in my review, because it is a very worthy example and is quite deserving of all the accolades. Even now, it's just as good as I remember it was the first time around. That's the mark of a great brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Vaison,4.87,"12 oz. bottle poured into a goblet.  Very cloudy looking coming out of the bottle during the pour. It settles very nicely into the glass creating a 1/2 inch dense white head which dissipated very quickly leaving only a ring on the outside. The color is golden saffron. The smell of this is incredible. I immediately smell strong floral, fruits and spice with a touch of honey included. The taste immediately brings out the floral aspects, the most of any beer I've ever had. I can't quite decide which fruits I detect, but the spice notes at the end are delicious and create a dry finish. This reminds me of champagne because of the high carbonation feel and such a dry finish. A wonderful tripel.  Side note: I first tried this beer about (maybe) 10 years ago while on a ski trip in Quebec. I picked it up at a small package store just outside the tiny town of Magog. The only reason I bought it was because I like the label of the bottle. I placed this outside of my hotel balcony in the snow and drank it right from the bottle, ice cold. Immediately, this became one of my favorite beers and I did not realize it was available in my area until a few years ago.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Mitro,4.37,"A- Pours golden-brown, with a full, cream colored head. Head dissipates after a short while, but a thin ring is retained. Mediocre lacing.  S- Peaches and nectarines are the most prevalent features of the nose, along with yeast, and a touch of orange.  T- Each sip begins with a malt sweetness, combined with the fruits detected in the nose, and ends with a distinct breadiness and a slight hoppy bitterness. ABV is dangerously hidden.  M- Really delicate carbonation, which gives the beer a smooth, creamy quality.  D- I could maybe take two of these bad boys in one sitting. The malt sweetness, combined with the distinct yeast note fills you up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jsprain1,4.42,"A- Pours a cloudy golden. Head is initially thick but subsides into a thin slick. S- Smells of ripe fruit (peach/nectarines), sweetness, a bit of clove, and some yeast presence. T- Taste is of spicy clove, a bit of alcohol warmth, all wrapped a nice malt backbone. Fruit flavors (peach banana and pear). A bit of yeast in the finish as well. M- Smooth, with high, prickly carbonation. D- One does not even perceive this as a 9% beer. Very deceptive. A very good beer that one could conceivably match with a variety of food pairings.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Bonis,4.05,"A - This doesn't look the same as I remember. Pours to a cloudy deep orange color. Not a lot of head, but a thin layer of bubbles remains long after the pour. Lively carbonation is apparent. This one bubbles almost like a champagne.  S - Smell is a little of light fruits, but much more yeasty with spices and a touch of alcohol. Doesn't smell overly sweet in my opinion. Pleasant overall.  T - Taste is of sweet and sour fruits, along with a balance of sweet malts and then a warming alcohol/spice mix which is pleasant overall. You can tell this is a strong beer, but you certainly wouldn't expect it to be 9%.  M - Fairly full bodied and loaded with carbonation. Probably the weakest aspect of this particular beer to me. I think it could stand to be a little more smooth without so much carbonation, although this is a fine example of a tripel.  D - This one is pretty drinkable at 9%, which is why I suggest you don't pound 4 packs of them on a regular basis. You can feel this stuff after one, but keep em coming for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,urwithdave,4.18,"Thanks for another one Mark! Poured into my Cigar City snifter. Reviewing from notes.  A- pours a hazy pale yellow color. Two fingers of a sudsy white head. Excellent retention with some decent lacing.  A- bready malts and quite a bit of yeast. A bit of bananna and pear.  T- the taste follows the nose. Big bread/biscuit up front. The yeast is strong but not over the top. A hint of the alcohol shines through. At moments, I'd swear I was getting a bit of cloes with banannas mixed in. Very floral.  M- on the lighter side of medium. High carbonation. The finish is very clean.  D- a nice offering. Drinks very easy. This is definitely a gateway beer. I will suggest this to my BMC schwag drinking buddies.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,decimator,4.03,"750ml bottle poured into a pint glass.  A - Hazy yellow-orange colour with a big bubbly long lasting head. Even after many sips there's still a 5mm cap and plenty of lacing  S - Lots going on but it's surprisingly not overpowering or off putting: Sweet (almost like candy), bananas, oranges, peaches, apples, spices, yeast and alcohol notes.  T - Plenty of sweetness upfront with honey and caramel notes. Then it's a mixture of fruity flavours dominated by bananas and orange peel. There's also a nice spiciness and the finish has a bit of an alcohol bite. Despite the ABV being 9% some of the alcohol is well masked by the fruit & sweet flavours. As it warms up the finish gets more bitter. Overall the balance is certainly on the sweet side.  M - Good carbonation, creamy, tangy and plenty of sugary stickiness. The sweet stickiness lasts all the way into the finish.  D - This is good stuff. Not something I would drink regularly but certainly well enjoyed on occasion.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,gford217,3.9,"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a creamy white head that recedes to a thick collar and thin cover of bubbles across the top. Lots of bubbles streaming to the top.  The aroma is sweet with belgian yeast dominating alongside light fruits, especially pears and apricots, and plenty of grass and lightly toasted malts.  Taste has a biting sweetness up front with tons of fruity esters, bananas namely. The Belgian yeast is there in the background as is the hints of earthiness, but they're really overtaken by the sweetness. The finish is sweet and sugary, not dry.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and sticky sweet for the style. Again, finish is less dry and more sweet with the alcohol lingering in the aftertaste.  This is a decent tripel but not one of the best I've had. Having just had the Westmalle tripel tonight, this doesn't quite measure up. It's really sweet and less balanced than the best in the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Nice!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,carolinabeerguy,4.35,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Chimay goblet. Best by date 09-24-12.  Appearance: Pours an opaque golden orange with a 1/4 finger foamy white head which dissipates almost instantly. No lacing at all.  Smell: Quite sweet with banana, yeast and citrus dominating with just a hint of phenols.  Taste: Yeast and malt up front followed by a burst of banana and citrus esters in the middle then finishes with malt and dry phenols. Aftertaste is a mixture of sour citrus and phenols. The high alcohol is well hidden by the tremendous flavor of the beer.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a high amount of carbonation. The carbonation bursts through from the get go.  Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. You don't really notice the alcohol at all so this one could very well sneak up on you.  Overall: Excellent beer overall. Buy it if you see it. It is one I thoroughly enjoyed.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Smell: fruity with apple, grape, some banana.  Taste: apple and some toffee upfront. smooth malty sweetness in the middle. some hop bitterness follows after that. it finishes with warming and sweet alcohol. I notice some tartness, which I did not detect in the past review.  Mouth: smooth and light malt. not cloying. finishes dry, but alcohol seem to linger. it tasted like Duvel.  Drinkability: Not so good. Because of high alcohol, it seem to have some lingering sweetness from it. Though this is relatively ""dry"", it's not that quaffable. It's a sipper for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Beerenauslese,4.5,"Pours a slightly hazy gold, with a cappuccino foamy head that is supported by an army of bubbles rising to the surface.  Delightful aromas of bread, coriander, fruit, toffee. Nose is brisk and a bit volatile.  Tastes strongly of coriander (like a witbier), has nice biscuity malt flavor, a metallic element, club soda, and is rather dry. I detect some watermelon and cantalope. This is the opposite of the very tropical fruity and cloyingly sweet style. This has a dry, hoppy finish, reminiscent of Saison Dupont, along with some hay bale dust.  The body is light with champagne-like carbonation, giving this a very cleansing, refreshing feel. Makes my tongue a bit numb though, due to the coriander.  The ABV is somewhat high but not very noticeable. Altogether, this is a nice dry version of the tripel style that I find highly drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,teamburma,4.19,"Easy pour, nice colour and decent head (which doesn't last long). The beer has a mild aroma which is flowery and pleasant.  Feels nice in the mouth - small, smooth bubbles flow easily.  Taste is yeasty and typical of strong beer - but better than most. Taste moves along the tongue where it rests in the back with a mild aftertaste. The enjoyable taste hides the strong alcohol content but your mouth revealingly puckers ever so slightly along the sides of the bottom of the palette.  This is a 9% beer and you can tell it should be consumed slowly. Start drinking to fast and it saturates your mouth.  Not an everyday beer but a good one to share with a friend, if you split a 750ml bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Pours hazy golden orange with an abundance of foam that disappears quickly.  Aroma is very floral, but a ton of bready yeast present. Some hints of lemon and cinnamon.  Flavor is mild sweet honey, then a pretty well balanced bitterness, but the yeast really dominates the flavor.  Medium bodied, lively carbonation that accentuates the flavor.  Overall, probably a very solid example of the style, but this is not a beer I return to often.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,GDBEERMAN,4.63,"12oz bottle into wine glass, tasted at Bliss, wine and beer shop.  A: A bold haze to the light golden body, with a beautiful head that stays white and fluffy the entire drinking experience. A good bit of lacing is left in layers.  S: The aromatic experience of a pepper/clove/slight banana is found.  T/M: The nose suggests that this is one fine tripel and the taste reassures this notion. Yeast balance is wonderful with the hops and malts, a truly great multi-dimensional brew. The semi-dryness of the mouthfeel, unlocks flavors with the finish and promotes a great lingering sensation.  D: WOW this could be the end all be all to tripels a great rendition of the classic style. I find this to be both a great brew to sip anytime of the year. Could not even put the glass down, very well done. Tastes like it could use a bit of aging, but swell fresh too.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Smell is peppery and fruity. Taste is really complex between the maltiness, fruitiness, and spiciness, all of which are really well balanced with that distinctly Belgian flavor. Medium bodied with a a crisp but slightly sticky mouthfeel with a hint of alcohol. The 9% is definitely well hidden but will sneak up on you quick.

S- Smells a bit like a hefeweisen, banana, peach, and a little sweet honey smell. A strong pineapple smell comes out over the yeast. Very fruity and ""tropical"", not what I expected.  T- Quite the bite to the toungue at first, then it mellows out to the flavors found in the smell. Pineapple and yeast most prevalent. Nice sweet malts, a little honey. This isn't really to my taste but beyond style I don't have many complaints. A well brewed and interesting beer.  M- Great body, great carbonation. Feels good.  D- Suprisingly good for the abv.

A slight bitterness with an alcohol tingle leave the pallet after every sip.  MF: The mouth feel becomes fuller as the beer warns. Carbonation is smooth and right on for the style.

22,34,bogus564,4.27,"Poured into a chalice...  I wanted to save a special beer for my 50th review - that said, a few of my friends instructed me that this is a really good one. Here goes...  Color is a nice hazy golden orange, with a head the color of an orange peel. The head grew to 2 cm in height and dissoved in two minutes, leaving little evidence of its existence.  The smell is spice dominant, after which you can catch a little citrus, then a little (is that earthiness? A new experience for me) something extra - it's certainly interesting, and my nose clearly likes it.  And now, for the taste - wow, spicy, like cloves. After that, what seems like a conspiracy of orange, honey, raisin and grassy flavors. This party is representin'!  Mouthfeel is good - this beer is light in body, with ample carbonation for its type. The finish is pretty dry, and there's a sweet honey aftertaste. Well done.  With a 9% ABV, I'd be careful about knocking down a bunch of these, especially in the 750 ml bottle size, but it's darn tasty, especially with the Italian sub I consumed with it.

22,34,Reaper16,4.14,"12oz. bottle served into a cervoise glass  Pours a typically yellow color, common to the style. 1.5 fingers of bright, white foam made a head composed of small bubbles. Head retention was not very good relative to other examples of the style. Lacing was adequate. All in all an average looking tripel.  Lots of nice fruit in the aroma of this beer. Pears are front and center but not to be discounted are green apple and dried orange. Belgian candi sugar is present, as it should be, to lend a sugary sweetness to the beer. Make no mistake - this does not smell like a dry tripel; this beer is all about the sweetness.  Taste follows the nose: pears, green apples, candi sugar. There is definitely a sweet, caramel, sugary biscuit sort of malt profile at work here. Some fresh flowers poke their way in by way of the hops. On one hand I've had more complex examples of the Tripel style. On the other hand I've had very few Tripels that exhibit the balance and craft of this offering from Unibroue. It is on the sweeter side of the style but there are just enough hops to balance the estery treasure trove.  I love the mouthfeel on this tripel. It is just about perfect for the style, I thinlk. In fact, I will rate it as perfect. It is exquisitely attenuated, especially given how sweet this beer is. The carbonation is certainly present at all times but it is never harsh to the tongue. The body is a nice, medium size that compliments all the residual sugars. The drinkability, then, is also very nice. You never taste alcohol even though the beer is 9% ABV. If you wanted to have two bottles I think you could so so with little difficulty.  This is a great Tripel. Though my score doesn't necessarily reflect it, I'd say that La Fin Du Monde is among my very favorite beers of the Tripel style. It is very tasty but light enough to make you drink more than you should. Definitely recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

This was my favorite part of the beer by far, absolutely great. As it warms, i pick up a hint of alcohol, a little in the nose but more in the throat. the mouth feel was great, the carbonation complimented the level of thickness. there was even a little tartness in the back, which left cleaned my mouth a little, and left the beer begging to be drank.

The taste ends with some malty backbone and slight honey and more than enough clove.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, very smooth, decent carbonation for the style.  Drinkability - Quite so. I'm still relatively new to this area of beer, but I know what I like. This is a very easy to drink beer that is being enjoyed on this amazingly cool summer night in Southern California.

T: Heavenly flavors of ripe fruits, banana, clove, pepper, citrus, lemon juice, tangerine and apple cider. Spicy and sweet balance each other well but do not overpower the taste buds. M: Creamy mouthfeel with soft carbonation and medium body. Alcohol is hidden completely. D: One of the better tripels out there. There is nothing really wrong with this beer. Complex yet smooth flavors. Great head retention and lace. Fruity and spicy. Another great beer from a great brewery.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,djhowell,4.18,"A: Poured into a large wine glass on the lawn of the Wisconsin capitol building. Hazy, golden body with quite a bit of bright white head. Leaves very little lacing but retains well. S: Spicy fruit scent. Apricots, bananas, lemon. T: Very similar to how it smells. Also taste some apple and caramel. Not a hint of booze. M: Very crisp with moderately high carbonation. D: Very drinkable, and well hidden ABV. This was a great alternative to the wine others in my group were drinking this evening. I would certainly pick it up again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Pleasant fruity aroma's A hint of banana.  Taste is very well balanced. I could not detect the alcohol warming much at all.  This beer is sneaky. You could easily enjoy the four pack in a sitting.

S - The full aroma burst forth when I popped the cork. Very pleasant sweet flavors.  T - An effervescent, sweet, alcoholic taste that lingers in the back of the mouth.  M - Very effervescent throughout. A very pleasant mouth feel and aftertaste that makes you content to enjoy it and avoid rushing to take another sip.  D - This is a very drinkable beer - especially on a hot lazy Summer afternoon. Life doesn't get any better than this.

22,34,jporf911,4.33,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. Best Before September 24th, 2012 on the back label, which also suggests suitable glassware. The picture on the front label is of Quebec, which explains the name of the beer: Newfoundland was long considered the literal ""end of the world"" by explorers.  Appearance- 4.5 out of 5. This beer looks great. It pours with an elegant cloudy yellow-gold color and a thick, frothy 3 finger head which remains for most of the drinking experience and occasionally sticks to the side of the glass. The most remarkable part of the appearance is the activity of the carbonation bubbles as countless streams of them fly up through the beer. It's the largest amount of bubbles I've ever seen in a beer, especially considering its cloudy color.  Smell- 4 out of 5. Strongly-scented, La Fin du Monde is redolent of nectarines, cloves, peppery spice, and yeast upfront, with a phenolic undertone and hints of warm alcoholic esters.  Taste- 4.5 out of 5. It's a little disconcerting at first, but it grew on me after a few more sips. My first impression was ""3.5"", but it went up an entire point by the end of the beer. That spicy clove flavor initially hits the tongue, followed quickly by the warming alcoholic esters right behind it. That nectarine scent shifts to less tangy light fruit flavors. The phenolic flavor is present but fades in the wash of other highlights. Of the traditional beer flavors, yeast is the most evident because of the bottle-conditioning (a process that involves allowing yeast to remain in the bottle for further fermentation). The malt contributes a bit of sweetness but mostly fills out the mouthfeel more than the flavor, while the hops leave a mere ghost of a bitter flavor on the back of the tongue. Although candy sugar was used in the brewing process, this isn't a very sweet beer. The aftertaste is of spice and solvent alcohol, which isn't surprising considering the 9% ABV; however, the aftertaste is really the only time that the alcohol taste is noticeable.  Mouthfeel- 4 out of 5. Medium to full-bodied with a creamily smooth texture and bubbly carbonation.  Drinkability- 4.5 out of 5. This is a beer for a night when you really want to take your time and enjoy yourself. Don't expect to chug it or take huge gulps; this is a beer that should be sipped and savored to fully appreciate its complexity. It does a great job of balancing complexity, flavor, and alcohol content (the last of which is rather hard to notice).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bluesfan1181,5,"All I can say about this beer is WOW!!! This is the best tripel and one of the best beers I have ever had. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, best before 3-3-13, into a Delirium Tremens globe.  A - Pours a beautiful 3 finger head that retains very well. Has a pretty golden/amber color that's cloudy with yeast particles.  S - Has a noticeable alcohol smell with that of cloves and spice notes. Also has a banana aroma.  T - Taste spicy yet, mellow, with a fruity complex to it. An alcohol taste is also present.   M - Very smooth on the palate with mild carbonation.  D - This one of the most drinkable beers I have ever drank. Even with the high ABV of 9%, it goes down smooth.  I will drink this beer anytime, anywhere. It is a masterpiece of brewing excellence. I think most beer snobs like me would agree.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Snamnoum,4.4,"Appearance - Pale golden hay color with a massive head which eventually subsided to one finger. Head is white and frothy and leaves lots of sticky lace.  Smell - is subtle. Light fruity notes of peaches and nectarines. Pale malt, yeast and light phenols.  Taste - awesome tripel, I adore this beer. Extremely well balanced sweet malt, bready yeast, and the lightest touch of hops accompanied by a definite alcohol presence at the finish.  Mouthfeel - is great. Very creamy and well carbonated. If not for the carbonation one might become bogged down by the combination of sweetness and alcohol but this is not the case with this tripel.  Drinkability - a truly great interpretation of a belgian tripel. The high abv accompanied with this style and the alcohol which is left in plain sight (or should I say taste) makes one bomber more than enough, but absolutely worth multiple purchases. I will be getting this again and it has definitely surpassed St. Bernardus as my favorite tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

T: The taste is similar to the nose and much stronger, having a good balance between pepper spices and a slight amount of sweetness from the fruits. There are also some notes of candi sugar. M: It feels medium-bodied on the palate with a lot of dryness in the finish. D: The alcohol is very well hidden, which makes this beer very drinkable.

As it warms a bit of breadiness and an almost ""yogurt with fruit"" type smell emerge.  Taste is smooth, hides 9% well, and has notes of grain, pineapple, peaches, yeast and some tartness. It begins with honey and malt and moves into light fruit with a hint of bitterness. The yeast gives a slight pepper flavor. This beer is very complex and some of the flavors are hard to place.  Mouthfeel is coating, moderate thickness and high carbonation.  Overall this beer has great complexity and satisfying flavors. It doesn't quite live up to my favorites (St. Bernardus and Karmeliet) but I would have it again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Lots of clove, some fruit and wheat bread.  T - Very nice tripel. Dominated by spicy yeast and the grainy backbone. Some fruitiness as well, and citrus zest, with just a bit of the alcohol burn. Well balanced and intensely flavored.  M - Medium-bodied and highly carbonated. Lighter than other tripels. Smooth.  D - Despite the ABV this drinks easy and seems light and refreshing for the style.

T: This follows the smell - lemon, biscuit, banana, and some spiciness. The yeast flavors linger, coaxing me into another sip... and another. There is also some tartness late in each taste but this subsides to a nice clean finish. No alcohol comes through which is scary at this ABV.  M: Thick and creamy, with lots of carbonation with tickles delightfully.  D: This beer is full of flavor, alcohol, and carbonation -- putting these back would do a real number on you.

S- clear smell of spices and something else going on I can't quite put my finger on but definitely pleasant.  T- the taste of spices is as prominent as the smell. Definitely fruity with a strong sensation of alcohol. For some reason though, despite it's strength, it's very tasty and not unpleasant.  M - slightly on the thin side, but the carbonation adds a depth of character that makes this enjoyable to drink.  D- very drinkable although given how much you can taste the alcohol, almost two strong to have more than a bomber although it certainly screams ""drink 5 or 6 glasses of me.""

Aroma is bright and juicy.. estery apples, melon, candied fruits, caramel, maybe a hint of lemon, and just a little bit of bitters and malts linger in the background. Smells like a Belgian. You can tell its got some good potency. Getting excited..  This is delicious. Really, really tasty stuff. Bright, juicy fruits combine with a floral bouquet and just a hint of the buttered-biscuit malty goodness you expect with these Belgians. The juiciness is out of control complex, and it's hard to pinpoint it exactly- is that guava nectar, honey melon? Sweet and delicious. Nectar of the gods. Sugary tropical goodness.  Moderate in the body, it has a bit of a sticky, dry mouthfeel...which makes it extremely drinkable. All in all a very pleasurable ""Belgian"" experience.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Appearance: Hazy blonde color with a large, thin-looking white head that dissipates quickly but leaves some foam floating around and no lacing.  Smell: Strong yeasty smell with sweet/sour plum (probably the alcohol). Lots of breadiness.  Taste: Begins bready and a little sour, finishing with sour alcohol and a yeasty finish. Leaves behind lots of bready flavor in the back of the throat.  Mouthfeel: Thin to medium body with lots of carbonation (though it is well done carbonation, natural and not overpowering). The alcohol isn't very noticeable until after its swallowed, with a bit of a burn in the stomach (again, this isn't unpleasant). Dry finish.  Drinkability: This tripel may actually be better than most Belgian examples. A deceptively drinkable brew for its high ABV and one that, while full of flavor, could appeal to even those not as well exposed to craft beers.

Nice mouthfeel, slightly thick all the way through. Drinks very easy for an ABV of 9. The best canadian version of the style, maybe one of the best examples of the style period.

S: Smells yeasty with a tinge of citrus...a lot like a wheat beer -- even the clove is there. However there is a faint sweetness or fruitiness buried under the initial scents.  T: Tasty. Carbonation is immediately evident with light citrus and spicy cloves alongside. When this dissipates, a heavier breadiness sets in and carries the taste ever onwards. Peppery cloves are the highlight here, with the yeasty malts supporting the whole endeavour. The aftertaste is a little dry, a little bitter, a little bready, and holds my interest through to the next sip. Very good!  M: Brilliant! Engaging and inescapable. Spicy carbonation tickles the tongue delightfully.  D: Alcohol is well-concealed, the beer is delicious and drinkable. Recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Poured a lighty hazy straw gold color with a thick, tall, fluffy, white head that had great retention and just the right amount of lacing.  The aroma was great, yeasty, spicy, a hint of fruit and a great grain scent. On the tongue all those aspects were, if possible, amplified. Just what this style should be.  The body is full and well-rounded, without being heavy, cloying, sweet or annoying. Drinkability is, of course, nearly perfect. Crisp, interesting and as refreshing as a 9% brew can be, having several of these gorgeous creatures is easy.  Overall, this is only the second beer I've given all 5's to.

22,34,tjsdomer2,4.78,"Appearance: 2 inches of thick foam that looks (and tastes) like cappuccino foam. The foam fades away fairly quickly though, leaving a half an inch at the top of the glass. Coats the side of the glass with thick lacing throughout. La Fin Du Monde is pale yellow with a pink rosy tint, a trend I'm seeing in Belgian-style beers. This beer tends to look darker and pinker towards the top of the glass, and pure yellow at the bottom. As for the carbonation, I've never seen such an active beer. The bubbles don't merely float to the top and out of the glass, but they swirl like a storm throughout the entire drink, keeping it fresh and not flat. Unmatched.  Smell: Thick, starchy fruit. Bananas and a bit of acidity. Definitely some fermented grapes like a good (very) strong fine wine. Maybe some spiced apple as well?  Taste/Mouthfeel: Fairly acidic. Mostly bitter wine grapes with banana malt in the finish. The grapes translate into moderate hops while the banana translate into with yeasty malts. Despite the malty finish, the hops reasonate, especially towards the end. Seems a bit watery in the finish, but I'm not really complaining, and I'm only saying that because I'm really struggling to find something wrong with this. As you drink the finish gets even smoother so no worries here. Peppery bite to finish.  Drinkability: To quote Keri Hilson and Kanye West, ""It knocks you down"" very quickly, so definitely sip this. I recently tried Delirum Tremens, which has more alcohol. I have to say I definitely feel this quicker. Drink with caution.

Small hops addition is in their with the yeast and sweet malts. Delightfully tasty.  mouthfeel: medium bodied. smooth with a kind a velvet feel. I experience this in other belgian beers I have tried (chimay). Probably the best Belgian offering I have had to date.  drinkability: the abv (9%) is the only probelm with this, otherwise I could drink it all day. long.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Eastman2009,4.33,"Poured a hazy light colour into a pint glass. Lots of yeasty esters from the top, but nothing too distinct. Notes of sweet apple and traditional Unibroue mangoish scents.  Wonderful in the mouth with big citrus and fruity notes from the suspended yeast. It was very nice on a hot summer day and could be dangerously drinkable if I had more than the two I did at nine percent.  A fantastic effort and my favorite from the Unibroue stable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,joeland,4.67,appearance- a beautiful golden color with a small white head.  smell- avery citrus smell with other spices maybe corrinder seeds.  taste- corriender seed and citrus it taste much like the smell.  mouthfeel-a very bubbley mouthfeel.  drinkiability-could drink a lot of this it could sneak up on me.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,impending,4.24,"750ml into a snifter. Pours a hazy straw orange. Big fluffy heads recedes fairly quickly, nice lacing.  Very complex nose of the classic belgian kind. Doughy white bread yeast surrounded by light skin fruits and minor citrus.  Alcohol not very obvious.  Distinctive Unibroue yeast evident throughout the taste. Sweet but not as much as the scent led me to believe. The finish begins with a spike of dry then sweetens unexpectedly. Long lingering aftertaste encourages sipping. Medium bodied pleasant mouthfeel.  cheers jd",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Hampton77,5,"I'm no professional, but I simply had to speak my mind on this one.  This brew pours a light golden color with a decent head, settles to a nice lace that lasts the rest of the way through the glass.  The smell is fascinating. Balanced fruitiness with a little something wild and maybe even hoppy. Not sure how to describe my intrigue.  Taste is beyond expectation. Again wild and yet smooth. The fruitiness carries through followed by flashes of bitter then earthy finishing with an almost cleansing alcohol. I can't believe how drinkable this huge and complex brew really is. I just wish I had the words to describe everything it has to offer.  I would not recommend this beer to most of my non-ba friends as it would simply overwhelm the uninitiated. Edging quickly toward the top of my list.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,DeanMoriarty,4.52,"750ML corked bottle poured into a Chimay branded chalice.  A: Nice golden orange hue. Beer pours with a small head that dissipates quickly and leaves little to no lacing throughout the entire beer.  S: Smells like apple pie - sweet and spicy with fruit and vanilla.  T: Tastes like it smells and there's some hop there as well. For being 9% there isn't an over-dominating alcohol flavor. Overall extremely well balanced.  M: Medium bodied, low/medium carbonation and super creamy.  D: Real easy to drink for the high ABV. They serve this at a local restaurant I go to often, and I drink three every time without batting an eye.  One of the best tripel style beers out there. I put it up there with my all time favorite - Westmalle. The label boasts ""End of the World"" and I gotta say if it were coming to an end, this would be a beer I would consider going out on.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Freethyhops,4.57,"12oz bottle into a chalice  a- pours a bright gold with some nice yellow highlights when held to light. produced a pure white rocky head.  s- Complex with moderate spiciness, significant fruity esters reminiscent of tropical citrus fruit with possibly a slight banana character. Generous spicy phenols esters with only the slightest hop influence with some perfumy hop character. not getting much of any alcohol which is nice.  t- again alot of stuff going on. the spice has significantly picked up in the flavor. much lighter on the fruity esters with only a slight banana character. the citrus takes a seat quite far in the back. a bit of bitterness accompanies a dry finish.  m- the slightest amount of alcohol warming. high carbonation gives an evervescent feel to a smooth medium body.  d- a fantastic example of a Belgian Tripel for around $10/4pk. the ABV is exceptionally well masked and makes this a prime candidate for excessive consumption.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,appenzeller,3.25,"Pours an amber with orange and lemonade looks. Thick head that dissipates quickly leaving a common lacing.  Smells slightly sweet, apples, and moderate hoppiness.  For those who enjoy a beer that is based on sweetness and has some complexity on top of that, it's fine. For me, it's simply too sweet. Nice notes of lemon, cider, and tangy through the finish but I can't help but feel like I'm quaffing quintessentially glorified sugar water.  We all have our perspective. This beer just doesn't resonate with me. I realize this is a top shelf brew for many folks, for me it is just another flawed brew that aspires to greatness. Definitely not the ""fin"" of my ""monde."" Having Quebec ties I'd like this beer to be special but for me, it's not.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,HotHands,4.42,"Appearance - pours a bright yellow-orange with a 2-finger white head that comes down halfway and sticks around for a while.  Smell - complex smell with hints of malt and spiciness.  Taste - wow, there's a lot going on here. Starts off with a distinctive clove taste, followed by a complex combo of celery, minerals, orange zest, and a slight honey-like sweetness. Finishes crisp and a bit dry. It's amazing that so many synergistic flavors can come out of one beer. Tastes change a bit as it warms.  Feel - Highly carbonated and a bit creamy - thinner than I expected but not too much.  Drinkability - I never would have guessed this is 9% ABV. This beer hides its alcohol well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Richter35,4.9,"Finally taking the time to review one of my all time favourite beers; poured into a Leffe chalice.  Appearance is stunning to say the least. A bottle conditioned beer that is a beautiful orange-golden colour. It is cloudy as well, probably due to lack of filtration of the beer ingredients. Pours a bit of head that quickly subsides.  Smell is a wonderful mix of floral and fruit aromas. Very inviting and a good representation of what the first taste of the beer will hold.  Taste consists of a lot of fruit and some malt. Fruits that would be, more or less, the same colour as the beer itself [i.e. - apricot/pear/orange/etc.]. Alcohol is non-existant in taste, but you sure can feel it!  The mouthfeel is different. A thicker bodied beer, which is offset by a refreshing carbonated-citrus bite, that all leads to a dry finish. The dryness is no doubt caused by the massive alcohol content.  Drinkability for this beer is obviously it's strongest asset. To be consumed with the utmost respect, this beer is exceptionally smooth and always rewarding. One of the top 5 beers I've ever experienced... and I've ""experienced"" a lot of beer.  In my honest opinion, if you're talking value for your money, there are few beers in this world that can match it. The fact that it is Canadian made gives me great hope for the future of beer in my home country... world class indeed!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Clamwacker,4.51,"What can I say? It's ""the end of the world"". I haven't seen a better example of a Belgian tripel anywhere outside of Belgium.  The appearance is the only thing I am not a fan of. Considering the amount of excitement that I get out of corking a bottle of this brew, pouring it into a glass leaves me a tad disappointed. The head is short lived with relatively huge bubbles, and the color frankly makes me think of urinalysis test jars.  However, that is where the problems end! I want to offer this beer to a blind person to see whether or not their other senses make it even better than it already is.  The smell is as close to perfection as I can imagine. No words appropriately describe this, but if I had to use nasal experiences as adjectives, I would choose stomped grapes, freshly cut grass with notes of that first rain of late summer.  The taste follows the same, but there is the slightest bit of astringency at the end. This is not necessarily a bad thing. It really is dependent on serving temperature. The last few sips out of my pilsner glass are warmer because of my hand, and that is where the tiniest bit of off-flavor jumps out. Still, with a 4.5 in that category, you can see that it is almost entirely negligible.  The mouthfeel isn't the greatest thing ever; because of the large bubbles it doesn't flow to the back of the tongue as well as a true Belgian, but the flavor itself masks this ""problem"" extremely well. A 4 is the worst score I could imagine giving it.  As for drinkability, it is just amazing that this is a 9% ABV brew. Very few strong beers mask their alcohol this well. The only one I can think of off-hand is Widmer's Braggot, which is a vastly inferior brew to this (although good in its own right). Obviously this isn't something I would be able (or afford) to sit down and drink all night, but I'll be damned if it doesn't disappear with startling celerity.  If I may say so, I believe Unibroue (and this beer in particular) is the greatest thing to come out of Quebec, with Georges St. Pierre being the second greatest. :)  EDIT: I guess I'm not the only one who thinks the color is ""pissy"", based on the review before mine. Ha! Still, not a big deal.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ChadQuest,4.03,"This is a revisit of a beer i was unimpressed with a few years ago, Sometimes on the revisit i am blown away, Duval is one example.  Looks great, nice large pillowy puffy head. bone white. lots of lacing,a great looking beer.  Aroma is nice, pretty mild overall but pleasent non the less, peppery and mild esters.  Taste is solid yet mild which allows more then a few notes to play out. Spices of clove and crushed pepper, light dried banana, timid belgian yeast, very faint green apple, dry straw, and mandarin. none of these flavors dominate and they are all subtle and woven into each other.  Medium to high carbination gives a great mouthfeel that is just slightly dry but not very. The subtleness and complexities and easy and refreshing mouthfeel make this a good summer beer.  I did enjoy this much more this bottle around, perhaps its the warmer season, perhaps its because last time around i was drinking many RIS, or perhaps my pallete has devoloped enough to appreciate this more, maybe all three.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,kcr357,3.69,"Pours an unassuming hazy copper with a course foam that dissipates quickly to a light remnant leaving rings on the glass. Lots of sediment. Smells like bread, grass, wheat beer, and sweet malt. Tastes different from your average bmc, no doubt.Very malty, spicy, balanced if not lightly hopped. Smells and has a slight vanilla taste. Chewy, smooth, bitey from the high alcohol. 9.0 alc. makes for low drinkability. Very good, very strong.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BeerNemesis,4.67,"La Fin Du Monde | 750 ml. | 9.0% | 2010 vintage  Brewer: Unibroue Style: Tripel Glass: Chimay goblet  Presentation: Standard Belgian 750 ml. bottle with nice label art depicting Canada from a sort of 'god's eye view'. The cork and cap are quite nice.  Appearance: It pours a beautiful yellow-orange with an ample frosty, white head of about 1"". The head shrinks, but never quite disappears, leaving a hearty pillow atop liquid gold. Bubbles from carbonation joyfully stream upwards along the side of the glass.  Aroma: A delightful but pungent mix of nectarines and thick, peppery yeast swirl together in my nose. Phenolic cloves and the slightest touch of alcohol in the back.  Taste: Peppery cloves and hearty yeast mix with delicate nectarines, mango, and -- just as I imagined from the smell. I have to say that at first I was underwhelmed, but the flavors develop spectacularly, unraveling layers upon layers of complexity. The finish is thin, buts its laced with spices and cloves and a touch of hops. The aftertaste is powdery and a bit medicinally bitter. I can see why some may not like it, but I love it.  Mouthfeel: Its way thinner than expected, especially against comparable tripels. That being said, it is terrifically smooth, creamy and highly carbonated. It is an ethereal tripel -- not necessarily a bad thing, but a bit unexpected.  Harmony: Very well put together: light, complex, practically heavenly. It's an unusual tripel in that it is light and highly carbonated. Nonetheless, it's really spectacular.  Drink before: Oct. 1, 2010 Price: $7.29 at D'Agostino's",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Chizoad,3.93,"This is the 2nd time I've had this beer, and both times were a little underwhelming. I admit that the tripel style has never really been a favorite of mine, but this one, even for the style, just doesn't quite get there.  Good looking in the glass. A little surprising because it's much lighter in color than the usual tripel. Pretty carbonation that sort of streaks through the glass.  Light nose with nice malts but not much going on beyond the generally pleasant aroma. I pick up a little of the booze in it.  Very similar to the nose on the palate. There's a sweetness that doesn't dominate.  Good carbonation to go with a medium body. I love the effervescence in this.  Staggeringly drinkable. 9% ABV doesn't detract at all. Sure, I wish it fit my tastes a little bit better but deserves a wow for drinkability. It's definitely not a boring beer, which helps.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,rampole,4.38,"A Poured a cloudy harvest gold color with a three finger head with an aggressive pour. Head settled fairly quickly with a small amount of lacing on a generic goblet.  S Smell reminds me of Pinot Grigio. Apples straw and white grapes.  T Cloves, apples, lemon grass, just a hint of cayenne, and white grapes I also get a touch of tart clover the more i think about it.  M Fairly carbonated but well balanced.

22,34,mulder1010,4.57,"750 ML poured into a Great Divide Globe Glass  A-- Poured a cloudy straw yellow color. Yeast had not settled when pouring. Beer is also a bit too cold about 5-6 c. Short lived bright white head that became film too quickly. Very good head retention though and able to get a 1 finger head after a few swirls of the glass. Once warmer the beer holds the head much longer and shows more carbonation. Beer shows wine like legs of an upper ABV%.  S-- Sweet bread, apricot, white grape, green apple, banana, and clove. Citrus and apple come out more as it warms up. ABV is very well hidden with the aroma. Becomes more complex and the flavors change as it warms up. ABV is well hidden with the aromas.  T-- Large dose of sweet bread followed by banana, clove, and green apple. More it warms the citrus becomes a bigger player in this. Mostly lemon but a bit of pineapple as well.  M-- Highly carbonated, lively, and creamy. Sweet bread followed by citrus tartness to it. A bit of the apple crispness in the end. No real hop presence. Mostly about malt and the yeast. A little bit of an ABV burn at the end and it does get bigger as it warms up more.  D-- Highly drinkable. One 750 is sufficient at 9% or 2 330's are good. The 9 % is well hidden until the very end. The unique yeast strain makes this beer so special. So many flavors and that is beer can be one way cold and another way at room temperature. One of my favorite beers and to me the gold standard in Tripels. One I will seriously miss as long as I live in Australia. No longer distributed to Australia.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,patra7,4.57,"Served in a generic tulip glass, left to warm at about 7-8 degrees Celsius (45 Fahrenheit).  Appearance: Pale orange / amber body. White head, very fizzy, quick to rise (about 1 finger tall) and quick to dissipate.  Smell: Floral, grassy, lighly fruity aromas with a huge celery smell (I'm surpised to be the first one to describe it that way... this is ...clearly celery!). I could hardly smell the alcohol and this only after a few sips, when I managed to shove my nose into the glass. Very well hidden!  Taste: Same as above, together with a distinct maltiness. There is a touch of sweetness and just a small hint of sourness (which is a good thing for me since I don't like the overwhelming sour taste in other tripels).  Mouthfeel: Very aggressive carbonation from start to finish. It almost forces you to drink in small sips (which is a good thing because I might want to just gulp it down otherwise!). Full, heavy body.  Drinkability: ...and yet the whole thing is so lovingly drinkable! You only sense the alcohol once you get up. Incredibly complex and yet delicate.

Along with spices like coriander and Belgian yeast. There is also the most subtle sweetness to the smell .  T - Taste similar to smell. There is citrus lemon upfront with spices in the middle. And there is some slight bitterness at the end. There is a nice yeast flavor throughout. There is a nice balance of sweetness and bitterness. And great complexity.  M - Nice amount of carbonation, light body, very smooth and creamy.  D - Drinkability is great on this beer. I could drink it all night. It hides its ABV very well.

22,34,jpittman80,4.27,"A - Pale, hazy orange with a white head that lasts to the end. Apparently, this is a tripel!  S - Really nice spice: i pick up hints of flavors such as nutmeg, corianer, maybe cinnamon?, licorice, light hops, and bready malts. Very nice.  T - The flavor is a little smoother than the smell lets on. Everything is rounded off nicely. It's not as spicy as you'd expect, as the yeast seems to bring out a really bready, toasty quality, but they are definitely there bringing everything into balance.  M - Very smooth medium bodied. Medium carbonation.  D - This is quite a tasty tripel, probably my favorite that's not actually from Belgium.  I'm pretty sure that this was my first craft beer. I remember acquiring a bottle when I was 18, fresh in college, just because of the alcohol content. Well, I wasn't ready then.

Carbonation is right where I'd like it to be, I'd drink this almost any time of year in almost any setting.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,aasher,4.53,"Poured out of a twelve ounce bottle into a Guinness Stout pint glass at roughly 35 degrees.  Appearance: A light orange hue. Very cloudy and vibrant. Light, white head that quickly dissipates.  Smell: Smells like you'd dream a Tripel to smell. It smells both sweet and of yeast. There's a slight citrus scent to it.  Taste: Absolutely delicious. Tastes sweet and has a slight citrus appeal to the backend. The alcohol is just slightly present in the after taste.  Mouthfeel: Is overly smooth and boasts little carbonation (although present). Creamy almost. Is literally mouth watering.  Drinkability: Very, very drinkable. The taste is awe inspiring and it has the appearance of a serious Tripel. The flavor isn't overpowering and is exactly what you'd want from this Belgian. A four pack is definitely drinkable in one sitting. The alcohol does start to come out a little after you've finished your first.  This may be the best Tripel I've ever had. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for something both flavorful and refreshing for around $11, for a 4 pack. Those around me enjoyed this beer as well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BobZ,4.67,"330ml 11.2 Oz. bottle. Poured into a Duvel Tulip.  Appearance: Beautiful amber, rich head, excellent lacing.  Smell: Fragrant tripel, both sweetness and spice, (maybe a note of citrus) complexity is apparent.  Taste: Very rich tripel, deep flavor explosion sweet, spicy, & a hint of bitterness. Perfectly crafted and perfectly balanced, alcohol is so well masked it's practically non-existent.  Mouth feel: Well carbonated, unbelievably smooth.  Drinkability: Dangerous, goes down in seconds could drink it all night, of-course at 9% ABV a face-plant may be in the offing.  In my opinion, Unibroue is the only North American brewery that can come close to matching the Belgian flavor profile. They simply have figured it out. La terrible & Trois Pistoles are excellent (as is Blanche du Chambly) but Fin Du Monde is the crown jewel of what they do.  Excellent beer a ""must have on hand"" year round.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Also a very small hint of citrus/orange present.  T - A reverse, I get some citrus to start off, and a lingering spiciness. Balanced great though. A great beer going down.  M - Very ""full"". Not in a bad way either. Seems to be a lot going on with this brew. Can actually feel the spiciness in the mouth. Which for La Fin Du Monde, is definitely not a bad thing.  D - Love the taste of this beer. I think it's extremely drinkable, despite it's high abv. And as alcoholic and heavy as it is, I could drink many of these in one sitting (although not recommended).

S: Loads of Belgian yeast and bread. That yeast gives it wonderful sour undertones once the ale has warmed up. Nice spice, coriander (?), typical Belgian spicy character. Honeysuckle comes through as the brew heats up. Slightly metallic.  T: That load of yeast shines bright on the palate. Lots of butter and honeysuckle. Awesome! No metal comes through, which I was sort of anticipating. A little sweet but very pleasant. Reminds me of a Sunday morning with waffles and butter and fresh strawberries.  M: Awesome! Huge!

Medium bodied with good carbonation - feels quite nice across my entire palate.  D. This is an easy to drink beer that is very enjoyable. Keeps you warm from the first sip. A wonderful sipper.

22,34,BeerAndBourbon,3.71,"A. Pours a watery yellow with large white bubbles that fade almost instantly and leave little-to-no lacing. S. Smells strongly of wheat with citrus (orange and lemon); almost like a hefeweizen on steroids. T. The alcohol bites up front with lemon oil and coriander. The middle is dominated by a malty sweetness. The end is quite yeasty and dry. M. Sharp bite up front from alcohol and a high level of carbonation. While the beer itself is quite thin, the high level of carbonation allows the beer to coat your tongue and appear to be dense. D. I'm not a fan of the prickling sensation provided with each sip; it takes away the pleasant sipping quality that I generally associate with a tripel.  While I appreciate the flavor and taste characteristics this beer has to offer, I'm not a fan of the very high level of carbonation in terms of appearance or mouthfeel. I'd like to try this on cask.  Edit: As the beer warms (and some of the carbonation dissipates), the beer becomes much more pleasurable and boozy. This only confirms that this would be splendid drawn from a cask.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Excellent retention. Good lacing.  Smell: Kind of vegetable-y in that funky Belgian way; very nice. Some alcohol too. There are some citrus tones as well.  Taste: Oh... yeah, this is nice. Yeasty malts combine with fruity, citrusy hops to make this a really damn tasty ale. It's got the perfect amount of alcohol presence on the palate, and it's pleasantly warming going down. I get some tangy, kind of grassy bitterness too. You want to sip this and really savor it; there's a lot to explore here.  Mouthfeel: Rather full-bodied; it coats the mouth well.  Drinkability: Outstanding! I am really, really enjoying the hell out of this, and it reminds me why top-quality Belgian-style beers are second to none.  This is utterly fantastic.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Spineypanda,4.2,"Pours a hazy golden straw with a decent little head that retains for some time. Smells of slight alcohol and some banana i think, or some sort of fruit.

A good tripel from Canada!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,CHADMC3,4.45,"This tripel reveals a murky golden body with a frothy white head that leaves only faint hints of lacing after it dissolves.  The aroma consists of generous yeast and citrus, fairly sweet, and also offers some spices, likely clove, and almost peppery also.  The flavor is very similar to the aroma with abundant yeast up front, sweet citrus fruit in the background, and again spices such as clove and faint pepper at the finish.  Medium in body with generous carbonation and plenty of character to bury the abv that let's you know it lingers in the background.  This is just a great beer.

22,34,Gorgoroth,4.92,"""best by"" date: 09-24-12  glassware: La Fin du Monde branded tulip  A - gentle pour yields hazy, deep gold body with huge, dense, white head, which dissipates fairly quickly into a thin, white halo and an opaque film with large islands of lace; really no carbonation to be seen  S - nose is strong with Belgian yeast and malt; intense floral scent shrouds citrus, sweet spices, and banana  T - up front with yeast and malt; citrus flavors such as grapefruit and orange peel understate; the finish is very dry with a notable hop bitterness and lingering, mellow notes of whole-grain toast  M - medium body with a crisp palate; effervescent and tingly, despite lack of noticeable carbonation; finishes dry with a glowing alcohol warmth  D- extremely drinkable; complex and strong, yet very inviting  I've had this beer numerous times now and I always feel like I could drink several bottles in a row, though the 9% abv might make that difficult. There's really almost nothing in this beer that could be improved upon, and at less than three dollars a bottle, it's an absolute steal. A true gem of the beer world.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,grittybrews,4.38,"Pours a rich golden orange into a Chimay chalice with a finger of long-lasting creamy white head. Lovely aroma of flowers, citrus, yeast, and banana.  High carbonation and an immediate burst of full flavor throughout the mouth, with prominent banana, yeast, green apple, and a hint of clove on the finish. Really delicious and fully flavored without being cloying (though it is quite sweet). The higher ABV is mostly present just upon tasting, giving this beer a pleasant dry champagne quality.  A wonderful Belgian and probably my favorite from Unibroue, though the robust flavor usually leaves me satisfied at just one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,phiberoptik,4.27,"Very nice find for us as we always want to try something new. Surprisingly we found this at our local Kroger store (major regional grocer).  Pours golden orange with a spongy/soapy head. Lighter than I expected, but no disappointment.  I can smell unknown spices, yeast, and some malts. I catch a nose full of alcohol also.  Tastes like a hodgepodge of spices, I didnt think of it when I was drinking it but after reading others' thoughts, I can see where the banana comes in. A lot of yeast in the flavor as well.  Definitely drinkable and we didnt think the spiciness was too much, although far different from the high hop beers that usually sit in our fridge.  Mouthfeel gives you a sting from the spice and a sting from the alcohol. Enjoyable but at the other end of the spectrum in regards to mouthfeel compared to a Wit or other low-carbonation beer.  For the price, we will enjoy this one again!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,gromis,3.35,"I got this after a recommendation from a friend.  This pours a nice gold color. Not too much head, but the carbonation lasts a long time.

Thin soapy head a couple fingers high that dissipated quickly to a beautiful thin and creamy looking layer, that remains with the beer. Hazy golden orange colour, just beautiful So much spice in the nose with some banana and cloves, almost hefe-like underneath the spices, a bit of yeast and some alcohol. Tastes similar, alcohol is there, very spicy (complex spicy!) and carbonated, and leaves some yeast lingering on the tongue after the fact. Love the way this tastes, but the lingering yeast taste does detract a bit and the spice might be overpowering in some instances. Great freakin' beer and one of my favourites. A definite go-to when I'm at the liquor store.  EDIT: 750ml bottle dated on Sept 21, 2009; enjoyed on July 31, 2011. Excellent retention, good lace. Gold colour; mildly cloudy. Effervescence is high and flavours are fairly transient on the palate. Ripe pear, light green apple and some tropical fruits appear and disappear rapidly.

But, subjective as taste is, I really enjoy this beer. It is spicy, it has a high ABV, which I like, but you cannot drink too many. The carbonation is quite high as well.  Drinkability is HIGH, but that ABV will bite you if you aren't careful.  Crisp, spicy, clean. EXCELLENT BEER that I would hightly recommend to anyone.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S: Cloves and banana are most up front followed by light spiciness, maybe a little bit of pepper? After a few minutes the head has dissipated to a nice foam.  T: A slight amount of the banana aroma is also noticed in the taste. There is quite a bit of yeastiness and maltiness. A taste almost similar to that of a biscuit. The pepperiness is also tasted with some hops that are very lightly present on the finish.  M: Medium to high carbonation, very smooth feeling. Definitely feels fairly bready.  D: Very drinkable, the taste and mouthfeel leave one desiring another sip. With the high ABV, the drinkability will quickly catch up to you.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Clear, golden, honey colour.  Smell: Peppery, alcohol esters, cloves, faint hint of berries somewhere.  T: Lots of pepper clove and alcohol again. I agree with an earlier poster - I think I would have liked a bit more hops at the end to balance the alcohol - but what do I know?  M: A little too carbonated for me. It's almost champagne-like which is kind of unexpected.  D: It's delicious, but in the words of Dave Chapelle/Samuel L. Jackson - ""This sh** will get you drunk"". So be careful. But Enjoy!  Also - Unibroue beers and great value for such high quality. At least here in Ontario. At the beer store, six pack of the stuff are no more expensive than any other premium beers, and I believe the 750ml are 5.95 (?)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,damndirtyape,4.28,"Single bottle (best by 07-14-12) poured into a Rochefort Goblet.  Appearance: Poured very slowly to keep the sediment out. The color is a hazy golden orange with a persistent white foam across the top of the glass. Some lacing noted. Plenty of bubbles coming up through the beer when held up to the light.  Smell: All sorts of smells - hard to place any of them. Earthy yeast, fruit, hints of alcohol, cooked pasta, maybe even a hint of animal (reminds me of my cat right now) deep in there. Not unappealing, but weird to me. I detected some hops early on when the beer was first poured, but it went away as it warmed up.  Taste: Equally complex (but tasty) in flavor compared to the smell. Hints of orange and raisin, along with some hops, bready/yeasty flavors, sweet flavors, and a citrus/bitter finish with some lingering aftertaste. Alcohol is not notable at all - hidden in all the other flavors. Quite nice.  Mouthfeel: Can a beer be fleeting in mouthfeel? Well, this one is. It's there with a hint of carbonation on the tongue and you knows it there, but after the swallow I swear it's completely gone. Like I never had it. Cleansing and crisp I think is the way to describe it. Wow - I've never had anything like this before.  Drinkability: For me this is an experience beer. Too strong and expensive to have all the time, but perfect with a meal (French ragout beans with couscous and goat cheese) and for savoring after the meal is done. Very nice overall.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Naugros,4.38,"Cloudy, as a trippel should be, with a luscious, fluffy head that dissipates slowly, but is retained in a thin film. Color has a golden/orange glow.  The Belgian characteristics come through in the aroma. Get a full whiff as the Belgian hops and yeast play!  Most of the flavor hits the mid-tongue and the sides of the upper palate. This is one of the best representatives of the style I've come across, but I must admit to my limited experience. The bitterness of the hops dominate and the yeast strain adds the expected overtones from this style.  Very up front with it's flavors. The lingering aftertaste is not unpleasant and brings you back for another taste. It doesn't overwhelm with body or heaviness, but is nicely balanced and not at all ""thin"".  As mentioned above, this beer will leave you wanting another swig and the 9.0% ABV will shortly have you regretting that this beer is very drinkable.  If comparing with another North American brewed trippel (Golden Monkey or Merry Monks come to mind), then you're going to want to limit the sample size and be sure to share. Your tasting will surely end quickly as this beer brings you back for another glass time and again and will render you incapable of taking the simplest of notes.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,FeDUBBELFIST,4.42,"Bottle to oversized wine glass. Best before date 3/20/11.  A: Pours with a huge snow white head which has decent retention. Very fizzy with big bubbles. The body is lightly cloudy, light in color and somewhere in between yellow and golden orange. No lacing.  S & T: Lightly toasted grains of bread and straw. Average hop content, fragrant and floral. Yeast derived spiciness plus floral and fruity esters. Fruit flavors include white grape, apple and pear, ripe and fermented. Moderately sweet with a small hand of sneaking alcohol. Well endured finish.  M: Spot on. The sweetness manages to linger on until the bubbles scrape the tongue clean. Finishes dry. Carbonation is BIG, both lively and fizzy. The body is deceptively light.  D: La Fin Du Monde is the most solid offering from Unibroue's standard line up and was one of my original craft stand-bys. I remember marveling at the price ($7 for a bottle of beer?!?!), the ABV (Holy shit! This is like 2 drinks in one!) and how, after only two beers, I'd be walking crooked back to my apartment. Nowadays, after two, I just sit crooked in my house.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bsp77,4.22,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Snifter.  Appearance: Hazy light orange with billowing head that quickly dissolves into a thin white layer.  Smell: Strong banana, some clove, citrus and peppery hops. Great semi-sweet fruity and spicy aroma overall.  Taste: Sweet banana and clove upfront, which then broadens to include slightly sour, almost wheat-like malts. Ends with a long lingering fruity and peppery finish. The cloves stay fairly prominent throughout.  Feel: Very effervescent, chewy body, with a dry finish. Slightly warming overall. Not a huge fan of the effervescent/chewy combination, although this improved a lot as the beer sat in the Snifter.  Drinkability: Very strong example of a Tripel, which I could certainly have many more times. However,the body slightly misses the mark for me, and I could have used a touch more hops and a touch less clove.

Pours hazy light orange, TONS of carbonation in this thing...pour this one easy, the head builds up crazy fast. Fluffy pillow of white head stays at 2 fingers for a while, a cap covers it the whole time leaving good lacing. Lots of peppery yeast and light fruits in the nose. Apple, peach, a little grassy. Definitely let this sit for a few minutes before sipping or the carbonation will kill you. The peppery yeast and spice is very up-front in the taste which may turn some people off, but I like it. Many great flavors are there such as clove, green apple, banana. A bit of a medicinal feel which seems common in tripels I've had. There is a nice subtle sugary sweetness. Booze is a little hot at first but nearly disappears after some time. Great aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good, the extreme carbonation dies down after a few minutes. Like a good tripel, the alcohol is well-hidden. Very easy to drink, 12 oz is not enough, 750ml is a perfect amount for this. Good price for the quality. Excellent stuff, but I think Allagash Tripel remains my favorite for the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,EbPhrygian,4.48,"I had first tried La Fin Du Monde some months ago with a lovely pasta dinner and was thoroughly impressed. The following is an official review. Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a snifter (really need to acquire a proper tulip glass...)  Appearance: A beautiful light amber hue that gradates slightly at the edges (can't really see through it in the middle of the glass). Leaves a sizable just-off-white head and appears wonderfully effervescent. The head isn't terribly thick or pillowy, and doesn't stick around for all that long, but can easily be rejuvenated with a gentle swirling of the glass. The bubbles will just not go away, either. Here's a funny/interesting observation: this beer SOUNDS appealing, by which I mean the process of pouring and of swirling the beer produces a crackling sound similar to that of Rice Krispies when doused with milk.  Smell: Banana notes and a peppery spiciness, which have been mentioned by other reviewers, are certainly there, too. After tasting, it becomes clear that not all the complexities of the beer are present in the aroma.  Taste: Yeasty, biscuity, and sweet. Hop bitterness and malt character are subdued.  Mouthfeel: Pleasant carbonation mixed with sweet smoothness give this brew a high rating.  Drinkability: Could not be higher, really. This is a strong beer but does not taste that way. Still, this is not for chugging.  Notes: My first tripel was Victory's Golden Monkey, which I won't ever be buying again. This is because the combination of Unibroue's availability, price, and sheer quality (a reflection of exceptional craftsmanship) cannot be overstated, and are simply unbeatable. Though I know there are probably superior Belgian Tripels out there, I also know I won't be able to help measuring other examples against this outstanding specimen.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BabyBastard,4.3,"750mL cork and caged, best by date of 9/17/12, poured into a chalice a pale, golden straw colour, white and thin foamy head that doesn't cling well to the sides. Never ending stream of bubbles rise from the etching. Great looking brew. Smells of bananas and a bit of alcohol. Seems to have a spicy nose to it, more complexities that I can't seem to filter out. Overall, a very pleasing scent comes with this brew. Taste is great. Has that hint of banana and clove, truly appetizing. A bit of alcohol warmth follows up, but is a bit difficult to detect, possibly making this brew a dangerous one. Triple fermentation process gives this a nice tingly feel on the palate, though it is ultra smooth on the way down. This could be the End of the World, if consumed unwisely. The drinkability on this one is unbelievably high, especially for an ale of this strength. Two bottles of this wouldn't seem unreasonable, until after you finished the second. Then you may wish the world was ending. But who knows about that, I've only consumed one bottle. My world seems to be fine right about now.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Holy Carbonation Batman! There was a surprisingly excellent head on this drink. Very soapy. It never actually dissipated.  Smell: Very fruity. Banana notes hit me right away as well as a light peppery smell.  Taste: Very fruity almost bubblegum-like. But the taste fit. You can taste the yeast and the peppery notes right away. It didn't taste as strong as I thought it would.  Mouthfeel: Pretty good. No complaints here. The sweetness of the brew kicked in here.  Drinkability: Very smooth.

Constant show of bubbles continues throughout which keeps a good amount of head in tact the entire time.  S: Very fruity, banana and orange; bubblegum; spicy and yeasty. Not a hefty alochol smell, considering.  T: Very consistent with the aroma; fruity and spicey. Mostly banana and citrus and spicy yeastiness. Very slight mild hop at the end, along with the alcohol coming through, but still doesn't hit like it's ABV would indicate.  M: Full-bodied, slightly chewy. The persistent bubbles that look so nice in this brew, kind of give it a bit too much in the carbonation department for me.

Poured from a 750mL bottle under compression with a cork topper into a tulip flared glass. The colouration is pale yellow and the head white, predominant throughout the enjoyment, which was light, fluffy and thick at the same time.  Aroma is fruity, mildly yeasty and citrus notes are apparent. Mild, and I mean mild hoppiness is present.  The taste is unparalleled! Wonderful characters of honey and of all things a sense of birch bark, wintergreen, dog grass, ginger, juniper, licorice, sarsaparilla, yucca and cherrita.  The palate is excited with the chewey feel of the brew and non-overpowering feel of the higher alcohol.  Very easy to drink, yet the alcohol can hit you, like a bottle of VQA chardonnay. But, this brew is exceptional to a connoisseur or the lay person. It truly is wonderful to enjoy a taste or a bottle.  Cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Very attractive looking beer.  The smell really blew me away. It's so alive and fragrant. I get a deep fruity focus, lighter fruits like tangerines and white grapes with a touch of floral qualities.  Taste wise this kind of reminds me of a sweeter, more highly carbonated American Pale Ale.this is very good. it hides the alcohol extremely well, but you still know you're drinking a beer.  It has a really champagne or sparkling wine feel to it for me. lighter bodied, kinda airy and effervescent.

Tilts and swirls weave thick stable laces on the walls as the firm white head slowly recedes to form a solid cover. The sniffing session reveals intense and complex aromas of citruses (mainly orange), banana and bubble gum - which is not surprising as wheat is one of the principal ingredients, clove, faint pepperiness, refined sugar and perceivable alcohol. The sweet malty body with clovey phenolic character embraces intense citrusy esters which whip the palate with bites of orange, alcohol clearly shows itself, bitter ending probably due to abundance of yeast derived phenolics. The medium body is crispy but this is somehow balanced by wheaty texture of the beer that tends to create dextrinous coatings on the lips.

Slightly medicinal aroma, with citrus highlights - particularly lemon. Very yeasty.  A little spicy, but what I didn't enjoy the high amount of yeast in this one.

Anyway, a terrific mix of sweet malt and bready yeast, leaving the smell at the same time smooth but very earthy (what I reawwy wuv about twipels). The usual fruit players make their appearance as well: banana, apple and pear are most readily noticable. Bright and crisp.  T: Take a big gulp, and it's a bit too overwhelming. But, take it slow, a sip at a time, and the subtlties of the taste come through. I love the earthy yeast, but the fruits really make the beer special. The above fruits are there but also orange. The malts make it sweet and smooth, but there is a very crisp and hidden hoppy bitterness I wasn't expecting. Hops, malts and yeast working together at last for the greater good.  M: Very carbonated feel. It's just personal taste, but they went with the punchy feel to highlight the fruits and hops when I wish they had gone with a smoother feel to highlight the malts and yeast.

Golden in color, very clear, looks clean and crisp.  S- Wonderful grain smell, honey, golden raisins, pineapple, a citrus note of something very light in here as well.

The citrus that I smelled comes though in the taste, not hop citrus but something a bit more subtle. Bready with a light sweet honey added. The flavors are very delicate, almost too delicate for the carbination. I don't know how well this would last in terms of longer then a year and a half.

T - great, thick, full flavored taste...accentuates all that was mentioned concerning the aroma.  M - rich smooth and thick yet still very bubbly, near perfect for carrying the complexity...not to light/swift as to miss anything, nor to syrupy/slow to have any one flavor component linger in a lack of balance.  D - Impressive. The actual, true champagne of beers, at least craft beers. High ABV suggests to enjoy slowly. But it's so good that's actually a little tough to do.  One of the rare ones for me which rivals any food pairing at all. Can be enjoyed strait up alone...or with anything you wish to cut with the dryness of a Tripel. To be savored, sipped.

22,34,DefenCorps,4.37,"I picked up a bottle at State Line this past weekend. Best by 24 Sept 2012, so does this mean it was bottled 24 Sept 2009?  In my Duvel tulip, this beer loos about as gorgeous as Duvel itself. Crystal clear 24 carat gold with a dense, billowy white head with excellent retention and some lacing, this beer is resplendent.  The nose is excellent as well. There's no mistaking the prominent Unibroue yeast character, with its spiciness and sweetness, mildly akin to rising bread. Behind that is a blend of honey, a light sugar sweetness, and a blend of spices - clove, a little nutmeg and some white pepper. Definitely fruity, there's some red apples, some apricot and what at varying times brings to mind passion fruit, kiwi, citrus and maybe even mango. Alcohol is noticeable as well. This is about as fruity as this style gets, I guess.  The palate is surprisingly tame given how incredible the nose is. Opening with a light cracker-like sweetness with some sugar and honey, there's a delicate ripe orange character, some mild floral notes as well. Moderately yeasty, this really reminds me of rising bread. This character is especially noticeable mid-palate, along with some phenols. Spices are present as well, with a blend of clove and white pepper. Bigger in body than I like for the style (I love 'em bone dry), this beer is medium-light, with a high level of carbonation. It also doesn't seem as well-knit as it could be. The finish is quite excellent, with a touch of alcohol, fruit, spice and yeast. Very drinkable stuff, this. Also very delicate, and needs to be consumed on a clean palate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JohnL9013,4.42,"A: Golden orange, cloudy. Small head, surprisingly.  S: Light citrus smell, large malt smell. Very pleasant aroma.  T: Unexpectedly good taste...this company knows how to make a Belgian beer. Not totally balanced, there are citrus flavors that tend to poke through but otherwise very homogeneous and complex. It also warms up extremely well, revealing even more flavors.  M: Not carbonated enough for this style, but otherwise very agreeable to rolling around.  D: Very drinkable, but just short of absolute smoothness. High abv. is hidden extremely well, though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,irisier,4.2,"Served from a 750 ml champagne style bottle with an illustration of Quebec on the label. Freshness date printed on back.  Appearance: Golden body colour with a cider appearance. Fairly fizzy whitish head that subsides to a thin patchy lace that's maintained by the high carbonation.  Smell: Sweet fruity and slightly floral aroma with a character similar to a Hefeweizen. Also a faint caustic alcohol smell that is pretty well hidden.  Taste: Slightly sweet and fruity upfront. Some grainy and wheat flavours come through and finishes with some dry flowery hops that is amplified with a unique type of bitterness. Sharp alcohol bitterness that amplifies the hop flavours and makes this brew finish dry, as well as reminding you to take it slow and easy with this brew, lest you become legless before the night is over.  Mouthfeel: Pretty light for such a high alcohol brew. Very refreshing though, with a tingly high carbonation level that was reminiscent of champagne.  Notes: This goes down real easy for a high gravity brew. I shared this bottle with a friend and we finished it a lot faster than I expected and were kinda tipsy towards the end. Respect the brew as they say. Overall a good beer. Well balanced and tasty. Also I would suggest this as a good beer for the craft brew fan who is uninitiated into the world of Belgian style beers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Pour - holy hell...looks like orange jello in a glass. Thick, cloudy and doesnt move, sits like its got the viscosity of gelatin. Head is thick - 2 fingers - with medium sized bubbles and a slow, sustainable topper that (spoiler) smells and tastes great.  Nose - heady wheat, fruity and crisp and a nice mellow tang  Taste - Again, trying to remain objective and not be overly enthusiastic but this beer is absolutely amazing. Top three beers I have ever tasted in my life. A cacophony of flavors ranging from high malt, spices like cinnamon, coriander and lavender and a constant bitter- wheat makes this beer, utterly, the whole entire package. Look for berries, bananas and (dare I say it) a hint of mint on the finish. Put me to bed...  Mouthfeel - undeniably smoothe. Fantastic carbonation makes the flavors even more savory. The appearance makes you think this one wont be easy to take - totally wrong. This one is nice and easy.  Drinkability - the only thing keeping this from being a session beer is the price. Totally worth it though.  In my top three beers of all time.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ericj551,4.17,"La Fin Du Monde pours a hazy straw gold with a lively, fluffy head. The aroma is light and fruity, with plenty of yeasty phenolic character and some alcohol coming through. The flavor is sharp and sweet upfront. Lots of light, faintly tropical fruitiness. The sharp phenolic flavor sticks around and lingers in the aftertaste. Alcohol flavor comes through but it's mild for the strength. Not only is this a great beer, but I think it's the best value in Ontario.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Sheets of clingy white lace are left during the entire drink.  Aromas were mostly banana and clove yeastiness. Slightly musty with some ripe fruit as well.  Taste is a sweet and bready malts upfront, with the clove spice being secondary. Light alcohol sweetness and warmth in the finish, but its pleasant and not harsh.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the carbonation gives the impression that the flavors dance on the palate. Drinkability is good.

Very nice and the alcohol is very well hidden.  m - Medium body and moderate carbontion.  d - A very nice tripel. Great fruity smell and taste and the high ABV doesn't affect the drinkability at all.

Sweet, clove, white pepper, apple and perhaps a little banana. The flavor has a surprising tart sour apple zing to it that makes this beer quite refreshing. Plenty of clove, pear and apple meld with sweet pale malt. Alcohol is perceivable, but does not take away from the beer's flavor. Flavors added by the yeast seem to be the star of the show. Medium body with ample carbonation that lends to a luxuriously effervescent mouthfeel. Finish is tart and dry. This beer is refreshing, but I would not necessarily say it is remarkably drinkable. A very well made beer, but not one of my favorites from this brewery.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Mancer,4.36,"This beer poured (into a Brooklyn Brewery Tulip) a beautiful hazy yellow amber, with an amazing 3 finger width, white head. There were lots of bubbles seen and remained active for most of the beer's life. The head took quite a while to dissipate and eventually did so to a one finger width thickness. The lacing on the glass was thick and clung to the glass up until time to wash the glass. The initial smell of this brew was that of fruits, champagne and slight hint of alcohol. The initial taste was that of fruits, malt, champagne, and some possible floral notes. The beer had a light to medium body with a nice bite of the carbonation, and actually felt quite strange on the tongue (strange good, to me) even after it had been swallowed. What really knocked my socks off with this beer was its presentation and mouth feel. Absolutely fantastic beer, and one that could get none beer drinkers a second thought about the realm of craft beers. Will definitely buy this again/always be stocked with this.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,epicness,3.98,"A - Hazy golden orange. Fluffly head that dissipates rather quickly to about a 1/8"" of foam. Can see all kinds of stuff floating around the beer. It looks very similar to a standard hefeweizen.  S - Kind of smells like chalk and flowers. A little bit of citrus hint to it also. Slight alcohol scent also.  T - Sweet. Very sweet. It's a very balanced beer. Fruit mixed with wheat, with some light hops. Coming from a guy that doesn't like the bite of alcohol, I didn't taste it at all which is very surprising based the ABV level.  M - Medium carbonated and medium bodied. Starts off with a hard and crisp feel but smooths out rather quickly.  D - I feel that is has a very high drinkability which is bad because the alcohol will definitely sneak up on you and crush you. Could easily put this beer down in a few minutes, although I would recommend not too.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Scrapss,4.73,"Finally, La Fin Du Monde. One of the best beers ever made.  Appearance: hazy like a weissebier. It has an undercurrent like a properly prepared Black and Tan. Thick head dissipates into 1/8"" thick pure white foam. Lacing is nearly ideal for the style. Particulates are present. Has legs.  Smell: sweet, slightly chalky texture, then incredible and utterly complex. Nectar of the gods.  Taste: think of the best hefeweisen you ever tasted. It's better. It's insanely sweet then drifts into the palate like nothing else on the planet. It changes character as it descends, first sweet wheat beer-like, then hot boozy then it gives off a light-sweet-tangerine essence for 10 seconds and then it's gone in a lingering sweet finish.  Mouthfeel: coating and filling, almost to the point of cloying but not annoyingly so. Medium cabonation prevents over-saturation.  Drinkability: As good as it is...it is another deceivingly smooth high ABV beer. You might try to session it but you'd fail. Simply enjoy it in extreme moderation.  La Fin Du Monde is quite simply one of the best beers ever made. I highly recommend it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,feelmefoam,4.25,"Pours a bright, effervescent gold with plenty of carbonation running around and a beautiful, cloudy white head that pushed up well over two inches on the pour. Nice retention from the head and when it finally dissipates it leaves thick, foamy rings of lace draped all down the glass. A very inviting looking beer that got a few extra points from the head it put up.  The aroma, probably helped by the extra head La Fin put up, was also very enticing. A fruit basket of 'flavors' mixed with that distinct banana-clove spiciness is prevalent, as well as a bit of unidentified spiciness and some wheat scent that float in less assertively. Very fragrant, you can smell this beer as soon as you pop the top.  The flavor is good, just not as good as the nose or appearance. Similar banana-clove and wheaty fruit flavor to many other Belgians, but sweeter and less spicy on the tongue than some others I've tried. Not necessarily a bad thing, just a bit different. Still, a very tasty beer that isn't hard to drink at all.  I like the mouthfeel. Not thin or watery at all, it's on the slightly thicker side of medium and despite the carbonation present on the initial pour it's very smooth. The carbonation seems to counter some of the effects of the 9% ABV because there is absolutely no hint of alcohol during each draught.  Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. My whole bomber was gone in about 20 minutes. Sweet and slightly spicy with a smooth finish (and a looker to boot) this is definitely a beer to try and maybe one to make your Top Whatever list if you're a big Belgian fan. Good stuff, Canada.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,DAllspaw,3.9,"poured into tulip a light straw color with tiny bubbles racing up the glass, a la champagne.  Slightly sweet cakelike smell with subtle funky yeast, certainly not overpowering. Great mouthfeel, coats the palate and roof of mouth, hell I even feel it coating my teeth. The lingering taste is very nice. Seems a bit thin overall though, causing the alcohol to stand out a shade more, but very solid nonetheless.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ncfranklin,4.07,"Serving Type : Bottle poured into a Weizen Glass.  Appearance : Pours a bright yellow and slightly translucent, but gains a orange layer when the yeast from the bottom hits, eventually settling into a light orange and very murky. A small peach colored head, about 2 fingers, lingers breifly before settling completely. No lacing.  Smell : Whole lot of berry, with hints of peach. A pleasant smell.  Taste : The berry pokes through almost immediately with a crisp bite, before settling. The alcohol greets you if you allow it to wallow in your mouth for any time, but eventually dies off. Enjoyable to feel it change from almost fruity with a crisp cut, to very soft and light.  Mouthfeel : As stated above. A hard crisp beginning, smoothing over to a fluffy feel.  Drinkability : For a 9%, very good. If swallowed quickly, you'll never feel it. If slowly enjoyed, the alcohol pokes through mid-way in taste, but fades for the finish.  Overall, I like this beer. It's a challenge to describe, so it gets bonus points for confounding the senses. The high abv% shouldn't turn anyone off, as it is very well balanced with flavors.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Aroma of spice, sweet fruit, some delicate dark fruits, some grassy/lemon peel notes.  Sweet, powdered yeast, some juicy fruits again in the middle, with a very light bitter that touches down toward the end. A little bit of alcohol spice throughout, and the fruit shines through at the end again, leaving the mouth watering a bit. Some vinous flavor at the finish as well, with some rum raisin as well.  Mouthfeel is smooth and luscious, not thick or syrupy. Very refreshing, fluffy and velvety on the palette.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Liverpool08,4.35,"Another reason to love this style. Pours a pale cloudy orange with small thin head. Smell of belgian yeast, cloves. spices. Flavor follows with super smooth spices, cloves, bananas and funk. This tripel seems a bit smoother then some others. It doesn't have the big Belgian punch of others, yet it is still an outstanding example of the style. The alchohol is VERY well hidden and would be very easy to drink several of these.

22,34,BeanBone,4.03,"Appearance: A thoroughly hazy golden-orange body capped by a mountain of fluffy white head that recedes slowly and leaves great lacing. Certainly a Belgian looking beer.  Aroma: Cloves, floral perfume, juicy citrus, golden fruit, grainy malt, Belgian yeast, and medium alcohol.  Flavor: A mix of golden fruit, pepper, mild hops, and medium alcohol character over sweet wheat-like pale malt. Everything is nicely balanced. Golden fruit, grainy malt, and mild booze in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-light bodied and creamy with medium-high carbonation and a dry finish. Some nice heat from the alcohol.  Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable, this goes back quicker than the ABV would lead you to believe.

22,34,zoso493,4.18,"Poured from a 750 ml corked and caged bottle into a Chimay chalice.  Appearance: La Fin du Monde is a beautiful, radiant orange that is fairly light in hue but still very hazy. It's crowned by a bubbly but thick two-finger head that has decent retention. The head stays around for awhile as a nice coating of the surface of the beer, probably with aid of the laser etching in my glass.  Smell: This is an extremely fruity-smelling tripel but it works well. There is a large orchard-fruit smell that consists of apple, pear and lemon and orange peel. It also has a pleasant graininess to it that smells as if it's coming from the pear. There is something, however, that causes me to associate a bit of artificiality with the scent and I suspect it may be the yeast. It's not a bad smell by any measure, but in my mind it's not authentic.  Taste: The orchard fruit are still the primary goodies in the taste but the grains are a bit more pronounced in the taste then they are in the scent. La Fin du Monde has all the essential ingredients for a tripel, but there just seems to be some indistinguishable chasm between this and a genuine Belgian example. I'm not bashing the beer, as it is very good and notably refreshing, but it has some catching up to do with other beers that were brewed in the homeland.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel in this beer is lovely for the style. It's crisp and extremely dry, which is exactly what a tripel calls for. It's not too thick and it's highly carbonated, but I have no room to grumble.  Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer considering it's 9% ABV. I'm taking my time with this 750 ml bottle, but I'm not noticing the alcohol and am enjoying every sip of it.  Overall, La Fin du Monde, is a undoubtedly a very good example of the style, but it lacks a certain something that is present in any other Belgian tripel.

Only thing I don't like quite as much is the slightly tart aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Very light, a little carbonated... normally I don't like so much carbonation but it's ideal in this beer. The light mouthfeel is one of the best things about it. I'd expect such a strong beer to have a heavier feel, but it's so deceptively light. Which leads me to...

The beer looked terrific, a solid golden haze with a nice tall head and tons of lacing. Promising! Well, that faded as I smelled the beer and I must say, I couldn't stand they way this one smelled. Something was strange. It was a spicy Tripel smell, but a bit too unpleasant for me. Maybe too strong? I dunno what the problem was. The taste was outstanding, second only to Allagash's. A bit more apple in the taste in this one. I really enjoyed it and it was super drinkable. With the exception of the smell, this beer was about perfect.

22,34,steve8robin,3.48,"A: Nothing too special in this department. A urine yellow color with a decent white head that quickly fades  S: Smell a citrus, piney scent off the bat. Malts in the middle and a slight hop scent on the backend. Not getting too much special off of his brew.  T: Wow, this one surprised me in a bad way. After seeing some of the reviews, I was really gunning for this one. Tastes like citrus apple flavored sparkling water. Not much else going on.  M: Very smooth with a hint too much carbonation, but still very good in this category.  D: This one is exceptionally drinkable mainly because it tastes like a sparkling water and not like a beer.  All in all, this brew disappointed me. If you like a refreshing beer comparable to sparkling water, then this is for you. If you like heavy hops or malts, then this one might not be for you. Good to try at least once to give it a chance, but otherwise, I do not recommend.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jampics2,4.45,"12 (11.2?) oz bottle on the Winking Lizard beer tour. Drinking this felt like visiting an old friend - I see time has treated you well, buddy! This is one of the beers that made my palatte grow 2 sizes bigger after drinking - it really opened my eyes to the pleasant ways Belgian yeast can add to a beer.  A vigorous pour minus the sediment into an open mouthed glass. Straw color with a nice fluffy white head that sticks around.  Smell is great - yeast gives scents of banana, orange, and sweet malt.  Taste is almost perfect. This is a quinessential Belgian beer with orange flavors, yeasty esters, mild earthy spices like clove, and belgian candy sugar all make an appearance.  Mouthfeel is the only point that isn't exceptional as it's too lively carbed. I know a triple should have a fresh, bottle conditioned carb profile but this is just a bit too carbed and mildly distracting.  Overall, this was amazingly drinkable, refreshing, and wonderful. A great beer!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,donteatpoop,4.64,"I've had some less than stellar experiences from unibroue, though through no fault of the brewery (I failed to check the dates on a sampler pack I had bought) and so, even after checking to make sure this one wasn't expired; I purchased the bottle with a bit of subconcious aprehension.  I'm glad I did.  Poured a cloudy orange amber color with a nice cap of white head.  The smell is orange citrus, bread, and spice. The taste is sweet, everything in the nose is in the mouth except for the boogers; add a bit of clove to the taste as well. The 9% alcohol is masked well; this is probably easier to drink than it should be.  Such a smooth beer, glad to have tried it; will definately try again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Beerislife652854,4.5,"I've read nothing but good things about this beer, so obviously I had to try it. Into my Guinness glass it goes.  A - Hazy golden/ orange body with a thin, compact white head that fades rather quickly, but stays around in patches.  S - Citrus and fruit, hints of bitter hops at the end.  T - VERY MILD. No hint of harsh alcohol at all. Hints of citrus fruits, such as orange, lemons, even some hints of strawberries.  M - Crisp and refreshing. A perfect balance of carbonation and smoothness. Very nice.  D - Dangerously drinkable. One of this beer's best attributes, in my opinion, is that there is absolutely no trace of an unpleasant aftertaste.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Jmoore50,3.43,"Tasted at a little beer tasting I did with myself.  The appearance is golden yellow with a very crisp head. The head starts our at two fingers with an aggressive pour, but very soon leaves through the backdoor and takes all of its belongings with it. It is a clear brew, but is lighter in color.  The smell is of bready yeasts and very crisp hops. Their is some malt background in their as well but it all takes a backseat to the yeast.  The taste is of bready and Belgian yeasts with a slight malt background. It has a very crisp lavender and clove flavor that is brought up by the yeasts. Lighter in all aspects of the tastes than other Tripels I have had.  The mouthfeel is of strong carbonation and smooth finish. This is a refreshing drink, but not incredibly tasty. I would prefer St B.'s Tripel to this one.  J",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Bubbles rise to the surface in rapid unison like diving beetles gasping for...more La Fin Du Monde? I've read some other reviews on this brew, and a few folks mention a lack of head and/or lacing. I am having the opposite experience. My glass is coated in lace, and there is still 1/4 inch head left after 15 minutes.  S: The first whiff made my mouth water. That's always a good sign. Belgian yeast, clove, oranges, banana, spices, citrus. There's a lot going on here, for sure.  T: Absolutely delicious. Incredibly complex, this is one of my my go to beers. Spices and citrus blended beautifully, followed by warming alcohol. There is a yeasty, bread-like quality that I enjoy very much.  M: So smooth. Great carbonation level. Alcohol blended in perfectly.  D: So tasty and easy to drink, I could drink this all night...and the next...and the next. The 9% alcohol, while not overwhelming, will sneak up on you in a hurry.

Finishes dry with a note of spice and clove. Creamy, soft, and almost fluffy on the palate. Quite complex, yet gentle. Malt and hops are merely a canvas on which the yeast create their masterpiece.  An excellent Tripel, maybe one of the top 3 brewed in the world.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Poured into a tulip it has a beautiful golden yellow color with a white head and beautiful lacing. This is a good lookin beer.  Smells of cloves and bubblegum/banana. Everything you would expect in a tripel style.  Taste is of pepper and spice notes. Not a lot of this but it's there. Very smooth and tasty. Little bit of clove and spice/noble hops.  Mouthfeel is great with a high carb that is perfect for the style.  Overall I LOVE this beer. I am so glad this is so widely avaliable and I can even get it at my local grocery store. I have had this many times and plan on having it many more.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Head lasts for a bit and then subsides to a 1/4-inch. Fairly active carbonation observed.  Smell - spicy floral hops with an herbal quality take center-stage remeniscent of some Belgian witbier I've tasted.  Taste - peppery, nearly medicinal clove taste over some refreshing bitters. Spiced taste definitely makes this a winter selection. Hardly any taste of alcohol in this but a warming feeling occurs after a few sips.  Mouthfeel - overall a pretty smooth beer. The wave of spices is a bit much for me but that's where it's at.  Drinkability - very easy going down for the alcohol content.

This is still not my favorite, however.  A &#8211; Cloudy orange-yellow, quite carbonated.  S &#8211; The most distinctive smell: yeast, grain, banana and ripe fruit ester and a buttery richness meld to form a nose that is so identifiable. I think I could recognize it, easily, in a blind test.  T &#8211; It has many variables that I appreciate, but they do not combine in a manner that I am stoked on. Basically, it is too sweet, and drinks too hot, for me. I don't like any part of it all that much, and I am not quite sure why.  M &#8211; Sparkling, which would be good normally, but in this case it delivers an overwhelming amount of alcohol to the nose.  D &#8211; Nah. I'll pass.

Notes of cinnamon, coriander, honey, pepper, vanilla, orange zest, flowery hops and yeasts. Malts backbone. A bit of alcohol in the very end  T: Complex as the nose: Sweet, grainy and spicy upfront. Again, notes of honey, coriander, cinnamon, vanilla, malts, pepper, orange zest and bready-earthy yeasts. Mild bitter finish  M: Heavy body. Creamy and molasses. Medium carbonation.

Smells are very muted, but spicy yeast, apples, and a touch of pine are present. Tastes are spot on for a tripel, plenty of sweetness but a very good balance between hops and malt. Really not able to taste the alcohol at all, dry on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a nice creamy texture. This one is dangerous at 9% ABV, but it's one of my favorite tripels.

Smells of apples, with major white wine characteristics, lots of fruit present in addition to spicy and medicinal notes, and a faint hint of yeasty earth. Taste matches the aroma, with alcohol providing just enough edge to match the fruity, sweet flavors. Extremely clean despite the multitude of flavors. Feels outstanding - rich and round body, yet bubbly and effervescent thanks to the active carbonation. Smooth. Very balanced and manageable 9% abv.

22,34,Ek0nomik,4.15,"Poured In: Snifter Glass  Appearance: The pour is from a twelve ounce bottle. The beer has a hazy golden and sunshine wheat color with three fingers of thick and creamy head. The head retention isn't bad, it sticks around for a little bit. A few swirls in my snifter leaves me with a few dots of lace on the side of my glass. The beer is quite effervescent, which was to be expected from the large head produced on the pour.  Smell: The nose wields an interesting set of aromas. It doesn't have that strong spicy yeast aroma that many Belgian beers have. The yeast aroma is rather mute. There is, however, some herbal hop notes. The beer is warm now, and there's a little alcohol warmness in there, but it isn't sharp, it's nice.  Taste: The palate picks up many of the same notes as the nose. Some herbal hopiness and some spicy Belgian yeast. Now there are some fruit notes coming out as well; it tastes like lemon and pear.  Mouthfeel: A thin to medium body, well carbonated but it crosses the palate nicely. It's a nice strong, but gentle carbonation.  Drinkability: I liked this one a lot more than I was expecting. I think it was because it didn't have that strong Belgian yeast flavor. Not that I dislike that flavor, I just like when it's more mellow.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S- Not as complex as a tripel should be. Pears, citrus(orange mostly), and a sour dough funk.  T- At first it taste like orange-pineapple juice, as it warms on the tongue the yeast kicks in, there is some spice(maybe coriander), just a little funky, a slight banana aftertaste.  M- Creamy but not as creamy as a trip should be. All most perfect balance between flavor, body, and carbonation.  D- This as drinkable as a beer can get for me. Alcohol is transparent. Very refreshing, cant wait to have one of theses on a hot summer night.  Notes- This was my first non Belgian Tripel. Its all most perfect.

T- The fruit and spice isn't as strong in the taste which is good because it's balanced very well with the sweet malts and bready/yeasty flavors. The alcohol is hidden nicely.

Nice head that lingers plenty long enough and a wonderful creamy yellow, almost pastel body. Really like the yellow/white contrast this presents  S - A wee bit spicy, with a sharpness hinting at the abv common to the style, nothing blowing me away, but that's ok  T - Clove, spices, and some subtle apple/pear-like fruitiness. Very refreshing, with limited esters on the backside. The alcohol is sneaky...slips by the palate too easily  M - Clean, smooth and much too easy to drink. One 750 makes for a comfortable evening.  This one goes great with spicy food, and is strong enough to put a cap on consumption... Definitely falls into the buy again category. Honestly its a bit of a bargain compared to comparable Tripels from Belgium.

22,34,TheJollyHop,3.85,"Light amber colored with a thick and frothy white head. Good head retention however lacing is scare.  Initial yeasty twang gives way to fruity esters (apples come to mind),and some herbal scents (cloves). Pleasant aroma that prepares the palate for the forthcoming taste.  Fruit sweetness on the taste with ample spice, some bread, and possibly orange peel. Nice bitter caress at the end of the swallow that blends with an assertive amount of alcohol heat. Bitterness fades quickly leaving a crisp and dry aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is definitely the star as it is the perfect mix of creamy, mouth enveloping goodness that is also light on the palate and highly carbonated.  High carbonation and noticeable alcohol assertiveness coupled with a flavor that doesn't quite hold the palate's attention leads to reduced drinkability. Personally I feel this beer would have been highly drinkable if it had a lower ABV.

Taste is sweet with a big Belgian yeast presence as expected. The yeast adds a very good fruit and spice characteristic. The sweetness helps balance it out making it very delicious and drinkable.

22,34,theboozecruise,4.59,"Picked up in a Unibroue mix-pack... poured into a Chimay goblet.  The beer pours a hazy orange, small white head with good lacing. The smell is a mixture of citrus and hops, hints of floral flavors. Very nice.  The taste bring out more of the floral flavors... a little bit of fruit, toasted malts on the end of the sip. I'm not picking up the hop presence from the aroma, but it's still a fantastic beer. A medium body on this one, superbly drinkable... the 9% is masked extremely well by the flavors.  A top-notch tripel and one of the best you're going to find outside of Belgium.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Ghenna,4.2,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pub glass. Medium white head with good lacing atop a straw colored beer. Smells sweet and yeasty- a solid tripel smell. Taste is malt sweet (though not overly sweet) with a little bit of yeast and fruit. The alcohol is hardly noticeable, although I'm fairly well used to stronger beers. Suffice it to say, it is drinkable for me.  All told, a very good beer though not my favorite Tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Duhast500,4.59,Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a small wine glass.  The color is a clear gold with a slight white head that disapeared quickly. No lacing.  The smell is pretty darn fruity with a nice white grape flavor and sweet green apple flavor.  The taste is again fruity with a nice bubbly sweet taste. A grape flavor is nice with a great green apple flavor and a slight hop bitterness on the back end.  The feel of this beer is really light and quite enjoyable. It has a nice ammount of carbonation that is really pleasant and gives each sip a fizzieness that lightens the feel of this beer.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,beerwolf77,4.5,Not much left say about this one but figured I'd review this classic for my own records.  Poured into my tulip the beer is bright golden blonde with three fingers of stark white head. Retention is supreme. Thick lace rings remain after settling down.  The aroma is sweet and fruity. White grapes and pears. Full on yeast and spices.  The flavor is spot on belgian tripel. Sweet dry and fruity. Candied white fruits. Layers of spice and yeast.  Medium creamy body with plenty of carbonation.  Overall a true classic. A great Belgian tripel made in Canada.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,unclemeat9,4.97,"S - Clove, hints of citrus, yeast, sugar  T - Classic Belgian blonde flavor. Yeasty and well-spiced. Somehow, they manage to make the high ABV unnoticeable.  M - Wonderful carbonation releases all of the spices and lets them slowly dissipate on the palette.  I swear the good people at Unibroue have kidnapped Trappist monks and brought them to their brewery in Quebec. They're making beers that are easily just as good, if not better in some cases, than the classic Belgian breweries.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JohnnyBarman,4.6,"Figured this was an appropriate brew to sign off of 2009!  One of their classic 750ml bottles. Poured into a tall tulip. Light golden and opaque. Thick fluffy white head, dissolves into a still significant layer. Lots of sticky lacing. Looks terrific.  The smell is that of classy Belgian blonde. A bit of yeast, warming alcohol, some fruit to it.  I've long said this is one of Canada's finest brews, and upon reviewing it my opinion stands. Truly an exceptional brew. Warming alcohol, grape, banana and cloves (almost giving it a wheat character), lovely spicyness.  Mouthfeel is quite carbonated, almost burpy as one reviewer put it, but still highly quaffable.  One of the finest brews around - very proud that this is a Canadian brew! Love having this one on hand around the house; I've got a couple in the cellar as well. Well worth a sampling!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,danetrain0101,4.73,"It is a very cloudy golden mixture with a great head which doesn't seem to dissipate.  The smell is a over powering sugary fruit with hints of clove and a touch of alcohol. It is like music for the nostrils, if such a thing existed.  The powerful taste of cloves and alcohol hit you right off the bat. After taste brings on a mango, almost as if you just ate one.  A very smooth beer with a a good amoumt of carbonation helps keep its creamy texture.  A definite favorite of mine. Although I consume liquids like a fish, this brew demands respect. Drink slowly to get its full package.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

L - cloudy orange with a small white head  S - fruity, peach, and a hint of grape  T - Fruity, peach, grape, and with a pleasant carmel finish  M - Very carbonated. I found myself burping after every other drink.  D - This is a smooth beer considering the ABV.

Pears, banana etc.Slight spiciness , corriander , clove.  Taste is spicey right from the get go.Amazing candy sugar covered fruit taste. Hot alcohol comes into play for a bit but is meeted with a clovey,spicey finish.  Mouth mid bodied with intense carbonation. Slight slickness in the mouth,kind of buttery and does linger a bit afterwards.  This tripel is probably one of the best I've had if not the best. I bought a four pack of this and didn't realize 3 were gone within a bit of time. Very drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Cylinsier,4.42,"12 oz.  Pours a very hazy golden orange color with a light white head that retains as a bit of lacing.  Smells like citrus fruit, spices and coriander.  The taste is the same as the smell, but also there are dry malts, esters and bretty yeasts. The spices are especially pronounced.  The carbonation is consistent throughout the feel and prickly, but light.  A very delicious Belgian style beer. I've had beers from Unibrou before and considered them just reasonably good Belgian imitations, but this is the real deal. It stands up to top shelf Belgian offerings and still remains unique.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,BlackBearForge,4.32,"The End of the World pours forth a cloudy gold in color with a peachy copper glow when backlit. The white head falls rapidly leaving little lacing behind.  The aroma is very yeasty combined with various fruits such as apple and pear with perhaps peach and very mellow citrus.  The flavor has the same yeasty breadiness noted in the aroma with mellow golden fruits, (pear, apple, star fruit, peach). Alcohol is present and strong but very muted and well woven into the flavor profile. Warming only enhances the muted mellow golden fruit tones of this beer.  Mouthfeel is lush, medium, somewhat chalky and well carbonated, but very smooth in it's finish.  If the End of the World ever does come I can only hope it is accompanied by copious amounts of this beer!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Beerandraiderfan,2.38,"Well my apologies to everyone who loves this beer. Pours yellow haze and copper. Smells like alcohol spilled on a copper pipe. Taste wise, very alcoholic, reminiscient of when your old lady fills up the bathroom with perfume and hairspray and you get it in your mouth.  Perfume, apples, clove, maybe even vanilla. And you can't get rid of it for a little while. Sometimes, I've noticed aging the beer a year or three will make it a little less harsh in exchange for additional sweetness. I'd recommend that.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,chickenm,4.1,"341mL bottle poured into a La Fin Du Monde glass. Cloudy light copper color with a decent white head. Aroma of yeast, citrus, and green apples.

Not my favorite tripel but this is still very good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,meeekyh,4.53,"Poured in to a St. Bernardus chalice from a 12 oz bottle. This is exactly what I want a tripel to look like. Straw color with a hint or orange tint and a slight, uniform cloudiness. This beer pours with a modest head leaving no lacing.  The nose is bread, orange and a bit of spice. Crisp, hoppy, bright, a bit of candy-sugar flavor, tangy, slightly yeasty... The complexity leads me to believe that it would present different flavors (and smells) according to its accompanying food and maybe my mood. I am enjoying it without food after a wonderful day.  It has a really nice mouthfeel, all smooth and dry and effervescent with a nice hoppy finish. I would be pleased to drink it all day long, though it would likely drop me after five or six as the ABV is kinda high.  Really great beer. Honestly I am not sure what could be better as a stylistic representation. Sublime presents itself as a good descriptor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jbonapar,4.32,"I remember back in 1996, i was in first year university, visited QUebec City and tried some of these beers from Unibroue, including La Fin Du Monde. I HATED THEM, all of them. Now....Things have changed.  Appearance: Superb, bright, slight haze, yellow. Smell: Unbelievable, butter, Orange, banana, bubble gum. Taste: A butter creaminess hits your tongue immediatly. Flavors of banana, bubble gum, slight earthiness with a touch of fennel and coriander are overcome by a white pepper finish which lingers and develops into a subtle hopy bitterness. Just bitter enough. I've never had a beer that starts so smooth and creamy and develops into such a peppery bitterness before. Simply unbelievable.  Any beer drinker who enjoys fine beer would consider this, without a doubt, one of the best in the world. This, Maudite and Trois Pistoles are simply some of the best beer available in the world.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Bisho,4.79,Poured from a 75cl bottle into a La Fin Du Monde tulip glass  A triple in style and at 9% no slouch either! Cloudy golden orange in colour which pours with a thick creamy head that lasted longer than it took me to drink it!  The smell is very fruity with lots of Orange and banana on the nose with a clove spice to finish. On smell alone I would give this 10/10!  This hits your tastebuds like not many beers. There is so much going on - The fruit is to the fore in the mouth but when you swallow the spice kicks in. Very creamy as it goes down (reminds me of Chimay White with the creaminess) and all I want to do is fill my mouth again!  The alcohol is there on the nose but the beer is so balanced in the mouth that you could really get in trouble after a couple!  Absolutely gorgeous beer!  Unibroue make a couple of Belgian beers that would make those from the native land quiver in thier boots upon tasting. This just happens to be the best of them!,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,CBlack85,4.37,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a New Belgium globe glass.  Pours a cloudy golden color with a fair amount of white foamy head. Very nice presentation, appearance is right on par for the style.  There is alot going on with the aroma here. Fruity sweetness and spices wrestle for dominance. Once you get past the initial dominant smells you get some floral notes, a bit of banana, and the obvious scent of alcohol that a 9% beer is bound to have.  Like the smell the flavors of citrus fruits are at the forefront with the clovey spiciness coming in right behind. The alcohol is definately present but not dominant. A very nice balance.  It finishes a little sticky, but is very good. It is just dry enough to keep inviting me back for another sip. I could see drinking a few of these and finding the well balanced 9% sneaking up on me.  Overall a really good beer, and definately a good example of the style. Unfortunately, I found myself wishing it were a little bigger, or that it had more of something. I truly enjoyed it, I wonder if my ever so slight disappointment is due to the hype that I have been hearing for so long about this beer, perhaps my expectations were too high.  I am looking forward to trying another one... without the unrealistic expectations",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Really smooth and easy to on the taste buds.  D - Little bitter and certainly not as sweet as many of the other Tripels I've had, but in a good way. Very drinkable and REALLY good. This is one of the better beers I've had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Vonerichs,4.43,"Color is a pale golden orange, body is translucent. What a good-looking head on this one, about three fingers deep and meringue-like appearance. Excellent head retention, but little lacing.  The smell is mouth watering. The nose is a clove and pepper spiciness with a slightly funky yeast. It's followed by a light fruit combination of green apple and sweet pear.  For 9% this is very smooth. The apples and pear give it a sweet phenol apple juice body and the cloves add a nice kick to the finish. The finish tastes like Juicy Fruit, spot on. It's a very well rounded beer.  I'm really digging the mouthfeel. Very thick and creamy but cut with an endless supply of carbonation.  I'm only able to avoid chugging this beer because I know it's 9%, plus I want to savor every sip. Seriously though, it's that drinkable. It's juicy, full of flavor, and refreshing. It takes some discipline to make sure every sip isn't a chug.  Great beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,WeezyBoPeep,4.5,"Holy cow. Lots of good stuff going on here.  A: Amazing frothy head, awesome yellow cream pour.  S: Lots- Wheat, hops, apples, notes of lemons and peanut butter. Hardly any alcohol smell at all.  T: Waves of wonderful flavors. First, wheat. Second, apples. Then nuts and lemon zest. Awesome finish that leaves a great aftertaste. No alcohol which is amazing considering the ABV.  Drinkability: Again considering La Fin Du Monde 9% ABV, I'd say this is highly drinkable. I'll stick with one or two in an evening. Comes in a 4-pack and that should be plenty for anyone.  Value: Awesome value. I paid $2.59 for a single and it was worth every penny. Can't wait to taste some more Unibroue brews.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,CharlatanSin,4.57,"Poured from the bottle into an oversized wine glass.  A: A pretty golden yellow. Clear, with lots of bubbles. A one finger, smooth white head that sticks around for the show.  S: Very fruity, with that unmistakable Tripel yeasty spiciness. I'm getting peach primarily, with pear and apple, but it's so complex that I'm sure I can't completely untangle it.  T: Follows the smell, but even better. Same fruitiness, but the spiciness is more pronounced. I'm also getting a good dose of clove that I hadn't detected before. A bit peppery. A little bit of alcohol; enough to make you notice it's there, but not so much that it distracts.  M: High-ish carbonation, dry, and refreshing.  D/Overall: This truly is world-class. The bodega directly downstairs from me just started carrying this, and thank goodness for that. It'll certainly enter my regular rotation.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

It's heavy and almost velvety without being cloying or thick. The alcohol asserts itself, but the beer is rich enough that it blends in. Overall, a fantastic beer.

22,34,Arbitrator,4.28,"Chilled 12oz bottle into a glass. 2008 bottle, about a year old now.  A: Pours a clear golden body with orange hues when held to the light. The head is a restrained finger of off-white bubbles with excellent retention, eventually forming a thick cap on the brew and leaving thick washes of lacing during a sip.  S: Very nicely fruity. Bananas, lemon peel, green apples, even a touch of apricot. But it's also nicely spicy, with cloves and cinnamon coming out. It's also toasty and toffee-like. Very rich.  T: Orange, bananas, lemon, green apples, and apricot. Very, very tasty, but the flavors meld nicely without all clamoring for attention. A small yeasty flavor in the mid-taste coupled with toffee. The finish lets the spicy phenols do their work, with a nice sting from cloves and cinnamon. The aftertaste and exhalation are toasty.  M: I find the bombers tend to be overcarbonated, but the 12ozers nail the mouthfeel. This is properly carbed, offering enough to amplify the spice and cleanse the palate without being too prickly. Well-masked ABV. Medium-bodied, but somehow chewy.  D: I used to wonder why LfdM received the Top 100 love but no other Unibroue beers did. Now I no longer wonder. This is an outstanding tripel. The price keeps me buying other stuff, but when I'm in the mood for the style, this is where I'll go.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The beer is subtly sweet with enough spice and hop bitterness for good balance. Nutty yeast flavor rounds out the palate.  M - Prickly carbonation perks up a smooth, round body.

Nice earthness and a good strong yeast aroma that is sweet.  Taste: Tastes amazingly clean and refreshing. Apple and pear notes with some spiciness and well rounded yeasty components. Clean crisp and hides the 9% abv like none other. Truely a perfect beer.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is spot on. Kept the head for the whole session.

A: Poured a rustic, cloudy gold with a decent head. I recall that normally La Fin has a large, white robust crown. Perhaps my pour was faulty.  S: The scent of ripe fruit and yeast hit my nose along with slight alcohol. For a tripel, at 9%, it's tough to detect that this one is a relatively big beer.  T: An amazing array of fruit and candy sugar with a slight malt background. The finish is extremely clean and crisp. Quite refreshing.  M: La Fin has a creamy and well carbonated mouthfeel. It is perfectly balanced, providing an excellent canvas to let the flavors shine.  D: Like any beer with complex flavors, more than a few of these would be difficult to finish.

Head was more than acceptable, but it was the the bright white film that sat atop the beer that turned me on. Very silky, the swirl marks in the center, after I agitated the beer a bit, was a nice touch.  Nose was immediately pear and coriander. Spices, citrus, and plum came behind and sat in the background. The malt started to shine through very nicely as it warmed with graham cracker notes. There wasn't too much alcohol in the aroma....  ....aaah there it is. The warmth is evident in the flesh. Taste was sweet, graham cracker, dark sugars, pear, and coriander. Finish was sweet and clean.  Mouthfeel was incredibly crisp with a nice bubbly bite from the carbonation , almost champagne-like.

Drink - Destroyed the tall bottle in a matter of minutes, way too easy to drink.  Overall a great beer. Instantly I was reminded of Mothership wit from New Belgium.

Alcohol has a nice warming characteristic when swallowed. A little bit extra carbonation seems to be present for me.  Thoroughly enjoyable, though probably more in moderation than in a session.

22,34,jgasparine,4.53,"A- An aggressive pour yielded a 1/2"" creamy off-white head, which was well-retained and produced some wonderful lacing throughout the drink. The body was a hazy golden yellow color, and contained a few chunks of sediment from the bottle... there was some evidence of carbonation observed from the sides of the glass, and some particularly agressive bubble trains originating from the little pieces of sediment in the glass.  S- Big aromas of Belgian yeast and fresh baked bread combine with faint traces of candy sugar and fresh ground pepper in the nose.  T- Once in the mouth, the Belgian yeast and fresh-baked grain flavors dominate the palate. Some restained strawlike notes begin to emerge before being overtaken by some peppery booziness in the finish.  M- A beautifully big creamy body, packed with unattenuated sugar and complimented by a velvet blanket of soft carbonation. Just decadent.  D- Exceptionally delicious and drinkable. None of the characteristics ever seem to become overpowering. I shall enjoy this entire bomber on my own, and would be tempted to open another!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,josefnewsong,5,"Possibly my favorite beer.  A - Light gold, slightly cloudy with beautiful head.  S - Very yeasty, slightly fruity, and a meadow of flowers...complex and intriguing  T - Amazing. Very yeasty with light fruit flavors and very slight alcohol (especially for 9%)  M - Light and carbonated but sooo creamy with the head. Perfect.  D - DAAAANGEROUSLY drinkable.  If you want a beer that your girlfriend will enjoy almost as much as you do, buy this beer. Then buy it again, and again. It's that good. I like to drink it from a fluted champagne glass for amazing head retention.  EDIT: I just ordered this at the Tap again, thinking maybe I shouldn't have given it all fives...until I drank it. I just can't find a flaw in this beer. Blows my mind every time.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,crhensel,4.58,"(Bottle poured into Trappist glass) Poured a beautiful golden color with small creamy head that faded fast. Aroma provided a good deal of sweet notes, most notable a strong fruit and flowery hint. Full bodied, the drink was very smooth with a very average carbonation -- there was just enough here! Overall the flavor did not disappoint in the sweet department, but it was not overly sweet. A great compliment to the hearty stew I had it with! This is one to go back to over and over again!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Methodd,3.34,"750mL bottled poured (a few times) into a tulip glass.  Appearance: Hazy gold. Lots of white fizzy head that hangs around for the entire experience.  Smell: Right up front and in your face is yeast. Upon closer inspection citrus and honey come through giving way to spice, malts, floral hops, apple cider and pear.  Taste: Yeasty citrus, honey and sour grapes (which I did not detect in the aromas). This beer actually reminds me of a dry white wine.  Mouthfeel: I bit over carbonated and a bit too yeasty. The complexity of the aroma surpasses the simplicity of the taste. Medium bodied and quite tart. The after taste becomes a bit nasty after a minute or two (which I suspect is due largely to the yeast). This nasty after taste made me want to take another drink which must be the reason I finished off the 750mL bottle in about 20 minutes.  Drinkability: I tend to think of this as something that should be drank in the summer. It&#8217;s crisp and refreshing, but the yeast is at the forefront of this brew and in the end is just a bit too much. As mentioned, I&#8217;m reminded of a dry white wine which for me feels like over-fermentation which has lead to a boozy feeling. After 750mL of La Fin Du Monde I think I might have to drink some Monistat.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,WJVII,4.37,"Another one from my wife, great pic babe! Poured into a pint glass this brew is a pale wheat color with a clean, crisp, white head that dissipated quickly and didn't leave any lacing to speak of even with the high alcohol content. The nose is of thick floral beds, lots of clove, and sweet honey. The taste is heavy clove and warm alcohol coats your throat. There is a slight kick, but a good balance and if sipped rather than drank, it leaves a tingling sensation in your throat. This has a thin body, but moderate carbonation. This is a tasty drink, I say drink as some of these triples are more like drink rather than beer. Very fine choice!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Smell - Crisp, honeyed/peachy/apple-y (that's all I got, yet to really master smell detection).  Taste - A bit of sour on the finish, a good sour.  Mouth feel - Breadlike, yeasty, crisp. Refreshing, medium weight.  Drinkability - Excellent. Have been drinking the finer brews for a few years now, and this is one of my fave. Also, Belgian Tripels are soon becoming my favorite styles.  Cheers y Salud!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,techtatu,4.27,"Poured a nice cloudy golden color with a white head, about a finger's width. The lacing on the glass was pretty decent, and it had a very strong citrus smell, along the lines of lemons and grapefruit. The taste reflected the pungent aroma with a hint of spice. This beer reminded me of Paulaner Salvator, almost like a Salvator ""Light"" with a citrus wedge. You could not feel the alcohol go down, however you can feel it warm you up afterwards.  Definitely a beer that I would love to get my hands on again, and something I would encourage everybody to try at least once.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,cbarrett4,4.97,"Poured from 330ml into beer snifter (tulip)  Poured with nice head settling to a fine lace. Hazy golden hue with some sediment in the bottom of the glass (some lees and what looks like adjunct) showing the lack of filtration (a good thing). Stunning aromas of nectarine, pear, white flowers, white pepper, and sour yeast (yum!). Exceptionally rich flavor, massive body and concentration. The finish is luxurious but mellow at the same time. Very drinkable, but watch the 9% alcohol, it will creep up on you! This is definitely in my top 10 beers!  Also note: I have had this beer on tap at several bars and I have to say stick to bottle. This beer has a tendency to build up deposit in the lines and also sells slower than most taps so I have never had a completely 'sound' pour on draft.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,coldwarkid,4.12,"(reviewed from notes on Halloween) Appearance: 750mL bottle into a tulip. Pours a hazed, solid golden yellow with orange highlights. 1 inch head slowly fizzes to a ring around the glass. not too much in terms of lace.  Smell: Really unique and interesting aroma: bubblegum, delicate noble hop floral bouquet, bittersweet orange, lime, lemon, and peppery spiciness.  Taste: Nose transfers directly to the taste: very nice subtle hop bitterness with mellow orange and lime tastes woven in, sprinkled with pepper and bubblegum yeastiness.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied - creamy and smooth due to a very lifting but not over the top amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: I really don't know how these Belgian style ales hide their alcohol so well. Its almost unbelievable that this is 9% abv, because it drinks like 4% or 5%. This beer is balanced yet flavourful, and goes down smooth.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,donniecuffs,4.92,"Poured a nice golden carbonated yellow into a snifter, with two fingers of bright white head, that laced very well. The smell was off the charts; cloves, allspice, coriander, banana, tart apple, pear, lime, bubble gum...and I know that I'm missing a few. Couldn't wait to start sipping, and when I did, what overwhelmed me was not all of the aforementioned flavors (and then some), but the BALANCE between all of those flavors. Furthermore, the alcohol content was not as evident as expected in the finish. The feel was nicely carbonated and medium, and when I was done with the bomber...which didn't take very long...I wish I had purchased several.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Pears, peaches, maybe some banana and clove.  Taste: Flavor is even more yeasty than the smell (this is good). Its sweet and fruity as well as almosty peppery in its spiciness. Alcohol is not at all undetectable. Long tasty yeasty finish.  Mouthfeel: Incredible. Very well carbonated and very tingly. The persistent head is deliciously creamy.  Drinkability: Very easy drinking. I love it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Grainy malt blends with all sorts of fruity flavors throughout the entire experience.  fairly highly carbonated with a nice creamy body  Find du monde is an interesting compromise between a Belgian Strong Pale Ale and a true Tripel its as if you mixed duvel and westmalle very tasty!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,MeisterBurger,3.95,"The most striking thing about this beer while pouring it is the whopping amount of carbonation. It's fizz city here. But it dies down leaving a very typically tripel appearance--mildly hazy golden honey color topped by a bone white head. It retains a creamy, velvety head nicely although there isn't exactly heaps of lacing.  The nose lets you know in no uncertain terms that this is brewed in the Belgian style. It's musty saddle leather yeast, a bit medicinal, with hints of pears and sweet perfume and spice.  The taste follows with a mild fruity sugary sweetness that quickly meets a creamy saddle leather and earthy notes and spice (nutmeg or cinnamon--one of those two) in the finish and a warming alcohol that slowly builds with every sip. A tad too sweet perhaps.  It's full bodied, creamy, powdery and satisfying. Almost a little heavy. Despite that initial burst of carbonation, there isn't a ton to be found here, and I almost wish there was a bit of spritziness and carbonation in the mouthfeel to lighten things up and take the edge off, creeping up as it is on the precipice of cloying.  Extremely drinkable and moreish, which is a dangerous quality in a beer of this ABV.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bobsy,4.3,"On Sunday night we did a blind tasting of four tripels at Shawn's place. Facing off against each other were Allagash Tripel and Urthel Hibernus Quentum, and La Fin du Monde and Tripel Karmeleit. Allagash won its battle and Tripel Karmeleit took the prize in its contest. It would be difficult for me to pick an overall winner, as they seemed to be at opposite ends of the style spectrum, and showed that there is variation within the tripel category.  In general, I noticed some consistency between samples when it came to appearance and mouthfeel. On pouring all the samples displayed a brilliant light gold, with a tight white head that produced some spots and streaks of lace. Some of the samples were cloudier than others, but I'd put this down to disturbed sediment (I'd just brought a couple and they may have been a bit shaken up). Only in taste and aroma did they seem to differ - falling into either a dry graininess, or a sweeter honey-like profile. The bodies were invariably medium-light with a high, pillowy carbonation.  I've had the Unibroue countless times, but this was the first time I've ever had the opportunity to put it up against other examples of the style. As a Canadian, I'm glad to say it held up well, and only lost my vote in its contest because the Karmeleit had slightly more complexity. The general consensus was also that the sweetness actually worked against it. On the nose, there's a wonderfully fruity and spicy aroma (which I now recognise as the house yeast strain). The initial flavour hit comes from cloves and cinnamon, but then transitions to sweet phenolic malts, that strongly emphasise apple and pear. I wish it had a slightly crisper finish, which I think would be more to style, but it's pleasant nonetheless.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mcann2pu,3.23,"Appearance: Pours into my left hand brewing glass a hazy/cloudy golden color,  Smell: cloves and yeast,  Taste: mostly cloves with maybe some bitter citrus,  Mouthfeel: not bad I like the feel provided by the carbonation in this one,  Drinkability: ok, I think the clove taste is a bit overpowering drowning out any other flavors that this one might have had so it looses drinkability there,",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,madtrixter787,4.2,"Serving Type: Single bottle  Appearance: Pours a very nice light hazy orange with a decent head that gives way to a lace around the rim from the rising bubbles.  Smell: The spice/clove flavor comes through strong that leaves some fruity and a hint of the alcohol that lies underneath the well blended flavors.  Taste: Similar to the smell, the clove and orange peel are the first through, but the alcohol leaves a nice warm finish as it goes down. Not too much, but you know it's there. Very nice combination of flavors that work well together.  Mouthfeel: A bit on the carbonated side, which is to be expected, but does not detract from the beer.  Drinkability: Good to enjoy over a period of time. Do not rush through this beer, it has a lot to offer that would be missed due to a hurried drinking.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,heissebier,4.14,"Poured into a tulip from a very intimidating bottle with ""Best before 1-20-12"" printed on the back.  Appearance- a beautiful cloudy yellow orange color. A disappointingly lackluster head with little sign of carbonation, but damn that's one pretty color.  Smell- Clove, apples, and peppers dominate the smell of this beer. Complex, but in a graceful, not really trying kind of way. Smells spicy and the 9% abv seems nonexistant.  Taste- Tastes fruity at first, then finishes spicy with just a hint of bitter hoppiness. Effervescent, the carbonation kind of explodes in your mouth. The alcohol is hidden by a not so subtle spiciness. Kind of weird and doesn't really feel like beer. To me it honestly seems like some sort of beer-champaign frankenstein.  Mouthfeel- Finishes well and warms the back of my throat. The carbonation is kind of strange. Not necessarily bad, but not assertive enough.  Drinkability- Goes down easy and each sip begs to be followed up with another. However, the high alcohol content ensures that you won't be pounding these back all night.  This beer is certainly different, and maybe that's why its been getting such stellar reviews. Great tasting but I just don't buy it. It doesn't seem to share the same complexities as many other top rated beers, although what flavors it has are very well balanced. Not my favorite, but definitely a quality brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Whiteweasel,3.72,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a goblet. Best before date: 01-24-12  Appearance: Gah why do these Unibroues not give any head?? A light golden colour almost devoid of any brownness. Not a very typical beer and makes me think this is going to be like a Don De Deau in how wine-like it will be. Not much carbonation coming up either.  Smell: Very wheaty and yeasty (with that unmistakable Unibroue yeast) but with a sourness like apples, bananas, and a hint of grape. Has a hint of clove but not much. Reminds me of cider or some sort of overtly sweetened juicy juice box  Taste: Very very tart. Like drinking sour apple juice. Somewhat of a honey flavour gives it a sweet finish which is rather pleasant. Definitely more of a grape flavour, and honestly made me feel like I was drinking champagne when i wasnt thinking about it. Taste is closest to golden raisins. Upon the second pour (with the most yeast in it) I could detect a lot more pronounced of a yeast flavour and the requisite nuttiness. At least its more complex than its brother the Don De Deau.  Mouthfeel: It's like drinking pop rocks the way it sizzles in your mouth. You can only slightly detect the alcohol. It seems like most of the hidden carbonation nucleates on your taste buds. Very much like champagne in its mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Not a very consistantly drinkable beer on its own. Not just because of the alcohol. I wouldnt have more than one or two of these even if the abv was lower than 9%. Its very easy to drink at first, but I started to get a little sick of it as I neared the end.  I'm not sure why i differ so much from everyone else, but i suppose it just happens.

The color is a pale straw and the beer is a little hazy. The smell is mild. Smells a tiny bit sweet and malty, and its got that ""Belgian"" phenol thing going, but faintly. The taste is fantastic. Up front, there's lemon, pear and yeast, and it has a nice sour middle followed by a very clean finish. The alcohol is very well hidden. This tastes like a Belgian beer without the earthy funkiness, but it is working for me in a big way. Very fresh and very clean. I wanted more when the bottle was empty.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,AmberMan22,4.97,"Poured from a foil wrapped 33cl bottle into my tulip glass, figured this would make a good 50th review.  The End of the World pours a lovely hazy apricot color, highlights of golden wheat when held to the light. I don't think I washed my glass properly because despite my efforts, the head was unimpressive and dissipated quickly. Can't blame that on the beer.  Smell is divine. Sweet like candy, mixed with a dash of cloves and other spices, light colored fruits, yeast, of course heavy dose of malt, with a bite of hops followed by the alcohol. Don't think I've ever written a 'smell' description that long. Wow.  Taste is unworldly good as well. All of the aforementioned in the smell, but the fruits come through more obviously...pear and apple seam to stick out. And even though I emptied the entire bottle into the glass, the yeast settles rapidly to the bottom and doesn't ruin the other flavors, actually blending rather nicely.  Mouthfeel is right on par for what you'd expect in a great tripel. perfect light-medium carbonation, easy.  If the end of the world was actually coming, I would not be very happy if this was the last beer I ever had. Well done, Unibroue, you lived up to the hype.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Thick one inch head with little retention. It would have laced the glass, but didn't stick to the glass.  Smells remarkable - golden delicious apples, a bit of clove, and some honey. No hint of the alcohol.  Tastes with honey balanced with malts finished off by bitter hops. The fruit flavors are present, but masked by the more traditional beer flavors.  A little dense - a touch more carbonation would have been well appreciated, but it works without it.  Easy to drink, but a real sipper. A great take on the tripel style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Drinkability is a little hampered by the high ABV that is well hidden until the bottom of the glass( like I feel now drinking while reviewing).

A ton of head initially gave way to about a finger after a few minutes. Beautiful looking beer.  S: Lots of citrus and spice. A definite sweet hop smell as well mixed with just a subtle sting of alcohol.  T: Strong Citrus and sweet fruits up front that continue throughout. The sweetness is somewhat balanced out by some yeast, spice, and a bite of hops. However, the fruity sweetness really dominates the flavor overall. Perhaps just a touch too sweet, but it's definitely very good. As the beer warms the hops and spice become a little more apparent and do a better job of balancing the flavors.  M: Light-Medium body and a lot of carbonation which also helps to complement the sweet fruity flavors. Alcohol is covered well, but I definitely feel some warming effects in the back of my throat.  D: This is a very good beer, but perhaps just a bit too sweet for me to want to drink more than one. You'll probably want to sip this one and appreciate the complex fruity and spicy flavors here. Make sure not to drink it too cold or the sweetness will dominate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Smell: Light nose of tropical fruits (apricot, peach, passion fruit), wheat, spicy hops, malts and some alcohol.  Taste: Spicy hops, and again, very fruity (apple, passion fruit, mango), yeast, sweet malts. Aftertaste is slightly bitter (hops) and dry.  Mouthfeel: medium-bodied but carbonation is too high.

But the alcohol was a nice warming sensation. If I can explain it that way. Although not overbearing. Present though.  M - Perfect carbonation. Not too much or too little. Slippery with an alcohol tinge at the rear.  D - Fairly high.  I drank all three from this company recently and chose to review this one. I liked all of them so far. This one was the one I happened to have when my opera browser was open. Some have said that the alcohol isnt noticeable, but after reviewing I understand why. The alcohol kick is only at the beginning and slowly as it warms up and you warm up to it, its very easy to drink. This one is worth the money I would say.  $5.50 at Shop and Save.  :)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bobjonesSD,3.51,"We shared a 750ml bottle into a maredsous chalice and a large wine goblet. Pours a delightful golden color with a quite vigorous amount of foam - very nice. The aroma, even upon warming up, was not particularly strong - some coriander and citrus but not a lot past that. The taste was also a bit of a letdown - it was very smooth but we were hoping for more belgian ester and yeast flavors.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,NebulousNate,4.3,"Beer from the bottle, poured into a narrower snifter type glass.  A: It poured with a one finger head that lingered a bit and didn't really stick to the glass, nothing spectacular. Hazy and uniformly cloudy. Soft. The color has a nice warm amber glow to it.  S: First thought was exotic. Smells of fine spice with hints of sweet fruit and aromatic flowers. Very summer. The smell wasn't strong, but it was very pleasant.  T: Great taste. Wonderful balance of spice and subtle sweetness. Clove hints and sugars. No single flavor dominates, nor is one to oppressive. What exists is an almost perfect harmony between the flavor elements.  M: Good feel. Sits very nice on the pallet. It was lighter than expected. Medium bodied. Very nice smooth lingering finish.  D: Surprisingly drinkable! Considering the alcohol content I expected it to be a bit heavier. The great flavors and feel make it a wonderful beer to drink. In fact the alcohol was barely present.  Overall this was a very good beer, I definitely suggest you try it! I feel that the smells and the head weren't as strong as some other folks here described, it could have been an older bottle. I'm not sure. I didn't look at the bottle, the bar tender tossed it immediately.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mikel52588,4.38,"Appearance: Poured from a bomber into a dogfish head signature glass; the color is a cloudy golden orange hue with a massive 3 fingerlength head; has a nice full soapy lacing.  Smell: Has a strong clove scent with banana in the background, and a sweet maltiness  Taste: Delicious. Very malty sweet but not in an overbearing way; just the right amount of cloves hit your taste buds right off the bat, while the banana falls in the aftertaste; this is probably the most pleasant aftertaste I have ever had.  Mouthfeel: It has the perfect consistency; creamy, smooth, medium body; aftertaste, as I mentioned, is pleasant.  Drinkability: Extremely drinkable; its so smooth and tasty and good you wont want to put this one down. And wow, this beer could really be dangerous! Its 9% abv and drinks like a 5. I would definitely session with this beer, but I would have to be careful of course.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,craftaholic,4.25,"Appearance: Pours a cloudy golden honey hue with a fat three finger length head of creamy white frothy foam that has a great deal of retention.  Smell: The smell is on par with that of a belgian. There is hints of tart apple and even some pear. There is also a heavy yeast quality with hints of floral notes, spice, clove and banana. There is even a presence of alcohol so the nose really doesn't mask the abv well at all.  Taste: The flavor has a mind of its own on this one as it transforms from amounts of yeast that mix with assertive touches of orange-peel and coriander. There is also a strong bold sweetness in the malt that is signature for a trippel. There is some earthiness as well as some fruits such as the aforementioned pear as well as grape. The clove and banana rears its head again from the nose and is rounded out by a subtle bitterness to give it a great balance. After some warmth this turns into a slightly tart banana creme pie flavor.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation settles down from a misplaced overzealous tingling after a few sips and settles to a dull roar. Given some warmth and time to settle it allows the flavors to come through. After a while it turns to a decently smooth creamy texture. It finishes dry yet refreshing and is quite light in the body department.  Drinkability: This brew is almost too drinkable for a 9% and has a combination of body and potency to even make me put it in the summer brew category.  Overall: This beer reminds me of a witbier in certain aspects but the malt really puts it in it's place. It is quite light in character for a brew with such a big bodied reputation. Was quite delightful and would definitely have again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

If your looking for a beer that will really get you going, this is the one, even if the bottle will cost you 10$ at a bar.  The key to this beer is knowing how to pour it / having the sense to not drink it straight from the bottle (but sometimes you have to do what you have to do)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Cokie,4.82,"This is my first review here and I picked the La Fin Du Monde because it is one of the best ones I have ever had!!  From the time I opened the cap on the bottle, I could smell the beautiful aromatics of, clove, banana, flowers, and yeast. As I poured it into a wine glass the smell for just incredible!  The flavor was just mind blowing... just as I smelled, the clove was upfront and in my face, finished with the banana and flower.  So far this is on the top of my list!! What an incredible brew it is. If I could, I would drink it on a daily basis. I don't even get the alcohol it is masked so well... this is not a session brew!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jnfs,4.35,"Pours a moderately carbonated hazy yellow color with a slight head. There is a nice spicy smell with a cloudy and alcoholic sweet aroma (banana maby).

A great beer that is reminiscent slightly of champagne.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mintjellie,4.42,"It's hazy and the colour of sunshine. Golden and brilliant. It has a thick white head that leaves a good cap on the body after fading away a little. Good retention and nice lace. It smells of banana, cidery apple, and peppery spice. There's a boozy solvent character to it, and something vaguely suggestive of plastic, like a vinyl record. It tastes of sweet orchard and tropical fruits with some nice boozy alcohol and mild hop bitterness in the finish. The alcohol lends this beer a spicy character. The carbonation is fairly high and plays nicely with the peppery alcohol. It's so potent, but it just goes down like water - especially when it's just slightly cool. The alcohol doesn't hinder it at all in that respect. This is a 750mL bottle - when you think about it, you're really having a little more than two to begin with, and it's still going down like water towards the end. It has depth, well integrated complexity, and it's easy to drink. What's not to love?",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Ralphus,4.02,"La Fin Du Monde was Unibroue's attempt at a Duvel style beer in the mid 1990's, and by all accounts it was a good one. I have had La Fin Du Monde a number of times but only just recently realized I hadn't rated it.  Poured into a Duvel tulip with a large aggressively carbonated offwhite head. The head receded to a smaller cap but a steady stream of bubbles ensures it has some longevity. The beer itself, depending on how it is poured is either a crystal clear or semi opaque dark golden colour.  The smell is BIG and beautiful. Oranges, pears, yeast and some corriander. The taste is similarly bold, with strong sweetness, fruit and a drying hoppyness. The alcohol is well disguised in the taste but you have no trouble noticing it as it warms your stomach on the way down. The added yeast is also apparent.. more so than in a beer like Duvel, and I find it limits drinkability.  Mouthfeel is silky smooth with the perfect amount of carbonation. A pleasure to hold in the mouth.  Drinkability is average. A single beer of this style and strength is generally enough for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,nickd717,4.38,"Bottle from BevMo. This is one of the beers that helped get me into beer. Everybody likes this stuff, and for good reason. Sometimes the ignorant masses are right.  A - Cloudy golden appearance with a large white head and great lacing.  S - Aroma of sweet malt, yeast, banana/clove, and light fruits.  T - Highly yeasty with citrus, banana, clove, coriander, and other spices as well as pale malt. Some mild citrusy hops.  M - Smooth palate, carbonation pretty high. Refreshing as hell.  D - High.

I picked up a hint of alcohol in the aroma as well.  A very interesting taste, ranging from hints of grain to yeast to spice to some hints of banana. Very tasty and complex, and an outstanding tripel.  Mouthfeel is a little thin with moderate carbonation.  Drinkability is fair/good. Very tasty and enjoyable, but certainly strong.  Complex and interesting - certainly a world-class tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,vishneda,4.27,"12 oz bottle poured into a chalice.  A well built and complicated little brew. I wasn't sure what to expect from it on first sight. It was lighter in color, golden or peach with a quickly faded white head. The aroma was more promising. It was full of banana, clove, and spices and similar to a witbier or even a hefe. The phenolic character was strong. Pre-taste impression was good.  The flavor bursted out nice and yeasty. There were a lot of wheat notes in here: Mildly sweeet, toasted banana, clove, citrus, bread, etc. However, there was much more complexity. Hints of vine fruits, earthiness, and maybe a little nut. A nice closing bitterness provided great balance.  The carbonation settled down a minute or two after the pour, but it was really high at first. Had a nice, dry finish and was refreshing, amazingly so for the ABV. The body was pretty light.  Overall this reminded me of a very rich and complicated witbier.

22,34,PrairiePenguin,4.88,"Just a phenomenal high ABV beer. On first impression the taste reminded me of Hoegaarden with a bigger but not obsessive alcohol back end.

22,34,papat444,4.16,"Enjoyed this last night while waiting for a phone call to find out if our place is rented so we can move. Paired with my supper, some homemade cannelloni (in pasta shells).  Poured from a 341ml. bottle.  Appearance: Pours a very hazy and golden body. Color resembles a pear. Fairly average head that recedes quite quickly and no much lacing to speak of. Not too nice, i was expecting more.  Smell: Much better here. Getting a nice heady aroma of cloves, yeast, banana and dough. Am i drinking a hefe? Regardless, very pleasing indeed.  Taste: Quite discreet at first. I get some herbs and some fruit that's more dry than sweet but never obtrusive. Some citrus action in there also. Opens up more as it warms but it's still a low-key affair.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation hinders it a bit but it still feels rather good anyways. It subsides a little as it warms. Very full-bodied and light at the same time if that's possible.  Drinkability: ABV is well hidden though it does creep on you midway. I'd have another for sure.  Overall: Definitely a high-caliber beer that's well made. Everything is in the nuances though as it's not a in-your-face beer. I prefer more guts with my Belgian beers which is reflected in my score. Nevertheless, i like this beer and next time, i'll drink it at near room temp to get a better grasp on it. Is it the be all end of the world? Not quite...but it's right up there.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,OnThenIn,4.37,"Appearance: This is a beautiful hazy lighter orange colored beer. It poured with a massive two+ finger head of white fluffyness into my DFH snifter.  Smell: The aroma is SO FRUITY. It is tropical island fruity. The second whiff gives me the beauitful yeasty, bready aroma I was expecting. There is a wheat aroma to it. There is even a tiny bit of banana and clove to this. I mean it even made me think of raisin bread for a second.  Taste: The flavory is very yeasty and bready with a little dark fruit to it. Sweet citrus!  Mouthfeel: This is a pretty solid mouthfeel. I would give it a 4.25 if I could, because even though this mouthfeel is really enjoyable and the slightly dry alcoholic finish is really nice, the carbonation is just a tiny bit bitey for me. Even though the carbonation is a bit much it seems to weirdly work in this mysterious brew. This beer has a medium body by the way.  Drinkability: Out of the Unibroue beers I have had this is one of the most drinkable (not in terms of quality, but in terms of it not being a sipper). I truly can't believe that this is a 9% beer when I am drinking it and the carbonation truly makes it perfect for summer, which just does not compute in my mind!

Hay, something sweet, like the smallest hint of orange honey. Smell is wet wheat-field, ripe fruit, Is that the yeast? Wow these beers are complex. The bottle slowly drains, large quaffs don't satisfy like a powerful sip put directly on the tip of the tongue. Carbonation is crisp but fades dramatically half way through the bottle, this isn't really a bad thing, just noticed. Each time I put the glass down it tastes different.

At once subtle and complex with a variety of sweet, tart, fruit and yeast notes on the finish. This beer is truly delicious.  Mouthfeel: medium body; with the carbonation it is quite creamy. Sticks around enough to really give a good flavor experience.  Drinkability: alcohol content notwithstanding, this is a highly drinkable beer.

22,34,oldpinecone,1.84,Poured into tulip glass.  First off let me tell you I am not fond of Belgian Tripels but I keep trying different ones to see if my taste changes.  Poured a decent pale orange with a 2 finger head and lots of bubbles.  It smelled like a fruit bowl thats been sitting around for a little too long. Eh my stomach said dont do it.  I took the first sip and there it was. The taste I despise so much. It was the rotten over fermented fruit I find in all these beers. So so so unpleasant.  Along with the taste it was super thin and over carbonated and just terrible.  I gave drinkability a 2 but only because I thought if Im drunk enough I could probably gag a few down for the high ABV but I dont get drunk to much and will probably never do this.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,woosterbill,4.19,"12oz bottle, best by 01-28-12, into a Duvel tulip.  A: Hazy straw/gold body topped with a half-inch white foam head - this after a fairly vigorous pour. Underwhelming retention and next to no lace. A good swirl of the glass produces a larger head, but it too disappears quickly without a trace.  S: Quite nice, with fruit and spice being the dominant players. Apple, pear, apricot, and clove all make a distinct appearance, with some white wine notes making themselves known toward the end. Complex and pleasing.  T: All the complexity of the smell, plus some malt sweetness and just a hint of dry hoppiness on the finish. Very rich, fruity, and complex.  M: Extremely smooth, with very fine carbonation and a medium body. Heavenly.  D: Hides the alcohol amazingly well, but the surprisingly low carbonation (compared to other reviews) makes the last few ounces less than spectacular.  Notes: a delicious tripel, to be sure, but the low carbonation leaves me wanting a bit more. Not my favorite example of the style, but definitely a beer I'll seek out again, especially for the reasonable price.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,sweetbrew82,4.15,"750 ML into a tulip/ Best before 2-16-12  P: Looks like an unfiltered, kind of dull, light gold color with a huge head of pearly white foam that is thick and pillowy. Shows great retention and leaves a nice amount of lace plastered on the side of the glass, though.  A: Smells like toasted malts, orchard fruits, cloves, and yeast. This has an impressive amount of power and strength, but doesn't quite reach the level of the top-tier tripels, in my humble opinion.  T: The flavor, however, comes much closer to reaching greatness. There is a superb balance in this beer that makes it really enjoyable to drink. The malts are lightly-toasted and have that smooth, barley-and-oat cereal grain type of character to them. The fruits aren't nearly as explosive as they are in other tripels, but the flavors of ripe bananas, pink apples, and pears taste bright and delicious. The yeasty cloves impart a nice amount of spiciness that jabs the tongue and rounds this brew out nicely.  M: Medium-bodied with a sharp and clean, crisp and smooth type of feel. But, I've gotta dock points here because, like every other Unibroue beer that I've had, it's way over-carbonated. The prickly bite gets a bit distracting the deeper I get into the bottle, which I guess is my only real complaint.  Notes: La Fin Du Monde is definitely firmly entrenched on the 'refined' side rather than the 'explosive' side of the tripel category. There are others that are more explosively fruity, spicy, and powerful. But, this is a very well-made beer that stays in perfect balance throughout. Nice melding of harmonious flavors that make this quite enjoyable. I really wish Unibroue would ease up on the carbonation, but it deserves all of the praise that it gets, nonetheless.

S - Hefeweizen yeast, black pepper, wheat.  T - White grape fruitiness that quickly puckers your mouth. Ends with a drying alcohol kick. Spicy and complex! However, I think it could benefit from just a hint of sweetness in the finish.  M - Extremely carbonated, a bit rough actually. It lacks the smooth carbonation I've experienced with similar beers.  D - A very fun beer to drink, however the spiciness and carbonation lowers its drinkability. I will have no trouble finishing the bottle though!  A ridiculously good value.

M: The perfect carbonation, it almost feels like the liquid is non-existent in your mouth, all you can feel is the flavor.  D: Good for such a strong beer. The flavors are so good and combined with the excellent mouthfeel it's hard to put down.  Notes: A very nice tripel.

22,34,Daniellobo,3.28,"Nice Canadian tripel after their Belgium ancestors and probably matching or bettering quite a few of them.  Presentation: 12 oz bottle. Illustrated label with a glowing terrain map of Quebec... The end of the world?. Lacks date of bottling or freshness, neither shows IBUs, °Plato, only Alc. (9.0%) Minimal descriptive narrative on back with glassware recommendation. Poured into a tulip glass.  A - Large and resilient foamy head that ultimately leaves a stubborn layer. Light amber-yellow tone.  S - Citrus... Orange? smell around quite a bit of spices, in particular clove. Hmmm, when it settles it has a funny popcorn buttery smell. Is this a bad bottle? It is not uncomfy, but rare... Diacetyl?  T - Sweet and smooth over an emerging alcohol base that never takes over. A bitter and spicy bite punctuates the taste.  M - It has a medium, and somewhat deceptively pale body around a significant amount of carbonation.  D - It´s actually quite drinkable, although I sense an acid aftertaste that may not settle that well with everyone.  Notes: It's a nice beer... I confess that I'm not a big fan of tripels, whether Belgium or their American reinterpretations. I like them, sure. But I'm just not a big fan. So this one does not cut it for me as a favorite or an iconic reference. I think that for tripel lovers this is probably a delight.

M - Medium to medium-light bodied, some nice carbination.  D - Ridiculously drinkable. I could put these away often and quickly and probably drink myself to death.

A: Opaque golden body with a creamy thin but constant head. S: Some spices, sweet tea, honey, Belgian yeast. T: A bit of cloves and spices. Pretty sweet through most of the taste, not too much on the sweet malts but a lot of Belgian yeasts and honey. M: Really rich and creamy, with not too much carbonation. D: Didn't finish it, but that might have been because of the great food. Will definitely have to try again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,cdpike,4.6,"Bottle poured into tulip.  Pours a beautiful golden orange that's slightly hazy but with ample foam. The nose is very inviting, with crisp Belgian spice and orange zest complimented by just a bit of alcohol. This beer has a wonderful medium body with robust effervescence. The taste is quite sweet and is not spicy as the aroma may suggest. There are strong citrus (orange) notes with a surprisingly crisp bite of hops with a somewhat dry finish. Additionally, there is a lingering flavor or that great spice. This beer has a great complex flavor that's not PERplexing. A great and accessible tripel for all occasions!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jrallen34,3.73,"I drank this from the bottle into a chalice.  This pours a very cloudy pale gold with a white head, decent lacing.  There is no distinct flavor, mostly hops.  Its taste very plain, its good, reminds me of Duvel. To me its a very high alcohol session beer. So I'd drink tihs when I get to drunk.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ClevoPiwo,4.2,"Pours a nice golden yellow color with a big head that dissipates pretty quickly leaving a nice lacing down the glass.  The smell is very good and very floral. Malt sweetness, complex fruity esters, yeast and spice are all pronounced in the bouquet.  The taste is great. Rich pale malt sweetness up front followed by that wonderful taste of belgian yeast with hints of spice and maybe a trace of hops. The alcohol is warming but well hidden.  A wonderful tripel! The alcohol is well hidden making this beer very drinkable and enjoyable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,kbeals,4.03,"A- Pours a cloudy, golden color with plenty of fizzy white head. Excellent head retention and lacing.  S- Clove, spices and sweet malts.  T- Taste is very spicy, plenty of cloves along with a taste of dried apples. A bit yeasty also.  M- Medium-light body with plenty of carbonation that results in the excellent head retention.  D- Dangerously drinkable at 9%. This beer took some getting used to for me. This was my first tripel and after about the first half a dozen sips I was hooked.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,beerman207,4.4,"A- Pours an orange color with a huge head and some very good retention leaving a nice white skim after about 3 minutes. LIttle to no lacing.  S- Picking up banana, pear, apple, coriander, and perhaps even clove.  T- Lemon, alcohol, apple, clove, yeast, very complex. Spicy! Nice.  M- Definately has some carbonation but nice. The alcohol leaves the throat warm and reminds you that it's 9%.  D - This is how a tripel should be made. I haven't had many but this is by far the best. It is in the top 100 for good reason. The alcohol is a bit high to get this a 5 but I can forgive the high alcohol here because it tastes VERY good!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,dasenebler,4,"From the 750ml bottle it pours a rich, deep golden hue. A nice and thick (but not really creamy) head forms at first, though it dissipates very quickly. Aroma is quite nice, with notes of yeast, ripe pear, banana and a bit of alcohol.  Flavor is sweet up-front, with a warming effect on the finish. As the drink continues, fruity and yeasty flavors develop. Lingering aftertaste is malty, caramel-like and yeasty. Alcohol is not terribly noticeable, and I am actually drinking this beer pretty fast. Mouthfeel is well-carbonated, yet not as huge or creamy as I had expected.  Overall this is a sweet Tripel with good complexity. La Fin du Monde is an excellent beer, but it's kind of joke that it is the number one Tripel on BA, ranking higher than all of the original Belgian versions. But who am I to argue with 1500+ reviews? I prefer a drier Tripel. To each his own.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

This beer gives you a hint of whats to come with notes of hops and citrus and just a hint of spice as you raise the glass to your mouth.  With a fantastic spicy start, and a combination of hops, cloves, citrus and just a hint of something floral this is a truly great beer.

The head is massive, about 3 fingers worth. It smells of belgian yeast, banannas, clove, and sweet dark fruits. As I drink, there is plenty of lacing left lingering on the glass.  This is a very well balanced beer with a medium mouthfeel and a very smooth taste. It has a sweet almost lemon aftertaste that lingers on the tongue.  As I have begun to notice with great belgian style beers, it is extremely drinkable which is dangerous with it's high ABV.  Overall, a superb beer leaving me wanting more. Again, kudos to the chef!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

No lacing is present on my glass halfway through the bottle. Not a very strong head/appearance. Smells like a good belgian beer, has belgian yeast, spice, a bit of fruit and maybe a smoked/malty smell to it. Tastes of belgian yeast, malts, a bit of citrus, some fruits and once again a malty/smoked taste. Good malty aftertaste toward the end. Mouthfeel is medium, smooth, has a little cream in the mouth and leaves that good belgian taste lingering on the tongue. Drinkability is good here for a tripel, taste is great and the 9% alcohol is well hidden, no alcohol taste shines through at all, doesnt feel too heavy on the stomach. Definately has that signature Unibroue canadian-belgian taste.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Many bubbles rising to the surface in contrast to the tiny flecks of sediment floating in swirls around them.  Such a fruity and malty smell. Delicious and enticing.  The taste is sweet and much the same as the smell, very fruity sour apples with firm malt flavors though out. The very taste that subliminally drove me to my love for Triples.  Feel is bubbled and alcoholic with a medium body.  A great beer. Very drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,aristeros,4.28,"Poured into a tulip. High hopes for this one. Pours a light straw, cloudy, with a huge snowy head. Excellent lacing, visible carbonation. A tartness in the nose, banana esters are the strongest scents, but you get some Chimay-like coriander and cloves.  Complex flavor. Spices, tart yellow fruit, and alcohol up front. Sweet, but not cloying malt character, well-balanced by the spices. Earthy on the back end, with a warming alcohol presence. Carbonation largely up front, but doesn't hinder the mouthfeel any at all.  Heavy alcohol in there and you can tell. I can finish my 22 oz by myself, but if I were to have another bottle (and I'd like to!) I'd be toast, even on a full stomach.  One of the best tripels I've had, but not the best. Awesome brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,greengorilla,4.35,"I poured this from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip glass.  It is a very hazy golden color with a good white head.  The smell is is very good but not overpowering. Spices come through in both the smell and the taste. It seems to have just a hint of clove taste which I usually am not real crazy about, but I like this.  The mouthfeel is world class.  The beer is certainly drinkable, but at 9.0% abv, one or two would be my limit.  Overall this is a really good beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TheTrevor,4.27,"This beer poured a hazy golden color with a two-finger off-beige head that lasted a little while. The smell is complex and represents some of the best parts about the style. There is some coriander and clove along with some fruitiness including tangerine, lemon, and a bit of banana. The taste is the same as the smell, you can almost taste something new every sip but it always seems to fit together perfectly to be complex and delicious without being overpowering or cloyingly sweet. The mouthfeel is thick with some moderate carbonation. This is probably in the top three of my varieties of tripel, which is one of my favorite styles.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ricke,3.9,"A: Hazy yellow color with a rather big ivory-colored head that stays on for a while and leaves a nice lid of lacings.  S: A fine-tuned smell, complex with every piece at its place. Some gentle clove-like spices mix with pleasant fruit aromas of mostly tangerines and lemon peel. The wheat and fragile malts provide a nice clean background. Quite a lot of phenols and some alcohol. When tripels showcase smells like this, they are really great. Clean, refreshing and complex. Well balanced. (As a note, you could almost feel the gas in the nose from the carbonation in this one).  T: Gentle spices (mostly cloves) and fruit esters of tangerine, pear and lemon peel lead the way to a nice semi-sharp malt and wheat character. It's a kind of sweet taste, but the spices act as a good counterweight. Bread crumbs, grass and a mild taste of earthy yeast. The wheat gets a little more pronounced towards the end, resulting in that semi-tart taste sometimes noticeable in wheaty beers. The finish holds some notes of herbal alcohol, phenols, a gentle spicy hop bite and bitterness and lingering fruity notes. In general, a complex and well balanced taste.  M: Moderate body, nice slick mouthfeel with a generous amount of lively carbonation.  D: Tripels are probably my least favorite style of the high ABV Belgian styles, but I think I can go as far as saying that this is one of the best tripels I've ever had. Complex and balanced, yet with plenty of that Belgian edginess. This one is really easy to drink, but deserves to be sipped and savored at a gentle pace.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,cavedave,4.5,"Pours a thick, cloudy, straw color, topped by very dense two finger off-white head that relaxes to a skin and leaves a ring of fine lace on my snifter.  Smell is that Unibroue yeast aroma (at least to me it seems all the Unibroues have the same sweet, tangy yeast bouquet to them), candy, mild spiciness, and a light breadiness that balances it into a nose that knows.  Ah, what flavor, it is astonishingly full of yeast, candy, peach, and grain. I am three sips in, it is about forty five degrees, and I can tell this is gonna get better as it warms. Yes, now that it warms subtle hints of spice and floral notes appear, and the main flavors grow, and join into a harmony of deliciousness. The finish is juicy, semi sweet, and long. The word luscious was made to describe this brew. Something is missing, though. That something is alcohol. It is MIA, not there, no taste whatever. Awesome!  Mouthfeel? As good as it gets, better than Saint Bernardus in this department. Light, full, not overcarbonated, clingy, it clears well, lasting flavor that is a joy on the palate. Next.  Drinkability, due to its 9% ABV, lack of any alcohol flavor or heat, crazy deliciousness, and perfect mouthfeel, is triple red flag warning dangerously excellent.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Plumes of small bubbles emanate from the glass bottom. Retention is superb.  Belgian yeast underlayer with pilings of apricot, clay, marigolds and grassy hops. Tart and musty.  Orange mango citrus with a soft creamsicle finish. Wet grass hops poke thier heads up here and there. No overtly discernable alcoholic presence despite a %9 abv. Semi dry. Mouthfeel is as smooth as one could want from a tripel.  Sweeter than most tripels Le Fin gets a little cloying towards the end of a bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,magine,4.38,"Poured into Duvel glass.  Pours a cloudy golden orange with rapid head that settles to a bit of a fluffy island surrounded by a smaller broken up head that sits on the top. Some lacing.  Smells of orange, yeasts, bananas, cloves, some what bready.  Brew tastes of fruits (much like the smell) and yeasts, some alcohol presence in there as well. Has a spicey peppery mouthfeel. Has a sweet taste to a degree but there is some tartness in there as well. Has a nice sticky flavor left in the aftertaste. Has the nice warming effect from the alcohol; but is very balanced (masked nicely).  This brew is delicious; very tasty, very drinkable. It could get me all kinds of shitty if I made a session out of this brew. This is why I prefer to sip and enjoy, after all it was probably meant for just that. If I could line this next to all of the other triples I have had and taste test them - I think this may be the one to beat. Very stellar.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,SLeffler27,4.37,"A big, dense, bright white meringue head hangs around for the duration over a cloudy, gold beer with unyielding carbonation. Little or no lacing is deposited on the Chimay chalice but there is a pronounced film of goodness is.  The sweet smell of fermented apples and pears is strong, with white bread, dried orange peel, white wine and subtle spices. The end of the world is very dense with sensations as yeast clearly plays a prominent role.  The flavor profile follows the aroma with mild bitterness and some barn mustiness as it continuously opens to new, subtle flavors all with light sweetness turning to tartness as it warms. There is even a touch of biting pepper in the finish.  This is a medium to full-bodied beer with a silky smooth texture punctuated by abundant carbonation. The alcohol is noticeable, though not quite as pronounced as one would anticipate.  Unibroue's offering is certainly worthy of an excursion. Fortunately, it is significantly more readily available. La Fin du Monde has become a staple for me, even an ingredient, as few beers have such versatility. Yum!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,jeffthecheff,4.03,"12 oz twist off, poured into my La Fin Du Monde stem glass. Best by Sept. 2011.  Pours a nice hazy, honey-orange with a huge white head which dies down to a half finger cap of foam, and then to small lace. I can see the yeast floating around in very fine particles  Smells very fruit-like, and not just fruity. Kind of like a mix between a bitten into apple and pear. There is also a gentle, spicy aroma. This is dominated by yeast fermentation character, with not much malt presence and only a tiny bit of hops in the nose.  Taste is sweet, with a peppery type snap to it. Bitterness is there and its firm, but overpowered by a burnt sugary sweetness. Slight citrus is also there, which really compliments the orange appearance.  On the palate you can definitley feel the fermented sugar character found in Belgian styles. Carbonation was really dancing hard on my palate at first, but the hard pour combined with all the agitation from my swirling really dropped off the carbonation dramatically. Towards the end of the glass, its a bit flat, surprisingly.  I'd imagine this is pretty versatile with food. Plus, if you get the corked and caged bottle...well that has class written all over it. I'll try it sometime.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

It was tasty good, and well worth the wait. This is in the top 100 for a reason. Poured form the bottle into a tulip.  Appearance: Pours a hazy golden yellow with a lot of sediment floating throughout the body; huge white fluffy head of 3 fingers with insane retention that takes forever to fade; strong presence of carbonation in thin lines of the tiniest bubbles I've ever seen; scant lacing holds to the sides of the glass.  Smell: Strong fruity flavors - particularly juicy granny smith apples; followed by some nice spice attributes, coriander; a nice yeasty backing and some mildly sweet maltiness; a very potent nose overall that takes little to no effort to pull from the glass.  Taste: Wow. Just like the smell - strong presence of a sour and juicy green granny smith apple that is slightly sweetened by the maltiness and yeastiness; spice is also a present factor and really compliments the fruity aspects and doesn't become an overpowering flavor in and of itself; slight presence of alcohol in the end, but it is very well masked.  Mouthfeel: body comes across as moist and juicy, and the strong carbonation keeps it very lively in the mouth; the palate is left just a little bit sticky and the belly is warmed from the alcohol.  Drinkability: While the ABV is a tad high, the flavors and smell are just too damn good to pass up and not say that this is an especially drinkable beer -- the alcohol is so well masked that it's easy to get down and the strong, robust flavors would easily compliment any meal, making the ABV a little easier to deal with.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Behind the yeast is some tart cider like notes of apple and pear.  T- The sweetness is juicy and somewhat tart. Cider, pear, and some tropical fruit comes to mind. Yeast comes through in the middle, manifesting itself as a peppery spice as well as banana. Bitterness is low and only apparent on the finish and aftertaste.  M- I think by adding the yeast the mouthfeel gets fuller. Carbonation is in the medium range and quite sharp and prickly.  D- Very nice and complex. Alcohol levels are approaching high.

Spicy notes of coriander and clove come out in the middle and linger into the finish with grassy hops, moderate bitterness, and a lingering star anise flavor.  M - Creamy, moderately heavy mouthfeel, high carbonation, and a dry finish.  D - This is a classic example of the style, one I have had so many times that it is almost difficult to review it objectively. The spice notes blend perfectly with juicy, tropical fruit notes and make for a very refreshing beer despite the high abv. The only real weak point is the appearance and the anemic head.

Definitely has a good degree of sweetness to it from the heavy malt character along with a good dose of spiciness in there....which, the spices here seem to be a bit more aggressive and ""peppery"" than the typical clove spice in many other beers. Mouthfeel is pretty thick.  The finish is a mix of sweet esters, a heavy dose of spice and a little booziness sneaking through as well. At 9 percent ABV, that isn't really a surprise...it's actually masked pretty well for such a high level of alcohol. Hops are nearly non-existant at the end.  All in all, it's a favorite of mine and I recommend it to anybody who loves Belgians...I also think it could be a good gateway beer to get people into better beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,PintOHops,4.2,"Poured from a corked 750ml bottle into a goblet.  Appearance/Smell - Appears a clouded golden/straw color with a massive head and decent retention. Attractive tiny carbonation bubbles can be seen coming up the rim of the glass, and it leaves some broken & splashy lacing. Smells of a big semi sweet banana nose, hints of clove, corn husk, and orange zests. Some fruity grape & pair notes as well, and a very subtle buttery/toffee, as it warms, lots of alcoholic aroma pronounces itself well, sorta clouding most of the smell.  Taste/Mouthfeel - Tastes of a semi bright citrus note that hits the tongue first, and then washes away with a big corn husk/grainy/bisciuty flavor. Hints of banana, but not as strong as in the smell, orange zest notes seem to come between all flavors. Alcohol burn finishes this one as expected, and corn husk & banana notes seem to linger a bit. Mouthfeel has a firm bite of carbonation, along with a slightly smooth & silky feel, medium-full bodied but more so on the medium side.  Drinkability/Final thoughts - I'm not a big fan of Tripels, but I do appreciate them, this one was balanced well without being so alcoholic, overly bitey, and harsh, and the drinkability was great although the ABV is very high. I could easily put down a couple small goblets of this great brew on a cool day, I did however get a little tired of the flavors after a couple goblets, so I wouldn't really enjoy drinking anymore than that.

22,34,Murchmac,4.2,"Consumed on the 4th of July as fireworks were exploding around the house.  Great beer, big frothy head, cloudy, pretty yellow. Looks like freedom.  Fruity notes, citrus, pears.  Delicious taste fruity, yeasty, fresh, crisp.  Nicely carbonated. Just an overall kick ass beer made in the USA. U-S-A!  P.S. I know it's made in canada, but since we pretty much own them, it's like it's brewed here.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TheViolator666,2.81,"Appearance: Looks nice. Golden in color with a huge frothy white head. Slight amount of lacing, nothing spectacular.  Smell: Smells strongly of yeast and a slight hint of citrus.  Taste: The yeast is overpowering, just like any other unfiltered ""ale on lees"" beer I've had thus far. Just when I think I can taste citrus, the yeast takes over. I can't help but get the same overwhelming taste out of all of these. There is a warming alcohol taste at the very end, but no too overpowering... probably the best thing about this beer.  Mouthfeel: Highly carbonated.  I'm really not sure how people can drink these types of yeasty beers regularly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,berley31,4.48,"Poured with a large, off-white head that eventually diminished to about one-finger size. Body was hazy, with light particles, and a dark yellow color. Lacing was fair. Very nice aroma... average yeast, some fruitiness as well. Great on the palate... full body, creamy, with lively carbonation. You can taste light alcohol, but it's not overwhelming at all. The fruit comes through again, and stays with you for a good amount of time. Delicious. A fantastic tripel; I'm very happy Unibroue is here in Canada to provide us with authentic-tasting Belgium brews.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,kinghotpants,4.4,"Appearance. LFDM pours golden and a touch hazy, with one or two fingers of thick white head that almost looks like cappuccino foam. I was drinking it in the dark, so this is all I managed to get.  Smell. Personally, I think LFDM smells like sweet spices - the kind of things you'd put in a pie, but nothing specific. I also get some fruit here; maybe a hint of apple or peach. Then the alcohol smell comes wafting out like a warning sign, which I usually proceed to ignore.  Taste. Oh, baby. Estery fruit and spice, a little phenolic clove, a whole metric ton (they're Canadians after all) of malt, and a smack of alcohol at the end. A touch of hop bitterness, but nothing to write home about.  Mouthfeel. There's a decent amount of carbonation on this beer, so it sparkles on the tongue, but it has that big malty smoothness that I enjoy quite a bit.  As a final note, I would like to point out that, anecdotally, a beer with a lot of esters and fusel alcohols will tend to give you a bigger, meaner hangover than one without, so be careful if you're going to get all messed up on this brew. You may live to regret it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

A bit of orange citrus. A deep inhale brings out some yeasty undertones.  T: Sweet with some frutiness. I taste mainly pear. I get some clove and other herbal notes I can't quite place.  M: It is crisp and dry up front. The body is feels light because of the high carbonation. I think the finish is a bit sticky, more so than I am used to.  D: I like this beer. It is easy to drink, but not as much as other tripels I have encountered. It goes down easy, but the alcohol let its presence be known.  Notes: I am torn with this beer. I really enjoy it, but I prefer other tripels a bit more.

22,34,blaje,4.62,"Yes, belive or not, bt this 750ml bottle was brewed in the last millennium! 1999 in fact. No better day than today (St-Jean-Baptiste day in Québec) to drink probably the best triple that is brewed in the Province. Certainly one of my all time favourite beer.That's it.  Let's find out if 10 years of ageing add something (or removed) to this brew....  Right at the opening, the cork pop out loud. Still lots of carbonation in here! Still alive and well after this long wait. Poured nice straw yellow, a touch of red (would say peach like) and producing a nice white to off-white coloured head that appears creamy and last a long time... That's a nice surprise for a beer that age.  Nose: Sweetness, caramel, apple, no banana ester as noted on previous tasting of aged FDM before. Spices as gone away a bit so as the herb and yeast smell. It all blends together without any frank distinction of one and the other. Very complex.  Mouth: Carbonation is medium low and went out more rapidly then the younger version. Even becoming flat before I even hit the bottom of the glass :(...  Overall: This ageing gives proof to you that this beer can handle the road for a long cellaring. I would guess that in a perfect cellar (which is really not my case) this beer would handle the road for a good 15 years.  I scored low on this review because of the age of the beer. I could easily scored 5/5 on taste, appearance and mouthfeel on a fresh brew... Try this beer. It's really a must!!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,hreb,4.15,"Cold 12 oz bottle poured into tulip-style Ommegang chalice. Bottle claims a best before date of 10-16-11. Beer pours a surprisingly light golden color with a HUGE white head, which forms a solid hoppy meringue left unperturbed. A small amount of sediment lands on the top of the foam.  First sip is refreshing and crisp while carrying a lot of flavor: citrus, cane sugar, piney hops. The aftertaste brings through a more refined barley flavor. The carbonation is pleasantly fine, and lacing (now that the head has been drunk) is moderate. As the beer warms, a slight ester note comes out.  Overall this beer is delightfully executed. There's no caramely sweetness, nor overpowering bitterness, nor wacky, inappropriate ester flavors, and yet the 9% ABV is completely masked. There are better Tripels, but ones as pleasant to drink as this are rare.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Brenden,4.73,"I've had a couple of these because it's just too good not to. I only just found my most recent notes.  The appearance is nice but doesn't quite do justice to what is to come. The color is a cloudy pale gold. There's a nice cascading effect that produces a fluffy white head that retains well and leaves a little sticky lacing in patches. There's lots on the nose and the complexity shines through before the first sip. Notes of fruits that seem more like natural juices than candied, though there is a sugary note as well, are backed by a yeast and a gentle spice. There's a zesty apple bite, more like cider than juice, and a paler sort of banana aroma. Further back are cloves and an earthy something. A huge malt backing with incredible balance and a whole complexity of flavors make this an incredible brew. Everything on the nose with an alcoholic tint that is warming rather than off-putting. Lots of grains underneath and a hops bitterness that isn't overwhelmed but gives a nice spine to this It's about as thick as can be without being syrupy and very smooth. The body is moderate to full and carbonation is at a great level. This one's much more drinkable than the high ABV would typically allow. Pretty amazing, really.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S- smells spicy with some hints of fruit- banana mostly, with some apple or something lingering. Definitely lots of clove come through on this one.  T- wow. Unbelievable balance to this tripel. The initial spicy bite subsides into a creamy and smooth banana/clove taste... kind of like a hefeweizen but more intense. There is some maltiness to speak of... a bready taste lingers in the back of your throat.  M- smooth yet spicy... very enjoyable.  D- one 750 ml bottle is enough for one sitting.

22,34,ChopperSmith,4.42,"Poured into a tulip glass from a chilled 750ml bottle.  Appearance: Nice slightly cloudy golden/orange color. Fizzy foamy head that didn't retain long or leave any lacing.  Smell: Very sweet and floral with a little underlying spice. Scents of cloves and citrus. Smells delicious.  Taste: Spicy, yeasty, and a tang of citrus. Sweet and slightly dry. Very satisfying taste. An almost perfect example (maybe a perfect example?) of a Belgian Tripel style with just the right mix of sweetness, yeast and spices.  Mouthfeel: A good medium bodied mouth feel with an abundance of tiny carbonation bubbles, but not overly so.  Drinkability: A perfect and very tasty Tripel with outstanding flavor and no strong alcohol taste or warmth for a relatively high ABV brew. Could easily do a session with this one, and I have. For a Canadian made Belgian Tripel style, this is one of the tastiest examples of the style I can think of, beating out several Belgian made Tripels that I like quite a bit.

You can't see through this at all but there are no chunks of sediment to be found. The head sucks but the colour is good.  Big, sweet smell. Roasted malt, caramel, grapefruit, lemon/lime, cotton candy. Really, really nice smell.  The smell is better than the taste but it still tastes great. Not as sweet as the smell would suggest. Wheat, spices, yeast, citrus rind, some hops in the background. Lots of other flavours I can't figure out; it's a complex beer. Dry aftertaste. This could be a 5% beer for how smooth it is; the 9% is really not noticeable at all.  Medium-light bodied. As a triple, maybe it could be a little creamier. Moderately carbonated.

A little disapointing, but a torrential stream of bubbles from the bottom of the goblet refreshes the thin cap and keeps the beer visually interesting.  Aroma is light banana and fruit sweetness with a bready, yeasty spice. Complex but very complementary and unified.  Flavor starts with a light honey, fruit sweetness. Then the bread enters. Spice comes in late and stays strong in the finish, joined by a moderate bitterness. An obvious, but gentle alcoholic warmth. As in the aroma, all these disparate elements blend effortlessly together.  There's so much flavor, that it seems heavier than it is but the body remains light and dry. Carbonation can be a bit distracting, especially the first few sips of a new pour.  I've avoided Unibroue because I've been rather isolationist... but score one for Canada, this is a tasty brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Some warming alcohol detected at the end of each swallow, leaving a somewhat dry finish.  This really does feel light and refreshing, I dunno if it's possible to disguise alcohol as well as Unibroue have achieved with this beer. Sure there is a bit of a warming sensation but that really is the only hint at the ABV of the brew. For that I must give this a 5 for drinkability.

Usually don't care too much for the style but this is very nice. M= high carbonation and a dryer clean finish. Very smooth and medium body. D= pretty good. Ill most likely be seeking this one out again sometime. Fun little beer with just enough complexity and still your able to sit and sip it for a while without thinking too much.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,Yeastcakes,4.3,"Serving notes - snifter, cool (45F) A - banana phenols, cinnamon and clove esters and alcohol. Sour notes. Lemon emerges as the beer warms. A - three fingers of brilliant white head, some rockiness. Hazy amber yellow. M - high carbonation, medium body. Alcohol flavor present but not too hot. T - Malty sweetness forms the backbone from which everything else rests on the flavor. Spicy esters, pear and banana flavors compete for dominance. Alcohol flavors also are present.

22,34,seand,4.37,"Poured into a large red wine glass.  A: Pours a slightly cloudy light amber, with a finger or so of white head. The head dissipates pretty quickly, but leaves a nice ring around the edge of the glass. Decent lacing.  S: Sweetness dominates, with hints of mild citrus and spices.  T: Much like the nose, with sweetness followed by hints of fruit and spices.  M: Good carbonation, medium bodied.

This dissipates quickly, leaving only a little bit of lacing.  S: Very laid back, not as strong or complex as I would have thought. Smells very sweet. Orchard apples instead of green apples, white grapes and a bit of peppery spice. Belgian yeast characteristics not detectable, or very mild.  T: Follows through on the nose, but in a much more bold and complex manner. Big fruity sweetness on this one balanced nicely by a peppery clove spice. The sweetness slams into a tart dry finish. Alcohol is masked nicely, but comes through the spiciness as the beer warms.  M: Thin to medium body. High carbonation, nice tongue zap on the way down.  D: Could have a few of these despite the abv.  Really nice example of the style. Very impressed.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,RunDWP,4.2,"It only makes sense that I drink this while travelling in Quebec City.  Pours a hazy oragne with a fizzy head. Nice clove, spicy and yeasty aroma. Taste is much of the same, somewhat complex, with a tart fruityness that has a cherry-like character, but its hard to put my finger exactly on it, and a slight note of alcohol. Nice level of carbonation and mouthfeel and really enjoyable to drink with all that complexity and alcohol. Good example of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Overall very solid Tripel and one of the best ever.  appearance: golden and cloudy. decent head rentention  smell: fruit, slight hops  taste: was a great real belgian golden ale, good, and no overpowering for how strong it was, fruits and spicy tatste couldn't indentify exactly but very tasty  mouthfeel: rich and high carbonation  drinkability: I was pleasantly suprised, it's not overrated, smooth and easy for how stong the ABV is.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bulletrain76,3.8,"75cl bottle shared with larryLSB. Hazy golden orange color with a lasting white head. The aroma is yeasty and quite fruity with lots of tangy apricot and tangerine. The flavor is also yeasty, with some of that apricot sweetness, some citric tartness and alcohol. There is definitely some spiciness too. Full-bodied with lively carbonation. When I added the yeast at the end, the alcohol really smoothed out and this became a very nice tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Stavage,4.42,"Pours a medium light golden colour with a bubbly off white head which retains itself for a good time before reducing to a decent sticky lacing.  The smell is sweet and aromatic. Sweet like a sweet white wine or champagne with some other fruits mingled in and a nice touch of spiciness. The tell tale smell of yeast and malt is there to remind you this is a beer though.  At first I'm struck by a fruity wine like sweetness which is soon balanced by a more soothing malt like sweetness. There is a complexity of all different kinds of fruity estery tastes and mild malt tastes and spiciness and just a hint of hops. I'll be honest any sweeter and stickier and this would have been too much for me (I generally steer clear of white wines and something about this drop reminded me somewhat of a dry sweet white wine). BUT it wasn't any sweeter and stickier and the aged fruity complexity mingled perfectly with my platter of aged cheddars and grapes.  Mouthfeel was very smooth, a little bit creamy with relatively high carbonation. Again with wine comparisons, it was almost a champagne like carbonation though lighter.  It'd definitely a rich beer, and one that needs to be sipped. I shared a tall bottle of this with my old man for his birthday and I must say I think I'm partially glad I had someone to share the bottle with. But what can I say it went down smoothly and I savoured each and every sip, I didn't want to waste a drop without enjoying its complexities.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JMBSH,3.88,"A - A golden color with an unfiltered haze. Pours with alot of head that quickly disappears to almost nothing.  S - A sweet, spicy, citrus like scent.  T - A sweet but also tart cider with a great deal of alcohol behind it. Apple cider it what I would say it reminds me of.  M - A surpricing amount of carbonation. If you keep some in your mouth for a few seconds, you can feel the carbonation build up in your mouth.  D - A little too sweet and tart for my taste but a good example of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,dhd1491,4.15,"Pours cloudy yellow with thin white head that quickly dissipates. Aroma is citrusy and strangely reminiscent of soap. Taste is full of allspice, cloves, and sweet malts. Very light mouthfeel for such a high ABV. High carbonation and fizziness in the mouth which seems consistent with the style, but not my favorite feature; distracts from the flavor.  High ABV is evident in the finish. Also by the way the room starts to slowly spin as one approaches the bottom of the glass.  Overall, a very interesting, easy-to-drink brew. Lots of taste nuances in a powerful package. I think that this may not be my absolute favorite style of beer...I would choose a double IPA any day of the week. However, in the right setting...say, a hot summer day, sitting outside with friends with nothing pressing, when you don't mind tying one on...this is a great choice.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,MVotter,4.35,"Aroma from the top of the freshly opened bottle: yeast and big spices!  Aroma after the pour: yeast.  La Fin Du Monde poured into a tall pils glass with a towering, towering pale, white head. It settles back to 3 fingers in a minute, some lacing. The body of the beer is a foggy gold.  This is a delicious brew; proud to say it's my first tripel. The spice notes abound. A nice, spicy, peppery cinnamon.  At 9% abv, I'm always prepared to meet ""the ultra chewy."" Not so in La Fin. The mouthfeel is actually nice and bubbly, which you would expect from a Belgian/French ale style ... and without an excess of gravity. And, depending upon your mood, you can pour down the center for a less effervescent experience, or down the side for some lively carbonation.  This is a ""dangerously"" drinkable brew ... a sipper, for sure, at 9%.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S = Fragrant citrus, natural yeast, small alcohol smell, but no skunky anything  T = Flowery, Complex in its simplicity, long lasting taste that lasts long after the drink is complete. Wonderful bitter and not overly hoppy.  M = A wonderful tingle through the whole mouth. Natural carbonation and a biting swallow. Thick resin like feel to the brew.

22,34,ColForbinBC,4.18,"750mL bottle poured into a tulip  A brilliant golden color with a touch of orange and a huge, fluffy bone white cap. The head settled a little quicker than I would like and left no lacing, otherwise this beer is very pretty.  A rather mild aroma. Doesn't reach out of the glass the way the best tripels do. Granny smith apples and prickly pears with a touch of clove and white pepper. Not overly complex and a little timid.  Sweet fruity esters up front with a spicy kick and a fusol alcohol finish that really lingers. The spice accentuates the alcohol burn as time progresses. Still, a rather delicate take. It never really grabs you, but maybe that is their objective.  Medium body with a creamy, luxurious mouthfeel. An alocohol burn and a touch of sweetness linger long. But I really can't complain, the mouthfeel is near perfect.  The mouthfeel is so creamy and lush and the flavor profile so delicate that this beer drinks extremely well. However, that 9% is no joke and can definitley pack a punch.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Genry,4.13,"Enjoyed Maudite and Unibroue's blonde, but this takes the cake.  Poured a steady thick head, with lots of bubbling and yeast rising. Appearance is wonderful, thick and creamy orange that tapers off at the bottom, and the head leaves a good bit of lacing.  Smells of sharp, crisp citrus.  Taste is pleasing, spicy and comes with the same citrus scented except stronger -- now accompanied by honey and fruit. There is a hint of raspberry, and the high alcohol content is also present, but not overpowering as in some strong brew.  Mouthfeel is very smooth, no cling to it, with lots of hops and roll on the tongue.  Quite easily drinkable, and repeatively so, though be wary -- 9% can creep up on you, especially when contained in such a well-layered beer. A brew to sip, not chug.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

A real overload of flavors, and I mean that in a great way, leaves your mouth nice and spicy. 9% abv but you can't taste it  Mouthfeel: Well carbonated but clean mouth feel.  Drinkability: Easy to drink, drink it slow because is very tasty. Perhaps a bit too carbonated for some. People complained of its sweetness but I just don't see it. This is very enjoyable and leaves your mouth tasting of clove and orange.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

T- Yeasty spices. Clove and a little grape. Good for a tripel, spicer than I expected. A little phenolic. Pleasant. The Belgian yeast really takes a prominent role.  M- Well carbonated, medium to light bodied. Dry finish. Nothing wrong here.  D- I could stick with it for a while, but I prefer a good Belgian dark ale to the tripels.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,SpencerSauce,4.9,My favorite tripel possibly. Had out of both 750ml and regular bottle. This review was from the bottle. 750ml is better IMO. Using a chalice.  A- sexy orangish gold color that is translucent. Thick white head on my pour. Very bubbly almost champagne like.  S- Spicy with some fruity esters. I love the smell of this beer. Typical belgian yeast strain smell.  T- You get your belgian yeast. Slight spice and even less fruit. perfectly blended if you ask me.  M- your clean belgian yeast tripel mouthfeel.

22,34,laituegonflable,3.97,"Enjoyed from a snifter.  Pours a pretty straight orange colour, basically the colour of Fanta, with a generous Belgian head, has thinned out a bit now but still sticks around in a resilient white crown. Kept alive by a quick and constant stream of bubbles. Lacing is excellent, although it webs out and drops down quite easily. An excellent-looking beer.  This had a very strong apricot aroma when I first poured it, less obvious now. Strong hint of orange peel and a generous hit of cloves on the nose though. There is a marmalade sweetness on there which is that apricot I first detected. The fruit is prevalent, but balanced beautifully with a spicy Belgian character, conjuring up coriander, a bit of pine and possibly cumin. Complex and delicious.  Potent flavours on that, for sure. A champagne character comes through first and then abdicates to a resiny hop finish. Throughout the palate is a candy sweetness on the back of the tongue, aspects of banana, maybe some deep red apple and a hint of passionfruit. I hate to say it - and can it be true - but there is a distinct, even obvious, alcohol on this. The flavours are strong but the 9% is stronger. Unlike so many Unibroues, this one could never attend a masquerade ball as a session beer. Mouthfeel is very, very full and thick but with a delightful tingling of bubbles, a real treat.  It's a shame about the alcohol poking its head out, really. But more than that, it's a disappointment that the delicious springlike flavours on this can't overcome, otherwise this would be an exceptionally drinkable beer. As it is, it's just delicious instead.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TexIndy,4.44,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my NBB glass. Back label had a best by date of 11-11-11. It was a hazy golden color with tons of yeast bits floating around. It had tons of carb streams but no lacing. It had an average sized fizzy white head that quickly settled into nothing. No lacing. This varied from many other reviews that described a large sustained head and lacing.  The aroma was excellent. Fruity, yeasty and sweet. Found myself swirling and sniffing constantly to get fresh hits of it. The taste was also excellent. Smooth from start to finish with spicy, fruity base and mild after-taste. The alcohol is not present in either the aroma or taste. For 9%, it goes down too smooth.  Overall, an excellent beer and an excellent tripel. Highly recommend. Lately, I've been avoiding tripels and this one makes me wonder why. Not going to be a regular in the rotation but this should be worth couple bottles a year, especially the smaller size so I can have something else after.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TLove,4.26,"22oz bomber to Chimay glass.  Appearance is orange and amber with a very thin head and loose lacing.  A tad bit of coriander and cinnamon in the smell, with some warm nectarine and a light cherry port scent.  Citrus rolls through to the taste, as does the spice, with a bit of wheat and hoppy acidity, where the malty, subtle alcohol begins to roll in.  Quite delicious in the mouth. Finishes smooth and replenishing to the taste buds. A bit of tartness does not detract in the least from the superior drinkability of this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,infi,4.22,"Poured into a snifter.  Pours a translucent yellowish and golden color with minimal head and very little lacing on the lining of glass. Great amount of effervescence from the yeast throughout the duration of being in the glass. It smells pretty yeasty and bready with generous hints of spice and fruit. The alcohol isn't very odorous, but after a few whiffs it's detectable. At first tasting, the initial taste is very smooth and the banana comes into play. In the aftertaste, the yeast and spice becomes palpable. For a 9% ABV, the alcohol is masked very well. You can hardly taste it, but the after effects come into play after a glass or two. The mouthfeel of the beer has a pretty light to medium body feel with little carbonation that lines the mouth and tickles the tongue. Great aftertaste.  La Fin du Monde is definitely a great Tripel with fantastic qualities. Definitely a brew to be noted of and end a night with.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,DannyS,4.4,"Served in a tulip glass, poured from a 12 oz. bottle.  A - Very hazy, bright orange amber with a thin head that dissipates quick and leaves loose little bits of lacing.  S - Lots of upfront fruit and spice, with a tad of alcohol burn in the back.  T - Belgian sugar and fruit are upfront, backed by subtle clove, wheat, and yeast. Some citrus and alcohol, but i had to reach hard to detect those. Alcohol is hidden very well. Finishes just slghtly bitter.  M - carbonation is high but the body is fairly weighty. Most excellent.  D - As I said, the alcohol's hidden very well, and it drinks easily enough to allow repeat drinking, just as long as you weren't planning on being sober.  Overall - Happy 100th review to me, and what a brew to choose for it. If this is the end of the world, bring it on!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,aphor,5,"First I have to remind drinkers that Belgian ales have a sediment of yeast which contains a lot of the flavor potential in the beer. How you pour it makes a huge difference in what kind of cloudiness the beer will exhibit and what kind of flavor you will taste.  Second I have to remind folks about temperature. There's an even greater spectrum of aromas and flavors depending upon the temperature of the beer when it's served.  I highly recommend, assuming you bought this because you like Belgian ales, turning your bottle upside down before opening and gently swirling the bubble of air around the bottle's botom to guarantee every bit of sediment is suspended in the drink before you pour it. Hold the bottle up to a light source as you do this to make sure you're swirling vigorously enough but gently enough that the air bubble does not break up into a foam inside the bottle.  I also recommend serving this beer at the warmish temperature of 50 degrees Fahrenheit. You will get a richer head on pour, and the flavors will be very rich and varied.  From this baseline, experiment with colder (or warmer) temperatures, and pour the glass from a bottle that has completely settled, stopping before any of the cloudiness has hit the glass.  Experimenting with the four extremes of cold/warm cloudy/clear will consume a 4-pack of 12 oz. bottles. This will give you a range of the flavors you should expect from this beer. Probably all Belgian ales, especially Tripels, will have a lot more to offer with this knowledge.  Knowing what to expect, I am impressed with the pleasant experience of this beer served cold/clear, cold/cloudy, warm/clear, warm/cloudy.  Caveat: if you don't read the label about the alcohol content, you will be surprised. Ironically I think I tasted the alcohol more in the cleaner, slightly bitter body of the cold/clear pour. The sediment provides flavors that mask the alcohol, and warmth seems to potentiate those other flavors more than the alcocol.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JRed,4.7,"Beautiful radiant golden color with fizzy white head. Alcohol, orange peels, citrus, light fruit, apple skins, and cloves in the aroma. Wow, taste is quite the eye opener.

Incredibly flavored and a sure delicacy to be considered.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,iNHaze,3.83,"From a 750mL to a wine glass  This beer poured a golden yellow with a lot of suspended sediment. This could have been the result of the hour or two I gave it to cool and settle out before tasting after I purchased it, I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. 1/2"" of foamy head which lingered to the end of the glass. Bubbles constantly like a glass of champagne.  Smells very wheaty. This is kind of suprising from a tripel. Can't detect alcohol in the aroma, well hidden for a 9.0%  Experienced a sharp bite of carbonation at first, which fades to a very wheaty body. Reminded me of Hoegaarden for some reason. I find this confusing for the style, though it was not altogether unpleasant. This mellowed to an almost candy-sweet aftertaste, which lingered to the next sip. Didn't get much hoppiness, maybe just a bit of bitter. A lot of wheat though.. Alcohol was again very well hidden for a beer of this strength.  Mouthfeel was soda-like and fizzy. Not too full, reminded me of a mouth full of sprite.  Overall, I'm not sure if I got a strange batch or what, but this beer was not what I was expecting. I'm a big fan of tripels, and La Fin kind of threw me for a loop. It wasn't bad really, just took me by suprise I suppose. I'll definitely be trying this again to see if I had a fluke experience or what.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Docer,4.21,"Ok.. I kept hearing a lot about this beer on this site... and low and behold.. it's a regular at a local Fred Meyer over my way... I am not a huge fan of Belgians as already this smells kind of like one... but I will try and be as fair as I possibly can... as you can see though my review on Stones Vertical Epic 08.08.08 was way low... I just had to pour it out... not for me. Best by Feb. 11th of 2010.  - Nice cloudy and bright yellow look... very unique from any other brew I have ever had. Great bubbly white head that diminished rather quickly to a haze of white bubbly lace.. none that looks like it will stick.. though presses the sides of my tumbler glass.  - A bready grainy scent... with a bit of oak and hardwood... and banana yeast... (oh no... not another Belgian... :-/) Some hops in there too.... bitter, pine...  - Impressed... makes me want to venture out to more Belgians.... Zesty lemon citrus up front... bready yeast.. strong balanced malt... so complex and balanced in flavor... I don't think I have had a brew that contains so many different avenues of flavor... kind of like Janice Joplins vocal range of highs and lows.... rather strong though... small tad bit of banana.. caramel... clear water... grain and barley.. but refreshingly warm.  - For some reason the mouthfeel reminds me of being an 18 yr. old dumbass who stayed up way too late and still fisting a bottle of Rainier Ale. Something I could drink myself sober with. A bit dry and lingers with all of the above flavors... even hops! Not oily but a bit of ester..  - Super drinkable for a Belgian... a beer and style all in its own though i think. More complex than the usual... and I can only compare this to the Stone Vertical that I tried and hated... but this is far better and actually might make me purchase a fine Belgian in the near future like this one.

22,34,degerbah,4.66,One of my all time favorites. Bought a bottle at the Catskellar on UC's campus which has turned into a really superior place to get decent beer in Cincinnati.  Poured a cloudy blonde with a thick head. The smell is the spicy aroma that I equate with all unibroue products. Very heavy flavor with cloves and other spices easily overpowered the pizza I was eating.

Taste is very, very good. Extremely flavorful - feels saturated with yeast. Heavy on the malt.  Chewy in the mouth. Active buzz from carbonation.  Taste makes it drinkable, carbonation cuts down on this a bit, as does the 9% ABV.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,scootny,4.7,"A majestic head and a cloudy golden amber. Retention and lacing are very good A good amount of carbonation and bits yeast.  Smell is sweet malt and hint of honey. Light fruits with with a yeast funk and mild floral hoppiness.  Taste as good as it gets. A reproduction of the nose with a larger light honey sweetness and silky feel. The fruitiness blossoms with every sip. Apples, pears, grapes, and banana are all here. A tropical fruit blend as well. Pineapple, mango being the main players. Beyond expert in balance and amounts. A perky light spicyness and wheat like tanginess add depth. The yeast fruitiness binds it together wonderfully. A soft dryness in the mildly hoppy finish leaves sweet dinner rolls in the back of the throat and roof of my mouth. Feel is medium and creamy soft in the carbonation.  A quenching restorative on a hot night like tonight while complex enough to work with just about any meal. You can drink this one easily and deeply as there is nothing but superb flavor in the glass and no trace of the alcohol.  This is so good the Belgians are probably considering declaring war.

22,34,Farrell,4.88,What could one possibly say about La Fin Du Monde?  That it's delicate subtly is only matched by its underlining complexity?  That the scent of ripe fruit rewards the drinker with unparalleled spice and yeast notes?  That the tulup glass fills magnificently with the golden elixir to showcase it world class appearance?  Or that it's 9% ABV is masked so masterfully that even the most jaded drinker will be impressed by its drinkability?  With that said La Fin Du Monde is easily one of the best triples ever brewed and makes a strong case for itself to be one of the best beers ever brewed. Its craftsmanship rivals that of even the top genuine Belgium breweries.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

T- Complex flavor overload that consist of mainly alcohol esters, wheat, spices, and malt. I could never begin to explain the massive taste this beer packs.

22,34,Epicedion,4.43,"Poured into my favorite 285mL weiss glass.  A: Wow, this beer looks fantastic. Even on a very tentative pour I got a few inches of thick, poofy foam that settled down to a good inch or so. The beer underneath is a cloudy deep yellow to shiny gold. Little bubbles continuously creep up from the bottom of the glass. By the bottom of the glass there's only a very thin head with moderate lacing to 2/3 of the way up the glass.  S: I'm not getting a lot of smell from this one. But what I get is distinct citrus and floral. There's a little bit of grain back there for balance. But as I said, the smell isn't particularly powerful. It's pleasant and soothing, as opposed to overpowering.  T: A hit of sweetness at first, but not sugary. More like biting into a lightly sweet fruit, maybe a not-quite-ripe orange. Lots of complexity. Grains -- wheat? Light spice. A neat bitterness toward the end and on the finish. Very clean, somewhat crisp. No booze in the taste. Fairly distinctive lingering orange zest flavor. This beer is fantastic. It's perfectly balanced, it's inviting, it's neither beery or boozey. I think just about anyone could drink this and enjoy it.  M: Medium -- there's a big boost from how foamy this beer is. The carbonation is nice and moves the flavors around well. Notably for this 9% beer there's pretty much no astringent alcohol. Great!  D: Dangerous. Crisp, highly drinkable. Cool on a hot day. I'm having to force myself to slow down, because I know otherwise this 9% is going to catch up and kick my butt!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,cooncat,3.88,"Decanted into my Stone Tulip glass.  On the pour you get a cloudy golden-orange brew, topped by a large creamy head. The head is not long lasting (unfortunately), and there is minimal lacing.  The nose is fruity, spicy and malty all at once. I'm detecting some citrus type fruits, a touch of white pepper and perhaps some corriander. The nose is a bit restrained .. wish it could be bigger.  The taste is bold and Belgian. A spicy maltiness comes to the fore, with mild fruity esters in the background. Hops are not noticeable, and the alcolhol is just barely noticeable. Mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation makes for a wonderful and refreshing experience. Flavors dance on your palate.  Dangerously drinkable, enjoy this out of a snifter type glass or a tulip, sit back, and contemplate 'the end of the world' (which is what La Fin du Mond translates into).

S- smelled wild, almost like a sour beer, which was really cool. not quite overpowering but you could smell the spices and malt very well.  T- tasted lighter than it smelled at first but as it warmed up the taste came out more and more, sweet, spicy and some warming alcohol. Great beer. yum.  M- light and refreshing.

22,34,AMoceri7,4.1,"Very very different.  A: Very wit like, looks identical to a Blue Moon with just a pinch of amber. Golden yellow.Thick frothy white head that dissipates quickly to a small thin layer but endures till the last drop.  S: Wit in character as well, with very strong floral perfume like fragrances. Hops are definitely evident in the masking of this brew with a strong sweetness in the background. All things December odors, clove, coriander and for sure wildflower honey. Nothing pungent but a bit musky.  T: Wow, what in the world. I dont think I have ever had anything like this. Im sure this is not my style of beer but this is definitely good. I honestly am having a hard time distinguishing the malt character here and I dont taste bananas as prevalent as it seemed in a couple other reviews. What does stand out is an obscure mystery flavor wrapped up in a huge amount of spice, hops and honey. Hops are earthy and bitter which is nice and ALL OVER this brew. The spices that seem obvious are clove, cardamom, black pepper, chamomile and strong citrus coriander and with the more I drink it I notice a huge orange rind flavor. The honey is obvious wildflower and wild it is. Very very different.  M: Fully carbonated with non stop everlasting bubbles. A bit high for my liking but it seems perfect for the brew.  D: This is where it seems to fail. Im not sure I could do more than one of these. Not bad though.  Overall: Very interesting beer, I finished this about an hour ago and my palate is still smashed up with the flavors from it. Probably wont buy again, due to the session capabilities of it.

22,34,Buschyfor3,4.64,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with silver foil wrapping into a 14 oz mug.  A: A hazy, golden straw color; somewhat cloudy because of the sediment in the bottle (bottle conditioned). 2 finger thick, dense and bubbly white head which quickly dissipated. No lacing whatsoever.  S: Sweet fruit esters (apples and pears come to mind). I'm also picking up a heavy but sweet doughy/yeasty scent. Some residual hints of brewing spices (coriander, nutmeg, cinnamon) and a touch of hops.  T: AMAZING! A delicious, sweet flavor dominates at the start, again hinting at apples and pears, bananas (probably from the Belgian-style yeast strain). Remarkably, the fruit flavor profile reminds me of a Weihenstephaner, only sweeter. There is a bit of a crisp, spicy edge to this beer, not from the alcohol, but more of a citrusy, rind-like spice, possibly from orange peels and coriander. Mid sip, light fruit flavors transitions into the mellower malt profile, primarily a yeasty, freshly-baked bread flavor. Finish is reminiscent of champagne - crisp, effervescent and yet highly refreshing and oh so tempting - I don't want the flavors to end! Must. Take. Another. Sip.  M: Great carbonation give this beer a light, crispy, tingly mouthfeel - again, reminiscent of champagne.  D: 9% ABV? Are you kidding... no way. This beer is devilish because the alcohol is so expertly hidden; I only get a slight warming effect! Add that to the delicious blend of crisp fruity and malty, bready flavors and this beer is the picture of drinkability on a warm spring evening.  I am highly impressed with La Fin Du Monde. I'm even more impressed given the fact that this beer is readily available around home, and at killer prices ($6.99 for a 750? Yes please!). A exemplary beer, especially paired with fresh sushi (California and Rainbow Tuna/Salmon Rolls).

22,34,Amnoisis,4.35,"A - Golden, slightly cloudy. Head pours with 2 fingers of thick, tight remnants lasting roughly two minutes.  S - Instant banana, followed by the hops, followed by the pear. Lasting wafting acidity afterwards. Sweet and slightly sour.  T - Smooth. Delicious. Banana and hops are immediate and slight, with pear and the lasting alcohol bitterness following and lasting between drinks. At 9% ABV, has the potential to stay with you. Overall, described as bright and warming.  M - Smooth, thick and even a little creamy. The carbonation isn't overbearing, and adds a slight, necessary edge to the drink helping it go down very smoothly.  D - Definitely a good opener. Drinking these all night could cause issues, but you'd happy by the end of it.  Overall an excellent example of a trippel. I've tasted darker and heavier, but this golden version masks it's alcohol perfectly and leaves an excellent aftertaste. Not a session beer, but perfect for a first review.

To start, you get nothing except for a blast of carbonation that lasts at least a second. But finally that evolves on your palate. First tastes are of orange and other citrus along with spices, noticeably cloves and cinnamon. Lots of yeasty and doughy flavors as well. A nice finish and aftertaste too.

22,34,johnmichael712,4.15,"Appearance: Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into a Chimay goblet. Freshness date on bottle is December 15, 2011. This beer pours an orangey-gold color that becomes quite murky once the yeast sediment is added to the glass. The high amount of carbonation in the bottle rapidly forms a large, pale white head that is supplemented by small, yet constant carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The head dissipates very rapidly, and doesn't really leave any lace on my glass, probably due to the high ABV (9%).  Smell: The nose of this beer definitely screams out ""Belgian"", and the clove-like yeast aroma makes its presence known. There is also a generous portion of fruity esters in the nose of this beer, and there are notes of bananas, orange peel, and pears.  Taste: La Fin Du Monde quickly announces itself as a crisp, refreshing beer, and it begins with a hearty amount of soft, yet crisp carbonation that helps showcase the sweet, malt backbone of this beer. This moves to a very spicy, clove taste that is well balanced with the banana flavored esters. The beer finishes with just a touch of hop bitterness along with hints of black pepper and alcohol, and these add the characteristic Belgian spiciness to the characteristic Belgian dry finish. For a Canadian company Unibroue has done a really good job of making La Fin Du Monde taste like it's from Belgium.  Mouthfeel: As is the trademark for the style, this beer is highly carbonated, but beneath that carbonation is a heavenly smooth, medium bodied Tripel. Once the yeast is added the body is a bit fuller than without, so definitely swirl the last few drops around in the bottle and add the yeast.  Drinkability: Even though the box says ""drink less, drink better"" I could definitely put back a couple pints of this brew. Incredibly crisp, smooth, and refreshing, this is one exceptionally drinkable beer.  Notes: I've heard this beer called the ""Canadian stand-in for Duvel"", and after just drinking Duvel a few nights ago I have to agree. While Duvel is a better beer across the board, this is still one very good beer. It isn't anything that will knock your socks off, but it's still a solid offering from Unibroue. Definitely something I'll buy again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Although it is 9% ABV, there is only the slightest hint of alcoholic taste. Very slight hop finish - very nice.  M - Light and creamy, highly carbonated.  D - Even with it's high ABV, incredible taste and incredible smoothness. Dangerous because you want to drink a lot of it but it will put you on your ass...

22,34,biboergosum,4.1,"650ml bottle. This was the first Unibroue offering that I tried back in university in the mid-90s when they first shipped it out West. It was quite the eye-opener to my Big Rock-loving self at the time. Now, at a nice little university area bistro, one neither at the End of the Universe, nor the end of the world, for that matter, I revisit it years hence.  This beer pours (into a properly branded chalice, no less) a hazy orangish yellow hue, with a few fingers of puffy, bubbly white head, which leaves some streaky soap film lace around the glass as it quickly beats in outta Oka (what, too soon?).  It smells of sharp grainy pale malt, earthy yeast, fruity dry apple and pear, cracked black pepper, spicy cloves, a slight minerality, and herbal, dead leafy hops. The taste is big, blended orchard fruit - apricot, pears, banana and orange - edgy yeast, peppery cloves, grainy pale malt, sugary honey, and mild floral hops. Only a slight tingling is detectable for the elevated ABV - neat.  The carbonation is noticeable, but mostly in a frothy sort of way, the body a sturdy medium weight, and a tad cloying in its sugary sweetness, but I've come to appreciate this as just a sad fact of the style. It finishes off-dry, the fruit and sugary malt lingering harder than the yeast and/or spice seem to be.  Homerism (hah - this is too much of a big-ass, geographically speaking, for now, country for that) aside, this is really a rather good example of the style, going down nice and smooth in spite of the big boy booze quotient. It's been their flagship beer since day one for a reason, and it's not hard to see why.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,PrinceDarren,4.22,"Single 12oz. bottle from Trader Joes. First of all, SCREW OFF bottle cap underneath the silver foil was a disappointment. I almost have to ding it a point for that.  Poured cold into a Duvel Tulip. 1-finger head seems about right. Dark orange hues.  Pleasant yeasty aroma with a hint of mint.  Tastes like a classic tripel. I pick up a little caramel with some cherry notes on the back of the tongue. A touch metallic like I just licked a flagpole. Spearmint finish.  The alcohol hits me fast. Reminds me that I shouldn't drink a 9% on an empty stomach.  Waiting for it to warm up...  My uncle used to race pigeons. I remember the smell of playing around the pigeon coop as a child. This kind of smells like pigeon poop.  At room temperature the metal starts to come through more and there is now a new bitterness on the finish.  This started off as a very drinkable tripel.

Bitter floral hops taste great in the beginning of the flavor profile. These give way to a little pepper, coriander, mild sweet malts, and finishes with some nice bittering hops.

22,34,MDekker,4.6,"A: Poured out of a 12oz bottle into an old, clean canning jar with a handle. My nicer goblet-like pieces of glassware just don't have the volume to cope with the head of a tripel, so it had to be the jar, which seemed preferable over a pint glass. Despite that, the head was overwhelming. I had to repour a couple times to get it all in. Eventually the head faded to just a coating on the top. It's a hazy light orange color. I'm a little disappointed in the chaos of the head, but it looks nice.  S: A combination of sour lemon and dry, straw and hay aromas. Yeasty too.  T: First impressions: booze and sugary, ripened fruit. Much more potent and rich than the color and smell indicated. For the highest rated tripel on BA I was initially disappointed, but things are improving now. Grainy elements too, and a subtle finish to balance the initial punch of flavor. Man, it keeps growing on me, and I'm going to give it a 5 here.  M: Very creamy and impressive. The seemingly abundant carbonation is actually quite good in terms of feel. A little bit oily.  D: Well, the richness of it will keep me from putting down multiples of these, but it keeps pulling me back as I drink it. A really fine brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Taste: Smooth and complex with hints of orange of lemon and spice. There is the light sweet flavor of malt combined with orange zest and clove but the operative word is ""subtle"" or ""integrated."" The alcohol is detectable but not harsh.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied with lots of smooth creamy carbonation. The finish is long and dry.  Drinkability: This beer outclasses most if not all of the competition and is on my ""return to again and again"" list. The drinkability is excellent.

You just want to shove this up your nose and smell it all day.  T- This beer is so delicious, talking about flavors almost seems ridiculous. This is an adult beverage in more ways than one. It is one of the few beers that tastes identical to its smell. Definitely an acquired taste (I would make another immature comment, but that would be in poor taste) as I didn't like it when I first went to Canada.  M- Lighter than you would expect, it is not syrupy, however this is no lightweight, gives you a full mouthfeel while you are drinking it, and has a novelty effect if you leave it on your tongue for a few seconds (feels like pop rocks on your tongue)  D- You will feel the 9%, but you won't taste it, or feel it in your stomach. If you want a legal high this is the way to go, drinking a pitcher of this at a hookah bar was stronger than anything else I have ingested in the last year.

However, the taste i where the beer went down hill. It tasted very much like Duvel, but a cheap, less appealing Duvel. It tasted like nuts, and I kept getting the taste of a cork.. strange. It's kind of bitter, but not too bad. You can definitely taste the citrus as well, but I can't get the cork out of my mind. Not very pleasing, not bad, but not good. Mouthfeel is fine and smooth. Drinkable? Eh yeah, for a while. It took me a while to finish the whole glass, but it went down. My bottle was obviously pretty old, so I'd like to try a fresh one and see how my opinion differs.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Kromes,4.29,"Pours a cloudy light orange with a head the died quickly. Had a yeasty spicy aroma like most belgians. And was highly carbonated. Taste was very good at first, lots of yeast spice coriander citrusy flavors that gave way to a strong alcohol finish. There was a slightly sour taste at the finish also. This one was just ok at first, but it gets way better the more you drink and your tastebuds get used to it. It packs quite a kick.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ballenc,3.57,"Given my love of Belgian-style beers and the high ratings, I was eager to try this brew.  Pour from a 750 ml bottle into an oversized wine glass.  A - Pours a clear, golden straw color with lots of effervescent bubbles. A thin yet rocky head that quickly dissipates leaving nothing - no lacing. However the strong head returns with a few quick swirls.  S - Mainly a bready yeast with some sweet candy malts. Hints of lemon and a bit of clove and spice. To me, this is the best part of the beer.  T - Based on the aroma of the beer, the taste was a bit disappointing. Mainly a bittersweet spiciness. Overall sour notes.  M: Another disappointment as it was much thinner than other tripels I've tried. Moderate carbonation.  D: Considering the high ABV and my high expectations of this brew, it is drinkable for this style. I will try other beers from Unibroue and see if their other styles hit the mark for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JohnQVegas,4.25,"Bottle into Chalice.  Pours a cloudy gold with a 1 finger, pillowy white head that dissipates fairly quickly.  Aroma is spicy yeast and ripe apricots and peaches.  Flavor starts out with a light candy sweetness, then hits big with overripe golden fruits (apricot, peach, pear) and a notable spiciness from both the yeast and (less so) from the alcohol. Finish is ripe fruits, yeast spice, alcohol, slightly astringent.  Carbonation is quite crisp at the beginning, providing an interesting dryness, but the beer still pulls off a creamy finish. Interesting flavor development in this beer - starts off light before exploding, matching the mouthfeel in development. An interesting take, excellent beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jonziefle,4.58,"Appearance: Poured a slightly cloudy golden amber. With an aggressive pour, a three finger white head, bubbly/foamy in composition. Visible carbonation. Good retention; the head really sticks around.  Smell: Complex nose with honey malts and Belgian yeast, with many different spices (cloves and ginger?). Also a good amount of citrus and even banana. Very well rounded.  Taste: The taste follows the smell very nicely. Spicy citrus notes are sweet and smooth, with a wheatlike character. The same spices, cloves and ginger, taste just as good as they smell. A little bit of hoppy bitteness at the end. The alcohol (9%) is well hidden and almost undectable.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium-bodied, very smooth and crisp. It has a creamy texture and slightly sticky, leaving behind as those wonderful spices. The carbonation makes it slightly filling though.  Drinkability: An excellent beer and a great example of the style. A sipper, definitely, but the most enjoyable kind. The complex interactions between the fruit flavors and the spices never get old. However, while the 9% alcohol is well hidden, it defintiely will sneak up on you.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,IMincedTheKing,3.39,"Pours a hazy golden brown with a thin head that recedes moderately fast. Lace is almost absent.  An earthy, cidery aroma jumps out of the glass. It's all apples and yeast, and I think it's too much.  The brew greets you with sweet apples, pears, and bananas, then finishes slightly bitter with malts and some alcohol. I don't want to knock it too much for this, but it's way tastes way too much like apple cider for me. It's syrupy and thick with a snappy carbonation, and the combination of the taste and the mouthfeel are not quite cloying.  I couldn't drink too many both because it's filling and the cider flavor is definitely not to my taste--I can see why this is so highly rated, though, so I would recommend giving it a shot.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

T 5.0 - Tastes follow smell, on wheat like malt base. Mild but sweet and clove-y. Clove is very present in taste. This tripel is a fine example at the Belgian skill to stealth the 9% ABV!

22,34,callmescraps,4.05,"It's been awhile, so it's time to revisit this well regarded tripel.  Appearance - A light orangish-gold color. A little head that quickly gets out of the way. However, a nice ring hangs around. It's a good looking beer. A little cloudy. It's nice, but not spectacular. The Levud's I had last night seemed to glow, and for some reason this one just doesn't quite do that.  Smell - It definitely has that tart green apple smell. With some sweet candy as well. Also, a hint of citrus, and some spice. Definitely some yeast as well. I'd describe it as a spiced apple bread. If that makes any sense. It's pleasant, but perhaps a little subtle.  Taste - Definitely tart apples. It also warms as it goes down, nicely. You can taste the yeast as well, but not as much spice as I might prefer. It's a nice taste, but maybe not as complex as I might want. It's good though.  Mouthfeel - Really excellent. It has some excellent carbonation that I just love. Very crisp on the tongue. Just awesome.  Drinkability - For a pretty big beer, the booze is well hidden. However, the carbonation makes a little gassy. Too many of these and I'd feel downright bloated.  This is a very good beer. Not as complex as some tripels, but very well done overall. It's nice and crisp, and certainly sweet, but I was hoping for some funkiness to go with it all.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Aroma is of citrus and tart green apples. Malt and yeast with a zing of sourness.  Flavor is of tart citrus and dusty yeast. Malt is thick and substantial with a huge bready flavor. Finishes clean and slightly sweet but not overly so, Spicy alcohol is warming and barely noticeable.  Mouthfeel is thick syrupy and chewy. Carbonation is barely noticeable as the brew is so viscous.

Aroma: Sweet, boozy, fruity (pear/citrus?) aroma.  Taste: Sweet but in a good way. The citrus and pear from the nose are apparent as well. Very light spice character as well. Dry, bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Light, crisp carbonation; gets creamier almost as the ale warms up.  Notes: Another fantastic ale of notable strength that hides its ABV very well.

The taste follows suit with these same flavors; a wonderful, full, complex flavor. This is not overwhelming at all like tripels can be, even in spite of the ABV. The mouthfeel is equally pleasant--light, bubbly, and carbonated--and the alcohol is nowhere to be found. I found La Fin Du Monde akin to Brooklyn Local 1, perhaps a touch better, and I think this will be my tripel of choice for a while.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,rhinos00,4.43,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass.  A- Pours a golden, semi-hazy yellow. Produces a nice three fingers width of white, fluffy head. Great retention.  S- A few swirls reveal a nice scent of subtle, sweet honey and various spices. Also getting a wheat aroma that provides the base for the scent.  T- Fantastic! Upfront cloves and spices play off each other to create a solid taste. As the beer progresses, the wheat and honey complexions become more pronounced and give the beer a sweet, but refined finish.  M- Light to medium bodied. Tons of carbonation, almost too much. The mouthfeel was perfect, except for the fact that there was so much carbonation that on the initial taste for each sip all you received was the feeling of millions of carbonated bubbles bursting. While it was short lived, it hindered the initial ability to taste the flavor.  D- These beer is hilariously drinkable. 9% abv is a joke as it is virtually undetectable in this beer.  Just a wonderfully made beer. Great taste, highly drinkable, not much more you can ask for. This is one that will always be in my house.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Citrusy, acidic fruits with a good amount of yeast and spices, especially pepper. There's the inkling of hops at the end.  M: Nice and smooth, with just the right amount of kick.  D: Very drinkable.

22,34,dismal,4.32,"Poured into a pint glass from a bottle it poured a light, hazy, honey, golden color and produces a nice huge fluffy head. The smell is spicy and yeasty. I think the spices come out more in the smell than anything else. The taste is slightly bitter, fruity, and sweet. The spices also come through on the taste and all that combined makes this beer taste very good. The mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and not thin at all. With a 9% ABV this beer is really drinkable. After a few I'm sure I would feel it but I wouldn't have problem drinking them. I haven't had many Tripels before and the ones before weren't bad but this beer makes me want to try more of the style and of course more from Unibroue as this is another fine beer from them.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Vixie,4.8,"A- Was a cloudy yellow, but looked more orange when not held up to the light. Not much head, mainly some nice lacing.  S- Fruit was the first thing I noticed, more a citrus type of fruit. Then hit me with more spices, mainly pepper and coriander.  T- The flavor to me was like a spiced fruit. Start with citrus like fruit notes, then the spices kick in. A very peppery beer, which actually balances the fruitiness nicely.  M- Not a thick beer by any stretch, but the carbonation really helps give this beer some presence. Not much aftertaste here, left me with a clean feeling.  D- Very drinkable considering the alcohol content. I call this a sneaky beer, it is so smooth and so little hint of the alcohol content that it can really hit you when you least expect it. For a high alcohol beer, very drinkable. Yet another winner from Unibroue.  After having more of this, I have upped my rating of this one. One of my 1 or 2 favorite beers.

22,34,dotsonjamesg,4.21,"I bought his brew on Little Rock AFB at the Shoppette. Someone here lately has requested more exotic and specialty beer and I am eternally grateful for it, as the selection of specialty beer in Arkansas is TERRIBLE! Good beer to the locals is ""Bud Light Lime"" and ""Natty Ice."" I am new to the region and am originally from California, which is a ""beer mecca,"" so you can see the dilemma of ignorance I deal with here concerning beer.  I have had this brew several times in the past but have never reviewed it.  Served in a chilled 12 oz Chimay goblet, poured from a 12 oz bottle.  Appearance: Pours a beautiful, rich, golden color. The brew is cloudy and unfiltered, just as any good beer should be. My pour left a thick, two finger head with good retention and moderate lacing.  Smell: Scent is sweet and earthy with a strong presence of malty citrus notes. Pear and candied fruit come to mind; its pretty lovely.  Taste: Strong, carbonated, spicy, malty sweetness initially then it moves in to a more mellow, bitter alcoholic flavor. I can pickup sugar, spices, orange, and maybe some other citrus. Not a whole lot of complexity but its tasty. The alcohol is pretty well hidden with the sweetness of the brew. The flavor isn't as strong as I had hoped for, for a Tripel. I think its comparable to a strong ""Spring Ale.""  Mouthfeel: Thick and smooth. The carbonation is pretty nice and pairs well with this lovely brew quite well.  Drinkability: Overall, it's a good brew but I think it could have been a bit bolder in flavor. The alcohol makes it worth the effort and money. I would highly recommend this brew to anyone looking to expand their palate but I would like to point out that there is some better stuff out there.  Godspeed and cheers!  -Dotson",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,FtownThrowDown,3.58,"Another solid offering from Unibroue. Pours a murky, cloudy light gold in color. Two fingers of head forms on the pour. Smell is highly yeasty, with some spice and a decent amount of lemon. Taste has actually quite a bit of yeast to it. There is more of the fruity overtones, with more than just the lemon flavor showing up. Decent mouthfeel and highly carbonated. Decent, but it's not ""The Don"".",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The large white is impressive at first but it quickly fades to almost nothing.  S - Spicy with clove, vanilla and pepper.  T - Spicy with lots of clove and a touch of pepper. A nice bitter hoppiness too. Fairly dry. I'd never guess this one was 9%. It drinks more like 6-7%. I'm not a big fan of spiced beers but this one is very nice.  M - Lots of carbonation and a substantial consistency.  D - A very smooth and complex beer. Not my favorite style but undeniably good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,fightingirishcmk,4.12,"A: Pours a golden color with an immense head, which had rather long retention, but left little lacing on the glass. The ABV may have something to do with this. They should decrease slightly the amount of carbonation, seeing as when you pour it, you have to stop halfway through the bottle because of the head. This puts more yeast into solution and tends to cloud the beer. S: Spicy, fruit, especially lemon, and a sweet smell of malt. T: Banana, citrus, spiciness, coriander, and somewhat sour. Very little bitterness. Well layered distinct yet appropriate flavors. M: A bit sticky and a bit thinner on body than I would like, but overall fairly good with carbonation. D: For 9% abv, it is deceptively drinkable. For the price, it is hard to beat. IMO it is a very decent brew. I'd have to say drinkability is where this brew succeeds the most.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,washburnkid,4.26,"Served in a tulip.  A: A massive off-white head almost explodes out of the tulip. Body is a cloudy golden, amber and orange with floating yeast particles. Head retains like creamy foam and sticks around for 2+ hours (yes, I've been sipping on the beer for that long). S: Dark spices on the nose; sweet malty backdrop that's very faint and a slight fruitiness slips through. T: Very spicy dominance on the palate at first. Wheat flavors similar to Maudite, but not as present. Wonderful balance of malts and hops, which hides the 9% alcohol and the excess of bitterness defined by tripels. Sip ends in a bitter-to-sweet-and-back-to-bitter exhange, similar to a bitter piece of fruit. M: Light to medium bodied with generous carbonation, which helps to pull the spices through. Creamy mouthfeel, leaving the palate coated in spices. D: This is definitely a sipper. ABV sneaks up at the end, but it's all worth it.

The taste is out of this world, lightly fruity, slight bit of hops, crisp malt is so well balanced.

I have to comment on the insane carbonation, it looks like a fountain coming off of the etching in my Sam Adams Sensory glass.  Smells of bread. Some citrus character but not hoppy citrus, more like orange peel? Very clovey.  Tastes very spicy, pretty dry on the finish. Orange ester is present again.  Mouth is extremely high carbonated, so much so that I had difficulty detecting the body, which is somewhere in the middle by the way.

Cracks open with a nice hiss, pouring a rich golden hue with two fingers of white foam that fades quickly to a thick ring that holds on to the surface but not to the glass, leaving behind no lacing.  Very citrusy and fruity in the nose, with distinctive notes of apricot and a bit of tangerine, with some vague peppery spice notes interspersed within.  Bright and lively on the tongue, with a tingly carbonation that cleanses the palate, leading the way for bitter lemon peel and orange zest, combined with spicy notes of cracked pepper and faint hints of clove, all laid over a base of smooth, almost buttery, slightly sweet malt flavor that fades away into a very dry, spicy finish that calls for yet another swallow.  Extremely drinkable, but quite deceiving, hiding its hefty 9% ABV superbly.

Smooth complexity makes this brew a standout. 9% ABV is so well hidden that this is deceptively devilish. Very, very well made.  M - Smooth and silky. Nicely carbonated. This beer just swims on the tounge.  D - Would it not be for the 9% ABV, this beer would be an all night drinker.

22,34,TheycallmeTim,4.37,"Poured from a 750 ml. bottle into a hennepin flute.  A--Pours up a little bit hazy (oops) tawny orange with lots and lots--two, two and a half fingers--of white champagne microbubbles. Excellent soapy lacing and retention.  S--Cross between cinnamon and clove, with a backdrop spicewise of pepper and nutmeg. Somehow not christmasy, though--maybe that's because of the fruit on the nose: lots of peach and a little apricot.  T--Plenty more spice up front and in the very back--more of that elusive cinnamon and clove mix, which makes it, what? Allspice? Somewhere in the mulled wine cheesecloth. Sweet juicy biscuit center with a slightly chalky pale malt tug. More apricot and even some pear pull through in the middle of the profile. Excellent balance and complexity.  M&D--Mouthfeel is soft given how full the taste is. Champagne carbonation keeps it light and lively, which brings out the fruitiness of it and doesn't let the spice overwhelm. Drinkability is high in the sense that I'd definitely drink this again, but low in the sense that at 9% you're not gonna pound two or three wine bottles of it. Definitely felt this even after giving a 1/3 away to my girlfriend.  Restraint is the word I'd apply to this beer, which leads to sick balance. Fantastic mix of bright, lively fruitiness with a sock of malt and yeast.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,showell,4.5,"Wow! At first I wasn't quite sure what to think. It pours an orange/amber with about an inch head. You can smell the cloves as soon as you pour it. Then you can smell a peppery fruit. That was what caught me sort of off guard, but as soon as you taste it you know it all just works. The cloves are there above it all, wtih a fruit flavor following, followed by just a hint of hops. The aftertaste is alcohol and just a touch bitter. At 9% I couldn't drink more than one of these 750 ml bottles, but it would surely make me want to try. Thought the cork was nifty too.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

A: Poured a beautiful 2 finger head that recedes somewhat slowly as I drink this beer.  S: Normally I don't smell it, but this particular bottle smelled a LOT of bubble gum and in a good way. It also had some aromas of apple, pear, and only very slightly phenolic. The beer smelled absolutely wonderful. Maybe the best I've ever smelled.  T: One of my favorite beers in the world as far as taste goes. It was going down smooth without any alcohol burn. Taste of mildly sour pears and other fruits this beer is delicious. It also has some pepperiness to it which I just love. It balances out some of the sweetness which is great.  M: My only real knock on La Fin Du Monde is the overcarbonation. I would rather have a beer that is over carbonated as opposed to under carbonated though so it is only a small deduction in points. If this beer was slightly less carbonated it might be the best beer there is.  D: Off the charts on the drinkability. Budweiser could learn a thing or two about drinkability from this brew. At 9% alcohol I almost can't believe how easy it is to down this beer. While I only had one this past weekend (among other selections) I could easily have 3-4 of these in one night and enjoy every single one.  Overall this is one of my favorite beers, and in the style of Tripel I can't think of a better one. I can think of others which come close to matching it, but when one considers the price ($9.99 for a 4-pack) there is nothing out there that matches it. The other beers which come close are all $10 for a 750ml so for twice the amount of beer I'll almost always turn to La Fin du Monde. Who also doesn't like a beer that translates to ""The End of the World""? Also this beer is easily the best I have had among the Unibroue offerings.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,brc,4.5,"Poured from 33cl bottle into goblet. White head doesn't stay around long, but leaves some lacing.  Smells overwhelmingly of allspice. There's some cloves, yeastiness, alcohol, black pepper and apricots, but allspice is king.  Taste is pretty laid back for a triple, but well balanced with great layering of flavors. The banana/clove business is very subtle, which is quite nice for a change. Plenty of spiciness from the hops. The sweetness reminds me of stone fruits, mostly apricot with a hint of plum. The allspice flavor is definitely there, but not as overwhelming as in the aroma.  Mouthfeel is pleasantly full. The warming finish is lovely.  Dangerously drinkable. Amazing brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,irishtjb11,4.37,"read alot about this picked one up, split it with some friends. really dug the map of north america/quebec on the label; as well as the cork.  appearance is a real nice unfiltered, golden color. fluffy white head, forms a snowtop on the beer. head doesnt do too much lacing, but doesn't go anywhere during the drink.  the smell and taste are super complex, but super enjoyable. smell has lots of fruity esters, especially apple, followed by lots of spices. not too much malt or hop present, but im assuming thats unique to this style. also lots of sweet hues, from honeys and sweet malts or light malts. the taste explodes on the palate, lots of carbonation and sweetness at first. a real sweet fruity, spicy taste, cant really detect too much bitterness, once again nice sweet honeys and sweet notes on the mouth. lots of warmth from the alcohol.  mouthfeel has a lot of carbonation, but its not stingy like some of the more over carbonated beers. it just presents a real nice bubble and pop to it. the head is a nice addition to, really frothy and enjoyable.  great beer, very new to tripels but enjoyed this. certainly not my favorite style, but for someone who really digs it, this seems to be near the top.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,KBoudreau66,4.5,"Pours carbonated with a cloudy light orange color and a yellow tint. It pours two fingers of frothy white head that dissipates to a thin layer.  Smells of sweet malts, fruity apples, spicy yeast and wheat bread.  Tastes great. Carbonated, with a tangy fruit flavor. The apple flavor that I smelled stands out significantly, but there are hints of banana, alcohol, and wheat.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonated. The carbonation isn't rough though, it is actually very pleasant, and nice to sip on. At first I thought I was going to suck this brew down, but it ended up taking me a lot longer then I expected.  This is an excellent triple by Unibroue. As I was drinking this I kept having flashbacks of a Weihenstephaner Hefe, but this brew is definitely different, more complex fruit flavors. Well balanced. Nice brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S - A whirlwind of complexity created by aromas of apple, white grape, clove, citrus, coriander, and a kiss of floral hops. Simply beautiful!  T - Tart green apple flavors dominate up front, complimented by citrus and spices. A touch of hop bitterness comes through in the finish, balanced with some sweet flavors of light fruit and additional spice.  M - Full-bodied and smooth, yet finishes crisp and clean thanks to an ample amount of carbonation. An earthy feel also present thanks to the yeast.  D - Hands-down my favorite Tripel. I have a lot of respect for Unibroue, and this beer is one of my primary reasons for it. It's simply fantastic. It's enjoyable, smooth, and very easy to drink.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Then comes the yeast, and it finishes dry with a hint of alcohol but not as much as you would expect from a 9% beer.  M- Very lively. The carbonation is present and you want to sit and savor it.  D- I nurse the bottle slowly. This isn't a beer you can drink quickly but should sip and savor. Surprisingly the alcohol isn't overwhelming but very subtle",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Corriander and hints of clove. Very inviting belgian yeast profile. Slight presence of phenols. Light barnyard funk. This is the nose of an excellent Belgian Tripel.  Sweet fruitiness opens this one. Apples, bananas and citrus flavors. This is quickly balanced by a nice smooth spiciness. Light pepper and cloves. Nice medium malt profile. Great belgian yeast presence. Very nicely balanced.  As a Tripel should be, this is one smooth and creamy brew. Highly carbonated, with lots of tiny little bubbles. It feels so good in your mouth, you almost don't want to swallow it. Just let it sit there, for a while, and enjoy it.  Very tasty, smooth, and quite drinkable. It hides the 9%abv so well. I can't even tell that it's there.

22,34,JerzDevl2000,4.13,"Yet another beer that I picked up in Totowa. This one has to be one of the most reviewed brews on this site, so I was a bit surprised that I haven't heard about this more in a word-of-mouth fashion. Seeing that I haven't had a Canadian Beer since Labatt Crystal, I figured it was time to up the ante a bit. Thankfully, this beer is more than up for the challenge!  Great pour, no doubt about it. The head nearly overflowed my pint glass and the lacing isn't half bad either. As for the hue - it's golden with lots of swirly cloudiness to it. Just what I want to see in a Belgian style! Then there's the taste. Certainly not amazing or overwhemling, but if I had this beer blindfolded, there's no way I'd guess that this was Canadian. Lots of banana, clove, bubble gum, and straw here, with a good alcoholic presence to tie it all together. It's not crystalline, but there's a sense of sweetness here too. Certainly one of the most aggressive opaque beers I've ever had, and with just a hint of sourness in the back to boot...  I normally don't like my beers this strong, but it all works here. The 9.00% ABV is not to be taken lightly, since it will be felt from the first sip to the last drop. This is a good beer for this time of the year, when you're sick of stouts and darker offerings but still need to be warmed up because spring is taking it's time to arrive! All the praise this beer gets is certainly deserved.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S - there is no way around it, but this beer defintely earns a perfect score here. right up front there is a bouquet of fresh cut apples, and mulling spices, there is a light touch of clover the the back. smells like a carbonated mulled cider to equate it to something else.  T - a fine tripel indeed. a nice sweet malty flavour hits the palate. the sweetness is complemented by an almost wheat like grain taste with some sweetness, fruity notes in the far back. the finish illuminates the alcohol and some spiciness from hops. the aftertaste is at first lingering with alcohol and then the malts set back in and give it a nice sweet finish.  MF&D - the feel is great, a creamy body that is not too thick with a large amount of carbonation. I could drink this into oblivion, which wouldn't be too hard.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,czechsaaz,4.62,"Big malt nose of pilsner and a spicy yeast component. There's a little fruity ester involved too. I get some peach and apricot aroma. As it warms up it seems even more malty.  Golden colored and very clear. Pours with a big-ass head (careful not to overpour) that fades to a nice layer with tons of lacing but some pretty big bubbles in the head and rising from the bottom of the glass.  Sweet base malt flavors of pilsner and some honey malt. Good hop bitterness to dry it out. Fermentation characteristics include fuit (apples and peaches), spice (pepper, coriander) and yeast. All the fermentation blends together and is subtle so it doesn't seem like anything is added, just a byproduct of the yeast.  Medium to light body with very lively carbonation. Hides the 9% very well. Drinks like a standard pilsner-type beer with way more flavor.  Hard to believe I've never reviewed this beer. It's one of my go-to beers. While not as complex as say a Westmalle or a Bernardus tripel, I can't walk into an average grocery store and pick up a better tripel.

A soft fizzy white head with good retention and lacing through the entire tasting.  The nose has some nice estery and phenolic notes throughout. The malt is a bit hidden but some Belgain malt and some pilsner notes. A noticeable oxidation aroma but is somewhat hidden with everything going on. Some nice fruity aromas that is more like a stone fruit than anything, peaches, nectarines and hints of oranges. Some stale notes mixes with a peppery and medicinal aroma. Some noticeable alcohol and sugary notes on the back end.  The taste is bit better than the smell. The malt has some complexity to it and balances well with the esters/phenolic/yeast notes. Some sugary flavors with some pils and generic malt flavors. Some hints of Belgian malt notes and hints of biscuit. Would liked more of that but good complexity overall. The esters come out in their own right with more of a orangey nectarine thing with some minor peach, apricot and vanilla on the back end. Some white wine grape notes that don't quite fit with the noticeable solvent/alcohol notes. Noticeable white pepper leaves a bit of an astringent note. Yeast is distinct to Unibrou but blends well.  The body is moderate and a bit sweet for style. Carbonation is high even for style with a bit of carbonic bite. Some warming effects on the back end. To me, this is more of a Belgian golden than tripple. Just a lot going on to more along the lines of a tripple. Some off notes in the nose and taste but some complexity and esters are worth trying.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Birchgrove77,3.99,"Foil-top bottle received as a birthday gift back in September '08.  Appearance: Beautiful golden, wheat-like yellow in color with an unbelieveably gorgeous fluffy, white head that laces down the glass as you drink. Wonderful streams of carbonation rise to the surface.  Smell: Didn't really care for the smell. Mostly the aroma was musty with some sprinkling of citrus. I guess I would liken it to the smell of regular oatmeal.  Taste: Truly remarkable. Lemony with the perfect balance of cloves and a peppery quality. Some sweetness exists, but the flavor is balanced perfectly.  Mouthfeel: The best way to put it is this beer's carbonation dances on your tounge. Somehow the alcohol is hidden and the mouthfeel reminds me more of a Witbier than a 9% tripel.  Drinkability: Could easily drink a few of these sitting down and not be able to stand up.

S- This triple has a huge fruit aroma incuding oranges and banana and other tropical smells. A nice spice factor including clove and some barley+wheat. Some hops make an appearance as well as malt sweetness after 10 minutes or so.  T- This one packs a lot of tropical tastes such as the orange peel,lemon and melted banana. Other fruits not present in smell include pineapple pear and apple. Spices such as clove & pepper with some barley action. A bit of a hop bite in the middle as some malts smooth things out with sugars lingering.  M- This 9%er goes down smooth with some tartness from some aging. The fruit essence is the 1st thing that hits the palette but then is backed by a exellent balance of spices malts and hops.Medium bodied while the Carbonation is lively with the alcohol making a cameo.

S: Spices and banana yeast. I want to call it sweet but that is not quite right- it is more of a freeze dried fruit flavor with barrels of complexity. This is intense and quite the surprise. Little citrus dishwasher detergent punch.  T: That is it, that is what a well made tripel should taste like in every aspect. Banana, yeast, cookie dough, mothball like cotton candy, and some other fruits. Clovey spice and coriander are dominant. If there were someone that wanted to get into bigger beers and like the direction that Hoegaarden leads them to, get them to try this.  M: Chewy and creamy. Volumes of bubbles that add a lot to feel as does all of the spice varietals. Crisp at the end and drying on the tongue.  D: For the style, the abv, and the content, insanely drinkable. It is like chewing on a blow pop when it is done and the flavors lend so much value to each sip. Next time I see this ugly bottle, I will be picking it up. Delicous and smooth as silk.

Banana and pepper up front, strong Belgian yeast, sweet clove, and finishes with a moderate alcohol presence.  Mouthfeel is somewhere between medium and heavy. Very smooth and easy to drink.

S: I'm hit instantly with spices and some estery notes. Pepper, light fruits, and loads of alcohol await.  T: Woah! Spicy, malty, mildly sweet and delicious. How is this NOT from Belgium!? This stuff is off the wall good for a Canadian brew. Some nutty character, light fruits, a bit of clove and a mild, almost chile-pepper like bite on the tongue. Do I taste pears, and maybe even a little golden raisin??  M: Creamy, thick, and wonderful. When it was poured it seemed to hint towards a more watery beer considering how bubbly it appeared... Not the case, at all. Mouth warming, bubbly, spicy and creamy as all get out.  D: As drinkable as a beer with this high of an alcohol content is ever going to get. This brew was oh so creamy and thick, yet not harsh on the palate at all. Goes down smooth.

Because I feel that every time I buy a new Tripel to try, it just keeps getting better. No offense to Victory. Anyways, before trying this brew, I must say Brooklyn Local 1 was so far the best I have tried. The aroma of this beer is typical of this style. Nothing mind blowing or exciting. Smells, in my opinion, the same as every other beer of this style... yeast and fruit. I took nice sniff before I tried it to see if I could anticipate the taste. Well at first, I thought I was right. Right after I swallowed, I realized I was dead wrong. I was pleasantly surprised by the spicy clove after taste; something I have yet to experience in this type of beer. It has a very sweet and spicy flavor. Yeast is obviously present as well as alcohol as this is a 9% ABV brew. Because of the sweetness of this beer, I don't think its as drinkable as maybe the Brooklyn Local 1. I don't know what else to say about this really... It is an amazing Tripel for lack of better words. If you like this style, definitely try this one. Its not very expensive...

Big whiffs of tropical fruit begin, with mango, papaya, pineapple, a bit of must and nectar in there as well.Taste is very fruity, with the fruits mentioned above included, but then there is a spicy character that comes in, followed by a solvent alcohol taste that can best be compared to vodka. Body is medium, slick on the mouth and pretty hot I have to say. I am glad I opted for the single instead of an entire bottle, as this one was really hard for me to finish. I know this one gets a lot of praise, bit what can I say? I am not a huge fan of Tripels, and am definitely not a fan of Tripels that remind me of my least favorite spirit, vodka. Worth a try for Belgian fans. Cheers",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,beeronesse,4.97,"I have to agree with the Brothers on this triple. It's world class.  I had it first on tap and then out of a caged & corked bottle. Both experiences were too close to note any, if tiny difference.  Beautifully cloudy, golden-orange in color, with a dense and creamy head that lasts well.  Spicy, banana/bubble gum right off the nose and into the mouth...a slight and not unpleasant medicinal note...definite pepper and licorice as well as some pome fruit and soft citrus. This one drinks well at any temp and I like to take my time and sip, sip, sip.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JayNH,4.3,"A- Pours a hazy golden color with a small foamy head.  S- sweet, slightly spicy, very fruity. Apples, pears, oranges....  T- spicy sweet, peppery and fruity. Notes of grapes and pears. Finishes a bit clovey and yeasty. An alcohol warmth encompasses the flavor.  M- Moderate carbonation and body. On the dry side.  D- Excellent. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden. It's there, but it blends in very well with what's going on in the beer. Overall a fantastic brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TStandley13,3.78,"enjoyed from a westmalle glass....  A- toasty golden color with some sediment leaving it slighty un-seethrough. Head was thick but bleach white, however it dissipated quickly and didn't leave too much lacing (might have been the glass)  S- Smelt like I raided the fruit basket. Definite Granny Smith Apple smell, slightly sour at first but spicy throughout the remainder. Reminded me of apple pie slightly with the addition of the cinnamon and brown sugar smells.  T- exactly what my nose smelt.  M- smooth and crisp like an autumns day, definetely detected the alcohol.  D- middle of the road. I think they overdid the spicing and I felt more like I was eating a pie than drinking a beer (though is that a bad thing all the time?)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Jablonski,4.37,"Poured into a Chimay glass.  A: Pours a golden orange that has a medium sized head with minimal lacing.  S: Largely has a funky smell combined with bananas and apples; also has a light citrus hint.  T: Bubblegum and banana jump out initially in this flavor with an orange/apple aftertaste. Alcohol is noticeable, but very light. The beer also gives off a nice warming sensation.  M: Perfect mouthfeel; not too thick or thin.  D: 9% is strong, but this beer is still surprisingly drinkable; not too heavy either.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,dakid618,4.15,Poured into chalice from 750 mL bottle. Pours a hazy golden color with a half finger of head. Very sweet smell like cane sugar and syrup. Taste is kind of wheaty and sweet. Very strong and sweet flavor that masks the ABV very well. Light coating mouthfeel. Drinkability is only lost on the full flavor and sweetness of an otherwise top notch tripel.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,pants678,3.76,"Finally got around to this after many recommendations, but sadly it wasn't much to my liking. It's gold in color, strong head, smells nice, but far too hoppy & carbonated for my tastes. Still, easy going and smooth, considering. It does have a nice sour taste, if savored. But not really my style, in the end.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TequilaSauer,4.42,"Medium body, lots of head retention, light gold in color.  Smells soapy, citrusy and sweet.  Attacks hard with lots of fruit. Finishes with a nice vegetal touch.

I can really feel the carbonation.  Drinkability: I will have this again, but not for a while. I have other favorite from Unibroue. The alcohol content on this one is sneaky, so I do not think I would have more than two in a session.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,a4ester,4.32,"My son first had this beer on his honeymoon in Canada. Now I know why it is one of his faves. Very enjoyable beer. Lately I have been focusing more on the Imperial Stouts and found this to be a refreshing change of pace.  Appearance - Pours a light golden color with a about a one finger head, which eventually recedes, leaving a bit of lacing. The carbonation is fairly active.  Smell - A combination of sweet citrus and fruit.  Taste - Enjoyable sweet, spicy flavors very similar to cidar. Just a hint of alcohol.  Mouthfeel - A nice smooth beer that with fairly good carbonation.  Drinkability - This is where we could get in trouble. Repeated consumption would not be a problem at all!! A very easy to drink beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,FatCaster,4.68,"A--No exaggeration: looks exactly like fresh pressed apple cider.  S--Citrus and sweetness, with a bit of malty goodness.  T--Sweet and savory with the taste of apple and finishes to some citrus. Light burn of alky adds a bit of warmth.  M--Effervescent and bubbly, but still thick and substantial.  D--Dangerous, very dangerous. So easy to drink and quite potent. Consuming a whole bottle would be inadvisable if you wanted to stay....sharp.  Very good, lives up to its reputation.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,WalrusJockey,4.3,"12oz bottle, poured into Duvel glass.  Appearance- slightly cloudy golden-straw color, with a near-white head.  Smell- apples, apples, and more apples. Oranges and spices are also very clear in the nose, along with a distinctive yeast-funk which smells a bit like a wet barnyard.  Taste- oranges and apples splash onto the palate, followed by a warming sensation as the cloves, cinnamon and other spice flavors march in. The swallow is yeasty, into more fruit, into a quick dash of spice, with a bready yeast aftertaste.  Mouthfeel- light and crisp, aided by ample carbonation. Crisp on the palate, leaving the mouth so smoothly and so clean it is hard to resist another drink.  Drinkability- high. La Fin Du Monde would be an easy pick for a session beer. Except for the fact that sessioning a 9% would knock most of us right on or asses.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Chelsea1905,4.02,"Pours a slight tangerine orange and straw yellow. The head is nice and bubbly but fades very quickly with a little lacing.  Smells like Wheat and European hops, a little yeast in there too. There is some fruit in there too, but you have to take a good whiff to get it  The taste is of wheat, a bit of malt, and a little fruit flavour in there too  Almost feels like drinking Champagne, medium mouthful otherwise.  Easy to drink, but not somethinf I'd be trying every night",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,theBubba,4.42,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a wine glass, this ale produced a good head, though not long lasting. Color was a cloudy straw-like yellow amber. Lace was minimal but stuck around 'til the end. Smell was predominantly clove, with a hint of banana and maybe a touch of pear. Good carbonation and maltiness made for a really nice mouth feel. This is my second foray into Quebecs Unibroue. This one beats 3 Pistols, without a doubt.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,rlparker3,4.4,"6-Jan-2009 Home  Poured a hazy gold with a think head. Aroma of bread, and sweet, syrupy pineapple. Initial flavors are sweet bread and alcohol followed closely spices and honey.

22,34,OtherShoe2,4.12,"Pours a hazy orange with a rocky thick head -- some lace, but not alot.  Smells of sweet fermented stone fruit, some spice, citrus, and a big whiff of alcohol.  Good alcohol punch on this one, with the sweet tropical fruit flavors, some yeastiness, and maltiness. Has a tart/sour note as well. Fairly clean finish.  Well carbonated and medium bodied, keeps this as drinkable as possible. This is a long-time sipper -- an one a night is enough for me. Good example of this style. Worth a try, more than once.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Stimack,4.54,"I may have been a little to easy with the pour as the brew did not have a very large head but what was there was a light white color with nice retention. The brew has a nice cloudy dull yellow color to it with a slight tinge of orange. Some lacing down the side but think it could be more with a slightly more vigorous pour. The aroma is very pleasing, with a good Belgium smells, citrus, pear, maybe slight apple cider like, spicy yeast with slightly sweet malt. This is a very inviting brew, with it weighing in at 9 % I am not picking up and hot like aromas. The flavors don't seem as complex as the aroma, but they are damn good. one the first sip the malt is the first thing to come out for me, sweetness, which then breaks to a mild spiciness that lingers at the back of the mouth. From the second sip on other flavors come out. Clove and peppers seem to add more to the spiciness that I initially picked up. Hops seem to add to the spiciness that also seems to tickle the back of the mouth and tongue. Alcohol is a little more present here and comes out more as this brew warms, but that flavor is very good as it still seems muted and is not in anyway over powering the brew. This is another brew which I have just walked by for years. I knew of the reputation of being a great brew but for some reason I passed, well I think my feelings have clearly changed. This beer is fantastic, drinks easy which is scary for a 9% brew. Each sip leaves you wanting more.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,PBoegel,4,"12 oz bottle best by 2011 on label.  Pours near crystal clear with a soft white head, expected more of a sustaining head with the co2 pop on opening. The head broke fairly quickly.  Aromas of ripe banana, raisin, cranberries and white pepper. Some hints of alcohol but well hidden and nowhere near fusel.  Flavors that dominate are banana and sour cherry along with yeasty peppery profile, body is fairly light and carbonation is a little more subdued than I would like for style.  Very good drinker, lots of similarity to Ommegang's Hennepin fairly fresh batch as far as I can tell.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,farrago,4.5,"Pours with a very fine one finger head, quick to dissipate, very cloudy orange-yellow color, not gonna see through this, does hold the light for a soft glow. Closely knit nose of pressed lemon and tangerine peels, oats and yeast, light clove, dried flowers, not that expressive but the right parts come through. Medium-bodied with an outwardly expansive mouth feel, could seem hollow if you're looking for thick body. Carbonation level is above average and churns things up some. The lemon, tangerine citrus as well as clove, coriander, cumin spice remains a primary focus. Pine tar, floral sap come in too. Have to say that the yeast and hops seem more alive in the mouth than the malts. Lots of retronasal action after you swallow.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mothman,4.15,"Best before date not printed onto bottle. Poured into New Belgium Globe glass.  Pours an amazing fluffy head. The color is hazy light orange. Best descriped as apple cider. Few particles float around beer.  Smell is very fruity, a strong banana aroma with some citrus notes as well. Tastes is pretty much the same. The citrus makes its presence and the alcohol also makes its way out.  Mouthfeel is very full. It is crisp, yet extremely creamy. This beer is highly carbonated and needs be drank slowly. Leaves a some what sticky aftertaste.  Overall, this is a solid beer! I really enjoyed the full body flavor of this triple. I have another in the fridge, but that one will be gone soon!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bgjohnston,4.4,"I have revisited this beer many times since I first discovered it while living in Boston about 10 years ago. It has consistently been an enjoyable beer.  Most recently I had this beer out of a 750ml bottle into a pint glass. It is a nice amber color with a lot of carbonation and a clean, white head. Smells fruity.  The taste has a bit of citrus, and the flavor overall hides the alcohol content in such a way that I find it deceptively easy to drink. A good value for the money, too.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,pdxwhisky,4.55,"From a 4-pack of Unibroue 750ml's via Costco.  Great appearance, golden amber with lots of carbonation. Great head and foam retention, settling down to a thin lacing after the second sip. Classic triple aroma, malty, a bit sour, and lots of floral, with a hint of banana. Gentle malt flavor to start, alcohol very well hidden by carbonation and balance of flavor, hops present, but also well balanced. Very effervescent, almost champagne-like. Lots of sugary aftertaste. Very rich in flavor, but very drinkable.  I should have found someone to share this very large bottle with. I'm definitely looking forward to the other 3 bottles.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,CityBoy1986,4.25,"750 ml bottle (partly) into a pint glass.  The pour is a hazy golden colour. The white head is small, fades quickly and leaves only a little lacing.  The nose is a mix of fruit (bananas?, apple, some citrus) and sweetness. The taste is more of the same, with the bananas giving way to the citrus fruits. There is a nice balance of sweetness and bitterness throughout. The alcohol is barely noticeable.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation for the style. Keeping in mind the style, drinkability is high.  This is a very nice tripel, but one 750 ml bottle is enough for me at a time.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,strangemusic,4.62,"Pours cloudy gold to light amber compact finger or so of head fading to a persistent cap. Smell is strong banana and a lingering note of peach, with subtle peppery hints behind. Light yeastiness, all-around light, inviting and sweet.  The sweetness of juicy bright fruit (peach) continues in the taste, strong alcohol and a touch of breadiness to it like sourdough from the yeast. Like the smell there is a spiciness through the middle which fades into a lasting sweet aftertaste. Absolutely delicious!  It's smooth in the mouth with a sparkly zest that builds and fades in a rush from the carbonation, the aftertaste is warm and quite enjoyable. Because of the lip-smacking flavour and the fact that just enough of the big 9% ABV comes through like it should, I give it a good drinkability assessment, but this is definitely one to savour even though it goes down nicely. If I drank this beer too quickly I'd feel overwhelmed by the carbonation and the alcohol presence.  I really like most of Unibroue's beers but La Fin Du Monde has to be my favourite. Bright, flavorful and eminently drinkable. A truly fantastic beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,fingerlaker,3.67,"WOW! ALCOHOL!  Being a tried-and-true liberal Canada lover, I was attracted to Unibrue off the bat. I think Blanch de Chambly is incredible and their brew Maudite is one of the best I have ever tried. Maudite is also probably my favorite beer.  Opening it up, the smell is pretty ""beer-like"" (terrible phrasing, no?) with a little alcohol smell with yeast and some fruit notes that I couldn't figure out. Decent hop notes on the nose. I liked smelling it, it made me feel I had something special comming up.  Similar to other bottle-conditioned brews it has unflappable head retention and bubbles that don't stop.  Taste is overwhelmed by the alcohol. I did notice a nice, dry malt with modest bittering. Again, more fruit that I couldn't figure out. The flavor was quite nice... but that alcohol! It took over the flavor! If it was 7% or so it would be perfect. It also had me wishing it was a bit more bitter. Just a tiny, tiny bit more hops.  It took me a while to finish it, many swallows were forced. I liked the flavor but the alcohol just made it harder to swallow than most brews.  Maybe I need to try it more often. Maybe I had a bad bottle. I usually agree with The Brothers but this time I just didn't think of it as world-class as they do.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,EatsTacos,4.25,"Pours a golden yellow with a two finger head with some spidery lacing on the glass. Drank out of a wine glass.  Aroma is very much like a belgian strong pale ale. The yeast and alcohol can be detected and the malt smells very sugary.  The taste is a lot of sweet, sugary malt balanced well with a spicey hop flavour. Interesting flavour and pretty complex while being smooth and highly drinkable. The alcohol is well hidden but the yeast flavour is definately there.  Great mouthfeel, smooth with a crisp carbonation. Medium bodied. Very nicely done.  Very drinkable, and highly recommended if you're into Belgian strong ales.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Two finger off white head with amazing retention that becomes mountainous as it dissipates.  S: Smells malty with very strong fruit scents: oranges, apples, grapefruit all with a small trace of alcohol and yeast.  T: Very fruity! Strong oranges and grapefruit. Strong yeast and malt flavor that cover up the alcohol quite well and a bit of spiciness.  Overall this was a beautiful beer that smelled and tasted great. Very smooth on the palate and highly drinkable especially for the style  Note: Unlike many higher alcohol content beers the alcohol in this triple doesn't come through as much as the beer gets warmer and nearer the end.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,MerkinMan,4.5,"A: Very bright gold with a thick head that dies down to a thin but resilient lace.  S: Spicy yeast and phenolic scents. There are some peppery and hoppy notes to smell. Smells much like a Saison, though I know it is a tripel.  T: Very bright, yeasty and peppery, finish is that of green apples and pears. This could very well be mistaken for a Saison for how spicy it is. Am I getting a little chocolate? How did they do that? And then it is cut with a dryness that is reminiscent of a woody Californian white wine.  MF: Alive as hell. Seems to double in proportion when it enters the mouth.  D: A hell of a tripel. I wish they all had this kind of character in the place of just the strong phenolic alcohol tastes. If I had to pick one example of a tripel, this would be the one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,StarlightSeraph,4.45,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter.  Appearance: Poured a hazy golden-yellow, with a three finger, frothy white head. Left a heavy blanket of lacing on the sides of the glass. The head subdued slowly, leaving a nice layer for most of the glass.  Smell: Very fruity. Bananas, apples, and hints of clove dominate. The traditional ""belgian"" smell is also apparent.  Taste: Sweet, and very, very smooth. One of the most well-balanced beers I've tasted. A mild tart sweetness is apparent at the front of the palate, which quickly smooths into a honey-like flavor. A slight hoppy bitterness is present in the afteraste. Hints of vanilla become more apparent as the beer warms, which helps bring everything together. Wow.  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated and creamy in the mouth. Very nice. Coats the inside of the mouth, leaving you wanting more.  Drinkability: Exceptional. My only regret is that I only got a 12 oz bottle of it, instead of the bomber. I will absolutely buy this one again. Exceptional beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

I can pick up some banana and thought I smelled cotton candy a time or two.  T: Orange flavors at first that give way to banana and spice. It is really sweet but also very hoppy. Good balance though.  M: Zesty upon entry thats fades to a slightly creamy, dry finish.  D: Very Drinkable. One of my favorites from Unibroue. The hop and malt balance is awesome without sacrificing anything. The alcohol is so well hidden. I think if I were blindfolded I would mistake this one for a hefe",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Pours an opaque yellow/orange...I've never seen tangerine juice before, but this is what I assume it would look like. Big, nice, white fluffy head. I expected it to stick around much longer than it did, but, then again, I did just have a Duvel.  The nose is very complex. The typical Belgian yeast scent is present. Spicy fruity sweetness. Maybe some clove?  Tastes of rich spicy fruits. Leaves a nice spice on the tongue. Some nice alcoholic aftertaste. Great blend of flavors. Very balanced.  Highly carbonated, but still smooth. Creamy, too. Very drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,erikm25,4.42,"A: Pours a light dusky gold with muted shades of tangerine. Two finger head is composed of tightly packed bright white bubbles. Very solid retention. Lacing was present but in the end just slides down the glass.  S: Nose was gently balanced with both earthy and thick grassy tones. Lightly spiced fruity yeasts. Citrus and cloves with honey and lemon peels blended up and soaked in pear mash. Hints of baked bread and cinnamon dipped bananas. There is a lot going on in the nose but still very well balanced.  T: Nice and complex array of fruits in the taste. Very difficult to pinpoint just one since it is so rich and vibrant. Subtle hints of pears, apples, and peaches. Again like the nose bananas and peppers make an appearance. Taste of vanilla with a ginger spiced bite and heavy malt roundness. Little bit of hops to finish things off. Interesting how it really goes from subtle to spicy to sweet before you even know what happened. At 9% this has no hints of alcohol.  M: Smooth, well carbonated, and creamy.  D: The name on this beer alone is great and somewhat fitting for the times. Helps put a smile on your face. Truly delicious. Picked this up in a four pack and it worked out to about $3.47 for a 750ml bottle. Easily one of the best deals in beer I have had to date.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,pseudo,4.55,"Amazing beer here. Poured a cloudy yellow orange into my snifter. A poorly cleaned and widemouthed snifter produces a small bigbubbled head that didn't stick around for long (all my fault, this beer's retention is probably magnificent). Still a great lookign beer even with just a small cap. Smells delightful with mostly hints of spiciness, the distinctive belgian yeast, a citrus breeze, and a nice dose of alcohol (very complex though. Alcohol smell is not overpowering) Tastes mainly of the aforementioned spiciness, with a lingering alcoholic note in the back end. Some breadiness is also detected. Just very balanced and pleasant. Mouthfeel is perhaps a little to thin in my opinion. Quite carbonated (although my glass/pour made it seem less than it probably is), almost champagne like. somewhat dry. Drinkability is exceptional. I drank the whole 750ml in a little over 2 hours, enjoyed every last drop. The alcoholic burn is not significant enough to be annoying, its mainly enticing with a nice warming in the stomach. Wasn't too buzzed after the bottle was done, but i imagine if you drank this quickly in like 45 minutes or something it'd creep up on you. It's 9% after all.

Taste, well, where does one begin, all of the flavours above plus so much more, some stone fruit perhaps, some candy sugar sweetness finished with restrained bitterness which lingers perfectly.  all and all a fantastic beer, why has it taken me this long to try it, will be having many more i'm sure.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

M: Highly carbonated, but smooth and creamy. It really coats the tongue well. All of the right flavors stay with you.  D: In a word, outstanding.

It pours organish, very cloudy. the flavor is very organey/citrusy with some banana. The typical tripel spice/flavor is a bit subdued. Smell is typical of tripels but faint, def. has a bit of that spicey/fruitiness to it, though. IT is sweet and very easy to drink.

Settles fairly quickly into a full layer of white foam leaving no cling as it does. Carbonation continues to rise. Spotty lacing pretty much retreats back into the body as you drink.  S: Yeast, light malt, banana, apple, and clove.  T: Very yeasty, light hoppiness, lightly sweet malty goodness with a subtle spice.  M: Light in the mouth. Yeast really introduces itself, then a light hop, sweet but pungent malt. Not a strong alcohol taste. Carbonation really brings the bouquet to the nose. Slightly dry finish, and not a strong aftertaste.  D: Outstanding drinkability. Great flavor, really easy drinkin'.  Great flavor, great nose, and great feel. Light on the palette, without sacrificing taste. No strong alcohol taste, despite the alcohol content. Really subdued aftertaste, makes you to want to drink more to get back to that yeasty goodness. This is a really great quaff.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bonkers,4,I poured from a 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass. The beer pours a hazy gold with a fluffy white head. The head does not stay around long and does not leave any lacing. The aroma is fruity and spicy. The flavor is full of esters and spices. The beer is a medium bodied sipper that hides its alcohol well. IMO the beer is a bit overrated. While it is a solid triple I do not think it is that much better than some of the other triples I have enjoyed.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Mistofminn,4.51,"My first Unibroue! Might as well be La Fin Du Monde. I figured it was high time I reviewed some Top 100 beers, so I made a haul specifically geared towards that.  Poured from a large bottle into a pint glass. Golden in color, with a head that lasted for a bit. Smell is yeasty with fruity tones. Also a noticeable hop bitterness. Taste is very complex. Fruit, spices, hop bitterness, alcohol. Amazing! I've never had a tripel before and this was a great introduction! Medium body. Very drinkable. The alcohol is very well masked, it's definitely there, but not unpleasant by any stretch of the imagination.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Bagman007,2.49,"Served in a bottle poured into a pint glass.  A- Cloudy orange/yellow color with about two-three finger lengths of head.  S- Has a sweet fruity scent kinda hoppy as well.  T- Very bitter. Kind of sour. Not well balanced. Very strong fruit flavoring. The alcohol is not well hidden at all.  M- Too bitter and sour. Not smooth at all.  D- Can't drink more than one. Had trouble getting the one I had down.  Overall I'm disappointed in this beer. Had heard great things about it, but I just don't like it. Not really a fan of this style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Trajega,4.77,"The primary flavor is a well balanced hoppy mixture, and the aftertaste draws out the threads of the spice. The flavor is rich enough to enjoy the layered apsect for the first sip, and balanced well enough to enjoy it through to the last sip.  I continue to try other Belgians and wheats, but I am not sure I will find a better flavor that continues to the end of the bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,cpn920,4.3,Poured a golden and hazy with a billowing head that dissipated into a thin head with nice lacing. I think I smelled a sour aroma with definite yeast as well. I defintiely tasted a citrus flavor with a slightly spicy characteristic. The mouthfeel was lively with a mild dryness. Really enjoyed this beer and will go back to it from time to time. Definitely a sipper at 9%,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,gory4d,4.17,"Pours pale, cloudy yellow into a goblet; the head is high, thin, white, and doesn't last, though enough lingers to leave lacing down the glass. The smell is straw, grain, fruit, and alcohol. The taste is biscuity, with some banana or papaya notes, giving way to a sharp alcohol burn followed by lingering hop bitterness. It's nicely carbonated, and thick enough to fill the mouth well without sticking in the throat. It's a sipper, for sure, but goes down quite pleasantly. A fine beer, though not my favorite of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Aenema,4.46,"Appearance - Pours a golden honey with a thick, pillowy head. The half inch head eventually recedes, leaving beautiful bands of lacing around the glass. The carbonation is moderate to high and gives the beer a lively lift.  Smell - A mix of sweet citrus and some fruit notes.  Taste - Delicious sweet, spicy flavors entertain the palate.  Mouthfeel - A very smooth beer that flows through the mouth with great carbonation, but feels thinner than it tastes.  Drinkability - Drinking this all night would not be a problem, at least until the next morning. A deceptively easy to drink beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

M - Medium bodied, good carbonation, warming from the alcohol. The taste is complex and offers a few different phases from the point where it hits your mouth to the point where the taste fades away.

22,34,rgrholmes168,4.03,"A very reputable Belgian brew that I choose this afternoon at the Southlake Central Market. The beer pours a nice wispy head that I am rather impressed by. The head slowly disappated living a small opaque trace of lace down the sides of the glass.  A very nice wheat smell is the sense that I get for the aroma of this beer, almost like a hefe. The color is a nice yellow, with a small amount of haze.  The taste was slightly bitter as it went down, but the aftertaste had a pleasant sweetness. A fine flavor for a Belgian Tripel.

Once again, Unibroue produces another fine brew (I have got to make it up there one of these days).  Poured from a standard bottle into a pint glass. Nice golden color with an impressive head that hung around for a bit.  Nice yeasty smell that made me more then ready to get started.  Very smooth up front, with a bit of bite at the back end. The alcohol is noticeable, but not overpowering. A fine tripel.  Not too thin, not too think. Definitely lingers for a few minutes, which is a good thing.  A bit dangerous, if you ask me...such a good tasting brew, yet it is stronger then you would think. I could go through the entire four pack if I wasn't paying attention.  I would highly recommend this selection. Not quite a St Bernardus tripel, but a very nice runer up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Kraken,4.48,"Reviewed from notes.  Thanks again Kasi for this fantastic treat. Poured from a corked and caged 750 ml into an over-sized wine glass. Firm pour yields a 1/4 inch of bright white head. Spotty lace at best. Head falls quickly, color is a dull cloudy orange amber.  Nose- Peaches, pears, some sweetness. A nice bit of yeast. Little bit of booze, and perhaps a mild hop profile.  Palate- Pear, apples, a lite sweetness. Dry, some pepper. Signature unibroue yeast. Mild lemon zest, nice bitterness in the finish. Slightly dry.  Mouthfeel- Zesty, active, finishes dry.  Drinkablility- I only wish the bottle was bigger.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BierBrawlinator,4.65,"Poured a 3 finger head with nice lacing and a head that covered the brew until the end. The color was a mildly cloudy straw gold with active beading. I was able to swirl up a nice froth at any given time.  Smell has some vanilla, clove spiciness, with mild yeasty funk and bubble gum with some fruity esters. The hops are low-key and balance this baby out beautifully.  Taste is incredible. Smooth and creamy with an abundance of flavors. Well blended fruity esters with mild hop character. It tastes like a wit on steroids, with some tripel characteristics. The alcohol seems non-existent until you polish off a bottle. The flavor coats the palate, begging for more.  Savor this one and drink it leisurely or just buy another and start a session. That 9% ABV creeps up on you because this is one sweet brew and I could definitely drink these all day! Without a doubt, this is a world class beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mattffrost,4.57,"Bottle poured into glass.  Appearance: Beer is cloudy light orange. Head is off white. Head dissolves fairly quickly. Good lacing.  Smell Wow a very nice fruity smell. Close to peach in my opinion. Clove smell with some yeast. Spicy.  Taste This is a complex beer. I get clove for sure. Spicey taste. Some fruitness flavors also come out. Not a lot of bitterness on the finish but a touch of it. This beer is fun to drink because of the abundance of really nice flavors. In my opinion this is world class.  Mouthfeel medium to light carbonation, complex and cremy very nice.  Drinkability Very Very hard not to drink to fast. Can't down it to fast at 9% but I want to.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,yesyouam,3.62,"750mL bottle. This brew is a slightly hazy gold with a small, white, big-bubbled head that vanishes almost instantly. The aroma is banana bubble gum, chardonnay or blanc de noir, and vanilla. There is a sour twang in the nose from the yeast and light grass from the hops. It is slick and medium-bodied and fizzy like champagne. There is the warmth of alcohol at the end of the flavor. As just about all the Unibroue offerings, the flavor has a great balance between sweet, sour and bitter. The flavor starts like the aroma and gets spicy like cardamom or something. It then develops a musty noble grape character. It has a medium-length aftertaste of alcohol. This is quite unique. It certainly has wine-like qualities.

22,34,Stonebreaker,4.5,"Appearance: Lovely golden with a healthy but not excessive carbonation, a rich creamy head no doubt from some wheat malt.  Smell: Sweet citrus faint zest and esters, sweet malt.  Taste: One of the most perfectly balanced beers I've ever had. Lemon zest up front mixed with a perfect amount of perhaps pale malt a touch of hops to referee, esters there, a little clove and a rush of warming alcohol to clear out the cobwebs.

Aromas of banana, ginger, vanilla and some spicy hops. Banana, clove, pepper, ginger, curaco flavors combine with a strong malt flavor with some alcohol warmth. Highly carbonated, medium bodied, this is a sparkling mouth coating beer. Very smooth and well balanced, the alcohol warmth is noticeable but mellow allowing for easy drinking.

The aroma is filled with a zesty yeast and clove aroma. Their is also a phenolic aroma along with the clove and some light banana aroma.  The taste is wonderful as it starts with a clove spice and alcohol warmth. The malt kicks in with some really nice sweetness and a dryness from the fruit flavour and finishes with the yeast taste.

22,34,CHSLBrew,4.23,"Poured into a snifter.  A-A very yeast-hazy deep golden beer, it glows ominously (and beautifully) when held to light. 2 cm dull-white head slowly reduces to very little. The carbonation is visibly evident from the intense bubbling on the pour.  S-Sweetish with clove-like phenols. A spicey citrus character.  T-An overall very malty brew. Clove-like characters join a distinct spiciness over a hard-to-define fruitiness (perhpas some mild citrus among many others). A very definite yeasty and bready character from the bottle conditioning. Finishes spicy and clean.  M-Appropriately high carbonation. Medium-heavy body. A slight alcoholic feel, but not at all harsh; instead, quite smooth and enjoyable.  D-I need this one again! It's one of the more enjoyable Belgian brews that in which I have partaken. It's a very fun beer to drink and makes me excited to drink more high-quality Belgian ales.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,MasterSki,3.93,"12 oz bottled September 3rd, 2008. My first Canadian review!  A - Huge white head that dissipates quickly over a murky yellow-colored brew. Plenty of carbonation and attractive lacing. A lot lighter than I was expecting from a tripel.  S - Yeast, lemon peel, cloves, with a hint of malt sweetness in the background. There is a good depth of spices and floral notes - it has more in common with some of the good German hefeweizens than with some Belgian tripels. Actually reminds me of a cross between a saison and a hefe...  T - Sweet at the nose, but gets more savory as it passes through the mouth. There's a sharp bite at the top of the palate, likely from the high ABV. A mix of cloves, honeys, spices and yeast - reminds me of a less sweet and more boozy version of Cynicale.  M - Crisp, refreshing, and bubbly - a little champagne like. I was a little surprised by how thin it was for something so strong - it definitely could be creamier and more full-bodied.  D - Not a style that I'd want to pound for an evening, although at 9% there isn't a huge risk of that happening. This is more of a change of pace beer for me.  I remember liking this a lot more in the past, but maybe that was because I hadn't been exposed to the wide variety of US and Belgian brews that I know now. It's not my favorite Unibroue - prefer Maudite, Trois Pistole, and Terrible.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,HalfFull,4.32,"Poured into a large wine glass from a 12 oz. bottle, this brew shows a hazy orange/golden color with a nice half inch head. Offers decent retention and a pleasant light carbonation that makes for a steady surface ring and artsy lacing on the glass.  Slightly sweet on the nose with notes of apple and pear, along with a subtle hint of spice, peppery clove/cinnamon in nature. Tiny bit of sourness from the yeast.  Taste matches the nose well with a malty sweetness initially, followed by notes of summer fruit and finishing with a lingering spice close. Not overpowering in the malts like some of the style. Offers a rich texture for a Tripel and is quite intriguing.  Decent but not over the top carbonation and a nice medium rich complex body make for a smooth feel and drink. Lot's of wheat and subsuquent haze for the style, a Belgian Wheatwiine of sorts.  Better results from 12 oz. bottles vs. a corked 750 ml. in this case, which is a bit at odds compared to most.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,oriolesfan4,4.15,"I guess I saved the best Unibroue for last. I bought 8 different Unibroue 12 oz singles and finally I can drink one and say I absolutely enjoyed it.  Pours a nice cloudy yellow with a think wisp of a head. Smell is spicy with a clove/banana type of aroma. Taste is very reminiscent of a Hefe, but a tad spicier and beefier. 9% ABV is well hidden and this has superior drinkability. A great beer, I liked this one a lot.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Crunch,4.67,"Poured this into a goblet, it bubbled forever. It has a lasting, creamy head. the color was golden with a slight cloudiness to it. The aromas were fruity and full nosed, with a slight hint of an alcoholic twang when I inhaled deeply. Sweet tasting but not overly so. A full bodied feel in the mouth, the carbonation tingles the tongue, the sweet fruity tastes are pleasurable and there is a slight alcoholic taste.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Sweet, fruity aromas of watermelon and bit of bubblegum, also some yeasty notes in there in well. Taste explosion - it makes my head spin trying to comprehend it. I'll have to fill in the flavors on another bottle but for now suffice it to say that it's a 5 in the taste department. The medium body is perfectly lifted with the carbonation.

22,34,sccala,4.21,"Poured out of a brown 12 oz. bottle with foil wrapped around the neck and cap. Label has a satellite view of eastern Canada. Beer drank from a white wine glass.  A- Eh. Not what I'd expect from a tripel. More golden color than a traditional trip. Pours to a 2 finger head but doesn't hold, and leaves no retention. The light color though does make for a very visible flow of carbonation, which is a slight bonus.  S- Nice array of yeast here. Slight notes of malted barley, and wildflowers as well.  T- Coriander, nutmeg, cloves, a hint of anise. Carbonation is perfect. Has a bit of a creamy aftertaste.  M- I'd ALMOST rather just let this beer sit in my mouth all night than actually swallow it. You can taste many characteristics of this beer on your tongue and lining of cheeks well after the swallow.  D- Very good belgian tripel. If not for the poor scores I gave for appearance, this is right up there with the best trips I've drank. Also worth noting is how suprised I am that this beer is a product of Canada. CANADA??? Impressive!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

They give me the impression that drinking the beer is some king of special event and that I should really prepare myself. Anyway...12oz bottle poured into my Westvleteren chalice (thanks, Flup!)  A - Just how it should look for a Tripel, but nothing too spectacular. Big fluffy white head on top of a hazy dark yellow/straw visibly carbonated beer. Lacks lacing, however.  S - This is a nice subtle nose of bananas, clove, white pepper, fresh lemon confit, bready yeast, and a hit of alcohol. Very well integrated. Really invites you in, but it's not as powerful or big as the nose on others.  T - Tastes like orchard fruits, banana bread, and Belgium. Besides the typical banana/clove flavors, there's also fresh green apple, and some doughy yeastiness here. This is really tasty. I also want to call the flavor profile suave - it just doesn't jump out at you like some others in this style (which is among my favorites) - more refined.  M - This mouthfeel is freaking awesome. Smooth and soft, it's pretty full and round. Just absolutely coats the entire mouth and then cleans it off with some moderate carbonation - a wave of little tiny bubbles comes rushing through, but isn't overpowering. Finish is not that long.  D - High, since this is really delicious! Very well balanced and integrated throughout. Pretty complex. One of the best, if not the best of the non-Belgians.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Out of a caged bottle at a beer tasting at the Fresh Market in Burlington this one was a pale yellow color. The head was two fingers of bright white foam that displayed good retention even as a skim and left streaks of nice lacing. The aroma was of lemon zest, dry wheat, floral hops and semi-sweet malt. The flavors were distinctly sweet, tart green apples, hints of pear, floral and citrus hops, some fruity alcohol esters that then finished on a tangy wheat note. The finish lingered but not unpleasantly. The carbonation and body were medium and the mouthfeel was quite smooth.

Raw sugar, yeast, tangerine and a hint of pineapple come through on the smell.  Taste-- Wow. Malts and yeast dominate in this complex flavor. Fruity tangerine, orange and pineapple take a back seat.

22,34,wiseguy142,4.1,"Pours a dark yellow/light orange. Maybe the color of a slightly overripe orange. Pretty nice head bubbles down to a thin layer with a little circle of dense foam in the middle of my Duvel tulip glass while the foam on the sides is already sticking to the edges of the glass. Aroma is.. well.. Belgiumy. I'm not a huge fan of Belgians and this is a little above normal for me. Belgian yeast aromas with a nice underlying aroma of dried fruit.  Taste has a pretty pervasive alcohol presence that hits every part of the tongue along with a lot of residual sweetness in the aftertaste. Well done and interesting hop flavor accentuates the yeast strain. It's definitely good, but not irresistable just to me.  Mouthfeel, on the other hand, is amazing. Perfect level of carbonation and great water quality. Probably the best part about the beer in my opinion. It has a decently high level of carbonation but it's not intrusive or acidic like in some beers. The small, numerous bubbles really bring out the flavor rather than competing with it.  I'm glad I picked this up again since I don't thin I've had this since right when I started getting into craft beer. I think I enjoyed it a little more when I was just getting into it and my personal taste isn't really leaning towards Belgians in the long run but absolutely worth the buy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Citrus is the most prominent smell accompanied with a bit of malt. Taste matches the smell; nice sweet citrus with a very high amount of carbonation. Maybe this could explain why the 9% alcohol content is so well hidden. The first thing that I thought of when I tasted this was Mill St.'s Belgian Wit, just with more carbonation and a little more complex. This beer is very easy to drink considering its high abv. Overall, thought this was a very good brew just wish they lessened the amount of carbonation.

22,34,GatorBeerNerd,4.52,"12 oz single purchased as part of a Unibroue mixed pack purchased at Whole Foods in Duluth, GA poured into a snifter.  A: Pours a hazy straw like yellow with a faint covering of bubbles that would be hard to call a head. Even though there is a small amount of bubbles they do leave sheets of sticky lacing as the beer is consumed. I would give it a slightly higher score if it had more of a head. I did pour it very slowly and the snifter is oversized. Maybe they contributed to the lack of head.  S: A beautiful citrus aroma dominates the nose. The alcohol is noticeable in the nose, but it is not overpowering at all. It smells very good.  T: There is a nice fruit taste, but it doesn't dominate like the aroma would leave you to believe. It is very subtle. A nice malt backbone, classic Belgian yeast flavors, and some sort peppery spicing. The alcohol is well hidden. This is a very nice tasting brew.  M: The peppery spicing gives it a nice tingle in the mouth. It is a bit thin, but still is enjoyable to roll around on the tongue.  D: This one is too drinkable for your own good.

22,34,ecoastman,4.82,"Drinkability - This was my very first experience. I was looking forward to it for over a week like a trip to a very special destination. Would I go again? Hell ya... but having felt the impact with only 250 mL into the first stretch, I'm afraid I'd wake up naked on my neighbours roof after the second one. Best damn Canadian-European beer I've ever had. I will definitely travel to ""The End of the World"" again.  Appearance - color is an attractive golden clouded haze. Carbonation is champagne-like with a very thin head and low retention.  Smell - Sweet and yeasty with fruity ale tones. Very pleasant - even better after the carbonation has subsided a little and the sharper alcohol tone is less pronounced. A must-have in a chalice style glass. Otherwise you'll be missing out on a great part of the experience.  Taste - VERY nice - great complexity. I'm in Europe again... Even better then the bouquet. Similar clove and banana ester tones like a good german hefeweizen or belgium ale. Sweet finish. Fits the tripel style except for the champagne-like carbonation (which I am surprised to enjoy).  Mouthfeel - Nice...light and thin. As noted, the beer has a high amount of very fine carbonation (again, this is like the champagne of beers).

22,34,dacrza1,4.85,"Preface: I have enjoyed this beer for years, and having requested a case from brother Jer to celebrate my second son's birth (Michael Mark, 10lbs., 12 oz.), I revisit Unibroue's pride with a respectful confidence....thick, pillowy four-finger head froths the in THE La Fin Du Monde tulip... body is thick, orange/peach, and sediment-filled...tracings are like rhythmic ocean waves... flavorful, bright bouquet of yeast... hops are brisk and pleasant, with a slight citric injection... medium-bodied with a full finish--minimal alcohol presence, active but not obtrusive... reminiscent of the Schneider folk's brews--refreshingly clean, crisp, complex with clove, spruce, cinnamon, vanilla, watermelon, pear, and citrus ... palate-cleansing and complimentary to a host of foods--most notably these nachos! Cools and burns at the same time... an almost unbelieveable combination of refreshment and taste, readily causing amnesia at the thought this was ever a tripel at 9%....beautiful.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,tanzaniakate,4.8,"Fruity, warm, full, tasty. More crisp and lively than a lot of high ABV Belgian-style ales. Goes down extremely easily, though, so watch yourself.  Pairs well with lighter meals, like white meats and grilled veggies.  An exceptional value in beer. At $6 for a 750-mL bottle, and less per oz for a four-pack of 12-oz, you won't do better.

A: A nice hazy amber color, reminds me of raw honey. A decent head which did not last too long.  S: Wonderfully light and citrusy, but not overpowering. Nice hints of spice as well. As the beer warmed, the aroma came through even more.  T: Fruit notes, but not overpowering. Has a finish that's always been hard for me to categorized. Clean aftertaste with excellent balance of yeast, malt, and citrus. Alcohol isn't overpowering.  M: Full and smooth, with even carbonation.  D: Very easy to drink, making it dangerous at 9%!

22,34,popery,4.82,"La Fin Du Monde is one of my favorite beers. It is not necessarily the best beer in the entire world, but it's widely available, comes in large and small singles and is a tremendous tripel, no mean feat. Unibroue beers have superb feel and delicious flavors. It's certainly the best tripel that I've tried that is not from Belgium. The beer has a somewhat inconsistent look. The head bubbles up, but it settles into a calm champagne look without much lacing. The misty liquid is quite appealing, on the other hand. The nose is earthy and spicy. It has a genuine Belgian flavor that is subtle and often lacking from American versions of Belgian styles. The flavor has this same Belgian earthiness, that quality that marks some of the best beers in the world. The feel is of a billion tiny needles gently exploding. The drinkability is incredibly high. This beer really made me a big fan of Unibroue. I've tried a lot of their styles and this one still stands as a top beer for Unibroue and craft beer, generally.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mrkc,4.47,"A tall, corked and caged 75cl glass bottle with the Eye of Quebec figuring prominently on the label. The bottle comes with a clear `best by` date, though no indication when it was brewed. The packaging is clear and stately.  Just opening the bottle releases a host of deep, fruit scents. The beer pours as a thin, opaque liquid, about the colour of honey. There's moderate carbonation that, even in my head-friendly glass, quickly fades to a ring of white. It warms quickly, releasing a thick, spicy odour. The yeast is evident in the scent, as are mildy fruity notes, just barely rising into perception.  The beer is peppery and sweet, thin to medium bodied and not syrupy. I has a distinct carbonation when drank, something not apparent from the head, that lends it a moderate bite. The fruit notes get little play in the taste, remaining just off to the side as glance of pear, or whisper apple, it's difficult to tell which. Warmth improves the character of the beer, bringing out the sweetness to compliment the initial exclamation point of allspice.  At 9% ABV, a single person could drink all 75cl by ones self, but it's definitely best shared with a friend on a cold winter night. This is a very good tripel by the good brewers at Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The aroma is smells a bit like bannanas, strawberries, and bread. You can smell the alcohol just slightly.  The mouthfeel is extremely light and higly carbonated. The alcohol level is definitely a factor here adding to a very bitey feel.  Initial taste is just slightly sweet which quickly changes to a sour taste that hits the back and sides of the tongue. The sour, acidic flavors from the yeast are the dominant flavors here.  Drinkability is good. A little too sour for my taste.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Lots of fruit (orange and pineapple) and corriander spice. Belgian candy sugar and some alcohol. Flavors mirror the aroma almost exactly with some slight breadiness coming through. Deceivingly light mouthfeel. Lots of small-bubble carbonation keeps the palate pretty clean. Finishes pretty dry. Quite drinkable with lots of flavor.

Pours a hazy blonde with a massive, bubbly white head. It dissipates, but never completely leaves. Practically no lacing until you get to the bottom of the glass.  The smell is one of my favorite things about Belgian beer made right. Spicy, bready yeast. Lots of it. It smells so damned good.  And just like Tyrone Biggums would tell you, it tastes just like it smells: delicious. Tripels don't get much tastier than this.  Mouthfeel is robust and creamy with a dry finish.

22,34,JohnWaynes44,3.85,"Poured a cloudy golden yellow with pearl like irridescence when held to the light. Big white head bubbled up quickly, dissipating not long after the pour.  The smell is fruity and sweet. Yeast is very noticeable. You can smell the carbonation and the alcohol (probably because of the CO2).  This is really two different beers. Tasting the beer with the head up reminds me of champagne. The carbonation dominates the palate and it finishes dry. Wait a few minutes when the head is flat and more of the beer flavor appears. The malts and yeast come through. Sweeter and more creamy. For me this is much better after sitting for a while.  The mouthfeel shares the same characteristics as the taste. Carbonation fills the mouth all the way to the back of the throat. Very light and crisp when accompanied with head. Smoother and more weight later in the glass.  The life of this brew as it sits in the glass is ever changing. If you pour it in a small goblet or wine glass you can continue to give this beer new life and watch the change over and over. It really has a lot of character. The high abv is not apparent until it is reborn in your glass 3 or 4 times. Then is starts to warm and flush the skin. Really similar to the spumanti.  I have to say I am not in love with this style. I have only tried a handful, but this is by far the most interesting. I recommend everyone try it once. It would be a nice change of pace to replace the bubbly to celebrate th new year. Cheers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

M: light and effervescent, maybe a little sticky; carbonation helps keep the body light.  D: expect the unexpected with this. while the beer is a delight, the biggest surprise to me was the complexity and pleasant character of finishing and aftertaste. balance is more to the sweet side and not much notable hop character. however, I would recommend this to my friends who like blue moon to expand their craft beer horizons.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The spiciness is there as well and there is a sourness to it that I did not expect from the aroma. M- Highly carbonated (which I expected after seeing how it poured), and full bodied. The alcohol is barely noticeable, even as the beer warms. D- Very high drinkability for a Tripel, I could have another bottle or two without any trouble.

Appearance: Out comes a cloudy straw colored liquid with a large fizzy white head that recedes quickly. A look that beckons to be sipped.  Smell: I could smell it as soon as I opened the bottle. Very sweet fruity esters. Orange peel and other mulling spices really hit a home run. Its like drinking apple cider only better.  Taste: The spices really shine along with the citrus. Very complex flavor. A slight hint of bitterness from the hops is quickly balanced by the malts. Also, where is the alcohol? Excellent job masking the alcohol taste. Oh man, I can already tell I'm going to be on the floor after this one.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation is just right. Nice and dry finish. Perfect for sipping.  Drinkability: Normally I would give a lower rating here because of the high alcohol content. However, you don't need to drink very many of these to get the full La Fin Du Monde experience.

A beautiful creamy, billowy, thick head that left a bit faster than I was expecting, deflating to a thin head (more substantial than just top-lacing) that stuck with the glass to the bottom. Only a touch of spotty lacing.  aroma is of fruits and spices. Apple, pear, apricot, and banana up front, with some peppercorn, clove, cinnamon and cardamom spicing. Floral notes back up the fruits, and there's a definite yeast-mustiness that's pleasant and nowhere near as overwhelming as some.  taste is in line with the aroma: fruit and spice notes up front, with some almost-cider-like flavors coming through. Definite yeast breadiness backbone opens up into more hop bitterness and a touch of fruit sourness. The fruit and sour hints caught me off guard, but i warmed up to it quickly. Alcohol notes are minimal.  mouthfeel is beautiful. Full and warming, with some heavy carbonation. The bubbles are almost overwhelming, but they keep the appearance beautiful and keeps the mouthfeel full and creamy.  drinkability is amazing, as the flavors aren't overwhelming, the alcohol isn't overly apparent, and the mouthfeel is both tongue and heartwarming.

22,34,biegaman,4.82,"A goldening shade of apricot with tanned complexion. It sits with striking glow. Its colour is light but its tone is deep and hazed. A feathery patch of white distinguishes itself over top. This can be thickened with swirling and dots the glass with lace.  Its aroma is both pleasantly and potently effervescent. It is also fruity and floral and showcases just a dash of spice. Crisp straw wheat and lightly toasted malts seem doused in white pepper and coriander and then tossed with green apple and golden pear. I know of very few things that can appeal to the sense of smell like a good Belgian yeast.  Fortunately it seems to have had the same impact on taste as well. Again we are treated to sweetened, honey-laced malts tossed with coriander and orchard fruit. It is by no means an intense beer - the flavours are vivid but gentle and moderate. It pleases all parts of the palate with components fruity, malty, floral, tart, and zesty.  The alcohol is deceivingly absent in taste, but the beer possesses a soothing, almost sedative, presence that is indicative of a well crafted 9% tripel. Its higher gravity has done nothing to thin out mouthfeel and quite to the contrary, the mild carbonation and peppery spice give the beer a very lively texture on the palate.  This beer pairs wonderfully with a number of dishes and makes an especially great cheese pairing. While it drinks phenomenally fresh, it also ages exceptionally well. To speak matter of factly: Unibroue makes some of the finest Belgian ales outside of Belgium and 'La Fin Du Monde' is certainly amongst the best examples of a Belgian tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Mouthfeel: Relatively high carbonation, which works nicely with this beer.  Drinkability: Highly drinkable despite the high ABV, because everything just works so well together. I'm not sure what the right analogy is - is this the Porsche 911 of beers? That honor should probably go to a German brew, of course.

Series of numbers near the neck report: C26100036Q for what it is worth. Poured into my gold rimmed Brewery Ommegang Westvleteren style goblet.  A Initially a creamy, off white head but it lasted about a minute over a golden yellow body that initially had swirls of yeast sediment floating about but now is pretty well uniform in its opaque, very hazy look. The head, before I am about to sip it, is nearly a single line of bubbles across the top. A classic, good look for the style. 4.0  S Great balance of Belgian yeast, candi sugar sweetness and light roast malt. I also smell significant warmth of alcohol but it is not only welcomed but it is appropriate to the style. 4.5  T The taste extends right from the smell in that there is the light roast malt, candi sugar sweetness, that great Belgian yeast that is probably the best that I have tasted in a beer brewed outside of Belgium. This is obviously a finely crafted Tripel brewed with the greatest artistry and care. More satisfying than that, it is a pleasure to taste. 4.5  M Some alcohol heat, the Belgian yeast dances across the tongue and there is a nice malty, syrupy thick feel that is appropriate to the style but few Tripels pull off this bigness of this one and that is appreciated. 5.0  D Fair to good with the bigness and the alcohol driving it down but it is so damn delicious (which drive it up!). 4.0  Notes: A classic, world class tripel from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Was only able to fit roughly half of the bottle into the goblet due to the massive amount of white head produced. Extremely high amount of active carbonation working up through a golden colored liquid. Thick, tightly packed foam holds its form beautifully. Aroma is of apricot, apple, banana, rock candy, and yeast. Flavors include subtle grain, candy sweetness, apricot, honeydew melon, clove, and a yeasty, bitter finish. Feel in the mouth is prickly and fluffy from the high carbonation. Chalky light-medium body and warming. A vast array of flavors make this a very intriguing ale to quaff, high alcohol will get in the way after a while.

Very perfume lie. Also some tropical fruits. Some booze in here as well. All of these aromas compliment each other well.  T: clove flavors with plenty of fusel alcohol. Good soft pils character in the malt base. Slight bitterness at the end. Sweet but not overly so. this is a very well put together beer.  MF: Medium body. Dry mouthfeel. Well carbonated.  D, notes: A very good tripel. Not overly sweet, clove phenolics are spot on.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,nighthawk,4.72,"Pours a hazy dark yellow with a small white head that dissipates quickly to a thin haze on the surface of the beer. Strong fruit on the nose, both dark (plum) and lighter (some banana) with some pine hops and faint pice (ginger or clove). Strong dark fruit flavours, with spice and pepper up front. Lighter fruit flavours follow. Malts provide a solid backbone to the palate. Alcohol is strong on the finish, with both sweetness and spice, with some nice hops providing accompanying bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice and chewy, medium body with the carbonation making itself felt. Slightly drying on the finish. The high alcohol is definitely felt, but not overpowering. Bold through and through, this beer may not be a quaffer, but it is a wonderful beer experience.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,MarcGetty,5,"Drinking La Fun Du Monde will have you feeling fin-tasktic and fin-taboulous! It is truly an exceptional beer that is difficult not to love.  Long before my 2002-era craft beer enlightenment I had heard of this beer being available in Canada from friends and how it was absolutely awful. Some time in 2002 or 2003 I tried it for myself and thought that I may need to get new friends as the beer I tried was exceptional!  The beer has all of the typical characteristics of a Belgian Golden Ale - light in color, bright crisp taste, very effervescent and high in alcohol. The head is perfect - light but not too much.  Available in both 12oz and 750ml bottles, I usually choose the 750ml bottles myself. Many a night has Fin put a smile on my face!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,tr4nc3d,4.47,"Pours a nice clear liquid gold color with a huge head that goes away pretty quickly. Noticable lacing sticking to the side of the glass.  Spicy floral notes, like apples that have been out of the frige for a while. A little alcohol smell to it.  Taste sweet, fruity like, with a nice hop finish to it.  Mouthfeel was light to me, nice rich tasting feeling.  Drinkability for this one is very good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TeamSeabass,4.22,"Poured into wine glass. It's a nice hazy solid gold color. Nice bit of carbonation on the pour and still plenty left on the drink.  Smells of sweet apples, very strong. Tastes of clove & very sweet...where's the alcohol? Not at all like a 9%-er. I didn't taste any apple. Aftertaste gets a bit of mild bitterness that lingers.  I like this tripel style and this beer makes me want to experiment more with other tripels. This beer is great and I'll give it more opportunities to grow on me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Voonder,4.37,"Pours cloudly yellow with thin white head. Smell - fruity, sweet and very much yeasty. Very nice smell actually. Taste is pretty much the same - yeasty, fruity. It's a strong beer but in the nice way. Very balanced. Very smooth. Easy to drink. Overall - it's a very good brew, excellent sipper, I truly enjoy it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,rtratzlaff,4.68,"La Fin Du Monde give little information on the bottle or on the packaging. It says little, but upon pouring into a goblet the look, smell, and sound this beer creates is amazing.  A bone white half inch head that is the smoothest looking whipped cream looking head ever. The body is slightly cloudy light golden with tons of continuous bubbles. The head crackles from the steady carbonation.  The aromas given are spicy clove characteristics with the fruitiness of an apple orchard. Quite sweet in the smell. A warming finish from the alcohol comes up as well.  Flavors on the tongue are apples, spice, and an earthy finish from the hops.  The mouthfeel is amazingly fluffy. Due to the 9% abv you might want to sip this with a really good meal.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,itcomesnpints,4.47,"Golden bath with a high rise ivory head. No lacing, but there is an interesting fountain of bubbles rising from the center. A fruity aroma of apples and pears, with a gleam of hops, clove spice and bready yeast. A magnificent taste of fruits and spices and a light, very smooth mouthfeel that just barely conceals the alcohol. A world-class tripel that lacks the same complexity of premium Belgians of the style. I wish I would have taken greater advantage of Unibroue while I was going to school in Quebec.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JBushEsq,3.57,"I've had this one a couple of times, overall its pretty good, but my drinking of it pretty much depends on what else I have to choose from - if theres not much to speak of, then I would get this again.  A: Light and a slighly cloudly yellow  S: It has light floral hints in its aroma along with a stong smell of yeast.  T: Overall, not to bad - fairly yeasty and crisp, with a little hop in its finish.  M: Not much to say here, the alcohol is hidden pretty well and it is neither light nor heavy in feel.  D: See above, I'd get it again, but it would be far from a top pick.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,PerzentRizen,4.4,"This is like Triple Karmeliet and Delirium Tremens had a baby. This beer is malty and fruity and the alcohol is almost completely hidden.  I poured mine into a Duvel glass at around 50 Degrees Fahrenheit. It's cloudy and rich with a bug billowy head that reduces to pockets of lacing. The etched ""D"" on the bottle seems to stir up a head upon command easily.  The smell is of toasted almonds, and fennel seed. The alcohol can be smelled, but not really tasted. I can also smell faint banana and citrus fruit in the background.  The taste is fruity and toffee-like. It seems to be sweet then the alcohol and light hop character take over then it passes and goes to a robust malty finish. Those that think this beer is not complex should send me some ""truly"" complex beers. I am loving the flavors.  The mouthfeel is deep, rich, and creamy. How is it possible that a beer this light could be so thick and full in the mouth.  If it were not for the 9% ABV I would sit and drink this all day. I think Unibrou hides their alcohol well - a sign of a truly gifted brewer. I will definately buy more of this excellent brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Hints of pepper and clove come in, as well as some fruits like white grape and orange. Warming alcohol enters at the end  M: Fairly dry, yet smooth.

M- pretty thin but creamy  D- my favorite trippel, and something that would be much more sought after if the good people at Unibroue didnt make it available everywhere. i could easily finish the whole 750 by myslef, but at 9% abv wouldnt be able to take any more than that. theres a reason this makes the top 100 beers on planet earth. check this one out.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Offa,3.63,"Slightly hazy pale gold, it has a large, dense, off-white head that lasts a long time but leaves only a little weak lace.  The aroma is yeasty grain and banana with pears, meaty, winey alcoholic fruit, a bit raw on the alcohol, and hints of spice.  The taste is very muted, mostly very subtle pears, winey grapes, light, soft yeasty grain. It has a warming alcoholic sweetness, fairly smooth with a light bitterness. It is light, zesty, and crisp at the same time that it is a bit almost oily soft and warming, which is an interesting point. The flavours, however, are subdued and it lacks richness or real complexity. There is a hint of some complexity, but the qualities seem so muted and muddled that not much is going on aside from alcoholic sweetness and tart, yeasty fruit.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,clayrock81,4.28,"A cloudy orange with two finger head that leaves a lovely lace ring down the glass. A fragrant smell with some sweetness and something akin to citric notes in the smell. A ginger snap hit my tongue first in this medium-bodied beer. It also warms but is sweet and smooth and has that heavy and dark fruits taste that Belgians contain. Has a slightly dry backbite to complement the slickness the beer passes with over the tongue. This is one of the best beers around in any style, not just Tripels.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,WHROO,4.79,"750ml corked & nearly locked down with a fasterner. Poured a pale ale colour with some floaties. Not bad head retention with no real lacing, but gr8 carbonation The lack of head & lacing was the only downside to this wonderful beer. Honey malts, yeasty, bready in the aroma. More spices like coriander & cloves in the flavour...this is incredibly smooth & moussey. The alocohol was evident yet very welcoming & added to its joy. No real bitterness or hops present. Mouthy was creamy, alive & champagne mousse in carbonation. This too me, has the same brilliance as La Chouffe, just so easy to enjoy & have way more that just one - although with the ABV sadly I was only restricted to a couple. This would be magical if this had half the ABV but the same near orgasmic flavours & mouthfeel. Oh Nelly!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,IBUnit63,4.37,"750 corked & caged into Ommegang chalice...  Clean, thin 1/2-1-finger yeasty even head with a clear seam topping a cloudy, honey body with quick carbonation. Looks like a good Trippel - last pour heads up a lot more but goes quickly.  Telltale Tripel signs of bountiful coriander, a little clove and ginger and nice yeast character. Hardcore electricity and wheat-ish bite. Strength dissipates with warmth.  The spicy tone of this is extremely solid and electric...clean, yeasty profile with mild malt sweetness. Solid carbonation gives this a slight saltiness that blends well to make a clean-drinking experiment in Beautiful Chemistry.  A hearty, husky malt/yeast/wheat profile gives this an extremely solid woody backbone. The spicy sweetness is balanced with the ample carbonation to provide a greay palate tingle. This exhibits quintessential Tripel mouthfeel.  This drinks at a very responsible pace. Not quickly but not too slowly. Matters, as it's a pleasure to enjoy. One of the best all-around offerings that has been given a ""good look"" in some time...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ChainGangGuy,4.02,"Appearance: Pours lightly hazy, golden-orange body with a smallish, white head.  Smell: Fruit juice aroma smelling of pears, peaches, and pineapple -- really any fruit starting with 'p' will do. Nicely spicy, hint of orange peel, too.  Taste: Pale malts and a large portion of candi sugar quickly followed by a flavorful medley of fruit juices from the nose, plus a greater portion of banana. A counterbalance of spices, bitterish orange peel, and hops try to match the sugars present. Slight yeastiness throughout, maybe a bit of bagel dough. Finishes crisp and quite fruity.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Slight stickiness to the mouthfeel. Medium-high carbonation.  Drinkability: So fruity! A delicate, delightful tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Pleasant phenolic complexity, mild spice/clove with lots of breadiness. Haughty aftertaste. Most robust part! Sourdough again. Almost a meaty, earthy vegginess. Almost like a tuber.

Dirty golden color with some hints of light orange. Tornado of carbonation bubbles up the center of the glass to the top. The aroma is heavy dough and yeast, pineapple and melon, and crazy belgian-like funkiness.  Taste is yeasty, also consisting of acidic fruits. There is a quick, stinging bitterness to it. The alcohol is hidden nicely. Heavy carbonation with a medium body. The aftertaste makes is some combo of dry, yet sweet. This is my go-to Unibroue beer",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,andrewm190,3.73,"This is clearly a quality beer, I'm just not sure its quite my type. Poured from a bottle, it boasts a powerful head. The color is golden and cloudy. The smell is dominated by the unique yeasts, as is the taste, which also boasts a bit of a hoppy flavor, at least to my palate. The dominating trait is the carbonation; I find it a bit overbearing. I'm not a huge fan of the taste, which is just a personal choice. I will say the the beer seems very much of good quality. I personally prefer something different.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S: Full rich aromas pour out of the glass... yeast, esters, a bit of cloves and a lot of corriander assualt the nose.  T: Solid malt profile with a strong yeasty flavor. I also taste ripe fruit and a spice that lingers on for a while. As this beer warms up, the alcohol comes through stronger.  M: Very carbonated with a fairly thin body. The carbonation tickles the tongue and brings out the flavor.  D: Easier to drink than some of the other tripels I have had, but the high alcohol content can seriously limit the ammount of these you could drink in a single session.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,theghost3,3.98,"Appearance is impressive--thick, champagne-like head with a cloudy gold color that seems to glow. It smells strongly of yeast, apples & cloves with hints of vanilla & spices, somewhat grassy. The taste is less apparent than the smell,--rather spicey, fruity, very little alcohol taste.

22,34,SykDoc,4.02,"Initial appearance of a cloudy golden ale with initial head that quickly disappears to a thin coat on top. Primary aroma of fruits and some herbal/spicy scents that follow. You can also smell the yeast quite quickly. The taste also compliments the aroma. You get a healthy taste of yeast with a fruity overlay of both apples and bananas. Although it is 9%, this seems to be well hidden by the fruity and spicy notes. It has a reasonably crisp feeling in your mouth and is light bodied overall. Generally, I feel this is a good beer but a bit too much fruit for my palate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Aroma - Spicy Belgian yeastiness, strong slightly tropical fruits (pineapples, oranges, some strawberries, limes), peppery, some vanilla notes, freshly cut grass, marzipan, floral honey, sea salt notes...  Taste - Nice biscuity malts and Belgian yeast, good fruitiness (apples, oranges, some pears, light pineapples), good pepperiness, alcohol is just noticeable, honey / sugary sweetness, decent amount of anise, medicinal, fresh bread, some almond traces...

22,34,santa109,4.35,"Served at 55 degrees. Bottled on January 16th, 2006. Just over 2 and a half years ago. 750ml bottle.  A: Pours a beautiful golden color into a chalice. Very little head but a decent amount of bubbles rush to the top. Typical of an old bottle. A swirl shows how much the liquid holds on to the glass. Just like harder alcohol.  S: The usual spice character is pretty much all gone, only traces of it remain. The dominant smell is pear. Faint alcohol smell. Very enticing.  T: Again, the clovey character is almost totally gone. The taste is very subtle. Pears dominate. Very smooth sweetness. A delight but possibly a tad past its prime.  M: A bit oiley, very very smooth. Carbonation is just right, a bit weaker than with a fresh bottle.  D: I shared this bottle with a friend and we were quite content having a glass each. Don't get me wrong, this was a very enjoyable beer but the sweetness of the pear taste kinda outgrew us.  Overall, old Unibroue bottles are great. That's the second time I had a chance to have one (the other was Trois-pistoles) and both blew away the fresh ones. I tend to find their usual spiciness a bit overpowering and this fades away as they age.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Actually had to 'pop' the cork...  Spout looks pretty clear/light yellow but pours a perfect Hawiian sunset golden orange (trying to be more descriptive). Big lumpy head of mush.  Smell is all fruit. Oranges, bananas, exotic ones my puny brain can't fathom and underlying common scent of 'beer.'  Tart fruit taste. Quite similar to a mimosa actually. Some clove flavors. Light bananas. Can't have clove without banana.  Feels just a hair harsher than it needs to be, but I really think this orange juice beer is toast.

Pours a dark yellowish-orange color with a fluffy three-finger head that dissipates into a thick layer of bubbles on top and a thick ring around the glass. Lacing is pretty sticky.  Smells pretty good. Lots of light fruit - bananas with some citrus notes - and some spiciness.  Tastes similar to how it smells. Very sweet up front with a spiciness at the end and a light fruit aftertaste that lingers. There's definitely some alcohol warming at the end as well.  Mouthfeel is great. The thickness is spot on, and the carbonation makes the beer explode. It coats the mouth and then disappears, leaving me wanting another sip. Really great.  Drinkability is very good. It's hard to taste the alcohol outside of the warming, so it's slightly dangerous, in a good way.  Overall I'm glad I finally bought the beer that's been staring me in the face for so long.

Pours out a murky, golden, light amber color. poured into a Duvel tulip, produces a gorgeous three finger head. A glassfull of apricots, oranges, peaches, backed by a yeasty-clove like spicyness. Light crisp tones of wheats and hay add to the complexity. A slight alochol note is detected, becomes more apparent as beer warms. Flavors are a phenominal explosion of sweet fruits, spicy yeasts, thick, slighly sweet, with a nice long lingering alcohol finish. Orange,grapefruit, pears, apricots, with a great balance of alcoholic spiciness. Finishes a little sweet, but really good nonetheless. This bier, as with every Unibroue brew is immensely flavorful, and exceptionaly balanced. It is called a Tripel on BA, but I would call this one a BSPA.This is a world-class BSPA that is fairly easily accessable.

The color is a very attractive cloudy dark maize.  Very complex and smooth aroma, with an alcoholic warmth to finish.  Taste is fantastic. Very complex fruity flavor up front with clove and spice on the back end and I can't taste the alcohol, which is quite impressive for its 9% abv.  Mouthfeel is also fantastic, it is very thick, rich, and dare say creamy. It goes down exceptionally smoothly and leaves your mouth watering for the next sip.  Overall drinkability is also fantastic.

Tripel isn't one of my favorite styles, but I absolutely love LFDM. I'll try to be objective here.  A: A painfully slow pour from a foil-wrapped 12 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip yields 3+ fingers of frothy head that crests the lip, but does not overflow. After a minute or two, the head has receded to a ring leaving fat chunks of sticky lace on the glass. A hazy golden glow eminates from the glass, begging me to drink.  S: Notes of peach and apricot are most obvious up front. Lurking in the background is possibly a bit of honey and a mild spiciness.  T: Fruity flavors are most obvious up front, with notes of golden raisins and a bit of banana from the Belgian yeast. There's also some mild toast flavors. The finish shows just a hint of hop bite with a nutty aftertaste.  M: Rich and full bodied. The only knock is that a bit more effervescence would be appreciated. Maybe I should have been even MORE careful on the pour!  D: Like I said up front, this is one of my favorites! I could sip this one all night, but it is definitely a sipper.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

There's a lot there. The mouthfeel is pretty full although something seems a bit off with a tangy, somewhat sour, very yeasty, citrus (oranges and bananas) flavor. There is an alcohol rush in there so you know it's 9%. I've had other Tripels recently that are better, Karmeliet and Chimay Cinq Cents come to mind, but this is a better beer than I original though. 4 years ago I had said -- La Fin Du Monde does mean ""End of the World"" which is what's going to have to happen for me to ever try this crap again!

Finishes with a faint spice - cloves, maybe, with a little citrus, banana and some malt. Very little hops there in the background.  Solid, thick mouthfeel. Perfect amount of carbonation.

Now that I am grizzled I enjoy it more. I remember it tasting rough at time but now it is smooth thanks to me killing my palate.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mtbbaboon,5,"Man, this is some good beer. I picked up a four pack that 'expires' two years from now. It pours a very cloudy and dark blonde with a moderate head that disappears rather quickly. It left some lacing that looks nice on the glass. Smells and tastes fruity sweet with mild spice. It feels light in the mouth and a little bubbly. It goes down dangerously smooth and the flavor lingers for quite some time. I can't imagine myself enjoying a beer much more than I enjoyed this one. I had planned on drinking one but it was so damn good that I drank three, then fell into a wonderful comatose sleep. I will be buying more of this.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ectomorph,4.57,"750ml bottle best by 11-15-10  A - Pours a cloudy lemon color with nice white head that does fade but sheets the glass nicely...  S - Smells like sweet raisins and possibly figs with a alcohol warmth on the back.  T - Wow, like smooth bubble gum fruit flavors balanced with ABV bite and a little bread. Very clean and makes my mouth water wanting more.  M - Very nice body and carbonation tickle. Outstanding.  D - Yesterday Maudite, today this, I live like a KING!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,swizzlenuts,4.42,"The beer is poured with a bronze colour and a decent inch head that seems to be filled with a lot of carbonation. The retention isn't very good, but that's alright for a triple. The nose on the beer is beautiful, it is fruity and loaded with complexity and spices. The most prevalent fruit is a citrus flavour. The beer tastes of citrus with some spices; what makes this beer the best is the sweet citrus flavour. The citrus flavour is mixed with some other flavours I can't pick up on. The mouthfeel is carbonated and creamy. This beer is drinkable as hell.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Yimosan,4.15,"Appearance is cloudy and orangy with a yellowish thick head. The head faded fairly quick, but left nice rings around my tulip glass.  On the nose I get a sweet citrus aroma, almost tangerine-like, as well as spicy undertones, the kinds of spices you'd taste during the holiday season.  The flavor is definitely citrusy and Champagne like with an aftertaste of bread pudding with a bit of cloves.  The alcohol is there and you feel it, but it is not unpleasant; I would say it is beautifully disguised.  This ranks up there with some of my favorite trippel style beers.  Note: I have had it on tap and bottle and I prefer tap by a long shot (personal preference).  Drink up!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,treyrab,4.5,"Poured from the bottle into a chalice.  A: Hazy light gold with a huge frothy head. This is the epitome of a great looking beer in my opinion!  S: Tons of Belgian yeast, light fruits (bananas), and tons of malt in this one.  T: Extremely clean and refreshing is what makes this 9% monster so great. The alcohol is hidden so well one cannot even notice it! The flavors blend together so well and the Belgian yeast is not overwhelming.  M,D: The active carbonation leaves the mouthfeel superb, and the hiding of the alcohol makes this very, very drinkable!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,SeanRedd,4.35,"Ahhh...Champagne memories. Flan, sweet custard, blended lychee on a cripsy bed. Subtle sweetness and remarkably thirst quenching...all the while inebriating with a 9%; you will never know it is there. A river of tang that flourishes in all aspects of its character.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,marksto,4.32,"Pours hazy yellow with medium bright white head. As the head falls it leaves a significant rim of foam around the edge. Aroma displays big fruit and spice with a little mustiness in the background. Apples and cloves dominate. Flavor offers a bright, fruity character balanced nicely with a sharp spiciness. Mouthfeel is very spritzy and effervescent, with a medium-light body. The 9% alcohol is well hidden behind all that flavor.  Overall, an excellent Tripel, and one that I think holds up nicely against even the finest examples from Belgium. Recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,btuthill,4.82,"Pours light amber from a 12 oz bottle. Head is big, bubbly, active, but fades quickly. Smell is delicious - lightly effervescent, spicy, bready, warm, maybe citrusy, definitely enjoyable. The taste is great, like, to the point that it makes some pretty phenomenal beers look pedestrian. It is as smooth as the finest stouts. Taste is clean at first, turning to a bubbly, spicy bread as it crosses the tongue, and finishing smooth. It clings heavily to the roof of the mouth and back of the tongue without ever even bordering on 'heavy'. The flavor stays with you long after the beer goes down, and it is appreciated by this lucky drinker.  This beer is absolutely world-class and I could either drink one every night or a series of them in one night. Thanks to the local beer store (Wine and Cheese in Clayton) for marking these down last week, or I would have waited even longer before trying it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,corey0212,4.55,"Pours a cloudy pale yellow color, white head fades out quickly, leaves minimal lacing on the glass, and an astronomical amount of particles floating in the beer. Smell is juicy pears, some spicy clove, yeast, apples. Much more apple in the taste, spicy peppery notes, more sweet pear. Tart, drying, borderline puckering at times, but really refreshing. I have officially fallen in love with this style, and with this beer in particular. Delicious.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,PhillyStyle,4.38,"Poured from a 750ml corked bottle:  Th beer poured a great hazy orange color with a light white head that dissipated farly quickly. The aroma was light but with the belgian accents you would expect, sweet, slightly malty, some spices and I swore that I smelled peppermint. The taste was excellent, the citrus and spices dominate the flavor and the alcohol is slightly noticeable. The beer had good carbonation and was light but smooth and very drinkable. I will definately be going back to the store for more of these. Overall, an excellent beer, highly recommend.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,kinger,4.43,"Was able to pick up a four pack instead of the bombers which are typically offered. Sampled this on a few separate nights and had a couple tonight before, during, and after dinner. I'm a fan of Unibroue's darker Belgian Styles but this is an excellent Tripel and quite possibly my new favorite of their brews. Strong malty aroma with a nice earthiness and spicy accents. Great pour, orange-yellow dark in the middle and lighter around the edges with a monster of a head. This beer couldn't be smoother and a pleasant finish with a slight alcohol burn is perfect for me. Hearty flavor huge malt presence with some spicy goodness. Slight citrus tops off a marvelous brew. Overall this is near the top on my list.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,midaszero,4.1,A - Hazy light gold color with 1 finger of white head  S - Fruity and yeasty (Belgian) with a little bit of spice  T - Citrus with malts and light fruit. Alcohol is noticeable  M - Medium body and medium carbonation  D - Pretty enjoyable and I know a lot of people love it but I personally think there are better examples of the style,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Goliath,4,"Pours a cloudy pale orange color with a one inch bright white fluffy, foamy head. Poor retention and a bit of lacing.  Aroma is nice. Some good citrus and spice dominates. A bit of yeast as well.  Taste is good. Citrus and spice dominate again with a bit of yeast in there too. Seems like a wit with high ABV.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly carbonated.  Drinkability is moderate. Flavor is fine making for easy drinking, but alcohol is pushing the high end restricting it a bit.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Zadok,4.53,"Poured an almost orange juice orange with a very thin bubbly head and virtually no lacing to speak of.  Wow, almost had an OJ smell right at first. Spices are obviously apparent such as clove and banana. Also smell a scent of alcohol in the background.  First taste of cloves and other spices with a warming alcohol presence, nothing overpowering but nicely blended with all other aspects and flavors.  Mouthfeel is of a light champagne, definitely a decent amount of carbonation. Finish is mildly dry yet very fluffy on the palate. Consistency is almost of a Mimosa.  Without question a very delicious quality brew and very deserving of all the accolades. ABV makes for having only a couple in a setting but I would be willing to test the limits on that.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,chefdejour,4.47,"A - Poured from a 12 oz bottle - hazy dark golden with crisp, thick off white head - dissipated quickly without lacing.  S - Spicy cloves and esters with a faint hint of alcohol. Bananas and sweet fruit - strawberries? Biscuit / bread aromas mingling throughout.  T - sweet, light yet deep malt flavors with the same spicy / clove flavors mixing throughout. Sweet fruit (strawberries again) fading as beer warms.  M - crispy and medium to full bodied - smooth and somewhat viscous  D - VERY easy to drink - the alcohol is well hidden. Nicely balanced and an excellent representation of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BWH3,3.82,Appearance: Bubbly white head billows up with the pour then disintegrates into a ring that clings to the sides. Gorgeous golden with just the right amount of haze. Color and clarity are perfect but head is weak. .  Smell: Wonderful fruit esters from the yeast reminiscent of apricot or peach. The alcohol spice as well as peppery clove is detectable. A sour touch typical of the Unibroue strain. No hops or malt character detectable in the nose.  Taste: Delicious malt sweetness with apricot notes followed by the peppery clove spiciness and alcohol warmth. The high alcohol content gives a hot solvent quality on the throat. Enjoy the tingling spiciness on the lips and palate. Essentially not anything noticeable from the grains or hops. The aftertaste is hot and dry. I wish the grist gave more depth and that the hops showed me something. I feel the taste and smell rely essentially entirely on the yeast. Thank god it is a great strain.  Mouthfeel: High fuzzy carbonation with medium body. This is about perfect  Drinkability: Well done. There are better Tripels but not many in the Western Hemisphere can top this one.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Jwale73,4.03,"Served in my DT tulip. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a 1.5 inch bright white, tight cap that eventually settled into a consistent slick of foam. Sheets of sticky lacing coated the glass throughout the tasting. Scents of spices and wheat. Flavors of lemon zest, pepper, coriander, yeast and alcohol. Green apple and pear were expressed as the brew warmed. Mouthfeel is very lively with a residual tingle that lingers between quaffs. Consistency is between light- and medium-bodied. What more can be said about this tripel; an excellent brew to slowly sip as the world comes to an end around you.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,naterock,4.35,"pours a cloudy yellish orange, looks like there is a bit or tiny specs of black maybe cloves.  Smells or orange peel and citrus hops. coriander and cloves, pine and a smooth malty scent.  tastes very smooth and spicy. a bit or coriander and cloves is very apparent nicely balanced with all of the flavor. the most flavorful trippel brewed outside of belgium.  M: medium carbonation, leaves a bit of spiciness behind.  I would definitely reccomend this to anyone who likes beer, very finely crafted and a fantastic brew overall.

22,34,hwwty4,3.88,"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Unibroue tulip. This beer pours a hazy golden orange with a big, frothy 2 finger head that melted into a thin layer on top of the beers surface. A steady line of carbonation shot up steadily rejuvenating the head. The aroma is citrus, lemons and oranges, up front with hints of clove and banana coming through. The taste is really sweet. Just a bit to much for me. It really overpowers the other flavors in the beer. I find it quite a bit distracting. Notes of vanilla, oranges and clove come through also. The mouthfeel is full bodied but still light on the tongue. While triples are not my favorite style, I definitely think I might have another one after this.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,marc956,4.62,"Not one to drink a pitcher of mind you but it's by far one of my favourites.

22,34,DmanGTR,4.55,"Ah, La Fin Du Monde - ""The end of the world."" I have been waiting to try this one by Unibroue and I finally had the chance. The title was a little intimidating, yet intriguing. Enjoyed 2 months before the freshness date said so. I have a couple more bottles to cellar.  A - poured a lovely cloudy orange amber with a white 1.5"" bubbly head in my tulip. Left little lace but retained a thick cap. Some sediment present from a swirled pour.  S - citrusy orange peels, cloves, ripe apples, caramel, and a light yeastiness. As it warmed, the alcohol became more apparent. Quite aromatic.  T - Juicy citrus tones and caramel malts all over. Hints of clove and coriander and some alcoholic spice that became quite apparent as the temperature increased. Some hoppiness in the finish and yeastiness which added to a somewhat dryer finish towards the end. Sweet and spicy.  M - medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation to hold it all together. Very smooth and I daresay even a little creamy. The alcohol is very warming on the throat and is certainly delightful.  D - exceptionally drinkable for a 9% abv beer. I would sip through a couple bottles of this all night long...but I must save them for special occasions :)  Overall - I bought this particular one from a Unibroue variety pack that included one each of all of their year-round brews. I must say this is one brewery that makes nearly all exceptional beers. La Fin Du Monde is a great Tripel style ale and everyone should try this at least once.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

It has a banana, citrus, apple like taste to it. A little spicy but not really that much  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied.

Smells of candy, candy, candy....hmmm...candy sugar. Sour yeast, and citrus...probably from hops.  Tastes sweet from the excessive malts. Alcoholic spiciness dominates the pallette. Funky yeast flavors followed by firey spicy alochol. An asperin like aftertaste lingers on and on.  Very sweet sticky mouthfeel. Lots of carbonation.  Overall a great beer. Perhaps, too much bitter aftertaste for me.  Hard for me to rate this one good on the drinkibiliby...maybe I just am not in the mood for this beer right now?",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Very complex taste that has a fruity taste matched by a light malty buttery trail.  Classic unibroue carbonation and crispness that keeps it very lively in your mouth.

22,34,CrellMoset,4.4,"Bottle picked up from Harris Teeter in Charlottesville, VA. Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice.  Appearance: Slightly hazy, gorgeous, even white head, big spritzy bubbles comin' on up, and mild retention.  Aroma: Very soft and yeasty. Some fruity esters that aren't sharp or sweet. Yeast, spices, yeast spices, and phenols - cloves aplenty!  Taste: The nose (i.e., yeast notes, fruity esters, some spices) + a lot of dry tartness, a few other spices and nondescript esters, and a smooth alcohol in the finish. Well-crafted.  Mouthfeel: Flawlessly even and effervescent - high carbonation and large bubbles doesn't stop it from being fantastic. It's perfectly uniform, with a huge amount of that Belgian ""evaporation"" action. Unique.  Drinkability: Very balanced, dry, complex, with high (though well hidden) alcohol.

Both the fruitness and yeast present them selfs in the begining with a surprising hop bittering at the end. The smell made me believe this beer would be sweeter but it finishes nice and dry. Overall this beer is really really good.  M- Alot of carbonation comes though massaging the tounge and a medium body.  D- This beer is a great end to a day but because of its strength I wouldnt drink too many at one sitting.  Everyone should try this beer at least once.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,TwinSox33,4.53,"Gotta love Québec!  Beer poured a dark-hazy orange-yellow, very deep hue. Smelled of fruits, cloves, and earthy spiced grains. The taste was majestic! It tasted slightly of either orange or fig, with a peppery undertone, perhaps some coriander, as well? I think there was a hint of ester of banana too. The alcohol bite was hidden well, smooth and effervescent with champagne-like bubbles. my favorite Unibroue, is still either Quelquechose or Ephémère, however. That takes nothing away from this one though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Super fast moving active carbonation rushes up the side. Seems a tad bit over carbonated. Aromas start with spicy grains and light fruity aromas as well. Banana and apple are present along with clove and pepper. Earthy yeastiness about it. Quite robust, it almost smells creamy. Nice.  First sip brings a malty sweetness upfront that quickly give way to a ton of spicy, fruity flavors. Banana notes mingle with clove and pepper accents. The house yeast really shines through here with an earthy aspect to it as well. Flows down and finishes with peach and lemon accents, quite creamy with only a hint of alcohol. Tasty triple.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good creaminess. Carbonation is quite fast paced as it rushes down with each sip. Overall, a very enjoyable triple that also packs a bit of a punch as well. A couple bottles and I'd be feeling quite nice.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

I get some spicy watermelon, cloves...maybe a bit of freshly chopped jalepeno?  Taste is much the same, which is good. A fine example of a beer tasting like it smells. Cloves, yeasts, hints of bubble gum. Belgian goodness from Canada, eh? Reminds me of Pranqster, but smoother. Nicely carbonated, mouthfeel is perfect!

Aroma is yeasty, spicy tones, candi sugar, some breadiness.  This brew is bursting with flavor. I'm detecting mostly spicy notes, but also a sweet fruitiness. Finishes a bit bitter on the tongue and leaves it tingling with spice.  Mouthfeel is medium-light and crisp, yet still smooth.  This is one of my favorite tripels.

Eventually a layer, 1 cm thick, remained. The beer has a misty yellow colour with some nice pearly carbonation running along the glass. The scent is exceptional! Modest but rich. The elements I was able to recognize where: sweet alcohol, prune, pineapple, banana and grapes. It has a wine like flair. It tastes as expected: well balanced, luxurious, but modest.

A: Hazy, golden yellow color with steady carbonation that is very hard to see through the murk. Very retentive off white, with very little lacing, just a few streaks. S: Very sweet, spicy and touch of medicinal like alcohol. Ripe fruit, sugars, the typical Unibroue yeastiness, along with some clove and pepper, but big on the sweet and spice (cinnamon, etc). T: Starts off a very sweet, spicy flavor up front and never really lets up as some more earthiness comes in and the carbonation hits you. Clove, pepper, banana, ripe fruit, yeast flavors all hit in the middle. Not much of an alcohol presence. The sweetness dominates, but is perfectly balanced by the spice. M: Like a Unibroue beer, you know what to expect, tons of carbonation over a medium body but still very smooth. Finish is very sweet and candy like. D: Easiest drinking Triple I've had.

The taste is initially a mix of tropical fruit with slight floral hints coming through. There is also the presence of cloves and other spices I can't put a finger on. The finish is a blend of yeast that is warmed very slightly by the alcohol.  The mouthfeel is light and pleasantly light and fizzy.  This is an amazing brew overall. Very complex smells and flavors are found with every sip. Even towards the end of the glass I struggle to connect what I am tasting to other tastes and smells so I'm just going to give up and simply say that this is an excellent example of a tripel that I would gladly have any time.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,julian,4.67,"A: hazy golden straw color. slightly cloudy. snow white 1 finger head, not overwhelming, just right! effervescence very noticeable. lacing only begins halfway down the glass but sticks nicely decorating the glass with some sticky white curtains.  S: strong fruity esters - somewhat citrusy mostly banana, smells bready. nice clove spicing balanced with the sweetness of the malt and casual yeasty tones. slight phenolic aroma lingers.  T: Definitely tastes like a Tripel and a fine example at that! The flavor really comes out just before that list sip is swallowed. Tastes like sweet banana biscuits seasoned with an array of spices. Slight citrus tones, malty yet not too sweet.  M: Similar to Unibroue's other offerings in that your mouth becomes a playground for this beer. There's something about their beers that just feels so right and so good in your mouth. Nice warming as it goes down...very clean and smooth...almost creamy.  D: Given the 9.0% ABV this one will knock you out fairly quickly if you're not paying attention. Incredibly flavorful, and incredibly dangerous. I'd be willing to risk it just to keep tasting it!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,hustlesworth,4.54,"A- possibly the most active head i've ever seen, it writhes around and twitches as if it were made of up millions of tiny living creatures, maybe maggots, but in a beautiful way, with a sound way louder than rice krispies could ever dream of. what was once a huge head settles quickly to a very lathered disk. the body is a barely translucent golden apricot color, i wish the head could have lasted longer. even after the foam is nothing but a thin ring, bubbles continue to rise along the edges and in a thick stream up the center, bulging up the brew like some volcanic vent far beneath the surface of a golden alien ocean, hissing and fizzing continuously. that for me, makes up for the quick dissipation.  S- very fruity and spicy aroma. a hint of clove, cardamom, grains of paradise, and other unknown exotic treasures from the far east. ripe pear, red apple, banana, mango, and melon with a lemon, orange & grapefruit peel citric tartness. every time i swirl my tulip, i'm presented with another level of bouquet, this time very floral white lilies and sweet orange blossom honey, all the while with underlying sweet clove and allspice, mace, and coriander. an absolutely fascinating aroma.  T- taste is no slouch either. this time the 'juicy' fruits are pushed toward the back and banana, clove, allspice, ginger, and white pepper, with a soft bubblegum taste fluttering around are in the spotlight. thickly sweet from the obvious use of candi sugar, the sheer fruitiness and spiciness of the yeasts alone keeps the sweetness in check, but near the end some grassy hops take the field and back up the spices. with such strong and complex yeast flavors, it's difficult to find any evidence of malt but for a soft pale grain taste well into the finish. letting the brew sit on my tongue for awhile reveals a the taste of the water used, fresh, stoney, and slightly metallic. profoundly complex with very nice overall flavor.  MF- juicy and viscous, candi sugar really lending a big hand to the body. tight prickling carbonation dances all over my mouth in a lively calliope of nearly musical bubbles. residual sugars still seem to take hold despite the cleansing effervescence.  D- overly drinkable, way to tasty and perfumey to even put the glass down, this could easily have me wandering toward the end of the earth and forgetting my way home. potent stuff, and the alcohol is extremely well hidden.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,soultrain19,4.68,Poured a beautiful cloudy pale gold. With a vigorous pour the head was hearty but dissipated quickly without any lace.  It has a strong floral bouquet highlighted with hints of citrus.  You could really taste the orange peel but it is balanced with a pleasant slightly sour aftertaste.  The light carbonation is very crisp and starts sharp on the tongue and slowly softens.  Overall an incredibly easy drinking beer. A beautiful mix of sweet and sour with that delightful crispness.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,generallee,4.87,"Presentation: It was poured from a 750ml bottle that is corked and caged into a chalice.  Appearance: It has a hazy body with a light golden amber color with a pale orange hue. The head is smooth, thick and creamy with good retention. It has a creamy off white color and it leaves behind soft lacing as it is slowly sipped down to the bottom of the glass.  Smell: The aroma is full and fruity. There is sweet orange citrus and spicy character with a big hit of yeast and tropical fruits like pineapple.  Taste/Mouth feel: It has a sweet rich and fruity malt and yeast flavor up front. Tropical fruit like pineapple and guava are noted. Soft spices come out and the alcohol starts to warm things up. Hops add a light citrus and leafy flavor before the yeast comes back out and turns powdery and slightly dry in the slow lingering finish. The texture is smooth and creamy with perfect carbonation for the medium body.  Notes: Outstanding and wonderfully complex with great drinkability.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,AMo,4.5,"Unibroue La Fin Du Monde pours a dense opaque peach with a short fuzzy head. The smell is medium to strong of yeast. I don't typically like yeasty beer, but this has a fabulously smooth and slightly sweet yeast like flavor. Mouthfeel is really good, sporting a silky smooth feel that changes into a very unique foam like character with a swish. Overall this was quite enjoyable the whole way through. A good standard for what a yeasty flavored beer should be.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Cyberkedi,4.02,"This pours a pretty golden-orange, fairly clear, not a lot of head. Aroma is malty with a strong hint of citrus. Flavor is strong and malty and has some hoppy hints. Finish is smooth and refreshing. This is an insidious beer, though, as you don't taste the alcohol, so it can sneak up on you.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,gunnerman,4.32,"Poured this into a tulip, pours a pale yellow in appearance with little bubbles of carbonation and a serious white head that leaves a bit of lace. You get the nice sweet smells of fruit and honey in the nose, this is a beer that has amazing aromas. Taste is differnt as it warms up, when its chilled its a sweet tangy tart of fresh ripe fruits with a bit of apple, pear, grapes, as this masterpiece warms the bread spice comes with a hint of a clean alcohol finish. I have to give it up for Unibroue they are an amazing brewary, they produce amazing products.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,elniko,4.58,"Poured into Stella glass  A: Absolutely beautiful brew, perfect golden amber hue. Two finger head than kept for a long while and then disappated but not all the way.  S: Smell is wonderful, I get a bit of floral and perhaps corriander.  T & M: If a friend who only drinks macros had only one beer to drink to be introduced to the world of craft beers this is the one I would pick. There is so much to the mouthful it is hard to place all the different flavors that are there. It is a truly amazing beer.  D: Heavens yes it is drinkable, it is 9% ABV but there is no hint of the high alcohol as I'm enjoying this truly superlative beer.  This beer truly stands atop the summit of all brews and should be tried by all beer drinkers once.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,PatrickJR,4.15,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into red wine glass.  A - Hazy golden, with a big 2 finger head that drops rather quickly to a collar, expected from the high alcohol content.  S - Overwhelming aroma of powdery yeast, riding a pale malt backbone. Semi-sweet vinous aroma in the background.  T - A simple but strong yeast flavor dominates early and mid palate, with some hints of apple/peach esters. Late palate reveals a spike of phenols, mostly from the alcohol but cleverly hidden by the grapey taste present in the nose. A sharp metallic taste begins the lingering and quite bitter finish.  M - The light body works well enough, but the high carbonation is bothering me a little. Not a bad compliment to the predominant yeast character, but still a bit much for me.  D - Not bad considering it's ABV. A little bitter and and pretty high on the yeast (which is a strong and strange-ish flavor to say the least), but I could definitely let a couple of these sneak up on me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ChrisCage,4.1,"A- This is the 1st tripel I've ever had and right off the bat, I'm impressed with the 750ml bottle, and the cork top plus wire that's holding it down. The cork popped once taken out, like a semi-sparkling wine...great so far. I soft poured on an angle into my glass and only filled about half way due to the impressive foamy white head that kept swelling. The coloring is a hazy amber/off orange with some noticable carbonation. This looks like a real winner!  S- This is very complex! First thing I noticed was a rich yeasty aroma, like fresh bread with melted butter on it. There's definately some baking spices in there as well, plus flowery alcohol aromas, some nuttiness, lots of malt and even some tropical fruits. Every whiff brings something different to the table on this one!  T- Again, many different flavors come to life in this. First thing that I notice is the spiciness of the beer. Reminds me somewhat of gingerbread cookies. I tasted the tropical fruits, and even some tart citrus notes. Once through these tastes, the maltiness of the brew comes to life, especially in the finish, along with some balanced hops and there is a heavy yeasty flavor that I detected. Great stuff!  M- I have to agree with a previous review in the fact that this beer seems to get a fuller body the more it is enjoyed. I noticed as I made my second pour that the consistancy was thicker than the first. The first half is much more bubbly and the second half is very creamy on the palate....I like it more the longer I'm drinking it.  D- I've decided that this is a very near perfect beer, but it is full bodied....that and the fact that I had 3/4 of a litre and I've had as much as I can handle for a night. This would definately be enjoyable with an old cheddar cheese. I recommend this beer for anyone who truly enjoys the finer brews in life and think this would be a great beer to celebrate with! With that said though, this beer is, in my opinion, a sipping beer and a single bottle would suffice for an entire evening.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ccrida,4.82,"355ml bottle poured into a goblet, La Fin Du Monde is a hazy strwa yellow with a large white head the is quickly settling and leaves no lace, the lightest smattering. I really like the color, but these beers are all about the head and 'brussels' lace.  Smell is pretty good, banana esters, cereal grains, a hint of caramel and metallic phenols as it warms.  Taste is fantastic - this is my favorite trippel. Big fruity esters, spicy backbone, very smooth, although it actually gets a tad boozy and grainy if you let it warm too much. Served at cellar temp though, perfect.  Mouthfeel is very carbonated, with a crisp, dry snappy finish. Highly digestible, this has a light body and is easy on the belly.  Drinkability is supreme for me, as good as it gets for the style. Big taste, but smooth and dangerously easy drinking...factor in the fact that Unibroue brews are such a great low price, this one should get a 5.5!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,AylwinForbes,4.4,"We were a bit put off by Unibroue at one stage by all the sort of fruit and veg weird beers we sampled at a tasting. That was a pity because it delayed an appreciation of what this place can do. What can I say that hasn't already been said in these many and several notes?  The most impressive thing about this very impressive beverage (which can hold a candle to a Tripel Karmeliet any day) is the aroma: beautifully complex, with phenolic, medicinal organic components and yeast and fruity malt. You definitely want to inhale before imbibing. On the palate you travel from initial sweetness to lingering slightly bitter end-notes. The beer has a lot of carbonation: it expresses in lively fashion from the bottle and continues the bead in the glass, but feels quite soft on the palate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Strix,4.5,"Cloudy golden with a big head  Smell is delicious and complex, a mix of fruits, and a bit of alcohol  Mmmm. Pineapple and banana with a bready base and crisp finish with a touch of alcohol. Complex, yet very enjoyable.  Mouthfeel substantial, compliments the taste nicely.  Very drinkable considering the abv. I'll be back to this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,atsprings,4.48,"750mL bottle into a Tripel Karmaliet glass. Pours a nice hazy straw yellow with a frothy head that is slow to diminish and leaves great lacing on the glass. The aroma is an amazingly fragrant blend of spice, yeast and sweet fruits. The taste is a wonderful blend of sweet fruits from the malts and citrus hops with a nice bit of spice to round things out. The beer is crisp and refreshing with some alcohol presence, but not 9% worth. This is a truly wonderful beer that is somewhat hard to believe was actually brewed in Belgium.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Taffle,4.87,"Flawless, hazy-orange pour. A frothy and rich white head holds respectable retention.  I hardly needed to hold my nose up to the head to catch the intensly sweet aromas. Very orange and citric with malty-rich hints of yeast.  Incredible flavor. I need not continue but I will. One of the best brews I have had the pleasure to enjoy. A subtle zestiness enriches the palate followed by a tangy, semi-sweet finish that represents the perfect tripel ale. Way too smooth going down - abv content masked unmercifully.  Carbonation was consistent and well balanced with the rest of the beer. Suprisingly lighter texture and feel than was expecting but in pleasing way.  Never had a tripel better than this one. Too easy to drink and so delicious, I cherished this glass of beer. On to the next Unibrue!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Has very nice balance, and the beer is interesting from start to finish. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. An excellent triple.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ibbjamin,3.69,"Paid $7.49 for an Australian Longneck from BevMo in Willow Glen, CA. Poured into a pint glass with a couple pours.  This is a nice beer to open. Has a decorative yet functional metal fastener holding the cork down. The cork pops when opening, almost like a bottle of champagne. That should have been my first sign of the amount of carbonation in this one. After a soft pour, half of the pint was a white head made of huge bubbles. Has the color of a cloudy yellow wheat beer. The head doesn't shrink down too quickly at all. Thick creamy trails of lacing.  The nose is yeast first and foremost, but there is also hints of alcohol and sweeter malts with some spice. The carbonation can even be slightly detected in the nose.  Taste is nice, refreshing and complex. Yeast and bread at first; similarities to both a hefe or wheat beer but unique in its own manner. The yeast is then balanced with the sweeter malts and floral perfume hops which combine for a nice mild fruity flavor. Alcohol taste is present as well.  Creamy, light to medium body. Not as carbonated of a mouthfeel as I originally anticipated to this point.  Tripels usually are not my beverage of choice, so drinkability is affected, but it the best Tripel I've had to date. Highly recommended for this style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ZorPrime,4.31,"I've decided to taste this beer after reading that it won the World of Beer Gold medal in 2008.  One word, awesome.  This beer has everything right! Color, smell, taste and aftertaste! I've taste La Fin du Monde from a 750 ml bottle. Was a little bit scared that I wouldn't like it and if that was the case, 750 ml was simply too much. It turns out that 750 ml was not enough.  Definitely a regular buy for me since it is sold in small shop everywhere here.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

So, my French sucks...sorry.  750 ml cork-in-cage bottle with 'best before date' 12-18-10, opened with a confident pop! and poured gently into a chalice yields a bright hazy blonde body decorated with a steady wave of Champagne-style bubbles and a white head of 2 fingers that retains at a half-finger and laces the glass nicely.  Smell is spicy and savory, with light caramel malts and a slightly acidy citrus character. Rich and soul-lifting.  Tastes sweetly malty, balanced with tartness, dry yeast and a touch of orange and hot pepper. Wonderfully bready, then banana and sweet pineapple flavors kick in, making this sub-Arctic Canadian masterwork seem exotic and tropical.  Tingling carbonation that cuts the sweet malty profile to perfect drinkability and releases even more flavors. Juicy fresh fruits and mild nuttiness grow as the drink warms. Slick, silky, outstanding.  No trace of the potent alcohol, pas de tout, in this beer I find simply magnificent. My first Unibroue offering, too. Extremely impressed. Outstanding. Awesome. Kickass. Irony in the circumstances in my and the previous poster's review :)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Dodo2step,4.55,My 100th review and it is a doozy!  P- my buddy in Va Beach brought this up to me from Grape and Gourmet store.  A- Pours a crisp opaque apricot with tints of yellow. A lot of yeast rising and makes a mini-tornadoe in my beer. A nice 4 finger head overflows my pint glass.  S- A nice aroma triple. Apple spice and faint hints of banana. Faint citrus but more on the floral spice side. Yeasty and malty as well. Faint hints of alcohol round it off.  T- I can taste the banana more in the taste than i could in the smell. The banana flavor really comes out after a few sips and is a nice compliment to the floral.  M- thick and viscous and alcohol premeates my mouth. Alcohol is really prominent as the aftertaste.  D- A sipper beer and very strong. A six pack of this would be hard to put down. Two of these and i would be 'golden' for the night. a very nice triple with good flavor.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Has an almost three finger head of fizzy champagne-like bubbles that fades to leave just a thin layer on top.  The aroma of sweet, fruity goodness dominates the nose. There is a little alcohol and just a hint of piney citrus as well. The taste is of citrus and a little banana.  The mouthfeel is very smooth, and despite its sweetness, it's not cloying at all. There is a very noticeable alcohol warmth to it, but in a good way. I would definitely have another.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Cloudy, pale golden-orange color; overall gives the appearance of a newly opened champagne. Very nice. Smells of a sweet/sour combination fermented yeast and cirtus with a breaded overnote. Rich flavors of yeast, orange citrus and spiciness. Hop character is strong, which balances the yeast. Dry and astringent finish. Dry yeast finish on the carbonation tip and hoppiness leave a tingling mouthfeel, vibrating off the middle of the tongue.

Taste: There's some alcohol in the finish on this one and it tends to linger, but it is not unpleasant in any way. Slightly sweet/fruity (bananas came to mind), some spices.  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated, goes down easy and leaves the mouth feeling refreshed.  Drinkability: This one is quite drinkable, it is refreshing and tasty.

An amalgam of various fruits and the slightest hint of booze in the nose. Delightful pear, apple and banana notes come to the fore with the first sip, along with a bready/yeasty goodness. Taste finishes with a sparing tinge of herb. Medium viscosity gives this beer a very interesting feel...has a light creaminess to it that perfectly matches its other characteristics. 9% you say?

Head lasts extremely well but its lacing is a bit disappointing.  S - Very floral and spicy with a complex nose. Powdery with really no distinguishable alcohol. Mildly sweet and maybe a hint of banana.  T - Starts with a tart, banana sweetness that soon expresses many floral attributes. Spice is strong with some clove and orange zest flavors. No sign of alcohol, making this a well-disguised beer (9% ABV).  M - Nice carbonation at the start, but it becomes a bit chalky on the tongue, even in the aftertaste. No perceptible bitterness.

I love this beer, even the packaging is beautiful. But when it hits the glass it looks like liquid gold. Slightly hazy with a pillowy white top that slowly drops down leaving sticky patches all over the glass, it begs to be enjoyed. The smell is fruity, like overripe peaches, and just a little boozy. The taste is sweet nectar. Light and fruity to open, given way to a slight yeasty flavor, while the great carbonation keeps it crisp. The alcohol is very well hidden, just an afterthought of the sip.

Bananas really come across but they are not overly sweet. Hops bring a bitterness nd are balanced with the spices.  M: Has a pretty good amount of carbonation and makes this beer very refreshing.

Glowing pale yellow color with swirls of tiny yeast clouds and a dense rocky white head. Great floral nose with a slight spicy character. The flavor is rich but light, and the alcohol isn't as punchy as you might expect for a beer with 9% alcohol.  This one also works great in cooking.

The color was school bus yellow. The smell was spicy and bready. Taste-wise, what a knock out. It's everything you could ask for in a tripel. Light, full of body and flavor, very drinkable yet just enough alcohol punch to let you know that you are drinking a quality beer.

It has a strong sweet aroma with lots a citrus smells like lemons and oranges. It has a good semi crisp feel on the tip of your tongue, it smooth overall with a medium body and leaves a faint hint a residue in your mouth.

Smell is a little sweet, floral, a bit fruity, a lot of badass, with some spice, overall very complex  Taste is near perfect, a combination of sweetness, some floral flavours, some spice, and a bit of a yeast flavor that all blend extremely well together. Mouthfeel is really nice, very smooth despite the 9abv which is detectable if you look for it.  Drinkability? Please this stuff is so awesome i want to take it to class with me. Give me a case of it and it'll be gone in 2 days.  This is one of the best tripels out there, I'll dropkick anyone who disagrees with me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,gavmeconi,4.5,"One of my favourite beers out there. If you're looking for something new and good, try this. It's a bit more expensive than the regualar case of beer by a few dollars but will be well worth it. It is one of those beers that after tasting it, none others are ever as good and will be constantly compared to it. It is the perfect drink to have with some good food or just alone in a nice setting. One of the most incredible things about it, is that it has such a great taste that it actually masks the 9% abv and will leave you wanting more all night. It also looks nice and has a nice feeling on the tongue. Cannot go wrong with this. The only problem with it is finding it sometimes in stores.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,DrainBamage,3.36,"Pours a copperish color with massive two inch head. Smell is heavy in phenol aromas with some maltiness too. Goes down extremely smooth with pure maltiness here.Taste is extremely complex with malts, phenols, and yeasty flavors all balanced. Overall this a decent triple, which is saying a lot since I don't care much for triples.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,cswhitehorse,4.38,"The La Fin Du Monde poured a hazy orange with a solid finger head with a tight pillow formation. There was minimal lacing.  The aroma was really yeasty, fruity, spicy and of bananas.  The taste was again yeasty and spiciness which could not be named. In the mouth there was a bitterness on the finish which was nice. It was moderately to highly carbonated. One of the best Tripel's to date.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Portertime,4.4,"This was the first micro brew I ever tried. It was at a coffee house in Orlando. This beer single handedly got me into the love of fine beers. Thank you Unibrau! Poured a cloudy goldish color with a nice head. Smelled heavenly with a mixture of raisons, candied fruit, apples, and dried apricots. Taste was spectacular with upfront fruit and spice and mild floral hop undertones. I just sipped away at this beer and listened to some great rifs on my friend's acoustic guitar.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,argock,4.5,"Poured from 750mL brown bottle into an oversized red wine glass.  A: Inviting hazy golden color with nearly white head that disappates quickly with a thin rim of bubbles.  S: Sweet fruit and prominent yeast aromas and mellow spices with faint alcoholic/phenolic smell.  T: Smooth and dangerous as this does not drink like a 9% ABV beer. Delicious light, sweet flavors of pear, apricot, banana, and citrus blend with smooth yeasty, bready with a subtle blend of spices for a great overall taste.  M: Smooth with no alcohol detectable and a very mild fruity, clean aftertaste.  D: Probably the most drinkable tripel around because of the soft, balanced blend of fruit and malty flavors that is not too sweet but come together exceptionally well.  Cellared review: 2009 La Fin Du Monde (best by date 1/28/12) Super smooth with toned down alcohol and delicious pear, peach, and apple flavors, crisp herbal hops, and light fruity yeast. The vegetal flavors that occasionally sneak in with this brew are nowhere to be found. This beer is drinking excellently right now and it's hard to believe it will improve much more. Probably my favorite tripel, and I have been drinking a lot of Belgians (somewhat fresher but still with some time on them) lately.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Smell is exceptional. smashed fruits, alcohol soaked breads, malts, citrus, fresh cut grass and cedar. I could go on of about the complexity of this beer in terms of smell and taste very good. Taste is flowers fresh cut herbs very earthy in many aspects. Very drinkable the flavor of this beer hides much of the alcohol tones. Top ten beers of all time in my opinion simply beautiful.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Neehan,4.7,"Wow. A truly remarkable beer in many ways. It pours your typical, slightly evervescent yet appealing pale body, and great lacing. The smell is malty, but sweeter than most of the style. From here, it only gets better with incredibly smooth complexity and a mouthfeel that has a great substance and presence but yet light with a cloud-like presence. Simply put, the most drinkable Tripel I've had. Exceptional.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,MyGoodness,3.94,"Tried this one at an informal tasting my friends and I threw ourselves. This was one of the highlights for most of those attending. Pours a nice deep honey colour, a little cloudy, with moderate head and lacing. The smell was warm and fruity with some strong spicy notes (even though it's not a heavy, wintry beer, the smell reminds me of X-mas timea bit). Mouthfeel was appropriately fizzy for a fruit flavoured drink, IMO. The taste borders on being sweet, but the spices stop it before it becomes too much. To me, to be perfectly honest, it doesn't really taste like my conception of what a beer should be; I'm not sure why exactly. Some of the people I was with declared it their favourite of the evening; I don't agree with this, but it was a fine beverage nonetheless.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ClashmoreMike,4.67,"Poured out of a bottle with a ""best before"" date of 08-22-10, into a Riedel Vinum burgundy glass.  A = Nice light orange color. A little cloudiness. Lots of tiny carbonation bubbles rising (like in a champagne). One finger of white head. Goes down to thin, but solid, head that lasts throughout. Some lacing.  S = Very fruity, sweet smell. Some mango, some apple, a little bit of bananas. Some clove in there. Yeast and spiciness that become more pronounced as the beer warms up.  T = Like the smell (see above), but the fruitiness becomes a little less sweet, and little more tart (but not too tart at all). Nice hop bitterness and peppery spiciness in the finish. Hides the alcohol very well.  M = More carbonation than I was expecting. Not overwhelming, but it's definitely there. Becomes very (dangerously) smooth as the beer warms. Medium body.  D= Really enjoyed this one. Just great, balanced complexity. Lots of things going on, and they all fit very well. Doesn't feel too heavy, and the alcohol is well hidden (until you stand up), so there's definitely a danger of having too many of these.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,joezak5,4.42,Appearance: Poured into a Duvel sniffter; dusty and hazy rich gold; I poured out all the yeast. Huge off white head with a steady stream of bubbles up the center.  Smell: Apples and citusy spice and yeast.  Mouthfeel: Light and crisp with champagne like carbonation.  Taste: Peppery and citrusy yeasty cloves. Yeasty and wheaty. Amazing.  Drinkability: One of my favorites. Delicately complex yet easily enjoyed. The alcohol is buried and always leaves you wanting more.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,KeefD,4.38,"Best before date of 10-04-08. From a variety 8-pack. Opened and let stand for 5 minutes. Foam was seeping from the neck of the bottle in less than 3 minutes. Poured from a 12oz bottle into an imperial pint glass - very slowly. Despite the slowest possible pour in the universe, the head on this beer was incredible.  Poured a hazy golden yellow color, with moderate haze from the small amount of refermentation yeast that made its way into the glass. Beautiful 2 inch head, innumerable amounts of carbonation bubbles keeping tight head retention. Lacing was strong at first but slowly dissipated. Not disappointed though.  Wonderful malty smells with just the right amount of hops. Strong floral and citrus scents - especially grapefruit and maybe some pineapple.  What a taste! It's hard to describe the complexity of this beer. It's almost like a cross between the best Belgian Tripel you've ever tasted with a good wheat beer, with tons of flavor coming from the malts and the yeast. Perhaps the yeast is what gives it that wheat ale flavor with the smoothness and richness of a Tripel. Slight spiciness from the lurking alcohol.  Carbonation is perfect. Completely full bodied and wonderfully mouthwatering. Rich, not too sweet, but the flavor of the best Belgiums this side of the Atlantic.  Love this beer. LOVE IT. ABV is on the higher side, so more than a few of these at a time is not recommended. It should be savored.... One at a time. It's pricey, so enjoy it with care!  Best beer I've had in ages. A+ to the French Canadians.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S: ripe fruit (apple, citrus, raisin, plum), floral hops, spice and a bit of cotton candy sweetness.  T: wonderfully round and quite complex. spicy and hoppy up front, fruity through mid sip and a sugary sweetness on the finish. Then, on the linger, the spice comes back in full force.  M: medium bodied, creamy, quite crisp and very spicy - a bit oily on the finish due to the sugar.  D: this beer packs quite a potent punch (more so because of its spiciness than its alcohol - the 9% ABV is very well hidden, making it quite drinkable. Good complexity and it ignites all the senses - very satisfying. I look forward to another one soon.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

While I found the beer drinkable and tasty, it did not live up to the hype. My cost was $8.69 for a 4 pack. I didn't find it that much better than the Blue Moon I followed this beer with, and the Blue Moon was cheaper. Sure if you count the alchohol level is almost twice the level of a standard beer you are getting more for the money, but I'm not drinking them to get tanked...

Sweet malt-derived start, estery banana and spicy yeast chiming in. Some fruitiness as well, though indistinct. A smooth finish, nothing new going on, just a sweet, barely detectable abv warmth. For 9%, this beer hides it well.  Mouthfeel - very bubbly and champagne-like. Light body.

A-more yellow than golden, very bubbly, even 10 minutes after pour  S-all i get is faint orangey/lemony smell tinged with iron  T-Meh....Taste like iron with a modest belgian sweetness. I'd rather have the waffle. Surprisingly not astringent or alcoholy. Similiar in taste to a sparking white grape juice.  D- I must give praise on this category. For a 9% beer, it's one of the smoothest and easiest to drink I've had. Take that Miller or Coors Light.  In closing, I give this a whopping MEH. I think Trader Joe's Vintage '07 beats the shit out of this beer, and costs less.  It's so bubbly, you almost think this is more a mid-morning than evening drink. When I crave something bubbly and sweet, I'm almost more tempted just to buy some sparkling cider, which is basically in the same genus as this beer.

The taste was the best part and it tasted almost as it smelled. It was fruity, clove like with a strong kick of alcohol and constantly reminds one that it must be respected. The feel has very medium carbonation and goes down as smooth as a Brew of this strength can. The Malts provide excellent balance to this superior brew.

Bubbles die out fairly quickly, but the fact that this glass was poured from a six year old bottle makes it remarkable anyway.  Aroma is powdery and sweet; yeast and spices. Floral and esthery.  Flavor is moderate: herbal (sage?), light spice (white pepper?) and sweet with notable but not overpowering bitterness on the finish. Dry after each taste. Slight alcohol warmth - maybe the ABV went up a little over the years?  Mouthfeel is right down the middle - still and neither thin nor thick.  Far more drinkable than I would have guessed from a six year old vintage, this wipes away bad memories of the last time I had this beer (see below)... ___ EARLIER REVIEW:  Bottle labeled,""best before 05-10-10"", consumed 02/14/08.  Cork popped with a great deal of energy, ricocheting around the room! Beer pours a golden yellow with a full, mernegue-like three finger head that slowly fades. Lots of carbonation. Aroma is somewhat off, with a nasty metallic tang being the dominant note. Some yeasty spice underneath. Metallic flavor carries over to beer. Dreadful! A little peppery spiciness and some lemongrass and sweetness lurked behind the relatively huge rusted metal flavor. Some parching dryness on the tongue.  Something must have gone wrong here, as I have had this before and it was a fine brew. This bottle, however, is a dumper. Until I have another to re-rate, this rating reflects this bottle.

S: Smells of yeast, white pepper, lemon and orange zest, and cleaning solutions.  T: The taste is sweet, sharp and biting upfront, with a stringent citurs zest and a clear bust of ethyl alcohol. Other fruits such as banana and nectarine mix with complex alcoholic sugars and malts to create this fine brew.  M: Mouthfeel is light, crisp and sharp to the tongue.

There is a bit of apple and spice on top of the malt.  T: Good spice right up front with a touch of apple. Fairly sweet overall and rather tasty.  M: Great body. Nice and thick but still refreshing. It doesn't sit heavy on the tongue.  D: Pretty textbook tripel but not quite as good as the Belgian types. Probably the best from this side of the atlantic.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,biggmike,4.67,Pours an attractive orange/golden color with beautiful white head that stayed for a while. Aroma is of fruit and is sweet. The flavor is sweet and fruity up front that gives way to a peppery spiciness. Mouthfeel is good and the 9%alcohol is not evident until this beer is consumed. A really nice beer that is meant to be savored.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Med,3.51,"750 ml bottle. ""Best before 9-17-10"" poured in a chalice.  A - Poured a nice 2 finger head pure white against the tan beer. Slightly cloudy but very uniform. Unfortunately the head didn't stay well. Lacing was nice!  S - Dusty/musky aroma masks subtle fruit underneath. not entirely pleasant, but not terrible.  T - Taste is surprisingly clean and well balanced after the disappointing aroma. Less sweet than many triples with a medium finish. Doesn't like being too cold, though.  M - Creamy and full bodied. A little more carbonation than I expected, but pleasantly so.  D - Nice triple. I would happily have another but I'm not wishing there was another here.  I'll put some of these down in the cellar. I think it will mature nicely.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Taste - Strong, both fruity and spicy. The complexity is quite amazing.  Mouthfeel - Great aftertaste, pretty good otherwise.  Drinkability - High alcohol, but still easy to drink.  Overall - Very popular among us craft drinkers, and deservedly so.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,csmiley,4.32,A - Pours pale gold in color and looks just a little cloudy. Pretty generous white head with good retention. Lacing was average.  S - Aroma is nice starting with banana and spices. Lighter smells include alcohol and yeast. All of these play off each other making for a good smelling brew.  T - Taste is very spicy. Reminds me of pepper. Also get banana pretty strong in the flavor too. Background flavors would be yeast and sugar. On the end there is a slight amount of hop bitterness.  M - Medium bodied with carbonation levels that are right on target for my taste. Slightly dry finish.  D - A very good brew from Unibroue. Drinkability is high. I will be having this one again in the near future.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,MrHungryMonkey,4.45,"Apricot color, not quite clear, good little head.  Tangy and spicy with a little malt in between there somewhere.  My mouth is attacked with flavor. Intense sweetness and crystal clean alcohol sharpness suggest candi sugar. A less intense maltiness provides a mouth-watering backdrop. Then there's this crazy twang, it is a lot like citrus fruit, or maybe herbal like gin. All the meanwhile the carbonation knocks your socks off. How cool. It just tastes soo good that I want to constantly sip it for the rest of my life. It's these few moments in life where we stumble into a groove of heaven that keep us going through the rest of the crap we put up with. The hope that I can experience the magnitude of orgasmic pleasure this one beer can give me is enough to keep me going for a while, seeking my next transcendental moment.

S= This one smells of alcohol, sweetness, funky yeast, bread, and a bit of fruit.  T= The taste of this beer is outstanding. In my opinion, all that is good in Belgian trippels is represented here. There is that excellently high abv, the funky/fruity yeast flavors and a hint of hard candy sweetness.  MF= The carbonation on this one is just right. Not overflowing with foaminess, but not a low carbonation beer either. It continues to release carbonation throughout.  D= This is my favorite beer from one of my newest favorite breweries. I consider it one of my ""staple"" beers and highly recommend it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,GilGarp,4.51,"As a big fan of tripels, I was excited to try ""the best"" according to BA.  The bottle is a 750ml with a champagne cork. It pops gently and pours out with a full white head that goes away slowly. It has a beautiful cloudy golden color.  The taste is exactly what you expect in a tripel with fresh fruit, spice, and a hint of banana. As is common for this style, the carbonation is a little strong making it a little difficult to drink. It's best sipped at 50 degrees or so.  It's an impressive beer to be coming out of Canada, in the sense that it isn't from Belgium! I look forward to trying other beers from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,pwoods,3.68,"12oz. brown bottle, silver foil cap, purchased at Party Source, poured into a snifter. Undistinguishable dating on the side.  A: Pours a bright, glowing golden orange with plenty of hazing. 1/2 inch of pearly white head forms and has average retention. Not much lacing.  S: Very spicy and yeasty. Plenty of crisp green fruits.. green apples, green grapes, some lime zest along with some banana and clove.  T/M: Very spicy and yeasty, again. I think the yeast is a bit too powerful for my liking. The yeast adds all kinds of fruit and a hop presence backs it up with a strong citrus side and a touch of bitterness. Malts are extremely sweet. Alcohol adds to the spice with a bit of a nip but not nearly as much as you'd expect from a 9% brew. Body is light and crisp and carbonation is abundant.  D: My tastes have definitely matured. 6 months ago I can say without a doubt that I would have hated this. It's still not my favorite but I can definitely appreciate it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,deapokid,4.08,"It's truly amazing how closely this Canadian tripel resembles its Belgian brothers. Packing a sugary sweet aroma with a sultry blend of yeast and fruit notes, this ale pours out in a fog of thick orange color and heavy white foam. It visibly resembles Circus Boy or Blue Moon, but, its complexity of flavor puts any similarities to bed. Tantalizing the tongue with notes of banana, plum and Irish soda bread, La Fin is so exceptionally drinkable and tasty that it's easy to forgot that it sours a bit towards the end of the glass. Yet, for the first 3/4 of a pint, this is an almost perfect replication of Belgian's finest ales.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,CWiggins,3.72,"Will the head on this brew ever die?!? The thick, white foam that formed on this pouring of La Fin du Monde remained practically intact until the last sip was consumed! One has to peek underneath to examine the cloudy orange hue of this Canadian beer. The aroma is slightly underwhelming, but notes of spices and citrus are noticeable. Aspects of wheat are also (interestingly) present. The taste is light but complex: there are flavors of bright citrus and lighter malts-darker malt characteristics are present during the lingering aftertaste. What kills me the is smoothness of the mouthfeel; all the carbonation must be in the head! It nearly drinks like water, which is dangerous from a calorie/alcohol perspective.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,lightindarkness,4.13,"Thanks to Wasatch for this extra!  Pours a hazy golden orange-yellow with a big frothy off-white head. Smells of grains and tart fruits. Citrusy nose deepens with complex spice notes. Taste is herbal and fruity, with a light crispness flavored with spice and yeasty fruitiness. Very clean taste, lightly sweet, full flavored yet mild. Fruits decay to a nice yeasty aftertaste. Medium body and smooth on the palate. Soft full carbonation lends a creamy, slightly crisp feel. I'm a little scared of how drinkable this is. Watch out for the 9%abv. Overall a great tasting very drinkable version of the style. Not too strong in any sense of taste or smell.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Bobzilla,4.92,"Again, for a non-Belgian beer, Unibroue seems to have the style down. A nice golden yellow color, with white lacy head. The lace lingered on in patches down the glass throughout drinking. ""On lees"", but if poured slowly, it is crystal clear. The smell was comprable to Cantillon Iris, with less grapefruit and more subtle hints of the Belgian yeast strains. Has the Unibroue nose that is found in almost all their beers. Compared to the Cantillon, it actually is a bit more pleasant to smell, as it is not overpowering on the first whiff. Hints of coriander and orange cut through the crispness of the beer. A light tartness, but the malt/sugar content cuts smooths it out, creating a nice blend. The motuhfeel can be a bit crisp or light, but not so much as to be distracting. At 9%ABV, its still a very drinkable beer. It is not heavy, and I don't really ever feel like I'm filling up when having it. A wonderful Tripel that holds up to any other of the style that I've had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Durge,3.63,"Very cloudy light tan with big white head and big lace. Sour hop aroma with crisp yeasty wheat. Sour tart lemon wheat flavor.

22,34,manleyphoto,4.72,"There are not too many Canadian products that evoke a strong brand following here in America, but it's time we made Unibroue a household name. La Fin Du Monde is ""the end of the world"" in French but what it really means is that you should go to the end of the world, if necessary, to pick some of this up. Luckily for us, Unibroue is distributed widely in our market, and therefore available just around the corner. This is one of the many beers I keep coming back to, time and time again. I miss it if it's been awhile, and feel like I need to welcome it back into my home. La Fin Du Monde is in the Belgian strong-triple style and is liquid gold, literally. The beer pours a hazy beautiful golden, with a full billowy head of white foam. What makes La Fin Du Monde exceptional amongst its North American counterparts is the full sweet-tart peppery smell, and monster yeasty, bready, and fruity flavor. Like many traditional Belgian-style breweries, Unibroue uses proprietary house yeast for its beers that add a unique character, and their yeast seems to leave this typically dry style on the sweet end of the spectrum with a massive pronounced complexity of flavors. This beer is bottle conditioned, meaning a small amount of yeast is left in the bottle to carbonate and mellow out the beer, enhancing the full flavors of the drink. Drinking most of this French-Canadian breweries beer is an experience that I can't recommend enough, and La Fin Du Monde is a brilliant example of their craft and skill. If this is the end of the world, then I really do feel fine.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,GRPunk,4.31,"Bottle poured into a tulip glass.  A- The hazy golden/orange/yellow beer poured with a 2-1/2 finger fluffy white head. Bubbles of carbonation struggled through. As a drank, the head left nice fluffy, sticky rings along the side of the glass.  S- The aroma was a nice combonation of spice and citrus fruit.  T- The flavor was a great example of the style. There were more spicy and fruity flavors along with a yeasty presence and hints of alcohol.  M- It had a nice full feel. It was a little grainy, but in a good way. The alcohol flavor warmed my mouth.  D- The full flavor and smooth feel made drinking easy.  Overall- It's a great example of the style.

22,34,IPAcraig,4.8,"One of my absolute favorite beers. I am surprised I havent reviewed this one until now.  Poured into my St Bernardus Goblet. This beer looks very similar to its cousin, Don De Dieu. It pours a hazzy, medium gold, with a bright white, creamy head.  The trademark unibroue yeast is apparent from the first sniff. Apricots and earth dominate the nose.  This beer starts off semi-sweet and fruity; pears and apricots. Despite the apparent malt sweetness, this beer manages to feel fairly light and dry. A bit of grain in the finish with the tiniest amount of alcohol. This beer is amazing. To me it is a traditional Tripel, with super-charged yeast. The taste is uniquely Unibroue.  There are few beers a drinkable as this one. You barely notice that it is 9%. A true Gem, and a regular beer at this house.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ommegoose,4.35,"Purchased at Evanston 1st Liquors for $6.29. Expiration date of 9/17/10.  Pours from a 750 ml bottle into a St. Bernardus goblet (yes, I need to get a tulip soon) with a very light head of large white fizzy bubbles that recede rather quickly, even after an aggressive pour, to a thin layer on the top. Color is a dull, opaque goldenrod. I like the color of a few other tripels better, but this is a trivial point. It looks like it will taste very good. A few thin streams of tiny bubbles rise up. After pouring the yeast into the final glass, the color becomes more peachy orange, and the head retention improves.  The nose is fruity and yeasty. Peaches and apricots, ripe red apples. Spices take a backseat; clove is the only one I can pick out for now. The intensity increases in the last pour, with extra herbal/spicy notes. The best of the style are more complex than this.  A lot of the (over)ripe red apple carries into the flavor inside of grainy malts, dominating the sour part of the palate. The spices kick in at the back of the tongue, with clove and pepper being prominent. The finish is mostly spices and earthy yeastiness. The yeast certainly gives away that this is a Unibroue production. The slightest bit of hops come through here, as does more apple and light fruit, namely apricot. Actually finishes a lot like a witbier, but a little bigger and sweeter. I am surprised at how much apple dominates the taste here. I was looking for more sweetness on the palate, but I thought the little bit of orange and apricot that showed up was too easily overpowered by the rest of the flavor profile. No drastic changes after the yeast has been poured, maybe less apple, and more of the light fruits. (This was a close call between a 4.0 and a 4.5, but I gave it the bump up since tripel is one of my favorite styles, and I can't see rating that many beers this high or higher.)  Mouthfeel is soft. The carbonation is just about spot on. The high alcohol content tickles the tongue for the first sip or two, but that's nothing to get too worked up about. Leaves a pleasant tingling on the tongue, and warms going down. Does a good job of avoiding the roughness that often comes with wheaty beers.  This beer is a pleasure to drink. It gets a little hard to finish the entire 750 ml at the end, but I won't take off for that. One or two at a bar would not pose this problem. The alcohol is well integrated, but present enough for me to make sure that I'm pacing myself.  This is not my favorite tripel, but it's certainly no slouch. And at a much better price than a few others, I will certainly visit it again.  PS: After having 200+ beers, I figure I'm qualified enough to start reviewing. I definitely picked a winner to start with.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

T: The initial flavor was spicy and fruity (pineapples, pears) with a light smokiness. Tart oranges, bananas, light bubblegum notes stand out. There were also some fresh apples, and mangos adding to the complexity in the finish rounding things out. Incredibly complex and fruity with a lively carbonation that brings out the full aroma and flavor  M: The mouthful was full of fresh oranges, spicy hoppiness and a lively carbonation bite.  D: Drinkability was incredibly good, with a vast complexity of fruitiness from the yeast. The 9.0% abv was hardly noticeable as this beer drank like a dream.

A nice, somewhat complex blend of flavours all very nicely balanced with one another. Finishes a little peppery, with the warming alcohol on the way down.  M + D: Somewhat expressive, with a good zip of carbonation... and crisp. A medium body on there that makes for an easier drink.

22,34,ElGrecoVerde,4.59,"Pours a murky brownish orange with a massive head.  The amount of aromas is almost overwhelming, but perfectly blended. Each time, you notice something else. Maybe it's the floral scents, maybe the orange peels, or maybe the sour apples. Whatever it is, it's always great.  The taste, like the smell, is loaded with flavors that all work together to make a great tasting beer. Incredible. I mainly noticed the same orange peel and sour apple tastes from before, with spices and rinds blended in. The sourness gets a bit heavy, but that's about the only flaw.  The yeast gives it a thick, almost chewy quality. Wow, this beer doesn't allow any of your senses to take a nap. It finishes dry, at least much dryer than anticipated. This is probably the result of great carbonation and a high alcohol content that you'd forget was even there if you didn't start feeling it.

This pours a rich golden color with two full fingers of white head, very sharp. The smell is fine, but insufficient for me. Lots of fruit and yeast, but not strong on the nose. The taste is not surprisingly delicious, smooth, full of fruit flavor, with the yeast never off the radar. I was hoping for a bit more effervescence with the mouthfeel, but beggars and choosers...still very good, and easy to consume.  I rated this somewhat lower than other Unibroue beers I've had not because it's somehow worse, but rather because it lacks some of the bolder character that its compatriots from Unibroue has.

The taste synch's with the smell nicely. Belgian candy sugar sweetness is light in comparison to tart green apples, pears, and lemony citrus. Bread-like maltiness continues to fill the body, and yeasty, light pepper spiciness closes this one out. Medium bodied with loads of fresh carbonation lead to a bubbly, yet creamy mouthfeel. This is my first--and a quite good offering--from Unibroue.

The finish is a little cloying, and the body is a little to full for a tripel. A Belgian brewer will say it is to filling, and I would agree. Not sure why the change, this has been a great beer, and it still is good, just not as good as before.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,AKBelgianBeast,4.4,"Cellared for 6 months prior to consumption.  Pours a beautiful clear, crisp yellow with great carbonation and a nice head that dissipates quickly. The nose is of wheat, pepper, belgian yeast and light fruit/appley. Taste follows the nose, great yeast and wheat flavor with a creamy sort of pepper taste. Apple or other light fruit hints on the finish, slight(very) sourness, possibly from cellaring. great triple, and one that deserves alot of respect. Not my favorite (love my westmalle) but close to the top.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,dsa7783,4.4,"What can I say? Every beer produced from Unibroue is certainly world-class and some of the best... This is another definite winner... Although this might be categorized as a ""Tripel""... I would more consider this as something as a ""super witbier"" and a step-up from their Blanche de Chambly... Pours a hazy, cloudy, yellow, straw-color with a decent frothy head... aroma is all fruits, with lemon, coriander, and citrus pouring through... taste is super-rich, thick, and creamy, and strongly complements the aroma with its fruit-like characteristic dominated by light, cloudy overtones... one of the better beers out there... every beer that I've sampled from Unibroue has been above and beyond and this one fails to disappoint... a definite must-try... Certainly recommended...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,t0rin0,4.15,"This came from a 750 ml from bevmo, so not sure how old it actually is. It poured a nice dark golden color and was hazy. It also had a large white head that dissipated and left nothing behind. The aroma was mostly of orangey citrus. There was of course a little bit of yeast in the smell too. The flavor was very sweet and pleasant but on the verge of being too sweet. There was some complexity in the taste but I couldn't tell what all was in there. The mouthfeel was carbonated and light, which is nice for a tripel.  I think its a very enjoyable beer but the sweetness takes away from its credibility a little.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,avalon07,4.8,"La Fin du Monde is one of the first real Canadian beers I've had (I exclude Molson's and Labatt's on general principle). The appearance is an amber-brown, with a slightly opaque quality. The smell is pretty citrusy, though it doesn't overwhelm you. The taste is where this one shines. It gives you hints of apple and other fruits, along with a yeast flavor. The mouthfeel is very lively - some might say a little bit too lively - giving off a highly carbonated texture. Overall, this is an excellent beer and highly drinkable. It's something one could easily latch onto.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,RedBeerHead,4.47,"Pours a cloudy bright gold with a highly carbonated one inch head. Smells like flowers. There is also a sweet citrus smell. The taste is very sophisticated and very complex. Again there is a sweet citrus taste. It's very light in the mouth despite the heavy yeasty (&lt;- not a word, but it should be) appearance.  I'm not giving this a 5 and I think I should explain why. I find that this beer, as good as it is, is too sweet. A little more bitter aftertaste and a little less sweet citrus flavor would move this beer closer to perfection.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,stephens101,4.4,"Pours a cloudy golden orange and topped off with a magnificent white head that fades eloquently with a small thin fluff left on top. Smells robust and complex with oranges, apples, bananas and spice. Some yeast mingles and a second takes reveals some furtive butterscotch. Tastes of apricots mixed with some breadiness. There's a tinge of alcohol heat left in the throat which lets you know what you're drinking. I like this, and would not change it. Mouth-feel is medium-bodied yet quite drinkable. This is a fulfilling sipper that will keep you begging for more.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Micahman,4.85,"A. Beautiful golden apricot, cascades of carbonation lasting through the drink.  S. Crisp golden apples, some notes of nutmeg, fig, and ripe apricot. Bit of yeast.  T. Fruitiness of apple, apricot, and fig. Hints of hazy spice and a wheat-like note. Similar to Chimay, but also reminds me of Delirium Tremens. There is that distinctive yeast-spice tone to it. Complex yet exceptionally drinkable.  M. Smooth, warm, and perfectly carbonated. Not too sweet or too bitter; easy to sip with a meal or by itself.  D. Not even a hint of the 9% abv. A 750 ml bottle could easily put you to sleep...the taste is so sublime it creeps up on you. Warm, crisp, good with pasta and sharp cheese.  I am amazed that a beer can be this good.

22,34,MSchae1017,4.17,"This beer was tasted in a St. Bernardus goblet from the 12oz. bottle.  This beer pours into the goblet with a brilliant deep gold color with a frothy white head. The head dissipates to a nice film with whisps but does not leave too much lace. The smell of the beer is up front with sweet maltiness mixed in with the Belgian style yeast and some unknown spices. The taste is very complex. Just like the smell, the sweetness hits you first. This is very quickly followed by the belgian yeast along with the spiciness hitting you in the mouth like a punch. As the beer finished, a strong hop flavor is quite apparent and then the sweetness of the beer along with some fruitiness (apple?) returns and lingers on your tongue. The mouthfeel is low-medium with an incredible amount of effervescence. The finish leaves that sweet, yet dry feeling in your mouth. Overall, a highly drinkable triple. This is a very nice beer, and in a style I would not usually reach for.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,MMAJYK,3.96,"A- Dingy, golden yellow with 2 fingers of soft, full pillowy head after a conservative pour. It is non transparent. Lacing is all the way down the glass. Very nice!  S- Vibrant, unripe fruit such as crabapples and maybe cranberries. It is spicy too. Also, there is a somewhat ""funky"" musky smell there. I do not know what that is, but it kind of throws me off.  T- Candy sugar for sure; it is super sweet. Green apples and oranges are there too. For a high ABV, the alcohol is well hidden.  M- Carbonation is high and the mouthfeel is soft and smooth. Very close to perfect.  D- High. Goes down with ease, maybe a little too much so. The 9.0% will definitely lay your ears back.  Overall- Great brew. Another winner from Unibroue. These guys really have their stuff together. They are one of the most consistant breweries that I have found so far. This beer will definitely be revisited again soon.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Not too cloudy, but it isn't clear like a light beer.  Smell is absolute sweetness. Candylike.  Taste: I'm imagining this is what Homer Simpson was drinking when he said, ""Mmmm beer."" Sweet, but not overdone. Yeasty and bready finish.  Drinkability: This will be a regular in my fridge. Well, maybe not. I might save this for special occasions.  This is a thoroughly enjoyable brew. Delicious.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

A lot of spice in the aroma. Coriander and cloves, a touch of cinnamon. Their is some slight sweet fig, and some sour apple.  Lots of sweet malty fruit and honey balanced beautifully with a nice hoppy spice, and some slight dryness. Sweet fig, smooth honey, mild mango and dried fig finish. The spicy alcohol balances the sweetness with a nice dry finish. Superb.  Lot's of carbonation tingles your lips with every sip, with the body being slightly malt thick.

White peaches.. significant white pepper and lite clove.. My nose is too uneducated to pick through and identify alot.. but trust me, it smells great.  Front of the palate lends itself toward the spicy notes.. mid palate is peaches and tropical fruit... alot of Belgian yeastiness with a lingering sweetness.. not cloying, but present.

22,34,MillRat,4.62,"Poured from a bottle into a warm glass. Instant thick head that made pouring the rest of the bottle into the glass an exercise in patience. Thick meringue-like foam that could just about float a Buick over a translucent straw yellow that was so totally absent of red that I was looking to see if was actually little greenish. Fine aroma of pepper and clove with a little apricot. A slightly sweet-tart fruit start to the flavor that is cleansed by the spicy yeast notes and a little solventy presence that gives away the 9% ABV, though the body and the alcohol work well to offset each other. Surprisingly drinkable for a high ABV brew, like many of the Belgians that it emulates, and is indeed worthy of joining their ranks.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,Patrick999,4.27,"Poured into my Duvel tulip from the 750 ml bottle. Head was good, though not as long lasting, thick and clumpy as Duvel.  Smell - a tad pungent, maybe a bit of horse blanket. Has that nice bubble gum aroma.  Taste, feel - Rides a wave of sweetness pretty much all the way through. Not sure I was expecting this kind of sweetness. Not cloyingly sweet - maybe I just don't get that much hop balancing it out. I get some witbier-like clove and coriander. Alcohol is definitely concealed, though at 9% you start to feel it pretty quick. Feel is appropriate, not overly sharp. I like it.  Drinkability - this is my most important score for a BSPA, as I feel a good one should be very drinkable. I don't think a good BSPA's drinkability should be less than 4.5. That's part of the fun of this style...so easy to drink, yet so intoxicating. This fills the bill. I am pairing it with Cajun-smoked salmon on peppered water crackers, and it is working swimmingly.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Starts with a lemony pucker, candy sugar, and a medium yeasty sourness. Midway becomes smoothed with a little sweet malt character and notes of banana and vanilla. The finish adapts a more rounded flavor with a smoother lemon, lime flavor, grassy straw, and buttery malt. Semi-smooth mouthfeel on a thin to medium body and a very big carbonation. A bit to sweet for me is this beers only miss, a well hidden alcohol makes this considerably drinkable though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

It smelled of horse blanket and flowers,with a hint of sugary sweetness. There is also a faint yeasty scent to this beer as well. The taste was crisp and clean, slightly bitter in the front, finishing with a nice little bite that ended abruptly, very dry. Nice bubbly beer, with gobs of carbontaion, medium in body.

I decided to pick up a couple bottles after reading some of the reviews to see what the fuss was all about.  Very cloudy, golden pour with absolutely the freakiest head on a beer that I've ever seen. It just keeps building and building and never seems to subside any.  Someone in an earlier post said they smelled banana and I guess that's about right. That and alcohol. That ain't a bad thing.  Very surprised by the taste of this one. Starts out like a Hefe in my opinion with a banana and wheat taste and then has a finishing kick of alcohol that seems to compliment this very well.  The 9% can catch up with you quick if you aren't careful. The ABV hurts the drinkability a little bit but this is still a very good beer. Different than anything I've ever had, but very good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Peppery and slightly drying in the finish with mild floral hops.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied and creamy on the tongue; ample but gentle carbonation.

22,34,zane2hyperzane,4.73,"http://www.flickr.com/photos/zane2hyperzane/2096576317/  Appearance: Poured into its eponymous tulip glass. A pure white two or three finger fluffy head easily rises - but subsides a little too quickly, leaving a small amount of persistent lace. Many entertaining little columns of bubbles rise from points in the glass. The beer is a lovely glowing color - nearly opaque, tarnished gold. Be careful pouring this if you don't want an overabundance of bottled yeast in the glass, it'll definitely affect the flavor.  Smell: Subtle - flowers and cider.  Taste: Hits my tongue with faint malt sweetness and some fruity flavors, green apple in particular. This subsides pretty quickly as it dances over my tongue with a strong and somewhat bitter spiciness with fruit flavors still present  very interesting; something and nothing like spiced cider. This leads into a dry, hoppy finish. All these flavors meld very smoothly together, particularly as the beer warms a bit. Its a difficult taste for me to describe and one that can seem to vary from sip to sip  one of the reasons I enjoy returning to this beer is because its overall experience is not easy to pin down.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, seems just a bit creamy. Extremely lively and tingly on the tongue with its high carbonation and spiciness. Alcohol warms my face almost immediately  I feel better already! Ultimately, finishes nice and dry, leaving one begging for another sip.  Drinkability and Notes: Hides its robust alcohol deceptively; only a few of these and youll be unexpectedly lit, a pleasure Ive enjoyed many times. Very flavorful but not overpowering in any one regard. This is the beer that really opened my eyes to the world of craft brewing; one that I often return to and am never disappointed with. Ive had to reserve it for celebratory occasions to make room to try new beers, but tonight Im celebrating only La Fin du Monde. Drink less, drink better!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,RidiculedDisplay,4.15,"I was looking through my reviews the other day, and was reminded that I had taken it on myself to try and not search out and review more ""super rare"" or regionally unavailable beers before I could build up a good tally with the ones I drink often and can find easily. This review goes along with that philosophy.  Appearance: Pours with a lively finger and a half worth's of white, frothy head. Lacing is mountainous and present, although it tends to disappear a little too quickly for my liking. The head takes some time to dwindle down, but does after a minute and a half to two minutes, into a half-finger. Body is a pear straw color with yeasty obliqueness.  Smell: Yeasty funk comes first. Agitating the beer with a swirl, I get a lot of Belgian flagship apple and banana esters, along with a general cane sugar. There is a faint pine-y alcohol back end, as well, possibly from some hop additions. Granny smiths predominate me searching.  Taste: Banana, apple, some kiwi esters. Very representative of its style. That being said, also very clean and refreshing for a beer of its strength. Some white grapes in there, also. Very slight astringency on swallowing, alcohol is barely perceptible.  Mouthfeel: Extremely fizzy, refreshing, almost champagne-like. Great.  Drinkability: Is dangerously drinkable for its ABV.

22,34,bigeyedfish,4.2,"12 ounce, foil-topped bottle, best before date clearly printed on back of label, along with pouring directions, poured into a tulip.  Pours a really vibrant, slightly hazy golden color. Some head, not much, which is surprising on this beer, vanishes quickly, leaving a nice white ring around the outside of the cup. Some lacing, but nothing out of this world. Nothing to be wowed or discouraged by.  Nose consists of a lot of banana(not the peel, the actual fruit) and a lot of cloves, plus the normal Belgian yeast. Maybe even a slight, underlying hint of grannysmith apple which I did not expect. A nice smelling beer, but there are a lot of beers that smell like this one. Was kind of expecting some vanilla, and didn't get any.  Really, really delicious beer. For sure there is some granny smith apple, along with some aggressive cloves on the mid palate and a really nice starting flavor of subtle oranges. Not much banana, which like the lack of vanilla on the nose, is kind of surprising. This is, however, one of the better tasting Belgian-style Strong Pale's that there is. The alcohol is only there in the warming you get, and a little bit on the finish. I'm even starting to get some vanilla extract and even, and like the granny smith apple's this is very surprising, some cherry on the finish. Not dark cherries, but the normal cherries that you have to spit the seed out of. I actually almost get a little of the taste of the cherry pit right before you spit it out, when it's still covered in cherry-insides. Really, really surprised about a couple of flavors that I've never had before and I'm highly impressed. Really spicy mid-palate which is a treat. The finish is kind of under-impressive. It tends to die pretty quickly and is very one dimensional (orange/banana) but everything up to it is so complex that it's hard to complain.  The mouthfeel is tough, only because of the mid-palate, which is the strongest element of this beer- the spices tend to over-power everything else. I am anxious to try this beer between six and eighteen months from now; give the spices some time to calm themselves down. That's the big hurdle with this beer. Still, not a lot of alcohol present. Spice is the big one.  This is a beer that if you're easily offended by a lot of spicy-ness you may be offended by. The bottle I have was brewed in June 07, so, it's already done some aging. I think it could do some more, really settle down. With that all said, it's smooth as any beer out there, the alcohol is extremely stealth, and when detected, it's dare I say pleasant, if not enjoyable. But it is kind of boozy, and I think with the smoothness does something to affect the drinkability. This is a beer where two will go down extremely easy and then you'll start to feel them in a big way. But I think this is a beer that will go well with a lot of foods, great as a dessert and even as something that's not sessionable, but spaced out over the course of a night could prove to be a great 3 or 4 bottles in a night beer.  A top-quality effort from Unibroue and probably one of the 4 or 5 best BSPA's that don't come from Belgium.

Plenty of life in the head that lasted, and easily re-energised when swirled in the glass. The smell was quite a wake-up call. Possibly one of the most unusual collection of aromas I have perceived from a beer glass. The nearest beer smell to this was from an Orval, but there was much more complexity to LFDM with sweet apples adding to the funkiness. This confusion continued in the taste; plenty of sweetness but with spice, alcohol disguised but warming.. High carbonation adding to the nice mouthfeel.  In summary, I'm still confused over this beer! I need to try it again, but I found it a little too challenging and too sweet for my palate.  EDIT: so I have tried this brew again, and I now appreciate it as a very good tripel. For this reason, I am changing the drinkability score from 3 to 4!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Lothore,3.65,"A- Pours a deep golden color with a huge eggshell white head. Lots of carbonation bubbles are present.  S- Smells of Belgian yeast, spicy, funk, and a sweetness.  T- Taste is very spicy and semi sweet. Mixed lighter fruits and a bit of alcohol are present. A bit cloying.  M- Medium viscosity with a good amount of carbonation. Sticks to the inside of the mouth.  D- I know lots of other people like this beer but I just don't dig it. For me the funk and sweetness combined with the stickiness makes it less than drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Antilochus,4.49,"6 pack from a Kingston, ON Beer Store. 9.00% abv, 341mL bottle. Poured into an unbranded snifter.  Body is hazy unfiltered brownish yellow. Substantial bubbly white head, decreasing to a cream, decent retention.  Scent is strong of alcohol (at 9% this is to be expected), yeast, apricot, and orange peel. Overall fairly fruity coupled with bread.  The End of the World is complex. Strong Unibroue yeasty base. Fairly strong malt sweetness, very little hops, with apricot very strong in the finish. As it warmed definitely noticed the alcohol more, with nectarine become apparent in the finish. Medium body with definite carbonation, makes for a lovely sipper. The abv is generally not overpowering, however *WARNING* it is definitely not sessionable!  A classic Tripel, and one of my top 5.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JamesS,2.68,"Pours a straw color, nothing deep or special. A nice head, but no lacing. An odd scent, a mix of bitter and sweet, not really mixed, but neither one overpowering the other. Has a bubbly feel to it, but goes down smooth enough for a high ABV beer. Not much of a taste, rather bland, but with a bitter, high alcohol aftertaste.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BigJTrucker,4.25,"Pours a hazy, unfiltered yellow/orange color, Large white head, settles fairly quickly. This has a sweet somewhat fruity aroma, very bready, almost like a witbier, but with out the orange peel. Taste has faint notes of dried fruit, maybe even some oak? It also hides the alcohol quite well. Mouthfeel seems to start off somewhat fizzy, but finishes rather smooth. Drinkability is quite high, as this is a very well balanced brew. Definitly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ThatWineGuy,4.08,"Murky orange colour with an off-white head, one finger with retention, fed by a steady stream of bubbles, good lacing. The nose is mildy spicy, yeast, bready impressions. There is, again, more yeast in the mouth, living up to the Unibroue reputation, with a carbonated mouthfeel. The taste is of sour fruit, twist of lemon, a lot of wit beer influence, tartness. The higher alcohol gives it a kick and a warm, full bodied mouthfeel - it commands your respect without being overbearing. This is one to savour slowly. Overall, I enjoyed this but was a bit disappointed that it didn't deliver a bit more; maybe some age is what is needed to bump up my scores, admittedly, this was fresh and could have used cellaring.  Edited Dec. 2, 2008, to say that I had another bottle aged one year and pretty much scored it 4.5 across the board. Overall impresson: under-stated bold and adventurous, much like the Quebec legend that inspired it, this was a very good example of the style. Keep up the good work Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,basica,4.08,"Bought this bottle from CrackedKettle after reading and hearing so much about it. I thought I must give this a shot, being a fan of Unibroue's brews. I served the Fin Du Monde in my Duvel tulip and it billows up with a nice thick head good retention. The beer itself is a hazy orange golden color. On the nose, I have yeast, malts, some floral aromas as well as a light dash of apricot. The taste comes in with very subtle sweetness and clear yeast with a nice bready malt backing to it. It was somewhat similar to some blonds but very well done in this one albeit the fact that I am not to comfy with too much yeast jumping at me. Slightly citrusy in the taste but not much fruits detected which was a pity (think there was also a dash of apricot here). Some clear bready earthy tones too. The taste was generally strong and fairly complex, although I am not a big fan of yeasty tastes, I have to take my hat of this one. The finish was also yeasty but it unveiled a most wonderful after taste thereafter. I had apricots and then clearly apples with some very sublte malt sweetness. After the apples came delicious grapes lasting though a bit and ""strong"", ""tasty"" and ""lingering"" would be how I describe the after taste! The Fin Du Monde is between medium to full body thickness and the carbonation was good and active. Alcohol warming and strength were clear but the smoothness was not taken away; it goes down a little dry. This is a nice beer and I am glad I tried it though I am not a big fan of blonds. This one is clearly a great blond style for whoever is into the style; it tastes more like a blond than a tripel but that's one hell of a great blond we are talking about. Although I still prefer the Westmalle and Chimay tripels, it is a different gratification that I am after. Fin du Monde is a great beer and albeit not exactly my taste, I do feel that the after taste was awesome.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,LeftonJackman,4.79,"After a long weekend of moving trucks and hauling boxes, some friends and I sat down at the Winking Lizard for beer and pizza.  A: La Fin Du Monde poured a yellow/orange with a perfect untampered cloudiness. The head was soft and billowy with noticeable packets of air, hinting at the sparkle to come.  S: Amazing in the nose! Apricot, nectarine and a beautiful balance between sweet and spicy. Correctly present. The aroma wasn't too faint nor too dominant. I thought of trails and evergreens.  T: Smack your momma good. The head tickled my upper lip and the spicy citrus washed over my tongue. Being such a well-balanced flavor profile, my entire tongue was engaged.  M: Sparkling and alive, but not heavy. Most beers I have tasted that were this alive in the mouth were heavy in it as well. This beer was pristine, almost delicate without losing any presence.  D: I was not overpowered by the ABV and the beer left enough room for a second. Would enjoy again, in a heartbeat!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,CanuckRover,4.36,"Poured from bottle. Big fluffy head fills my Hoegaarden Grand Cru glass. Very pale beer, pale gold with an orange hue in the light. Cloudy, as should be expected.  Nose is sweet. Caster sugar with lots of citrus fruit, orange and lemon zest with the liveliness of grapefruit. Noticeable spiciness, cloves stand out. The alcohol certainly comes out.  Beer is a balancing act between spiciness, fruity/sugary sweetness and the alcohol esthers. Wonderful, very grainy, malt offers all sorts of fruit, most of which were immediately apparent in the aroma. Orange stands out, not only the zest, but a nice juicyness in the finish. The spice works especially well for me. Cloves offer an almost gingery taste, pulling the beer back just as the sweetness starts to become too sugary. Yeast leaves a dry impression, almost dusty.  Mouthfeel, I didn't taste this champage carbonation that everyone seems to mention. It foams in the mouth but it isn't exactly tingly.  Not a session beer obviously but the noticeable alcohol is handled very well. It's warming and works well with the rest of the beer's characteristics. I see what all the fuss is about, a great beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,scottyshades,4.5,"This is amongst my favorite beers...picked one up at ABC in a mix n' match...This beer pours a rich golden color with a tremendous head that leaves a nice lace. I noticed noted a fruity, yeasty smell with some spices mixed in. Tastes similar to its smell. Leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste and it is highly drinkable... The only issue I have with this beer is that the alcohol content is noticeable.

It poured very red and golden and the head was not very large. The taste was very good, but not something I could drink all the time. It was very rich and sweet and would be best with a desert. It was a very strong beer. I only rated the drinkability a 4 because it is not something I would drink everyday and with any food, only with a desert. Everything else about this beer was perfect. It was recommended by an old friend who lived near the manufacturer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Grintbrad,4.32,"Served by cellar aged bottle, about 4 months  App: Hazy, Golden orangish with fluffy, whipped cream like head and effervescence. Cloudy. Sparkling like champagne.  Smell: Oranges, Lemons, and a slight funky yeasty smell. Spicy.  Taste: Sweet start with a dry finish. Citrus fruits and sugars, spicy yeast and earthy yet subtle hops.  Mouthfeel: Slight puckering yet refreshing. Smooth, and warming from the alcohol.  Drinkability: Decent. I couldn't have more than 1-2 glasses of this, but its pretty good. Carbonation is a distraction, very effervescent like champage. Taste is great, alcohol is barely noticeable, despite the high ABV. Pleasant yeast flavor, and delicous overtones of oranges and lemons. Excellent beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,berserker256,4.22,"Hazy, orangey-yellowish. Full white bubbly head. Warm alcohol-fruity aroma with a yeasty touch. Warm going down. High alcohol content obviosly contributes to this. Feels similar to wine in that aspect. For that reason, the drinkability is hampered. But the taste itself is a pleasant one. Fruity warm flavor with ample carbonation. This is the perfect beer to drink two of on an empty stomach before dinner. You drink two, eat like a slob, then fall asleep on the living room floor while watching the evening news. Hopefully the kid doesn't start crying...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,CharlieMopps,4.47,"A: Pours a hazy, golden orange with a massively dense head that displays excellent retention and imparts a web of lace along the sides of the glass.  S: A yeasty, pale malt tripel smell with the quintessential Belgian aroma of sweetness and a bit of funk. Smells delicious.  T: Tasty and balanced, this Belgian interpretation has all the qualities of a tripel, yet stands on its own. The intro is gentle and mild, leading into a twangy hop middle and a rush of bubbles and sweetness. Finish is slightly drying, yet refreshing, and leaves a bit of the bittersweet combination trailing down the back of the mouth.  M: Creamy and crisp, carbonation is quite generous, but not an enhancer, not detractor, of flavor.  D: Very drinkable. The construction of this beer is not only doing a service to Belgian-style ales brewed in North America, but to craft beer in general. Most noticeable to me is the hop character, jumping out, yet blending so well with the overall composition.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,surferman576,4.4,"Appearance: Light coppper and cloudy with an orange hue.  Smell: Coriander, orange peel, black pepper, currant maybe, cloves, vanilla. Very alcoholic, but blends nicely with the abundance of fruity esters.  Taste: Strongly citrusy and peppery, probably due to the orange peel and coriander, respectively. Strong in alcohol but not unpleasant or overpowering.  Mouthfeel: Pleasantly heavy and warming. Makes your mouth water more with every sip.  Drinkability: Quite drinkable and soothing considering the high alcohol content. I would keep drinking these all night if they didn't hit me so hard!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The alcohol makes its presence known as you go with a nice warming feeling.  Mouthfeel: Very good thickness. The creamy head adds a lot to the drink. The good amount of carbonation gives the beer a nice quality that helps it stand out.  Drinkability: Very good beer. Wonderful taste and complexity.

There is a coriander/pepper spicy yeast quality that that goes very well with a strong citrus flavor.  M: A lot of carbination and some alcohol warmth in the mouth but not nearly enough to be unpleasant.  D: I could see drinking a few of these without the sweetness or tartness becoming too much.

22,34,PhageLab,4.54,"This is one of my favorites, but I wanted a fresh one to review with, well, review or not, I just wanted a fresh one.  A - Deep cloudy golden hue swirling with yeasty currents. Thick foamy head that lingers. Nice lacing.  S - Like fresh apricots being cut. You can detect the alcohol, but the citrus overpowers it by far and even blends it a bit, making a very pleasant end result.  T - The alcohol is present but is masked so well by the bitter profile that it doesn't bother at all. After the initial citrus wave and bitter bite, some breaded taste can easily be detected due to the yeast, but it fits right in here. The aftertaste is very sweet, and the finish is not too dry as may have been expected.  M - Nearly full bodied but despite that and the abv, it is extremely smooth and leaves just the right amount of flavor behind leaving you wanting another sip.  D - Decent, although it is very tasty I can't give it a 5 due to the 9%, that would be dangerous after too many. I've done it quite a few times, but I wouldn't advocate that to anyone. All in all this is one of the best brews I've had the honor of consuming and it always makes for a great session.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

I get a salty feeling on my lips as if I'm drinking a margarita, which is perplexing to say the least. This beer is definitely peaking my curiosity.

Don't love it, but not bad. Carbonated and tingly in the mouth.  D: Very carbonated and bubbly. So it is zesty, yet hardly smooth.  Quite frankly,this is not my type of beer with how fruity it is.

Appearance - cloudy golden color, like dark honey... decent one-inch head forms and dissipates surprisingly quickly but leaves a nice ring and thin layer of bubbles on top...  Smell - mmm... very nice... fruity bananas, apples, and a touch of distinct spice at the end... some alcohol in the nose as well - to be expected from a 9% brew...  Taste - like an intensified version of the smell... lots of bananas and spice, there is just so much going on here... i'm sipping it slowly, and by now it is room temp... the flavor does a little jig on your tongue, and lingers for quite some time... this is a great beer...  Mouthfeel - This is perhaps where this beer stands out the most. It has a lot of fruitiness, but no overly-thick mouthfeel... sometimes a beer that is this fruity leaves a bit too much thickness on the tongue, but this has a wonderful dry finish. the appropriately high level of carbonation is a big help here as well. Very well done.  Drinkability - Dangerously Drinkable. As a 9% brew, you could get yourself in over your head very quickly here. The dry finish is what makes this so easy to drink - you have all the fruit flavors with none of the heaviness to weigh things down...  Overall - Bravo.

Sweet, papery hops and subtle spices, especially clove and cardamon.

I'm drinking this at room temp so I'm getting a real blast of flavours and I have to say, it's a bit overwhelming.  After a few more sips and after my palate gets more used to what it is experiencing, I'm beginning to really enjoy what is going on here.I'm finding it to be a smooth sipper; it has a medium mouthfeel to it and the carbo is also medium and it finishes on the vinuous side.

22,34,CoSMoSYS,4.5,"Poured a very delicious golden straw color with a really good amount of head that leaves pretty quickly. I didn't notice any lacing at all. If you look closely, you can see a plethora of carbonation bubbles racing to the top.  The smell is very sweet and I notice some hops and malt already. I definitely noticed the pear like previous people have pointed out. I can't wait to drink this beer!  The taste was excellent. It was sweet but they also did a good job of mixing all different spices to give it a unique taste. They also do a very good job of hiding the alcohol. This can be a dangerous beer! The aftertaste was of hops, yeast and I could swear I noticed a doughy taste in there as well.  The carbonation in the drink is delightful and the first thing you notice. After that it's all about the smooth and creamy feeling. The beer almost has a dry numbing effect on the sides of my tongue. I kept wanting to sip one right after the other.  I've had this beer before but this was the first time I actually took the time to review and notice all its subtle properties.

22,34,dnichols,4.25,"I poured a 330 ml capped bottle into a tulip.  A: It poured a hazy yellow with a massive head of four fingers. The sticky off white head lingered for a long time and in fact was regenerated for a while from the stream of bubbles rising from the brew. This reminded me of a lemon marainge pie.  S: Has the notable aroma of citrus, crisp apples and pears and the tang of dry hops. It does not have the malty richness I expected but the aroma was pleasant and fell easy on my olfactory sensory neurons.  T: As with most strong pale ales it benefits from a rest to allow the beer to relax brining out the smooth and creamy character and allowing the the malty richness to find its balance with the yeast and hops. Warming on the tongue but no residual aftertaste except a bit of a tang and a hair of the sweet malts.  M: Medium to full bodied with a creamy texture that fills the mouth with a smooth rich warmness. The good balance of the malts with the hops, carbonation and alcohol leaves the mouth warm, dry and ready for the next sip.

22,34,DoubleJ,4.85,"Ah, memories. I finally meet up again with the beer I enjoyed the most back during my winter trip in Canada. A plate of poutine on a 25 degree (F) afternoon in Montréal and a bottle of this at Frite Alors remains one of my fuzziest memories of the trip. But now, will a change of culture and weather in Southern Califronia change the enjoyement level of this beer? Time to find out:  What a beautful pour it does into my Stella Artois chalice, and what a beautiful sight when the pouring ritual is finished. An unfiltered golden blonde in color with a big billowy head on top. Too bad the retention isn't perfect. An attractive aroma of fruits (with apricots the most dominating) lure me closer to the glass for a sip. The taste is so close to heaven, even for the style. Upfront with a peppery fruit flavor, but the spiciness won't have you bowing to it. The sweetness pushes in and keeps the spiciness from being too much. Warming alcohol is persistent in the throat.  I've forgotten how much I loved this beer. A change of scenery showed no change in the experience, although it wasn't enjoyed around Québeçois surroundings for a truly authentic one. A masterpiece of a brew!  Oh, and hooray to me for being the 1000th reviewer of this gem!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,beerbutcher,4.42,"a- decanted off sediment, the beer pours a rich gold with a brimming two finger head of white clouds that takes forever to fade. carbonation is high, but not obnoxious... the bubbles are pouring from the bottom of the glass. beer is a touch hazy.  smell- the nose is intense and wildly belgian! powerful fruity aromas, as well as spice, bread, dried fruit, and smoke and some rich caramel tones. there's a nice bicuity character to the malt.. can't get over the complexity of the nose!  taste- it is quite lush, with a full fruity front supported by nice citrusy hops and a push of alcohol. there is a definite banana bread flavor and even some spiciness. the trailing finish, dryingly bitter and a touch on the boozy side leaves me craving more. incredibly balanced and refreshing for it's strength, so much complexity.  mouthfeel- the beer is lovely on the palate. the carbonation is at a great levely for keeping the drink light, and every part of my mouth is amused. there is ample malt, great amount of bitterness and the alcohol holds it together nicely.  drinkabiliy- fantastic at first and getting easier all the time.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bunnyhustle,4.52,"Been hooked on Unibroue and this is next in line. Poured from 750 mL bottle. Pours a light, hazy orange in color, a golden orange if you will. A thick, rocky head first appears and takes its time to settle. Aroma is of sour fruits, yeast, and some sweets. Tastes is wunderbar! A mixture of various fruits (apple, some citrus, and maybe a touch of grape) and a touch of sour. Alcohol is present as well, the first sip leaves a brilliant warm feeling in the mouth. His a slightly creamy mouthfeel to it and goes down smooth leaving a pleasant aftertaste. Like many of Unibroue's other offering only a 4 on drinkability as 2 glass of this can leave your head spinning. A terrific beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Romulus141,5,"Poured into a large wine glass (to approximate a chalice)  Appearance: Pours a cloudy white amber. It looks a bit like a hefe-weizen in appearance. There is a nice, fluffy white head on the top with excellent retention. Lacing remains on the edges of this glass. I can also see carbonation bubbles rising to the top of the brew.  Smell: A sweet, citrus smell first hits my nostrils, followed by the spicy, doughy character found in a good Belgian beer. There are hints of all spice as well. The smell is well defined and pleasant. It gives a great hint as to what the taste will be like.  Taste: The taste begins quite spicy, and gives way to a light, raisin-like sweetness. The sweetness is quite strong and resembles some of the best Belgian beers out there. The beer then finishes with a hoppy bitterness which excellently balances out the sweet and spicy nature of this brew. I can also detect some banana and citrus overtones as well. This is a wonderfully complex ale, and the alcohol is perfectly masked. This ranks among one of the best beers I've ever had.  Mouthfeel: Light and crisp, which is an awesome counterbalance to the well-defined flavor of the ale. There is some light carbonation that gives it a nice little kick on the finish. The balance between flavor and a light body is amazing.  Drinkability: I could drink this all day. It may be rich, but it's much too good to put down. This is meant to be savored and enjoyed. Watch out for the ABV, which is 9%. It can catch up with you quite quick.  This is highly recommended, and it is laudable that this Belgian-styled brew is from Canada of all places. This sample is the second 750 ml bottle I've purchased, and I know that I will reach for this again some time.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,beeragent,4.4,"Poured into a snifter from a bomber. The beer pours a slightly hazy straw, forming a massive 3 fingers worth of head, that faded leaving some medium spots of lace. The aroma is delicious fruit and sugar. The taste is very much the same, consisting of sharp hops, followed by a sweet candy taste, and finishing with a very smooth fruity flavor. Higher carbonation than expected, but still an easy drinker. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this brew. Full flavor and smooth mouthfeel made for a very enjoyable Belgian. I will be getting this again!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,daaru,4.7,"this is one of my very favourite beers, and proof that you don't have to go to the belgians for an excellent belgian style beer. beautiful honey colour, floral aroma, balanced flavour with dry and sweet notes. eminently drinkable, almost dangerously so given the alcohol content. if you don't watch out if will be the end of the world. but not a bad way to go.  this beer is excellent with spicy food, but also just by itself.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Slatetank,4.55,"Poured cool into a La fin Du Monde glass from a brown 12oz. bottle. A - A beautiful amber the shade of honey w/ a fluffy 3 finger white head.  S - Like fresh bread w/ a dash of sweetness, full of Belgian character w/ spice and herbal notes. A nice dry wheat aroma enhances the smell.  M - A medium full body w/ gentle sweetness, toasted texture w/ hints of spice and a dry finish.  T - A very pleasant and balanced Belgian style ale. Somewhere between a wit and a tripel - strong and complex like an abbey, yet spiced and refreshing like a wit. There is a bit of wheat in the flavor w/ a honey-like malt taste. The malt really makes the ale special. Smooth and refined it keeps you wanting more.  D - This is a really world class beer even if the name implies drinking on at ""the end of the world"". It is just drinkable in almost every sense w/ sweetness, Belgian character and spice. The 9% abv makes it more of a sipper, but pure pleasure in each sip.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Smell: Fruity and spicey with a hint of peppper.  Taste: Really complex with an extraordinary mouthfeel and a dry finish. Coriander and spices dominate the palate, followed by a warming sensation from the 9% abv.  Overall: A good sipper but i have to be in the mood for spice to pick this one up again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Smell - Sweet, fruity, candy sugar, yeast, phenols, white grapes, bananas, so complex...i could go on and on...  Taste - Once again, very complex. Candy sugar, belgian yeast, clove, coriander, white grapes, green apple..etc and more!  Mouthfeel - Very bubbly, champagne-like, medium bodied, velvety.  Drinkability - Well, this beer is quite simply delicious. If it wasnt for the 9% abv, Id have a field day. A 750ml of this golden elixir of the gods is perfect.

22,34,Bobikel,4.37,"Served from a 750 ml into a 500 ml goblet  Appearance - Pours a slightly hazy golden blonde with a thick clunky head. Retention is good, while lacing is slightly below what I'd like to see in a trippel.  Smell - Yeasty, and slightly bitter, with all the usual trippel acoutrements. (if indeed that's how it's spelled)  Taste - A nice explosion of hops quickly melds into an even malt/estery balance. Not to much to say that hasn't been said before. This is a must buy.  Mouthfeel - Thick and creamy, but very dry after the swallow. Probably my favorite thing about trippels.  Drinkability - A long slow sipper that wears a little to much on my palate a little to quick.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bluejacket74,4.21,"Served in a snifter, the beer pours a cloudy golden/orange color with about an inch white head. The aroma isn't strong at all, but what I can smell is nice. Mostly there's just an overall fruity and sweet smell, along with some cloves, honey, pear and yeast. Luckily the taste is stronger, it tastes like fruit, cloves, pepper and honey. Mouthfeel is medium with a lot of carbonation, a little too much, but not enough that it takes away from the beer. The drinkability is still pretty good, it goes down easy and the alcohol isn't noticable at all. I think this is a pretty decent beer. The aroma wasn't strong, but the taste and overall drinkability made up for it. Recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,Maracuja,4.25,"The clear light golden / dark straw hued brew is topped by a creamy, impressively thick head w/ stiff peaks of foam. Signature lace is left down the glass. Fruit esters comprised of tart lemon flesh and rind, coupled w/ cidery light candi / beet sugar sweetness and raw honey lend an enticing aroma to this brew. Phenolic clove and mustiness are subdued, but add complexity aromawise. Prickly carbonation and cidery sweetness sharply hit the palate upfront, but quickly yield to yeasty, unbaked dough notes and clove more prominent in flavor than the aroma would suggest. Well attenuated and fairly dry, but since hop bitterness is mild, the overall flavor is slightly skewed towards malt sweetness. Lightly bodied due to the sugar used in the grist w/ a crisp, yet smooth mouthfeel that lends deceptively agreeable drinkability. Finishes dry w/ honey sweetness, lightly peppery alcohol and clove abruptly ending simultaneously. Fin Du Monde epitomizes the style and is delicious... the drinkability is superlative considering its strength.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Floydster,4.15,"750 ml, corked and caged bottle from Hollymain Liquor  Poured into a chilled pint glass  Nice belgian ale with minimal hoppiness from Canada  Nice fruity aroma with a hint of ground cinamon as well  People I shared this with enjoyed it more than I did, but I still thought it was an above average beer",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,LittleCreature,4.4,"Appearance - 4.0 Poured three fingers of tight, foamy, white head, which reduced steadily. The colour is a very deep gold, slightly hazy, with a few champagne like bubbles rising in the middle. Possibly the prettiest beer I have ever seen.  Smell - 4.5 Not overly powerful, but still wonderful. The alcohol is clearly there, amongst the sweet smells of malt, honey, stone fruit, cloves and spices. Not unlike a strong hefe weissbier in aroma, and not far from scoring a perfect 5 in this category.  Taste - 4.5 Again, the alcohol is immediately making a presence, and makes up a little more of the taste than I would like. The taste is nowhere near as sweet as the smell, which is a bit of a disappointment. The alcohol is immediately warming, which is nice. There is biscuity malt sweetness and a whisper of fruitiness (pear). The finish is dry and moderately bitter, and the aftertaste is pleasant.  Mouthfeel - 4.5 Really quite champagne-like, it feels light in the mouth, with a relatively high level of carbonation. Smooth.  Drinkability - 4.5 This definitely gets easier to drink as it warms. There are much more drinkable Belgian strong pale ales out there in my opinion, as this one's dryness and bitterness reduce the appeal.  OVERALL - 4.5 This is undoubtedly an excellent beer, although it is not quite to my taste. The warming sensation from drinking it is wonderful, so for that, I may one day try it again. Personally, I find other offerings from Unibroue to be a bit easier drinking, although perhaps not as complex. Price is very high, but the quality is excellent, so no quarrels about the value.  Edit: upon second sampling, I bumped the score up from 4.2 to 4.35. First time round I most definitely drank the beer too cold.  Re-edit: My opinion of this beer just keeps improving. I disagree with a lot of what I have originally written about it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,objectivemonkey,4.43,"Into a St Bernardus chalice, pours a beautiful golden color merging on orange, hazy with a nice fizzy, fluffy, bubbly white head, lasts for about a minute, receding to a thin film, lacing brought to a wall of bubbly foam that falls equally thick upon a gentle swirl, occasionally globules sticking here or there.  The aroma is full, citrus and fruit in apple and oranges, spices of pepper and maybe some clove.  The taste is even better than I remember, the mouth full and tingling. Citrus abounds, apples and pears mingle, white pepper and clove and a delicious yeast, the mouth drying as it finishes but leaving the mouth tingling, yearning, not quite salivating for more, but wanting to.  In sum, this is a delicious beer. In fact, I just finished refinishing a wood floor, I'm tired as hell, really I just wanted a heavy night cap to put me asleep, but this thing is so tasty, and the qualities so evident, it just makes me smile.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,becktone,4.88,"Eye: Note: I have never gotten a good head or retention on the beers that I have poured into this Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale Snifter; however now that I've poured it this doesn't seem to be a problem.  The brew has excellent head formation and retention. Just as good, if not better than Duvel. The head is big, pillowy, fluffy, white and rocky. There is a bit of lacing as the over-sized head from the pour recedes to a more suitable size. Color is a somewhat hazy straw yellow, or lemon square yellow if you prefer.  Nose: Sweet candi aroma here. A bit of spice from the hops perhaps, but not much else, very clean. Maybe some banana and clove esters as well. Not very potent. Alcohol is well hidden. For me hard to describe because the aroma isn't as potent as I would like.  Tongue: Oh my! What a great tasting brew. It is sweet with a very candied type of flavor. To balance out this sweetness there is a very pleasant and lingering spicy character...weather from hops, yeast phenols, or actual spices it provides the great service of balancing this brew...amazing.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: In the mouth the brew is of a lighter body, with lower levels of carbonation than I would expect for the style. The beer finishes fairly spicy and a bit dry, but not too dry. This is a beer that I'd drink just about any time, not sure if I prefer it over Duvel-sure they're not the same, but they do have similarities-but in my book it is definitely the same quality. I see the two as interchangeable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S: Spices, yeast, and some light fruits. Alcohol appeared a bit as it warmed.  T: A big hit from the spices - clove, pepper - maybe coriander too. And the yeast. Fruit was present too, but the spice overwhelmed most everything else.  M: Medium body that was a bit over carbonated - almost fizzy at first, but then settled down. Dry finish w/ the spice & yeast present in a lasting aftertaste.  D: The alcohol was hidden well, but it's still a sipper thanks to the spice & mediocre flavor.  Not a bad brew, just ok - and quite overrated IMO.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

I can see the carbonation from the yeast forming little pockets of bubbles all along the side of my glass and the head retention lasts almost the entire glass, not as much beautiful lacing as I was hoping for so it misses out on the five.  S: Super yeasty which gives off a sweet bananna and sugary scent that I find okay but is not my all time favorite.  T/MF: My first glass was served a bit colder than it should have been and maybe for that reason was more bubbles than taste. My mouth filled up with gasses from the carbonation so I couldn't taste the beer at first, but then on my second glass, after the beer warmed up a bit the gas subsided enough for me to get the full flavor of the beer which I have to say is quite good. Fruits are all over the place in this beer, shining through a super sweet yeast taste. Pears and orange and apple are there amonst the sweet yeast and malt characters that make this one quite quaffable.  D: Could drink this one all night if I didn't have pure abbey style ales around me. But great and tasty reproduction of the Beglain style. Yum.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

I poured it into the glass, raising just a thin lacy head which dissipated almost instantly. It was hazy and the color of golden wheat. Yeast was visibly floating in the glass.  The nose was sweet - honey and florals, with sharp spices and a little grassy.  The taste was layered: sweet first, tingly on the tongue, then the spices and florals hit with a hint of ginger and what I call a ""Belgian Funk,"" the finish is slightly dry with a snap of hops which brings you into a pleasant after taste.  I'm giving an average drinkability because while the alcohol doesn't affect the taste at all, the beer is too tangy to give it a high drinkability rating, though it is still a great beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,cdkrenz,3.88,"$5.00 / 750ML Bottle County Market Grocery Store Stevens Point, Wisconsin  Appearance - A haze of golden yellow to a pale orange with a lasting frothy white head. The head starts out with about 3 inches and slowly tapers back to about a 1/2 inch where it is well maintained. Very much carbonated as a constant flow of tiny bubbles speed to the top if the beer from the side and bottom of the pint glass.  Smell - There's a soapy aroma to this brew I find quite difficult to get past.  Taste - Sweet plum taste but not overwhelming. This is a tasty beer with a malty start and solid finish. The 9% alcohol content is not easily noticed because the flavor is established so well.  Mouthfeel - Even with the obviously strong carbonation seen in the pint, this brew is very smooth to the mouth. It goes down easy and even has a silky afterfeel. There's a tiny little punch in the top back of my mouth when first taking the sip. I think that may be the alcohol content.  ~ This is a very good beer. There is really something to be said for the 'head' offered by different brewing styles. This is a light almost out of body feel that makes me very pleased that I have another full pint glass of frothy goodness waiting for me in the oversized bottle.

Clear gold color, head is very white and thick. Surprisingly, there was no hint of lace after the huge head.  S: Has all of the ""sweetness"" of a belgian ale with slight hints of ""spices""  T: Very little sign of the alcohol, this could be dangerous. Mostly cloves (maybe ginger) with some banana in the background.  M: Highly carbed, feels tingly on the tongue. Light but seems to linger if that makes any sense.

Tons of malty yeasty sweetness, with bubble gum, clove, banana and tart apples leading the way.  T: Very easy drinking brew for the ABV. Starts off with the nice yeasty sweetness that was apparent in the aroma. I taste candy sugar, lemon rind, and it finishes with the tartness of fresh green Granny Smith Apples.  M: Medium bodied, yet light. Very smooth drinking beer.  D: Goes down rather smooth, I picked up the little bottle this go around but could and have put down the 750 ml rather easily.  Overall: La Fin Du Monde translates in English to ""The End of the World this beer is not the end all be all of beer, but if I happened to be drinking it on my judgment day I would be a happy man.  Every country has their brewers who try to recreate Belgium's best and Unibroue does it consistently brew after brew....Canada should be proud. Along with Maudite these two beers are perfect examples, yet different than the best that Belgium has to offer.

Many streamers race to the surface. Smells lemony and tropical with some phenol. A bit of a ginger zing and some oranges.  Tastes wet sweet with strong fruity. Some dried hay and quite a bit of phenol. I have a hard time with phenol and this beer is difficult for me to handle. Yeasty serves to temper the sweet and a strong sting from carbonation lifts the thickness from the tongue. ABV must be about 10%, but is quite well integrated with the other flavors. Clean, without fusels. Aftertaste is increasingly drying with an unpleasant phenol and aromatic oil that contributes a numbing or dulling effect. Md body and heavily carbonated.

S: Very fruity, but not overwhelming, and not with one particular scent. I smelled hints of apples and lemons, and plenty of orange and coriander. Maybe a trace of berries of some kind? Certainly plenty of sugary sweetness, too. T: Sweet at first, and that lasts all the way through. It feels like it should almost turn bitter towards the end, but it doesnt and remains perfectly well-balanced. Smooth and creamy finish. Subsequent sips reveal a nice honey flavor, as well. M: Smooth throughout, and not that heavy for such a high alcohol beer (9% ABV). D: For a beer of this complexity, drinkability is high.

22,34,tapman,4.3,"#2 in my Unibroue 6-pack, very exciting.  14 karat gold with a very hazy transparency topped by a 2-finger head (more of a head depending on how skilled the pour). Great lacing lasts and lasts and lasts.  More Belgiumy (yeasty) than the darker Maudite. Sweet spicy fruit (apricot) ester aromas coupled with a sweet suger back. Malts are hard to detect a little if at all, but its a Belgium, baby, so lets all just settle down. A little bit of alcohol pulls through when one really gets their nose in there.  More alcohol than the taste, but not bad. Less apricot and more spiced fruit in general, like an amalgamation of many different non-citrusy (orangeish) fruits i.e. starfruit, mango, plantain, etc. Sweet/sour yeast finish settles on the palate as a nice wrap-up. So nice when it warms up; a warmer temperature brings out the sweet. Also when warmer the clove and cinnamon notes come out. If you don't warm this baby up then you don't know what you are missing, man.  Once again a typical Belgiumish mouthfeel of crisp bubbles and good beer. Light but with texture.  Very drinkable, but the alcohol comes out much more than in the Maudite, its darker sister, and is less complex than Maudite, also. Still, preferable over a delirium Tremens and is quite delicious during hot summer days. A very good brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The taste is big and bready, with some of the spicy notes and a finish that is dominated by alcohol. Finishes real hot and dry.

At 9%abv this beer at first seems a Duvel clone, but a closer taste reveals far more Belgian yeast character that includes a sourness and a wet blanket funk.

Taste is quite sweet and very fruity/cider-like, with a full mouthfeel and spicy finish which hides the high alcohol content very well. Alcohol burn is noticeably absent for a 9% beer. Certainly give this a try, easy to drink and a nice bellywarmer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Grass,4.46,"Appears with lots of tight bubbles, beautiful golden appeal. Show care when pouring, this one's highly carbonated. The visual has you under its spell.  A fruity bouquet, cherries, slightly sour yeast in a good way. Still anticipating the taste. Aroma is almost perfumy, quite invigorating.  High carbonation and a fresh yeast that's slightly sweet, cherries and sour apples. A sliver of nutiness with a very deverse array of flavors. Mouthfeel is frothy and effervesant with a thin, clean finish.  I could drink way too many of these with it's 9.0% ABV. Goes down easy. Great beer for HOT and SPICEY dishes, very soothing.  A winner of a belgian from Unibroue!!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,PBRstreetgang,4.27,"Pours a pale straw hue, with the clarity greatly disturbed by the expressive carbonation(another gusher!). The fizzy snow-white head eventually drops to a sturdy cap leaving weak lacing. Pils malt, hay, earthy yeast tones and clean alcohol are the most apparent aromas, with belgian phenols and candy-ish esters become more pronounced as the bouquet opens up. Big Two-Row sweetness and sharp Pils malt upfront, followed by sugary esters and typical Unibroue phenolics. There is some lemongrass, and peach fruitiness in the back, coupled with a strong earthy yeast character that segues into a mellow but full noble hop flavor/bitterness. The hop presence is probably not needed to balance the taste given the drying alcohol and spiciness in the aftertaste, but is a nice accent to an already complex melange of flavors. The body is very thinned-down from presumably viscous and highly carbonated. The crisp mouthfeel is lively and works well with the Unibroue house yeast, but it also helps off-set the considerable residual sweethess left over, as well as lift some of the phenols before they become obtrusive. This ale posesses all the delicate flavors I have found in other Unibroue beers, but is less abbrasive in its alcohol perception with a less aggressive yeast pattern. The finish is surprisingly managable given the strength, probably one of the most drinkable BSPA I've tried. Easy to see why this is the most popular Unibroue ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,kwakwhore,4.48,"Pale golden color with a white head which sticks around for a while and sticks to the glass. Some apple in the aroma mixed in with hops and alcohol. The first taste is amazing, as good as anything I've had in ages. Apple, spice, a little bit of hop bitterness, some yeast. Very refreshing and thirst quenching for such a strong beer. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy with some nice carbonation on the tongue. I haven't had this beer in a long time, but it was worth the wait. I would add some more to this review, but the more I drink the harder it is to write coherently. So I'll just leave it at this. This is one of the world's really great beers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,clemtig76,4.5,"This beer pours a beautiful pale gold color. Strong alcohol aroma with hints of spice and apple along with yeast, malt and some hops. Taste is well balanced with hints of apple, banana, clove, malt and yeast with that alcohol finish. At 9%, very drinkable but not for the faint of heart either. Complex and absolutely delicious. An outstanding Belgian ale!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Halcyondays,4.15,"12 oz. bottle  A: Cloudy yellow with a huge amt. of white foam.  S: Apples, oranges, lemon.  T: Much of the same as in the smell, with that great Unibroue yeast ester character.  M: A little on the thin side for me for this style of beer, very spritzy when a little colder.  D: Fair, due to the high alcohol and the complexity, but still a very good brew from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,MMansfield,3.97,"Shared a tall corked bottle with some friends on Canada Day.  Appearance: Pours a pale, unfiltered golden colour with a medium off white head. Settles to a thin, lacey layer.  Aroma: Heavy notes of candied fruits such as apricots and citrus, some cloves, light hints of vanilla, spicy hops and typical belgian style yeasty smells.  Taste: Quite sweet, candied fruit, some butter scotch and vanilla, light hints of aged bourbon. Finish is long and mellow, a grapefruit bitterness reaches the back of your tounge, followed but a nice Jim Beam-like alcohol warmth.  Mouthfeel: Sharp & fizzy, light bodied, but a pleasure.  Final Statement: A very well put together Belgian styled pale. A good drink, pretty high drinkability for the style. My favourite from this brewer, which means a lot because they're a very respectable company. Top Notch!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,saintwarrick,4.5,"Always a fan favorite, though I had yet to see all the buzz. I always tasted a mile astringent and metallic taste with this brew and thought everyone was crazy for liking this brew. I got that same taste this time, but I let it warm up a bit and the good flavors finally came out.  This brew pours a light gold, with a perfect 10 head into my Unibroue tulip glass. Aromas are light citric fruits, figs, honey, malted grains and a dash of brown sugar in there. The taste is also light, the alcohol is hiding well out of sight, with citrus fruits dominating the palate. The finish is pretty smooth with a slight bite as it goes down. Yes, definitely a top-notch brew from those crazy Canadians.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,John_M,4.37,"The beer pours a hazy yellow gold color with incredible head retention and outstanding lacing. The beer is very complex on the nose, with a sweet overture of coconut, mango, and citrus. Very impressive. On the palate this beer is simply delicious. It's sweet, but not overly so, and is not the least bit heavy of cloying. I get flavors of honey melon, cherry, mango and vanilla. The beer has a mouthfilling presence, and finishes with a smooth, lingering finish. The abv. is noticeable, but not overly so, and the beer is quite drinkable considering it's 9% alcohol.  An altogether excellent beer from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jjayjaye,4.15,"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color with a large wispy white head that fades fairly quickly, Some lacing observed.  The smell is slightly sour at first. Malty, mild lemon citrus, banana and spice.  Light bodied, the creamy mouth feel brought on by an interesting carbonation adds a nice complexity and complements the light fruity flavor and slightly spicy character. It finishes clean without being dry.  The 9% ABV is hidden well in the flavors and mouth feel, but i tend to notice it in the chest and it's warming things up on the way down.  Good drinker. Recommended. I can see this as a ""gateway beer"" into the more sour beverages i see more experienced tasters seem to have a thing for.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mooseisloose,4.02,"Bottle smell is very earthy hopped with slight molasses and spices. Into my chalice it pours to a very cloudy pale yellow. The head is plentiful but dissappears quickly.. Mouthfeel is tremendous. The high AC is very evident. The carbonation is high but is a good compliment to the heartiness of this brew. The intial tartness and spicy taste is followed by a neutral bitterness. This is the closest thing to a good homebrew that i've ever had. A good starter beer but the drinkability will be low due the extremely high AC. Con cuidado, this brew will knock your socks off.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bosco7,4.67,"Loud pop when corked. Never get tired of that sound.  Massive foamy crown with a hazy pale orange color. I've seen better lacing.  Biscuit, soap, pear, apple, yeasty spice, lemon zest, slight alcohol,  Nice flash of biscuity-malty-soapy flavors in the start that quickly evolves to fruitier flavors on the palate which includes green apple, pear, pineapple, lemon zest, and a touch of orange pulp. The finish is quite spicey (nutmeg and coriander come to mind) with earth yeast flavors. Complex!  High attenuation leaves a light bodied beer that is so refreshing. Prickly yet delicate carbonation.  This is a great beer that always finds it's way into my refridgerator. Pairs well with pesto and salmon.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,onehomesickalien,3.95,"I have become quite fond of most Unibroue beers and this is no exception. I tend to lean to more dark styles, but this one has a very rich flavor. I will definitely have this one again, and again.  A - Nice golden/yellow haze looking beer. I thought it had a better head retention than some previous reviews. I sipped this one for an hour and it kept it's head all the way down.  S - Leaned a bit yeast/malt with a citrus and alcohol overtone.  T - Fairly complex. Apple, citrus and a fairly strong clove taste reminiscent of Victory's Golden Monkey but more balanced. Alcohol is strong, but intense flavors balance everything out.  M - Perfect feel and carbonation. Very nice.  D - Exceptional taste but a bit flavorful and strong to be drunk in quantity.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,adowney523,4.34,Drank from a Belgian-style chalice poured from a 750 mL bottle.  Appearance is golden-orange and hazy. The white head fades quickly.  Smells yeasty with faint alcohol and candy sweetness along with a touch of citrus fruit.  The malt on this beer is rather doughy. Lighter fruit flavors include apricot. There are some phenols apparent along with a alcohol kick in the finish.  Quite a complex and enjoyable ale.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,atuite,3.98,Bought a four pack of bottles for 9.99 at a local liquor store-wanted a beer with a kick. This beer has a great appearance with a dishwater/cloudy gold appearance and thick head after intial pour that dissipates slowly with medium bubbles. Strong citrus malt smell. Taste is not bad for alcohol content and flavors mimic the scents but a background bitterness that leaves a slight aftertaste (usually killed after having the second one. The mouth feel is near perfect and it is easily drinkable but be wary if all you wanted was a two beer buzz b/c it goes down easy and it's kick is hard. Will buy again.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bjoyce12,4.5,"Delightful. Unibroue is one of, if not the premium brewery in North America, IMHO, and La Fin is their premiere brew. Pours a cloudy golden, good lasting foam. Aroma contains tinges of apple, citrus, some lemon. Taste is crisp, clean, excellent fruitiness without cloying sweetness, light. Tasty and drinkable. Excellent paired with a meal of fish or chicken. The best feature of this ale is the way it covers a complete taste spectrum without heaviness or leaden weightiness. Unibroue's Maudite and Trois Pistoles are both close seconds.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,StargherKing,4.08,"This is certainly an interesting beer. Right off the bat, it pours out of the bottle like champagne in a movie-scene. Once poured, it's a gorgeous golden color, with a fluffy white head. Smell is sweet, hints of caramel, a bit of floral hops, and a rather strong scent of spice. Taste is very much the same, with the caramel coming out a bit more, the spice holding it's own, and the hops taking a definite backseat to the sweet fruity flavor (apple/banana? this one's hard to pin down). Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, and it goes down smooth. Drinkability is a bit TOO good for such a high ABV, this one is very easy to overdrink with. Despite that, it's still a great beer, and I look forward to having it quite a bit more in the future.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,lonestar4lunch,4.05,"""The end of the World"".. Nice. This is a beer I could drink all night. The 9% hides from you until the end. Crisp bite at the end is wonderful. It literary bellowed out of the bottle. Nice, thick head that left soap like stains on the glass. Smells of yeast and fruit. I had this beer about 5 years ago and forgot how good it really is. My favorite so far from Unibroue. More to come!! 750ml",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Homer27,3.58,"A - Nice long lasting head. Good lacing S - Like smelling a boquet of flowers. This is like nothing I've tried before. T - Initially very strong taste of caramel and then almost something like rosehips whacking you in the face. More floral than any beer I've tried and almost overpowering. I found myself thinking...did they pour perfume in this? I couldn't get past this. However, for 9% ABV, this was very clean. M - Moderately creamy, quite carbonated. D - Not bad but the overpowering rose flavor may tire.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Monkeyknife,4.33,"Poured from the bottle a beautiful, hazy medium yellow with a long-lasting creamy head. Lacing was heavy.  Aroma was floral, spicy, and citrus all together.  Some spice and sweetness almost like a banana candy. Finishes with a bit of maltiness.  Smooth and creamy with some warmth from the alcohol.  They've done this style well. It reminds me of Chimay and Duvel. Enjoy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Sweet but refreshing.  M- Crisp, clean, light, smooth, and refreshing.  D- Quite good, especially because of the light body and thoroughly refreshing nature.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,neenerzig,4.35,"I wanted to review this again because it was one of the first beers I ever reviewed for this site. My attention to detail in beers has certainly grown immensely since I first reviewed this beer in early May of 2006. Also, it was exactly 6 years ago this day, Friday June 1st 2001 that I graduated high school, so I thought drinking this fantastic beer would be a good way to help remember that great occasion. I hope all my former classmates are doing very well. I am still good friends with a few of them today and a few of them also have a fine appreciation for great beers! Anyways, a 12 oz bottle poured into an oversized wine glass. This beer pours a cloudy, hazy medium golden color with an orange hue. The head was about 1/3 inch thick when poured. It quickly settled to a good surface cover film layer with a nice white ring lining the inside of the glass. Pretty good lacing here. Aromas of malt, citrus and sweet spice fill the nostrils upon taking a whiff. Sweet, spice, and citrus flavors are all present. Very good indeed! This beer has a very crisp and smooth mouthfeel. A full body with pretty heavy carbonation. As I said the first time I reviewed this, do not drink too fast or much burping will surely ensue! This beer is the first offering is I ever reviewed from Unibroue and may also be the beer I ever tried from them. It was either this or Trois Pistole or Don De Dieu in January of 2006, a few weeks before I became a member of this wonderful website. Regardless, this beer is one of the best Belgian style ales I have ever drank. It is very drinkable. You don't even know the 9% ABV is there until you start to feel it after a few sips. I will drink this beer again and again!  Eric",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mobius024,4.35,"I agree with a previous poster that Unibroue needs some help with their packaging. I've seen these bottles on the rack in Wegman's for a while, but there just wasn't a vibe to pull me in. Then they went on sale. Holy Moly!  First off, the cork blows out of these babes like they were champagne. The pour is exceptional, beautiful foggy gold with a serious, off-white, cratered head (from those big, healthy bubbles) that hangs around quite a while. Thick lacing. As I have noted, childhood allergies completely screwed my sense of smell, but the fruitiness couldn't be missed. Maybe raspberries. I can't really say, but if I can smell it, it's there. The mouth feel is full, plenty of carbonation, though it sure doesn't get in the way. It seems like every taste bud is located and activated, lingering and lingering, kicking up the initial rush. Yeasty, but not in your face; some sweetness, but not at all cloying. It's a little peppery on the tongue, and closes with a nice warmth; pleasant, rather calm for a 9% ABV. Everything fits so nicely in this beer. If it were female, it would be powerful, sultry, and smooth. At the top of the pale ale pile. I'll be drinking this a bunch ...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,HugoGrim,4.73,"This is simply a beautiful looking beer. Great foamy head which remains for the long haul. Lots of visible carbonation.  Full aroma of Belgian spices, with only the slightest hints of alcohol.  The flavor is excellently balanced. Heavily spiced, but not overly so. Thick malts lend some sweetness which pairs perfectly with the spices and the light bitterness of the hops. Ends with a bit of a dry finish.  Very, very smooth and surprisingly drinkable at 9%.  Until recently I had been a bit reluctant to try Unibroue's beers due to the majority of their labels looking like art from a cheesy death metal album, however the adage of not judging a book by it's cover has never been more true. There is no doubt I will be trying this beer again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jwc215,4.69,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip glass:  Pours clouded golden with a large white head that soon fizzles away.  The smell is of orange peel, frangrant spices, floral, bready notes in the back. Alcohol adds a touch of pepper.  Incredibly delicious! Sweet malt mixes with perfumy spiciness - orange peel, clove...touch of peppery alcohol gives it a warming finish but is so well-balanced that it is not raw, harsh or interfering.  Smooth and creamy, the taste lingers after a long, dry finish.  Very drinkable despite the high abv. One of the world's great beers, IMO.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Lots of banana and cloves, spices tingle the tongue again. A sweet alcohol kick as the aftertaste linger, very well balanced between flavours and alcohol  M- high carbonation, but very creamy  D- a fine brew but dare i say i prefer delirium tremens.

22,34,Contra,4.37,"After being extremely impressed with Trois Pistoles, I had to try some other Unibroue beers. While I prefer Trois Pistoles, La Fin Du Monde is of the same high caliber.  La Fin Du Monde is a very cloudy beer, with a thin lacy head (once it settles). Definitely yeasty, sweet, but with a clove tinge. A luxuriously creamy thickness, which is just what you want for the style.  La Fin Du Monde screams Belgium, straight from the heart of... Canada? Well, with a name like La Fin Du Monde, made it screams ""French-Canadian done in a Belgian style"". But that doesn't sound quite as sexy. I don't care. It's excellent under any name.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jessecollins,4.67,Excellent high ABV beer. Two of these will definitely start off your evening. Has some wonderful spices and a noticable citrus flavor.  A possible downside for some drinkers is that you can definitely taste alchohol and it is quite dry. Normally I can only handle a few of these before I move to something different for the evening.  I would highly recommend this beer and most other beers from Unibroue.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,willjschmidt,4.12,Poured from a 750ml bottle into my La Fin Du Monde glass.  A: The hue is that of a pale golden color. Each subsequent pour results in a cloudier appearance due to the yeast releasing from the bottom of the bottle. A huge off-white head forms on the beer and mushrooms up through the neck of the glass. The head takes quite a while to subside but when it does it leaves behind quite a bit of lacing.  S: Sweet ripe light fruits followed by quite a bit of alcohol aroma.  T: The initial taste is that of slightly sweet ripe fruits from the malts. There is also quite a bit of yeast in there as well. Also some complex flavors from some light spices and floral accents. This is all followed by a lot of warming alcohol.  M: Active carbonation along with a lightly syrupy body.  D: This is a rather drinkable brew but the alcohol gets you in the end. A very potent beer and a very good example of the Belgian strong pale ale.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Poor head retention. Leaves a very small amount of lace.  Tastes spicy. Alcohol is definitely detected on the palate. Fruity, oranges. Some flavour of cloves.  Fairly gassy. A bit crisp & prickly on the tongue at first, but then it gets creamy & smooth. The alcohol gives it a warming feeling.  Overall, I like it very much. However, due to it's high ABV (9%) I would not suggest to drink too many of these in one sitting if you would like to keep your composure.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Definitely has a strong herbal spice kick. I can't place it exactly (perhaps clove?). There is a bit of maltiness present. Light hops are also noticeable. Last, but not least, it has a definite yeasty taste which leaves a biscuity aftertaste.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied and perfect for a hot day. Pretty drinkable considering it's 9%.

The aroma is has notes of citrus and alcohol, but its strongest characteristic is the aroma that all Unibroue beers possess, it must be their proprietary yeast.  Some orange, some banana, some alcohol, some carbonation are all found in the flavor. A subtle warming sensation from the alcohol too as the beer hits the stomach.  Mouthfeel has a bit of heft in the center of the tongue with some very distinct crispness around the edges of the mouth.  This is an extremely drinkable beer. Its 9.0% alcohol content by volume makes it one that you wouldn't want to drink all day, but this is a damn solid beer. Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Rudgers73,3.9,"Beer #2 of my 11 aged Unibroue beers. This has been in my father's basement.  Age - 1.17 years  Pale, yellowish-orange color. Lots of darker sediment. Vigorous carbonation rising in specific vertical trails. Smaller head that settles to a light white covering. The aroma is very round and full. Vanilla, banana, mild yeast, and orange peel. The taste begins as a tart citrusy-hop bite followed by a crispy, spicy yeast flavor. The end has a slight alcohol zip, heightened by the fizzy carbonation. The full, malty background has degraded a bit which lets the complex cloves, citrus zest, and hops to take the front seat. The finish seems to be a bit drier as well. The mouthfeel is much lighter and less sticky than I've had before, increasing the drinkability, but reducing the mouthfeel. Overall, I'd say that this beer is in the infant stages of cellaring. The aroma is shifting, the mouthfeel has become more prickly, the beer is starting a noticeable change. It is taking on a very Champagne-ish characteristic.  Join me in about a year for bottle #3... ---  Well, year 2 is here. This bottle is 2.07 years young.  Poured into a flute this beer is very clear now. Deep golden color with an inch head that settles quickly to a half. Very active carbonation maintains the head. The smell is dry, tart, and appley. That round and mellow yeast presence is very limited as the bottle has been sitting uninterrupted for a solid 7 months. I am amazed that there is not one bit of lees or sediment in my pour. Absolutely crystal clear. The taste is becoming more like a saison in that it is dry and peppery with a metallic tone. The rich citrus fruit aspect has gone mostly away and I am left with a sweet white-wine-ish and mild dry beer. I taste what might be very slight oxidation with a noticed bit of papery tone at the end. I will make a decision next year about the future of the rest of the case. If it starts to get cardboardy, I will have a party and get rid of it.  See you again in about a year for bottle #4.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Takes a good while before it dies down to a good lacing with quite a bit of stickiness. Smell is definitely a fluffy yeast with bananas and a smokey scent as well. A tiny hint of alcohol seems to tingle the nose as well. Taste has nice balance between the clovey yeast and the mandarine hop flavoring. A bit of metallic tingles in the mouth as well. Alcohol flavor is present but not overpowering at all, finishes somewhat dry. Mouthfeel is creamy with high carbonation. They make this beer very drinkable for this style at 9%.

Again, very strong and interesting for a Belgian-style Pale Ale. At 9%, very drinkable and not quite for the faint of heart either. Complex, yet delicious.

Since the head is full of popping larger bubbles it gives off a wonderful smell, especially at the beginning.  T: A wonderful taste reminiscent of an exceptional home brew (probably in part due to the yeast base refermentation. The beer is sweet with a citrus-like aftertaste. Tastes similar to the best hefeweizen you might have tried.  M: It is actually fun to drink. At each sip, the aforementioned bubbles 'explode' in your mouth releasing the full flavor in the mouth.  D: Due to a high ABV of 9% and the rich and brilliant flavors, this is a beer to enjoy while smoking a pipe, but not one to take to a college party.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The taste is very light on the tongue with a hint of ginger and sweet alcohol as pointed out before. What impressed me the most about this brew was its drinkability and mouthfeel. This feels like a slightly flat champagne and ends very crisp. This drinks like a normal beer but has twice the alcohol. Very nice.

Belgian yeast,pepper,my girl mentioned ginger also.some chalkyness.  Some lemon zest,some orange,hops,yeast,pepper. in the taste  Mouthful is sweet and a tad syrupy.some tang with the carbonation.

22,34,BuckSpin,4.28,"Presentation: 11oz bottle (Best By date of 10/4/08), cellared 9 months in my possession, in a small snifter.  Poured rather silently and with some ""chug"" attitude. Rich, spicy nose. Faint clove, wet rocks, straw. As it warms it grows in sweet fruit qualities like apple, pear, even banana, as well as some honey. Head was a lively, snapping 2 fingers of think, clingy, pale ivory foam that lasted quite a while, eventually only fading to a mere finger's worth of the same that laced in ribbons. A cloudy, thick, golden honey amber hue, a large amount of sediment is present in almost chunky, thick pieces. A crazy parade of bubbles rises fiercely from the snifter base. Visually this is a looker.  Great balance between spicy, dry & sweet, syrupy malts. Clove bites, the hops dryly nibble, the syrup like sweet malts coat...a very pleasing mouthfeel. Its interesting that the caramelized malts take on more of a sugar syrup quality than caramel. Faint apple is noticeable as well.  The flavor shifts to a semi-dry, ciderlike crunch & feel on the palate, with a more bitter quality taking the point, yet I swear I feel a hint of cotton candy...yet another gear shift! Its still a little spicy and the peppery bite of the alcohol warms up....literally. All this said, it is going down almost alarmingly easy. The finish is warm & cozy as the tastes all meld and the 9% ABV finishes that warm up and comes alive in a mouth glow of heat that not so much tickles the teeth as it numbs them from the roots down. The aftertaste is a surprisingly malty sweetness, still a wee bit spicy, chewy, yet not filmy nor coating. Its almost like a fine pastry that once was.  This was a rather complex and excellent offering. A variety of tastes experiences, sensations, ebbs & flows, etc. made for a great beer experience. Be warned that it does drink much easier than the high ABV it is. I would definitely drink this again, and would recommend it to anyone.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,PittBeerGirl,4.36,"A-cloudy pale yellow with thick white head. great retention.  S-some yeast, citrus and spices.  T-great blend of citrus and spices with a backgroud of yeast. Clean finish. Alcohol is barely noticable.  M- high carbonation and fairly thick body. goes down pretty smooth  D- I can't tell this is 9% ABV and it is very delicious. I will try this one again. Another great offering from Unibroue",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,PhiloPsych,3.93,Hazy straw yellow out of the bottle. Not much head. Lots of bubbles continuously rise. Aroma is bready and strongly sweetly alcoholic. Flavor is tart and sweet and bready in the finish. In looks and taste this beer is very reminiscent of a Hefeweizen. After warming there is a slight buttery wine-like flavor up front. Some citrus notes also start to come out as it warms.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,guitarmage,4.41,"Appearance: Pours a cider golden with a soda like carbonation, bubbling up is a white head that dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. Slight chill haze, a lot of active bubbles.  Smell: Big fruity esters, banana, green apple, cloves, also a little floral, also some wheatiness.  Taste: Great citrus sweetness, tart, mango flavors, alcohol warms up the palette and the nose, cloves and spice and dry finish with a grapefruit rind finish.  Mouthfeel: Smooth rolling carbonation, beer coats the mouth, finishes semi dry.  Drinkability: Tasty Belgian ale, very drinkable, a lot of fruity flavor packed into this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jmalex,4.5,"Unibroue may very well be my favorite brewery, and ever since I was first blown away by Trois Pistoles, I've gone back to their beers ever since. Tonight will be my first La Fin Du Monde in quite awhile though. I can't wait.  APPEARANCE: Poured (fittingly) into my Unibroue tulip. Pale golden straw in color with slight orange highlights. A rocky white head sits atop but falls somewhat quickly to just a fraction of itself. The half inch head that remains holds very well though, and tops the beer off nicely. No lacing to speak of, however.  SMELL: The smell is of pungent Belgian yeast along with citrus (predominantly orange), coriander and spice, golden raisin, and barely, some leafy hop aromas. The breadiness overpowers the other aromas ever so slightly, but overall, this beer smells great.  TASTE: Starts very bready, but the malt quickly shines with a prominent caramelness. Intense hiccups of sweet orange occasionally pop up. The finish is a little on the dry side but retains the yeasty and malty sweetness.  MOUTHFEEL: A sharp carbonation greets you at first sip and develops into a creamy medium-full body. Just right.  DRINKABILITY: Very easy. The dryness hinders it just a bit, but you wouldn't guess 9%, so it hides it fairly well. This is the perfect beer for a mild spring evening like tonight.  La Fin Du Monde really holds its own in the Belgian Strong Pale category despite the serious competition at the top. I will absolutely revisit this beer again and again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,InsolublePancake,4.5,"A- Hazy gold with a gigantic fluffy white head. Chunks of lacing stick to the sides of the glass as the head ever so slowly dissipates. A big column of bubbles rises constantly from the bottom of my Duvel tulip to join that massive head. A sight to behold.  S- Very yeasty. Tart lemon and lime smells come up to greet the nose. Sweet malt backs the yeast to create a near heavenly aroma.  T- Oh yeah, that's the stuff. More sweet malt with that fantastic yeast character. Clove melds with those sweet citrus flavors to create a wonderful taste. A bit of a metallic flavor comes into play at times, although the alcohol does not. Next to no bitterness on the finish, although a little might have been nice in order to balance out the sweetness. Not that I'm complaining...  M- Carbonation is high but not too high; mouthfeel is light to medium and fluffy, but also a little creamy at times.  D- Very high. The only thing limiting it is the high alcohol. And maybe the sweetness a little bit.  Fantastic beer. With my admittedly brief experience with Belgian-style ales, I have to say that I've come to the conclusion that not much beats a great BSPA. This one is fantastic. Highly, highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,StarSAELS,4.07,"Ordered at Taco Mac in Peachtree City, GA.  Unbelievable. The two friends I was with were looking for guidance and in the mood for something hoppy, so I pointed them at Rogue Dead Guy Ale. I initially ordered a different Abbey ale, but they were out of it, so I looked at La Fin du Monde and said, ""Sure, I'll try that for $5!"" Unbelievable.  A: Pours a cloudy whitish yellow with a thick, yeasty, off-white head that just wouldn't go down. Swirling the yeast at the bottom and pouring it into the tulip reinforced the head with a rich, almost syrupy foam. I couldn't let all of that fall into the beer. I took a little taste of it. Freakin' awesome!  S: So good I made everybody else at the table smell the spicy hops and fruity malts and the lemony-orangey citrus. This serving got its fair share of swirling,let me tell you...  T: Man, with the hops and the malts battling it out, they made quite a ruckus on the ol' taste and olfactory senses. The flavor is well-balanced and subtle. It's like watching a show with so much going on that you have to watch it two or three times before you see everything. That yeasty goodness and wild spices delicately mask the 9% abv. You don't taste it, but you feel it when you stand up!  M: Smoothy and creamy, a long dry finish that became a little more bitter and a bit drier as the beer warmed.  D: Put this on my Wants list...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,fank2788,4.63,"12oz bottle marked best before 11/09 served in a snifter This beer pours a very nice pale straw gold color with a thick 2 finger pure white head. The head falls a bit but can be quickly called back by swirling the glass leaving tons of lace. The smell is dominated by the Unibroue yeast with a bit of summer fruit underneath. There seems to be three separate taste ""phases"" with this beer. First there is a lot of sweetness with orange and tangerine flavors. Second, a good deal of bitterness from the hops and a touch of warmth from the alcohol is noticed, both of these flavors are subtle but they do enough to balance the sweetness. Lastly, I get nice tart lemon along with a bit of grain and peppery spice. A bit of clove and banana are present throughout. The mouthfeel is good medium body with lively carbonation, a powdery dry finish and a pleasant aftertaste. Drinkability ranks very high interesting complexity with hidden alcohol makes this highly quaffable. If the end of the world were imminent I would be drinking a few of these.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,tempest,3.8,"This is a pretty nice beer, don't get me wrong, but I've tried it numerous times and still don't think it lives up to the hype. It's pretty with a tall white head and hazy straw yellow body.It smelled sweet and spicy (corriander) with a similar flavor. I just find the flavor to fall flat, I get some, but not a great complexity out of it. Still, it's very easy to drink and with little hint of the alcohol. I'd probably go for Duvel instead of this though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,pmcadamis,4.85,"Got this at Brewhaus in downtown Springfield. Served in the bottle with a small footed pint glass...I like how they let you pour your own beer the way that you want.  A - Awesome 12 oz bottle with a picture of what I at first thought was Pangaea, but then realized that La Fin Du Monde means ""the end of the world"" sop why would they put a picture of the beginning of the world on the bottle. Turns out it's actually a disembodied picture of Quebec. As for the beer, it's a creamy golden hue that is very hazy and supports a nice thick 2 finger white head. The head is very tight looking as stays around for the duration.  S - Dark fruits, honey, dusty yeast, outdoorsy aromas, and melon. Gloriously complex and very typically ""Belgian.""  T - Honey drenched melons, dates, and cantaloupe. Yeasty powdery outdoorsy flavors clearly identify this as a Belgian style beer. Soft and round hop profile keeps things from getting too sweet...although this is markedly sweeter than Duvel. I don't taste any alcohol whatsoever. This is remarkably tasty.  M - Extremely full and thick in the mouth....like honey. Chewy and dusty with moderate carbonation helping to further increase the sensation of fullness. No hint of the whopping 9 & ABV either.  D - Excellent. If it weren't for the high price tag, I would drink this all the time. 9% be damned...this thing did kick my ass at the end of the night however, so watch out.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,micahgoldfus,4.22,"Poured a delicious looking golden yellow, with 2 finger of head, which dissolved quickly, leaving no lace on top. A great smell, floral and fruity, but not quite as fruity as an average weiss. Tasted as good as it smelled: delicious, fruity, with banana taste and orange hint, sugary/yeasty. At first taste, I thought it was slightly too carbonated. But as I drank it, the bubbly texture really started to compliment the tangy taste, leaving a sharp impression on my tongue. No taste of alcohol anywhere. A well crafted beer, leaving me a very happy drinker.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Gorgeous  S-Bread and oranges. a perfume like alcohol level permeates the nose. This smells divine.  T-Sweet sugars first glance the tongue followed up by a wonderful dryness. There is also a certain hint of sourness and umami. This hits all areas of the tongue. Notes of pepper, coriander, allspice can be detected. Despite this being strong I cannot detect the alcohol. I also do not taste banana or clove like in some of the others of this style yet there is still a distinctive yeasty pholic taste.  M-Super creamy and yet at the same time light. It glides through the mouth.  D- This one is dangerously good. This might just be my desert island beer. I was wowed by this back in 1996 and I am wowed by it now. A masterpiece.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,rec,4.07,"A hazy yellow body is presented by the pour, with a foamy white head that dissipates quickly but laces better than either of the other Unibroue offerings.  Clove and spice come through on the nose once again, the difference being the strength of the citrus and additional scents. Yeast and orange peel, perhaps even bananna are evident. It actually smells very similar to some actual Belgian Pale Ales such as Duvel.  Not suprisingly in this case, it tastes much like it smells. It's not quite as sweet as La Chouffe, and not quite as alchohol heavy as Delirium Tremens but still warms in the aftertaste. I'm not entirely happy with the level of carbonation, unfortunately for my tastes it does suit this style of brew.  Despite it's alchohol content, I'd actually consider it a session beer as it's very easy to drink. I'm not sure how long you would be coherent for at 9%, but up until that moment of black-out, you'd be enjoying every sip.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

This is mixed with a ""funny"" smell that I am only qualified to describe with the words ""Belgian"" and ""good"". There was also a spicy element to the smell. Starts with strong apricot flavor mixing with citrus and banana. The flavor profile moves to spice and finishes dry with some alcohol sneaking in at the end. The mouthfeel is kept light with the moderate to high carbonation.  This beer is very drinkable and enjoyable, especially given the alcohol level. A great and well-crafted example of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Tried to keep yeast sediment in the bottle, but some snuck up on me - no matter - it settles out into the bottom of the glass quickly.  Aromas of fruit, earthy belgian funk, and a bit medicinal. A hint of spice, but nothing overwhelming.  Such a delicious flavor. Noted clove right away. Alcohol is noticeable, but never more than a faint warming. There is ample fruit in the form of apple, citrus, and I think apricot. There is plenty of sweetness, but a nice hop lightly bittering hop flavor balances this out nicely. Nice!  Great carbonation on the high side of medium and relatively thick/full bodied mouthfeel. Nearly defines smooth and creamy.  I'd have a hard time finding something of this style/strength combination that is also this drinkable. In a word: 5",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mikesgroove,4.62,"This was fantastic. Poured a deep hazy and very light amber with a big white frothy head. Quick fade left behind a nice quarter inch layer of head on top and nice lace down the glass. Smell was very alive, lots of figs and pears with hints of raisin and plum. Lots of carbonation gave this a great feel and only served to punctuate the great flacors. Lots of light fruitness here, again peachs, pears, figs, hints at nutmeg and some grape. Extrodinarily drinkable, with no hint whatsoever of the big alchol in this. Quite possibly one of my all time favorite belgian style ales. This was fantastic. Nothing over the top, just crafter perfectly. I would highly recommend this to anyone.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Oh yeah...lots of bubbles. S- Tart citrus(orange, lemon, grapefruit), light white candy sugars, and slight bit of spice(almost orange peel or lemon peel and a corriander like a white beer, but not as potent in the spice department...very refreshing effect). T- Slightly tart citrusy hops in the forefront of the sip....smooth slightly sweet body...sugars definitely seem to be present(I hate to compare with in the style, but not nearly as sweet as La Chouffe)...a bit of orange an spice near the finish, and a long dry slightly alcoholic finish. M/D- Very light on the pallet, lots of bubbles, and smooth....Easy to drink, with the alcohol hidden well....A great beer to turn people on to Belgians with...easy to see why it is rated in the top of its style....again I really should have started drinking Unibroue a long time ago...great beer at great prices.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Not much in the way of the lacing department. The smell is of all things that make up a Belgian Ale, spicy and sweet, a nice powerful aroma. The taste is of orange peel, tartness of granny smith apples, cloves, Belgian yeast. The feel is moderate and well carbonated, champagne like. A very flavorful ale and worthy of another purchase.

The head retention and lacing is very good.  The aroma is of banana, apple and vanilla that is full on strong and aromatic. This ale has a very distinct and wonderful floral bouquet, to steal a description from some fine wines.  The flavor is an apple tartness and lingering hop spiciness. I detect some other fruits in there too, maybe raisins. The mouthfeel is bold, with a full body accompanied by very nice tartness and tanginess.

Other BA members of the Bar Talk Group told me to give it another try, so here it goes...  Poured into my Duvel tulip glass, hey the beer looks a lot more clear than the last one I had...nice head that fizzled down quick and no real lacing, just some ""spotting"".  The last bottle I had I said smelled like ""La Feet Du Maude"" because of the funky musty odor. This glass smells of yeast, clove and a hint of alcohol.  Holy Crap!... this is a real good tasting beer!  It is very nice. Good amount of carbonation, nice rich bready yeast taste on the palate and a warming of alcohol at the finish.  This is drinkable. 9% abv might slow down some, but I'm on my 3rd of 4 (I was going to cellar 1...ha, it'll be gone in another 10 minutes) and tomorrow I'll get more!

22,34,Mickelswit,4.35,"Best before February 2009. I cellared this one for about nine months before popping it open.  Pours light and hazy, almost as light as a macro lager but with a redder tinge. The head is fluffy and enormous, eventually reducing to about a quarter inch. Bubbles continue to rise in the beer. There is a touch of lacing.  Smells first of yeast and then orange. A light, refreshing aroma.  Taste is mellow, again citrus, with just a breath of hops for balance. There is a bit of spice in the aftertaste - peppery, a faint hint of alcohol. I would never guess that this is 9% ABV. In a blind taste test, I might mistake this for a saison.  Mouthfeel is unique. The carbonation level is perfect - low at first, allowing the orange juice flavors to come through, but swallowing the beer releases a prickly burst of the pepper note down the tongue and throat.  This beer does not allow itself to be guzzled. It forces you to take it in small sips, allowing for nice waves of flavor. Exceptional.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Decent lacing.  smell equal parts fruit (another reviewer said appricot and I'd agree), spicy yeastiness, and booze.  Wow..lotsa of complex flavour here..a quick fruit sweetness, the ABV, and the a wash of flavour on the palate..cloves, fruit( but not appricot) and ending with a dry citrus. Very effective in masking the ABV.  Once the carbonation settles down, this brew has a smooth but boozey mouthfeel..but in a nice warming vs. bad listerine way.  Would have scored higher on the drinkability scale..but I'm thinking more than 2 is a tough sled.  No wonder the German's lost the war..sitting on their arses drinking beer like this in Belgium, would take the fighting edge off of any soldier...a great Canadian brew..OK Quebec..we'll let you stay so long as we can get this brew 'out west'.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

You can taste some pineapple, orange, lemon in the mix. The white pepper, cloves and allspice balance the citrus nicely. This is a nicely balanced yet sweet beer.  Mouthfeel: Smooth but syrupy.

The taste at first could also be a bit deceiving in that it has a natural carbonation that is refreshing and clean. This beer is not your typical hefe in that it is quite a bit stronger, has much more of a bite, a stronger mouth feel, may be a little sweeter, and retains its natural carbonation a little longer than a typical hefe would. This is a very good beer, very enjoyable, and one that I would go back to again. You can't go wrong with this one. The brewery makes quality beers, and Fin Du Monde is one of their better products.

Wheat, citrus, and tart alcohol notes pull through. Mouthfeel is juicy and smooth, very carbonated throughout, with a nice strong bite on the end.

Even a ""soft"" pour produces a large fluffy white head over two inches. I have to let it settle out some which takes a while (never fully settles below 1/4 inch). Leaves some patchwork lacing.  Smell: A burst of citrus (lemony), yeasty. Some bready, biscuit malts. I definitely stirred something up because I get a lot of yeasty aroma from this beer.  Taste: Starts out with a decent maltiness, finishes with a slight hop bitterness and an alcohol zing. From start to finish and at points in between it has some yeasty undertones.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, well carbonated. Mild alcohol burn, but I expected more for a 9.0% ABV beer, so I was somewhat surprised it was as subdued as it was. Finshes a touch dry.  Drinkability: Drinkable and enjoyable in moderation. I can't imagine having more than, oh, 2 of these in a night. It's no problem putting down one, I could do another, but beyond that it gets a little dangerous due to the high ABV. Will I seek this one out again? Perhaps, but not in the immediate future.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Bookseeb,4,"A light gold in color with a nice foamy head that disapates quickly. Aroma scense of honey, fruit, a difinate belgian style. A spike of carbonation releasing fruity flavors and a note of cloves, having a light - med mouthfeel. A very good beer for the style it portrays.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

A little lacing that doesn't last long either.  Smell: I get apples and pears, alcohol smell is present as well.  Taste: Very fruity, I could smell the alcohol, but in my opinion it's almost undetectable to the taste. A tad on the sweet side.  Mouthfeel: One of my favorite attributes of this beer is how it feels in my mouth. It fills it up. Feels heavy but very smooth.  Drinkability: I would have this beer again. Drinking mostly American pale ales, the Belgian strong ales are pretty new to me. But I loved every one I tried so far. At 7.99 a 4 pack, I think it's a steal.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with good carbonation.  Drinkability: This is a MUST try for Belgian Strong Pale Ale lovers! It leaves you wanting another.

22,34,Gaisgeil,4.37,"""The End of the World""  This is a very intriguing beer possessing a lot of what I like about Belgians and little of what I do not. This beer pours a slightly cloudly golden/amber in color with a frothy off-white head that eventually recedes into a sticky lacing. The nose is citric in nature, a heavy scent of the trademark Unibroue yeast strainl very earthy. The taste is similar but with some delicate complexities added into the whole affair. Tangerines and sticky fruit, some mild herbal qualities and the strong yeast presence swirl into an interesting mix. Not brutal in any sense however which is what you might expect from a 9% beer. This one certainly walks a fine balance and does so extremely well. This is probably my favorite Belgian pale, extremely well done.  Slàinte!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The aroma of this brew is interesting; a touch of pineapple mixed with a bit  The flavor is complex, laced with sugars and a bit of cooked corn, which is definitely a negative. I suppose I should have had this before have a Westmalle Tripel...not a fair fight, eh? Rather sweet and almost cloying. The alcohol is fairly well hidden for this strength of beer, which adds to drinkability, but I'm still left with that cooked corn character haunting my palate that almost has me wanting me to pour this out. The Westmalle may have ruined my palate for this beer, but I'm shocked at how poorly it measures up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,paleoplant,4.56,Luckily Unibroue makes a great beer that is accessible so La Fin Du Monde is a great choice for any night. The color is exceptional: bubbly straw-colored. The smell is great with ripe fruit. The taste is crisp with a strong initial flavor. Carbonation is strong at first but it settles quickly. Drinkability... it's a beer that you can always drink even if it was the end of the world.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The head formed a good 2-3 fingers thick and faded very slowly.  Aroma: Sweet and sugary, with the familiar unibroue yeast in the background.  Taste: Spicy cloves and peppers up front, then it turns very sweet in the middle with some fruits, mainly orange. The finish starts off sweet but fades as the powdery yeast becomes dominant.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and creamy. The carbonation is very lively and fits the style well.  Overall: In my opinion, this is one of the best Belgian-style ales brewed in all of North America.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,barleywinebrewer,4.47,I've had this beer tons of times. This weekends tasting was mandated by the new stock added to the cellar. With over 800 reviews as of this writing I'm sure you can get enough descriptions. What I like about the beer is it goes with everything so well and is easily accessible to new drinkers when brought to parties.  The cellar comment is compliments of feedback enthusiastically endorsed in the cellaring forum. People speak of this aging well over up to 10 years. I'm setting down my stock to see how it goes over time as well. Looking forward to tasting this for years to come!,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Nose is a very invigorating spicey wheat mix, very floral with hints of vanilla. Smooth and zesty with amazing balance as it enters the mouth. Raw wheat with nice compliment of spice and mellow honey notes. Warms the belly well, but the alchol is very well disguised. Amazingly drinkable with a charmingly clean mouthfeel.

Mouthfeel is rich and carbonated, drinkability is surprising for a 9.0% beer.  Overall an exceptional example of the style. Very tasty, very agreeable. One of my favorites.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Smells slightly of yeast, very fruity...apricots, lemons, citrus, some other underlying tones. Flavor is very fruity and light, with a slight bite. It feels light and carbonated in your mouth, but leaves a slighty dry and lingering aftertaste of the fruits and yeasts.  Normally, i do not like these kinds of beers. It is very drinkable but is also very light, and too fruity for my tastes.  However, it was able to retain my attention and i did enjoy it. The 9% alcohol/volumne also helps alot ;)  A good beer, but I am not sure i would try it again. Fruity beers just dont do it for me, but its the best one i have had so far.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,brdc,4,"Beautiful, cloudy golden beer with a foamy white head. Smells of apricots, malts, bread and perhaps oranges. Medium to full bodied, and a pronounced taste of malts, oranges, warming alcohol with a cleansing but still mild hoppiness at the end. Dangerously easy to drink, another great Unibroue offering, but Don de Dieu is a little better, on my opinion.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BlindPig,4.15,A- A little bit cloudy golden body. Has a off white head on top. S- Nice spices in it with yeast following behind. A medium amount of malt makes it way through with a helping of dry hops to help balance it out. T- The taste starts to follow the aroma. Spices followed by a yeast. Light fruits can also be found in this along with a calm warming from the alcohol. There is a medium bitterness left in the aftertaste along with the left over fruits. M- Medium body and medium carbonation. Has champagne like bubbles mixed with this flavor. D- Very drinkable with a great complexion to it. The combination of the carbonation and the flavors just make this beer pop.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Jwaks,3.68,"This is one brew I've had a few times before with mixed experiences and results, this time, it is up for review.  I carefully poured this brew into a short tulip glass as suggested on the label. Results were stellar, revealing an appealing, nearly translucent pale-straw yellow brew with a strong, long-lasting pure white head measuring roughly three fingers. A storm of course bubbles race up to replenish the long lasting thick, rich foam. Little if any lacing is retained as the head recedes.This beer reminds me of Duvel and Val-Dieu triple. This is a very stunning, impressive and traditional look for a belgian style strong pale ale.  The tight bouquet boasts inviting aromas of spicy cinnamon, lemons, citrus peel, sweet and yeasty bread with a touch of pale malts and piney hops.  Sharp, spicy cinnamon, spiced bread, pale malts and a touch of honey hit that palate on the attack, evolving into a somewhat depressing and hallow midpalate featuring a bit of lemon zest. These sublime flavors curtail toward the finish revealing a load of spicy, warming alcohol, bitter yeast and lingering sour lemon. Balance is modest with the spicey and sour notes prevailing, lowering this brew's taste score; the citrus hops and pale malts must make a bigger impact on the flavor.  Viscosity and carbonation are quite noteworthy, this beer is a bit thick for a strong pale ale, but it is one to savor.  Cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BeerBelcher,4.06,"This is the best Belgian-style beer I've ever had that isn't from Belgium. I've had a number of the Unibroue beers, and I believe this is the best beer they brew. It is a light and effervescent tripel that pairs equally well with pizza or a more elegant meal.  It pours a straw-color with excellent tightly packed head (think Duvel). The beer is hazy, and smells lightly yeasty, like you would expect a tripel to smell.  Taste is also of yeastiness, although the flavor is not tremendously complicated like other tripels I've had. There is not a lot of spiciness. However, the taste is simple, pleasant, and the mouthfeel is very evervescent and refreshing. I really like this beer!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Spicy clove, coriander and pepper aromas on top of some subtle sweet malt notes and noble hops.  Refreshingly tart, spicy and strong. The alcohol is there, so is a bit of farm funkiness, alot of spiciness and a pleasant hop bitterness all supported by a solid malt backbone.  Light to medium bodied, and very refreshing and drinkable, but also warming. Works on s cold winter night or a hot summer morning. In a word, awesome.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,WetCoaster,4.49,"*Caged and corked 750ml  I've had this beer literally dozens of times, one of my all-time faves -- cannot BELIEVE I've never reviewed it.  Apearance: Slightly chalky, cloudy pale straw gold, with a huge puffy, pure white head. Retention is fair for the style, good overall.  Smell: Unreal; again, one of my all-timers. Cannon blast of sweet citrus, sugar cookie, yeast, allspice and clove. Strong, smooth and just so damn nice. LOVE it.  Taste: Very much like the scent. Base of sweet cake batter with pineapple, orange, lemon, white pepper, clove, allspice and everything nice. Very well blended and rich, but perhaps just a wee bit too sweet.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and a bit syrupy, but terrific carbonation level keeps it from being heavy -- nicely done.  Drinkability: Probably among the top five BSPAs made and so cheap it's just silly. Just an all-around treat, nothing to complain about and much to love. Can't recommend it highly enough.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Only around the last sip did it seem to fade.  It smells a LOT like a witbier, with citrus coming through strongly, as well as lots of yeast... alcohol bites your nose a bit, but it's generally a sweet, wonderful smell.  It tastes much more complex than it smells. Lots of bready, citrus goodness. Alcohol comes thru a bit in the finish, especially the more it warms. Not bad, but definitely makes its presence on some sips.  Feels wonderful going down.. medium body and heavy carbonation... pours a great head, like most Unibroue's. The only thing stopping me from pounding them back is the high abv.  Not my favorite from Unibroue, but not a bad beer by any means!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TheSarge,4.5,"For me, La Fin Du Monde is a treat to have. It gives off aromas consisting of orange rinds and freshly baked doughy breads. The brew produces a pure white frothy head that lasts quite a while. The body is quite cloudy due to the yeasts left behind. Every time I take a sip, it feels like Im biting into candied orange slices, with a moderate ginger spice. This feels a bit chewy at first, but seems to melt in my mouth. This is a greatly refreshing brew. Even with the moderate alcohol content, this could easily be enjoyable on a warm summer evening.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

At first it smelled and tasted more like a triple, the flowery aromas almost startling. But as this beer settlled in the glass, I could smell more the of malt, kind of a crystalized sweetness. I just loved this beer. It was complex and simple- it found the right balance. As it warmed slightly it became even richer, as most beers of this quality will do. An incredibly smooth beer for such high alcohol content. The heavy yeast the intially hit me also subsided, leaving this a wonderfully inviting ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

It tastes like soft fruits, melons, kiwi and pears.  Mouthfeel is zesty and effervescent. The beer is well carbonated. There is a warm feeling after the swallow.

Smell was of malty fruitiness and alcohol. Taste was ripe fleshy fruit -- apricots, mangoes, pears, peaches, with some spiciness almost like a licorice or a clove, followed by alcohol warming. Crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. Wonderfully refreshing -- the high alcohol content really sneaks up on you.

22,34,tozerm,4.12,I tried this from the bottle at our company Christmas party (I was in charge of the beer so it worked out nicely). I loved popping the cork and bumping a ceiling tile out of place when it jetted up from the bottle! Poured into the glass and got about 3/4 of an inch head. It looked like a nice wheat beer with bright straw yellow color. I got a hint of verbena in the nose. The flavor seemed to be a cross between a light sour belgian and a hefeweizen with lemon. Pretty darn refreshing for a relatively serious beer. Definitely would have it again and again.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Weizenmensch,4.5,"355mL to Orval chalice. Looks good - sticky, good head retention and lacing, gentle carbonation-not excessive, burnt orange/apricot colour. Fine bubbles when held up to light, sediment not visible though none left in the bottle after pouring.  Tried to warm it up a little, it's still a little bit too cold but it's fairly warm at home on Christmas Day, so this is quite refreshing. Aromas are not too obvious, however - hints of candied sugar, rich malt and maybe stone fruit are evident. Nothing bad at all but would be able to tell more if it were warmer (but I couldn't wait).  Taste is rich and satisfying, and yet still refreshing and quaffable. Most of all, it belies its 9% abv. The more I taste and think about it, the more I uncover - it's been a while since I've had a beer of this depth. Some Tripel-like flavours - candied sugar, malt, and tripel-like hop bitterness; yet this ale manages a quaffability of beers half its strength, without compromising on flavour. Also, a date-like effect I can't quite describe on the back of the tongue and the palate.  Mouthfeel is smooth and undistracting. Drinkability is excellent - a lingering, inexplicable sourness in the mouth might make your mouth feel a bit gross after a few of these. If only I were lucky enough to have more than one.  Overall, better than I expected, and if I had something to celebrate, like a visit to Quebec, I'd drink this all night, finances permitting. It's rare enough to even find it in Australia - if any distributors are reading this, please send more to Canberra - last time I've seen it was around 2000.

22,34,isaac,4.11,"12 oz. to snifter.  A - Dark, cloudy, golden body, 2-fingered, off-white head. Sinks to nothingness (perhaps because the bottle foamed over).  S - Sour yeast funkiness and bready malts.  T - Notes of Banana, pear, and bread.  M - Sticky, thick, but mildly chalky.  D - OK, but tasted with Russian River's Damnation, which was by far the better.  NOTE: The bottle was highly carbonated and the beer foamed up and out. This happened with all 4 beers in the pack and I did not shake it at all.

Crisp, citrus, spicey, even a hint of banana, but with a rich funky base. Nice and dry. Excellent.  Great rich mouthfeel.  Very easy to drink -- I NEVER would have thought this is anywhere near 9.0%!  What a great beer: like a Hefeweizen on steroids. I will have more of this!

Long lasting, pillowy soft white head that eventually recedes to 1/4"". Amazing carbonation, a sight to behold in the glass. Not much for lacing.  Aroma is fruity. I'm relatively new to Belgians, but it smells exactly like my homemade Saison I brewed this summer. I don't detect any spice aroma, just fruit, but damn good fruit!  The first sip is an EXPLOSION! My brain can't process it all. Fruit and spice up front, soft and creamy in the middle, sweet like honey towards the finish. Then you swallow and a warm cozy alcohol feel slowly works it way up to the back of your throat. WOW!!!  Mouthfeel is incredible. Starts out with carbonated prickliness, then finishes almost sticky (which probably helps me think of honey in the flavour). The pallette does clear quickly (easy to digest as they say), which has you quickly reaching for another sip (unlike a heavy barleywine which lingers for some time).  Drinkability is outstanding, though it really should be drank with some restraint. I'm half way through my first glass, and I'm already feeling it. I WANT MORE!  This is only my second pale belgian strong (the other being Duvel, which I enjoyed), but this is first rate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,kkipple,4.31,"This cloudy toasted orange beer is crowned by a magnificent 2 inch head, made of huge, soapy looking bubbles. The head dies a graceful death, fading slowly in the glass and resisting attempts to blow it aside to get at the yummy beer underneath.  I put my nose to my goblet and Im assaulted by yeasty esters! Theres a sharp fruitiness here; ripe apples and some clove and peppery spice make for a heady smell. Alcohol lurks in the background, begging you not to take this beer seriously. The smell is not terribly complex, but it sure is strong.  A long sip: My, what good taste those Canucks have! Another sip reveals a tart, yeasty, spicy beer thats quite wet tasting and with a warming character that sneaks up on you. The tartness is clean and not lingering, which is a good thing. Carbonation level is perfect, fizzy without being abrasive. Theres a definite sweet malt presence here, but it only comes out after the tarty spice has danced on your tongue for a few seconds. Finish is a bit damp and warm, with a sour, ripe orange flavor that lingers. Oddly refreshing.  La Fin Du Monde is really quite drinkable, and considering the advertised 9% abv, potentially dangerous. There are few 9% beers that I could immediately stomach another of, but La Fin Du Monde is one of them. (Dogfish 90 minute is another) Drink this Canadian nectar at your own peril!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,kimcgolf,4.38,"A damn good beer, but more along the style of a Saison or Belgian golden ale than a Triple. Poured to a hazy golden orange, with good carbonation and a thick white head that lingered , then dissipated to little lacing. Aroma was very pleasant spices (clove and coriander) with a hint of apples. Taste was more of the spices, and a hint of cookie dough. Mouthfeel was tingly, as a result of the spices, and the finish was smooth and a little warming, due to the 9% abv. Left a lingering spicy aftertaste.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,86sportster883,3.87,"This is a good triple fermented, bottle conditioned Belgian blonde. In a tulip glass, this beer is a cloudy pale yellow color with a large rocky white head that quickly disintegrates into almost nothing at all. The smell is both spicy and floral, with hints of hops and orange peel. The carbonation is initially very aggressive and reminiscent of champagne. As this beer warms, and the initial high carbonation subsides, the mouthfeel moves from light bodied to medium. The taste is mostly bittersweet and touch metallic. The finish is dry, but mildly bitter and alcoholic. Overall, a good beer if you like the BSPA style. Otherwise, it may be a bit much for the uninitiated.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Shovelbum,3.97,"Pours a generous creamy off-white head over a hazy golden hued body. Minimal lace. Aromas of light lemony citrus, yeast and coriander. Light and slightly sweet in the mouth, Light citrus and coriander are also evident in the flavor, perhaps a bit of ginger as well, but there is a much more substantial malt complexity to provide balance. Still, the spices are definite player. A decent hop bitterness also helps to round things out. Definitely well-carbonated, providing a light body and crisp mouthfeel and finish. Although as it warms it becomes softer.  Not my favorite of the Unibroue crew, but still a tasty Belgian style ale from N. America. There is a nice complexity of flavor despite the light character of the ale, but if you dont like coriander this probably isnt for you. Nicely done Quebec.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ojiikun,4.49,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a medium glass tulip. Foggy light amber, like a heffe, with full but fast white head. A little lace ringed after each sip, but foam was always fleeting.  Smells just about perfect for the style - lots lf sweetbreads and undeniable belgian esters. Smells of booze even cold, but more like a cordial - not a cheap liquor.  Whiffs right before the sip of tobacco, faintest goat cheese. Middle of the sip is surprisingly tart and dry despite sweet smells. The finale is that malty, sweet belgian candi taste that I still cannot describe better than ""frosted flakes"".  Feels a hair too sour on the tongue, but only while held there. Carbonation is balanced and the booze is warm, not burning.  Drinks all too well, thanks to each sip being charmed along by that wonderful smell and finish. The actual body of this beer could be better, but the aroma could not.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The smell is almost like a hefe, sweet with banana and clove, Belgian sugar. Taste is also strong on the clove/spice with no real hop taste and only a slight alcohol aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation that burns the tongue. The overall drinkability is reduced by the very strong clove/spice taste. Overall, I think you're better off with Maudite.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

This beer is malty sweet, with a medium dryness. The flavor is a thorough blending of banana and clove, a bright fruit flavor(strawberry?cherry?), a sharp yeast note, and dry, grainy malt. The flavors don't really stand out individually, but that was my crapshoot guess as to what might make this flavor. Mouthfeel is average I think for the style, but the drinkability is great.

Smelt of moderate bananas, sweet dough, white pepper.  Taste was upfront strong bittersweet raw sweet bread dough with peaches and oranges followed by a pungent sweaty raw dough on an average length finish. Palate was creamy, softly carbonated, medium bodied and light astringency.  Overall, it is unfathomable that this beer is 9% alcohol. The balance is exquisite.

22,34,SacoDeToro,4.5,"Pours a cloudy straw yellow with a generous dense meringue white head.  The aroma of the beer was of intense fruity esters, Belgian yeast, some floral hops and alcohol.  The flavor of the beer was primarily a crisp biscuit malt backbone. There were some hints of tropical fruits, tingly phenols, and a nice burst of floral hops to balance things out.  The beer was very dry and refreshing. A nice alcohol warmth came about in the finish.  This beer is exemplary of the style and remarkably drinkable considering its high ABV.

It has a very floral and spicy smell. Some hints of alcohol and yeast are also noticeable in the aroma. The taste is complex, yet well balanced, consisting mostly of a spicy and sweet tones.

Lively carbonation dances on the tongue, giving lift to flavors of peach jam and overripe banana. Subtle acid twang on the back end also helps keep the brew from being too heavy. Actuallly, the body seems quite light for the ABV. Finish is long, complex, and mouthwatering.  A brew that's both engrossingly complex and light on its feet, with very little of the rotten/oxidative notes that ruined the Trois Pistoles for me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,warmstorage,4,"12 ounce bottle, cellar temp, into Belgian goblet. (This review includes notes from 750ml bottles as well, but they are essentially identical.) States best before date of 07 - 12 - 09, ABV 9%.  Pours slightly hazy bright orange, with a tight white head which gives way to a very light head on top of the liquid.  Smell is a spicy peppery one, with notes of hot alcohol.  Taste is also spicy pepper, sweet fruit, and warm alcohol. It tingles in the mouth, and lingers long with spicy warm fruity goodness. There is a slightly viscous mouth in the finish, and some spicy heat that sticks around.  Overall, this is an excellent beer, and one that I've enjoyed many bottles of, many times. It doesn't blow me away, but I do like it a whole, whole lot. (Note: all 4s are a conscious decision for each category, and not just me going down the list.)",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jeffjfindley,4.75,"This is an unfiltered beauty with an exquisite head that sticks to everything. Visible carbonation enhances the visual experience. A wonderfully fresh and malty bouquet of cider, flowers and Belgian yeast demands immediate consumption.  My mouth is delighted by this beer in every way. The taste is complex, estery and warming. For me the mark of a great beer, or progressive rock band is when the complexity doesn't overpower the song. This is rich, sweet, strong, and at 9% abv, delightfully stingy. The finish is tight and dry, the aftertaste alive with honey, as well as tangerine and banana notes.  Let this sit in your mouth for awhile. Swallow, then take a deep breath through your mouth and you will know perfection.

22,34,EmilNoldSinclair,4.94,"Poured into a snifter style glass. Very cloudy, completely opaque and golden in color: there is indeed quite a bit of yeast in this brew. Initially the beer was chilled (don't know approx. temperature) and gradually warmed during the drinking session. It barely had a head (which soon disappeared...a bit unfortunate [though I quite enjoyed the opaque cloudiness!]), and it did have a quite pleasant smell. The taste was very well balanced between the hops and the malt, not too sweet and not too bitter. When it was chilled the flavor was more restrained yet reminiscent of apples. As it warmed up, it had more of a heavier banana flavor. Both the flavor and the feel of it (carbonation) immediately reminded me of champagne (though the comparison follows only to a point). This has definite cross-over appeal (considering the flavor, mouthfeel, as well as the presentation [both the caged and corked bottle as well as the appropriate glasswear]). Along with Stone's Double Bastard and Russian Imperial Stout, Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout and Nut Brown Ale and Orval's Trappist Ale, this is truly my favorite beer so far.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Taste is well-balanced with some initial banana notes leading to a sweet and complex finish. A whole lot of complexity since it varies in description and sensation minute by minute, but always pleasing. Feels great in the mouth, steady stream of bubbles from center of tulip, and so drinkable that it's dangerous. Truly a remarkable brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Beer was a hazy golden with orange hues.  Smell was of Belgian yeast of course. Crisp and lemony with earthy tones. Alcohol comes through as it warms.  Taste is also lemony, tangy, bready, grainy, and a light apple taste.  This is a nice foamy smooth beer in the mouth. Goes down way too easy for it's 9% ABV.

Poured with a HUGE head. (Maybe a bit too big) Bright golden color with a ton of carbonation and some cloudiness too.  Right away this beer smells almost like a champagne to me. Toasted aromas.  Taste? Well... first off, this beer has nice mouthfeel. Really coats your mouth with flavors the moment you first taste it. Impressive. The beer has almost a creamy toasty flavor, once again, similar to champagne. (with much less carbonation) There is also a bit of crisp sweetness of cloves and coriander on the finish.

Aroma of citrus at first, but with another smell I was able to pick out some bananas. Active palate, with plenty of carbonation. Had a yeasty, citrusy taste. Finish was bitter and alcoholic. At first I wasnt that big a fan, but as I sipped more, I enjoyed it and detected some peppery taste. I guess I'm not much of a coriander guy. I particularly enjoyed the last of the 750 ml bottle.

22,34,Butch,4.6,"I picked up a four pack of this stuff from Habanos in Slidell, LA. I dont have a cellar, so I stuck two in the fridge to cool over night. I got one out today and set it on the counter for 30 minutes or so to let it warm just a little. I dont have the proper glass to drink a Belgian Strong Pale Ale so I poured it into one of the big oversized red wine glasses.  Appearance: Pours like a dream. It comes out the color and cloudiness of a Hefeweizen. residual yeast from the bottle conditioning is evident. The one thing that really stands out is the head. Best foaming Ive ever seen, bar none. Thick and tight, its almost dense like a nitro stout. In this glass it rose a good inch and half with the tiniest little bubbles. It didnt stick around for the entire beer, but I drank it very slowly to savor it so I cant fault that. It didnt stick or lace however.  Taste and Smell: The aroma is great. Almost sweet in smell, and very fruity. The effervescent bubbles play like its recess all over my tongue. The taste is as complex as the aroma. Too many for me to identify, much less name. Lots of fruits, not very floral, no hop bitterness at all. Mostly spicy though. Balanced despite the lack of hops, maybe due to the crazy-assed yeasts overpowering the malt.  Notes: This one comes out at #2 on the ranking of the style, which is what convinced me to pay the $9.50 for the four pack. I havent tried many others of the style so I cant speak to the validity of the rank, but I wouldnt argue against it.  The beer is balanced so well with the fruity flavors that you barely taste the hops, and the alcohol not at all. I drank it at 12:30 on an empty stomach and I did feel that 9% alcohol a little toward the end, even as slow as I was sipping. Not a beer to guzzle.  Over all, I loved it. With tax I paid about $2.50 for each beer, not counting the gas and time to go get it. I pay more than that for beer at a pub. Id easily pay five bucks or more for this beauty if the archaic MS laws would allow it. I cant wait for the next one, but Im cellaring the last two for a year or so.

Fruity notes like banana start off with the grainy malts, then switches to the stout alcohol. The strong carbonation in the medium body adds a little fizz to the tongue. Earthy yeast is present among the dextrin rich texture. A creamy like banana presence lingers after each sip. The high alcohol is well hidden, allowing the complexity to prosper.

Scents are subdued, with faint traces of white Muscat grapes, apples & yeast. Pleasant, but not on par with the rest of this brews lofty presentation.  Subtle fruit sweetness with generous spice notes (clove) & dry white wine characteristics. Extremely tasty.  Perfect texture with spot-on carbonation & a wonderfully balanced body.

S- Yeast with fruit and spice. Alcohol more and more noticeable as it warms.  T- That great Unibroue yeast/fermentation flavour. Overrripe fruit (but good). Alcohol present but not overpowering. Warm spicy aftertaste that lingers with a bit of bitterness mixed in.  MF- Carbonation a bit high initially. Round feel in the mouth. Soft, no water feel at all.  D- Despite strong yeast presence and high ABV, this is one of the easiest beers on lees to drink. I know from experience in my youth as I would split a six pack with a friend and get quite drunk. For the moment, enjoying a single beer with my meal and feeling great!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,lpayette,4.48,"Appearance- A very cider-like color. Tons of carbonation. So much so that it bubbled out of the bottle opon opening.  Smell- Sugary candy, phenolic aromas, medicinal notes, ripe fruit, and very well hidden alcohol.  Taste- Very belgian all around... Most of the flavors seem to be a result of the yeast which is apparently an amazing strain. Clove/banana. Nothing stands out in particular, but all the flavors meld together nicely. Only a very small hint of alcohol. yeasty.  final verdict- very enjoyable. Alcohol is well hidden.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Smell: Floral scent with herb overtone  Taste: fruity taste which mellowed out nicely  Mouthfeel: pleasant foamy taste, full of flavor  An exellent pairing with strong flavored cheese.

22,34,6470zzy,3.45,"This beer was a 12 ounce bottle from a 4 pack purchased from Kappy's Liqours in Falmouth MA. $8.99 for the 4 pack.  Appearance: It reminded me exactly of a cloudy clover honey,the golden color was quite beautiful. The bottle was a borderline ""gusher"" and produced a monster fluffy white head.  Smell: Slightly floral with hints of herb.  Taste: What really hit me was the sweetness of this brew, once again the honey analogy. The aftertaste had a hint of mint and a very slight hop which was very slight in my opinion. I had no burn from the 9% alcohol, in fact had I not know from reading the bottle I wouldnt have believed it.  Mouthfeel: Creamy would about sum it up nicely I should think, creamy and smooth.  Notes: Overall a fine beer, I dont think I would want to partake in multiples of this one in a session though, not for the alcohol content mind you , but more for the pervading sweetness of the drink. I tasted none of the tartness that some of the other reviewers detected however I still have 3 brews to go so I shall update the review as needed.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Kinda sour smell lingers a little.  Taste - CLOVES! tasted just like it smelled. also light fruit peach flavor. and i can tasted a little banana. very pleasant mild alc taste. hidden well for 9%abv.  Mouthfeel - Excellent Carbonation nice thick mouthfeel  Note - One of the greatest beers i have had to date. Very complex taste. I enjoyed this beer from start to finish. Worth evey penny i paid for it. Highly Recommended.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Mebuzzard,4.38,"A hazy yellow pour with red and orange tints. Big head, foaming, a bit chunky, clings great to side of glass and forms an inverted 'U'. Some sediment floating around, no biggie. Aroma had alcohol at first, then citrus and biscuit, glazed donut, maybe some ginger. Taste was rich; sweet like sugar cane/rum, citrus undertones like orange, some pear and a complex mix of herbs. Felt a bit oily or waxy, a little burn, but that's a good thing. Very drinkable if you want a good beer to enjoy the whole experience of drinking beer. Not good for a six pack during a ball game and nachos.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,instrumentality,3.83,"The consensus around here seems to be that Unibroue is the greatest brewery to come out of Canada. Some have even said it's the best brewery on the continent. With that motivation, I've tried several of their brews, each time being highly disappointed by the same unappealing [what I call] ""clovey"" flavor.  Here, now, I've reached what many consider the be all, end all of Unibroue: La Fin Du Monde. I have low expectations, so I can't be disappointed, and I have to give myself at least a little bit of credit for being willing to give them another shot despite past experience.  The only indication I found regarding the age of this bomber was a ""best before"" date of 03-14-09. I should be safe.  I gave this beer the royal treatment by pouring it into my favorite glass, a Stone IRS tulip glass. It poured a clear but very bubbly golden hue, but almost half of the glass was filled by a fluffy white head that settled to no less than half its original height, clinging to the sides of the glass.  I let it settle several feet away from me as I sat back on the couch and began to type, and I could still smell its powerful aromas. The initial and most powerful scent was sweet but hard to identify...not quite fruity, closer to floral, but almost like eucalyptus leaves. Mixed in with this was a bit of lemon and, just beneath the surface...uh oh...cloves. At this point, though, the cloves were not offensive.  Overall, a strong, pleasant aroma, but with no really compelling features.  Drumroll...  I took my first sip.  ...and it was almost an entirely different experience from what I expected from the odors. Primarily malty, the sweetness turned to a sort of carob with a persistent but mild aftertaste. I could also feel the tingly burning sensation of clove (and maybe 2/3 of that 9% ABV), but it was not overpowering, at least not initally.  A swirl, another sniff, and another sip. Banana. More carob. A little burning at the finish, but again, not enough to scare me away.  If I were rating taste based on this beer vs. other Unibroue beers, I'd give it a 5. But since I'm rating to style and to my personal preferences, I'm giving it a 3.5. It's definitely drinkable, and I can't say I dislike it, but given the ever-growing number of beers I truly enjoy and the nearly infinite number of beers I've yet to try, I probably won't be laying down any more dough for this brew again any time soon.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,tattooedtolley,4.32,"I'll keep this one short as I am not the most experienced with the style. First think I notice is the brilliant yellow color of this beer. Immediately following the visual came the incredible aroma. This thing has so much going on in the aroma department its mind blowing. Tons of fruit and spice aromas all over the place.  The taste was just as complex with every sip finding something new about it. The alcohol is in there somewhere but is pretty unnoticable which makes it really drinkable for this big of a beer.  While I am not very experienced with the style, I liked it for what it was, a new experience and an obviously well crafted beer. I can't say I am hooked on the style or this beer but it makes for an interesting tasting experience. I will be trying this again down the road. To rate this beer, I am rating it based on the very little I know and how I enjoyed the experience. The fact that this thing has aroma and flavors all over the place scores hi with me, it is certainly multi-deminsional.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,kenito799,3.93,"750ml bottle, best before 2-21-08, poured into a Duvel glass  Gorgeous cloudy golden color, frothy white head leaves some lace, disspiates leaving about 1/3 inch.  Fresh, herbal, grassy aroma, coriander.  Wow, the active fine carbonation creates a fantastically creamy mouthfeel. Utterly addictive, I want to keep drinking more and more...  So crisp and fresh on first tatse, wondeful sweetness spreads across the tongue but balanced perfectly by bracing tanginess...mild hoppy bitterness in the long long finish...but never an overwhelming IPA hophead-type bitterness, an invigorating beautiful interplay of bitter, sweet, refreshing...the 9% alcohol is almost impossible to believe let alone detect...you want to keep drinking and drinking this until...the end of the world!!!  Easily one of the best beers I have had. WHY don't I have more in my fridge right now!  edit 10/17/08: Very interesting to try this after much more beer tasting experience. Still a great beer, but have tasted many better sunce I wrote the review. The flaw here is that the brew is too sweet. I have adjusted my ratings today.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,diamondc,4.75,"Maybe the best beer I've had so far since discovering craft beers. Smells like banana, cloves, and some apricot, but this is definetly the most complex beer I've tasted. I first tasted pineapple.. apricots.. bubblegum.. sour apples.. then the medium hop-y bitterness hit me. I didn't taste any alcohol until I was almost finished with the bottle. Drinkability is high - I seriously could go for another one, but I'll be passed out on the floor mid-way through. The alcohol is very well-hidden.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Dizzy,4.1,"Pours hazy yellow with a fizzy white head. Aroma is yeasty and reminds me a citrus fruits, maybe pineapple? Yeasty flavors, tartness are present and alcohol isn't as apparent as I would expect, but its there along with hop biterness. The mouthfeel is fizzy and somewhat thin. This is pretty easy to drink considering the alcohol content.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mmcave,3.51,"The color is golden with some rust tones near the head, which is a egg shell white. Aggressive head continual effervescence and doesn't seem to want to leave. No lacing thus far, but we'll see by the end. The smell is of pils malt, alcohol cloves, and spices with some citrus notes. Its smooth and tart in just the right places. This is a well balanced beer. How ever when it comes down to it I normally grab Duvel over this, but it is still an excellent.. repeat excellent beer. p.s i did this about a year ago and now I know how horriable corriander is if you use it in every damn beer you brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,uconnalum2,4.3,"Appearance is a cloudy golden color with a two finger frothy white head. The head goes down some but lasts throughout. Nice lacing on the glass. The smell is sweet and of citrus. The taste is peppery and of yeast. Citrus, especially pineapple, is evident. I had this right out of the fridge and it got smoother as it warmed. Alcohol can be sensed but its not overpowering. Mouthfeel is carbonated but pleasant. Drinkability is very good, especially for a 9.0% ABV. LFDM may be too sweet for some but I found it very well balanced. Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer that I will have again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BlackAngus,4.45,"Nice pale color, huge meringue head that lasts the entire glass.  Smell is spicey, fruity, clove, grapefruit, just a huge, complex aroma.

The body is hazy yellow translucent. The nose is yeasty, sweet, a bit peppery, slightly hoppy. The taste echoes the smell, with a focus on pepper and yeast characteristics. The mouth is medium, but the carbonation is a tad too high for me. The yeast adds more fun to the drink when poured in. A tasty brew, and quite good with vodka sauce.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Vivacious carbonation ascends from all sectors of the glass. Luxurious nose of honeyed grapefruit and banana with essences of clove, allspice, and a hint of coriander wrapped around the fresh yeast. An element of lime rind and citric acids adds brightness to the mouthfeel. A very nice brew, reminiscent of Brewery Ommegangs Hennipen.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Budlum,4.53,"Pours with plenty of foamy white head forming a fluffy, domed cap in the glass. Hazy and cloudy with loads of yeast floating around. Beautiful yellow and straw colored body with plenty of orange. Very appealing. The head lasts on well in to the drink leaving a nice lacing pattern on my goblet.  Wonderfully smooth on the nose. Strong vanilla and banana. Spiced with coriander and candied ginger. Underlying floral tones of iris and tulips. Some very light cinammon is also noticeable. Finishes with some barely noticeable alcohol and another full vanilla rush.  The first sip reveals a bevy of yeast flavors. Vanilla, banana, oak, roasted peanuts and plantains. Slightly sweet malt presence with what tastes like some high-grade wheat malts. Some noticeable alcohol in the back of the mouth. Long finish loaded with spicy coriander, cloves and oak with a kick of alcohol. One of the best non-Belgian beers crafted in a Belgian style.  Mouthfeel is wonderful. Balanced and supremely creamy with enough alcohol to remind me of it's presence.  Drinkability is also wonderful. This brew is incredibly tasty and enjoyable to drink. It would be easy to drink too many of these.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Beerzebub,4.29,"Orange-gold, a finger of white frothy head that doesn't totally stay but keeps coming up in the center of the goblet to retain a thin layer. An occasional small pour from the bottle brings it back up nicely.  Smells of orange juice, red apples, sugar cookies, spice, herbs, earth. Appetizing.  Taste matches smell, along with rock sugar, orange peel, sweet white bread. Delicious, and drinkable. Finishes with orangey freshness and alcohol.  Mouthfeel is creamy, with a bit of nice oiliness, but can get too fizzy.  This Quebecoise is fantastique. I wish I had a bowl of poutine to go with it!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,cheers2beers,4.43,"Appearance: This beer is almost an applejuice color, but brighter. The bright white head exploded upward towards the brim of my glass, making me have to pace the final bit of liquid. There isn't much laceing to speak of. There are however, lots of beading floating vigoriously to the top,not giveing the little bit of dregs I eased in there to settle.  Smell: The aroma is very fruity, such as a strong apricot scent as well as sweet red apples. A vague hop and malt profile is noticed, but the fresh bread scent is overpowering any chance the two had.  Taste: Apricots galore. Citrusy oranges blended nicely with the sweet red apples makes for a smooth tasteing fruity drink. Most Belgian ales I find have a certain typical yeast aroma and taste about them, but this one does not seem to have this. Instead the bread notes are sweeter and less upfront. In the finish, you cannot hide the 9% alcohol that hits you, but it is balanced very well with all the fruity esters and bread notes.  Mouthfeel: Smooth drinking, almost grainy yet at the same time its almost slick. High carbonation with a meduim body. This beer has an alcoholic bubblely finish.  Drinkability: When you go to the store to purchase beer,there is always a bunch you have had but may have forgotten how good they really are. This is one of mine, with that being said, I vow to put this beer in my monthly rotation, and suggest you do the same. If you have not had this one, you dont know what you are missing.

22,34,Osiris9588,4.18,"Pours a rusty godlen color with a creamy 1.5"" head, leaving some slight lacing. A mild bouquet of clove, floral yeast, and a touch of citrus. The flavor is a delicious mellow malt mixed with clove and citrus. The mouth feel is incredible, so complex; it dances all over the palate, going from malty to sweet and spicy, then finishes almost buttery, with barely a trace of alcohol.  I have had this beer before, but mixed with many others, and it didn't really take me by storm. This time, concentrating on it alone, it was a delight. I defintely see more in my future--until the world ends, anyway, which could be any day now.

The beer pours a hazy yellow color with loads of carbonation and yeast present in the body of it. The is a rocky white head that sits a top it that disipated at a decent rate to create a film arcoss the top leaving spotty lacing. For a Belgian style I wants to see the head stay up longer then it did.  The smell and taste are loaded with fruity sweet malts giving it a slightly apple like taste. Big yeasty aroma and taste is very present. Also in both there was a very present fusal alcohol presence. The only difference really in the smell and taste is that the taste had a slightly spicey hops taste that was present.  The beer was a medium body that left a nice warming feeling in the mouth from the high alcohol. It was a wonderful brew that must be taken with respect and sipped throughout the night.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,KeithPatton,5,"I found this brew (suprise, surprise!) at the local neighborhood HEB supermarket. It was not surprise that when I went back they had sold out. Duvel and Chimay drinkers take note, there is a new kid on the block and his Reggie...whoops wrong review...  The bottle is striking and the Quebec nationalism hits you in the face like a handfull of yeast sediment. If your french is rusty, the name translates to ""End of the Earth"". This could be interpreted a number of ways; Quebec is literally at the end of the Earth or you'd have to go to the End of the Earth to find a better beer. I think the latter is appropriate. I liked the beer so much I wasted no time in cloning it. That of course requried that I buy several more bottles to harvest the yeast. (Word of note to homebrewers, the yeast is very agressive so have plenty of space in your carboy or you will have a problem. I dry hopped mine with a bit more orange peel than called for and it clogged my blow off tube and I got a call from home (Houston, we have a problem...) it seems the stopper, blow off tube and several ounces of peel and yeast were blown onto the ceiling and surrounding real estate. However the beer was splendid, although with no candy sugar it was minus the tremendous head. Now on to the beer.  This beer was splendid. From the huge rocky shaving cream head, to the wonderful orangey, estery aroma it shouted drink me. (Caution, do not mow the yard in the Houston heat, then gulp one of these 22oz babies down or you will have a hangover in short order.) The ale bursts in your mouth like a fruity explosion, only dampened by the mild alcohol warmth as it slides down your gullet like a soothing balm. You just can't stop. 22ozs disappears in no time. Buy the big one for yourself and a 6 pack of 12 ozers because you will not want to share the large bottle with anyone. The mouth feel was wonderful and even with it's prodigious alcohol content, you'll down this brew greedily like an overpass dwelling wino. Unibue have outdone themselves. Warning: If you haven't tried Belgian Style Ales and do not want to pay the high price demanded for them ($8.00), Do not try this beer as it is highly addictive!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Cloudy golden-orange color, which is almost luminescent under light. Low viscosity.  Aroma: Banana, honey, yeast, with some orange notes and nice bready undertones. Golden raisins and candy sugar in the development, with some lemongrass and ginger from the hops. The most impressive aspect of the nose was that you could smell it loud and clear from across the room upon opening the bottle.  Taste: Yummy sweet raisins, oranges, and malts. Booze and mild pine/ginger in the background. Strawberry and apricot developments. Bready yeasty finish with just a little pepper. Nice grassy bristle on the tongue.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, with low constant carbonation. Sweet malty finish.  Drinkability: Fantastic - dangerously easy to drink, though the sweetness definitely caught up with me by the end of a glass. Slightly abrasive grassiness and mild but dry finish certainly kept this pleasant.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,RedHaze,3.67,"Pours a very hazy orange with a one finger head that settles very quickly to a thin spotty cap leaving behind almost no lace.  Smell; lots of coriander and citric lemon, with a bunch of spices and yeast. There's a bit of a bready dough quality, in there as well.  Taste; very fruity with oranges and lemons, and there's some other fruits that I can't quite place. The spices and sweetness are almost to overwhelming for me. Some alcohol makes it's presence felt in the aftertaste pretty strongly. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and with the sweetness and abundance of spices this is a bit hard for me to drink.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

S: Strong fruity yeast and a nicely masked alcohol sting. Heavily spiced but nothing stands out. Citrusy orange, lemon and honey. Musky malt base.  T: Sweet yeasty front with a citrusy back bite and some nice bittering hops. Alcohol is masked superbly. Spices are heavy but again nothing stands out. Finishes with a spicy pepper bite, yet not the taste of pepper alone.  M: Sweetness and bitter combat playfully, nice carbonation with a bitter hop aftertaste.

Lot's of retention and visible carbonation  Aroma is citrus, spice, champagne and the light floral/fruity notes indicative of the style.  Wow! There is a lot going on with the taste! Sweet cherry, vanilla, raisin, caramel, citrus rind, ginger, honey and clove. This is a surprisingly complex beer. The alcohol is noticeable and warming, lending to a balancing tartness. Given the high alcohol content, it is not overpowering at all. The finish has an extremely subtle dry characteristic.  All of this flavor in a light/medium bodied beer. The high carbonation lends to an excellent mouthfeel. Addictively drinkable.  A surprising, highly drinkable treat and a wonderful example of the style.

22,34,dblinkhorn,4.75,"Uncapped the 12 oz bottle, and it immediately started foaming out violently. I didn't shake the beer to my knowledge, but regardless it foamed strongly for probably 45 seconds before it calmed down. The whole time I was smelling the beer and and was very impressed.  Poured from 12 oz bottle into glass tulip goblet.  Appearance - Hazy straw-orange color. There is a moderate amount of debris in the beer. The head is very large and slightly tan, and ""chunky"" (consisting of big bubbles). The head eventually calms down and settles at about a half-finger silky off-white head.  Smell - Wow! This thing is heaven for the nose. It is very sweet smelling with a light alcohol burn accompanying it. The smell consists of dark fruits and a very nice bready malt aroma in the background of the scent. Also there are floral, citrus, and spice notes.  Taste - Again, incredible. Surprisingly, the first thing I taste is the bready flavored malt, which is very rich and soothing. Coming second is a quite present alcohol burn, but definitely not overpowering. Also, you begin to taste the sweet dark fruits as with the smell. The hops are present, but aren't nearly on the level of the sweet, fruity, spiciness of the rest of it. Also, there are definitely hints of nutmeg and a slight flavor of cinnamon. A very slight taste of pear also comes into the aftertaste. The taste of this brew is amazing. The flavors are so rich and complex. Just supberb!  Mouthfeel - The beer has a velvety medium-bodied mouth feel. It is very smooth and rolls around in your mouth so gently and nicely, that it's pleasure for the ""touch"" sense as well as the ""taste"" sense of your mouth. The carbonation is right on the money, couldn't be any better.  Drinkability - This stuff is potent, make no mistake, but goodness gracious is it excellent. This is probably in my top three brews of all. Anyway, the drinkability is very good if you can handle the style alright.  Overall...wow! I just can't get over the quality of this beer. You MUST try this beer if you like strong Belgian style ales. Just amazing.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,peabody,4.04,"Sheeze, when do the bubbles stop here? I can't even pour it out of the bottle yet! Pours out like a bubbly ice tea. A slight tint of orange and the foam is white and very huge. Not a lack of carbonation here. Clove and cinammon and fruit hit the nose first. The yeast and hops are hidden way in the back. Fruity flavor with a dirty aftertaste. Can't taste the alcohol but can feel it. The dirty aftertaste is throwing me. No bitter hops here. Mouthfeel is not what I expected but it starts out clean and finishes clean. The dirty taste in the middle is unwanted. Strong to say the least. Nice mixture of lots of flavors though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,GratefulBeerGuy,4.85,"Original Review : 12 oz bottle 1/4 of the 4 pack  Hisss as the bottle is popped. Appears very bubbly and active, Massive thick foamy head, 3"" thick dissipates slowly. Color is a pale/straw Gold.  Smells peppery and herbal, big fruity yeasty with sweet malt and lemmon.  Taste includes: spicey and herbal, wheaty, great fruitiness with red berries and grapes yeast with a fine sweet malt to finish.  Bubbly!, champagne-like. Crisp with a good bite, light body makes this feel very light on the palate but very gentle and smooth going down.  Feels really good so it's easy to drink but the 9%ABV is going to limit the intake to a certain degree. high quality stuff.  Time to revisit a true classic. 5/23/17 750 ml cage and cork >Duvel Chalice Update:*  * Amber and gold color, wild, gyser bubbles swirling to the top like a typhoon. A massive, fluffy, bubbly, pure white foam crown rises high above the liquid and retains it's depth.  Such a wonderfully fruity and tart aroma. Spices and herbal mixture mixed into the dense fruits is just awesome. Sweet and sour yeast aroma is high quality. Blackberry and ground pepper!  SNAPPY and light mouthfeel, amazingly crisp and lively with a full, long and lush feel going down, finishes dry and light. Just perfect for the style! Such a pleasurable body.  The flavor is full of amazing yeast complexity. Fruits abound! Wild blackberries with black pepper, a very light crispy, wheat-like malt keeps it balanced. The hops are very earthy with more fruits and herbs popping out throughout. A French/Canadian classic that gives any of the authentic Belgian Tripels a run for the money. Perfect in style and high in complexity. Unique and deep yeast strain gives it that very important X factor.  After becoming a bit of a Belgian-style freak, geek, conisuer....reviewing many of the top authentic Belgians and American Belgian styles, I just had to revisit and update this early classic for me. La Fin Du Monde is most likely my ""gateway"" brew that got me hooked on this and all other Belgian specific styles. I took a nice, long look at the one that got me hooked. I appreciate it now, more than ever as I sit here, sipping and contemplating this true classic creation. As I listen to the epic Grateful Dead jam known as the Darkstar>Morning Dew combo from London England 5/23/72....I realize this is what it's all about. Maximum enjoyment on all levels. Grade A shit.  **Update review via Untapped: La Fin du Monde  Unibroue  Belgian Tripel  This is a true classic. Brewing as an art form. Unibroue introduced me to Belgian/French styles with its complex yeast character and lively vibe. Deep and exciting fruity esters with green apples, earthy spice and tangy yeast. There is simply nothing like it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,gotbeer,4,"This beer reminds me how one's palate can change. The first time I had this one I absolutely hated it. I was used to english and german style sessionable brews, and this tasted like gasoline to me at the time. Now- a much different story.  La Fin Du Monde pours a light amber with a pure white head. Lots of small bubbles rise from the glass. The smell is of candy sugar and some fruit flavors.  The taste brings candy sugar, exotic fruits, and a hint of alcohol heat.

22,34,edmundfitzoil,4.38,"La Fin Du Monde purchased from ABC Liqour in Jacksonville. I poured my bottle into my Unibroue tulip.  The beer poured a very effervescent and bubbly lightly hazy bright gold color with a brilliant white 2 inch head of surprisingly fizzy bubbles. The head dissipated after a few moments to a finger of consistent, retained head. The CO2 bubbles rose to the top of the glass throughout the drinking, leaving the beer a slightly champagne like appearance. The nose consisted of a light apple smell along with a number of other fruit tones and a light spiciness. The flavor is big with a hidden big abv. A medium bodied brew with strong clove flavors and a hoppy finish. The beer proved to be a great sipper and finished off a day of work and hearing about my fiance's second day of teaching third grade.  I'll be returning to this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,eze153,4.72,"This is an amazing beer... I had this one on tap at D's Six Pack and Dogz, Check this place out if you live in Pittsburgh... anyways...  It pours a golden brown color with a light, fluffy, sort-of white, brown head. the smell is great, like fruits, nuts and spices, sort of reminds me of Christmas! The taste is beyond expectations, simply put, the best belgin beer brewed outside Belgium! Now that's saying a lot and the price is nice too, compared to the expensive imports from Belgium. I could drink these all the time but they can fil you up pretty fast but I would recomend this to anyone who wants to try a good beer!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jhollick,3.88,"Appearance: A golden wheat color with a thick, fluffy, enormous white head.  Smell: The smell is all Belgian Strong Pale; sweet candy with spice, and some pilsner notes come through as well.  Mouthfeel: It feels a bit heavy...more so than I would have expected. The carbonation is significant, but not overwhelming.  Taste: Based on the pilsner notes, I was expecting (and maybe hoping) for a bit more bitterness. This beer is all candy and yeast/malt up front. That is followed by some lemon, coriander, orange, and a hint of plum. There is scarely any hop presence. The warmth from the alcohol is evident throughout, but it never becomes obtrusive.  Drinkability: One 12oz. bottle was enough for me. It is very tasty, but the sweetness stands out quite a bit, which limits the amount I can consume. One bottle was the perfect amount for me.  Overall: This beer has a very pleasant flavor, even if it isn't my favorite Unibroue offering. The sweet and spice are the dominant flavors, which makes it a bit unbalanced for a Belgian Strong Pale in my opinion. Even so, if this were my beer during the end of the world, I would certainly be content to check out on this note.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Smell is crisp and fruity, with citrus and pineapple obvious, along with a yeasty tone and some grains. Taste is malty, the bright fruitiness and bready notes blending well, and spices becoming apparent in the finish. A touch of hop bitterness is present, and the aftertaste is sweet. Mouthfeel is quite carbonated, and very warming, and drinkability is excellent. Tripels aren't always my cup of tea, but this one is an exception. Well crafted and greatly appreciated.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

A bit of fruitiness with hint of alcohol. Slightly sour smell.  Sweet, malty flavor masks the alcohol. Hint of fruit.  It feels a bit overly carbonated, so much so that it takes away from the flavor.  I would have rated the drinkability higher on this one if it weren't for the carbonation.

Alcohol creeps through at the end and into the aftertaste, which also contains bubblegum, peach and slight caramel flavour.  M - Medium body and carbonation. Becomes fuller as it warms.

This is a very nice smelling beer, citrus fruit and clove both seem apparent. Has that typical belgian yeast character in the flavor. Some citrus like fruit flavors are noticeable and some alcohol toward the end too. Bubblegum also seems to appear and disappear quickly in the flavor. The carbonation is quite active and is prickly on the tongue. This is a very tasty beer, highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

I have read about insane carbonation but the head in my glass was tame. A beautiful honey-yellow color with a few shades of orange trying to show through. Heavy carbonation on the palate but pleasant. Yeast and alcohol are immediately present but the alcohol is NOT over-bearing. I had to let this beer sit and mellow to get some sweet malt to come through all the yeast. I caught a whiff of hops as it warmed but not much bitterness to taste. I could drink two at a sitting but this Ale on Lees will warm you up. My first Unibroue and it was excellent.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,headlessparrot,3.85,"Unibroue's La Fin Du Monde is held in high esteem around these parts; I decided to try it for myself and see how it stacks up. La Fin Du Monde is not a beer for the faint of heart, and it's not a beer that you're going to drink six of in an evening. It exemplifies that motto, 'respect beer.' But let's see how it stacks up - it should be noted that I *tried* to age this beer, but folded and drank it within three months of purchasing it.  Appearance is very nice. Poured from the silver-foiled industry standard bottle into a Leffe glass (the closest I had to the reccomended glassware), it has a quite cloudy orange-brown-yellow sort of colouration. A very, very careful pour results in two fingers of very foamy head (a normal pour would have it overflowing out of the glass) that continues to grow for a few moments before shrinking a bit and settling to about a finger-and-a-half. A considerable amount of lacing is at times runny, but delicious looking nonetheless. This is a good looking beer.  The smell is full of a very sweet maltiness, though not much in the way of hops. Citrus fruits are quite apparant, along with nutmeg and cloves. A bit of wheatiness, bubblegum, yeasty notes and a bit of sour character. Floral, with a hint of alcohol (very well disguised for 9%). Perhaps the only off-note is a sort of metallic twang. As the beer warms, the aroma oddly seems to become harder to detect, which is very unusual with any beer, as warmth usually brings out MORE flavour.  Taste is also quite good, though it doesn't live up fully to the beautiful aroma. Sweet malts, again, a touch of indistinct hops, but largely dominated by the unusual flavours that make Belgians so appealing. Citrus fruits (especially lemon and curaco oranges), nutmeg, and cloves. Wheat notes, pepper, and a yeasty character, as well as the return of bubblegum. Some alcohol-warmth (duh), and the return of that one off-note - an almost bloody-metallic twang that sits a bit in the mouth. Sweet throughout, finish is slightly dry, but quite sweet on the finish. Almost no bitterness to be found. Very good tasting brew, but not something I would drink with any regularity, I must admit.  Mouthfeel is this beer's weak point. The light body isn't so bad - it's light, but definitely not watery - but this is a brew that's overcarbonated to extremes, almost macro levels. Drinkability, likewise, is average. I would *like* to have more than one of these, but often find myself barely able to finish a single bottle of the stuff; this is in part because of the high ABV, the heavy carbonation, and the occasionally cloying sweetness of the beer.  La Fin Du Monde is a great brew. It's certainly one of the best beers to come out of Canada, but realistically, it's not something that anyone could ever drink regularly. This is a special treat, a beer you keep in the fridge for a special occasion - graduation, the end of exams, finding a job. It's *not* for sipping in front of the television.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Onibubba,2.98,"First review! Poured into a Duvel glass. Beautiful light amber color with a white undying head. Aroma seemed very floral to me, and the alcohol was quite appearant. Something else too...Something sweet?  Taste confirmed the alcohol (whoah) and the source of the sweetness - the first thought that came into my head was bubblegum.  Mouthfeel was nice - a bit more carbination than I like, but nice. Not very drinkable for me. Could only manage small sips. Like most big beers, the taste improves as the temp warms, but not so much that I would want another anytime soon. I just could not shake the bubblegum.  This beer did have very impressive characteristics, but the taste just did not suit me. Glad I tried it though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,DaveFL1976,4.3,"Pours a cloudy dark straw color with a fluffy white head that settles down to a thin skim. Smell is nice. Bready, sweet, wheaty malt with a hint of lemon. It smells like what I imagine a strong German Weisen would smell like. Taste is bold yet smooth. Heavy on the sweet malt. Lots of malt here, not a lot of bitterness, and the alcohol is expertly hidden. This is a tasty brew. It reminds me of Andechs Weissbier even though they're not the same style. But that's certainly not a bad thing to be reminded of Andechs. If I have one complaint, it's that this bottle is overly carbonated. The taste is smooth, but all the bubbles exploding in my mouth adds harshness that impairs drinkability a bit.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bark,4.8,"The colour is orange-pale brown-yellow. The liquid is somewhat cloudy. The foam is at first enormous (almost like a Duvel), but it slowly sinks down to a finger thick uneven head without much lacing.  The smell is fruity with notes of spices and sweet malt. Oh, I like it! There are notes of bitter citric fruits, oat cookies, herbs (Basilica? Cloves?), brown sugar, spring flowers and a gentle sour note. Like a Hoegaarden Wit with extra everything!  Do I dare to taste? Oh yes. Wheat, yeast, herbs, sourness, bitter hops, citric fruits. And everything just works out great! Lots of Belgian flavours, with a particular flavour if bitter oranges and wheat ale. But, although there are lots of flavours and alcohol like a weak wine, it is very drinkable and not heavy at all. Impressive stuff. The loooong aftertaste is fruity with some hoppy flavours, wheat flour, tangerines and some matured strong wine.  The carbonation is strong (but quickly fading) with small bubbles. It tickles your tounge, but it is in no way sharp.  A truly great beer, and a great Belgian beer from Canada?Boyam I pleasantly surprised!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jorjoria,4.32,Pours a hazy orange yellow with a massive white head. The first smell is almost all yeast. After sitting of a while it starts to give off more fruit notes. I get some strawberry. I also smell what almost appears to be bubble gum like odors. These are not unpleasant and I believe they are typical of the yeast used in this beer. The beer in full and cream like as it hits the pallet. It has a lot of the yeast and fruit flavors that were touched on earlier. It also has a good amount of sweetness which as the beer warms can become a little overwhelming. As the beer warm the alcohol also becomes much more apparent. Overall a fantastic brew and a great value.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,hunteraw,4.3,"Poured with a big white head, over a golden honey body, fairly clear. Some lacing down my glass.  Aroma: That familiar Belgian yeast scent, with some candi sweetness and some spice.  Taste: Yum. Citrus and yeast fruitiness at the front. Sweet, but not cloying. Hops gives some spiciness. Finishes on a yeasty, dry alcohol note. A lot of reviews mention that the alcohol is well-hidden, but I'd have to disagree - I can definitely taste it, and there's alcohol warming as you swallow.  Mouthfeel: Fairly light mouthfeel, very carbonated, very smooth.  Drinkability: the only thing that detracts from the drinkability of this beer is the alcohol presence in the taste - you can taste it, and so you're conscious of how much alcohol you're consuming. Very good beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Appearance: Pours a hazy brilliant golden with a thick fluffy creamy head, that slowly fades to a very persistent thin half-inch layer that leaves patchy lace.  Smell: Yeasty with a sweet fruitiness. Notes of citrus, bananas, light graininess, pepper and alcohol.  Taste: Sweet malts and fruits, including bananas and citrus. The finish is a nice interplay of peppery and spicy alcohol, and bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Tingly carbonation, smooth and creamy, with a slight dryness in the finish.

The froth lasts, floating like a proud ship with full sail. Smells like a trippel: Straw, white grapes, white peppercorn, chalk/limestone, and yeast in a surgical room. There's a hint of sweetness left; umm, tangy meyer lemon rind, key lime pie, kiwi garnish. Alcohol in a stinging aftertaste, but not negative. Crisp and beautiful.

Pepper and spice at the end of the swallow but little aftertaste. Creamy and very full body. Good coating and a buttery feel is left behind though not with a slick sensation. Highly enjoyable and drinkable though not a session brew for obvious reasons.  -Oelergud,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Settled quickly to a film of lace that lasted the entire drink. Some spotty, sparkling lacing.  Smell was quite aromatic. Yeasty and sweet with citrus, banana and spices (coriander and clove) coming through strong. Some grassy, hoppy notes were detectable in the background.  Taste was quite similar to the smell yet even more intense. Orange peel was noticeable up front before the huge spicy flavors kicked in. Clove dominated, followed by some nutmeg and coriander as well. Some ripe fruits and malty sweetness came through mid-palate before the crisp hops helped to finish this beer off and maintain balance. Alcohol flavor was only moderately noticeable - amazing considering this beer is 9% ABV. Slight warming in the back of the throat.  The only knock I had against this beer was the mouthfeel. It was thinner than expected and the carbonation was a bit overdone. Otherwise, I would consider this beer to be in a category all its own.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Fruits (maybe citrus) come to mind.  T: Tastes just like it smells. Srong malts, good hops, and fruity sweetness comes through as it warms.

Tons of carbonation bubbles throughout the beer. Decent, if unbalanced lacing.  The first aroma hit me with a mostly malted scent. Major second scent of banana and nut. Also contained a minor subtly blend of additional aroma that is comparable to bouquet of fresh flowers.  The first taste produced a nice almond flavor with a banana aftertaste. The slight note of malt comes through in a second sip. No noticable hops flavor. Surprisingly flavored and subdued for a beer with this ABV.  Has a nice bold texture and finishes nice in my mouth. Carbonation is a little more subdued then I expected after seeing the carbonation bubbles in the beer.  A fantastic choice for a beer to enjoy with a meal.

It really has a rounded, flavorful, enjoyable taste. A boatload of spices are tossed into this one, meshed with peach/nectarine fruits. I notice similarities to some american wheat beers that I've tried. The high abv is hardly noticeable in the taste, but it warms in your stomach after a few sips. Not as dead-set hoppy as I expected, more sweet and fruity.  The mouthfeel is excellently textured, and this is very drinkable considering the abv.

22,34,blitz134,3.88,"I've had this one around for a while now, over a year and a half. I always thought I had reviewed it but I guess I hadn't. Belgian Pales are finally starting to come around for me, typically this hasn't been my favorite style.  Appearance is a light, golden color. Almost light yellow. Poured a little too much off and resulted in plenty of yeast floaties in its clear body. Huge pure white head on the pour. Reduced quickly but left a nice half inch foam cap on the top. Left a nice coating of solid lace in my glass.  Smell is spicy and sweet. Corriander and white pepper predominate with some subtle citrus smells, a bit of orange rind and some pear. Typical for the style, but simple and clean in this example.  Solid malty body to start with, a bit earthy actually. Some citrus and light fruits come in next, pear and apple, followed with a bit of light spice. Finish is grassy with some straw. My guess is that the bit of age this has brought out the maltiness over the already light hops and spiciness. This is still a nicely balanced beer though.  Mouthfeel is thin to medium. Most likely it is heavier than it appears, there is a fair amount of carbonation which makes this crisp on the tongue, but weakens the mouthfeel.  Drinkability is okay. Like I said, I'm not a huge belgian pale fan, but this one comes across nicely balanced and well flavored. The prickly feel on the tongue and stomach warming nature hurt this a bit. I just think that a clean, light flavor natured beer with a lot of carbonation shouldn't feel heavy on the stomach.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The flavors change rapidly from sip to swallow. It starts smoothly, even innocently, but quickly transforms to a nearly mulled taste of spices. Still, this is not a sweet beer. Very high carbonation, perhaps too much so given the body which is not nearly as full as some of this style. The aftertaste is strong alcohol with a lactose sourness.

Taste: Lots of subdued fruit flavors, combined with spices and yeast. Well-balanced, very tasty, and fairly refreshing. My only (very minor) complaint is that it's not very complex. Otherwise it's exceptional.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly, it's a light- to medium-bodied beer. Quite a bit of light, tingly carbonation as well. Very smooth feel.  Drinkability: If anything, it's probably a bit ""too"" drinkable, considering the ABV. Don't really notice alcohol in the taste, but at 9% it starts to kick in relatively fast. Goes down really nice and doesn't feel heavy at all.  I'd always wanted to try one of these beers from Unibroue... finally decided to give it a try and picked this one on a whim. I was extremely pleased! An excellent ale that will surely catch your attention if you try it. I will definitely be having this again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,AltBock,4.41,"A simple 12oz. bottle with a nice colorful oval label of the Quebec providence of Canada. If you already didn't know the name it French means ""the end of the world."" A nice name for a beer that I'm having on 6-6-06. It's too bad that the name really doesn't mean the complete end of the world. The name is actually reference to the early explorers who thought this region was actually the end of the world. The back label had information about the beer, correct glassware, Govt. warning, and a Best Before Date above the barcode. My BB date is 1-31-09. The twist off cap was covered with silver foil. Nice looking bottle!  Appearance: When I popped the cap, the foam was almost jumping out of the bottle. I had to quickly pour it into my Snifter glass or it would go all over the place. The beer itself was a hazy golden orange color with a massive head of foam. I couldn't pour all of the 12oz. into the glass because it was so massive. The head of foam was a nice fluffy white color and left behind loads of rings and plenty of white sticky lace in its tracks. If that wasn't enough you can see little yeast fragments floating around the glass. I can't say enough good things about the appearance!  Smell: It had a nice aroma of spicy juicy fruits, little hops, and with some yeast and alcohol in the background. For some reason the smell wasn't jumping at me like the head of foam was. Still very nice.  Taste: I thought that since it had a 9% ABV that it would have a strong alcohol presence, but it really didn't. It was very juicy up front, then some spices and cloves come through, then a small taste of yeast, and then at the end, just a small presence of alcohol shines through. All of these flavors are balanced quite nicely! Excellent Taste!!!  Mouthfeel: It was very creamy, carbonated, smooth, and with an aftertaste of some fruits and yeast. Even though this had a high ABV%, I really couldn't feel at it.  Drinkability: Excellent beer and must try! The best part is that every good beer store would have some in stock! I could have another one and I'm betting that this beer would really sneak up on you after a few!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Jarhead271,4.12,"A: Pours cloudy, dull orange. Generous, fluffy, white as snow head.  S: Ripe fruit and sweetness. That strange Belgian yeast smell is also evident  T: Fruity esters from smell make a good presence in the taste. Candy sugar. Some bready malt. Only a hint of alcohol which is surprising as this beer is 9.0 abv. High carbonation scrubs away some of the flavor in my opinion. Swishing the beer around in the glass takes care of this problem. Medium-low bitterness. No noticeable hop flavor or aroma. Alcohol taste and warming increase as the beer warms up. I'm starting to notice a little sourness as well.  M: Medium body. High carbonation  D: This beer is extremely drinkable given its high alc content. This could really be a devil to the unsuspecting drinker. The flavors blend nicely.  All in all, great beer which showcases the unique Belgian yeast and candi sugar. Not as good as Maudite by the same brewer, but definitley worth trying if you haven't. Probably wouldn't buy this particular brew again because of the price, but I am very impressed so far with this brewery",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BillyB,4.4,"Translation; It's ""The End of the World!""  If it was the end of the world I wouldn't mind having this beer as my last. A canadian belgian styled strong pale ale. This is just as good, if not better than Lucifer or Delerium Tremens.  750ml corked and wired bottle. Has all the great characteristics of the style.  Thick white head, Golden bubbly carbonation.  Sweet, yeasty, sugary aroma.  Taste of Belgium(but from Canada, eh?)  Light to medium, carbonated feel. Very, VERY drinkable. If you really wanna rock.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,trep,4.2,"Fluffy white crown of head sitting majestically atop the unfiltered murky orange. Looks pretty good despite the yeasties in suspension. Little or no carbonation.  Sour white grapes, and Unibroue's distinct yeasty smell. A little honey and a little bit of light fruits. The faintest hint of alcohol as the head finally fades.  Gee-golly willakers, quite a little time-line of flavor on the first sip. Initially bread-yeasty that flows so smoothly to a bitter light golden malty background that gives way to light fruits and a faint honey aftertaste. Alcohol is more present as it warms. Probably the best Belgian Strong Pale i've had.  Little carbonation but a perfect medium body that doesn't overwhelm you. Fiercely easy drinking for a 9% belgian strong pale. Alcohol is barely noticable, even after warming, and it doesn't get mundane.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jettjon,4.08,"Highs: Appearance, drinkability Lows: None  Holy head, Batman! Pouring this fizz bomb reminds me of the first time I tried it and had no glassware. One chug from the bottle and I had beer coming out of my nose. The head is absolutely huge, reminiscent of Champaign. Hell, theres even lacing inside the bottle! Pours an apricot juice (amber-yellow-musky) color with tiny bubbles and visible sediment suspended in the pour. The huge head rapidly fades down to a thin sheet constantly fueled by the bubbles, with lots of lacing left behind. Nose of cloves, plums, dates, and dark fruit. Flavor is complex, with elements of clove spice, fruit juices, and alcohol culminating cleanly in a semi-sweet finishneither sweet nor dry, with no bitterness. Mouth is quite bubbly as would be expected. Drinkability is very good; this is a great mellow ale and easy to drink once the head is tamed. Watch for the 9% ABV, however. Great sipping beer.  Overall: A great Belgian strong pale, heartily recommended. I still prefer Unibroues Trois Pistoles (a strong dark), however.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,IntriqKen,4.8,"Ok...here I am not worthy. Poured a cloudy orange amber that almost glowed in the glass with a gorgeous super white head that took forever to melt to a nice ring lacing. The aroma was incredible...literally, I could smell this forever and still not be able to describe it. Cloves, tangerines, mandarin oranges, bread yeast, and alcohol. The mouthfeel was so full of tiny carbonation it was almost hard to get to the flavors. Again, tangerines, cloves, a bit of lemon, and bread yeast. Aftertaste is fresh and clean from a slight citrus drying. The tangerine/orange flavor just goes on forever. This is one incredible beer. Again I could smell this forever.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Cresant,4.8,"Poured from a 12 oz. (twist off?) bottle dated best before 10/12/08. When I popped the top the foam gushed out! Hurriedly poured into a Duvel tulip I received a glass 3/4 full of white froth. Head eventually settled to a sparse, yet contstant layer on top. The body was clouded and the color of a butterscotch disk.  I would add a sixth dimension to note about this beer, sound. The head was so healthy that it piqued the aural sense. The beer sounded like the fizzle of a bubble bath.  Smell was of hay, yeast, and alcohol (ETOH). Perhaps cloves too.  Taste was a pleasant tartness up front and a candy-like maltiness later. Mild cloves, oranges, and maybe carrot cake. ETOH held in check/masked and was less apparent than the aroma suggested.  Creamy full bodied mouthfeel.  I was ready for more after this bottle. I will seek this out again! One of my new favorites.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,villainchiwwin,4.7,"poured from 12 oz. bottle into pint glass. luminous golden color with fine vigourous streams of bubbles rising in columns - little bit of fizzy head fell away fast. delightful nose held apple, slight yeast, clove, maple sugar candy, and pear notes. very slight, sweet pear and flower flavor to start, then honey and fruit followed by clove spiciness and alcohol warmth. subtle but lengthy finish. excellent texture and a light body; softness changes to a tickling of the tongue before finishing dry.  cellaring some to discern the effects of age on this special brew. near ideal as it is, though!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,orsulacp,4.22,"Poured from a bottle with a best before date of 02-23-09. It poured a clear golden color with a fluffy white head. There are all types of things in the smell, some banana, some orange, and a bit of clove. The taste is sweet and spicy, the tight carbonation really adds to the peppery bite. The sweetness is like a Clementine. The mouthfeel is medium-light with plenty of carbonation. There is a slight alcohol warming from the 9%, but all the flavors hide it in the taste.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,cjgator3,4.23,"Poured into a tulip with a golden/light orange body and a beautiful three finger head. Aroma is a wonderful mixture of pears, bananas and yeast and other fruits. Taste much like the smell as it has an array of fruits and a very crisp finish. This is a sensational beer that actually resembles a hefeweizen in both smell and taste. Definately a world-class offering from Unibroue and a must try!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Appearance is nice with a big head that falls very thin and just barely breaks, and it has a good lacing.The color is light gold to brown with hints of orange.  Smell has orange, banana-almost like a hefeweizen, apple.  Taste is light and hard to identify at first. It has cloves, orange and banana are very apparant and fruity. Very light in body and warming to the insides.  Mouthfeel isn't very well carbonated and is a bit watery, still somehow very appealing.  I like this and will look for another bottle, hopefully fresher.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TheManiacalOne,3.7,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A: The beer is a hazy pale yellow color with large foamy white head that leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: Heavy yeast aroma with a touch of alcohol.  T: The same bready, yeasty character, from the smell, comes out strongly in the flavor and dominates throughout. There are touches of honey, malt and just a bit of alcohol (but not even close to 9.00% worth).  M: Light-to-medium body, crisp and very smooth, medium carbonation and a very clean finish.  D: The yeast character masterfully disguises the alcohol content, which, along with the smoothness, makes this beer very drinkable. This was the first beer that I’ve had from Unibroue. It has left me with the impression that this brewery doesn’t mess around.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,soulgrowl,4.4,"Cellared for at least six months.  Appearance: Bright orange gold with a smidge of haze. Enormous soapy head rises high and stands its ground, even getting larger after the pour (in a tulip glass with etching on the inside).  Smell: Mimosa-like aroma of champagne, tangerine juice, bright but not overpowering alcohol, apple skin, limes, and some amazing spicy and bready yeast.  Taste: Smooth, mellow, and delicious as hell. Lush, fruity, citric notes abound. Pear, white grape, banana, clove. What is this, some kind of kicked-up hefe? There are leafy, wheaty, floral, and doughy notes as well. This is just about as complex as they come, but still very smooth and well-balanced.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, smooth, lightly acerbic.  Drinkability: This is an awesome beer. Respect it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,hoffman,4.23,"A brilliant pour, nice with a thin frothy head comprised of smallish white bubbles. The color is straw yellow/orange amzingly clear, I could actually view an upside down transposition of the spurs mavericks game in the convex of my snifter, kinda neat. The smell is faint, very little if any aroma for my nose, a bit of soft yeasty sugar and some grassy organic notes. The taste is a knock out, a great smooth, sweet fruity beginning, a nice flowing center where the alchohol becomes more pronounced but not overbearing, then a mildly dry finish gives way to the creamy yeast notes. Really good. The mouthfeel is very full and creamy...which is offset nicley by the tingle of carbonation that rises while to beer is in your mouth. An unbelievably drinkable masterpiece, almost quaffable at...what...9% abv...remeber to call a cab if you are out with this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,SilentSabre,2.99,"I have had this before, but I felt I should revisit it. I wasn't exactly left speechless over it. I wasn't awful; certainly not! I simply didn't think it was 'outstanding'. I looked quite nice as it poured from its 750mL bottle into my goblet. A bit of chill haze, slightly cloudy. Continuous streams of bubbles ascend to the surface. Head is medium sized, loosely knit bubbles in a snow white froth that dissipates after about 60 seconds. Smell is dank, damp basement, almost like a lambic, alcohol, some fruits I cannot readily identify. It isn't awful, but I was certainly not impressed. Taste was spice, fruit, alcohol, and in that order. Again, not terrible, but not impressive, either. Mouthfeel was on the back end of medium in weight, if that makes any sense. Drinkability is a bit tough to call on this one. I seem to think so, anyway. The 9.0%abv is fairly noticeable, and there really isn't an amazing flavour profile. At the same time, it's pretty smooth and as a fan of Belgian farmhouse ales, I like the wet basement characteristics. This was okay I suppose...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,tkarsies,4.23,"Served from 750 mL bottle at room temp in wine goblet. Vintage 2005. Easy pour produced 1.5 inch white head over clear gold that slowly recedes to leave lacing that remains until the glass is empty Active carbonation that lasts and lasts. Smell is fruity, spicy, citrusy, slight alcohol on the nose. Yummy. Tastes of malt, sweetness, yeasty, banana like wheat beer. Some spiciness and fruit present. Very complex. Slight bitterness. Alcohol is not very noticeable except warming in the throat and belly. Mouthfeel is light due to active carbonation. Is there alcohol in this? Way too drinkable for this ABV. You dont notice the strength until it jumps up and bite you. This is great example of a Belgian-style ale from here in North America. I will definitely be seeking this out again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,MCDuhamel,4.94,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Westmalle chalice.  A: Golden orange, somewhat hazy but glows translucently against a light. White head with large bubbles, which quickly dissipates to a thin film with a tighter ring around the chalice.  S: Citrusy (not grapefruit like an American Pale Ale but more lemony), with a note of honey and spices.  T: Begins with a sweet malt, then moves into a tart but balanced flavor with a slight hop bitterness and a noticeable prickliness from the high carbonation. Fades into a dry finish. Throughout, the phenolic character of the yeast strain is evident, but well-integrated.  M: Light, but somewhat viscous, like a well-carbonated honey might be.  D: Unbelievably quaffable. It has no hint of its quite high ABV.  Overall: In my view, the best abbey triple available in Ohio. Beers from Unibroue are usually found here in very good condition, unlike some of the true Belgians which sometimes sit on store shelves for months or longer with wide variations in storage temperature. This is simply an outstanding beer and the epitome of the style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

This is after my forcing him to sample many types of premium mircros from Saisons to Irish Stouts. I don't know what is a better compliment than that.  Apperence - Golden yellow  Smell - nice grainy smell. I'm not as good as a lot of you at describing smell. It just smelled grainy and fresh.  Taste - Reminded me a lot of most Belgian whites at first. Spicy, complex, but light at the same time. In fact if you had not told me it was brewed in Quebec, I would have swore it was Belgian. It really is amazing how well Unibroue does at making Belgian style beers. It reminded me a lot of Hoegaarden with the contrast and color turned up so to speak. It is just deeper, more full, and more round.  Mouthfeel - a smidge on the bubbly side. Nothing particularly bad here, but the carbonation can overwhelm if drank too quickly.  Drinkability - Great! Goes down easy. I have pretty well destroyed a 750 ml in the last 45 minutes, so watch out. It is easy to drink quick but a shame to not enjoy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,edskirk3,4.22,"I bought this bottle over a month ago, and thought I'd save it for June 6, 2006. But if the world actually ends that day, who will be around to read this review?  It's a 750mL bottle with a picture of the Newfoundland penninsula on the label under a celestial spotlight of some sort. I'm supposed to enjoy it by 11-21-08.  With a startling cork pop (wasn't really expecting that), I pour some into my trusty Orval goblet. La Fin du Monde presents itself with a clear, very slightly amberish gold, with fine yeast particulates floating around, and an effervescent white head that goes away as quickly as if it were Coca-Cola. I should note at this point that I am tasting this ale at room temperature.  It's a pungent aroma. Spiciness, yeast, orange peel, and alcohol. There's a lot of things going on that I am not yet sophisticated enough to describe.  The taste is equally complex. Similar to the aroma it seems, but in a different order. There's coriander (I think... or cloves) spice, alcohol, a twinge of sweetness, and generic citrus features but no yeast bite, by which I am suprised considering the amount of yeast sediment sitting at the bottom of this bottle. Overall, it makes me want some gorgonzola.  It's sticky and very carbonated like champagne. The alcohol warmth stays only for a little bit, while an oily/creamy feeling lingers. I don't know which.  A little expensive to drink regularly but I'm enjoying this, and that's not the alcohol talking. It's not something you chug at a barbecue, but rather something to be sipped by the fireplace while reading Chaucer or something.  Maybe I should have chilled it at least a few minutes.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Possibly some wheat in the nose as well. Quite pleasant. Somewhat tart and highly phenolic flavor. Fruit/orange was prominent. Body was medium and the mouthfeel somewhat prickly.

The bottle looks great, full of color and character, making it very appealing to the eye, but that's just the beginning. As I poured it into the glass, my heart started racing, my hand sweating. Did i see a hot chick walk across the floor? No, this beer really looks that good. The golden orange color is bold, the head a heavenly white and very thick. I unfortunately couldn't smell much since nose was a little clogged, but if anything I did smell some wheat. Taste is overwhelmingly refreshing. It is bold, revitalizing, and quite a treat. It truly is the best of the Belgian Strong Pale Ales. At first, the orange-like citrus flavors emerge, bombarding the palette with rich and lucious textures, with slight undertones of wheat and bread, especially in the aftertaste. There is no overstating the strong and pronounced taste of this beer. Duvel is very subdued in comparison. I could not feel any alcohol in this beer, as I did in others the same night, and no... my senses were not dulled by then.  All in all, a very enjoyable and exquisite beer. Truly one that I would like to have over and over, especially after meals... Kudos to Canada!!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Smell phenolic, wheat, yeasty like a witbier or weizen Taste dry and fruity with distinct wheat flavours, alcohol was very well hidden. Very easy to drink and refreshing. This appears to be the same yeast profile as the Raftman and Maudite, which I feel is not the right yeast for these brews. I might be spoiled with Belgium just around the corner, but this tastes like a witbier with extra alcohol. Not bad, not bad at all, but there is a reason why it is called ""'witbier' yeast. Because it complements the flavours contributed by the wheat.  Again, this is not a bad beer, but I cannot understand why this beer gets these very high grades.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Came out pretty foamy, but I think some of that's because I didn't let it rest after I got it out of the car. Otherwise, the color is magnificent glowy honey color with a nice stream of bubbles. Head sticks around awhile too.  Smells boozy and acidic, in a good way I suppose. Faint citrus, not unlike a wheat beer.  Tastes not unlike a high quality wit beer too. Very dry though and I can see how people might consider there to be an ""herbal"" flavor.  Heavy considering the color. I sucked some foam off the top before it settled and I think I got tipsy off of that. It's a confusing feel because though it's very smooth, I do feel some astrigency going down....?  A good beer, but I'm afraid I'm not a huge fan of the style. There's something about it, more than just the color, that reminds me of a cheaper wheat beer. Also, it doesn't hide the booze as well as say, Delirium Tremens. I'd drink it again for sure, but I would be reluctant to pay $8.xx for 4.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The aroma is very rich in clove spice along with hard cider and an under-ripe pineapple tartness. I get a little bit of a grainy character, but it's shadowed by all the posisitve attributes. After the sip, the first wave of flavors that come are of the raw spiciness along with sweet, ripened fruits. The sweetness then falls out and is placed by a slight acidic twang in the sides of the mouth. All the while, the powerful phenols have lightened up as well and have become more of a lingering flavor on the palate to accompany the acidity, alcohol warmth, and aftertaste of smooth malt. Rich in complexities. The mouthfeel does not burden you with heaviness, which is good. If this were any thicker, I think that it (combined with the rich flavor profile) would wear me out.  Definately one of Unibroue's finest.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JayQue,4.5,"I have only tried two Belgian Strong Pale Ales (Delirium Tremens being the other one), The La Fin Du Monde is very similar, but slightly better IMHO. Pours a cloudy dull gold/straw color with a nice carbonated head that slowly dissipates. Little to no lacing. Prominent nose of citrus...lemony aroma. The taste is really good....citrus, astringent, sweetness, All nicely balanced and very drinkable. The taste reminds me of Hefe's but the mouthfeel is richer. Drinkability is very good. The alcohol is well disguised, I could have enjoyed another one. Three would be be pushing it because of the high ABV. This beer, Delerium Tremens and Aventinus have sharpened my palate for astringent beers. This one deserves the reputation it has. Truly a great beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TheBungyo,4.5,"Easily the most luscious and inviting head I've had the pleasure of seeing. It reminds me of the frothy top of a handmade milkshake; imparting the impression that it was homemade with lots of love. Body is straw colored gold with light carbonation. I would call the nose lemony, but with the disclaimer that it is in no way sour. Also along for the aroma ride is a smell I can only call pleasantly milky and a hefty amount of spice. Taste is at once full of mildly sweet lemon, spice, a dash of sweet milk, and smatter of bitterness. Says I to the mouthfeel, ""a winner is you"" as it is big and full. The light carbonation enhances its creaminess. The lacing looks like a work of art, or more aptly, something drawn from a nitro tap. Yet another head turning Unibroue beer. Thank you Beer Advocate, for had I not become a member, I would not know the pleasure of this fine brewery.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,sinstaineddemon,3.38,"A- pours a dark orange with heavy carbonation with a full finger of white head that fades slowly and uniformally  S - a distinct spicy aroma, resembling cloves; with a definite hint of orange peel  T - hmmm, the taste is spicy like herbal teas with hops, surprisingly smooth, dont taste the champagne that the label says  M - it is very fizzy on my tongue from  D - moderate drinkability",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,rousee,4.12,Orangey apricot color appearance. Fairly murky too. Nice 3mm head remains throughout. Smell is clean and fruity.

22,34,Wasatch,4.5,"Revist: 16 Jun 2015 12oz. Bottle BB: 11-17-2017  Poured into a chalice a very nice cloudy pale yellow color, very nice carbonation, with a two-finger foamy/creamy white head, which leaves a HUGE island in the middle of the glass, with some very nice sticky lacing. The nose is very malty and yeasty, with some nice banana, coriander, slight citrus notes, and a nice touch of spices. The taste is very very nice, malty, yeasty, fruity, and spicy. Medium body, ABV is hidden very well. Overall another Unibroue classic. It's been awhile since the last time I've had this one, will buy again alot sooner.  750ml  A - Pours a cloudy pale yellow color, tons of carbonation, very nice white foamy head, tons of lacing throughout the drink.  S - Scents of malts, yeast, citrus, and some spices.  T - The taste is sweet but tangy, with a nice dry finish. The alcohol content is hidden very well.  M - Medium body, nice carbonated feel, well rounded brew.  D - Very drinkable. Another excellent brew from Unibroue. Would highly recommend and buy again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,hero27,3.98,"Silver foil-wrapped 12oz bottle. Best before 10/04/08. 9% abv.  Hazy glowing peach color with enough yeast chunks to make a snowglobe jealous. Aroma is sweet malts and a light orange-y fruit smell. The spices remain tasteful and compliment the yeast flavors well. Mouthfeel is very creamy with a slightly dry finish. Damn, this stuff is downright dangerous, as easy to drink as it is.  I remember the 750ml I had a while back to be a tad better..maybe that's because by the time I was finished with that, I was not in the same state as I am now. A great North American-made Belgian..and another feather in the cap for Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,VoodooBrew,4.38,"Big, generous white head sits atop the hazy, golden-yellow body. A fresh, airy aroma of fruit features on the nose. Delicately spicy malt appears on the palate. Yeasty, slightly bready flavors give way to a semi-sweet medium finish. The ample head on this beer (not to mention the high ABV) belies its smooth, accomodating nature. La Fin Du Monde is highly satisfying and rewarding. This beer is becoming a classic in its own right.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,EvilKeith,3.78,"12 ounce brown bottle- best before 04-05-08  Pours a murky burnt orange color with three fingers of sudsy foam head. Head drops to one finger with an impressive sticky lace. The carbonation has a steady stream of bubbles working their way to the surface.  Smell is of bananas and somewhat buttery with notes of a sweet white wine.  This was my first time trying a Unibroue product. If their other products offer the same combination of complexity and subdued character I think I will enjoy the rest of their beers and ales.  The taste is somewhat hard to put into words. Banana and other fruits with a bit of spiciness. Again the taste and alcohol gives this a white wine-like character.  Mouthfeel is wine-like. I would call this medium bodied. Carbonation is slightly higher than expected, but overall it works well with this strong ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,3Vandoo,5,"This is a special review actually, the sampling was done at my house and some BA's were also there, Goldorak, Gordero and Bubbabeerbacon.  Big mucho thanko to Bubba's connection that was able to bring us a Fin du monde aged 10 years directly from Unibroue's cellar! And this was wonderfull. Here the review.  Very cloudy deep golden beer, with a good medium head that fought her way to stay alive.  Citrus nose that comes out of that beer with some sort of sourness, actually it was like some Saison.  Taste was very citrus like, with some rich fruity flavors with a shy sourness end. Then the beer brings a nice sweety flavours reminding us of Ice Cidre, and no Unibroue's yeast flavors were present.  Superb experience!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,WMBierguy,4.36,"The beer pours out a straw gold, and has a magnificent head that stays around for minutes and leaves lacing down the side of the glass.. Has a very clean taste. The beer is very strong, but the alcohol is subtle. Excellent example of a non-Belgian Belgian; the flavor is very authentic, and can stand toe to toe with any Beligian tripel that I've tried. I definately recommend it",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,nickss,4.28,"I've had this beer many times before... suppose it's about time I reviewed this beauty.  Pours a gorgeous cloudy yellow with hues of orange. Monstrous rocky 2"" head.... lots of apparent carbination.  Big yeast aroma, so typical of this style... wonderful representation from a North American brewery. Crisp and refreshing citrus slices through the yeast. Deep malty undertones finish this one off.  Huge chewy yeast flavour paired with banana makes this brew simply fantastic. Noticeable malt, but certainly nowhere close to the dominant flavour of this beauty. A faint hint of red delicious apple is noticeable in this one as well.  Huge and chewy in the mouth, with a fair amount of stinging carbonation. Just about right... no complaints here.  Where is the alcohol? This brew is damn drinkable for a 9%... another in a long line of many winners from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jj21,4.83,"Outstanding vision pours into the glass. Thick white head topping a hazy golden beer. Great retention and lacing. Aromas or citrus and bananas loft and linger even when the glass is away from your nose. Flavors of cloves, citrus, yeast and crisp sweetness. I could hardly sense the 9.0% alcohol in this beer. Outstanding!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,assurbanipaul,4.48,"Pours a light orange/gold with a tall white head. Nose is yeasty and citrusy, somewhere between freshly baked bread and fruit salad.  Taste is very bready and sweet. I get solid elements of yeast, bananas, cloves, white pepper, white grapes and apple juice. Layered flavors that blend very well without becoming cloying. No trace of its high ABV in either the taste or aroma.  Mouthfeel is medium, very smooth, well-carbonated, texture like a wheat ale. Style exists somewhere between a Belgian tripel and a hefeweizen. Widely available and eminently drinkable, enough to get you into trouble.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BigDaddyWil,4.15,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a La Chouffe tulip glass. Best before date on back label: 12-10-2006.  Even with a slow pour, this brew has a huge, fluffy, brilliant white head. Lots of yeast sediment in the bottom of the bottle. Not much head retention, fades to a paper thin white line. Color is light orange, very cloudy and lots of carbonation. Decent aromas of fruits, cider, yeast, apples and pears. Very well rounded taste, fruity, tart and sweet all at once. Alcohol is not a factor. Awesome mouthfeel, this beer dances all over your tongue and leaves you wanting more. So easy to drink and very enjoyable. My first from Unibroue. A great sipper. I will certainly try more of their beers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,theo692,3.99,"A beautiful beer, and a surprise at that. Drank it cold (perhaps a little too cold) at Lumiere in Vancouver from a red-wine glass.  Head was a little on the thin side, but it smelled wonderful: nutty and complex. Color was hard to gauge (it was a candle-lit type restaurant), but pleasantly ""burnt amber.""  Flavor was on par with many Belgian tripels (it brought to mind Grimbergen). First taste was excellent, and the flavor remains throughought. Easy to drink with very little alcohol taste, and it was consistent from the first sip to the last.  I am on a hunt for this beer in my hometown. Not to be missed, and cheaper than a true Belgian, for everyday drinking.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Hautacam,4.7,"This is a great one ! Poured out a hazy , slightly orange gold...a very active head ( it was bubbling out of the neck ).Head settles down to a collar in a Duvel chalice. Smells very fruity with some clove and yeast...really nice. Taste is fantastic...especially as it warms up...very complex..must be every tangy fruit flavor I've ever had blended into this..balanced very well with clove, alcohol, sugar and hops. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a pretty smooth, velvety, micro carbonation. Great. Very drinkable...another amazing Unibroue...boy , can they make beer!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,daliandragon,4.05,"This beer emits foam from the bottle head after the cork pops, but moves so slowly it practically solidifies in mid air. I've been looking at this beer on the shelf at the beer store, knowing someday I'd be in for a treat and today was the chosen day. The color is light and airy in appearance, similar to apple juice, but as difficult to see through as Guinness. Thin but resiliant head. The nose is spicy and mixed with the familiar ""bananaclove"" flavor usually found in a hefe. The alcohol is masked brilliantly. The nose is also improving rapidly as it warms. The taste is strong and flavorful but finishes very clean and with a dry, mellow aftertaste. Definitely at certain breaks in the sip the taste shades towards champagne before the thicker texture takes it back towards ale country. This is a quality product. It's not perfect but definitely deserves a place among the better Grand Cru types.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,scruffwhor,4.21,Poured from a 12oz bottle.  Appearance- Pours an impressive head with great retention throughout the entire beer with good lacing. The color is a bright burnt orange.  Smell- Reminds me of a Yankee Candle and Tandy Leather store. A blend of sugary sweet and earthy smells miced with a hint of leather.  Taste- Starts out an earthy wheat mixed with cooked orange sugars. The finish brings in some of the floral hop flavor and a more sauteed malt sweetness.  Mouthfeel- Pretty light and no real warmth gained from the 9% alcohol content. But The hops are noticed more on the back of the palate with all the sweeter stuff shocasing in the front. Th ecarboantion helps to enhance the flavors all around.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,phisig137,3.87,"Corked and caged bottle, best before 1-2009. Pours into my tulip a nice looking wheaty gold color, with a cloud like pure white head. Lacing is abundant on the sides of the glass. Aroma is almost purely yeast esters, and all spicy. No fruit present here. Black pepper, coriander, cardamom, and malted wheat. Flavor is much the same, heavily spicy, slight malt flavor, wheat is present again, and has a nice dry hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is full, but disapates quitely, does not truly linger for much time. Very drinkable.  I'm not sure why, but I seem to think ""Imperial Wit bier"". Fantastic beer for the value, and great for a warm night outside on the balcony.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Fugazme,4.82,"A wonderful looking blonde-colored beer. Pours with a 1/2"" head with real staying power. Sticks to the glass like crazy. Hazy and beautiful. Some yeast suspension. Great.  Aroma is one of a kind. Spicy, yeasty and slightly phenolic. Peaches. A complex sweetness that hangs in the nostrils. Exceptionally fresh smelling. Clovey and grassy at times. Bananna. Absolutely great.  Mouthfeel is very smooth. Sweet and tasty like honey. Strong yeast flavor. Very breadlike. A small touch of hops on the back of the swallow.  Again... Absolutely great.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,Boto,4.47,"12oz. bottle: This beer come out of the bottle quite fizzy, leaving quite a head. It dropped away to nothing almost immediately. The beer itself is a cloudy, darker golden color. This has a very nice aroma. The spiciness (pepper and corriander) is the first thing that you note, followed off by a citirc breadiness. There is still a touch of the fiziness to the tongue, quite suprisingly. The taste is that of a good medium bodied beer, but the carbonation makes it taste lighter. Notes of breadiness, citrus and corriander to the taste. A very nice tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,dogboy,4.3,"Wow. This stuff is good. I've just moved to Canada (from England) and I was perusing the shelves of a local liquor store and bemoaning the cost of import beer (UK and Belgium stuff costs a fortune here). I picked up a bottle of Unibroue Terrible and got into a conversation with a lady that was grabbing armfuls of Unibroue stuff. Anyway, to cut a long story short, she bought all the La Fin Du Monde they had, but told me it was great! I took my bottles over to the counter and found she'd bought a bottle for me! Thanks lady. I just finished gulping most of it down. It reminds me of one of my favourite Belgium beers - Delerium Tremens. It pours a hazy golden colour and once settled is very quaffable. Excellent stuff and I shall be trying more of this in the very near future.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bennetj17,4.58,"I'm delighted by the massive, three finger head on this brew. Retention is nice and lacing is also fine. Color is a deep orange/tan, and is very cloudy. Smell is a wonderful mix of citrus flavors, spice, wheat, and slight floral characters. Tastes very complex and strong. Spicy citrus, orange, lemon, etc, in a bready malt mix, which is both sweet and tangy with a slightly sour finish in which the 9% alcohol is well disguised. Immense carbonation strikes the edeges of the tongue, and the feel is rich with a nice medium body. Coats the palate well. With a near perfect balance of flavors it is a very drinkable selection, and a must have to be kept in your fridge at all times...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Taste was pretty darn delicious. nutmeg, cloves, spices. an excellent sour quality that i really liked. smooth. delicious. this is great stuff. not too spicy or harsh like some other belgian strongs. mmm. maybe i'll get another Unibroue for next month.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,geexploitation,4.72,"I've loved this beer (and a few of the other Unibroues) for a long time, but this is my first time reviewing it. Pours a hazy gold with bubbles continuously fighting upwards from the bottom of my Duvel glass. Beautiful nose, big but still delicate, with loads of fruits and cloves... and an underlying nectary sweetness. Taste is huge, with fruity sweetness, clove, and a peppery alcoholic tinge. Lots of effervescent bubbles on the tongue and a nice, long, warm finish. This isn't a beer you can knock back (due to the ABV), but it's so rich in its flavors and light in its touch that it doesn't matter. You get a night's worth of flavors in one glass. Phenomenal.

A hint of alcohol in the nose.  T: Complex taste with fruity flavors of banana, tropical fruits, and citrus that are balanced nicely with a strong pale malt flavor. A moderate tartness is present in the finish.  M: Very dense and heavy feeling in the mouth. Finishes dry with a nice warming sensation from the alcohol. A little fizzy, but very good besides that.

22,34,nouseforotacon,4.8,"Just this past spring/summer, sometime in May or June, I ordered a Fin du Monde in a local French bar and it completely changed my outlook on beer. I became fascinated with the subculture of beer appreciation and became a true BA.  This bottle was purchased in Tokyo, best before 02.04.2007. It poured out in a rush, heavy carbonation, with a big + frothy effervescent head and a cloudy, murky orange bottom with lots of visible sediments. The head maintaned itself for most of the drinking session.  Aroma was malty/doughy, smell of yeast definitely present. Spicy and citrusy with zesty orange-peel notes, a well-balanced combo of floral/fruit and peppered aromas. Also, some honey noticeable.  The taste was sharp, champagne-like with dry white grapes and a bit powdery in the mouthfeel. Touch of chocolate and spice on the tongue, very hoppy + carbonated, and the bittersweet orange peel resurfaced itself in the taste. A bit alcoholic in the nose and the mouthfeel, nothing too overwhelming. Drinkability is truly exceptional, I always find this one hard to put down.  I've got a corked 750mL resting at home for me, so I'll give it another go with that one in a couple of years. Fin du Monde is a truly wonderful achievement from the people at Unibroue. I'm just glad that this was the first brew that led to my appreciation and enjoyment of finer beers. A great discovery.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,sweethome,4.32,"Had this many times - just getting around to rating here... Pours hazy golden color. A rather large fluffy head that leaves behind some large bubbles.  What a nose - complex - corriander, apples, lemongrass, and yeast.  Enters very soft, like a belgian white. The alcohol fire presents, but not overly. Champaign charachter. FIlls out nicely.  The flavors mirror the nose. Some rock-candy sugar flavor thrown in for good measure. A little sour apple too.  A fine interpretation of the style. Very quaffable, but really sneeks up on you. Hard to believe it is 9%.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,jakester,4.6,"I got this 12 oz. bottle as a single at Union Jack's on the Manatawny. I drank it in a goblet. Best Before date of 05-19-08(!) on the label. YAY!  Pours a slightly hazy yellow/gold with a huge 2"" head of white foam. Carbonation looks very active. The head falls to a good coating and a ring, with excellent lacing.  Aroma is a complex combination of pils malt, yeast, cloves, nutmeg, and lemons. Smells are inviting. After several minutes, the smell is very clean, spicy, and citrusy.  Flavor is pils malt, spices like above, lemons, yeast, tart and delish. Alcohol warmth sneaks through very slightly as it warms. Residual sweetness is low to medium. Aftertaste is long citrus and pils malt. This has a great aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is clean and crisp, light to medium bodied, with sparkling carbonation. Alcohol warmth is very well hidden. This feels good on your tongue. Great burps! Finish is on the dry side.  This might sound dumb, but I could drink this all day. (Well, at least until I passed out!). This is delicious, complex, crisp, delicate and robust at the same time. Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 2 1/4"" white head above the translucent dark golden brew. Pillowy head lasts and lasts, a product of the active bubbling from the bottom of the glass, with ample sticky white lacing. Aroma is effervescent spicy pale malts. Taste is that Belgian-style spicy malt that we all know, closing with the most subtle alcohol warming. Mouthfeel is nice, but could be a bit smoother, and drinkability is only limited by the fact that the sweetness and alcohol finally begin to wear after awhile. A nice treat after a snowy day.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Noxious26,3.78,"341ml bottle poured in a snifter. Part of Collection 2006, a 12-pack sampler from Unibroue.  Golden apricot in colour and hazy. Lots of little carbonation streams. Cream coloured head is over an inch high and foamy and thick. Excellent head retention.  Aroma is predominantly fruity and spicy. Apples, apricots, peaches, spices and that unmistakable belgian yeast scent.  Flavour starts off mildly sweet then a sharp solvent/phenol aspect cuts across the palate. After this subdues, spices and cloves calm things down to a lightly hopped and long, drawn out finish that is dry and spicy. Fruity tones pop in here and there from sip to sip.  Surprisingly light bodied, but highly carbonated. Lots of little pin pricks of carbonation meander across the tongue.  Drinkability is a little lower because this is a sipping beer. It is a little hard to pin down though, because for a few sips it's fine and mighty pleasing, then every so often the phenol/solvent aspect hits you a little stronger and puts me off a bit.  Overall, this is a fine sipping beer meant to be savoured over a span of an evening. However, that said, I tend to lean away from most sipping brews.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,doppelmeup,4.5,"Poured a bottle into a Duvel Tulip glass.  Great looking beer. It rivaled Duvel for foamy head, and had beautiful lacing. Head settles down to about a quarter inch that lasted throughout. Not quite as chunky as Duvel. Opaque, orangish yellow color.  Aroma was very Belgian. Yeasty, sugary, fruity.  Tasted much like liquid bubblegum, with some hints of orange and candy. Very well balanced.  Nice mouthfeel. Light carbonation. An excellent finish, leaving the mouth clean and wanting more.  This is an excellent beer. Well balanced, and each sip leaves you wanting more. A little strong to drink a lot of, but an excellent choice that I will buy again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Funky aroma of yeast, pineapple, oranges, and.... breadsticks? Fascinating and enjoyable aromatic values. Nice.  Nice Belgian funkiness in the flavor, strong citrus notes, with a fruity aftertaste. As it warms, it gives a slight astringency that I find unpleasant, but overall pretty good.  Mouthfeel moderate for a Belgian, but still leaving a nice coating on the palate. I would prefer this to be a bit thicker, but it's decent as-is.  This gets a bit cloying after a bit, but overall this is a pretty drinkable beer. Enjoyable, but not for everyday.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

I've been a big fan of Unibroue beers for awhile, but had limited myself to their lighter and their less-challenging fare until I tried this one.  I loved this beer from the moment I poured it. It came out golden and a bit cloudy but still bright. It was effervescent and posessed a thick, dense head that had incredible staying power.  It had a citrus smell to me, and my dinner guests said it had a ""fruity"" smell. I thought it actually smelled a bit like champagne. I don't know if it's intended to have the same orange notes Hoegaarden is so known for, but it certainly smelled like it to me.  The taste started sweet and finished crisp and clean. I could taste malt, but not really a lot of hops. It felt incredibly lively in the mouth and was a pleasure to drink from beginning to end. Easily, this is one of the best beers I've ever had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,dreadnatty08,4.32,Poured a light foamy and highly carbonated brew from my 750ml bottle. Unibroue always gives you away with their highly malty smell.

Popped this sucker open and poured a nice light GOLD ale with tons of tight carbonation bubbles, forming a white creamy, frothy thick, two finger head (with good retention). Nice thick lacing as well.  Initial smell was of stong malt, sweet then a light yeasty aroma. let it sit a minute or so and the smell is of citrus,a tinge of alcohol backed by a more musty yeast finish.  First taste was sweet citrus and earthy with a clean smooth rinse finish, very refreshing.After that much the same with a bit of musty yeast taste, very Belgian Trappist like.Quite drinkable.  In the mouth was smooth into fizzy, mild alcohol presence and tons (almost too much) of carbonation.

22,34,elricorico,4.7,"This beer was one of the first I had from the BA top 100 list, and it always is a pleasure to revisit. I decided tonight I would finally give it its due and review it.  Pours a hazy orange brown with a rocky white head that stands about two inches tall. This fades into a thick creamy centimeter of head that refuses to go away.  The smell is a mix of citrus, candy sugar and slightly bitter hops. Very nice and full.  After 600+ reviews, what more can be said about the taste of this beer? It is perfectly balanced, it has the sweet and the bitter, the dry and tart. Others out there are better at picking out the individual flavours, so I'll just leave it at that.  Mouthfeel is smooth and thick. The carbonation is substantial, but comfortable. This one is also deceptively easy to drink. It doesn't let on that it carries a big alcohol punch, until you've put down a bottle or two.  All in all I'd say it is one of the best beers available to me, and always a safe bet if I don't know which beer I want on a given night.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Very bready aroma with some nice fruitiness and corriander scents. Smells fantastic!  A slightly sweet maltiness upfront with a monster breadiness that follows. This is offset by a nice fruitiness and corriander flavor which then finishes slightly sweet. A bit of alcohol is present at the very end.  Ample carbonation, creamy texture.  This is insanely drinkable for 9.0% ABV. I must have been insane to only buy one bottle!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Shiloh,3.93,"Unibroue has done themselves proud again with this magnifisent product. A hazy golden amber with a full crown of two+ fingers, mountainous glass cling and medium carbonation. The body is just short of being full. The aroma is of spice, citrus and yeast and floral hops. The taste has a tart lemon like beginning mixed with a spicy secondary, the taste is a little short and dry but no real evidence of the high ABV. Very nice.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,OStrungT,4.35,"This beer pours a cloudy straw yellow with a huge, thick, fluffy, white head. The head fades very slowly, leaving a massive amount of laces.  This beer has a spicy aroma up front. Behind that, I detect an earthy yeasty aroma. I can also detect soem lemon and orange peal. Floral hops are also slightly detectable.  This beer has a spicy flavor. Allspice and coriander. It also has a cirtus zest to it. It is slightly sour. I detect lemon. It has a slight yeasty taste also. Hop bitterness is low, but noticable.  This beer goes down smooth, leaving a spicy citruslike aftertaste. This beer is carbonated well for the style.  This beer might not be a great session beer. The alcohol content is a little high. The flavor, though, is great, and not overly aggressive. This beer is definately worth a few tries.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TheEclecticGent,4.42,"Served in a Unibroue snifter glass at Twains in Decatur, GA. Pours a hazy orange / yellow color with a massive sudsy white head (2+ inches). Impressive lacing that curtains the entire glass as I drink. The beer has a Spicy (cloves & nutmeg) and citrus fruit aroma, very nice. A gentle but full flavor of citrus and cloves with a very carbonated mouth feel. The taste includes some bread and banana notes as well. This is a really good beer. Everything I have had from Unibroue has been a smash hit.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,maddamish,4.94,"Ap: Looks a little thin at first and the head wasn't really up to snuff. Medium head with some decent lacing. But that was really all there was to it.  Smell: Cotton Candy, Orange Citrus and Spice. All three of the smells are distinct and mix well with each other.  Taste: Blends the orange, sugar and spice just right. Mouth feel is smooth smooth smooth.  Drinkability: I usually share all my great finds with my friends. I was so impressed with this beer I think I will hoard this to myself. It is that good.  Notes: Please pick this up if you see it in the store. You will be glad you did.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Metalmonk,4.02,"Pours a buoyant head, nice cloudy appearance (I didn't shake the bottle) with tiny yeast floaters dancing around.  The smell is the best part of this one. It's complex: citrus, pear, fresh-baked bread and some floral hops in the background. Spicy too. Awesome.  The flavor is tart, sweet and tangy, which is fine but made a bit too dominant by the abundant carbonation. The bubbles could be less intense, it kind of masks the flavor. Mellow bitterness in the aftertaste. Subtle yeasty funk (in a good way). For the style, it's just too effervescent, dangerously close to being a beer soda than a beer (I have the same problem with Unibroue's Ephemere).  Mouthfeel: vibrant and tingly. You can guess why.  Despite the problems, it's highly drinkable if this style of beer is a favorite, but it's got nothing on the true Belgians in this style. I prefer the top-notch Maudite or Trois Pistoles when it comes to Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Illinick,4.45,"A: BIG, fluffy white head. Pale golden yellow in color, with sticky foaming, cascading, spider-web like lacing. S: Exotic fruit and spice-mostly coriander and spice, with scents of candy and tart fruit/peel. Also a very faint hint of vanilla/almond in background. Also hop presence up front. T: Spicy and alcohol presence at first that becomes more subtle at end of sip. Exotic fruits and rind and peel, candy and yeast present also. Apricot flavors come out as it warms as well as flavors of fruit rind. Bit of hops on the back bone. MF-medium with mouth filling carbonation that ends slightly dry. Overall- An excellent brew, but watch out the 9% abv will get you. Quality brew that is a staple in any beer lovers fridge. A fantastic brew!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Taste is fresh and fruity with pepper and coriander spiciness. A touch of malt and hops bring a nice dry finish. Flavor is complex and well balanced. High alcohol content is well concealed but does present a slight astringency that lingers on the tongue.  Mouthfeel is light and very drinkable.  This is a very intersting and enjoyable brew.

22,34,SkeeterHawk,4.42,"1-24-06 Since I had such a bad review last time, I thought that I would try this one again...but a fresher example this time (Best before 10-13-08). The last time I thought I would try an expired one...not such a good idea. So here I go.  Appearance: Pours a cloudy orange golden color with a pillowy white head that was over an inch thick after a slow pour. The head was falling within a minute or so to be sustained by the bubbles rising. There is no real lacing on the glass after drinking.  Aroma: I got some really bready aromas while I was pouring the beer from the bottle. Now that the head has faded a touch, you can pick up a bunch of fresh citrus aromatics. This citrus is hanging out with some spicy aromas that I am still learning to identify. I smell Lavender and what I believe is a coriander aroma. There is a good bit of hop in this one that really gives the beer a fresh edge. This is definitely one to be drank fresh. As the beer warms, the citrus fades a bit to let the floral and spiciness start to contribute more. The beer stays pretty bready the entire time.  Taste: There is a lot going on in the flavor. The beer starts out with a defined sweetness, but you can't pick this up for long as the carbonation takes over and leaves a super foamy mess to try to swallow. Gee whiz...I guess I am ""swirling"" less next time. There is a pretty significant hop presence in here that is another point to drinking it fresh. The finish is pretty dry with enough body to let you know that you just drank a serious beer. Very late in the finish, there is a soothing warming in the stomach that sticks around for quite some time. As the beer warms up, the alcohol gets quite a bit more noticeable and the entire flavor profile takes on more of a spicy edge.  Opinion: Well, I can definitely say that this beer needs to be drank fresh. I am thinking that the date on the bottle is optimistic. I am a bit unclear as to the distinction between a Belgian Pale Ale and a Tripel. I think that this is more of a Tripel...but I know those a bit better than the Pale Ales. With Duvel in the Pale Ale category on this site...I would tell you not to expect anything that tastes like that beer. This is more of a Tripel, and a nice one at that.   8-18-05 The bottle had a ""best before"" date of 07-05-04...so this is one of the main reasons that I bought it at 9%ABV.  Appearance: The beer poured almost completely clear with a few super tiny ""floaties"". There was about 1/4 inch head at first pour that fell pretty quickly to a very small layer held together only by the bubbles rising.  Aroma: Some citrusy hops in the nose at first pour. There are Lemons and Oranges noticeable specifically, along with some spiciness from the alcohol I presume. There is a tad of sherry here that I believe is from its age.  Taste: The taste has a lot more to offer than the aroma. It has some sweet citrus that you notice in the beginning that is backed up by a slight Sulfury note. There isn't a lot of candy noticeable in this beer, and it finishes tasting well attenuated. I wish that there was the same assertive carbonation that you get with other examples.  Opinion: Well, maybe I made a mistake buying an older example of this beer. I was hoping that it would have gained in complexity and effervescence...adding a bit of tart and a bit drier finish. What I have instead is an undercarbonated and slightly Oxidized Tripel. It still tastes pretty good, and I imagine that a fresh one would make all of the difference to me. I will definitely try this beer again, but I will be looking for a fresher example next time.  A = 3.5 S = 4.0 T = 4.0 M = 3.0 D = 3.5",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,DaPeculierDane,4.5,"A: This is by far the lightest (in color and body) of Belgian Strong Darks that have really impressed me. Generally, I like this style big, full, and caliginous. La Fin du Monde on the other hand is a brilliant incandescent gold with a nice amount of lively haze and a super sticky white head.  S: Fetching clementine and banana aromas dominate, followed by cloves and medicinal phenyls.  T: Spicy citrus. Pear and mango enter the mix. Clove flavors continue.  MF: Smooth and creamy with kicking carbonation.  Drinkabity is extreme considering the ABV.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,danielocean03,4.1,"Poured a hazy golden color into an oversized wine glass, thick and foamy white head exhibits nice retention before slowly giving way to heavy lacing. Smells of malts and spices, citrus, yeasty bread, slight sting of alcohol present on the nose. Tastes absolutely incredible, hits with citrus and hops first, then a little fruiter, banana flavor present some, finishing a little on the yeasty side with the malt flavor and a slight bite from the 9% abv that is easily forgotten when drinking this lighter ale. Mouthfeel is slick and moderately carbonated. Drinkability the lowest point of this brew, and although suprisingly light and refreshing as this ale is, still has far too complex of a taste and too high of an abv to want to just drink any more than two or three of these exsquisite brews in one sitting. Hats off to Unibroue with ""The End of the World.""",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,rodrot,4.08,"This beer poured a slightly hazy, golden color with a half inch head. The aroma was fruity and also had undertones of bread/yeast. The taste was of candi sugar, citrus and sweet malt. Very tasty and without a doubt has a Belgian character. The finish was spicy and slightly alcoholic with the sweet/candi sugar taste making itself known again. This beer is a treat for sure, but 2 bottles is my limit. The 9% abv sneaks up on you if you're not careful.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,troutmask96,3.87,"This is a truly exceptional Belgian Pale Ale. Just a shade less good than the vanguard of its class, Duvel. Pours a nice fizzy head with very tight carbonation. Taste is of all the good things you'd expect from the triple-fermentation process: currants, cinnamon, pepper, coriander. A bit heavy on the carbonation to score higher in mouthfeel, and its high ABV takes away from its drinkability. But there are few better ""sippers"" in the world...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,wingnutter,3.7,"Cloudy/hazy yelorange with a nice tight head.  Smells a bit like a hefe weizen - banana, citrus, yeastiness, breadiness, and confectioners sugar.  Clove/banana softness as I take my first sip. Bready. Yeasty. Has a candy sweetness that isnt cloying, but rather complimentary to the other flavors.  Crisp, refreshing, but also feels heavy. A decent after dinner brew to sip and relax with.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,nvsblman,4,Light copper color with a fluffy white pillow of a head. Loads of tiny bubbles continuously rising to the surface. Lots of sticky lacing. The aroma is dominantly yeasty with some pepper and spices and a little orange zest. Biscuity taste with a nice spicy yeast taste. The champagne like mouthfeel helps make this a very refreshing beer.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Phatz,3.78,"Nice art work on a 12 oz bottle with silver foil wrapped over the cap. Served in my snifter glass slightly above fridge temp.  Pours a hazy orange / yellow color with a sudsy white one finger head. Massive, impressive lacing.  Smell: Very spicy! Citrus fruits like lemon and orange with some mango and apricot. Yeasty. A significant amount of alcohol finds its way through the layers to slightly tug at your nose.  Taste & mouthfeel: A full flavor of gentle citrus hops and bold clove like spices blend into the very carbonated mouth feel to feel like a very active tingly beer. It is light, cool, refreshing, and a good flavor for the style. I personally tend to prefer the Strong Dark to the Belgian Pale Ale. Nonetheless it is a nice brew with some Duvel like characteristics. Mouthfeel: Smooth and hoppy, crisp and sweet. (Hows that for combining two categories)? The truth is the Taste and the Mouthfeel really blend together for an overall refreshing experience.  Drinkability: While this is a refreshing beer, the substantial hopyness, and yeastiness and the alcohol that seeps through, do not make this a chugable beer or a sessionable beer but one glass is quite nice. It is a classy beer that I recommend sipping during dinner or a relaxing evening.  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Manosbeeroffate,4.68,"What's wrong with Unibroue? Jesus I've had so many of their styles and they all have been awsome, this doesn't happen!! Anyway this stuff pours a hazy orange color, non-long lasting head. Taste is a combination of dried apricot and yeasty notes with some alcohol, it blends all perfectly. Nice mouthfeel and finish. I'm glad Unibroue is widely avaliable in Maine, even if it wasn't I could make a road trip to Quebec. This is what beer should be!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Very refreshing smell, almost like a spring day.  T: Tastes very citrusy with hints of pears and bananas and a slight malt hint in there somewhere.  M & D: Very carbonated, almost takes away from the belgian taste. Love that its a high abv--can't taste the alcohol. Very smooth and refreshing with a nice dry fruity (pear) after taste. Drinkability is pretty high, on a summer day of course whlie basking in the hot sun.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,akorsak,4.85,"I am drinking a vintage 2005 750 mL C&C bottle poured into my bran' spankin' new Pauwel Kwak tulip glass. The ale is at an optimal temperature of 45-50 degrees.  Appearance: The ale pours as a nice deep goldenrod color, with a nice head that leaves a pleasing lace down the sides of this long-necked glass. THe alse is not quite clear, but close enough that one can make out whatever is on the other side of the glass.  Smell: The smell of peppers and spices jump out immediately. The pepper is very obvious and adds a hint of spicy heat to the nose. There are also sugars, imparting a slightly sweet note.  Taste: The taste of candied sugars hits the tongue immediately, providing a sweet taste that slowly turns into a strong alcohol presence. Beyond that, the spicy taste of black pepper makes itself known. The malt character is fairly low key, but the hop presence is equally restrained, creating a very smooth evenly blended ale.  Mouthfeel: The ale sites very nicely in the mouth, with the pepper and sugars providing a sweet and bitter interplay. Keep the ale in your mouth and allow it to warm, the alcohol character becomes very apparent.  Drinkability: Despite the 9% abv, the ale is very drinkable, tasting so smooth and balanced, one does not even realize the alcohol until it is WAY too late. An excellent ale from a top notch brewery.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Solid lacing.  The smell is strong alcohol, a little tinge of skunk. A bit of malt aroma.  Flavor is malty and spicy with a strong alcohol presence. Hints of clove and citrus.  Mouthfeel is punchy and astringent, but not harsh. The finish is clean.  This is very smooth for being a 9 percent ale. I'm reviewing outside my favorite styles to try something different.

22,34,BigBry,4.45,"341 ml bottle with silver foil cover cap, from the Unibroue Variety Pack. Stamped code K055 on back label (Nov. 5, 05). Yeasty citrus aroma as soon as the bottle cap came off. This 'liquid gold' poured into a large wine glass hazy and full of carbonation. Huge foamy head, that does settle down, stays a full finger width right til the end. Left lots of stringy lace with large bubbles. The aroma is the familiar Unibroue yeast, citrus, spices like clove. Lots of tastes, strong yeast, tart lemon and orange, clove and pepper. Mouthfeel is thick and coating, but carbonation leaves it dry in the end. Very drinkable for a high alcohol, high flavor beer. Still have a 750ml bottle aging...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,GolgiIPAratus,4.03,"Sampled: 12.28.05  A light white foam head of about an inch & a half rests atop a mostly clear, bright pale gold. Very bright looking, as if it has its own light. Theres a slight yeasty haze, but nothing too thick. Bubbles fade and not much lacing occurs.  The smell is of sweet malts and sugars typical to the tripel/Belgian Pale styles and also possesses the twangy Euro funk of the same.  Theres a tart sweetness off the bat. I know BA calls it a Belgian Strong Pale, but damn if this doesnt taste like a Tripel to me. Oh well, styles shmyles, this is damn good! There is a pilsner-esque hop oil bitterness right at the end that separates it from the tripel style I think though. This beer is HIGHLY carbonated, super bubbly and tingling on the tongue. Much like Miller High Life, Id say this is a challenger for The Champagne of Beer. ;-D The alcohol really didnt make a flavor appearance, and to be honest it didnt warm me up as much as Id figure 9% to do, so maybe its lower?  Its drinkable depending on how you handle the bubbles. I drank the3 of the 4 pack over the course of 5 or 6 nights. (The most recent on NYE.Champagne of Beers I tells ya!) And one was good enough per time. And even though the alcohol wasnt as present as Id figured, Id still be careful, because maybe after 2 it could creep up quickly. Great beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,skillerified,4.06,"A gorgeous hazy yellow-orange brew sits below a mammoth head that refuses to die. I didn't think I poured it that rough, but the head took up half my over-sized tulip wine glass. The color almost looks like some sort of orange juice/lemon aid concoction gone horribly right. In fact, in a way it looks like a tulip in the tulip glass.  Floral and citrus scents are blended first. Maybe a touch of chocolate. There's a little of a charcoal scent too, like a barbeque grill. The scent is strong and quite pleasing, but it feels a little hollow in the middle parts.  Taste is quite yummy. There's an earthy vegetable flavor followed by caramel and a little banana. Like the scent though, it feels a little hollow.  Mouthfeel is excellent. It's creamy and almost chewy. About the time that the caramel flavor hits it feels like it has the texture of caramel too. It's mostly sweet, but as you keep drinking the bitterness starts to build along the sides of the tongue.  This is an exceptional brew, but I think it lacks a little depth. Especially in comparison to the excellent Trois Pistoles I had the other night. The ABV is sneaky here too. A little too sneaky actually.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,deciding39,4.37,"750 ml brown bottle, 2005 vintage. Served in a snifter.  A: Pours a very attractive hazy gold. A large, one and one-half inch head forms and quickly fizzes away, leaving a small but persistant ring around the side of the glass. Some lacing, but not a whole lot. The carbonation appears very fine, almost Champagne-like.  S: Yeast and very distinctive esters (especially the smell of pears and pineapples) dominate the nose, with some light floral hops pulling through towards the back.  T: Sweet malt, followed by delicious fruity esters and a pleasant, light minty hop bitterness. Dry finish, with warming alcohol, pepper-like spice, and some phenols. Really complex!  M & D: Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Very crisp, pleasant finish. The high alcohol content, although well disguised by the unique and complicated flavors of this beer, limits the drinkability quite a bit.  Exceptional. One of the finest Canadian craftbrews I've had. I recommend drinking it with a fine meal in place of wine. It's that good.  Edit: I recently picked up a bottle and some wild, barnyard-like flavors were present and became quite cloying. It may have just been a bad bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,DarkerTheBetter,4.53,"This beer pours a light cloudy yellow with a touch of pale green. When held to the light, it changes color to a darker copper. the head pours quite tall and consists of thin and even white bubbles. There is a nice stream of bubbles rising from the bottom of the tulip glass that sustain this head. There is no lace as the head just slips down the side of the glass.  Smells of intense pineapple, dry red apple, bitter yeast, a wheat and oat malt and a bit of watermelon.  Tastes of smooth green grapes with a little sour and dry sting. There are also notes of melon, oats, and smooth creamy yeast.  The mouth feel is light bodied with an intense small bubble carbonation.  The flavor of this beer is very prominent, but mellow enough with a light enough carbonation to make this very enjoyable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Great smooth mouth with complimentary high carbonation. Very drinkable for me.  Really good.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,akahn,3.87,"Pours an opaque golden honey color. My crappy pour produced a slight head of big bubbles that receded quickly. No ""Belgian lace"" to be seen.  A spicy, clovey aroma. Bright, sharp flavors, sharp carbonation. Sticky, dry citrus bitter hops. An interesting woodiness or nuttiness from the yeast. Slight alcohol warmth, reminiscent of vodka. The high carbonation makes this have an interesting mouthfeel. Also, this beer is impressively drinkable for a 9% beer.  This is a good beer and I'm going to have to return to it and conduct a more thorough review. The 12 ounce sample wasn't enough to get a feel for this beer. It seems like it deserves its reputation, but I'll need to try some more to be sure.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The beer is a beautiful golden hazy yellow, with a big foaming white head that soon dissipates. The nose is classic, fruity and yeasty. The taste is an amazing blend of citrus, malt, and slight sweetness, with the littlest hint of hops. Incredibly drinkable for a 9.0% ABV.

22,34,wl0307,4.59,"341ml brown bottle. No freshness information on the bottle/label.  A: served lightly chilled in a large tulip-shaped wine glass, it pours a cloudy dark orangey hue (like farmhouse scrumpy cider); the head is limited, leaving just a thin layer of foam, against a lively carbonated body with streams of tiny bubbles all over the place. S: tremendous smell of fruit esters (orange-peel, lightly banana-oil, unidentified exotic fruits/like passion-fruit) with a touch of semi-sharp, freshly-sawn wood-chips and deep spicy flavour, on top of dazzling and richly perfumy fruity and candyish maltiness... The fruity yeasty elements are so vertical and colourful, bringing lots of ever-changing, novel, flowery and savoury aromas unlike all the typical strong pale ales I've encountered. What's best about the aroma is that it's not as overpoweringly/sharply yeasty as many authentic Belgian counterparts (like Duvel), thus making the nose perhaps the most complex I've experienced amongst this style. T: slightly sharp texture initially, with dryish bitter-sweet curacao-peel, coriander seed with lightly peppery edge along with sourly-sweet, perfumy fruitiness following immediately; towards the mid-flavour a rich flow of semi-sweet candy-sugary maltiness develops, leaving semi-dryish hoppyness and a profound yeasty overtone in the aftertaste (like Japanese yeasty drink--Yakult). M&D: lively upfront and turning softer as it goes; the alcoholic warmth is pretty restricted and makes this drink more devilishly-drinkable than the famous Duvel!! although in the end the sticky sweet aftertaste proves a bit too much to my liking. That said, this is THE top dog in my book for the style of Belgian Strong Pale Ale!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ColForbin,4.5,"I'm sampling from a 12oz bottle of Fin Du Monde with a best before date of 09/01/08. Poured into a Maudite glass, it raises a huge fluffy white head with some staying power on top of a cloudy light golden ale. Fine bubbles continue to rise throughout the beer to the end of the glass. Smell is a mixture of hops and spice (predominantly coriander to my nose) with some strong orange peel/citrus flavors as well. Taste is malty, with some lemon zest and coriander and a dry and bitter finish and a slightly sweet aftertaste. Full bodied, but high carbonation lifts it off the tongue and leaves me wanting more.  This is an excellent beer, and one that I sometimes overlook. I really shouldn't. A year or more in the cellar will probably make this beer that much more extraordinary, and I have a couple down there waiting to find out.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jaluria,4.27,"Pours a cloudy yellow color with loads of white foam that sits statuesque and leaves behind intricate lacing patterns. Aromas of candy, alcohol, oranges, and white grapes seem to come out; very complex and enticing. The taste is a brilliant blend of fruit & hop bitterness and sweet candy. The limited carbonation and sour backbone of this beer work very well together. The texture is a bit sticky and mildly astringent; the only flaw I can really pin point with this beer. Despite the high ABV and the assertive flavors in this beer, it is very easy to drink and enjoy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Honey and Bananas moved to the nose quickly by the very active carbonation. Taste is good, very full bodied, the High ABV is slightly apparent but warming. Mouthfeel is decent, a lot of carbonation in this that makes it something meant to be sipped slowly and carefuly. This is a good beer, especially on those cold days where it feels like it is the end of the world. Warms you right up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jslot38,4.17,"335 ML bottle. Best before 09-01-08 clearly marked.  Appearance: Beautiful bottle. Heavy, foil top, with instructions including proper glassware and a warning about the bottom sediment of yeast. Pours a hazy, cloudy yellow with hints of gold. Large head slowly reduces to a half inch bubbly white. Lacing is minimal, and about half way through the beer, head is gone with the rare exception around the side of the glass.  Smell: Even though I can see the remaining yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle you can still smell it in this beer. Faint hints of spices so prominant in wheat beers from Belgium. A lovely mixture of spices indeed.  Taste: Faint notes of yeast and spices first break through. Sweet malts and a bit of hop bitterness take to the palate. Slight notes of dried fruits and coriander. Backbone of citrus rinds, orange peel even, are very noticable and add a great level of complexity to the brew.  Mouthfeel: Maybe perfect. Carbonation with hops upfront, but leaves a smooth take down. I loved the way this felt on the palate. Flavor lingers around your mouth.  Drinkability: Wow, 9% and its not even tastable. Could drink a few of these, but probably wouldn't recommend it if you want to appreciate anything else afterwards.  Notes: A well crafted Belgian brew. Truely is a fine example of North American breweries being able to keep up with the traditions from Belgium.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Jcdolan,4.07,"six pack of bottles Poured into a snifter like glass  First of all I love Unibroue's unique style and choice of advertising and bottles.  With that being said this beer is a very drinkable beer and it will no doubt sneak up on you with its hidden 9% ABV.  This beer poured a nice hazy gold almost rose gold. Medium fizzy head that dissipated and left a ring of creamy white around the edge of the glass.  Smell was not anything crazy or bold. Deffinately a smell of fruits and malt. There is one other sent that hides in the background that I cannot quite identify...  Taste is remarkably unique. A definate taste of fruits and slight slight taste of some unidentified spice. Also that hidden smell can be tasted. Maybe its the spices but there is something that I just can't quite put my finger on.  Sits thickly on the tounge and goes down a nice creamy smoth texture.  This beer reminds me of the time that I went to Montreal. Granted I was a little under the weather and not with it the entire time, I had a great beer called, I think it was called, Boreale. If I recall correctly these beers are very similar and this Unibroue reminded me of the great times I had in Montreal. So in that case I say it is VERY drinkable. This brewery really captures the essence of Canada like a good Canadian brewery should. I would recommend any Unibroue to anyone.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,orfeu,4.85,"750 mL bottle, corked & caged, 2004 vintage. Pours a light golden amber into an oversized wineglass with a fluffy and billowy white head. Lovely citrus and yeasty-bready malt aroma; sweet orange and peach scents abound. Taste is a dry-sweet peach bread with golden raisins; spicy yeast and a strong dry finish. Mouthfeel is full, creamy, and juicy. The 9% alcohol is utterly imperceptible. Absolutely sublime.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bitterdestroyer,3.96,"lemme just tell you that the name says it all. more than a couple of these, and it is la fin du monde (the end of the world for those who don't know). from the second i popped the cork i knew this beer was special...  appearance: poured surprisingly light, not much of a head. lacing was sparse but nice.  smell: typical fruity belgian traits. nothing mind blowing.  taste: now here's where this beer's personality really stands out for me. it's just right. nothing overpowering, especially not the alcohol. hints of fruit, possibly sugar cane?  mouthfeel: crisp and snappy.  drinkability: well i suppose i'm a lightweight. maybe if i had the 6 pack of 12 ouncers it woulda been no problem, but one big bottle of this and i'm down for the count. but as far as flavor, these could be drank all day.  i highly recommend this one. my favorite of all the unibroue's to date.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,SwillBilly,4.32,"12 oz Bottle  Appearance: Pours a light, peachy color with a minimal head that dissipated quickly. Minimal lacing left of the chalice. Visible yeasties are suspended within the beer.  Smell: Plenty of sweet, fruity, malts. Hints of spice, possibly coriander or nutmeg and honey. Really fragrant.  Taste: Begins with a subtle sweetness that is not cloying or too sweet. Fruity, and slightly tart, citrusy hops make an appearance at the finish that leaves the mouth somewhat dry, making me thirst for another sip. Alcohol warms the face as I finish this one.  Mouthfeel: Nice and crisp.with ample carbonation.  Drinkability: Man, I could drink these suckers all night. Super refeshing and crisp. Not overly sweet and hops won't kill the palete. Alcohol is well hidden in the taste profile but you can definitely feel its warmth. A fantastic beer that is well worth anyone's time to seek out and enjoy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

M: Light to medium body, bubbly over the tongue, smooth.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,clabaugh,4.07,"Appearance: Pours a cloudy, pale gold with olive tones. A large, foamy head presents itself. Lacing is adequate, nothing spectacular.  Smell: Floral hops with a palpable spiciness. Sweet malts resembling pastry or flaky biscuit. Some grape scents.  Taste: Sweetness pervades. The maltiness confronts one right away; doughy biscuit with a touch of honey forms a solid backbone of flavor for this beer. It finishes with a mild bitterness, conveying hints of floral nectar.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with carbonation that gives it a zing. A lingering aftertaste with some noticeable numbing.  Drinkability: Very drinkable, considering alcohol content and carbonation. La Fin du Monde remains happily on the tongue after swallow.  Notes: Simply beautiful presentation. Silver foil around the top of a bottle that slopes to resemble a woman's shoulders. Very inviting, and very tasty.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,pbr85,4.15,"Poured this from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass. The bottle suggested a tulip glass. The bottle is very well done and very attractive.  App: Pours a hazy honey color with a one inch white head. The head diminishes slowly and some head remains throughout. There is minimal lacing. Smell: Citrusy grapefruit, maybe some lemon peel, and a hint of alcohol. Taste: Sweet malts are the first thing that hit you. This beer is sweet throughout. Very interesting and nice aftertaste that is dominated by grapefruit rind that is sweet and slightly bitter. Mouthfeel: Carbonated, yet even with this much carbonation it still feels smooth. Aftertaste is silky. Drinkability: The malts hide the alcohol very well considering that it is 9%. I would definetly have another of these, but the sweetness would limit me to probably two in a night.  I would highly recommend this. If you like sweet beers this one is for you.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Derek,4.42,"I've had this many times, but am finally reviewing it. The best description would probably be a Trippel-witbier (which is a complementary hybrid style).  A: Brownish-orange/straw with some murky yeast throughout. Nice off-white head, some retention, hints of lace.  S: Similar to a Witbier, spicy, earthy, a little fruit. Some nice bready Pilsner malt in the nose as well.  T: Bready malt, corriander, earthy flavour from the yeast. Alcohol taste is apparant, but not too assertive. No perceptable hop flavour, but nicely balanced. Finish is dry.  M: Moderate body, highly carbonated.  D: Dangerous at this level of alcohol.  Thanks for the bottle Len!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,phishgator,3.81,"This brew is big on head as it pours into a tulip glass. The yeast clouds the orange hue and swirls through the glass. The aroma is a flower that I just can't place. The taste is a sweet, peppery spiced ale; the alcohol is pronounced as is the yeast and malt. The consistency is smooth and chewy, a true mouthfeel. The drinkability suffers only because for what ever reason the brew dries out my sinuses everytime I dirnk it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,redteg02,4.12,"Appearance: to be quite honest with you it looks like i pissed in the glass. very thick urine yellow with a thick head.  Smell: touch of fruit with a hint of alcohol, still not very impressed  Taste: execptionally smooth, strong fruit flavors but nothing over powering. the fact that really dont like pale ale's tells you how good this must be  Mouthfeel: carbination is perfect. it is high dont get me wrong but it works exceptionally well with this beer",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Dmann,4.85,It's taken me long enough to get around to this one and I'm glad I did! This one poured a nice light golden color with a slight haze and great carbonation bubbles. The head was very thick and frothy and managed to stay around till the last sip. The smell was very fruity and spicy due to the belgian yeast. The taste was outstanding with large pinapple notes and peppery spice mixed with a near perfect carbonation level that made for a great experience. If you are a fan of Belgian beers this one is defiantly worth a try!,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,whynot44,4.18,"Medium bodied, hazy apricot color with a substantial fluffy ivory head,  The aroma is yeasty, spicy with a touch of citrus.  The taste is spicy from the start with cloves, tart lemon, and pepper notes over a mild biscuity malt. The finish is dry and peppery with a definite alcohol warmth.  Very nice! Smooth, almost creamy and very dangerously drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BDTyre,4.42,"My second beer by this brewery, and I am again impressed.  Poured from a corked 750ml bottle. A beautiful pale golden colour with a fluffy, white head that resembles clouds. Smells spicy, with hints of plum and pear. Hints of a heffeweizen or witbier are present.  The taste follows the scent: clove spice that one finds in wheat beers, hints of coriander, but with an apple-pear undertone that softens the bite somewhat. Alcohol is present, but not in-your-face.  Enjoyable to drink, with a body and fizz not unlike champagne. Only detractor in this case is ABV vs bottle size.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,allengarvin,4.82,"Poured into a fluted chalice glass. It is a hazy, turgid amber color with an initially towering head that falls quickly. Spicy, pear-like aroma and sweet yet crisp malt. Beautiful interplay of flavors: smooth, creamy, sweet malt, fruity vanilla, and very light spicy/herbal hop bitterness. There's a hint of alcoholic pepperiness but this is really a deceptively strong beer. Lots of carbonation but the body retains a floating, crisp lightness. This, along with an offsetting tartness, makes it an incredibly refreshing and delightful beer despite the high strength.  One of the great beers of the world, even better than the Duval that inspired it, in my opinion.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,beermanbrian,4.28,This is my first offering from Unibroue and I am looking forward to sampling more of their offerings.  Pours a nice cloudy golden color with a huge foamy white head that sticks around to leave lacing for the full glass. Smell is faintly cirtus grapefruit with malt and yeast backbone with a slight pepper spice smell to fill it out.  As you drink it the malt takes over. The spices don't dominate and the alchohol is amazing well hidden. Supper dry finish but enough creamyness from the high carbonation level.  A really nice beer that i am glad to have sampled. Not one you want to pound due to the high alcohol but I could see how you could down 2 or 3 without realizing it. Also one that you want to savor and enjoy slowly for all the complexity. I would highly recomend this one.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,acrawf6,4.92,"Man, gotta love this beer! This has always been a classic (for me) to fall back on and enjoy whenever i wanted a beer i know that could lift my spirits. Its a shame i am just reviewing it now.  Poured out a hazy yellow, lots of carbonation creating the 2 white bubbly finger head. I loved to watch these bubbles go, the beer had a constant head the whole time drinking it.  Smells of clove and such sweet goodness. Spiced orange/apricot come through and this one smells like a witbier with coriander.  Taste: Freakin fantastic! Sweet spicyness comes right through. Love the spice. alcohol is prsent, but not very considering the 9%. Very creamy.  The mouthfeel is very nice. Lots of carbonation that bites at your toungue. However there is still a big sense of creaminess to the feel.  Unbelievably drinkable. This is one belgium strong that i can have as a session beer. Love it!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,sinistrsam,4.42,"This was poured an immediately developed a HUGE foamy white head, with very small bubbles. The retention was excellent and when it (finally) died down it left excellent lacing around the goblet. The body was unfiltered with sediment suspended, and color chaging from light at the bottom to dark gold at the top. The aroma was of bananas, apple, citrus, cloves and sweet candy and fruits. The taste was excellent, with an complexity as rich as I've tasted. Bananas, citrus, and clove were most present while sweet candy, yeasts, hops and fruits were defintiely there in spades. It was extremely creamy and enjoyable, with mild carbonation. This is truly an excellent beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Vancer,4.32,"Good ol Belgium brews (or styles). I prefer the dark ales, but the lights have their place and time. Of course, the heavenly start  amber/orange with a non-stop foaming white head, lacing. Sweet citrusy malts, grapefruit  reminded me of a hurricane drink loaded with sugar cane rum.  Tart start and sweet finish  although it is a dryer brew than expected, almost Champaign-like in the mouth. Becomes hoppier as it warms.  I will say it needed a tad more malt backbone and fruits in the quaff  which is pretty nitpicking, this is still a quality beverage.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,nlmartin,4.7,Served from the bottle into a pub glass.  Appearance: This beer is a pleasing hazy copper color. The head towered a fluffy white that subsided into thick lacing.  Smell: This beer smells peppery spicy with undertones of sweetness. The alcohol smell plays nicely with the brew.  Taste: This beer has a wonderful peppery goodness supported by a malty sweetness. The alcohol is hidden or plays well with the other flavors in the beer.  Mouthfeel: This is a full boddied beer that is very nicely carbonated. Very clean on the palate.  Drinkability: This is dangerously drinkable. The flavors are very much balanced. I wish I had more.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Alcohol provides a warming note. Very carbonated feel with a bit of alcohol at the finish. an excellent beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,ski271,4.65,"How convenient. I even have a La Fin Du Monde glass to drink this beer from. Its an attractive bottle with its nice-looking front label, informative back label (recommend what glassware to use and warns about the yeast sediment), foiled cap and.... twist off cap? Strange, but whatever, Im not going to knock points of for something like that. Pours a light yellowish-amber with very small particles swirling about but never settling like the sediment I avoiding pouring out of the bottom of the bottle. I guess maybe I jarred the bottle a bit while pulling out of the back of the fridge. The head is very large, white, frothy and stubborn, diminishing very slowly leaving thick lacing just as it sits and slowly fades away. Almost looks like a meringue sitting on top of the beer. The smell is sweet and fruity, with wonderful aromas of Belgian yeast, clove and apple. The taste is marvelous! Clove, pepper and pear with a slightly medicinal twang... but in a good way. Finishes warm with lingering esters. It has a light body, and an effervescent mouthfeel that finishes smooth. This is a fabulous beer thats quite easy-drinking for a 9% brew.

22,34,sloejams,4.83,"The BJCP gives this as an example of a Tripel, but I tend to agree with the BA, Belgian Strong classification. I drink this often, I decided to finally give it a proper review.  It pours a hazy yellow with a beautiful crisp frothy lace head. A sweet aroma suggests fruit perhaps peach. It has a creamy character that is full of carbonation. The 9% ABV is not noticeable in the taste or mouthfeel making it very drinkable. The finish is effervescent and clean. Its very flavorful and downright delicious.  Unibroue makes fine products and this is not exception. As I mentioned above, I have this somewhat regularly and I anticipate many happy returns.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Citadel82,4.15,Yet another tasty Unibroue product. Pours a hazy gold with a generous white head. Aroma is yeasty sweet malts. some spicy cloves and banana.

22,34,pentathlete,4.47,"Cloudy fuzzy peach yellow with a large big-bubbled head. Smell is spicy, touch of ginger, citrus rind and Belgian yeast. Taste is dry, oh so arid, with rind and zest kicking in, the finish is long and hits like allspice, coriander, and some essence of clove. Mouthfeel is full on the top of the palate but dry underneath, very complex and satisfying. Dangerously drinkable at 9% ABV. This is a choice replacement for an aperitif cocktail or a dry wine. Next cocktail party, offer up a taste of this to your guests. They'll thank you.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Aroma is a fruity sensation: apples, pears, banana creme, marshmallows, champagne.  Tastes like an unripe apple as a wine. Mouthfeel is sparkling for a split second, then dry, sweet, sharp, bitter, and yeasty. I taste apple and pear in this one. Aftertaste is dry soap and yeast.  As a hefe I probably wouldve enjoyed this one ten fold - since I'm interested in the flavors presented. It's just too dry for my taste. I see this doesnt go underappreciated, though.

22,34,crwills,4.72,"It's amazing how great a great beer tastes when you drink it right after a lousy beer. In this case, both beers were from the same brewer -- I drank this bottle of Unibroue La Fin Du Monde right after a bottle of Unibroue U2. I guess the biggest positive comment I can make about the U2 is that it made the La Fin Du Monde taste so much better!  I poured the LFDM (acronyms rule) into a standard pint glass. Nice, cloudy golden colour with a 1/2 inch head. Looks like fairly low carbonation. Smell is strawberries, grapefruit, candies, peaches, some grass, and, of course, that patent, unidentifiable (at least to me) Unibrouey smell.  Taste is just great. Fruity, sweet hops, a bit of alcohol, and Unibroueyness. Yes, I'm inventing words left and right. Mouthfeel is cutting, with just the right amount of carbonation for me (i.e. not that much), and very little aftertaste.  For 9% ABV, this is a very drinkable beer. The type I could go through two or three of and then fall down.  Anyway, my theory is Unibroue released its one or two lousy beers solely to make its mostly awesome beers taste better. Smart, eh?",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Melchizedek,4.07,"Pours a champagne-like gold, with a slight yeast haze, a rocky white head and lively, lasting carbonation.  Smell is potent, with some clove and yeast action and a light Red Delicious apple-like background scent. Floral notes in the smell as well. In the mouth, rather effervescent and foamy, with noticeable alcohol and a hard-to-identify honey/fruit sweetness.  This is very, very drinkable--dangerously so, with its 9% ABV. There's a pleasing sharpness to the flavor and mouthfeel that comes out better at a temp a bit lower than what might be recommended; when you try it, pour at fridge temp or just above and let it warm, and I think you'll enjoy it immensely.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,andjusticeforale,4.5,"The end of the world. I poured this beer into a unibroue tulip I have enjoyed this beer in the past but never considered a review until now.  The first impression of this beer in a glass is that of a cross between a run-o-the-mill american pilsener and champagne. It froths like crazy and truly looks refreshing. But there is no cheap macro-swill here, this is high end stuff.  The initial smell is spicy, yeasty, somewhat belgian white, even more malt base to form the strong pale ale frame. The taste is predominantly vanilla, coriander malts and a bitterness to add balance from the hops. This is crucial because it balances the sweetness that would otherwise be over-present. One other thing that balances the sweetness is the alcohol content. At times it is present, and at other times it is not so up front. The finish is wonderfully spiced, dry herbal spiced, (coriander, some citrus oil not nutmeg and cinnamon) and vanilla. With a warming effect.  This is really nice in what it is trying to accomplish, its up there with Duvel, etc.; and is certainly less sweet than some of the Belgians. If beginners into craft beer could get by the high alcohol, this certainly is a beverage that could tease and convert the casual drinker to explore craft and Belgian beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Bright yellow/golden with a ghost of yeast throughout from the bottle fermentation. This beer looks terrific. A solid, but a bit thin, white head with decent retention and substantial lacing on the goblet.  S: Okay, things are getting better by the millisecond. This smells otherworldly ... citrusy, spicy, with strong yeasty notes and zest ... almost like a wit in some respects. More ""alive"" than expected.  T: First the appearance, then the scent, now the taste ... I cannot expalin my excitement here. This tripel from Canada (who'd have thunk it) is world class. I'd put it against MOST comparable styles from the homeland. It's that good ... with strong, warming alcohol upfront, sweet malts and yeast throughout, but offset with complex orangy characteristics. A distinct peppery, spiciness is pronounced ... almost like they added cloves to the secondary ... still holds slightly to the sweeter side on the finish.  M: Rich and substantial. You can detect the yeast strain throughout the liquid. Good, strong alcohol burn at 9%. Silky, and manages a smoothness despite the high gravity being so pronounced.  D: Wish I had another 750ml of this right now, though I likely wouldn't be in a condition conducive to writing this review if I had it.

22,34,Hop2it,5,"Oh sweet mercy, this looks delicious. Perfect bright solid white head of tight foamy bubbles. Semi opaque yellow/orange body. Tiny carbonation bubbles vigarously racing to the top, with no signs of stopping.  Smells tart and estery like a Wit. Orange rind bouquet of citrus aromas.  This is wonderful - completely wraps my tongue around in a soft velvety balanket of hoppy goodness. Carbonation dances, alcohol heats things up, solid malt profile gives just the right amount of body, but it's the hops that take this baby over the edge with perfect bitterness.  I forgot to mention the yeast. It adds so much to the flavor and smell. Estery, spicy, sweet and bitter. There is just so much going on it's hard to divide my attention to the complexity of this.  I generally have reservations about giving a beer all 5s - but not tonight. This is really that good. The second pour of the 750ml bottle is slightly warmer, allowing the flavor to expand and enunciate the delicate intricacies of its flavor.

22,34,sacfly,4.09,"Pours a cloudy, straw/gold color. Huge thick white head. Musty and light bubblegum sweetness in the nose. Sharp when cold, but blends well when it warms.  Taste mimics the nose with bubble gum and musty clove phenols first, and a long musty aftertaste. Nice full mouth feel.  Drink this one at room temperature or slightly chilled. Flavors are very sharp and harsh when cold, round out rather nicely as it warms. Score reflects drinking at room temp/chilled.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jayc333,4.52,"Pours a murky yellow with a 1-finger white head. This one is cloudy as hell.  A variety of spices in the smell. All of which co-exist with eachother wonderfully.  Spices hit upfront in taste. Sweet malts balance everything out, and the 9%ABV gives a nice warming hue.  Amazingly smooth mouthfeel for its ABV. Very creamy, with medium carbonation.  Truly a world class brew. In the Belgian Strong Pale Ale category, I say this bad boy makes Duvel seem like nothing. Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,tesguino,4.42,"Settled and deep yellow beer; triple fermentation; grassy and floral smell; taste wide, strong, well ballanced; full, bodied, high ABV (9%), a great abbey example; try with most of mexican and american cuisine, chinese too; use for cooking is great for marinade; serve in a goblet fo course; use like appetizer; 93% recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,UberWasser,4.95,"12oz brown bottle, no freshness date, served in an oversized wine glass.  Pours a dark yellow/light amber. Very cloudy. Cannot see my hand through it. Even with a gentle pour a three or four finger head develops in the glass. The retention is quite nice, as it doesnt recede at all with some agitation. Pretty color, lack of clarity for all the right reasons, great head. It leaves lots of nice lacing on the glass. Nice.  The smell...all I can say is wow. Its like smelling a mellowed flower bed/spice garden in a glass. Totally intriguing with notes of lavender, cloves, roses, orange citrus, and more. Absolutely stunning.  The taste is just as stunning. Starts a little spicy on the tongue, like an alcohol-infused citrus. As it moves to the back of your mouth more of the clove richness comes through. After swallowing it, a floral effervescence floats up into the back of your mouth and back of your nose, highlighting the great rose and lavender notes. Its amazing. Mouthfeel is smooth as silk, with just a touch of carbonation sizzle.  A nearly perfect beer. So complex, so intriguing, but also so drinkable. It's smooth as silk (even at 9% ABV you'd have to struggle to detect it) and fun to sip. I'll definitely be stocking up on this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Appearance- Cloudy bright golden pour. Cork lets out with a furious pop. Nice creamy 3/4 inch head with nice patchy lacing.  Smell- Spices and more spices. Tons of white pepper and corriander. Not much other scents can get through. Maybe a few ripe fruits.  Taste- The pepper and the corriander carry this beer. Maybe a touch of peach flavor sneaks through or some other kind of tropical fruit. Sweet and tangy.  Mouthfeel- Perfect carbonation for style. Sugary coating and a tad creamy.  Drinkability- Probably the best Strong BPA I have had. Extremely tasty and drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Goldne tan wheat color with large frothy head that dissipates quicly to a creamy film that mounds where towers of bubbles are racing to the surface, Funky grainy smell with some sweet spiciness.  I'm afreaid that perhaps the complexity of this brew was lost on my tongue? It is very good, but it seemed very ""normal"" belfian style sweeteness with some sweet graininess. Again, it was good, but nothng out of the ordinary here. Refreshingly active carbonation with moderately ligh body.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,fromage,4.05,"A great brew--why have I been wasting my money on costly belgians?! An erruptive pour, exploding into an enormous, frothy head that lasted for the whole amber glass. Volcanic activity below the surface, a tornado of bubbles eventually subsiding into a weak effervescence. Strong spicy smell, ethanol in the pour but didn't last. Citrus, corriander, cloves. Soapy attack, spice fading in the back of the throat, giving way to grapes, sour raspberries. Dry aftertaste, slightly tacky, leaving traces of the spice. Medium mouthfeel, slightly weak. Excellent drinkability--easily camoflagues the 9% abv.  1/2 as much as other Belgians. That's enough for my endorsement.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Nice. Aromas of citrus and floral notes fill the nose. Some hints of malt and yeast are present. Very nice. Taste is not as present as the aroma, but still very quaffable. Flavors of malt, spice, clove and yeast blend together in very heavenly harmony. Complexity is abound in this beer. Mouthfeel is full and savory. Not too heavy as to hinder the experience of this beer, yet not too light as to make it airey. A solid level of drinkability. A 4-pack of this would have a shorter life in my fridge than a snowball in hell. Highly Recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The beer pours hazy lazy yellow/orange with a fluffly head. The nose is pure yeast and fruit, almost Saison-like in temperment. The taste is big and restrained; citrus notes to the back and hops mixed with yeast to the front. What makes this beer a fave of mine is the balance and drinkability. A truly great beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Quite fruity smell. Yeasty as well. Pleasant malt aroma. Citrusy. Not a whole lot of hop aroma. Estery with a slighteset touch of alcohol detectable.  Nice complex taste. Yeast is a strong flavor followed by a sweet fruitiness. Not much hop character. Alcohol is amazingly subdued. Really would be unable to tell this is a 9%. Great body.  Refreshing mouthfeel. Carbonation makes for a light beverage and nice mouthfell. Three or four of these and Im gone. A refreshing and pleasant winter warmer.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Aroma -- Floral and light perfume. Tangerine/pear. Spice. Slightest bit of skunk.  Taste -- Delicate fruit flavor of tangerine and apricot. Flash of tangy sour citrus. Powdery yeast. Pepper/spice. Light bitter bite in finish. Alcohol not too evident in flavor.  Mouthfeel -- Soft mouthfeel. Dry. Lots of good carbonation. Very champagne-like.  Drinkability -- Nice beer. Good drinkability.

22,34,xoqx,4.38,Appearance  Sparkling yellow cloudy and extremely lively. A thick white head sticks around for a while and is easily replenished by the outrageous carbonation in this Belgian. Very thick swoopy lacing clings to the glass.  Smell  Yeasty with many complex esters conveying lemon citrus and fruits.  Taste  Superb. This has a complex taste that is hard for me to unpack. I feel the malts and the hops are very concealed behind the many layers of taste provided by the yeasty esters.  Mouthfeel  Crisp yet bold and punchy; super carbonated.  Drinkability  Superb drinkability for any style. Deceptively drinkable for a ~9% abv beer.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,veggiemafia,4.15,"I can't really say anything about this beer that hasn't already been said. Amazing beer, will buy it again, will buy 6 and let 3 age until this time 2006, and 3 age until this time 2007.  Big fluffy head, but almost too much.  Once this beer warmed to around 45º, the alcohol became more apparent in the finish and detracted a little from the beer. VERY warming alcohol sensation, save this one for a cool evening like this evening in Pittsburgh where I'm writing my review. At the same time really refreshing, though.  The only reason I give it a 3.5 for drinkability is because I cannot session a beer that's 9.0% abv without getting completely wasted after three. Also, I think the alcohol detracts a little from the drinkability, but hopefully letting it hang out for about a year will help.  In the mean time, I will definitely still buy and enjoy this while I'm waiting on bottles to age.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

This one is so subtle while packing so much flavor and complexity. Nothing beats you over the head. Just this marvelous amalgamation of flavors from the various ingredients. Classic Belgian yeast flavor. Light hopping. Some spices. A bit of tartness. Something almost citrusy. 9% is there, but not particularly noticeable. Head is tremendous and persistent. Lots of lace.  Just a tad too much carbonation, which detracts from the moutfeel. But not too bad.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Beautiful citrus aroma full of fruity and spicy notes. The taste is wonderful. Fruits seem so well balanced with hops. Slightly sweet, slightly dry finish. Light to medium body. Very rich. Alcohol is well hidden and only apparent through warmth of this beer.  The time between sips keeps decreasing. I am growing impatient as my body and mind crave for this beer's wonderful flavor. Is it possible that the name refers to how you feel when you realize that you just finished your last bottle?

The aroma was nicely citrusy and fruity with a spicy presence. The fruity aromas were strong and plentiful and as the beer warmed a nice pepper spice character developed.  The flavor was nicely achieved with a sweet malty presence and a roundness of wheat coupled with a light peppery spice and a light bittering and citrus. The fruity flavors were pleasant and very well done. Also present was a nice earthy character.  The finish was even and almost dry with a light spice and a nice fruity character long into the afteraste. The body was medium and a the mouthfeel was nice with the higher carbonation level.

Some spicy smelling malt aromas as well.  T - A nice dry flavor that's very crisp with some spiciness to it. Some fruitiness in there too, perhaps berries or tart grapes and a tiny bit of hops. I am quite the hophead at times but in this brew I don't miss a big hop punch as the tiny hints of hops contribute o the sweet and spicy flavors rather nicely.  M - Very pleasant, some nice carbonation and very slight alcohol warming at the end.  D - For a higher alcohol beer this is as drinkable as I've ever tasted. A nice medium bodied beer that goes down smooth and tastes great.   Notes: One of my favorites for a long time, I finally got around to reviewing it. Those Unibroue characters really know what they're doing.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Highly recommended and I will definitely have again. Of the few I've had, this is Unibroue's best.  Reviewed again 5/20/06 Poured from a 750ml into a Leffe goblet. I've had this beer several times and it has always been a favorite.  Poured a golden/orange color. Opaque. Lots of small bubbles and good lacing. A large white head with large bubbles. Quite nice to look at.  Aroma is spicy and slightly citrus.  Taste is of sweet malts and some light citrus. Spiciness also comes through. Lightly dry at the end. Alcohol content was quite evident, much more so than I recall in my previous bottles.  Mouthfeel was medium bodied and quite cleansing. Smooth. Overall, this beer is still quite impressive though it was slightly less so than when I had it previously. I found the alcohol presence quite strong and this made it less drinkable. Of course, still a beer that I will have again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Theres a sweet aromatic malt with a wonderfully fruity edge; passionfruit, apple, raspberries come to mind. Hops are floral and minimal.  The taste is packed with berries, rock candy and spices with a stiff alcohol warmth. Hop flavor and bitterness is very low. There is a surprising dryness however thats a characteristic of Unibroue house yeast. The finish is long and sweet, though not too sweet. The mouthfeel is incredibly thick and creamy with carbonation. You gotta love Botttle Conditioned Belgians.  This is a fantastic beer.

22,34,EMV,4.82,"Simply put, one of the best beers I've ever enjoyed. This one stands out even amongst the Unibroue herd, and is really a delightful beer. It pours a gorgeously unfiltered/hazy dark golden color with a head that won't quit. The aroma is complex to say the least, with yeast, hops, and a fruity sweetness all detectable to one extent or another.  The taste is excellent, with an initial fruity sweetness and a crisp aftertaste. It's a very complex taste, that challenges your palate without being confusing. This beer's a sipper at 9% alcohol content, but the flavours do a great job of masking just how quickly this one could put you on your backside. The mouthfeel itself is also excellent, with just the right amount of carbonation.

Taste starts with sweet malt which turns into a very nice fruit flavor which is difficult to place. Perhaps very sweet oranges. There is also some good spicy hop flavor to balance it out in the finish. Very balanced and tastey brew. This has a very nice medium full mouthfeel with some significant carbonation that suits this beer very well. This is 9% ABV but it's hard to tell from the taste- very well hidden. I have no doubt that it is in fact present however- this stuff hits hard. Dangerous and wonderful. ""End of the World"" indeed.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mrasskicktastic,2.8,"A - Poured a cloudy orange/amber with a monsterous frothy white head that lingered for a long time. Intense carbonation visible. No lacing, too bad.  S - Very weak odor. Mostly carbonation. Some flowery notes and a little banana and pear esters. No alcohol scent. Too bad the carbonation smell dominates and the undertones are so subtle.  T - At first, I thought the beer possessed a very potent metallic flavor, but after a little progress, I could barely taste it. It is a sweet beer, a slight citrus against a wheaty malt taste. Alcohol is completely hidden. None of the flavors are that amazing, and the metal just tainted my view.  M - Thin, the carbonation is a little harsh, a bit drying. Unibroue's other works I've tasted were absurdly refreshing. This one is anomalous for them. Sure the abv is absent in the taste, but its astringent nature is dessicating my poor mouth.  D - Not very good. I think I'll steer clear of La Fin du Monde in the future. It wasn't a terrible beer, but for the price and the brewery, I expected more. Its strong point is that the 9% abv is obfuscated, probably under the powerful carbonation.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

In a way it kinda reminded me of sam adams summer ale. (PLease don't yell at me if that is an inappropriate comparison) Although I could not see what it looked like, (in fact I was unable to see light through it at all) I imagine it was darker than almost anything I've ever had. the smell was absolutly wonderfull and I imagine if I built up a tolerance I could drink a few at one sitting...not a session, that would be a shame (and expensive).

Good amount of carbonation but still seemed kind of flat, I guess the lack of any head may account for some of that, Alcohol noticeable on the finish but other than that, it's disguised very well. not bad, not as good as I expected.

Taste is quite good, a yeasty pale ale with lots of banana overtones, tropical fruit, and a bit of a bite on the back end. Not as aggressively spicy as a lot of brews in this vein, but quite good nonetheless.  Mouthfeel is crisp with zinging carbonation and medium-bodied.

The orange juice aroma is slightly off-putting. The taste is virtually the same but with coriander and a mild bitterness. It is very malty with a lot of sweetness and a thick body with medium carbonation. It's good, but I remember it being even better than this.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ALESwhatCURESya,4.27,"Appearance: A full charged straw yellow, honey-colored body. Rapid carbonation leads to an airy head that is tough to beat. The hazy body hosts the yeast cells drifting around the bottom.  Smell: This aroma is phenomenal. It is filled, I mean filled, with citrus and spice. Fresh black pepper and clove is followed by the freshness of lemon. A belgian yeast aroma is clearly present.  Taste and mouthfeel: The carbonation feels like little pin pricks hitting the tongue. A sweet, light malt is extremely smooth. The alcohol gently warms your body as it travels down your throat. This is like a belgian wit on steroids.  Drinkability: ""The end of the world"" packs a serious punch of flavors, aroma, and brain kick. Remarkably good, but you may end up at La Fin du Monde if you go to nuts with this one. This is such and awesome beer!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BuckeyeNation,4.05,"""It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine""  --R.E.M.   Yeast-laden, effervescent, brilliant gold with an expansive, billowy cap of rich, aged ivory. Plenty of BSPAs have this basic appearance, but something about this one strikes me as near perfect as I let bright morning sunlight stream through the window and catch fire in the glass. The head is in too much of a hurry to depart and almost no lace is visible, so I'm forced to curb my enthusiasm a bit.  Definitely a good nose for the style, but I'm not gobsmacked. There's a smidgen less power than anticipated and less complexity as a result. I can appreciate spicy pear and apple fruit with intimations of clove spice. It's hard to say if an actual Belgian yeast strain is in use. If so, it's one of the tamer varieties. The aroma opens up a bit more with warming and becomes more white peppery as well.  Most of the usual style elements are present: orchard fruit, spice and well-integrated alcohol. The beer is sweeter than some with a more subdued spiciness. The word elegant comes to mind. La Fin Du Monde is unquestionably a civilized, mannered version of the style. The thing is, I tend to prefer rabble rousers. I enjoy the flavor, but I find myself wishing that there was more of it and that it would hang around a while longer.  Adding the yeast from the bottom of the bottle helps a little, but not enough. This is good beer that could be great beer with a tweak or two. The finish is tackysweet and is the capper to a wonderfully lush mouthfeel that is the highlight of this entire experience for me.  La Fin Du Monde is a wonderful effort and is an admirable example of its style. However, it lacks a certain 'je ne sais quoi' and therefore doesn't quite equal the best BSPAs. That said, I'm savoring the final few ounces and I'm definitely feeling fine.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,waughbrew,4.2,"Hazy straw, white fizzy head with decent stay-time. Complex aroma of peppery spiciness, peach,mango, and banana fruitiness, flower petals, and sweet grains. Flavor starts very sweet and orangy with aforementioned pepper and high carbonation spritz. Ends in a nice balance as the acidity and sweetness fade away. Phenolics seem a bit minerally in a pleasant way. Alcohol is rather hidden in the flavor but not the effect. Pleasant fuzziness sets in quickly with this brew. Very well-rounded, but strong flavors and solid spiciness. Well-made and complex.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,KarlHungus,4.8,"Pours a solid, cloud, pale orange color. The head is enormous, bright white and fluffy, and lasts for the whole glass. The aroma is of citrus fruits with floral and herbal notes. This beer smells fantastic. The taste is citrusy and tangy with some alcohol in the background. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied. Overall, this is a great brew, and very enjoyable. I would recommend this to anyone who wants something big and refreshing on a hot summer day.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,carln26,4.03,"This beer poured a deep gold color, mildly hazy with a thick egg-white colored head. The head continues to refresh itself via a thin stream of champagne bubbles from the bottom of the glass. The nose has a mild bread-dough aroma up front followed by citrus/orange and grapefruit rind, some coriander spice, finished by a mild caramel malt. The taste has more of the citrus up front backed by the spice, finished nicely by the malt in the form of toffee. This beer has a wonderful carbonation, a light and bright mouth feel, and a high drinakbility. A great NA Belgian style ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,NoLiberty,4.47,"Aside from the fact that this beer has a tendency to sneak up on you, it's an incredibly consistent, delicious beer. Unibroue, one of Canada's finest breweries, always produces this well-balanced beer in the same manner and well suited for aging.  La Fin Du Monde was one of the first craft brews I ever purchased. I bought my first 25 oz. bottle in Canada well below US legal drinking age and stored it in my closet at home for close to 6 years. I had no idea how to properly age a beer and when I did I'd decided to continue ""aging"" the beer for some quasi-scientific curiosity.  I drank the beer with the current brewer at Shed Brewery and surprisingly it wasn't putrid. The alcohol had continued to develop for at least 3 of those years, because it nearly burned our eyes. But the yeast characteristics and maltiness maintained. I wouldn't recommend aging to the length that I performed, but La Fin du Monde has a life of it's own, a fighting will to survive and to be the better beer. Enjoy and appreciate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,cubedbee,4.77,"Served in it's glass, a pale hazy yellow with 2 fingers of frothy white head and a small amount of lacing. Smell is spicy apple skins, tangerine, bubblegum, bananas, grass, wonderfully complex. Taste is like smooth rich banana pudding, with some oranges, apples, spices, and cloves all thrown in the mix. Superb. Velvety mouthfeel throughout, and alcohol that is absolutely hidden from sight, this is a dangerously tempting beer. One of the best Belgians I have ever tasted from right here in North America.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,cracgor,4.32,"Appearance: Golden to straw colored and cloudy. Heavily carbonated. Tall cake like white head, that remains thick throughout the drink.  Smell: yeasty. Smells a little like lcove. Furity. Very tasty smelling.  Taste: Sweet alcohol flavor. Tastes of clove, apple and grpaes. Spicy and sweet.  Mouthfeel: medium body. Alcoholic warming. Heavily carbonated.  Drinkability. Very tasty. It meets my expectations from this beer, but doesn't really exceed them very much...But that won't keep this beer from me.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TPSReports,4.33,"A delicious Pale Ale! Our Canadian friends have made another successful Belgian-taste-alike with this one.  The 11.2 oz beer pour richly into the chalice -- a blonde straw color. A tiny bubbled white head form and last for quite a while. A relaxing citrus aroma accompanies the head.  The taste is right on -- not to spicy or sweet or fruity. Right down the middle, Tripel, but it's not. A very rick brew for a Pale Ale. This one is a keeper.  I will keep several of these on hand for guests.  Cheers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BEERchitect,3.95,"La Fin Du Monde is a solid Tripel with a sweeter, wheaty demeanor and weizen-like yeastiness.  Murky golden in color, the beer carries a froathy rocky white head at first, but struggles for retention as it reduces to hardly a trace only a few moments in.  Wheaty and spicy, the aromas display the appricot, pear, and nearly banana and clove character that rivals hefeweizens.  Flavors follow suit with a sweeter candied fruit taste of ripe, or over ripe, appricots, bananas, and pear. Spicy with alcohol, white pepper, corriander, and a dash of orange peel. Light notes of coconut or vanilla seems to richen the flavor and detract from the zesty taste of classic Belgian tripels. Lacking any meaningful hop character further exacerbates the sweet and fatter mid palate. Pleasant earthy notes rise as the beer warms, giving a honey-like taste in finish.  Heightened sweetness and body makes the beer less digestable and drinkable than it should be. Sweetness and malt textures linger in the finish and never allows for the snappy dry finish that tripels deserve. Alcohols warm the mouth and accent the peppery character of yeast and help with balance late.  Though this is a nice tripel ale, I don't give it the praise that others share. It doesn't have the malty-dry, cracker-like character and well attenuated sweetness of Chimay Cinq Cents (white label), nor with it's floral, spicy, earthy hop presence. This beer just tastes muted, sweet, and over fruity in comparison.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,neonbrown82,4.35,"Thanks to fellow BA Chatter for this brew, acquired in my first trade attempt. This is a very solid brew. A belgian beer from canuck land, eh? Tastes better than any other American attempt at belgians to me, and I've had my fair share.  Pours to a cloudy golden tripel color with a massive fluffy head. The lacing is quite burly and leaves strata of different thicknesses along the back edge of the glass. The little bubbles couldn't possibly be more uniformly perfect.  The smell reminds me of a Chimay Cinq Cents, or something similar. Very sweet and malty with some spicy, yeasty clove notes to it. Good, but quite standard for a belgian style ale.  The taste is quite exceptional, though. I would go so far as to guess that it has a lot to do with water quality. There is no metallic taste to the foam, which is actually almost more tasty than the beer itself. There is an ever so slight banana ester to the taste, along with a bit of clove. The mouthfeel is very smooth, not too dry, and not too alcoholic for such a high ABV brew. Very creamy and highly drinkable for such a heavy beer. Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,KoG,4.27,"Marked best before 5/20/07, cellared by me almost a year.  Hazy yellow with a short lived head and really no lacing at all. Huh?  Smell is spicy with some phenol alcohol and a slight apple rind fruityness. Light and fulfilling.  Taste is spicy alcohol with some apple and citrus. Reminiscient of Duvel with a lot more alcohol presence. Detracts from the mouthfeel a bit due to the burn.  Very drinkable, although I have no idea why I didn't get a nice frothy head. Alcohol will get even more dominate when it warms.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JackStraw22,4.75,"Appearance: Cloudy, pale golden body. Huge mound of white head and tons of bubbles feeding the head. A little bit of lacing to boot.  Smell: Huge earthy spices in the aroma with a faint sweetness in the backround. A little bit grassy with corriander and orange.  Taste/mouthfeel: Tastes just like it smells, yeasty and herbal. Really wonderful flavors here. Orange and spicy hops, just wonderful. Great mouthfeel too. A lot of Belgian pale ales seem too dry too me. This one is perfect. A little dry, yes, but doesn't leave you feeling thirsty.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,IceAce,4.75,Presentation: 750 ml bottle with a cork labeled 4-5 and a 2004 cage and a 'Best Before' date of 10-19-07 on the back label.  Body is a murky yellow with a golden core. Two full fingers of dense stark-white foam are supported by a seemingly neverending supply of CO² streamers coming from nucleation points along the bottom of the glass.  The nose is pure Belgian Tripel with sweet barnyard dominance alongside a citrus-like sweetness.  There are barely enough o's in smoooth to describe entry. Midtaste is well supported by the ample carbonation before giving way to a yeastiness which one would normally associate with Royalty. Deep malty goodness begins to rise toward the rear of the palate while the well hidden ABV begins to send a glow throughout.  The finish begins with additional tasty yeast and another exhibit of the velvety mouthfeel while the fade leads one to a wonderful dryness which begs of another sip.  Superb!,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,scooter231,4.33,"This is my first beer review here, so please treat me gently. This is one of my favorite beers I've come across so far in my young beer studying life. The appearance is a cloudy golden color, with a lot of frothy white head when you first pour that soon disappears to a mere coating on top.  It smells almost cidery, definitely bubbly, lots of fruityness. Tastes better than it smells- sweet, but dry. The alcohol content doesn't overwhelm the flavors at all. Kind of champagne-esque, and definitely tasty.  Great mouthfeel, sticks around for a bit after you swallow, but no bad aftertaste or anything of that ilk. I could, and have, drank more than one of these at a time on occasion. You know it has more alcohol than your average beer, but it's sneakily hidden. A lovely beer on the whole- definitely worth checking out, as are most Unibroue beers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BamaScholar,4.87,"no cataclysm when I opened the brown bottle, but beer poured a straw / topaz yellow and is very aromatic...to me it is like combining a sparkly white wine like a riesling or pinot gris and giving it the citrus tones of witbier or even your basic blue moon.  the taste is very nice...you expect over the top strength but really any initial hoppiness is mellowed out with a nice, pepper spice and wild fruit.  mouthfeel remains light and the carbonation and cling are doing well here at the bottom of the glass.  superb. absolute nectar.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Gavage,4.67,"I drink this brew all the time and never got around to reviewing it. Pours a slightly cloudy yellowish-orange color with a thick frothy 2 inch head. The aroma contains tones of yeast, citrus, floral hops, and spice. The flavor components make up a perfect combination for the tastebuds - orange, lemon zest, yeast, coriander, and vanilla, balanced with perfect levels of malt, a nice complimenting bitterness, and mild alcohol.  Mouthfeel is very crisp on the tongue. Medium bodied beer. The finish is dry and the flavor components ride the tongue long after swallowing. It is extremely drinkable and one of my favorite brews.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,custardcb,4.65,"Like many others it was the artwork on Unibroue that first attracted me to them. I thought to myself if it looks this good it must taste at least half-way decent. I was more then surprised by the contents of the bottle.  The hazy straw color with frothy head that slowly disperses is quiet nice. The aroma is soothing and full of complex notes that sometimes remind me of lemon, yeast, and other highly aromatic herbs that lean towards the floral end. It is most deffinately an ale that lingers in your mouth while it dances about your palate with is spiciness. A true treasure in a bottle.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,HappyHourHero,4.7,"Aroma reminds me of a witbier; strong zesty lemon, some fresh floral notes, and possibly some coriander. Big, foamy, pale cream colored head leaves strings of lace as it pops its way to a dense foamy coating. Mildly sweet with a bit of orangey coriander up front. It's citrusy throughout and only slightly bitter towards the end. There's a yeasty vanilla flavor that fades in as the beer warms, and some other spices I can't point my finger on. Body is moderately light and the mouthfeel is soft and smooth. Imperial Trappist Witbier? Who cares what it is, it's frickin great!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BeerFink,4.28,"Decanted into a tulip, this ale appears cloudy and orange-straw colored. Sticky white head sits atop. Yeasty bready aromas come to the fore, followed slight fruit and some spices. Lots of malt is apparent in the flavor, but the otherwise big mouthfeel is sharpened by crisp carbonation. Biscuity and bready, the large malt bill leads you into spicy hops with herbal notes. Finish is a little acidic and dry, but you are left with creamy malts and bananas lingering about your mouth. As far as I know, Unibroue can do no wrong. Cheers to the boys up north!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bnuttz,4.6,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. Pours a cloudy light peachish yellow color. Nicely fizzy head that allows the beautiful aroma of this beer to escape. Smells of yeasties, bananas, cloves, basically like a belgian hefeweizen. Flavors on this one are spicey and phenolic. Once again, like a belgian hefeweizen, but not like a witbier. A very nice belgian pale ale, one of my favorites. Holy balls is this drinkable. What does 9% abv mean again? Yeah, just awesome.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,paterlodie,4.45,"Cheers on Canada! Woww what a beer! Great and everlasting head that gets bigger bubbels but was there the whole time I had this wonderfull orange/golden brew in my glas. Nose is very fruity: hops, yeastfruit an probably litle koreander are present, munich and other malts as well as is yeastspice and alcohol. Taste is great also being strong but easy drinkable cause of perfect balance of taste. Malty, fresh, alcoholic, spicy( pepper) and good fitting bitterness make this into a great brew. Good carbonisation makes mouthfeel also perfect. Drinkability is great but maybe too easy for a brew of this strength.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,RedLion,4.08,"Very good, Belgium style beer. Off white head with good lacing. Smell is clovey, and that same clove smell is found in the glass along with an orangey taste.

Too many other beers out there.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,sinistermadman,4.37,"Served via apocalyptic 12 oz bottle. This brew pours a bright amber with a terrific head which subsides quietly, leaving barely any lacing. Smells of spice, citrus, subtle solvent nose and of course the omnipotent alcohol.  Taste: Delicious. Smooth and sweet on the front end, quickly morphing into a spicy pepper character towards the end. This is one to sip on and savor. Strikes a perfect balance between the alcohol content and drinkability factor. The carbonation seems to sneak in the warming alcohol. Mouthfeel is very pleasant. Like I said, this brew is sneaky so watch it. With all that said this is definitely a brew to end the night with. Well worth a try. Cheers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Litterbean,4.38,"Golden in color, it is like honey in my wine glass. Fluffy white head settles down after a bit and leaves a thin layer atop the liquid. Tiny bubbles float upwards through this clear golden brew.  Sweet fruity smell, with a hint of flowers and a clear yeast smell to it. Hints of raspberries and potpourri.  Well balanced, tart and sweet. Hints of spices and faint citrus. Mild hops at the end. Smooth mouthfeel with a bit of chewiness at the end from the hops. The alcohol is very well hidden. This is a great beer, and dangerously drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,santoslhalper,3.95,"This one's been sitting for roughly a year.  Appearence: Pours a lively gold with a thin, creamy off-white head.  Smell: The smell is a well rounded mix of sweet malts and candi sugar with a balancing hop presence.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Very strong alcohol on the mouth immeadiatly, and the beer follows that trend even after it's left your mouth. The sweetness is wonderful, and does it's part rounding off the alcohol. The mouthfeel is fizzy and a bit thin.  Drinkability and Overall: Even with a year on it, the alcohol presence is a bit too strong. I was hoping it would have mellowed some more. But still, go Unibroue.

22,34,ncbrewerbun,4.77,"I great birthday present! Someone brought a 750ml bottle to our homebrew club meeting and another member gave me two of the small bottles for my b-day. There were no significant differences noted with the big vs. small bottles.  A pale, slightly hazy straw color with a nice and long-lasting head. Bubbles keep rising to the surface, suggesting almost an effervescence.  A myriad of goings-on in the aroma -- malt, spices (notably, pepper), and yeast characteristics -- which all translates beautifally into the taste profile. A wonderful complexity.  This a a beer to share and experience with others. Others who appreciate great beer, that is. This is deceptive...light and easy to drink...belying it's strength.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Shultzerdugen,4.42,"75 cl brown bottle with cork and cage.  Poured clouded straw with a large froth that went down quickly.  Tart green apple peels, light peach and apricot in the smell. A spiciness and solvent character from the alcohol.  Light and well carbonated on the palate. Fruity esters, sweet malts, and a peppery finish from the booze all in a nice blend. Bittering hops are there to make the next drink just as good as the first. Chalky yeast leaves a dry finish.  Compares favorably to top runners of the style, nothing wrong with this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,Hunter,3.72,"Second time sampling this, first time reviewing for BA...  Appearance: Beer pours very fizzy, light red/gold color with a frothy head of loose white bubbles that dissipates much too quickly. Carbonation is substantial, some soapy lacing but not too much.  Aroma: Notes of apple juice, champagne, alcohol and candi sugar in the nose. It smells...fizzy. Does that make any sense?  Taste: The fizziness continues in the palate, again lending a sparkling wine character to the brew. Light malt and citrusy spices play on the tongue. Alcohol plays a small supporting role but you never get the sense you're drinking something that's 9% ABV. Carbonation scours any chance of an aftertatste here. Light and bubbly mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Hard to say. Sure, it's a nice light brew, and I can see pairing it with seafood or vegetarian dishes or enjoying a quiet spring evening with a glass. But at $7 a bottle I'm more inclined to pick up a Chimay or Hennepin. Certainly worth a look, particularly if you go for ales with a lighter profile than stouts or even ambers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,AlexJ,4.52,"750 ml cork finish  Light clover honey yellow in color with a puffy white head of tiny bubbles. Head retention is quite good with a few patches of lace. There are cascading tiny bubbles coming from the bottom of my chalice.  The aroma is full of ripe apricot, honey-drenched oranges, pear, banana, and plenty of trademark Uni spice and yeasty bread notes. There is a sweet hint of alcohol to warm it up a bit.  Ooh ya, this is good. There is definately a fuzzy apricot sweetness highlighted by honey, melon, sweet floral tones, coconut, bubble gum, candi sugar, some light herbals, and yeasty spice. There is a touch of fruity hops at the finish to provide a sense of balance.  The mouthfeel is medium and light on the tongue. Ample carbonation provides a silk like body and carries through to the sweet, summer fruit finish.  This is an excellent beer from our kanuk friends to the North. Sweet, complex, perfect for summer sipping or as a fireside warmer. Definately one of my new favorites. I can't wait to try it again!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Extremely light tasting, with a melting warmness from the alcohol which covers the tongue. The alcohol flavor is hidden behind a blend of light malt and citrus. Nothing is overpowering here. Everything is subtle. You might think you are drinking a ""small"" summer beer, as the 9% of this one is so well masked.

The nose is a wonderful parade of apples, earthy yeast, cabbage, lemon grass and white pepper. The taste has a development I've never experienced. At first sip bitter fruit, then a nice round malt, then a dry, mineral hop finish. All this happens very quickly, carried on a fine, dense carbonation. The aftertaste is herbal and peppery and has a nice malt character. As it warms more of the lemon grass and cabbage aromas come forward, smells I associate with a good white burgundy.

Faint aroma- of spices (orange peel), fruit (a hint of cranberry and strawberry), and malt. Some alcohol. Pleasant, but could be stronger and more complex.  Luxurious mouthfeel, caramel sweet. A prominent bitterness and alcohol presence. Long finish of caramel and fruit.  Although well put together, this beer tends to become cloying towards the end of a bomber- ultimately reflected in drinkability problems. Still worth a try.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

So I have a stash of 9-year old beers! Used my only tulip glass for this one, and it poured a nice hazy yellowish ale; some head, the rapidly dissipated; little lace, if any. It's smell is complex: prunes, wildflowers, spices. Taste? Oh my! Great balance of hops, bitter even some sweet in it. Even more complex than it's smell. Creamy; it's high alcoholic content doesn't impose itself Of course you'd like more than one. But this is fancy beer. Drink better, drink less.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,SupaCelt,4.1,"The colour of this beer was golden. Heavily gaseous out of the bottle, with a large and loudly bubbling white head. The head died down rapidly and the heavy carbonation fizzled down to a dull roar. Yeasty bits were visible, suspended in the view. No lace formation. Looks good.  The smell was spiced and clovey with some degree of sweatness notable. A somewhat yeasty presence also lingered.  The taste was very refreshing and crisp. These guys seem to be able to brew these styles with the perfect amount of spice character that doesn't leave you feeling like you just drank a glass of potpourri. Very tastefully done and delicious. Apple flavors and a pinch of hoppy dryness add complexity to the spice backbone. Good bite and a nice crisp mouthfeel with a slightly clovey finish left over. Very highly drinkable with a very pleasant flavor. Another solid brew from the Nordiques.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Pale straw colored (almost like a wit), with suspended yeast visible in the beer.  Smell - Chalky or dry yeast smell followed with light spicy aroma.  Taste - Some dried fruit flavor, with crisp spices. The beer is actually pretty dry, and the hops seem to play this up. The alcohol is almost undetectable.  Mouthfeel - Quite fizzy, which adds to the delight. Pretty smooth overall, with a little tang to mix things up.  Drinkability - This is a beer that feels good to drink. I expected a hard hit in the back of the throat due to the carbonation, but it goes down quite easily.  Comments - Pretty to look at, tastes great, likely to help you pick up chicks...

Not very complex. The taste was clean and hoppy. Some hop bitterness and spices that I can't quite describe. A little too much of a dry finish for my liking, but still not too bad. Very drinkable beer. The ABV goes almost unnoticeable and I drank the whole bottle in much faster time than I expected to. Nice brew overall that I would have again any day.  Made a nice complement to a steak that I cooked for dinner, but something darker would probably complement it better.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ommegangpbr,4.3,"Tastes like a hard cider. Has way more alcohol than your average hard cider. Has many fine champagne type qualities. Sweet, yet dry for the sweetness level, and very bubbly. A very tasty, deceptive concoction. Unibroue does fine work and this is yet another example of such.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,asabreed,4.5,"12 oz. bottle from the 4-pack I just bought. Best before 11/17/07. Drinking at room temperature of course.  Appearance: Huge, foamy white head surrounding it's champagne style look. Bubbles galore. Lacing sticking everywhere on my wine glass.  Smell: Lemon, faint banana, grass, some floral qualities, cloves, candi sugar, a spiciness similar to pepper. Pretty wonderful.  Taste: Carries over from the aromas. Some spiciness, some fruitiness, slightly bitter but welcoming aftertaste that is very nice. Some lemon and candi sugar up front. Very refreshing.  Mouthfeel: So many bubbles keeps making me swish around and enjoy before swallowing, though the bubbles start to explode without any swishing around. Light in body, creamy.  Drinkability: I'll definitely be buying this again for sure. I could see it becoming a staple for me, at least every once in a while. It's delicious and it's a sipper. I can hardly believe this is 9% ABV.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,WTexas,3.88,"Poured from a 750ml bottle, with a best before date of 09-09-07, into a goblet glass. Presented itself with an opaque golden color with a rich head which devolved into persistent lacing. Smelt fresh and spring-like with an effervescent scent. Initially tasted of apples with a slight alcohol aftertaste. As it warmed, I detected an increasingly pleasant taste that reminded me of cola with a hint of sweet citrus. Excellent balance of carbonation and smoothness. Easy to sip and equally easy to return to the cooler for another 750ml bottle. Fine example of this style. Kudos to Unibroue for another outstanding product.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,thesilverhand,4.25,"For starters, this bottle was gently handled and properly stored, yet when opened, it erupted in a flow of (very nice smelling) creamy white foam. Not quite sure why - I've had La Fin du Monde many times before without that happening, so I'm willing to overlook it this once. After I got it into the tulip, it appeared a very hazy golden orange, with a thick creamy white head that dissipated, leaving some lace. The nose is sweet, with a hint of orange peel and spice. Very nice. On a first taste, it is surprisingly subdued. The orange and spice - nutmeg, perhaps? - noted in the aroma are here, but not a strongly as expected. The high alcohol is apparent in the dry finish, but overall is hidden very well. On the palate, La Fin du Monde is nicely balanced, with a good creamy body and light carbonation. The alcohol does come through a bit here, too. Overall, this is a fantastic beer, and is highly recommended. Certainly, it is one of the better beers from my home country.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,swamiswamu,4.97,"Pours like a wit with a healthy white head and a cloudy golden body. The aroma hints at yeast and lemon zest. This is the most refreshing beer out there. Rorshack flavor test; orange, lemon zest, yellow cake, white pepper. I somewhat don't believe this beer is 9%. It just seems to disappear from the glass. This is my favorite widely available beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Shaw,4.2,"This is another great Belgian Strong Pale Ale following in the footsteps of Duvel. Unibroue makes some great beers.  This looks good: Pale golden with a nice white head. It's not the massive head that Duvel has, which some may prefer. It smells of grain and spices and alcohol.  The taste is very good. It's spicy with a nice alcohol kick.  The mouthfeel is light, probably because of the high ABV. It glides over the tongue with the tiny bubbles popping everywhere.  Overall this is one of the best of this style. It's easy to find, so go out and have some!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,yoko,3.85,"This creamy opaque golden delight mounted a rich white two finger head that slipped down to a milky-like cover that made for a sticky lace. Throughout the length of the beverage there was a continuous feed of bubbles delivered in fizzures of fine streams reaching upward. Ripe apricot-peach, soft citrus, yeast, and a subtle clove and etoh made for a delightful nose. At times there was a lurking metal essence noted. A medium dimension filled the mouth with again, the fruit of the nose, a hay tang, with light floral and gentle spice. This stuff warms the belly. This La Fin Du Monde 12 oz. bottle was with much carbonation, for me it was too sparkling for balance. The finish was sweet with a dry, peppery, bubbly presence. Unfortunately a mucky aftertaste was left at the back of the mouth. I can appreciate the grand reviews this brew receives but for me, for this bottle, it was not there.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ypsifly,4.33,"750ml with best before date on the back label.  Pale gold with a frothy white head that never really goes away and leaves plenty of lace as it slides down the tulip. Lots of tiny carb bubbles.  Smells of tart apples, powdered sugar, and something floral.  Starts out a bit sweet, then changes to pepper with a dry, hop finish. The alcohol warms you up but that's the only way it registers.  The hidden alcohol gives this one extra points for drinkability.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Smell: Fruity character with notes of clove, yeast, honey and some pepper.  Taste: Nicely balanced, smooth and creamy. Has a spicy, yeasty flavor with some sweet malts.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and full with medium carbonation. High alcohol content is not too invasive.  Drinkability: An easy to drink beer until the high abv catches up to you.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bceaglejoe,4.32,"Served in a snifter at Walt Disney World - MGM Studios Brown Derby restaurant.  Presentation: Poured a cloudy dark-banana color. There was about an inch-thick head. I was able to agitate and swirl to keep the head coming back as I drank. There was some yeast at the bottom of the bottle that went into the beer as well. The scent was, like the appearance, very banana-y and heavy with phenol aromas. The snifter captured the aromas perfectly.  Tasting: This beer went down very smoothly. It tasted very much like a Witbier, but with more body. The alcohol flavor came through in this beer. Due to this it was not as smooth in the mouth as I would have liked. The high alcohol content of this beer makes it slightly less drinkable. One could easily get a buzz drinking this on an empty stomach.  Overall, an excellent beer that I would highly recommend to just about anyone. Even non-beer drinkers could appreciate it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,RBorsato,4.77,"Hazy yellow gold with a full white head, decent carbonation, and OK lace. Spicy Belgian yeasty aroma with spicy hop character and flavor; not overly strong in alcohol in any way - surprising for strength. Very nice medium-full body with perfect carbonation level.  Excellent but a bit drier than Duvel if that is what you like more.  Per U website: Triple fermentation Golden Ale, refermented in the bottle.  Best Before: 10/05/07 Tasted: 03/09/05",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mynie,4.52,"Pours a very pretty hazy honey color but, sadly, with little head.  Smells likes champagne nitrate and fruit. Nice and powerful.  Tastes very much like it smells, only more subdued. Powerful honey malt upfront leads into the strong, violent fruit that zips and zaps and leaves you wanting more as it disolves into cloves and spice.  Truly an exceptional beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bensiff,4.38,"I have visited this fine beer on many a night. This night I write my review at the end of a 750ml bottle and its 9% alcohol is not pronounced in the mouth, but evident in the head.  This fine beer poors with the looks of a hefeweizen and a nice head that slowly dissipates into a slight lacing. Smell is dominated with Uni's distinct yeast.  Taste is of yeast, fruity esters, and a touch of citrus that rolls off with the alcohol content leaving a slightly peppery feel on the tongue.  This fine beer leaves a wonderous full weight on the tongue while remaining light in comparison to the darker belgium styles. I say drink this as much as your beer exploration will allow and don't settle for only a 12 ounce when there is a 750ml available.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Hibernator,4.85,"I had this from a 12 oz brown bottle and served in a tulip glass as suggested on the label. There is a best before date clearly labeled for 08/16/07. Nice looking bottle with a foil top.  Pours a hazy golden yellow with a foamy white head on top. Scattered sticky lacings cling to the sides of the glass.  Aroma of cloves, yeast, fruity esters, and a tad of spices in the background.  This is one of amazing beer. I am impressed. Very smooth with pressured carbonation on the tongue. Orange citrus flavors, cloves and peppery spices blend together for an inviting experience for the palate. In all respects, this beer reminds me of a Belgian Tripel.  This is an excellent beer and only leaves me wondering why I haven't had this beer before. Highly recommended.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Fish113d,4.15,"Presentation: Served from a 12 oz. bottle at room temperature into a tulip glass.  Gold in color with lots of beautiful cascading and a huge foamy head that clings to the glass. Lots of sediment floating in it as well. Great looking! Aroma is mostly citrus and sweet smelling hops. I also catch some hints of something reminding me of honeysuckle a little. Also, the yeast is apparent as well (unless I'm stupid). This could be a little honey or presence of the alcohol sugars I imagine. Nutmeg and spice up front with hints of sugar and citrus fruit. However, the alcohol kicks you in the palete real REAL hard also. Aftertaste reminds me of papaya fruit a little or a little like orange peel; kind of bitter yet sweet. Carbonation is well balanced and is not too strong on the sip, to which the alcohol burn hits your palete drying it out a bit before the swallow. I honestly wish I had a bomber of this one. Very easy to drink, refreshing, and tasty! Another Unibroue masterpiece!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Paddez,4.57,"I found this little gem in a beershop in Neuchatel in Switzerland, among many other beers that are very hard to find (at least here). (including Dolle Brouwers beers, rare chistmass brews and many other that I couldn't find here in Belgium) I was delighted to find out that this was not the the french export version either, but the genuine candian stuff with 9% ABV.  Moving on the review.  A medium pour produced a nice trothy head that settled on top of a hazy, golden brew. The smell is fresh, yeasty with some fruity aspects and some floral notes. Citrusy flavours blend in with a malty undertone. Some spices & a slightly dry and hoppy finish. Most excellent. Goes down very smoothly, with no hints of the high ABV in the taste. Very deceiving as this is a pretty heady brew and quaffing this one too quickly with an empty stomach will almost certainly have its effects.  Very Belgian in both taste and smell. It has many elements of a solid belgian blonde but it's stronger, rounder and creamier. Top notch!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,SaunaKing,4.03,"cloudy yellow ale with a little yeast floating around. Thin white head, no lacing. Sweet aroma with a balanced taste of sweet malt and a little tartness in the finish.

22,34,Southernbrew,4.25,"Pours a lovely golden orange, large bubbly head.  Aroma is faintly sweet with some candied sugar and wafts of citric fruit, possibly tangerines.  Medium-full bodied with rich carbonation. Nice and creamy feel to it. Rich sweetness combines with a light orange fruitiness and a light yeast flavor. Some spiciness and faint alcohol flavor lead into a dry finish. A pleasant blend of sweets, fruit and fruitiness remain in the aftertaste.  A fine Belgian Strong pale, a pleasure to drink.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,foXXtail,4.77,"La Fin Du Monde translates as The End of the World and if you ad till on the front, that is exactly how long I would drink this beer if I could.  Ive come to expect No demand high quality (and high alcohol) beers from Unibroue, but somehow I am still surprised by the amount my mouth waters when I simply think about this beer. Did I mention I like it a lot? Good.  The beer sings of its thickness on the way out of the bottle, pouring out almost like coffee creamer. The shade is quite an attractive antique gold, and the beer quickly develops a very generous frothy head. The head reduces almost as quickly as it formed, but a small amount is maintained due to the rapidly rising bubbles. The smell is staggering  an estery banana / vanilla nose that sends my tastebuds to watering. A fruity-hoppiness is also present as well as some lemony citrus. The smell of alcohol is also heavy, no doubt due to the hefty ABV.  The beers taste is somehow even better than its nose. A lemon tang brings up the front, smoothly blending into a sweet vanilla, banana and clove middle with a touch of nutmeg. The beer finishes up with a lingering hop taste, balancing the sweet start nicely. The mouthfeel is absolutely superb. Bright and effervescent and surprisingly creamy it slides down the throat like a velvet glove. Youll have to excuse me for waxing poetic, but I feel that cheesiness can give way to accurate description in this case.  I cannot say enough good things about this beer. If not for the high ABV, I could drink this all night.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,skybluewater,4.3,"Pours a murky gold color. Smells of yeast and citrus. Taste is very nice, with the alcohol well hidden. Citrus flavors emerge, as well as some spices (clove?). There's a touch of lemon, but softer, like a meringue. The mouthfeel seems a little syrupy, but not at all bad.  This is a darn good beer. While I would normally drink something maltier and darker on such a bitterly cold night, the higher ABV (while not noticible) of this one warmed me up fine. A very tasty brew indeed, one that I wil definitely be having again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,PossumJenkins,4.33,"""I can't believe it's not Belgian""... that was my first thought upon tasting this gem from Quebec for the first time. Wow, what a beer. Beautiful pouring brew, with rich golden translucent color and massive, thick, Duvel-style head. Smell also first-rate: various spices and fruits accompany a malty base. Taste is just about perfect. I don't feel that I've tried enough beers yet to be able to give one a 5, but this is the closest I've come. Lots of banana flavor - almost sweet, but not sickly sweet...I don't generally care much for sweet beer, but this one just works somehow. Very rich, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, an absolutely outstanding beer. Compared to a couple of the ""real"" Belgians I have tried, I would rank it slightly higher than La Chouffe and slightly below Duvel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,beerfox,4.92,"This beautiful belgian pours hazy yellow, like a misty sunrise at the beach. The head is rocky and thick, dissipating to a thin layer with belgian swirls. Lacing is impressive.  The aroma is clean and floral, spiced with cloves and a fruity bouquet, with hoppy character. I love this style of beer.  Accents of clove, banana and apricot, with a clean and crisp hoppiness, abound. The malts are well-balanced with the hop bitterness. This beer could make me lose my way back to reality. This is exceptional brew! Warms as it flows down the throat, leaving a glow from the combination of hops and alcohol.  I could drink this for eternity! Truly a beer worth seeking out!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,FranklinPCombs,4.38,"This beer is first off great to look at. The color is a light golden honey color, with a slight bit of cloud in the body. A constant stream of bubbles comes up the middle from the bottom of the glass and the head is thick, white and foamy. The smell is crisp and spicy, with plenty of the typical wheats that you would expect from a Belgian. Various spices and fruity aromas as well as some nice grassy flavors are all underpinned by a subtle hint of alcohol. The taste is great on this beer. It is my first Belgian of any sorts in quite a while, and after drinking it, I remember why I like them so much. The body is full and thick with wheat flavors and some spices, very reminiscent of the Hennepin (as I'm sure they're brewed using essentially the same process). It's all very mellow but the more subtle tastes come through after sitting on the tongue for just a second or two, with flavors of cherry and grape, but nothing to overpower the wheat. There's really not very much hop flavor to this beer, but that would probably ruin the delicate flavors. Dry and heavy yet tiny carbonation. Very drinkable, belies the high alcohol content.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Taste: Explosive musty fruitiness that finishes dry and bitter. Oh God, yes. I can die a happy man. Yeasty, fruity, vinous, alcoholic, oh this is beer I live for. Apple and pear predominate in this vinous, alcoholic brew.  Mouthfeel: Oh yes. Just like a good Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Wonderfully attacking with carbonation and not watery. Excellent.  Drinkability: Is this heaven?  Notes: Dear God, this is good. It looks as good as any trappist and tastes as good, too. Damn I love this beer, especially when it warms.

Mouthfeel was very smooth, and you don't notice the high ABV at all. This is considerably better than I remembered it, and I used to really enjoy it.

This beer is highly carbonated like champagne and leaves belgian lace on the side of my glass. Aroma is malty sweet with plenty of fruitty esters and a hint of alcohol. Flavor is fruitty and spicy, clove with a hint of banana. Malt flavor is there in the taste and also a bit of hops to balance the bitterness. I wonder if this beer is spiced or if it is all from the yeast. Nice mouthfeel but a little to carbonated for my liking, however, once the beer breathes for awhile it dies down to a reasonable level. Good drinkability for the style and the abv but definately not a session beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Smells appealingly of sweet citrus fruits blended with yeast and peppery spices. Flavors start with sweet fruits and pepper spice, develop into warming alcohol esters, and finish with a lovely drying yeastiness. Creamy in the mouth with strong carbonation. Superlatively appetizing and drinkable considering the high strength.  A fantastic Belgian strong pale ale!

Poured a hazy yellow with very nice carbonation. Floral aroma and a real spicy kick to the taste. However, can taste the alcohol. Mouthfeel fantastic. One bottle went to the head . . . impressive.

22,34,trevorwideman,4.4,"This is one of my favorite beers, and now that it's readily available in Manitoba, I'm Laughing.  Pours a hazy, relatively opaque golden colour with a highly carbonated head that subsides to a thin lace, smell is alternately warm and inviting and light and airy...very Belgian. The taste is of coriander and spice, mildly citrussy, also wheaty, and very complex. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated but the alcohol is so well hidden that it goes down awfully smooth, deceptively so. The only reason that the drinkability goes down IS the high alcohol, which prevents me from pounding these back. The price is also a setback, but what can you do for such a high-quality beer. The best beer brewed in Canada in my opinion, but I can't say I've drank all of them either. Very highly recommended!  After One Year: Head retains a little less after a bit of time, but the lacing stays. Aroma hasn't changed much, still very spicy, fruity and yeasty, but with a bit more of that oily orange peel bitterness. Taste is a little drier, a little yeastier. The flavours are melding into a more glorious whole and losing a bit of their distinctiveness, but that's not a bad thing. I'll come back to this in a another year.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,GDMFSOB,4.82,"This beer is fantastic. I wholeheartedly believe that La Fin Du Monde can stand up to any beer in Belgium. I could drink this stuff all night, and on several occasions I have.

22,34,cro250klr,4.45,"My first La Fin was had about a year ago, right about the time I jumped ship. After being aboard the USS Anheuser for nearly twenty years my taste buds couldn't appreciate this fine creation. Now I get sick when I think of all the money I wasted over the years on that fizzy urine. This is a great beer to drink and forget how stupid I was. While I'm not a big fizz lover, and this brew is well carbonated, I do love this stuff. The head and the cloudy appearance are reminisent of a wheat beer. That notion hits the bricks once the nose catches the aroma of a variety of fruits. I'll sit and swirl this grog in a chalice until some of the head dies off and it warms slightly. Then, that's when I think this beer can really be appreciated. The sharp carbonation is calmed a bit and the mouthfeel is smooth, malty, fruity and not overpowered by the 9% abv content. The finish is a bit dry but that just makes you want another sip. Before you know it, the bottle is empty and you'll be yearning for another. This is truly an all season brew. Summer or winter, this concoction is consistent, delicious and dangerously easy to drink. Oh, Canada!

Aroma is dry with an apple like ester and some clean pale malt with a hint of alcohol. The flavor begins with a a smooth sweet maltiness that is reminscent of a pale bock in that it has a light cereal sweetness. The flavor soon segues into a hoppy flavor that makes itself known but is not bitter or overpowering. The flavor finishes with no heat or any indicator of the high level of alcohol this brew contains which to me makes it a perfect beer to introduce a friend into the pleasure of a belgian style beer. Very beautiful beer though it definetly commands respect as it goes down smoother than a glass of milk.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,CortexBomb,4.45,"Pour is cloudy but pale yellow with a massive white, frothy head which sticks around for some time. Smell is mainly spicey with light fruits, wheat, and a somewhat floral / hoppy tinge all also there; distinctively belgian and inviting.  A tremendously appealing taste, a soft wheat tone mixes with fruity goodness; oranges, some other harder to ID citrus, a spicey bite (softer than Maudite but still good) and plenty of yeast as well. There is also a nice hop tone that starts it off and hangs around throughout which is enjoyable, it's there, but doesn't try to dominate the flavour like so many overly hopped beers are. There is also a noticeable alcohol tinge, not strong, but present. Overall taste is high quality all the way.  Mouthfeel, well, good, it feels full for the style (has some body) but it's not quite up there with the best, signficantly better than average though. Drinkability meanwhile is also up there, particularly for a higher alcohol content beer.

22,34,cooter,4.18,"Helluva purdy pour! Creamy, frothy...*dramatic* head. A persistent, beautiful, cloudy tan body. Very aesthetically pleasing. [ed note: at the finish of this beer, I find it to be very possibly the most aesthetically pleasing beer ever. Beer goggles?]  Smells of pineapple, yeast, alcohol, raspberry, wheat-beeriness, and...melon? Intriguing to my nose.  First thing I notice about the taste is, strangely enough, the fresh-bready aftertaste. Second swallow, notice the pungent fruitiness. More pineapple. Tough to put my finger on a lot of these tastes, but it's light, slightly fruity (less so than the smell), and pleasant. Raspberry seems to be here...I feel like I'm hunting in a beautiful forest for a tree that I recognize, but they're all, despite their niceness, unidentifiable.  I seem to be nearly done with the beer without noticing doing so (and I don't have a drinking problem, I promise!), so I guess it's damn drinkable. My *only* complaint is that I doubt I could have another and not be beset by the pain of (too-)rapid inebriation and overload of powerful flavor.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bloberglawp,4.74,"I've been enjoying Unibroue's fine selection of beers for quite a while now. I was amazed to find (colecting dust on the floor) a 6 pack of this particular brew labelled ""2000"" at a local corner store.  All I can say is : store this gem. Stash it, Keep it celared away and forget it for at least 4-5 years.  I've had fresh ""la fin du monde"" and as some might have mentionned, carboniation is strong and alcohol taste is also very pronounced. After 4.75 years of shelving these attributes haved toned down, giving it a mellower yet fully flavored ""la fin du monde"".  Don't get this review wrong, this brew does not grow weak with time, it grows... becomes more mature...  Store this beer! I beg you!!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,sardonic,4.87,"In my review for Maudite, I mentioned that you can definitely notice the 8% abv, but I didn't notice the 9% abv in la Fin Du Monde at all. I'm not sure I'll ever drink a beer I like more than this in my entire life. Smells and tastes relatively sweet, and is a pretty cloudy golden color. Mouthfeel and drinkability are incredible as the alcohol is hidden so well that I could drink this like, forever. Now that I've tried Unibroue I'm gonna save them for nice occasions since I can't live my life spending this much on beer...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Smell is somewhat indistinct citrus (grapefruit, orange and or lemon), malt and spice. Taste is malty, grapefruit/orange, hops (though not to heavy), spice (nutmeg & allspice, maybe a little pepper), very complex. Mouthfeel is very smooth, warming in the throat, full bodied. Drinkability is huge, only restriction is the 9% ABV. Otherwise, I could drink this all day.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Rio,3.92,"12 fl oz bottle, silver foil wrapper around the neck. Pours as something of a hazy straw color, nice, thick head of tiny bubbles that seems like it's gonna stick around for a bit. Nice, sweet smell to it, with a bit of a floral smell to it as well. Very smooth, pleasing aroma.  The smooth sweetness carries over to the taste, as well as a bit of a spicy touch, perhaps a bit of clove or something similar. Strong malt flavor at the start, with some hop flavor that follows, almost completely masking the alcohol. Mouthfeel is almost a bit creamy, with a powdery, almost dry feel to it at the end.  A very good beer. I like most of Unibroue's offerings, but this is a new one for me. Very drinkable, despite being 9% alcohol.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,kindestcut,4.6,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into (what else?) a La Fin Du Monde glass.  The beer is a beautiful, shining gold with abundant carbonation. The head is massive, rising above the lip of my glass. Fluffy, white and cloud-like, it recedes after a few minutes leaving a wonderful example of Belgian lace along the side of the glass. A great pour.  The aroma is fruity and yeasty with an obvious spiciness. The alcohol is also evident in the aroma. The beer has a wonderful aroma.  The taste is dominated by a tart fruit and peppery spice. The alcohol that was so evident in the aroma is here, not so strong at first but warming as the beer is swallowed. Not a particular sweet beer, the yeasty quality is also at the forefront and a slight hops bitterness lingers. The beer is very carbonated, which makes this beer an interesting drink.  I would say that the La Fin Du Monde is very drinkable, however at 9% ABV, I would have to be very careful with my speed of consumption.  I love this beer!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,meathookjones,3.9,This poured out a murky golden orange with about a half-inch of white foam sitting atop the body. No lace was left as this was consumed. Aroma was very spicy with notes of a lemony zest and a bit of yeast as well. The taste stays true to the smell with spiciness really dominating with a touch of fruit over a doughy backbone. Lemon and apple notes were the most distinguishable. A nice spicy bitter after taste ending this lovely brew. Mouthfeel was bubbly with about a medium body. Drinkability was good and I would definitely have this again in the future. All around good brew.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,rugger,4.3,"Well I finally got ahold of this guy and am I ever glad that I did. The color is of a typical triple light in color however I had very little head that didn't stick around and no lacing. The smell is that typical lovely belgian smell with sweet smells of citrus and sourness. The taste came as a shock. This beer is as good as everyone says it is. Complex and just all round wonderful fruity and a hint of hops. This is a nice complex beer and a mouthfeel that you don't want to miss especially when you can feel it run across your tounge like a nice cold peice of ice, or something like that. Anyway I glad I only got a 4 pack at 9% I wouldn't be able to last much longer. I am sure these will all be gone soon.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Great Stuff!!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bignick,3.99,"This is no doubt a good beer. It pours almost a dissapointingly pale yellow, with a nice head lace that remains fairly well. The smell is spicy with hints of fruit. The taste is indeed strong and over the top, as advertised. The alcohol comes through strongly, as expected. The clove spicincess of the yeast leads into the bitterness of the hops. I am not sure if I am missing something here, but to me, this is a good, but not neccassirily world-class beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,clvand0,4,Pours a hazy yellow color with a small white head that sticks around. The aroma has a fruity and citrus-like feel. The flavor is yeasty and malty and has some fruit character.

22,34,BJ1833,4.2,"Presentation: 750 ml corked bottle  Appearance: Pale golden color with a thin white, quickly fading head.  Smell: Aroma is malty with a presence of ripe fruit. A slight yeasty bread smell with a faint alcoholic odor.  Taste: A malty, yeasty flavor mixed with dark fruit flavors (plum & dates). Alcohol can be easily tasted, but definitely not overpowering.  Mouthfeel: Good carbonation, but maybe a little bit overcarbonated. A lighter body than expected with a smooth slightly dry finish.  Overall this is a great brew. A very good representation of the Triple style. This is definitely one of my favorite belgian style ales.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,EvilFlyingCow,4.8,"I would have to say this is one of my favorite brews of all time. I really love this beer. Even the name is awesome: ""La Fin Du Monde"" is French for ""End of the World.""  I poured it into a glass and it immediately formed a thick, three-finger head. Bubbles continuously rise to the surface creating a nice lacing once the head has receded.  The smell is strong and fruity.  The taste is very malty, almost sweet but not quite. Very smooth going down, and the Belgian spice is notable at the finish. The high alcohol content is masked behind these immense flavors.  I am in love with this beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,OhioBulldog,4.18,"Pours a deep golden yellow, with a smaller fizzy white head. Small bubbles continuously run up the side of my glass giving the beer a nice ring of lacing. The aroma is a wonderfully sweet malty smell, some citrus and many floral accents. The taste is a very sweet, malty flavour, much like the nose, great belgian taste, can taste the alcohol, but it is hidden pretty well under the taste. Mouthfeel is smooth and clean, but very carbonated. My mouth is tingling from the effervescence and alcohol. This beer is wonderful and i feel i could drink this forever",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,zjungleist,4.05,"Had I not read a review for this beer, I would have never picked it up for the goofy label. Quite decent though. Citrus and bannana aroma. Tasted almost like a hefe at first. Clove and floral hops came next. Short lived head and carbonation. By the time I finnished the 750ml bottle, the taste was a bit too lingering. Perhaps it got a bit too much air. Good value for a belgian strong ale though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,HardTarget,4.71,"Bottle: Twist top brown bottle with silver foil. Lists Ale on Lees, 9% abv., triple fermentation, a blend of yeasts, translation of La Fin du Monde (the end of the world) glass suggestion (tulip, not flute) and a best by 05-10-07 (sampled in 08-04). Aroma: Strongly of yeast, with a mild peppery spice. Vanilla and nutmeg notes in the aroma as well. Appearance: A hazy peach nectar body topped by the fluffiest creamy paper white head. Strong carbonation streams noted. Stubborn patches of lace fight gravity as I join with this delightful brew. Flavor: Heavenly. A spiced fruit flavor. The fruit goes for the golden, apricot, honeydew melon, dates, and oranges. The spices are light and complimentary; nutmeg, light coriander, vanilla. There is a drying, almost dusty aftertaste that lingers as a shadow of itself. No alcohol flavors noted until the beer warms a bit, but fair amounts of the Belgian yeast flavor, and a light tea like flavor. Mouthfeel: Silky heavy body, but no chew with a dry, lip smacking finish. Overall Impression: This is a personal favorite and I saved it to put a splash into my mug for my 250th karma point. This beer turned me on to Belgian styles, and made me a HUGE fan of Unibroue in general. The yeast ties it to its cousins Trois Pistoles and Don de Dieu, but La Fin is drier, and cleaner. This is a great special occasion beer. Ive tried to turn a few people on to great beer with this one, but its a bit heavy and strong for most of the macro drinking crowd. Personally, this rocked my world at first taste. While this isnt a perfect 5 beer, its darn close. Drinkability in the short term is hampered by the heavy handed 9% abv. but I tend to buy this stuff by the case. I cant recommend this strongly enough to my fellow BAs that may not have tried this. Its a MUST TASTE beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,oxmasterscream,4.35,"Poured a frothy, three-finger head atop a golden orange, slightly cloudy brew into a tulip. It looked so refreshing. The aroma was spicy, cidery and fruity... the immediate tangible smell was sour green apples. If I took a big enough inhale, I could feel the alcohol in my nose. Tastewise, it was tangy, sweet, and sour, once again with a focus on an apple-like flavor, with a nice warmth from the high ABV. It sometimes reminded me of reisling and/or champagne - maybe a white grape twang in there too. For all the apparent sweet tastes, each taste ended up surprisingly dry. Drinking it reminded me of Duvel sometimes and Orval other times... strange. The mouthfeel of this beer was wonderful - effervescent and smooth. Obvioulsy, like other beers with high ABVs, as it warmed and was consumed, the alcohol became more and more apparent.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

In the glass, it looks very similar to Hefeweizen, cloudy hazy yellow with a large whipped head.  Aroma is slight of ripe bananas with a slight spiciness.. but not alot there  Taste is complex. As I said earlier pears, but ripe pears mixed with alcohol. Very nice.  All in all, a very solid brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,Boilermaker88,4.38,"Poured from a caged and corked bomber sporting a ""best by"" date of 04-05-07 on the back side of the label. Glassware of choice for this brew was my Duvel tulip glass. Great hazy golden color topped by a monstrous white head that seemed eternal, thanks to the incredible amount of fine carbonation that was hauling ass to the surface. Lots of clumpy lace left behind also. The nose carried the aromas of not-quite ripe bananas, doughy malt, clove, some coriander and a touch of white pepper. The clove aroma really took center stage here. The taste was like a hybrid hefeweizen and tripel; nice banana and clove flavors up front (though not as omnipresent as in a good hefe) and a more spicy herbal hoppiness in the latter stages (reminiscent of a tripel). Always present was a solid bready malt platform from which the other tastes emerged. The finish had a pleasant peppery bite that was nicely bitter. The feel was medium in body, leaning toward full, and quite dry. What a great beer! La Fin Du Monde is dangerously drinkable and must be accorded the respect a 9% ABV beer is due. It went great with my dinner and to relax with as I settled into the evening. Definitely worth picking up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,DrJay,4.37,"Slightly hazy straw yellow colour topped by a bright white, long-lasting head that formed some fine lace on the sides of the glass. Very nice. The aroma contained elements of ripe citrus/banana with a pleasant dose of spiciness (mostly clove-like). Some floral hoppiness is present, but is well balanced. Ripe fruit and sweetness are at the forefront of the flavour, with plenty of spiciness as well. Bitterness is present, but lies underneath the other flavours until it dries the palate at the finish, accompanied by a light pepperiness at the back of the tongue. Noticeable, but not overpowering, alcohol warmth in both the mouth and belly. Medium bodied, very smooth, with high carbonation. Effervescent right to the end.  750 mL brown bottle topped with cork, bottled on March 11, 2004 (code C114).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,rabidawg,4.23,"Appearance: Honey-lemon-sunshine with just a slight yeast cloudiness. Enormous white head that painted the inside of the glass with lacing. Extremely active carbonation.  Smell: Lots of phenolic yeast here, with banana and clove esters highly reminiscent of a hefe. Fusel alcohol is quite noticeable, and borders on distracting.  Taste: Honey-sweet at first, with alcohol rushing in and slightly numbing the tongue. Very warming, and quickly causes facial flush. Slightly cloying at times until the swallow, after which the taste is dry and very nearly wine-like. Phenolic is really the dominant taste here, with powdered sugar-like dextrins floating around as well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Drank during a Red Sox game the announcer called the worst baseball game Ive ever seen. Glad Ive got my End of the World with me!  Pours a hazy, glowing gold color. Moderate silky white head. Smells fruity and crisp. This beer is excellent! Heavy and hard hitting, this beer has a powerful spicy taste and a malty punch. Slight hops combine with the sharp, alcoholic aftertaste.

22,34,kosmoraios,4.2,"Presentation : Corked 750ml bottle poured into Duvel tulip glass. Excellent golden color, a tiny bit murky. A moderate head on the beer, but does not dissipate too fast.  Smell: Excellent, light aroma with definite nutty and fruity tones.  Taste: Superb. The best word I can use to describe this ale is: Champagne. Most wonderful, crisp, light, taste with just the right amount of hops and malt and a tiny bit of fruitiness. Wonderful. A top-of-the-line ale.  Mouthfeel: Excellent carbonation. Just the right amount to make it feel wonderful in the mouth.  Drinkability: A very light, not-too-filling ale. The only reason it got a 4.5 on drinkability in my book is that it is 9% ABV. Quite a kicker, but you'd never know by the taste. Only after you finish a 750ml bottle in the sun and then stand up do you realize that you are quite intoxicated.  An excellent ale. Do try this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,danadeny,4.63,"Head: Nice thick head (used the actual ""La Fin Du Monde"" glass from Unibroue) clings to glass as you drink, nice carbonation, and a lovely murky golden yellow color.  Smell: yeasty, with hints of fruit  Taste: Spicy and fruity at first. Then a little hint of hops in the middle, and a clean, bubbly, perky finish. as it warms more maltyness is detectible  Mouth feel: Bubbly, classic trappiste feel, medium thickness.

22,34,connecticutpoet,4.15,"A pale yellow, cloudy ale with a HUGE head that stayed through much of the glass. Very nice.  The aroma was smoky, which I didn't expect, and nutty, which I did. A little bit of bread-like scent there, due to the yeast, but mostly masked.  The taste was much like it smelled, rich, smoky, nutty, somewhat yeasty, but with an odd taste that I can only describe as... bacon. It was still pretty good, but the oddness of that combination in a beer threw me a curve.  I will probably try this one again when I see it, to see if that bacon flavor was an anomaly... even if it wasn't. it was still worth havin again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,finepaws,4.32,"Received this corked 750ml bottle as a gift. It had been sitting on top of a fridge for over a year. Exp. date put it good till 9/6/2005. I thought about keeping it awhile longer, but couldn't resist. Uncorked it, and carbonation slowly fizzed to the top. May have chilled it a bit too much. When it began to drip over, I poured. It had a nice frothy head that lasted throughtout the glass. Slightly toned down toward the end. Bubbles also lasted throughout, like a good champagne. The color was cloudy gold. Smells were very fruity, and maybe a touch floral. It tasted like apples, pears, and malt. Not bitter at all. As it warmed, it did take on an alcohol taste. Still nothing like I would have expected for 9% abv. Seemed almost rich in mouthfeel. Like a watered down milkshake consistency. As for drinkability, I found that it was gone too soon!!! Quick note on back of bottle, it was quite clear what type of glass it should be drank from. Showed correct picture, then a big X through incorrect one. I got a kick out of that.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Skywave,4.52,"Damn, I should have bought more than one bottle of this during my trip to Chicago. (I need to see if it can be ""imported"" into Oklahoma)  It pours to a generous white foam and cloudy gold color. Smell is floral, candylike and unbeerlike but good...smells like it has some good vitamins in it--real nutritious! Flavor is sweet and tangy and fruity with a weird after taste for which you have to acquire an appreciation. It's not awful, just different. Finishes fruity. Hops are detectable. This beer is exceptionally easy to drink so watch out for the buzz. It's like a ""hefe"" on steroids. A unique and unforgettable taste sensation.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Dithyramb,4.85,"Appearance: Incredibly good marketing folks at Unibroue. The packaging is very well done. I have purchased the foiled topped bottle. Serving suggestion and freshness dating on the back.  Smell: Fruity and sweet peach floral notes.  Taste: Oh yeah. Tingly carbonation. Very clean fruit flavors and a slight peppary flavor after the initial carbonation bite. Only a trace of hops on the back end.  Mouthfeel: Very clean smooth and creamy. Leaves me wanting more.  Drinkability: At first, I would be afraid of drinking several of something so high in alcohol. However, this is so nicely balanced, full-flavored, and tasty, I would definitely have a few. Amazing beer. I was always suspicious of Canadian beers, after being underwhelmed by Molson, but I will need to try Unibroue's other offerings now.  I just put a few imperial stouts in the basement for my first try at cellaring. I'll be adding one of these babies in the mix to see just how complex it can get. With the carbonation and alcohol, I'm hoping it will be even more tasty next year.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,TagoMago,4.9,"Presentation: 12 oz. foil-capped bottle poured slowly into a Scaldis tulip glass.  Appearance: Cloudy, pale yellowish-orange. This beer requires a slow pour as the head produced from pouring is quite active and intense. The head retention is beautiful, leaving my glass with a pretty lacing.  Smell: Fruity, with some peach notes. The beer is rather phenolic with a faint clove-like aroma from the yeast.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Incredibly smooth a creamy mouthfeel and a decent amount of carbonation to boot. The beer is rather sweet and fruity upfront with some spice. The finish is pretty dry where some hop character is noticable.  Overall: I consider this beer to be the greatest beer made on the continent of North America, and the best beer by the Quebec based Unibroue. This is a phenomenal Belgian-style ale, but also very artisinal and unique for its style. There are simply no other beers in the world like this one. This is a must-try brew!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Tastes nice. A wonderful balance of hops and flavor. I expected this to be another ""in your face"" Belgian and that is not the case. This is very easy drinking. A lovely pale ale to be savored.

22,34,99bottles,4.23,"Appearance: 12 ounce bottle, capped with foil poured into a tulip (Duvel) glass. The beer is a dark gold color and gives rise to an inch and a half of small fizzy white head. The retention is insane, with a solid 1/2"" remaining all the way until the end. Note: The etching on the bottom of the Duvel tulip provides a steady stream of carbonation. Very nice looking beer.  Smell: Very yeasty, even though I decanted slowly to not disrupt the ""lees"" on which this ale is triple fermented. Some funny corriander-lemon sourness comes through this yeast, as well as a light grassy-funk smell, much like some saison / farmhouse ales.  Taste: At once very unified and well balanced. To paraphase, this is 1/2 Duvel and 1/2 Saision DuPont. It has a nice fruity blend of esters, pear, apple, banana and a firm phenolic spiciness with soft yeast notes to blend the two extremes. Excellent and immensely drinkable.  Mouthfeel: Good, not overly thin, and also not too rich or viscous. Has great carbonation to lend the champagne like effervescence while retaining a moderate/dry maltiness to give this some feet on which to stand.  Drinkability: Also, very good. Drinks somewhat lightly, especially once one realizes it's high ABV of 9%. This beer is easily drank and tasty enough to captivate an interest throughout multiple bottles. My favorite beer from Unibroue that has made my list.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Dukeofearl,4.62,"Pours a hazy golden color with moderate carbonation. In a really interesting point of comparison, it developed a very pretty 2"" white head in a Delerium Tremens snifter and it developed almost no head (a slight covering of the beer only) in a Chimay goblet. Really says something about the importance of glassware. Anyway, the aroma was light, but with an incrediblly pleasant balance of sweetness, honey, light spices (vanilla among others I couldn't identify). Mouthfeel incredible (words don't come to describe it otherwise).  After having read about this beer on BA for some time now, I finally got a chance to try it this past weekend, and I think I have a new candidate for favorite beer. OK, let's say in the top 10. Not because it is as complex as some others I've had, but because the balance is just right on, and I felt like I could drink it and keep drinking it (I'm glad I didn't- that 9% ABV would have done some damage).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Appearance - Cloudy, light golden color with head to spare. One bottle produced a good 3 inches of sticky, long standing foam. The next bottle had to be poured in stages it had foamed so much. I rtied to leave the sediment in the bottle too.  Smell - Kinda funky. Not as bad as Trois Pistoles, but similar. Doesn't smell like beer.  Taste - It almost seems like it's gonna be fruity but then it isn't (whew). Lotsa yeast I suppose. Good pale ale flavor.  Mouthfeel - That carbonation really stays active the whole time.

22,34,Trentonator,4.72,"Caged and corked 750 ml bottle with very cool graphics, a best before date and even a suggested serving glass (tulip), which is exactly what I used. The cork comes off with a very nice resounding ""thump"", which foreshadows that this is not an ordinary beer. A moderately heavy pour reveals an appearance that is not too out of the ordinary, it's a apricot/darkish yellow, but there is a good sized head and some short-lived lacing. The taste is where this beer really shines. It's at once smooth and creamy, with some orange and tangerine tastes in there, but it also has some zest and fizziness. It also has a great smell, and reminds me of a lighter version of a Chimay or a Duvel. I really liked this beer, and it was reasonably priced (6.00 for a 750 ml).",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BadBadger,4.57,"Serving a 12 0z bottle. Expiration date 2 years from now-gotta love that. This bottle poured a beautiful hazy golden yellow color. A very small head was all that formed, but this was not a major let down. Smell was wonderful: fruity and with hints of pleasant alcoho undertones. Taste was fruity sweetness. Finish is very crisp. The high ABV is there but hidden well. This is a highly drinkable beer. Enjoy!.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Billolick,4.08,"Now this is more like it! Large bottle, corked and caged. Poured straw/golden and semi cloudy, white tiny bubble head and leaving lace.. Still not getting much of a nose, just a bit of wheat, bubble gum and yeast. Tastes/notes of wheat, yeast, bubblegummy phenolics, fruit, candy sugar, apricots, rum soaked grapes, yum yum. Finish is sweat and smooth. Crisp and nicely turned out Canadian Belgian.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Cwrw,4.12,"With a violent pop the cork came out, and out poured some liquid gold. The beer itself is thick, although pale looking, and pleasantly sedimentary and unclear, becoming more so with each glass from the 750 ml. Apple juice colouration, dull orange or yellow; I have seen better and more unique appearances in other Unibroue beers. It is still attractive, nonetheless. The head is near uncontrollable, gargantuan, soapy, bright aspirin-white, with good longevity. Soapy lace, large bubbles. The aroma is earthy yeast, citrus, coriander, apples, peaches, and actually reminded me of Hoegaarden, with more complexity. Belgian taste, slightly metallic, strong yeast, citrus, champagne-like, sweet on the front and surprisingly bitter on the finish, leaving a dry, port or sherry aftertaste. Strong spices, almost peppery, but with good enough maltiness and hop-level, leaving a clove-numbness on the palate. Mouthfeel is h-e-a-v-y. This has a very gassy carbonation, and is quite dry, leaving a feel similar to scotch or whisky in the mouth, which would prevent me from consuming these overly often, but this said, it is quite drinkable for such a highly flavourable and strong beer. Conclusion: for me personally, not my favourite from Unibroue, but compared to other breweries, this is still an absolute dream to consume. This Unibroue beer only tastes less-than-extraordinary when compared to its own line of products. Still a spectacular beer from Quebec. I have yet to taste the equal of Unibroue in North America.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,surfmeister,3.55,"Appearance: murky sunshine yellow, thick, frothy, soap bubble head with awesome staying power Smell: fruity, sweet with a mild sour/mildew characteristic Taste: malty and sweet, too sweet, a variety of condensed fruit, with a little hop bite at the end Mouthfeel: full, rich, thick foam, the best part of the brew Drinkability: unfortunately just to overbearingly sweet for me, but I'm a crisp clean lager guy, I rate it above average for it's unique flavor and complexity",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,AllThingsNinja,3.47,"The end of the world is a golden orange sunset, adorned with an elegant  though dissipating lace. Theres no explosions, just a subtle fire to spicy a mellow, alcohol laden brew. The banana and clove aroma is soothing while the flavors are simple, delicate, and diverse. Hints of pineapple in the hops were most surprising while the majority of the notes were standard fruits and spices. This is an average interpretation of an awesome style. Though light on body, this brew was quite drinkable. Cest la fin du la monde, et je me sens bien.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ybnorml,4.37,"I used the glass I had available. Not a snifter. I used a Pint glass. Nice clean dark yellow color not much head. The aroma was spicey with a light fruitiness. the taste was at first sweet then a strong spicey, peppery middle with a kind of light malt sweetness on the finish. I probably would have gotten more aroma from the proper glass. Very tasty with a consistant prickly carbonation throughout.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Gueuzedude,4.62,"Pours a hazy gold color, with an incredibly effervescent carbonation driven thick off white head. Aromas of garden fresh vegetables, spicy yeast, cider, and blooming fields of wild-flowers, all waft from my glass. I am greeted by a refreshing, spicy, sweet first draught of this effervescent brew. It tingles on my tongue as it goes down. An incredibly smooth, well integrated brew, it just seems to want to be quaffed, which, is quite dangerous given a beer of this strength. La Fin Du Monde indeed!  Quite appropriately this is sharp and spicy at various points. I get note of hay, bergamot, hint of pepper, lemon, an herbal bite, and some vanilla. Overall it definitely has some interesting soft citrus notes as well as some appetizing acidity. This is an awesome brew from a currently great brewery, lets hope it stays that way.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Soybomb,4.65,"appearance:Pours a nice slightly cloudy golden yellow with a big frothy head that drops to a ring of foam that leaves slight lacing on the glass. Each drink brings more bubbles up from the class.  smell: Popping the cork brought out cidery and spicy smells. A little fruit smell was also present once I got it into the glass.  taste and mouthfeel: Smooth and some sweetness from malts. Moderately high carbonation gives it a little bite on the finish, along with alcoholic warmth. Has a spicy taste with a light bitterness.  notes: Not near as much yeast and fruit flavor as I was expecting from this beer. Nice with alot of flavors that need to thought about to really pick out of the beer. Good, but probably not my favorite style of beer to begin with.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Phyl21ca,4.47,"Bottle: Poured a golden beer with a huge bubbly head with average retention. Aroma is a mix between something sweet which might be candi sugar and wheat. Taste is very refreshing with again a nice mix of candi sugar, wheat and something a bit spicier, which I cannot identify. Body if medium with great carbonation. I truly love this beer even after more then ten years of drinking it. Must be commanded just for helping discovered the fabulous world of beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,neil,4.77,"First, let me explain that I am an Englishman living in Maine (im a student). I've found it near impossible to get a good beer round here, despite the claims of many microbrews.  La Fin du Monde pours wonderfully, a big lively head that bubbles away, but yet the beer itself is perfectly carbonated naturally. 5 minutes out of the fridge and this beer was as smooth as silk on the tongue with a lush caramel hint with the tang of hops coming through. This beer just smells and tastes like a Beligian Ale should, the sweetness really comes home. At 9% I was expecting a kick/harshness; there was none.  This is a real sipping beer, not one to be knocked back. The taste stays strong and smooth, and this is after the bottle has been opened and out for close to 2 hours. A real beer to savor over the course of an evening, and one I shall be getting again.  Allagash take note, this is how it should be done.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,beckerboots,4.3,"It felt like I had to wait until ""la fin du monde"" (end of the world) for the head to subside. Poured very cloudy for a Belgian Ale, but I was quickly taken by the plethora of hops that were readily apparent. Unfortunately having a minor head cold did not help the cause. The triple fermentation seemed to reduce any hard after tastes that are usual for high ABV ales. Overall; quite impressed. Unibroue has done ""la Belle Province"" proud.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,rajendra82,4.1,"Bubbly, pale gold appearance with a tall 2 inch rocky head crowning outside the goblet. There is a good deal of streaming carbonation in the underlying liquid. The head dies down in a fairly short time, leaving lots of lace around the glass.  Aroma is perfumey-sweet with notes of bananas, grapes, cane sugar, and hay. In short, what I expect from a Belgian, but without the funky sour notes.  Taste is sweet (pears, apples, caramel, cherry) with a dose of lime-lemon sourness. There is also a peppery zest in the aftertaste. The overall taste is a bit milder than I anticipated. There is a lot of creamy smoothness, and a mellow blended quality with none of the flavors stepping in front as dominant.  This is a very nice take on a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, but is not quite in the same class as the great Duvel. I do hope the new owners of Unibroue leave this one alone.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,CBFanWish,4,"Pours a hazy straw yellow with a thick white head. Rising from the frothiness of the head is a beautiful fruity aroma of bitter green aplles and pears. A slight hint of floral as well. The taste was very fruity with apples, pears, and the slightest hint of lime. There was also a strong bready taste, which I have never beed fond of. Too yeasty in my book.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BrewMan82,3.55,"Pours golden yellow with a huge, hard to control pure white head - be careful on this pour. Head diminishes to 1/4 inch, where it resides until the bottom of the glass. Subtle lacing. Aromas of white grape, wine alcohol and freshly chopped wood shine through. Initial feel is intense carbonation - very fizzy and active on the tongue. First taste yields sharp grapefruit tartness with other miscellaneous fruity tones coming on strong. Sadly, this burst of flavor doesn't stick around long and abruptly gives way to an oaky and warm alcohol aftertaste. I found the flavor to be somewhat lacking in complexity compared to others I've had from Unibroue. The alcohol here is physically present (1/2 glass is enough to feel it) but hardly noticeable in the taste. This beer was good - I would have it again, but I was a bit let down by comparison.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Rastacouere,3.6,"The glass rapidly fills with a big white head. The beer is golden, pale enough. It smells fruits, malt and spices. In mouth, the alcohol is on the frontline, more than for the Fringante who proposed 10% ABV. Lemon, coriander and other sweet components stick to this alcohol and malt and leave a warming astringent feeling.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,coasterfreak75,4.06,"The pour was golden-yellow with a good three-quarter inch head that quickly dissapated to a white lace on top of the beer. The lace held on throughout the drink and stuck to the sides of the glass.  The smell was a mix of flowers and cirtus, almost lemony in nature. Just a hidden hint of spice that only showed up as it warmed.  The drink started very carbonated and sweet, not an overpowering sweet, just the right sweet. It was followed by a slight hint of hops, just enough to balance the sweet citrus attributes, and finished with a lingering citrus.  This is a damn tasty beer, it would go great with food or just sitting around with friends talking about beer. I hope to happen across this beer again, and soon.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,donnebaby,3.83,"The End of the World arrived in my glass an orange-yellow color and held thick lacing. A great beer to look at and admire.  The smell was a foggy and floury (and yeasty) orange peel and spice, but it was too little and too far away for me..  The alcohol in the taste seemed somewhat overpowering. It diminished as I drank, but never really completely put me at ease. An orange liqueur taste felt its way through--and I thought of Grand Marnier. An ample hop finish.  The mouthfeel was really lacking for me in this otherwise uni(brou)que brew.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,necoadam,4.61,"Ah! The end of the world is coming! Yup, it's sitting in my Corsendonk tulip glass and I love it. Poured out a dark pale yellow with a huge head that settled down quickly. Smell consisted of mostly citrius notes mixed in with some malts. A whiff of alochol is there too but not that much. Taste was great. Some sweeten malts mixed in with some spiciness and exotic fruits and/or pears. Smooth and creamy going down as well. Another terrific brew from Unibroue which is gaining quite a bit of respect from me lately.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,watermelonman,4.47,"This poured to a subdued yellow and gold color with a good amount of head. It shrank but still did a good job of lasting. The lace is thin but coats much of my glass.  The smell is somewhat fruity and very solid. The taste has hints of banana and other fruits up front and a bit of pepper in the finish. It's very full of flavor while retaining a relatively light body.  I've had other similar ales recently that let me down. La Fin Du Monde is exactly what they wish they were. This is strong yet balanced, and it is very good overall.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,babyhobbes,3.7,"Pours a golden, hazy color with a decent head,. This smells strongly of yeast and spices.  Very nice taste a little overpowering so I'm not likely to have several. The alcohol is felt but not bitingly so. The mouthfeel is pleasant and bubbly.  Another good brew from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Hex92,4.3,"Pale and clear big foamy head, but very little lacing. Smells real good, and the taste backs it up. Amazing flavor. I think this is a great beer. Better than the sum of its parts. Like everything from Unibroue its a tasty beer. Definitely will buy this on a regular basis.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,david23,2.5,Very nice packaging is the best I can say about this brew. Having read the other reviews I had to check the bottle again to be sure we are talking about the same thing. Aroma was pleasant although not very pronounced. Carbonation was disconcerting and left the tongue tingling. Perhaps I just don't like this style but it appeared to be someones kid sister's attempt at making champagne in her Easy-Bake oven.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Zorro,4.35,"Pours a cloudy gold brew.  Smell is sweet and spicy clove aroma with fruitiness. Perfume scents are in there with the alcohol scent.  Taste is sweet and spicy with a rose flavor.

22,34,Dubblebock,3.83,"La Fin Du Monde is a beer that I thought would just blow me away. I enjoy the Belgian strong pale ale style, for starters, and I really did anticipate being blown away by this one. And for my particular palate it's good, but not great.  The Fin poured well enough, leaving a tighly constructed head that didn't linger too long. The coloring was an orange-yellow hue, lots of floating sediment. Well carbonated, true to the style. Nose was ok, but not overly impressive. Hints of fruit and malts mixed with a definite alcohol twang.  The taste was kind of muddled for me. Not overly sweet, it still managed to be a bit cloying. Hints of fruits, figs perhaps. Slight apricot overtones. Good balance between the malts and hops. Very slight bitterness. The sample got slightly better as the beer warmed. Not overly complex.  The mouthfeel was kind of muddy and slack. I expected a more carbonated presence in the mouth, but I came away with a slightly earthy feel. Not appreciably smooth. Drinkability was good considering all of the factors. High ABV, slightly noticible in the mildly metallic aftertaste.  Not something I'll go out of my way to get again. There are better Belgian strong pale ales in my opinion (Delirium Tremens comes immediately to mind). Still not too bad, though. Glad I gave it a shot.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,soper2000,4.25,"Pours a beautiful golden hue with a nice foamy white head, which to my disapointment, didn't stick around too long. I believe this beer tastes like a clean duvel, faint notes of spice and hops. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp. Drinkability is great for a beer of this alcohol content (9.0). Unibroue makes some fine fine beers and this is one of my favorites. I think that this beer would make a great introduction to Belgian Pales.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Morris729,5,"Saved for my 500th Review. Pours a hazy golden sunrise color with a tremendous towering white head that slowly dissipates in chunks leaving a rocky lace and spider webs across the glass. Nose is lots of fruity esters with notes of banana, clove, bubblegum, and a bit of spicy alcohol. Fairly full in body with a very fine champagne-like carbonation that is oh so smooth. Taste begins with a good deal of fruitiness (nectarine, pear, peach, mango, and white grape) and flowery honey blended with peppery clove. Next comes some powdery yeasts and a bit of bready malt followed by a touch of drying alcohol (which, considering the 9% ABV, is very well hidden indeed). The End of the Worldthe flagship beer from one of the worlds finest breweries, and one of my all-time favorites. Simply delicious.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jsolack,4.2,Appearance: Cloudy pale yellow. Head is light and dicipates quickly. Overall it's nice looking.  Smell: Smells like sweet wheat with hints of peach and clove. Interesting smell that I really enjoy.  Taste: Sweet and light... has a complex flavor. When first in mouth it has strong fruit flavors. Peach and hints of banana. After than a slight bitterness comes in. Finish has wheat accents.  Mouthfeel: Feels thick in mouth. Coats tounge well and leave a crisp aftertaste.  Drinkability: A great beer. Tastes really good and goes down really smooth.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ChrisBowers,4.08,"Let me just say first off that I'm going to review this as a Tripel, cause thats what it seems more like than a strong pale ale. It is also triple fermented, so why not?  Poured into a tulip goblet, beer poured a straw yellow with a nice fluffy head. Scents of fruit, belgian yeast and alcohol present. First sip, hints of apple, pear, and hops. Finish hides its 9% ABV well. This one had mellowed for about 6 months since I had bought it. Might try another for significantly longer. I should add that I am normally not a big fan of tripels, but this one pleased me greatly. A very smooth, drinkable beer despite its high ABV.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,GuinnessSmurf,3.82,"What a great experience this beer was. I've had to change my review on it having polished off 8 of them this month. At first, i wasn't sure about this beer (or the Maudite), but I have discovered that they are really fine brews.  The head quickly diminishes and leaves you with a bright yellow pint of beer. Smells like a hoppy wheat beer and has similar grapefruit notes.  The taste is outstanding. A blend of pear, hops and alcohol that don't overpower each other, but rather fit smoothly into one another.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,fdrich29,4.7,"This is the first Belgian Golden Ale Ive ever tried, so I dont have anything to compare this to, if its a good representative of its class. Juding from its rating on BA Top 50, I trust that it is.  I love the pour which produces an ample head that quickly evaporates away, leaving the golden blond color of the beer. The smell is of hops, spice and malt and has a smooth, sweet taste and a pleasant mouthfeel. I gave it a high drinkability rating as I find it quite enjoyable and always look forward to my next one.  A fine product by Unibroue out of Quebec with 9% abv. Farily accessable here in Massachusetts and well worth the approximately $8.00 per bomber that it sells for.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jlervine,4.79,"Best by date of 3/18/05. Poured a fizzy bubbly pale golden color. White head formed, but sank quickly. Smell was spicy, bready, yeast-dominant. Sweet scents slowly drifted upwards, along with a cidery fruitiness. Taste is unbelieveable. Peppery tartness, hint of alcohol, fades into a spicy dry finish. Mouthfeel is warm and smooth, not so much piqueing the interest of any particular sensation as much as massaging them all at once. This is one helluva beer, just wish the head lasted longer than 20 seconds.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,NearerMyBeerToMe,4.1,"Pours with a firmly-retained head of foamy, small, pure white bubbles that clumps slightly and slides easily back into the glass after a swirl. Beer is a color like translucent (but not truly hazy) goldenrod with straw-gold highlights. Turbulent, racing carbonation sends a few yeasties into convection currents along the sides of the goblet. Almost all of the aromatic nuances seem to belong to the light, sweet, estery yeast. A consistent clove/coriander spiciness is, with warmth, joined by vodka-soaked bananas in a slightly bready nosefeel that finishes dry. Juicy and softly malty up front on the palate; sustained by a spicy tartness moving from clove to ginger (particularly in the aftertaste) and a finish of slightly grassy hops. At room temperature, flavors of banana bread crusts, lemon pith, and powdered sugar emerge. Spiky mouthfeel with an alcoholic warmth and a pearish mealiness; mellow dry spiciness in the finish. Although I love this beer, I prefer less breadiness and more effervescence in a Belgian Strong Pale. Perhaps this is why IMHO this beer is the perfect accompaniment to scrambled eggs or quiche.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Sixpack595,5,"The first time I had this was in a dive selling all their oddball beers for a buck! Out of the bottle I though it was good, I saw the ABV, I thought it was great. Later I found a fresh 750ml and tried it out of the proper glass... OMFG, this beer is perfect!  Popping the top you get a whiff of green apples and a puff of gunsmoke. Pouring this incredable beer results in a slightly hazy body crowned by a creamy mound of white foam. Sweet and fruity with apples and pairs in the begining a perfectly balanced bitterness give a dry, spicy finish. With a moderatly full mouthfeel, crisp carbonation, and peppery finish this beer even feels good to drink. At 9% this beer is no joke, but it hides it so well.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,stewart124,4.87,A straw color with a huge foamy white head and nice lacing left behind. High carbonation present. A very sweet yeasty smell with a nice aroma of fruits. Pear comes to mind. The taste is a sweet tangy blend of fruits. Apricot and pear standout. Floral traces and a extremely sweet sugary taste. Robust spicy flavors and a warming alcohol feel. To say the least this is a very tasty beer and I know what I'll be drinking if armageddon comes around.  Notes: I picked up a bunk 750ml once but haven't had any carbonation problems with the 12oz. bottles.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,xXTequila,4.1,"Cloudy with yeast and golden copper in apperance. Sugar, yeast and fruit in the aroma. Sweet sugar, appricotts and light caramel in the flavor. This is a great beer.

22,34,jed,4.3,"Presentation: Comes in a dark brown, 33 cl bottle with a foil top with the Unibroue logo. The label has description of the beer on the back in French and German, as well as a picture of the recommended serving glassware  a very nice touch. Best before date of 9/4/06. Poured into a chalice.  Appearance: Pours a very hazy, cloudly brown/yellowish color, a dull apricot. Very dark and cloudly, with no light coming through. Nice one finger white head with amazing head retention. Very thick, uneven crown of lacing around the sides of the glass.  Smell: Amazing yeast aroma with hints of sweet citrus, orange peel or tangerine. Sweetness is balanced by spicy aromas of cloves, corriander, pepper.  Taste: Nice, smooth citrus nose blended with cloves and corriander. Alcohol is well concealed and not evident in the taste, but there's still a warming effect. Until the beer warms or sits for awhile, a little heavy on the carbonation for my tastes. The flavor is hugely complex, with a hint of apricot and a little bit of a strange, but not unpleasant vegetable flavor (a reviewer of the standard version likened it celery). The finish is fairly dry, with a little bit of hops. Near the end it becomes sweeter, with some simpler apple flavors and a sweet fruit aftertaste. Awesome.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth mouthfeel. The carbonation is initially a little too high, but it settles down about halfway through.  Drinkability: Due to the very high alcohol content, this one isn't a session beer. Obviously. But it's a great one to sip slowly and savor.  I haven't tried many Belgians (or Belgian beers produced by Canadian companies and exported to France, as it were), but this is the best of the bunch so far. Reminds me of a more complex, better balanced version of Chimay Blue. I enjoyed it in France and I'll be buying more once I'm back in the US.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,vwahaszee,4.63,"Cloudy yellow color with a head that stays for a while, and leaves a lacing. Smells fruity, with some spice as well. The fruit seems like an apple smell. The taste is like the smell, some apple there, as well as a caramel flavor. This is well complemented by a sharp cheese. The mouthfeel is excellent, just the right amount of carbonation. Despite being 9% La Fin Du Monde is easy to drink, and I am usually not satisfied with only one. This is one of my favorite beers.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,twilight,4.23,"Pours a beautiful golden cloudy color with a thick head that gives way to a thin head that lasts throughout the pour. The scent is alcoholic with a marked fruit aroma. The taste is liek a drier tripel. Subtle grassy notes, light sweetness with a crisp and slightly bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good, very carbonated but appropriate for the brew. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, as though it has very little residual sugars, but I love how it nips at the front part of my tongue and leaves it slightly sour. Love this stuff.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,cerevisiaephilus,4.55,"Really one of my favorite Trippels out there. Very nice head, appropriate carbonation for the style, also appropriate light color.

22,34,AndIWantYou,3.06,"I'm new at ""experiencing"" beer, so forgive the lack of very specific flavor/aroma commentary.  Poured in the glass, this created a nice looking white head over a cloudy golden body. Very attractive, even though I'm not drinking it from the prescribed glass shown on the bottle. The head persisted as a sort of ""cap"" over the beer for the better part of my drinking it.  Goes down so easy that I'm in shock that it's a 9% beer. I've had ""malternatives"" that tasted more like alcohol than this! Amazing. While the style is not my first choice for a beer, I'd been told that I really needed to try something from Unibroue and this one was it. Almost enough to make me enjoy pale ales, actually. I taste coriander and a lot of other, complex flavors that I am too n00b to identify. As for aromas, just a very pleasant yeast smell.  I think I've said enough for someone who has very little in the way of insight to share.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Carbonation is right on, too - smallish bubbles just keep on coming, even after letting it sit a while. Wonderful nose of Belgian yeast, orange peel, herbal spice, and a whiff of alcohol. Even better on the palate - more orange peel, lemon, yeast, confectioner's sugar, hint of coriander. Frothy mouthfeel. Finishes mild, sweet, and dry. A beautiful beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,blitheringidiot,4.44,"Minor problem with good brews like LFDM? Lack of drinkability at 9% ABV, but that doesn't kill the love. Neverending, tiny champagne bubbles rise to a solid head that ain't goin' nowhere. Surprisingly light color in the gaze.  Scents of awl-kee-hol get up in my nose. Did I mention the never ending bubbles? I did? A little extra bubbly texture going down the hatch. Easy flavor of raisins and straight up balance guide this brew as a well put together strong yeasty blend. Hmmm, this is complex. Sometimes a beer is one or the other. Can't decide if it's an ale, or Belgian, but it matters not. This is both. Mmm, mmm. This deserves a better than average on all acounts. The scary thing is, I take back my first sentence. I actually could drink these all night. Do me a favor and wake me up in the morning.  Last swigs: Delicious, like dessert. Champagne like feel to the tongue. Sweet but not too sweet - reminds me of Cananda Dry a bit. The flavor summons so many nuances. Complex: Celery, apricots, peaches, ginger ale: yeah, it's that good.  La Cost du Wallet? $52 US dollars a case of Unibroue mixed 3x8 for this Maple Leaf Country yummy. High - maybe but this is a standard entry for good strong stuff. I'm still drinking it.

The smooth taste is sweet with the aforementioned citrus, pepper and spice characteristics perfectly balanced.  This is a crisp easy drinking beer with a strong bite of carbonation. This is a very refreshing and exciting beer to consume. No real strong alcohol presence in the mouth, although there is some warming from the 9% ABV.

22,34,Quaffer,3.88,"Appearance: This beer had the color of honey as it sat in the tulip glass. When it was held up to the light, it was a hazy, pale yellow. The head rose up big, almost exploding when I roughened up the pour, even a little bit. It was stark white and fairly coarse. It became a little rocky as it dissipated (which it did rather quickly), but not as much as its true Belgian cousins usually do. A thin layer of bubbles remained capping the liquid for the entire drink, due to the fairly strong bead.  Smell: The aromas of spice and alcohol dominated the air above this beer. The alcohol component was very round and pleasant. Not at all harsh like other light beers with this high of an alcohol content. Along with the aforementioned aromas was a fruitiness (mainly banana, lemon, and orange) as well as notes of raw grains and grass.  Mouthfeel: Light- to medium-bodied with a very smooth feel up in the front of the mouth. As it slid back on the tounge, it picked up just the right amount of carbonation tickle. The alcohol also contributed to some of the tingle in the back of the mouth.  Taste: There were a ton of different flavors going on in this brew, though for the most part, they were rather subdued. The very first flavors upfront were those of sweet grasses and malt. These were quickly joined by a sharp spiciness that was reminiscent of both cloves and white pepper. Some apple kicked in at this time as well, which ended up developing into a banana sweetness as it continued into the finish. The finish became a combination of both dry and slightly sour. Almost tannic, but in a good way. There was some alcohol in the aftertaste, but not very much; this beer did a great job of hiding that 9% abv.  There was a good amount of yeast on the finish of this brew, even when decanted off the dregs. But toward the end of my drink, I swirled the bottle and added all the ""good stuff"" to the glass. This caused the aroma to be completely dominated by yeast, but had a surprisingly small effect on the taste. The flavor softened up a bit, and there was a little more yeast on the finish, but that was all.  This is my first time with this beer, and only the second that I have tried from Unibroue. (They don't distribute to Kansas, surprise, surprise). A very good, very solid beer. I was surprised that some of its characteristics came across as being almost wheat-like in nature.  This brew goes down way too easily for a beer of this strength. This one could jump up and bite you in a hurry.  A big thanks to noclueaboutbeer for hauling this one out to Kansas all the way from Connecticut.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,WaltTrombone,4.13,"This beer pours honey-gold, white a white head. Aromas of honey, clove, citrus. The tastes are clove, peach, orange peel, honey, lemon, pepper. The mouthfeel is smooth, slightly syrupy. It finishes with clove, lemon, and orange peel, followed by alcohol warming.  This has been one of my favorites for a while, but the last time I cracked open a bottle, it was flat. An email to Unibroue got the answer that they were having cork problems, and that their distributors would replace defective bottles. When I mentioned this at my local beer store, they gave me a new bottle, gratis!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,garymuchow,4.6,"Dated best before 04-08-06 Boy, is this an exceptional beer. Wonder why it took me so long to get here. Presents with a sweet, yet light, sugary, fresh and slightly alcohol aroma. Very nice. Quite pale yellow to slightly gold color, but white fizzy head. Cloudy. A pleasing effervesent quality up front that smooths quickly to a light pale malt flavor. I served it warm, which I believe helped soften any sharpness. Lightly fruity with a little lemon quality at the end. Real smooth and warm in the stomach. Finely carbonated makes it tingly, but not overwhelmingly so. Smoother and less biting than others of similar style that I've had. I like the contrast of light color and light feel with a bold presence and strong alcohol. A very enjoyable beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,euskera,4.4,"12 oz bottle into a Piraat tulip glass... Pours out a cloudy orange-yellow with a nice fluffy head that's fairly well retained. Smell is malty and sweet with some spice and banana.

Vive la Quebec!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,RootedFool,4.7,"12 ounce bottle purchased at the North Coast Co-op in Arcata, California.  Pours deep yellow, very cloudy with carbonation bubbles ascending steadily. Big, sudsy inch-thick head that's leaving a creamy band of lace around the glass.  Smell:  Opens with peppery notes. Sweet malts follow, leading into lemon rinds, fried bananas in caramel sauce, and fresh bread.  Taste:  Malts blanket the tongue. Alcohol and spiciness -- gentle hops and citrus -- crowd in and find their place. Aftertaste is of hops and lingering alcohol sharpness, warming my throat and stomach. Wow, that spiciness, I feel it behind my nose, pleasantly, like wasabi without the wasabi, just the tingling warmth in the sinuses.  Mouthfeel is perfectly creamy, rich, holds up like it should under the weight of so many loud flavors.  This is a beer to be taken seriously -- confident and dead-on delicious.  La Fin Du Monde, translated into English means End Of The World -- according to my roommate who studies French. The name, audacious as it is, along with the apocalyptic label graphic, fits this beer like a perfect pair of devil horns.  If the world were ending and I had to choose a handful of beers to die with, I would definitely consider this one. It's the best of the pale Belgians I've tried so far.  High ABV is why I'm scoring taste and drinkability with a 4.5.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,barleysangel,4.33,"The color is a golden-honey with white spongy-looking head that bubbles. It smells yeasty with a hint of cloves. It tastes spicy and it has an orange peel flavor. There is more carbonation than your standard beer, but it is very light and easy to swallow for a highly carbonated beer. Aftertaste leaves an alcohol flavor in your mouth. This beer is very good in my book. It goes down easy.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,GreenWBush,4.22,"Time to give Unibroue a fair review. My first beer from them was a Maudite, consumed straight from the bottle after a night of micro-drinking. Completely unobjective. This one gets my full attention.  This one comes to me in a 12-oz bottle, with an expiry date in the far-off future. It has an interestingly light straw color, with twinges of hazy-bronze when held to the light. It has a nice large head that settles down to about a quarter of an inch. No lacing to speak of, blame that on heavy-handed dishwashing.  The smell is classic Belgian strong pale ale. I am overwhelmed at first taste: there is so much going on here it is hard to pick out individual flavors. Very much like a smoother-on-the-palate Duvel. A beautiful blend of sugar, alcohol, grain, and effervescence. I'll have this one again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,CarolinaCardinals,4.38,"To date the best in the lot of the Beers of the World gift pack received for Christmas. This golden brew poured a generous fluffy white head that is lacing nicely down the side of my pint. Initially this had a bread like smell that was soon taken over by the spices and fruits that are in this beer. My first taste (not to mention the subsequent sips) was heavenly, an awesome piece of brewing that blends together a highly carbonated combination of malts, hops, fruits, and spices. The mouthfeel is wonderfully full. This beer is one I will seek out in the near future!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,HiroProtagonist,4.5,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Tripel Karmeliet glass, with an everlasting medium-sized fizzy white head forming, which left behind thick lacing when the glass was tilted. The beer was a pale golden color, and cloudy, with a snowstorm of particulates swirling around driven by large fiz bubbles. After a few minutes, the fizzy head became much finer in texture, and remained voluminous. The nose was lovely, with juicy nectarine, dry yeast, coriander, subtler citrus aromatics and the slightest hint of alcohol. The taste was assertive and delicious, wtih a somewhat tart dry malt backbone, and an up-front sensation of coriander. This was followed by ample flavors of bitter orange , leading into lemony citrus, finishing dry with an appropriate bitterenss, lingering coriander, and refreshing zippy citrus. All flavors were balanced masterfully. The beer had a very satisfying body, with a good level of carbonation. This was a highly enojyable beer that I will certainly buy again. Unibroue knows how to whip-up a good Belgian.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Crosling,3.88,"Pours beautifully. The color is an enchanting rustic yellow with a fair amount of sediment drenching the bottom and clinging to the sides of the glass. Frothy and dense head (It took turns) that laced better than well.  Spicy clove like aroma with some banana, yeast, nectarines and alcohol. Quite the odd combination.  Tastes good. Champagne like body. Peppery clove, spices and green melon. Very smooth and it represents itself very well ine mouth. Delicate but throughout. Nice.  Nice stuff.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,RockyTopHeel,4.97,"Tasted 1/16/04 at our little Extravaganza Belgique.  Ok, so our final tasting wasn't truly Belgian, but it's so good and I had one ready to drink, so we figured, why not?  Alluring orange-yellow with a pure white head and a brown drop of yeast shaken from bottle's bottom. Soft, bready aroma, almost like an orange scone. Flavor is full of the yeast, with bright citrus fruit and a beautifully crisp finish. Amazingly smooth in the mouth, with no evidence that this brew hides a potent 9% ABV. Crisp and easy drinking. Orange, lemon, spices, yeast, wheat--wonderful.  This became my new all-time favorite the first time I tasted it, and drinking it again makes me pretty happy all over again.  Spoils of the 10/11/03 Knoxville Raid.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Foxman,4.42,"It pours a hazy, light honey golden hue, alluring in its veiled nature. There's a rather thin white head with little retention, settling quickly to a bubbly cosmic swirl on the beer's surface. There's sparse, dotty lacing.  The initial inhale brings a tangy citrus semi-sweetness. Berry notes mingle with a clovey spiciness. There's an aromatic backbone of yeasty sourness with a very subtle mint undercurrent. It carries an almost indistinct alcohol aroma as well.  The first taste delivers a very understated malt sweetness that quickly gives way to spicy grapefruit, studded with cloves. A substantial dry hoppiness tingles across the tongue. A slight berry sweetness tangles playfully with a mildly doughy yeast essence. The alcohol is well interspersed with the dense, multi-dimensional flavor, but it is detectable, and is happily foreboding.  It's medium bodied, slick, and almost creamy. It coats well and brings flavor to all it touches. There's a spicy hops glow at the finish.  Nothing about this beer is less than interesting, and everything is well more than just enjoyable. This beer, you savor. The flavor relegates the malt to second status, but it still manages to assert itself enough to joyfully balance the menagerie of buoyant tasty waves born elsewhere. The muscular but subtle high ABV serves to enchant, making it pleasantly subversive. It's a wonderful taste of Belgium via Canada, a most fortuitous and satisfying route of delivery. Keep this one coming.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,Beersignal,4.26,"Had this beer last Saturday night at a dinner party. Pulled it from my cellar after a moderate 4 years of aging. Poured same colour as usual, that is deep straw, with a respectable foam cap and average retention. Smelled much sweeter than a fresh sample but still had the spicyness I have come to enjoy. Mouthfeel was silky bordering on oily and very pleasing. The flavours had really melded together, adding complexity to the sampling and making the beer a real pleasure to drink. Caramel, and vanilla jostled with the fruit and spice, eventually coming up short against a mild but sustained bitterness. Well worth the wait. Wonder what an older bottle might yield.  750ml bottle sealed with a cork.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bigbubba,4.2,"This is a beautiful milky orange beer with lots of head initially and lots of carbonation. The taste is very spicy, yeasty, and fruity. No evident hop aroma or taste. It is definitely one to drink slowly due to the carbonation and alcohol content. As the beer warms the flavor slowly changes as some flavors come to the forefront and others fade away. Very enjoyable!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JackTheRipper,4.15,"Pours a slightly cloudy golden yellow with a really large head, not a whole lot of lacing on the glass, but being a noob I think it may be the glass and not the beer (I wonder if I'm caring for the glasses properly?) This is the first time I've had a beer with a noticeable amount of yeast still in the bottle so that freaked me out a bit, but watching the carbonation make the yeast sort of dance around in the glass, I got to liking that aspect.  Smell is a spicy banana scent, couldn't really smell any alcohol in the nose.  Taste: wow, this is a heck of a beer. Seems a bit more malty than hoppy, which I like, I'm still developing my taste for those grapefruity hoppy beers, but I'm working on it. This beer was fruity, the alcohol was more subdued than I thought it would be, considering the ABV, but it warmed the throat nicely on the way down.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, but a little more carbonation than I would like to see.  Drinkability: This is going to be one of those special occasion beers for me, I really like this beer, but I can't see myself drinking it on a very regular basis.  Overall: A very good beer, and one I would definitely recommend to a good friend.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,benmiliron,4.76,"Oh hell yes. Wife got me a 3-pack of Unibroue in a wooden case for Xmas. Fin du Monde was my first choice. Kind of a fruity Belgian, with gorgeous fragrance, beautiful sweetness with a good dose of yeastiness and malt. Just fantastic. Nice small bubbles after the initial froth subsides. Kind of a mediocre hazy yellow with no real head, but I don't really care too much about appearance so long as the beer is good, and this stuff is wonderful.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Drinkability: Being as I've already had quite a few and looking forward to having more, I would say this is definantly very drinkable.  Notes: Borderline typical tripel but with a lot more spicy, clovey tastes. Fantastic overall.  Rest assured I will give this another non-inebriated review later on.

22,34,beernbbq,4.5,Wonderful stuff. Pours the beautiful hazy yellow with a sweet almost banana aroma. Pils malts and saaz hops marry with a fruity flavor.

Taste: Sweet grainy/malty sweetness with citrus and sweet fruits to start, fizzy but still rich at the top, dries with yeasty/citrus acidity, hop spiciness and even some banana in the aftertaste. All very clean and balanced. Alcohol level lies in wait and springs on you at the end. Mouthfeel: Medium-full bodied malt, delightfully tingly carbonation, yeast/citrus pucker.

22,34,bditty187,4.43,"Pale peachy hue with honey highlights, hazy, some animation is noticeable, the white head was smaller than I expected; maybe a finger in height and the retention was passable. A loose cap remains throughout the consumption. The lacing is sub-par. The nose is fruity: mangos, passion fruit, and kiwi. Pepper and clove undercurrents. Alcohol hints at the back. The mustiness is noticeable throughout. The potency is modest. I was expecting more but what the nose needed the palate had and then some. The taste was splendid; simply divine with a glimpse of mango and pear fruitiness upfront that is very quickly overwhelmed by spicy alcohol, pepper, cloves, and surprisingly strong yeastiness. Some candied sugar sweetness but it cannot overcome the finish, which is tart (a green apple influence), spicy and peppery as well but with a blend of malty-bread too. The alcohol is very naked and taunting, maybe a little too much so, if it was softer the complexities would not be as drowned out. The palate is very tasty nevertheless. I detect cloves and apples in the aftertaste with a sharp peppery kick on the tongue, interesting! The body is medium with high carbonation, appropriate, very cleansing and refreshing, which is hard to do with such a high abv. Nicely dry as well. La Fin Du Mode is supremely drinkable and quite a pleasant quaff. It has been well worth the wait I scored a 750 ml of this dandy in Kansas City. Obliviously it is recommended but I might be the last person on earth to try it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Clean and crisp in the mouth with plenty of carbonation to fizzle your tongue. Alcohol is barely noticeable. Caramel malt taste becomes evident halfway through the experience, and the hops appear about the same time to balance the predominant fruitiness. Excellent drinkability here, and really no faults. Fortunately, several Unibroue offerings are available at the Liquor Barn stores in Lexington, Ky, so I'm just a 2.5 hour drive away from sampling more of these fine Unibroue products.

Unfortunately, I still don't think my critical palate is sharp enough to do this beer justice. Anyway...  Pours a hazy pale gold with a rich snowy white head. Very lacy. Smells like spicy sour apples. Yeasty and fruity.  Taste is heavenly. Frtuity apple in the body underpinned by sweet spicy flavors. Sour malt and yeast to finish. Smooth. And then very slowly, very subtly, the beer shifts into another gear and that dull alcohol warming comes through in the aftertaste. It's a thing of beauty.  This is a gorgeous beer.

This yeast sediment, like other Belgians and Belgian-styles, attributes significant flavor profiles that would not be present if either the beer was to be filtered in the brewing process or not decanted into the goblet as to freely distribute the sediment. I believe this beer is more enjoyable with the yeast thoroughly mixed with the beer. It is rather spicy in the nose (Unibroue tends to use many different spices and keeps those recipe formulas under wraps; I know this from talking to one of the brewers at a beer festival I was working at), with evidence of a healthy dosage of candi sugar and some subtle hops (most likely indigenous to North America). Initially sweet and the intricate smorgasboard of spices come through. Finishes drier yet the spice aspect of the beer still lingers.

This is smooth and delicious and get's the job done. Don't get me wrong here, the smell is quite hoppy but the taste has been subdued nicely. Very Good.  Surprisingly, I taste a bit of malt here.

I have had equal quality beers but I don't know that I've had better. It explodes with flavor in the mouth and has that pale ale dryness to it, but this is much more than a pale ale.

The taste is a delightful blend of fruitiness and champagne like flavors, with a spiciness that balanced well with the lighter aspects of the beer. The high level of alcohol is detected at the end of the sip, betrayed by its warming. I can't really recomend this as a session beer, unless you find the idea of the local authorities pulling you out of the sewer in a comatose condition appealing to you. That, and the beer is surprisingly heavy for its appearance and taste. Still, it is a magnificent beer. Tis is just more proof that a trip to Quebec is in order.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The nose is of wonderful malts that jump right up at you and you can smell the sweetness before you even taste the end of the world. You can, at times taste the alcohol - but in a refreshing way not a let's-get-buzzed way. Nice mouthfeel. A bit of a surprise 'cause you expect some heaviness after all the nose and initial contact. But no. It is almost like a cream ale - almost. I goes down smooth with more surprises. A sense of sweet hops, and freshly picked apples in the aftertaste - almost like crab apples. I don't normally, like a fruity taste but I do here! A wonderful beer. End of the world, huh? Must be one of the beers of heaven.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BeefyMee,2.56,"This beer poured majestically with a great looking head that retained almost the whole way down the glass. It smelled like something similar to a Hoegaarden white and tasted very much like one at first. The taste soon gave way to alcohol as the beer started kicking my ass. This brew can really put some hair on your chest (ladies beware). After finishing two thirds of the glass, the alcohol taste dissipated, but it still had the aftertaste of a white beer.

This 9% ABV offering from Unibroue distinguishes itself from its comrades (Trois pistoles and La Maudite) in that it is a thinner more tart traditional Belgian strong beers (is this an ale???). It also has less of the ""warming"" effect to it than these other heftier Unibroue beers. Pours a slightly cloudy light gold color ( careful to keep the chunky lees in the dregs of the bottle and not your glass on this one).  Aromas of spices, sweet malts and a peppery twang. Starts like a light beer then sits on the palate with a medium body punctuated with spices and a honey sweet taste...the effervescence helps punch the hop tang trough then the finish is fairly clean and smooth for a heavy beer with only a lingering pepper taste mingled with the alcohol warmth,  I like this as a drinkable heavy beer.

A slow forming small head. Decent lacing. The scents are champagne with a bubbly feel on the nose. Sweet and sour fruit like pares, nectarines and even some apple. Some grass, grain and hop scents for a nice finish to the scents.  Flavors present them self in both a bold fashion with a smooth finish. Malts start us off. Again the fruits are strong. Definately some sour apple. There is a fine nectarine and even some mango after this. A peppery spice is nice with a glancing of hops. Then there is a nice milk flavor to smooth this ale out. As it warmed I picked up some faint grape flavors. The alcohol is present but only after all the flavors are happily swallowed. Excellently balanced.  Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. It has a nice present itself quality. The only pinch is with the alcohol when swallowing the ale. It leaves a great warming quality. It is fresh on the palate and is a great sipping ale. This one will take some time. I am glad I waited to try this ale. It was worth the wait.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,smitty1080,4.15,"One of my first dips in to the big bottles. Pours a goregous gold with crisp white head. There is slight carbonation bubbling up the sides. The aroma had apples, bannanas, and yeast qualties. The taste brought along the yeast and fruity bite. Absolutly silky mouthfeel is a very nice touch to this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,beerguy101,4.3,"Light gold color. Small head. Aroma is yeasty, fruity and citrusy. A medium bodied Belgian tripel. Fruity, bright, yeasty and spicy, all the things an Abbey Triple should be. Complex flavors are intermingling here. Apples, oranges and peaches mix with coriander, cloves and allspice (?) to make a very pleasant tasting beer. Add its extremely fine champagne like carbonation and this beer is a real winner. Very smooth. The 9% alcohol is hidden fairly well. It does peak out occasionally, as every once in a while there is a touch of alcohol bite and it is a real belly warmer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Dogbrick,3.57,"This beer is a hazy yellow color with a medium thick white head. Not very much head retention, and thin lacing. Aroma is yeasty and spicy.

This is a pretty good Tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,SetarconeX,4.18,"What in interesting little brew we have here. Lovely cloudy golden color. Look sort of like a good hefe, only without as much stuff floating in it. The smell is something unique, a sort of stong normal pale ale smell, with odd pungancies and astringencies behind it. The taste is somewhere between pale ale and fruit punch. Complicated, and interesting. A good reccomendation.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,alexgash,4.28,"What an intimidating beer. In fact, I have to admit that most Unibroue brews are intimidating (even ephemere). But mama likes. Scrounged up this bottle at the Utah State Liquor store in Park City--definitely the best beer selection in Utah. This fine offering poured a very hazy, tawny/orange, with a voluptuous white head. The Unibroue yeast is obvious in the smell, along with sweet banana bread, and slightly medicinal alcohol. Taste is wow. Sweet candy malts, with notes of pears, and plenty of yeasty goodness. Wheat-bitter finish. Very warming. I wish I had a 750 though...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Stingray5,3.62,"750ml bottle pours a cloudy burnt yellow, foamy white head. Endless tiny cabonation bubbles rise from the depths. Aroma is strong and quite sweet, fruit and candy. OK mouthful with high carbonation, slightly too much for me. Taste is sweet fruity goodness with some nice toasty malt and whisky-like sourness in the finish. Yes, we have bananas. Sticky, dry puckering sensation lasts. A bit too much lasting sourness on the front of the tongue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,OldFrothingSlosh,4.53,"Presentation: 12oz. foil-capped bottle with a best by date of 4-17-06.  Appearance: Poured an absolutely wonderful cloudy blond color with a huge and creamy-smooth white head that refuses to back down. All sorts of sticky lace coats the glass. Truly beautiful.  Smell: In a nutshell...complex. Ripe bannanas, pepper, orange peel, a little bit of alcohol, and some pepper..  Taste: A ""yeasty"" flavor emerges first. Lots of fruity flavors as well. Warming effect from the alcohol peeks through. Finishes with an almost ""wheat-like"" flavor. Nice dose of slight bittering at the end. Finishes very clean with almost no aftertaste. Complex and excellent.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Super smooth. Medium...almost high levels of carbonation. Very easy on the palate. Drinkability is way up there. Such a complex flavor profile as it crosses the palate. Wonderful in every aspect. Another winner from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Elemental,4.28,"Extremely light hazy color with a centimeters worth of head. Beutifully colored and a lot lighter than I expected. Good aroma but has an alomost rubbery smell which appears in the taste but not in a bad way. Aroma is light and wheaty. The taste is light, wheaty and incredible mellow for such a strong beer. The alcohol was almost none existant. Not very bitter and lightly spiced. Overall a great beer with a good balance of aroma and taste.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,moulefrite,4.6,"Appearance all plosive, puffy and proud with a pinpoint prickly persona. Damn good brew! Pours yellow yet hazy and a touch golden. Champagne like carbonation with bubbles actively heading towards the beer's surface. Good headage that keeps puffing with swirling. Aromatics include tropical fruit, creme caramel and pecan pie. A wonderfully complex brew that hints of exotic fruits, anise, and ripe melon. In the mouth a nice interplay between sweet and bitter. Very warming indeed, with a touch of anteseptic!! One may be all I need, but this drinkability here is high as this beer simply rocks. It is sooo damn good! Practicably pornographic!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,steelreign,4.7,"What's this? A Belgian strong ale made in Quebec?? Yes, that's right, and what an amazing brew. Dense off white head that seems to stick to the glass with ease. Aroma of spices, yeast, malt, alcohol and fruity esters. Wonderful!  Oh man, the stuff just flows in your mouth and the dried aged fruity tastes and malt explode across your palette! Tingly bubbly feel and slight hop to balance the big bold taste out nicely. A bigger beer in this style would be hard to attain. The alcohol is barely noticed until either it warms sufficiently or you try to stand up. Well done! Another winner from Unibroue, eh?",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,byrd,3.97,"Beer poured with a small bubbly head that slowly dissipated to lace that was perpetuated by the carbonation cascading from the sides of the glass. Nice cloudy, light golden hue. Particles of yeast could be seen floating around the glass. Sweet, fruity malt aroma with notes of banana and yeast. Some slight alcohol was also apparent on the nose with a touch of hops. Carbonation hits the tongue first leading to a very fluffy mouthfeel. Nice combination of yeast, fruits and spices. Theres a slight alcohol warming sensation throughout the glass, but its never overbearing. Sweetness is well balance by mild hop bitterness and never becomes cloying. Finish is slightly bitter, but aftertaste is primarily a lingering of the spices. Quite a drinkable beer for the ABV level. Got to be careful with this one or there could be trouble!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,PhantomVodoo,4,"Brownish straw color with a voluminous white head. Bitey aroma of clove, yeast, alcohol, and banana.  Taste is crisp and bitey. Lots of spice in the tart flavor. Clove and alcohol have a strong presence. The beer doesn't support this high of an ABV IMHO. Malt and hops take a backseat to everything else going on in this beer.  Lots of carbonation in the mouthfeel. Drinkability is good despite the high ABV.  Overall, a good beer, but definitely not my favorite Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,daledeee,4.85,"Pours cloudy yellow. smells fruity and yeasty.Nice one inch white head and holds it's lace well. Fruity tasting with bubbly champagne like carbonation. Tart fruit, possibly pears along with bread. I like beer that is bubbly. Not much malt or hops up front. Alchohol is also well hidden. I cannot pick out what the finish on the back of my tongue is. I must say in this category there is some very strong competition, but it is hard to find a better tripel. This is one fine beer and a dangerous beer. Way too drinkable!! The key is proper storage, since our system is run by the state storage must be proper since it makes different batches taste differently.  Note: As I drink this beer more, I like it more. I am raising it's rating.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,WesWes,4.15,"The beer pours a cloudy light golden color with a 1/4"" frothy white head. The aroma is quite fruity. There are spicey accents with a hint of cloves. The taste is refreshing. Again, the spices are present. This a light beer that really goes down smooth. There is excellant carbonation and a low body. This is a great sessions beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Andreji,4.18,"Came into this with very, very high expectations. Wasn't disappointed at all.  Pours a cloudy and opaque gold/tan tone which seems very pale and has rather a medium fizzy white head that fades and leaves a small coating on the beer with little lacing behind.  The smell, a little hard to define. At first appeared even fishy but then releases excellent aromas of wheat and malts, somewhat sweet and strong smell. nice, not that great.  The taste is truly exceptional. Very wheaty with a slight feel of lemon which complements it beautifully and helps to harmoniously hide its elevated ABV, only felt slightly at the end mixed with the delicious slight hoppy compliment to the taste.  Wow, an exceptional brew that can fool you if you drink too many (and attack your pocket). Worth its place on the list.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,RoyalT,4.5,"Appearance  Absolute monster head. The bottle foamed over when I popped the top even though it had been sitting quietly in my fridge for a week. The body is an extremely cloudy example of deep yellow with a hint of orange.  Smell  This is very interesting. The yeast comes out big in the aroma. It is well complimented by various spices, most notabley clove and garlic. Theres also a pleasing lemon scent.  Taste  This is a real heavy hitter. The lemon flavor comes out a little bit more in the taste. The yeast is big and bountiful. The powdery spices take a back seat but are still present. This is an excellent representation of the style.  Mouthfeel  Big, mouth-filling carbonation with this one.  Drinkability  If you like BSPAs, you have to give this one a try. The Unibroue interpretation of this style is interesting indeed. It went down very well and left me wanting for more (I chinced and bought the 12 oz bottle).  Comments  This one had a real hefeweitzen base, but goes off in its own direction rather quickly. An A for originality if nothing else. A must try for fans of the style.  Update  I reviewed this shortly after joining the site in Aug 03 so decided to re-review it with a 2004 vintage. This really is a great example of a BSPA, and now after having reviewed over 200 Belgian Ales I am really able to appreciate the craftsmanship of this particular ale. Im raising the overall score from 4.3 to 4.5.  Update  The 2005 vintage lacked that explosive head of yesteryear that actually kind of annoyed me but otherwise was just about the same. I really enjoy the unique garlicky character of the aroma. Two thumbs up  a solid 4.5.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,DarrellK,4.35,"Surprisingly mild for a 9% abv brew. Aroma is pleasant but not too strong. Color is quite pale and was a bit cloudy. Head was full with small bubbles that lasted through the finish. Both the mouth and finish a strong characteristic and typical for the style. It is quite polished and very much like a Chimay, and in this case a brew I slighly prefer to the Chimay.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Brian700,3.55,"Sampled from a 750ml bottle. Corked and all. Classy but not a brew for monday night football. I can appreciate this sort of thing but this one just didn't do a whole lot for me.  Pours a nice crisp yellow with a yeasty aroma. Great mouthfeel, but the flavour was a not doing much for the o'l taste buds. I must be fair in that this was the only sample I've had and I did not take note of the ""best by"" date. I should try it again because it really did sound like something that would be right up my alley.  I hope it was just a bad sample, but if not, it really did taste like the End of the World.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,xgrigorix,4.03,"Twelve ounce brown twist cap bottle, with best by date clearly marked on back.  Bright blazing gold, with a blossoming, tight white head. When the yeast is added it goes cloudy, & bright yellow, almost like a wit. The head takes on a much creameir look after the yeast pour.  Bright punchy aroma, sweet & inviting. Its not as punchy after the yeast pour, but an earthy quality is added to the nose.  A rather clean tasting ale. Straight forward malt sweetness, a touch of tart apple like flavours, & some pepper. A dry finish with a subtle but effective hop character. Some solvent flavour lingers. Some earthy / herbal flower qualities are added with the yeast. It also becomes more peppery.  Medium bodied while still being somewhat soft, with pinpoint carbonation.  Quite a nice Belgian strong pale ale. It features a refined sophitication that I enjoyed.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Loki,4.82,"Sampled from a 12oz bottle at Wolfgang Puck Grand Cafe in Lake Buena Vista (aka Orlando), FL with a best before date of 08-06-2006. I think I safely made it before this one went bad, but it was close. JK. Oh and they had the proper glassware for both La Fin Du Monde & Blanche De Chambly.  Poured a hazy, opaque pale yellow-orange with a big, foamy white head. Each sample left streams of lacing all around the glass, but they had some trouble with gravity.  Very fragrant. Roasted malt, yeast, citrus, esters, fruit, and caramel candy all over the nose. There were more scents I couldn't pick out. Very complex, yet very alluring and enticing. The scents could draw you to the end of the world, which is what the name means. (Even says so on the back label.)  The taste is just as complex and enticing as the nose. The pleasure begins with sweet roasted malt and citrus flavors that glide into yeast, dough, and orange savory elements that then dance on your tongue into esters and ever so slight hops for the finish. Medium to medium-full body and a clean finish and transition. A truly wonderful beer and a first rate, top notice contender.  One of the better beers I've had to date. Definitely in the top 20.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Ellbert,4.27,Apperance: A decent appearance. A large white and crisp head forms when poured. This disappates quickly as does with most high alcohol lighter colored beers I had tasted have. Color is a light straw.  Smell: A nice spicy smell. No alcohol in the nose what so ever.  Taste: Sweet and fruity but spicy and bity. A fruity sweetness is first then it goes to the spiciness. After that you can taste an alcohol warming.  Mouthfeel: A nice rich mouthfeel. Much richer than other lighter colored beers I have had.  Drinkability: Very drinkable considering the 9%. I would have another one.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,yen157,3.39,"Very coarse, foamy head. Brownish-yellow and hazy with some chunks that accidentally got poured. Lively, almost painful carbonation cause quite a row in the mouth. Once the beer had sat for 15minutes or so the bubbles because manageable. Spicy yeast give the beer most of its character. Good pale malt presence to spar with the yeast and hops. A good beer, but not one of my favorites from these guys. IMHO its way over-hyped.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ManekiNeko,4.8,"Served cold from a 750 mL bottle with cork and cage. I used a Corsendonk glass as it was the closest in shape to the one pictured on the Unibroue website.  Appearance: Pale golden yellow, cloudy from the yeast. Very strong and fast forming head composed of itty-bitty bubbles. Slight lacing occured as this glorious elixir was consumed.  Smell: Strong smell of pepper and coriander followed by fruity smells, mostly orange and lemon.  Taste: Powerful spicy and fruity flavors (as noted above) giving way to malt with just a titch of hoppy crispness at the end. Lingering glimpses of other fruits like banana and pear danced across my tongue as I pondered another sip. The alcohol can be sensed lurking in the background.  Mouthfeel: Effervescent, crisp and smooth. Not too watery, not too oily.  Drinkability: _Extremely_ drinkable, despite (and maybe in spite of) the alcohol content. I feel sorry I only bought one of these... thank God there's more at the store!!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The smell teases you, letting you know this is not just any beer, this is nectar. Beautiful, full bodied taste. Malty, nice bitter hops, fruity ester dances across your tongue in some sort of mystical ballet. Smooth, heavy mouthfeel that leaves you always wanting more, more, more.

22,34,mikeys01,3.85,"Tried my first Fin today, out of a bomber+ size 25.4 oz corked bottle. The fin du monde pours out frothy as can be, with a very light white head that filled half the glass on a slow pour. No problem, worth the wait for it to settle. Carbonation level is actually pretty moderate, despite all the initial effervescence. Smells both malty and yeasty, reminds me a bit of a hefe at first, then I detect a bit of grape sneaking up from around the corner it seems. First sip is surprisingly light, not quite what I expected. Only a hint of bitterness, then I get a nice warmth surrounded by plenty of citrus orangey flavor, interesting. The cirtrus is very well balanced by the body of the beer and a nice finishing sweetness. The bottle conditioning keeps the carbonation from overpowering the flavor, and lends a nice softness to the texture. I didn't even notice the high alcohol content until I was well into the bottle, you kind of just ease into it like an old la-z-boy recliner. Although not spectacular, I'd call the fin du monde eminently drinkable, and I'll indeed sample it again.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Appearance: pours a hazy gold with a white, six-fingered, macro-bubble head; great retention; heavy -- albeit unprincipled -- lacing.  Aroma: Sweet and spicy; all the usual descriptors apply -- peppery, clove-like, notes of tropical fruit, etc.  Taste: A drier, yeastier version of smell; subtle traces of orange, cinammon and smoke pervade.  Notes: I can't say I'm blown away. Complex, to be sure, but do all the varied notes add up to a ""top twenty"" brew? Mustard was hoping for a bit more ...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ngandhi,4.36,"Pour: Even poured slowly into a 16 oz. goblet, FDM explodes with a three inch head. My thought is that this beer is hell bent on filling whatever size glass you put it in. When the foam mellows, it still leaves a head you'd expect out of most beers on the initial pour. To the last drop, there's a good cm or two of head, not lace, that coats the beer like a white chocolate ganache. Incidentally, when you finish the beer, you'll notice the foam covers the glass from the bottom to up to three inches up!  Nose: Spicy citrus. Green grapes. Green apple skins. Very ripe, natural. Almost mentholated from the alcohol, but not unpleasant. Not too special compared to other Belgian-style beers.  Taste: A medium dry sparkling wine. Pronounced clove. There's a typical grapefruit bitterness that strikes first on the back of the tongue, but it isn't too strong. The sides of the tongue are also activated nicely if you swish the beer around and lend a flavor of orange rinds or even a light orange sherbert. The high alcohol offers its own taste that works with the beer as, itself, a FLAVOR and not a harsh reminder of what's inside. Light smoke. Indeed, the sweet and sour of the citrus balance the 9% abv and make this beer very drinkable. A sweeter saison?  Mouthfeel: Creamy because of the bottle-conditioning. Again, FDM uses every charactertistic for a higher goal. Hacker-Pschorr and other weiss beers are ""creamy"" because of the yeast in the bottle, but that body often seems like a nice perk. The body here is part and parcel of the beer, working with the citrus to produce a delicately medium bodied, sherbert or a lightly carbonated champagne.  Drinkability: The creamy body encourages you to swirl this beer around. It wants to romance the sides and back of your tongue. The hoppy/alcohol finish does remind you what you are dealing with and to proceed with caution.  Notes: On many sips, I've had this beer hit the back of my tongue and then swallowed. If it doesn't touch the sides, this beer might only be mediocre. Let your tongue swim in it, if only briefly. The molecules have to be seperated to adequately soften the phenols. The alcohol does balance well, but there could be, perhaps, one more element to this beer with another hop or the alcohol being subdued just a little more. I'll be trying to wrap my finger around this for years to come. An expert job to make, and perhaps to understand.  Relax, relax. ng",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

I really thought it was the end of the world when I first tried this 10 years ago as a young'un and drank it straight from a 750 ml bottle at a house party--took me 4 hours of intestinal fortitude to finish that bad boy off.  However times have changed, I've grown older, if not any more wiser, and have learned to enjoy many more of these over the years. It POURS from this particular 750 ml brown bottle a hazy pale straw colour with good carbonation and some suspended particles. Big white bubbly head that lasts a while. Aroma of hay, apricots, pepper, some grassy notes. Flavour doesn't hit me until the finish and then the aftertaste where the sweet malt and spices start to kick in, plus a little bit of citrus. A lot going on in the palate of this ale. Mouthfeel is thick and somewhat boozy, but to be expected for the 9% abv, yet goes down a lot smoother than most ales of this caliber.  Back in the day I used to jokingly refer to this stuff as a bowl of cereal in a bottle.

Flavor is a bit of yeast, then warm honey melts in the mouth, and finishes with some undertones of butterscotch and pine. Mouthfeel is very smooth and velvety.

Lots of full tanic fruit flavors. Grapes and even maybe some tart apples. Not overly bitter, but it did have some hop bitterness that sat nicely in the mix.  Although smooth going down it finished with a firm bump of spice and bitterness. Still never over the top. But definitely a little bit of increase in flavors near the end.

The alcohol and pepperness in the beer was just not balanced by anything else. It did have some good, rich malts and first rate bitterness. Overall a good brew, but I am not yet sold on them.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,longpondbeerman,3.35,"I admit it. Pale ales are not my thing, especially those with really high alcohol content. This was no exception. It poured a cloudy yellow with a fuzzy white head. There was lots of spiciness in the smell, particularly ginger and arrowroot. Not much in the taste to mask the alcohol either, so I thought I was drinking a sloe gin fizz.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,DESTRO,4.25,"Man i just discovered this not to long ago (hey im new to this) and...wow. It pours a cloudy yellow with not much head and little peices of sediment floating about, and what head it has quickly diminishes to nothing. looking at it as it sits in my glass it reminds me of a hefe minus the big white biscuit head. the aroma is of light spices and clove and is quite pleasant. the taste makes me think wheat with a bit of citrus and clove. Man I love the wheat taste. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing with good carbonation that just seems to bubble on your toungue, just a little bit of creaminess that kind of coats your mouth finishes it off. The drinkability of this is amazing and a 4 pack or 2 750ml bottles can be finished off no problem. the only thing is, this brew is 9% and it creeps up on you pretty quickly. After work (construction) in the hot Las Vegas sun I love to come home, pour a glass of this and sit on the porch. It is a most refreshing, relaxing, not to heavy brew. A truly wonderful beer.  $5.99 for 750ml or $7.99 per 4 pack.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Darkale,4.3,"Yeasty and slightly spicy aroma. Bright white head fades quickly to a skim, and the lacing is moderate. Body of the beer is cloudy and dull bronze.  Taste is a creamy, sparkly, cinnamon spice. Very creamy mouthfeel. High carbonation, brisk and brash even in the middle of all that creaminess. Slightly sour aftertaste. There is spice from beginning of the sip to the end of the swallow, but that spice rides that wonderful, chewy, malty backbone.  Again, marvelous mouthfeel, probably one of the best I've ever enjoyed in that regard.  This is one of my favorite Unibroue's -- indeed, one of my favorite beers, as my numbers attest. If the end of the world is truly coming, make sure you bring one of these.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Garin,4,"La Fin du Monde pours a very pale yellow -- it reminds me of a wheat beer, actually. The clarity is fair, with a bit of haze present but I can still see through it. The head forms readily, and decays to a creamy layer on top of the beer. It's supported by a steady carbonation fizz.  The aroma is malty and fruity, with some yeast and banana. Also, clove spiciness is obvious. It's a clean and fresh-smelling beer.  The flavour is very bright and refreshing. Lots of cloves, banana, and citrus hit me immediately. Some wheaty malt fills the flavour out. The sweetness is balanced by some herbal and bitter hops. There is only a very little alcoholic flavour here (which is dangerous, at 9% :^) so drink at your own peril. The finish is clean and slightly bitter.  In the mouth, it feels full and creamy without being heavy. The carbonation is a nice light interesting fizz. All in all, I think they've made a pretty delightful ale. This is a mighty fine beer, destined to become a regular in my house.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Pegasus,4.32,"Appearance: Cloudy yellow-golden color with a large off-white head which soon fades to a nice collar with good lacing. The carbonation is champagne-like and quite profuse. There is quite a bit of sediment in suspension and on the bottom of the glass.  Aroma: Strong and sweet aroma, again reminiscent of champagne, but also with fruit notes, particularly apples and pears, yeast, bread notes, alcohol, and faint hops.  Taste: Begins with a smooth malt character with spices, notably cloves and pepper. Strong, sweet alcohol is also a strong presence. Later the taste assumes a somewhat vinous quality. Finishes dry with a mild, but lingering floral hop note.  Mouth feel: Smooth and full with lots of carbonation, excellent.  Drinkability/notes: An extraordinary brew, one of stunning quality and devastating strength, to be accorded respect and savored with deliberation. This is a beer of rare quality.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,MJR,4.67,"Appearance: Pours a pale yellow with a touch of haze. A bright white head starts out hefty and loudly fizzles down to a sturdy cap. Lots of bubbles from the heavy carbonation.  Smell: The aroma is subdued with a touch of fruit, a flowery note, and chalky yeast. Great balance between the different scents, as they blend together so well it's a bit hard to pick each one out.  Taste: Overall, the balance swings to the sweeter side, with fruity esters of pear, apple and banana. There's a peppery spiciness that hangs in the forefront. Hint of clove...hint of hops... The yeast brings a chalky, powdery flavor to the table. That same suggestion of a flowery character from the smell is here too. The different flavors are integrated really well, with no one flavor trying to take attention away from the others. A bit of tartness is present, from wheat being in the grain bill. Ends with a slight phenolic note, as well as a touch of alcohol.  Mouthfeel: On the thinner side of medium with a highly carbonated mouthfeel that has a touch of creaminess. Like all of Unibroue's beers, the alcohol is extremely well hidden, only showing itself on the finish with a smooth dryness.  Drinkability: Damn good for it's strength. Not to sound like a broken record, but 'nobody' can hide alcohol like Unibroue. They make a 9%abv brew taste like a 5% brew, with only the aftereffect showing otherwise. Another great brew from Unibroue!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Admiraldinty,4.35,"750 ml. Bomber. Poured a stickey, huge white foam over pale, golden yellow. Lightly fruity, clove-like, yeasty smell. Taste is a little spicey, but mostly sweet with a light fruit (mostly pear) taste. Extremely creamy with a medium to high level of carbonation. Definitely a beer to be respected. I'm paying the price for this one at the moment...drank it way too fast, but one that I'll come back to.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,nomad,4.42,"Poured a hazy yellow-gold color, with lots of streaming little champange carbonation, a pillowy soft head.  Had a big bright nose smelling of a mix of cloves, honey, lemon, and wheat. All were well blended and soft yet spritely in character. To me, smelled like a ginger ale from god. The hops came through with time, though they were greatly tempered by the malt and the yeast.  Taste was sweet yet creamy, with a solid wheat taste that lended a tart edge toward the finish. Mainly tasted of a light but satisfying pale malt. In general, a bit simple tasting but not bad. Had a cotton-soft drying finish that becomes yeasty in length.  A soft mouthfeel but a little fizzy feeling. Very easy to drink; best to sip but enjoyable in a gulp, too. Very tasty just not as complex as some Belgians. Even still, the best triple in the Americas.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,dwarbi,4.6,"Pours a thick, creamy white head. Looks golden yellow, and is cloudy enough that you can't see through it. Smells and tastes of wheat and spices. you can hardly detect the alcohol. Thick, creamy mouthfeel, but somehow it's also very clean and refreshing. *This beer got me into craft brews. Still love it!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Jarod,4.77,"Triple fermented Dated best by 06/06/2005  This beer poured a pale lemony color that was opaque but clear enough that I could make out that it was well carbonated. The head that was produced was thick, creamy and dense  white in color and stood till the last sip where there was a small skim left on top and a ring around the edges. It left behind a creamy sticky lace that was like a sheet being draped on the insides of the glass at the top then broke off into a delicate pattern at the end. The aromas that came from the glass, were of sweet malts and caramel, fruits (pears, apples) flowers, some hops, yeast, spice and a bit of alcohol (but well hidden). The flavors were of sweet and dark malts, caramel, fruits (more pears and dark apples), wood, citrus tones, light hops, spice yeast and alcohol. There was no aftertaste present anywhere on the tongue. The alcohol is big in this beer but you would never notice it unless you read the label, it is well blended all through the nose and pallet. This beer is smooth, creamy and complex, very drinkable, very, very drinkable. Just be careful because with the high alcohol content and its ability to hid amidst the other flavors you will not notice its bigness until you get up.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,GreenCard,4.1,"Sampled a 750 ml bottle, about six months old...  Appearance: a luminescent pale straw color, fair amount of haze (not nice and clear like the original strong golden, Duvel), satiny white and billowous head w/ great retention, lots of bubbles, some lacing  Aroma: pungently floral, slight citrus notes, wisps of alcohol, pear-like esters  Flavor: pear-like sweetness envelopes the pallate initially (and fades slowly), mellow hop flavor and bitterness evens it out as it heads for a semi-dry finish, big flavor, some hints of orange, a bit of coriander-like spiciness (though I don't think they use coriander in this one), honey-like aftertaste, very tasty!  Mouthfeel: the carbonation gives a sharp attack, light body, fluffy texture, crisp finish, fair amount of warming  Drinkability: a bit more alcohol than Duvel (yeah, you can feel that!), drinking this whole bottle got me feeling pretty loopy, but that certainly doesn't hinder the enjoyment.  Unibroue is one of the only non-Belgian breweries that can pull off the Belgian styles. They make some fantastic beers and this is definitely one of them! When tasting a Strong Golden ale, you always have to compare it to Duvel because it was the original and it still holds the title. This one comes pretty close, though.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,stoutman,3.75,"A complex beer. The aroma was lightly floral and yeasty. I detected aged coriander spice in the nose. This brew has a murky golden hue with a large, rocky white head which dissipates. Deliscious and malty, but well balanced. Not sweet. A touch sour with hints of citrus and alcohol. The 9% ABV is fairly well hidden. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Lively carbonation. An acidic tad in the finish, but mostly just a long and dry finish to an excellent belgian style ale. Belgian Trippel fans must try this one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Naerhu,2.9,"appearance - opaque dull gold color with pure white head that disapates.

22,34,marburg,4.72,"Easy like a four dollar prostitu.... Well, you get the idea. This beer, despite it's high abv, is an exceptionally easy-to-drink beer. A lot of times, drinkability is really a summary of the whole package. If it's tasty, it's easier to drink. If it doesn't feel odd, it's easier to drink. If it doesn't smell like Farmer Fred's horse feed trough, it's easier to drink. In this case, the beer's gorgeous nose and layered flavor profile make this beer a treat.  Pours a hazy pale straw color, almost a creamy offwhite. A nice, poppy, white head forms atop the beer. Aromas of fruit -- passion, mango, citrus -- and cloves. Very spicy.  Tastes much the same -- but in layers of flavor. There's a definite pear and tropical fruit flavor upfront that forms a very inviting sweetness. A peppery, tingly clove spice flavor tickles the tongue. And finally, a warming alcoholic mouthfeel washes over the flavors and mutes them a bit as the beer is swallowed. It's astonishingly complex, and it's far and away one of the best beers in the world.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,tavernjef,4.15,"Color a pale, cloudy yellow color with yeast floating around, nice white frothy head leaving clingy, patchy lace. Smells of lemon and tropical fruit, banana, with a hint of spice and sweet bitterness. Taste is more of the same, citrusy and tropically smooth and clean with a spicy lemon dry finish thats warming from the alcohol. Feel is medium body sweet and fruity flavors that dry out, nice, crisp and clean finish with warming qualities from alcohol. Pretty drinkable but is a sipper, 9%, it'll sneak up on you for sure.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Ahhdball,3.72,"I picked this up at my favorite store in Cincinnati (Jungle Jims) along with it's next of kin Don De Dieu (reviewd later) and was pretty impressed. Like a novice I poured this wrong and the sediment came out into the glass, not a HUGE deal but it marred the taste a little. The look was a golden cloudy color with a tiny lace head that took a little time to dissappear. The citrus was strong in the odor and I could swear I tased some grapes. This was sweet, almost like a champagne with a lot of carbonation. Not a bad brew, smooth, almost too smooth. The 9% alchohol factor could definetly not be noticed. All around a nice beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Running4beer,4.5,"At first glance not the best looking beer in the world, but who drinks beer for the looks. I poured this into a snifter and it poured out a hazy gold/straw color with a thick frothy head that took it's time to settle to a thin lace. Right off the bat you get a wiff of yeast and some spiciness, I preferably don't appreciate the smell of yeast(don't know why, I just don't) so I immediately prejudged this brew, to be not good. I couldn't have been more wrong. The taste was awsome it had some yeast, spice and a hint of citrus no alcohol aftertaste at all to this, unlike some of its counterparts. Mouthfeel was smooth and rich. This is an easy to drink beer but if you have more than the four watch out cause the bark isn't as big as the bite(or something like that). I also learned not to prejudge a beer without tasting it, smell or looks may be decieving but until you taste it you never know.  Cheers!!!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Marty,4.82,"A dangerous combination of delicious and strong. This is the most drinkable strong ale I've ever tasted. I would sometime like to sit down and drink three of these in a sitting.  Pours a hazy gold with a good-sized fluffy white head. Smells and tastes amazing; citric, fruity, spicy and yeasty! I'd put a Fin du Monde air freshener in my room if there were such a thing.  Amazingly smooth. This is my favorite in its category, and one of my favorite three beers... ever!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BittRnessabounds,4.5,"This impressive beer pours a hazy dark gold with a very abundant and fluffy head. The head subsided slightly to a wonderful lace and foam that prevented me from every actually seeing the golden color from above. The slight bit of head I got with each taste added a very pleasant creamy flavor. The smell was predominantly spicy and yeasty. I could not easily pick out one flavor that dominated because the interplay of malt and spiciness was too well balanced. All the flavors also made my mouth sing in anticipation for the next sip. Each sip gives only a slight hint of the 9% ABV, which makes this brew dangerously drinkable. All in all this is an incredible beer that goes up there as one of the best I've ever had.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,EmoBeerGuy,4.46,"My buddy Marty just got a case of this stuff after we tried it at a beer convention in Syracuse about a month back. What a treat!  Pours with a very frothy stark white head. Nose is spices, and slight hops, not as strong as you might exspect if you have tasted this beer before.  Taste is outta this world. Very well crafted and balanced beer which has everything you want from spices, hops, and malt with a strong alcohol presence. If somebody wants to know whats so great about the artisinal pale ale style let them try this beer. They'll understand.  My favorite Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The beer is slightly darkish gold, with darker swirls of sediment. Lots of sediment (I'm not careful).  The smell is spicy/sweet, with apples. The front is citrusy, spicy. Apples return in the middle along with the first hint that this is a relatively high-alcohol beer. The finish is crisp, clean, nice fresh bitterness with alcohol warming. The taste becomes more buttery as it warms. Overall this is a fantastic beer. I think it's more balanced than some of the other great Unibroues. It's sweet but not too sweet. The alcohol is somewhat obvious, but not bad at all for 9%.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

22,34,JISurfer,4.33,"Whoa, this is one kick ass brew! I was skeerd(southern for scared) from it, cause it was from canada, and the only beers I had from canada pretty much sucked. I was so suprised. The head was one of the best I had gotten out of a beer in a while. It was very thick and lasted for a very long time. It never really went down to a laceing it was so thick. The color was a pale straw color. Oh, and it was bubbley too. The taste was complex. It had elements of wheat, citrus, flowers, and had a little tinge of alcohol in it. The aftertaste definately had some evidence of alcohol. I guess that was the only drawback, but it wasn't a bad one.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,bierman2000,4.6,"A dangerous beer with a likeness to Duvel. Smooth, golden and full of hops and malt and the alcohol isn't present until after you try to stand up after a couple.

22,34,Scooter77,4.5,"The folks at Unibroue never cease to amaze me. This is such a great beer. Pours a cloudy, golden color topped of by a huge fluffy white head, which settles down to about 1/4-inch. Aromas of cloves, yeasty bread, and spices entice the olfactory senses. Initial taste is sweet and malt, followed by a zing of spiciness. This is a medium-bodied beer finishes quite dry. Im amazed at the complexity of this wonderful nectar. La Fin Du Monde certainly holds true to its name; this is definitely the End of the World, as we know it.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

High carbonation that tickles me nose hair and contains a deep syrupy sweetness with traces of honey and spice in the aroma along with the complement of the yeast strain scents. Tastes a very full complex sweetness with shots of bitter and dry sensations that run down the palate. Within the sweetness of the flavor lies a spiced up fruit like, thick mouthfeel of straight up refreshing goodness. Unibroue is amazing they are definitely capable of bringing the magic of Belgium beer to the North Americas, and for that I raise my glass to them. For making a beer with nine percent alchol that contains this level of drinkability and at the same time is staying within the guidelines of the style of any classic triple.

Damn glad I did as it became one of my favorites on the first sip. Very competitive with the top Belgiums, yet at a lower cost (at last where I get my beer). Cloudy golden color with a nice light, but tight head. Despite a slight tartness, it is still somewhat sweet and very smooth. Also has a nice spice flavor, but not overwhelming. A tripel at its best! Despite the fairly high alcohol content (9%), there is very little alcohol flavor, but it is somewhat noticable on the after taste. Watch out Belgium. I am looking forward to trying the rest of the Unibroue beers. Well, time for another and another and ...........",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,JohnnyDuvel,4.5,"Unibroue really amazes me. Their beer is as good as anybody's. As good as Chimay, Delerium, etc. Also, in that category, it is a relative bargain. The La Fin is not as spicy as the Don De Dieu. It reminds a lot of Chimay white, and maybe Delerium Tremens. Incredibly drinkable, potent as hell. As is the case with the others I've mentioned, pours a huge head, deep golden color, perfect balance. This is one of the few beers I could drink on a regular basis and never grow tired of. I give Duvel a tiny edge, as it is a little unique compared to the other similar beers, but the Unibroue 10, La Fin, and Don de dieu are right there (I also love Maudite and Trios pistoles).

Aroma consisted of yeast, malt, banana and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and smooth. There's peppery spiciness to the flavor, in addition to a sweet fruitiness and cloves.

I met one of the brewers last year at the Boston beer summit and he said that giving out these brews was the best job on earth. When the quality is as high as Unibroue obtains I'd tend to believe that. Pours out a straw gold with a nice white head. The taste is oh so nice. a bit of spice with the nice grain and a tiny bit of the 9% comes through. Sooo smoooth! Very complex, yet so drinkable!  2000 vintage: Mmmm, five year old unibroue! Can't believe I've been able to sit on this so long.  The pour wasn't amazing. The beer is starting to flatten out. So I got sad for a second thinking that maybe the five year old La Finn Du Monde wouldn't deliver. Wrong! Holy shit! This is one of the best bottles of beer I have ever had! Damn! The flavor, mouthfeel, and drinkability have all made it to the realm of perfect scores. If anyone out there has any old unibroue they want to trade, I will forevermore be oh so very down for it!

22,34,TheLongBeachBum,4.8,"A metric 750ml bottle that like other UB offerings has a strange, but quite striking, label.  The Cork was pulled & a gunmetal smoke lingered for a while in the neck, rose & swayed back & forth like an Indian King Cobra whilst peering at the outside world. I wondered if a Genie would appear & grant me three wishes. Sadly, it did not, & eventually the smoke dispersed as I poured the beer into a Duvel glass.  Great looks! This is the consummate incredibly fantastic looking Supermodel; a perfect formed curvaceous tanned body, soft blonde hair and deep ocean-blue eyes  but somehow, you are always drawn to the mole on her top lip. The slight imperfection of the milky hazed golden translucent body of this beer just makes this offering more real, understandable and so damn sexy. The slightly hazed golden color in the Duvel glass also seems so appropriate  a long lost cousin perhaps? Tastes like it.  A massive head builds at first, then like the rubber-neckers at an accident when they realize no-one has been maimed, or died  they soon disperse. The head rescinds to a thin light uni-molecular covering, with a clinging white halo. Some lace, but not much.  Tastes are so refreshing, fruity pineapples mixed with lashings of fresh wheat beer infused with black pepper, clove impregnated apples, pears and some juicy fleshy mangos.  Massive mouthfeel that is partly attributable to the high inherent carbonation I feel. This beer dances on the mouth like a Lap Dancer that spies your wallet full of Money. Not that I would know  I have never had a wallet full of money.  The finish is like spending $300 on a meal for your loved one, it is enjoyable, makes you feel good, but only you know it ever happened, it was experienced, but it is only in your own minds and memories - you lost the receipt as well, so have no proof. Damn. I know this beer is great, indeed, it is a Classic. Its just so hard to prove it.  Definitely Belgium in Style, Duvelian in Looks and Pedigree, Wheat Beer in Education and Influence,  But clearly, VERY Unibroue in Character.  This is no Dumb Blonde  Quite Stupendous. An Aston-Martin of the Beer World; Class, Individuality, Uniqueness and Presence.  ""...Except you , you were talking about the end of the world. I took the money, I spiked your drink, You miss too much these days if you stop to think, You led me on with those innocent eyes, You know I love the element of surprise..  The End of the World ????  well, only when supplies of this beer Run Out for Ever.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

The beer is a soft (slightly cloudy) gold in colour. First taste is crisp, high carbonation with balanced light fruit flavours and a hint of crisp pepper and citrus. This fades smoothly into a soft maltiness with excellent spice. The (high) alchohol is perfectly integrated into the flavour, leaving no harsh or unexpected notes in the taste.  A perfect introduction to the world of Belgian-style strong pale ales, La Fin Du Monde has all the character of a great Belgian but can be consumed on a daily basis (and even a session basis) unlike many great Belgians.

22,34,Mitchster,4.97,"Unibroue review preface: I spent 2 weeks up in Montreal and drank Unibroue beers the whole time. No wonder they call it UniBrew. All their beers taste the same. They are all very subtle variations on a theme..that theme happens to be excellence. That said:  As with other Unibroue's, this also has an interesting bottle. Is it just me or do you see a severed hand in the drawing? Focus, young padewan...  This beer is highly carbonated (forming streamers), mildly cloudy straw-golden with a splash of peach in color, forming a rocky white head atop medium sized bubbles. Delicate lacing. Aroma is spicy and phenolic, with lots of cloves and bananas, yeasty bread, and a crisp, light acidity. Intoxicating Unibroue nose. Alcohol is not noticeable in aroma despite it's ABV of 9.0%. Mouthfeel is light and fizzy, exploding upon the tongue like champagne with a medium-dense, but deceptively light body. Taste is initially typical bavarian wheat phenols with lots of spice, fading into subtle notes of green apples that are starting to rot, a smooth backbone of malted wheat sugars, and finishing with a bready yeastiness and a subtle, yet pleasant alcohol warmth in the gullet. The alcohol is well hidden, but because of the lighter body, it becomes more noticeable as it warms...more so than Maudite (8.0% ABV). At room temperature, I begin to notice a slightly rubbery mouthfeel. The complex sugars tug at your taste buds and envelope them in a swirl of abandon. Easily a sipper, easily a chugger....you decide. Complexities abound with further analysis, but this is a beer that warms your heart and soul. An entire experience in a bottle.  An absolute treasure amongst beers, and an excellent triple in it's own right. World-class and highly recommended. This is just an exceptional brew and one of my personal benchmarks for the style. Ambrosia distilled.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Aroma is a sweet array of fruit and spice, standing far above any other particular aspect. Delightful and heavenly. Is it ""the End of the World"", because it enters us into the next?  Citrusy flavor stands on top, with dazzling hops and a marvelous sparkling sensation on tastebuds. Body is light, and extraordinarily uplighting. This brew handily earns it's rep as the Canadian stand-in for Duvel.  A terrifically engaging, hoppy mouthfeel, and an exceptionally warming feeling make this ideal beer for any sort of celebration, such as Anniversarys, holidays, Wednesdays, midnights, 2:45 A.M.s, anytime you're exultant that the world hasn't ended, didn't get fired, dog still loves you, etc., etc....",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Scads of fine bubbles streaming through a cloudy body. Head is monumental! Super-fine bubbles that are so dense, the head resembles a meringue, where the egg-whites have been beaten to a fare-the-well.  Smell: Citrus, apple, pear, and hops. Doesn&#8217;t quite have the Belgian mustiness that Duvel exudes, but still an impressive nose.  Taste: Yeast and hops meld well with a malt fullness. Did not fill out quite as much as I expected as the beer warmed, although spice notes became more apparent. Alcohol was well-integrated but notable. Finish wasn&#8217;t quite as substantial as I had hoped, considering the initial complexity of the flavors.  Mouthfeel: Warm. Creamy carbonation fills the mouth. Carbonation seemed more aggressive than I remembered and a touch coarser than suggested by the head and tiny bead.  Drinkability: A very drinkable beer that should be kept on hand for regular sampling.  It amazes me how well Unibroue has seemingly effortlessly mastered the process of brewing such good, Belgian-style beers. Although I feel that they may have too many variations without too much difference, no one can fault the products. They are subtle, flavorful, well-crafted brews that continue to impress.  Backwash: This is a great beer, although I believe that it should probably sell for a bit less, considering the C$; and I think that Duvel (typically $6.99) is a better beer and costs more to ship. If this were priced like Ommegang (as it originally was), I would buy it by the case. Other than the limited Unibroue 10, this is probably my favorite Unibroue product so far (until I get my hands on the 11 and the La Terrible). Well worth the purchase. Thank you Canada!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,shirfan,4.42,"Intense carbonation; the warning label about uncorking the bottle isn't just there for fun.  Poured a rich clear golden color with a moderate head which was continuously replaced by streamers moving the length of the glass. Second pour (after swirling up some yeast from the thick layer at the botttom of the bottle) produced a murkier yellow, still every bit as carbonated.  Smell is rich and sweet, warns of the complex flavor ahead.  Taste is yeasty and just as complex, like a hefeweizen but meaner. Notes of apple, banana, and clove. Very sweet, but just enough bitterness in the finish to not feel like soda pop... and the carbonation could easily lead one to be mistaken otherwise.  There is no hint of alcohol in this at all... until about 15 minutes later. ""Oh, THERE you are!"" Definitely a sneaky ABV, but I'll forgive this brew, I doubt anyone can stay angry at it for long.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,hyuga,4.92,"Pale golden in color with a huge white head. Head stays fairly well. Excellent aroma that I'm taking great pleasure in. Black pepper spiciness, tart fruitiness, breadiness, and plain old yeast. Sure, it doesn't sound like much, but it certainly is a pleasure to sniff. And to drink...! Wow, I'm impressed. Sweetness and black pepper, odd combination? No way, it's great! Up front it's a little hoppy, then in the middle it gets to the sweet and peppery bit. Bready and a little yeasty as well, all the way through. Tangy citrus and fruitiness shows up at the back a bit more. Hop bitterness is really brought out in the finish, making it very crisp. Medium body. You'd never guess at the abv. Not a hint of it is detectable! A wonderful representation of the style, one of the best even. A wonderful beer in itself. It makes you think, what if the world was about to end? What would be your last beer? I'd say this wouldn't be a bad choice at all.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,IrishRedRock,4.3,"This is exceptional...no surprise coming from Unibroue though. It poured a cloudy off-yellow color with a thick foamy white head. I was hoping it would smell more like Don de Dieu, but it was not quite up to par with it...mild fruit, yeast, and spices.  The taste and sheer drinkability of this brew make it spectacular. Unless you read the 9% written on the bottle, it is very hard to detect. Alcohol flavor is only mild toward the end of each sip. Has flavors of clove, ripe fruits, banana, apple, and mild spices. A smooth, delicious mouthfeel make this a delight to drink a few of. Definitely one to enjoy in all its complexities.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BeerBuilder,3.93,"Keep your glass close by on this one, it is a bottle gusher. Popped the top on this one and it came rushing out. Once in my glass it was a hazy, golden-straw color, with a off-white head that left good lacing. The aroma was sweet, of candi sugar. Also in the aroma was spices, and graininess. The flavors I detected were of cloves, spice, and sweet candi sugar. It is fairly light to medium in body, and easy drinking. The alcohol warmth is in the finish, and the strength sneaks up on you. Tasty!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Nice dry aftertaste with no syrupy mouthfeel..just taste and carbonation...warm belly to boot. Goes down nice & easy for a beer this high ABV...easy does it!!!!.

22,34,stoutlove77,4.49,"This one put the nail on the coffin for me. I had this one after a good night of beer tasting. The look was a golden blonde with the look that reminded me of champange with the head looking rather light. The smell is what resembled a sweet tangy candy with tints of spice, at some point it reminded me of apple pie. The taste was no doubt as close to the smell, has a tangy fruit based sometimes close to strawberries with an after taste of maple syrup. The drinkablity was the key point here, all that flavor with a 9% ABV in stealth mode, was the note the put me to sleep after. When having a beer for dinner consider this a candidate.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Jason,4.97,"12 oz brown bottle with a foiled top, a best before date on the back label.  Appearance: Foamy off white head that takes a long while to subside to a sticky lace. Cloudy yet radiant yellowish golden colour shows that this is a pale brew.  Smell: Ripe sugary nectarines, a powdery yeast and a light phenolic clove and medicinal mix in the aroma. Alcoholic esters with a touch of solvent linger in the back of the nose.  Taste: Peppery clove spiciness with a warming alcohol right behind it. Estery with a hint of solvent-like character in the high level of alcohol. Malt lays down some sweetness with a thick drying pale graininess, fruity flavours of mango and pear flash on the taste buds. Bitterness from the hops melds with the thick powdery yeast and bring the mouth to a slightly dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy with a medium to high carbonation.  Drinkability & Notes: One of my favourite Belgian style pale strong ales, a bit over the top for some people and one that I respect by sipping through the night.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,kunzbrew,4.32,Pours a cloudy light straw color with a monster of head. with bubbles flowing to the top. The smell of citrus packes the nose with a punch.

22,34,HopheadEd,4.25,"Pours a hazy yellow you can not see through, big, big, head. Aroma of citris, lemon, grapefruit. Great clean, crisp mouthfeel with big carbonation, ala champagne. First sip reveals a little alcohol, but is soon hidden with complex fruit flavors and a small hop bite. Lace to the bottom of the glass, again, a slight alcohol finish, but still very drinkable. One of my favorites from Unibroue.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,purplehops,4.24,"End of the World pours a cloudy amber yellow with a white compact head. Little lacing on the glass. The aroma is apples, mace, and pear with hints of alcohol and malt. The taste starts with a carbonated rush of malt with background notes of orange peel and coriander. The finish is dry with notes of spicy hops and apples with hints of pepper. The after taste is malt sweetness balanced with yeast fruitiness (apples, pears, apricot, & bananas?) and alcohol. The mouthfeel is warm and effervescent. It causes the muscles in your face to form a smile while drinking. Another very nice product from Unibroue. A refreshing Belgian style strong ale true to style.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,cretemixer,4.08,"750 ml bottle. Pours a pale golden hue with a slight cloudiness(me like!) Dense creamy-white head which settles at about 1/4 inch. The carbonation won't let it get any less than that. Clean malty smell that reminds me of a fine Belgian. Spruce undertones. Alcohol warmth hits right away with a slight bitter bite. Smooth & creamy mouthfeel. Overall pretty impressive, but not my favorite Unibroue product.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Gusler,4.12,"One sip of a Unibroue beer several years ago started a continuous love affair with this brewery, and the whole line of their beers, La Fin Du Monde was that first beer, what a stroke of luck that was for this Grizzled Old Beer Swiller.  As it pours from the bottle, a slightly hazy lemon yellow, the head creamy in texture, the size masterful, the color a brilliant white, as it evanesces it leaves a silky sheet of fine lace to cover the glass. The aroma of finely malted grains dominates the nose, citrus crisp, lightly sweet and a pleasure to the senses. Start is ambrosial with lots of malt, the top middling in its feel with a spirited acidity, masterfully hopped, and a long drawn-out aftertaste that is dry. The 9% ABV, make this a real Belly Warmer, for these cold winter days and nights, a beer I love, and I always have a few bottles on hand as they age gracefully and I wish I could say the same for my own self.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Wildman,4.97,"This beer poured a golden straw color and formed a bubbly white head that left circular lace. A small amount of carbonation was present. It had an aroma of citrus, spice(?clove) and some yeast elements. The flavor was of spice and citrus with a warming feeling of the alcohol present. The finish was a touch astrigent",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mickstepp,4.34,"First of all I feel bad about pouring this beer into a pint glass (it's all I have). But I'm really excited about trying it. I'm not well versed in the Belgian art (but not quite a virgin either). It pours a very effervescent yellow (lots of bubbly action in the glass) with a thin head. There's an appealing sour-lemon aroma with a little yeastiness. At first sip I'm thinking boy am I drinking this beer at the wrong time of year. Very refreshing, very summery. Comparable to some of the best Hefe's I've had but without the banana/clove flavors. Moderate body, very nice texture. The tart and sweet flavors compete but keep each other in balance. Tart in the beginning, more sweet in the finish. Clearly an accomplished brew even f you're not an expert in the style. I'll have more. Maybe in Quebec.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,MaineBeerMan,4.75,"This beer is a cloudy golden yellow, with a huge merangue like head of snow white foam that lasts a very long time and sticks like glue, leaving loads of lace. Smells of fruit (pears or peaches?), light clove, earthy yeast and a bit of alcohol only begin to describe the complex aroma of this brew. Awesome flavor, rather sweet and fruity, lots of complex spice flavors, clove and and a fruity flavor that I can't quite pin down that resembles the aroma. Very complex and tasty. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, even with the higher carbonation of this beer, long lingering finish of hops and fruit. An outstanding beer, one of my favorite Belgian styles and not too pricey to boot.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ElGuapo,4.55,"you pour out a wonderful pale golden colored brew with a massive white foamy head that wants to jump right out of the glass. the aroma is of yeast and a lot of sweetness that tickles the nose.  you get a wonderful yeasty beer with some sweet fruitiness in there. alcohol is barely noticeable in the finish. i am glad that the alcohol was kept under control.  the carbonation tingles your tongue as the smooth brew slides right down smooth as silk, leaving your tongue warm and leaving you warm and fuzzy. this is truly an incredible beer. i love Unibroue",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,StevieW,4.7,"12 oz bottle. Shiny golden color. A swirl of the bottle will clould things a bit. Rich and foamy off-white head. Great citrus smell. Some yeast richness also sneaks by. Perfectly balanced belgian pale ale. Nice rich yeasty goodness, and sweet candied taste. Sweet plums, cherries and apples all come to mind. Slightly fizzy carbonation but it settles. Belly warming alcohol is present toward the finish. Mostly it just sneaks by and leaves you wondering how they made such a great beer. Not much I can, say that hasn't already been described. A great beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Great mouthfeel and moderate carbonation., malts of candied plums and cherries, slightest sense of a pithy hop bittering at the end. Just a hint of a wheat quality and little woodsy sense. A lot of fresh qualities. La Fin du Monde? Nah, this is just a beginning, one that gives me a sense of being live in Belgium and sampling the Ales fresh. Maybe my favorite Unibroue so far, powerful but tasty and drinkable",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Taste is of lemon and spices with a high alcohol content present. Leaves a sticky coating on the tongue after finishing but is quite drinkable for a something with 9.0% ABV. Very fizzy carbonation leaves light feeling in mouth. Drinking at 9PM on a Sunday night, it is a good way to cap off the night and the weekend.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,CharlesRiver,4.37,"Pours a cloudy off yellow color with a small white head that didn't seem to last. The smell is fruity and a bit raw. Coriander, citrus and some other odd spices are what I taste in the beginning. The end is more like lemon and spices. A bit in your face at first but very smooth in the end. I am very impressed to say the least. Can this company produce a bad beer?",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,HossMcGraw,4.72,"It's difficult for me to describe this beer because the flavor is pretty much all over the place. A floral taste equally combined with a bold wheat flavor kicks things off, and from there, you're on your own to figure out what flavors you encounter. I sure as hell have a hard time. Ripe fruit with a subtle but noticeable malt flavor might do the trick. I hated this beer at first, but I grew to love the complexity and richness of it. If you're kind of a rookie beer taster like me, check out the Unibroue variety case. It's bomb.

Appearance is wonderful and does have nice rings of wispy lace and good head retention. Fruity, cider-like aroma with pepper and yeast. Medium bodied and very smooth on the palate. Starts with a sweet maltiness that makes way for clove and peppery flavors. Very complex, finishes slightly dry with some hop flavor.

Light golden in color, hazy with a *lot* of carbonation. The head dissipated fairly quicky, but perhaps this was due to my glass rather than the beer.  Aroma is fruity, hints of banana and tropical fruit. Yeast is very unobtrusive.  The beer is terrifically balanced, with European hops, gentle corriander, and a peppery cloveish spiciness sitting atop a sweet light malty body. Medium bodied, though feels lighter due to high carbonation. Slightly dry finish. You'll feel the alcohol before you taste it.  Exceptionally well-done tripel.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

It's citrusy and slightly sweet with hints of clove and bubblegum. A little bit of yeast in there with a nice crisp finish. The high alcohol content really enhances this beer, taking the flavors up through the nose. Take your time drinking it, as it becomes almost an entirely different beer as it warms.  As a warning, this beer will cause ""beer-inflation"" among its fans. Those once content to imbibe in a $6 six-packs of Sam Adams, will find themselves shelling out $8.50 for four-packs on Unibroue products on a regular basis.

The liquid is bright yellow-white with a hint of orange. The nose is of coriander (?!) dried orange (?!) green figs and cardamom. Heady but bright aromatics! On the palate it is liquified white plums and whipped cream. A kick of bitter minerality emerges on the finish to keep the generous floral, herb and fruit flavors in focus.

I poured it into a nice thistle style glass and was amazed by the fantastic head that seemed to only fade slightly. The nice creamy head atop the beautiful pale ale is a sight to behold. The aroma was delicate with a hint of vanilla and citrus. While being high in alcohol, it was not evident at all. This brew is well worth finding. One of my all time favorites.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,MAB,4.77,"Probably my favorite ""Belgian Style"" beer, at least until I have a Maudite and wonder which is my real favorite. It is a paler color than Maudite, and the flavor is spicy with citrusey/ clove accents. It usually has a nice head and I always get Belgian lace as it drains. Please do as the suggestion on the bottle recommends and don't drink this from a straight sided glass. I've tried the same bottle in both types of glasses and it really is better in a closed top glass. Can't explain why- perhaps the alcohol and smells are trapped better giving you more taste through your nose. Other than ""10"", which is similar in style but won't be around next year, I don't think, since it was made for their tenth anniversary, Fin de Monde (""the end of the world"" for non-french speakers) is definitely worth stocking and savoring.  It also is supposed to age up to ten years in a corked bottle- see my review for Maudite, and what aging did for that!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

Definite orange peels, spices, and a slight tartness to the aroma. Big fruitiness up front with some nice oranges, peaches, grapes, and some slightly tart fruitiness as well. Nice spiciness as well with some pepper and coriander. The brew finishes with a burst of sweetness from the candy sugar and a slight warming sensation from the alcohol. A creamy carbonated feeling dominates the mouthfeel and helps to make this medium-light bodied beer extremely drinkable, especially for the amount of alcohol that is in it.

A nice malt taste, mixed with esters and yeast make the beer very pleasant. I also get fleeting hints of sour apples. I have to second other reviewer's notes that the beer hides it's alcohol well. Nicely balanced, slightly grassy finish. A very drinkable belgian style ale.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,NeroFiddled,4.42,"Astonishingly different on tap than it is from the bottle - but not necessarily better. I think it benefits greatly from the high level of carbonation that can be lessened on tap. Cloudy, yellow-gold in color with a full, bright-white head that holds fairly well and leaves a decent lace. The body is similarly light-medium, but the mouthfeel is more creamy as the carbonation has been reduced. There's a lightly sweet ""tropical fruit"" note to the aroma. The flavor has a more ""orange-ish"" note, and a gentler spice. Overall, it seems to lose a bit of character which is normally derived from the assertive carbonation bite. Still a very good beer but on draft it seems to taste like many other beers in its category.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,marc77,4.55,"The clear light golden / dark straw hued brew is topped by a creamy, impressively thick head w/ stiff peaks of foam. Signature lace is left down the glass. Fruit esters comprised of tart lemon flesh and rind, coupled w/ cidery light candi / beet sugar sweetness and raw honey lend an enticing aroma to this brew. Phenolic clove and mustiness are subdued, but add complexity aromawise. Prickly carbonation and cidery sweetness sharply hit the palate upfront, but quickly yield to yeasty, unbaked dough notes and clove more prominent in flavor than the aroma would suggest. Well attenuated and fairly dry, but since hop bitterness is mild, the overall flavor is slightly skewed towards malt sweetness. Lightly bodied due to the sugar used in the grist w/ a crisp, yet smooth mouthfeel that lends deceptively agreeable drinkability. Finishes dry w/ honey sweetness, lightly peppery alcohol and clove abruptly ending simultaneously. Fin Du Monde epitomizes the style and is delicious... the drinkability is superlative considering its strength.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Bighuge,4.33,"The hazy golden brew throws out a long-lasting bubbly white head that forms craters as it slowly dissipates. Some nice yeast tones on the nose. A little fruitiness. And some bread qualities too. This beer is quite smooth for the high alcohol punch that it packs. Very nice taste. Doughy and yeasty. Fruity esters are present. Subtle spicing accents also surface mildly throughout. The body is light and the mouthfeel is quite carbonated, but still very drinkable. Very nice Belgian style beer.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96

It was a little tart with some warming alcohol (9% ABV) lying underneath. It reminded me a little of Duvel in that it hides that big alcohol content underneath a somewhat bittersweet taste and bubbly mouthfeel which just attacked my palate. This one worked well with teryaki marinated pork chops on the grill.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,aracauna,4.2,"Insanely active head. Big airy foam. It was difficult to pour it softly enough to keep it under control, but from the taste and the lack of foamy at opening, it wasn't infected. Aroma is lemon on top of apricots. Light lemony/apricot flavor that rides on a noticeable malt backbone. Has a little of the cottony mouthfeel but not enough to hurt the drinkability. Probably the best Belgian golden ale I've tried.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,LarryV,4.47,"This is another of my favorites from Unibroue. Pours with a nice fluffy white head that dissipates quickly. Has rather effervescent carbonation. Smell is citrusy with a spicy note to it. Not as creamy of a mouth feel as the Don De Dieu, but I suppose that's partly due to the carbonation. Flavor is citrusy, banana like. There's a spice that I can't quite put my finger on, tastes like allspice to me. This is a wonderful beer for sitting back and relaxing on a hot summer day.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,the42ndtourist,4.92,"750mL bottle (w/ cork). The first pouring yielded little head, but the smell which hit me almost immediately as I started pouring was a beautiful citrus and peach odour. The colour was a beautiful cloudy pale gold. The taste is magnificent, completely disguising the high alcohol content. The second pouring gave about 2cm of head, and tasted just as good as the first. An extremely good and drinkable beer!! Glad I am that I chose this to drink on my birthday.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BeerManDan,4.5,"La Fin Du Monde is the best that ""Unibroue"" has to offer. I can taste the citrus flavor on my tongue which leads to a pleasant finish. Very smooth with not a lot of bitter after taste. I'm keep this brew for myself!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Reverand,4.5,"Translation of La Fin Du Monde is the end of the world. I would certainly travel to the end of the world for this beer. An amazing example ofthis style. The cloudy orange - yellow appearance with a beautiful white that clings to the glass. The complexity of the taste will have you thinking of adjectives to descirbe this beer. But simply out and in ine word ""incredible""",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,pbrian,4.07,"12 oz bottle ""BB 10-31-04."" How appropriate it would have been to wait 'till Halloween to drink this beer. Oh well.  Hazy golden orange appearance, decent head and lace, steady supply of carbonation. Wonderful aroma- orangy citrus fruits, spicy yeast, alcohol. Peppery spices, light malts, and orange and alcohol come back around in the flavor. Drying finish. Would I be hanged if I thought this beer was slightly watery? It certainly wouldn't be the end of the world.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,BeerAngel,3.8,"Pours a cloudy yellow/amber color with a 2 finger pure white head that dissipates displaying large soap-like bubbles. The smell is a pleasant fruity hoppy smell. Similar in taste fruit-wise as some of the lower ranked Unibroue products, but the hop bitterness helps this brew. I don't like this as well as Trois Pistoles, but it is still a little better than good. Still a nice experience. A votre sante!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,frank4sail,4.11,"Pale with a tint of orange and a nice white sticky head. Complex nose withalcohol/yeast/sweet malt/ and citrus (orange) nose. Bold initial taste of yeast and soft orange and spicy malt. Soft mouth at first then it dries as you taste. There is a constant white sheen and lace on the brew. The finish is one of big ABV and hints of banana. This brew slaps you in the face like the girl you hit on in the back seat when you were 16. Bold, creative, and menacing. I consider this brew the adolecent of the unibroue family (not referring to the taste) Ahhh those were the days...  PS... The rest of the family might go like this Maudite is sweet mom, raftman grandpop, ""10"" of course little sister, L'Eau Benite Dad, Blanche De'Chably (the playboy mag under the mattress, and Trois Pistoles grand mom.... Adopt me please...",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Bierman9,4.42,"Quite the pleasing bier! Lots of cloudiness, due to swirling in the yeasties! Gives it a dull, golden-yellow color, though it starts out with a golden haziness to begin with. Has a rich, bright white, fine head, plentiful bubbles rising through the golden nectar, with decent lace to boot. Spicy, peppery nose, with a hint of fruitiness present and some bready malt. Medium body, and lovely smoothness on my tongue. Flavor had some suggestions of malty sweetness (just a hair) but yeasty, spiciness is it's main attribute. Quite a bit of peppery notes here as well. A warming feeling evident down the hatch. A joy to drink!  overall: 4.35 appearance: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4.5  203",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jackndan,3.8,"La Fin Du Monde: The End of the World. Had it in a 750 ml bottle, with the cork top. Until I joined BA, I would never have bought such a beer. Until I reviewed so many (now 100! Beers), I would have gushed over this beer. But I must say, it seems like a paler version of its Belgian counterparts. It was a wonderful looking beer, but had huge chunks of the sediment floating in the second glass, despite my best efforts to pour it steady. Cloudy, golden appearance. Aroma was very pleasant of citrus and yeast. The beer itself was very nice, crisp and clean (almost airy) with a mix of bananas and citrus (fresh oranges). All in all, this beer did not have the aggressive characteristics of a beer like Duvel, and at six bucks a bottle, I was looking for more.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mickeymac,4.57,"It's a nice gold with a white head that disappeared quickly. The smell and taste are citrus and spice with just a hint of hops. This is a beer that would probably be enjoyed by many who aren't accustomed to high-gravity beers because the smell and taste of alcohol aren't overwhelming. However, the ABV could make LFDM dangerous for the uninitiated. This is another nice beer from our friends up north.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,inebrius,4.57,"It's rather hard to believe that this brew contains 9% ABV. Pale, pale wonderfully pale. Fruity must and spice nose. The moment you notice the sweetness a rush of mellow bitterness tugs your buds for attention. At the ""End of the World"" there is a brewery that turns out some fantastic beers. Quality, Eh!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Longstaff,4.68,"At warmer serving temps this is highly carbonated and will gush out of the bottle like champagne if you don't get in the glass fast enough. Has a lemony, sulfur like aroma. Vanilla, apple flavors blend well with phenolic alcohol flavors. Some mild spice taste. Just the right amount of sweetness from sugar additions. Dangerously easy to drink.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,WilliamPhilaPa,4.56,"(BB date 9-04) Pours a nice cloudy peach or light orange color (almost blond). Superb appearance! High alcohol kick and fruity character on the palate, with an ever so light tartness to it, and maybe notes of apple peels too. Over all this is an excellent Belgian Ale and another great one from Unibroue I thought this was going to be hard to top.Orval Trappist Ale was the next in line!",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,rastaman,3.53,"Well, on futher inspection, i find the alcohol to be to overwhelming, quite peppery and yeasty, with some mango nectar style stuff happening, with perhaps a bit of a white wine like character, a bit cloying and sweetish like many other Unibroue beers, but i still enjoyed it enough to give it a decent score.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,mophie,4.87,"My second Unibroue, and I am hooked. I love the hazy, orange-yellow look of this beer. Someone mentioned mysterious, and I agree. The smell is intoxicating, fruity, peppery, an almost exotic spiciness. The taste is equally amazing, like a burst of flavors that go off in different directions that meld together to create a perfect balance of sweet fruitiness, bitter orange rind, and peppery spice. I want another.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,cokes,4.92,"Simply outstanding. I wish I could bathe in this stuff. Cloudy straw in color. Some people may knock it for being so hazy and unrefined. I personally like beer that is cloudy..it adds to the mystery. The yeast really add complexities layed upon more complexities. I am somewhat at a loss as to how to describe the taste. Others have mentioned tart apples...yeah maybe, but so much more. Each sip is a new experience. A beer that no doubt would age well. Unibroue is an expectional brewery, and this is (in my opinion) their best offering.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,jermar,4.07,"Tastes surprisingly like a mimosa, with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Deceptively high alcohol content. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but it's clearly well made.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,ThreePistols,4.06,"Cloudy, blond, with a long lasting white fluffy head. Spicy, bubbly, and slightly tangy. There is an alcohol presence that is slightly warming, but it is not overwhelming. A strong, souring, complex, lengthy aftertaste.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,John,4.66,Fantastic beer! Truly a world class beer from Unibroue.,Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Brent,4,"One of the milder-flavored offerings from this brewery. Nicely done, very smooth and drinkable.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
22,34,Todd,4.7,"Presentation: ""La Fin Du Monde"", translates to ""The End of the World."" The label is comprised of a god like light, or god's eye, that illuminates Quebec with a top view of the terrain. Very ominous.  Appearance: Pale/straw with a nation of bubbles that can be seen rushing to the surface. When poured a huge froth is produced that leaves behind a patchy white lace that is maintained by the rushing fizz. Nice head retention that sticks slightly to the glass.  Smell: Cider, pepper, flowers and light fruits are all present in the nose.  Taste: This brew is very smooth and sweet up-front with loads of malt mouth-feel. A warming sensation begins in the back of the tongue and turns into a spicy, almost pepper, flavour. This flavour is the 9% alcohol which cleverly camouflages itself until consumed. A very light hop flavour is left behind, with warming esters in the mouth.  Notes: Truly a potent and delicious brew with many hard to achieve complexities. Unlike other brews of this strength, this one is extremely drinkable due to its balance of alcohol and dextrins. Outstanding.",Unibroue,"Quebec, Canada",Tripel,96
